[15:06] years that the Locust ha eaten the
[15:09] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[15:11] Palmer worm my great Army which I sent
[15:16] among you
[15:19] and I'd like to speak to you uh by the
[15:22] help of the Lord um on the heartache of
[15:26] a veteran uh part three let's just bow
[15:29] our
[15:31] heads precious
[15:33] Lord
[15:35] truly we're
[15:37] grateful to be
[15:41] gathered under the banner of your
[15:45] love and so
[15:49] thankful to be able to come before you
[15:53] this
[15:55] morning uh not in fear
[15:59] but in confidence in assurance that
[16:04] you'll speak to us in the way in which
[16:09] your word said you
[16:11] would and your children has gathered
[16:14] here this
[16:15] morning not to hear a man but to hear
[16:18] from
[16:19] you and Lord I certainly want to be one
[16:24] of those hearers as well and so we just
[16:28] just want to surrender ourselves this
[16:31] morning Lord each one myself the
[16:35] congregation Lord that we would be able
[16:38] to receive something from you this
[16:41] morning to help us along our Christian
[16:44] Journey we ask Lord that you would be
[16:49] welcome in this place that our Spirits
[16:53] would have that welcoming vibration Lord
[16:58] as your Prophet had come in contact with
[17:01] so many
[17:02] times Lord that's an unseen realm but
[17:07] Lord we certainly want that to be the
[17:10] preeminent part of our Lives Lord that
[17:13] we would welcome whatever would come
[17:16] from
[17:17] above Lord that we would be able to have
[17:21] the wisdom to speak your word and your
[17:25] word
[17:26] alone that we would have uh courage to
[17:33] say something that may be
[17:36] cutting but also there would be love
[17:40] behind it that would be able to bring
[17:44] healing Lord we want to surrender in a
[17:49] way that you could have the
[17:51] preeminence and that's my prayer I I
[17:55] will certainly Lord be a fool for you
[17:58] this morning
[17:59] and so I pray in the name that's above
[18:04] every name our Lord and Savior Jesus
[18:07] Christ that you would have your
[18:09] way amen and amen praise the Lord you
[18:14] could be seated if you
[18:18] like
[18:22] um you know
[18:25] um we won't need to necessarily
[18:29] um refer back um to the past couple
[18:34] services that I have taken along this
[18:37] subject as it's
[18:39] um um not
[18:42] necessary um but I I know as we as
[18:48] Christians sometimes we um have
[18:52] different expectations of what the
[18:54] Christian walk is going to
[18:56] be when we
[18:59] uh are in the world and all of us maybe
[19:03] have different um depths in which we go
[19:06] into the world some of us may have
[19:09] stayed close to Mom and
[19:11] Dad um maybe Mom and Dad were solid
[19:15] Christians and they were an example in
[19:19] which you uh found confidence in and you
[19:24] never partook way out yonder into the
[19:27] things of the world and and eventually
[19:29] you came to your own testimony and your
[19:32] own personal experience and walk with
[19:35] the Lord and others of us uh maybe not
[19:39] have had that example and um and maybe
[19:43] some of us even had that example and we
[19:45] still went over uh that roadblock that
[19:49] was in the road and crawled right over
[19:51] the top of it or crawled underneath it
[19:54] and all of us have different um paths in
[19:59] which we uh walk this Christian Journey
[20:02] but we're all trying to get to the to
[20:04] the main
[20:06] goal we we're we're trying to uh find uh
[20:11] the path that leads to the
[20:14] almighty that's that's uh that's I
[20:17] believe uh as uh that brother brandom
[20:21] had told one time I believe it was
[20:22] brother Tony zel is Deacon believe he
[20:25] had a dream and uh and in that dream he
[20:29] was and I'm coming off of memory so
[20:32] forgive me if I get something wrong but
[20:34] it's always been something that stuck
[20:36] out to me that uh he he comes up to some
[20:39] famous uh preachers and and they tell
[20:42] him that that see that little man up
[20:45] there and I think he said in bib's
[20:46] overhauls and he said you need to go see
[20:49] him and when he got and Tony zel came to
[20:51] that man it ended up being brother
[20:54] brandham and then uh brother brandham
[20:57] said to him brother brother brother Tony
[20:59] uh uh this is as far as I can take
[21:04] you the prophet of God can only take it
[21:06] so
[21:07] far but but he he did only what a
[21:11] prophet could do and he said but you see
[21:13] those bloody
[21:15] Footprints he said follow
[21:18] those and and that's what we do in this
[21:21] Christian journey is we follow those
[21:23] bloody Footprints and what what what an
[21:27] amazing statement it could be that who
[21:28] would want to follow bloody Footprints
[21:30] but there's something on the inside of
[21:32] us that says I want to follow those
[21:34] bloody Footprints and and it goes beyond
[21:37] just what we can think in our mental
[21:39] intellect I mean thinking of what
[21:41] brother Alistair said it seems crazy
[21:43] what we what we do believe if you really
[21:45] think about it and but but to us for
[21:48] some odd reason it just makes a certain
[21:50] sound it rings true and and I'm thankful
[21:54] that I have those kind of ears that it
[21:56] may be crazy to the world but but it's
[21:59] assurance and confidence to me that that
[22:02] when I uh see God's word and and and and
[22:05] and hear that profit they just ring true
[22:08] together and and and it helps me it
[22:10] gives me Comfort I I find comfort in
[22:13] God's word when I'm on this Christian
[22:15] journey and and uh being that we're
[22:18] we're in the battle that we are and and
[22:20] we all are in a fight uh some of us may
[22:24] be on a Mountaintop right now and and
[22:26] some of us may be in a valley
[22:29] and and it's not uh it's it's not a a
[22:32] easy place to be when you're in the
[22:35] valley but but we all go there at some
[22:38] point in time in our Christian journey
[22:41] and if we would and if we would uh be
[22:43] honest with ourselves when we are in
[22:46] those low spots in life that's when it
[22:48] really is the best experience of a
[22:52] Christian and it doesn't seem like that
[22:55] at the point of time but but it's when
[22:57] you look back that's whenever something
[23:01] Rings true and you realize that that's
[23:04] when you grew the most it it wasn't in
[23:07] the service when when a mighty preacher
[23:09] was preaching and and you felt 10 foot
[23:11] tall and bulletproof but but it was when
[23:14] you was in the lowest Valley it was it
[23:17] was when you didn't feel like bride of
[23:19] Christ and it was when you was at the
[23:21] point of of brink of of giving up on
[23:24] God's
[23:26] word it it it's it's it's at the point
[23:29] when you lost your desire for the
[23:34] word oh come on somebody listen listen
[23:38] we we we all at some point in time or
[23:41] maybe it hasn't and well I said I I mean
[23:43] maybe there is some that always been on
[23:45] the mountain toop and they never been on
[23:47] them low valleys but but there's times
[23:50] in my life and in my own time my own
[23:55] uh I always thought why why Lord I I I
[23:59] can't I can't live what it's telling me
[24:02] to live
[24:07] yes you know there's
[24:11] there's there's times when they're on
[24:13] the battlefield when we got to take a
[24:18] knee and we didn't have that Shield at
[24:21] the right place where supposed to
[24:23] be and that Arrow got
[24:26] through yes sir
[24:29] yes I don't know about you brother but I
[24:33] I I I've been wounded many a time and
[24:36] sometimes it was
[24:44] self-inflicted this old man gets in the
[24:46] way all the
[24:48] time he may be 50 years old today but he
[24:51] still got a whole lot of
[24:53] [Music]
[24:56] vigor and sometimes I I think man I mean
[25:00] you're supposed to be old and you're
[25:02] supposed to slow down but it but Mike it
[25:05] just don't get no easy this old flesh is
[25:07] still rare in the go and and a lot of
[25:10] times in life this flesh is totally
[25:13] contrary to God's
[25:14] [Applause]
[25:18] word but that's whenever we have to have
[25:20] the assurance that there's something
[25:22] deeper on the
[25:23] inside and you know when we think about
[25:26] people that's on the battlefield
[25:29] you know I I I think in the hour that we
[25:31] live that
[25:33] that as you take somebody that's a true
[25:38] veteran you take somebody that's really
[25:40] been on the
[25:41] battlefield you you you take you take
[25:44] somebody that you know thank thankfully
[25:47] by by God's grace my my daddy was a
[25:50] Marine in the times uh uh
[25:53] Vietnam and uh uh but but he was
[25:57] actually station in
[25:59] okanawa which was a a landing plaid a
[26:02] jumping spot to go to take the troops
[26:05] from America to okanawa to
[26:08] Vietnam and and I'm thankful that that
[26:10] he was in that safe space right and and
[26:15] so that was his lot in life and I'm
[26:17] grateful for that because if that wasn't
[26:19] his lot in life there may not have been
[26:21] a brother Gabe but but you take some of
[26:25] those o older those soldiers that didn't
[26:28] stop at okanawa but went to Vietnam and
[26:32] and and you talk to those soldiers that
[26:35] was on the battlefield if if you if you
[26:38] ever come across somebody that's really
[26:40] been on the battlefield and seen their
[26:43] their fellow Brethren Fall by the
[26:45] wayside and die and spill their blood
[26:48] for their own country if if you've ever
[26:51] seen a veteran that that has had to to
[26:54] to to put his uh rifle or or or bear
[26:57] arms and take another man's life for a
[27:00] conviction that he had but but the vast
[27:04] majority of those veterans you won't
[27:06] hear them say nothing about
[27:11] it there there won't be no
[27:14] brag there won't there won't be no
[27:18] flash but when you look in their eyes
[27:21] what you'll see is heartache yes
[27:25] sir because he saw a another Soldier
[27:29] fall whether it was fighting on the
[27:31] right side or the wrong side if he's a
[27:35] true Soldier and a true veteran he still
[27:38] has a heart and a feeling for his
[27:40] Brethren on the
[27:42] battlefield and I I think that we're
[27:45] coming to the hour that we ought to have
[27:49] that same type of Heartache for those
[27:52] that are crossed Enemy Lines
[28:01] you know if you see somebody that loves
[28:03] to
[28:04] fight something's
[28:08] wrong if if you got that old Fighting
[28:11] Spirit you may want to check
[28:14] yourself because remember before they
[28:16] could enter the promised land the old
[28:18] Fighters had to die
[28:20] off and there had to be another
[28:22] generation that rose up that wasn't an
[28:25] old
[28:26] fighter and and it and it and it gives
[28:30] us uh a warning because sometimes you
[28:34] see people and they just love to be
[28:37] combative and and if we would we would
[28:41] realize that some you know brother
[28:43] branom says that whenever whenever we
[28:46] come in in into a conflict with somebody
[28:49] that that we ought to stop what we're
[28:53] doing and go pray
[28:58] so if if you're in a conflict with
[29:01] somebody I want to ask you brother
[29:02] brandom gives us the
[29:04] recipe and and um I'll just read it to
[29:08] you if if now you know
[29:11] uh last night I had 262
[29:18] slides
[29:23] 262 but uh I cut it down to about 12
[29:26] something so
[29:28] [Laughter]
[29:31] don't worry I'm not I'm not uh uh we're
[29:34] not going to go through 120 of now it
[29:36] just I just to me though you know um
[29:40] when when you see
[29:42] something
[29:45] um I I don't I don't like to
[29:49] um I like to just if I have 120 sides
[29:53] but if I just go through three but
[29:55] that's the only three the Lord wants you
[29:57] to see to me that's all that it matters
[30:00] and so we as Ministry we study to show
[30:04] oursel approved and we try to lay before
[30:06] the Lord but ultimately I just want you
[30:09] to be blessed amen I want every soul
[30:12] young and old to walk out of here with
[30:14] something that will help them on their
[30:16] Christian
[30:17] Journey because when when we not only
[30:19] are we're fighting here some of us are
[30:22] fight fighting sleep some of us already
[30:25] lost a battle of
[30:26] sleep and
[30:28] and and but others is is fighting right
[30:31] now and had a late night uh thinking of
[30:33] my wife she done you know spent all
[30:35] weekend and cooking and cleaning and
[30:36] washing and helping and you know what I
[30:38] mean sister Mama Angie she was right
[30:41] there with him and and so you know
[30:44] sometimes we have late nights and then
[30:46] that Sunday morning hits and the coffee
[30:47] just don't
[30:50] help right but but whether we're
[30:53] fighting in here or maybe where God has
[30:56] us so hedged off that we're just
[30:59] feeding right like last weekend it was
[31:02] so good Saturday night brother brother
[31:05] alist preaching and I was just so locked
[31:07] in my wife she I was super quiet if
[31:10] y'all didn't know my my my wife said
[31:12] thought he must be tired no I I was just
[31:16] so locked in I forgot to say
[31:24] Amen brother Brian about halfway through
[31:26] the service I realized I'm not saying
[31:31] amen but but I was just so locked in and
[31:35] so God sometimes gives us those moments
[31:38] where every distraction is cut off and
[31:41] it's just it's just the Lord in you and
[31:44] and and it's and it's powerful right and
[31:46] then other times you're the one thinking
[31:48] man everybody's getting something but
[31:52] me right but but you may be the one
[31:55] holding the sword that's fighting off
[31:57] all the other demon so your brother and
[31:58] your sister three rows back can get
[32:01] something if we would take that kind of
[32:03] approach not a defeated approach but an
[32:06] approach that I'm fighting for this I'm
[32:09] at my post of
[32:11] [Music]
[32:13] Duty you may you may be quiet as a mouse
[32:17] but you're at your post of
[32:19] Duty it it's not about how loud we can
[32:22] be look look when when brother Brenham
[32:25] said the devil ain't death the the devil
[32:28] look the devil
[32:31] ain't the devil ain't scared of how loud
[32:34] we can be but one thing that terrifies
[32:37] him is when we have
[32:39] faith that's that's that's when he
[32:41] realizes oh hey hey this guy's something
[32:44] different this sister's something
[32:47] different right but so so when we're in
[32:51] this battle in this thing called life
[32:53] brother Brenham tells us uh he says he
[32:56] says if I have found Grace in your sight
[32:58] through God you take my word on this
[33:01] Brethren if you want to be a blessing
[33:03] and get a blessing when a man has done
[33:07] you wrong and he is absolutely justly I
[33:11] mean he has done you wrong and you know
[33:15] that he's done you wrong he's done you
[33:19] evil oh
[33:24] my y'all going to need to delete that
[33:26] Facebook app
[33:31] don't mention that amen don't have no
[33:35] veiled you
[33:37] know statement on
[33:40] Facebook don't mention that you take him
[33:44] to prayer before God Amen and don't take
[33:48] it in a way of just a selfish and say
[33:51] well I'm supposed to do this but notice
[33:55] what he says but stand with your your
[33:58] shoulder to his shoulder
[34:02] amen and stand in the presence of God
[34:05] our Father way of prayer should be made
[34:09] in the presence of God say father he's
[34:11] my brother and he is justly he deserves
[34:17] punishment because he's done me evil and
[34:20] I don't see why he did
[34:22] it then let God go to talking to you
[34:33] and you'll see maybe what that's man's
[34:36] been
[34:37] through the devil has Twisted him up
[34:41] somewhere and caused him to do that
[34:45] though he's absolutely wrong before you
[34:49] leave the Throne of God you'll be
[34:51] feeling
[34:53] sorry for that man
[34:58] but but I wonder how
[35:00] often do we apply
[35:03] that
[35:06] true now I I no doubt
[35:10] guarantee that before I read this quote
[35:12] you knew where I was
[35:16] going heard the quote
[35:18] before but here's the thing how many
[35:22] times have we applied that
[35:25] quote since you knew it before
[35:30] see because a lot of times when the
[35:31] preacher is preaching you know the
[35:32] quotes we we all we we we've been in
[35:35] here 30 you so many times and and that's
[35:39] good to have those things down but is it
[35:44] applied when we're on the
[35:46] battlefield the last time somebody done
[35:49] you wrong did you in your mind take that
[35:54] quote and pull that sister shoulder
[35:58] toosh
[35:59] shoulder right
[36:02] yeah did you take that family member and
[36:06] pull him or her shoulder to shoulder
[36:11] when you was in the prayer
[36:13] closet and did you pray
[36:19] until
[36:22] until God started talking to
[36:25] you it's not just you
[36:28] look the Jesus is not a
[36:31] priest Catholic yeah it's not just
[36:34] confession and say a few obedience and
[36:37] help no you go to prayer and then you
[36:44] wait I wish I didn't delete that slide
[36:47] of that pin
[36:51] wheel but but we live in lady
[36:55] OA and we live in this age
[36:58] technology where everything is so
[37:03] fast but if we would apply this quote in
[37:06] a way I I I dare say it would transform
[37:11] not only your life but the lives of
[37:13] those around
[37:16] you because you know when somebody does
[37:18] you wrong it's not just you think about
[37:21] this how many times does God allow us to
[37:24] hurt one
[37:26] another amen
[37:29] so that not only do you learn but the
[37:32] person
[37:33] learns cuz all things will work out for
[37:37] good and so and so when when you wrong
[37:40] somebody that person has to deal with
[37:43] the pain of whatever was done wrong to
[37:46] them whether misunderstood or misjudged
[37:50] or whatever it may be you you didn't do
[37:53] nothing wrong but then you have to deal
[37:56] with that but then that person that done
[37:59] the wrong if they're a real Christian
[38:01] then they have to deal with that and so
[38:04] God works on both ends because he's
[38:07] molding in making us everything works
[38:11] out for his
[38:14] good
[38:18] sir he says you'll be
[38:22] sympathizing with that
[38:24] brother and when you get bed down to
[38:27] Earth again you'll go over to that
[38:30] brother and shake his hand cuz you know
[38:33] that he's what he's been through you
[38:36] can't stand with a mortal in the
[38:38] presence of God and
[38:45] condemn anybody that's
[38:50] right now I
[38:52] know I know that's a hard statement
[39:00] cuz some of us didn't live a sheltered
[39:07] life but God's word is still
[39:11] true no matter how B life you have had
[39:16] amen that's the whole point of being a
[39:20] Christian brother I you know when I
[39:27] I share I share things in my life not
[39:30] because I need
[39:33] material we got the whole message for
[39:35] that I mean I could just read quote
[39:38] after quote after quote but but to me I
[39:40] listen to what brother brandham says and
[39:42] he shares his life experiences and it
[39:44] helps
[39:46] me right cuz he's so transparent and so
[39:50] honest yeah and and and so to me even
[39:53] brother Chad coming back and me being
[39:56] here this past year brother Chad
[39:58] is you know he shared so many uh
[40:01] personal things and his faults and
[40:02] failures and it's like it is it is
[40:05] absolutely transform me as a person
[40:09] because because my pastor can be free
[40:11] and at Liberty to say I'm a human being
[40:16] then it gives me the courage to go oh
[40:19] yeah he's a human I am
[40:21] too right right and and and and so the
[40:25] whole thing of it is is then because
[40:27] remember if it was all about being
[40:29] perfect then Gabriel himself would come
[40:31] here this
[40:33] morning right right but Gabriel can't
[40:36] relate to you like brother Gabe
[40:41] can and and that ain't it's just God
[40:45] chose Fallen man that's right to
[40:48] minister his word but that Fallen man
[40:51] has to be honest of his Fallen condition
[40:55] and and and not be worried about pride
[40:57] and arrogancy and trying to be something
[41:00] that is not we all need the blood of
[41:03] Jesus Christ whether you lived a
[41:05] sheltered life your whole life and you
[41:07] you you can't relate to you know worldly
[41:10] things and and and and you stay close to
[41:13] Mama and Daddy and all those things but
[41:15] still in that your your Battle Is
[41:22] self-righteousness Right your battle
[41:25] your battle is is even though you were
[41:28] sheltered that you don't get a Hardy
[41:30] Spirit on you right and and think that
[41:34] you're just a little bit
[41:38] better oh my where's brother
[41:43] Ben huh yeah right and so and so and and
[41:47] so look I I'll say this this is a tough
[41:50] one look if if if you can go if you walk
[41:53] into Walmart and now all of a sudden you
[41:55] want to roll your cart in the seat of to
[41:57] the
[42:00] scornful which there's
[42:02] [Applause]
[42:10] much or or or or or if you think that
[42:13] you're just too high class you go to
[42:15] Myer
[42:21] [Laughter]
[42:28] hey now don't get me wrong now listen
[42:30] hey wifey now she don't go to Walmart
[42:33] like past 2:00 in the afternoon you know
[42:35] there's only a little window where it's
[42:40] safe right
[42:44] right but the point of it is when when
[42:47] we're in those when we're in
[42:50] those
[42:54] situations you ought to look at that
[42:56] person and see a Soul yes sir
[43:01] amen cuz if it wasn't for the grace of
[43:03] God you would be right beside
[43:07] them right you you know sometimes you
[43:11] you look and say oh they're all drugs
[43:13] and Dr the people listen do you know
[43:15] that's the only pleasure that they
[43:17] have
[43:21] amen they don't have the ears that you
[43:23] have to
[43:25] hear the gospel
[43:28] amen and if we would look at them people
[43:32] cuz you never know maybe their name is
[43:34] on the
[43:37] book because brother brandham says he
[43:40] says you can't stand with a
[43:43] mortal that's not just members of our
[43:47] assembly
[43:49] moral blanket
[43:51] statement right you can't stand in the
[43:55] presence uh stand in a in a with a
[43:58] mortal in the presence of God and
[44:00] condemn anybody I don't believe no sir
[44:02] even if he is a
[44:05] rank
[44:09] Sinner and what about a brother that has
[44:11] made a mistake though I say he's wrong
[44:14] sometimes he's accused wrong when he's
[44:21] not but if he is wrong well if we take
[44:25] him to the throne of God
[44:27] stand there shoulder to- shoulder with
[44:29] our brother knowing he's IM mortal and
[44:32] maybe his destination rest upon our
[44:44] attitude our
[44:47] attitude yes sir our
[44:52] co-workers that one that rubs you the
[44:54] wrong way
[44:57] but
[44:58] maybe
[45:00] their
[45:01] destination rest upon our attitude
[45:05] remember those people are in your life
[45:08] for
[45:12] purpose but but but if we ain't careful
[45:15] remember we don't want to insulate
[45:19] ourselves but we have to make
[45:22] contact but you say brother Gabe there's
[45:25] heartache that goes with it I know
[45:28] but that's the whole
[45:29] point if you are The Mercy Seat why
[45:32] would you hide the
[45:37] mercy then mercy has to be
[45:42] given and that requires you opening
[45:45] yourself and making yourself
[45:50] vulnerable which is not easy but if we
[45:54] look higher then we will realize and if
[45:58] we're in the presence of God then we'll
[46:01] realize maybe their Eternal
[46:04] destination rest upon my
[46:09] attitude how I interact with them look
[46:13] you know you know you know you know you
[46:15] know sometimes we can say well they were
[46:17] good to me
[46:21] because but if you walk through life
[46:25] every time somebody does good and the
[46:27] first thing you think
[46:30] well come on Friends the the Way Up Is
[46:35] Down you say Brother G I know it's true
[46:38] I know that that's what the prophet of
[46:39] God taught us those that are good to the
[46:42] bride look that's why I
[46:44] say you got to be careful how you
[46:46] interact with that person cuz because
[46:49] the way you interact and you just fet
[46:51] them with the message they may have been
[46:54] good to you but your attitude to them
[46:55] makes them lose their
[46:58] opportunity at an entrance into heaven
[47:01] to be granted eternal
[47:04] life well they had it but they lost it
[47:07] because of your yeah my yeah
[47:14] attitude see it it goes both
[47:18] ways we can look at ourselves but think
[47:20] of the
[47:22] responsibility that we actually are
[47:24] possessors of that when we interact with
[47:28] people not just our assembly but every
[47:32] person when we're at the gas
[47:36] pump where when we're at the drive-thru
[47:38] and they get our order
[47:44] wrong that's when long suffering ought
[47:46] to shine
[47:49] forth when when you're at the
[47:52] restaurant you know what kills
[47:55] me is is
[47:57] is when Christians soon as they're there
[48:02] they they they start looking for
[48:04] opportunities to take away a
[48:08] tip that's
[48:11] shameful absolutely
[48:17] shameful you got pride in your life you
[48:19] try to justify to keep on hold of that
[48:21] money but let me ask you how many times
[48:24] did you go to work and give 100%
[48:27] yeah how many times did you go to work
[48:29] and give 30% did you go to your boss and
[48:31] go hey um you know today I know you paid
[48:34] me for eight but can you just put down
[48:42] two
[48:48] oh yeah see what I'm saying see it's all
[48:52] about the way we appro some of y'all
[48:54] didn't like that to
[48:57] I don't
[48:58] care it's the truth
[49:00] anyhow look hey now you understand what
[49:03] I'm saying I mean my whole point is
[49:06] friends I used to work at a restaurant
[49:08] and you know what when the Christians
[49:09] would come into the to the restaurant
[49:11] all the waitresses and waiters
[49:15] go you know why cuz they' stay forever
[49:19] and they never would
[49:22] tip it's true
[49:26] yeah I used I used to work at Applebees
[49:30] and every Sunday night everybody would
[49:33] complain waiters oh man the Christians
[49:37] oh you know they're going to Fellowship
[49:40] [Music]
[49:44] forever but what did the prophet
[49:49] do remember that that that waitress had
[49:52] a bad day brother brandham gave her
[49:54] extra large tip
[49:57] what he say he had discernment right I'm
[50:00] I'm I just this story comes to my mind
[50:02] but he knew that she had a bad day so
[50:05] you know what I do when I go to a
[50:06] restaurant I always try to make up for
[50:08] the person that didn't
[50:12] tip cuz I don't have that kind of
[50:14] discernment but when I go there I think
[50:16] Lord how many times did I loaf on a job
[50:19] amen how many times did I not give 100%
[50:22] right how many times did I do what I
[50:25] shouldn't be doing
[50:27] and found ways to not do what I should
[50:28] have been
[50:30] doing right but the thing of it is is
[50:33] you got to look across that person and
[50:36] realize maybe they had the worst day of
[50:39] their life oh yeah or maybe a childhood
[50:43] memory just came up and smacked them in
[50:45] the
[50:45] face from something for 30 years
[50:48] ago and you got a face that looks just
[50:51] like the person that hurt him
[50:58] now your attitude can either change them
[51:02] to the good or to the
[51:07] bad see cuz remember we're human beings
[51:10] and we we see things and you know
[51:15] uh sometimes we can look at people and
[51:17] just because they resemble somebody that
[51:18] hurt you in the past you'll treat them
[51:25] different but we have to be mindful of
[51:28] that we have to be mindful of our
[51:30] frailties and our
[51:33] shortcomings
[51:36] and is this okay it's all right you know
[51:40] because being on the battlefield is not
[51:43] easy and when
[51:46] I think
[51:49] of the Saints of
[51:52] old you know we go through schools of
[51:55] suffering for purpose and it's to give
[51:58] us uh a
[52:00] feeling one for the
[52:04] other and it's already
[52:09] 11:40
[52:11] well so so
[52:14] um I
[52:17] uh you know you think about the children
[52:20] of
[52:21] Israel
[52:24] and they went through some hard times in
[52:28] life
[52:30] and the Bible tells us in numbers
[52:33] 14 but your little ones which ye said
[52:37] should be a prey them will I bring in
[52:39] and they shall know the land which you
[52:42] despise but as for you your carcasses
[52:45] shall fall in the wilderness and your
[52:47] children shall wander in the wilderness
[52:49] 40 years and bear your whoredoms until
[52:52] your carcasses be wasted in the
[52:55] wilderness and so there was a a whole
[53:00] generation of young people that had to
[53:03] suffer for the mistakes of a previous
[53:08] generation and unfortunate as it may be
[53:13] um we we uh have to deal with those same
[53:18] mistakes of our
[53:20] forefathers and and and and it happens
[53:22] regardless but you know there came a
[53:25] time uh uh for that uh Next Generation
[53:30] to come up that was actually going to
[53:31] come in and possess the land right and
[53:35] and so they were going to come to um The
[53:39] Plains of Moab and and and Jericho was
[53:43] was the city that they would that they
[53:45] would uh come to and the walls would
[53:47] come we all know the story but but I I
[53:50] want to take you to a spot um where um
[53:55] there was hor that was being committed
[53:58] uh in the camp and uh you know um uh if
[54:04] we could go there it be numbers
[54:06] 25 and uh this is uh where where you
[54:10] have uh uh balum and Moab and all of
[54:14] them uh coming and trying to infiltrate
[54:18] uh the camp of Israel and um um and the
[54:23] the the whoredoms that they committed
[54:25] with the daughters of Moab and uh Israel
[54:28] joining himself unto B peor and the
[54:31] anger of the Lord being kindled and in
[54:34] in numbers 25 and I I'm sure you you you
[54:38] know the story that um they uh the
[54:41] children of Israel were weeping before
[54:44] the the door of the Tabernacle the
[54:47] Tabernacle of the congregation and there
[54:49] was a a uh uh the Next Generation by the
[54:54] by that came up that stood up for
[54:56] amongst the the those that were weeping
[54:59] and his name was uh Phineas uh the son
[55:03] of uh El Eleazar the the son of Aaron
[55:06] the priest and uh his grandpa was Aaron
[55:10] uh and and had and he uh he was zealous
[55:13] uh for God and and the Bible says in in
[55:16] numbers 25 and verse 7 and when finus
[55:20] the son of alos elazar the son of Aaron
[55:24] the priest Sol it he rose up from among
[55:27] the congregation and took a javel in his
[55:30] hand and and he went after the men of
[55:32] Israel into a tent and he th both of
[55:35] them through the man of Israel and the
[55:37] woman through her belly so the plague
[55:40] was stayed from the children of Israel
[55:42] and those that died in the plague were
[55:44] 20 and 4,000 and the Lord spake unto
[55:47] Moses
[55:49] saying now I I want you to pay attention
[55:52] to what he tells him cuz Phineas gets a
[55:57] thus saith the Lord from the
[56:08] prophet he says Phineas the son of
[56:10] elazar the son of Aaron the priest hath
[56:13] turned my wrath away from the children
[56:16] of Israel while he was zealous for my
[56:19] sake among them that I consume not the
[56:22] children of Israel in my jealousy
[56:25] wherefore say behold I give unto him my
[56:30] Covenant of
[56:32] peace and he shall have it and his seat
[56:36] after him even the Covenant of an
[56:39] everlasting priesthood because he was
[56:42] zealous for his God and made an
[56:44] atonement for the children of Israel now
[56:48] I I want you to think if you had the
[56:52] prophet of God after you stood up and
[56:56] and did something that was heroic that
[57:00] that was as we would call it in the uh
[57:03] you know in in a kind of a um
[57:07] terminology it was a game
[57:10] Cher right it it was it was something
[57:14] that that stayed the plague and the hand
[57:16] of God stopped doing what he was going
[57:18] to
[57:19] do and then God tells the prophet tells
[57:22] you you have my not not somebody else's
[57:27] you have my Covenant of
[57:31] peace now I want you to
[57:37] think after that
[57:40] happens how light and fancy free would
[57:45] you
[57:47] be can you imagine if you had William
[57:51] Marian
[57:53] brandham come to you after you done
[57:56] something
[57:58] heroic and say thus saith the
[58:03] Lord John
[58:06] Brooks you have my Covenant of
[58:14] Peace
[58:16] wow
[58:19] wow
[58:21] now I don't know about you
[58:30] brother
[58:31] Franco
[58:33] hey I think brother Phineas had it had
[58:35] it coined before I
[58:37] did after that Covenant of Peace oh
[58:42] my all he could see was baby blue
[58:45] skies and white puffy
[58:49] clouds no doubt it was going to be a
[58:52] brother Phineas day every day yes of his
[59:05] life
[59:10] but
[59:14] but you know what
[59:18] happens in numbers 31
[59:26] after this was
[59:28] stayed the plague was stayed and God
[59:32] gives him a covenant of Peace God tells
[59:35] the prophet I want you to number a
[59:38] thousand out of every tribe and go to
[59:42] war with
[59:46] Moab and in numbers
[59:49] 316 Moses sent them to war a thousand of
[59:54] every tribe
[1:00:03] them
[1:00:06] what how how how did his heart
[1:00:12] sink no that he said you got 12,000 why
[1:00:15] you need me I I got the
[1:00:18] hey I got the Covenant of peace
[1:00:26] but the Bible specifically says take
[1:00:29] 12,000 them and Phineas this is the very
[1:00:34] next time he has spoken of in the Bible
[1:00:37] after God gives him the Covenant of
[1:00:40] peace and
[1:00:42] immediately he sends him to
[1:00:49] war
[1:00:51] brother oh preach brother Paul preach
[1:00:55] brother Paul
[1:00:56] Amen
[1:00:58] brother
[1:01:00] amen see but Phineas has to be in the
[1:01:06] Bible because as I said at the
[1:01:10] beginning we come to this Christian
[1:01:14] walk and and we lay aside our burdens of
[1:01:17] the
[1:01:21] world and in our minds we're expecting
[1:01:23] baby blue skies that's right in white
[1:01:26] puffy
[1:01:27] clouds because of that one service where
[1:01:30] we know God gave us the Covenant the
[1:01:34] promise of
[1:01:36] Peace
[1:01:40] amen and then the very next day he sends
[1:01:42] us the war
[1:01:46] sir you know this wasn't there wasn't
[1:01:48] but a few more days and that Prophet
[1:01:51] that told him he has the Covenant of
[1:01:54] peace that prophet would be taken off
[1:01:56] the scene right how many
[1:02:00] days did he
[1:02:02] Wonder
[1:02:04] Man are you sure he said
[1:02:12] that same way we
[1:02:16] do was it just a was it just a good
[1:02:19] service that I
[1:02:23] had what what why am I in this
[1:02:28] battle I
[1:02:35] thought yes that's the problem you
[1:02:40] thought brother Gabe thought right yeah
[1:02:45] and so that's why we have to take God's
[1:02:48] word because his thoughts are higher
[1:02:51] than our
[1:02:53] thoughts and his ways am are higher than
[1:02:57] our ways his ways are past finding
[1:03:03] out but he puts people like
[1:03:07] Phineas in the Holy
[1:03:10] script so that when we go through these
[1:03:13] things because remember brother Brenham
[1:03:15] says you got to go find your character
[1:03:18] in The
[1:03:22] Bible and so the brother brandham could
[1:03:24] pick Elijah and John the Baptist right
[1:03:27] that's right mine's the thief on the
[1:03:30] cross
[1:03:31] Phineas but I found who I
[1:03:34] am and you have to find who you
[1:03:38] are you have to be able to identify and
[1:03:41] find your spot in God's word that's
[1:03:44] that's the importance of this holy
[1:03:46] script is that when we go through life
[1:03:49] we look at these characters and we go
[1:03:50] wait a minute
[1:03:53] Mama that's me
[1:03:56] yes
[1:03:57] sir right amen yes sir Phineas is a
[1:04:03] reflection cuz remember we're Kings and
[1:04:07] Priests right he was third
[1:04:12] generation Aaron was his
[1:04:15] grandpa no doubt had all kind of Stories
[1:04:18] of the prophet and in the Inner
[1:04:22] Circle and the prophet gave him had thus
[1:04:25] sayith the Lord Lord over his life
[1:04:28] right but if we really look at
[1:04:32] it if we go
[1:04:35] back let me ask you who is really fit to
[1:04:40] go on the
[1:04:47] battlefield yeah it's not the old
[1:04:50] Fighters brother Paul that's right
[1:04:52] they're not fit to go on the battlefield
[1:04:55] right but God was picking a
[1:04:58] Phineas because in order for us to fight
[1:05:02] the good fight of faith we must be
[1:05:06] possessors of the Covenant of
[1:05:09] peace right there has to be a a
[1:05:11] quietness and a peace on the inside amen
[1:05:15] there has to be a confidence and
[1:05:17] assurance that I have passed from Death
[1:05:21] unto life and and I have to be confident
[1:05:25] in my
[1:05:27] testimony and whether I I I see eye to
[1:05:30] eye with somebody else that if something
[1:05:33] raises up in you and you want to check
[1:05:35] that's right
[1:05:38] amen and I'm sure we've all at some
[1:05:41] point in
[1:05:42] time been there but once we've been on
[1:05:45] the battlefield a few times we ought to
[1:05:47] learn for that and go wait a minute that
[1:05:49] don't
[1:05:51] work and then we ought to walk with
[1:05:54] reverence and humil humity going God I I
[1:05:57] I don't want to
[1:05:59] misstep I don't care who they are I I
[1:06:02] don't want my my face to pop up on their
[1:06:05] screen at the white Throne judgment in a
[1:06:06] negative way amen right I I I want it to
[1:06:10] be all positive that I was the one there
[1:06:13] longsuffering for him I was the one
[1:06:17] there interceding for him I was the one
[1:06:19] that had the outstretched arm I was the
[1:06:22] one that was fighting for them
[1:06:30] amen and if we are not possessors of
[1:06:34] that then we need to go back and say God
[1:06:37] wait a minute I got too much fight in
[1:06:41] me I got too much criticalness in me
[1:06:45] that I need the peace that passes all
[1:06:49] understanding when you have the peace
[1:06:51] that passes all understanding look I can
[1:06:53] be just I can be just as happy with
[1:06:58] brother Alister preaching a three-part
[1:07:00] series that was
[1:07:03] mindblowing and then brother Gabe just
[1:07:05] preaches a brother Phineas Day
[1:07:08] message I am just as happy in that
[1:07:11] because I am not trying to be anybody
[1:07:15] else but what God has called me to
[1:07:19] be you because too many times we try to
[1:07:23] be something that we think we're
[1:07:24] supposed to be right we have to have
[1:07:27] confidence that I am what God has called
[1:07:29] me to be and rest in
[1:07:33] that right but you have to be
[1:07:36] comfortable with being
[1:07:41] you too many times we're worried about
[1:07:44] what we're supposed to be for everybody
[1:07:48] else and we're trying to please
[1:07:50] everybody else and
[1:07:52] listen all that is is is is you trying
[1:07:55] to put you know peacock feathers in a in
[1:07:59] a just be yourself am God Made You
[1:08:06] unique and and he made you to be
[1:08:10] you but you have to rest in that right
[1:08:15] you have to have confidence in that that
[1:08:18] I I am not trying to be any and I'm not
[1:08:21] trying to put on airs any I want to be
[1:08:24] whatever God God put all this in so that
[1:08:27] I can make that right kind of a
[1:08:32] thing and when you realize you're the
[1:08:35] only one that can make that
[1:08:37] team that's right no matter how big or
[1:08:40] little it may be that's the thing that
[1:08:44] the symphony needs amen and the symphony
[1:08:47] is not is not complete without that
[1:08:50] little
[1:08:54] thing but then we have to rest in that
[1:08:57] amen you know I I think of uh uh brother
[1:09:01] Rabbi brother brother Bram called him
[1:09:02] Rabbi
[1:09:04] lawon brother B they talk about Rabbi
[1:09:06] Lawson he said he had a Toral shell
[1:09:08] glasses and he said all he' do is he'd
[1:09:10] study all the time and he said he said
[1:09:12] brother Rabbi he said Rabbi lawon he
[1:09:14] said he didn't have no big charges but
[1:09:16] he was faithful with what God had given
[1:09:19] him and and and he says he says but he
[1:09:22] had a wife that uh he said he used used
[1:09:25] to study all the time and and his wife
[1:09:27] got angry one time and took his Bible
[1:09:28] and threw it in the fire in in a stove
[1:09:31] and burnt it up and uh brother brandom
[1:09:34] said I think uh I think she got caught
[1:09:36] up in some Christmas tree lights or
[1:09:38] something and burned up and died and you
[1:09:40] know what that Prophet says he says
[1:09:42] touch not my
[1:09:44] anointed and do my prophets no
[1:09:48] harm see cuz Rabbi Lawson didn't have a
[1:09:51] great big charge but the whole point was
[1:09:53] he was faithful to the charge that God
[1:09:55] given
[1:09:56] him that's what made the difference and
[1:10:00] and and the whole I believe the whole
[1:10:02] point of it is is friends can't
[1:10:04] everybody be a
[1:10:06] general and can't everybody be a
[1:10:09] sergeant but you have to be content on
[1:10:11] being a foot
[1:10:13] soldier you have to be content on just
[1:10:16] somebody that that blocks and keeps keep
[1:10:18] that keeps keeps the man that's got the
[1:10:20] ball in his hand and right amen but the
[1:10:24] thing of it is is is because we're bride
[1:10:27] we get it misplaced look them foot
[1:10:29] soldiers is just as much Bride As the
[1:10:36] general but you have to be confident in
[1:10:39] what foot soldier God called you to
[1:10:42] be it it may just be a housewife but
[1:10:45] praise the Lord be the best housewife
[1:10:47] that it can
[1:10:49] be and then when you see your little
[1:10:51] soldiers go off and they grow up and man
[1:10:54] and you see the fact that they didn't go
[1:10:56] out into the world God they ain't all
[1:10:59] cut up and scarred up you know why cuz
[1:11:02] you was faithful to the lot that God has
[1:11:05] given you the the portion that was given
[1:11:09] you and and and if we would be mindful
[1:11:12] of that you know because when they came
[1:11:14] into the promised land God said I'm
[1:11:17] going to give it to you by
[1:11:20] lot but when they came to that River
[1:11:24] Jordan
[1:11:26] there was there was Ruben Gad and the
[1:11:29] half tribe of anasse that they was not
[1:11:32] content with the lot that God was going
[1:11:35] to Grant to
[1:11:38] them and you know the Bible says that
[1:11:42] that they um they came to to to to the
[1:11:47] River Jordan and they they they told him
[1:11:50] they said
[1:11:52] listen if if you can look at that map
[1:11:56] you you
[1:11:57] look Reuben and Gad they were supposed
[1:12:00] to go across to the promised
[1:12:04] land but but the Bible
[1:12:08] says that they came to the prophet and
[1:12:10] they go look this land over here in the
[1:12:13] plains of Moab is a good is a land
[1:12:16] that's good for cattle right and what we
[1:12:19] want to do is we're going to go across
[1:12:21] Jordan and fight for you we're going to
[1:12:23] get the land possessed but then we want
[1:12:25] to come back over here right cuz this is
[1:12:29] a land that's good for cattle right
[1:12:31] brother brandham called him
[1:12:34] borderline they would they would they
[1:12:36] would C you imagine this they would
[1:12:37] cross over Jordan taste the good of the
[1:12:40] land fight for it but then they would
[1:12:44] cross back over and go no because it was
[1:12:47] a carnal good you know they instead of
[1:12:50] taking the unconditional
[1:12:53] Covenant amen they took the they made a
[1:12:56] conditional Covenant with the
[1:12:58] prophet that's right yes I I I was
[1:13:02] talking to brother Chad last night and
[1:13:04] and uh brother Chad told me about how to
[1:13:07] fit he he said he said you know he said
[1:13:09] Ruben Gad and the half tribe of NASA
[1:13:11] they were the
[1:13:17] firstborn and what is the firstborn
[1:13:19] that's our that's
[1:13:21] us that's the Flesh and that's that's
[1:13:25] what we fight against we want conditions
[1:13:29] that's right right well I'll do this if
[1:13:31] you do that and
[1:13:35] you friend we have to be content with
[1:13:37] the portion that's lotted to
[1:13:40] us matter of fact the prophet of God
[1:13:43] said this the the prophet of God said
[1:13:50] um if I can find it
[1:13:58] yeah brother Bon says and he got this
[1:14:01] from his father-in-law when he when he
[1:14:03] married uh hope uh he says happiness
[1:14:08] does not consist of how much of the
[1:14:10] world's Goods you
[1:14:12] own but how contented you are with the
[1:14:14] portion that's allotted to you that's
[1:14:18] right remember
[1:14:21] that you know contentment is priceless
[1:14:29] when when you find contentment if you
[1:14:33] are really content in life not that we
[1:14:35] get complacent but if we're content in
[1:14:37] life it's the greatest feeling in the
[1:14:40] world to where you don't have to be in
[1:14:43] the rat race of yes sir lady osia sir
[1:14:48] but you're just at
[1:14:50] rest and and when we can find that type
[1:14:53] of Happiness to just be
[1:14:57] content God has me right where he wants
[1:15:06] me but if we're looking at our
[1:15:10] neighbor and we're looking at brother so
[1:15:12] and so sister so and so we're never
[1:15:13] going to be at
[1:15:16] peace you you know you know Phineas when
[1:15:19] when he was when he was uh fighting
[1:15:22] against
[1:15:23] Moab you know that's not the end of the
[1:15:27] story cuz when Reuben Gad and the half
[1:15:30] tribe of anasse rose
[1:15:32] up guess who was in the middle of
[1:15:37] it
[1:15:39] Phineas and and and and if you read and
[1:15:42] I know it's getting late if you read
[1:15:44] phineas's life uh and we won't hit all
[1:15:48] of this but but in your in your studies
[1:15:52] if you look at
[1:15:53] Phineas it went from
[1:15:56] Moab to his own
[1:16:00] family his is the
[1:16:04] Israelites so his so his battles
[1:16:07] intensified that's right and it got
[1:16:10] closer to
[1:16:13] home so it went from Moab somebody way
[1:16:16] out yonder balum you know denominational
[1:16:19] brother Brenham said that was
[1:16:20] denominational but now the battle is
[1:16:23] even closer because Reuben Gad and the
[1:16:26] half tribe look it it's split of tribe
[1:16:29] half tribe what do you mean half tribe
[1:16:31] where's that where is that in that's not
[1:16:33] God's
[1:16:34] family right but the River Jordan
[1:16:37] separated them and and and Phineus is
[1:16:41] Right smack dab in the middle of it
[1:16:44] because he's the one that has to go to
[1:16:46] him and go hey hey what's going on here
[1:16:48] and they're like oh no no no no we'll
[1:16:50] we'll we we'll go fight for you we we'll
[1:16:52] we'll we'll fight we'll possess the land
[1:16:54] and we'll come back and all those
[1:16:55] different things and and uh and and then
[1:17:00] and and so he was the one in the middle
[1:17:03] of it and once they did the agreement
[1:17:06] that they would fight and then go
[1:17:08] possess on the other side then Phineas
[1:17:10] said okay and and and and and and the
[1:17:13] prophet was in the middle and the
[1:17:14] prophet of God said it was okay and so
[1:17:17] they went and fought they were right
[1:17:20] smack he was right smack dab in the
[1:17:23] middle of it amen right but let me ask
[1:17:26] you who would have been better equipped
[1:17:30] to handle that
[1:17:32] confrontation in the house of God than
[1:17:39] Phineas because Phineus had the Covenant
[1:17:41] of
[1:17:43] Peace that's what made him fit to to be
[1:17:46] able to be a
[1:17:49] mediator and and when we are truly
[1:17:51] possessors of the peace that passes all
[1:17:54] understanding
[1:17:55] that gives us a heart to be able to be
[1:17:58] in the middle of Confrontation amongst
[1:18:01] our families whether it be natural or
[1:18:04] spiritual because it gives us a depth
[1:18:08] and it gives us a
[1:18:12] heart I got three people that got a
[1:18:18] heart come on now
[1:18:21] right if if if that is not our motive
[1:18:25] and objective cuz what is it about is it
[1:18:27] about to kill and steal and divide and
[1:18:29] conquer no it's about
[1:18:32] peace it's about
[1:18:35] rest it's not about to me BRS I I don't
[1:18:40] believe I don't believe that this is the
[1:18:43] hour it is the greatest battle ever
[1:18:45] fought in the mind that's true enough
[1:18:47] but in the midst of all of it I'm still
[1:18:49] at
[1:18:51] rest I I I'm
[1:18:56] by God's grace I humbly say that he he
[1:19:00] he's done something for me that I
[1:19:01] couldn't I couldn't do for
[1:19:03] myself amise
[1:19:06] God and and when you when you look and
[1:19:09] you see the hand of God in your
[1:19:12] life it it does something for you and it
[1:19:15] does something to
[1:19:18] you so when I see somebody that's in in
[1:19:22] drama or in pain
[1:19:25] it's not a seat of the scornful cuz I
[1:19:28] look at that person I go I was there at
[1:19:30] one point in
[1:19:31] time I've been there I've done that I've
[1:19:34] been down that
[1:19:36] road but but if you don't have a feeling
[1:19:40] one for the
[1:19:44] other don't don't let the trials of Life
[1:19:48] make you bitter that's
[1:19:51] right and I'm not talking about just to
[1:19:54] the gray car now I'm talking about you
[1:19:56] youngsters
[1:19:58] too because sometimes things can happen
[1:20:01] to us and if and if you let it it'll
[1:20:04] make you hard yeah it'll make you bitter
[1:20:07] it'll make you
[1:20:08] sour and you may be in your
[1:20:12] 20s
[1:20:14] listen life may have took taken terms
[1:20:17] that you didn't
[1:20:20] expect but that's when you have to rest
[1:20:23] that he knew those turns before you made
[1:20:27] them and that's the whole point of being
[1:20:29] a Christian well you say brother Gabe
[1:20:32] I'm not where I want to be well yeah
[1:20:34] that may be true but God has got you
[1:20:37] there for a purpose
[1:20:45] am God had Phineas there for a
[1:20:50] purpose
[1:20:52] and you know when you know the the
[1:20:54] amazing thing of Ruben Gad and the half
[1:20:56] tribe of
[1:20:58] anasse
[1:20:59] [Music]
[1:21:01] is it's
[1:21:03] so
[1:21:06] um overwhelming to me that when they
[1:21:10] cross you know that the River Jordan
[1:21:12] open up just like the Red
[1:21:15] Sea
[1:21:17] right and those uh hundreds of thousands
[1:21:22] of people walked across on dry land
[1:21:26] when it was the wetest
[1:21:30] season God supernaturally dried
[1:21:33] up that River
[1:21:36] bed and and they they they put they God
[1:21:40] told him take take 12 Stones and put
[1:21:43] them on the other side Reuben gadam
[1:21:46] manasse had a stone over on the other
[1:21:49] side of Jordan with their name on
[1:21:51] it and when they went back and possessed
[1:21:53] in the plains and Moab those stones
[1:21:56] didn't go with them they stayed over
[1:21:59] there what is what and it and and it's
[1:22:01] so amazing to me their confession was to
[1:22:04] be over there but they chose to be over
[1:22:07] there that's right friends you you we
[1:22:11] all are at that same spot that we can
[1:22:15] choose we can choose to be bitter or we
[1:22:18] can choose to say I am
[1:22:21] not
[1:22:23] amen you know uh uh sister Wendy uh gave
[1:22:26] me gave my wife and I a little a little
[1:22:29] picture uh in uh Wendy chain and she
[1:22:32] said uh and it says happiness is a
[1:22:37] choice it's right on the manle the
[1:22:41] fireplace love that because it's so
[1:22:44] true happiness is a choice and if you
[1:22:49] want to choose to be bitter it is your
[1:22:51] choice you say you say I've had a hard
[1:22:53] life well I I have two afterward
[1:22:56] afterwards we go set out in the vestib
[1:22:58] and we can compare and see who's the
[1:23:00] [Music]
[1:23:02] worst I guarantee I'm going to be a top
[1:23:10] five but but am I going to Relish in
[1:23:13] that no I'm choosing
[1:23:18] happiness I'm choosing to break the
[1:23:22] Cycles it's my choice God gave it to me
[1:23:27] God gave me this open
[1:23:29] book you you think about this when when
[1:23:33] when when the children of Israel when
[1:23:34] they when they
[1:23:37] got when when they they had they had a
[1:23:42] stone with their name on
[1:23:50] it that they were going to go into their
[1:23:54] in
[1:23:57] inheritance and they chose to go back
[1:24:00] you know they even had a stone placed in
[1:24:02] the in the River
[1:24:04] Jordan for a
[1:24:06] memorial right and it and and here's
[1:24:09] here's the beautiful thing it wasn't
[1:24:12] Ruben and manasse and all of them that
[1:24:13] put the stone in the River Jordan it was
[1:24:17] Joshua who is
[1:24:19] Joshua thank you yes so it was it wasn't
[1:24:23] just them doing this it was God doing it
[1:24:26] for a memorial that it wasn't just you
[1:24:28] it was
[1:24:30] me amen and and and and and when they
[1:24:33] got that they had a
[1:24:35] stone oh my god look they received a new
[1:24:40] stone that's right
[1:24:44] amen
[1:24:47] and what did God promise
[1:24:51] US he said I'll give you a new stone
[1:24:55] am with a name written on it that no man
[1:24:59] knows saying him that receiveth it and
[1:25:02] I'll give to you of the Hidden
[1:25:04] Mana
[1:25:06] is when we come to that that is our
[1:25:10] inheritance that is our adoption when we
[1:25:13] are placed in the
[1:25:15] land and and when we receive that look
[1:25:18] we what did Brother Brenham tell brother
[1:25:20] Benham told us he said he said he said
[1:25:22] uh uh he says
[1:25:24] you remember it was the pyramid where
[1:25:27] the mysterious White Rock was written on
[1:25:30] and the angels took me into that pyramid
[1:25:32] of themselves the mysteries of God known
[1:25:35] only to them that Prophet took that
[1:25:39] Pride bar and RI the lid off of
[1:25:42] that yes sir and what did he reveal my
[1:25:46] name your
[1:25:49] name he gave you a new name what that
[1:25:54] you are not the the the product of your
[1:25:56] mom and dad but you are the bride the
[1:26:00] mystical bride of Jesus
[1:26:05] Christ that's what it's all
[1:26:09] about
[1:26:10] amen he gives us a new name he changes
[1:26:15] us and he says I'll give of you the
[1:26:18] hidden
[1:26:20] manner what what is the hidden
[1:26:23] manner what is the hidden
[1:26:29] Manor that's where the bedroom
[1:26:37] is it wasn't the Mana that fell every
[1:26:40] day when when they
[1:26:43] went on the other side the Mana
[1:26:47] ceased but the hidden Mana continued
[1:26:50] on and every high priest right every
[1:26:55] priest had a right to take a handful of
[1:26:59] that hidden Mana that's right and it
[1:27:01] would supernaturally grow back
[1:27:05] afterwards and the Bible says sister
[1:27:08] that ye are a
[1:27:11] priest and you have just as much right
[1:27:14] to the hidden manner as brother Emmanuel
[1:27:18] brother Chad brother Ben brother you
[1:27:21] have just as much right sir because you
[1:27:24] are living the life of righteousness
[1:27:27] amen that's what
[1:27:30] get when what what what does brother
[1:27:33] brandham tell us when when they see that
[1:27:36] new name look they went up in they
[1:27:39] brother Bram said he went up in that
[1:27:40] pyramid and brother brandom says it it
[1:27:42] was the it was those angels had the the
[1:27:46] interpretation of that white stone that
[1:27:48] was the
[1:27:50] pyramid
[1:27:52] right those angels gave him the what was
[1:27:56] inside of that pyramid right yes sir it
[1:27:59] was once hidden but then it was
[1:28:02] revealed right what are we eating
[1:28:06] upon
[1:28:08] amen right and and and
[1:28:11] because brother benam tells us this you
[1:28:14] say well how do I know I I I I have a
[1:28:17] new name or how do I know my name's on
[1:28:19] the book brother benam tells us the
[1:28:21] reason why you know he says is it true
[1:28:24] that every Jew born since Christ that
[1:28:27] come into the world is to be saved he
[1:28:29] says no nothing will be saved only those
[1:28:32] whose names were put on the Lamb's Book
[1:28:34] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:28:35] world Jew or Gentile see that's all the
[1:28:38] book holds that mystery and the book is
[1:28:41] only unfolding it now not each one's
[1:28:44] name but the mystery of the book while
[1:28:47] it's
[1:28:49] calling those names you find you
[1:28:52] understand that now see the book does
[1:28:54] not say now Lil is to be saved in this
[1:28:56] time of the church age or Orman whoever
[1:28:59] it don't say Susan Smith or uh John
[1:29:02] Brooks right right no it says it says no
[1:29:07] he says it don't say that it just shows
[1:29:09] the
[1:29:10] mystery praise God Amen right unfolds
[1:29:13] the mystery of what the thing is
[1:29:17] but Emmanuel saasu John
[1:29:21] SM right put your name in there
[1:29:25] yeah don't you stop at Isaiah 53 put
[1:29:29] your name in there but we ourselves by
[1:29:33] faith believe
[1:29:35] it how do I know how how do you know it
[1:29:39] says I I'll give you to eat of the the
[1:29:41] the the hidden mana and I'll give you a
[1:29:44] white stone yes sir but but if if you
[1:29:47] take that uh Stone and and you go back
[1:29:50] to the original Hebrew it goes back to
[1:29:53] the uh ancient days of the law that when
[1:29:56] somebody was in a trial if they were
[1:29:58] condemned they would get a Blackstone if
[1:29:59] they were if they were uh uh uh uh found
[1:30:02] not guilty they were given a white
[1:30:09] stone so so when we receive this message
[1:30:13] and we are we are I'm not talking about
[1:30:15] here friends I'm talking about when it
[1:30:17] becomes real to you that that nobody sh
[1:30:20] I don't care what negative things say
[1:30:21] about brother Brown they say what they
[1:30:22] want to brother I I've done went too far
[1:30:25] I don't care I'm not look I am not
[1:30:27] looking for a perfect Prophet cuz I've
[1:30:30] already found
[1:30:35] one look I'm not looking for a perfect
[1:30:40] Pastor cuz I found
[1:30:43] one right you understand what I'm
[1:30:45] saying we're dealing with we are all
[1:30:48] human beings can brother Brandon be a
[1:30:50] human being yes sir let me ask you
[1:30:52] something you the majority of your life
[1:30:55] in another world and then come back here
[1:30:56] and see how good your memory
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:02] is people sit in the seated the scornful
[1:31:05] you brother benam talked about how he
[1:31:07] said when he was on on the platform it
[1:31:08] was a minor to what he did when he was
[1:31:10] out on that's why he had to go out in in
[1:31:12] the woods in the mountains where there
[1:31:14] was no souls so nobody would pull on
[1:31:17] that gift because it was so sensitive he
[1:31:19] would go into another
[1:31:21] world and and then remember he would say
[1:31:24] he'd say you don't know how it is he
[1:31:25] said he'd look is this a vision is this
[1:31:27] a
[1:31:28] v yeah amen he he would walk through
[1:31:32] life and remember when that brother had
[1:31:33] the eye problem and he's like brother
[1:31:34] brandom uh uh you see Vision he's like
[1:31:37] yeah brother but you know I I try to get
[1:31:38] a away out here not to get away from
[1:31:40] those he's like oh I'm sorry and then
[1:31:42] boom it was that
[1:31:45] easy yeah yeah now you have that kind of
[1:31:48] a gift in your
[1:31:50] life now let I want you to recall what
[1:31:52] happened 20 years ago
[1:31:54] yeah right and I want to verbatim
[1:32:02] yeah and then I want you to go around
[1:32:04] the world preaching to thousands of
[1:32:05] people and don't you tell that story
[1:32:08] wrong yeah right I want you to say it
[1:32:10] the same way oh no no you don't have no
[1:32:13] iPad no you got a notebook but don't you
[1:32:16] make a mistake
[1:32:20] yeah amen prise God you say you say oh
[1:32:25] in the in the critics that say oh you
[1:32:27] just trying to protect him I don't need
[1:32:30] to protect brother
[1:32:32] B thank you brother matter of fact he's
[1:32:34] protecting me that's why God sent him to
[1:32:40] me that's what the protection of this
[1:32:42] message is look you but I don't know
[1:32:45] about you brother but when that sister
[1:32:47] stood up for that Prophet God that angel
[1:32:49] of the Lord came through the uh
[1:32:50] neighborhood and brought healing that's
[1:32:52] right I want to be that I want to be
[1:32:54] that kind of person that I stand for
[1:32:57] this gospel and then the angel comes
[1:32:59] down and sweeps through and brings
[1:33:00] healing in my home I tell you what if we
[1:33:03] stood up and we defended not to fight
[1:33:05] not to be critical but to stand for
[1:33:08] [Applause]
[1:33:13] truth I'm sorry I don't mean
[1:33:17] toess Lord I I just to me look I love
[1:33:22] this I all I can tell tell you is I know
[1:33:24] what I
[1:33:25] was I know what I was and I know how
[1:33:29] many times I pushed this message
[1:33:33] away and I know that I couldn't push it
[1:33:36] away it wouldn't leave
[1:33:40] me so so I all I can tell you is is how
[1:33:45] real it is to
[1:33:46] me and and and and I don't have well I
[1:33:49] know you can be dumb and not and be
[1:33:51] intellectual but I I I I
[1:33:55] I don't
[1:33:56] know I don't think I'm intellectual how
[1:33:58] about
[1:33:59] that but but but but but the thing of it
[1:34:02] is friends when when when you see the
[1:34:06] gospel unfold to you in a
[1:34:09] way I don't know brother Chad when I was
[1:34:11] was talking about there it's like
[1:34:12] everywhere you look it's it's the
[1:34:14] message I mean everywhere I mean it is
[1:34:18] just look brother brandham gave us the
[1:34:21] principles of the Gospel and it applies
[1:34:24] in every story every every every law
[1:34:30] every every precept I mean it's
[1:34:33] everywhere and it's not something that
[1:34:35] you got to try like remember when you
[1:34:37] was little and you'd have to take the B
[1:34:38] the little the little Cube and try to
[1:34:40] put it in and it ain't like you trying
[1:34:42] to have a circle and you trying to push
[1:34:44] that square in there no it's a it's a
[1:34:46] circle and It just fits right in there
[1:34:50] and you're just like my look at that and
[1:34:53] you pick up a star and
[1:34:57] whoa
[1:34:59] right you don't have to try it it does
[1:35:01] it
[1:35:03] itself but I but I but I think if we
[1:35:06] would stop trying to
[1:35:13] defend all I want to do is
[1:35:17] rest you and I you you you and
[1:35:24] sometime I got to figure out a way to
[1:35:25] stick to about 30
[1:35:27] slides you pray for me pick the right
[1:35:36] 30 but but here's the thing here here's
[1:35:39] some I want I want to just I want to I
[1:35:41] want to show show this cuz there there's
[1:35:43] a there's a second there's a third
[1:35:46] battle that
[1:35:48] um there's a third battle that Phineas
[1:35:51] goes through
[1:35:53] and
[1:35:57] um and it's in
[1:36:00] judges
[1:36:02] um and and it's an easy search you just
[1:36:06] take Finas and running through the
[1:36:07] scriptures it'll it'll so bless you it
[1:36:10] blessed me it was so beautiful to me
[1:36:12] but not going into the background but
[1:36:14] there's another fight amongst the the
[1:36:16] children of Israel and there was a there
[1:36:20] was some whoredoms committed and a with
[1:36:22] a concubine and they cut up in 12 pieces
[1:36:24] and sent it to the 12 tribes and
[1:36:26] Benjamin was in the middle of it and and
[1:36:29] so Phineas this is the third time he's
[1:36:32] spoken of in the scriptures and and now
[1:36:35] it's even closer to home cuz it's just
[1:36:38] one part of the
[1:36:40] [Music]
[1:36:41] church and and he goes up against
[1:36:44] Benjamin and and they and they there's
[1:36:47] several that die and and he has to
[1:36:50] recalculate and and he's like whoa whoa
[1:36:52] what's going on and and so they come to
[1:36:54] to judges 20:27 and the children of
[1:36:57] Israel inquired of the Lord for the Ark
[1:36:59] of the Covenant of God was there in
[1:37:01] those days and Phineas the son of el
[1:37:04] elazar the son of Aaron stood before it
[1:37:06] in those days saying shall I yet again
[1:37:09] go out to battle against the children of
[1:37:15] Benjamin
[1:37:18] yeah now I don't know about
[1:37:21] you but when I read that
[1:37:24] I see the heartache of a
[1:37:29] veteran because this is the third battle
[1:37:32] that he's in the midst of in the
[1:37:33] scripture third time he's spoken of and
[1:37:37] when he's he he he's seen loss on both
[1:37:40] sides he's seen right and wrong and then
[1:37:43] there's still confusion in the camp and
[1:37:45] he goes Lord he doesn't he doesn't
[1:37:48] approach Benjamin as somebody that don't
[1:37:50] have no no connection to him yeah right
[1:37:54] amen but when he goes before the Ark of
[1:37:58] he's not bless God I'm the high priest
[1:37:59] and I'm the anointed man of the hour and
[1:38:01] I got to hear thumbed them and
[1:38:03] yeah
[1:38:06] no but he says but he says
[1:38:10] Lord my brother
[1:38:13] Benjamin
[1:38:15] Benjamin my
[1:38:22] brother and I think we can learn a lot
[1:38:24] from
[1:38:27] Phineas because all of
[1:38:31] us are on a battlefield of some sort
[1:38:34] that's
[1:38:36] right but it's not just being in the
[1:38:40] fight but it's how are we fighting the
[1:38:47] fight God called us to fight the good
[1:38:49] fight of
[1:38:51] faith and in order to do that that that
[1:38:53] takes communion with the almighty
[1:38:56] amen and you say brother Gabe you know
[1:38:59] but but God just I'm praying and I'm not
[1:39:02] getting and and I'm struggling I don't
[1:39:04] know the answers well listen do you know
[1:39:07] I I love this you know brother bam said
[1:39:11] the almighty means that shadaa right the
[1:39:13] breasted one
[1:39:14] amen it's another easy search but if you
[1:39:17] type in that word a shi it comes up like
[1:39:20] 60 some odd times in the Old Testament
[1:39:24] but out of those 60 times do you know
[1:39:26] who says it
[1:39:27] overwhelmingly calls God
[1:39:30] elshad is
[1:39:34] job job's like 26 times out of the 60
[1:39:38] and nobody even comes close uh as far as
[1:39:42] not even double digits like three four
[1:39:46] times so what does that tell
[1:39:49] us when God seemed the farthest away
[1:39:53] yeah he called him M Shad out the
[1:39:59] most it was when it's the
[1:40:02] darkest he said you're my strength
[1:40:05] Giver see he he wasn't referring to him
[1:40:08] as you know
[1:40:10] Elohim way out yonder and all no no no
[1:40:14] no no when he needed him the most he
[1:40:18] called him the the name that would put
[1:40:20] him the closest to him right
[1:40:24] that's right
[1:40:26] wooo and it takes Faith to do that that
[1:40:30] when everything fell apart in job's
[1:40:34] life see because God he he uses his his
[1:40:38] name he's not just God object of worship
[1:40:42] and and he's not just Elohim
[1:40:44] self-existent one and he's not just
[1:40:47] Savior and he's not just Master but no
[1:40:51] but he's also
[1:40:54] the
[1:40:55] friend
[1:40:59] amen he's the friend that sticks as
[1:41:01] closer than a brother amen but he also

[1:42:46] differently cuz if it wasn't for the
[1:42:48] grace of God that would be
[1:42:51] you unless you think there something you
[1:42:53] did to keep yourself
[1:42:57] clean no and we all had to come our way

[1:43:38] sir right
[1:43:42] true maybe we ought to be just content
[1:43:45] with what God has given
[1:43:48] us contentment is priceless but if we're
[1:43:52] looking at everybody else you know we we
[1:43:53] live in an hour where everything's
[1:43:56] connected and as as a musicians the
[1:43:58] musicians if you would come please
[1:44:01] brother Chad um you know we live in an
[1:44:04] hour where everything is just so
[1:44:08] um we're so
[1:44:11] connected but we're so connected we're
[1:44:17] disconnected
[1:44:19] right and and and we're we've got so
[1:44:22] many things going on on us right and we
[1:44:24] have so many
[1:44:26] um channels
[1:44:29] open whether it be uh family and work
[1:44:33] and then we got social media and you
[1:44:37] know we by the time you trying to keep
[1:44:39] up with the man all I had was Facebook
[1:44:41] and I I got to the place where it's like
[1:44:44] I ain't got time I mean I don't know how
[1:44:47] y'all do Instagram and gramming I I
[1:44:50] ain't never had time to do no gramming
[1:44:54] how you gram you got time to gram
[1:44:59] man see we we got all these different
[1:45:02] and and what what all they do they all
[1:45:04] say the same thing why would you have to
[1:45:05] sign up with Facebook
[1:45:08] Instagram
[1:45:13] Snapchat y'all act like oh I don't know
[1:45:15] brother G I don't know any other social
[1:45:17] media you're all like quietly on the
[1:45:20] inside you're like this what this this
[1:45:25] but you know you know what I had to
[1:45:28] do I had to delete that thing am cuz I
[1:45:32] realized it was taking up too much of my
[1:45:34] time that's
[1:45:36] right it you get so connected to that
[1:45:40] other
[1:45:42] world like brother aliser
[1:45:45] preached you get so connected brother
[1:45:47] you play something soft you get so
[1:45:50] connected to this to the to that other
[1:45:53] the
[1:45:54] world that we lose
[1:45:57] connection with each
[1:46:00] [Music]
[1:46:02] other we don't have time to put our
[1:46:05] shoulders together in the presence of
[1:46:09] [Music]
[1:46:12] God cuz we're too busy
[1:46:15] graming we're too worried about this
[1:46:18] church over here and that church over
[1:46:19] there and the seeing how popular we are
[1:46:25] how many followers we God and we
[1:46:28] be you you know you know we we live in a
[1:46:32] brother Bon said we live in a neurotic
[1:46:34] age what would he say
[1:46:36] now brother I don't know about you I
[1:46:38] don't want no followers I didn't like
[1:46:41] that I'm thinking
[1:46:43] oo don't follow me I mean man like
[1:46:46] Facebook I think oh I got followers
[1:46:49] [Laughter]
[1:46:53] can't we call it something
[1:46:56] else but what does that
[1:46:59] do
[1:47:03] unconsciously I hit a
[1:47:07] thousand and then these young people
[1:47:09] grow up when
[1:47:10] they only got
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:15] 10 now we laugh and Chuckles old but you
[1:47:18] young people you're like
[1:47:19] yeah and then we base how popular we are
[1:47:24] on how many followers we
[1:47:26] have and then our life becomes a
[1:47:30] mirage because the more crazy the more
[1:47:32] Antics we do the more funny whatever the
[1:47:35] more followers we
[1:47:37] get and then we're not trying to be
[1:47:40] ourselves we're trying to be something
[1:47:43] that's going to
[1:47:44] draw
[1:47:46] followers and we're so busy trying to
[1:47:49] bring followers to us
[1:47:53] that I wonder do we forget to follow
[1:47:57] [Music]
[1:47:59] him how many followers does Jesus have
[1:48:02] on his Facebook
[1:48:04] account is it m and Taylor
[1:48:08] Swift who has
[1:48:10] more I'm talking about genuine
[1:48:14] [Music]
[1:48:16] followers we can get so caught up you
[1:48:19] know you know there's you know there's a
[1:48:21] a a terminology now called a micro
[1:48:25] celebrity you know what a micro
[1:48:27] celebrity is a micro celebrity is
[1:48:31] somebody that's a celebrity but only in
[1:48:34] a selected little
[1:48:36] group so say say you're in the Motocross
[1:48:39] and you uh you you're a real good
[1:48:43] motorcycle and you do Motocross Crossing
[1:48:46] Motors whatever that is right so you can
[1:48:49] cross in Motors good well you you're the
[1:48:52] best Crossing of Motors there is and so
[1:48:55] you are going to be a micro celebrity in
[1:48:59] that Motocross
[1:49:01] world and everybody that's in the
[1:49:04] Motocross is going to know your
[1:49:07] name because you're the
[1:49:11] best and so Satan has so designed it
[1:49:14] where he don't even have to have
[1:49:16] Hollywood anymore
[1:49:23] he he has our phones that we have
[1:49:25] attached to us and and you say brother
[1:49:27] gab I'm not in the Motocross but what
[1:49:31] about our little niche yes
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:37] sir and then we and I and then we can
[1:49:44] become popular you know you know you
[1:49:47] know you know brother B talks about
[1:49:50] Ministry preachers he always says
[1:49:52] there's three things right money women
[1:49:56] and that's the one never nobody ever
[1:49:59] talks
[1:50:00] about right money in women is easy to
[1:50:02] catch right but it's that old
[1:50:10] popularity and now in this Dynamic that
[1:50:14] we live in where it's it's all
[1:50:17] about uh being known and but but I
[1:50:21] thought the way up was down
[1:50:23] right
[1:50:25] amen I thought it was about how little
[1:50:27] we can get so that Christ could be
[1:50:29] projected in
[1:50:31] us I thought it was about us dying out
[1:50:33] to self so that when they saw you they
[1:50:37] saw
[1:50:38] Jesus not your
[1:50:41] [Music]
[1:50:46] family brother G I can't suck the double
[1:50:49] 10 in
[1:50:52] [Music]

[1:50:57] talking about making the fishy face oh
[1:51:00] my goodness what in the world we got
[1:51:02] messy Believers making fishy faces
[1:51:05] for brother that
[1:51:07] ain't like that s hello Dr Brum he said
[1:51:12] get that hand down here and shake that
[1:51:15] hand right he said I ain't no doctor if
[1:51:19] you love me call me brother
[1:51:22] and if we're supposed to be on this
[1:51:24] battlefield called of of of lady
[1:51:28] oia I I don't know about you I I I want
[1:51:30] to die I want to die I don't want
[1:51:33] brother Gabe to be
[1:51:35] seen I'm trying so bad to kill that man
[1:51:38] I want him
[1:51:40] dead right and and that when when my
[1:51:43] brothers when my co-workers whoever
[1:51:46] comes in in contact with me I want them
[1:51:49] to see the Lord Jesus to say this
[1:51:52] there's something different about
[1:51:55] [Music]
[1:51:56] him not not how much he knows and how
[1:51:59] you can W you in the scriptures
[1:52:02] no but when when they when they come
[1:52:05] across that Prophet there was something
[1:52:07] different about
[1:52:10] him when he when when he came back and
[1:52:13] to Jefferson Villa after he preached
[1:52:15] himself seals no doubt them people was
[1:52:18] like wow what's
[1:52:21] next you imagine they' be on the edge of
[1:52:23] the seats and then what does he
[1:52:27] do he preaches his
[1:52:33] complex standing in the
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:40] Gap look when when you when you think
[1:52:43] about brother brandham and his life that
[1:52:45] he
[1:52:48] lived you
[1:52:50] know we see the first second in third
[1:52:52] pool
[1:52:54] right brother Braham talked about this
[1:52:57] picture and and he you we always just
[1:53:00] want to see the three pools and the
[1:53:01] clouds and
[1:53:04] right but brother Chad said something a
[1:53:07] month or two ago brother brother Chad
[1:53:10] said brother brother Chad said that uh
[1:53:13] um he said when God put that mountain
[1:53:16] range there was highs and lows baked
[1:53:19] into them Hills amen
[1:53:23] [Music]
[1:53:25] see God knew every
[1:53:27] Valley right every flat spot brother
[1:53:29] Brown said when he looked at that he
[1:53:31] goes yeah he goes look into that the
[1:53:33] first and pool and he goes remember that
[1:53:34] flat spot he goes That's when uh I went
[1:53:36] off the
[1:53:38] field so that is his life played out in
[1:53:41] that mountain range God knew every
[1:53:44] Valley you would go through he knew
[1:53:47] every Flatline you would do he knew
[1:53:49] every Mountaintop you would be on every
[1:53:51] High spot spot every low spot every
[1:53:54] every doubt question fluster whatever it
[1:53:57] may be but once that prophet got to that
[1:54:01] third
[1:54:02] pool this is so beautiful to me after it
[1:54:06] came to the opening of the word what
[1:54:13] [Music]
[1:54:14] happened brother brandom
[1:54:17] decreased and the word
[1:54:20] increased that that mountain range
[1:54:22] doesn't keep going up but it goes
[1:54:26] down and if we really want to see the
[1:54:28] third pool do something for us what art
[1:54:31] our mountain range ought to look like
[1:54:34] people are looking for shouting and
[1:54:36] Supernaturals and all these things when
[1:54:39] you look at the manifestations of the
[1:54:41] third pool show me where it was some big
[1:54:44] show amen that's right it was a prophet
[1:54:48] of God sitting in a in a poor lady's
[1:54:50] house and she said the right words heard
[1:54:52] and and he said you say whatever you
[1:54:54] want it'll be given to you she didn't
[1:54:56] she didn't start thinking about 2024
[1:54:59] rollsroyce and mansions on the hill but
[1:55:02] she said the right thing again and she
[1:55:05] said the salvation of my two
[1:55:09] boys you look at all those those
[1:55:12] manifestations of that three pool it was
[1:55:15] always just a handful of people it
[1:55:18] wasn't in in random Tabernacle where
[1:55:19] those things was unfolding it wasn't
[1:55:21] when he was was in Los Angeles and down
[1:55:24] in Louisiana but what it was it was it
[1:55:27] was uh it was it was uh when sister me's
[1:55:30] on the table and he's not even in the
[1:55:31] room that's right amen yes
[1:55:34] sir all those things was not for public
[1:55:39] that's right display right it was the
[1:55:43] hidden life that's
[1:55:46] right friends you got people looking for
[1:55:49] something great out and and brother B
[1:55:51] says I wonder if the people are not
[1:55:52] sufficiently impressed with the word of
[1:55:55] God I wonder if we've lost our not I'm
[1:55:59] saying you understand what I'm saying
[1:56:01] people are looking for is that Elder is
[1:56:04] is that yes is it not
[1:56:12] enough I know it's enough for me I know
[1:56:16] what it's done for me I know what I was
[1:56:19] and I know what I am now and I know the
[1:56:21] reality of Jesus Christ and I see the
[1:56:24] resurrection in my
[1:56:27] [Music]
[1:56:30] life Hallelujah when we talk about the
[1:56:33] third pool what are we looking
[1:56:36] for look it God gave us a
[1:56:41] [Music]
[1:56:43] visual brother Braham said it goes off
[1:56:45] into the Continental Divide and off into
[1:56:48] eternity but but where is it going
[1:56:52] yeah but it has to be because the Bible
[1:56:55] says the way up is
[1:56:57] down right we say brother Gabe you
[1:57:00] talking about the Frozen chosen and it's
[1:57:01] SC no I believe in the
[1:57:05] Supernatural but I believe every day
[1:57:08] that we walk in this Christian walk and
[1:57:10] we're walking a rugged everyday
[1:57:14] life to me that's the
[1:57:17] supernatural that I have eyes to see and
[1:57:20] I can see Satan all of his
[1:57:23] tactics and that word comes forth in my
[1:57:26] life and there's a little buzzer that
[1:57:28] goes off and it says you need to repent
[1:57:31] you shouldn't have said it like that you
[1:57:35] wrong and I said yes Lord I'm so sorry
[1:57:38] and I go make that thing
[1:57:43] [Music]
[1:57:49] right I just love that mountain range
[1:57:54] yeah the Bible says brother Chad Isaiah
[1:57:59] 57:15 for thus sayith the high and lofty
[1:58:01] one that haveth
[1:58:04] eternity whose name is
[1:58:06] Holy I dwell in the high and holy place
[1:58:10] with him that is of a contrite and
[1:58:12] humble Spirit to revive the spirit of
[1:58:15] the humble and to revive the heart of
[1:58:18] the contrite ones he is the high
[1:58:22] and holy one but what does he inhabit
[1:58:25] it's somebody that's
[1:58:27] crushed it's somebody that has the
[1:58:30] heartache of a veteran that's been on
[1:58:33] the battlefield and is not trying to
[1:58:35] prove that their
[1:58:39] bride they just letting their life
[1:58:43] shine they just live in a calm and
[1:58:45] everyday life I love the Lord Jesus he's
[1:58:49] done so much for me and I and I'm hoping
[1:58:52] I can do something for one of his
[1:58:59] [Music]
[1:59:00] children I'm hoping if I can just do if
[1:59:03] Lord if I could help one of those
