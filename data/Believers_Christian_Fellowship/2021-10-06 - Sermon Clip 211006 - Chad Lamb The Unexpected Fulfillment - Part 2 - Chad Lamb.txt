TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and i saw when the lamb when the lamb i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see brother branham said in the sixth seal so now tonight we have assembled here to hear your word and as we have been studying in this certain person of the scripture that the lamb was the only one that could open the seals or to loose them who opened those seals why did he open those seals how do you know the seals were open because of the seven thunders when did you hear the seven thunders in those consecutive nights of services when he was given the revelation of the unwritten word what john was not allowed to write when he was given the revelation of the unwritten word it tied you right back to the silence from revelation chapter eight they're the same thing the revelation of the unwritten word is revealing what was done in that silence what was that silence it's his coming and i'll just ask you a couple questions are you married to the lamb is this the invisible union is the wedding here then he has to be here you can't marry somebody who's not present now is the bride pregnant with the word has he pregnanted somebody he's not married to can he marry somebody when he's not present can he pregnant somebody without being here see it's it's so simple we can walk right over the top of it because we have in our mind we're looking for the denominational picture of a giant image of jesus coming down and we all stretch our hands out and we all begin to float up to him but that's a denominational idea it's not it's not the scripture it's not what brother benham told us amen he don't look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest
