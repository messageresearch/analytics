[0:00] and god is the fountain of all grace and
[0:02] power
[0:03] and of all divine wisdom is in god so
[0:06] therefore knowing that he is the only
[0:09] creator there is there is no other
[0:11] creator but god satan cannot create it
[0:14] all he only perverts what's been created
[0:16] but god is the only creator
[0:19] so because satan
[0:22] because satan has his own agenda he has
[0:24] his own plan
[0:26] satan cannot create any material to work
[0:28] with so he can only take the material
[0:32] that god created and deform it or
[0:34] pervert it into another purpose amen and
[0:37] when he can get when he could get the
[0:38] children of god to leave the channel of
[0:41] the word all of a sudden they became
[0:43] deformed and all creation became
[0:44] deformed and that was his power because
[0:47] he can't create or make anything he can
[0:49] only take what god made and deform it he
[0:51] can't bring his own word he takes god's
[0:53] word and he deforms it
[0:55] he can't bring his own creation he takes
[0:57] god's creation and deforms it so he
[0:59] perverts or deforms so that is his job
[1:02] that is his power to deform so satan
[1:05] loses all of his power when we refuse to
[1:07] leave the word
[1:09] he the only power he has is the power to
[1:12] deform he cannot create amen he cannot
[1:16] he cannot overpower god's word god could
[1:19] satan could never come in the garden of
[1:21] eden and overpower god's word he could
[1:23] only get god's children to leave the
[1:26] word or deviate from the word and that's
[1:28] how he expressed his power to deform but
[1:31] satan could not do that they had to do
[1:34] that
[1:35] he influenced them he deceived them he
[1:38] tricked them but they're the ones who
[1:40] had to leave the word so so satan is not
[1:42] going to come in amen to us and all of a
[1:44] sudden twist us in the knots and deform
[1:46] us we will do that of our own choice if
[1:49] we're deceived into leaving the channel
[1:51] of the word then we become perverted
[1:54] or deformed
[1:56] so what is the solution where is our
[1:58] safety amen what will keep us
[2:00] the line of the word the channel of the
[2:02] word and that's why it's so important
[2:04] that the word was restored to us in this
[2:06] day
