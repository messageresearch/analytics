with the same thought from last sunday but this isn't really a part two it's just a little bit different we're going to go a little further and i would like to pick it up in genesis chapter one again like we did last week and kind of touch back on our foundation and move forward there i also want to remind you that this evening will be the communion and feet washing so if you want to come back for that that'd be wonderful and also um this wednesday we will start our tape service so we'll be starting uh with it is the rising of the sun there are books out on iraq here beside the welcome desk out here plenty of books so everybody can have one it's the message from april 18th the morning service from 1965 so if you want to use your tablet or your phone or or have your own book we'll be doing that starting this wednesday we'll probably go for three wednesdays is my guess but we'll just see how it goes as we get into it let's go ahead and turn to this scripture here and look at genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them let's turn over to chapter two and read one verse out of chapter two verse eighteen chapter two verse eighteen and the lord god said it is not good that man should be alone i will make him a help meet for him and that helped me really just means a helper genesis chapter 5 let's read genesis chapter 5 and verse 1. this is the book of the generations of adam and the day that god created man and the likeness of god made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created amen let's bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing lord jesus we thank you that we can be here and father we ask as we look to this word now lord that you would open it to us lord that you would open our eyes to see that you would rub the eye salve in our eyes that we might see this word and god we can be changed by it may we look into the mirror of the word and be changed into the likeness of what we see lord and god i pray that you would feed us now by your own hand speak to us lord the words of life god i pray you granted according to your preeminence in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated then for a title i'm i'm going to go a little bit different direction but i'd like to speak on a submissive queen with a humble heart and as we get into this i'm going to eventually get into esther and talk about that and there's just some things that really as i was meditating just it was a refreshing we preached on esther quite a bit we went into it for a little while a couple years ago but some of those things just came flooding back as we got into the subject and began to look at it but i want to i want to start with a quote here this is we read this last week this is part of our foundation still and out of questions and answers on genesis from 1953 the prophet of god said and then god taken from his side a piece of him a rib and made a woman now where did he get the spirit woman see genesis 1 26 he said let us make man in our image after our own likeness created he them male and female he made the burly spirit for the man he made the tender little delicate feminist spirit for the woman and when you see a woman acting like a man she's got out of her place in the beginning see all right i think it's a shame that women has lost their dainty feminist place it's a disgrace and then he says in the message he must be born again from 1958 he says therefore when a man tries to act like excuse me when a woman tries to act like a man dress like a man talk like a man she's out of her place a woman is feminist sweet loving not big and carrying on and acting like a man well she's not supposed to be and when she does that her life is perverted she's sweet loving kind where adam is more the burly type for he was the man the masculine type the woman was feminist but it's the same spirit for he took her from adam so this is the part that we talked about last time but i just want to refresh your memory that the spirit that was in the woman was not different than adam it was adam but when god that spirit that was in the woman was originally an adam and both masculine and feminist was in him amen and god had created him a son of god and within him was the help meet within him was the female spirit within him he was a complete unit but god said it is not good that he should dwell alone so this is all god's master plan in creating his masterpiece he said it's not good she should dwell alone so he pulled out of adam the feminist spirit and he took a rib from adam and he formed another vessel and he put that spirit in adam and now the only thing you can call that spirit is adam it is adam it is it is another expression of adam it is atom is part a part of adam what was originally an atom has been pulled out for another expression and that expression is called woman and that woman is given a name and that name is adam praise god but when brother brown describes it here he says the one that remained in adam was the burly was the masculine amen and that's and when god you know uh we'll say it this way god's the one who did the splitting when he split the spirit he split it the way he wanted it amen and when he wanted in one expression the burly the masculine and another expression he wanted the sweet the feminine the gentle and that's what god wanted amen and so the reason that this is so important to us is because the world we live in is so utterly perverted it is called good evil and evil good and is changing god's original plan and in changing god's original plan it always brings death it'll never bring life to change from god's original will bring death not life and when god made a woman he made her the way he wanted her amen because god was expressing something that was in his mind from before the foundational world something he wanted to express something he wanted to achieve something he wanted to have upon the earth and he was expressing it here in his first masterpiece and that masterpiece fell to ruin and we know how the masterpiece came into ruin it's it's because the the the devil now began to work through the serpent and the serpent began to seduce the woman and the woman when she acted independently of the male amen should begin to fall amen this is so important because it relates to us you know we were talked about last time a dominating female spirit and we said you can have a dominating female spirit and be a man because it's it's a approach it's an attitude amen it's the way uh it's the way you view things and the way you approach things amen there's a dominating female spirit because that dominating female spirit has been upon the churches for years and the churches traditionally have been run by men the men were the priests and the popes and the priests and the bishops and the overseers amen they were all run by men but yet the spirit on that church was a dominating female spirit a jezebel spirit so you can come under this dominating female spirit because the female was pulled out amen and she was supposed to be a helper to the man a minute when she came out to be a helper now she was no longer working in conjunction with the man when she began to work independent of the male amen she was beguiled she was deceived she moved off to her reasoning and thereby she fell amen and adam amen who has not beguiled was not deceived he was not deceived into transgression but he knew full well what was going on but he chose to leave amen the commandment of god to go and redeem and save his wife and he's foreshadowing what christ will do for us only christ never has to leave the word to redeem us so this is the what we talked about last time and we want to move on from there and what's so critical is because in the expression that you and i are in this day god has chosen to express himself in bright form and so it's feminine form it's female form and when we have to understand what god did and why god did it it helps us understand what is our role what are we supposed to be doing what's the objective today amen it's jesus christ it is jesus christ just like it was adam in the beginning but it's jesus christ now in the formation of his bride he was here in formation of bridegroom he was here the last adam amen to restore all that adam lost he was he proved that he was the faithful son amen and every other son before had failed to be a perfectly faithful son adam failed noah failed moses failed david failed amen they all failed to be a perfectly faithful son and they were all typing or shadowing jesus christ but when he came he came the last adam why does it say last adam it's a interesting terminology last adam amen because moses was going to portray adam but he failed so he couldn't restore noah all of these were trying to portray the faithful son amen but they all fell but there was one that would come that would not fall amen and it was god himself in the form of his son jesus christ and he could not fail he could not fall amen and he he lived the faithful son and it's amazing i'm repeating a lot from last week but i want this to stay fresh in our minds it's amazing to me he was emmanuel he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he said that my father and i are one but yet he would say the son doeth nothing but what do you see the father doeth and jesus says i can do nothing it's not he says it's not me it's the father in me that do it the works see he was emmanuel god made flesh but yet in his expression he was expressing son and the expression of son he had to be faithful and obedient and submissive amen in order to in order to reverse all that adam had lost he had to come to perfect faithfulness perfect submission perfect obedience to be the perfect son and so there had to be a relationship between father and son that would express son and in the in the portion of the message in the church age book where brother ben writes what he was told to write when he was told to pick up his pen and write the angel lord told him to pick up his pen and he began to write he said look at the relationship between jesus christ and the father the son and the father and he says that relationship is now to exist between the bride and groom so jesus amen although the father was in him he could not take the role of the father he had to play the role of the son and the bride now although the bridegroom is in her she cannot be the bridegroom she must be the bride when she tries to be the bridegroom she gets out of her place she takes the wrong spirit and she's going to bring failure and ruin to the plan of gone and to herself because she's here to express bride not bridegroom but the bridegroom's with her the bridegroom's in her just like it was emmanuel god was in jesus christ reconciling the world to himself but yet he had to be the faithful son he could not be the father he had to be the son and now the bride although it is the expression of the bridegroom all it is mrs jesus christ although it is the same spirit i mean it's life of his life bone of his bone spirit of his spirit she's here to express bride and if she fails that's where every church before us has failed the first church every church age has failed they failed to stay in the channel god put them in amen they wanted to become dominant they wanted to make their own way they wanted to make their own decisions amen and they left the headship of the word and began to take reasoning and began to take their own ideas and creeds and dogmas and wanted to make their own decisions and as soon as they did that church fell amen it would go into ruin and he would start with another one but there's a prophecy today that this bride won't fail she's predestinated not to how will she not fail it's not going to be by her brightness it's not going to be by her intellect it's not going to be because they've gathered together the best minds or the best of this or the best of that but she's not going to fail because god's put in her the right spirit and she will remain submissive to her head which is christ the word that's why i titled this the submissive queen because it's interesting when you start talking about queen and we're going to look at queen in the bible amen there's a there's an initial expression of exaltation the queen she's exalted above all the other women she's she's placed uh sharing the throne with her husband and all these other imageries and terminologies and thoughts we have about the queen but don't ever forget that the queen worships the king don't ever forget that the queen bows before the king that the queen prostrates herself before the king that the queen humbles herself before the king it doesn't matter how exalted queen is queen has never exalted over king still there's still a difference still a big difference this is where we have to remain because if the devil can't get you off on one side of the road he'll get you off from the other if he can't get you amen to to be a heathen he'll get you over in fanaticism and make you go too far it's true there's truth there the queen and the bride but he can get you to go too far to where you can become like the first church like the catholic church and said i said a queen and am no widow and shall need see no sorrow you don't even know that destruction is coming because you left the word how did she get there friends slowly by degrees by wrong attitudes and wrong thoughts and self-exaltation she didn't she didn't just arrive there she grew into that kind of notion where she could be naked miserable wretched blind and know it not what did she do somewhere along the line she left the headship of the word and when she left the headship of the word she began to make her own decisions and find her own way but still believed she was the bride of jesus christ still believed that she was the queen of heaven still believed that she was blessed and honored and exalted and didn't even know it that she was already rejected hallelujah sober isn't it i say god make me submissive make me humble lord let me lower myself and bow before you you are my god you are my king you are my husband you are the revealed word that has been given this hour to us and we subject ourselves to that in the thyatiran church age we read this also last sunday from the church age book i'm just going to read a few excerpts i'm not going to read the whole passage like i did last time but it said it is most worthy of note that the very name thyatira means dominating female thus this age is characterized by a dominant force a force that ruthlessly invades all conquers all despotically controls now a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world oh praise be to god you ought to be able to say amen to that amen it's what caused all of our problems amen further down says from the garden of eden onward women has constantly and successfully tried to take control over the man further down he says now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her women a woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real male makes a wife a doorman but she will but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that god made for her she is perverted and any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken that image and is perverted that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertaineth to a man or cut her hair she is never to wear garments that pertain to a male or cut her hair when she does she is intruding into the male domain taking authority and perverting herself and when a woman invades the pulpit which is commanded she must not do she shows that this she shows what spirit she's of being a dominating female is antichrist and the seeds of the roman catholic church is in her though she may deny this ever so vehemently but when it comes to the word let god be true in every man's word a lie further down in the same passage he says and that weakness in her allowed satan to seduce her by way of the serpent and has brought the woman to a very peculiar position before god in his word she is the type of all things vulgar foul and lowsome on the one hand and on the other hand she is the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy as a receptacle of the spirit and blessings of god on one hand she is called the who is drunk with the wine of her fornications on the other she is called the bride of christ on one hand she is called mystery babylon the abomination before god and on the other hand she is called new jerusalem our mother on the one hand she is so foul and wicked and lewd that she is similarly cast into the lake of fire as the only fit place for her and on the other hand she is exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of god as the only place befitting such a queen and in this thyatiran church age she is a dominating female she is mystery babylon she is the great she is jezebel the false prophetess why because the true female is submissive to god that's key why is she all this because the true female is submissive to god christ is her head she has no word but his no thoughts but his no leadership but his amen and i say lord that's the the kind of bride that i want to be amen and no matter how much we want it we always find self coming to the surface and all of these things in our carnality but what we desire more than anything is to be this submissive woman amen to be the perfect reflection of jesus christ reflecting back to him his own self in the image of female remember i said before when god separated out the woman he did not make a clone of the man although it was the same dna although it was the same spirit amen he did not make a clone he made a complimentary piece because if you made a clone you would see in anatomy and in makeup and physique and also in spirit you would see another male but that's not the masterpiece god was making the masterpiece god was making was to separate the female out of the male and bring a separate expression of female amen so when he made the same thing he made the same thing only with a different expression to be complementary and the two together make the masterpiece you can't have a masterpiece with one without the other it's an incomplete masterpiece amen until the bride comes out and is restored back to the bridegroom then the masterpiece is complete again amen and the bride cannot operate independent of her head ever ever ever she does she's moving into dangerous ground so when god wanted this expression he made it the way he wanted it and now god to restore his masterpiece has restored the bridegroom has restored the male in jesus christ in his earthly ministry he was the restoration of the faithful son he was the last adam there's no need for another one to try we've had the last adam now the bridegroom has come forth been expressed fulfilled his role done all that he was supposed to do and redeemed back all that the first one had lost but now he has to have a female to complete the masterpiece so god struck him in the side and he pulled out from under his rib water and blood and he began by the word and the spirit to make another amen what is he doing he's completing the masterpiece he's rebuilding what had fallen and he's making a another bride another wife another woman amen and what's he doing he's taking not a different spirit but the same spirit amen the spirit that was in jesus christ is now coming into the bride to be what amen life of his life bone of his bone flesh of his flesh but not a clone a complementary peace amen sometimes when when we hear what brother bannon's telling us it's there's a truth there's a truth it's jesus christ in the formation of a bride it's in every way the wheat restored again the wheat grain it's christ coming back it's the word come back amen but we realize it's got to match the picture of the first masterpiece it's not a clone we're not here to be the last adam that's fulfilled amen we are here to be the last woman the complementary piece that complements the bridegroom the bride and the bridegroom together make the masterpiece amen so sometimes we take these terms that brother broom gives we take them upon ourselves amen but we want and without meaning to we want to reflect the bridegroom and we're supposed to reflect the bride humble submissive reverent giving honor to her husband brother mam says in the message influence he said now notice secondly the two wings that cover their feet what did they mean humility before god in his presence these are the very these are the very uh cherubims that are in the heavens that are worshiping god brother of them said never sin never done wrong but with two wings they cover their feet humility two cup two wings they cover their faith in reverence and with two they fly they're in action amen and they've never done anything wrong but god is so holy that they have to reverence and humble him these beings have never sinned they've never done wrong but in the presence of god he is so holy they must reverence him and humble themselves before him and this is important because we we gave this a title amen the submissive queen with a humble heart because these things go together to have the right kind of expression he goes on to say that moses at the burning bush took off his shoes when he heard him say i am that i am paul on his road to damascus he fell on his face john when he saw the spirit of god above jesus he said i have need to be baptized of thee and why cometh thou to me here is a good example always be conscious of your littleness not your bigness praise god amen see if we don't understand the the way god is trying to express himself that through his attributes he wants a full expression of all that's in his attributes and and he wants the attributes to express the proper portion in the proper season because that's the proper display of who god is and and we we have a reality that it's not us it's god in us amen that if we ever were part of god we're always part of god and it's an attribute of god a portion of god part of god's life that he attributed to us so it is god it is god but we cannot act like god and if i say that i don't want to say that wrong but we cannot be the father that's where we came from is that who we are yes there's a portion of that in me what is in you god is that true yes but there's a certain attribute of god that he wants to spray and that attribute he wants me to splay he's not asking me to display father he's not asking me to display the the faithful son he's asking me to display the faithful wife and that's the expression of god he wants in this day and that expression of god just like when emmanuel came forth in the sign the son reverenced respected humbled and submitted himself to the expression of the father and if we had done any less he would have been wrong but now in the expression of the female and the expression of the bride and the expression of the female expression of jesus christ now in order to properly express god is not to take on another expression amen but to express the portion that he's allotted to be expressed in this day in this age and in you is it god yes it's god is it jesus christ yes it's jesus christ but if you express anything other than the expression he wants today you're going to be out of line with god's will so we have to stay in the channel amen stay in the channel of god's word in god's way always be conscious of your littleness not your bigness let's turn to proverbs 18 together there's several scriptures i want to read here together but we'll begin with proverbs the 18th chapter proverbs 18 and 12 before destruction the heart of man is haughty and before honor is humility this is a principle that will always remain true it will never change before uh sorry let me read this again before destruction the heart of man is haughty look at the revelations 18 when you see the false church the great she says i am a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow see she was coming to her destruction because in chapter 18 she sees her destruction right when she comes her destruction she expresses a holy spirit and before destruction is a man is haughty but before honor is humility just before honor comes there has to be humility haughtiness is pre as a prelude to destruction humility is a prelude to exaltation that principle will always remain true let's go to luke 14 and see how jesus says this luke chapter 14. luke chapter 14 and verse 7. yeah luke 14 7. and he put forth a parable to those who were bidden when he marked how they chose out the chief room saying unto them when thou art bitten of any man to a wedding sit not down in the highest room lest a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him and he that bade thee in and he that obeyed thee in him come and say to thee give this man place and now begin with shame to take the lowest room but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest room that when he he that bade thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go up higher then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at the meat with thee for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth self shall be exalted let's turn over to luke 18. luke 18 and verse 9. in luke 18 and verse 9 jesus he's going to begin to say another parable in verse 9 he says and he spake this parable into certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other republican the pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this republican i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess and the publicans standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes into heaven but smote upon his breath saying god be merciful to me a sinner. i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone that exalted himself shall be abased and he that humbled himself shall be exalted i'm just you see these attitudes all the time and sometimes these attitudes are bold and sometimes they're subtle but sometimes people individuals can take the title of bride and do such horrible things with it and be so arrogant so so arrogant and condescending and judgmental and critical to everyone around them because they're the bride and it's no different than a pharisee spirit but that's not the wife that god's looking for he's looking for a bride who's humble and sweet and gentle and submissive is that right i mean brother ben was such an example to us amen you never see him taking those attitudes at any time he briefly did in the pulpit god corrected him quickly and humbled him amen and so we can we can go one way or we can go the other way but god wants us right down the middle he wants to stay true to his word and he wants us to express the right portion and he wants us to always remember without him we can do nothing without him we are nothing without him without his anointing without inspiration that comes from him amen a preacher cannot even preach without the inspiration of the holy ghost amen it doesn't matter what kind of gift is in him but if he's got a true gift he waits for that inspiration and he's helpless without it amen had so many saturdays where i labor and labor and labor and read and read and read all friday all saturday and have no inspiration and it's not that there's nothing to preach there's sermons i mean sermons full of good food the bible's litter i mean literally full amen of the word of god amen but without inspiration you're helpless i called and talked to somebody one day i was in one of those positions i said pray for me he said what's going on i said the sales are up but there's no wind we're doing our part amen the sales are up amen amen we've got the rigging all in place we're all ready to sail but without the wind we can do nothing amen without the mail we can do nothing amen we need him we always need him every day of our lives we need him we will never be able to operate independently of him and he is the word that has been revealed to us in this day and we need it and we need to stay submissive to it and the message question from questions and answers from 1959 brother ben says it isn't that just the way that people get today let god just bless a fellow and put a little confidence in him and he gets to be a know-it-all he gets to be he's got to start an organization or he's got to do something that's different why art thou fallen from heaven or lucifer god has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that will stay humble and meek and stay in the place until god calls him to do something you believe that a man that god can bless and he'll still keep himself a man not be an angel or a god and as soon as a man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become a god he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person amen see what i do me and my me and mine all that that's the wrong attitude god's hunting for somebody who he could bless and pour out blessings and the more he blesses the littler that man will become and you'll never get more of god until you become nothing oh this is good friends you'll never get more of god until you become nothing you've got to be little yourself he that will exalt himself god will bring a base he that will humble himself god will exalt you've got to get little before you can get big and you'll never be big in your own self you'll only be as big as god will be big in you we need him i want to look at the apostle paul's attitude before i move on to the real meat of what i want to get to but let's turn to first timothy together first timothy first timothy chapter 1. first timothy 1 and we'll begin at 12. i think christ jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor an interest but i obtained mercy because i did it ignorantly and unbelief and the grace of our lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus this is a faithful saying and worthy of all exception acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of who i am chief how be it for this cause i obtain mercy for that in me first i for that in me first jesus christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should here after believe on him to life everlasting the apostle paul was not boasting of his goodness the apostle paul was saying jesus by his mercy he's enabled me to be a faithful minister that god has chosen me and and i and i i was a blasphemer and i did these things but i did it ignorantly and unbelievable amen but this is a faithful saying amen that jesus christ come to save sinners of whom i am chief and why did he do it he did it to show you the pattern so that you could be saved that's what he's saying so the apostle paul you know i'd like to read that part again how be it for this cause i obtain mercy for this reason i obtain mercy that in me first jesus christ might show forth all longsuffering for the for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life ever life everlasting so paul's not saying i did anything i'm nothing special he said i was wrong i was the chief of sinners but god showed mercy and he did this for this reason he showed mercy unto me to show his longsuffering as a pattern for you who would believe so if he can save me he can save you so paul was not you know paul was not exalted in himself but he realized the position god put him in and why and he realized that it was all by mercy and it was by grace go to first corinthians 15. first corinthians 15 and 9. first corinthians chapter 15 beginning in verse 9 for i am the least of the apostles and that i am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god paul is placing himself now now the apostle paul we know is the first church age messenger we know that he's a prophet that he is going to write the majority of the new testament we know this about paul so in our eyes paul is tremendous he was a tremendous gift to us and through that vessel god would give us his word and he would place much of the old testament into the new testament paul had a major position as he met the pillar of fire was called by christ himself amen and given instruction on the word he had a major position but paul in his own eyes was little paul said i am least of the apostles and not even worthy to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me the apostle paul won't take credit for nothing was he was he the prophet of the age yes was he predestinated that position yes was god working in and through him yes but in his own estimation he was little it was all he recognized it wasn't him it was god's grace it was god's mercy it was god he said no not in vain because i labored more than them but not me it was the grace that was in me he's always given credit to god listen to brother branham he does the exact same thing and the anointed ones at the end time so now i want you to know this is sure and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today that i was trying to say that about myself being that i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice was this the prophet of the age yes was it elohim working in flesh to demonstrate himself yes did he have more did he have more gifts and more manifestations than anything else we've ever seen absolutely but look at his attitude about himself this is what's so important friends it doesn't change who he is it doesn't change his position he's not denying that he's the seventh angel he's not denying that he's called of the lord a child of god with an attribute of god on the inside he's not denying all of that but he's putting himself in his proper place so that he can have the proper expression so that god is god and god is the one who's worshipped and god is the one who's praised he said you might have thought today that i was trying to say that about myself being that i was packing this message i have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment i wanted to be a trapper but it's the will of my father that i declared to do and determined to do i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfectly as perfect they are i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man brother venom he kept the pattern sure he kept the pattern true amen because every servant of god always points all praise worship acknowledgement back to god when jesus was here he was the son of god he's the messiah the anointed one god and flesh the fullness of the godhead god was in him reconciling the world and to himself and jesus christ is always saying i didn't do it it wasn't me it was the father i can do nothing of myself it's the father that doeth the works amen worship god well who was he god in flesh but what was he doing pointing back to the father amen and here we are in this day amen we're we are here expressing amen the very life that was in the bridegroom is now here the what was what was wheat has gone through the process and come back to wheat again it was the word there it's the word here it's the very life of jesus christ on display but in our expression what do we do we point back to our husband it's not me it's him it's not what i did it's what jesus christ did for me it's not me but it's his life through me it's not what i do it's not me it's not about me it's all about him amen why do you say that because every character in the bible did the same thing and when god was here in the form of jesus christ he took the same approach but the apostle paul took the same approach brother branham took the same approach and this bride is going to take the same approach she's not going to say i'm bright therefore i say therefore i do she says i'm nothing but he's everything and he's chosen me by his grace amen it's by his grace by his foreknowledge by his predestination not by my marriage not by my efforts not by my brightness not by my intellect i failed in all of that and i'm an utter failure and all of that amen but it's god who has chosen me it's god who is selected and it's god who's working through me if there's anything to be praised it's not me it's jesus christ it's my husband my bridegroom the true king but you're the queen yeah but i bow before the king see it's all about attitude there's a truth the truth is the bride is the expression of christ on earth she is the body of jesus christ the flesh of jesus christ collectively as a whole the bride on this earth now is the body of jesus christ she is but she's an expression and female and her attitude needs to remain true to the scriptural pattern and when that attitude begins to shift and arrogancy and pride begins to come in you know right there that satan is trying to push her a little too far because it's different than how everybody else acted in the bible and it's different than what we saw in the prophet in the message influence brother bennett said if you want to find how great you are put your finger down in a pool of water or a bucket of water then pull your finger out and try to find where you put your finger you're nothing listen i know brother branham also said you're the virtuous if you're standing with this word another with you're the virtuous sinless spotless bride of jesus christ that's true but this is also true they're both true and it has to do how it has to do with how you as an individual you view yourself and view god so where you put your finger you're nothing god can do without you now this is a major statement brother i'm saying this after the seals november of 1963 he said god can do without you he can do without me but we can't do without him we've got to have him for he is life and he alone now listen brother bam is expressing an attitude not a doctrine because doctrinally brother branham would say if you're an attribute of god god's not complete without you he does need you amen but brother branham is now coming back to you as a person in your flesh amen as a human being he's trying to get get us to stay in the right place in the right frame of mind with the right attitude yes god is not going to do without himself amen the attribute that he placed in your soul amen he is not going to live without that he needs that that's another expression of himself amen he is he is incomplete without you that is absolutely the truth but you have to realize that that's him and you amen that's a portion that he allotted to be the expression of you but it come from him he did it by his grace amen it's not you as a human being that did anything so that's why brother branham can say god can do without you you he can do without me really god could have done this without brother branham you see it's an attitude friends he's bringing us to the right attitude but we can't do without him we've got to have him for he is life and he alone not to know his book and not to know this or know that or know the creed but to know him as life know him as a person christ in you the word made flesh in you that's knowing him when he you and he become becomes one like i said last night in the super sign he has got to come in you god and man must come one and you're conscious of your littleness because it's all him it's not me it's him in me i want to go to revelation chapter 3. i want to read two passages there and then we're going to go to the book of esther revelations chapter 3 verse 17. this is the last church age the final church he says because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes that thou may see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent see this last church thought everything was fine because she had an overinflated estimation of herself she had left the word her bridegroom her mate she had left the word and thought she was fine because of her title that she supposed that she still had she still believed that she was bright she still believed that she was queen but she had already left the headship and when she left the headship she put him on the outside of the church and now she was standing there thinking she was clothed thinking she was rich thinking she was increased with goods but she was poor miserable blind and naked and god says in verse 19 as many as i love i rebuke and chase and be zealous therefore and repent what wonderful words as many as i love i rebuke and chasten see this church had got to the place where they didn't think god would chasten them because they're the church they didn't think god would rebuke or chase him because we're this and we're that and we have this but he says as many as i love i rebuke and chase sin and don't think for a minute that god will not correct his bride god will correct his bride whenever and that's one thing the bible says thy rod and thy staff they comfort me i take comfort in that if i am his bride it doesn't mean that i'll never do wrong but if i get to one side or the other his rod and his staff they comfort me he will chase and he will rebuke if he loves me so brother bam said you know he talked to that young man that young man said oh god loves me so much he doesn't care what i do none of us would say that not one of us would say a thing like that because we heard the brother ben say it not but sometimes in our attitude we can express that we can disregard and take the wrong attitude have an arrogant spirit and assume something but what we need to do is say god search my life and make me be pleasing to you i think that's our hearts cry amen that's the spirit of the age that's come upon the bride is to be submissive to be humble to be reverent to be respectful and to know that if there's any good thing that's happening it's him and not i he's done it through me let's go to verse 18 we've already referenced this but i would like to read it together or i'm sorry chapter 18 chapter 18 in revelation i'm going to read verse 4. and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached into heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double under her double according to her works and the cup which she has filled filled to her double how much she hath glorified herself what did this church do glorified herself amen this is one thing that the bride will never do she will never glorify herself she will wait for her husband to glorify her she will not glorify herself how much he hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the lord god who judgeth her she thought she was beyond judgment she thought she was the queen and would see no sorrow but she didn't realize that she had already left her mate her husband and she was rejected amen she wasn't humble she exalted herself with all these things that we talked about i want to take this now to the book of esther because i want to show the attitude and approach of the bride the book of esther let's turn there esther we'll start with esther chapter one now i'd like to just say all the way back from the garden of eden and beyond whenever the woman gets out of her position it brings death not life but if the woman out of position can bring death then the woman in position can bring life so let's look here at esther chapter 1 verse 2. it says that in those days when king azzarah sat on the throne of his kingdom which was shusha and the palace in the third year of his reign he made a feast into all the princes and his servants the power of persian media and the nobles the princes of the province as being before him when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom in the honor of his excellent majesty many days even a hundred and four score days so we want to look at this and like i said we went over this many times but it still so comes back so fresh to me he had this feast amen for six months but at the end of six months you're going into the seventh month now so 180 days back in biblical time with six months at the end of six months he's going into the seventh month and so now when it says uh many days even a hundred and four score days and verse five and when these days were expired so after that going into the seventh so we can start to place ourselves right here in the seventh church age right here in time and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shusha and the palace both under the great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the king of the palace so there's a seven day feast taking place in the seventh month this is so good because in the seventh church age we're going to have amen all seven church ages expressed amen all the truths of the seven church ages expressed in the seventh church age so he's gonna have a feast amen for seven days i wanna i wanna jump down from there to verse nine also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king azaris on the seventh day the seventh day of the seven day feast in the seventh month so when he gets all the way down to the end he's going to do something and the seventh day when the heart of the king was married with the that was mary with wine he com he commanded and these are seven names i'm not going to try to read all those names amen the seven chamberlain's that served in the presence of azares the king to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to show the people and the princess her beauty for she was fair to look on so now we come to the seventh month there's a seventh day there's a seven day feast amen and then the seventh day amen you've got seven seven seven amen and the seventh day he sent seven chamberlains like the seven church age messengers that were in the cloud he sends the seven amen go to go fetch vashti the queen amen she's the queen come and fetch her and bring her amen into the face so all can see her because she's beautiful verse 12 but the queen vashti refused to comment the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very roth in his anger burned in him here she has a wonderful opportunity but this queen the king sends her and sends seven chamberlains after her and he goes after her on the seventh day of the feast to bring her for all the people to see what's he doing he's going to unveil the bride he's going to bring out the queen and he tells her to get her her royal apparel and her crown amen come out i want all the people to see amen my beautiful queen amen but she refused to come to the king's bidding amen and and that's exactly what happened in this church a.j man god sent a messenger with a powerful demonstration in the word and he restored i mean he restored the word back amen but the church denominational systems refused to come to the feast what was she doing she was having her own feast for the women she was caught up in her own ecumenical move with all the other churches and she refused and you you realize how how uh terrible this is because you realize she was the queen amen and she was the queen and the queen had a position and that position came with certain power and authority and when she was in this position she was now using that uh position to have a feast for uh for the women and then this feast of women she would rather stay in her own feast the feast of women than comet the king's bidding to the king's feast and that is exactly what has happened in our day friends we've seen this with our own eyes they would rather stay in their own feet the queen making her own feast the feast for the women for all the denominations staying in their ecumenical move and refused to come to the feast of the king but the sad part is she was only a queen by the choice of the king not by her own merit see she refused the one who made her queen she was so if i could just put it in my own way of understanding and viewing this she was so exalted in her own glory she was so puffed up and so exalted and so deceived by her own brightness she was beautiful she was rich she was the queen she was in position and then she now has her own idea and her own idea is a is a is a feast for the women and she wants to stay with her own idea and not come to the bidding of the king and the king is the one who made her queen she's not queen of her own right she's only queen by the will of the king see how foolish the church systems are amen they leave off the word which is their very king amen to take their own idea because their church because i'm the bride because i'm this church or that church or this church i have this title or that title amen i can begin you know all the churches come up with their own doctrine and own dogmas and own ideas and own answers to questions outside the word of god and sometimes contrary to the word of god and why do they do that because they say they're the church of the living god and we have a right to do this not realizing the only reason that you are even queen is by choice of the king the king makes you queen not you yourself make yourself that you're nothing without the king and the king is this revealed word amen it is the word of god which is our headship is our husband the revealed word of the hour so the act independent of that word is to do exactly what vashti was doing make our own choices to go our own way to make our own decisions because we are we're nothing without the king and we're only what the king has made us and how many times not just in the bible but through the church ages did god put away one to take another they always israel thought they were the chosen nation nothing will ever hurt us and it was true they were the chosen nation nothing will ever hurt us nothing will harm us we're the chosen nation but when they left their god amen god rejected them they were the chosen nation by his choice they became a strong nation by his strength and they got puffed up because what god did for them they got blinded they forgot how little they were they forgot how helpless they were they forgot what it was like to be a slave in egypt to feel the task masters whip and have no way to deliver yourself they forgot what that was like when they got into position god chose them god led them by a pillar of fire god placed them in the land god drove out the inhabitants amen but they began all of a sudden to rely on their own strength amen and move away from the commandments and laws of god amen and then they would go into utter ruin because they were only there by the will of god and vashti was only in the palace by the will of azaris the king but yes she wanted to exert her own will she wanted to have her own way i think this is so so sad i said god never let me be like this vashti never let me get comfortable so comfortable in what you've done for me that i forget what i am without you amen let's look at verse 19. there's a council that takes place they they counsel with uh the king on what he should do and it comes to verse ninth he says if it pleased the king let there be a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes that it be not altered that vashti come no more before king azaris and let the king give her royal state unto another that is better than she wow they're going to get one that's better than she but i want you to look at the one that's better than she this is what we're going to spend some time with what were the qualifications what were the characteristics of the one that was better than she because listen she was beautiful she had the royal apparel she may have had you know by this time she had may have had all the right etiquette all the right forms she may have had social graces she had beauty amen there there was there was there was all of those things that the queen possessed but they were looking for one that was better than her because she wasn't good enough and she wasn't good enough by by virtue of her beauty or her refinement she wasn't good enough because she was exalted in her own eyes and refused the commandment of the king now they're going to look for one that's better than she let's look at chapter 2 verse 1 after these things when the wrath of king azaris was appeased he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her then said the king's servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of the kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins into shusha and the palace to the house of the women and to the custody of haggai the king's chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things be for purification be given them and look at verse 4 and let the maiden which pleaseth the king here we go this is what we're looking for let the maiden which pleases the king be queen instead of vashti vashti was more interested in pleasing herself than she wasn't pleasing the king but now let's get a maiden that pleases the king the queen instead of vashti and the thing pleased the king and he did so let's go down to verse 8. so it came to pass when the king's commandment in his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together into shush and the palace to the custody of haggai that esther was brought also into the king's house to the custody of haggai keeper the women and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her things for purification with with with such things as belonged to her and seven maidens which were meat to be given to her out of the king's house he preferred her and her maids into the best place of the house of the women esther had not showed her people nor her kindred for mordecai had charged her that she should not show it so here i'm going to we're going to expound upon several things in here but we realize now esther is is the adopted daughter of mordecai because mordecai the esther is his cousin mordecai's uncle this is mordecai's uncle's daughter and her parents died and mordecai took her and raised her as his own daughter so his adopted daughter is esther and esther is obedient to mordecai so one of the first things we want to see here that esther is submissive to headship esther is submissive to her headship and and when esther goes to the king esther didn't go to the king by her own choosing you realize the king's servants went out and gathered all the fair young virgins and they made the selection and they brought them in so it wasn't esther's own choosing esther didn't say well i mean i think i meet all the qualifications i think i've got this and i've got that and i've got my resume and i'm going to go up to the king's palace and i'm going to take my resume and give it to him esther did not have this estimation of herself esther was chosen by one of the king's servants went and called her and brought her in to the house of haggai where she can be prepared to meet the king and then because the king was going to choose the one that pleases him to be queen instead of ashty so vashti lost her position is that right so that shows that vashti that it had nothing to do with vashti because if she lost her position she didn't give herself the position she didn't earn the position she only had the position by the choice of the king and when the king changed his choice she lost her position now he's looking for one that will please him but god is going to give us insight into this esther and esther now she went in and then esther was was admired by haggai haggy i loved her and haggy i chose her and haggy i set her in a special position and gave her a maiden and gave her all the things she needed for purification because she pleased haggai and we're starting to find out now that esther has the kind of nature amen esther has the kind of approach amen where she's submissive and pleasing haggai becomes she haggy i has charge of the virgins he's in charge and now she submisses the haggy eye and and she's pleasing to haggai she doesn't show her people her kindred because mordecai her adopted father told her not to and let's look at this over at verse 20. verse 20 says the same thing of the same chapter chapter 2 verse 20. esther had not yet showed her kindred nor her people as mordecai had charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai lack as when she was brought up with him here she is she can choose her own way mordecai has no more say over her mordechai she's gone into the charge of haggai she's gone amen she's independent now amen but she has a submissive nature to headship and mordecai was like a father to her it was her adopted dad and when mordecai said don't show it she wouldn't show it when she was separated from work morocco she obeyed him just like when she was brought up with him what are we seeing we're seeing the nature of esther there's a nature here that is going to please the king amen let's let's look here back at verse 15. let's jump back to verse 15. now come a turn for each of these young virgins to go before the king and he was going to make his selection verse 15 said now when the turn of esther the daughter abigail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into to the king she required nothing but what haggai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her this is an amazing scripture now it's her turn to go before the king and the king is going to make her selection and it says and it makes special note of this so i think it's important it says that that when it was her turn to go into the king she required nothing but what haggai the king's chamberlain the keeper the woman appointed when she went before the king she did not go with any of her own ideas she did not require anything else all that she went before the king was what haggai the keeper of the woman had appointed under her and when haggai who was her headship and pointed under her she says whatever you say is good enough for me whatever you give is right amen because esther had never been there but haggy i knew what the king liked haggai i knew what was appointed to the women haggy i gave it and when it says the scripture when it says it this way it leads you to believe that the other women were able to ask of things or have other things amen but here is one woman and i don't know how many there was or how many would have made the same choice but here's one woman who doesn't want anything of her own idea she doesn't want to adorn herself any differently than what haggai the keeper of the virgins told her to wear and appoint it to her to wear what are you seeing you're seeing a submissive nature i say this is what god wants this is what king azaris is going to be pleased with it says and esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her so esther was taken in the king azaris into his house royal in the 10th month which is the month tibeth in the seventh year of his reign and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti now who's the queen the one that pleased the king see now who's the the queen the one that pleased the king the one that didn't do it her own way but did it the way she was instructed by mordecai she kept his command by haggai she kept the things appointed to him now she comes before the king and the king says this is the one that i'm going to choose then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants even esther's feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king praise be to god let's look over here verse 4. now as soon as as soon as esther gets promoted to queen guess who else gets promoted haman these these things are always running on parallel tracks and haman comes up with a plan to destroy amen to destroy the jews because he's jealous of mordecai amen and now he's going to come up with this plan and he's been exalted he's been lifted up amen he's been given a position in the kingdom and now he he's working his plan to destroy but there sits esther amen the humble little uh submissive queen amen that's obedient submissive gentle and quiet she's sitting there and we're going to find out that deliverance is going to come by this woman but this woman is never going to have to act like jezebel to bring deliverance to her people she is never going to have to get out of her position and her role to bring deliverance she's going to stay submissive humble reverent give honor amen and she's going to do all of those things and in keeping in her position she is going to deliver an entire kindred in people and you think you know to conquer to overcome to deliver she's the queen she'll stand there and she'll decree and she'll say no she doesn't change her nature amen she plays the role god gave her to play and when she plays that role she becomes a mighty conqueror and overcomes haman but she never has to become aggressive she never has to become burly she never has to become manly she doesn't have to become conniving she doesn't have to take her own ideas she can stay feminine gentle sweet reverent kind she can give honor and respect and in doing so the king will come to her side and deliver her what a picture of today friends we don't have to become arrogant and boastful and loud we don't all we have to do is stay in the role god gave us stay submissive to our headship and say god i'm doing what you said god i'm obedient to you and now i'm trusting in you to deliver me because i have no power to deliver myself all i have is what you've given all i have is the word you've given and i'm taking the word as you gave it the way the prophet said take it and i'm using it the way the prophet said use it and i'm trusting you to bring deliverance and i'm not going to change i'm just going to do it the way that your prophet said do it this plan begins to unfold and and after the decree comes out mordecai is in sackcloth and ashes and and somebody tells uh esther the queen and she begins to become worried amen and sends a chamberlain to go and speak to mordecai here's the conversation in chapter 4 verse 7. and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and of the sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the jews to destroy them also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at shushan to destroy them to show it unto esther and to declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make requests before him for her people and heitach came and told esther the words of mordecai and again esther spoke unto hatetach and gave him commandment unto mordecai that all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king and to the inner court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live but i have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days and they told to mordecai esther's words then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the jews for thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether there are come to the kingdom for such a time as this then esther bade them return mordecai this answer go gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither yet neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish praise god so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther had commanded him now he comes to her and says you're the queen amen you've got to go unto the king and you've got to make supplication for your people and she says no but we reverence the king there's an approach to the king and she knows she's not just going to barge in there and start making demands and throw her weight around she's not that kind of a queen amen but she comes she starts to humble herself when she's going to go to the king and then she starts to humble herself and she declares a fast amen and then the fast for three days and she the queen humbles herself under this fast to go in unto the king and then we see this approach here in esther chapter five verse one now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on a royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden scepter that was in his hands so esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter then said the king unto her what will thou queen esther and what is thy request it shall be given thee to half of the kingdom my goodness look at her approach and look at her reward what is it she comes before him humbly she stands there when he sees her that she's come to him he holds out the golden scepter for her acceptance she come she touches he said what is it that you want up to half of the kingdom oh my goodness if esther was a different kind of person what kind of advantage would she have taken of that word right there but esther had the right nature amen she could be granted such a statement but she wouldn't use it for personal gain she wouldn't use it to exalt herself but she's not here for herself she's here for her people so now the king and look at the delight of the king the king is delighted that she came vashti would not come at a request here comes esther without a request approaching to the king and guess what the king liked it he said what is it that you want up to half of the kingdom and answer and esther answered if it seemed good unto the king let the king and haman come this day into the banquet that i have prepared for him now as we go along in this dialogue i want you just to to catch some things esther's approach to the king is always if it seemed good to the king if it be pleasing to the king if the king be pleased see esther's approach is not demanding i'm the queen i have rights but her approach to the king is always if it's pleasing to you if it seemed good in your sight you know this was jesus approach to his father when he comes to gethsemane and he's pouring his heart out and he's in agony over what's coming and he was sweating as it were great drops of blood he said if it be thy will let this cup pass from me but if not nevertheless thy will be done he's not as a son making demands and he's not amen throwing his position out there he's saying god i don't jesus is saying can this cup pass he's saying i i myself as a man don't want to go through this i'm in agony over this but he says if thy will can this cup pass from me he's not saying god stop this and take this away and you said and it's like david when david's walking amen he's walking out of israel amen and there's a man cursing him and throwing rocks and spitting at him and amen and one of his soldiers want to say i'll cut the head off of that dog that spits on my king and david said leave him alone maybe the lord told him to do that and brother brennan picks up the same story over a tax collector and then he's having a hard time with this tax case and then he's there in his home and and there's a question about whether he should go back to arizona or not and somebody says spouts off and says something about that oh all that tax collector i wish he would and brother bran said leave him alone maybe the lord told him to do that see such a humility friends such a respect for god in god's way amen that he wouldn't even let somebody rail against a tax collector that was causing him problems i mean even when when michael was disputing michael the archangel was disputing over the body of moses with the devil he said the lord rebuked thee he wouldn't even the bible said he wouldn't even bring a railing accusation against him amen and sometimes we we can find ourselves saying things that are so harsh we speak about government officials in such wicked evil ways but who put them there whose plan is it who picks your leader amen god raises kings god lowers king amen you never see daniel act that way is that right there's such the this this esther has such an approach jesus christ had such an approach brother branham had such an approach amen amen even when brother benham disagreed with the politics and the stance of jfk he disagreed amen that that we should even elect the catholic president disagreed on his policy remember when he shot down he had the people stand up and pray for his wife and for his children he said he's our president and he deserves respects is that what the prophet says why because when you understand that god ordains everything around you amen we find ourselves fighting god sometimes amen but jesus was saying if it be thy will amen esther is saying if it be pleasing to you if it's good in your eyes amen there's got to be a certain submission and the bride says god whatever you want from me i'm happy with whoever you choose i'm happy with these things aren't good they're not supposed to be good they're not going in the right direction amen but god has ordained it to be so and the bride says be it so because my king my lord is decreed it that way and whatever he does is good amen let's look at chapter 7. they come they come to the feast esther's banquet chapter 7 verse 1 it says so the king and haman came to the banquet with esther the queen and the king said again unto esther on the second day at the banquet of wine what is thy petition queen esther and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request and it shall be performed even to half of the kingdom here she gets a second opportunity at half the kingdom but one thing we realize about esther is esther wasn't in it for herself esther was selfless then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favor in thy side old king and if it please the king let my life be given me at my petition in my people at my request for we are sold and i am my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we had been sold for bond men and bond woman i had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage then king azares answered and said unto esther the queen who is he and where is he that durst presume in this heart to do so and esther said the adversary the enemy is this wicked haman then haman was afraid before the king and the queen see esther if you watch esther's nature esther never has to get outside her nature to get the attention of the king she does it respectfully with honor and in submission and then the king asks her what do you want and then she begins to share and she says if it please the king if it be good in thy sight would you give me my life we're talking about something serious somebody's threatening the life of the queen you would think she could just storm right in stomp in and start making demands and you know who i am and but she doesn't do it that way she stays gentle submissive this is what was pleasing to the king chapter 8 verse 1 they send off haman haman hangs on the gallows that he built for mordecai but it says on that day did the king azares give the house of haman the jews enemy and to esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was unto her and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and gave it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house of haman and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite in his device that he had devised against the jews then the king held out the golden scepter toward esther so esther arose and stood before the king and said if it pleased the king and if i have found favor in thy sight and the things seem right before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hemadetha the agagite which he wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the king's provinces for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred then the king azares said unto esther the queen and the mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him that have they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews right ye also for the jews as it liketh you in the king's name and seal it with the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and the ceiling with the king's ring may no man reverse she was of such a nature that the king could tell esther now whatsoever you say see she didn't take it on herself amen she waited for when the king she comes to the king if it be pleasing to you okay if it be good in your side if i found grace in your sight of pleasure in your sight you take pleasure in me can you reverse this and he says mordecai has the ring you write it you you guys write it and you write it in my name see how different this is to jezebel jezebel when she found out that ahab comes in pouting because he can't have nabat's vineyard amen he says do you not rule over israel or do you not rule over israel she says i will give you naba's vineyard i will give you nabal's vineyard and she took and wrote letters and sealed it the king's seal with the king's name amen without even permission of the king she took it upon herself to take the king's name in her own way saying i will i will i will and it's the very nature of lucifer being expressed but esther comes completely different than jezebel esther comes if it be pleasing to you if it is good in your sight if i found favor in your sight and the king says you can say it in my name and whatever you say will be backed up by my seal amen not because she was arrogant not because she said i'm the king but because she approached the king the right way the king found somebody that he could trust and say now you say in the way you say and right you have a right to use my name and in this day he's looking for a bride that'll stay bride amen stay submissive to his word stay humble stay reverent stay in respect so he can say whatever you say did he have that with the prophet he gave the power of the spoken word to his prophet amen and when he gave that power to moses he told moses call for fleece call for flies call for this and moses would go out and say what god said and it will come to pass but when it come to the prophet of this age he would say whatever you say what did he find what was in that man there was a man that was completely submissive to god there was a man who didn't take his own way he had been tried and he had been tested he would humble himself to god before the people he would correct his wrongs he would stay in line with the word he would he would he would he would want god's will over everything else and god would say you say see god loves that kind of nature he hates the one that grabs and takes and says and declares he loves the one that will come to him humble themselves and trust in him and believe in him and want to please him somebody asked brother branham they were asking about the spoken word and say now that you've demonstrated the spoken word you could speak somebody and they can be totally saved and in a raptured condition something along those lines and go to heaven are going the rapture and brother branham says yes that's true because the power of the spoken word is the power of the spoken word he said yes he said but see all those were given by permission the prophet didn't take his position and just say this and say that and say this it was all by permission we even talked last sunday about him standing on the platform and the message the deepest calling to the deep standing there and him hauling around i don't say that disrespectfully but that's what he was doing he was he was having this discussion and that discussion he's standing he's got people lined up he's got thousands in the crowd i mean he's under pressure but he's sitting there waiting and he's talking and he said we got this lined up and he's telling a testimony and then all of a sudden he says now you know i'm waiting for something look at the humility friends look at the subjection unto god look at the surrender the the submission god this is what god loves friends you never you don't see the prophet of god taking his position i mean he he's not even demanding that people show him respect should you show him respect yes but he's not even demanding it because of his position he's giving all glory and honor to god he's humble he's submissive he's been tested and he's proved himself humbled to god he gives all credit to god he stays with the word of god at all costs and god can say unto him now you say the king as theirs can say unto esther you i've given the i've given the seal i've given the signet my ring amen to mordecai whatever you guys write write it and seal it in my name he didn't ask to inspect it first he didn't want to proofread it why he had already seen the character that was so different than the character of vashti this was a character he could trust in i want him to find that character in me we believe in the manifestation of the spoken word we believe in a short quick where we believe in all of that amen but i wonder if now is not the time of character proving and testing our character amen remember esther brought deliverance listen esther brought down haman the second most powerful person in the kingdom brought him to ruin amen and all those that agreed with him were brought to ruin and his ten sons were killed and hung on the gallows we'll get to that in a minute amen and all because of esther but not in her mind and not in her power and not in her taking a a position that wasn't hers but esther brought the destruction of the nemesis of the jews brought the destruction of all those that would harm the jews and brought deliverance for the nation by what by staying submissive as a as a humble submissive queen see the bride in this day we don't have to get bold and brash and burly and boastful and we don't have to be like other churches and we don't have to be like a queen who wants our own feasts and refuses the king this bride can stay submissive and humble and reverent amen and sweet and kind and what is she going to do she's going to bring down haman's kingdom and all that agree with him and bring deliverance to all god's people amen and then by her submission bring a resurrection out of the dead amen and there's going to be a rapture by the plan of god how because he's going to have a bride who's not going to act like vashti but he's going to have one who acts like [Music] esther praise god you can be called queen so long you start to forget how you became queen you lose sight of who made you clean and how you're sustained as queen you're queen by the choice of god you've come into union with christ by the new birth by something he did for you by his foreign nation his choosing his election and you remain there by him vashti forgot that esther never did let's look at chapter 9 this is the last portion i want to read here in the book of esther esther chapter 9. we'll read it at verse 12 that they sent out a decree esther and mordecai for all the jews did to be able to defend themselves the word comes back to the king and verse 12 says and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in shushan the palace and the ten sons of haman what have they done what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces now what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is thy request further and it shall be done then said esther if it pleased the king let it be granted to the jews which are in shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day's decree and let haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows and the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was given at shushan and they hanged haman's ten sons listen we've come to judgment we've come now to a time of judgment and the king and the queen are together and there's a judgment taking place in shushan and and there's there's all these that are killed and the ten sons of haman are killed and after they're killed amen they they the king says unto the queen what else is your petition what else do you want she says if it pleased the king if it pleased the king she always says if it pleased the king you know in the book of james james admonishes this says don't say tomorrow i'll travel to this city and live there a year and make such and such he said don't do that say if the lord wills i will now you can take that to extreme and make a law and you can tell your wife hey i'm going to go get gas if the lord wills no just go get gas it's an attitude it's the approach say i will go to a city i will be there a year i will earn such and such that's all wrong that attitude is wrong not like if you tell somebody oh yeah i'm planning on going to visit my mom we're going to go over to this state we're going to be there a week we'll be back what he's saying is your attitude should be if that pleases the lord if that's the lord's will whatever we do whatever we say we want it to please the lord he's telling us don't even make plans as as if you're in control and as you get to decide he said make your plans as if it's the will of the lord we'll go and do this and go and do that because tomorrow you have no guarantee of and you don't know what's going to happen and so esther has been given this this opportunity to speak he says now what do you want and she says if it please the king let them do today as they did yesterday and hang the ten sons of hammond amen you realize this is she's judging the dead because these ten sons were already killed and we know there's a time amen that that the bride will sit the white throne judgment and she'll judge the dead amen when those ten sons were hanged it was a second death and you are going to sit with the king the bride will sit king and queen will sit together at the white throne judgment judging this world according to the scriptures but look at how it was done when esther was given the right to judge he said what do you want now he turns to her and what do you say she didn't just spout off she didn't just say she didn't come with their own plans when the lord told her to judge she judged and when she judged he said if it pleased the lord see all of these things are true she was the queen she was given the right she was allowed to use the king's name she had all of these rights and all these privileges she defeated her enemy she delivered amen she delivered the kingdom of the jews she delivered she saved she did and how does she do it she did it through submission to her headship she did it with humility and honor to the king and always with if it please you if it'd be pleasing to you if it's good in your sight and when it comes to the end what did esther really do what sword did she wield who did she take captive she didn't do anything the king did it all when we get to the end of this journey god is going to use his bride in the end time to finish his works she knows that it has to be him and her doing the work he's going to complete now all that he left amen he didn't fulfill all of his work but he would now complete his work in and through the bride and she knows that it has to be him doing the work when it comes to the end of it what is it that we've done anyways we've done nothing it was all him all we did was surrender and submit and let him be god god doesn't need our power god doesn't need our intellect god doesn't need our beauty god doesn't need our money what god needs is our humble submission and he needs us to play the right part as the bride i want to read a quote as we wrap up two quotes i want to read the first one is a humble thyself from july 14th 1963. though i understand all the mysteries of god see and still though i could do it and have not charity i am nothing see i got nowhere yet see the main thing is love god and humble yourself with it now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people i ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in that and if you want to get somewhere with god never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you don't let no malice come in no matter what anybody does if they're wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person see you be sweet and kind remember god loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of god is in you you love the other person when he's in the wrong just pray for them and love one another above everything love god and love one another and be humble with god and around one another and god will bless us it's hard telling what he'll do usually when a church begins to get in numbers and get to getting a little bigger or something like that they get away from the real thing the real thing brother i said i've been around the world i ought to know the approach he said don't never let an arrogant spirit come around you you stay humble with god and humble with one another and see what god will do for you and i say lord let me have the approach of esther root out jezebel root out vashti root out all these other queens but give me the nature of esther let me approach the way esther approached let me let me petition you the way esther petitioned you amen let me let me know your love for me and let me come lord to you trusting that you'll do for me and in the end of it all i can say is i didn't do anything and then at the end we'll be able to have the same testimony brother branham had he goes i wasn't the one that did those things i was just standing near when he did them i wasn't the one who come down the river i wasn't one who said that i'm not the one who opened blind and i i'm not the one who've done all these things he's the one who'd done it and jesus christ said the same thing he said i'm not the one who did it it's the father who dwelleth in me and brother branham coming he said it's not me amen it's him i'm not the one it's him it's not the seventh angel it's christ it's not me and when the bride comes to the end of the road she's going to say the same thing it wasn't me i was just standing there when he did it it wasn't what i did it's what i surrendered myself to it wasn't my power it was my submission it wasn't my strength it was my yielding amen it wasn't my my intellect it was my obedience what god looking for he's looking for something he's never had before a church that'll hum themselves and submit to all of his word he doesn't need your power he's got plenty he doesn't need your money he doesn't need your good looks he doesn't need he does all he's looking for is what he's never had before a people that will humble themselves and give him complete submission and make him first place in everything and if he can find that kind of bride it's limitless what can be done deliverance will come but not if we change our role deliverance will come if we stay the way he's made us and express jesus christ in the formation of the bride one more quote out of christ is the mystery of god revealed he says never he's talking here and picking up mid-sentence never able to come to the knowledge of the truth and these men resisted as janice and jamberry's generous and janice withstood moses able to produce a church and produce a group of people yes sir but their folly will be made manifest when jesus takes his bride and sets her up here and said this is her and the way he goes with her what's he going to do he's going to exalt his bride he's going to take her and all the other janice and jammers all the other gifts and all the other movements amen they'll show their folly when he takes his bride and he lifts her up here and says this is her and the way he goes for her she will not exalt herself she will humber herself but if you humble yourself in due time you'll be exalted when jesus christ himself picks up his bride and says this is her and then away he goes with her how do i get there how do i get to that exalted place how do i get to the place where he picks me up and says this is her the way he goes with her i tell you the way up is down the way to get to there amen is is the the to submit to humble to reverence to respect our headship which is christ which is the word and give him all reverence and all respect and give him first place and if we can be submissive and humble and sweet and be the bride that he's looking for in this day in due season he'll take us and put us up here and say this is her and away he goes with her i say god let me be that kind of bride let's all stand musicians if you'll come please i'd like to say this last statement i've said it several times through this but when a woman gets out of position she brings death but when a woman stays in position she brings life and this bride will stay in her position because she's predestinated to there will be a people and there is a people on this earth that doesn't want her own way that doesn't want to be anything special of any special title she's only what she is by the commandment of god she's only what she is by the will of god she's only done what she's done by the strength of god and the provision of god and she gives him all the credit for and she says it wasn't me it was him and even the queen bows before the king because it was all him let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we ask that you would bless us lord as we hear this word lord we want to become this word lord you've called us in this day to express this very nature and god it has to be you and us we're just asking lord that you would help us to remain humble and submissive to you god that we would be a people unlike any that's ever been here before lord because every other church lord they they got exalted in their own eyes and they went their own way but you promised there would be one in the end time that would not fail you promised there would be one just like you restored the last adam you promised there would be a woman that would be here that it would be you and her expressing yourself in the formation of the bride you said it would be here we believe it we accept it lord we reverence you we respect your lord and we come humbly before you we say lord make us make us what you've called us to be in this hour purge out all the wrong thinking if there's any vanity and any pride take it out of us lord there's any hangover from previous denominations if there's any lord any self-exaltation lord i pray you strip it from us now may we have the approach of esther oh may you be glorified in our lives may you have your way with us god your prophet said we can't make ourselves little enough we can't humble ourselves enough lord if we could just trust in you more have your way with us lord use us for your glory help us to stay in our position may we bring glory and honor to your name in jesus christ's name we pray amen and i want to remind you of communion service we'll come back
