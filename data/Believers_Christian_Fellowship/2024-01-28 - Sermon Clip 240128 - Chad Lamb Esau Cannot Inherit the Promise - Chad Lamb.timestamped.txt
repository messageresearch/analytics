[0:00] I was looking at this subject of the
[0:03] millennial Reign and this is when Christ
[0:05] returns to set up his kingdom physically
[0:07] upon the Earth and we rule and reign
[0:09] with him we're part of that Kingdom
[0:11] we're part of the ruling Authority amen
[0:13] we're part of the Kingdom that gives
[0:15] rulership and there's even discussion in
[0:17] the scriptures where where there's even
[0:20] uh uh we we even take part in the
[0:23] government so that if even Egypt doesn't
[0:26] come up to the Feast of Tabernacles
[0:28] there'll be no reain for them there'll
[0:29] be retri tion there'll be correction
[0:31] there'll be teaching there'll be
[0:32] instruction there'll be all of this
[0:33] going on in the Millennium and we'll be
[0:35] part of it am he told them that you know
[0:38] I'll give I'll make you ruler over
[0:40] cities and when are these these promises
[0:42] going to take place and when are these
[0:43] rewards going to come in the millennial
[0:46] Reign but where my meditation was is how
[0:50] in the world am I going to sit on a
[0:53] throne with Jesus Christ and Rule and
[0:55] Reign for a thousand years when I can't
[0:58] rule this little plot of Earth he's
[1:00] given me
[1:01] today what makes me think that I'm going
[1:04] to rule in the Millennium with Christ
[1:07] when he's asked me to possess one little
[1:09] clump of dirt one little corner one
[1:12] postage stamp size of Earth and he's
[1:14] given not a city not a village not a
[1:17] town not even a household he has given
[1:20] me one little clump of his dirt creation
[1:23] and he's asking me to rule that and I
[1:25] can't even bring this clump of dirt to
[1:27] subjection to the word what makes makes
[1:30] me think I'm going to rule and reign in
[1:31] the
[1:32] Millennium if we're not able amen by the
[1:35] grace of God and by the spirit of God to
[1:37] bring this dirt into subjection to the
[1:39] word by the by the authority of the word
[1:41] and the power of the spirit what makes
[1:43] us think we're fit to rule and Reign for
[1:45] a thousand years I say God help me to
[1:48] get it right now amen help me to take
[1:50] that word and bring how am I going to
[1:52] bring Egypt subjection to the word and
[1:55] say Egypt if you don't come to Feast the
[1:56] Tabernacles you get no rain when I'm not
[1:58] coming subject to all of the
[2:01] word what
[2:05] hypocrisy say God help me you've got to
[2:09] help me God I I I'm tired of looking
[2:12] everywhere else for what's wrong I'm
[2:14] finding plenty of wrong right here I've
[2:16] got enough wrong right here to preoccupy
[2:18] the rest of my days on Earth I'm pretty
[2:20] sure of
[2:22] that but now I realize what my goal is
[2:25] because what does he want in the great
[2:27] plan of God he had a three-fold purpose
[2:29] and the second is to get preeminence in
[2:30] a man what does he want he wants full
[2:32] control right here he wants somebody to
[2:34] give him first place and I want to be I
[2:37] want to be the patch of earth that is
[2:40] dedicated and designated to Jesus Christ
[2:42] the word alone and there's one spot on
[2:45] Earth where God is glorified one spot
[2:47] where his name is well spoken of one
[2:49] spot where he's glorified one spot where
[2:51] he rules and Reigns if it's not anywhere
[2:53] else in the earth I want it to be in
[2:55] this earth right
[2:56] here
