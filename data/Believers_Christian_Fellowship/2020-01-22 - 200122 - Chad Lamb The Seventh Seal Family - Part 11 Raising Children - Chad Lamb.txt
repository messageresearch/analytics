[Music] the lord you deserve the glory the lord there is no one else like you [Music] there is no one else's there is no one else like there is no one [Music] praise the lord amen he is great and so good to be here with you this evening may god bless you and i'm going to pick back up where we left off on the seventh seal family by the grace of god we've had a few visitors and we broke that up but i feel good about going back it'll be part 11. and so but before that i just wanted to let you all know many of you probably heard but this past monday brother john lafontaine passed away on the 20th of january and so we want to remember the family we just want to have a time of prayer right now as a congregation pray for the family and for the church there our brother was 76 years old in november he would have turned 77. he's very dear to this assembly and very close friends to many of you have known him for a long long time and we just want to remember them if you'd like to send cards to sister loretta and the family there's a address on the bulletin board and also they're not going to be having a funeral he asked that they not but in about a month they're going to have a memorial celebration for our brother john and there'll be more details out as soon as the details are released we'll bring those to you and let you know when they're planning on doing that but while we're standing let's just bow our heads and pray their heavenly father we thank you lord god that at all times we can glorify your name lord in the morning we can praise your name lord in good times in sickness and in health we can always praise your name because all things are in your control and lord you have saw fit to bring one of your children back home our brother john lord has returned back lord to where he came from and we're so happy lord for him that he's released lord that he served your purpose in this life and he finished his course and god we just ask that you would bless the family that remains behind that you would hold them in the palm of your hand that you would comfort them as they mourn lord that you would be a a friend that sticketh closer than a brother this time to them let your presence be felt let it be tangible to them especially our sister loretta lord that you would comfort her she's lost a dear companion lord there's been a companion through life god i just pray that you'd uphold her that you would undergird her that you would comfort her lord in this time of grief bless the church lord the whole church has gathered there i prayed you blessed them and encouraged them now we give you glory lord and praise you and thank you for the life of our brother john for what he's meant to us for how he's blessed us lord and we pray god that you pour blessings upon his family well we ask that you would bless us as we look into your word that you would anoint us lord for the preaching of the word give us ears to hear all you have for us in this day in jesus christ's name we pray amen and while we're standing let's talk to turn to the book of psalms and we'll look at chapter 127 in the book of psalms also i got a message from brother steve hollander today sister marcia had a hip replacement surgery this morning that went very well she was out of surgery quickly the doctor said everything went excellent and she's already been up on her feet and walking with a walker so praise the lord so we're expecting god to give her a quick recovery and to see her hear her here again soon man so keep praying for her as well psalms 127 verse 3 lo children are at the heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man sore children of the youth happy is the man that had this quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate amen let's bow our head or we've already prayed never mind go ahead and sit down oh you never prayed too much the prophet said that so we can read a scripture and pray and never pray too much amen i'm such a creature of habit when i get out of order i confuse myself amen if we can bring the powerpoint up we'll we'll continue on here so it says children are in a heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward so children are never meant to be a burden they're a reward so they they're a heritage of the lord so they come from the lord and they're a reward so sometimes in raising children we've got to start with the right mental approach to raising children because if we see children as a burden or if we see you know multiple children because it says happiness and man has this quiver full and if we begin to see multiple children somehow a burden or a financial strain or or you know something that's going to hold us back in life or limit us in what we can do we've missed the point right and so now it says children are a heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows in the hand of the mighty man so are children of the youth happy is the man that had this quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate so having children is a good thing having a quiver full of them is a good thing it's a blessed it's a heritage of the lord and it's god's reward so we want to we want to have the right mental attitude when we come to raising children we want to have a scriptural approach and a scriptural attitude if god has blessed us with children not everybody gets that blessing not everybody has the privilege of being married not everybody has the privilege of having a child amen and if you've been privileged that way you should thank the lord for that and it should be something that we take very seriously that god has allowed in his great plan and his great purpose he's allowed us a meant to raise children for him so we should never take it lightly we're going to go over a couple quotes just to refresh ourselves on this notice the great masterpiece of the family the husband and wife cannot be truly a family unless they are one they have to be if they're not they are not a good family wife pulling one way the husband another that would make an awful family but in agreement with one love with love one to another that's a family and now that was god's masterpiece and now all the true family here portrays that so we want to that's why we're preaching on the seventh seal family amen the true family here is actually portraying god's masterpiece and so we want to have masterpiece reflecting families amen as we live in this life in the message oneness he says any man in his family a correct good noble obedient family is one with another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere they should all be one father with mother mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture amen that's a lovely picture we agree so that's our goal that's our target amen that's what we're aiming for we look here in joshua 24-15 says and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord when we were over we went over the scripture last time but i want to refresh you because when we start off raising children the first thing we need to do is get the right mental approach we need to see it as a blessed heritage of the lord and his reward and we need to be happy if our quiver is full of them but then we also need to start off with a determination and a vision we don't do anything haphazardly in life we're not coming into this life and just hoping things are going to work out but we need to set our focus we need to if we're ever going to hit the target amen you've got to line things up right on the back end if you're ever going to hit the target and you've got to know what the target is what is the goal what are we trying to accomplish i mean we're just hoping to have a couple children so we can say we have children and we can gather them around and wrestle in the floor with them and have children that's wonderful but that's not the goal that's not the target that's not the purpose amen if god gave his children he gave his children to raise for his glory and for his honor to know his name and for his purpose and so so joshua sets the course for his family he says you can serve whomever you will but as for me and my house we will serve the lord and so when when when you know the the baby's born and the doctor hands that baby to you amen you should already have joy in your heart because god has given you a great reward but also you should also have a goal in mind what am i going to new now that god has blessed me with this child am i just going to you know hope things work out and and you know life is kind of like a roll of the dice and sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't work out no i don't believe that and i don't believe that's the way we should approach it we should approach it with god's word in mind what does god's word want what is my goal what is what my target what am i aiming for and as for me and my house we will serve the lord that's for me and my wife we will raise this baby to know god's name to fear the lord to serve him amen if we start off right we can hope to end up right but if you start off wrong it's hard it's much harder let's look at this here in a couple quotes here brother ben said what is fatherhood is an attribute of god he said and parenthood originated in god because he was the first parent so what we're doing as as a parent we're actually demonstrating to the world characteristics and natures of god because he's the first parent so every parent should model themselves after the first parent so we like like i've been saying we don't just do things haphazardly but we do them intentionally we do them deliberately and we do them with revelation and so we see god as the first parent he's the model parent so we need to model ourselves after the model parent so we don't want to model ourselves after laodicea we don't want to model ourselves over the current you know understanding or the current conditions or the or the current accepted way for raising children we don't want to do that we want to look at the scriptures and look at the model parent and model ourselves after the model parent and that will be the word made flesh he also says and that's the backbone of the nation you break motherhood and you and you broke the nation right then that's one thing that helps hold it together real genuine parenthood amen schools will never compensate programs will never come and say psychiatrists never compensate for this so as we go through this i'm going to hit a lot of scriptures they're going to be on here i'm going to go through fast so if you want to jot them down jot them down but they'll also be on the website in the archaic archives my notes are always there so you can go in and download them you can go copy them but we're going to hit quite a few scriptures and we'll probably move pretty quick brother baby says the in the great coming revival in the outpouring of the holy spirit all the way back in 1954 he said oh it's a disgrace that our american woman ever put on a pair of overalls and went into a war plant to work i don't care how much that hurts but it's a disgrace it's breaking the backbone of this nation this little baby of yours needs you god gave you that baby to raise yourself not some babysitter that's right here not long ago they had some of these doctors that said let the baby lay and cry you nurse it at a certain time you don't pick it up if it cries let it cry it out they did that 25 years ago that was a great belief amongst the doctors come to find out it hatched out a bunch of neurotics let nature have its way god knows what's best the baby needs love if you take a love away from it you'll make a brute out of it that baby's got to have love you've got to take care of it so when we start at the beginning i want to start all the way back at the beginning what does this little infant baby need more than anything else it needs love the foundation for raising children is a revelation that god gave that child to you that's the heritage of the lord and a reward from the lord that's the starting point and blessed is the man that has a quiver for that's the starting point and then a determination as for me and my house will serve the lord but what is the foundation for raising children the foundation is love they need love brother ben makes this really clear i'm so glad to have a prophet says what brought on juvenile delinquency was parent delinquency the parent failing to take care of the children you remember a few years ago and stop reading i'm going to go back so you can't read i hate when you read ahead in my quote but but he says the problem is parent delinquency and and i want to say it this way then and every single one of us can be guilty of this the problem is laziness and selfishness and that's been my problem every one of my failings as a parent has been laziness and selfishness i won't use anybody else as an example i could use myself as an example all night long and my children say amen i just don't want to amen too loud but but the problem is selfishness and laziness because it's not really it's not really child discipline it's actually parental discipline because in order to administer child discipline you're going to have to be disciplined you're going to have to be consistent you're going to have to be steady you're going to have to get up when you're tired you're going to have to go into action when you don't feel like going to action you're going to have to not pretend you didn't just see that and everybody can say amen because everybody who's raised children have always every one of us have had that time when we pretended we didn't see that and you hope nobody else saw it either because you just don't feel like dealing with it right then you're tired you're frustrated the end of the day you just sat down you don't want to go through the whole rigmarole of chastisement and training and discipline and you know what that that laziness and that selfishness is what destroys children so we have to realize that i am going to make a personal sacrifice to do what god wants me to do it's not child delinquency it starts with parental delinquency and it becomes child delinquency now we go back to the quote the parent failing to take care of the child you remember a few years ago when my boy was born that's been about i think he's about 19 now i remember the doctor told my wife said just let that kid squall said it ain't going to hurt him and if grandma comes along to pick him up keep her tell her to keep her hands off of him said he ought to be in a crib broke at six months old now you know better than that sounds like talking of a witch doctor instead of a real doctor we got some grandmas here i'd just love to see some people pull that statement on a few of you grandmas out there take your hands off that baby there'd be a real good discussion going on but see the the thought of the day was too regimented back in that day regiment the child nurse at a certain time lay it down don't interact too much with it you'll spoil the child don't cuddle it too much just nurse it and lay it down leave it by itself train it to cry it out brother ben said don't do that the only way the baby's got to to call for anything is to cry out for it that's nature's little bell he put in it cry and brother brahm told us don't do that that doesn't mean you don't teach him how to lay down and sleep that's not what he's talking about but this whole concept of don't overdo it don't call them too much don't hold them too much don't love them too much you'll spoil them you can't spoil an infant they say you can't spoil an infant you know he said now you know better than that sounds like a talking of a witch doctor instead of a real doctor and then you know that it hatched out and hatched out a bunch of neurotics and a bunch of gangsters listen god gave you that baby to love i don't care how bad you spoil it love it anyhow now the grandmas can use this quote amen grandmas amen there you go sister janet you got a quote i don't care how bad you spoil it love it anyhow what brother branham is telling us is the base the foundation for child training on uninterrupted unconditional uh unmerited love love and affection love and affection love and affection spoil that infant you're not gonna spoil the infant love it love it the pieces you do some more training as it gets older but not as an infant you're not training the child as an infant you're loving it he says god gave you that baby to love i don't care how bad you spoil it love it anyhow that's right love it if you don't love it now it'll grow up in a cold home and indifferent and it'll seek love somewhere or something it'll make it'll make an outline for somewhere mother take that baby and give it fellowship and love now make it a part of you which it is and act like it and hug it and kiss it and love it don't be too cold with the things of the world god gave you that as a treasure raise it right amen how many can say amen love it kiss it hug it cuddle it rock it sing to it what are you doing you're building security into that infant it's secure amen it's loved amen and when you start with security and unconditional love from then you can build to training but start by putting security into that infant you let a little baby just scream it out and cry it out you're going to build insecurity into that infant because they have no other way to get what they need than to cry for it but the english would say now the blessed thing here the reason i'm starting with this is because we're going to wind up with spanking so i bet i figured this was a good starting point if we're going to wind up with spanking i told my children i figured the best what would be best today is a live demonstration i want to know if one of them would volunteer they were willing to volunteer each other amen no live demonstrations i would also be in trouble with the grandmas all right now the blessed thing in here was talking to a young lady just a few moments ago that was suffering from a nervous condition and the nervous condition said she said now how she had tried to overcome it i'm not much of a christian science or unitarian i don't believe that there's anything like mind over matter i believe god is a healer that lady was born in that nervous condition her mother and father died when she was a child baby and raised up just tossed about everywhere and never had the proper love and care that a baby has and what did it start in her a nervous condition that she is going to need healed and delivered from you know mother i want to tell you something i know i got a little boy back there and he's really rankly spoiled he wasn't talking about the 19 year old this time he was talking about the infant he's really rankly spoiled but i would rather have him that way i believe it will make a better man out of him if god lets him live than to let him scream and cry and upset his little self listen a few years ago some normal modern witch doctor said that let that baby cry don't pick it up that's all all things like that don't let grandma touch it and you know what that hatched out you see what it is a juvenile delinquency a bunch of neurotics god made a baby to be loved that's why he made a mother to love a baby that's why we're supposed to be this way god made it that way and any time that you upset god's program you must remember you're wrong and will be wrong and as long as you're upsetting god's program following follow god's program do it the way god said do it amen love that baby love that infant you got that nathan and natalie i don't think you actually needed the quote but love it love that baby that security that bond is going to pay off for years to come there's got to be a bond that brings us security between mother and infant and father and child and mother and father and when there's that love that unconditional love that that that overwhelming secure love where the child is secured held comforted amen when it's whenever whenever it's distressed it's comforted whenever it has needs they're met amen you're building a security in the child and you're starting from a foundation of security and a foundation of love and from there you can begin training but if you start them insecure amen and without the right kind of love and affection you're gonna have you're gonna have difficulty down the road a lot of people have difficult situation oddities in their emotions emotional uh uh frailties and oddities because they didn't get the right kind of love as an infant but guess what we still believe god's a healer if you find yourself in that situation amen god's a healer he can heal that if mama didn't give you what you needed he can give you what you need if daddy didn't give you what you needed he can give you what you need if you recognize maybe tonight is the first time you recognize i struggle emotionally and i struggle in my nerves and now i recognize it goes all the way back i never had a mother that was an affectionate with me i never had a dad who called on me and loved me amen if that just hit you tonight he's still a healer tonight he's still the original parent and he can give you whatever you lacked from your earthly parent your heavenly parent is more than able to make up for it and once you recognize what the problem is all you have to do is say god you're the original father you're my original mother amen and my dad and mom may have failed me for whatever reasons may not even been that they knew what they were doing but i recognize they failed me and i need you to heal me from this condition i believe if you approach him that way with an understanding of what happened with faith as him as a healer that god is going to resolve that issue in your life and take away the effects of what was left out when you were a baby sometimes you don't even know what it was until something like this and all sudden something begins to trigger and if it just triggered for you there's a solution you don't have to go on the way you're going on and ephesians 6 and 4 says and you fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord i want to look at this scripture again now we're going to get into child training child rearing moving from infant to toddlers and on up we're not going to talk about teenagers or young adults we'll do that some other time but we're just talking about those young children we're moving from infant to toddler training them on up through the young child phase this word nurture means the whole training and education of children which relates to the cultivation of the mind and morals and employs for this purpose now commandments and admonitions now reproof and punishment so nurture it it's the full instruction which includes instruction teaching reproofs punishment admonitions and admonition or or exhortation which means counsel or warning against fault so so it's got the full instruction with teaching and correction but also the counseling the coaching the the warning the the preaching that goes along with it second timothy 3 16 says all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine teaching for reproof proving or convicting for correction which is restoring to a right state and for instruction in righteousness which is training nurture that includes the punishment as well punishing into righteousness correcting into righteousness so all scripture is given by inspiration of god is it profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness if you want to bring up a child right bring them up on the word have a word reason for why we do the things that we do have a word explanation for why we make the choices we make as a family i mean it's still appropriate to say because i said so i'm not going to take that away because that's still the word right honor thy father and thy mother that's still the scripture because i said so but as we're training a child we don't want it to always be because i said so because when they're 35 they're going to have to give you a call because they got no spiritual word instruction along the way so as we correct amen as we instruct we do it with the word amen we do it because the word says amen and that doesn't that doesn't mean you always have to give a ten part thesis on your child every time you give them instructions if anybody knows me knows i that frustrates me to no end i'm not going to debate my decisions but still we bring them up on the word on the word and the word is profitable for all of those things now i want to go back to seals trumpets and vials i taught this a couple years ago i went back and i looked at my notes it was 2017 july of 2017. so it's far enough back i can do it again but it's the principle of seals trumpets and vials and if we go and we're going to take this and apply it to child training and it works for more than child training if you're a supervisor at a job i've had some brothers tell me two of them now says hey i took what you said about seals trumples and vials and i used it at work and it works great because this is god's plan this is the way god deals with his children and god deals with his children if you look at the book of revelation and brother brahm types this through the church ages and seals trumpets and vials so we'll look at this in the sixth seal said the messenger the angel come on earth the messenger of the hour like luther's like any of the messengers that we've talked of what does he do he arrives and a seal opened reveals a trumpet sounds war declared and away they go and when the messenger dies he seals away this group they're put in and a plague falls upon those who rejected him so you see a seal a seal opens and reveals a trumpet sounds war is declared and then the messenger dies and then a plague falls on those who reject it so there's three these three things go together seals trumpets and vials seals is a mystery revealed don't forget we're talking about child training it's a mystery revealed and the first theory says here's the plan event the first thing that happened there is an announcement in the heavens first what happened a seal is open what is that a mystery is unfolded and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds so the first thing that that god does amen and he did this down through the church ages the first thing he does is he reveals something or he he breaks the seal or he opens up something that's in his mind so when we're training children the first thing we need to do to them is break the seal because they didn't come into the earth all knowing they're not born again and they don't know what you know like like sometimes i've had things that happen in our family i'm like what were you thinking why did you do that and i have to remember he's seven you know he's never done this before to me it's obvious but to him it's not so obvious to her it's not so obvious amen instead of just going straight to rebuke amen straight to chastising amen what we have to do first is break a seal and when something happens in immaturity and we realize wait a minute they don't know what's right or what's wrong in this choice they don't know what's godly and what's not godly in this choice the first thing i have to do in child training is first break a seal and reveal to them what's in my mind the way i want them to choose the way i want them to behave how to handle this situation there's no reason to correct unless you first broke a seal so we've got to teach the first thing we have to do is teach our children train them i'll say it this way we are always training our children everything we do every day is training our children we're either training them the right way or we're training them the wrong way but no instruction is still training so we're training and we're going to be responsible for the way we train so we might as well adjust our thinking to the fact that every day every interaction everything i'm doing is training my child i'm either training them to respect and reverent i'm training them to disrespect i'm training them to follow rules i'm training them not to follow rules but we're still training you'll find that some children are a piece of cake they have a compliant nature they're just born happy they're just born like a golden retriever they just want to make you happy and if they know what you want they'll do it if you like it you show them once they do the best they can to do it that way every time but some of them are born like a bulldog you know and they don't have that same nature so what do you do you keep breaking the seal you go to the trumpets you go to the vials you use god's plan some children are easy some children are harder but it doesn't change the fact they're still the children god gave to you and sometimes the easy children are the steps deceptive ones the children that aren't easy are are a piece of cake and one other way is you always know what's on their mind and you always know what they're thinking there's no guess you always know what's happening it's not done in secret it's not sneaky it's wide open right in your face you know what you're dealing with day one the compliant ones sometimes have learned how to make you happy and to make themselves happy at the same time they can be the dangerous ones and sometimes they're the ones that you shower the praise on and the other ones are the ones that get all the criticism but the ones you shower the praise on are making you happy and the preacher happy and grandma happy and they're in the bedroom doing whatever they're not supposed to be doing and keeping the whole show going so don't be deceived sometimes those easy ones are tricky you gotta the whole process is gonna take the leadership of the holy ghost you're gonna have to be discerning and let god lead and let the leadership of the holy ghost work through you as you train those children praise god so seals a mystery is revealed the trumpets a warning of judgment or war and you have to say why war because when brother branham talked about it through the church ages he said as luther broke a seal amen he broke a seal and gave the revelation of justification amen and it created a spiritual warfare amen and then when he was they were sealed away in that generation those rejected and a plague was poured out so i'll say like it is in the bible first he breaks a seal then when you come to trump it's trumpets or warnings of judgments or impending judgments or or warnings but it's also can be war when we come to your child amen not that you have war with your child but they begin to have war with themselves because once you break the seal and you tell them what to do now they've got a little nature that they have to resist and when you told them not to do that all of a sudden you broke a seal and and immediately the next time they face that situation war is breaking out now they're they're warring with that old nature to do the right or do the wrong do it mom said do what i want to do amen and a war breaks out amen but but then if they don't listen if they don't obey that's when you you sound the trumpet so we'll get into that here and god never even brings judgment upon the earth without first giving the people a warning god never does nothing without declaring at first that he's going to do and he gives people a chance and you can do right or wrong god can never change his nature his program can never change from what he started with because he's infinite and his program and his ideas are all perfect so god never brings judgment upon the earth without a warning who's the original parent god so first there's instruction we break a seal and then many times especially when you're dealing with toddlers and really young children there's levels of immaturity you know there's you can't set your expectations too high you got to make sure your expectations match the child and the age that they're at because we can have wrong expectations and all you're going to do is end up frustrating this child because this child doesn't have the maturity to meet the expectations but but when you understand where that child is and their age and their development and who you're dealing with amen and that god gave that child to you for a reason maybe to train you but god didn't make a mistake in putting these two together amen god that means that you're the tool that god is going to use mom and dad you're the tool that's going to shape this child so that means you have to be anointed you have to be led of the holy ghost but you have to believe that i've got what it takes to do this god put them with me because i'm the right one to lead i'm the right one to instruct or else god would have put this life somewhere else but god put this life here because i whatever it is god can use me to shape this child so the first thing we do is break a seal and bring instructions or something from our mind to the trial knows then when you see the child go the wrong way or make the wrong decision you sound a trumpet you blow a trumpet you give a warning that can be verbal or that can be come sit here for a minute and i remember what i told you remember when i broke the seal remember let's go to this room and talk okay now you come out you sound a trumpet amen trumpet is not bickering a trumpet is not nagging a trumpet is a good solid warning and that good solid warning might come with sitting here for a few minutes beside me you need to take a break and think about this you need to go back here and talk with me you need to come over here i want to i'm sounding a trumpet first i gave you the instruction now you're getting the warning the next seal trumpet vials the plague is being poured out brother behind said in this message i believe that the things that you see are taking place now as a preparation god is preparing something just before a climax god always warns the world and then if they will not receive warning then there's only one thing left that's judgment noah warned the world and they would not receive it and all through the age god always warned he sends mercy and if they spurn mercy there's nothing else left but judgment but the but the merciful father will send mercy first who's the original parent who's the model parent who would send a warning first before judgment first he'll break the seal then he'll blow the trumpet and if all of that is ignored then god will pour out the vial when the plague will hit so before we jump to chastisement we've got to go through a couple steps first before the child gets a spanking first there's got to be a breaking of a seal some instruction then there's got to be a good solid warning a trumpet and then if it's still refused then when we pour out the plague by the time we pour out the vial and the plague falls it is well deserved nobody's in question whether it should be administered or not you or the child everybody knows i mean you can even see after you've gone through this process with a child and they know what the process is of breaking the seal sounding the trumpet you can see them grimace as they do what they're not supposed to do because they know that the plague's coming and they and they deserve it is that right but we run into problems when we get out of god's program when we get out of god's program and we just decide to blow a trumpet blow a trumpet blow a trumpet blow a trumpet and we never broke the seal all we do is bicker and yell and bicker and yell and complain and chastise and criticize but we never took the time to patiently explain the behavior we wanted to patiently break what was our desire in our mind and take time to give instruction so that the child understands what is wrong what is right what you want done in this situation amen but you see parents all the time just yell yell yell yell yell but there's no instruction child touches this i meant stop that to just quit that touch this i told you not to touch but does the child know what he's allowed to touch and not allowed to touch has anybody stopped long enough to give an explanation and then you see trumpet trumpet trumpet now everybody's been in the grocery store and all you hear is trumpets i told you not to do that you can't have that i'm going to count to three and my goodness you count the three and you count the three and you count the three and the parents got good exercise and counting and the child has not changed their behavior one drop because all it is is trumpets but there's never a vial there's never consequences there's never the promised punishment it's never they've never gone through the whole process but if we do things god's way and we go through the whole process of breaking the seal sounding the trumpet then pouring out the vial it will absolutely work because that's the way god does it for us so he did it through the church ages that's why he does it in the book of revelation this is the way god does it and if god did it this way and we take his pattern as our own pattern and we do it by faith then we know that it will bring the right results let's go to revelation 16. we'll go to the vials revelation 16 start in verse 4 which is under the third vial there's some terminology here i want you to hear now when we get to the vials the world has already had the breaking of the seals signing of the trumpets there's been warnings that have been given through prophets now we come down to the end god's mercy has been spurned all the warnings have been ignored everything that god could possibly do has been rejected so now we finally come to the pouring out of the vials in the tribulation period and he says and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters and they became blood and i heard the angels of the water say thou art righteous o lord thou art and wust and shall be because thou has judged us all of a sudden the angel is declaring god righteous because he pours out the vile the proof of his righteousness is that he does what he'll say he'll do and when he says he'll bring judgment he brings judgments and the angel said thou are righteous because that thou art righteous sorry thou art righteous o lord which art and lust and shalt be because thou has judged us for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and now has given them blood to drink for they are worthy and i heard another out of the altar say even so lord god almighty true and righteous are thy judgments so by the time we get to the vials the angels declaring you're righteous because you judge this way and this judgment is true and righteous and if we deal with our children this way they'll even have to admit that you're right your judgments are true and righteous because you you you took the time to give the instruction they clearly understood what was wanted you took time and you gave a good sounding trumpet a good warning a good minor judgment a good precursor to judgment and when then that was rejected you poured out the plague and because you judged that way you're a righteous parent how many want to be a righteous parent then that's going to take some self-discipline there's no shortcuts here you know you see all the time when we shortcut this and short circuit this pattern we do a lot of damage we just bicker and yell at the kids but no there was never any time taken for instruction just yell yell yell trumpet trumpet trumpet amen the children becomes frustrated the parents become frustrated the whole loving relationship becomes frustrated remember we're going to build this foundation of child training on love but everybody's frustrated all the time because the child doesn't really know they've never been down this road before they're getting yelled at but they don't really know what they're getting yelled at before because nobody took the time to clearly explain what i'm supposed to be doing parents are getting frustrated because they think somehow the child should automatically know the biggest mistake that i've made in my life is just assuming my children know what i know like they've done things before and i'm like how could they possibly think that's right but i forgot i was seven years old and i didn't know you know so when we short circuit this program we begin to mess things up then when we skip the trumpet and we go from seal to plague what do you think that's going to do will your judgments be righteous will they be true and righteous because those judged this way no we can't go from seal straight to the vial pouring out the plague but if we go seals trumpets vials it'll work i had one man he became a new supervisor on the job and he said he heard this preached and he said he he went to work and he took a supervisor's position first time for him to be in any leadership in any kind of supervisory role and his boss wanted him to read a book on being a manager something like that and he heard this preached and he told his boss he didn't want the book and he applied this and he said it worked perfect because it does because it's god amen it's the way god did us if god's done us this way then it works [Music] look at this quote from handwriting on the wall and i've made this statement if this nation escapes judgment god will be obligated to raise up sodom and gomorrah and apologize for sinking them and burning them up for we are just as wicked as sodom and gomorrah ever was and if he sunk sodom and gomorrah and burnt them up because of their sin he doesn't deal and he doesn't deal the same way with us then he would be unjust and owe them an apology god doesn't have to apologize to nobody or nothing sin will be judged and it'll be punished just as sure as there's a god who can make judgment and god's judgment is holy god is holy and therefore his judgments and his work must be just and holy because sorry because it becomes a holy god for his works and his judgment so god's judgments are holy amen let's follow his pattern and do things the same way amen now i'm going to wrap up this evening we're going to look at a bunch of quotes on chastisement which is punishment which is corporal punishment for no nicer way to say it just a good old-fashioned spanking everybody's favorite topic corinthians 11 31 for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world oh there's a key why are we chastened why does god chasten us because we're his children we belong to him we're not somebody else's children you don't chase in the neighbor's child at least you better not you have big big problems that might have worked a hundred years ago it's not going to work today but when we were judged we are chasten of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world god has a goal and god has an objective in chastening us and if we're going to bring any chastisement to our children we have to have a goal and then we have to have a purpose for that chastisement and we have to know ahead of time what is it we're trying to accomplish because these are our children and we don't want them lost in the world we don't want them to go outside of god's boundaries we don't want them to go the wrong way amen this is the right way according to the word and through chastisement we're going to keep them in the right way because this is where the blessings are and then so we know now why we're chastised that's why we chastise in hebrews 12 he says and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth so who gets chastened the one he loves and every son he receiveth who gets chastened the children chastening is a good thing chastening shows love and chastening shows who the one being chastened belongs to the lord whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if he be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection into the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet praise be to god who's the model parent who are we modeling ourselves after he chastened us because he loves us he's chasing us because we're sons and he chasteneth us for our prophet for our benefit amen but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby praise be to god how many's been chasing of the lord how many can say his rod in his staff they comfort you you know if you'll get too far this way too far that way the rod will come down and he'll bring you back and he'll chase in you and you can say thank you god for chasing me it proves i have a father it proves i am a son it proves that he's going to chasten me so that i will not be condemned with the world and he chases me from my prophet let's take the same approach then and bring it to our children so that they can say the same thing my father loves me my mother loves me they're looking out for my best interest they love me and they want me to turn out right and they don't want me to be condemned and they're doing this for my prophet they may not say that when they're four but when they're 40 they may that's why you have to when we're talking about child trading you've got to have a far-reaching vision it can't be about the next five minutes because you're going to get tired because it looks like sometimes nothing's happening especially with a two and three year old you're dealing with a two and three year old and sometimes you do the same lesson five times in one day same lesson same lesson same lesson and you're thinking this isn't going anywhere but you just stick with it for a little while and in no time at all you're over that hump and on to the next one and it doesn't look like progress but it's progress it's progress one step at a time but you can't be focused on the immediate results you have to have a far-reaching vision if we're focused on the immediate results sometimes we come too hard too firm too angry because we want immediate results but really we got to have a far-reaching goal we're looking to the target and our target is not amen just to make life easier for ourselves for the next five ten minutes our target is to raise these children to serve god that at some point if the if the world should continue on and time should continue then i'm gonna take this little boy and this little girl and i'm gonna teach them how to serve god independent of me how to live their own life how to be responsible how to be obedient how to worship the lord and serve the lord how to be husbands and wives and raise children and be part of the church and take the position independent of myself and so we've got to keep that in focus when they're little and all the way through that we're actually raising them to turn them loose but if we do it right we get a lifelong benefit brother member says you're a father and a mother and you tell your children you go over there i'll give you a whipping if you love that child and he transgresses your laws you'll keep your word that's love and funny enough it relates to love in a child they can draw the equation if it's done correctly it relates to love you go over he said you go over i'll give you a whipping if you love that child and he transgresses your loss you'll keep your word that's right but if you let him go on well that's all right do it again see that's what makes all these here little melinda's and rickey's and so forth around that's what makes juvenile delinquency what makes juvenile delinquency parental delinquency giving idle threats with no meaning behind it threatening threatening threatening when nothing happens on the backside amen that creates child delinquency and it's parent delinquency because the parent doesn't have enough self-discipline to follow through with the threat if i can give you this advice this is another one of my failures don't give a threat you're not willing to follow up because i've done it before you do this and this this and this and they do it and all of a sudden i'm like i don't want to do this this and this it's inconvenient for me it's going to take a lot of my time it's going to i wish i wouldn't have said that all right so we've got to be careful that in the heat of the moment we don't just try throw out a bunch of really hard consequences to try to deter behavior because you're not going to deter behavior by just verbal consequences and what we're trying to do sometimes is we're trying to use our mouth to control our children and so we make it really bad you know if you do this you're not going to go anywhere you're going to sit right next to me and stand right next to me and blah blah blah blah blah and for two months and then you realize you've just changed yourself to that child for two months but what we're trying to do is we're trying we we don't really want to go through the process of proper training we're trying to shortcut it somewhere and when we shortcut it we end up frustrating ourselves and we don't follow through with the threat because the threat's inconvenient for us and then we're starting child delinquency because we're teaching them that my threat doesn't mean anything i just say but it doesn't matter maybe 50 it happens 50 is not hey a child is willing to take those odds half the time you do it half the time you don't well you know i never know this might be one of those times i get away with it you have some children that will never risk it on those odds those are your careful children you have some children that will always put it all on the table for that odd amen if you've raised more than three or four you know what i'm talking about all right so we got to be careful that we are as righteous as god is righteous in our judgments that we say what we mean and we mean what we say when we give instruction we give good clear instruction then when we follow it up with a trumpet a warning that whatever we threaten to do is something that we are able and willing to do right you're not able to withhold food from them for four days don't threaten to do that now i've threatened to make their life miserable but then i leave it open-ended i can choose whichever whichever method i want to make life miserable so you have to make sure as a parent especially with toddlers that you're always in control and the toddler is never in control i've seen parents you've been who's been in a grocery store you've seen parents who give the control to the child an argument breaks out in the cookie section i want oreos you can't have oreos okay put them in the bag put them in the bag just you be quiet who's in control sit down and be quiet sit down stay in the cart quick comments i told you to stay here take my phone here's a little game who's running the show the four-year-old is running the whole show the four-year-old through bad behavior and you guess what they're taught they're being reinforced every day that if i misbehave i get a reward if i scream and cry and embarrass my mom i get oreos if i won't stay in the car but i keep climbing out i get to play the phone you think you're crafty that four-year-old's got you outsmarted they're way craftier you're using intellect and reasoning they're going on raw beast instincts you're not going to out reason them they're working by instincts feed the flesh feed the flesh feed the flesh and you're trying to use reasoning and mental manipulation to control them it's not going to work don't ever let the toddler be in control you always be in control and sometimes when you're in public i mean chastisement doesn't always work in public you know what i mean you might have people asking you questions you don't want to answer so always be the adult and always be the parent and there's sometimes you've got to make a compromise in public but you say because i'm your parent i decided to let you do this this one time i'm going to allow this right now who's in charge sometimes you can't whack them right there it's not going to work but you've got to stay in control and there's sometimes that it is worth leaving a grocery cart full of groceries to take a trip to the van because you're looking at the future because you don't want another trip like this because i'm going to go through the grocery store and i'm going to get the groceries i want and i'm going to take as long as i need to and you're going to sit in the seat and you're going to behave yourself is that i mean is that beyond expectation for a toddler they should be able to sit in that seat and obey and listen i remember angie used to go to the grocery store with all five of them one in the car oh and they had rules i mean there's rules you don't touch anything you're not good you don't just touch it if you want to touch them you're asked to touch it you know like chaos you'd have the four toddlers running around grabbing anything that looked good to them and when they were real little they had to touch the cart so we were walking along everybody's got their hand on the car and we she'd walk by and people would just turn their heads like this is the most amazing thing i've ever seen in my life they're not running around they're not screaming they're not playing with their phone we didn't have smartphones then they're not getting their way everybody's walking doing what they're supposed to do when they got older and then she used to go down to the list and she'd be like you go over there and get that you go over get that and they're going to fetch and stuff and bring it back to the cart and get the next assignment and go and fetch it bring it back to the cart some mothers have to get a babysitter to go to the grocery store i mean that's okay if you've got like triplets that are infants but if you've got young children you shouldn't need a babysitter to go to the grocery store you should be able to train your children and take them to the grocery store you should be able to sit in a restaurant and eat a meal and the toddler should sit in the booster seat the other little ones that sit around and they should be able to sit there and enjoy a meal how many times have you been stopped in a restaurant and somebody says i just really appreciate how many times have you had a waitress say something to you raise your hand if you've had a waitress say something to you your kids are so good how do they sit here like you know they've never seen it and they've probably never seen it because the world has lost god's concept the world has so lost the image of god they have no understanding of what god's like no understanding of god's righteousness and that when they see it displayed they know it's right but they don't know where it comes from how many of you have unbelieving family yes sir and their kids are wild at family gatherings but yours aren't and your unbelieving family will say you're so lucky i love that statement yep it was just by chance thank god it worked out you have people who hate the message and hate this word but they love the results they love what it produces in the family and they'll say over and over your kids are so good you're so proud of you you guys have done a good job raising your you and your your husband your wife you love one another and blah blah blah blah blah but they but the minute you say well it's because of brother brandon he's a false prophet and that doesn't work you enjoy the fruit but you hate the tree [Applause] you know it doesn't work but this message should produce those kind of results that's the fruit people can see when you sit at a restaurant and eat when you go to the grocery store when your children aren't running around the parking lot and everybody else is worried they're going to get run over when your children listen when they do what you tell them to do when they when they obey when they naturally fall in line because you've been through the seals if they've had a trumpet they've had a plague poured out and they're not willing to go there again they're not in danger they're not irritating other people you know have you ever sat next to the kid who's swinging from the chandelier at a restaurant on the table screaming complaining never happy parents giving them and bought them special food they don't like that giving them their food and trying to get them an ice cream quick hurry hurry get them an ice cream i can't control this child are you ever interested in talking to that kid no way i've leaned over to my children before and seen one like that i said what do you think we should go over and spank him for him help that mother out show her what to do but you can't enjoy a child like that i may have had your children out and and it's usually the old people they always talk to them they want to talk to them why because you like kids that are well-behaved well-mannered in line they're likable kids you want to talk to them you want to be around them you want to spend time with them but the brats nobody wants nobody wants to be around them nobody wants to spend time with them and sometimes what we're doing is we're setting our children up for social problems because we're not doing child training we're setting them up for rejection we're setting them up for social problems because we're not doing the hard work of child training and it's hard work but you get a well-balanced well-behaved secure independent child out of the situation that people love to be around they're going to advance people are going to help them people are going to take time you know they're as they grow up and they become teenagers become young adults amen people are going to want to help them along people will put in a good word for them for a job people will help them advance people will help them in situations and give to them i've watched it in my own children i mean people pour stuff on them i look at them i said nobody ever gave me nothing people give you guys stuff all the time but i was a brat i was a latchkey kids parents were divorced raised by my mom she worked all the time and she was overworked and overstressed and me and my brother got away with things we shouldn't have gone away with i was a brat thank god for a conversion but i was determined not to raise my children the same way mom and dad together taking our time doing what we need to do but i've watched it work i've watched it pay huge dividends people will like your family and like your children why because the fruit is good fruit they don't have to know one thing about the bible but they know that's right they know what they see is right yes we've been in restaurants before waitress come up to me one time we were in a steak and shake and and a waitress come up to me and and it was time for the builder i don't remember how the conversation went ask for the bill and she goes no somebody already paid for your meal and that happened to us more than once people would come up to us and just give us a 20 bill give us something to say we want to pay for your meal and they would say things like we like your family or you've got good kids or something like that so it pays sometimes you would know who it was sometimes you didn't know who it was but you know what a tremendous blessing what is it it's the gospel fleshed out and on display it's god's pattern for a family and people like it but they don't know what it is they like see this is the way that our family should be this is the way we should be raising our children mom should be home raising her children that's the pattern that's what the bible says that's the way god said mom should be spending her time taking care of her children raising your children dad and mom you can't child train toddlers on the road you can't be out of the house every night burning up the roads dragging them from pillar to post and train your children properly when you got little tots you're gonna have to shut down your social life and spend time at home with your children because child training primarily needs to take place at home there are times during a meal that you may swat that child four or five times during that meal to keep them from throwing their fork on the floor do you know why you do that at home because you can't do it at steak and shake what do you do at steak and shake pick up their four give them another four say sorry to the people on the table next apologize to the waitress and if you try to raise your children like that you'll never have them keep their fork on their plate you got to do that at home so as parents you've got to make a sacrifice we have to sacrifice our social life we have to sacrifice all our wants we've got you know what you know what toddlers need they need a good sleep sleep schedule they need a good eating schedule they need nutritious meals so because they're growing they get tired they're growing fast they need good food on time they need a good environment and they need to be raised at home [Music] you can't be busy and raise those toddlers you've got to shut down the social life and spend time at home that doesn't mean you don't ever get out you don't have to become permits but the majority of your title training will take you at home and if at home you went through the lesson of four swats five swaths during a meal guess what happens the next day it might be two the next day might be one then you might not have to do it then you can take them to grandma's house and grandma will say that's the sweetest little baby i've ever seen because you did your child training at home we've got to make sacrifices to do these things right can't be gone every night got to be at home mama's got to be at home daddy's got to come home it doesn't work if mama's at home doing all the work and daddy's playing around with hobbies all the time got to be at home it takes a mother and a father they got to spend time together the family needs to be together the family needs to be at home and as they get older then you can start venturing out more and as you go out it gets fun it's it's so much fun to take your kids places take them to the zoo take them to this take them to that because they walk where you tell them to walk they stand where you tell them to stand they come when you tell them to come they'll go that you you can go you can set boundaries you can go to a playground and say okay you guys can play on this you can go on that don't go outside of these and you can sit on a bench and watch them and they're not going to leave that they're going to play they're free they're having fun you're free you're having fun you're enjoying your children and everybody else is enjoying it too so you can go you can do things after you've done your training at home after they know that your word is true after they know that that you'll follow up on what you say after they know what's right and what's wrong in different situations then you can begin to go out and explore and have some adventures and really enjoy those children you've got to do the child training at home when it comes to chastisement you gotta have wisdom you gotta know there's times when mom will go out and have a busy day and it happens she's gotta hit some garage sales go to this store stop by somebody's house and and we're gonna go back late and the little tot has missed his nap hasn't eaten he's two hours late for his meal missed his nap what do you think that child's going to do what do you think they're going to do when you go to put them in the car seat arch their back as hard as they can scream at the top of their lungs face turn red arms failing the temptation is going to be to chastise that child but the problem is not that the child is rebellious his child is tired and hungry you got to use parent wisdom as parents you can't push your toddlers too far and expect their behavior to hold up they don't have the strength the fortitude the emotional maturity for that you gotta use wisdom they need a steady sleep schedule good nutritious meals on time they need the freedom that they have at home and once you establish that you can start go start going further praise god we ready for more chastisement here it comes proverbs 13 24 he that spareth his rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him that be times that's many times so that not at bedtime sometimes it might happen at bedtime but this is many times so we're going to go through these scriptures and you're going to see that this the bible is really clear that that chastisement is is the rod the rod of correction now me myself this is just a personal note i always use the rod because the bible said rod so i'd always go to the hobby section of any store and get a little thin dowel rod when you're dealing with a two or three year old you can get a really really teeny down rod and as they get older you can up size and a real sign of growing up is to get a bigger spanking stick in our house the big kids got the big stick and the little kids got the little one but you the reason i like a rod is because the bible says rod and if there's any question i know why i'm doing what i'm doing and my kids know why i'm doing what i'm doing because the bible says wrong that doesn't make other forms wrong i'm not i'm not i'm not diminishing anything else brother branham said a a good old mammy a good old southern miami will take a barrel slat and wear out her girl so apparently a barrel slat's okay too but i just use the rod because because it's scripture proverbs 19 18 chasten my son while there is hope and let not thy soul spare for his crying these aren't the scriptures you read just before chastisement it makes each other sound like you're enjoying it but anyways chasten thy son while there is hope what do you mean wow they're little once they're looking you in the eye too late it's not going to work you got to catch them while they're little and i've heard this story told in child training i don't know where i heard it long ago but the story goes that a man was in a at a circus and he was walking by an african elephant and that african elephant was tied with a rope around its leg tied off to a pin drove in the ground and the man asked the elephant trainer says couldn't that big africa that big elephant break that rope or pull the pin out and he said easily he said well why doesn't he do it he said because when he was a baby he was tied by the same rope to the same pen and he pulled and he pulled and he pulled and he can never break the rope and he can never break the pin so he doesn't know that he can break the rope and he can pull out the pen chasing thy son while there is hope don't wait when they're two years old do this all the way through it's so much easier young you may feel like i mean i've had times i mean honestly i've had times when you're dealing with teeny little toddlers some of them are strong willed than others but i've had times when i'm like i cannot swap this child anymore today and you're not talking about a beating you're talking about a little rod with a little switch it stings it does no damage but i get to the point where five six seven times but guess what a week later you're not doing it you gotta stick with it until you get the desired results and it works what do we chastise for we chastise for rebellion if i could just make it as easy as possible we chastise for rebellion what is rebellion willful disobedience not forgetfulness not immaturity not because we're too tired or too hungry or sick see it takes some discernment as parents you have to know your child when your child starts to get sick sometimes my wife would always know before they actually broke out in the full-blown symptoms of fever and all this because of their behavior she says i think they're starting to feel bad she could probably do the same thing with me i don't know but you don't chase them if they're sick hungry tired or scared what are we chasing for we got to be really deliberate here when we're thinking because if we don't do this right we're going to create problems if you have a child who's frightening they're active because they're frightened and you spank them guess what you just did a whole lot of damage willful disobedience for rebellion willful disobedience when they know what they're supposed to do and they choose not to do it that's willful disobedience when they didn't know when they haven't been taught yet when they're not feeling well that's not willful disobedience but is when they're old enough to know no and what no means they're old enough to chastise amen chasing thy son while there is hope and let not thy soul spare for his crying that means don't say i just can't stand to hear him cry that's what that means proverbs 20 30 the blueness of a womb cleanses the way evil so do stripes to inward parts of the belly it's not talking about your stomach it's talking about your emotions the blueness of a womb cleanses away evil so do stripes the inward parts of the belly brother baby says sometimes i scold and go back home and just think lord why did i do it for i'll give you a little secret i do the same thing in the back room all the time why did i say it why did i say it that way why did i say it that hard listen what else he says but it's because i love them if i have to scold my little boy for running out on the street he'll get killed if i don't get him off that street sometimes i have to whip him correct him say son stay off that street it's not because i don't love that child it's because i do love him that's the way god has to do us scold us and shake us and make us real true person that lets his child just do anything is not a good parent that's right there's too much of that in america today and we need that old-fashioned mothers in fact i'm going to read this quote to you because i really like it brother ben says in the lamb and the dove from 1960. they talk about juvenile delinquency it's parent delinquency what's the matter then talk about the literacy of a kentucky some of them old mammies out there let their daughter come in the way some of them women do five o'clock in the morning and messed up over their face and their hair pulled out like that she'd take a limb off a hickory tree and she'd take the rest of her clothes off of her this is the prophet of the age take the rest of the clothes off of her and hide wit and the hide with it then call that illiteracy god knows we need some more memories like that that's exactly right i think he was a proponent of spanking you can't be a christian and not be a proponent of spanking it's the scriptures testimony on the sea and if you had a little boy now think of it lady you then i scolded a while ago you sisters with bobbed hair and things if you had a little boy sitting out on the street and you said junior dear you had better come in dear it might be i don't know they'll probably drive around you you don't love that child that's right you will get out there and shut the height off of him or make him come in that's right you love him that's the way the gospel is god loves you and those that he loves he chastens and rebukes every child that comes to him if you can't stand chastisement you go away and get angry about it then you're illegitimate children you're not the children of god so just remember it's just the scripture now say it for a reason because the natural types the spiritual and the spiritual types are natural god loves us and he chastens us and he rebukes us so that we won't be lost in the world and he says it and and i'll read it again he chases and rebukes every child that comes to him if you can't stand chastisement and you go away and get angry about it then you're illegitimate children i just want to inject this how is god going to chastise you in this day he's going to do it through the pulpit and then when you get mad because the preacher is preaching on something that you don't want him touching on i'm telling you there's a problem with that that doesn't mean every preacher ever said everything's right about it we're not going to give a license that's just a blank check but when he's talking the scripture he's starting to spread spirit scriptural principles and he's anointed by the holy ghost and says what he says you better listen because that's how he chastises the church now brother branham said in 1955 to seal the antichrist he said if the pastor is a good solid gospel teacher that will hold his children down and give them a little protoplasmic stimulation when they need it that's right lay the gospel down and spank them right good with it spank them right good with it you'll find a good obedient church that's right where people can come and enjoy themselves in the gospel if he's a good preacher that'll stay on the word and stay in the word and say it that way and see that his church is operated truly by the holy spirit not get off on these isms as soon as they start something he'll snap it out like that that's what we need today is some more preachers like that amen and what we don't need is for people to get mad at the preacher because the preacher preached against their compromise or their complex what we need to say is lord if that's you chastising me i'm a son and you love me and i want to be corrected like i said that doesn't mean everything a preacher says is exactly right but but there's got to be enough discernment to know if he's preaching the word and he's preaching the scripture amen and he's showing what the prophet and he's anointed of the holy ghost and he's been right all along let's not start picking and choosing forget chastisement let's take it as sons god has a rod and god uses his rod there's a scripture in deuteronomy 21 let's go to deuteronomy 21 together i just can't get over that take the gospel and spank them real good with it i thought the gospel was only for love chastisement is love sometimes we don't understand what love is deuteronomy 21 and 18 if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have chastened him will not hearken unto them then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out into the elders of his city and unto the gate and to the gate of his place and they shall say unto the elders of the city this is our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that he die so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all israel shall shall hear and fear is rebellion serious rebellion is serious in the eyes of god chasing your son while there's hope proverbs 22 15 foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of corrections shall drive it far from him they come into the world like this i know you don't believe that nathan and natalie they look so perfect but just give them some time that old fallen nature will manifest itself foolishness is bound in the heart of a child they come that way but the rod of corrections shall drive it far from him withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die thou shalt beat him with the rod and shout deliver his soul from hell how many want to save your children how many want to deliver their children's soul from hell see when we go to applying the token this is part of token life this is part of applying the token and if we apply the token with faith that it will take an effect on our loved ones this is fulfilling the scripture this is applying the token with faith out of the work the rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame that's the mama in the grocery store you're embarrassed for her it's a child left to himself now when you look at at spanking when we look at the rod of punishment around a rod of chastisement there's there's something that's important that i failed in before and god god really rebuked me for this i had a time where i was struggling with chastisement and i felt like i wasn't getting anywhere not with my own but with one of my family i felt like i wasn't getting anywhere and so i just said i'm not going to do this anymore it's not working and things got worse so one day i was in prayer i was on my knees and i was in prayer and i was praying i said god what should i do what do i do about this situation i don't know what to do and all of a sudden these scriptures i just gave you start flooding into my mind and i realized i had the whole thing wrong i had messed up chastisement because i was i was using the rod just to change behavior and when the behavior wasn't changing i lost faith in the rod but that's the wrong i'm going to say it this way that's the wrong reason for chastisement why do we chasten our children and why with the rod because god said to if it never changed behavior i would still do it because he said to and all of a sudden god smoked my heart and rebuked me and i repented right there kneeling at the couch and said god forgive me i left your word for human reasoning because i didn't see the results that i expected because i wasn't applying it by faith everything that's done must be done by faith that's why you don't have to spank harder and harder and harder and it turn into abuse to change behavior if you're doing that you don't have faith in the word of god that's how abuse gets started because you think this isn't working i have to apply more force and more force and it becomes abusive it's not about applying more force and more force and more force it's not the force that we have faith in it's the word of god that we believe now if we're going to apply the word we apply the word with faith if we apply the word for our salvation we do it by faith if we apply the word for our healing we do it by faith if we apply the word and chastisement we do it by faith and if you fulfill the word of god and believe the word of god because god said do this god is responsible to bring the results you don't have to apply more force you don't have to become abusive you don't have to lock your kids in a dungeon you don't have to become a tyrant you can go through seals trumpets vials you can apply chastisement according to the scriptures and you can rest in the fact that god will keep his word if he said amen apply the rod he shall not die they shall beat him with the rod and shall deliver his soul from hell you can rest that if i do what god said for me to do then god is responsible to make the word work and i failed because i was looking through reasoning and not by faith but by faith chastisement works but it's got to be done by faith you have to believe that this is right this is what god wants and that if i do this god will do what he promised to do that it will save my son save my daughter first samuel 15 23 for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity in idolatry rebellion is bad stubbornness is bad proverbs 29 17 correct thy son and he shall give thee rest yea he shall give delight into unto thy soul how many believe that let's all stand musicians if you could come brother tommy if you could come whatever we do we have to do it by faith correct thy son and he shall give thy rest he shall give thy soul delight you know what you're going to have to do to see that result you're going to have to believe it everything we do we do by faith we chastise according to the word of god by faith we don't that's why if if we really catch the concept right that's why you don't have to chastise when you're angry because it's an act of faith you don't have to wait till your blood pressure is at a certain level before you finally get out the rod but we stay in control all the time and we go through seals trumpets vials in control according to the word of god when we move to chastity we do it by faith we're not angry we're not trying to use the force of the stick to change the behavior we're going to we're going to use the rod according to the word and let god change the behavior because we're doing this by faith we're doing it because god said to and if we do what god said to then we'll get the right results do we understand amen i hope that's helpful i hope that clears some things up remember the foundation that we build child training on is love always love if you can handle chastisement right after you chastise a child you should be able to love them and they should be able to love you they don't have to like the chastisement but they can still like you and you can still like them when everything's done according to the word and by faith amen let's bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father for this word we just asked god that you would just forgive us lord first foremost forgive us for our failures we everyone fail lord we fail you we fail our children we fail one another but god we want to keep your word we want to do what's right lord we just pray that you would forgive us where we failed lord that we take these instructions and by your holy ghost you would give us wisdom on how to apply this in our homes lord that every child can be raised in a secure loving home that has the proper boundaries and instruction lord that they can be brought up to glorify your name that they can be bought up in a secure condition that they can hear the gospel because they're not in turmoil within themselves but they're actually at peace lord and they can hear the word and they can receive it lord god we believe your word we believe if we act upon your word that you'll keep your word so by faith lord we raise our children according to your scriptures knowing that you'll do what you promised we love you god we ask your blessing to be upon us bless every mother and father lord everyone who will be a mother and father lord i just pray that you give them wisdom let your spirit move upon them let them learn to trust the leadership of the holy ghost and child training help help them to take that word and apply it at home with tremendous faith lord that we might see the results we love you god we thank you for biblical instruction we thank you that you gave us a word to live by we thank you that you gave us an example as being the perfect model parent the original parent lord let us live as close to you as possible god let us sanctify ourselves as parents for our children's sake let us sanctify our home for our children say lord that we might bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord we commit ourselves to you we commit every family to you we commit every child in this assembly to you lord and ask that you would have your way and be glorified in jesus name we pray amen you know brother branham talked about applying the token if you have lost loved ones apply the token and we talked about that and that's a wonderful powerful thing but before you ever bring a baby home apply the token before before you ever start raising a child if you're here and you're young and you hope to be married someday apply the token now if you're if you're married and you're hoping to have a child someday apply the token now don't wait till they're lost in wayward and try to apply the token to win your family apply the token right now so that that child always lives in a token environment that that child always lives in an environment that's welcoming to the holy ghost where the word of god is being taught they're being admonished in the word where there's peace and harmony and love and rest apply the token now if you're single apply the token now if you're married apply the token now if you've got children at home apply the token now don't wait until you need it in a rescue mission proactively apply the token believing that it'll take an effect it worked on you that it'll work on your children [Music] amen god bless you let's sing a song brother you have a song
