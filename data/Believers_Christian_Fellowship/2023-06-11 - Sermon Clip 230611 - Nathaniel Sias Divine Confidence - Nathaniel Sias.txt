TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but what the devil wants to do is get you in a place where you're struggling and he can convince you that you're in a place that you're not this is always Satan's objective Satan doesn't care if you believe the word do you know that he doesn't care if you believe the word as long as you believe the word is applicable yesterday as long as you believe that God's word is only applicable Tomorrow Never today because when you as a Believer begin to believe that the word of God is applicable to you today the devil's in Hell tremble because they have to move there is Authority that is Jesus Christ when Jesus came to the man at the tomb he the the lesion that was in him not the man the man didn't know Jesus the man didn't know who Jesus was but the legion that was in the man at the tombs ran to Jesus and threw himself down they recognized Authority and Satan does not want you to have authority he will do anything he can to keep you away from Authority and you've come through sanctification and now the devil is going to work as hard as he can to convince you that you are sealed until the day of your Redemption and if you have the Holy Ghost sealed into the day of redemption and you are God is is working on you and you're starting in that growing that placing process called adoption God the holy spirit is there the tutor is there and he's teaching you you're now in this process the devil is going to come to you and tell you you're not sealed if you were sealed why are you fighting amen he will try to get you religious if you're not feeling religious if you're not feeling religious he well let me say it this way if you really haven't had an experience Satan is going to try to make you feel like the most religious person that's ever walked on the Earth and if you're a real son or daughter of God he's going to try to beat you down and make you feel like garbage because he wants you to believe that you are not Wherever You Are and confidence comes from knowing where you are and when you know where you are you know what to ask for Amen brother man I've talked about healing he said I know the Cure but I need to know the cause so he's praying and asking the Lord to show him the cause and when he understands the cause maybe that's sin in that person's life he could pray for his Spirit over and over and over and over again nothing happens the spirit won't move but then by discernment the cause is discerned the person has sinned in their life they repent of the sin and just like that they're free why because the Holy Spirit identified the cause now you're confident you know where you are and when you know where you are Satan is trying everything to make you believe you are not where God has placed you and if Satan can do that he's pulled a rug out from underneath
