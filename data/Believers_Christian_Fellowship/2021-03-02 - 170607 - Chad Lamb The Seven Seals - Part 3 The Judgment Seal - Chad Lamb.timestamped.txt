[1:27] god as it becomes more alive before our
[1:30] eyes we cannot help but
[1:31] just stare at you in amazement and
[1:33] wonder at all that you've done
[1:36] how after so many years you can continue
[1:38] to unveil yourself lord
[1:40] out of the same scriptures we've read
[1:42] hundreds of times lord
[1:44] out of the same message books we've read
[1:46] dozens of times
[1:47] but yet lord you continue to unveil
[1:49] yourself
[1:50] it just shows how amazing you are how
[1:52] there's no limits no boundaries
[1:55] the depths we cannot reach the bottom of
[1:57] your depths lord we can't climb to the
[1:59] highest of your heights
[2:00] but lord we're still trying to discover
[2:03] lord we're just trying to chase after
[2:05] you just to see you lord
[2:07] i pray that you would just continue to
[2:09] unveil yourself to us lord that you
[2:11] would take control of these lips lord

[2:17] let me see you let us all see you afresh
[2:19] tonight lord
[2:20] like we've never seen you before and
[2:22] that you would continue to draw us
[2:24] nearer to you
[2:25] for as we see you lord we see ourselves
[2:28] because we're looking at you as though
[2:30] we're looking in a mirror lord
[2:31] reflecting off of the word
[2:33] and i just pray god that you didn't make
[2:35] it clearer to us than it's ever been
[2:37] before
[2:38] we love you we give you our lives and we
[2:40] surrender unto you
[2:41] in jesus christ's name we pray amen

[2:50] have finally got a vacation plan for our
[2:53] family
[2:54] so we're going to be leaving in the
[2:55] morning and i literally
[2:58] made my reservation and booking last
[3:00] night at nine o'clock at night
[3:02] and i said i have never done this before
[3:04] my kids are like dad you're crazy

[3:14] know everything that's going to happen
[3:16] and this time it was absolute last
[3:19] minute
[3:20] crazy and i think we're going to have a
[3:22] wonderful time
[3:24] i think god's trying to break my mold a
[3:26] little bit and get me to loosen up a bit
[3:28] but
[3:29] we're excited so we just appreciate your
[3:30] prayers while i'm gone brother craig is

[3:39] so be praying for them and come
[3:40] expecting i also want to announce we've
[3:42] got some brothers traveling overseas
[3:45] coming up the following week brother
[3:47] craig and brother rich lavie are going

[4:14] through the 19th so
[4:16] they're just a long weekend but but i'm
[4:18] really excited about that trip also
[4:19] because they need to follow up with that
[4:21] little group
[4:22] that was started after brother kyle and
[4:24] brother
[4:25] elmer went there a couple years ago and
[4:28] so i'm just really excited to see what
[4:30] god will do there
[4:31] so please keep them in prayers i'm just
[4:34] excited because god is good
[4:36] and he's always doing something
[4:38] something always
[4:39] an organism is always moving and growing
[4:42] and
[4:43] shifting it doesn't stay stagnant when
[4:45] it stays stagnant we know it's beginning
[4:46] to die
[4:48] and we don't ever want to stay stagnant
[4:50] we want to keep flowing and keep growing
[4:51] and keep moving
[4:52] that's exciting i also want to make sure
[4:55] i remind everybody
[4:56] that this sunday is going to be our
[4:58] first summer potluck carry-in
[5:00] so uh we're taking care of the meat and
[5:02] the drinks
[5:03] sister mom and brother nate are really
[5:05] good at working on that but they could
[5:07] use some help cleaning up so just
[5:08] remember that keep that in mind
[5:10] volunteer services so that they can eat
[5:13] their meal
[5:15] and visit with people and then go home
[5:18] and then we'll take care of cleaning it
[5:19] up so god bless you if you want to help
[5:21] with that
[5:21] that'd be wonderful i only wish i would
[5:24] be here for that
[5:26] but lord willing we'll be at the next
[5:27] one
[5:29] so god bless you i want to get into this
[5:32] sixth seal which brother branham calls
[5:34] the judgment seal
[5:36] and and i started looking at the seals
[5:38] and and you know from the last couple of
[5:39] services that we've ministered
[5:41] that that god is really beginning to
[5:43] open some things up for me
[5:45] and another perspective and i just want
[5:46] to share these things with you
[5:48] and i got a feeling we're going to be
[5:49] here for a long time
[5:51] because it's very exciting we find that
[5:54] that brother branham's ministry
[5:56] is an exact match to the scriptures so
[5:59] like when you read this word
[6:01] this word is layered right you can read
[6:04] the scriptures
[6:05] and you can read the scriptures and you
[6:07] can get a moral code of conduct out of
[6:09] the scriptures
[6:10] and that's a good thing you can find out
[6:12] what you should do and shouldn't do
[6:14] you know what's wisdom what's wise
[6:16] what'll bring the blessings of god
[6:17] what'll bring destruction from god
[6:19] you can read this book and you can gain
[6:22] a moral
[6:23] code of of conduct for your life
[6:27] and that's good there's nothing wrong
[6:28] with that but then you can read
[6:31] this book and you can also see the path
[6:33] of the holy spirit from genesis through
[6:35] revelations
[6:36] what he's done before what he's doing
[6:38] now and what he'll do in the future
[6:40] that's wonderful also but you can keep
[6:43] going deeper in the layers of the bible
[6:45] until you get down and you can begin to
[6:47] unlock the mystery of who god is
[6:50] and then you can go down and you can
[6:52] begin to unlock the mystery of who you
[6:54] are
[6:55] so you can take this bible and you can
[6:58] read it at one level
[7:00] and maybe you can go to the next level
[7:02] but the children of god in the last days
[7:04] are keep going deeper
[7:06] and deeper and deeper in this word as
[7:09] it as it moves off a single dimension
[7:11] double dimensions
[7:12] it's 3d it's going beyond that it's
[7:14] becoming living
[7:16] living flesh living life all around us
[7:18] right and so
[7:19] we find the message of the hour is very
[7:21] much the same exact way
[7:23] because brother branham is a word
[7:24] prophet so you would expect
[7:27] if isaiah if isaiah the prophet could
[7:30] come and say something
[7:31] that would have multiple meanings over
[7:33] time
[7:34] and it would have multiple fulfillments
[7:36] and there'd be a natural and a spiritual
[7:38] type to what isaiah said
[7:40] what about when another word prophet
[7:41] comes on the scene will it be the same
[7:43] way
[7:44] i mean we're still reading isaiah and
[7:46] isaiah is still unlocking
[7:48] hyundai thousands of years later we're
[7:51] reading ezekiel and ezekiel is still
[7:53] unfolding amen
[7:54] haggai is still unfolding in the day
[7:56] that we live in
[7:57] and so what do we think is going to
[7:59] happen with the message
[8:01] he's a word prophet it's going to keep
[8:04] unfolding
[8:05] and so that's the way the revelation of
[8:07] the seven seals is
[8:08] because i remember i remember for years
[8:11] i've read
[8:12] the seals we love the seals and we all
[8:14] understand that the
[8:15] seven seals the revelation of the seven
[8:17] seals it is
[8:19] the climax of brother branham's ministry
[8:22] he's looking forward to it for years he
[8:24] talks about it
[8:25] he preaches it while it's going on he's
[8:27] saying this is just a tremendous week
[8:29] there's so many wonderful things are
[8:31] happening he's saying are you catching
[8:33] what's going on
[8:34] i mean he's telling you what a marvelous
[8:35] event this is
[8:37] and then he gets beyond the seals and
[8:38] he's continually pointing back to him
[8:40] and saying that that was it you know
[8:42] that was the highlight of my ministry
[8:44] that was
[8:45] you know and after that he starts saying
[8:47] things like you know
[8:48] i must decrease he must increase and and
[8:51] there won't be two of us here at the
[8:52] same time and
[8:53] he's saying things at the at the end of
[8:56] his ministry but he's always pointing
[8:57] back to the seals
[8:59] but i have to confess when when i would
[9:01] read through the seals
[9:02] i would take you know first seal second
[9:04] seal third seal
[9:06] and you begin to read through it and you
[9:07] begin to notice that brother branham is
[9:09] him hauling around
[9:10] and and he's telling stories and and you
[9:13] know i went and prayed for this person
[9:15] today and
[9:16] and all this and and all this stuff he's
[9:18] telling
[9:19] and then he gets to the actual facts of
[9:22] the seal
[9:23] the the this word means this and this
[9:25] happens in this time
[9:26] and this will happen in the future and
[9:28] he preaches the whole seal in like 10 or
[9:30] 15 minutes
[9:33] and then after he goes back to telling
[9:35] stories and him hauling around
[9:37] and and i'm thinking he could have
[9:39] preached each seal
[9:41] in 10 or 15 minutes right
[9:44] am i the only one who thought that and
[9:47] we realized
[9:48] this is like the most important thing
[9:50] that he did was priest of revelation of
[9:52] the seven seals
[9:53] he said the whole bible is bound up in
[9:55] those seven seals
[9:56] and the revelation of the seven seals
[9:58] reveals the whole entire bible
[10:01] and how could he unlock the whole bible
[10:05] in 15 minutes a night
[10:09] and i began to realize that the stories
[10:12] are parables brother branham is
[10:16] teaching the seals exactly the same way
[10:20] jesus taught the seals because jesus
[10:22] taught the seals in matthew 24
[10:24] and he starts talking and he's laying
[10:26] out the seals and he gets down
[10:28] and as soon as he finishes the sixth
[10:30] seal he doesn't say anything about the
[10:32] seventh seal
[10:33] and as soon as he's done he says now
[10:35] listen to the parable of the fig
[10:37] tree right
[10:41] when the fig puts forth its buds know
[10:43] that summer is nigh
[10:45] and the and the disciples are sitting
[10:47] here they've got questions they want
[10:49] answers to
[10:50] and here he's he like covers the whole
[10:52] seals
[10:53] in just a few verses and then he starts
[10:56] into parables
[10:57] telling parables and the parables are
[10:59] revealing the seals
[11:01] the parables he's telling you what he's
[11:04] trying to get you to catch
[11:05] but you have to understand that when
[11:07] jesus was there
[11:08] in matthew 24 he was speaking to the
[11:11] disciples they asked a question and he
[11:12] was revealing parables
[11:14] and the parables were telling more of
[11:16] the story but he wasn't speaking the
[11:18] parables
[11:19] for the disciples sake because the
[11:21] disciples never understood what he was
[11:23] talking about
[11:25] there was never a day until this day
[11:28] that we know what it means when the fig
[11:30] tree puts forth his bud know that summer
[11:33] is nigh
[11:33] because now we know that's when israel
[11:36] moves back into the homeland
[11:37] and becomes a nation again so now
[11:41] jesus was giving the parable and he was
[11:43] giving the seal but he wasn't doing it
[11:44] for the crowd that was listening
[11:46] he was doing it for you and i
[11:51] could brother branham have preached the
[11:53] seals the same way
[11:55] he's a word prophet amen say it's the
[11:58] same thing
[11:59] over and over once you see the pattern
[12:01] the pattern repeats
[12:03] the most important thing in the
[12:04] scriptures is to catch the pattern
[12:07] to see what god's doing brother branham
[12:09] in the sixth seal
[12:10] said this this is all just christ and
[12:12] antichrist
[12:15] what's he saying he's saying the whole
[12:18] revelation of the seals
[12:19] the whole revelation of the bible the
[12:21] whole thing is revealing christ in
[12:24] antichrist
[12:24] because back in heaven before there was
[12:27] the earth created there was rebellion in
[12:29] heaven
[12:30] and lucifer and his angels rebelled
[12:32] against michael and his angels right
[12:34] and that battle came down to earth and
[12:37] what we're seeing in genesis through
[12:39] revelations
[12:40] is christ and antichrist battling it out
[12:43] genesis exodus levitic what are they
[12:45] doing it's christ an antichrist
[12:47] all the way through that's why when
[12:48] brother branham gets to the seals
[12:50] he says this is just christ an
[12:52] antichrist
[12:53] why he's revealing the whole story of
[12:56] the bible
[12:58] and see theologians make big time
[13:01] mistakes when they start reading the
[13:02] bible
[13:03] and they start trying to find the
[13:04] history get the archaeology to match the
[13:06] history that's in the bible
[13:08] and the order of the kings and and get
[13:10] all the details just like we used to do
[13:12] to the seals
[13:13] get all the details and the historical
[13:15] events and where it placed and
[13:16] what it all means and to get it all
[13:18] lined up and they missed the story
[13:22] because it's a story of redemption it's
[13:24] a love letter
[13:26] it's a story amen of what was in the
[13:28] back part of god's mind what he wanted
[13:30] to accomplish
[13:30] i mean that's why i love christ as the
[13:32] mystery of god revealed so
[13:34] much brother branham comes down and he
[13:36] doesn't load you down with facts and
[13:37] figures and details and dates
[13:39] he's telling you the story he's telling
[13:43] you the theme
[13:44] of this entire bible is one theme
[13:47] one idea one objective that god wanted
[13:50] to accomplish and it had three parts to
[13:52] it
[13:54] and so now you can listen to christ as
[13:56] the mystery of god revealed and you can
[13:58] go back
[13:59] and he says if you can't find christ in
[14:01] every line and every verse read it again
[14:03] why it's the whole thing is christ
[14:07] crowd is christ christ is the mystery of
[14:10] god revealed
[14:11] so whenever the mystery of god is
[14:13] revealed that's christ
[14:17] that's why you're christ and i'm christ
[14:19] because we're part of that mystery of
[14:21] god
[14:22] being revealed in this day so we are
[14:24] part of that
[14:26] and so now what brother branham's doing
[14:29] is he's telling
[14:30] us the story and we've been looking for
[14:33] the facts
[14:35] the details the same thing the
[14:37] theologians have done to the bible
[14:39] is the same thing i'm guilty of in doing
[14:41] to the seals
[14:42] not that i did it on purpose and not
[14:44] that i've done it intentionally
[14:46] but i just didn't know what to do
[14:47] because god has a timing for everything
[14:50] god has a revelation that has to come in
[14:52] the final days
[14:53] there has to be a rapturing faith that
[14:55] comes to the church
[14:56] and i would pose this question to you is
[14:59] it possible
[15:00] to come to rapturing faith before the
[15:03] time of the rapture
[15:06] why because rapturing faith will rapture
[15:09] you
[15:11] there's nothing that can hold back
[15:13] rapturing faith that's why when you have
[15:15] faith for your healing
[15:16] there is nothing that can stop your
[15:18] healing
[15:19] because everything in the kingdom of god
[15:21] operates by faith
[15:23] so once you receive rapturing faith you
[15:25] will take a rapture
[15:28] so god has to keep a cap has to keep a
[15:32] veil
[15:32] until the time is right till the last
[15:34] one comes in so he can peel back this
[15:37] veil
[15:37] so his bride can take a rapture all at
[15:39] once it doesn't do any good for somebody
[15:41] to rapture 20 years ago
[15:43] amen and then me to rapture today and
[15:45] somebody else 20 years from now
[15:47] that's not that's not the way the
[15:48] scripture is written so we have to say
[15:51] i i had to say god show me what i'm
[15:54] missing in your time in your season not
[15:58] not that we twist and manipulate till we
[16:00] get it figured out but
[16:02] as you reveal more we walk into it as
[16:05] the leather layer peels back we step
[16:06] into that layer
[16:08] and we enjoy that layer because hey that
[16:10] just explains
[16:11] the the last 50 years of the message has
[16:13] been peeling back another layer
[16:15] and the believer's stepping into that
[16:17] layer and enjoying everything and then
[16:19] peeling back another layer and stepping
[16:21] into the layer
[16:22] and we're doing the same thing now it's
[16:24] going to continue
[16:25] until we all come to rapturing faith and
[16:28] take a body change
[16:30] so that's why i want to spend some time
[16:32] on these seals
[16:34] and so we look at the judgment seal
[16:38] and we recognize we we all know
[16:41] the sixth seal so i'm not going to go
[16:43] into the the details of the facts of the
[16:46] future of the six seals because you can
[16:48] read those and you know those we know
[16:50] that the sixth seal cracked open at
[16:53] world war
[16:53] ii and brother branham didn't say it
[16:57] closed back
[16:59] it cracked open because tribulation
[17:02] began
[17:03] at world war ii the sixth seal and it
[17:06] carries through
[17:07] to the time of the great tribulation and
[17:10] when it when it
[17:11] opens wide open in great tribulation and
[17:13] brother branham said what opens that
[17:15] seal
[17:16] he said those two witnesses in
[17:17] revelations 11 moses and elijah
[17:20] that go to israel they open up that seal
[17:24] because under that seal plagues fall out
[17:26] upon the earth
[17:27] and and it's given to those two to bring
[17:30] plagues upon the earth
[17:33] so they're the ones who open that seal
[17:35] wide open they're the ones who bring on
[17:37] tribulation
[17:39] it's beautiful so then we find out
[17:44] that the sixth trumpet and the sixth
[17:46] seal
[17:47] sound at the same time because the sixth
[17:50] trumpet
[17:50] is the second woe there's three woes
[17:53] after the fourth seal
[17:55] whoa whoa whoa and to the habitants of
[17:57] the earth and that's world war one
[17:59] world war ii and world war three we're
[18:01] not laboring on this i'm just giving you
[18:03] a snapshot
[18:04] world war one's the fifth seal world war
[18:06] ii is the second seal
[18:08] so if the if this or the sixth deal i'm
[18:10] sorry the second world war is the six
[18:13] sixth trumpet so if the sixth trumpet
[18:16] is world war ii and the sixth seal
[18:20] cracked open at world war
[18:22] ii persecution against the jews then the
[18:25] sixth trumpet and the sixth seal run
[18:27] together
[18:28] okay we talked about this sunday where
[18:30] the seventh is revealed in the sixth
[18:33] that's the way it always was through the
[18:34] bible so these are
[18:36] these are the facts and the details and
[18:38] we know that plagues have come upon the
[18:40] earth
[18:41] and under the sixth seal there's going
[18:42] to be a purging of the earth a
[18:44] destruction of the people
[18:46] a destruction of the planet to get the
[18:48] earth in condition for the millennium
[18:51] so that's all under the sixth seal from
[18:53] the world war ii everything that's
[18:54] happening
[18:55] and we have to realize everything that's
[18:57] going on around us
[18:58] is under the effect of the sixth seal
[19:01] we put it back here in world war ii and
[19:04] we try to put it over here
[19:05] in the tribulation period but we don't
[19:07] realize that sixth steel cracked
[19:10] open and it began to move things in
[19:12] place
[19:13] what did it begin to do it began to
[19:15] unite world powers
[19:17] it began a war and it began pushing the
[19:20] jews into their homeland
[19:23] and we're still under the effects of the
[19:26] sixth seal
[19:27] the six seals cracked open and it's
[19:29] still working and it's still moving
[19:31] along with the sixth trumpet and so we
[19:34] can't we don't wanna put this
[19:36] over here we don't wanna put this over
[19:37] there we're living in the effects of it
[19:41] amen so don't ever don't ever put these
[19:44] things somewhere else
[19:46] let's take these things home and say why
[19:48] what
[19:49] what is going on for me what is going on
[19:51] today
[19:52] what is going on in my life because
[19:55] brother venom said the revelation of
[19:57] this
[19:57] of the seven seals he says it it reveals
[20:01] the whole bible
[20:02] we got that now
[20:06] the bible is christ
[20:09] in word form in letter form we got that
[20:14] then paul looks at his disciples and he
[20:17] says
[20:18] you are written epistles
[20:21] he said the word is written not in
[20:24] tables of stone
[20:26] but in the flesh in the fleshly hearts
[20:28] right
[20:29] so now the word is written in you
[20:34] and you become the living word or the
[20:36] manifestation of the word
[20:38] and now you're the word
[20:41] right so if the seals unlock the mystery
[20:45] of the entire scriptures
[20:47] and you've got scripture in you and
[20:49] you're part of the scriptures
[20:51] and there's word in you and you're part
[20:53] of the word then the seals must also
[20:55] unlock your life
[20:58] so the seals reveal the word and you're
[21:01] the word the
[21:02] seals have to reveal you
[21:05] and so there's so much more going on
[21:07] when brother branham's preaching the
[21:09] seals
[21:09] than just the information about the
[21:11] tribulation period
[21:13] that's super important and we need to
[21:15] know that but there's something for me
[21:17] today
[21:18] there's a mystery unlocking my life in
[21:21] the sixth seal and the judgment seal
[21:23] that i will understand me better and my
[21:26] purpose on this planet
[21:27] and what god is doing with me and how my
[21:30] word is being unveiled
[21:33] hallelujah oh who wants to go read the
[21:36] seal book all over again
[21:39] i mean it's not just the facts and it's
[21:41] not just the figures
[21:43] i'm the word this reveals the word this
[21:45] takes the mystery off the word
[21:47] it takes the mystery off of me
[21:50] now i can look back over my life and
[21:52] understand every transition
[21:54] everything i'm going through it all
[21:56] makes sense because i'm part of the word
[21:58] and god works with me like he works with
[22:00] his people in the word
[22:01] so what he did with ruth he does with me
[22:03] what he did with esther he does with me
[22:05] amen what he did with this he does with
[22:07] me and if i could see the seals unlock
[22:09] the mystery and ruth it'll unlock the
[22:11] mystery in me
[22:14] because once god sets the pattern he
[22:16] keeps the pattern
[22:17] pattern doesn't change hallelujah
[22:22] god it's amazing to me that when brother
[22:25] branham preaches the seals he starts
[22:28] with god hiding himself in simplicity
[22:31] and revealing himself the same
[22:33] it's the all you have to do is see the
[22:35] pattern
[22:37] and the pattern repeats it's so simple a
[22:40] child can understand
[22:42] but the problem is right here we make it
[22:45] so
[22:45] complicated by trying to figure the
[22:47] dates and the sequence of events and
[22:49] and we're missing the story you can do
[22:54] the same thing with the bible
[22:55] sequence of events and this king was
[22:57] before that king and chronicles has this
[22:59] name and kings has this name
[23:01] what are the dates and and you're
[23:02] missing the whole point
[23:05] not so that you can have an accurate
[23:07] knowledge of history
[23:08] of the of the jewish lineage of kings
[23:10] that's that's not the point
[23:12] the point is to catch the mystery in the
[23:14] word the point is to catch christ in the
[23:17] bible
[23:17] to see that this is the unveiling of god
[23:20] this is christ
[23:21] moving down through the ages god coming
[23:24] into materialization and materialization
[23:26] so that he can be seen
[23:27] and felt and heard from and known
[23:31] hallelujah praise god
[23:36] hallelujah so so when we look at this
[23:41] sixth seal the judgment seal we have to
[23:44] realize
[23:45] and i know i'm not taking the seals in
[23:47] order i know you have first second third
[23:49] and i know i've talked about the seventh
[23:50] seal
[23:51] for a couple services and now i'm
[23:52] talking about the sixth seal you just
[23:54] have to forgive me
[23:56] i can only go by inspiration i can't
[23:58] mechanically go to the first seal
[24:00] and work forward this is where i'm at
[24:03] and i this is what you got
[24:06] so i i don't even think we'll do them
[24:07] all backwards i don't even know where
[24:08] we'll go from here
[24:09] but i know we've done the seventh and
[24:11] we're going to do the sixth
[24:13] or at least take a take a little look at
[24:15] it tonight
[24:16] so for the sixth seal brother branham
[24:18] preaches a message i believe it was in
[24:20] 1953 called israel in the church
[24:22] and way back in 1953 he sets a pattern
[24:26] and that pattern has to continue and the
[24:29] pattern is israel and the church are on
[24:32] parallel tracks one natural one
[24:34] spiritual
[24:35] and he and he shows us this in the first
[24:38] exodus
[24:39] what happens in the first exodus happens
[24:41] at the second exodus
[24:42] what happens in the second exodus
[24:44] happens in the third exodus
[24:46] so we find out now paul picks up this
[24:49] same thing and he says
[24:50] in hebrews he says now these things were
[24:53] written for our examples
[24:56] what what happened to israel now paul is
[24:59] preaching
[25:00] amen he's preaching to the new testament
[25:02] church
[25:03] and he's saying the same thing israel
[25:06] and the church
[25:07] that they type one another that they
[25:09] parallel one another
[25:11] so what you see god doing with the with
[25:13] israel
[25:14] he does with the church and so now we we
[25:18] can take this principle
[25:19] and it and once the pattern starts it
[25:21] never stops pattern repeats
[25:23] we got that this is simple stuff pattern
[25:26] repeats
[25:27] so now if there was a first exodus there
[25:30] has to be another exodus
[25:34] so so now we find in the seals
[25:38] if we look at the natural of the sixth
[25:40] seal the sixth seal cracking open had a
[25:42] purpose
[25:44] and world war ii had a purpose and what
[25:47] did brother branham tell us the purpose
[25:49] of world war ii was
[25:51] he said it was the tender hand of
[25:53] jehovah
[25:55] driving the jews back into their
[25:57] homeland
[25:59] so that they could eat of the tree of
[26:01] life
[26:04] so if that's what he was doing for the
[26:06] jews what is the sixth seal doing in my
[26:08] life
[26:10] hallelujah and then we realized too that
[26:13] the sixth seal
[26:15] when it comes in fullness under the
[26:17] plagues in the three and a half year
[26:18] tribulation
[26:19] it's purging the world it's destroying
[26:22] all that that needs destroyed and
[26:23] cleaning off the earth
[26:24] and renovating it for a millennium now
[26:28] in the natural if the sixth steel the
[26:30] judgment seal
[26:31] will take the earth the natural thing
[26:34] and destroy it and purge it and cleans
[26:36] it for a millennium
[26:37] what is it doing to my soul what is it
[26:40] doing to me
[26:41] is the judgment seal now we're coming
[26:44] the scripture says judgment must begin
[26:46] at the house of god
[26:48] so we can't ever say that judgment is
[26:50] not for the church judgment is
[26:51] absolutely for the church but the great
[26:54] white throne judgment has nothing to do
[26:55] with the bride
[26:57] but the scripture says judgment must
[27:00] begin at the house of god
[27:03] we got that so we have the judgment seal
[27:07] the sixth seal working in our life
[27:09] and if the six seal works in our life
[27:11] and it burns you down
[27:12] and it tears you to pieces and it pour
[27:15] plagues out upon you
[27:16] all it's doing is renovating you for
[27:18] your rest holy ghost
[27:20] rest the millennium is a type of the
[27:22] holy ghost
[27:23] so you cannot come to the holy ghost
[27:26] without passing through the sixth seal
[27:28] you cannot get to the millennium
[27:32] so we find out that we ourselves
[27:35] have to pass through the judgment seal
[27:38] now the seals are unlocking the mystery
[27:40] in my life
[27:41] i remember coming to the message
[27:43] desperately seeking the holy ghost
[27:45] and i remember being renovated
[27:49] i remember agony and distress and
[27:52] travail of soul
[27:53] i remember knowing that i was all wrong
[27:55] and i remember knowing that i was never
[27:57] going to be right
[28:00] i remember realizing there is no good
[28:03] thing in me no
[28:04] not one that wasn't a scripture verse
[28:08] that was my prayer why
[28:11] i was under the sixth seal i was under
[28:14] the judgment seal amen the hand of god
[28:17] was coming down on me in conviction and
[28:20] what was happening
[28:21] he was trying to renovate me for the
[28:23] millennium
[28:25] for my holy ghost rest i was going to
[28:27] move into rest
[28:28] but you cannot move into rest without
[28:31] the sixth seal
[28:32] and you cannot have the sixth seal
[28:34] without judgment and repentance and
[28:36] recognizing
[28:37] how fallen you are and how desperately
[28:39] you need him
[28:40] and how you're nothing it will never be
[28:42] nothing and you're deserving of all the
[28:45] plagues that are going to be poured out
[28:46] in your life
[28:47] and you deserve every single one of them
[28:49] plus more
[28:51] and if you come to that then you're
[28:53] being renovated for the millennium
[28:55] then you're on your road to entering
[28:57] into the rest
[28:58] now recognize that when when solomon
[29:02] now i i i don't have very many notes
[29:05] i don't have a well laid out plan all
[29:08] i've got is a heart that is absolutely
[29:10] full
[29:10] so if you're poor i may jump all over
[29:12] the place but i want to paint this
[29:14] picture for you
[29:15] when solomon comes into his throne if we
[29:17] remember when brother abraham myra was
[29:19] here
[29:20] and he was preaching on these things
[29:22] brother uh brother
[29:23] uh abraham taught to us about solomon
[29:25] coming to the throne
[29:27] and solomon is the son of david and so
[29:29] israel and the church
[29:32] so solomon is only typing christ taking
[29:35] the throne of david in the millennium
[29:39] and so we find out when solomon comes to
[29:42] his throne
[29:43] solomon cannot move the church
[29:46] into millennium he cannot bring them
[29:50] to the seventh seal until first solomon
[29:53] passes the church through the sixth seal
[29:56] because david david never passed
[29:59] judgment on the israelites the man who
[30:03] spit on him he let him go
[30:05] all right joab who killed abner he let
[30:06] him go all of these things he let go
[30:09] he never brought judgment because the
[30:11] scripture says
[30:13] that god giveth all judgment to the son
[30:17] so once he sets the pattern he keeps the
[30:20] pattern
[30:21] if god is going to give all judgment to
[30:23] the son then
[30:25] david has to give all judgment to
[30:27] solomon
[30:28] and so now solomon comes on the scene
[30:30] and david said
[30:31] don't forget jimmy i don't forget joab
[30:35] don't forget those don't forget them why
[30:38] because he's given all judgment to the
[30:40] son
[30:42] don't you love the word of god catch the
[30:45] pattern
[30:46] pattern never changes so now
[30:50] solomon has to begin judgment
[30:54] at the house of god solomon's not
[30:56] judging philistines
[30:58] or hittites or any other nation solomon
[31:01] now
[31:01] is judging israelites he's purging the
[31:04] church of all the spirits
[31:06] that came against god all right
[31:10] and after he purges them all and he has
[31:12] this period of judgment
[31:14] what happens to the nation of israel
[31:16] they move into a millennium
[31:19] why because under the judgment of
[31:22] solomon
[31:22] he brought them through the judgment
[31:24] seal the sixth seal
[31:26] so that they could enter into rest
[31:30] the pattern never changes
[31:34] that's happened to israel that's going
[31:36] to happen to the whole world
[31:38] but what happens to you and i yeah
[31:41] brother branham said whenever we come to
[31:43] church on sunday every sunday is
[31:45] judgment
[31:46] we come to the judgment seat every
[31:48] sunday so that our lives can be judged
[31:51] by the word
[31:51] so that we can look at this word and say
[31:53] god burn me down
[31:55] i am no good there is nothing good on me
[31:58] why because every time you come to the
[32:00] sixth seal
[32:01] you get a fresh revelation of the
[32:02] seventh
[32:04] every time oh if you think about this
[32:07] pattern is established in the scriptures
[32:10] if you go back now the seals reveal the
[32:13] mystery of the whole bible right
[32:15] so now we understand moses's life
[32:19] because moses could never come to the
[32:20] burning bush until
[32:22] first he at first he had to be rejected
[32:25] amen he had to go into the wilderness
[32:28] and he had to be in the wilderness under
[32:30] judgment for 40
[32:31] 40 years 40 is the number of judgment
[32:34] and after he passes through the sixth
[32:35] seal
[32:36] then he sees the pillar of fire in the
[32:38] burning bush he comes to isaiah 6
[32:41] he gets cleansed with a coal of uh
[32:44] off of the fire off of the altar and he
[32:46] gets recommissioned and he goes back
[32:48] and look what he does after the six seal
[32:51] judgment
[32:52] that he couldn't do before
[32:56] this is the pattern the pattern never
[32:58] changes
[33:00] look at samson samson was born to be a
[33:04] deliverer
[33:06] all right and he began to deliver from
[33:08] the philistines
[33:10] but you have to understand that the
[33:12] pattern
[33:13] has to hold true
[33:16] so so samson he does things that are
[33:19] wrong things that are not right right so
[33:21] he comes into judgment
[33:22] and we find him under the sixth seal and
[33:25] he's grinding at the meal
[33:26] with his eyes poked out he's working for
[33:29] the system
[33:31] all right he has no revelation no
[33:34] eyesight
[33:35] working for the system laboring right
[33:38] but what happens he begins to get a
[33:41] fresh revelation of the seven seals
[33:43] growing out
[33:44] of his head and after he's come
[33:47] to tribulation after he has come to
[33:50] judgment
[33:51] after he's come through the sixth seal
[33:53] then
[33:54] he gets a fresh revelation he gets back
[33:57] in his commission like isaiah did
[33:59] see none of these men these all of these
[34:01] men that were talking about
[34:03] isaiah leaning on uzziah right having to
[34:06] come to a fresh revelation
[34:07] woe is me a fresh commissioning same
[34:10] thing with moses
[34:11] same thing with samson same thing with
[34:13] the apostle paul they were all god's men
[34:16] before the sixth seal and they were all
[34:18] god's men
[34:19] after the sixth seal samson comes out
[34:23] and he has a revelation and he comes to
[34:26] repentance
[34:29] sixth seal always brings the children of
[34:31] god to repentance
[34:33] that's the key is repentance
[34:36] isaiah come to repentance samson come to
[34:38] repentance
[34:39] these men come to repentance and and he
[34:42] says
[34:43] god forgive me samson comes then
[34:47] and it says when he gets his
[34:48] recommissioning after sixth seal
[34:50] it says he killed more in his death than
[34:53] he killed in his life
[34:55] why he came through the sixth seal
[34:59] the apostle paul the apostle paul
[35:02] comes on the scene he's smitten by a
[35:05] pillar of fire
[35:06] he's struck blind ananias comes and lays
[35:09] hands on him
[35:10] and it says right there he immediately
[35:12] goes into the synagogue and preaches
[35:13] christ
[35:15] right he has no success so he's got to
[35:18] go
[35:19] to the wilderness for three and a half
[35:21] years in the wilderness of arabia
[35:23] before he can get the proper commission
[35:25] for his ministry
[35:27] so here he he he comes to the lord he
[35:30] he's filled with the holy ghost
[35:31] he goes right out and he begins
[35:33] preaching in the synagogue but we find
[35:36] out
[35:36] something didn't go right something
[35:38] wasn't right because he had to go into
[35:40] the wilderness in arabia
[35:41] for three and a half years amen but when
[35:44] he came out of there look at his
[35:45] ministry
[35:48] something changed for moses something
[35:50] changed for samson
[35:51] something changed for the apostle paul
[35:55] if you think of all the disciples now
[35:57] every one of those disciples
[35:59] they they hear the call from god jesus
[36:02] christ
[36:02] calls them himself they enter into the
[36:04] ministry they're casting out devils
[36:06] wonderful things are happening but
[36:08] they've got to come to the sixth seal
[36:11] so now their chief captain they see him
[36:14] hanging on a cross
[36:15] and he's dead and he lay him in a tomb
[36:17] and now they are all going through
[36:19] tribulation
[36:20] they're all going through judgment peter
[36:22] is a perfect example we watch peter
[36:25] the crows three the third time he
[36:27] runs out and he weeps bitterly
[36:29] what is he's under judgment peter's in
[36:32] the sixth seal
[36:34] and once he starts to pattern keeps the
[36:37] pattern now you see why the seals
[36:39] unlock the mystery of the bible
[36:42] now we see the pattern pattern holds up
[36:45] peter's in the pattern
[36:46] but what's going to happen is is peter
[36:49] is going to get a
[36:50] fresh revelation and he's going to get
[36:52] it at pentecost
[36:56] and after the fire falls amen at
[36:58] pentecost
[36:59] and he's burnt with a coal off of the
[37:01] fire of the altar
[37:03] amen then look at peter's commission
[37:06] then
[37:08] see the pattern never changes pattern
[37:11] keeps up
[37:11] keeps going pattern never stops so now
[37:14] we find that this judgment seal
[37:17] is so much more it's so much
[37:20] more than just the tribulation period
[37:24] right the scriptures talk about talk
[37:27] about a lot of these things
[37:30] brother branham says in the message i
[37:32] know he says why does god
[37:34] god let troubles come god harnesses
[37:37] trouble
[37:38] puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey
[37:40] him
[37:41] and those troubles bring us into a
[37:43] closer fellowship with god
[37:46] there had been no rainbow until the
[37:48] flood came but after noah was pressed
[37:50] into that condition that he was in now
[37:53] think about this
[37:55] no one was pressed into the condition
[37:57] that he was going to see the rainbow the
[37:59] covenant of the lord after he's pressed
[38:01] in that condition
[38:02] what did the sixth seal do to the jews
[38:05] it pressed them into a condition
[38:08] what was it doing for the believer
[38:11] judgment and tribulation
[38:12] puts them in position
[38:15] what did it do in your life put you in
[38:18] position
[38:19] and when you get out of position and the
[38:21] chastening hand of the lord comes and
[38:23] brings judgment
[38:24] what is he doing he's putting you back
[38:26] in position
[38:28] this is first corinthians 11 judge
[38:30] yourself
[38:31] but if you're judged we're supposed to
[38:34] judge ourselves
[38:35] but if we fail to judge ourselves when
[38:37] you are judged you are chastened of the
[38:39] lord
[38:39] that you will not be condemned with the
[38:42] world
[38:44] god's chastening is not to condemn you
[38:46] with the world if you do not come to
[38:48] judgment on your own
[38:49] then the sixth seal comes upon you
[38:51] afresh and the chastening of the lord
[38:53] comes
[38:54] so that you will not be in position with
[38:56] the world
[38:57] but that you'll get back in position
[38:59] with the word
[39:02] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[39:06] the whole word is built on this cycle
[39:10] all of the scriptures my life is this
[39:13] cycle
[39:14] this plays out daily weekly in my life
[39:18] we've had major six seal events in our
[39:20] life but then we have minor six seal
[39:22] events in our life
[39:24] amen and it's always it's always you
[39:27] come to the chastening hand of the lord
[39:29] you come to repentance you come back to
[39:31] woe as me
[39:32] i'm i'm a man of unclean lips dwelling
[39:35] among a people of unclean lips
[39:37] and what happens he always puts you back
[39:40] in position he put isaiah back in
[39:43] position
[39:44] he put samson back in position he put
[39:47] moses
[39:48] back in position he put the disciples
[39:50] back in position
[39:53] do you see the pattern and we thought we
[39:56] were just getting in trouble
[39:59] we thought we were just making a bunch
[40:01] of mistakes
[40:02] it's the beauty of the sixth seal for
[40:04] the believer
[40:05] for the unbeliever it brings destruction
[40:09] for the believer
[40:11] it brings positional placement
[40:16] the seal does both for the unbeliever
[40:21] they're going to march right into
[40:22] destruction why because
[40:24] cain come under the hand of the sixth
[40:26] seal and what was cain's response under
[40:28] the sixth seal
[40:31] when when when isaiah comes under the
[40:35] hand of god
[40:36] he says woe is me
[40:39] when samson comes under amen the sixth
[40:42] seal
[40:43] he repents when cain comes under the
[40:46] judgment the judgment seal
[40:49] he says this is too hard for me
[40:53] you see the difference now judge your
[40:56] life
[40:57] are you cain
[41:00] or are you isaiah
[41:03] when things come down in your life god
[41:05] don't you know what's happened god this
[41:07] is too much how can you expect so much
[41:09] of me
[41:09] you're speaking just like cain
[41:13] and the seals have come to unlock the
[41:15] mystery of your life
[41:18] to put you in position to explain to you
[41:20] where you are
[41:21] and the plan of god are you on
[41:23] antichrist side or christ's side
[41:25] right and that way when now when trials
[41:29] come upon your life
[41:30] and this chastening hand of the lord
[41:32] comes to you amen now
[41:34] you don't say god this is too much god
[41:36] you're asking more this is more than i
[41:38] can bear
[41:38] why is this all happening now you say
[41:42] woe is me lord
[41:45] i'm wrong correct me lord make me right
[41:49] forgive me almighty god because if you
[41:51] can come to that point in the sixth seal
[41:53] you'll step right back into the seventh
[41:55] seal
[41:56] yes hallelujah do you see the pattern
[42:01] so simple a child could understand we
[42:03] could teach our
[42:04] our children this and they could start
[42:06] unlocking the mysteries out of the bible
[42:09] by revelation why because he
[42:12] he gave it to children to babes
[42:15] not to the wise and the learned but the
[42:17] babes and he said it in such a way
[42:19] that he could give a revelation and you
[42:21] get the key and when you get the key you
[42:23] just start unlocking
[42:24] unlock unlock unlock and lock and now
[42:26] all the doors fly open
[42:28] now we begin to understand things we've
[42:30] never understood before
[42:32] now our life becomes it starts to come
[42:35] in order
[42:36] it starts to make sense i start to
[42:38] comprehend
[42:40] solomon's bringing to me to millennium
[42:43] and before solomon
[42:44] can bring me to millennium he's got to
[42:46] purge the church
[42:48] and before god can bring me to
[42:50] millennium christ has to purge
[42:52] my church hallelujah
[42:57] thank god brother branham starts off the
[43:01] sixth deal
[43:02] i just want to i would really like while
[43:04] i'm on vacation if as many of you could
[43:06] start reading this
[43:07] this revelation of the seals please
[43:10] start reading it
[43:11] and start reading it a different way
[43:12] than we've ever read it before
[43:14] or at least a different way than i read
[43:16] it before start reading it and saying
[43:18] god
[43:19] let me see your story let me see your
[43:23] mystery
[43:24] but brother branham gets to paragraph
[43:27] three
[43:28] the very first thing he's saying right
[43:30] after he says hello
[43:32] he he does a real quick prayer right
[43:34] after he does the prayer he says
[43:35] you may be seated so good evening
[43:37] friends it's a privilege to be here
[43:39] again tonight to be in the service of
[43:40] the lord
[43:41] i was just a bit late
[43:44] i just went on an emergency of a dying
[43:46] man of a member of this church his
[43:48] mother is or comes here
[43:50] and they said the boy is dying right
[43:52] then so here he's coming to preach the
[43:55] sixth seal
[43:56] the judgment seal he prays he says be
[44:00] seated
[44:01] and he says i'm a little bit late
[44:03] because i was
[44:04] called out on an emergency for a dying
[44:06] man.
[44:10] it sounds like the man's in judgment
[44:15] and he says they said the boy is dying
[44:17] right then i went down to see
[44:19] a shadow of a man laying on a bed dying
[44:22] a man about my age and in just a
[44:24] moment's time i seen a man rise to his
[44:26] feet
[44:26] giving praise to the lord and so god
[44:30] if we will be willing to confess our
[44:33] sins and do that which is right
[44:36] ask for mercy call upon him god is
[44:39] willing and waiting to grant it to us
[44:43] he steps to the pulpit praise be seated
[44:47] and the first thing he tells is he
[44:49] reveals them the sixth seal
[44:52] there's a man laying here dying but i
[44:56] seen him in a few minutes ago from a
[44:57] dying man to raise you on his feet
[44:59] and if we will just repent and confess
[45:02] our sins
[45:03] and ask for mercy what is he telling us
[45:06] he just revealed the sixth seal in our
[45:09] lives
[45:10] in his opening statements and this is
[45:13] the part where i thought he was just him
[45:15] hauling around to get to his 15 minutes
[45:17] of explaining the seal
[45:19] missing the whole time this is exactly
[45:22] what he did when he come out and he
[45:23] began the whole series of the seal
[45:25] meetings
[45:26] with god hiding himself in simplicity
[45:28] and says i was just a little late
[45:29] getting the pulpit i had to marry a
[45:31] couple
[45:33] the whole thing's a wedding and then he
[45:36] goes right into the dedication of the
[45:38] church
[45:39] because he's dedicating the church
[45:42] and now he's doing this through the
[45:44] whole seals he gets to his ceiling he
[45:45] goes now did you recognize what was
[45:47] happening
[45:49] in the seals he's preaching the
[45:51] atonement right he's preaching christ
[45:53] who is the atonement
[45:55] coming on the scene the revealing of
[45:56] christ christ coming down
[45:58] and he says that little boy who was
[46:00] healed of
[46:01] leukemia he said did you catch that that
[46:03] little collins boy and then
[46:05] did you catch that healed leukemia
[46:07] what's leukemia
[46:09] leukemia is a blood disease what's being
[46:12] cured the blood disease
[46:14] the atonement cures the blood disease
[46:18] christ being restored to the church in
[46:21] full measure the holy ghost and fullness
[46:23] coming down
[46:24] is curing the blood disease and brethren
[46:27] he's not just telling stories
[46:29] he's not just jesus walking along they
[46:31] ask him a question
[46:32] he says i'll tell you a parable
[46:35] [Laughter]
[46:37] oh god open our eyes let us see what's
[46:41] going on all around
[46:42] us hallelujah oh i just love it friends
[46:48] he said in the sixth seal in paragraph
[46:52] 249 it's the eagle age that gets the
[46:55] word and the revelation
[46:57] and all that understands that raise up
[46:59] your hands that's good that's fine
[47:01] he said if you can get back here under
[47:03] these seals
[47:05] when they're open you can see exactly
[47:07] what god
[47:08] is doing what he has done and what he's
[47:11] going to do
[47:14] hallelujah is he not jesus christ the
[47:17] same yesterday
[47:18] today and forever is this not an eternal
[47:21] word
[47:22] with an eternal application and he says
[47:25] if you can
[47:26] if you can get back under these seals
[47:29] when they're open you can see exactly
[47:31] what god is doing
[47:32] what he has done and what he's going to
[47:35] do
[47:36] i say god show it to me reveal it to me
[47:39] afresh
[47:39] give me fresh eyes to see because why
[47:43] this is all christ an antichrist
[47:46] so what what am i trying to understand
[47:49] i'm looking at this
[47:50] these seals and they're unlocking the
[47:53] bible
[47:53] and i'm seeing christ and antichrist in
[47:55] every story in the bible
[47:59] remember once he sets a pattern he
[48:00] doesn't change it
[48:02] so if i can see what antichrist has done
[48:06] and every one of the believers down
[48:07] through and how he's brought deception
[48:09] then he's going to do the same thing
[48:11] today
[48:12] if i can see his tactic his battle plan
[48:15] his mode of operation
[48:17] then i can see in every age how christ
[48:19] countered it
[48:21] and now i can judge myself i can judge
[48:24] my condition
[48:25] and i can place myself in the scriptures
[48:28] why because the seals
[48:29] unlock christ and antichrist all the way
[48:32] down through the word
[48:33] they unlocked the battle plan of lucifer
[48:35] and the battle plan of michael
[48:37] and now i know lucifer is going to do
[48:39] this every time
[48:40] and christ is going to do this every
[48:42] time
[48:46] hallelujah
[48:48] i'm excited i just i feel like i want to
[48:53] go somewhere
[48:54] and read my whole bible over again
[48:57] cover to cover whole bible whole seven
[49:00] seals church age book
[49:01] and then i want to read it all and then
[49:02] start right back at the beginning read
[49:04] it all again
[49:05] because it is so absolutely wonderful
[49:07] and beautiful to see
[49:10] now brother branham is talking about
[49:14] the sixth seal and he's talking about
[49:15] tribulation and the calling out of the
[49:17] hundred forty four thousand and the two
[49:18] witnesses
[49:19] in in the in the great tribulation right
[49:21] that's what the sixth seal is about
[49:24] but he spends so much time talking about
[49:26] other stuff
[49:28] i mean like over an hour's worth of time
[49:31] and one of the main stories he gets into
[49:33] first is he starts talking about
[49:35] uh the tribulation period and 145 then
[49:38] he starts talking about
[49:39] you know there was that story of that
[49:42] armor
[49:42] boy whose dad owned the ranch in texas
[49:45] and he went down to look for a wife
[49:49] we're talking about the sixth seal
[49:50] tribulation period 144 000 we call it
[49:53] two witnesses
[49:55] right right so if all we understand on
[49:58] the sixth seal
[50:00] is the tribulation period the calling
[50:01] 144 thousand
[50:03] what is he talking about
[50:06] he goes down there and all the girls
[50:09] were fixed up and he didn't want any of
[50:10] them and he
[50:11] went out to look at the stars what is he
[50:13] talking about
[50:16] look at the stars and and he sees this
[50:18] washery woman
[50:19] and she's a cousin to all of them and
[50:21] she's an outcast orphan
[50:23] and he sees in her character and he says
[50:25] i wanted character not in any of them
[50:27] will you marry me
[50:29] and she she says yeah it's too much for
[50:32] me how can you and he says i've chose
[50:33] you i'll build you a house
[50:34] i'll come back and get you what story is
[50:37] he telling
[50:39] telling the story of christ and the
[50:40] bride why the six deals about the 144
[50:43] 000 and the two witnesses in the
[50:44] tribulation period what's he talking
[50:46] about
[50:48] he starts breaking it down and he starts
[50:50] saying now
[50:51] after he left she starts confessing and
[50:54] they start laughing at her
[50:56] making fun of her what's happening she's
[50:59] moving into persecution
[51:02] she's moving into her tribulation period
[51:05] and they say laughing and as that got
[51:06] closer
[51:07] she got her wedding dress and they saw
[51:09] her wedding dress and they laughed and
[51:10] said you silly child he's not coming for
[51:12] you
[51:12] and she's holding her confession what is
[51:14] it he's showing what the world council
[51:16] of churches
[51:17] is going to be doing to the bride under
[51:20] the influence of the sixth seal
[51:23] but the six seals about the tribulation
[51:25] period and two witnesses 144 thousand
[51:28] then why does he spend over an hour
[51:30] talking about everything but that
[51:34] why israel and the church
[51:37] natural and spiritual these seals unlock
[51:41] unravel the mystery of the scriptures
[51:44] and they unlock the mystery of your life
[51:48] so now now
[51:51] if you only if i could only preach
[51:55] it's like brother abraham he said i wish
[51:57] i was a preacher and i said oh my
[51:58] goodness
[52:00] if you're not a preacher i'm not even
[52:01] human you know
[52:04] and so i just brother bam said i wish i
[52:06] could give it like he showed it to me
[52:08] you know you're so limited as a human
[52:09] being
[52:10] but but if you can only see even the
[52:13] things
[52:13] that have been happening in my life over
[52:15] the last week i'm
[52:17] recognizing now that god is showing
[52:19] everything in shadows and types i'm
[52:21] seeing it all over the place
[52:22] it is an amazing place to be but you're
[52:25] seeing
[52:25] how this little woman now takes the
[52:27] promise and she takes the promise and
[52:30] she just starts repeating what her mate
[52:31] has told her
[52:32] the promise he's coming for me i'm
[52:34] chosen from him
[52:35] and all she's doing is just repeating
[52:38] what he said
[52:40] not her own words she's repeating what
[52:42] he said and it brings persecution from
[52:44] all the cousin churches the rest of the
[52:47] family turn on her
[52:49] and they begin to condemn her and
[52:51] chastise her
[52:52] and mock her why brother branham is
[52:54] showing
[52:55] what the world council of churches is
[52:57] doing to the bride
[52:58] and it gets worse as the time gets
[53:01] closer for her departure
[53:05] because if you go through the sixth seal
[53:07] you get the seventh
[53:12] what does the sixth seal do to the jews
[53:14] it puts them in position for the tree of
[53:16] life
[53:17] to receive the messiah what does the
[53:19] sixth seal do to you
[53:21] it puts you in position why because i
[53:24] rod in my staff they comfort me
[53:26] why because you're in laodicea with a
[53:28] fallen outer two realms to your being
[53:30] with a sticky cockleburn nature
[53:32] and you will backslide and get lazy and
[53:35] cool off
[53:36] but god will put you in position
[53:41] god will get out the sixth seal god will
[53:43] bring down the judgment
[53:45] and solomon will come to your life and
[53:47] he will start casting this out
[53:49] and casting that out and you'll fall
[53:51] back to woe is me almighty god forgive
[53:53] me
[53:54] and then he'll touch you with a coal off
[53:56] of the altar and put you back into your
[53:58] commission
[53:58] and you'll come back out wiser more
[54:01] dedicated
[54:02] more sincere and god that what's he
[54:05] doing
[54:05] amen he was only solidifying those all
[54:08] the persecution from the cousins
[54:10] all the pressure that was coming from
[54:12] outside was only solidifying her
[54:15] confession
[54:17] purging her from every other thought
[54:19] standing on this one
[54:21] thought he's promised me he's coming for
[54:23] me i must have the wedding dress on when
[54:25] he gets here
[54:27] what's he doing with us he's purging us
[54:30] he's focusing us
[54:31] and if he's got to use a rod he'll use a
[54:33] rod if he's got to use the world council
[54:35] of churches he'll use the world council
[54:37] of churches but he's got to get us
[54:39] in one position he's coming for me one
[54:42] thing to confess
[54:43] one thing to focus on he promised he's
[54:45] coming i've got to have the wedding
[54:47] dress on when he gets here
[54:50] hallelujah why
[54:53] it's under the influence of the sixth
[54:54] seal
[54:56] we're under the influence of the sixth
[54:58] seal
[54:59] what's he doing putting his people in
[55:04] position
[55:06] think about this he tells job
[55:10] he said i smite
[55:13] and i bind up i bruise
[55:17] and i heal who's saying that
[55:20] god
[55:25] you know job's having this issue
[55:28] and job's saying why is god letting this
[55:31] happen
[55:32] job didn't say one thing about the devil
[55:36] he didn't blame the devil he didn't
[55:38] accuse the devil he didn't give the
[55:39] devil any credit
[55:40] he said god's hand is upon me
[55:44] now think about this in the in the
[55:46] prophecy of joel
[55:47] when when there was sent out four
[55:48] insects the palmer worm the canker worm
[55:51] the
[55:52] locust and whatever caterpillar he sent
[55:54] them out
[55:55] and the god said mine great army that i
[55:59] send forth
[56:02] what did they do they destroyed the
[56:04] bride tree
[56:08] why did they destroy the bride tree
[56:11] because in the first
[56:12] age they began to deviate from the truth
[56:14] so god sent an army to tear it down
[56:16] so that he could rebuild it correctly
[56:20] and so he says mine great army that i
[56:23] send forth he tells job
[56:27] i smite i break
[56:31] and i mend i bruise and i bind up
[56:35] why this is god's pattern
[56:39] he's the good shepherd the good shepherd
[56:42] has a rod
[56:43] and the rod is to keep the sheep in
[56:45] position
[56:47] because it matters more than anything
[56:49] that we stay in position
[56:51] under this word confessing he's coming
[56:53] with the wedding garment on
[56:56] it's the thing that matters most in your
[56:58] life nothing else matters your
[57:00] retirement account doesn't matter
[57:01] your health doesn't matter your children
[57:04] don't matter as much as staying
[57:06] in position amen staying where you're
[57:09] supposed to be
[57:10] under the word in the body where you are
[57:13] supposed to be working that is the only
[57:15] thing that matters
[57:18] that's why if you begin to bring
[57:20] compromise into your life
[57:22] because we want to make the children
[57:23] more comfortable right
[57:27] god god is not here to make you
[57:29] comfortable your children comfortable
[57:31] god is not here to make your life a
[57:33] pleasure cruise
[57:34] he is here to get you in position
[57:38] to awaken you out of your spiritual
[57:40] amnesia
[57:41] to open the word to you to put you in
[57:43] position under that word
[57:44] and to keep you there till you manifest
[57:46] what you were designed to manifest on
[57:47] this planet
[57:48] god is not here for pleasure he's not
[57:50] here for entertainment he's here
[57:52] you're here to serve his purpose not
[57:54] yours
[57:55] god is not here sometimes when we have
[57:57] all this modern worship music that's
[57:59] nothing but the rock and roll and
[58:00] sensual and worldly
[58:02] i wonder who who is receiving glory in
[58:05] this worship
[58:06] who's being pleased whose pleasure is
[58:08] this is it pleasing the one being
[58:10] worshipped or is it pleasing the
[58:12] worshipper
[58:13] and we find out most of what is called
[58:15] worship is only satisfying the
[58:17] worshipper
[58:18] it is not doing anything for the one
[58:19] being worshiped and we realize that we
[58:22] can fall in the same trap in our lives
[58:24] our lives are supposed to be a life of
[58:26] worship
[58:27] a life of sacrifice
[58:32] you can reign with him if you suffer
[58:35] with him
[58:37] the bible doesn't say anything else amen
[58:41] and so now now we find out that we can
[58:44] worship god
[58:46] in a way that satisfies the worshipper
[58:51] i can live in compromise i can still be
[58:53] a message believer
[58:55] i can just deviate ever so slightly on
[58:57] his word because it makes me
[58:58] uncomfortable to toe the line
[59:01] so i find a way that's more comfortable
[59:03] for me to be a believer
[59:04] and i confess the message and come to
[59:06] church but i'm still a little bit
[59:08] comfortable
[59:08] and what you find out is you've deviated
[59:11] from the word and he will send his great
[59:13] army
[59:13] and you will get the palmer worm the
[59:15] cankerworm the caterpillar
[59:16] and the locust will tear you down to
[59:19] nothing so that he could bring you back
[59:21] up because you're out of commission
[59:24] you've missed the calling you're out of
[59:27] the word a slight deviation is out of
[59:29] the word
[59:31] and so now we find that god is
[59:34] constantly positionally placing us
[59:36] and we keep saying the devil's doing
[59:38] this the devil's doing this
[59:39] the devil doing this and god is trying
[59:42] to put us
[59:43] in position we're blaming the devil
[59:48] job didn't blame the devil so we're
[59:52] beginning to recognize
[59:53] the sixth seal is beginning to open our
[59:56] eyes to our world
[59:58] we're beginning to understand who we are
[1:00:00] and where we are
[1:00:01] and what we're supposed to do further in
[1:00:05] the message i know
[1:00:07] he says i don't even know where i'm at
[1:00:17] praise the lord he said
[1:00:21] must i be carried home when i to heaven
[1:00:23] on a flowery bed of eaves while others
[1:00:25] fought to win the prize and sailed
[1:00:26] through bloody seas
[1:00:28] we ask for comfort and peace god gives
[1:00:30] us the best he could give us
[1:00:32] the sixth seal trials and tribulations
[1:00:38] that's better than comfort and peace our
[1:00:40] comforts is just beyond the river
[1:00:43] it wasn't until the hebrew children was
[1:00:45] forced into the fiery furnace on one of
[1:00:47] their most outstanding trials
[1:00:48] that they seen one like the son of god
[1:00:51] stand among them
[1:00:52] their troubles produced the son of god
[1:00:55] standing among them
[1:00:57] amen i ask you do you want the son of
[1:01:00] god standing among us
[1:01:02] then get ready for the fiery furnace
[1:01:09] but not until they went into the fire
[1:01:11] did the comforter appear
[1:01:13] it was daniel who had purpose in his
[1:01:15] heart that he had not defiled himself
[1:01:16] with the things of the world and was
[1:01:17] forced through a trial
[1:01:19] whether he'd pray to god or go to the
[1:01:20] lion's den but it was
[1:01:22] after it was after that he saw the angel
[1:01:26] of the lord standing in the midst of him
[1:01:27] keeping away
[1:01:28] that great pillar of fire standing
[1:01:30] between him and the lions and the lions
[1:01:32] could not get him because he'd went
[1:01:33] through the trials and temptations and
[1:01:35] troubles
[1:01:36] he knew that his god was able to deliver
[1:01:38] him from that
[1:01:40] it was abraham after he'd seen the
[1:01:42] ground get barren and the drought come
[1:01:44] and
[1:01:45] separate himself go down to live
[1:01:47] deliciously in the world it was after he
[1:01:49] had heard
[1:01:50] the whines and the cries of his herdsmen
[1:01:51] with no grass for the cattle
[1:01:53] but he maintained in the land that god
[1:01:55] gave him and told him to soar
[1:01:57] so jordan and as on that day after
[1:02:00] he had been tried his patience was at
[1:02:03] the end
[1:02:03] it was on that day that when after the
[1:02:06] trial was over
[1:02:07] he spoke face to face with elohim
[1:02:10] because the sixth seal always brings you
[1:02:12] to the seventh
[1:02:14] it was after he had suffered his trials
[1:02:16] after he went through the troubles
[1:02:18] that he'd been through that god appeared
[1:02:20] to him in the form of a man
[1:02:22] and sat there and told him he was
[1:02:23] married and his wife's name was sarah
[1:02:25] and said she'd laughed at him in the
[1:02:26] tent behind
[1:02:27] it was there that abraham called him
[1:02:29] elohim it was after the trial and
[1:02:31] tribulation
[1:02:32] oh if the church could only wake itself
[1:02:34] today
[1:02:35] to find that after the troubles and
[1:02:37] trials and laughs
[1:02:39] and the made fun of and the things that
[1:02:41] the church has been through the
[1:02:42] pentecostal church
[1:02:43] that we see god in our midst doing great
[1:02:47] signs and wonders
[1:02:50] further down he says all these great men
[1:02:52] that would take much of our morning
[1:02:53] service away to go in to mention
[1:02:55] that they went through trials and saw
[1:02:57] god they went through trials and saw
[1:02:59] angels
[1:03:00] they went through trials and revelations
[1:03:02] and saw signs and wonders and things
[1:03:04] but oh none of them saw what job saw all
[1:03:06] them men after seeing angels and seeing
[1:03:08] god and all these things
[1:03:10] they never saw nothing to give them
[1:03:11] hopes beyond the grave
[1:03:13] but job saw the resurrection he saw
[1:03:16] easter
[1:03:16] he saw the thing that comforts every
[1:03:18] heart then when he did
[1:03:20] all that my words words would be printed
[1:03:23] in a book
[1:03:24] all that they would be engraved with
[1:03:25] iron pen on a rock
[1:03:28] everything had turned against him even
[1:03:30] his servants wouldn't speak to him his
[1:03:31] wife was a stranger
[1:03:33] there he sat on an ash heap that great
[1:03:35] trial and the church come and turned
[1:03:37] their back to him for seven days
[1:03:39] and no one to comfort him
[1:03:42] where was he in the sixth seal
[1:03:47] then he must have saw a vision of easter
[1:03:50] when he cried
[1:03:51] i know my redeemer liveth and at the
[1:03:53] last days he'll stand on the earth
[1:03:55] i know oh that my words were pinned with
[1:03:58] an iron pin and stone
[1:04:00] that my words would never fade no more
[1:04:02] for i know my redeeming liberty i know
[1:04:05] i know we look at job's trials and all
[1:04:08] that he went through
[1:04:09] and everything that happened
[1:04:14] and there's a scripture in the book of
[1:04:15] job that says for
[1:04:17] six days you'll be troubled but in the
[1:04:20] seventh
[1:04:21] no evil will touch thee
[1:04:26] why job when he passed through his
[1:04:28] trials
[1:04:29] when he passed through his persecutions
[1:04:31] when he went through that
[1:04:33] what did he get he got the same thing
[1:04:35] isaiah got he got a fresh
[1:04:37] vision of the lord he said i know that
[1:04:40] though the skin worms destroy this flesh
[1:04:42] yet in my flesh i'll see him
[1:04:46] hallelujah we we have to understand that
[1:04:50] god's in control of everything what's he
[1:04:54] doing
[1:04:55] what is the sixth seal doing it is
[1:04:57] putting us
[1:04:58] in position what it does for israel
[1:05:02] it does for the bride of jesus christ if
[1:05:05] the sixtieth is putting israel in
[1:05:07] position the sixth seal is putting the
[1:05:09] bride into position
[1:05:12] hallelujah
[1:05:19] praise the lord
[1:05:23] hallelujah i don't even know what to say
[1:05:25] yet
[1:05:28] do you see it the sixth seal
[1:05:32] it's more than just the tribulation
[1:05:35] period three and a half
[1:05:36] years then the two witnesses that's it
[1:05:38] but it's
[1:05:39] more than that there's a tribulation
[1:05:42] period in your life
[1:05:43] there's a travail of soul there's
[1:05:46] anguish of spirit
[1:05:47] there's bringing about a new birth in
[1:05:49] our life like brother benjamin was
[1:05:51] talking about
[1:05:52] there's a burning down of the earth
[1:05:55] and making it new again we've all had to
[1:05:58] pass through
[1:05:59] the burning down of our earth if you've
[1:06:02] come to the new birth
[1:06:03] you've come to the burning down of your
[1:06:05] earth into the new creation
[1:06:08] and then god continues the walks walks
[1:06:10] us through this pattern
[1:06:12] of sixth seal bringing us to the seventh
[1:06:15] and we say oh it's too much
[1:06:18] why did this happen this isn't fair oh
[1:06:21] my goodness
[1:06:22] that's cain speaking
[1:06:25] but if you're a child of god nothing
[1:06:27] comes into your life unless first
[1:06:29] it passes the sacred desk of jehovah and
[1:06:32] he signs off on every child that trial
[1:06:34] that comes in your life
[1:06:35] and we just think somebody did me wrong
[1:06:37] somebody mistreated me
[1:06:39] god is trying to positionally place you
[1:06:41] you should get on your knees and say
[1:06:43] thank you god for this trial thank you
[1:06:46] god for the scourging
[1:06:47] thank you for the chastisement lord let
[1:06:49] me get up from here and put me right in
[1:06:51] position where i'm supposed to be
[1:06:54] that's why every child who got a proper
[1:06:56] discipline growing up
[1:06:57] and was raised in boundaries and had
[1:06:59] parents who would keep putting them in
[1:07:01] position
[1:07:01] putting them in the position they'll
[1:07:03] come back and say thank you mom
[1:07:05] thank you dad i appreciate that you
[1:07:07] didn't hold back
[1:07:08] that you punished me you took care of me
[1:07:10] you kept me on the straightener what
[1:07:12] were they doing
[1:07:13] they were using the sixth seal to put
[1:07:14] you back in position
[1:07:16] back in position back in position and
[1:07:19] you get down to
[1:07:20] the years where you have little children
[1:07:22] and you're raising a family and you say
[1:07:24] oh i'm so grateful
[1:07:28] but when god is putting you back in
[1:07:30] position this isn't fair
[1:07:32] this is too much why are they doing this
[1:07:34] to me why is all this happening to me
[1:07:39] we need to say thank you lord put me in
[1:07:42] position
[1:07:43] lord if there's if i'm wrong if i'm out
[1:07:45] of position if i've got wrong thinking
[1:07:47] if i've got wrong practices in my life
[1:07:49] god scourge me strip me down burn me to
[1:07:52] the ground and make me new
[1:07:54] because this is the only thing the elect
[1:07:56] wants the only thing they can think
[1:07:58] about
[1:07:58] is get in the land get in the land
[1:08:02] find my inheritance and get in my
[1:08:05] inheritance
[1:08:06] this end time there's a pool on the
[1:08:09] saints of god
[1:08:10] there's something drawing the saints of
[1:08:12] god and what's drawing them
[1:08:14] the word is calling amen it's calling
[1:08:16] your name
[1:08:17] what's it calling you for it's calling
[1:08:19] you to a position
[1:08:24] right israel is getting called back
[1:08:27] to a position
[1:08:32] look at what happens under the sixth
[1:08:33] seal
[1:08:35] they come back in in revelations chapter
[1:08:38] seven
[1:08:39] brother bernstein's talking about it
[1:08:41] says in this tribe
[1:08:43] so many thousand this tribe so many
[1:08:46] thousand
[1:08:46] this tribe so many thousands what does
[1:08:49] that mean when you name the tribe
[1:08:51] they know exactly what portion of land
[1:08:53] is theirs
[1:08:54] they know what part of the word belongs
[1:08:56] to them they know
[1:08:58] they know what they're supposed to be
[1:09:00] doing in that part of the land
[1:09:01] they know we over here we grow wheat
[1:09:03] over here we fish
[1:09:05] over here we mine right it's a
[1:09:08] positional placement
[1:09:09] and brother bam said when they come to
[1:09:11] this time they don't know what tribe
[1:09:13] they belong to
[1:09:15] the jews have been dispersed their
[1:09:16] records have been scattered
[1:09:18] they don't know if i'm in benjamin i
[1:09:20] don't know if i'm in dan i don't know if
[1:09:21] i'm natalie i don't know where i am
[1:09:24] and what position they place them it's
[1:09:26] those two prophets of revelations 11
[1:09:28] and they hear their name and they find
[1:09:30] out their position
[1:09:31] in the body and under a prophetic
[1:09:33] ministry under an eagle anointing
[1:09:35] under the sixth seal what's being
[1:09:37] happened they're saying
[1:09:38] you seven thousand you're part of
[1:09:41] ephraim
[1:09:43] oh ephraim as soon as you say ephraim i
[1:09:46] know what portion that
[1:09:47] that moses allotted for ephraim i know
[1:09:49] what ephraim is supposed to be doing
[1:09:51] i know what part of the country it's in
[1:09:53] i know what the topography of that
[1:09:54] country is in
[1:09:55] i know what the job is for ephraim and
[1:09:58] under the
[1:09:58] under the eagle anointing he's calling
[1:10:01] out that you're in ephraim amen you're
[1:10:03] in naphtali
[1:10:04] you're in judah you're in benjamin
[1:10:08] what's the sixth seal doing the sixth
[1:10:10] seal is putting them
[1:10:11] in position on their land and what is
[1:10:14] the sixth seal doing to you and i
[1:10:16] it is putting us in position in the word
[1:10:20] and whenever we get off of the word the
[1:10:22] rod is putting us
[1:10:24] back in position in the word because
[1:10:26] there is a predestinated position
[1:10:28] in this word for me
[1:10:33] and god is going to have every one of us
[1:10:36] in position
[1:10:37] fulfilling our role before the rapture
[1:10:39] takes place
[1:10:42] and what is moving the elect into
[1:10:44] position now remember
[1:10:46] the sixth seal only puts the elect
[1:10:49] in position it drives everything else to
[1:10:52] the battle of armageddon
[1:10:56] the elect go to position under the sixth
[1:10:59] seal
[1:11:00] and the sixth seal destroys everything
[1:11:03] else
[1:11:05] it's good to be elect
[1:11:10] but you know what everybody cries under
[1:11:12] the sixth seal
[1:11:15] rocks fall on me mountains fall on me
[1:11:19] hide me from the wrath of the lamb
[1:11:23] that's cain's generation
[1:11:27] but the elect say god exposed me
[1:11:31] stripped me down lord forgive me
[1:11:35] put me in position they don't crawl into
[1:11:38] the caves
[1:11:39] in the dens and cry out for the rocks to
[1:11:41] hide them from the lamb
[1:11:42] they're running to the lamb and saying
[1:11:45] lamb
[1:11:46] o lamb of god judge me from your throne
[1:11:48] o solomon
[1:11:50] purge me by your coal of fire take all
[1:11:53] the iniquity out of me
[1:11:55] and put me in position in my land
[1:11:58] let me live the exact position you've
[1:12:00] called for me to live
[1:12:01] without compromise amen without
[1:12:04] deviating one step
[1:12:05] keep me here o lamb of god let me come
[1:12:08] under the judgments of the lamb
[1:12:13] and if that's the elect's attitude then
[1:12:15] the elect is going to go to another
[1:12:17] judgment one day
[1:12:18] and it just happens to be that brother
[1:12:20] branham finishes the sixth seal
[1:12:22] with a story he said i just want to tell
[1:12:25] you something
[1:12:26] he said i've never told this in public
[1:12:29] before
[1:12:31] radar goes off ding ding ding we're in
[1:12:32] the sixth seal he's going to tell
[1:12:34] another unrelated story
[1:12:36] unrelated to the tribulation period and
[1:12:39] the two witnesses
[1:12:41] and he says i had a vision the other day
[1:12:44] and i was standing
[1:12:45] with a group of people there was a big
[1:12:47] throne and christ was sitting there
[1:12:49] and they were calling names like ormond
[1:12:51] neville and they would come out
[1:12:52] everybody be patting them on the back
[1:12:54] and say way to go god bless you brother
[1:12:55] and he would go up to this thing he'd
[1:12:57] say enter into the joys of the lord my
[1:12:59] faithful servant and he would go into
[1:13:00] this light
[1:13:03] what's he talking about the judgment
[1:13:05] seal
[1:13:06] what judgment is this it's the judgment
[1:13:09] seat of christ
[1:13:10] where the elect get their rewards
[1:13:15] if you'll come to judgment here
[1:13:18] you'll wind up in judgment there
[1:13:22] because under the judgment seal will
[1:13:25] purge you
[1:13:26] and positionally place you so that when
[1:13:28] you get beyond this life
[1:13:31] and you go to the judgment seat of
[1:13:32] christ no one is lost at that judgment
[1:13:36] that is not the white throne judgment
[1:13:38] that's the judgment of rewards for the
[1:13:40] elect
[1:13:41] and brother branham finishes the sixth
[1:13:43] seal the last thing he says
[1:13:44] is i want to tell you a story and i've
[1:13:46] never told this in public before
[1:13:48] and he's talking about entering in at
[1:13:51] the judgment seat of christ
[1:13:52] to his rewards i say god let the sixth
[1:13:57] seal do its work in me
[1:14:00] let the judgment seat purge me god let
[1:14:02] it positionally place me lord
[1:14:04] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:14:08] after you see this friends why would you
[1:14:11] avoid the chastening of the lord
[1:14:13] why would you fight his hand of
[1:14:15] chastening why would you re-fight the
[1:14:17] rebuke from the pulpit
[1:14:19] why would you fight the rebuke from the
[1:14:21] message when all he's trying to do
[1:14:23] is put you in position so that you can
[1:14:25] manifest the word
[1:14:28] the jews i meant they were in the
[1:14:30] holocaust
[1:14:32] do we understand that they were killed
[1:14:35] by the millions
[1:14:36] and it was the tender hand of jehovah to
[1:14:39] put them
[1:14:39] in position to receive the tree of life
[1:14:44] what foolishness for them to shake their
[1:14:46] fist at god and say god i'm mad at you
[1:14:48] for this
[1:14:49] it was the loving hand of jehovah
[1:14:52] it was god positionally placing an
[1:14:54] entire people
[1:14:55] to receive the messiah and what right do
[1:14:59] we have to shake our fist at god
[1:15:01] say god why am i in this trial and why
[1:15:03] is this happening to me
[1:15:05] and why is this ailment in my body don't
[1:15:07] shake your fist at god
[1:15:08] say god purged me from the fire off of
[1:15:11] your altar
[1:15:12] oh lamb of god cleanse my heart and put
[1:15:16] me in position
[1:15:17] because i want to come to another
[1:15:19] judgment one day
[1:15:20] amen and i want to come to the judgment
[1:15:22] that brother branham saw at the end of
[1:15:23] the sixth seal
[1:15:24] and the judgment of rewards at the
[1:15:26] judgment seat of christ
[1:15:27] where he steps up to the platform and he
[1:15:30] couldn't believe his name was called
[1:15:32] and he wasn't expecting that and he
[1:15:33] comes up and everyone's patterning on
[1:15:35] the back and say god bless you brother
[1:15:36] branham oh my brother
[1:15:38] and he walks up and he gets ready to
[1:15:39] walk on the platform to the light
[1:15:41] and he feels something slip in one arm
[1:15:44] he looks over its hope something hits
[1:15:47] his other arm
[1:15:48] he looks over its meda and they walk in
[1:15:52] together i say put me in position god
[1:15:57] i want to be at that judgment i want to
[1:16:00] be at the judgment of rewards
[1:16:02] and i'll never make it if i don't allow
[1:16:04] the sixth seal to put me in position
[1:16:08] we need to submit ourselves under the
[1:16:10] mighty hand of jehovah
[1:16:12] let's all stand i didn't really get to
[1:16:16] all
[1:16:17] that i wanted to get to but i pray that
[1:16:20] god will get us there
[1:16:23] and i pray like brother branham said the
[1:16:24] holy ghost will reveal what i couldn't
[1:16:26] say
[1:16:28] let's go back and read the seals again
[1:16:32] i'm excited friends i'm excited
[1:16:35] god is unlocking the mystery of our
[1:16:37] lives
[1:16:39] god is positionally placing us in his
[1:16:41] word
[1:16:42] why because brother branham said
[1:16:44] rapturing grace lies on them
[1:16:46] tapes what tapes is he talking about
[1:16:50] the revelation of the seven seals
[1:16:53] the mysteries that unlocked after that
[1:16:56] those
[1:16:56] tapes what's in them is something to
[1:16:59] unlock your life
[1:17:01] it's something to unlock the world the
[1:17:04] word
[1:17:04] and i say god give me more of it
[1:17:07] musicians if you want to come on up
[1:17:09] come on up i say
[1:17:12] god's good to his friends
[1:17:16] just when you think that you're about to
[1:17:18] plateau
[1:17:19] god takes us higher there is no
[1:17:23] leveling off for the bride of jesus
[1:17:24] christ revelation is not going to stop
[1:17:27] it's not going to slow down we're not
[1:17:29] going to come to the end of the
[1:17:30] unveiling of god until
[1:17:32] until we get a body change and go on and
[1:17:34] then we'll begin to discover
[1:17:38] the revelation of god amen we're so
[1:17:41] limited here
[1:17:43] but even in our limited condition god
[1:17:45] has so loved us
[1:17:46] and he so has a desire that he's
[1:17:48] continually unveiling
[1:17:49] come and see me see me more see yourself
[1:17:52] and me
[1:17:53] find your position find true
[1:17:56] satisfaction

[1:18:01] when it comes it is not one bit
[1:18:04] pleasant the chastening hand of the lord
[1:18:08] doesn't feel very good but the after
[1:18:11] effect
[1:18:13] oh it's glorious friends i wouldn't miss
[1:18:16] it for the world

[1:18:32] you lead your sheep you correct your
[1:18:34] sheep because you love your sheep lord
[1:18:37] and i'm so glad lord that when i would
[1:18:39] go astray you never let me learn
[1:18:41] that i'm to judge myself but if not if
[1:18:44] i'm judged i'm chastened of you lord
[1:18:46] that i will not be condemned with the
[1:18:48] world
[1:18:49] what a satisfaction that brings i just
[1:18:51] pray almighty god that you would let
[1:18:53] this lesson come home to each one of us
[1:18:55] that you would unlock the mystery in our
[1:18:57] life that you would reveal to us lord
[1:18:59] what you're doing in our lives
[1:19:01] lord if there's individuals here who
[1:19:02] have been hurt in the past
[1:19:04] from what they see as wrongdoings of
[1:19:06] other people
[1:19:07] people that have hurt them and abused
[1:19:09] them and and
[1:19:10] and mocked them and taken advantage of
[1:19:13] them

[1:19:17] may not be here today hearing this word
[1:19:19] if it wasn't for that
[1:19:21] let us see lord that you make no
[1:19:23] mistakes lord
