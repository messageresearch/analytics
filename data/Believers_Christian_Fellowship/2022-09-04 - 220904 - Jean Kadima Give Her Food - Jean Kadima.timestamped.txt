[17:05] up are we going to go straight to the
[17:07] word of God it's good to be back in my
[17:11] home Church
[17:14] hey man
[17:17] I always have the last word
[17:20] [Laughter]
[17:22] okay Mark 5 22.
[17:28] I'm gonna take again my Liberty as I
[17:32] always do
[17:33] but I am I feel good about that Liberty
[17:37] uh partially because
[17:40] the pastor already touched that subject
[17:44] when I was preaching it in Pittsburgh it
[17:48] was
[17:49] actually preaching it here a little bit
[17:51] touching it here so praise God for that
[17:55] okay Mark 5 22.
[17:58] and behold there cometh one of the
[18:02] rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name
[18:05] and when he saw him he fell at his feet
[18:10] and besought him greatly saying my
[18:13] little daughter lieth at the point of
[18:16] death I prayed thee come and lay thy
[18:19] hands on her that she may be healed and
[18:23] she shall live let's jump to uh verse 35
[18:27] from there
[18:29] and 35
[18:32] while he yet spake there came from the
[18:36] ruler of the synagogue's house Satan
[18:40] which said thy daughter is dead thy
[18:45] troubleless thou the master any further
[18:48] as soon as Jesus heard the word that was
[18:53] spoken he said and the ruler of the
[18:56] synagogue be not afraid trade only
[19:00] believe
[19:01] and he suffered no man to follow him
[19:06] save Peter and James and John the
[19:10] brother of jams we know it takes the
[19:13] three witness
[19:14] hope law hope faith and love
[19:18] and verse 38
[19:21] and he cometh to the house of the ruler
[19:24] of the synagogue and seeth the multitude
[19:27] and then that wept and wailed greatly
[19:32] and when he was coming he says unto them
[19:37] why make he this adult and Weep the
[19:41] damsel is not dead but slippeth and they
[19:46] loved him to scorn but when he had put
[19:49] them out all out he taketh the father
[19:53] and the mother of the damself and them
[19:56] that were with him and entered in where
[20:00] the demsa was lying
[20:04] verse 41 and he took the demsa by the
[20:08] hand and said unto her
[20:12] which is being interpret themsel I say
[20:17] unto thee Rye arise and straight away
[20:21] the damself arose and walk and she was
[20:25] of age of 12 12 years and they were
[20:30] astonished with a great astonishment and
[20:34] he charged them straightly that no man
[20:38] should know it and commanded that
[20:41] something should be given her to eat
[20:46] amen and that's our Focus this morning
[20:51] God bless you you may take your seat
[20:57] so as you can see
[20:59] I have highlighted the last sentence
[21:02] there where Jesus commanded them to give
[21:06] her something to eat and I take took my
[21:10] subject there and I say my job my
[21:13] subject is give her food
[21:17] that's it give her food that's the the
[21:21] subject and
[21:23] um this I cannot remember how this comes
[21:27] to came to me a preacher will tell you
[21:30] very strange things happened
[21:32] so I just came and I thought about uh
[21:37] you know Lima Ohio and then I went to
[21:41] Pittsburgh and preached a little bit uh
[21:44] one angle of it but you see God can hit
[21:50] you with something when you read the
[21:53] Bible read the word but not reading it
[21:57] like you're reading a newspaper
[21:59] so when you read it with meditation you
[22:03] want God to speak to you something can
[22:06] just hit you and God starts building it
[22:09] I at the end it was something else uh
[22:13] for me
[22:14] so and I see that that's how the prophet
[22:18] used to read the Bible
[22:21] that's the way he did and I was looking
[22:23] at a a scripture in Luke 7 7 36
[22:30] we have brother Branham is talking about
[22:33] this invitation he had to go to Simon uh
[22:37] Simon the Pharisee and where he said
[22:41] verse 36 and one of the Pharisees desire
[22:45] him that he would eat with him and he
[22:49] went into the Pharisees house and sat
[22:52] down to meet and behold a woman in the
[22:56] city which was a sinner when she knew
[22:59] that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees
[23:03] house brought in Alabaster
[23:06] Box of ointment and stood At His Feet be
[23:12] behind him whipping and begin to wash
[23:15] his feet with tears and did wipe them
[23:19] with the hairs of her head and kisses
[23:22] feet and anoint them with ointment
[23:25] well brother Brahm takes that scripture
[23:30] and find us something that is not
[23:34] actually there
[23:35] and you find a paid Courier
[23:40] in that scripture he say
[23:42] to go to invite Jesus so Simon the
[23:47] Pharisee would have sent a courier a
[23:52] paid Courier to go and give the message
[23:56] to uh to Jesus
[23:59] and he zero in a focus on that person
[24:04] who will bring to Jesus the the
[24:07] invitation
[24:10] where do you find the paid carrier here
[24:13] the prophet could see it because the way
[24:16] you read the Bible is between the lines
[24:20] and God just inspired him who brought
[24:24] the invitation to you to Jesus and he
[24:27] starts dramatizing
[24:30] he say he came and arrived and went to
[24:34] Jesus and give a node to Jesus and
[24:38] politely Jesus also gave the note back
[24:42] he said my master
[24:45] Simon the Pharisee has sent me to give
[24:50] you this invitation so you can come to
[24:53] his house and have a dinner is a very
[24:57] important man it would be great if you
[25:01] show up
[25:02] thank you
[25:03] and Jesus said
[25:05] sure
[25:07] he always when he's invited
[25:10] he will come
[25:12] so and the brother Brandon focused on
[25:15] his message for a while on this person
[25:19] but the Bible is not talking about him
[25:22] he says is is like on that that time in
[25:27] that time if you want to go and invite
[25:31] someone you send a paid Courier you know
[25:34] FedEx you know
[25:37] UPS
[25:39] and it's you know
[25:42] uh Amazon
[25:45] the children are saying you forget Uber
[25:47] Eats and
[25:50] whatever so
[25:53] you said you send the carrier
[25:57] and whatever I'm focused on this person
[26:00] who went and gave the message
[26:04] then the prophet says the message the
[26:07] meanest man in Santa Maria
[26:09] he say this now
[26:12] and then after that The Courier must
[26:16] have turned his back and walked away and
[26:19] breathe breathe a breath of satisfaction
[26:22] he had done something great
[26:26] and brother man I'm focused on it how
[26:29] can a person go to the word Med flesh
[26:34] and turn his back that's what is what is
[26:38] there is what you do in the flesh at
[26:42] that time it has an implication on the
[26:45] spiritual it goes back the same way it
[26:50] came in but a person cannot come to the
[26:54] world and remain the same
[26:56] even the death when they met the death
[27:00] met Jesus he was he did not remain the
[27:05] same but this man give his message to
[27:08] his uh
[27:10] the message of his boss and turn his
[27:14] back and goes back to his denomination
[27:21] goes back to the system of man-made
[27:24] system after come in contact of them
[27:28] with the message of the hour Ned flesh
[27:31] and brother Branham will focus on this
[27:34] and dramatizing
[27:37] oh and he say this
[27:42] and sometimes people come sick and get
[27:45] healed and then walk away thinking that
[27:48] they have achieved exactly the main
[27:51] thing that they came for
[27:54] the best thing is to come for uh for is
[27:57] to find him as a savior is to know him
[28:01] know him is life right he is in your
[28:06] life have the Assurance but today that's
[28:09] not what people do
[28:11] so I'm just skipping and but I'm saying
[28:14] this now we find that this Courier turn
[28:18] is back upon the Lord Jesus
[28:21] as far as the scripture does not give
[28:24] that he ever ask a pardoning of his sins
[28:28] or anything that he walked away back
[28:32] down to his master the Pharisee now they
[28:35] they there's something wrong with this
[28:38] story here it's absolutely something
[28:41] wrong it doesn't make ends meet there's
[28:45] something wrong indeed how can you turn
[28:48] your back
[28:50] on the word of God of your time
[28:54] well so he could read between lines
[28:58] so that's how we need to read the word
[29:01] that's how we read the Bible
[29:06] he went back to his system he didn't
[29:09] feel any change he didn't feel like
[29:13] something was there
[29:15] I thank God you and I have recognized
[29:19] the word and we stay with the word
[29:22] so you see there are things like this
[29:25] the uh all over the Bible that we should
[29:30] never read it the way we used to read it
[29:33] absolutely not
[29:35] so so let's go back to our story here
[29:42] and he he took the damselves by the hand
[29:46] mark five say unto her talitakumi maybe
[29:51] the way that's the way they say it which
[29:54] is being interpreted themselves I say
[29:56] unto thee arise and straight away the
[30:00] dams arose and walked and she was of the
[30:03] age of 12 years and they were astonished
[30:06] with great astonishment in shut them
[30:10] straight that no man should know it and
[30:13] commanded that something should be given
[30:16] to her
[30:17] to eat and I say give her food
[30:22] amen so that
[30:25] it's not isn't strange
[30:28] that she was dead and she came in
[30:33] contact with Jesus and then she arose
[30:39] and become alive again but yet Jesus
[30:44] said this is good but give her food
[30:48] all right so where where you are present
[30:52] she doesn't need the food to live
[30:55] why do you ask us to give her food no no
[30:58] no it's Jesus the God made the nature
[31:03] and nature obeyed to God
[31:06] she was maybe she spent days without
[31:10] eating drinking
[31:12] and if she does not eat she's going to
[31:16] return back where she came from
[31:18] That's the Law of God nature obey to God
[31:24] so that way say give her food otherwise
[31:27] she's going to go back where she comes
[31:30] from where does he she come from she
[31:34] comes from men made systems the
[31:39] graveyard of denomination spirit
[31:43] that's where she comes from so if you
[31:46] don't give her food she's going to
[31:48] return where she came from give her food
[31:52] don't give her psychology don't give her
[31:55] wisdom give her food and what food the
[32:00] word of her time
[32:02] amen
[32:04] [Music]
[32:07] amen
[32:10] spiritual food in a due season
[32:12] it's not their food it's not the church
[32:15] so-called food it's the bride food it's
[32:19] spiritual food in season it would make
[32:22] them sick at their stomach is too rich
[32:25] to for them see you can't do it for the
[32:29] children it's bread it's alive it's
[32:32] Christ the same yesterday today and
[32:34] forever
[32:37] okay
[32:38] give her who
[32:41] the damself
[32:42] who is the demsa the bride
[32:46] why is this show she's is she is she so
[32:50] young because it's a virgin see
[32:53] me of the church
[32:55] and if you don't give it to her she's
[32:58] going to go back return to where she
[33:01] came from
[33:03] but don't give her your own ideas
[33:07] hey man
[33:09] don't give her the philosophy of this
[33:13] world a psychology of this world is
[33:17] nothing wrong with it but not on the
[33:19] pulpit
[33:21] it's nothing to go in the cabinet
[33:23] somewhere with the doctor but she the
[33:27] bride should not be given psychology he
[33:31] won't help her don't give her another
[33:34] time of food give her the food of today
[33:40] any other food will not help her
[33:45] anything else will not help our young
[33:47] people it will not help our older people
[33:52] entertainment is good but you won't help
[33:55] them
[33:56] what they need is to to go to come up
[34:01] higher
[34:03] there God has put all the ingredients
[34:06] that the church need
[34:09] what you need you individual all the
[34:12] ingredients all the things that you need
[34:15] is in that food therefore you cannot
[34:20] provide them with any other food but
[34:23] that food but let me tell you she has to
[34:26] eat too
[34:28] it's not just provide for her Jesus said
[34:32] give her food
[34:34] but it implies that she is she has to
[34:37] eat
[34:38] amen she has to chew on it
[34:42] amen she has to meditate on it otherwise
[34:45] he's gonna die but the Lord said give
[34:49] her food but it means she has to consume
[34:53] that food
[34:55] chew on it meditate on it amen apply it
[35:01] that the solution
[35:03] solution to all our problems
[35:07] to a solution to all the issues and find
[35:11] in the word of God
[35:13] give her food not man wisdom
[35:18] that's why brother Branham say to uh
[35:22] to the preachers
[35:23] however they say oh Pastor that's your
[35:27] job
[35:28] they eat food not a mad and
[35:32] monarchs
[35:34] ship food God's words
[35:38] but she needs to eat
[35:42] you know if she doesn't eat
[35:44] what's going to happen
[35:48] brother Branham
[35:49] went into a restaurant
[35:53] you know what happened
[35:55] he saw a woman
[35:57] with a blue
[35:59] hair whatever mascara
[36:03] how they call it manicure
[36:06] whatever she had but when I was
[36:09] discussed
[36:10] but the prophets say that God spoke to
[36:13] him
[36:15] and told him don't condemn her in a
[36:19] demonology he say religion dream he say
[36:22] you know what that woman slipped out of
[36:25] that seat there in that restaurant we
[36:28] had a prayer meeting like you never
[36:30] heard in your life and she came to
[36:33] Christ what was it
[36:35] don't condemn them tell them the gospel
[36:40] this is what I have found in being
[36:44] working as a missioner
[36:47] you know you find that people can even
[36:50] you know oppose you say things have a
[36:53] resentment
[36:55] it's just because the they don't know
[37:00] you just assured them love and give them
[37:03] the word then you see they turn around
[37:06] what happened we we love for the Kadima
[37:09] what happened why do you love him
[37:12] suddenly
[37:13] don't condemn them then give them the
[37:16] word
[37:17] amen amen
[37:20] that is so good
[37:25] everybody
[37:32] they're hungry they're hungry they don't
[37:35] know so give them food
[37:39] and then when you become friends
[37:41] amen praise God
[37:45] hey man
[37:48] ah
[37:50] My my what where can I read
[37:54] ah
[37:56] where can I read
[37:58] let's just read what it what is there
[38:02] okay the restoration of the bride all
[38:05] the bugs that hell can turn loose on her
[38:09] will never stop her no communism uh
[38:12] Catholicism and nothing else will stop
[38:16] it I will restore saith the Lord all the
[38:20] men made Roman trees will never hang it
[38:24] there all the graves will not keep it
[38:27] there all the big denomination of stones
[38:31] laying at the door will never keep it in
[38:35] there so what happened she was in the
[38:40] graveyard spiritually speaking but when
[38:45] the word came nothing could keep her in
[38:49] that place in those stones but when she
[38:53] comes out of him she needs to continue
[38:58] with food to sustain her life
[39:03] but not any food
[39:07] he must be God's food
[39:10] it must be ship food
[39:13] Eagle food
[39:16] not any other word will do will answer
[39:19] to this condition that we're living in
[39:23] young people all people that will not
[39:26] work it must be the word of this day
[39:31] well let me let me work you up it must
[39:34] be the Eighth Day message
[39:38] if it's just right there it won't do
[39:42] anything you have to operate
[39:44] go a little bit upper higher that will
[39:48] keep the young people
[39:51] [Music]
[39:54] amen
[39:55] everybody is with me
[39:57] amen that's exactly right God has a
[40:01] provided way
[40:04] it has thrown golden nuggets in this
[40:09] message
[40:10] you throw here through there he knows
[40:13] you need it
[40:14] so it happened like you stumble on it no
[40:18] you didn't you throw it he knew you're
[40:20] gonna come over there anyway
[40:23] but any other thing will not work
[40:30] I I hope you understand I I guess you
[40:32] understand
[40:34] yeah it's a message no but the message
[40:36] has to come higher
[40:38] big to meet the challenge the challenge
[40:41] is so strong the demons that come with
[40:45] all the anger they need the word that of
[40:50] that level
[40:53] and every time people rejected
[40:57] The Eighth Day message
[41:00] sorry to say that when they do they die
[41:04] because that's what happened that's what
[41:06] Jesus said
[41:07] Jesus say give her food
[41:10] if you don't give her food they die
[41:17] God help us
[41:21] we need to say these things who knows
[41:25] who will hear
[41:27] it has to be the word of this day
[41:31] because you see as the preacher
[41:34] sometimes you wonder
[41:37] you know before you know you wonder why
[41:41] why is it that brother Branham
[41:44] redrew the church ages
[41:48] or the angel of the Lord
[41:51] just redo it
[41:54] and then he redo
[41:56] and he made loud this year
[42:00] completely black
[42:03] all right
[42:04] that but I am still here so you see all
[42:07] these things you're thinking I'm here
[42:09] it's total chaos what that means
[42:14] but the reality is you're not in love
[42:18] this year
[42:19] you go a little higher in eight days
[42:22] where everything is bright
[42:26] and there you see everything so how can
[42:29] you feed people with the loud decision
[42:32] message it won't work
[42:37] hey man
[42:38] oh God help us
[42:43] whatever talks about what happened
[42:46] another mystery you see when it goes to
[42:49] India
[42:51] it goes to when he went to Africa India
[42:56] he had a
[42:58] thousands of thousands people
[43:01] they were uh they gave the heart to the
[43:05] Lord and when he came here he said to
[43:08] people when they received the Holy Ghost
[43:10] they just act like you and I
[43:15] right and then strengthing happened
[43:20] denomination
[43:22] did not want to help to be associated
[43:26] with him
[43:28] therefore this all these people
[43:30] had came to listen to brother Branham
[43:33] gave their heart to the Lord
[43:35] what did they do after brother pranam
[43:38] left
[43:40] back in the denomination
[43:43] back in the temple
[43:46] isn't taking side with Jesus I cannot
[43:48] read it
[43:49] but I can just read here there was no
[43:53] church nothing I could do there was
[43:55] nobody to give to them
[43:57] the measure I believe there was not even
[44:00] Pentecostal denomination will cooperate
[44:02] with me and all these those Souls
[44:05] probably drifted right back in the thick
[44:09] with genes and Buddhism and whatever
[44:11] more they come they come from no place
[44:14] to put them what is shame that is
[44:17] disgrace because I had no cooperation
[44:19] because of the stand that I take
[44:23] it said just beyond me I don't have an
[44:27] answer about it they seem to have
[44:30] received the Holy Ghost but denomination
[44:32] you know uh did not want to cooperate
[44:36] what's going to happen they're going to
[44:38] go back they have to worship
[44:41] is that right God always sort them out
[44:44] you know
[44:45] God will sort it at the end but look
[44:49] what is the most important receiving the
[44:52] holy ghost or the word
[44:56] Jesus did not have the Holy Ghost when
[44:59] he was going to the Cross but he
[45:02] sustained him he was the word the word
[45:05] sustained him
[45:07] I don't know how to explain this this
[45:10] people went back to
[45:13] they have to go somewhere
[45:17] therefore if any person reject the word
[45:22] they're going back
[45:24] God help us
[45:27] yeah
[45:30] are you with me
[45:32] give them food
[45:35] and let them eat food
[45:40] it will change them
[45:42] it will mold them
[45:45] it will transform them he will make them
[45:48] new creatures
[45:51] it's the word of this time
[45:54] this level
[45:55] amen it's over issues
[45:59] is solve our issue the question that we
[46:02] have in our mind
[46:04] God has already thrown answers in the
[46:09] message everywhere this answer
[46:14] the problem that really uh hurt us the
[46:18] most in this age is emotional questions
[46:23] give her food
[46:24] in the food there is answer to emotional
[46:28] questions
[46:31] we had emotional questions in our time
[46:36] but we were a little bit distracted
[46:39] because we were in survival mode
[46:43] we need to put food on the table that's
[46:46] a great achievement
[46:48] the rent job that was so emotional
[46:53] questions were like in a back seat
[46:56] today in a developed country uh tell
[47:01] each other that you provide for him meal
[47:04] or his mail
[47:05] they don't know what you're talking
[47:07] about
[47:10] yeah
[47:12] dad go to work to get your food yeah
[47:21] but we were a little bit distracted
[47:24] so that we will not focus on emotional
[47:27] Grace today
[47:30] you have to address them
[47:34] with the word
[47:37] the solution is in the word just keep
[47:41] eating eat the food of your time there
[47:44] is an answer there and many people have
[47:47] even asked questions for our time
[47:50] brother Branham let's take a question
[47:53] question and answer four
[47:55] brother Branham when some somebody gets
[47:58] on
[47:59] steps on my toes
[48:02] this might be a good one steps on my
[48:05] toes as the old saying is my temper eyes
[48:09] how can I overcome these things I know
[48:12] the the Lord will have to do it but what
[48:16] can I do in my heart
[48:21] I don't want this thing
[48:24] what about an answer sweeten your temple
[48:27] with prayer then make up your mind
[48:32] that's answer that's the solution
[48:36] is that all yeah that's all
[48:39] what do you want
[48:40] something more
[48:42] straighten your spirit quieten that the
[48:45] human spirit with prayer
[48:48] before you can speak and act
[48:52] that's all
[48:54] and the word of God when it comes to us
[48:58] we need to say Amen to it
[49:01] not just say can I measure up to this
[49:04] word that was said no don't do that just
[49:08] say Amen to it and God give me the grace
[49:11] to apply it because that's the solution
[49:14] there is no other solution
[49:21] but if I'm saying I don't guess there's
[49:23] too many people in this building ever
[49:25] had any more temper than I did to begin
[49:28] with I had a mouth mashed all the time
[49:33] and I've taken a lot of my meals out of
[49:36] a straw
[49:38] oh my it kept going it kept going and he
[49:42] tell you one day a woman insulted his
[49:45] mother
[49:46] as he was doing just his job as a
[49:49] utility in a utility company turning off
[49:52] the uh
[49:54] the mirror whatever they call them and
[49:57] that woman laughed at him he said it did
[50:01] not feel anything he said the form the
[50:05] former me would have bitten that woman
[50:07] even though I don't believe in violence
[50:10] in a woman I would have done it but when
[50:12] I look back I didn't even feel anything
[50:16] and the things of God that's how they
[50:19] happen you look back and say oh when
[50:22] where this Temple went
[50:25] amen I used to where is it gone
[50:29] God took it because you took the word
[50:32] you ate the food
[50:35] that was provide for you you took it and
[50:37] God gave you the solution
[50:41] and today God help us
[50:54] you see God it really doesn't want his
[50:57] children to go the way of Cain
[51:01] that's the problem
[51:02] Cain was told this is the solution
[51:07] this is the atonement is the blood
[51:11] I said oh no
[51:13] and well uh that's it what else can God
[51:19] give you this is the provided way
[51:23] and that's why the word is screaming to
[51:26] is the god children stay with the world
[51:30] what else can you get if it's not the
[51:34] word
[51:35] it's something very simple but that's
[51:39] what it has to be it has to be simple
[51:43] amen
[51:53] sometimes we don't tell people that
[51:57] a Christian
[51:59] sometimes need to cope with tough
[52:02] situation
[52:04] when we say overcome
[52:07] overcome that thing it does not always
[52:10] mean
[52:12] it's going to go away
[52:15] sometimes it's just you have to cope
[52:17] with it
[52:19] you have to keep it under the blood
[52:24] it overcome means that okay ignore it
[52:31] take a different position
[52:37] and we need to say the things because
[52:38] the word has them here for a purpose
[52:47] Christ is the reveal is revealed in his
[52:51] own word
[52:53] I was talking to a young Minister and
[52:56] his wife in the room just a few minutes
[52:58] ago and both of them are never nervous
[53:01] just like the rest of the world the rest
[53:03] of the human beings on Earth I said
[53:06] remember Satan got a Punch coming at you
[53:09] I don't care who you are he got a right
[53:13] a right to want that one punch
[53:19] so if it's to be nervous that the punch
[53:21] he has
[53:23] God gave it to him so what you need to
[53:26] do overcome what is or overcome
[53:28] sometimes is to cope
[53:31] put it under the blood
[53:34] because God may decide not to take it
[53:36] away
[53:38] oh that's hard to say but that's true
[53:41] but Abraham suffer all ears every seven
[53:45] years with a stomach pain tension and
[53:49] all that thing God God why do you do
[53:52] this to me why don't you take it away he
[53:54] never took it away
[53:56] do you know when he took it away one
[53:59] month before his death
[54:01] he said he won't bother you anymore
[54:05] that was kind of God has a sense of
[54:08] humor you know yeah one month later he
[54:11] was gone
[54:15] because God knew being under tension
[54:18] will help his ministry painful but yes
[54:21] but he will help his ministry
[54:28] there are things that God want us to
[54:30] overcome when we say overcome sometimes
[54:32] I'm just using I'm poor in language I
[54:36] would call it to cope with it
[54:42] that's it
[54:46] whether when I'm saying that the devil
[54:49] has a right to give you one punch a good
[54:55] one you know young people you understand
[54:57] what I'm talking about a good punch
[55:01] he has the right you know so you say
[55:05] which had your uh which had you rather
[55:09] be that punch be blind that's a punch
[55:13] be an arthritic
[55:16] um sitting in a chair or be nervous I
[55:20] would take be nervous
[55:23] that's what it is
[55:25] see it's got somewhere he can punch you
[55:29] he got you right
[55:30] to that one place
[55:32] now that the spot you got to keep
[55:35] covered all the time
[55:38] you see it's a nervous age we're living
[55:41] in
[55:42] yes
[55:44] but the prophet tells us
[55:46] it has to be
[55:49] ah it has to be in God's terms provided
[55:53] God's provided way
[55:55] for this day so God has made a way for
[55:59] us God loves his children he loves his
[56:03] people you want to help them you want to
[56:06] help you more than you you want help if
[56:10] you can't just get that in your heart
[56:12] God's more willing to help you than you
[56:17] are to help yourself
[56:20] young people
[56:21] grown up everyone all the people God
[56:26] wants to help us
[56:27] but he has a way and that's the only way
[56:31] that will work is true this way you must
[56:35] come to his term not your terms
[56:39] his terms
[56:41] you wanted a certain way my problem I
[56:45] want the solution this way but that's
[56:48] what Cain say I want food
[56:52] take it or living
[56:55] is that right my way no it's God terms
[56:59] and sometimes they're very simple
[57:03] the only thing you say is amen Lord Now
[57:07] give me the grace to apply it
[57:15] but he he gives it to you this way and
[57:18] like Naman dipped in the dipping in the
[57:21] waters of Jordan why he said the water's
[57:24] up in this country was much cleaner and
[57:27] better but that was not what the prophet
[57:29] say deep here he dipped once leprosy
[57:33] still there six times it was still there
[57:36] he had to obey and come God's way and
[57:40] when he fully obeyed God's way the
[57:43] leprosy left
[57:45] [Music]
[57:47] that provide way
[57:49] not always a good we will not always
[57:52] what we expected
[57:55] it's away
[57:57] and all these Solutions are in the word
[58:00] but I want to tell you that God knowing
[58:04] when you and I will be living
[58:07] what time
[58:10] what the issues will be
[58:15] the upper
[58:17] rise the standard don't tell me standard
[58:21] is the code of conduct the standard is
[58:25] the greater revelation
[58:28] where all the candlesticks are
[58:32] lightening up everything becomes clear
[58:38] amen
[58:50] give them food
[58:53] give her food
[58:54] who the bride
[58:57] message the Rapture three things happen
[59:00] a voice a shout a voice a trumpet has to
[59:04] happen before Jesus appears now
[59:07] Jesus does all this of all three of them
[59:12] I don't want to be in trouble
[59:15] Jesus that's all
[59:19] you see yeah
[59:20] we should not be afraid of the word
[59:26] Jesus does all these three three of them
[59:30] as is descending in descending of three
[59:33] of them
[59:35] but we are just afraid well well let's
[59:39] just stay with the shout okay okay let's
[59:42] just stay with a shout a shout what is a
[59:45] shout it's the message going forth first
[59:47] the bra living bread of life bringing
[59:52] forth the bride

[59:59] ingredients everything that we need to
[1:00:04] sustain our life to serve him to serve

[1:00:26] so Jairus daughter was uh
[1:00:30] she
[1:00:31] was dead
[1:00:34] therefore she needs
[1:00:36] what a Revival
[1:00:40] she's dead
[1:00:42] really dead
[1:00:44] in denominations
[1:00:46] in the system of men
[1:00:48] not what you need a Revival what will
[1:00:51] rise hurt from death

[1:01:01] the bride has not had a Revival yet dead
[1:01:05] right there's no big they're not being a
[1:01:09] Revival there no manifestation of God to
[1:01:12] steal the bride yet we are looking for
[1:01:14] it now it will take those seven Thunders
[1:01:21] standards back there to wake her up
[1:01:24] again he will send it he promised now
[1:01:28] watch what make this Jairus girl waking
[1:01:33] up is to come in contact with Jesus but
[1:01:38] Jesus Will was speaking you know the
[1:01:42] normal language
[1:01:43] he's staying people get up only the
[1:01:47] mother and and the father come with me
[1:01:50] Peter John James come here and he start
[1:01:54] talking and he goes all this is speaking
[1:01:57] let's say speaking in English right
[1:02:02] okay you go go go here
[1:02:05] and then suddenly he turned and said uh
[1:02:12] Jean fee left twice Italy
[1:02:15] oh oh no brother John what did you say
[1:02:17] there
[1:02:18] that's the point Jesus spoke in other
[1:02:23] tongues
[1:02:25] that the need and interpretation the
[1:02:28] Bible say what Jesus said needed an
[1:02:33] interpretation
[1:02:37] and that what woke up the woman
[1:02:42] the word that is saying need a prophet
[1:02:44] to give the interpretation
[1:02:47] no wonder I spoken French if you're
[1:02:50] wondering what did he say
[1:02:58] wake her up he has to speak in a message
[1:03:02] a message that John was told to seal up
[1:03:06] until the the messenger of the last age
[1:03:10] to appear only that will wake her up
[1:03:18] nothing else
[1:03:19] now listen this is not me saying
[1:03:22] continues no she was dead
[1:03:26] what need to work her up is those
[1:03:29] Thunders
[1:03:30] John has to seal them
[1:03:34] amen and now if the church would forget
[1:03:37] their Creed and forget their dog and
[1:03:39] just take the Bible please the promise
[1:03:42] then it will be become effective to them
[1:03:46] but your tradition and you keep going
[1:03:51] amen

[1:03:54] the bride
[1:03:58] the very thing that work era
[1:04:00] keep her alive
[1:04:04] is that right it's not sufficient
[1:04:07] to to wake up
[1:04:10] but you have to keep to be alive
[1:04:14] something that sustained your your life
[1:04:18] is the same word that wake you up
[1:04:23] amen

[1:04:53] I'm just told I just told you about the
[1:04:56] uh
[1:04:58] they're speaking in time
[1:05:02] that the word that worked her up
[1:05:06] and that's what the prophet say the
[1:05:08] seventh seal when he say that I have
[1:05:11] received it in three three fourth manner
[1:05:15] and he will say that it's the is it

[1:05:20] behind the Revelation Dan it will say
[1:05:24] the secret coming that the thing that
[1:05:27] Angels did not know

[1:05:41] and and and one unfolded today or
[1:05:46] yesterday the other one unfolded today
[1:05:48] and there is the one thing that cannot
[1:05:51] interpret I cannot interpret because
[1:05:54] it's in unknown language
[1:06:02] is in unknown language you need a
[1:06:05] prophet to give the interpretation is
[1:06:08] the message of the hour amen
[1:06:13] it is those standards it's the third
[1:06:15] pool is all that it's a bundle of thanks
[1:06:20] but she need
[1:06:22] to eat to sister in your life
[1:06:25] I want to just change gears a little bit
[1:06:29] here
[1:06:31] ah
[1:06:34] looking at the Jairus story
[1:06:37] I remember brother Branham
[1:06:40] his his mother
[1:06:43] was very sick
[1:06:46] and brother Branham
[1:06:48] is praying to God to tell him
[1:06:51] what is going on
[1:06:54] and God is not answer him
[1:06:57] and brother Brown says
[1:07:00] you know
[1:07:01] when is for somebody else
[1:07:04] it will talk to me
[1:07:06] but when is my own issue
[1:07:09] our sweat he won't answer me
[1:07:13] and he said the gift is not my gift
[1:07:18] it is God a gift it will even tell us
[1:07:22] that I just want to have one gift
[1:07:27] one a gift
[1:07:29] and that gift
[1:07:31] is to relax myself
[1:07:35] and let God use me not standing on God's
[1:07:40] way
[1:07:41] that the only gift I have
[1:07:46] it's good that the prophets say this
[1:07:49] we know there are nine gifts of the
[1:07:52] Spirit and five-fold Ministry
[1:07:56] but the Lord doesn't want us to remain
[1:08:00] in that level thinking about the gift
[1:08:03] that way
[1:08:04] because a gift if it belongs to you you
[1:08:07] can use it the way you want
[1:08:10] if it's something that was given to you
[1:08:12] for you to use you can use it any way
[1:08:15] you want you want to go to near Alaska
[1:08:18] you go to Alaska you want to go and uh
[1:08:22] grow up your bird you go you know grow
[1:08:26] up your bear and fish hunt and all the
[1:08:30] things
[1:08:31] but it's not
[1:08:33] the gift is God
[1:08:35] are you with me God uses it where you
[1:08:40] want to use this when he wants to use it
[1:08:43] you cannot say my gift will operate in
[1:08:47] Cleveland
[1:08:49] God said Pittsburgh
[1:08:52] you're Cleveland is not your gift
[1:08:58] but brother Branham is giving us
[1:09:01] the way of understanding gifts you say
[1:09:05] we have only one gift we can ask for
[1:09:08] basically this is me
[1:09:11] is to relax
[1:09:14] and to let God
[1:09:17] is it that the gift I have the rest
[1:09:21] that's God
[1:09:23] I just relax myself that the gift I have
[1:09:26] and I will ask all the church everybody
[1:09:28] let's relax ask God for the gift of
[1:09:32] relaxing and let him
[1:09:35] because what it will do we don't know he
[1:09:40] may not fit the backs of nine gifts what
[1:09:44] God will do may not fit there or gift of
[1:09:48] speaking in time prophecy uh healing he
[1:09:52] may not even fit that
[1:09:55] whatever you want is God
[1:09:59] when was
[1:10:01] creating those animals
[1:10:04] how can you take it and fit it in the
[1:10:08] Box
[1:10:09] how can you do it it was not or you will
[1:10:13] say gift of Miracles no
[1:10:17] it was a returning back to the Garden of
[1:10:21] Eden Adam being restored it doesn't fit
[1:10:25] in the nine gift of the spirit
[1:10:30] so whatever God wants to do if I just
[1:10:32] relax so gift we should not ask for gift
[1:10:36] if there is a gift we can ask is
[1:10:39] ourselves to just relax
[1:10:42] and stop all the our let me just call it
[1:10:46] nonsense
[1:10:51] stop all these things
[1:10:53] and relax
[1:10:56] say stop our ambitions
[1:11:02] what do we want to do
[1:11:04] and sometimes you say our stuff
[1:11:07] so we can get everybody can grab
[1:11:10] something yeah I know my stuff
[1:11:14] and just relax and let him and that's
[1:11:18] the biggest problem is him to find
[1:11:21] somebody somebody who can completely
[1:11:25] relax to God of Will and do what he
[1:11:30] asked him to do then God will do the
[1:11:33] rest and the rest that he will do cannot
[1:11:36] We cannot put in in the boxes of gifts
[1:11:43] anything you want it will do
[1:11:53] amen
[1:11:56] oh my that time is running okay
[1:12:00] what Abraham says
[1:12:04] when his mother was uh
[1:12:06] sick is asking God
[1:12:09] what happened to my mother
[1:12:11] what can I do
[1:12:13] the gift is not for him
[1:12:15] the gift is for other people
[1:12:17] if you come to him you have a dream it
[1:12:21] will tell you oh you forget this portion
[1:12:24] of your dream it means this it means
[1:12:27] that
[1:12:28] okay and he will tell you though don't
[1:12:32] say it this is what happened this is
[1:12:34] whatever you forget this you forget that
[1:12:37] I come to his own mother
[1:12:39] sick no
[1:12:42] God does not answer him
[1:12:46] he cried to him at some point he said
[1:12:50] Lord help me here this is my mother
[1:12:56] he say he goes into uh coming home in
[1:13:01] the testimony of a true witness you say
[1:13:04] coming home I thought I went and stood
[1:13:07] in the room I pick up a Bible a new
[1:13:11] Bible I say Lord you uh you are God you
[1:13:16] don't have to tell me what you do and I
[1:13:20] just wonder if you kept the reason you
[1:13:23] did that taking her she was already dead
[1:13:25] taking her was it
[1:13:29] was it because to keep from breaking my
[1:13:33] heart
[1:13:34] if so who do you comfort me with your
[1:13:38] word
[1:13:39] now when he has a problem one day he had
[1:13:43] a recurring dreams of it he sees himself
[1:13:47] going back to the uh utility company and
[1:13:51] constantly and sometimes the bills will
[1:13:54] just disappear and he was what's going
[1:13:57] on Lord did I do something wrong tell me
[1:14:00] tell me but God is next answer him then
[1:14:04] he said I will just take my Bible this
[1:14:07] is a man who sees the Visions all the
[1:14:09] time but it's not for him he said okay
[1:14:12] well I will take my Bible okay oh in
[1:14:16] this Bible there must be a character
[1:14:19] that has just my situation
[1:14:23] let me open it and he opened he was on
[1:14:27] Eliza looking for Rebecca
[1:14:32] praise God
[1:14:35] you will wonder if he was his gift he
[1:14:37] will use it when he wants if you have
[1:14:40] money you won't go to McDonald's and get
[1:14:42] something
[1:14:43] you know but he was not ears
[1:14:47] yeah
[1:14:49] um you say and I did it you know how you
[1:14:53] take a Bible and just put it open like
[1:14:57] that you want to understand why his
[1:14:58] mother died I just took my fingers and
[1:15:03] ran down turn it open Matthew 9 Great
[1:15:08] Big Red Letters sticking out and she is
[1:15:13] not she's not dead but slippeth
[1:15:18] and first thing my eyes fell on the
[1:15:21] scripture when I looked down that of
[1:15:24] course not I don't want to use the Bible
[1:15:26] for a Ouija board you know
[1:15:29] we just don't do that but I was so tore
[1:15:33] up at that time I believe in that God
[1:15:36] let me see that because what followed
[1:15:39] proved it right that night of course I
[1:15:42] was Restless a rest it was a Restless uh
[1:15:47] was a restless night
[1:15:50] so but when I'm saying what I was doing
[1:15:52] with the Bible was not I was not playing
[1:15:54] like luck with the Bible I was desperate
[1:15:58] I was torn why did you take my mud
[1:16:01] without even tell me what is going on
[1:16:04] when he did it God tells him that his
[1:16:09] mother a character is in the Bible
[1:16:14] it is in a Jairus
[1:16:16] daughter
[1:16:19] that's your mother
[1:16:21] that's you her the bride she is a part
[1:16:25] of the Bride she's not dead she's
[1:16:28] sleeping
[1:16:31] let's encourage him he say this
[1:16:34] ah
[1:16:36] he said and the more the next morning
[1:16:39] got up I guess it was about eight
[1:16:42] o'clock in the room eight or maybe maybe
[1:16:46] later I begin to see children coming in
[1:16:50] they bringing in crippled children from
[1:16:54] everywhere look like it made about a
[1:16:59] city block wide and about two city
[1:17:02] blocks and just Afflicted children on
[1:17:05] the left side on the right side where
[1:17:08] people seated and and all along looked
[1:17:12] like it was up high so what happened is
[1:17:15] seeing a vision of a stadium and a
[1:17:20] children's
[1:17:22] Afflicted people are coming and and it's
[1:17:27] kind of a stadium run down then come up
[1:17:31] again in the back end to keep the very
[1:17:34] back people from not seeing they they
[1:17:37] could look forward uh forward at age
[1:17:41] while I was standing with a blue suit I
[1:17:44] thought now this is strange I'm standing
[1:17:47] in the room at home here but here I am
[1:17:51] in a blue suit and uh I was leading
[1:17:54] songs
[1:17:55] I was reading the singing bring them in
[1:17:59] bring them in making both sides thing
[1:18:04] bring the little ones to Jesus bring
[1:18:06] them in from the world of sin
[1:18:10] and he say
[1:18:12] and there was a renowned lady entered
[1:18:16] the back of the stadium
[1:18:19] somewhere another I knew that it was she
[1:18:23] was coming in but she started coming up
[1:18:27] through the audience and I was just keep
[1:18:30] leading the songs
[1:18:31] bring them in and I I said this side
[1:18:35] sing bring them in this side bring them
[1:18:40] in
[1:18:41] like that bring the Wonder ring once to
[1:18:45] Jesus I was going to pray for all this
[1:18:48] Lolo Afflicted children and sick and
[1:18:52] this lady
[1:18:54] came and went to the Box unlike in the
[1:18:58] theater where is like where the
[1:19:01] celebrities sit or a president box
[1:19:05] oh you know what I mean in that kind of
[1:19:09] place to to my left and the lady was
[1:19:12] just
[1:19:13] just got it and she turned around to the
[1:19:17] other people that was there I just bow
[1:19:21] her head I noticed she was dressed kind
[1:19:25] of
[1:19:27] old-fashioned and the lady turned around
[1:19:29] to bow to me just before and I I walked
[1:19:34] in the puppet then to preach
[1:19:39] and just as she held her head down I
[1:19:44] turned around and let DC to this to her
[1:19:48] and when I raised my head she raised up
[1:19:51] facing me to Mama elabrana and she
[1:19:56] looked at me and smiled she was young
[1:19:59] real young and the great thundering
[1:20:03] voice shook the place the words came and
[1:20:05] said do not worry about her she's like
[1:20:10] she was in 1906.
[1:20:14] amen and when the vision left me I
[1:20:17] looked to see thou what 1906 was that
[1:20:23] was the ear she was a bride to my father
[1:20:28] Jairus daughter
[1:20:30] the bride
[1:20:34] it was a type of the mother
[1:20:37] she's part of the Bride the bride of
[1:20:39] Christ what this tells you God when he
[1:20:43] was re writing the word he had you in
[1:20:48] the mind
[1:20:49] not only is he say to brother Branham
[1:20:52] you want comfort you want Comfort open
[1:20:56] the Bible he opens the Bible is it the
[1:20:59] generous daughter she's not dead she is
[1:21:04] sleeping
[1:21:05] then he had a vision in the vision he
[1:21:10] sees his mother
[1:21:12] and he say she is like she was in 1906.
[1:21:22] 1906 this is when she became the bride
[1:21:25] well 1909 Ella Branham was just a child
[1:21:32] she was 15 years old when she got uh
[1:21:39] William Brennan is that right
[1:21:42] 1906.
[1:21:45] how old was she
[1:21:47] you have to take -3
[1:21:51] if she was 15
[1:21:53] then -3
[1:21:55] she was 12.
[1:21:57] 12 years old how old was the Chinese
[1:22:01] daughter
[1:22:03] 12 years old
[1:22:06] when was she married at 12 brother when
[1:22:09] I'm continued saying my mother was a
[1:22:12] child herself
[1:22:14] giving
[1:22:15] birth
[1:22:18] I know I know you are quiet yeah yeah I
[1:22:23] know it was terrible
[1:22:25] yeah I know I know
[1:22:27] our mothers have my mother was married
[1:22:30] 15 years old
[1:22:33] at that time that's the knowledge people
[1:22:35] had
[1:22:37] can I say it
[1:22:40] my mother-in-law sister Julian was
[1:22:44] married at 14.
[1:22:47] people understand things later right
[1:22:52] but yeah
[1:22:54] she was 12 for bride
[1:22:57] now when you go back and look at Jairus
[1:23:00] story you will find her maybe the the
[1:23:05] those who wrote the Gospel like a look
[1:23:08] Mark and Matthew the way they refer to
[1:23:12] Jairus daughter is kind of different
[1:23:15] they they say child they they say Lulu a
[1:23:21] girl or they said maiden maiden is
[1:23:27] actually
[1:23:28] a woman of marriage Aid
[1:23:34] but all this they will inspire maybe for
[1:23:38] us this morning to see how God Comfort
[1:23:42] is Prophet with a character in the Bible
[1:23:47] that was exactly the mother 12 years old
[1:23:51] bride and Jerry's 12 years and is at 906
[1:23:59] strange that is the beginning of the the
[1:24:02] last Church age
[1:24:08] her life was written
[1:24:10] in the Bible your life is written in the
[1:24:15] Bible
[1:24:16] amen
[1:24:18] you are part of the word therefore you
[1:24:22] can't deny the word
[1:24:25] Therefore your life is spelled it spells
[1:24:28] something it spells out something
[1:24:31] sometimes you don't understand but you
[1:24:34] are writing something like Jesus writing
[1:24:37] on on the floor
[1:24:40] on the ground
[1:24:44] you are drawing a pattern
[1:24:48] your life as you living and obeying to
[1:24:52] God serving him you are actually writing
[1:24:55] something
[1:24:57] it's a pattern you don't know what you
[1:25:00] are talking about what what is happening
[1:25:03] sometimes you feel miserable but God
[1:25:06] looks at Ella Branham
[1:25:12] what she had to fulfill in her life
[1:25:16] even the day she she's dying she's
[1:25:19] telling brother Brennan uh Billy I see
[1:25:23] you yes Mom I'm here I see you you are
[1:25:27] old Billy you are very old
[1:25:31] what did you see she sees Elijah the
[1:25:34] prophet
[1:25:36] and our own son is Elijah the prophet is
[1:25:40] old he has long hair he has long beard
[1:25:43] he's holding her
[1:25:47] transferring her from this world to the
[1:25:50] other world
[1:25:52] oh what a life
[1:25:53] but she went through a lot of things
[1:25:55] married at 12 a baby at 15 husband
[1:25:59] alcoholic
[1:26:01] to add 10 children
[1:26:07] but her life was so important to the
[1:26:10] eyes of your father and my father
[1:26:14] 42 years she became a wider 42 living as
[1:26:20] a widow for 25 years
[1:26:25] but God sees our character in the Bible
[1:26:31] she was playing that part
[1:26:34] but she did not know do you know what
[1:26:36] part you're playing
[1:26:39] you are playing a great important part
[1:26:43] [Music]
[1:26:48] Christian we have to be encouraged
[1:26:51] we have to be angry we don't want to be
[1:26:54] arrogant but in the same time we cannot
[1:26:57] be walking like like you know we are
[1:27:00] miserable
[1:27:01] because our life is riding down
[1:27:04] something a pattern that we go we don't
[1:27:07] know why we're going this way
[1:27:09] we are writing down something
[1:27:14] amen
[1:27:15] sometimes it's hard if you look at this
[1:27:18] woman you will see that oh she went
[1:27:21] through a lot and she went to God
[1:27:24] doesn't care like what happens
[1:27:29] because this has to write
[1:27:33] something
[1:27:35] it's a prophecy that is being fulfilled
[1:27:39] just like Brother Carlos preaching we my
[1:27:42] son and I was we're like whoa we look at
[1:27:45] each other on Wednesday we had a good
[1:27:48] time
[1:27:49] good time oh my it's good when the Holy
[1:27:53] Ghost entertain us young people
[1:27:56] entertain you not Hollywood you can be
[1:27:59] screaming yourself in a room in the wood
[1:28:02] like crazy because the Holy Ghost is
[1:28:05] entertaining here hallelujah it's so
[1:28:09] good it's such a great time when he
[1:28:11] entertains you
[1:28:13] amen you cannot give that life for
[1:28:17] anything in the world
[1:28:20] amen
[1:28:25] amen
[1:28:28] and The Vision World
[1:28:36] you see at the end of her life
[1:28:40] sees her as a celebrity
[1:28:44] she she sit in that you know Cornwell
[1:28:47] big great people president where they
[1:28:51] they stand
[1:28:52] yet you say oh my life is miserable oh
[1:28:57] me
[1:28:59] what this woman did not see Ella Branham
[1:29:03] what did not say she's so so much but
[1:29:08] she had a great price in God's eyes
[1:29:17] amen
[1:29:25] look
[1:29:27] uh
[1:29:29] Luke mark
[1:29:32] and Matthew they all talk about this
[1:29:35] girl and whatever says that she was
[1:29:42] a
[1:29:43] um
[1:29:43] the she was
[1:29:46] as the to be very young
[1:29:51] to be very young
[1:29:54] is a sign of
[1:29:57] urgency
[1:29:58] like brother Brennan one day I think he
[1:30:01] was going to Jamaica Kingston he had a
[1:30:06] dream in that dream he saw himself
[1:30:11] ah he saw himself sitting with a 17
[1:30:15] years old girl
[1:30:17] him a 50 years old man
[1:30:22] sitting there like like the doing
[1:30:24] courtship
[1:30:25] looking at each other in eyes looking
[1:30:28] down
[1:30:30] he said when he woke up he said I
[1:30:32] screamed I say I'm going to Backside
[1:30:35] what am I doing with this girl 17 years
[1:30:39] old
[1:30:43] then he started even describing the girl
[1:30:48] even in some places they say she was not
[1:30:51] attractive you know her sister so and so
[1:30:54] the daughter of so and so remember that
[1:30:59] he will say he will describe even her
[1:31:02] lips how
[1:31:05] strange the only bread of Brenham can
[1:31:07] say that
[1:31:10] if he was here you will not see that
[1:31:13] sister the next service she's gone
[1:31:18] and he will say you know sister
[1:31:20] I think it was a brother Jack Moore
[1:31:23] daughter she could be in the service you
[1:31:26] know her she's not very attractive but
[1:31:31] and she was sitting with me
[1:31:34] but once you know
[1:31:36] the symbology of this is like she is not
[1:31:41] attractive button can say it I cannot
[1:31:43] say it any no nobody else can say it
[1:31:50] God has given to brother Brahm that
[1:31:52] ability
[1:31:54] that's why he took care of him when he
[1:31:56] was only seven years old
[1:32:00] he said don't drink
[1:32:03] don't smoke
[1:32:05] it was not he was trying to protect his
[1:32:08] liver or his lungs
[1:32:12] don't go after women at 70 years old
[1:32:16] everybody will be up and down and say
[1:32:19] how dare you tell a seven years old it
[1:32:23] is
[1:32:24] but God does whatever God wants to do
[1:32:28] he was not trying it was not protecting
[1:32:31] the the body of this boy he was
[1:32:36] protecting his mind
[1:32:39] yes our mind uh our mind is corrupted
[1:32:43] but God wants to limit the corruption on
[1:32:47] the mind of this boy because of the
[1:32:49] ministry that he will have
[1:32:52] therefore he can say just no shalanta
[1:32:56] that uh she's a beautiful woman there is
[1:32:59] an attractive woman here and he will
[1:33:02] just go with pure in his mind
[1:33:05] it has nothing to do with he's just
[1:33:08] saying fact
[1:33:11] this is yeah if his mind was corrupted
[1:33:15] how many visions that he had
[1:33:19] no how many think he sees he sees people
[1:33:22] in the rooms in the bedrooms in the
[1:33:25] doctor's office he sees this all kind of
[1:33:29] sickness he sees them he can tell you
[1:33:31] what you have if his mind was corrupted
[1:33:34] how could he say it
[1:33:39] and we all need a clean mind
[1:33:43] gotta help us
[1:33:47] so he could say that and he he woke up
[1:33:50] and said what is it he said the vision
[1:33:52] was that girl 17 years old was a little
[1:33:56] church the girl was a virgin just a
[1:34:00] child and that meant the Virgin sea of
[1:34:03] the church
[1:34:04] and the Three City Blocks up the hill
[1:34:07] was a three days I would Minister in
[1:34:11] Kingston okay Kingston Jamaica I don't
[1:34:15] remember the town and taking the little
[1:34:18] virgin Church by my Ministry from where
[1:34:22] she was on higher in the things of God
[1:34:25] until it shook the entire Island
[1:34:31] that's why you have to describe her once
[1:34:34] it takes her those three days she he
[1:34:38] mature she'd get the beauty of Jesus
[1:34:46] if it was me I would not
[1:34:48] I cannot say it the prophet has to say
[1:34:51] it thank God for the pure mind
[1:34:56] thank God for that that he can say
[1:34:59] things just without
[1:35:01] you know
[1:35:03] too much of Balancing Act
[1:35:17] and he took the damself by the hand
[1:35:21] and say unto her
[1:35:24] the uh which is being interpreted
[1:35:29] demsa I say unto thee
[1:35:32] your eyes
[1:35:34] and straight away the damselves
[1:35:37] and walked for she was the age of 12.
[1:35:42] and they were astonished with great
[1:35:44] astonishment and he tried them
[1:35:47] straightly that no man should know it
[1:35:49] and commend that
[1:35:52] something should be given her to eat
[1:35:56] when the Lord said that to his ministers
[1:35:59] it must be the word
[1:36:02] the word with all the ingredients the
[1:36:06] word of this time the bride age message
[1:36:10] The Eighth Day where there is no
[1:36:13] Darkness
[1:36:14] how can God leave us in our loudness
[1:36:17] here people don't you understand
[1:36:23] it's
[1:36:24] bringing the standard a little higher
[1:36:27] Eleanor High why the love of the demons
[1:36:31] have changed too
[1:36:33] yeah
[1:36:35] that's right anything else will not work
[1:36:38] our emotional issues will not find a
[1:36:41] solution without the true word of God
[1:36:45] again I will repeat God throw Golden
[1:36:48] Nugget in the message for you to go and
[1:36:51] pick it up for the preacher to pick it
[1:36:53] up when you come Sunday Wednesday they
[1:36:56] just throw it to you
[1:36:57] amen
[1:37:02] question is an answer
[1:37:05] when a person realized that has he has
[1:37:09] an inferior complex or some sort of
[1:37:11] complex
[1:37:13] how may he overcome this so should I be
[1:37:17] he was the only child who caused this in
[1:37:21] his early youth the person seems to be
[1:37:24] very educated
[1:37:26] brother Branham goes straight to the
[1:37:28] answer
[1:37:29] when you feel like you have a complex
[1:37:32] take exact exactly the opposite
[1:37:36] okay
[1:37:37] if if you are always wanting your way
[1:37:43] that one little brat you see you see how
[1:37:46] problem talk
[1:37:48] without even thinking about it little
[1:37:50] brat
[1:37:52] if I say it everybody will go to brother
[1:37:55] Chad's office no more brother Kadima
[1:38:03] okay if you are always wanting your way
[1:38:06] that one little brat that wants to
[1:38:09] always have everything your way turn
[1:38:12] right back around turn that right back
[1:38:15] around and give everything you got to
[1:38:17] the other well you feel like your type
[1:38:21] of ah complex is me me me me
[1:38:27] hey do the country
[1:38:29] oh
[1:38:31] yeah it's that simple yes that simple
[1:38:36] just to do the country
[1:38:38] this person doesn't like me uh they
[1:38:41] don't this person okay this brother
[1:38:44] doesn't like me this sister doesn't like
[1:38:45] me okay do the country go to that
[1:38:48] brother and sister say God bless you
[1:38:51] brother
[1:38:52] do the contrary do the opposite the
[1:38:56] prophet called it to do the vice versa
[1:38:58] thank God for them
[1:39:00] yes
[1:39:02] just go just go you see the problem is
[1:39:06] you are standing in God's way right your
[1:39:09] ambition your ego
[1:39:12] he said just go
[1:39:14] hi brother hi sister God bless you oh
[1:39:16] she always when when I approached she
[1:39:19] just give me a look man the prophet said
[1:39:22] to the country
[1:39:25] okay well are you able or okay
[1:39:29] I have to say it very
[1:39:31] you know because some people will not
[1:39:34] get the principle like me I am a picture
[1:39:38] person I'm visual when I say these
[1:39:41] things
[1:39:42] is to give the people that have the
[1:39:45] visual like me they are detailed
[1:39:47] oriented rather than
[1:39:50] principle oriented
[1:39:52] yeah go
[1:39:54] and set
[1:39:56] yeah hi Brenda even say I love you
[1:40:00] I love you brother I love you sister
[1:40:03] many people do it here it's wonderful
[1:40:07] yeah
[1:40:09] yeah the devil said well you say you
[1:40:11] love her but you don't no I'm confessing
[1:40:16] I am confessing I love you my brother my
[1:40:20] soul said that I love you my mind
[1:40:23] corrupted Maybe
[1:40:25] doing some tricks on me yeah
[1:40:34] if you are selfish and you want to hold
[1:40:37] everything then start giving away what
[1:40:40] you you got see whatever just go the
[1:40:44] vice versa
[1:40:46] that's the way to overcome anything is
[1:40:49] antidote
[1:40:51] my old southern mother used to say air
[1:40:54] off the back the dog back is good for
[1:40:57] the bite
[1:40:59] what is it idiom
[1:41:02] grammar teacher is that an idiom or
[1:41:06] something like that wow
[1:41:09] so you see just do the other way around
[1:41:15] and that's what it is
[1:41:19] not easy of course it's not easy
[1:41:24] but the first thing you say to the word
[1:41:26] of God is amen
[1:41:28] once you say Amen to it you say God do
[1:41:31] you know me I am this flesh you know
[1:41:35] what it is
[1:41:36] this mind of me you know what it is but
[1:41:39] I will apply what you say because that
[1:41:42] the solution
[1:41:47] so God has given us a word
[1:41:51] and he has commanded the ministers
[1:41:54] to preach that word
[1:41:57] to bring that food
[1:42:00] even have raised the standard Isaiah 59
[1:42:04] 19 so they shall
[1:42:08] so shall they fear the name of the Lord
[1:42:11] from the West in his glory from the
[1:42:14] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[1:42:17] come in like a flood the spirit of the
[1:42:20] Lord
[1:42:21] shall
[1:42:23] lift up a standard against him that
[1:42:28] standard is not a code of conduct it's
[1:42:31] not like by six o'clock you'll be in a
[1:42:33] bed
[1:42:34] it is the word
[1:42:37] God derived raised the word
[1:42:39] pray for anybody who want to
[1:42:43] stay here
[1:42:44] because the bride has been called to go
[1:42:46] a little higher okay so why higher
[1:42:50] because that's where the ingredients are
[1:42:52] the golden nuggets all the things that
[1:42:56] we need to sustain our life that's where
[1:42:59] they are
[1:43:01] so why do you stay here okay no no no
[1:43:04] it's the eight days where Jesus scream
[1:43:07] whoever
[1:43:09] need to drink
[1:43:11] come and drink freely
[1:43:15] amen it's that day we're living in
[1:43:18] amen
[1:43:20] oh my
[1:43:23] oh my do you love him amen okay I'm
[1:43:28] winding down
[1:43:36] spiritual adoption
[1:43:42] and and may I take this moment to say
[1:43:45] this my friend the entire Church of the
[1:43:47] Living God is built assembly upon the
[1:43:51] spiritual revelation of the Lord Jesus
[1:43:53] Christ no matter how educated you are

[1:44:00] think you know the Bible said and knows
[1:44:03] it to just a lot better than you but

[1:44:38] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail it though I
[1:44:42] would be against it will be against it
[1:44:45] yet it cannot Prevail for when the enemy
[1:44:49] comes in like a flood the spirit of God
[1:44:52] will raise the standard against it every
[1:44:56] time what's tender the word the word of
