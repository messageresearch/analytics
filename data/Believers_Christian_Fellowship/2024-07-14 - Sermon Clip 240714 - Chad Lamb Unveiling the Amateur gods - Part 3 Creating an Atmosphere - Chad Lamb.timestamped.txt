[0:00] I want the atmosphere of the word all
[0:01] around me so that means I need to think
[0:03] about the word I need to talk about the
[0:05] word I need to be in the realm of the
[0:06] atmosphere of the word that creates an
[0:08] atmosphere around
[0:10] me
[0:12] Amen brother B says in the mo in the
[0:14] message token he's talking about the
[0:16] token now which is the baptism of the
[0:18] Holy Ghost and it's the life of God
[0:20] inside he says apply it and create that
[0:22] atmosphere around you and they'll just
[0:25] drop right into he's talking about the
[0:26] loved ones and the ones you desire to
[0:28] see saved the ones that you're praying
[0:29] for they'll just drop right into it oh
[0:31] you are you if you got the token you
[0:34] create a spirit around you a power that
[0:37] when you walk people know that you're a
[0:39] Christian they love for you to say
[0:41] something to them they believe your word
[0:43] what you say they hold on to it see
[0:45] that's it man how many of you will have
[0:48] people at work that even sometimes will
[0:51] laugh at you a little bit because of the
[0:53] stand you take or even family members
[0:54] they'll they'll be a little bit critical
[0:56] of your Holiness or the the fact that
[0:58] you know you're too religious or
[1:00] whatever it is amen but when they hit a
[1:02] crisis where do they come when sickness
[1:05] strikes their family when something's
[1:07] going wrong the very person that they
[1:09] they made a little bit of fun of they
[1:10] want to get over close to and ask you
[1:11] some questions and they want to say well
[1:13] what do you think about what's going on
[1:15] and and this or that and and and they
[1:17] want you to pray for them they want you
[1:18] to talk to them because they know that
[1:20] something in you is real and in the time
[1:22] of Crisis they know where it's at
[1:24] because they felt it you created the
[1:26] atmosphere around you sometimes we don't
[1:28] even know the effect that were having on
[1:30] people by creating that atmosphere but
[1:32] when the time of Crist is hit sometimes
[1:34] you see amen how did they know where to
[1:36] come when they were sick how did they
[1:38] know where to come when their marriage
[1:40] was falling apart or when they had a son
[1:41] or daughter that was getting caught up
[1:43] in worldly things and running astray how
[1:45] did they know where to come and why are
[1:46] they talking to me about their personal
[1:51] problems why am I the workplace
[1:55] counselor anybody ever felt that way
[1:58] it's the atmosphere that's in you it's
[2:00] it's God that's dwelling in you it's the
[2:02] atmosphere you create it's the word it's
[2:04] the love it's something that's reaching
[2:06] out there's virtue that they can draw
[2:08] from there's a well there that they can
[2:10] tap into and in a time of Crisis they
[2:12] begin to realize amen when everything's
[2:14] well and they don't want to change and
[2:15] they don't like the conflict of The lust
[2:17] spirit with the the the Holiness am mean
[2:19] they may stay away they may make little
[2:21] comments not nasty not mean but just a
[2:23] little bit oh I know you wouldn't go for
[2:25] that or I know you wouldn't go there but
[2:27] the minute they have a need they come
[2:29] right up to you and say Hey listen I got
[2:31] this and my wife and my son and this and
[2:33] that and the other and you're standing
[2:34] here like why are you telling me all of
[2:37] this listen I'll tell you why they're
[2:39] telling you all of that they need the
[2:41] god that's inside of you they need an
[2:42] amateur God right then on the earth they
[2:45] need someplace to draw virtue from
[2:47] somebody that can give them something
[2:49] more than rhetoric something more than
[2:50] talking points something with substance
[2:52] a real life somebody that can say the
[2:55] word but more than say the word say I
[2:57] will pray for you if you if you believe
[2:59] this I can pray for you and God can move
[3:01] on your behalf
