========================================

what a day of rejoicing and will when we jesus [Music] amen flow through me holy spirit is that your prayer this evening flows through me [Applause] and as i lift my hands to worship and to magnify thy name spirit flow through me one more time [Music] [Music] spirit [Music] me and as i lift my hands to worship and to magnify thy name [Music] praise god i don't know if there can be any more wonderful thing that we experience on this earth than allow his spirit to flow through us that he would take control and use us for his glory and while we're standing let's turn to ephesians chapter one and begin there we're going to continue on with the thought we were on sunday this is going to be place sons part two and i just like i said feel the inspiration to continue on with this thought with this line of teaching and preaching and just until i feel not to anymore amen and i just want to take my time and just talk about it because when you look at adoption it's a huge subject uh it's it's very big it's a it's hard to to wrap it all up tightly in one little package at least for me it is and so just as i'm going through and studying amen things i see i'm just going to bring and preach the way god gives it to me and you pull and we'll just trust god to give us what we need in this hour that we're in and it's like everything else that we understand in the scripture and through the message amen there's maybe things that aren't new not brand new concepts or brand new terms but as the eagle spreads her wings and catch the updraft she circles you know higher and higher and she may circle in the same diameter she circled before but now she's higher and brother branham says when you go every time an eagle goes higher it can see farther it said its vision becomes better is what brother venom said so we may we may circle some familiar territory some terms and maybe ideas or concepts that have been preached before or scriptures or quotes but just keep circling and let's see if we can't see more clearly than we saw last time amen ephesians chapter 1 and verse 3. blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved let's bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing dear heavenly father we thank you lord lord you're so precious to us and god this word is more than print on paper we know that this is you in print form lord your word has a life to it lord that life is your life and that life is our life lord and as we read this word lord maybe more than reading but may there be a revelation that strikes her soul may there be an awakening lord to that portion that's within us to be lived out in this day what i pray that you would speak through these human lips that you would hear through our ears in order that you would give us the the things that we have need of for this hour that we're upon this earth may you be glorified in all that's said and all that's done may you find welcome in our hearts in this place lord and lord may we go out from here lord a little higher lord with a greater understanding and a clearer vision and purpose than when we came in we ask your blessings in all things in jesus christ's name we pray amen if you can all be seated thank you very much and i want to go back and read in verse 5 again because it's the theme of what i want to talk about having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so we know in this scripture like we spoke on sunday that he's predestinated us unto adoption uh he's done that so we've been predestinated according to his good pleasure to the good pleasure of his will so it really wasn't based on anything that we've done or had done or will do because god predestinated us according to his good pleasure so it's what god wanted to do but what he's predestinated us unto in this scripture he's not just talking about his predestinated us unto salvation or he's predestinated us to hear the message or he's predestinated us to be a child of god that's not what he's speaking in this scripture it goes further than that i mean it encompasses that but it goes beyond that because he's predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself and this adoption brother branham really explains it to us clearly but but there's a word here in the greek that i'm going to try to pronounce but but in the concordance when you look up this word next to it it says from a presumed compound of word number 5207 and a derivative of 5087 well we don't have to presume that it's a compound because brother benham said these things go together and it's what it means so for them it's a presumed compound for us it's a fact this is the way the prophet taught it but we'll take these two words that they're talking about that go together and the first word in this compound just means a son not referring to an animal not referring to just offspring but a human son an offspring a descendant of an individual and then secondly the second part of this that's in this compound to make up this understanding or the proper understanding for this adoption of children is the word that means to lay to put to make to a point and it means to set to put or to place so when we talk about the adoption of children it's really like brother branham said the placing of sons he made it very simple but that's even what we understand out of the out of the word out of the concordance that it's the placing of sons that it's not just the fact that you're a son you're a son before the foundation of the world you're a son in the mind of god you've always been a son and daughter of god you always will be a son and daughter of god no matter what takes place you're a son and daughter of god that was predetermined you were in god you can never be anything else but that but he wants these sons of god amen to be positionally placed here upon this earth in a position in a place in the body of christ to do something a specific work a portion of the ministry of christ that's been given to each attribute the plan of god the plan of god that encompasses all of his attributes every single attribute is encompassed in the plan of god and you believe you're one of the attributes of god from before the foundation of the world then god expressed you in this generation in this time for a purpose and that expression wasn't just so that he could bring you forth and he could say you're saved and you say i'm saved and you're a child of god i'm a child of god that's wonderful that we come to that realization but that realization amen needs to go further beyond the realization that i come from god and i go to god but i come from god and i'm called for a purpose and there's a position for me today and there's a work for me to do as an attribute of god to be displayed through this body of flesh in this time that we're in now and if we miss that we've never actually come to the right kind of maturity yet because adoption one way to for me for me one way to understand adoption is just maturity when a son you know brother rem tells us the story and he takes the he takes the analogy he takes the scriptures out of galatians amen where a son is no more than a servant and he's given over to governors until the time appointed amen and brother of them starts to to tell us when he's preaching adoption and other messages he starts to explain this how a man will have a a a land maybe he's got a ranch maybe and he's got different people in charge of different things and they they're raising sheep and they're raising grain and they're raising cattle and he's got different ones officers said over all of this but he's got a son and that son is an heir to all that's his but that son cannot become an heir without the right kind of character because that son will destroy everything that the father has worked for so we understand adoption this is what this is what he's brother benham's explaining adoption this son is a son he's an heir he's the heir to the father but because the father amen has a vision has a purpose for this son he puts this son under a governor under a tutor and brother said that's the holy ghost and the holy ghost is leading this son teaching the son the word the laws of the father and when the holy ghost reports back brother branham dramatizes it amen he's reporting back he says father he's just like you you should have seen him the other day amen he handled those sheep just the way you want him to be handled amen and when i give him the word amen he just keeps the word just exactly the way that you wrote the word and and what he's showing is in this analogy and the story and this drama that brother branham's giving us he's showing that this sign amen is put under certain tests and certain instruction by the holy ghost by the word amen so that he can mature into a place that he can be entrusted in a position a meant to handle things the way god would handle them to conduct himself the way god would conduct himself to be in that that position as a mature amen believer as a mature christian amen it doesn't mean as a perfect believer as a perfect christian but but as a mature believer as a mature christian that will begin to handle things by the word amen that will begin to handle things the way the father would and the way the father would handle it is by the word and so and even in the in the in the analogy brother branham gives or the drama he says when the holy ghost is reporting back to the father he's saying and i've tested him i put him through everything i'd i stomped him down amen and he come right back and he says i put sickness on him and he come right back he wouldn't quit amen wherever i went he followed me and i said i'm going up here and he says and this and the son to the tutor would say well i'm going with you wherever you go i'm going he said but it's a high hill he said i'll go wait if you'll just hold my hand i'll go wherever you go but it's treacherous but i'll go where you go amen and that's the report that he's giving back to the father amen that this son would never leave holy ghost leadership and would do everything according to the father's will which his word is his will amen when the father heard amen that this son kept the word amen and always followed the leadership of the holy ghost now he said i'll bring him to a place now that set aside a place and bring him to a place and let's set him before the people and give him the garment give him the ring brother says give him the checkbook and his word is as good as my word and and all of these things coming into adoption coming into placing coming to a positioning where now the son is given authority and a position and a place and his word is as good as his father's word but so when we come to this uh adoption that we're talking about the way brother brahman says it's not also it's not the end of the journey because now the sun is going to start conducting business on behalf of the father amen but he's still going to do it according to the father's word according to the father's will by the leadership of the holy ghost none of that is changing it's not like he's arriving he got to this place and he's done the you know he's still he's on behalf of the father he's in place of the father the father's wanting him now you go take care of this thing you go take care of this part of the farm you go lead the servants and and and and the people i've put in charge now you take leadership but never outside of the father's leadership and never apart from the holy ghost leadership and never outside the word and you realize that even after adoption the father can change tasks for the sun i want you to go sure up this part of the farm or this part of this state and when that shirt up i want you to go over here see when we come to adoption sometimes all it is is not all of this because it's a lot so i got to be careful the way i say things i don't mean to trivialize are all of this but it's really coming to a maturity in christ where god can trust you to do a work for him he can trust you to do something on his behalf he can trust you to take leadership over something or or some responsibility amen it doesn't mean that's all you ever do it doesn't mean that's the only thing you've ever called to it doesn't mean he won't ever ask you to do anything else like we went through last time you know brother branham he was called to be a minister he was a preacher he went he was evangelizing then he became a pastor and he pastored for more than 10 years and and after he was passing before 10 years he was called into worldwide evangelism with the healing ministry now after that amen god really brought him to the the real purpose see there i go again i don't mean the real purpose it was all god's purpose but god always had a target in mind amen this was the seventh church age messenger before the foundation of the world this was the vessel he was going to use to fulfill the words amen and and uh in malachi 4 and and he's going to use him to fulfill amen luke 17 30 is going to use this vessel to fulfill in revelations chapter 10. so that was the thing he was always striving for amen but along the way he would give him responsibility here amen to call lost souls he gave him responsibility as a pastor responsibility in a worldwide healing ministry and then an ultimate responsibility to put the sword in his hand for the opening of the word so when you come to this place of maturity adoption is a maturity where god now can entrust you with a work amen praise god if i could say it you know brother brahm says so many things about adoption and so many things about placing i mean you can you can go one way with it another way with it but i'm just trying to go the way that god has led me with it to with with an understanding that when you when we come to this place of maturity because god never takes away free moral agency we always he will not violate a law of free moral agency so so god he already knows what will be he hasn't expected end when we were created he knew that he knew the thoughts he had towards us to bring us to an expected end amen he knew our members when they were not yet fashioned in the womb he already knew what you would look like amen according to the scriptures so god already knew he had a projection for you had a goal in mind amen but god has so said his law that he cannot he cannot have this projection or this goal robotically he must have it by free will he must have a son that will desire to be a son and a son that will desire to act like a son a son that desires to be led by the tudor a son that desires amen to be led by the word amen and we can under free moral agency we can become lazy sons we can become amen sons who reject the tutor to go our own way we can be sons or daughters amen who who slough off in our studies and and cast off our responsibilities and and as we do that i mean i've heard it i i've heard so many things just like so many of you have heard so many things that make me cringe and things that i don't understand but but as you go along you begin to understand things better and you begin to hear people say things like well you know if if i was given the opportunity to preach you know i i'd have something to say or they make little statements like that or or you know i don't have anything to do or nothing to say and nobody will listen to me or and i wonder have you been listening to the tutor have you been following the father's instructions i mean if god if you feel cheated like you've not been placed or not god's never given you a responsibility or anything to do for the kingdom of god my question is what are you doing amen as a student under the tutor because sometimes we want to we want to cut amen and just get to get to something that looks special or get to something that looks uh in the eyes of man something that looks important but what was important is when that son learned all those lessons along the way and matured amen through every trial through the sickness through the beating down amen through every obstacle that come learn to take the word take the word take the word what was that son learning he was learning to do it the way the father wants it done amen and when we haven't learned that yes in lesson yet and we still want to do it the way we want to do it we've not come to a place yet where god can entrust us to do something on his behalf it doesn't mean we're not a son we were a son before the foundation of the world it doesn't even mean you're not born again and baptized with the holy ghost but what it means is is we have not yet amen given over our total will and utter submission to the leadership of the holy ghost so that god can trust us with some responsibility because how could he entrust us with responsibility we're not responsible with simple basic commandments in the bible so how can he how can he entrust us amen with with with song ministry or music ministry or or or deacon on off as a deacon or trustee or even teach sunday school how can you teach little kids if you're not teachable if the holy ghost can't take the word and teach you to obey the word how are you going to teach four and five-year-olds you see so we we sometimes want to do something amen but we've been given something to do be a good son be a good daughter that's the first principle so we've been uh called predestinated unto the placing of sons so your your position in the body the work that you'll do known before known unto god were all his works before the beginning before the foundation of the world he knew what would happen you were you were you were his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works that he hath ordained that you should walk in them so there's a portion for each one of the attributes of god there's a work for us to do amen but but god is going to make sure that our free moral agency is surrendered unto his will only he knows how to do that brother brahm says in perfect strength by perfect weakness we need a place of yielding to the spirit instead of so much depending upon schooling and upon our programs our campaigns and all that we have we rely upon a cooperation with so many different ministers to cooperate we always say if we can get so many why we won't do it if we can't get so many we won't do it we won't go to the cities without that and then when we do that we are making it in a great big machine that's got a carbon knock in it see so we've got to get away from that that human ability we the first the first the first lesson i'll just say the first lesson in maturing in christ is get away from human ability quit thinking you can do it if you think you can do it i could preach i could be a song lear i could be a d if you think you can do it you're not ready yet i could do a bible study i could teach that i could if you think you can do it you're not ready yet we got to get away from human ability there's nothing wrong with saying you know god's called me to that and when somebody says you know you know we recognize gifts in one another and you say you know you're so good at this or i really appreciate the way you do this and you i mean you don't have to be ashamed of that you don't have to be embarrassed of that you can say i thank god for it like if it blesses you and it helps you i thank god for it amen that's why i'm on this earth that's what i'm here for amen we don't have to hang our head in shame or say don't don't don't don't ever pay me no compliment brother brandon had a discussion with the minister one time the minister says i just hate it when somebody comes up and thanks me for the service and brother said i'm just more honest than you he goes i like it when they say that it means that that they heard what i said it means that it helped them it means it was a benefit brother branham wasn't egotistical about it he didn't do it for the thank yous but it was satisfying to him to know that god was able to use him to touch that person it should be satisfying to us to know that god was able to use us to do something for his kingdom not in a way of pride not in a way of arrogancy amen so we don't have to have a false humility and say no no don't thank me i didn't have anything to do with just say i'm glad it was a blessing to you because that's the reality well i'm thankful that you were blessed i'm thankful you were encouraged i'm thankful that was a help to you because that should be the real attitude if you were blessed by something god did through me i am so grateful amen that god could take a pile of dirt amen anoint it with his spirit and place an attribute on the inside and anoint it with his spirit and get something out of this pile of dirt and if he gets anything out of it it wasn't because of the pile of dirt it was because of his attribute anointed by his spirit and if he can do that through this vessel i am thankful for that and i'm happy about it but i know it wasn't me i mean that's the reality that's the balance to it i know it wasn't me sometimes there's a false humility when somebody says no don't thank me you know no it wasn't me we know it wasn't you i mean come on you know you know you may write a beautiful song and the words just absolutely hit the spot somebody comes up and say thank you for that song you don't have to say oh don't thank me don't say anything i didn't do anything i'm nobody well we know you're nobody that goes without saying we weren't saying you were anything special we were just saying we appreciated your yielding we appreciate your obedience we appreciate a vessel that god can work through i'm thankful for that and if you're that vessel that god used in whatever way to be a help to be an encouragement whatever way god uses it and somebody comes back and says that bless me you should be grateful in your heart you should have something well up on the inside says i'm so grateful god can use this vessel with all my mistakes with all my failures with all the questions that run through my mind with all my doubts about myself and everything else god still can permeate all of that and do something to bless a brother sister i'm thankful for that we just need to be real with where we're at and real with things and no false humility and no none of that just be real don't think you can do anything we know you can't we we've we've been in this journey together long enough we know they're none of us are superhuman superheroes thank god god puts us in close enough proximity to one another that we know that you're not a superhero i'm not a superhero you're not superhuman i'm not superhuman but god can take the ordinary and do the extraordinary and when we see god take the ordinary and do the extraordinary it blesses our hearts amen it encourages us if god can use my brother to do that and god can use my sister to do that then he can do something with me too so we've got to get away from that human ability and what brother ben was talking about is trying amen trying to make something happen get a school of thought or coordination of ministers or get a group together to pull something off amen we've got to stop all of that we've got to get to a place where we can surrender our souls and lives even to the housewife to the farmer to the mechanic or whoever we are we got to surrender completely to god and know that we are nothing then let god start from there so i say that's the beginning know that we're nothing and then let god start from there then he starts moving working and that includes all of us everyone the thing that we got to do history proves does now proves that god always chose the nobodies to become his somebodies god takes the person that's nothing so i'd like to say today if god is using you to do his work then you're nobody so don't tell me or nobody i believe it because god takes the nobodies to do something 1965 things that are to be says you know what you ought to do said people believe you to be a prophet you ought to be teaching those women how to get gifts of prophecy and things like that and great higher things instead of little things i said how am i going to teach them algebra when they won't even learn their abcs when they won't even do the common things see the natural thing how you going to tell them hi things when you won't even start you want to get on the top of the ladder before you hit the first that's the reason you fall you get at the bottom and climb right on up as god leads you see cope your life in every and ever follow every bit of the word that god has ordained for you to do so i want to do something for god i want to do something for god first recognize your nobody and reject all human ability first step realize you're nobody you're nothing if it's dependent upon you amen nothing you do will ever come to success everything you do will always be a failure and just come to terms with that right out of the shoot i'm nobody i have no ability i can't do anything on my own if anything's going to happen through this clump of dirt it's got to be god doing it step one now i say the next thing is start at the bottom of the ladder don't give your heart to the lord have an experience with god and said i'm ready to go preach and you're not ready to go preach you've got to learn how to be a good steward of your money you got to learn how to treat other people right you got to learn how to not to backbite you got to learn how not to be proud and arrogant you've got a lot of things to learn before you can ever go out and do a work for the lord amen we're gonna start on the bottom rung amen and as the lord leads us to that bottom rung we make sure we get our finances in order we learn how to put god first and pay our tithes amen then we learn how to come to church every time the doors are open to be part of a body we learn how to get along with other personalities and different opinions and different ideas within that body i mean if we can't get on that run there's nothing else for us to do and that's why some people say well i could if i would but nobody ever picks me and they never think of me for this or i wonder why you can't pay your tithes yet the basics of the basics of the basics we can't even do that we can't even be faithful to church we can't even get along with our brothers and sisters how in the world can god bring us into a place of adoption where he trusts us with the work to do to work on his behalf amen how can he do that when we're violating his word all the time so we start on the bottom of the ladder and say god teach me how to be like you lead me by the holy ghost the holy ghost lead you to the word amen you recognize that god said i'm supposed to pay tithes it shows my respect and love towards god and my understanding that all comes from god that's what tithe does he say it's not just about money amen it's not just about how much money it's not just about the church needing your money amen nobody needs your money god doesn't need your money the church doesn't need your money god provides everything that's needed it's not about it's not about helping the church it's about serving god and recognizing god is god and everything i got comes from god and the only way for me to secure the 90 is to give the 10. the 10 is the security for the 90 percent amen when you give a tithe to god you haven't given nothing it's all it is i mean there's no puffing up the chest there's no being i paid my tithe today you've done nothing you just come from zero from below zero up to zero now you're at the starting point there's nothing special amen we go from there and we we we learn how to be faithful to church why because his word says to we learn how to love the brethren why because his word says to we learn how to have a positive confession why because his word says to and from there we go to the next run to the next run to the next run but we got we got we we sometimes see individuals who they want to get higher up on the ladder amen and they haven't even begun to climb through the basics yet so brother jeff said that's why you fall you're trying to get on the top and skip all these other rungs and it's not going to work you know god is patient amen if you think about his creation and how long it took to unfold his great mystery plan and how many thousands of years and individuals and seemingly going forward and seemingly going backwards and allowing men to make mistakes and using those mistakes for good my god is patience if i had to deal with what he dealt with through the bible i would have just said scrap the whole thing and start over but god knows what he's doing he's working something he's trying to get a character he's painting a picture he's playing out a drama every part is going to be there and he's going to work his body up from from the legs to the thighs and then to the hands up to the head that's how god does his work and he's very patient and he'll be patient with us we have to be patient with him first corinthians chapter 7 first corinthians chapter seven i'm going to start with verse 17. first corinthians 7 and 17 but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called everyone so let him walk and so ordain i in all churches is any man called being circumcised let him not not not become uncircumcised is any called in uncircumcision let him not be circumcised circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of god that every man abide in the same calling wherewith he was called art thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be free use it rather for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lord's free man likewise also that is called being free is christ's servant you're bought with the price be not ye the servant of men brethren let every man wearing his he call where wherein he is called there and abide with god so the apostle paul is telling us the way god called you stay there until god called you to something else but stay there even tell the soldier remain a soldier if you're a soldier made a soldier just do no man harm and don't cheat anybody but remain a soldier do no violence but remain a soldier so if you're a servant remain a servant if you're free use it rather for the good use it but if you're if you're free you're christ's slave anyway so what does it matter if you if you're called the way god calls you the way the way god calls you to stay that way until he tells you to do something different don't don't you know come to the lord give your heart to the lord and all of a sudden start looking around for something to do i need a job a lot of that is not really a love for god there's a lot of that that's really a love for self and the desire to be somebody to that seeking for a position seeking for a title sitting for word it's masked in all kind of religious rhetoric but it's really self-centeredness i want to i want a position i want to be somebody i want to be respected i want nobody says that of course they say i just really want to do something for the lord if you want to do something for the lord pay your tithe come to church love the brother that'll be doing something for the lord keep the word keep every commandment from the tiniest to the greatest if you really love the lord love the lord amen surrender to him follow the tudor obey every commandment and then do as he leads and as he called if you really love the lord so so so much of that quick i can i do this can i do can i have that i want to do this you know just wait be patient if you really love the lord love him in every area of your life if you really love the lord and you want to do something for the lord amen then you surrender your private life to him you surrender your thought life to him before you ever want to do something publicly make sure that your private life is matching the word make sure that you got overcoming in the private thoughts of your life and the privacy of your own home or your own room make sure that that is surrendered to god amen don't even seek anything else to do for the kingdom of god until god has a vessel that he can work through so we got to start on the bottom of the ladder we're going to make sure we got to make sure that we stay there long enough to realize we're dirt i mean we've got to stay there long enough to realize that i'm struggling with my own self-will like i don't want to do this thing that the holy ghost is leading me through i don't want to do this thing that's written in the word amen and you've got to stay there to you start losing all confidence and self and all confidence and human ability and you got to stay down there on the lower parts of the rung of the ladder under the governor under the tudor to realize i am a selfish self-centered self-loving human being and until you realize that you're not really to come to utter complete death i mean there's got to be a loathing of the hybridization there's got to be loathing of the carnal nature there's got to be something that you you've been there long enough to realize that hey you know what i am messing everything up everything i try fails amen i'm trying to surrender to god and i keep getting in the way and until you lose all human ability you're not ready to do anything for the kingdom of god so we stay there and you have some ups and some downs and some successes and some failures and it's all important god's what's god doing he's bringing maturity to his children bring us to his place where he can he can trust you to do something on his behalf and and so we we when when we're called we receive the new birth just stay what you are then until he makes you do something different and when you really see somebody under adoption under that maturity being moved amen you really see them you really see uh god moving people into position that don't want it i mean you see it over and over again not that they don't want to serve god i mean not that they don't want to do something for the lord but really that you you see people get moved who says oh lord you know i couldn't do that praise god lord i couldn't do that and he says oh that's exactly what i'm looking for god i i mean surely not me there's got to be somebody else that you would rather have do that that's really when you're getting down to something that he can use because we've lost all human ability and all confidence in self and then you see somebody struggle with that and finally they move into what god's leading them into and what god's calling and when they move in there amen they do it with the realization that i'm here because god wants me here i'm here because i want to serve god and i love god more than i love myself and then that's somebody that god can have confidence in brother branham says in the message adoption part 2 from 1960 it says then did you notice moses that great miracle performer that brought down brought israel down through the land and brought them up to the promised land but did not place their inheritance to them he did not give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but joshua divided the land to the people is that right and christ brought the church up to the place where their possession was made to them was given to them just to jordan the cross but the holy spirit is the one who sets the church in order the joshua of today puts the church in its order giving to each one gifts places position and he is the voice of god speaking to the inner man that christ has saved the holy spirit now do you get that much of it now we're getting over into the book of ephesians now the same way he positionally placing the church where they belong now joshua placed them in the natural land now the holy spirit is placing the church positionally in the land in the position they belong in their inheritance so now we're with the holy ghost is putting the body the many member body into position by holy ghost leadership not by our own ideas or our own understanding or even our own wishes but we're moved and put in position by holy ghost leadership he goes on in the same message to say but now to place how are you you're first born into the kingdom by the holy ghost how many knows that all right next you're predestinated into what adoption what is that you're predestinated unto the placing and then i'll read the next quote and i'll comment on this we are predestinated to the adoption of sons now how many understand what i mean raise up your hands adoption we're born in the spirit of god sure receive the holy ghost and cry have a father hallelujah glory to god that's right we're children but we can't get nowhere we can't whip the philistines so there's a reason we read this but these two quotes together brother ben tells us he says you're first born into the kingdom by the holy ghost and then in the next quote he says we're born in the spirit of god sure received the holy ghost crying abba father but we're children but we can't get nowhere amen and the reason i say this is because sometimes i've heard people teach in the past that that that you know you have salvation but adoption is the baptism in the holy ghost but brother branham tells us you're born again by the baptist holy ghost and when you go there he said the pentecostals think then i've arrived he said you haven't arrived you've just begun you're a newborn babe in jesus christ now you've got to grow up so that's the way i understand and not to contradict anybody else's understanding but just the way i understand what brother ben is saying if we take that that you become saved amen some you become saved down here at the beginning but at some point when you come to adoption you receive the baptism hold it goes and then it contradicts everything else he says everywhere else it makes it very very confusing and brother ben can make it sound that way when he's teaching adoption sometimes because you grow up amen you add to this and you grow up into the head but but he's clear in this one thing that the baptism of the holy ghost is the new birth the new birth is the baptism of the holy ghost it's the seed coming to life it's not the end of the journey it's a newborn babe in christ jesus and that newborn babe hasn't hit the end of its journey it just got to the ladder you just showed up by the baptist holy ghost you just showed up to the ladder now you got to climb the ladder now there's a there's a thing there's something god wants to accomplish in your life and it was not just to give you the new birth amen the new birth was to wake up or energize or activate that seed that life that attribute that now has to go on display so it wasn't just the activation of the seed that god wanted it was the display of the attribute that he's after but to display the attribute he's got to activate the seed then he's got to grow up and mature the believer amen to be able to handle the position that god has ordained for that believer to be in so that he can have the expression that he wants in this vessel in this day so we have to understand amen what god's trying to accomplish in our lives if we don't understand what he's trying to accomplish in our lives then then we'll go back to being a pentecostal amen that the experience at the altar or the experience in my room or that experience at any time that was the finish line that was the ultimate that was the end of it all that was the thing that i was seeking and once once i found that i've really arrived and that's it that brother man said you just began amen you just began that experience amen that was that was the highlight of your life it should be it's the new birth experience it should be a personal experience to you but that just gets you started working in the works of a son with the tutor of the holy ghost to bring you unto adoption the placing of the sun where god begin to begin to put you in a position of responsibility and authority brother ma'am says further in adoption same message adoption part two ephraim don't want to stay one of them go over here we find that manassas just over here say oh my the lord's given me a good cornfield then here comes over here gad said well now now wait a minute said i'm supposed to raise oats but i'm going to get corn too hallelujah you ain't got nothing to do with corn get oats oats is your part to raise but i'm starting to separate out these positions in the body amen and he's using the type and the old testament from the exodus moving into the promised land and the holy ghost began to positionally place them by tribes in the positional placing by tribes amen determined by a prophecy that was laid down years before when these boys received their when when they received their names and then when they received their blessing from their father on his deathbed it was placing them in the land with the work that they would do and so now joshua was there under inspiration only goes placing them in the land and where they're placed with their title and the blessing of jacob is determining what they're supposed to be doing in that land but he says now they say manassas got corn amen god's supposed to raise oats but god wants to forget raising oats and raise corn because the corn looks better than the oats see oats is your part to raise you ain't supposed to hurt sheep when you're supposed to hurt cattle god wants to place the church but every one of them wants to do the same thing however you can't tell them a thing about it no no they still got that goatee nature but but but but brother branham said butt oh is that a goat or a sheep you're supposed to do this you're supposed to be here but but see you can't tell them that's right now isn't that true and you can't place the church when you get to that brother said you can't place the church because everybody wants to do the same thing they think there's only a few things the church to do and all those two things are filled there's nothing else for me to do that's not why did god call you why did he choose you before the foundation of the world why did he place an attribute within you why did he send the holy ghost to you why did he wake up to say what's the whole purpose if all the positions are full and there's nothing else for me to do then what are you doing here but if you believe you came from god and go to god there's a purpose there's a purpose for you breathing air there's a purpose for your new birth there's a purpose for you hearing the word there's a place there's a position there's a purpose we just got to make sure that we don't put our own interpretation that our own desire and mix it in with that first you have to believe i'm a child of god settle that and i'm born again filled with the holy ghost child of god you've got to settle that issue and know who you are and where you are and then let the tutor take control and then let god do with you whatever he wants to do with you let's let's turn to romans chapter 12 and read through this together romans chapter 12. i'm going to read verse 3. for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think man i like that scripture not to think more highly than the author thing but to think soberly according according as god had dealt to every man the measure of faith it wasn't you it was him we can't think more highly of ourselves we're not good believers and good christians and good sons of god because we decided to do anything amen we just surrendered to what he already decided we just yielded to what he already determined what was his good pleasure before the foundation of the world we have just surrendered to that we've just acknowledged that we've just given him first place and has surrendered in an obedience that's all we did we did not make anything happen we did not make ourselves anything and god did not choose us because of our good character he chose us because of his foreknowledge amen verse four for us as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another having them gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith or ministry let us wait on our ministry or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimilation this means without hypocrisy abort that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another see he's teaching us here that we don't all have the same gift we're not supposed to have the same gift that's why it's so tempting sometimes when we hear testimonies testimonies are a wonderful thing if we have the maturity to handle a testimony but in immaturity sometimes testimonies can be a detrimental thing to somebody's spiritual walk because when we keep giving a testimony of a certain way a certain way god works a certain way god did something through a believer then all of a sudden the picture can get painted that that's the only way that god works in this circumstance or or you know when when somebody will give a testimony when i received the holy ghost it was like fire tingling up and down my spine somebody else said i i ran all over the floor and spoke with tongues somebody else said i've broken the vision somebody else says i wept and wept and wept and passed out weeping but you realize if you could get if you could get everybody going online and give their testimonies you'd be all right amen but if you just keep hearing one testimony one testimony one way to receive the holy was one way that it worked amen all of a sudden everybody's starting to question whether or not i've had that experience or not and the evidence of the experience is not the actions within the experience or the emotional response amen the evidence of being able to receive the word for your day saying amen to every word amen amen it can come in a multitude of of different manifestations in that experience and different emotional outbreaks after you have that experience amen but the experience is you met jesus christ personally something inside you woke up and changed you forever permanently changed you and you receive every word so that's why we kee if we hammer one thing too long amen everybody starts to question i mean some experiences can be so subtle they don't have uh this fire up and down the spine they don't have this this experiences other people talk about but they absolutely know something in them changed completely what i was i'm not anymore and i can't explain it but something is totally different i believe with all my heart god and this message is everything to me and i believe every word of it amen where did that come from but because it doesn't match a certain a certain criteria people begin to doubt their new birth but i'm telling you there's millions of people that are maybe even billions yet that have expanded experience that fit a certain criteria but they've had no seed to wake up under that experience it was an experience an emotional experience on the spirit realm but there was no seed to activate and because of the criteria they feel security and a new birth that they've never had there was no real deep change there was no total change in the life and now there's no complete separation complete separation from unbelief there was no complete surrender and believing of the message so that's why we we can't judge ourselves among ourselves we judge ourselves according to the scripture and what brother brahm taught us in the message we we don't want to i mean we want to share our experiences i want to hear testimonies we've got to make sure our experience doesn't become the experience and our testimony doesn't become the only way read through the bible read through the god does it one way here and somebody completely different the next time so we want to make sure that we all have the freedom to be what god has called us to be and we all come to that security in christ where i don't have to do what you do or i don't have to have the gift that you have to be a child of god there's been too much replication in the message i haven't seen the message in christianity for 2000 years there's been too much of deciding what is best or what we should do or what god wants instead of just yielding and surrendering and be whatever god made you to be whatever god wants us to be whichever position he wants me to put me in and however he wants me amen if god looked after my great-great-grandparents and my grandparents brother bam said bread this one to this one you realize brother branham acted like he was a horse breeder like god was following pedigrees and he goes this one's got long legs and this one's got endurance and this one's got good wind i'm going to put these together because what i'm looking for i need these attributes to come together in the natural that's how people breed horses and breed goats and breed cattle for milk production and things like that it's like oh man she's got good capacity i mean there's a mammary system on that cow but the thing is she's got weak bone structures she breaks down too early i can't get five ten years of production out of her i this one's really strong bone amen i'm gonna put this i'm gonna put the bull that produced this one with this cow because i gotta get these attributes together that's how brother brahms describing your natural burst he bred this one to that one to get so much tin and so much copper and so much lead to get the chime with just that certain ting because there's part amen there's a music sheet that's written now there's a part for everybody to play in this great orchestra and brother bam said your part you may wait and wait and wait and wait and wait you're on the symbol and you've got one little ting to make on that chime but the masterpiece is not complete without the ting and so god bred this one to this one i love that only a prophet can say and god bred this and your parents just thought they fell in love and they didn't realize they were part of god's breeding program they had a natural attraction yes ordained by god they get this one with this one and this one with that one to get you just a certain way and we know that we picked up a lot of bad things in that breeding to this one to this one because it wasn't god's perfect will so that's why the tutor of the holy ghost begins to take the word and shave off some of that extra genetic material that came some of that temper that came and that selfishness that came through there and start shaving some of that off amen because there's a part that we got to play amen and as he's shaving down getting us to obey the word and surrender the word bringing us with maturity he's bringing us to that place that he had before the foundation of the world a certain work for us to do a certain portion to play a certain note to play and we got to trust god to play that note through us and you know sometimes the the uniqueness that we find sometimes in ourselves causes us so much contradiction within ourselves because there's some of us we just don't we're just not like anybody else amen because we're not just an exact match to anybody else somehow we feel like there's something wrong or i don't fit amen you fit exactly right if you look at an orchestra you've got 15 violins and five cellos and all kinds of trumpets and trombones but a lot of times you've got one guy sitting back here with a couple drums a symbol in the little chimes he's different than everybody else they're all sitting down they all have partners amen they play things together or maybe a little solo apart and then all the violins play together and the cellos and they mix together but this guy sits back there he watches everything and every once in a while goes boom boom boom everyone goes ting he hits the symbol he's odd but he's perfect he's different but he's exactly where he's supposed to be we have to quit judging ourselves among ourselves and just be what god called us to be get comfortable in our calling amen come to terms with the fact of whether or not we're born again child of god or not and if you come to terms with that and just say god i just want to surrender more and surrender more and surrender more so that you can use me any way you want to use me if you wanted me to be weird and that's what you were looking for then i'm your weirdo you know we got to come to terms with that and say god if you this is what you want you can have it all i don't want any of my own mind mixed in any of my own will any of my desire i just want you to take what you've made and i want you to get your glory out of it brother man says where am i at oh in the message as i was with moses so i will be with thee and when this great thing taken place when each one of these hebrew mothers and their travail and childbirth called out like reuben that placed him positionally in palestine exactly the way that mother said called his name i don't have it all wrote down here but but reuben meant sheepherder gad means cattle raiser ephraim meant cornraiser now by spiritual discernment joshua the new leader by the spiritual discernment placed each one where he belonged divided the land just exactly a very beautiful type today of what we need a joshua for today the trouble today when we are coming to our promised land god wanted to raise sheep like ephraim one wants to raise something like the other every man wants to do the same let god give one man a gift of healing every man wants the gift of healing ibrahim and gad and all of them wants to mix all up and come as one but we are divided in our positions all don't have the gift of wisdom all don't all don't prophesy all don't speak with tongues all are not prophets but god has set in the church some that prophesy some that speak with tongues we want to make them all speaking in tongues see how the confusion is then you can't get nowhere why the philistines would take them over in a little bit sure but when each man by a leader separated them by spiritual discernment and placed them into the body there they remained and became the cream of the earth god give a joshua god give us a back of joshua that'll hold that commission with the word see the holy ghost placed them in the land and they begin to take the land and drive out the inhabitants and they begin to farm the land and prosper and then david comes and begins to further set it in order and solomon comes to bring him to the great adoption age they become the cream of the earth but they had to be placed and they were placed they were positioned from birth because you were positioned from birth you were positioned from before your birth you come into this earth with a position your new birth amen burst you into a position amen and god is growing you into that position the brother bantam takes this and he starts talking about everybody wants to copy one another and they all want to do you know the more exciting parts are the parts that get used more often or whatever the trivial ideas of humanity are amen but he says see they can never overcome the philistines they could never drive out the philistines that way and he makes this comment in a couple places and he's showing the secret to taking all the land us positional placing see they can never come to the golden age of solomon's reign without proper positional placing in every joint supply to the effectual working of the body to the building up of the body in itself in love until everybody had their land until everybody worked their land till every officer was was overseeing till every levite was in position to the temple was in place the temple worship was in place the daily oblation was in place the songs were in place amen the worship was in place amen the corn and the oats and the barley and the sheep and the ox they were all supplied but they were not all supplied by one tribe the whole nation became joints that supply us until they were positionally placed and matured they may come to a maturity and come to a place to where every joint could supply and they could each hold their portion of land they could each produce what that land was capable of producing the rocky hilltops wasn't producing corn they were producing goats minerals right gold and silver but neither was the valley producing minerals ores and the different the different minerals each one was in their land drawing out of their land amen what they were drawing out of the land would benefit the entire nation so each one of us with our own portion of the word to live out amen under the holy ghost anointing when we're drawing out of that word we're living a certain person in that word that's designed for us to live there's things that only we can do the way we do them gifts of healing gifts of tongues gives an intercessory prayer gives a giving of exhortation of wisdom amen when we draw now to that word that land that we have amen positionally placed by the holy ghost when we draw it out it's not just for us amen ephraim didn't just grow corn for ephraim ethereum grew corn for the whole nation amen and so we're not just trying to find a place where we can get everything we can get out of this positional placing is about the benefit of the whole body not my benefit the benefit of the whole body because there's things that that i can't do that i need that brother for there are things that i cannot accomplish there's things that i have needs i have need i need you know i need somebody who can come and lead in worship and i can follow along but i can't lead it myself somebody who can play the instruments to create an atmosphere i can't do it myself amen there's things that we need each other for there's there's different knowledge in the word that we need different people specialize in different understandings of things there's different people who are encouragers people who have a gift of hospitality we've got to have one another and your gift is my benefit and i want my gift to be your benefit so that the philistines can be drove out and kept at bay because the only way that they could conquer the land is when every joint supplied and everybody was in position and brother benham draws this analogy several times back in adoption part one he says now who would doubt that that's what paul said that's paul scripture that paul wrote that's what they taught this church to church positionally before the foundation of the world when god and his labor pain remember when those hebrew mothers and their labor praying and then they called out reuben they called out god they called it evil and they were positionally placing them in the land now he takes that same type and he says before the foundation world when god in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you into his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or to be that he placed you positionally god before the foundation of the world when he was in his labor praise to bring you forth he was bringing you forth he said to be a housewife to be a farmer we really really when god was bringing forth the logos amen i was in that logos but there was an expression in that logos that was for the year 2020 and that expression was ordained to be a housewife to be a mother to be a father a man to be a a a farmer a housewife a whatever whatever whatever whatever put your title in there whatever you are amen god when the logos came forth when he was laboring to bring you forth you were part of that logos and in there there was a portion that was portioned out for this day with certain characteristics and certain attributes that could only be expressed in wife and father and housewife and mother and daddy and farmer and so you never want to say i'm just a housewife i'm just a farmer god in his labor pains when he's bringing forth the logos amen determined that that's the portion you would hold and that would be an expression of his very own nature and character and housewives don't ever say i'm just this again you're not just this i'm a i'm a god farmer you're not just a farmer you're a god farmer you're a jehovah farmer i'm not just a housewife i'm a god housewife because god wanted to be seen as a housewife in 2020. i'm a father i'm a daddy over children because god wanted to be expressed as a daddy in 2020 i'm not just a dad i'm not just a lay member i'm not just a sunday school teacher i'm not just a farmer i'm not just a general laborer no i'm a god laborer i'm a i'm a i'm a god this i'm a god teacher i'm a god whatever you are it's god wanting to express himself in you don't you dare belittle that but i'm a retiree you're a god retiree you realize it's god desiring to be expressed and wherever he places you god wants an expression there don't ever belittle it don't ever trivialize it god before the foundation of the world knew it he placed it he ordained it he called it he led your footsteps he got you to a certain place so that he can express through this place through this time through these attributes don't ever belittle that ever again and sometimes we belittle it because it's not important in our eyes but i'll tell you one thing when he's bringing forth the logos it was important to god and if it was important to my father it's important to me amen and if he decides to plug me up and move me over here and he moves me to obscurity into a place that's not seen recognized known or heard amen if that's what he wants that's what i want i want to be satisfied with my portion i would say god if that's what you want that's what i want brother bram says in the message influence he said you'll never take another man's place and another man can't take your place find where your place is and abide there he thought well bless god i'm a king he's talking about uzziah lord has been good to me i can do this i i've got this this is my ministry i come to find out that it is going on like that and tried to go over and step over what god was blessing him at if you're a good lay member be a good lay member if you're a good housewife if god has blessed you as a housewife and made you loyal and true sister you just continue to be that don't get thinking god called you to be a preacher or deacon or something else and you to you do the same man wherever god has blessed you there abide because that's where he has set you at you do just what he tells you to do and see where he blesses you do not ever ever ever think that i'm just doing this until the next thing comes because if you get that in your mind that next thing may never come because he wants to have an expression in every station in life when you're single when you're working when you're retired before you're married after you're married if you're married if you're not married he wants an expression in every attribute in every way he wants an expression that's what god is desiring if he's allowed it to happen the footsteps of the righteous are order of the lord brother brahma said nothing happens without a purpose everything's ticking right on time in the life of a believer so if god has positionally placed you where you're at if it's widow widower if it's single if it's mary if it's with children without children wherever god has placed you amen there shine the light as bright as you can shine it because that's what he wanted before the foundation of the world that doesn't mean it's the end of your journey that doesn't mean it's the only portion you'll ever express but that that's where you are now come to maturity where you are now amen and let god entrust you with that portion of an expression today praise god praise god the member said in adoption part one he said well now many of them little pretty face mothers sitting here some of them 60 or 70 years old would say well what have i done brother branham you've raised your children you've done what you were supposed to do maybe some old dads sitting here say well i've herod the fields i've done this i never preached but you did just what god sent for you to do there's a place for you what would you rather do have a list of accomplishments that were outside the will of god or have done something that was seemingly small insignificant without notice that didn't seem to impact a lot of life but was exactly what god wanted see most of our ideas are self-centered and come from satan most of our ideas about what's important what's not important what offices what jobs what works are important and not important works most of that comes from satan because that's satan's mind wisdom and beauty and grandeur and he thought he could have a greater kingdom than the kingdom of michael how can you have a greater kingdom than the kingdom of christ it was the greatest kingdom there could ever be that meant he thought it was insignificant it was small in some ways inferior he could have something superior and if we start thinking inferior and superior in the kingdom of god that comes from lucifer there is no big eye there's no little there's no big amen it's all attributes of god which one is more important than the other the housewife attribute the father attribute or the preacher attribute [Music] you understand when we start thinking like that that's the devil thinking but when we recognize this is all god how many trees of life you see if there's a tree of life blooming in every heart and there's a tree of life in every yard the bible's specific there's one tree of life and that tree of life has a gigantic root ball and puts forth stems and leaves and trees and fruit it may look like one individual tree of life but if you follow that route all the way back it goes back to one original life one original it may look like many but it's one it may look like many members i mean people scattered all over the planet but when god looks down he sees one body of jesus christ not many it's a toe it's a finger it's a fingernail it's an eyelash he looks down says that's jesus christ that is the body of jesus christ that is the temple of god tell me which stone you want to cast away or which is not significant in the temple of god amen see we gotta quit using carnal thinking that come through hybridization that comes from the serpent but we've got to see things the way god sees them i mean every time like i said every time we circle we go a little bit higher to have a clearer vision to recognize amen it's not insignificant it's not unimportant it's not going unnoticed but amen it doesn't matter if you're a single mother it doesn't matter if your husband won't serve god if your wife won't serve god if god's got you in that position then that's the expression he wants out of your life it doesn't mean that god's not going to save your spouse it's not going to mean that your situation is not going to change but today that's what god wants and god wants to be seen as jehovah amen that can endure that trial that can overcome that situation don't belittle it brother told sister media we said this sunday brother ben told sister mita are we talking about her ironing his shirts and packing his clothes and not saying one word he says and she wonders how she can serve god says you sisters you serve god as you serve your husbands and that wasn't just a trivial little pass off to give a little token to the sisters to keep them quiet and keep them in their place the prophet have gotten minutes see sister meter wasn't just a housewife she was the housewife she was the wife of the prophet she said she wasn't just called to some generic term she was a wife of a specific man who had a specific work and she was part of that work you realize you can say just a housewife oh yeah just a housewife you think sister mita was just a housewife you think she wasn't ordained to carry that burden she didn't think she wasn't ordained before the foundation of the world to be married to brother branham because he needed her and he couldn't do what he was going to do for god without her don't kid yourself she wasn't just a housewife she was an ordained housewife to a certain person with a certain ministry to be a support so that he could go farther so that he could do more i mean if he had gotten married to a pretty princess who needed all kinds of attention and all kinds of showering and all kinds of could he have ever done what he's supposed to do but god ordained this woman for this man she was more than just a housewife her reward will be great in heaven for being just a housewife because that's what god wanted her to do she wasn't just a mother she was a mother to the prophet's children specific children see we're not just i'm not just a father i'm a father to specific attributes that god brought forward and you have no idea what those attributes will be you have no idea where there's deacons preachers preachers wives you have no idea what god wants to do you're not just a mother you're not just a father you've been ordained to be a mother for these children and we believe that these children come from god are attributes of god being shaped and molded by the holy ghost leadership through you to shape and mold them to a position and a purpose that they have this is an eternal work amen there's no just mothers or just fathers amen we are ordained mothers ordained fathers ordained brothers ordained and ordained uncles ordained friends you think brother branham's friends were just friends or were they do you think charlie cox was not ordained before the foundation of the world to encourage and restore that brother when he was tired do you see what i'm saying friend brother brenham had a little oasis and can take in kentucky that he could get away to and squirrel and and he went there for rest and peace amen and charlie cox and his wife they created an atmosphere where brother branham can totally unwind and rest because he had to have that to keep going do you think charlie cox is not going to have a place in heaven amen for having a squirrel woods and knowing good places to hunt taking care of brother branham you think his wife isn't going to have a place for feeding them and caring for them keeping a home a place for brother ben to stay see if we could just get away from this whole idea if this one's more important than that one and this you think brother branham did that all by himself what about brother neville who would keep the church together and keep the church going while brother brennan went everywhere he couldn't have done it without a brother neville it wasn't he wasn't a one-man ministry he wasn't out there there was all kinds of supports all kinds of helps he had managers and he had church members who loved him and cared for him bought him a new suit every year amen and give his family turkeys amen and give and give jelly can jelly to give to him do you think that goes unnoticed by god that brother bam said you know the little sister she canned us some blackberry jam or jelly or whatever and set it on the porch and he goes that means so much you realize that that might have been the encouragement that that brother needed just to get out and preach that day you think that little old lady she probably that sister probably never knew that there was any real significance she just did it out of a loving heart she did it because she loved the brother and appreciate what he did and can him some blackberry jelly and didn't know brother bram said that means so much all those little tokens all those little things just go as god leads friends just let god use you the way he's wired you if god's made you amen and he put it in your heart to cook a meal for somebody and you just want to do it then do it and don't say well all i ever did the thing you did was the thing he wanted you to do don't trivialize it we've got to get beyond this humanistic understanding we've got to get to a deeper a much deeper understanding of positional place little mamas when you're at home rocking that baby and caring for it you have no idea what god's purpose for this life is you think john wesley's mom knew that she was raising a john and charles wesley you think she knew she was raising the church age messenger she didn't even know there were church-age messengers but god called her to bring forth charles and john wesley you think she doesn't have a reward for being a faithful mom you don't have to have a ministry you don't have to be on the radio don't have to be on the internet nobody needs to know your name but in his labor pains before the foundation when he was bringing you forth he knew what you would do and he bred your this one to this one and this one to this one to get you with that certain thing so you could do what he had in his mind before the foundation don't trivialize it don't marginalize it don't sweep it under a rug don't act like it's nothing if god calls you to do it if that's your position you stay there and be as faithful as you can be to that position if it's one thing do that one thing if you can be faithful to church be faithful to the word be a faithful friend be a faithful brother or sister in christ if that's all that god's given you then do it with all your heart give your whole self to it because that's where he wants you and that's what he's called you to do man i look around and i see things all the time i see this one doing this one for that and an encouraging note an encouraging word an encouraging text somebody taking meals and we really don't even realize what's happening but god is being expressed in it all and we can't trivialize it and say it's nothing don't say what you did for god was nothing if you did it for god it was something remember when i think it was was martin when martin was a little soldier amen and he ripped his little coat in half on a cold night and gave he could say well that really was nothing but to god it was something so much so that god would appear to him amen wrapped in that garment and say what you did to the least of these you've done and unto me as we yield what gifts and talent and abilities that we have and we yield it to the body for the benefit of the whole nation and then when we do what ephraim did and what manasses did and what reuben did when we do our little portion dig it out of the land and produce amen enough to have an overflow to go to somebody else when we do that amen it's not just for us it's for somebody else and when we do it for somebody else we're doing it for god when you do something for the body you do it for god it's god serving god it's my hand serving my body by feeding my face it's me serving me my hand my mouth my stomach my blood myself and when the body amen operates in the gifts and calling it's god serving god when you receive something from a brother sister in a way of their gift or something they give i mean you're receiving it from god when that brother or sister they give you something out of the word they just saw they give you a revelation that sparked something that was god gave that to you and when you give something back you give it back to god and these things matter when it comes to adoption amen it's more it's more than just when i come to adoption i'm going to have a ministry you have a ministry it may not be what some people label as a ministry but there's a ministry there to minister to who to god where is god all that god was he poured into christ okay so where's christ all that christ was he poured into the church how am i going to serve him by serving one another where i want god to speak to me speak to me speak to me he might just use his mouth which is part of his body which is on earth and it might be a brother or sister not a preacher it might be the one who lays in bed with you at night that may not have been your life that might have been god that may not have been your husband that might have been god amen we've got to wake up to the reality of who we are where we are not have slumbering eyes not be asleep to the reality amen not big important not important more important less important amen just say the body of god is essential amen and every member is essential to the operation of the body of christ remember i said every all down to the little tip of my finger i want it to stay right there i love it all i love the whole body not just ministering gifts or the gift of a pastor this is tea i love it all right i understand oh god bless you friends we're going to let you go let's all stand musicians need to come i'm going to read one more scripture when we stand out of the gospel of john 15. and i'll read it to you john 15 16. jesus says to disciples you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain before they ever had a chance to go do something he's just setting the record straight he said you know you're not going to go out there and do some great thing because you're a great person and you're not going to go out and do a bunch of works that you think is right he's letting him know right up front you didn't choose me i chose you i don't care what you thought i don't care peter that you thought it was a great thing that day you laid down your net and you followed after me you would have never laid down that net and followed me if i hadn't chose you before the foundation of the world you didn't do anything great you just responded to what you were to who you are you didn't earn anything by dropping the net you had it before you dropped the net you've not chosen me but i've chosen you and ordained you that you should bring forth fruit brother branham is proud not brother jesus is promising them promising them that you're going to be fruitful and that that fruit shall remain do you know what he just did to those disciples if they caught the revelation he just took all the pressure away he stripped all the pressure away he said before you even start before you try before you fail before you get it right before you get it wrong i chose you in ordain that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and your fruit will remain and i want to say amen according to the scriptures and according to the message that you didn't choose god god chose you and he's ordained you to bring forth fruit and your fruit will remain not because you got it right or got it wrong or you're doing a good job you're doing a bad job but because he ordained it to be so he's not looking for us to put forth the great effort or get wise or figure something out all he's looking for us to do is yield surrender deny ourselves get to take the leadership of the tudor the holy ghost and obey the father's instructions on all things and he will do what he's ordained to do he's not looking for your work he's looking for your surrender he's already ordained the works he's already ordained the fruit he's not looking for your fruitfulness he's looking for your surrender so he can bring forth the fruitfulness that he's promised what did he just do for us he took all the pressure away don't feel any pressure friends the only pressure you got is to wrestle with this guy here and bring it subject to the leadership of the holy ghost that's all you got to worry about you're not going to worry about should i do this should i do you just take this guy and you crucify this flesh every day you just you just keep under your body beat it black and blue like paul said you just be diligent you'd be you'd be diligent to keep this guy surrendered to the holy ghost and god has already ordained what we're gonna do praise god let's sing got a song [Music] brothers i will go you have called me and i will answer [Music] i will answer [Music] amen we're gonna bow our heads and pray i just want to say don't don't put off obedience don't put off surrender don't get in your mind if god would ever call me to preach i'd have to give this up if that thought ever crossed your mind then you're no position that means give it up now whether he calls you to preach or not if i was a deacon we couldn't do this as a family wrong thinking we're at the totally we're on the wrong end of the spectrum we like to live a surrendered life today not because of my title not because i'm a pastor or because i'm a preacher i'm a deacon i'm a trusted church i have to alter my lifestyle if that's the way they're thinking then you're not fit to be a deacon or a trustee or a preacher because we serve god first as children of god and then god has ordained a place for us to be but that place does not change our obedience as a child of god today is the day to fully surrender right now is the moment to lay it all down quit looking around if i'm this or if i'm that i'll change this or i'll be this or i'm preparing for that you just lay your life down and surrender it all and obey everything the holy ghost is leading [Music] fully surrender and let god do whatever god wants to do let god let god unfold his eternal plan in our lives but let us surrender now let us commit ourselves to god afresh and say god i give you everything right now if if if there's nothing ever happens further than what's happened now i surrender absolutely everything to you if you want me to be no more than a good lay member amen i want to be the best lay member that's ever been on the face of the earth i want to surrender all let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus god i just pray that you would take us lord and let that tutor of the holy ghost lord just lord just teach us those lessons that we need to know god may we just surrender like we've never surrendered before may we follow lord wherever the holy ghost leads and the word may we follow it with a full heart a full heart to obey through every up and down every trial every success and failure give us a heart to obey lord it's by your spirit lord why will your spirit move in us and maybe surrender god i pray you would put us in that place that you ordained before the foundation of the world you've called us to be the final voice in the final age and god that voice will be in a mother and a father and a housewife and a carpenter an electrician lord and a preacher it'll be it'll be a mini-member body will have that voice lord and i pray that you'd put us in position may we each one be a joint that supplieth lord may we give our whole heart to whatever portion you've given us that we surrender lord may you use us to bless your bride to bless your body to do whatever portion that we can do whatever work we can do to be a blessing i pray you would do it lord while we just surrender ourselves afresh lord we just consecrate ourselves all over again to be a vessel that you can work through i say god forgive us for trivializing your work forgive us for marginalizing the portion you've given us or the calling with you called us with but god help us to be excited about our portion help us to be passionate about what you've called us to do in whatever occupation in whatever stage in life if it's parent or grandparent if it's friend or brother whatever you've called us to do let us be passionate about that lord let us give our whole heart to it oh i love you with all my heart i want you to have your way in me and have your way in this body of believers and may we function lord according to your purpose and according to your plan and may each one of us take our places that the philistines cannot overrun us so that we drive them out of the land that we fully possess this land and move into that golden age you've called us ah we praise your name we glorify your name lead us lord and we will follow we give ourselves afresh to you on a wednesday night we consecrate ourselves to you and ask you to have your way with us in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless your friends we love you appreciate each one of you and all that you
