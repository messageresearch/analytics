[23:00] amen we just want to say thank you to
[23:02] the specials they were wonderful God
[23:04] bless you for for sharing that with us
[23:07] also uh I introduced brother Tony and
[23:09] his family he's here with his wife Vicky
[23:11] and his two oldest children they have
[23:13] four but the two oldest are with them
[23:15] Sister Sarah and sister our brother
[23:16] Daniel and it's good to have you guys
[23:18] we've enjoyed some fellowship with them
[23:20] over the last few days and and I we've
[23:22] never met before and I didn't know
[23:23] brother Tony he just sent an email one
[23:25] day asking if we'd be here this weekend
[23:27] cuz they're Trav in the United States
[23:29] and they'd like to stop by and say hello
[23:31] and we said that'd be fine so they
[23:33] surprise us by coming in on Wednesday
[23:35] and at that point I didn't know brother
[23:37] Tony and I didn't really know anything
[23:38] about him but we had a chance to
[23:40] fellowship and the fellowship was just
[23:42] glorious it was just Heavenly places and
[23:44] I I learned that he had been a minister
[23:46] for quite some time and he began to
[23:48] share some things and and I found such a
[23:50] continuity such a joy and the things
[23:52] that he was looking at were really
[23:54] thrilling to me and I really had in my
[23:56] heart that I wanted the whole
[23:57] congregation to get get to hear these
[23:59] things and so I asked him if he'd take
[24:00] the service and you know I had to
[24:04] persuade this just a little bit amen but
[24:08] he was gracious and accepted and I'm
[24:09] really excited about the word this
[24:11] morning our brother lives in New Zealand
[24:13] with his family and and some of you may
[24:16] remember a big project that brother Tony
[24:18] worked on about nine years ago came out
[24:21] and it got passed around quite a quite a
[24:23] lot throughout the world and throughout
[24:24] the message and he did a a a timeline a
[24:28] power Point timeline animated timeline
[24:30] from Genesis to Revelation and took what
[24:32] brother bham said and had the quotes and
[24:34] the and the audio scriptures and the
[24:36] animation to take you uh in the Plan of
[24:39] Redemption from Genesis all the way
[24:41] through to Revelation and it was
[24:43] glorious it was well done and the
[24:45] brother worked on it and he's the one
[24:46] who produced that if some of you
[24:47] remember that and I remember watching it
[24:49] enjoying it amen but I never realized
[24:52] one day I would meet the man who works
[24:54] so hard on it that God used so we want
[24:56] to thank him for that if you'd like to
[24:58] look it up it's on YouTube it's called
[25:00] timeline then you have a dash from
[25:02] Genesis to Revelation timeline Dash from
[25:06] Genesis the Revelation and I know you'll
[25:08] be blessed I was very much blessed by
[25:10] him so we want brother Tony to come and
[25:12] relax his first time here so we want him
[25:15] to feel welcome immediately amen we want
[25:18] him to feel that kindred spirit because
[25:20] because we believe the same word we
[25:22] serve the same God Amen we want to pull
[25:25] on the word to make it easy for him and
[25:27] my goal is always that when a preacher
[25:28] comes to preach that I get my
[25:31] portion and that I pull so hard that he
[25:33] enjoys preaching amen so that's what we
[25:36] want to do again today so we just want
[25:38] to invite brother Tony with a song
[25:40] brother BL we'll open our
[25:46] eyes
[25:50] Lord we want to see Jesus
[25:59] [Music]
[26:00] to reach out and
[26:04] touch
[26:08] him and say that we
[26:14] love
[26:18] him open our
[26:23] ears Lord
[26:28] and help us to
[26:37] L open our
[26:41] eyes
[26:45] Lord we want to see one more
[26:52] time and open our eyes
[26:58] is
[27:01] Lord we want to see
[27:10] Jesus to reach out and
[27:15] touch
[27:19] him and say that we
[27:25] love him
[27:31] open our
[27:34] ears
[27:37] Lord and help us to
[27:47] L open our
[27:55] eyes we want to to see
[28:03] Jesus amen what a privilege amen that we
[28:06] can have that we can see him today we
[28:09] can see him in his word we can see him
[28:11] in one another amen we're a privileged
[28:13] people and uh I just want to bring
[28:16] greetings and I just want to say that we
[28:18] come into the CH church on Wednesday
[28:20] night and we could just feel the
[28:21] presence of God you know I text brother
[28:24] uh Chad and said look we're coming
[28:25] straight down from Detroit once we land
[28:27] and we're going to going to come
[28:28] straight to the church and we're about
[28:30] 15 minutes late but we walked in halfway
[28:32] through the song service and you can
[28:34] just feel the presence of the Lord was
[28:35] is like this feels like home you know so
[28:39] uh I believe you know brother Chad and I
[28:41] we've had some Great Fellowship together
[28:42] and we feel like we've known each other
[28:44] forever then he we both said well in
[28:47] some ways we have you know so that's
[28:49] really good so God bless you each one
[28:51] who may be seated for a few moments then
[28:53] we're going to stand again and read the
[28:54] scripture so certainly an honor and a
[28:56] privilege for us to be here and brother
[28:58] Chad said this morning that he was
[28:59] surprised that he wasn't preaching and I
[29:01] and I'm more surprised that he wasn't
[29:03] preaching you know so uh but anyhow here
[29:06] we are and I trust that there's
[29:08] something that we can say today that
[29:09] would be a help be a blessing I know
[29:12] that you're you're a mature Christians
[29:13] you know the message well I haven't got
[29:15] any new quotes we've got nothing new to
[29:17] say but perhaps we can say things from a
[29:20] a different perspective maybe than we've
[29:22] looked at it before and brother Chad and
[29:24] I were just talking before but uh when
[29:26] you're looking at an object if you
[29:28] if you can look at it from all different
[29:30] angles different perspectives you get a
[29:33] greater understanding of that a greater
[29:36] appreciation for what you're looking at
[29:37] and so that's what Fellowship is about
[29:39] you know we talk to one another and this
[29:41] is how what I'm seeing in the
[29:43] word that was the water that you
[29:45] promised
[29:48] good so so that's what we want to do if
[29:51] there's something that we can say this
[29:52] morning that would just give maybe
[29:54] another dimension to what you already
[29:56] know quotes you've already heard that's
[29:58] what we want to do and uh I was telling
[30:01] brother Chad you know we really
[30:02] appreciate his ministry and and I I
[30:04] think any Ministry should be a snapshot
[30:06] of the message you hear somebody
[30:08] preaching and if it sounds different if
[30:11] it has a different flavor than what the
[30:12] prophet said the alarm Bells should
[30:15] start to go off so we we don't want to
[30:17] be saying something different we want to
[30:19] just perhaps be brother renam says he
[30:21] looks forward to when the young men
[30:22] would break down the message to the
[30:24] people so that we can kind of see it in
[30:25] a little bit more detail but the overall
[30:28] that we want we want it to be a snapshot
[30:30] of what the prophet has said because we
[30:31] know that was the word of God direct
[30:33] from God speaking to us amen and we're
[30:36] so thankful for that we've enjoyed
[30:38] fellowship with uh a number of the
[30:39] Brethren we've had some really good
[30:41] homecooked uh meals from the sisters
[30:43] which we appreciate and uh so we're just
[30:46] looking forward to even this afternoon
[30:47] perhaps catching up with a few more of
[30:48] you folk and and we love you and the
[30:51] Lord uh we're going to have going to
[30:52] have 10,000 years plus a whole lot more
[30:55] when we get to the other side so uh
[30:57] we'll look forward to that as well so
[30:59] God bless you and we'll tune to the word
[31:00] in a moment I was speaking to one of the
[31:02] brothers I think uh we had some
[31:04] fellowship with brother gabes and we
[31:06] were talking over lots of different
[31:07] things and that was good and I enjoyed
[31:09] that uh sharing things was brother L was
[31:12] there and brother Josiah and some of the
[31:14] other brothers and sisters that was nice
[31:16] then with brother Steves the other night
[31:18] and uh brother Greg brother Ron
[31:20] different ones were there I think it was
[31:22] brother Greg I saying to you know
[31:23] brother Bren talks about being a
[31:25] Salesman for Life assurance eternal life
[31:29] assurance and I'm I'm very convinced
[31:32] about the
[31:33] product I'm not so happy with my sales
[31:37] pitch you know sometimes you you try and
[31:39] explain something it's just it doesn't
[31:41] quite come across how that you'd like to
[31:43] and sometimes even ministering it's like
[31:45] I don't think it quite got across but
[31:47] the product is perfect amen so if we can
[31:50] just concentrate on the product not the
[31:52] sales pit not the delivery but maybe
[31:55] there's something that we can just see a
[31:57] fresh that will give us a little bit of
[31:58] inspiration and uh and courage for the
[32:01] journey that's ahead of us I trust that
[32:03] can be the way that it would be amen and
[32:06] uh we were talking with brother uh
[32:08] Jeremy and brother Chad having some
[32:11] fellowship and uh they started using all
[32:13] the quotes that are in my notes and all
[32:15] the scriptures and I'm like we've got to
[32:17] stop Brothers we got to stop you know
[32:19] you're singing from my song sheet so we
[32:21] we just need to we just we'll talk about
[32:23] this tomorrow you know so as far as talk
[32:27] singing from the song sheet we were
[32:29] traveling around the US and somebody
[32:31] asked me we went to a church and they
[32:33] said oh do you or your family sing you
[32:35] know would like to do a special for us I
[32:37] said brother if I sing it'll clear the
[32:40] church faster than the fire alarm you
[32:42] know so we we don't want to do that you
[32:43] know but um maybe we can speak something
[32:46] on the word that that might be a
[32:47] blessing so if you'd like to stand with
[32:49] us again and we're going to read out of
[32:51] the book of uh
[32:53] Ecclesiastes and the message that I uh
[32:57] want to speak on or the title of it I've
[32:59] called it the purpose of time and I said
[33:01] to brother Chad you know when he asked
[33:02] me I said listen I don't really have uh
[33:05] a preaching message so much but it's a
[33:06] little study that I've done and I know
[33:08] that brother Brenham sometimes he will
[33:10] say and I'm not going to preach today
[33:11] we're going to have a Bible study and he
[33:13] preached some of the most dynamic
[33:15] messages that he preached you know so
[33:17] but it it is a study and I trust that
[33:18] you can see hopefully by the end of it
[33:21] we can see the purpose of of why we've
[33:23] been uh capsulated into this this Epoch
[33:27] of time because really we're creatures
[33:28] from eternity going to Eternity but
[33:31] we're passing through this period of
[33:33] time and it's for a purpose and trust
[33:35] that we can see that as we go through
[33:38] amen so Ecclesiastes chapter 3 uh 1-8
[33:41] and it's uh it's probably a very simple
[33:43] sort of a scripture we've read it maybe
[33:45] all the denominational churches would
[33:47] refer to this and possibly at times of
[33:49] funerals and things we talk about all
[33:51] these sort of things but we want to look
[33:52] a little deeper than that the Lord
[33:54] willing so here we go Ecclesiastes 3: 1
[33:57] says to everything there is a season and
[33:59] a time to every purpose under Heaven a
[34:01] time to be born and a time to die a time
[34:04] to plant a time to pluck up that which
[34:06] is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal
[34:08] a time to break down a time to build up
[34:11] a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time to
[34:14] mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast
[34:17] Away stones and a time to gather Stones
[34:20] together a time to embrace and a time to
[34:22] refrain from embracing a time to get and
[34:25] a time to lose a time to keep and a Time
[34:27] time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a
[34:30] time to seow a time to keep silence and
[34:33] a time to speak a time to love a time to
[34:36] hate a time of war and a time of Peace
[34:41] amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we
[34:43] come before you we just read some words
[34:45] out of the book lord the pages of your
[34:48] book The Bible Lord I just ask that you
[34:51] would open the pages to us now help us
[34:53] see Lord that you have a purpose you you
[34:56] have a plan you're working out in each
[34:58] of Our Lives you're developing something
[35:00] in us through our sojourn through time
[35:03] so I just ask now that you would be with
[35:05] us may your presence be with us anoint
[35:07] the speaker and the hearer alike we ask
[35:09] in jesus' name amen amen God bless you
[35:11] may be
[35:12] seated now we're going to start right at
[35:15] the beginning uh of the scripture and it
[35:17] says in the beginning God created the
[35:19] Heaven and the Earth and then brother BR
[35:22] says period or full stop and he says
[35:24] when he did it and how he did it he
[35:25] doesn't tell us that was way Way Way
[35:28] Back in the eons of time and he makes a
[35:30] great differentiation between Genesis 1
[35:32] 1 and Genesis 1:2 but we could say
[35:35] technically time had begun because we
[35:37] can say that when he made the original
[35:39] creation of the universe it was billions
[35:42] of years ago and science would say 13.8
[35:44] billion years ago that the that the they
[35:47] say the Big Bang happened and the
[35:49] creation
[35:50] began so it's a long long time ago but
[35:53] it's not our time it's just the time of
[35:56] the universe but when we get to Genesis
[35:59] 1:2 that's when we start to work on our
[36:02] time and that's when the clock starts
[36:03] ticking for us and in the C our current
[36:06] creation but in the intervening time God
[36:09] was not just sitting idle he was doing
[36:11] things in fact our bodies are made up of
[36:14] Stardust they're made up of stars that
[36:16] have blown themselves to bits and
[36:19] supernovas our sun the the the heaviest
[36:22] element that the sun will make when it
[36:24] combines two hydrogens together makes
[36:26] helium and then when it uses up all of
[36:28] the hydrogen and starts combining other
[36:30] atoms till eventually gets to iron but
[36:32] that's the heaviest element it makes but
[36:34] stars that are big enough that when they
[36:36] they collapse and then they blow
[36:37] themselves to bits it's called a
[36:38] supernova all the other elements that
[36:40] we're made up of were made in supernovas
[36:43] Maiden Stars big enough to Supernova and
[36:46] those particles are spread throughout
[36:47] the Universe and then they coales
[36:49] together to make rocky planets
[36:51] terrestrial planets like our Earth
[36:53] brother BR says God was like a great
[36:55] contractor that's right and he was
[36:57] getting all the elements together but
[36:59] that's how he made them in supernovas
[37:02] yeah so we are when it calls us the
[37:04] stars of God we are literally made of
[37:07] stars yeah that's where we come from so
[37:10] he was doing lots and lots of things he
[37:12] was he was making galaxies he was
[37:13] blowing stars to bits and uh you know I
[37:16] think maybe one day the Lord's going to
[37:18] let us have a you know a view back into
[37:20] what he was doing in some of those times
[37:21] we say oh there's a the the in in heaven
[37:25] you know there's a picture theater on
[37:26] tonight about the creation you know he's
[37:28] going to show us I don't know I think he
[37:30] want to show us all those things tell us
[37:32] what he was doing but right now because
[37:34] he didn't write those things they're
[37:36] just unknowns to us but if he wrote
[37:39] something in the scripture or if he
[37:41] spoke it by the prophets it became a
[37:43] Bible mystery and and the prophet tells
[37:46] us that the mysteries of God are going
[37:48] to be finished Revelation 10:7 so if he
[37:51] wrote it or if he spoke it he had to
[37:53] make it known but there's many many
[37:54] things brother M say that God did that
[37:56] he hasn't put in the Bible he doesn't
[37:58] have to tell us right now he's saving
[38:00] those things for his bride and he's
[38:01] going to say when I put that star there
[38:03] brother Chad I was thinking of you
[38:05] that's brother Chader this one over here
[38:08] see all those things it's it's a reality
[38:11] but he's saving it for later so he
[38:13] didn't write it he didn't say it and you
[38:15] we could say the seventh seal is like
[38:17] that you know when brother brandom says
[38:19] in in Matthew 24 he was talking about
[38:21] the seals and he goes through 1 2 3 4 5
[38:24] 6 he says nothing about the seventh
[38:25] that's right and then he go through
[38:27] Revel and he talks about the seals and
[38:28] there's a mystery with each one 1 2 3 4
[38:31] 5 6 the horse riders and then the souls
[38:33] and the souls and prison you know Souls
[38:36] under the altar sorry the to the Jews
[38:38] and then the tribulation the sixth SE
[38:40] seventh seal half your
[38:42] silence he says it's silent because he
[38:44] doesn't have to declare it now it's his
[38:46] secret it's everything to do with the
[38:47] coming of the Lord so if he didn't write
[38:49] it if he didn't speak it it just remains
[38:52] unknown it's his secret but what he did
[38:54] write and what he did speak he says I'll
[38:56] reveal it to you in the end time and
[38:58] that's right where we are right now amen
[39:00] so now we get to Genesis 1:2 and it says
[39:02] and the Earth was without form and void
[39:05] and darkness was upon the face of the
[39:06] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[39:09] the face of the waters and God said let
[39:11] there be light and there was light and
[39:13] now time starts ticking for our creation
[39:16] so he was creating things before the
[39:18] prophet tells us he had the fossils and
[39:20] all the different things that you see in
[39:22] the ground he was doing something before
[39:24] but but it eventually came to the time
[39:26] where the whole Earth was void of life
[39:29] and darkness upon the face of the deep
[39:31] he says now I'm going to start on the
[39:33] current creation and I'm going to
[39:35] replenish the Earth replenish means it
[39:37] had something here before and he
[39:40] replenished the Earth starts in our
[39:41] current
[39:42] creation so you can start the timer and
[39:46] he and he worked on creation for 6,000
[39:48] years brother Brenham says 6 days and
[39:52] we'll look at that in a moment so God
[39:54] had a purpose that He is wanting to
[39:56] fulfill so in this creation because he
[39:59] dwelt alone in eternity before but he's
[40:02] like but I'm going to make something and
[40:04] here we got a quote from brother Brandon
[40:06] M of Christ as the mystery of God
[40:07] revealed now he says now God's secret
[40:11] mystery he had before the world began
[40:13] now back in the back part of God's mind
[40:15] there was something that he was trying
[40:16] and was going to achieve and he had a
[40:19] motive in doing it in order to let
[40:21] himself be expressed uhhuh there we are
[40:24] straight away we we catch the key here's
[40:26] something he wants himself to be
[40:28] expressed amen because first there
[40:30] wasn't even a moon or Star atom molecule
[40:33] or anything he was God but he exactly
[40:35] wasn't God at that time because God is
[40:37] an object to worship and there wasn't
[40:38] nothing to worship him so in his great
[40:41] mind he wanted these attributes to be
[40:42] expressed and in him was love and in him
[40:45] was to be a father and in him was to be
[40:47] a son in him was to be a savior in him
[40:49] was to be a Healer all these great
[40:51] attributes that we see already expressed
[40:54] they were in God Amen attributes in them
[40:58] but nowhere to express them he had to
[41:01] create a platform he had to create a
[41:04] workspace where he could express his
[41:06] attributes amen and for that workspace
[41:09] he created time said that's where I'm
[41:12] going to express myself and brother B
[41:15] tells us about these uh on the screen
[41:17] there the threefold purpose of God he
[41:19] says first to express himself completely
[41:21] God in Christ second to have the
[41:23] preeminence in his church the bride and
[41:26] thirdly to restore the kingdom
[41:30] amen I'm glad we can see straight to the
[41:32] end of the story it's like he just gets
[41:34] right there to restore the kingdom I've
[41:36] read the back of the book and we win you
[41:38] know let's just go straight there we've
[41:41] got the whole book let's read the and he
[41:42] says yep the the uh the Saints get the
[41:45] kingdom that's good okay okay so this
[41:49] was this time element is actually this
[41:52] dimension of time is God's
[41:55] invention if you think of it like this
[41:57] go we can't think in Eternal terms we
[42:00] just can't we're a finite we can't think
[42:02] so God was he never had a beginning
[42:04] never had an end but you think about
[42:07] like this that God was eternal like that
[42:10] and he could had to try and think in
[42:12] finite terms it's just as hard for him
[42:15] to think in finite terms as it does for
[42:17] us to think in Eternal terms he had to
[42:20] think completely outside the box of
[42:22] everything of reality to him to come up
[42:24] with this brother Rems here who do you
[42:26] say this is he says
[42:27] in the beginning he was in the beginning
[42:29] by himself God dwelt Alone with his
[42:31] thoughts he'll never do that again cuz
[42:34] his thoughts are being made manifest and
[42:36] that's why we're right here this day we
[42:39] are the manifested thoughts of Jehovah
[42:42] God praise praise the Lord amen so
[42:46] firstly before he even created time he
[42:49] had to invent the concept of time he had
[42:51] to think I'm going to make something
[42:53] which is temporal in the midst of
[42:56] Eternity
[42:58] just a little
[42:59] box and it starts off eternity we're
[43:02] going to go into time and we're going to
[43:03] come out the other end back into
[43:05] eternity and there's a purpose in doing
[43:07] that so he invented it then he had to
[43:08] design how time is going to work and
[43:10] just initially we would probably think
[43:12] that's very very easy you know time is
[43:14] yesterday was gone today is now and
[43:17] tomorrow is Future and it sounds really
[43:20] easy that the Earth is 24,000 M around
[43:22] it spins at 1,000 M hours at the equator
[43:25] that's 24 hours and we get get into the
[43:27] next day but time is a whole lot more
[43:29] complex than that and we're going to
[43:30] have we look at that a little bit of
[43:31] science than that don't get too worried
[43:33] about that I did have one lady used to
[43:35] come to our church and she says I hate
[43:37] your science
[43:38] lessons oh okay I said well you know the
[43:42] great the greatest scientist of all was
[43:44] Jehovah
[43:45] God he made it all we only discover
[43:48] little minute parts of it you know but
[43:51] um yeah Jehovah God he had to think it
[43:53] all up invent it design it and then
[43:56] create it
[43:57] amen this temporary Dimension so we're
[44:00] we're blessed even that we can um we can
[44:03] get a little insight in these things and
[44:04] some of the greatest minds I think is
[44:06] Einstein you know uh he he was amazed
[44:09] that from from the perspective of Earth
[44:12] that we can see so much and we can
[44:14] discover so much of God's Universe
[44:16] because there's places in space where we
[44:19] could be you wouldn't be able to see
[44:20] anything out but we're in between the
[44:23] different spiral arms on our galaxy that
[44:26] we can actually see out other galaxies
[44:28] we can see around we can observe what
[44:31] God's been doing and what is God is
[44:32] doing if you've got the eyesight to see
[44:35] it all right one of the reasons God had
[44:38] to create this dimension of time is that
[44:41] to fulfill his purpose he needed an
[44:45] enemy he needed an
[44:47] enemy you could not be tried you could
[44:49] not be tested you could not have the the
[44:52] the the the testing times that it takes
[44:54] to develop in you the character that he
[44:56] wants without an enemy and neither could
[44:59] he so he had to he he realized I have to
[45:03] have an enemy but he couldn't have this
[45:05] enemy in
[45:06] eternity he said I've got to make a
[45:08] temporary Dimension where we battle with
[45:11] his
[45:12] enemy we can't have this enemy in
[45:14] eternity only in a temporary Dimension
[45:17] and eventually that temporary Dimension
[45:19] and the enemy are going to be gone
[45:21] that's right amen who is going to
[45:25] deceive Eve if there was no enemy
[45:28] who is going to nail Jesus to the Cross
[45:30] if there was no enemy right who is going
[45:32] to persecute the church down Through the
[45:34] Ages you know we read Hebrews 11 The
[45:37] Heroes of Faith we wouldn't even know
[45:39] them if there wasn't an enemy that
[45:40] fought against them now we say they The
[45:42] Heroes of Faith amen and the bride of
[45:45] Christ in this last a and the trials and
[45:47] the tribulations we go through the
[45:49] pressure we're feeling the enemy against
[45:51] us but the Bible says when the enemy
[45:53] comes in like a flood he's going to
[45:54] raise up a standard amen so it takes the
[45:57] pressure from that enemy to develop what
[45:59] the Lord's looking for in us so he knew
[46:01] that he had to have this Angel called
[46:04] Lucifer and he he made him beautiful but
[46:06] he also knew that he would get lifted up
[46:08] in Pride and when he got lifted up in
[46:11] Pride eventually it would play out he
[46:13] would become the enemy of his own
[46:16] Creator yeah because he got lifted up
[46:18] from Pride so God knew that would take
[46:20] place and then he knew that he had to
[46:22] bring that war not in heaven anymore but
[46:25] that war had to come down on Earth Earth
[46:27] that will be fought brother R says in
[46:28] the minds of humanity the human mind is
[46:32] where the battle is fought in the minds
[46:34] of men and women and boys and girls amen
[46:36] so not in eternity nothing could go
[46:38] wrong sin couldn't exist there in in
[46:42] heaven we
[46:43] we we're like I say we're from eternity
[46:46] go back to Eternity but it's here where
[46:48] we get tested in sin when we get across
[46:51] even in the Millennium when we get into
[46:53] into
[46:54] Glory it's not even going to be a
[46:56] possibility
[46:57] to sin it's only here and the real
[47:00] purpose of that is that it is we're
[47:02] talking about this just before the
[47:03] service it it's free moral agency that's
[47:06] that's the reason he purposed to place
[47:08] man in time on the basis of free moral
[47:10] agency to be able to choose right or
[47:13] wrong I give a little analogy if I had a
[47:15] bag of sweets here and uh they're all
[47:18] green I say you can choose whatever
[47:20] color you
[47:22] want but they're all
[47:25] green you don't have a choice
[47:27] but I've I had red ones and green ones
[47:29] and I say now you have a choice but
[47:31] don't choose the red ones cuz they taste
[47:33] terrible have the green
[47:35] ones now you still have a choice but I'm
[47:39] telling you the red ones are bad and the
[47:41] green ones are good now that's exactly
[47:43] what God did he opened the spectrum of
[47:46] choice but he says but don't choose evil
[47:48] choose good and live amen we see the
[47:51] scripture here in Isaiah 457 he says I
[47:55] form the light I I create Darkness I
[47:58] make peace I create
[48:00] evil I the Lord do all these things and
[48:04] in Deuteronomy 319 I call uh Heaven and
[48:07] Earth to record this day against you
[48:09] that I have set before you life and
[48:11] death blessing and cursing therefore
[48:13] choose
[48:15] life that both thou and thy seed may
[48:17] live he set the choice there but he says
[48:21] but don't choose evil he just opened the
[48:23] Spectrum he couldn't say you have a
[48:25] choice unless he did that but even we're
[48:28] talking also brother Chad just before
[48:30] the service now talking about the Rich
[48:31] Young Ruler you know when the Rich Young
[48:33] Ruler came to Jesus the Bible says Jesus
[48:36] loved him if if if he possibly could
[48:40] have given life eternal life to him he
[48:43] was the Rich Young Ruler was inquiring
[48:45] about eternal life and Jesus wanted to
[48:48] give it to him says he loved him what a
[48:51] thing we so we want Jesus to love us and
[48:54] he does love us but he can't take away
[48:57] free moral agency he couldn't make the
[48:59] Rich Young Ruler choose to to go the
[49:02] right way he had to open the Spectrum
[49:04] and say you choose and he chose the
[49:07] wrong way did the wrong thing
[49:11] H all right so after he had made this
[49:14] dimension of time God himself had to
[49:15] step into this Dimension that was the
[49:18] condescension he had to come and become
[49:20] a man come into this Dimension himself
[49:23] because he couldn't fulfill his purpose
[49:25] as the great Jehovah of God and here the
[49:27] next quote we got here from Christ The
[49:29] Mystery of God revealed he says he could
[49:31] not do it as that great Jehovah that
[49:33] covered all space time see he couldn't
[49:36] do it he had to become a man and he took
[49:40] kingship with man that was lost amen and
[49:42] became a man God made flesh
[49:46] amen let's take this off that's right he
[49:50] uh he made himself a body he came in
[49:53] human
[49:54] form he allowed himself to be subject to
[49:57] the same constraints of time as you and
[50:00] me the same constraints of being tried
[50:04] and tested of being ridiculed of being
[50:08] misunderstood of being hated that we go
[50:11] through just the same when he was 33
[50:14] they thought he was 50 you know that
[50:16] that sinless body didn't have to age but
[50:18] to be a kinsman redeemer he allowed it
[50:21] to age it wasn't under the curse but he
[50:23] allowed it to be under the curse so that
[50:25] it would age but time 33 they said
[50:27] you're not a man over 50 they thought he
[50:29] was already that age he could be tempted
[50:32] as a man and he
[50:34] was and yet without sin the Bible says
[50:37] but you know what the Bible also says
[50:39] God can't be tempted but Jesus was he
[50:42] was so much a man he was God but he
[50:45] became so much a man that he could be
[50:47] tempted he was tempted and yet without
[50:50] sin amen he could suffer as a man and he
[50:53] surely did and he could die as a man
[50:56] which he did did to redeem his lost
[50:57] bride but the incredible thing is that
[51:00] God in his Humanity was where he won the
[51:04] victory you think about this Jehovah God
[51:07] it was when he was in his weakness in
[51:10] his Humanity was where he won the
[51:12] victory amen it's just that's something
[51:15] to me you know he could conquer sin in
[51:18] that form Hebrews 59 says he became the
[51:22] author of Eternal salvation unto all
[51:24] them that obey him and God did that but
[51:27] as a man and you know he's got that
[51:29] confidence in you as his bride he says
[51:32] you're not actually from here you're not
[51:35] actually human and limited to humanity
[51:38] but while you're here he says you're
[51:40] going to win the victory I'm telling you
[51:43] I've read the back of the book that's
[51:44] what he says the bride is going to be
[51:46] victorious they're going to be there
[51:48] without spot without wrinkle he so how
[51:50] can that be he said so am mean that
[51:53] that's how we know we don't look at
[51:54] ourselves we don't look in the mirror
[51:56] we're going to be disappointed but he
[51:57] said so amen and that was the same thing
[52:00] that when Jesus was here he was relying
[52:02] on the word that said who who he was and
[52:06] and that he would be victorious amen
[52:09] also some other our fellowship you know
[52:11] just to probably put it into context
[52:14] when Jesus was born he was just born a
[52:16] baby he he just he didn't have any more
[52:18] understanding than any other baby he
[52:19] grew up as a little boy and he played
[52:22] games and different things and and so
[52:24] forth like any other little boy but by
[52:26] the time he was 12 he knew who he was he
[52:29] was he was disputing with the scribes
[52:31] and the elders and the church he knew
[52:33] who he was by the time he was 12 so
[52:35] somewhere between being a baby and being
[52:37] 12 the Revelation struck him and he
[52:40] looked out the window and went wow I
[52:44] created all
[52:48] this as a little boy he knew that it
[52:52] came to him wow that's actually who I am
[52:56] the
[52:57] Amnesia of humanity was drawn aside and
[53:01] he could see who he was and you know
[53:03] what he did once he knew who he was
[53:05] every time he talked to them he brought
[53:07] up in conversation something about who
[53:09] Christ was who Christ was and so we
[53:12] should be doing the same that we should
[53:14] be identifying who we are in him let the
[53:17] conversation come around to who he has
[53:20] made us we are his workmanship it should
[53:22] the conversation should be coming around
[53:24] to the fact that he's getting his bride
[53:27] ready for a catching away amen that
[53:30] should be on our minds as it was on his
[53:32] mind so he is the author of Eternal
[53:35] salvation something which is eternal was
[53:37] achieved through a dimension which is
[53:40] temporal something which is eternal was
[53:43] achieved through a dimension which is
[53:45] temporal amen all right so although God
[53:51] is he's outside of time he transcends
[53:55] time but yet he understand stands time
[53:57] he in he invented it created that he's
[53:59] the master of time he was before time
[54:01] he's after time he's both the beginning
[54:04] and ending of time amen he's not subject
[54:07] to it but yet he harnesses this time
[54:09] that we're working through to fulfill
[54:11] his purpose in US brother renam says
[54:14] here all the prophets came just exactly
[54:17] on time that was God's word living in
[54:20] each uh living on Earth exactly on
[54:24] time sometimes we see things in our life
[54:26] and say wow that was just the right
[54:29] time yes sir it's his time amen it
[54:33] surprises us but it doesn't surprise him
[54:36] he says Luther was right on time wisley
[54:38] was right on time Pentecost was right on
[54:39] time nothing out of order amen the
[54:42] prophet tells us that Israel is God's
[54:44] time piece and if you think about what's
[54:46] going on right over there right now I
[54:48] saw a news article that in Israel
[54:50] there's quite an uprising with within
[54:52] the uh the religious order because they
[54:55] say now that all this is happening the
[54:57] Messiah must be just about here must be
[55:00] just about
[55:01] here well yeah we know that's true
[55:05] because the bride has to be called away
[55:07] before Israel gets to hear and they're
[55:09] going to hear exactly the same message
[55:12] that we've received there is no other
[55:13] gospel this is it the the the seals have
[55:16] come off the book so you know to them
[55:18] the the the trumpets and the uh so forth
[55:21] have come to Israel they're going to see
[55:23] the same message that we see amen has
[55:26] clock's time just exactly I firstly the
[55:29] one about Israel he says uh if you want
[55:31] to see what day you're living look where
[55:32] the Jews are Jews are that's God's time
[55:35] pieces and out of proving his word he
[55:37] says the clock is timed just exactly to
[55:40] the split instant and everything's
[55:42] working just exactly right you know
[55:45] we've had many times in our lives where
[55:47] things have been like that I remember
[55:49] when Daniel that's sitting here now he's
[55:51] almost 30 years old but when he was just
[55:53] a little we guy he was standing on a
[55:55] balcony and I just at a friend's house
[55:57] and it was a two-story drop onto a
[55:59] concrete path if he'd gone over the edge
[56:01] and I just saw him he stood up on this
[56:03] balcony and I came over and I grabbed
[56:05] his
[56:06] arm like that and just as I grabbed it
[56:09] his feet had already gone off and he was
[56:11] going out through the rails it's like
[56:13] the T the Split Second timing I pulled
[56:16] him up through the rails set him down
[56:19] it's like thank you Lord he allowed me
[56:21] to see him just at the right moment just
[56:23] to catch him our little girl Julia where
[56:26] running in a as she we in a car pack and
[56:28] where's a big mall and she was only
[56:31] little and she took off running and I
[56:33] could hear this P pet p a p of feet
[56:35] rning she ran around a big vehicle ran a
[56:37] van and so I ran over and I put my arm
[56:39] out like that and she folded across my
[56:41] arm I couldn't see her coming I just
[56:44] could hear her and she folded across my
[56:45] arm and a car went swom past like that
[56:48] like thank you Lord it's like he's
[56:51] watching out you know he's watching out
[56:53] and he's doing that for us every moment
[56:55] of every day
[56:57] amen I just believe that all right so
[57:00] there's nothing wrong everything's going
[57:01] to turn out all right brother Ram says
[57:03] don't be scared God's Big Time piece is
[57:05] ticking right along and it'll be there
[57:08] it'll have a church without spot or
[57:11] wrinkle praise the Lord now many poets
[57:14] and and philosophers and so forth are
[57:15] written about time and some of them are
[57:17] quite interesting I quite like them
[57:19] there's a chap You' probably heard of
[57:21] Dale carnegi he wrote remember that
[57:23] today is the tomorrow that you're
[57:25] worried about yesterday
[57:26] I thought that was quite a good little
[57:27] saying you know today is the tomorrow
[57:30] that you're worried about yesterday and
[57:32] sometimes we we we overthink things you
[57:34] know ahead of time but um it can be like
[57:36] that but brother renam comes along and
[57:38] he says he actually said this is what
[57:40] time is so I'm going to read that to you
[57:42] it's out of the message Perfection he
[57:44] says now time time is this little Loop
[57:46] that Loops down speaking from eternity
[57:49] talks about eternity being a big loop
[57:51] and he says there's just a little Loop
[57:53] Twisted in the bottom of Eternity Jesus
[57:55] was from eternity to Eternity but he
[57:57] stepped down into the time spaces made
[58:00] flesh and came through here in order to
[58:02] sanctify or to put a streak of blood all
[58:06] across this place to redeem it and
[58:08] connect it back with God again for all
[58:11] eternity you see it he said that's all
[58:14] time
[58:15] is I like that that's you know everybody
[58:18] else got something to say and this is
[58:20] what are this and some of them are
[58:21] interesting but he said this is what
[58:22] time is
[58:24] redemption he was just coming com to
[58:26] redeem this Earth the people from the
[58:29] earth that are his people and then back
[58:31] to Eternity again there's the purpose
[58:35] amen sometimes you might have seen
[58:37] documentary sometime and they have uh
[58:39] maybe a a camera and it zoomed right in
[58:42] maybe on a Little Flower and you see the
[58:44] center of the flower and all the the int
[58:46] intricate details of it and then the
[58:48] camera starts to zoom back back back you
[58:51] see the whole flower then you see the
[58:52] garden and then you see the park that
[58:54] it's in and then you see the whole city
[58:56] and maybe the whole state and then you
[58:58] can see all of maybe United States and
[59:00] it zooms back see the whole world and
[59:02] keeps going back and you see the solar
[59:03] system and you see the Milky Way galaxy
[59:06] and we disappear into space and even our
[59:09] galaxy becomes a little Dot and you
[59:11] think that's the perspective of where we
[59:13] are and God's Great economy but when we
[59:16] talk about
[59:18] time here we are in time but actually
[59:21] it's just a blip in eternity right it's
[59:25] just a blip if you had it on a slidebar
[59:27] of time you'd be going eternity
[59:30] eternity Time Eternity eternity eternity
[59:34] and we're we're locked all we can see is
[59:36] this a little bit of time but it's just
[59:38] a blip and it's for a purpose to develop
[59:40] something in new amen so let's not get
[59:43] too excited about that not get too
[59:45] worried about that uh we talked
[59:46] somewhere about uh sand castles and I
[59:49] think brother Chad kind of like that
[59:50] little concept I talked about but you
[59:52] know everything that we do in this life
[59:54] is actually going to pass away you know
[59:56] we've I've built a couple of houses and
[59:58] and we're quite quite happy with the way
[1:00:00] they came out and quite nice houses but
[1:00:02] I said to the to the family
[1:00:04] remember this house is not our
[1:00:07] Castle it's it's one day it's going to
[1:00:10] be a puff of smoke it's just going to
[1:00:11] disappear just like that so we our goal
[1:00:15] has to be in glory amen everything here
[1:00:19] is going to sweep away and if you know
[1:00:20] anything about building sand castles I
[1:00:22] know you're a long way from the beach
[1:00:24] but uh uh you build them below the high
[1:00:27] tide line where the sand is wet and then
[1:00:30] it sticks together you can make and if
[1:00:32] if you're building a sand castle with
[1:00:34] the children and you can get really into
[1:00:36] it you know really enthused and you make
[1:00:38] it look as nice as you possibly can but
[1:00:40] in the back of your mind always you know
[1:00:42] one thing the tide is going to come in
[1:00:46] and it's going to take it
[1:00:47] away You're Building below the high tide
[1:00:50] line it the tide is going to come in
[1:00:52] take it away now the Lord is not against
[1:00:54] us building sand castles
[1:00:56] as long as we remember our sand castles
[1:00:59] that's right if you start using some
[1:01:01] cement on your sand
[1:01:03] castle you're going to be disappointed
[1:01:06] the tide of time is going to take it
[1:01:07] away and he's going to let the tide come
[1:01:09] in sooner because everything here is
[1:01:12] temporal it's designedly that way so
[1:01:15] that we can go to a place that is not
[1:01:17] temporal for eternity amen now in the
[1:01:22] scripture we know that brother brenon
[1:01:23] brings us out as well that the Thousand
[1:01:25] Years
[1:01:26] as far as God's concerned is counted
[1:01:28] there's one day 2 Peter 3:8 it says
[1:01:31] beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:01:33] thing that one day is with the Lord as a
[1:01:35] th years and a th000 years as one day
[1:01:37] and question answers the prophet said
[1:01:39] 1,000 years upon the Earth is only
[1:01:41] counted a time for a parable like to God
[1:01:45] as one day I just like the way he says
[1:01:46] that that's put it in there it's like a
[1:01:48] parable we like God knows what a
[1:01:50] thousand years is but as as far as he's
[1:01:52] concerned that's just one day two days
[1:01:56] it's it's it's no big deal you know and
[1:01:58] when he created the heavens and earth he
[1:02:00] did it brother says he took 6,000 years
[1:02:02] it didn't take him 6,000 years but he
[1:02:04] took 6,000 years but as far as he's
[1:02:06] concerned that was just 6 days just 6
[1:02:09] days and then the seventh day he rested
[1:02:11] that's just one
[1:02:13] week seven in the countdown he says
[1:02:16] seven is the number of God's Perfection
[1:02:19] six days he made the Heaven and Earth
[1:02:20] and the seventh he rested in 6,000 years
[1:02:23] the world is to labor against sin or the
[1:02:25] church CH labor against sin and the
[1:02:27] seventh is the Millennium the
[1:02:31] Sabbath yeah I heard a preacher
[1:02:33] denominational preacher doctor so and so
[1:02:36] and uh he was saying about the creation
[1:02:39] is 6 24-hour days okay I have to listen
[1:02:42] to this you know we have a more sure
[1:02:44] word of Prophecy but I wanted to hear
[1:02:46] what he had to say and he said uh so
[1:02:49] because it says the morning and the
[1:02:50] evening of the first day and the morning
[1:02:52] in the evening of the second day and
[1:02:54] even scoffield says in his notes all
[1:02:56] that means in the Bible and it uses it
[1:02:59] in other places it means that there was
[1:03:00] a definite beginning and a definite end
[1:03:02] and a definite beginning and a definite
[1:03:04] end to each phase when he made the
[1:03:06] animals and when he made the different
[1:03:07] things that he made they had a beginning
[1:03:09] of that part phase of creation and an
[1:03:11] ending and he moved on to the next the
[1:03:13] next next so um that's that was the
[1:03:17] morning and the evening so that was his
[1:03:18] first part of the argument and the next
[1:03:20] thing he says well the fossil records
[1:03:22] the fossil records prove that it all
[1:03:24] happened uh then because something had
[1:03:26] to die and nothing could die until the
[1:03:29] fall so that sounded all right too but
[1:03:32] it's not what the prophet
[1:03:34] said so brother renim tells us that
[1:03:36] there was a previous creation before our
[1:03:39] creation he calls it a previous
[1:03:40] civilization and there may have been
[1:03:42] many we don't know because that's in
[1:03:45] between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2 what
[1:03:47] he was doing we don't really know but we
[1:03:49] can see in the fossil record that there
[1:03:51] was many things there was dinosaurs all
[1:03:53] sorts of things were here we don't know
[1:03:55] about that but what we do know is that
[1:03:57] they all died that's right and brother
[1:04:01] Brenham tells us this and this is a
[1:04:02] little bit of if you like Tony Murray
[1:04:04] Theology and I'll just tell tell you
[1:04:06] that just right now but um brother bam
[1:04:09] does tell us though he says that God in
[1:04:11] his nature doesn't create something to
[1:04:14] destroy it it's not in his nature to do
[1:04:17] that he makes something that's why he
[1:04:19] gave freedom of choice but when the
[1:04:21] freedom of choice means that people
[1:04:23] corrupt something if it's corrupted it
[1:04:25] has to die maybe I tell you this too
[1:04:28] while I'm at it and I trying to remember
[1:04:29] to come back to that but uh most
[1:04:32] churches really the way that they teach
[1:04:34] the Garden of Eden they teach it as if
[1:04:37] they teach God as a narcissist they
[1:04:40] teach him that that he says here in the
[1:04:42] Garden of Eden you have all this fruit
[1:04:44] to his children you can eat whatever you
[1:04:46] like but if you touch the apples I'm
[1:04:48] going to kill you well no father would
[1:04:51] do
[1:04:52] that that's not how God is he said let
[1:04:56] every seed bring forth after its kind
[1:04:59] but if you hybrid it it will have to die
[1:05:02] it cannot live forever and the moment
[1:05:05] Humanity became hybrid it had to die so
[1:05:09] Satan somehow in the previous
[1:05:11] civilizations he was already Lucifer
[1:05:14] already dealing with God already I
[1:05:17] believe this is the B that I said is my
[1:05:20] my thinking on this already uh God was
[1:05:23] somehow training him that if he
[1:05:26] perverted something it had to come to an
[1:05:28] end it had to come to an end because and
[1:05:31] we find that the Earth had come to an
[1:05:33] end and everything was void of life and
[1:05:36] darkness upon the face of the deep when
[1:05:38] he started with our creation so the
[1:05:40] devil was here long before we were and
[1:05:42] something was going on and brother
[1:05:45] Brenham I think uh Rebecca asked brother
[1:05:48] Brenham Rebecca um brother R's daughter
[1:05:52] said she we learned in school that there
[1:05:54] are millions and millions of years
[1:05:56] this world is old and she said isn't
[1:05:58] that contradict contradictory to the
[1:06:01] Bible I said no sir I said it isn't it
[1:06:05] says in the beginning might have been
[1:06:07] hundreds of billions of trillions of
[1:06:08] years eons of time but God created the
[1:06:10] Heaven and the Earth period that settles
[1:06:12] it that was the first step and he makes
[1:06:13] no mistakes I just wanted to say some of
[1:06:15] those things so you know that that the
[1:06:17] prophet actually speaks that that it was
[1:06:19] just the heavens and the earth and the
[1:06:21] the creation happened so so long ago but
[1:06:24] when he talks about our creation
[1:06:26] that's what happened 6,000 years amen so
[1:06:29] in God's economy of time the whole
[1:06:32] process from when he began our creation
[1:06:35] until the end of time is six is 2 weeks
[1:06:41] it's 2 weeks I'll show you like this
[1:06:42] first week started in Genesis 1: 12 the
[1:06:45] creation six days of creation seventh
[1:06:47] day he rested that's one week and then
[1:06:49] we have from the time of Adam until Noah
[1:06:52] was was 2,000 years that's 2 days from
[1:06:54] Noah until Christ 2,000 years 2 days
[1:06:57] from Christ until the time of the
[1:06:59] Rapture 2,000 years 2 days that's 6 days
[1:07:03] and then the Millennium seventh day
[1:07:06] that's another one week so two weeks the
[1:07:08] whole program of
[1:07:11] God and we're
[1:07:14] home
[1:07:15] amen amen all right now I want to talk a
[1:07:19] little bit about science you all with us
[1:07:21] all happy okay um from the science point
[1:07:25] of view a little bit of a disclaimer to
[1:07:26] start with you know brother Brenham
[1:07:27] talks against Science Education and so
[1:07:31] forth and I want to just probably
[1:07:32] probably explain a little bit how that
[1:07:34] is because science has a couple of uh
[1:07:37] things that they they're trying to
[1:07:39] achieve one is that they're wanting to
[1:07:41] brother says they they're interfering in
[1:07:43] God's laboratory they're hybriding
[1:07:45] things they're C causing uh genetic
[1:07:48] modifications of things brother and says
[1:07:50] it's just bringing death he says science
[1:07:53] is bad um and the thing that they're
[1:07:56] trying to do they're obsessed with this
[1:07:57] thing to try and prove that everything
[1:08:00] that is came from natural processes
[1:08:03] without a a a Divine creator that that's
[1:08:06] science the the the obsessed with that
[1:08:09] to try and prove that everything came
[1:08:11] without a Creator they they cannot do it
[1:08:14] they know they cannot do it but yet
[1:08:16] that's still the story that they try and
[1:08:17] sell to the public with if you go deep
[1:08:20] enough into the science you can ask
[1:08:22] anybody and I've done this uh I've
[1:08:24] worked with people people that are that
[1:08:26] are biologists and and all sorts of
[1:08:28] things and and we've gone into it in in
[1:08:31] depth and they say uh in reality the big
[1:08:34] questions where life came from why we're
[1:08:38] here where we're going science can't
[1:08:40] answer of course it can't answer because
[1:08:44] the answer is God and the Rapture
[1:08:46] message brother B says he says how
[1:08:49] education and wisdom of this world has
[1:08:51] turned the church into a bunch of rag
[1:08:53] weeds the educational system science and
[1:08:56] civilization is of the devil amen so on
[1:09:00] that sense and that way that we just
[1:09:02] talked about that's true and Tim 1
[1:09:04] Timothy 6:20 says oh Timothy keep that
[1:09:06] which is committed to thy trust avoid
[1:09:08] profane and Vain babblings and
[1:09:10] oppositions of science falsely so-called
[1:09:13] in other
[1:09:14] words not true science because true
[1:09:18] science is just discovering what God has
[1:09:20] already made so we with our PE brains
[1:09:23] are trying to understand what what the
[1:09:26] the mind of Jehovah God has actually
[1:09:27] made and we can just only scratch the
[1:09:29] surface but we can still enjoy what we
[1:09:32] can see it's what God made we were
[1:09:35] somewhere the other way other day and
[1:09:37] there was a little little boy little
[1:09:38] toddler and he had a great big
[1:09:40] basketball for him it was pretty big
[1:09:42] compared to him and he would he would
[1:09:43] throw it and immediately would make him
[1:09:45] sit down and he go and pick it up again
[1:09:48] he throw it and I sit him down he he he
[1:09:51] was doing
[1:09:52] science that's what he's doing he was
[1:09:55] discovering Newton's third law to every
[1:09:57] action there's a reaction sit them down
[1:10:00] but we all do those things you know we
[1:10:03] you discover things that's that's why we
[1:10:04] don't don't get so badly hurt on
[1:10:06] different things because you realize
[1:10:07] there's an action and a reaction so
[1:10:10] that's on that basis that's what I want
[1:10:12] to look through brother brandham himself
[1:10:14] he he said he went to a lecture I don't
[1:10:16] think Einstein was actually there I
[1:10:18] think it was a recording but he says he
[1:10:20] went to a lecture of Einstein and he
[1:10:22] listened to what he had to say and he
[1:10:24] was he was intrigued by that because he
[1:10:26] said you know uh Einstein was telling
[1:10:28] him saying that if somebody went out at
[1:10:32] at almost the speed of light not quite
[1:10:34] but near the speed of light for 150
[1:10:36] million light years and then turned
[1:10:39] around they came back for 150 million
[1:10:41] light years when they came back they'd
[1:10:43] only be gone 50
[1:10:45] years oh that sounds strange but to
[1:10:50] everybody on the earth it would seem
[1:10:52] like they've gone 300 million years
[1:10:56] but to the person that was on the
[1:10:57] spacecraft it would seem like they've
[1:10:59] only been away 50 years so it would be
[1:11:02] possible to actually leave the Earth if
[1:11:05] you went fast enough on a spacecraft
[1:11:09] when you come back you could be younger
[1:11:11] than your
[1:11:11] [Laughter]
[1:11:15] son that's true it's not actually just a
[1:11:18] theory it's actually is true
[1:11:22] yeah so time itself the science calls it
[1:11:26] the fourth dimension and right through
[1:11:28] this place here where this church is
[1:11:29] people have walked through here people
[1:11:31] have planted crops through here people
[1:11:32] have probably built houses through here
[1:11:34] and we don't see any of them because
[1:11:36] that we're separated by the dimension of
[1:11:38] time they were right here but they're
[1:11:42] not here right now because it's a
[1:11:43] different time and that's the only thing
[1:11:45] that Dimension is separating us the
[1:11:47] three dimensions is not the problem it's
[1:11:49] the fourth dimension of time that is
[1:11:51] separating us from them in fact Einstein
[1:11:53] he said he made a little statement which
[1:11:54] was kind of humorous he said time is
[1:11:56] what stops everything happening all at
[1:11:59] once so we're kind of glad about
[1:12:02] that but time is not constant and that's
[1:12:05] what I was saying about this travel
[1:12:06] business time is not constant it's
[1:12:09] dependent on your speed and it's
[1:12:10] dependent on what they call the
[1:12:12] gravitational potential so how much
[1:12:14] gravity we're under it actually slows
[1:12:17] time or they call it it dilates time it
[1:12:20] makes a difference so when they send a
[1:12:22] satellite out maybe for the GPS it's
[1:12:25] sented out from the surface of the Earth
[1:12:26] and it has it's in a less gravitational
[1:12:28] effect but it's going faster and and the
[1:12:31] less gravity means that time on that
[1:12:33] satellite goes faster by so many NS but
[1:12:36] then then the fact that it's traveling
[1:12:38] faster time goes slower and then they've
[1:12:40] still got to correct because it's the uh
[1:12:43] the amount that is different from the
[1:12:44] face of the Earth they've got to correct
[1:12:45] it's something like 14 NCS they've got
[1:12:48] to change the time on the GPS satellite
[1:12:51] so that it works on Earth so that you
[1:12:52] could get to church if you didn't know
[1:12:54] how to get here cuz otherwise your GPS
[1:12:56] would lead you wrong and if it was 1
[1:12:58] second out your GPS would be 186,000 Mi
[1:13:02] wrong which is 7 and a half times around
[1:13:05] the earth so you you want those
[1:13:06] satellites to be right or you're not
[1:13:08] going to be here on
[1:13:10] time so that's just how it
[1:13:13] works all
[1:13:16] right yeah I've got that quote there
[1:13:18] about uh he was listening to a lecture
[1:13:20] from Einstein I'll just skip on here now
[1:13:23] we can't keep time very well uh
[1:13:26] ourselves because although we do have to
[1:13:28] have a body clock but if you were put
[1:13:30] say in a cave somewhere where there was
[1:13:32] no natural light our our Cadian Rhythm
[1:13:35] which is the Natural Body clock it
[1:13:37] clicks at about 25 hours in a day so by
[1:13:40] the time you done one month you would
[1:13:42] have lost a day so we're not very good
[1:13:45] at keeping time ourselves and there's a
[1:13:47] spiritual significance to that because a
[1:13:50] lot of people think I know where I'm at
[1:13:52] I I know but unless unless our body
[1:13:56] clock is aligned every day with the
[1:13:58] light from the
[1:14:00] sun within a month we're whole day out
[1:14:03] that's right unless spiritually we have
[1:14:06] something that aligns us regularly with
[1:14:09] the day in which we're living the Sun
[1:14:11] for our day we're going to get way out I
[1:14:15] know two churches one of them that think
[1:14:16] they're in the Millennium and one of
[1:14:18] them that doesn't think we're in the end
[1:14:20] time they more than a day
[1:14:24] out that's right so we need to know and
[1:14:27] back in the day when they the first
[1:14:28] sailing ships came out with navigation
[1:14:31] time was the thing that stopped them
[1:14:32] being able to navigate initially they
[1:14:35] had a sailing ship they could Sail Out
[1:14:36] out under the sea they could as long as
[1:14:39] they could see the coast they knew where
[1:14:40] they were but if they left the coast
[1:14:42] suddenly without time they didn't know
[1:14:45] where they were because you need time
[1:14:47] say the Greenwich Mean meantime or
[1:14:49] grenwich Meridian which travels through
[1:14:52] Greenwich right down the length of the
[1:14:54] Earth when you say the time at
[1:14:57] Greenwich when it's noon at Greenwich
[1:15:00] and then you're further around the earth
[1:15:01] and you say well now you see the sun's
[1:15:03] up here it's noon here well how long
[1:15:06] since it was noon at Greenwich and
[1:15:09] however far around you are if you're
[1:15:12] around there and you're 1 hour later
[1:15:15] than so your noon is 1 hour later than
[1:15:17] noon was at Greenwich you know that
[1:15:19] you're 15° west of Greenwich but they
[1:15:23] didn't have a Time so they didn't know
[1:15:25] where they were and eventually the
[1:15:28] clocks that came in they had pendulums
[1:15:30] there was no good on a
[1:15:31] ship and and then they came up with a a
[1:15:34] windup one that had a spring and
[1:15:37] suddenly they could navigate and brother
[1:15:39] R said even about all those things as
[1:15:41] far as being able to navigate around the
[1:15:42] world he says you know that's when they
[1:15:44] went out and colonized the world and
[1:15:46] everybody talks about oh how bad that
[1:15:48] was they colonized all these different
[1:15:49] places for brotherr and says yeah but
[1:15:51] God used that to spread the gospel he
[1:15:54] head to allow them to invent a clock so
[1:15:57] that they could navigate so they could
[1:15:59] cross the ocean so that they could
[1:16:00] spread the
[1:16:02] gospel everything is ticking right on
[1:16:04] time am me yeah exactly that's pretty
[1:16:07] good so in this last day now we've got
[1:16:11] atomic clocks and atomic clocks you know
[1:16:14] man's pretty clever but he's only
[1:16:16] discovering and he's only tapping into
[1:16:18] what God has already done there's a
[1:16:20] there's an atom an element it's called
[1:16:21] cesium 133 and the the between the
[1:16:25] nucleus of the atom and the electrons it
[1:16:28] vibrates continuously at at a constant
[1:16:31] rate and atomic clocks use that
[1:16:33] vibration and count how many times it
[1:16:35] vibrates per second and it's completely
[1:16:37] absolutely constant and just so that you
[1:16:40] if you want to do a little bit of
[1:16:41] counting it it vibrates every second at
[1:16:45] 9,192,631,770
[1:16:48] times a second and it counts that and it
[1:16:51] says 1 second and now we go on to the
[1:16:53] next and it's so accurate that it will
[1:16:55] only it'll be 1 second out after 300
[1:16:58] million years wow wow but we're just
[1:17:03] tapping into what God actually
[1:17:05] created yeah he's accurate amen praise
[1:17:09] the Lord all right the prophet tells us
[1:17:12] you know he talking about times and
[1:17:13] seasons and so forth tells us that we
[1:17:15] have the seasons because of the time of
[1:17:16] Noah that the Earth tipped over at the
[1:17:19] time of the flood so we know these
[1:17:20] things we just keep moving along amen
[1:17:25] uh in this the times and season Jesus
[1:17:27] speaks about it uh let's go to acts 1:6
[1:17:31] it says uh when they the disciples
[1:17:33] therefore come together they asked him
[1:17:34] saying Lord wil th at this time res
[1:17:37] restore again the Kingdom of Israel and
[1:17:39] he said unto them it is not for you to
[1:17:41] know the times and the seasons which the
[1:17:43] father put in his own power now a little
[1:17:46] later on we're going to find that to the
[1:17:47] scribes and Pharisees he say you should
[1:17:49] have known the signs of the times though
[1:17:51] but but to the disciples they saying are
[1:17:53] you going to restore the kingdom now and
[1:17:54] he says actually it's not for you to
[1:17:56] know the church ages right now that's
[1:17:59] what he telling them you don't know you
[1:18:00] don't know the times the season so it's
[1:18:03] because everybody down Through the Ages
[1:18:05] until it got to us thought they were in
[1:18:07] the last days all the Believers all of
[1:18:10] the Bride thought they're in the last
[1:18:12] days and technically they were because
[1:18:14] it's only two days they were in the last
[1:18:15] days but but as far as the coming of the
[1:18:19] Lord the catching of the Bride no one
[1:18:21] knew when that was going to be only this
[1:18:23] age like wow we're we're blessed you
[1:18:25] know but he really the prophet explains
[1:18:28] that he did that because it kept them
[1:18:30] kept them fervent if they said oh it's
[1:18:32] going to be like 1500 years till the
[1:18:35] Lord comes they might have not they
[1:18:38] might have been slack you know but we're
[1:18:40] thankful that he's made that known to us
[1:18:42] in this day and then to the the
[1:18:44] Pharisees he rebuked them because they
[1:18:45] couldn't discern the signs of the times
[1:18:47] the Pharisees also with the sedes came
[1:18:50] and tempting him decid that he would
[1:18:52] show them a sign from heaven what a
[1:18:55] silly thing to say he was a sign from
[1:18:58] heaven and he answered and said unto
[1:19:00] them when it is evening you say it'll be
[1:19:01] fair weather for the sky is red and in
[1:19:03] the morning it'll be foul weather today
[1:19:04] for the sky is red and lowering oh ye
[1:19:06] Hypocrites you can discern the face of
[1:19:08] the sky but you cannot discern the signs
[1:19:11] of the times a wicked and adulterous
[1:19:13] generation seeketh after a sign and
[1:19:15] there shall no sign be given it but the
[1:19:17] sign of the Prophet Jonas and he left
[1:19:19] them and departed and brother Bram says
[1:19:21] the sign of the Prophet Jonas was the
[1:19:23] sign of the Resurrection because as
[1:19:25] Jonas was 3 days in the belly of the
[1:19:27] whale so was Christ going to be 3 days
[1:19:29] in the heart of the earth and then he
[1:19:30] was going to raise up again but he said
[1:19:32] but that sign was actually going to be
[1:19:34] to the wicked and adulterous generation
[1:19:36] and the prophet said he was prophesying
[1:19:38] of today this is the wicked and
[1:19:41] adulterous generation you you can't
[1:19:43] imagine you can't look through history
[1:19:44] and find a more adulterous generation
[1:19:47] than we live in right now that is
[1:19:49] actually adultery is the normality of
[1:19:52] the of the rest of the world it
[1:19:53] absolutely that's just that is we have
[1:19:55] to accept that that is normal for other
[1:19:59] people but it's not normal in God's
[1:20:02] economy a wicked adult generation and in
[1:20:05] this age this is when the Lord himself
[1:20:09] has come down demonstrated that he is
[1:20:11] here the same type of ministry the same
[1:20:14] type of Miracles the same type of gift
[1:20:16] that he did before the Risen Lord has
[1:20:18] identified himself in this day through
[1:20:20] the message of the hour amen as far as
[1:20:23] time the Gentiles and slide here we've
[1:20:25] got as you'll have seen this before
[1:20:29] Daniel saw Nebuchadnezzar's dream and
[1:20:31] explained it to him the head of gold and
[1:20:33] the shoulders of silver and belly of
[1:20:35] brass and the legs of iron and clay and
[1:20:37] the feet of part or the legs of iron and
[1:20:39] the feet of part iron and Clay I've just
[1:20:42] put this up here to say nothing is out
[1:20:44] of cater the Lord told Daniel via
[1:20:48] nebuchad is's dream that there's going
[1:20:50] to be these kingdoms it has to play out
[1:20:52] this way just you rest you're going to
[1:20:54] go and sleep but at the all this is
[1:20:56] going to play out to the end time and
[1:20:59] here we are we've seen that played right
[1:21:00] out and we see brother REM says and
[1:21:03] these the feet of iron and Clay is Roman
[1:21:06] Catholicism and the protestantism that's
[1:21:09] throughout the world and is is gaining
[1:21:11] more power actually by the day and
[1:21:14] eventually we're going to be the target
[1:21:16] of that power that's just
[1:21:19] true okay now this might seem a little
[1:21:21] strange but here we are we're in in the
[1:21:23] dimension of time but as Christians were
[1:21:25] actually multi-dimensional beings we we
[1:21:28] think we have a we got a physical body
[1:21:30] but we know that actually the prophet
[1:21:32] tells us we have a
[1:21:42] theophonic realm somebody hears that
[1:21:45] audible sound waves they convert it they
[1:21:48] think about what you said they think
[1:21:49] about it in spirit
[1:21:51] realm and you know when you hear from
[1:21:54] the Lord brother says you're hearing
[1:21:55] from your theophany you're hearing from
[1:21:58] another dimension
[1:21:59] again amen the prophet says here and uh
[1:22:03] who this milisic you bypassed your
[1:22:05] theophany and became flesh man to be
[1:22:07] tempted by sin and then if this Earthly
[1:22:09] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[1:22:11] already waiting we have not yet the
[1:22:14] bodies and then lat a little later on he
[1:22:16] says then after you recognize the very
[1:22:18] word of God was Eagle food then you left
[1:22:21] the other thing you have been formed
[1:22:23] into the living image image of the
[1:22:25] Living God you heard from your theophany
[1:22:28] amen you have been formed into the
[1:22:32] image the living image of the Living God
[1:22:35] Amen wow am you heard from your
[1:22:38] theophany
[1:22:39] amen praise the
[1:22:42] Lord all right now just for a few
[1:22:45] minutes we're going to talk about times
[1:22:47] of
[1:22:48] trouble is that okay times of trouble
[1:22:53] and if you haven't had any you're not
[1:22:56] alive you're a
[1:22:58] zombie because the whole purpose of us
[1:23:01] being here is that we have some things
[1:23:03] to
[1:23:04] overcome and sometimes people say no one
[1:23:08] understands me you know what that's
[1:23:10] absolutely true you're you're right no
[1:23:12] one understands you because you don't
[1:23:15] understand yourself I don't understand
[1:23:18] myself who can understand the heart of a
[1:23:21] man see only God and he's your your
[1:23:25] trials are custom made just for you but
[1:23:28] I tell you what when you get like I'm
[1:23:30] I'm 58 now and I've had a lot of
[1:23:33] different trials along the way I did I
[1:23:35] had leukemia at one stage and I've had
[1:23:37] all sorts of different things go on in
[1:23:39] life but all of those things are now
[1:23:41] behind me and I really don't give it
[1:23:43] much thought because that that's a
[1:23:45] hurdle that we came over and everyone's
[1:23:48] got a story and say some of those
[1:23:50] hurdles were so big that we said there's
[1:23:53] just no way around this
[1:23:55] this this is
[1:23:56] insurmountable but they they're now all
[1:23:58] behind
[1:24:00] me and that's the Lord's faithful he
[1:24:03] says he's faithful he he allows trials
[1:24:06] to come but he's faithful he's with us
[1:24:07] he won't allow us to be tried above
[1:24:09] something that we can stand amen all
[1:24:12] righty so I'm going to look here just a
[1:24:13] little bit at Solomon and uh out of
[1:24:16] Ecclesiastes again and and the despair
[1:24:19] that he comes to and when he considers
[1:24:22] all that is in life in this human life
[1:24:24] and he if you read through Ecclesiastes
[1:24:26] he's like he says I've tried this I've
[1:24:29] done this I've built houses I've planted
[1:24:30] Vineyards and I've done this and he
[1:24:32] almost like as if I've done it for your
[1:24:34] sake I've tried everything for your sake
[1:24:35] and I found it's all vanity and vexation
[1:24:38] of spirits it's just a waste of time so
[1:24:41] let's just read this here I'm not going
[1:24:43] to leave you hanging with despair okay
[1:24:45] but I want to tell you that this is the
[1:24:46] the Viewpoint from natural man okay so
[1:24:50] Ecclesiastes 3:10 says I have seen the
[1:24:53] travail which God has given to the sons
[1:24:55] of men to be exercised in
[1:24:57] it and then in Ecclesiastes 2:15 he says
[1:25:01] and I said in my heart as it happeneth
[1:25:03] to a fool so happeneth even to me and
[1:25:06] why was I then more wise and I said in
[1:25:09] my heart that is also that ALS that this
[1:25:12] also is Vanity and there is no
[1:25:15] remembrance of the wise more than of the
[1:25:16] fo forever seeing that which is which
[1:25:19] now is in the days to come shall all be
[1:25:22] forgotten and how dieth the wise man as
[1:25:25] the fool therefore I hated life because
[1:25:29] the work that is wrought Under the Sun
[1:25:31] is Grievous unto me for all is Vanity
[1:25:33] and vexation of spirit yay I hated all
[1:25:36] my labor which I taken under the sun
[1:25:38] because I should leave it unto the man
[1:25:41] that shall be after me and who knoweth
[1:25:43] whether he will be shall be a wise man
[1:25:45] or a fool yet shall he have rule over
[1:25:48] all my labor wherein I have labored and
[1:25:50] wherein I have shown myself wise Under
[1:25:52] the Sun this also is Vanity therefore I
[1:25:55] went about to cause my heart to despair
[1:25:58] of all the labor which I took Under the
[1:26:01] Sun oh what a sad
[1:26:04] story oh he done many great things you
[1:26:08] know the porch of Solomon and all the
[1:26:10] different things and he built the house
[1:26:11] of the Lord and so wow what a great man
[1:26:15] it's all is Vanity vexation of spirits
[1:26:18] frustration to him job Sayes a man
[1:26:22] that's born a woman is a few days and
[1:26:24] full of
[1:26:25] trouble but job then he starts to start
[1:26:28] to see a purpose and he says in verse uh
[1:26:33] 5:1 17 behold happy is the man whom God
[1:26:37] correct therefore despise not thou the
[1:26:39] chastening of the almighty for he maketh
[1:26:41] sore and he bindeth up he wounde and his
[1:26:45] hands make whole he shall deliver thee
[1:26:48] in six troubles yay in seven and there
[1:26:50] shall no evil touch thee wow his his his
[1:26:53] eyes is starting to come open to these
[1:26:56] different things and then we jump into
[1:26:57] the New Testament and and they take take
[1:26:59] it to a completely new level James 1:2
[1:27:03] says my brethren counted all joy when
[1:27:05] you fall into diverse
[1:27:07] Temptations okay I just want to ask a
[1:27:09] question uh who does
[1:27:14] that when you fall in this is not uh
[1:27:18] even even great trials this is
[1:27:21] Temptations
[1:27:24] ever been
[1:27:25] tempted Jesus was tempted but the Bible
[1:27:28] says count it all joy when you fall into
[1:27:32] diverse
[1:27:33] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[1:27:36] of your faith worketh patience but let
[1:27:38] patience have a perfect work that you
[1:27:40] may be perfect and entire wanting
[1:27:42] nothing and if you lack wisdom let him
[1:27:45] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[1:27:46] God that giveth to all men liberally and
[1:27:48] abrath not and it shall be given him
[1:27:51] amen and then 1 Peter 1 wherefore you
[1:27:55] greatly Rejoice though now for a season
[1:27:57] if need be ye are in heaviness through
[1:27:59] manifold temptations that the trial of
[1:28:01] your faith being much more precious than
[1:28:04] of gold that perisheth though it be
[1:28:07] tried with fire may be found unto the
[1:28:09] praise and honor and Glory at the
[1:28:11] appearing of Jesus Christ amen the
[1:28:15] Paradox of it is that God can do more in
[1:28:17] your life through adversity than he can
[1:28:20] through
[1:28:21] Prosperity yeah it it seems seems like a
[1:28:25] painful Paradox but adversity is where
[1:28:28] he does great things in your
[1:28:30] life and often that often one of the
[1:28:33] hardest trials that we go through is we
[1:28:36] have to
[1:28:36] wait we have to wait why do we have to
[1:28:39] wait for this and wait for that and wait
[1:28:42] you know some days when you're kind of
[1:28:44] going through that you come up to the
[1:28:45] traffic lights they'll always turn red
[1:28:47] oh wait and you go in there and you go
[1:28:50] to the the store and then you get in the
[1:28:52] C I have to wait in the you and and the
[1:28:55] person that you sto behind they've got
[1:28:57] the biggest trolley you know it's like
[1:28:58] wait everything's waiting but the reason
[1:29:01] all that's happening is that we're in
[1:29:03] time for only a little time and the Lord
[1:29:07] has to make use of this time to create
[1:29:09] the character that's in you it's custom
[1:29:11] made amen adversity is more value to you
[1:29:15] than prosperity for our light AFF
[1:29:17] fiction Affliction this is 2 Corinthians
[1:29:19] 4:17 for our light Affliction which is
[1:29:22] but for a moment worketh for us a far
[1:29:24] more exceeding in Eternal weight of
[1:29:26] Glory remember like I was saying about
[1:29:29] the Lord Jesus how that he in this
[1:29:32] dimension in time he achieved something
[1:29:34] which is eternal Eternal salvation in
[1:29:37] Corinthians here it's saying the light
[1:29:38] Affliction which is but for a moment
[1:29:40] it's working something in time and in
[1:29:43] this finite Dimension which is a far
[1:29:45] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[1:29:47] Glory wow to me that that's profound
[1:29:51] that he can use something which is
[1:29:53] finite temporal and and even in our such
[1:29:57] limited capacity but he's making
[1:29:59] something which is of Eternal weight of
[1:30:02] glory amen and 1 Peter 4:12 beloved not
[1:30:05] think it not strange concerning the
[1:30:06] fiery trial which is to try you as
[1:30:09] though some strange thing happened unto
[1:30:10] you but rejoice in as much as you are
[1:30:12] partakers of Christ's sufferings that
[1:30:14] when his glory shall be revealed ye may
[1:30:17] be glad also with exceeding Joy amen if
[1:30:22] somebody who got the Olympics on at the
[1:30:23] moment and I don't take much uh stock on
[1:30:25] that myself but uh if you were going to
[1:30:27] be going to the Olympics as a
[1:30:30] weightlifter then the first time you
[1:30:32] lifted weights would not be at the
[1:30:38] Olympics you you said I'm going to save
[1:30:40] my energies for them no you would
[1:30:42] practice you would train you would but
[1:30:45] there's one thing about the training you
[1:30:47] would be careful not to overdo
[1:30:50] it I worked with a man and he was doing
[1:30:52] weights or something in a gy and he
[1:30:54] ripped the muscle off his
[1:30:56] arm and that took about a year to come
[1:30:58] right so he overdid it but you know the
[1:31:02] Lord is arranging this weightlifting
[1:31:04] he's arranging this training exercise
[1:31:07] and in 1 Corinthians 10:13 it says
[1:31:09] theath no temptation taken you but such
[1:31:11] is common to man but God is faithful who
[1:31:14] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[1:31:15] that you're able but will with the
[1:31:17] Temptation also make a way of Escape
[1:31:19] that you may be able to Bear it so the
[1:31:22] things that we go through he says
[1:31:24] I'm I'm limiting them to your ability
[1:31:27] when he gave out the talents remember he
[1:31:29] said he gave them according to your
[1:31:30] several ability when the man came say it
[1:31:33] was just too much for me he said no it
[1:31:34] wasn't I gave it according to your
[1:31:36] several ability amen and so I saw
[1:31:39] somebody had uh made this statement I
[1:31:42] quite liked it it says God gives his
[1:31:43] strongest battles to his strongest
[1:31:47] soldiers so when you think I'm going
[1:31:49] through such a hard battle no one else
[1:31:52] is going through it so he's just
[1:31:54] credited you as one of his strongest
[1:31:58] soldiers yeah and if you look and see
[1:32:00] what the Lord Jesus went through and if
[1:32:02] you look and see what all the prophets
[1:32:03] went through they went through the
[1:32:05] hardest battles the strongest soldiers
[1:32:08] got the hardest
[1:32:09] battles
[1:32:12] amen all right in the Masterpiece
[1:32:14] message if we've got that there he says
[1:32:17] speaking to his bride here he say she
[1:32:19] stands
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:21] alone uh she stands alone like the
[1:32:23] bridegroom rejected of man despised and
[1:32:26] rejected of the churches the bride
[1:32:28] stands that way what is it it's his
[1:32:32] Masterpiece he's making another
[1:32:35] Masterpiece I think I've got another
[1:32:36] quote on that at the moment and you know
[1:32:39] when when uh when job was
[1:32:42] here God actually set up that trial for
[1:32:44] job it was not it was not Satan that did
[1:32:47] that that was God that did that he's
[1:32:49] going Satan have you considered my
[1:32:51] servant job
[1:32:54] you
[1:32:55] know we be thinking the Lord should be
[1:32:57] protecting him keeping Satan away and
[1:33:01] that's what Satan said you are keeping
[1:33:02] me away he said no no no come and have a
[1:33:04] look there's no one like him in the land
[1:33:07] god starts bragging on job he he starts
[1:33:11] he starts needling the devil about job
[1:33:15] he's such a great man there's no one in
[1:33:17] the earth like him so Satan he says you
[1:33:20] can Satan says well I can't get to him
[1:33:21] God says you can but don't take his life
[1:33:24] but God sets it up this way because as
[1:33:26] job was a great man and God was
[1:33:28] impressed with job but God said I can
[1:33:30] make him
[1:33:32] greater I can make him twice what he
[1:33:35] is by by giving him a trial that he
[1:33:38] becomes an overcomer and job was twice
[1:33:41] the man that he was at the beginning and
[1:33:43] right now the Lord is bragging on his
[1:33:46] bride he is behind the scenes he and
[1:33:50] Satan are having a
[1:33:51] conversation he's bragging on
[1:33:54] you sometimes that causes our
[1:33:57] trials he's making something beautiful
[1:33:59] out of your life yeah that's true and I
[1:34:04] heard somebody say this too and I I can
[1:34:06] identify with it being true if you had a
[1:34:09] choice of all the different trials that
[1:34:12] that are
[1:34:15] available which ones would you pick
[1:34:18] would you pick brother so and so's
[1:34:19] trials brother sister so- and so's
[1:34:21] trials well you'd pick your own own
[1:34:25] trials so
[1:34:27] leukemia would you choose that well I'm
[1:34:29] on the other side of that
[1:34:31] now so he say praise the Lord I'm glad
[1:34:35] that I've been through that experience
[1:34:36] and he delivered me I'm glad to have
[1:34:39] that on my record he's the delivering
[1:34:41] God you know when I was I was lying in
[1:34:43] hospital and only certain simple
[1:34:46] scriptures could come to me I couldn't
[1:34:47] think too well are pumping me full of
[1:34:49] drugs and things but Romans 8:28 just
[1:34:52] stood out all things work together for
[1:34:54] the
[1:34:55] good all things and I thought that all
[1:34:58] things that means right
[1:34:59] now all things and I got myself up out
[1:35:03] of the bed I was there by myself in the
[1:35:05] isolated room for 7 weeks and I stood up
[1:35:09] I said Thank You Lord all things it
[1:35:12] means that right now this is for my good
[1:35:14] tears running down my face and the
[1:35:16] presence of the Lord just came down on
[1:35:17] the room and when my wife came back and
[1:35:19] I said I'm going to be well presence of
[1:35:22] the Lord's been here all things are
[1:35:24] working together for good he wants to
[1:35:25] hear his bride quoting his word amen
[1:35:29] that's just that's what it's all
[1:35:32] about
[1:35:33] amen everybody else you know walks away
[1:35:37] cuz I think part of the reason just
[1:35:39] maybe the final thing about trials that
[1:35:41] the trials that we go through sometimes
[1:35:43] they're filters because the elect is
[1:35:46] going to carry on regardless the elect
[1:35:49] cannot quit that's right like Peter to
[1:35:52] whom shall we go there the words of
[1:35:54] eternal life that this quitting is just
[1:35:56] not in the equation the bride is always
[1:35:58] going to go but others though 10,000
[1:36:01] fall at my side oh they've left the
[1:36:03] message oh they've left the message oh
[1:36:05] look it's I got blinkers
[1:36:07] on I know in whom I have believed amen
[1:36:12] praise the Lord and brother renam says
[1:36:14] here in this greatest battle ever fought
[1:36:15] I forgot that there these two armies
[1:36:17] when the enemy comes in like a flood as
[1:36:20] it's coming today what did God say he'd
[1:36:21] do the spirit of God would raise up a
[1:36:23] standed against it and the prophet said
[1:36:25] are you one of
[1:36:27] them when the enemy comes and are you
[1:36:29] one of those ones that God's going to
[1:36:31] raise up as a standard amen praise the
[1:36:33] Lord like Joshua as for me in my house
[1:36:36] we're going to serve the Lord I'm going
[1:36:38] to try and hurry here now but uh Esther
[1:36:41] if you remember the story of Esther and
[1:36:44] uh when Mori came to her and said you
[1:36:46] know there was trouble for the Jews she
[1:36:47] said he said maybe it's for this very
[1:36:50] purpose that you were raised up who
[1:36:52] knoweth where Thou Art come to the
[1:36:54] kingdom for such a time as this he says
[1:36:57] Deliverance is going to come to the Jews
[1:36:58] from somewhere but maybe you've actually
[1:37:00] been put in this place right now for
[1:37:03] such a time as this that you would make
[1:37:05] a stand and in the breach there brother
[1:37:07] R talks about I'm not going to read it
[1:37:09] to you but he talks about the seven
[1:37:10] horns that were on the lamb that was
[1:37:11] slain in in the Book of Revelation and
[1:37:14] he says that the horns were the Lamb's
[1:37:16] protection and he said it's a god group
[1:37:18] it's a Gods sent group of people that
[1:37:20] are th is the protection of the word we
[1:37:23] are the protection of the word in this
[1:37:26] day amen maybe you're just a bit quiet
[1:37:29] shall I read it to you so you know that
[1:37:30] I'm telling you the truth seven horns
[1:37:32] was the was the seven churches see the
[1:37:35] seven Church ages because that was the
[1:37:37] Lamb's protection what he protected his
[1:37:38] rights with on earth a God sent group of
[1:37:41] people that's protected amen see the
[1:37:44] horn on the lamb seven eyes eyes of the
[1:37:46] seven messengers of the seven Church
[1:37:48] ages seven eyes seven seers so there is
[1:37:52] a role for us to take we are the
[1:37:54] protection of this word in this day amen
[1:37:57] because somebody's going to live it when
[1:37:59] it comes Judgment Day people say nobody
[1:38:00] could live this message all all these
[1:38:02] people
[1:38:05] did and you know we're talking about
[1:38:07] Esther then talk about vashy vashy she
[1:38:09] she would have intended to go back to
[1:38:11] the king at some point because she was
[1:38:13] the queen but she wasn't going to go
[1:38:15] then she wasn't go going to go and he
[1:38:16] asked because she was having a girls
[1:38:18] party and she'll go in her own good time
[1:38:20] and a lot of people treat God like that
[1:38:22] it's just not going to walk it doesn't
[1:38:24] work God's not going to play sick and
[1:38:25] Fiddle to anyone when he calls we need
[1:38:27] to respond

[1:39:20] don't be uh just casual about the things
[1:39:23] of God he's calling but he won't be
[1:39:25] calling forever it's like we need to
[1:39:27] respond you know I gave my heart to the
[1:39:29] Lord when I was a 7 years old and I and
[1:39:31] I my testimony may be compared to a lot
[1:39:34] of other people come out all sorts of
[1:39:35] other things might not sound very great
[1:39:37] but it should be the greatest testimony
[1:39:39] we're kept by the power of God Amen
[1:39:41] that's what we want we want to be kept
[1:39:43] by the power of God it can keep you I
[1:39:45] gave my heart to the Lord when I was
[1:39:46] seven but all the way
[1:39:49] through as keeping power has been upon
[1:39:52] my life and I'm so thankful for that and
[1:39:55] some people you know have complained you
[1:39:57] know about all all the legality in the
[1:39:59] message and not allowed to do this and
[1:40:00] not allowed to do that for a while that
[1:40:03] that to me that was a school Master it
[1:40:05] stopped me from getting a worldly
[1:40:07] girlfriend it stopped me from going to
[1:40:08] parties it stopped me from getting into
[1:40:10] drink and to drugs and smoking it
[1:40:12] stopped me from all that you say because
[1:40:14] the prophet said don't so like we don't
[1:40:16] but there came a time a little later on
[1:40:18] where actually came into me it it was my
[1:40:21] own personal revelation yeah I was
[1:40:23] filled with the spirit of God say I
[1:40:25] don't want to do those things but I
[1:40:26] don't have to look back and say oh now I
[1:40:28] did all that see the school Master Paul
[1:40:31] say don't despise a school Master just
[1:40:33] don't stay
[1:40:34] there even for for children growing up
[1:40:37] in the house don't don't make mom and
[1:40:39] dad always be the school Master get the
[1:40:41] Revelation yourself get get your own
[1:40:43] relationship with God that you want to
[1:40:45] do what's right amen and then you'll be
[1:40:48] say oh I'm thankful for the school
[1:40:50] Master amen yeah so we want to respond
[1:40:54] to the word amen the prophet uh talks
[1:40:57] about Redeeming the time here uh firstly
[1:41:00] the scripture Ephesians 5:15 it says see
[1:41:03] then that you walk circumspectly which
[1:41:05] means carefully purposefully accurately
[1:41:07] not as fools but as wise Redeeming the
[1:41:09] time because the days are evil and out
[1:41:12] of his wonders to perform 958 the
[1:41:14] prophet says the reason we don't have
[1:41:16] the spiritual blessings we ought uh the
[1:41:19] reason we don't have the spiritual
[1:41:20] blessings we have too much time to watch
[1:41:22] television too much time to read the
[1:41:24] newspaper or listen to something that we
[1:41:26] ought not to be listening to but we are
[1:41:29] not Redeeming the time we're giving it
[1:41:31] to the things of the world instead of
[1:41:33] our time to the Lord Jesus and the Bible
[1:41:35] said man should not live by bread alone
[1:41:36] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:41:38] the mouth of God Christians live on the
[1:41:41] word
[1:41:43] amen all right in this uh day I was got
[1:41:48] a scripture here about the Watchmen that
[1:41:49] was that's the next one here but um I
[1:41:52] just want to jump ahead and say the
[1:41:54] Watchman for this age is the prophet of
[1:41:56] this age you know the the real word
[1:41:58] Watchman is where we get the word watch
[1:42:01] they can tell the time that was one
[1:42:03] thing that the Watchmen could do they
[1:42:04] would see if there's storms and see if
[1:42:06] there's troubles coming but they could
[1:42:07] tell the time Watchmen what of the night
[1:42:09] is it's such and such an hour he can
[1:42:11] tell the time the message that we have
[1:42:13] in this day we want to know the time
[1:42:14] this this message identifies the time
[1:42:16] that we're in and then you have a
[1:42:18] Watchman for the church we have a pastor
[1:42:19] for the church he's a Watchman over the
[1:42:21] church he's a Shepherd of the flock he
[1:42:23] says if you want to know whether
[1:42:24] something is appropriate for the time
[1:42:26] ask the Watchmen and then in each
[1:42:28] household if you have a Godly father
[1:42:30] he's a Watchman for that household it's
[1:42:33] designed need to know the time that
[1:42:34] we're living in and need to know of the
[1:42:36] dangers that are
[1:42:38] ahead
[1:42:40] okay just about finished here but I want
[1:42:43] to talk about the real purpose of it
[1:42:45] brother Brenham says the only thing that
[1:42:47] we take from here is character right
[1:42:51] that's the only thing that we take
[1:42:53] through time and out into eternity is
[1:42:58] character out of the SM Church age and I
[1:43:00] think we've got that uh slide there
[1:43:02] brother smon and church
[1:43:07] age that was
[1:43:15] uh oh yep that's it Okay the reason in
[1:43:19] uh the reason this is brother and say in
[1:43:21] Romans 8:17 18
[1:43:23] then of children then ears ears of God
[1:43:25] and Joint ears with Christ so if so be
[1:43:28] that we suffer with him that we may also
[1:43:30] be glorified together for I reckon that
[1:43:32] the sufferings of this present time are
[1:43:34] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:43:36] which shall be revealed in us and then
[1:43:38] he says unless we suffer with him we
[1:43:41] cannot reign with him you have to suffer
[1:43:43] to Reign I know you know these
[1:43:45] scriptures but just let's read this the
[1:43:47] reason for this is that character simply
[1:43:49] is never made without suffering
[1:43:51] character is a victory not a
[1:43:53] a man without character cannot Reign
[1:43:56] because power apart from character is
[1:43:57] satanic but Power with character is fit
[1:44:00] to rule and since he wants us to share
[1:44:02] even his throne on the same basis that
[1:44:04] he overcame and is sit down with his in
[1:44:06] his father's
[1:44:08] Throne then we have to overcome to sit
[1:44:10] with him and the little temporary
[1:44:12] sufferings we go through now is not
[1:44:14] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:44:16] Victory tremendous Glory that will be
[1:44:19] revealed in us when he comes oh the
[1:44:22] treasures that are laid up for those who
[1:44:24] are willing to enter into his kingdom
[1:44:26] through much
[1:44:28] tribulation
[1:44:30] amen amen and you know the prophet when
[1:44:32] he went beyond the curtain of
[1:44:34] time and he saw all the people that were
[1:44:37] over there and they said oh we're so
[1:44:40] thankful that you came we're so thankful
[1:44:42] that you came with the message because
[1:44:44] now that that entered in Beyond the Veil
[1:44:46] it was all
[1:44:47] worthwhile amen it was all worthwhile
[1:44:50] then all right
[1:44:56] I'm going to just skip on because I feel
[1:44:58] that we need uh let's go to the time is
[1:45:01] oh I haven't got a quote for this here
[1:45:02] but time is
[1:45:04] fleeting time we often if we look
[1:45:06] forward to something coming it seems to
[1:45:09] take so long but the moment that arrives
[1:45:12] it passes so quick right it's just gone
[1:45:17] and then it's forever is is history or
[1:45:19] our
[1:45:20] history so when when looking forward to
[1:45:23] something where it's like oh yeah it
[1:45:25] just seems to drag out drag out brother
[1:45:28] R says man's always praising God for
[1:45:30] what he has done and always looking
[1:45:32] forward to what he's going to do but
[1:45:34] failing to recognize what he's doing
[1:45:36] right now and I wanted to say that to
[1:45:38] say this that the now seems so
[1:45:43] insignificant now what's what is God
[1:45:46] doing in your life today it seems
[1:45:50] insignificant but it is making history
[1:45:53] it's going on your record and as far as
[1:45:56] saying even when say brother Chad when
[1:45:59] he's ministering the word you may say oh
[1:46:01] I've heard that before heard that before
[1:46:04] it's the now is the only bit that can do
[1:46:06] you any
[1:46:08] good because if it's still waiting for
[1:46:10] it or if it's now in history it can't do
[1:46:12] any good it's the moment of now is when
[1:46:15] we can be stared and we need to be aware
[1:46:17] of the now because yesterday and
[1:46:20] tomorrow are always going to be Out Of
[1:46:22] Reach it's only now that we get to make
[1:46:24] a decision it's only now that we get to
[1:46:26] make a change in our direction of where
[1:46:29] we're going we want to use the
[1:46:31] now for the purpose of God all right um
[1:46:36] job says uh in job 7 he says what do man
[1:46:39] that thou should us Magnify Him and th
[1:46:41] should us set thine heart upon him and
[1:46:43] th should us visit him every morning and
[1:46:45] try him every
[1:46:47] moment and the prophet said he says in
[1:46:50] the SM Church age he may commit you to
[1:46:52] suffering as he did job that's his
[1:46:53] prerogative It's he is Sovereign but
[1:46:56] it's all with a purpose if he did not
[1:46:57] have a purpose then he'd be the author
[1:46:59] of frustration and not the author of
[1:47:01] Peace his purpose is that after we've
[1:47:03] suffered a while that we will be made
[1:47:05] perfect be established strengthen
[1:47:06] settled as job said he put strength in
[1:47:11] US you see he himself suffered and
[1:47:15] learned obedience by the things that he
[1:47:16] suffered he was actually made perfect by
[1:47:19] the things that he suffered and just to
[1:47:21] wrap up like this
[1:47:23] firstly I said God needed an enemy he
[1:47:25] needs us to have the different trials
[1:47:27] and different things that we go through
[1:47:29] so that we can become Overcomers so that
[1:47:31] he can credit you with being an
[1:47:33] overcomer and he can say Well done
[1:47:35] because you cannot say if you had
[1:47:37] somebody working for you and they just
[1:47:39] sat on the chair all day and did nothing
[1:47:40] you would never say Well done but you
[1:47:42] may want to be saying well done to them
[1:47:44] but you're wanting them to do something
[1:47:45] well before you can say Well done and
[1:47:48] that's exactly what the way it is with
[1:47:49] God he's got all these different little
[1:47:51] hurdles that he allow allows in our
[1:47:53] lives and I've previously I preached a
[1:47:55] message artificial difficulties they
[1:47:57] artificial things that he puts there and
[1:48:00] you have to overcome them and he says
[1:48:02] well done well done because the natural
[1:48:05] consequences of living a Christian life
[1:48:07] would be love joy peace rest long so
[1:48:10] everything is going great for Christian
[1:48:12] that's the natural consequences of
[1:48:15] living a Christian Life and we know that
[1:48:17] because when we get to heaven that's why
[1:48:18] it's going to
[1:48:19] be so when you see a trial and and a
[1:48:22] trouble come along that's not a natural
[1:48:24] consequence that is that is ordained of
[1:48:27] God to it's it's a credit in
[1:48:30] Waiting he's like I'm going to give you
[1:48:33] credit for this one that's right but
[1:48:36] it's a
[1:48:37] hurdle so don't despise those things
[1:48:41] just commit it to the Lord ask him to
[1:48:42] help you and he says it's not going to
[1:48:44] be Beyond you it's just custom made amen
[1:48:48] and really in reality it's the
[1:48:50] unbelievers that we should feel sorry
[1:48:52] for should drive us to want to share
[1:48:54] this gospel because to the Believers to
[1:48:57] the elect everything that happens to you
[1:48:59] is for a purpose every little thing is
[1:49:02] for a purpose that's what Romans 8:28
[1:49:05] says all things all things are happening
[1:49:08] for good to them that love God the
[1:49:10] called according to his purpose so but
[1:49:12] to the unbelievers when they have an
[1:49:13] accident when they have a Calamity it
[1:49:16] truly is a Calamity that's right most of
[1:49:20] the world is stage support for the bride
[1:49:24] think about it Millions brother bam says
[1:49:26] are going to lose their
[1:49:29] lives in a nucle
[1:49:32] holocaust millions and millions are
[1:49:34] going to be counted as Canon fod for
[1:49:36] this atomic age he says but they have to
[1:49:39] be there you know what stage support is
[1:49:41] right if you have a drama and you have
[1:49:43] all the different things behind you the
[1:49:45] they got the trees and they've got this
[1:49:47] and all the even the different actors
[1:49:49] that are just like the secondary actors
[1:49:50] so that the main actor can come out on
[1:49:52] stage that you need the stage support
[1:49:55] the rest of the world is stage support
[1:49:58] right for the Bride of Jesus Christ to
[1:50:00] develop the character of Jesus Christ
[1:50:04] and then she can go home in the wedding
[1:50:08] supper go home in the Rapture to be with
[1:50:10] him forever more amen that's that's the
[1:50:12] whole purpose and plan of our time here
[1:50:16] in time and just in closing to bring a
[1:50:19] little
[1:50:20] balance I believe St John he John the
[1:50:24] Revelator he had this uh he had the
[1:50:26] spirit of Christ when he wrote this he
[1:50:28] said beloved I wish above all things
[1:50:31] that there mayest prosper and be in
[1:50:32] health 3D John 1:2 yeah beloved I wish
[1:50:36] above all things that there mayest
[1:50:37] prosper and be in health even as thy
[1:50:40] soul prospereth I believe that's the
[1:50:42] will of God he wants everything to go
[1:50:45] well for you he wants you to be aild
[1:50:47] your s castles he wants you to enjoy
[1:50:49] life he wants you to have joy he wants
[1:50:51] you to be
[1:50:53] happy enjoying the the the blessings of
[1:50:57] God but there are times when you have to
[1:51:00] go through something that's going to
[1:51:01] build this character Jeremiah 29:11 for
[1:51:05] I know the thoughts that I think towards
[1:51:07] you sayith the Lord thoughts of Peace
[1:51:09] not of evil to give you an expected end
[1:51:12] why we should take courage we should be
[1:51:14] thankful for that Jesus himself in
[1:51:16] Matthew 18:7 says woe unto the world the
[1:51:19] stage support because of offenses for it
[1:51:22] must needs be that offense has come but
[1:51:25] woe unto that man by whom the offense
[1:51:28] cometh
[1:51:30] amen and perhaps we don't have time
[1:51:32] really to go through this but
[1:51:34] Ecclesiastes the scripture we read at
[1:51:35] the beginning um we kind of think that
[1:51:38] you know that was uh Solomon talking
[1:51:40] about All the Troubles of man but if you
[1:51:41] read it through with the thought brother
[1:51:43] R says that uh the whole Bible is a
[1:51:46] revelation of Jesus Christ and Jesus
[1:51:49] Christ he has a bride so I'll just read
[1:51:51] the first few verses to you again to
[1:51:53] everything there is a season and a time
[1:51:55] to every purpose under Heaven a time to
[1:51:57] be born and he
[1:51:59] was a time to die and he did a time to
[1:52:03] be planted and he
[1:52:05] was John 12:24 says very very I say unto
[1:52:09] you except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:52:10] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[1:52:13] it die it bringeth forth much
[1:52:16] fruit a time to pluck up that's the
[1:52:19] Harvest Time A Time to Kill Satan's
[1:52:22] coming to an end a time to heal to heal
[1:52:26] his people a time to break down
[1:52:29] Revelation 18 it says with violence
[1:52:31] shall that great City Babylon be thrown
[1:52:33] down and shall be found no more at all a
[1:52:35] time to build up Ephesians 2:20 says and
[1:52:39] the Saints are built upon the foundation
[1:52:40] of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus
[1:52:42] Christ himself being the Chief
[1:52:43] Cornerstone sorry brother I haven't got
[1:52:45] these on here so I can see you searching
[1:52:47] for
[1:52:47] it a time to weep remember Jesus brother
[1:52:51] says the human emotion that Jesus
[1:52:53] expressed most was that he wept he wept
[1:52:57] often A Time To Laugh the prophet says
[1:52:59] when we get to the other side he said we
[1:53:01] can everyone sit under your own fig tree
[1:53:03] and laugh and rejoice forever in his
[1:53:05] presence when he comes back as king a
[1:53:08] time to mourn and a time to dance in the
[1:53:11] Psalms David says there has turned me
[1:53:13] from mourning into dancing a time to
[1:53:16] Cast Away Stones you know John 8:7 it
[1:53:19] says he that is with without sin among
[1:53:21] you let him come asked the first stone
[1:53:23] ader I think there was a lot of casting
[1:53:25] away of stones going on right then you
[1:53:27] [Laughter]
[1:53:29] know yeah time to gather Stones
[1:53:32] together David gathered some Stones
[1:53:35] together brother bam said it was faith
[1:53:37] in
[1:53:38] Jesus yeah wrought the victory
[1:53:42] amen all right I I'll read the rest of
[1:53:46] them we're almost done a time to embrace
[1:53:49] brother REM says if you receive him
[1:53:50] Embrace him love him and hold him in
[1:53:52] your heart and love him a time to
[1:53:54] refrain from embracing when any
[1:53:56] religious people Embrace both nism and
[1:53:59] bism and have the political financial
[1:54:01] and and physical power to back it up
[1:54:04] there's only one direction they can go
[1:54:05] that direction is right into Jezebel
[1:54:08] Doctrine that's a time to refrain from
[1:54:10] embracing a time to get Proverbs says
[1:54:13] get wisdom that's the principal thing
[1:54:15] and all I get and get understanding
[1:54:17] that's getting Revelation a time to lose
[1:54:20] whoever will lose his life for my sake
[1:54:23] shall find it a time to keep he that
[1:54:27] overcometh and keepeth my words to the
[1:54:29] end to him will I give power over the
[1:54:31] Nations
[1:54:32] amen a time to Cast Away brother
[1:54:35] brenham's praying and he says may the
[1:54:36] power of the devil be broken the Holy
[1:54:38] Spirit fall upon the audience and Cast
[1:54:40] Away the evil spirit of unbelief in the
[1:54:41] name of Jesus Christ a time to R and a
[1:54:44] time to sow I believe that's what the
[1:54:45] prophet did it was a rending of the
[1:54:47] false teachings but it was a sewing
[1:54:49] together of all the loose ends in this
[1:54:52] last day a time to keep silence remember
[1:54:54] Revelation 8:1 when it opened the
[1:54:56] seventh seal there was a silence half an
[1:54:58] hour and there's a time to speak that's
[1:55:01] when the spirit and the bride say come
[1:55:03] amen it's a time to speak a time of love
[1:55:07] this whole message is the love letter of
[1:55:09] Christ to his bride it's it's the coming
[1:55:12] of the son of man the marriage of Christ
[1:55:15] and his bride amen the Rapture to take
[1:55:18] her and him to the wedding supper of the
[1:55:21] Lamb the millennium the honeymoon
[1:55:23] brother Ram says and then their future
[1:55:25] home all together it's a love story this
[1:55:29] period in time is the love story when he
[1:55:32] Woos his bride he saves his bride
[1:55:37] he redemtion for his bride he makes the
[1:55:40] character in his bride that she can
[1:55:42] spend with him for eternity that's what
[1:55:45] he wants that's that's the whole purpose
[1:55:48] of it being here then it says a time to
[1:55:50] hate Revelation 2 6 says this thing they
[1:55:55] haest they hatest the Deeds of the L
[1:55:57] nians which I also hate a time of War
[1:56:01] that's going to be the Battle of Gog and
[1:56:03] Magog that's the last war and then a
[1:56:06] time of peace and that's the
[1:56:08] Millennium
[1:56:10] amen amen Christ is the mystery of God
[1:56:14] revealed in this last day but the bride
[1:56:17] is also is the the mystery of Christ
[1:56:21] revealed amen we see that that's what's
[1:56:23] taking place in this day in which we're
[1:56:25] living that he's actually wanting the
[1:56:27] very character that was developed in him
[1:56:29] to to be developed in her so that she
[1:56:32] becomes him
[1:56:35] amen Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:56:37] that's what it is brother R says here in
[1:56:39] the rising of the sun we are just
[1:56:41] closing folks he says uh as he being the
[1:56:44] groom the bride has to come forth cuz
[1:56:46] it's part of him if it does something
[1:56:48] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:56:50] bride because she is flesh of his flesh
[1:56:52] bone of his bone life of his life she is
[1:56:57] him amen amen amen and for out of the
[1:57:01] Masterpiece for nearly 2,000 years God
[1:57:03] has been making himself a masterpiece
[1:57:05] because he struck Adam to get a piece
[1:57:07] off of him a part of him a rib to make
[1:57:09] him a w a wife for him now that perfect
[1:57:11] Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he
[1:57:13] got a piece off of him it's just the New
[1:57:15] Testament that's all he fulfilled the
[1:57:17] Old Testament now it's the New Testament
[1:57:20] another piece to be fulfilled see the
[1:57:22] New Testament and the new and old is
[1:57:24] husband and wife am it's a glorious
[1:57:27] position but there's a process we got to
[1:57:29] go through to become like him amen and
[1:57:32] it taken the old to for fores show the
[1:57:35] new Christ come the Masterpiece to
[1:57:37] fulfill that now his bride will fulfill
[1:57:40] everything that's in the New Testament
[1:57:42] another Masterpiece is in making now the
[1:57:46] Masterpiece family has come again Christ
[1:57:48] and his bride ready to come the second
[1:57:50] Adam the second Eve ready now to return
[1:57:53] back to their home amen the whole
[1:57:56] picture has been Redemption from where
[1:57:59] it was bringing it back see just exactly
[1:58:02] bringing it back that's back to Eternity
[1:58:06] again amen and then he says soon time
[1:58:10] will fade into eternity we believe we're
[1:58:12] ending up this world's history and soon
[1:58:14] time will fade into eternity we want to
[1:58:17] be ready for that hour if there's
[1:58:19] anything that we can say that would
[1:58:20] encourage you be ready for that now amen
[1:58:23] he said soon time will be no more Time
[1:58:26] and Eternity will blend together when
[1:58:28] God and his people Blends together Ah
[1:58:33] that's what it's all about this time is
[1:58:35] just going to run out but it's going to
[1:58:37] run out when time when God and his
[1:58:39] people blend together then there's no
[1:58:41] more need for time and then we're back
[1:58:43] into eternity
[1:58:45] forever so This Time and Eternity will
[1:58:47] blend together when God and his people
[1:58:49] Blends together and we pray God that at
[1:58:51] this time at that time that will be
[1:58:53] numbered among those that will BL be
[1:58:55] blended into Christ that's called his
[1:58:57] bride amen the prophet tells us also
[1:59:01] here he says that when we get there on
[1:59:04] the other side we won't even remember
[1:59:06] the concept of getting
[1:59:08] old now to the young people that's not a
[1:59:10] big deal but for a lot of us that's a
[1:59:12] big deal but you won't even be able to
[1:59:14] understand what it is to get old prise
[1:59:17] God because you're thinking you need
[1:59:18] Turnal terms so of course we're young
[1:59:21] what what do you mean young you know
[1:59:23] we're just this is just the age we are
[1:59:26] see that's just how it will
[1:59:28] be I want to close here I trust that
[1:59:31] there's something there you you've got
[1:59:33] out of that but just to see that we are
[1:59:36] uh we're just a passing through it's
[1:59:37] like if you could draw it out as a box
[1:59:40] we come from eternity we've got to come
[1:59:42] through this experience the Bible says
[1:59:44] that even Jesus himself was perfected
[1:59:46] through the things that he suffered so
[1:59:48] how can God himself be perfected and the
[1:59:51] way that it is that in eternity he never
[1:59:54] did have anybody that was battling
[1:59:56] against him he did never had anybody
[1:59:59] that was belittling him imagine
[2:00:01] belittling Jehovah God that's somebody
[2:00:04] that was saying you know nothing you are
[2:00:08] nothing and he allowed himself he
[2:00:11] humbled himself till he yet you allowed
[2:00:13] them to nail him onto a
[2:00:15] cross that happened in
[2:00:18] time but actually he was winning the
[2:00:20] greatest victory that ever has been
[2:00:22] one and he says and my bride's going to
[2:00:25] come through the same process but I'm
[2:00:27] going to be with her I'm going to walk
[2:00:30] through the corridors of Glory with her
[2:00:32] this is my redeemed bride but this is my
[2:00:35] Victorious bride this is my overcoming
[2:00:37] bride and she and me we're one we're
[2:00:42] co-equal that's what it is the bride is
[2:00:45] co-equal with Christ in glory because
[2:00:48] she's been through the exactly the same
[2:00:50] process so don't despise the Journey
[2:00:54] Don't despise the trials they're working
[2:00:56] something in you which has an eternal
[2:00:58] weight of glory amen and I want to close
[2:01:01] with this prayer it's brother brenham's
[2:01:03] prayer maybe if you'd like to stand with
[2:01:04] us ask brother Chad if you'd come and
[2:01:06] it's out of the deep call us the
[2:01:08] Deep message brother and preach
[2:01:12] this and I I find it very moving when he
[2:01:15] when he prays this
[2:01:17] prayer but he says and when all of life
[2:01:20] is over here on Earth the last prayer
[2:01:23] has been prayed and the battles are all
[2:01:25] done the Smoke's dried up and gone away
[2:01:29] arms is stacked the Bible's
[2:01:33] closed and we come up to your
[2:01:37] house that great morning breaks Eternal
[2:01:40] bright and fear when the chosen ones are

[2:01:49] stretched out there for that suppe out
[2:01:51] thousands of miles long looking across
[2:01:53] the table at each other battle scarred
[2:01:55] vetrans tears of joy running down our
[2:01:57] cheeks the king comes out and his Beauty
[2:02:00] Holiness walk down along the the table
[2:02:04] and take his own hands and wipe the
[2:02:06] tears from her eyes saying don't cry no
[2:02:08] more it's all over enter into the joys
[2:02:12] of the Lord he said the toils of the

[2:05:56] Eternal purpose amen thank you brother
[2:05:59] God bless you it's encouraging to me
[2:06:03] it's the experience that we all have
[2:06:05] it's the life that we all live and it
[2:06:07] puts it all into a greater perspective
[2:06:10] it's not just drudgery it's not just one
[2:06:12] difficult circumstance to another it's
[2:06:15] molding and making a bride fit to rule
[2:06:18] and reign with
[2:06:20] Christ oh
[2:06:22] you know it's the things that have no
[2:06:24] purpose that are hard that are so
[2:06:26] daunting it's the things that make us
[2:06:28] hopeless and bring us to despair how
[2:06:31] many of felt hopeless in despair if you
[2:06:34] felt hopeless and despair it's because
[2:06:36] the thing you're coming through you
[2:06:38] couldn't see any purpose in it at all
[2:06:40] but if we knew the purpose it wouldn't
[2:06:42] be hopeless and it wouldn't be despair
[2:06:44] we would know it's orchestrated by God
[2:06:46] and he's got a great purpose in what
[2:06:48] we're going through amen I believe that
[2:06:51] the the Lord today has given us a Clear
[2:06:54] Vision to take away hopelessness and
[2:06:57] despair it all has a purpose there's
[2:07:00] hard things there's hard things in life

[2:07:13] purpose are you part of the
[2:07:16] called then all things all things even

[2:07:36] Vision and understanding so that we On
[2:07:38] Eagle's Wings could fly a little higher
[2:07:40] and take everything in perspective and
[2:07:42] he flew us high enough amen that we
[2:07:44] could see from eternity back into
[2:07:46] eternity and see this little blip
[2:07:48] brother brandom calls it a
[2:07:49] hickey the little called time that'll be
[2:07:53] absorbed back into eternity the Eagle's

[2:08:03] what an encouragement that is to us and
[2:08:05] like brother Brenham said when it's all
