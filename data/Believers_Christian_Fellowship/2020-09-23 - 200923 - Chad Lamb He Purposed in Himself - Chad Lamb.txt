========================================
make yourself ready with a sacrifice he's calling you to be [Music] separated you are his and his [Applause] completely set apart this world is [Applause] alone [Music] praise the lord amen god is certainly good amen it's good to be here with you this evening let's take our bibles over standing and turn to ephesians chapter one if you'll recognize we've been spending some time in ephesians chapter one uh for the last little bit and we're going to start there again this evening ephesians chapter one and we'll read from verse nine i also want to welcome back brother emmanuel sabasu he's back from god bless your brother back from northern idaho said they had good meetings there so thank you all for praying and then also remember brother ben seabolt will be traveling away this weekend and ministering down in arkansas so please keep him in prayer as well i mean let's uh let's read here in ephesians chapter 1 verse 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself and i want to focus on that purpose in himself he purposed in himself this is bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father for your goodness to us lord thank you for the privilege of being here lord to sing your praises to worship with our brothers and sisters and now to hear your word preached lord it's a privilege let us never take it for granted but each time lord let it not be a tradition or a habit but lord may it be lord i'm meeting with you lord may we look past the veil lord and pass all the physical and see you coming on the scene lord to break the bread of life and to feed your sheep may we eat from your hand lord and maybe gain strength for this journey speak to us now we pray lord and have preeminence in all things in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seats i'm going to stay in ephesians we're going to come back and read ephesians again but i just want to share a testimony with you um this past monday um i went over to visit um levi yoder again levi you you know is the amish man that we've been visiting for a little over a year now and um he came in contact with the message through ezra him and ezra within the were in the same facility he grabbed a hold of the message and he grabbed a hold of it with both hands and he come out we've been visiting him regularly since then well we went monday and it was really quite a blessing because brother ezra hadn't been able to go for a year he had been blocked and was not able to go but by the grace of god god removed that block supernaturally and he was able to go this time which levi was greatly blessed to see him but it was a very very special trip because levi and his whole family desired to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ on this trip so so we went over there with that purpose in mind and because we don't communicate uh it's not easy there's no cell phone only by mail we don't have time to send a letter and get one back in between visits so you never know for sure what you're gonna find when you get back there but they had to express the desire and the trip before to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and so we went with that purpose in mind brother ezra and i and brother jeremy sanders and we went over there and uh god was so gracious to us we we went over uh levi didn't know ezra was coming so he comes stomping out the front door and and uh just embraced him hugged him and there was tears and it was quite a blessing and then we went into the house and we just sat and we just fellowship just fellowshipped on the word just for an hour and a half maybe and then finally i said well we're here to baptize you you know we just couldn't stop talking about the word long enough to even have a baptism service so we we had a service i had prepared some scriptures and some things on water baptism and we spent some time just instructing in water baptism maybe 45 minutes and it was amazing to see the response to the word because we've had fellowship before but nothing like exhortation or preaching in any way and this really wasn't preaching we were all sitting in chairs in a circle but it was the first time we were just taking the word and beginning to break it down scripture after scripture and it was amazing to see them feed on the word the same way we feed on the word with the same pool with the same spirit and we become to certain things and certain phrases that come from the message ways of looking at the scripture and baptism and you would just see them light up just the expression the glow and you're like that hit the spot it hit them the same way it hit me you know and it was just such a camaraderie such a fellowship and so uh brother levi had i asked him i said you have a place to baptize he goes yeah the lord's provided and uh he said i was looking at horse troughs and i'm telling you we're in the mission field friends i'm looking at horse troughs and he said i went to tractor supply and i i we were looking at these poly ones but they were too short and finally i found the perfect one but i didn't have enough money to buy it and he said god just supernaturally provided and i went back and bought the perfect one it was a galvanized long horse trough and he had put it down in the basement where they're living temporarily in the house where they finish the upstairs into a kitchen area that's all concrete and they've got a big uh a big wood burning kettle they put it looks like they can put 20 gallons of water in there heat it up and have their water for the day when it cools off they heat it back up with a wood fire underneath and he had one bucket at a time filled this horse trough full and uh i don't know how hot he got it because we were upstairs fellowshipping for an hour hour and a half we went down it was still warm water so it might have been good we let it cool off we got down there and and uh brother ezra had told me that he had told the lord he said lord if you make a way for me to go i'm going to get re-baptized because i want to rededicate my life to you and ezra knows there's no scriptural mandate he doesn't have to do that but it was something in his heart he wanted to do as a way of consecration to the lord and god supernaturally made a way and so the first person baptized was brother ezra in the horse trough amen and then we baptized levi and i mean they were so eager to fulfill the word of god and you know the there's there's risk for them to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ it's not it's not without risk it's not without peril because there's a definite a a definite risk of shunning a definite risk of being put out from the community and separated from their families over this but they wanted to keep the word then we baptized annie and annie was so excited to be baptized it was just it was just a privilege to baptize her in the name of the lord and then came barbara barbara's levi's wife and barbara i she's got i've told you before she's bound in a wheelchair she has some disease and i'm not sure i've never got the name but it seems like ms or something like ms and she has low muscle control and she was a little timid early on about getting baptized because she was just afraid of the community she was a little bit concerned about what some of the older ones with the elders and her parents and things would think but levi just went through the scripture with her and she saw it in a word and she wanted to be baptized according to the word so they helped her in they got out of the wheelchair helped her in to get baptized and and uh and i had levi help me he was on one side and we went to baptizer in the name of the lord jesus christ and as we baptize her because she has a low muscle tone low muscle control she opened her mouth and sucked water in and got really severely choked very very choked come out of the water we had to stand her up and she was she was gagging she was choked and it was really kind of a troubling scene there for a moment and i just in my heart i was concerned for barbara because i knew she had this concern and i and i knew the devil i know how the devil works and makes that a see you shouldn't have done that or this is not a good thing kind of you know we've all been there before and i was just concerned in my heart and and it was quite an episode took quite a while to get her out and get her settled down and in a chair maybe four or five minutes before she could quit choking quick coughing and settle down got a drink and i was just determined i laid hands on each one and prayed for him that the lord would fill him with the baptism of holy ghost and i was determined that we were not finished until we laid hands and prayed for so she was sitting in the chair and i just went over and i laid hands and prayed for and i began to pray for the lord of filler with his spirit filler with the baptism of the holy ghost according to his promise and i began to pray for her healing and i began to lay hands on her and pray but by the same stripes that purchased our salvation of the same that purchased our healing and there's nothing to hinder the healing of our sister because she's accepted the word and as i did that i could hear her responding amen and i could hear her responding loudly and when i opened my eyes she had her hands up in the air and she was praying in pennsylvania dutch i believe it was worshiping and praising the lord and i just thought praise god god made a turn around in that situation it didn't stumble her so then we left and we walked outside and back around to the front porch while they got changed into dry clothes and things and levi come out on the front porch and he began to share with us he said you know i should have he said i should have helped barbara i should have put my hand over her mouth she just she can't hold her muscles tight for very long and and he says and when she got choked because i was concerned for her he says but when you prayed for her she raised her hand to begin to worship out loud and praise the lord said she has never done that her whole life and she has never seen it done before because we don't do that in the amish church it was spontaneous worship and praise amen praise god [Applause] and when he told me that just something inside of me just broke and melted because it and what the devil could have used for evil amen's all of a sudden god under the under the outpouring of the spirit spontaneously with never seeing it done before never having done in her life raises her hand and begins to worship god out loud oh praise god he's the same guide yesterday today and forever amen the children of god do not have to be trained on how to worship god all they need is the spirit to fall and they begin to worship god so i am very excited for what god is going to do for this family just keep them in prayer amen he said if if he said who knows what will happen when the elders find out that they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he said they very well could shun us all for that he goes but i don't know what will happen but but they chose to take the word and let god work it out so just be praying for them brother levi has a real strong burden for his people he knows he knows that he's subject to no ordinance of man he clearly he expressed it to us clearly he's under he's not subject to any rules any laws there's no binding there he said i know i could have a car i know i could have power tools i know i could have all of these things he says but i'm he reinforced the fact that i'm willing to subject myself to the ordinances to get the word to my brethren and so just pray for him pray that god will use his desire if he's got that design there's one soul there i pray god will connect the two and bring that one out and i appreciate your prayers appreciate your support it was a tremendous victory on monday afternoon and may god get all the glory and be praised for him amen i'm just thankful i thank god and you guys all have a part to play in them let's look here at ephesians chapter one as we get into the message for tonight i've got a real simple thought i want to share but it has profound impact on me as we look at these things and of course we're in the same vein of thought that we've been in but god just keeps opening up little pieces and we want to explore those in ephesians chapter 1 verse 3 it says blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are in earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom he also trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise so out of there i want to i want to take for a text he purposed and himself because we realized that everything we're a beneficiary of and everything we understand and the receiving of the message and receiving the word and the faith to believe is all because he purposed in himself he wasn't gone brother bam said god doesn't run his business uh inefficiently or in a bad way he said you businessmen wouldn't run your business this way you know just just hoping that things work out without any plan and without any foresight but he said god knew the end from the beginning he didn't just put out his word hoping someone would believe it he sent out his word knowing that there were those that were seed that was sown into the world that would receive it because he purposed it in himself everything's been working according to his purpose to the good pleasure of his will and so nothing's happening by happenstance and like we said before god is not adjusting according to the mood or the temperament or the political atmosphere i mean god is not adjusting his plan everything is adjusting to the will of god nations are rising and falling amen governments are shaking political systems are crumbling financial markets are rocking amen hurricanes are breaking out and fires all according to the will and purpose of god everything in this earth is moving according to his will and his purpose which he purposed in himself let's go back to genesis chapter one and let's let's look at a couple of verses here in genesis chapter one and verse one all the way into the beginning it's like we've been saying and the lord is making it more clear to me all the time that without understanding the beginning you'll never understand the end and and who was it that gave us understanding of the beginning amen it was a prophetic message that unlocked the seals and took the mystery off of this book amen so that we could see this beginning because a clear understanding of the beginning gives us a clear picture of what we're looking for in the end and chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness now i think it's interesting and this just struck me just recently that god constructs everything so perfectly and when god is going to begin to tell his story when he's going to begin to lay down the scripture for us he starts with a world in destruction he doesn't start with perfection when god wants to tell a story he starts with a world that is steeped in darkness shrouded in darkness water covering the face of the deep in in chaos and in a state of judgment amen because we realize that this book is really the story of the seventh seal and so god is not trying to tell us god is not trying to tell us a creation story so we'll believe he's a creator we believe he's a creator he's telling us a creation story and he's also not telling a creation story amen for us to understand scientific facts [Music] see there's been so much debate you know there's still so much debate on 24-hour periods and periods of time and i'm talking debate in the christian community trying to take a scientific approach to the beginning to prove that god was god created all things and who are they trying to prove it to they're trying to prove it to unbelievers but god didn't write it amen to prove that he's the creator we know he's the creator we believe he's the creator amen there's something in us that can reach out and grab it we're not here looking for evidence in pieces to prove it amen it's been proven in our he's the creator so it wasn't written that this creation account was not written for scientific information amen that you can use to put the agnostics to rest it was written to tell his story of redemption it was written for us to understand ourselves and where we came from and who we are and what his purpose is for us this bible was not written for god's understanding this bible was written for our understanding and god didn't write this bible amen to reveal the secrets to himself amen he wrote this bible to reveal it to us because the revealing to us is also the awakening of our seed so now when when he starts here in genesis he starts with the world he starts by by just stating the the obvious a fundamental truth that in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and brother of them tells us in the beginning could have been billions trillions it could have been whenever however long ago it was but there's something that takes place between verse 1 and verse 2 and now we find that that great creation he created is in chaos covered in darkness and in a form of judgment amen and what god is showing you is that in the beginning he created you amen you amen you were in the beginning in the beginning of the creation of god you have a part in that amen just like this earth amen this earth wasn't created oh if we could see this earth wasn't created in chaos this word fell into create chaos neither were you in the mind of god created in chaos [Applause] but your earthly journey amen when we begin to tell the life of the story of your earthly journey you start off in chaos covered in darkness shrouded in water covered in darkness and a form of judgment so this bible is written so that god because brother bam said the opening of the seven seals at the end time was to take the mystery off of the bible the opening of the seven seals was to reveal the mystery of the word amen to do what to awaken the bride to bring her in position so this bible the whole bible not just certain portions but this whole bible all this scripture was written for this end time and now you were in the mind of god perfect amen you were part in the beginning of god you were part of the the beginning in the manifestation things that that we don't fully realize or fully understand and maybe not be able to fully explain amen but we were there amen part of god from before but because of judgment amen because of sin because of judgment our earthly journey starts with us covered over in water shrouded in darkness and chaos in spiritual amnesia in the chaos of sinful flesh and the chaos of a fallen nature and the chaos of judgment but then god then god said let there be light and there was light when god decided that it was time to move from a judgment state to an eden state he began to speak the word amen because when god decided it was time to take you from a judgment state to an eden state he began to give you the spoken word and the spoken word amen began to move things in our lives it says now let's look at verse two again and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness right from the beginning he sets a principle down in genesis that's going to be a principle that will be sustained throughout the scripture that his spoken word is light and that light brings separation between light and darkness see everything is written for a purpose and everything is placed in the right order for a purpose so god begins now by his spoken word he begins to bring an order to the chaos and he he begins to to to refashion the earth but he's not just refashioning the earth uh haphazardly but he's doing it with a purpose in mind so every step in the process every spoken word is working towards a finish line working towards a purpose and we know that it took brother bam tells us clearly that it took six thousand years six days six thousand years for him to to work by the spoken word and for the word to go forth and do the work and bring about uh uh on earth and get every all the ingredients and all the elements that he wanted because what he he wanted more than plants he wanted more than animals more than fish more than birds although that was part of the picture the picture was never completed amen and like we said before god could never move to rest until he the great artist finished his masterpiece so he's got to work on the masterpiece for 6 000 years and can never move to rest until he has the masterpiece finished so by the way the scriptures uh structured you begin to understand how god creates his masterpiece he brings his word he separates light and darkness and then he begins to speak things into existence that will bring an order of form amen to he's preparing amen a place he's preparing structure he's preparing animals he's preparing everything but the great preparation is so that he can have an eden and in that eden he can plant a garden he can have a specific place and in that he can place his son amen which is himself expressed and when his son is himself expressed within that son was male and female and that was an expression of god but we find out it was not a perfect expression of god because if that was a perfect expression of god he would have moved into his rest but because it was not a perfect expression of god amen now god has to continue working and when he continues working now he's got to take that sun which is an expression of him and he's got to lay that sun down and strike a blow to his side and pull out some ingredients and split the the feminist and masculine spirit and now he's got to form a woman out of the man amen and he's got to bring the two back together amen because christ the tree of life is going to be smitten and the bride tree is going to come out of the tree of life male and female two trees in the garden of eden the tree of life and the bride tree so now he cannot rest until he's finished the great purpose that he purposed within himself does that make sense if all he wanted was to have jesus christ if that's all his goal was just to have himself expressed in fullness in one man jesus christ who would come and fulfill all the law and pay the price of redemption for all that was lost if that's all he wanted he could have moved into his rest after he put adam and flesh and put him in the garden but because he didn't stop working there he knows he's declaring the end from the beginning he's not giving us scientific information he's telling us he's prefiguring he's shadowing the whole rest of the bible and so now if we just catch what he's doing amen and not get caught up and and well you know he has light and spoken with light and light and then plants and then you know we have plants for the animals to eat i mean just forget about all of that and see what he's actually doing he's taking 6 000 years amen and after 6 000 years what's he going to have at the end of 6 000 years he's going to have something that he's so satisfied with he looked at all that he made and everything that he'd done and he said this is very good and he went to his rest what was it it was it was everything that he had purposed to make to bring it up amen so that he could have the backdrop for his masterpiece which was a masterpiece family which was a man and a woman that were one amen placed in dominion as gods upon the earth now he goes into his rest because his work is done but now satan's going to slip in and through deception he's going to mar the image of god and it's going to collapse why because he started the story with the creation and collapse in ruin shadowed in darkness and now his great image falls into collapse falls into ruin amen but what's he going to do over the next 6 000 years he's going to bring it right back to his masterpiece again brother branham says now the sun this isn't the message it is the rising of the sun at the rising of the sun well there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness it was without form and was void and it was all covered with water and was laying there in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of god moved upon that water and said let there be light and god had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there was seeds that he had planted and they had to have that sunlight to make it live and the first light that was ever given in the earth was god's spoken word the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word and i'd like to say that's the true light the sunlight is only a type of the true light but the spoken word of god is the true light and it is the true light that brings life to every true seed so the natural is only a reflection of the spiritual [Applause] the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned darkness and delight in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth then the spirit of god as it moved with love and compassion at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the earth see i want you to catch this the spirit of god as it moved with love and compassion see god's great purpose that he purposed he wasn't a cold formal creator i don't know any artist who's working on a piece of art i'm not an artist so i don't know but some of your artists how can an artist amen be forming something that comes from their heart they mean that comes from within them be working on something amen and not have a love for it not have a desire to it amen not be excited about seeing it it's fascinating it's coming together what's in my mind is starting to come into manifestation and there's an anticipation am i right brother nate i'm not an artist i don't know i'm just taking it for granted but there's an anticipation there's an expectation amen and as as you begin the the the the very image that was in your mind begins to take shape and begins to take form and becomes the manifestation there's an excitement there's an enthusiasm there's a love for the project there's a there's an inspiration that's boiling over amen don't think god was some formal god like a buddha sitting with his legs and arm crossed and then he has created create that create that let it all serve me no this was a this was a creation of love and compassion and joy and life upon the earth he was excited about what he was doing this was his purpose this was something that came from his heart the holy ghost was brooding over the earth brooding over the earth that's not a term that's cold and informal brooding amen is like a like a hen brooding over her chicks or are brooding over protecting and growing up and nurturing amen see the spirit of god hasn't moved with love and compassion at that great day the first day of dawn of creation upon the earth the sun rose and swept across its rays and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the earth by a seed that was a great hour oh it wasn't nothing like that sunrise like the sunrise that easter morning this time with the sun leaping into the skies it brought forth a greater sunrise than ever because it came a greater news with this sunrise than it did when the sun rise at the beginning the sunrise brought a news that he has risen he is quickened from the dead as he promised he has risen from the dead the first time the sun rose in genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth mortal life but this time when the sun rose there was a dual sunrise another sun rising it was not only the s-u-n rising it was the s-o-n had risen to bring eternal life to all god's promised seed that by foreknowledge he had seen laying upon the earth no more could the botany life live back there at the beginning with the s-u-n to without the s-u-n to bring it life no more than today when the sons of god is upon the earth it takes the esso in light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world now when god was working his creation he had a purpose that he purposed within himself he was not taking counsel he wasn't learning as he went he had a a purpose within his within himself and everything he spoke amen was moving everything in life according to his purpose everything was was coming into a certain fashion to a certain form to a certain placing amen according to his purpose amen and then when god signifies when he looks at everything all that he had made and all that he had done he said it is very good then he can rest signifying that he had he had fulfilled his purpose what he had planned what he had desired with that great love and compassion that was being expressed was now fulfilled and he had a he had a son and his son's bride amen they had adam male and female husband and wife upon the earth as gods upon the earth reflecting on the earth what was going on in heaven [Music] and he would come down in the cool of the evening and he would begin he began to walk with him in the cool of the day having perfect fellowship with his family with his children amen and it was it was god's purpose god's desire what god had worked for what he wanted but he knew it would fall he knew it would fall and out of the ashes out of the ruin he would start making his masterpiece again and he would start with the man jesus christ and he started through the old testament through moses and the prophets and uh the patriarchs and the prophets and he was what was he doing he was building back this fallen masterpiece again and he can't rest listen he can't rest until he gets it all back to where it's supposed to be he can't rest till every attribute of that bride every member of that bride is united back with the bridegroom again he cannot move to the millennium to the thousand year rest he cannot go there amen until after he's finished his work he's not laying down on the job amen he's not leaving it to itself amen but god is here giving out a spoken word and the spoken word is bringing light and bringing life and putting everything in our lives in order to bring the seed up to life to bring us back to that image that he had from the very beginning god is re it's what we're in is a repeat of genesis first couple of chapters of genesis brother ben says in 1957 the message titled love see the reason i chose this tonight is because my theme has always been love i think love is the most powerful force that the world has because god is love and there's no more powerful force than god and love is one of the greatest things that i could speak of he says in a message in 1960 god's provided way of approach to fellowship he said love is the most powerful force there is in the world there's nothing as great as love power only lays in love and it's amazing brother brahm said this was a creation of love and compassion it was god's love being expressed amen and god god purposed in himself because of his love that this is what he wants this is his desire his love expressed i mean his love expressed is a man and woman in dominion is god's on the earth that's the expression of his great love and i i'd say it this way god is love and god's purpose i'm just want to rephrase not to change what brother brahm said but god's purpose is the greatest force because god's purpose is his love his love brings his purpose and his purpose is the greatest force and the quiet the question i have tonight that it's it's it's a question that we all know the answer to intuitively but it's worth asking amen what in the world can resist his purpose when god said let there be light was there any possibility of light not coming forth it may have taken hundreds of years brother benham said he said it could have been 700 years before the light appeared but there was an impossibility for there not to be light right and brother bam said you know when he began to say let there be plants and trees he said it may have been hundreds of years before that word came into a perfect manifestation but it's an impossibility for the word not to be made manifest because he purposed it in himself and his his purpose is his love expressed and his love is expressed as his purpose and his purpose is the greatest force there ever is nothing can resist the will of god or the purpose of god do you realize that there was no possibility in the book of genesis and the creation account in 6 000 years there was no possibility to miss the bride because it was part of his purpose it was an impossibility that god would not bring forth a bride and unite the two together amen and and leave them as gods in eden that was an impossibility because it was his purpose if that was his purpose then that's his love expressed that's his purpose that's the force that's moving everything that's moving now and it's an impossibility that he will not have a bride on this earth that is without spot or wrinkle it's an impossibility he won't finish his work here in the sixth day we've come to the end of the sixth day six thousand years let's look at ephesians chapter two i wanna look at a couple scriptures and then move from there ephesians chapter 2. we're going to start at verse 1. and you hatha quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins you were in genesis 1 2. you had the quickened who were in genesis 1 2. amen where and in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so now he's telling you you were in this fallen condition like genesis 1 2. you had the quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin where in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit thou now worketh in the children of disobedience you were no different than them at least in the outward among whom also we all had our conversation in time past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love not because he felt sorry for us not you realize this was all according to his purpose he found us the same place he found the earth amen in his great purpose and his love and his compassion nurtured and brooded over that earth and spoke the word to get it to to fulfill his purpose and his purpose was expressed in adam and his bride upon the earth and now he finds you in the same place and then he begins to work through a spoken word amen god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace you're saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith in that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast so god's great love was going to be expressed to us to fulfill his purpose he was going to take his word and he was going to turn our chaos into a garden in our soul a garden where he can have christ and his bride together and where he himself can come and walk and have fellowship praise be to god i say god do that to me do that to me but see his his grace for by grace are you saved through faith so now god is bringing us to this place by faith by faith in his word but you realize that faith in his word amen it it gives us a chance to get a hold of his grace his grace is his love expressed to us it's his great love his great force his great purpose is his grace and he's given us the faith you're saved by grace through faith and not none of yourselves it is a gift of god and so now we have within us amen the seed that is planted that gives us the mechanism by which we can get a hold of this great purpose of god that's purposed out there when the light has come that the light is not going to quicken brother brahma said every seed to life but it's only going to quicken the seeds that have already been germinated and there's germinated seeds and those germinated seeds are the predestinated seeds and the predestinated seas as the light moves across as the word comes amen to call them out those germinated seeds down there have a capacity to believe the word and that capacity to believe the word begins to get that seed to respond to the light into the water of the word for the age and it begins to bring it out all the potential that's laying in that seed begins to manifest in this great recreation go to romans chapter 4 and i just want to reinforce this before i move to any more thought romans chapter 4 verse 9. we know this quite well but i just i really love this passage of scripture he said come at this blessedness upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision so what he's saying is is abraham was declared righteous by god part of the right to see because he could believe god's word when was he able to receive god's word was it when he was circumcised or uncircumcised he received it when he was uncircumcised foreshadowing that there would be a royal seat of abraham we were not part of the circumcision who could receive the word of god and when they believed the word of god it was counted unto them for righteousness why because by grace are you saved through faith and not on yourselves it's a gift of god now he says and he received a sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised and he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk on the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith this is where brother branham takes this portion of scripture right now and right here and he begins to tell you that you are the royal seed of abraham amen that you have every right to every promise that was given to abraham and abraham was told he would possess the gates of his enemy and he would be heir to all of creation and how so amen not by becoming a natural seed from a natural lineage amen but becoming a faith seed by believing the same faith that abraham had if you have that same faith then you are the faith seed of abraham and you have a right to every promise that was given to abraham because god gave promises to abraham although they were manifest in a fleshly natural way the promises were a spiritual promise for a royal seed to come into a full revelation in a full manifestation and what was it recognized by faith verse 14 for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression see this is such a beautiful passage of scripture because god is such a righteous god that he even gave cain an opportunity at salvation now he wasn't ever this is just now just let brother chad speak for a minute he wasn't ever going to turn cain he wasn't ever going to turn cain into an elect seed [Music] but he told cain if you'll just do as abel does want it be well with thee and if god told him he'd be well with him then it was going to be well with him he was offering a form of salvation to cain god wasn't playing games with cain he wasn't mentioning words if cain would have only been able to do what abel did he would have got some form of reward he said it will be well with thee but there was nothing inside of cain to be able to receive the word in fact he hated it and he fought against it but the seed of god is able god is so righteous that he still offers for whosoever would believe amen knowing that his seed is the only one capable of believing but in order to pass righteous judgment and stay just he's got to give an opportunity there and the requirement is to be able to receive the word for your day and anybody anybody has an opportunity to receive the word for their day amen but he brings the word in such an odd way he brings it so contrary to common thinking he brings it so backward to theological teaching that there's no way that anybody's going to receive it unless they already have the receiver on the inside to prove that they are a royal seat of abraham to prove that they are part of this recreation to prove that this is his purpose that he purposed within himself this is the one that i'm after and i'm going to be just i'm going to give the world the same opportunity cain had praise oh praise god friends all you have to do is believe god amen which part of god the current present tense i am i want to tell you this when you come in contact with i am you've come in contact with all of god if you only know a god that was you only have part of god [Music] because you're leaving off the present day part and that's partial amen impartial is not working and remember the only way to get the full measure is when you find the i am and come in contact with the i am you have everything he was and everything he will be is expressed here and i am and when you get a hold of god as i am that you've got god and god set his system up that when you can come in contact with the i am those royal seat of abraham all through the bible were able to recognize god present tense i am and they were able to respond by faith proving they were seed of abraham see let's go on here just a little bit further verse 15 because the law worketh wrath for whether no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed it's a purpose he purposed within himself tell me what will stop his purpose i want to tell you something right now your confused mind you're learning false doctrine you're getting twisted in your mind by false things will never stop his purpose his purpose is greater than your mind his purpose is greater than your past his purpose is greater than abuses and all kinds his purpose is greater and he already put something down in there that's going to be able to catch the word for the day to see the i am and say that's nothing but the truth and when we're able to do that he says that's my boy that's my girl that's my purpose being expressed in this day therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed it's a sure thing not to that only which is of the law but to also that which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickened the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they are they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that he had pro that that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness it wasn't abraham's righteous deeds that made abraham righteous his righteousness was an imputed righteousness which means put on god put on him righteousness because he believed god because when he goes down to gerrard he lies you understand abraham he and he's god calls him a prophet in that episode he says he's my prophet he's a prophet of god he's the roy he's the seed of god amen he's establishing the faith seed of god amen and the promises are laying in abraham and abraham goes down to gerar after a body change and he lies and says this is my sister tell him you're my sister and works all of this out and god comes to abimelech abimelech is acting righteously abimelech is righteous by deeds but he's not at the same level abraham as abraham is unrighteous by deeds abimelech is righteous by deeds but god declares abraham righteous by faith apart from deeds why because there's going to be a couple thousand years later come a sacrificial lamb that'll cover abraham's wrong deeds amen but there's nothing that can cover for no faith for a disbelief and an unbelief in the word of god there is no sacrifice that will cover for unbelief there's only a sacrifice that will cover for deeds not for unbelief [Music] so abimelech is acting righteous that's why government and reformation is never going to produce a seed of god it is never going to produce a bride there's no reformation we're not reformers we're not trying to change people's lives by being kind and nice to them and encourage them and have a buddy system amen the only way to change their life is give them the word of god if they take the word of god the spirit of god will come and they will be changed [Music] man we're not here to counsel you long counsel your law counsel you alone that's human efforts and human efforts will fail we are here to take the word and put the word in the situation when you receive that word there's a life that comes at that word and it has the power of transformation and if there's a seed of god in there that can receive that word amen that's got a power of transformation already built into the seed i don't care how low down your flesh has been and i don't care how vile and what kind of vile acts that you have died i don't care how shameful and embarrassed amen your life has been the power of transformation is not in your mind the power of transformation is in that seed and all that seed needs is the light the spoken word of god to hit that seed and it'll come to life and the power to transform wrong thinking wrong actions wrong habits is already there it was put in you before the foundation of the world when your name was put in the lamb's book of life god was ensuring that his purpose would not be defeated when he put a portion of himself and attributed to you to come forth in this day he was guaranteeing that nothing would disrupt his plan why because before he allowed this earth to fall into chaos after genesis 1 i don't know what happened but something happened and he allowed it to happen because he was foreshadowing what was going to happen to you and before the chaos broke out that would have an earth and judgment and chaos he made sure there was some good seeds that got down in that ground so nothing would defeat his purpose amen amen it's not you it's him get the whole idea of you out of the picture all this idea of i can't do it and i can't live enough and i've tried and failed forget it just surrender to the word and say god give me all of that word every bit that i can get and stay with the word friends i've seen so many people jump in and jump out jump in and jump out and jump in and jump out and say i just can't have victory i just can't stop failing you stick with the word don't leave it no matter what happens how discouraged you get how bad how much sin and backsliding you stay with that word until it changes your life because the seed of god will stay with that word they won't leave it they'll stick with it and the power of transformation will change that life [Applause] amen what do we need we need to have confidence in what god the way god brings the seed up the way god brings life is by a spoken word [Music] amen we're always trying to find somebody to help us and somebody to fix us and somebody to talk to me what we need is to have confidence if i'm a seed of god everything i need he's placed in that seat and he can unlock it by his spirit i need to stay in the atmosphere of the word let's read verse 21 again and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also i hope that thrills your soul amen i hope it thrills you that that abraham could believe god he could believe god's promise believe god's word grow stronger in faith amen get a body change meet god in flesh recognize god and flesh get a body change go to career and lie and still have righteousness imputed unto him i hope that thrills your soul because it thrills mine because god didn't just do that for abraham he did it for all of abraham's seed and if you're abraham's faith seeth he's got you in the same place he's got abraham and he didn't do it just for abraham he did it for you and i as well it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification i want to take a good look at this scripture so nobody goes to the denominational idea it says but for us also verse 24 to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead it didn't say if you believe he raised up jesus from the dead read it again because the denominations would like you'd like to say if you believe that he raised jesus from the dead then it's imputed unto you for righteousness you're saved that's not what the word says it says if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord who is him it's god the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and if you want to have the same imputation of rights that abraham had you have to believe on him the word amen that raised up a that raised up jesus christ from the dead it's not enough just to believe that god raised jesus from the dead billions believe that but you must believe on him who raised jesus from the dead who raised jesus from the dead the spoken word of god because he said after three days praise be to god brother branham says in the smyrnan church age out of the church age book so they are like the children of israel who come out of egypt and stop short of the promised land now those children of israel left egypt about 2 million strong they all journeyed together all saw the same miracles of god all partook of the same man and water from the smitten rod all followed the same cloud by day in the pillar of fire by night but only two reached the promised land only two were true or real believers that is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief and because of unbelief they could not enter in hebrews 3 19 then since that is so and only two entered the rest were not true believers what made the difference two stayed with the word also was not based on conduct it was based on faith and faith influenced their conduct when the heart of the ten spies failed at cadiz barnea joshua and caleb did not stagger for they believed the word and said we are more than able to take the land they knew they could because god had said i have given you the lamb after all those israelites saw the power of the goodness and deliverance of god they did not enter into rest which is a type of the holy ghost so you can see right now that very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the spirit of god all right we have come this far now i want to go further and when i do i know i'm going to cause some emotions to rise but that is something i am not responsible for i am responsible to god in his word and the people god has sent me to i have to be faithful in all he gives me to say in john chapter 6 verse 37 and verse 44 it says all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i shall know wise cast out no man can come to me except the father draw him and i will raise him up in the last day john 1 12 and 13 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of the man but of god ephesians 1 4 and 5 according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now without getting too involved in the subject of the sovereignty of god for that would take a book in itself let me point out here that according to these verses jesus christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their brides today the bride today the bride today does not simply decide she's going to take a certain man for her husband no sir it's the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride i love this because if god has called your name by revealing the mysteries you're his bride and you didn't choose him he chose you [Music] if you have a a receiver a crystal on the inside that can pick up the radio signal that's coming from heaven coming from the word then that means you're the predestinated one you're the elect you're the child of god you're the seed you're the bride and you didn't put the receiver inside you didn't choose to receive even choosing you could never receive and pretending you can never get it but it has to be there predestinated john 15 16 says you have not chosen me but i have chosen you he's looking at his disciples and he says you haven't chosen me i chose you was peter looking for jesus or jesus looking for peter jesus came to peter washing his nets and said come follow me i mean jesus knew where zacchaeus was in the truth zacchaeus thought he could hide and look at jesus but jesus knew where zacchaeus was and called to him to come down he says you haven't chosen me but i've chosen you god knew where you were hiding god knew what tree you were hiding in he knew what methodist tree and what baptistry and what fig leaves you were hiding behind he knew where you were you didn't choose him he chose you he goes on in this course he says now according to the word of god the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world the choosing of the bride was purposed in himself ephesians 1 9. and in romans 9 11 it says that the purpose of god according to election might stand you can't read it any other way i read this quote two weeks ago or something like that but just catch this the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own chosen if you want to get to the heart of it the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing not everyone who says lord lord that's not what he wanted do you understand what i'm saying he did not want everybody that would attach to religion that would have an intellectual understanding but he wanted a bride of his own choosing so he had to make sure he had a mechanism in place so that only his bride would come oh i tell you friends there there are some times that i get discouraged and i get discouraged sometimes because some people would like to take the message and filter it through apologetics to make it palatable and easy to explain god is not looking for people to agree with the message he's looking for a bride of his own choosing and he set the parameters for choosing and that choosing was going to be by faith in the i am his present tense word and he was going to bring his word amen through a kentuckian with a seventh grade education who wouldn't even complete a thought until he went way around the cowshed he would start explaining a scripture and stop amen and greet people in the audience and then come over here and tell this story and finally several chapters pages paragraphs whatever later he would get back around and then he would start to explain what he didn't explain or he'd halfway explain it then he would finish it in another sermon or he would lay down a foundation in here and come back two months later and touch the same point why because he's trying to hide it amen he's trying to hide it and reveal it at the same time because he doesn't want a bride who chooses him he wants a bride of his own choosing that's his purpose so he put a bride seed in the land to come forth at a certain period of time he would have a certain word to match that seed to quicken it to life amen and only that seed and that word are the only two things that can link together you were born in the perfect time in the perfect season to catch the perfect word amen to come to life the heart purpose listen friends i'm not just talking i'm telling you brother brahm said the heart purpose of god amen everything he's been doing just like he did in the days of creation everything he was doing was to get his son and his son's bride together again and in eden that was his heart purpose there his heart purpose now is to have a bride of his own choosing amen and not just to say uh lord lord that was them calling him lord and he says depart from me i never knew you amen but his heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing if you think you had anything to do with this then you need to start over [Music] you didn't figure anything out you weren't smart enough you didn't read enough books till you finally come to a conclusion amen if that's so you chose him and he didn't want a bride that chooses him he's not looking for a modern day layout to see and woman that says i'll choose him that's not what he wants amen he wants somebody to stay humble and submissive and he says this is the one i choose and his choosing is expressed the same ways expressed in abraham by faith in the present tense i am god the heart purpose the eternal purpose i just don't want you ever to forget that the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god is to take a bride of his own choosing i want to ask you the question did he choose you or did you choose him if he chose you oh friends i wasn't looking for the message i was washing my nets i was hiding in a pentecostal tree he come my way i was just as bad off as the samaritan woman going to the well amen already on the sixth husband but he come and he found me because he had needs to go by because why he wanted a bride of his own choosing and you know what you and i aren't the only people who's heard this message who's had an opportunity in life how many millions and billions have turned away from it but yet something in you flickered to life and you couldn't put it out then nobody else could blow it out and enough denominational tainted water poured on it wouldn't quench it either something came to life that wouldn't go out because he wanted a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world if god chose you i'm going to say this and catch it friends if god chose you you're his heart purpose you're part of his heart purpose are you worried about being lost not making it not being good enough not measuring up not oh we got to let all that fade away let all that disappear because you haven't chosen me i've chosen you i gave you the ability to receive i put a seed in you before the foundation of the world i made sure that when the word come along there was something and you would say that's nothing but the truth and when everybody you loved and everybody you trusted in religion told you you were wrong you still said that's the truth because his heart's purpose was to have a bride of his own choosing it wasn't your choice but there goes and says watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of stardust before god was god god is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially god and he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts i was in genesis 1 1 before before he found my earth void and shrouded in darkness and in judgment and in chaos i was eternal existing in his thoughts genesis chapter 1 is my story amen it's not a story it's the story to unlock the mystery of my life and he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of god they are eternal are they not in the sardisian church age he says now let us go another step but before we do let us review our case thus far first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of god stands an election it was purposed in himself it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was pre she was foreknown and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and can never never that's all capitalized in the church but he could never come into condemnation just like abraham could never come into conan you realize abraham was wrong abraham was lying but he could never come into condemnation because of faith in god amen praise be to god his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her because she has no unbelief in her soul i want to read just one sentence out of here again it was god's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride if we're trying hard to be the word bride if we're laboring trying straining stretching to be a word bride then that totally dissolves what brother branham just told us he said he purposed he i'm telling you what's the greatest force that's moving everything his purpose his will god's purpose was based on his love he purposed to have a people like unto himself and he is the word that's why he says she'll be a word bride she's not going to have to strain and stretch and try to be the word bride why because he already purposed should be the word bride and because he already impurposed that that's the manifestation he's looking for this day he made sure there was something down inside that vessel that could respond to a spoken word just like in genesis 1 he made sure before he said let the grasses and the trees bring forth he made sure before before ever destruction came he made sure some seeds got planted so that when he spoke there was something there that could respond and because god determined that he would have a word bride in the last days unlike any other people that's been on the planet friends you realize this this is a higher order this is a higher calling this is a higher manifestation for the bride it's not a straining and doing spiritual exercises and working my way into endurance to become a word bride no he already purposed you would be the word bride he already foreordained your position your place that you would come to be a perfect bride by receiving a perfect word amen to bring forth the perfect life of jesus christ in human vessels by what by the predestinated purpose of god that's laying in your soul amen that he unlocked with his spoken word and he is watering with the washing of the water of the word to bring all the potential that's in that seed to life we don't it's not a straining amen it's not a pushing it's not a reformation it's not a writing down the rules and putting them on the refrigerator so we remember dress modestly don't use these words and you understand it's not that it's a life that's already locked inside the seat that's been unlocked by the light for this hour the spoken word in this day meeting the i am amen imputing righteousness unto you and bringing out that life that's already there what do we do rest brother i said the whole christian walk is based on rest well how can i rest i'm still making mistakes how can i rest i still have a temper how can i rest i still keep falling into the same hole how can i rest you rest because no matter how much you strive you're going to fall right back in that same hole you have to rest and let the word do the work you have to rest in the fact that god is purposed he's called he's chosen he's ordained he's called me to a certain manifestation in a certain day and he purposed it and nothing not even my own wrong thinking can stop his purpose nothing not even my past not even my failures not even the habits that are still in my flesh can stop his purpose because it's an eternal purpose that he purposed in himself and he will not fail to bring it forth but you've got to stay in the word and let the word do the work the devil has deceived many because this try i'm trying well then you're choosing him i'm trying to believe then you're trying to choose him the word come to unlock the royal seat of abraham so that the amnesia can be begin to break away the cloud that's overshadowing the spiritual amnesia can begin to disintegrate and the light can hit the seed because the power of transformation into the bride of jesus christ jesus christ in brideform is in the city and if we'll just stay in the word and trust that this is his purpose this is his plan this is his calling this is his heart purpose all i got to do is have the same faith of abraham abraham could not make himself young again no matter how hard he tried abraham could not restore his seed no matter how he charged and neither could abraham turn back sarah's womb and give her back her time of life it was totally out of his hands he could do nothing but believe what he was told and we've been called to the faith of abraham i can do nothing about it but believe what i've been told i can do nothing to be the word by but believe what i've been told to receive it to accept it to say that's thus saith the lord that's nothing but the truth and i'm part of that and i'm trusting him to do the part that i can't do praise god let's turn over to romans chapter 8. we're going to skip through a little bit of this and finish here in romans chapter 8. verse 31 romans 8 31 what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth just as if you've never done it in the first place who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that has risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord and it was his great love and compassion to begin to brood over the earth and bring it up and it's his great love and compassion has been brooding over your earth to bring up his eden condition again what's he asking us to do what do i do next believe believe believe confess believe and let the word do the work that it's predestinated do let the word change us transform us make us that word bride let's all stand friends musicians you can come you know god knew where moses was when moses ran away and god didn't decide to get another deliverer or another moses because he had already purposed that this vessel would be moses the seed was already there his portion of himself the attribute that would be moses was already there god couldn't swap it out for another so when moses gets discouraged and he tries in his own efforts and he fails and he runs off into the wilderness god never lost track of that seed and he never kicked him away and he never changed his eternal purpose for moses but in due season when moses had learned some things when there was lessons that were learned when humility had come when moses no longer thought that he could do anything he come to moses and and now he found moses and told moses now you go right back and do what i always purpose for you to do not in your strength and not your way but now you're going to do it my way amen see god knew where moses was he wasn't going to get another moses when jonah got the commission and what he heard seemed too complicated too difficult too hard more than he wanted to give jonah ran away and got on the ship to go the opposite way and god didn't say well if he's going to act that way i'll get somebody else to do my work but even jonah's heir was playing right into god's hand because he had already prepared a fish [Music] he knew jonah's weakness he knew jonah's fair but he also knew how to get the nineveh because they worshipped the fish god so he runs away and he says oh how can he how can he do that god that's god's predestinated seed so he swallows him up in a fish and he swims him right back and spits him out on dry land and he preaches the gospel and they're converted or they repent see god it doesn't matter how many times you've failed how many times you've run away how many times you backslid he's not going to replace you with another predestination he can't he purposed within himself he's already determined it's already purposed it's already written in the book he's not going to cast you away and get another one he's not going to just let you go but at some point you're going to encounter the pillar of fire that's going to put you right back in the commission that he originally called you he's going to catch you in the whale of the belly of a whale and spit you on dry land so you're going to finish the work that he purposed for you to finish you're going to get there one way or the other but you're going to get there you're going to fulfill his purpose for your life you're going to do what he's called you to do you're going to do what was in his mind from before the foundation of the world whether it's easy whether it's hard amen you're going to do it anyways elijah got tired a lot of spiritual battles fighting that jezebel spirit showdown on mount carmel she threatens to kill him he runs away tired overworked stressed and then lays down under a juniper tree and prays that god will take his life god didn't reject him god didn't cast him away god didn't even scold him god sent the angels one of the angels with the softest hands why because he had a purpose for elijah elijah took a stand for him and elijah took a lot of scars he comes down he sends the angel with the softest hands stroke his face it prepared angel food and fed him brother ram said then he had an angel choir with the sweetest voices sweeter than any mother could sing a lullaby sing him back to sleep to let him rest then wake him up and feed him said you'll need the strength of this journey and he goes to horeb amen he goes to horeb and he goes into a cave and he's running away and he's hiding out and god allows a great fire to come across but god wasn't in the fire a great whirlwind but god wasn't in the whirlwind an earthquake but god wasn't in the earthquake but then a still small voice and god was in the still small voice brother ben said that still small voice was the word of god not without show not with showmanship not with earthquake not with fire not with great but just the common word of god god wasn't in the fire and the earthquake and he wasn't but he was in this word his spoken word the still small voice and there was something in elijah no matter how tired he was and how much he wanted to die and how much he was finished amen with his commission and with his work amen the still small voice got his attention it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you backslid if you run away if you got discouraged if you got tired of church blitz you got tired of fights and you got tired of your own failure and you ran away he can get your attention with the word and he asked elijah elijah what does thou do is dear he said well i've been zealous for your word i've done this and this has happened and they seek my life he goes through the whole explanation he says what doest out here he goes through the whole explanation again and god doesn't say anything in response to what he said he said okay i want you to finish your work i want you to go back and anoint elisha i want you to go back and anoint jehu i want you to go back because god had a purpose for elijah god had a calling in his life a work that he couldn't give for anybody else to do he had to feed him he had to give him rest he had to bring him to the cave and he had to use the word to wake him up and bring him out of his spiritual amnesia and he had to ask him where are you what what are you doing here elijah the same thing he asked adam when adam got got stuck in a fall amen and he got that fear and spiritual amnesia he said adam where are you like god didn't know where adam was but god needed adam to say where he was he needed adam to confess and repent and confess where he was at i want to say to you elijah where are you what cave are you hiding in your battle scarred you weary tired tired of fighting tired of failing tired of your own mess tired of other people's messes tired of strife tired of conflict tired of war spiritual war where are you you're still here your work's not finished god's not going to come and say yeah that's all right i know it's pretty bad well you just i had some other things but i'm going to give them this no god's going to come down to the word and if the still small voice is going to get your attention and say what are you doing you've left my work you've left my commission your job's not done yet go and finish god's purpose for us will be finished we'll be finished we may run like jonah we may get discouraged and hide out like moses we may go to a cave like elijah but his purpose will be finished in us what do i recommend you do stay in the word trusting the simple still small voice let it work the messages of the prophet reading your bible listening to the preaching word just let it do what it was intended to do because he purposed to have a bride of his own choosing and that's me and he's got to work for each one of us to do you and i and nobody else is going to do it it's already given to you i say god you found me in my cave you found me your word found me lord and god i want to go and finish what you've called me to do the reason i'm there's a reason i'm on this planet there's a reason i've heard this word there's a reason i'm in this flesh there's a reason that i'm still here and god i hear your word and i'm signing up for the rest of the journey praise god friends take courage his heart purpose of god was to have a bride of his own choosing the purpose of god was to have a people like unto himself to be the word bride that's his decision not yours that's his purpose not yours and it's going to come to pass in our lives let the word bring it let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father god i pray i don't know where i don't know who but lord if there's elijah that's hiding in a cave somewhere i pray you get to them lord let your still small voice get their attention may you ask them where are you why are you not in fellowship with the believers why are you not in church why are you not serving my commission why have you backed off and cooled off on the word god i don't know but you know lord you know the purpose that you have for each life you know what you determined before the foundation of the world and you'll not stop working until you finish that purpose i say god working us forgive us for our running away forgive us for our being discouraged and going to the back side of the desert forgive us for hiding in the cave forgive us for expressing our discouragement forgive us for wanting to give up lord but this evening i want to say lord i'm here you've called me you've purposed for me to do what you've called and purpose for me to do and i'm here lord let your word wash me grow me into that thing you want me to be that place you want me to be do your work through this vessel god find your elijah's lord and bring him out of the cave and recommission them lord and put them back in service find your moses who run away lord let them meet the pillar of fire and get back in service find your jonas who are running from their calling running from a greater sacrifice lord trying to keep from giving everything i pray to find them lord and use whatever circumstance to bring them back to their purpose lord only you know how to do it are you determined before the foundation of the world and we're trusting you to keep your word lord thank you god for giving us faith to believe thank you lord for planting a seed within us that of no choice of our own you put it there lord so that we could believe and thank you god that you've imputed unto us righteousness like our father abraham we
