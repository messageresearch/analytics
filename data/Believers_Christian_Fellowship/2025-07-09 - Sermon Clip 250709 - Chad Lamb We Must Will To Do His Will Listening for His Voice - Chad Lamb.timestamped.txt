[0:00] And brother Bam said, "I was nervous and
[0:02] I done it in a catch of a moment when
[0:05] Satan caught me."
[0:07] I'm so glad he told us these things
[0:10] because I've been caught in a catch of a
[0:12] moment before.
[0:13] I've been caught all nervous and tied up
[0:15] in my mind and say something, don't even
[0:17] know why you said it or do something,
[0:18] don't even know why you do it, and you
[0:19] react to a situation. Amen. And and
[0:22] almost always it's this old outer man
[0:24] trying to save itself.
[0:26] Save itself from suffering. save itself
[0:28] from whatever. Amen. It's usually this
[0:30] old outer man trying to save itself.
[0:33] Amen. And that's what brother Ben
[0:34] Brandon was going through. Amen. But but
[0:36] the thing that got me is he knew that he
[0:39] was condemned when his wife asked him
[0:41] the question, but he tried to go on. But
[0:42] when God spoke to him and brought it to
[0:44] his face, Amen. that man wasn't dodging
[0:47] it anymore. When God brought it right to
[0:49] his face, Amen. he repented. Amen.
[0:51] That's a son of God. That's a man who
[0:53] will lay down his will for God's will.
[0:55] It doesn't mean you will never make a
[0:57] mistake. And you and I won't ever get
[0:59] things wrong and we won't get caught in
[1:00] a catch of a moment and we won't have
[1:02] all the same things that other human
[1:04] beings have. But when God brings it to
[1:06] our face, there's something inside of us
[1:08] says, "God, I'm sorry.
[1:10] I'm sorry, God." And we'll we'll we will
[1:13] bring our will subject to his will.
[1:16] Amen. I'm so thankful for that. So
[1:20] thankful God has people on the earth
[1:21] today that will do that. Amen. So, it's
[1:25] not just making a mistake. You remember,
[1:28] uh, I read here just a few weeks ago the
[1:30] interview of Sister Bruce.
[1:33] I pulled it up. Sister Bruce was
[1:35] struggling because of her mistakes. And
[1:38] she said, Sister Bruce says, "I make so
[1:40] many mistakes and I fail so many times."
[1:44] Does anybody ever felt, don't raise your
[1:46] hand, but anybody feel that way?
[1:49] Amen. And this is, this is Brother
[1:51] Bram's answer to her. That's why Christ
[1:54] had to die so that you with your
[1:56] mistakes wouldn't be lauded to you. See,
[2:00] he took your mistakes. Your desire in
[2:02] your heart is to serve him. And Sister
[2:05] Bruce says, "Yes."
[2:07] All right. That's what he died for so
[2:09] you could serve him. See, not your
[2:11] mistakes are not looked not lauded to
[2:14] you. He's your propitiation. He's your
[2:16] sin offering. Your sins are not known.
[2:19] You're not a sinner before God. Christ
[2:21] took your sins and became you because
[2:23] your desire is to serve him.
[2:26] Is your desire to serve him?
[2:28] Is your desire to lay your will down for
[2:30] his will? Amen. You don't get it 100%. I
[2:33] don't get it 100%. But nothing changes
[2:36] that desire. Sometimes I get tripped up
[2:38] in a nervous condition when I get all
[2:40] stumbled around. But that never changes
[2:42] what's in the depths of my soul. I want
[2:44] God's way to be my way every day of my
[2:46] life. I want him to have his way in me.
[2:49] I don't want to fail. I don't want to
[2:50] make mistakes. I don't want to make the
[2:52] wrong decision. I don't want to go the
[2:54] wrong way. I don't want to bring a
[2:55] reproach against his name. But I do all
[2:57] of that.
[2:59] But that's the reason he died because he
[3:01] knows we're just human beings.
[3:04] So, we got to quit looking at every
[3:07] failure and start looking at what's the
[3:08] desire of our life and what are we
[3:10] living for. Amen. And say, God, if I got
[3:13] off the trail, bring me back on the
[3:14] trail. If I made a mistake, bring me
[3:16] back, God. Bring it to my face. Speak to
[3:19] my heart, Lord, that I can repent and
[3:21] lay this will down for your will.
