[12:24] you the
[12:28] [Music]
[12:39] uh good morning I'm Jason eron Tim's NE
[12:43] nephew many of you who go way back with
[12:45] him will remember me as the ring bearer
[12:47] in his marriage to Janet in 1980 right
[12:50] no
[12:52] okay I had to write a few uh words about
[12:55] my Uncle Timmy and uh I know a person's
[12:57] life is like a diamond there's many fast
[12:59] ETS and you can you can look through the
[13:01] different facets and they reflect light
[13:03] differently and so um I'm hoping the
[13:05] things I share uh will connect with the
[13:07] way you knew my Uncle Timmy because to
[13:09] me he was just always Uncle
[13:12] Timmy U my memories begin in the 70s and
[13:15] this is the first time in 50 years where
[13:18] uh my Uncle Tim will not be a tangible
[13:20] part of of my life uh in the circle of
[13:25] those I love and care about uh but
[13:29] although he's become a memory what a
[13:30] great memory he is and to remember means
[13:33] to memorialize and so in a way when we
[13:35] remember someone we bring them to life
[13:38] in our own minds in our own in our own
[13:39] hearts even though we know as my dad
[13:41] said on the phone the other day he goes
[13:43] he's fine he's he's the only one of us
[13:45] right now is fine and I think that's a
[13:47] good thing to remember Uncle Tim is ju
[13:50] doing just fine it's for ourselves that
[13:52] we grieve
[13:53] today my Uncle Timmy uh inventive and
[13:57] creative he had a work shop in his home
[14:00] in ramble Ridge uh uh was filled with uh
[14:04] dremels and tools and parts and pieces
[14:08] mostly airplanes and gliders things that
[14:10] were together and would be together and
[14:12] things that were broken and need to be
[14:14] put together
[14:15] again he exuded fun and energy for
[14:20] Life anytime I I I picked up the phone
[14:23] I'd see his name on my phone and say Tim
[14:25] erant two or three times a year I'd call
[14:26] me hey nephew I mean he just always hey
[14:29] there's always this energetic sing songy
[14:31] note in his greeting I got a birthday
[14:34] text a month early this past year for my
[14:36] 50th it was actually on my I think it
[14:39] must have been Daniel's birthday it was
[14:40] November 16th and uh said hey nef just
[14:43] didn't want to forget your birthday this
[14:45] year and uh don't real thank you it's a
[14:48] month early but 50 is a big one so thank
[14:50] you Uncle Tim it's
[14:52] awesome which brings me to the next one
[14:54] he cared about and took time for people
[14:57] and um uh
[15:00] just in his demeanor I I guarantee if he
[15:02] were walking these this place today and
[15:04] we couldn't see him he'd be wanting to
[15:05] comfort every single one of
[15:08] us he made parachutes and from wax paper
[15:11] and string he did it at the at the table
[15:13] for me at 9705 Redman Avenue at the
[15:15] kitchen table I remember just being in
[15:17] awe of how is this going to work out it
[15:20] might have been a garbage
[15:22] bag garbage bags and
[15:25] string he loved to sail he loved to fly
[15:28] in airplanes he loved to ride
[15:30] motorcycles he did all three with with
[15:32] his brother his big sister his dad with
[15:36] me and that's quite a blessing in fact I
[15:39] think there was a morning on a Saturday
[15:41] where I got to 100 miles hour on the
[15:42] Nighthawk with him I think it's okay to
[15:44] tell that
[15:48] now I think um in the obit Bo what a
[15:52] great
[15:52] picture I opened my my uh I opened
[15:55] Facebook I think it was Daniel posted it
[15:57] and I never know should you like an obit
[15:58] u i just but but I thought that picture
[16:03] what a that captures the face you could
[16:05] have put any the only thing missing was
[16:07] a Bluetooth earpiece but other than that
[16:11] fantastic but he told stories and there
[16:14] was always a a a boom there was always a
[16:16] vocal emphasis at the major plot point
[16:19] this was boom you know he would shout
[16:21] the point he wanted to
[16:23] emphasize and uh
[16:25] wow uh my brother uh is in Saudi Arabia
[16:28] he couldn't be here here he'll be here
[16:29] on the 25th but he says remember to tell
[16:32] the story of Grandpa saving his life by
[16:34] building him a toy crossbow out a
[16:36] surgical tubing and then quickly
[16:37] dismantling it when he found that uh it
[16:40] put an arrow through the garage door
[16:42] this is too dangerous to give to his
[16:49] 10-year-old he taught me chords to more
[16:51] than one pop song so like could played
[16:53] on the piano I know this is the church
[16:55] crowd but Steve Winwood's Valerie I can
[16:57] hear him playing that
[16:59] I can hear Peter and the Wolf I can hear
[17:01] him coming over that's not Benny and the
[17:03] Jets this is Benny and the
[17:07] Jets one night he rented he and Janet
[17:10] took me to Benson to their new house and
[17:11] they're newly married rented a VCR in
[17:13] the in the evening so I could see Empire
[17:15] Strikes Back because I'd seen the first
[17:17] one I'd seen Return of the Jedi but I'd
[17:19] not seen Empire Strikes Back come to my
[17:21] place we'll rent this suitcase sized
[17:25] VCR take it home I'll show you uh Empire
[17:29] Strikes Back it was fantastic took me to
[17:31] the driving range to hit buckets of
[17:33] balls he came way out to boy town almost
[17:35] where I lived and took me down to a hit
[17:37] balls at the driving range on
[17:42] 120th one of my favorite memories he
[17:44] made a surprise visit to our driveway
[17:46] one night I looked out the window and I
[17:48] couldn't tell what kind of what is this
[17:49] in my driveway it was unexpected there
[17:51] was no cell phones in
[17:53] 1986 and out under the uh garage light
[17:56] was a white Acura Integra and me and Dad
[17:59] went out and he took us on a rip roaring
[18:01] thrilling ride through the darkened
[18:02] roads of West Omaha uh which I'm still a
[18:05] little bit unnerved by put that car
[18:08] through its paces and what just a what a
[18:10] fun EXC uh what a fun
[18:13] moment he was blessed with the sense of
[18:15] adventure he was blessed with Janet and
[18:18] I got to say you my grandpa if he was
[18:20] here he'd say you know what Tim told me
[18:23] when he got engaged I saidwell Tim she's
[18:26] taller than you and he said Dad she's
[18:27] worth the climb'
[18:29] Grandpa he told that
[18:32] story just about every time he
[18:34] interacted with
[18:35] him I'm sure you all have heard it right
[18:38] oh that's a surprise to
[18:41] you Lori told me to be
[18:43] careful he was blessed with Daniel what
[18:46] a sharp mind and sharp wit Nathan who's
[18:49] I and I know you guys all have this
[18:51] musical ability but I remember at the
[18:53] wedding a a little over a year ago now
[18:55] when you were playing piano and good
[18:57] grief
[18:59] Matthew man he's so proud of
[19:02] you and I think he'd be proud that
[19:04] you're twice as height
[19:06] now somebody's got to be the fork in the
[19:09] errant tree and get
[19:10] us get us up
[19:13] there you know he endured a major loss
[19:15] early on in life with his mother passing
[19:17] in 1977 my grandmother Janet sent me
[19:20] this amazing poem this week and I was
[19:22] like I read it to Lori in my kitchen and
[19:24] I'm crying and Lor's crying my girls are
[19:26] crying I was like I can't read this up
[19:28] there but it's fantastic if if you get a
[19:30] chance ask Janet to share it if if she's
[19:33] willing um he endured more than one his
[19:36] sharei of struggle late in life too but
[19:38] he kept on keep keeping on and isn't
[19:41] that all of us any of us can do it's a
[19:44] great uh psychologist to see him all
[19:45] over YouTube Jordan Peterson who says
[19:48] life is terminal and that's real life
[19:51] all comes down to this but then life
[19:53] opens up into something more and
[19:56] something greater and that's the part we
[19:57] got to keep in mind right yeah it comes
[19:59] down to this here on this side but we
[20:02] have this great hope of the Glorious
[20:03] appearing of our great God and Savior
[20:05] Jesus
[20:06] Christ and he persevered through it all
[20:09] he kept that in mind he inspired and he
[20:11] impacted us all along the way Lori and I
[20:14] got to visit him a couple months ago uh
[20:16] out in um ad delphus I think it
[20:19] was and before I left I got
[20:22] to I was with with with these guys for
[20:25] just a few hours I went but before I
[20:26] left I hugged him I just whispered and
[20:28] him as is here I thanked him for many of
[20:30] the things on this
[20:32] list cuz at some level you just
[20:39] know this day came much too soon I feel
[20:42] a little ripped
[20:43] off and I'm sure you don't feel much
[20:46] different from me much too soon much too
[20:48] fast for my liking liking as a great uh
[20:52] great preacher on the radio Jay Vernon
[20:53] McGee once said you might not like how
[20:56] God runs the universe and you might even
[20:57] have a better plan but you don't have a
[21:02] universe so I trust this wonderful man
[21:05] to the hands of his wonderful Creator
[21:07] the one who gifted him to us in the
[21:09] first place I look forward to the hope
[21:11] of the Glorious appearing of our Lord
[21:12] and Savior Jesus Christ and I think of
[21:14] these words from the old hymn God Moves
[21:17] In A mysterious way he says you fearful
[21:19] Saints fresh courage take the clouds you
[21:22] so much dread are big with mercy and
[21:25] shall break in blessings on your head
[21:28] I'm thankful for the time I had with my
[21:30] Uncle Tim and for being able to share
[21:33] this reflection with you today God
[21:40] [Music]
[21:53] bless very soon we'll all go home
[21:58] and walk the streets of
[22:01] gold and each one of us a
[22:05] portion Heaven
[22:09] share but for all the jewels and
[22:13] gold and the riches yet
[22:17] Untold these things are not the
[22:20] reason I'll be
[22:23] there I want to see
[22:27] Jesus at at the end of the
[22:31] race I want to see
[22:35] Jesus and look on his
[22:38] face life trials will see
[22:42] nothing every pain that we
[22:47] bear I want to see
[22:50] Jesus and that's why I'll be
[22:55] there all the prophets we shall
[22:59] we and we'll sit down at their
[23:02] feet and for years we'll sit and
[23:06] listen to them
[23:10] share all the things that they will
[23:14] tell and my soul it shall
[23:18] compel but the prophets aren't the
[23:21] reason I'll be
[23:24] there I want to see Jesus
[23:29] at the end of the
[23:32] race I want to see
[23:36] Jesus and look on his
[23:39] face like trials will see
[23:43] nothing every pain that we
[23:47] bear I want to see
[23:51] Jesus and that's why I'll be
[23:56] there all sorrow
[24:00] Temptation
[24:02] disappointment
[24:04] frustration these things he will erase
[24:08] when on that day I look upon his
[24:13] face so I leave you with this
[24:17] song keep your chin up and move
[24:21] on and press ahead
[24:25] until the race is done
[24:30] for there's one thing for
[24:33] sure you will win if you
[24:36] wi but the race is not the
[24:40] reason why we
[24:43] run I want to see
[24:46] Jesus at the end of the
[24:49] [Music]
[24:51] race I want to see
[24:54] Jesus and look on his face
[24:59] life trials will seem
[25:02] nothing every pain that we
[25:06] bear I want to see
[25:09] Jesus that's why I'll be
[25:13] there I want to see
[25:17] Jesus that's why I'll be there
[25:28] [Music]
[26:11] it's hard to tell how far I
[26:16] wand upon this Fallen Earth
[26:20] [Music]
[26:23] Below I longed to reach the
[26:26] heavens I felt calling to
[26:29] me but just why I did not
[26:36] know I searched in vain to find the
[26:42] answers it seemed the truth could not be
[26:49] found there were so many
[26:52] saying why can't you just be happy but I
[26:56] wasn't happy on the
[27:01] ground still I believe there was an
[27:08] answer and knew the truth was something
[27:14] rare then one day truth came and found
[27:17] me and wrapped its wings around me and I
[27:22] was carried in the
[27:26] airrow free
[27:30] freom oh
[27:34] Freedom how the truth has Set Me
[27:40] Free now I'm
[27:44] flying
[27:51] higher and oh how
[27:54] far I see
[28:00] and know how far I
[28:04] see I see
[28:09] [Music]
[28:32] Till There were those who always
[28:38] question if what I found was really
[28:45] true I gave them many
[28:48] scriptures but Lord they just can't see
[28:51] it it must be hidden from their View
[28:59] I tried my best to give an
[29:04] answer just how it is I made this
[29:10] choice I did my best to tell them how my
[29:14] heart burns within
[29:17] me every time I hear that
[29:22] voice so
[29:26] freom oh
[29:31] Freedom how the word has made me
[29:37] so now I'm
[29:41] flying
[29:48] higher than I ever flown
[29:55] before then I've ever flown
[30:00] before

[31:20] [Music]
[31:22] home oh freedom
[31:27] [Music]
[31:43] oh what a life amen what a
[31:46] brother I um known brother Tim well over
[31:50] 20 years somewhere in the vicinity of 22
[31:52] 23 years
[31:54] and and uh we all knew brother at him
[31:58] and we knew him to be everybody's friend
[32:01] he was everyone's friend wonderful
[32:04] brother wonderful friend and I think
[32:07] Jason did such a marvelous job
[32:09] encapsulating his life and memories that
[32:11] we all knew and the way that we all knew
[32:14] and loved brother Tim and I'd like to
[32:17] just take a few minutes while we're
[32:18] gathered here this morning and I'd like
[32:20] to talk on the subject of life and death
[32:22] and just share a few things from the
[32:25] scripture and uh I was I'd like to read
[32:28] from John 10:10 to begin with I'm just
[32:30] going to read the second half of the
[32:32] verse Jesus is speaking and he says I
[32:35] come that they might have life that they
[32:37] might have it more
[32:39] abundantly man Jesus came that they
[32:42] might have life and have it more
[32:45] abundantly me we all knew uh brother Tim
[32:50] in this life in one capacity or another
[32:52] and our relationship was all in one way
[32:55] or another but what we all enjoyed was
[32:57] the same life it was the life that was
[33:00] encapsulated in that vessel that we knew
[33:02] the brother that we shook hands with and
[33:04] the family member that we embraced but
[33:08] within that vessel was a life and that
[33:10] life was our brother Tim and uh he was
[33:14] full of life he was a lot of fun and he
[33:16] was always a lot of fun to be with he
[33:18] was adventurous he was funny and he
[33:22] loved to make you laugh it it was
[33:24] remarked before but I like to remark
[33:26] again brother Tim could take the most
[33:28] mundane and routine of daily stories and
[33:31] make it the funniest thing you've ever
[33:32] heard in your life and if somebody else
[33:34] told that story it would be a total dud
[33:37] and a flop you tell it and then you
[33:38] would laugh and everybody look at you
[33:40] but he can take normal what we would
[33:43] call normal and make it hilarious
[33:45] because he found the humor in things he
[33:47] found the joy he found those things and
[33:50] was able to highlight the things that
[33:52] that made it
[33:53] funny amen so we all got to share in
[33:56] that and and one way or another and we
[33:58] saw too a man who was very Bound in many
[34:02] ways because of crippling arthritis that
[34:05] through the decades that he fought with
[34:06] that it bound him more and more but
[34:08] though arthritis would bind him
[34:10] physically it can never stop that Spirit
[34:13] within him from expressing life it
[34:15] couldn't stop the life from being
[34:17] manifest it was only a limitation and
[34:20] then we saw uh five months ago as he had
[34:24] the stroke how how limiting the stroke
[34:27] was he lost the ability to communicate
[34:30] with his family and there would be
[34:32] little glimpses that he would say little
[34:34] phrases but for the most part he lost
[34:36] his ability to communicate to share what
[34:38] was going on inside and so for many in
[34:41] many ways for the last five months he
[34:44] hasn't been able to express that life
[34:46] that we love so much and it was so hard
[34:48] to watch and so hard to see but I'm so
[34:52] thankful there's no limitation to him
[34:54] now there's no barrier to his expression
[34:57] all the life that was in brother Tim is
[34:59] still alive and I guarantee he's
[35:02] expressing Life as we speak the barriers
[35:07] and the bars have been removed and so
[35:10] we're thankful for
[35:12] that brother Tim's Faith was expressed
[35:15] in his songs as you've heard already
[35:17] today a couple of those before the
[35:19] service and during the slideshow amen we
[35:22] don't have to speak of his faith or
[35:24] convince you of his faith many of you
[35:26] knew it but his song portray it they
[35:28] encapsulate it and they live on his
[35:31] faith what he believed in whom he loved
[35:33] and where he placed his confidence
[35:35] continues on and we're thankful for that
[35:38] and at the request of his family we were
[35:40] able to make about a 100 copies of his
[35:42] CD they titled freedom and it's out in
[35:44] the forer and you're welcome to take one
[35:46] with you as you go so that you can
[35:48] listen to brother Tim's faith and the
[35:50] expression of the life that was within
[35:53] him as we go back to the scripture that
[35:56] I read that last half half of John 10:10
[36:00] says I come that they might have life
[36:02] that they might have it more
[36:04] abundantly and it's interesting to note
[36:07] that Jesus when he came he was speaking
[36:10] to people who were already alive but he
[36:13] came that they might have life so it's
[36:16] it's interesting because they were alive
[36:18] they were breathing they were eating
[36:19] they were walking on the earth they had
[36:21] a form of life but he came that he might
[36:23] give them life and that life more
[36:25] abundantly so the life that Jesus is
[36:28] talking about maybe is a little more
[36:30] than the life that we come to understand
[36:32] as human beings we have a certain
[36:34] Paradigm we have certain way of viewing
[36:36] things like life and death and that
[36:38] Paradigm is is it's a narrow Vision
[36:41] because it's only it's been gained
[36:43] through this life through the birth that
[36:44] we had through a mother and a father the
[36:46] years that we spent upon this Earth our
[36:48] education and the things we've
[36:49] experienced we come to understand life
[36:52] and death in one way in human terms but
[36:55] as we find in the scripture Jesus and
[36:57] the disciples they had a totally
[36:59] different concept of life and death and
[37:02] that's what I'd like to speak on a
[37:03] little bit in Genesis 2:7 says and the
[37:08] Lord God formed man of the Dust of the
[37:09] ground and breathed into his nostrils
[37:11] the breath of life and Man became a
[37:13] living Soul this is where we get our
[37:16] understanding of life upon this Earth
[37:17] and life in this Dimension and life in
[37:19] these bodies that at the breath of life
[37:22] and me this man became a living soul and
[37:24] he became animated in what we call this
[37:26] Dimension or on this Earth Earth or in
[37:28] this
[37:28] world and he was given instructions and
[37:31] we know that he failed to keep those
[37:33] instructions and and that came forth in
[37:36] in verse 17 of the same chapter but the
[37:38] tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil
[37:40] Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[37:42] that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt
[37:43] surely die so it was the first mention
[37:47] of death in this life that we understand
[37:50] that came forth when he breathed the
[37:52] breath of life into the nostrils of man
[37:55] and so there was already a promise that
[37:57] if you corrupt this way it'll bring
[38:01] death he goes on after man fell and he
[38:04] and he disobeyed the Commandments of God
[38:06] and and Jesus comes on the SE or God
[38:08] comes on the scene he begins to dish out
[38:11] the punishment the retribution and verse
[38:14] 19 of chapter 3 says in the sweat of thy
[38:16] face shalt thou eat bread till thou
[38:19] return unto the ground for out of it was
[38:20] thou taken for dust Thou Art and at the
[38:23] dust shalt thou return so we know he
[38:25] formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground
[38:27] and here he's saying conclusively that
[38:30] you were taken out of the dust and the
[38:32] dust you'll return but I'm here to say
[38:35] that the Bible gives us a more full
[38:37] picture of this life and this death
[38:39] because what's referred to here is what
[38:41] we know as mortal life what we know is
[38:44] human life what we know is this
[38:45] existence but we know that there's more
[38:48] life than this and life is much grander
[38:51] than
[38:52] this in James chapter 4 James says
[38:55] whereas you know not what shall be on on
[38:57] the tomorrow for what is your life it is
[38:59] even a vapor that appear for a little
[39:01] time and then vanisheth
[39:04] away and so we know that really at most
[39:07] we just have a handful of years upon
[39:09] this Earth in this form in this
[39:11] dimension in this life and it goes by
[39:15] too fast remember when I was young I
[39:18] used to think time dragged along but now
[39:21] standing here probably halfway or more
[39:24] than halfway through my life I realized
[39:27] time
[39:28] flies life is short it's brief as we say
[39:32] goodbye to friends that we've shared
[39:33] life with for years we realize how
[39:36] quickly it all goes away and it's like a
[39:40] vapor this word vapor is like the fog
[39:42] that lifts off the Earth and in the
[39:45] morning you can see the vapor the fog
[39:47] and but when the sun comes out very
[39:49] quickly it's dissipated it's gone and
[39:50] you can't tell where it went you can't
[39:52] see and that's the way life is in human
[39:55] speaking in human terms it's here we can
[39:58] see it but at some point it just
[40:00] vanishes away and where it is can we
[40:02] tangibly grab it and say and hold on to
[40:05] it and know where it went it just seems
[40:06] to have disappeared that's our
[40:10] perspective but I'd like to begin
[40:12] sharing another
[40:14] perspective not the Mortal but the
[40:16] immortal not the one from this world but
[40:19] the one that goes beyond this
[40:21] world the prophet of God for age begins
[40:24] to tell us something about death he
[40:26] gives us a definition which is grander
[40:28] than the one that we have in this life
[40:31] said the word death means
[40:33] separation and I'd like to just share
[40:35] with you death as separation because we
[40:37] all feel it today what we feel in the
[40:40] death of our brother Tim is separation
[40:43] we're separated from our brother we
[40:46] can't speak to him like we used to speak
[40:48] to him we can't shake his hand hug his
[40:50] neck there's a separation and that's
[40:52] part of death that's an attribute of
[40:54] death is separation and that's why we're
[40:56] g leing because we're mourning that loss
[40:59] the loss of that life and the access we
[41:01] had to that life was through the
[41:03] physical body it's the only way we could
[41:05] access the life that was inside was
[41:07] through our brother's Tabernacle and now
[41:10] that's been separated from us and the
[41:12] life has gone elsewhere and the
[41:14] Tabernacle soon will go into the ground
[41:16] fulfilling the words of the Lord in
[41:19] Genesis and and so death for us is a
[41:23] separation but death for Tim was was
[41:28] different it wasn't a separation it was
[41:31] more of a
[41:33] unification he went to unify with Saints
[41:35] who had gone on before he was birthed
[41:38] into a whole new world and he
[41:40] experienced life and a whole new level
[41:42] so for us death is one thing for him
[41:44] death was something else the prophet
[41:46] goes on to say the physical death does
[41:48] not mean that we are dead but the
[41:51] physical death that we have to go
[41:52] through here yet it is not death we're
[41:55] still in the presence of God we move
[41:56] from this this place to a closer place
[41:59] with him in his
[42:01] presence and Jesus refers to this in the
[42:04] gospels in Matthew 9 when he's going to
[42:08] to raise gyrus his daughter he's called
[42:10] upon because she's grievously sick word
[42:13] comes that she's died he enters into the
[42:15] house and Jesus says this give place for
[42:18] the maid is not dead but sleepeth and
[42:21] they laughed him to
[42:23] scorn here's Jesus the the fullness of
[42:26] the godhead bodily all the wisdom and
[42:28] the understanding of God uh formed into
[42:31] a human being and he makes a declaration
[42:34] that she's not dead they all knew she
[42:36] was dead according to their definition
[42:38] of death yeah but Jesus knew something
[42:42] more than what they knew they knew she
[42:44] not she's not dying she can't die for
[42:46] she's a child of God he says she
[42:49] sleepeth and they laughed him the scorn
[42:50] and they felt justified in their
[42:52] laughter amen because it was the narrow
[42:54] vision of humanity that gave them the
[42:56] privilege of laughing at the Lord but
[42:59] his perspective was much greater than
[43:01] theirs yeah I'd like this morning to
[43:04] take his perspective on life yeah in
[43:07] John 1111 when he gets word in John chap
[43:11] 11 that his friend Lazar is sick
[43:13] grievously sick unto death he doesn't
[43:15] move he hesitates and doesn't go then
[43:18] after a few days he tells his disciples
[43:20] our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go
[43:24] that may I wake him out of his sleep and
[43:26] his disciples totally misunderstood
[43:28] their language because they're still in
[43:29] the narrow vision of humanity and they
[43:32] say oh if he sleepeth he do well they
[43:34] thought he was resting and recovering
[43:35] from his sickness so Jesus had to
[43:38] rephrase his sentence in terminology
[43:40] they would understand he said Lazarus is
[43:42] dead but he had already said he's
[43:44] sleeping yeah because he knew Lazarus
[43:46] wasn't dead he was on his way to raise
[43:49] him from the
[43:50] dead amen so in Romans uh the Apostle
[43:54] Paul says for they that are after the
[43:57] flesh do mind the things of the flesh
[43:59] but they that are after the spirit the
[44:01] things of the spirit for to be carnally
[44:03] minded is death carnally minded does not
[44:07] mean Wicked it doesn't mean evil
[44:09] carnally minded means natural to be
[44:12] naturally minded to have the natural
[44:14] mind that we're born with and grow up
[44:16] with that natural mind that perceives
[44:18] the world a certain way that's learned
[44:20] that life is a certain thing to be
[44:22] carnally minded is death but to be
[44:24] spiritually minded is life and peace
[44:27] so we're seeing life is different than
[44:29] what we thought and death is different
[44:31] than what we thought now just to have
[44:33] the natural mind is death to have the
[44:36] spiritual mind is life and
[44:39] peace in 1 Timothy Paul says but she
[44:42] that liveth in pleasure is dead while
[44:45] she
[44:46] liveth so we can be living what we call
[44:49] living as a human being we can have
[44:51] animation in this Dimension we can be in
[44:53] a body and have a spirit and eat and
[44:55] drink and sleep and do all all the
[44:57] things we do in life but the Bible would
[44:59] consider us dead dead yet while we live
[45:04] seems very odd but it's the
[45:06] reality in Ephesians Paul says and you
[45:10] hath he quickened who were dead in
[45:12] trespasses and sins those who have been
[45:15] made alive and been born again by the
[45:17] spirit of God they were dead we were
[45:19] dead in trespasses and sins we were
[45:21] alive in the natural sense but dead in
[45:23] the spiritual sense so in one way we
[45:25] were alive but in the greater more
[45:27] profound way we were dead because death
[45:30] means separation we were separated from
[45:32] the things of God we were removed from
[45:35] understanding knowing and and communing
[45:37] with God we had a type of death in this
[45:40] what we call
[45:41] life but he's quickened us that means to
[45:44] make alive who were dead in trespasses
[45:47] and
[45:48] sins the reason brother Tim can't die is
[45:51] because he's already been made
[45:53] alive years ago when he came to the
[45:56] understand of Christ and he surrendered
[45:58] and he accepted what the Lord had done
[46:00] for him and the word that the Lord
[46:01] presented to him amen when he embraced
[46:04] that fully and by faith he was born
[46:06] again he had life life that could never
[46:09] fade away life that could never be
[46:11] terminated life that would continue on
[46:13] for
[46:14] eternity Paul goes on a few verses later
[46:17] to say but God who is rich in Mercy for
[46:19] his great love wherewith he loved us
[46:21] when we were dead in sins and ha hath
[46:24] quickened us together with Christ by
[46:26] grace are you saved and hath raised us
[46:28] up together and made us sit together in
[46:30] Heavenly places in Christ
[46:33] Jesus so we were he's speaking to people
[46:36] and of people that were very much alive
[46:39] in the dimension we call life but yet
[46:41] they were
[46:42] dead but yet being dead they were made
[46:46] alive
[46:48] Amen in Matthew 8 Jesus
[46:51] says another one of his disciples said
[46:54] unto him Lord suffer me first to go and
[46:56] bury my father father but Jesus said
[46:58] unto him follow me and let the dead bury
[47:00] their
[47:02] dead how do dead people bury dead
[47:05] people you see it's a different
[47:07] understanding of life and death the
[47:10] spiritual understanding is far beyond
[47:11] the natural understanding let the bad
[47:14] dead bury the dead in our natural
[47:16] understanding there's no way a dead man
[47:17] can take a spade in a shovel and dig a
[47:19] hole but Jesus was looking at things
[47:21] from a different Vantage Point
[47:22] altogether he said let the Dead bear
[47:24] their dead come and follow me
[47:28] even the parable he tells of the
[47:30] prodical son the son who wanted to go
[47:32] explore the world and separate from his
[47:34] father's home and and go and live
[47:36] extravagantly he gathered his
[47:38] inheritance and he went to a far country
[47:40] and he spent it lavishly until it was
[47:42] all spent and he had nothing left and in
[47:45] his despair he remembered his father and
[47:47] he came to himself and wanted to go back
[47:49] to his father's house only this time
[47:51] humbled he wanted to return as a servant
[47:54] and as he come back to his father's
[47:56] house house remember death is separation
[47:59] here's a young man who was separated
[48:00] from his father and he comes back and
[48:03] the and and he's wanting to ask his
[48:06] father just to take him back as a
[48:07] servant he wants to repent and he does
[48:09] so but the father doesn't take him back
[48:11] as a servant he takes him back as a son
[48:14] cuz he was always his son there was
[48:16] never a time that he wasn't his son but
[48:18] his son was separated and listen to what
[48:21] the father
[48:22] says the father said to his servants
[48:24] bring forth the best robe and put it on
[48:26] and put a ring on his hand and shoes on
[48:28] his feet and bring hither the fatted
[48:30] calf and kill it and let us eat and be
[48:32] marry for this my son was dead and is
[48:36] alive again he was lost and is found and
[48:40] they began to be mared so even the
[48:43] expression the father of the prodal
[48:46] expresses this is my son was dead how
[48:48] was he dead he was alive somewhere else
[48:51] he was living righteously he was
[48:53] spending the wealth that he had he he
[48:55] found himself even for Life eating would
[48:58] have eaten the slop of the pigs so he
[48:59] was alive but to the father he was dead
[49:02] because of the
[49:04] separation but now as he came back to
[49:06] the father he was no longer dead but
[49:08] he's alive again yeah amen he was always
[49:12] his son but now his son separated was
[49:16] dead but now his son returning to the
[49:18] father is
[49:20] alive oh this is Brother Tim's story
[49:23] this is my story this is your story if
[49:25] youve believed the word word of God and
[49:27] accepted the pardon of Jesus Christ and
[49:29] you you've accepted his word in fullness
[49:31] amen you were dead in sin and trespasses
[49:34] you were separated alienated from the
[49:36] things of God having a mind darkened uh
[49:38] in the ways of God Amen but but one day
[49:42] we came to ourselves and we recognize
[49:45] that we have a father a heavenly father
[49:48] and we can go back and in humility we
[49:50] recognize we were wrong and ask him if
[49:52] we could be a servant but he would never
[49:54] take a son back as a servant because he
[49:56] would only take a son back as a son and
[49:59] he took our brother Tim back as a son
[50:01] and robed him and clothed him gave him
[50:04] the
[50:05] ring and this my son that was dead is
[50:10] alive Jesus said in John 5 verily verily
[50:13] I say unto you he that beareth heareth
[50:15] my word and believeth on him that sent
[50:17] me hath everlasting life and shall not
[50:20] come into the condemnation but is past
[50:23] from Death unto life he that hear Heth
[50:27] my word and believeth on him that sent
[50:29] me hath everlasting life shows that
[50:32] there was already life inside just like
[50:35] the son was always the son but he had to
[50:37] come back to life ending the separation
[50:41] unifying again with the father from
[50:43] Death unto
[50:46] life in John 1:1 it says in the
[50:48] beginning was the word and the Word was
[50:51] with God the Word was God and the same
[50:53] was in the beginning with God and all
[50:55] things were made by him and without him
[50:57] was not anything made that was made in
[50:59] him was life and the life was the light
[51:02] of men so in this word and we we know in
[51:05] John uh 1:14 a few verses later it said
[51:09] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[51:11] among us we know that that word was
[51:13] encapsulated in the body and we know it
[51:14] is Jesus Christ so in the word there's
[51:18] life and that life is the light of men
[51:21] and Jesus Christ is the word made
[51:24] flesh this is what our brother Tim
[51:27] Found Jesus said in John 8 I am the
[51:30] light of the world he that followeth me
[51:32] shall not walk in darkness but shall
[51:35] have the light of
[51:38] Life praise God John 11 says Jesus said
[51:42] unto her I am the resurrection and the
[51:45] life he that believeth in me though he
[51:47] were dead yet shall he live and
[51:50] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[51:52] shall never die yeah believest thou this
[51:57] what a question he asked her amen he
[51:59] says uh whosoever believeth in me he
[52:02] that believeth in me though he were dead
[52:05] yet shall he live he's coming back to
[52:07] the resurrection of Lazarus but he's
[52:08] speaking more of just Lazarus he's
[52:10] speaking of you and
[52:12] I though he were dead yet shall he live
[52:16] and whosoever
[52:17] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[52:21] die Jesus was speaking to a woman I
[52:25] believe named Martha either Martha or
[52:27] Mary at this time Martha would believe
[52:29] in the Lord Jesus she would see the
[52:31] miracle she would accept him she would
[52:33] see him die she would witness to be a
[52:35] witness to his resurrection and she
[52:36] would believe very much but in that
[52:38] belief in the human sense of the word
[52:41] she would die but he made a promise who
[52:45] who liveth and believeth in me shall
[52:47] never die so that means these words
[52:50] didn't have to do with our Earthly
[52:52] existence in this Tabernacle of Flesh he
[52:54] was speaking of a much greater life than
[52:56] this life yeah because the ones he told
[52:59] that to first they would pass off the
[53:01] scene they would cease to breathe their
[53:03] existence in this Dimension it would
[53:05] terminate at some point but their life
[53:07] could never End Amen that was the
[53:09] promise the prophet says death means
[53:12] separation he only separates from our
[53:15] seeing but he's always alive this refers
[53:18] to our brother Tim he only separates
[53:20] from our seeing we we sense death is
[53:23] separation he's separated from our
[53:25] seeing but his life is not terminated
[53:28] right says he that Hearth my words and
[53:31] believeth on him that sent me has
[53:32] everlasting life we can't die we got
[53:37] eternal life eternal anything anything
[53:41] Eternal never had a beginning or an end
[53:43] so that's God's own life brother Tim had
[53:48] God's own life and that life in him led
[53:51] him back to his father's house one point
[53:54] he came to himself and he came back back
[53:57] under the preaching of the word under
[53:58] the message of the hour and he returned
[54:00] back to the father's house and unified
[54:02] with his father and he moved from Death
[54:04] unto life and now he that believeth
[54:07] liveth and believeth in him shall never
[54:10] die I'm here to say brother Tim Aaron is
[54:13] not dead but he's
[54:16] alive amen and that life that he has is
[54:19] the same life we can have if we could
[54:21] but hear his voice and respond if we
[54:24] could but hear his words and Believe on
[54:26] him that sin and if we could have the
[54:27] same faith brother Tim have we could
[54:29] have the same life that brother Tim now
[54:31] has for those who have accepted it were
[54:34] so grateful for life and when you read
[54:36] through the scriptures and you read the
[54:38] histories of Godly men you'll find that
[54:40] the disciples and the followers of
[54:42] Christ and and even The Godly Saints
[54:44] down Through the Ages they never feared
[54:46] death they come to death's door and they
[54:48] didn't back down they didn't go crying
[54:51] they didn't go afraid but they realized
[54:53] within themselves this what we call
[54:56] death death is only entrance into more
[54:58] life yeah it's only freedom from a
[55:01] barrier it's it's going Beyond a closed
[55:03] door into an open door it's busting out
[55:05] of what's Limited us amen those of us
[55:08] who've accepted Christ you know in your
[55:10] life there's limitations that come
[55:12] through living in this human flesh amen
[55:14] it's been born wrong it's been perverted
[55:16] by corruption and and now amen the
[55:19] freedom comes from baking breaking
[55:21] Beyond these barriers and moving beyond
[55:23] and every saint that came to that door
[55:25] was happy to make the step across for
[55:28] them death wasn't fearful for them death
[55:30] wasn't agonizing for them death wasn't a
[55:32] terror for them death was release yes
[55:36] it's separation yes brother Tim had a
[55:39] separation too he separated from a body
[55:42] that was tormented and Afflicted he
[55:45] separated from a body suffering the
[55:47] ravages of a stroke where he couldn't
[55:49] communicate with his
[55:50] family I think that was a wonderful
[55:53] separation yeah oh that glorious day for
[55:56] brother Timothy Aaron that last Sunday
[56:00] about just before 3:00 p.m. in the
[56:02] afternoon as we would count time our
[56:04] brother made the most Glorious Step he's
[56:06] made thus far when he had death
[56:10] separation from this life into what he
[56:12] had always longed for yeah what a
[56:15] wonderful death what a glorious death
[56:17] what a magnificent death how thankful he
[56:19] was for his
[56:22] separation
[56:23] amen oh I hope we're longing for our
[56:26] separation yeah to separate from this
[56:29] body of death that's what Paul said who
[56:31] can separate me from this body of death
[56:34] there's coming a separation and I'm
[56:35] looking forward to it our separation
[56:38] whether it comes by the change in the
[56:40] body and being caught in the air or we
[56:41] must go by the grave like our brother
[56:43] our separation will only be a separation
[56:46] from what's terminal what's temporary
[56:49] what's hazardous it'll be a glorious
[56:52] separation for us who believe we will
[56:54] separate from this by death but it will
[56:57] also be for us a a unification not a
[57:00] separation yeah we will come to join the
[57:03] Saints of old and we will live
[57:05] gloriously with them we'll be unified
[57:07] once again with brother
[57:09] Tim yes amen for us we can also have a
[57:13] glorious
[57:14] separation if we would separate now from
[57:17] our old ways and our old life and our
[57:19] old thinking our mind that has been
[57:21] darkened and polluted by corruption if
[57:23] we'll separate by means of death not of
[57:26] ceasing to breathe or walk but if we'll
[57:28] die to ourselves die to our selfishness
[57:31] our pride die to our own ideas and our
[57:33] own ideology our own misconceptions of
[57:37] God if we'll die to oursel and accept
[57:39] God's provided way his voice in this day
[57:41] we can move also from death into life
[57:44] and believe his word and never die
[57:47] yeah amen what an opportunity we
[57:52] have in 2 Corinthians 5 verse 1 it says
[57:56] for we know that if our Earthly House of
[57:59] this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[58:01] building of God a house not made with
[58:03] hands Eternal in the heavens guess who's
[58:07] already moved into that house yeah our
[58:11] precious brother and I'm so
[58:14] grateful he
[58:16] separated to find more life so thankful
[58:20] he's moved into that body that God had
[58:22] prepared for him that's Eternal in the
[58:25] heavens
[58:27] further down in verse 8 it says we are
[58:28] confident I say and willing rather to be
[58:32] absent from the body and to be present
[58:35] with the
[58:37] Lord prophet of God also told us this
[58:40] was such a
[58:42] consolation he said you're going to find
[58:44] out one of these days that when you go
[58:46] to heaven you don't fly off somewhere
[58:48] else you're still right here too just in
[58:51] another dimension faster than this right
[58:54] through this room he starts to describe
[58:56] TV and we know now by Wi-Fi and internet
[58:59] it's all travel another world is moving
[59:01] within this world it's just traveling at
[59:02] a speed we can't comprehend unless we
[59:04] have a way to dial into
[59:06] it but Heaven's right here too the
[59:10] Saints are here the Glorious Realms of
[59:12] Eternity it's all around us friends it's
[59:14] just moving at a different speed but God
[59:17] has given us a portal he's given us a
[59:19] way that we can have a a tuning device a
[59:23] router you should say we could say or or
[59:25] a cell phone or some way we can pick up
[59:27] the signal amen and the mechanism he
[59:29] uses his word and his word's been
[59:31] restored in the end time and and that
[59:33] word can bring his spirit and that
[59:34] Spirit becomes the thing that Tunes the
[59:36] radio frequency in and we can pick up
[59:38] the message there's life here there's
[59:41] life all around us there's more life
[59:43] here than death amen for eternal life is
[59:45] present the Heavenly realm is
[59:47] here we're just separated from it in a
[59:51] way because of these
[59:53] bodies but one day we'll separate from
[59:56] these bodies we may call it death and
[59:59] death might mean many things to many
[1:00:00] people but with a Heavenly
[1:00:03] perspective death is a glorious thing
[1:00:06] when we died to
[1:00:08] ourselves took up our cross and followed
[1:00:11] him we found life when we died in this
[1:00:15] natural man and he ceased to breathe and
[1:00:17] we relay the rest we went on to a
[1:00:19] Heavenly prize a body prepared for us in
[1:00:23] the
[1:00:24] heavens from that
[1:00:26] perspective death is wonderful death is
[1:00:29] a blessing death is our
[1:00:33] privilege we who remain we feel death
[1:00:37] still as a
[1:00:38] sting a sting of separation of
[1:00:42] loss where we can no longer hold our
[1:00:45] brother touch him speak to
[1:00:47] him but I'm so thankful that we had a
[1:00:50] prophet in this day who was privileged
[1:00:52] to go beyond the curtain of time and see
[1:00:54] the saints that have passed on
[1:00:56] when he went on he found them in
[1:00:58] bodies very much looking human ones that
[1:01:01] he could touch and hug and embrace and
[1:01:03] speak to he it was such a consolation to
[1:01:06] him to find out that we went we weren't
[1:01:07] a vapor or a mist or some floating
[1:01:10] Spirit but that we were in a form like
[1:01:12] we were on Earth and only perfect and
[1:01:14] beautiful at the peak of humanity amen
[1:01:17] and age somewhere between 19 and 21
[1:01:20] years old at the peak of strength and
[1:01:22] glorious and young and fresh and in
[1:01:24] Perfection and having sweet communion
[1:01:26] and fellowship where there was life only
[1:01:28] life where there was love only love
[1:01:30] where there was light only
[1:01:33] light oh I'm so glad we've gotten this
[1:01:36] picture for when Paul went there was
[1:01:38] things he couldn't say but this brother
[1:01:40] went and he could come back and tell us
[1:01:41] what he
[1:01:42] saw and give us such a glorious
[1:01:45] consolation in hours like this but also
[1:01:47] such an anticipation in us for our time
[1:01:51] of
[1:01:52] Separation God is so good so thank
[1:01:55] thankful to know where brother Tim
[1:01:58] is we feel this thing of Separation we
[1:02:01] will in the days and weeks and months
[1:02:04] that come it'll hit us like waves as we
[1:02:07] remember hear a song see a picture but
[1:02:11] remember that's only temporal that's
[1:02:14] only Earthly that's only in this
[1:02:16] dimension in these parameters of time
[1:02:19] that is going to be broken open one day
[1:02:21] amen the pain that we feel may it just
[1:02:23] cause us to strive that much more to see
[1:02:26] again to fight for the cause to keep
[1:02:29] pressing on for our great
[1:02:32] reunion I'd like to conclude with this
[1:02:35] verse of scripture from Brother Paul as
[1:02:37] he writes to Timothy this is at his
[1:02:40] point of death he knows that he's
[1:02:41] leaving this world says for I am ready
[1:02:45] to be offered and the time of my
[1:02:48] departure is at hand I have fought a
[1:02:51] good fight I have finished my course I
[1:02:53] have kept the faith henceforth there is
[1:02:55] laid up for me a crown of righteousness
[1:02:57] with the Lord the righteous judge who
[1:03:00] the righteous judge shall give me at
[1:03:01] that day and not to me only but unto all
[1:03:05] them also that love his
[1:03:09] appearing man what a reward that is
[1:03:12] coming to us
[1:03:14] all men I'd like to conclude in a word
[1:03:18] of prayer after I'm conclude the prayer
[1:03:21] brother Ashton crook is going to sing a
[1:03:23] song a song that brother Tim had written
[1:03:26] but I'd like for us all just bow our
[1:03:28] heads for just a
[1:03:32] moment and I'd like to say just before
[1:03:34] we pray
[1:03:35] that this life that we know is life it's
[1:03:39] a vapor it's a
[1:03:40] Mist we're thankful for the joys that we
[1:03:43] have in this life the family the
[1:03:45] friendships the laughter the experiences
[1:03:47] the adventures and brother Tim enjoyed
[1:03:49] them all more than
[1:03:51] anyone but they will all fade away one
[1:03:54] day
[1:03:55] and true life will break forth true life
[1:03:59] the life that feeds all of the joy and
[1:04:01] all of the pleasure all of the goodness
[1:04:03] that we experience but is so much
[1:04:05] greater than the limitation of this
[1:04:08] human
[1:04:09] life let us not just live to have some
[1:04:13] fun in the Box in parameters of birth
[1:04:16] and death natural
[1:04:18] life but let us strive to have real life
[1:04:23] true life eternal life
[1:04:27] as our heads are bowed let's just join
[1:04:29] in prayer together and commit ourselves
[1:04:31] to the Lord dear heavenly
[1:04:34] father I thank you Lord Jesus that you
[1:04:37] came and you taught us what life really
[1:04:40] is you taught us what death really is so
[1:04:43] that we can Lord be lifted above and
[1:04:47] beyond the parameters of our limitations
[1:04:50] of humanity that we could see things
[1:04:52] more as you see them so that we wouldn't
[1:04:56] fear This Thing Called Death we learn to
[1:04:59] embrace it that we would not waste this
[1:05:03] thing called life but that we' use it
[1:05:06] for your
[1:05:07] glory that in this natural life we would
[1:05:11] surrender it and die to take up our
[1:05:13] cross to crucify ourselves for your sake
[1:05:17] that we might find true life that we can
[1:05:20] have death so that we can come to life
[1:05:23] so that we'll never die
[1:05:26] thank you God for your word I pray that
[1:05:28] it strike the hearts of your children
[1:05:31] may encourage us to keep pressing on for
[1:05:34] life is worth fighting for life is worth
[1:05:36] striving for that we've received the
[1:05:39] life which is the light of men God for
[1:05:42] those who have not yet died to self
[1:05:45] surrendered this Natural Life in
[1:05:47] exchange for eternal life I pray that
[1:05:50] you'd prick their hearts now that you'd
[1:05:52] begin working in them and give them the
[1:05:54] process Lord call them let them hear
[1:05:56] their father calling may as the prodical
[1:05:59] son did may they come to themselves Lord
[1:06:02] and realize what life really is and Lord
[1:06:06] may they return back to your house
[1:06:08] humble
[1:06:09] broken understanding are failures and
[1:06:13] may they find you a loving father
[1:06:15] willing to take a son back as a son to
[1:06:19] wash and robe and cleanse and your own
[1:06:22] righteousness with your own life and
[1:06:23] give us your own Rewards God may that be
[1:06:26] our
[1:06:28] experience God if time continues to go
[1:06:31] for decades more many of us will have to
[1:06:34] pass through the same gate our brother
[1:06:35] Tim passed through May we do so with
[1:06:38] joyful expectation stepping from this
[1:06:41] life to a one that's far
[1:06:43] greater God those of us who remain Lord
[1:06:47] to the finality of your coming where
[1:06:49] Lord we see the saints that are risen
[1:06:51] and our new bodies materialize around
[1:06:53] this one may we ever pressed towards
[1:06:56] true life may we never fear what is just
[1:06:59] temporary death and we love you we ask
[1:07:03] your blessings Lord change us make us
[1:07:06] live a life worthy of your gospel we
[1:07:08] pray in Jesus Christ's name
[1:07:14] amen wanted to say something real quick
[1:07:17] I the pleasure of knowing Tim not as
[1:07:20] just a friend but also as a patient came
[1:07:22] in to see me and and one of my favorite
[1:07:24] things about when he would come in to
[1:07:25] see me was when need to give me a hug
[1:07:28] Tim erant hugs were always very very
[1:07:29] special it you know when you're 6'4
[1:07:32] hugging somebody who is significantly
[1:07:34] shorter than you it fits differently it
[1:07:37] kind of feels like hugging one of your
[1:07:38] own kids but he gave the best hugs and I
[1:07:42] will always miss Timar hugs but I know
[1:07:44] that one day I'll I'll get to hug him
