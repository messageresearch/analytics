[15:03] everybody that we have communion and
[15:05] feet washing this afternoon so we'll
[15:07] meet back here this afternoon for that
[15:11] when I read Genesis chapter 32
[15:16] let's read one verse while we're
[15:18] standing Genesis chapter 32 and verse
[15:21] 30.
[15:25] and Jacob called the name of the place
[15:28] pineal for I have seen God face to face
[15:32] in my life is preserved amen God bless
[15:36] you as you take your seats
[15:39] man we're going to take this for a
[15:42] subject today Lord willing and speak on
[15:44] pineal and that'll be our title pineal
[15:47] but before we do that I want to make a
[15:49] couple of announcements about the
[15:51] holiday schedule coming up uh Christmas
[15:54] falls on a Sunday this year and when
[15:57] that happened six years ago 2016 we had
[16:00] an evening service and and it worked out
[16:03] quite well and and so I thought that
[16:06] we'd probably just keep the same format
[16:07] and do the same thing but I've come to
[16:09] find out that it's actually not working
[16:10] well for a lot of the congregations so
[16:12] we're going to change it back to our
[16:14] regular Sunday morning service time at
[16:16] 10 30. so on Christmas day we're going
[16:18] to have a regular a regular time our
[16:20] regular service at 10 30 in the morning
[16:22] but there'll be no Sunday school some of
[16:25] the teachers won't be available so I'm
[16:28] I'm sorry for that schedule change it
[16:29] came out on the schedule at 4 pm and
[16:32] then I I heard word that it was going to
[16:33] affect a lot of people and and so I
[16:35] talked to the deacons and it felt like
[16:37] having in the morning probably will work
[16:39] the best for my most people and that
[16:41] being said this is not that this is that
[16:44] we're having a service at regular time
[16:46] but we understand if you have
[16:47] obligations you have things that you're
[16:49] doing you have family gatherings there's
[16:51] some people that only see some of their
[16:52] family one time a year there's some
[16:55] things that you have to do so we
[16:56] understand that that's if you're
[16:57] available and you can make it please
[16:59] don't feel obligated but we're going to
[17:01] have the service here for those who are
[17:03] able to make it also New Year's Day
[17:05] falls on a Sunday as well one week later
[17:07] so we will not be having a watch Night
[17:09] Service this year just our regular
[17:11] Sunday morning service on New Year's Day
[17:14] and we won't have communion that day
[17:16] we'll we'll postpone until February and
[17:18] pick up the regular schedule in February
[17:21] so that'll be those two Services
[17:23] Christmas Day at regular time and New
[17:25] Year's Day at regular time so if that
[17:28] inconveniences anybody I'm sorry God
[17:30] bless you we love you amen but we
[17:34] understand I mean there's some things
[17:35] there's some obligations some plans have
[17:37] been made made a long time in advance
[17:39] and some of them those plans with
[17:40] inconvenience a lot of other family
[17:42] members and those who won't understand
[17:43] and don't believe so do as the Lord
[17:46] leads you and do what you need to do and
[17:48] we all understand but we're going to
[17:49] have the service for those who are
[17:50] available and those who would like to
[17:52] gather
[17:53] amen so let's get back to our subject
[17:56] here on pineal we know the story well of
[18:00] Jacob and I was going back over the last
[18:03] week and I was just meditating on the
[18:05] things that were preached here during
[18:06] the Thanksgiving meters meetings from
[18:08] Brother Daniel and from Brother Alistair
[18:10] and I was meditating on this subject and
[18:12] I was thinking on brother alistair's
[18:14] service from Sunday morning
[18:16] and this just kept stirring in my heart
[18:18] so I started looking at it and I just
[18:20] wanted to share some things with you out
[18:22] of this and in verse 30 we read it said
[18:25] and Jacob called the name of the place
[18:27] Penny elf for I have seen God face to
[18:29] face and my life is preserved and and so
[18:33] to get background on the story we know
[18:35] that Jacob through his own uh satility
[18:39] his own uh ways of of deception had
[18:44] gotten the birthright and he had also
[18:46] gotten the blessing with the help of his
[18:48] mom and then Esau his brother hated him
[18:51] and despised him and wanted to kill him
[18:53] and he ran away and he ran to Heron and
[18:55] and and there he got two wives and a
[18:59] couple concubines and children and he
[19:01] was coming back into the land by the
[19:02] direction of God and brother van tells
[19:05] us you know he fell into trouble there
[19:06] he pulled tricks you know over his
[19:09] family on this side he pulled some
[19:11] tricks on Laban in that side and the
[19:13] tricks were catching up with him now
[19:15] he's in a place where he was stuck in
[19:17] between amen it was in between Esau who
[19:19] he had cheated Laban who he pulled some
[19:22] stunts with and Laban was coming after
[19:24] him and Esau was on this side and he got
[19:26] into a fix he got into a pickle and
[19:29] that's when God came to him
[19:31] I think it's so amazing that that God
[19:34] knows right where we're at amen we feel
[19:36] like sometimes things are out of control
[19:38] things sometimes like ah we can't find
[19:41] our way sometimes out of the
[19:42] circumstances but God always knows
[19:44] exactly where we are and he knew where
[19:47] Jacob was he never lost sight of Jacob
[19:49] it threw it on and we know Jacob had
[19:52] some things that he had to learn I want
[19:54] to back up to Genesis 28 and I just want
[19:56] to read a portion out of Genesis 28.
[19:58] this is as Jacob is fleeing he's running
[20:01] away from Esau he's going up to his uh
[20:05] his mother's family's place and and
[20:08] Syria and so this is uh we'll just read
[20:12] it here in Genesis 28 and verse 10.
[20:17] and Jacob went out from Beersheba and
[20:20] went toward Heron so he's leaving he's
[20:23] fleeing from the face of his song
[20:26] and he lighted upon a certain place and
[20:28] he tarried there all night because the
[20:30] sun was set and he took of the stones of
[20:32] that place and put them for his pillows
[20:35] and lay down in that place to sleep and
[20:38] he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on
[20:40] the earth and the top of it reached to
[20:42] heaven and behold the angels of God
[20:44] ascended and descended on him and behold
[20:47] the Lord stood above it and said I am
[20:49] the Lord God of Abraham thy father and
[20:52] the god of Isaac the land wherein thou
[20:54] liest to thee will I give it and to thy
[20:57] seed and thy seed shall be as the dust
[21:00] of the earth and thou shalt spread
[21:01] abroad to the west and to the East and
[21:03] to the north and to the South and indeed
[21:06] in thy seed shall all the families of
[21:09] the earth be blessed and behold I am
[21:11] with thee and will keep thee in all
[21:13] places whether thou goest and will bring
[21:15] thee again unto this land for I will not
[21:18] leave thee until I have done that which
[21:20] I have spoke to thee of
[21:22] what a promise
[21:24] he's running away from Esau he had
[21:26] gotten the birthright he had gotten the
[21:29] blessing and he got them both through
[21:31] some trickery I mean he got him I mean
[21:33] it doesn't seem like the most upstanding
[21:35] way to get the the things that he has
[21:38] and it it seems to me like God would
[21:42] correct him and God come to him in a
[21:44] dream and would say how dare you do that
[21:46] to your brother and when he was in need
[21:47] and you took advantage of his need and
[21:49] how dare you do this with your father
[21:51] and all of these things but God that's
[21:53] not how God speaks to Jacob because the
[21:56] promises with Jacob Jacob is the seed
[21:58] amen God knows who he is Jacob doesn't
[22:01] fully understand who he is but God knows
[22:03] who he is
[22:04] and you think God would come down and
[22:06] chasing him and correct him he know God
[22:08] knows he's going to get us chastening
[22:10] he's going to go to laban's house and
[22:11] laban's going to pull a few stunts too
[22:13] amen so he's going to get what what he
[22:16] needs for correction but God is coming
[22:18] down to confirm the promise the promise
[22:20] is with you that which was the Abraham
[22:22] and that which with his Isaac that now
[22:24] is with you and he makes a promise he
[22:27] said thy seed it shall spread out from
[22:29] the West to the north to the South to
[22:31] the east he said I I want to read this
[22:33] again he said
[22:35] uh
[22:37] and behold verse 15 I am with thee and
[22:40] will keep thee in all places whether
[22:41] thou ghost and will bring thee again to
[22:43] this land for I will not leave thee
[22:45] until I have done that which I have
[22:46] spoken to thee of God makes a promise to
[22:50] Jacob and that promise is solid and sure
[22:53] I will be with you wherever I will bring
[22:56] you back and I will confirm this word
[22:58] that I promised to you
[23:00] that's as solid as solid can be Jacob
[23:02] can get up from there and know
[23:04] everything is under control I'm going to
[23:06] be fine and God will keep his word but
[23:09] Jacob had to learn some things about God
[23:11] first and look at Jacob's answer as
[23:14] response when he wakes up verse 16.
[23:17] and Jacob awoke out of his sleep and he
[23:20] said surely the Lord is in this place
[23:22] and I knew it not and he was afraid and
[23:25] said how Dreadful is this place this is
[23:28] none other but the house of God and this
[23:30] is the Gate of Heaven and Jacob rose up
[23:33] early in the morning and took the stone
[23:34] that he had put for his pillows and set
[23:37] it up for a pillar and poured oil upon
[23:40] the top of it and he called the name of
[23:42] that place Bethel but the name of that
[23:44] city was called lose at the first
[23:47] and Jacob vowed a vow saying if look at
[23:51] this word if
[23:53] if God will be with me
[23:56] what do you mean if God already promised
[24:00] Jacob is still immature in his walk with
[24:03] God he's still he's not certain of God
[24:06] God come to him in dream and made this
[24:08] promise he wakes up and he says if God
[24:11] and and he knows listen Jacob in this
[24:14] place he knows the stories he knows the
[24:16] histories he knows his family history he
[24:19] knows about what God did for Abraham he
[24:20] knows about what God did for Isaac he
[24:22] knows the promise to Abraham he knows
[24:25] he's in line for that promise God this
[24:27] dream come according to the word of God
[24:29] to confirm to him that you're in the
[24:31] line I'm still gone I remember my
[24:34] promise and I will keep it and he wakes
[24:36] up and he says if God
[24:38] [Music]
[24:39] if God will be with me and will keep me
[24:42] in this way that I go and will give me
[24:45] bread to eat and raim it to put on so
[24:47] that I come again to my father's house
[24:49] in peace then shall the Lord be my God
[24:54] and this Stone which I have set for a
[24:55] pillar shall be God's house and of all
[24:58] that thou shalt give me I will surely
[25:00] give the tenth unto thee
[25:03] he is still making deals
[25:07] he is he has not lost his old nature his
[25:10] old thinking his own way he still is
[25:13] making a deal that that that that if God
[25:17] does this and if God keeps me and if God
[25:19] gives me bread and Raymond and if God
[25:21] brings me back in peace then the Lord
[25:24] will be my God and then this house this
[25:27] Stone I set up will be the house of God
[25:29] and I will give him a tenth if God you
[25:32] keep your deal I'll give you a tenth
[25:36] my goodness but you know this is so much
[25:40] the mentality of Christianity in our day
[25:43] I mean you you they may not say it this
[25:47] way this may not be the terms that are
[25:49] used if God will do this and if God will
[25:51] do that he'll be my God and I'll and
[25:54] I'll serve him with everything I have no
[25:56] that's not what they say it's when
[25:58] things don't go right what comes out of
[25:59] their mouth shows that they had the same
[26:01] mentality amen you ask him when did you
[26:04] lose confidence well I prayed and it
[26:05] didn't work or I went up for healing and
[26:07] it didn't work or I tried to live the
[26:09] message and it didn't work amen it shows
[26:12] this same exact mentality
[26:14] or the same mindset if God will do this
[26:18] then the Lord will be my God and I'll
[26:20] serve him and I'll give him a tithe
[26:22] because they walk away when it doesn't
[26:24] work
[26:26] they lose confidence when the prayer is
[26:28] not answered when they don't see the
[26:30] word working when they don't see things
[26:31] changing amen they walk away showing
[26:34] that they had Jacob's mentality about
[26:37] serving God if God will then I will
[26:44] but the the mentality has to change we
[26:47] have to come to the place in maturity
[26:49] where we meet God face to face and we
[26:51] know if God said he will he will amen it
[26:54] doesn't matter what it looks like it
[26:56] doesn't matter what I go through it
[26:57] doesn't matter how long it takes it
[26:59] doesn't matter the circumstance if God
[27:01] said he will he will and I'll stay right
[27:04] here until he does
[27:06] that's a total different chain that's a
[27:08] change that comes when we meet God face
[27:10] to face
[27:11] so before he had met God face to face
[27:14] god listen he he in in pineal he meets
[27:18] God he wrestles this is when he wrestles
[27:20] with the angel of the Lord amen and and
[27:22] we're going to get into that but before
[27:24] he come to that he was he was in the
[27:27] message
[27:28] he was in church he he was a grandson of
[27:31] Abraham a son of Isaac he saw the wells
[27:34] that were dug the altars that were made
[27:36] the worship the sacrifices the stories
[27:39] he knew about God calling his
[27:41] grandfather he knew about his father
[27:43] being the sacrificed and laid on the
[27:45] Altar and he knew the promise and they
[27:47] knew all of these things but yet he's
[27:50] got a he's got a uh uh a deal-making
[27:54] spirit with God
[27:56] oh I don't want to have a deal-making
[27:57] spirit with God God is God what he says
[28:00] is true amen
[28:02] I don't want to hinge anything that I'll
[28:04] do based off what he'll do amen I'm
[28:06] going to serve you with all my heart
[28:08] he's God Amen his word is true I'm not
[28:11] going to say if he will and if he will
[28:13] if he will then I'll bring a tithe
[28:19] then I'll come to church and then I'll
[28:21] serve God and then I'll believe the
[28:23] message and then I'll do this and then
[28:25] I'll and then I'll honor his word and
[28:27] then I'll no no no no no no that's
[28:30] that's an immature walk
[28:33] so that's where Jacob was on his way out
[28:36] and we know that he's got to get knocked
[28:38] around a little bit he he got he got to
[28:41] get deceived by his father-in-law and he
[28:43] was given the older daughter instead of
[28:45] the one that he desired and then he has
[28:47] to work an extra seven years for the one
[28:49] for the original deal and and all of
[28:52] these things and Laban changes his wages
[28:54] 10 times but he tries to trick Laban and
[28:57] get the best cattle and I mean he's just
[29:00] it's tis for Tat he's in trouble and and
[29:03] you know what he's a child of God he's
[29:05] seed of God the promises with him he has
[29:08] the birthright God's already said you're
[29:10] the one and wherever you go I'm with you
[29:12] in the middle of his trickery and all of
[29:14] his ups and downs and all of his
[29:15] deception God's still with him
[29:18] he's still a child of God and he's still
[29:21] the seed of God the chosen of God and
[29:22] the lineage and the promises are all
[29:24] still resting with him
[29:27] and it's amazing that that Jacob is is
[29:30] is is so confident he's so
[29:33] self-confident it seems like in this
[29:36] ability to to be a deceiver a supplanter
[29:39] that's his name I mean it worked with
[29:41] his brother and it worked with his
[29:43] father and now in laban's house Laban
[29:45] pulls one on him but then he's going to
[29:46] pull one on Laban and get the cattle and
[29:48] and all of this stuff and and then you
[29:51] know he goes to talk to his wives when
[29:53] it's time to leave the Lord tells him
[29:54] it's time to go and
[29:56] he talks to his wives and he says you
[29:58] know the the you know your father's
[30:01] changed my wages these 10 times and but
[30:03] the Lord has blessed me all the best
[30:05] cattle if he said ring straight the the
[30:07] best would be ring strict if he said
[30:09] spotted the best would be spotted and
[30:11] all came to me and and and the Lord
[30:14] blessed me and and Jacob is he's a
[30:16] supplanter amen he's gaining through
[30:18] whatever means he can gain not realizing
[30:21] that the reason he's got the best flocks
[30:23] is because of the blessing from his
[30:25] father Isaac when he stole the blessing
[30:28] and he says let the fat of the land and
[30:30] the corner of the land be upon you
[30:32] it wasn't all his little trickery that
[30:34] was working for him it was the blessing
[30:36] that the father gave
[30:40] you know
[30:42] sometimes we can be wise in ourselves
[30:46] we think we've done something in my hard
[30:49] work and my planning and and my this and
[30:52] my that and I've got a living and I've
[30:54] got a business and I've saved up money
[30:56] and look at the house I built and blah
[30:58] blah blah blah blah and you don't know
[31:00] it's the blessing that's on your life
[31:02] because of who you are it's not your
[31:04] wisdom it's not your strength it's not
[31:06] all the things that you've done it's not
[31:08] because you know I was faithful and
[31:10] loyal who made you faithful and loyal
[31:13] I advanced in work and I studied hard
[31:17] and then you know what I believe in
[31:19] doing the best if you put your hand to
[31:21] the plow amen then then put your hand to
[31:23] the plow and don't turn back whatever
[31:25] God gives you to do do it the best of
[31:27] your ability but understand it's not
[31:29] your ability that's getting you anywhere
[31:31] it's the grace of God
[31:32] [Applause]
[31:35] and so we we have a Jacob mentality When
[31:39] We're Young in the Lord and we've grown
[31:41] up maybe understanding Abraham and Isaac
[31:44] and living with them and but we still
[31:46] got this goofy self-confidence thinking
[31:49] I can do this and I can make a deal and
[31:51] I can work this and I can get you can't
[31:54] do anything and it's not you doing
[31:55] anything anyways amen the blessing of
[31:58] God is on your life if you were raised
[32:00] by Godly Parents who made sacrifices for
[32:02] this message and surrender it all to
[32:04] stay true to the word there's a blessing
[32:06] that's flowing out into your life it's
[32:08] not your studies it's not your ability
[32:10] it's not your hard work it is God
[32:12] pouring out a blessing on you
[32:15] and when you get too confident in all
[32:17] this self
[32:18] you're setting yourself up for a trap
[32:23] so Jacob all those blessings of Jacob
[32:26] God said I'll be with you
[32:29] wherever you go
[32:31] it wasn't Jacob it was God
[32:35] but he was looking to his ability he was
[32:38] with effort trying to gain trying to
[32:41] preserve himself trying to take care of
[32:43] himself when he didn't have to God said
[32:46] he would
[32:48] God already said he would take care of
[32:49] him and watch out for him and bring him
[32:51] back in peace
[32:53] so
[32:55] we understand
[32:57] this is where Jacob is this is his
[33:00] mentality this has been his life this is
[33:02] how he's coming back into the land and
[33:05] he's went through trouble and and Laban
[33:07] has troubled him and the sons of Laban
[33:09] have spoke against him and now he flees
[33:12] and it's not even straightforward in
[33:14] this conversation with labor and he
[33:16] sneaks out and takes everything and he
[33:17] runs away and Laban catches up with him
[33:20] and and God speaks to Laban and tells
[33:24] him don't touch him
[33:26] if it wasn't for that Jacob would have
[33:28] been in trouble all his little trickery
[33:30] wouldn't have helped him any
[33:32] all of his plans and all all of his
[33:34] strength and all of his abilities
[33:36] wouldn't have helped him many it was God
[33:37] who helped him
[33:39] it was God who went to labor and said
[33:41] don't touch him don't harm him don't do
[33:44] anything if it wasn't for that what was
[33:46] Jacob going to do amen so so this is how
[33:49] he's returning to the land now let's go
[33:51] back to chapter 32.
[33:54] and look at verse 9.
[34:01] Genesis 32 and verse 9.
[34:04] and Jacob said o God of My Father
[34:06] Abraham and God of my father Isaac the
[34:10] Lord which said unto me return unto thy
[34:12] country and do thy Kindred and I will
[34:14] deal well with thee
[34:16] I'm not worthy of the least of all the
[34:18] mercies and of the truth which thou has
[34:20] showed unto thy servant for with my
[34:22] staff I passed over Jordan now I am
[34:24] become two bands
[34:26] deliver me I pray thee from the hand of
[34:28] my brother from the hand of Esau for I
[34:32] fear Him lest he will come and smite me
[34:34] and the mother with children
[34:37] so here's Esau returning to the land
[34:39] coming back into the promise in which he
[34:43] is the heir of and he's moving back into
[34:45] this but he gets word that Esau's coming
[34:47] with 400 men and now he's fearful when
[34:51] he cries out to God and he says oh god
[34:53] of My Father Abraham and God of my
[34:56] father Isaac amen it's wonderful that he
[34:59] knows the god of his father Abraham and
[35:01] the god of of Isaac but this God has got
[35:04] to become his God
[35:06] there's got to be a change in Jacob
[35:09] where it's not just amen the the god of
[35:11] My Father Abraham the god of my father
[35:14] Isaac The God Who delivered this and The
[35:16] God Who did many works and the God who
[35:18] worked in the ministry of brother
[35:19] Branham and God who works in this
[35:21] brother or that brother but there needs
[35:22] to be a realization that this is now my
[35:26] God Amen you're my God my God my
[35:28] personal God my father
[35:31] and so now he's asking for help because
[35:33] he's saying uh uh I fear Him deliver me
[35:36] from the hand of Esau for I fear him
[35:38] he's afraid of Esau because he comes
[35:41] into a situation that he cannot
[35:43] manipulate no deception is going to work
[35:46] what he's trying to do is he's trying
[35:47] the path of appeasement he's trying to
[35:49] send down droves and give gifts and and
[35:52] offerings unto Esau and he's trying to
[35:54] hide out and keep himself distance from
[35:56] Esau so that Esau will see though the
[35:59] droves and all the gifts and then he'll
[36:01] see the wives and then he'll see the
[36:02] children and then he'll see Jacob last
[36:04] and hopefully by then he'll be appeased
[36:07] and his wrath will be softened and he
[36:09] won't kill Jacob Jacob's terrified he's
[36:11] he's trying again to protect himself
[36:15] by appeasing his brother
[36:18] that's all he has is his own efforts now
[36:21] let's get get into this story a little
[36:24] deeper let's look at verse 13.
[36:27] and he launched there that same night he
[36:29] took of that which came to his hand a
[36:31] present for Esau his brother
[36:33] 200 she goats and 20 he goes 200 U's and
[36:37] 20 Rams 30 milk milk camels with their
[36:41] Colts 40 kind and ten Bulls 20 she asses
[36:45] and tenfolds and he delivered them into
[36:47] the hand of his servants every drove by
[36:49] themselves and said unto his servants
[36:50] pass over before me but put a space
[36:52] between drove and drove and he commanded
[36:56] the foremost saying when Esau my brother
[36:58] meeteth thee and asketh thee saying
[37:00] who's art thou and whether goeth thou
[37:02] and whose are these before thee then
[37:05] Thou shalt say they be thy servant
[37:07] Jacobs it is a present unto my Lord Esau
[37:10] and behold also he is behind us
[37:13] and so commanded he the second and the
[37:15] third and all the following followed the
[37:17] drove saying on this manner shall ye
[37:19] speak unto Esau when you find him
[37:22] and say ye moreover Behold thy servant
[37:24] Jacob is behind us for he said I am I
[37:27] will appease him with the present that
[37:30] goeth before me and afterward I will see
[37:32] his face per Adventure he will accept
[37:34] will accept of me
[37:36] so went to present over before him and
[37:39] himself lodged that night in the company
[37:41] and he rose up that night and took his
[37:44] two wives and his two women servants and
[37:46] his 11 sons and passed over the fort at
[37:48] j-bog and he took them and sent them
[37:51] over the brook and said and sent over
[37:53] that he had and Jacob was left alone and
[37:56] there Wrestled a man with him until the
[37:58] breaking of the day and when he saw that
[38:01] he prevailed not against him he touched
[38:03] the hollow of his thigh and the hollow
[38:05] of Jacob's thigh was out of joint
[38:08] the hollow I mean if Jacob sty was out
[38:10] of joint as he wrestled with him and he
[38:13] said let me go for the day breakth and
[38:15] he said I will not let thee go except
[38:17] thou bless me and he said unto him what
[38:19] is thy name and he said Jacob and he
[38:23] and he said thy name shall be called No
[38:26] More Jacob but Israel for as a prince
[38:30] hast thou power with God and with men
[38:32] and Hast prevailed and Jacob asked him
[38:35] and said tell me I pray thee thy name
[38:37] and he said wherefore is it that thou
[38:39] thus asked after my name and he blessed
[38:42] him there and Jacob called the name of
[38:45] the place pineal for I have seen God
[38:47] face to face and my life is preserved
[38:50] and as he passed over pinuel the sun
[38:53] rose upon him and he halted upon his
[38:56] time therefore the children of Israel
[38:58] eaten out of the sinu which shrank which
[39:00] is upon the hollow of the thigh until
[39:02] this day because he touched the hollow
[39:04] of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that
[39:07] shrank
[39:08] so now we see he's a he's fearful and in
[39:11] the night he's in the company but in the
[39:13] night he's nervous and he gets up and he
[39:15] moves his wives and concubines in his
[39:17] children and they go across the forward
[39:19] and he's left all alone and when he's
[39:22] all by himself he has no more options he
[39:26] has no more tricks to play he has no
[39:27] more plan he has no more deception he
[39:29] has nothing and in that in that state
[39:33] when he's come to the end of his ability
[39:35] to the end of his means he's laid out
[39:38] the best plan he has but it's not a good
[39:40] plan there's no way of escape and that
[39:43] time a man comes and wrestles with him
[39:45] all night
[39:46] yes where did the man come from where
[39:49] did Jacob find him amen it was it was
[39:52] God Amen it was the angel of the Lord
[39:54] that came Amen to get a hold of Jacob
[39:56] and to change Jacob Amen in a time when
[39:59] Jacob was in need a time that Jacob was
[40:02] in distress when Jacob was alone when he
[40:04] had no other options and he had no other
[40:06] plans God came to him Jacob couldn't go
[40:10] to God God came to him
[40:12] it's so amazing that God is keeping his
[40:15] word and Jacob's saying if God but God
[40:18] there was no if with God there was never
[40:20] a possibility of an if with God God said
[40:22] I will do it and he will do it and when
[40:24] Jacob gets into this place where he
[40:26] needs God God comes on the scene
[40:30] oh if Jacob couldn't believe that from
[40:33] the beginning and stopped all the
[40:35] self-made plans and all the deception
[40:37] and all the trickery things might have
[40:39] went a lot easier for him but we know
[40:40] that was God's hand to train them but
[40:43] now he gets to this place where he's in
[40:45] desperation he's in need he he he he
[40:48] can't deliver himself and all of his
[40:51] skills and all of his abilities has come
[40:53] to not
[40:54] I tell you if you ever get in that place
[40:56] you're in a good place
[40:58] when you get to the spot where you
[40:59] cannot help yourself and all that you
[41:02] thought you were good at you're now
[41:03] ready to throw away
[41:05] have you ever been there
[41:07] where I thought I was good at this and I
[41:08] failed
[41:09] I thought I could do this and I failed
[41:11] in it I thought I maybe could preserve
[41:13] myself I thought maybe I could do
[41:15] something I thought maybe I could gain
[41:16] something and all of your efforts have
[41:18] failed I tell your friends you're in a
[41:20] good spot amen because when everything
[41:22] you can try has failed there is a
[41:24] promise in your life if you're a child
[41:26] of God that has no if attached to it if
[41:29] there's ever an if we put the if there
[41:31] God didn't
[41:33] Jacob put the if God did not put the if
[41:36] Jacob put the F amen and now Jacob he's
[41:39] wondering if God will keep it he's
[41:42] hoping that God will do it he he he
[41:44] wants God to do it and he says if
[41:48] if he knew God would do it he'd say when
[41:51] when God brings me back to this place I
[41:53] will when God not if
[41:56] so it shows there was a question in his
[41:58] mind
[42:00] and God I believe for all of his
[42:03] children wants to get the question out
[42:05] of our mind
[42:07] I think he wants us to get the if out of
[42:09] our vocabulary
[42:11] and get to the place where we know that
[42:14] he'll keep his word
[42:15] we don't know how we don't know what it
[42:18] will look like we don't know when we
[42:20] don't know the circumstances but we have
[42:22] to get to the place where we know that
[42:24] he will keep his promise
[42:26] and so now God as faithful as God always
[42:29] is when Jacob's at the end of his rope
[42:32] and Desperation all of a sudden a man
[42:35] appears
[42:37] where did he come from
[42:39] it was God coming to Jacob
[42:42] God came to his child because God is
[42:46] going to keep his word God knows exactly
[42:48] where you and I are
[42:50] he hasn't lost track of us it doesn't
[42:52] matter what trial you're in it doesn't
[42:54] matter the circumstances that are lined
[42:56] up God knows right where you are and he
[42:58] knows how to meet you
[43:01] and he meets Jacob
[43:04] and they start wrestling
[43:06] and and we've been through this before
[43:09] but I just want to remind you of a few
[43:11] things
[43:13] I believe that this may be just me you
[43:17] may not believe this way but I believe
[43:18] that angel could free himself from
[43:20] Jacob's grip
[43:24] I believe the angel of the Lord had
[43:25] power I believe the angel of the Lord
[43:27] was a supernatural amen Angel of the
[43:30] Lord that could deliver himself because
[43:32] when he wanted to he could touch the
[43:33] hollow of Jacob's thigh and the sin you
[43:36] shrank I mean what kind of power is that
[43:38] he just touches his thought he could
[43:40] have touched his head touched his eyes
[43:43] just shriveled him up and dropped him
[43:44] like a ball amen but he could he could
[43:47] shrivel up the sinew of his thigh amen
[43:49] but it said amen he says that that he
[43:52] could not Prevail over Jacob this is a
[43:55] different kind of prevailing amen it's
[43:57] not sheer strength it's not the power in
[43:59] Jacob's arms but there was something
[44:01] else in Jacob that that angel couldn't
[44:04] overcome
[44:05] there is something else in Jacob that
[44:07] could Prevail over the angel and it
[44:09] wasn't the muscles in his arms it wasn't
[44:12] the intellect in his mind but there was
[44:14] a sea Gene of God there was a part of
[44:17] God down in Jacob in that part of God
[44:20] could Prevail amen could get a hold of
[44:23] God Amen and actually amen hold on to
[44:27] God and not turn loose
[44:30] this this this Angel he when he when he
[44:35] saw that he could not Prevail he touched
[44:37] the hollow of Jacob's thigh and then he
[44:39] says let me go and Jacob said I'll not
[44:41] let you go till you bless me and he
[44:44] asked him what his name is
[44:46] he asked for a blessing and the angel
[44:48] says what's your name
[44:52] and when he when he he says Jacob he
[44:55] says Thou shalt no more be called Jacob
[44:57] but Israel
[44:58] I'll read this out of the scriptures
[45:02] verse 28 thy name shall be called No
[45:04] More Jacob but Israel for as a prince
[45:07] hast thou power with God and with men
[45:10] and has prevailed
[45:12] he's saying I'm changing your name
[45:14] because you've all your life been called
[45:18] a supplanter a Deceiver
[45:21] but you don't really know that you've
[45:24] got power with God
[45:26] you don't really know who you are Jacob
[45:30] didn't really know who he was
[45:33] he knew what lineage he was in he knew
[45:36] about the promise he knew who Abraham
[45:38] and Isaac were he knew what God had done
[45:40] in the past he even knew what God
[45:42] promised for him but he really didn't
[45:44] know who he was and now he gets in this
[45:47] in this match with an angel of the Lord
[45:49] and he's holding on because why is he
[45:52] holding on because he has no options
[45:55] he come in contact with something that
[45:57] he knew could help him how did he know
[45:59] this could help him I don't know how did
[46:01] he know this was the answer how did he
[46:03] know this was the solution I don't know
[46:05] how he knew all I know is he knew amen
[46:07] and he knew he could not let go so until
[46:10] this Angel blessed him
[46:12] Jacob think about it hey he's got other
[46:15] things on his mind and then just meeting
[46:17] this man and wrestling with his man in
[46:19] the night when he's by himself he's got
[46:21] Esau he's got his wife and his children
[46:23] across the brook he's got these droves
[46:25] and and the men servants and women
[46:27] servants and he's got presents going to
[46:29] meet Esau and Esau coming to kill him he
[46:32] thinks he's got all of this going on and
[46:34] he finds a man and decides to wrestle
[46:36] with him
[46:38] whenever he come in contact with God and
[46:41] flesh
[46:43] he knew this can deliver me
[46:46] he knew this manifestation of God can
[46:49] save me he knew this is the answer
[46:52] and he got a hold of it and he would not
[46:55] let go of it even though the angel said
[46:57] let me go he said I'll not let you go
[47:00] even though he Afflicted him in the
[47:02] battle and weakened him by touching the
[47:05] sinew of his thigh he still wouldn't
[47:07] turn him loose amen this is a man who's
[47:09] going beyond the if he's saying you've
[47:12] got to do it nobody else can do it he's
[47:14] not walking away saying if you bless me
[47:16] then I'll do this he's saying Now's the
[47:18] Time and I've got to have it something
[47:19] in my life has to change
[47:22] this is what brother Branham says in the
[47:25] message desperations
[47:28] he says
[47:30] Jacob cried like never before
[47:32] desperately called until he got a hold
[47:34] of God
[47:36] you know this this word pineal that he
[47:39] named this place means facing God
[47:43] he was facing God and I want to talk
[47:45] about that for a little bit today facing
[47:47] God
[47:48] but he had heard about God he had seen
[47:52] the sacrifices at the altar he had heard
[47:55] the testimonies he had heard God speak
[47:57] to him in a dream he had experienced
[47:59] certain things but now he was facing God
[48:03] and this time when he's facing God he's
[48:05] facing God Alone
[48:07] there's nobody else involved it's him
[48:10] and God
[48:12] said Jacob cried like never before
[48:13] desperately called until he got a hold
[48:15] of God and when he did he wrestled not
[48:17] for 15 minutes
[48:19] he wrestled to keep him in his soul
[48:22] think about that
[48:24] he pressured to keep him in his soul all
[48:27] night long and still he knew he didn't
[48:29] have the blessing and he was able to
[48:31] hold on until the blessing came he
[48:33] wrestled desperately until the blessing
[48:35] come
[48:36] then
[48:37] and we see until God came on the scene
[48:40] and then in despair I'll not let you go
[48:43] when he began to feel the blessing come
[48:45] down on him a lot of people say glory to
[48:47] God I got it now there you're deceived
[48:50] yeah somebody say oh I just feel so good
[48:52] brother man I went down there and prayed
[48:54] oh Shivers run over me and that might
[48:56] have been God I saw a great light before
[48:59] me that still might have been gone but
[49:01] that ain't what I'm talking about
[49:04] the Bible said in Hebrews the sixth
[49:06] chapter the rain falleth from the just
[49:08] and the unjust just the same now you
[49:10] take wheat and take weeds and put them
[49:12] in the field and the rain is actually
[49:13] set for the wheat
[49:15] but the rain falls on the weeds and the
[49:17] same as it does the wheat and the rain
[49:19] and the weeds is just as happy about the
[49:21] rain as the wheat is and it's the very
[49:23] same rain the very Holy Ghost can fall
[49:25] upon an unbeliever and make him act just
[49:27] exactly the same way a Believer acts but
[49:30] by their fruits they are known that's
[49:32] what I'm speaking that's the token and
[49:35] Jacob rather in desperation he said I
[49:37] know I field you you're here with me but
[49:40] I'm not going to let you go
[49:43] see Jacob wasn't just after the feeling
[49:47] he wasn't just after feeling the
[49:49] presence of God he needed something to
[49:52] change
[49:53] he wasn't just in the emotional part and
[49:57] he wasn't just in the feeling amen he
[49:59] said I know I failed you but I'm just
[50:00] not going to let you go he needed
[50:02] something more than to feel the
[50:04] sensation of the presence of God he
[50:07] needed to meet God face to face and stay
[50:09] there until something in him changed
[50:14] he said
[50:16] I'll read this again now I feel you I
[50:18] know I feel you you're here with me but
[50:20] I'm not going to let you go somebody
[50:23] sees it fine the first little sensation
[50:25] they get up and jump up and down and run
[50:27] up I don't say I got it I got it I got
[50:29] it oh no oh no Jacob stayed there until
[50:33] something happened
[50:34] that made him walk different made him a
[50:38] different person because that he stayed
[50:40] until that happened
[50:42] and and he was able the Bible said he
[50:44] held until he prevailed how can a man
[50:47] Prevail over God but you can do it you
[50:50] can do it a man can Prevail over God
[50:54] listen this is wonderful that the
[50:56] prophet's saying this a man can Prevail
[50:57] over God how with what strength with
[51:00] what might with what mind with with what
[51:02] speech how in the world is a human being
[51:04] going to Prevail over God it's not the
[51:07] human being amen there's something down
[51:10] inside that God responds to amen there's
[51:13] something inside that can hook on to God
[51:15] there's something inside that can cry to
[51:17] God and pull God into a into action
[51:22] right you say is that right brother
[51:23] that's right read the whole Bible amen
[51:26] there was something in a certain group
[51:28] of people that could reach out and hook
[51:30] into God and pull God into action Moses
[51:33] could do it when he stood in the Gap
[51:35] amen David could do it when he when he
[51:37] prayed over Israel amen that the plague
[51:39] would stop there was something in God's
[51:42] people amen that could Prevail over God
[51:47] it wasn't their strength it wasn't their
[51:49] mind it wasn't their abilities it wasn't
[51:51] their group amen there was something in
[51:54] them it wasn't them there's something in
[51:56] them and that something in them was a
[51:58] part of God
[52:01] and it was God getting a hold of God it
[52:04] was God hooking into God it was God
[52:07] turning the eye of God
[52:11] I said before I I preached the message
[52:14] here I don't even remember how long ago
[52:15] but I I talked about we dramatized you
[52:17] know the wrestling match between the
[52:19] angel of the Lord and and which is a
[52:22] manifestation of God
[52:24] Amen in this manifestation of God who's
[52:26] wrestling with Jacob and he's saying let
[52:28] me go
[52:29] but the angel doesn't want Jacob to let
[52:31] him go he would have been disappointed
[52:32] if Jacob would have turned loose and
[52:33] said okay go on your way amen listen it
[52:37] wasn't it wasn't that the angel amen
[52:40] came down to fight with Jacob
[52:42] because the angel wanted to be let go
[52:45] he wanted to leave he wanted to move on
[52:49] it was Jacob who wanted to get a hold of
[52:52] the angel
[52:53] but but God and this manifestation
[52:56] presented himself to Jacob and then when
[52:59] Jacob got a hold of him amen he says let
[53:01] me go and he says no I'll not let you go
[53:04] and and and when we're dramatizing that
[53:06] we were just saying let me go he may say
[53:09] it with a gravelly voice he may say it
[53:11] in Anger he may say Let Me Go amen but
[53:14] in the whole time he's saying don't let
[53:16] me go
[53:17] don't let me go because I'm here for
[53:20] your change I'm here for you I'm here to
[53:23] solve your problem I'm coming on the
[53:25] scene in this manifestation to free you
[53:28] from yourself to change your walk to
[53:30] change your life to deliver you
[53:33] he says he says
[53:36] let me go
[53:38] but the will of God is not for Jacob to
[53:40] let him go
[53:42] what was holding on it was God holding
[53:44] on to God
[53:47] so brother man said Jacob stayed there
[53:49] until something happened
[53:52] I wanna I wanna look at this
[53:56] um facing God for just a little bit
[53:58] because that's what this is what Jacob
[54:00] experienced he met God face to face and
[54:03] his life was preserved and he named the
[54:05] place pineal after that experience and
[54:08] let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 5.
[54:17] I just wanted to look at what does it
[54:19] mean to see God face to face
[54:23] because sometimes we get wrong ideas
[54:26] and we get our own ideas and we read
[54:29] something that our own imagination picks
[54:31] paints a picture and if I tell you that
[54:33] you need to meet God face to face
[54:36] what's the first thing that pops into
[54:37] your mind you need to you need to go out
[54:40] into the woods and you need to have a
[54:42] fasting prayer meeting until the pillar
[54:44] of fire comes down or until a visible
[54:47] manifestation and you grab a hold of
[54:49] that and you met God face to face but
[54:51] that's not always what it means and I
[54:53] want to I want to look at that here it
[54:55] could be many manifestations but let's
[54:56] just look at the Bible and look at the
[54:58] message
[54:59] in Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 2.
[55:04] Moses is now speaking he's recapping the
[55:06] history of Israel at this point they're
[55:09] getting ready to go in the promised land
[55:10] and he's reminding them of their Journey
[55:11] he said the Lord Our God made a covenant
[55:14] with us in Horeb the Lord may not this
[55:16] Covenant with our fathers but with us
[55:18] even us who are all of us here alive
[55:20] this day
[55:21] the Lord talked with you face to face in
[55:24] the mount out of the midst of the fire
[55:27] God came down
[55:29] and he met Israel face to face
[55:33] he said in verse 5 and I stood between
[55:36] the Lord and you at that time to show
[55:38] you the word of the Lord for you were
[55:40] afraid by reason of the fire and went
[55:42] not up into the mound so here all of
[55:45] Israel meets God face to face but they
[55:48] never see a person
[55:48] [Music]
[55:50] they didn't see a similitude or a form
[55:52] of a man what they saw was a black smoke
[55:55] and a fire come down upon the mountain
[55:58] and what they heard was the voice of God
[56:00] Speak Out The Covenant the Commandments
[56:03] and when God showed up in that smoking
[56:06] Fire on the Mountain and the mountain
[56:08] shaked in the mountain quake and God
[56:10] began to speak directly to them and they
[56:12] could hear with their ears the words
[56:14] that he was saying that's when Moses
[56:16] says you met God face to face
[56:19] so face to face is not necessarily what
[56:22] we think of face to face like two humans
[56:24] meeting face to face God presented
[56:27] himself down in a manifestation and gave
[56:30] them the word and he met them face to
[56:32] face
[56:34] now let's go to Exodus 33.
[56:43] Exodus 33 and verse 9.
[56:51] I'm going to read quite a length of this
[56:54] because there's a certain thing that I
[56:56] really want to get to so we can
[56:57] understand
[56:59] verse 9 and it came to pass as Moses
[57:02] entered into the Tabernacle
[57:04] the Cloudy pillar descended and stood at
[57:07] the door of the Tabernacle and the Lord
[57:08] talked with Moses
[57:10] and all the people saw the Cloudy pillar
[57:12] stand at the Tabernacle door and all the
[57:14] people rose up and worshiped every man
[57:16] in his tent door
[57:17] and the Lord spake unto Moses face to
[57:19] face as a man speaketh unto his friend
[57:22] and he turned again into the camp but
[57:25] his servant Joshua the son of none a
[57:27] young man departed not out of the
[57:28] Tabernacle so here we have Moses going
[57:31] into the Tabernacle and it says here the
[57:34] Lord spake to Moses face to face as a
[57:37] man speaketh to his friend
[57:39] so I want to read on
[57:41] verse 12 and Moses said unto the Lord
[57:43] see thou sayest unto me bring up this
[57:46] people and thou has not let me know whom
[57:49] thou will sin with me yet thou has said
[57:51] I Know Thee by name and thou has also
[57:53] found Grace in my sight now therefore I
[57:56] pray thee if I have found Grace in thy
[57:58] sight show me now thy way that I may
[58:01] Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy
[58:03] sight and consider that this nation is
[58:05] thy people what what is Moses doing here
[58:09] face to face with God he is contending
[58:12] with God
[58:13] what's he doing he is wrestling with God
[58:16] and he's trying to prevail
[58:19] why did he go out to the Tabernacle
[58:21] because this is after the children of
[58:23] Israel were caught in sin and revelry
[58:25] when Moses was 40 days in the mountain
[58:27] this is when he came down and broke the
[58:29] tables of stone and anger and the
[58:31] Levites joined to him and slew so many
[58:33] of them because they were caught in
[58:34] idolatry making golden calves and he
[58:36] took the Tabernacle and moved it outside
[58:38] of the camp and went out there and God
[58:40] had said I'll not take this people up
[58:42] into the land anymore and now Moses goes
[58:44] out to the Tabernacle outside the camp
[58:47] and he begins what's he doing he is
[58:49] wrestling with the Lord he is he's
[58:51] trying to Prevail over God to get God to
[58:54] change his mind
[58:57] what kind of person is Moses whatever
[58:59] was in Moses was in Jacob amen whatever
[59:01] was in Jacob was in Moses
[59:04] he said now for I pray thee if I have
[59:07] found Grace in thy sight verse 13 show
[59:09] me the way that I may Know Thee and I
[59:11] may find Grace in thy sight and consider
[59:13] that this nation is thy people and he
[59:15] said
[59:16] my presence shall go with thee and I
[59:18] will give thee rest
[59:19] and he said unto them if thou presence
[59:21] go not with me carry us not up thence
[59:25] he's saying if your presence doesn't go
[59:27] because because God had said I'll not
[59:30] take you up my presence won't be with
[59:32] the people I I won't take them up and he
[59:34] says if your presence will not be with
[59:36] me then don't take us up
[59:39] how is Moses speaking to God like this
[59:43] it's not Moses it's another part of God
[59:45] inside Moses talking to God can hook
[59:48] into God and can turn God's head
[59:52] amen and he said unto him If thy
[59:54] presence go not with me carry us not a
[59:56] pins for wherein shall it be known here
[59:58] that I and thy people have found Grace
[1:00:00] in thy is it not and that thou goest
[1:00:03] with us so shall thou so shall we be
[1:00:07] separated and I and thy people from all
[1:00:09] the people that are upon the face of the
[1:00:11] earth and the Lord said unto Moses I
[1:00:13] will do this thing also that thou has
[1:00:15] spoken
[1:00:16] for thou has found Grace in my sight and
[1:00:19] I Know Thee by name
[1:00:22] my what whatever Jacob was able to do
[1:00:26] with the angel Moses is able to do with
[1:00:28] God
[1:00:29] says my presence won't be there I won't
[1:00:31] be in the camp I won't be in the midst
[1:00:33] and Moses says if you don't go with us
[1:00:35] don't take us up
[1:00:36] but go with us and remember your people
[1:00:38] and he says I'll do as you've spoken
[1:00:42] what an amazing sequence of events verse
[1:00:44] 18.
[1:00:46] and he said I beseech thee show me thy
[1:00:48] Glory
[1:00:49] and he said I will make all my goodness
[1:00:51] pass before thee and I will proclaim the
[1:00:54] name of the Lord before thee and I will
[1:00:55] be gracious to whom I will be gracious
[1:00:57] and to I will show Mercy on whom I will
[1:01:00] show mercy and he said thou canst not
[1:01:03] see my face for there shall no man see
[1:01:06] me and live
[1:01:09] but we read up here
[1:01:11] in verse 11 and the Lord spake unto
[1:01:15] Moses face to face as a man speaks to
[1:01:18] his friend
[1:01:20] so when Moses was speaking to God face
[1:01:22] to face he never saw God's face
[1:01:25] because God he said Show Me Your Glory
[1:01:27] and he says no man can see my face and
[1:01:30] live so it's not what we think of we're
[1:01:32] talking face to face
[1:01:34] he was when it when you talk face to
[1:01:36] face with God you're in the very
[1:01:38] presence of God Amen you're you're he's
[1:01:40] in the presence of God speaking directly
[1:01:42] to God but it didn't mean that he saw a
[1:01:44] person there in the face of a person
[1:01:46] just like when God spoke face to face to
[1:01:48] Israel they didn't see the similitude of
[1:01:50] a man they saw smoking furnace of fire
[1:01:52] and they heard his voice
[1:01:55] so we we want to have
[1:01:57] right idea
[1:02:00] now let's go to First Corinthians 13.
[1:02:11] I want us to see that we can talk face
[1:02:14] to face to God
[1:02:16] we can come in contact with the Living
[1:02:18] God we can come into the presence of God
[1:02:21] and we can talk to God face to face
[1:02:25] in fact we must meet God personally
[1:02:28] there's no way we must come into a
[1:02:31] personal meeting with God himself
[1:02:33] in order to be changed we have to have
[1:02:35] the ability to meet him face to face
[1:02:38] but what mountain will you go to what
[1:02:40] stream will you stay by how long will
[1:02:42] you fast what prayer closet will you go
[1:02:44] into will you dig a cave will you go
[1:02:46] into your attic what will you do we have
[1:02:48] to find how to come into His presence
[1:02:50] and how to meet him face to face
[1:02:53] First Corinthians 13.
[1:02:57] verse 10.
[1:02:59] verse 9 for we know in part and we
[1:03:02] prophesy in part but when that which is
[1:03:05] perfect has come then that which is in
[1:03:07] part shall be done away when I was a
[1:03:09] child I spake as a child I understood as
[1:03:11] a child I thought as a child but when I
[1:03:14] became a man I put away childish things
[1:03:16] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[1:03:19] this word glass Darkly means we see
[1:03:22] through a mirror that's obscure
[1:03:25] it's a literal definition we see through
[1:03:27] a mirror that's obscure I'm looking in a
[1:03:28] mirror but it's obscure I can't see the
[1:03:31] image right
[1:03:33] all right
[1:03:34] but then when when that which is perfect
[1:03:38] has come
[1:03:39] then
[1:03:41] face to face
[1:03:43] now I know in part but then shall I know
[1:03:46] even as also I am known and now
[1:03:48] abideth's Faith Hope in charity these
[1:03:50] three but the greatest of these is
[1:03:52] charity
[1:03:53] he's saying when that which is perfect
[1:03:54] has come now we're looking into the word
[1:03:58] amen like looking into a mirror Darkly
[1:04:00] or obscurely but when that which is
[1:04:03] perfect has come we're going to look in
[1:04:04] and we're going to have Clear Vision and
[1:04:06] we're going to see face to face
[1:04:08] what we're going to see we're going to
[1:04:10] look at the word
[1:04:11] we're going to see there's no obscurity
[1:04:13] on the word anymore and it'll be like
[1:04:15] looking in a mirror face to face
[1:04:17] this gets so this is so good but there's
[1:04:20] a few things I want to read to hear
[1:04:21] Brother Branham comes to questions and
[1:04:23] answers in 1964. he's in August of 1964.
[1:04:27] and there's a series of things that he
[1:04:29] hits on through this portion of
[1:04:31] questions and answers and so I'll just
[1:04:33] give you the paragraph numbers because
[1:04:34] he references back to the same thing a
[1:04:35] few times
[1:04:36] and and in paragraph 56 he says First
[1:04:40] Corinthians 13 says when that which is
[1:04:42] perfect has come that which is in part
[1:04:44] shall be done away with so all these
[1:04:46] little things of jumping up and down
[1:04:48] like a kid trying to talk in tongues and
[1:04:50] all these other things when that which
[1:04:52] is perfect and we do have today by God's
[1:04:55] help the perfect interpretation of the
[1:04:58] word with Divine vindication
[1:05:00] so what is it brother man I'm saying
[1:05:02] when that was just perfect just come
[1:05:03] what is that which is perfect when the
[1:05:05] perfect interpretation of the word has
[1:05:07] come we have the perfect word
[1:05:10] then that which is in part is done away
[1:05:12] with when I was a child I spake as a
[1:05:14] child I understood as a child but when I
[1:05:16] became a man I put away childish things
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:20] so then he goes down to paragraph 96
[1:05:22] this is further down in questions and
[1:05:24] answers
[1:05:25] he says Paul said though I speak with
[1:05:27] tongue of men and angels do I give my
[1:05:29] body to be burned as a sacrifice though
[1:05:31] I understand all the mysteries of God
[1:05:33] though I give all my goods to the poor
[1:05:35] and all these things and have not
[1:05:36] charity I still am nothing
[1:05:39] I have faith that I can move mountains
[1:05:41] and so forth I'm still nothing then he
[1:05:43] said that which is in part will be done
[1:05:45] away with when that which is perfect has
[1:05:47] come or when that which is perfect is
[1:05:50] made known
[1:05:52] now he adds more to the statement when
[1:05:53] that which is perfect has come or when
[1:05:55] that which is perfect is made known now
[1:05:58] listen the way he says next now I've got
[1:06:00] a question on that I hope I get to it
[1:06:02] tonight about what happened when the
[1:06:04] seals opened
[1:06:06] he's tying this well it's just perfect
[1:06:09] has come Amen to that which is perfect
[1:06:11] being made known to the opening of the
[1:06:14] seals and he's tying them all together
[1:06:17] now he comes down to paragraph 164 and
[1:06:19] there's a question that's asked him and
[1:06:21] here's the question please explain First
[1:06:23] Corinthians 13 8-12 that's the portion
[1:06:26] we just read now that the perfect word
[1:06:28] is restored to the church are these
[1:06:31] verses fulfilled
[1:06:32] brother says now I think I just went
[1:06:34] through that didn't I and when that
[1:06:36] which is perfect has come that which is
[1:06:39] in part shall be done away with Paul
[1:06:41] said though I speak with tongue of men
[1:06:42] and angels I do all these things but
[1:06:45] when that which is perfect has come now
[1:06:47] is there anything perfect but God
[1:06:51] I want you to see where he's going
[1:06:54] he's going to stay right in the same
[1:06:56] vein of thinking they've asked him now
[1:06:58] now that the word is restored are these
[1:07:01] verses fulfilled and he goes right into
[1:07:03] explaining it he says I've talked about
[1:07:05] that before we read Those portions he
[1:07:07] says when that which is perfect is come
[1:07:09] now is there anything perfect but God no
[1:07:11] sir is God the perfect the answer is yes
[1:07:14] in the beginning was the
[1:07:17] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:07:20] Word was God the word still God all
[1:07:23] right then that which is perfect has
[1:07:25] come that which is in part done away
[1:07:27] with
[1:07:28] what's he talking about he's talking
[1:07:31] about the opening of the word amen in
[1:07:33] the opening of the word that which is
[1:07:36] perfect is come or been made known amen
[1:07:39] that which is perfect is now revealed
[1:07:41] amen and that which is in part all the
[1:07:43] partial understanding and the
[1:07:45] denominational understanding it's done
[1:07:46] away with all of our wrong thinking is
[1:07:48] done away with but at the opening of the
[1:07:50] word that which is perfect has come and
[1:07:53] that's First Corinthians 13 and then
[1:07:55] that same portion it says now we're
[1:07:57] looking at a mirror
[1:08:00] Darkly
[1:08:03] but then when that which is perfect when
[1:08:06] the seals are open when the book is open
[1:08:07] and the third pull then we shall see
[1:08:10] face to face
[1:08:12] then we can come face to face with the
[1:08:15] word with the person of the word
[1:08:20] amen
[1:08:22] here's what brother remember says in God
[1:08:24] who is rich in Mercy I've heard a
[1:08:26] similar little story I hope it don't
[1:08:28] sound sacrilegious about a little duck
[1:08:30] being born under a hen
[1:08:32] one time I love brother Brown's little
[1:08:34] stories they're not sacrilegious to me
[1:08:36] this is the way brother Benjamin's
[1:08:38] Simplicity gets us to understand what
[1:08:39] he's been saying
[1:08:41] a little duck being born under him one
[1:08:43] time he couldn't understand a funny
[1:08:45] looking little fellow odd guy and he
[1:08:47] couldn't understand the dust and
[1:08:49] everything they were playing in the
[1:08:50] barnyard but one day the old hen led the
[1:08:53] little brood out behind the barn and got
[1:08:55] he got a smell of water
[1:08:58] well he took out towards that water as
[1:09:00] hard as he could go why he had never
[1:09:02] been on a pond before he had never been
[1:09:04] in the water but he was a duck to begin
[1:09:06] with only thing he had to do was come to
[1:09:09] himself
[1:09:11] that's the same thing the believer is
[1:09:13] there is something in him that when he
[1:09:15] meets God face to face he comes to
[1:09:18] himself
[1:09:20] well when he when he meets God face to
[1:09:22] face he comes to what he comes to
[1:09:24] himself I thought I came to God but when
[1:09:26] I come to God face to face in this open
[1:09:28] word I'm going to come to myself
[1:09:31] because now we're looking at a word
[1:09:33] we're looking in a mirror Darkly and not
[1:09:36] able to understand what we're seeing but
[1:09:38] at the opening of the seals then the
[1:09:40] clears up and we look in the mirror of
[1:09:42] the word we look into the person of the
[1:09:44] word and it's like looking face to face
[1:09:46] what face do you see when you look in
[1:09:48] the mirror what are you supposed to see
[1:09:49] when you see the person of Christ you're
[1:09:51] supposed to see that it's Christ in you
[1:09:53] the hope of glory
[1:09:56] what is the perfect coming of the
[1:09:58] perfect word and coming face to face
[1:09:59] with God's supposed to do it is supposed
[1:10:01] to give you your proper identification
[1:10:04] and that's exactly what happened to
[1:10:07] Jacob Jacob was Sir planter he was
[1:10:09] living as a supplanter acting like a
[1:10:10] sister planter surviving as a supplanter
[1:10:13] he was a church member but he was
[1:10:15] nominal in every way he had a certain
[1:10:17] level of understanding but there was
[1:10:19] only so much depth to his understanding
[1:10:21] and he was still wheeling and dealing
[1:10:22] and hoping that things would work out
[1:10:24] but when he come face to face with the
[1:10:27] manifestation of God for his day when he
[1:10:29] come face to face with that then that
[1:10:31] manifestation changed his name
[1:10:35] foreign
[1:10:36] gave him an identification
[1:10:42] changed his walk changed his life
[1:10:44] changed everything about him
[1:10:47] so now Jacob he's Jacob is here
[1:10:51] and and and he asks
[1:10:55] he asked me your name my name's Jacob he
[1:10:57] said you'll no longer be called Jacob
[1:10:59] because you're changed
[1:11:01] you'll be Israel
[1:11:03] for as a prince with God thou his power
[1:11:05] with God and with man
[1:11:07] and so he got a name change
[1:11:10] but but then he asked the angel he says
[1:11:13] what's your name
[1:11:15] he said that's not what was important
[1:11:17] about this wrestling match
[1:11:20] if I could just say it in my own words
[1:11:23] why do you ask my name that's not what
[1:11:26] you need to know what you need to know
[1:11:28] is who you are
[1:11:30] amen and the whole point of coming face
[1:11:33] to face with God is so that we can know
[1:11:35] who we are amen we've lived in this life
[1:11:38] I mean you you may have grown up in the
[1:11:40] message you may have grown up in a
[1:11:41] church tradition or wherever you grew up
[1:11:43] in in a Godly family just like Jacob did
[1:11:46] and understand the promises and what
[1:11:48] happened before amen but what you need
[1:11:50] to do is come face to face with God a
[1:11:53] living God to the person of God himself
[1:11:55] who will show you who you are amen not
[1:11:58] who your parents are who brother Branham
[1:12:00] was but who you are
[1:12:02] and change your life
[1:12:05] so that you walk different from then on
[1:12:08] this little duck he thought he was a
[1:12:11] chicken but he got a smell of water one
[1:12:13] time and he run off and brother I said
[1:12:15] that's the same thing that the believer
[1:12:17] is there's something in him that when he
[1:12:19] meets God face to face he comes to
[1:12:21] himself the seed is in him and it's
[1:12:23] quick and my that's right and he flies
[1:12:25] away from the things of the world they
[1:12:26] become dead to him my I remember we all
[1:12:29] had our life in the past and those
[1:12:30] things of the world but once we got a
[1:12:32] hold of that real thing something that
[1:12:35] quickened us a little seed that comes to
[1:12:37] life then all the things of the world
[1:12:38] rotted right there we had no more desire
[1:12:41] of it
[1:12:42] amen Brotherhood says in the
[1:12:45] unchangeable God what a man what a way
[1:12:46] to meet God in a wrestling match but it
[1:12:48] was God regardless of whether he's in a
[1:12:50] burning bush or a wrestling match it was
[1:12:52] God
[1:12:54] and the main thing was that Jacob he had
[1:12:57] dreams and visions and so forth but this
[1:13:00] was one time he could lay his hand on
[1:13:02] something and say it's God
[1:13:04] and he was able to hold on to it until
[1:13:07] the blessing came
[1:13:09] oh if we could do that if we could find
[1:13:11] a spot to where we could see God whether
[1:13:13] it's in his word wherever it is and
[1:13:16] recognizes God and hold on to hold on to
[1:13:19] it until the blessing comes wrestle it
[1:13:22] out with God God promised to do it God
[1:13:24] said if we'd seek we'd find ask and it
[1:13:27] shall be given knock and it'll be open
[1:13:28] every word is true when Jacob got a hold
[1:13:31] of something that he could look at hold
[1:13:33] to with his hands and seen that it was
[1:13:35] God he would not turn loose
[1:13:38] oh my so what is this message amen what
[1:13:42] is the open book what is brother Graham
[1:13:44] said what is the opening of the seals
[1:13:45] revealing Christ for those seals are
[1:13:48] Christ amen it's him this word is him
[1:13:50] the opening of the book is the unveiling
[1:13:53] of God
[1:13:55] and when we can get a hold of it we can
[1:13:57] come face to face with God in the
[1:13:59] revealing of his word and come in
[1:14:01] contact with God and recognize as God he
[1:14:04] said Jacob had seen Visions Jacob had
[1:14:06] seen dreams Jacob had seen so much amen
[1:14:09] but when he come in contact with
[1:14:10] something he could get his hands on he
[1:14:12] wouldn't turn loose
[1:14:14] and what God has done for us for the
[1:14:16] seed in this day he has presented
[1:14:18] himself and made himself available
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:21] he has come by our way
[1:14:23] just like the angel uh Jacob I mean
[1:14:26] Jacob didn't know where he was going he
[1:14:28] didn't know where to find a supernatural
[1:14:30] being
[1:14:32] but that being presented himself to
[1:14:35] Jacob
[1:14:36] and Jacob got a hold of it
[1:14:39] how are you going to find God where are
[1:14:41] you going to go
[1:14:42] what mountain do we climb what Temple
[1:14:44] will you go to
[1:14:46] where will you direct people
[1:14:50] you see God has made himself available
[1:14:54] God has come by he's passing by
[1:14:58] the question is do you see him
[1:15:02] do you see it's more than a man and more
[1:15:04] than a group of people and more than a
[1:15:06] church setting it's more than printed
[1:15:08] books it's more than audio recordings
[1:15:12] it's more than paper and ink it's more
[1:15:15] than sound it's more than that this is
[1:15:18] God unveiling himself this is God
[1:15:21] presenting himself to a people to where
[1:15:23] a people can come face to face with God
[1:15:25] in this generation that which is perfect
[1:15:27] has come to take away the cloudiness of
[1:15:30] the mirror we've been looking at so that
[1:15:31] we can get a clear identification of Who
[1:15:34] We Are
[1:15:37] now who's going to get a hold of it and
[1:15:40] not turn loose till it changes them
[1:15:43] it's the question who's going to get a
[1:15:45] hold of it and not turn loose say well
[1:15:46] brother Chad I was raising the message
[1:15:47] on my life it didn't change me get a
[1:15:49] hold of it and don't let go and go to
[1:15:52] imploring God Amen going to speak to God
[1:15:54] Amen the way Moses spoke to God God if
[1:15:57] you don't go with me don't let me take
[1:15:59] one more step I don't want to live
[1:16:00] another day without you in my life go
[1:16:03] talking to him like Moses talked to him
[1:16:06] amen you're not going to your mind can't
[1:16:09] change his mind your speech is it's just
[1:16:11] it's just words it's just air over vocal
[1:16:13] cords but there's a seed inside that's
[1:16:15] crying out for something and if it's
[1:16:17] genuine it can turn the head of God and
[1:16:19] God will listen to what you're saying
[1:16:23] we've got a whole Bible full of stories
[1:16:26] to prove that's true
[1:16:28] don't be so passive and say well you
[1:16:31] know I I've been in the message all my
[1:16:33] life and I was a kid and I've never seen
[1:16:35] it work for me amen he's passing by your
[1:16:38] way why don't you get a hold of him man
[1:16:40] get both hands on him and say I'm not
[1:16:42] turning loose of this till it changes me
[1:16:45] not just I'm going to be in the church
[1:16:47] and I'm going to be like everybody else
[1:16:49] and I'll be honest and kind and good and
[1:16:51] do all of this and if it works out it
[1:16:52] works out and if it don't work out it
[1:16:54] don't that's a Jacob mentality
[1:16:57] and if it works out and everything's
[1:16:58] fine then I'll keep serving God and I'll
[1:17:00] bring my tithe no are you part of the
[1:17:03] promise seed are you one of those that
[1:17:06] this message came to find
[1:17:10] if you're confused about it
[1:17:12] go to get a hold of God
[1:17:15] and say God I've got to know if this
[1:17:18] message is for me or not
[1:17:20] I've got to know I I I've got to be
[1:17:23] different than I am I've got to be
[1:17:25] chained I can't take another day the the
[1:17:28] with the way I am I cannot live like
[1:17:30] this
[1:17:33] I think sometimes we're just way too
[1:17:34] passive
[1:17:37] especially when we're well you know you
[1:17:39] get surrounded by people who have fought
[1:17:41] to overcome
[1:17:43] I mean when we hear testimonies we sit
[1:17:45] down and talk to one another there's
[1:17:46] people who have fought to overcome
[1:17:48] fought through all kinds of distress and
[1:17:51] unbelief and terrible circumstances and
[1:17:53] fought through ridicule and ideas and
[1:17:56] physical circumstances whatever they may
[1:17:59] be fought through all of that fought
[1:18:01] through their own mind and their own
[1:18:02] doubts and fought through and persevered
[1:18:04] until something changed in their life
[1:18:07] amen and they had a transformation
[1:18:10] and we're surrounded by those people and
[1:18:12] it creates a wonderful environment amen
[1:18:14] but that environment is not the same as
[1:18:17] meeting God face to face yourself
[1:18:21] Jacob had come into wonderful
[1:18:23] environments I'm sure the environment in
[1:18:24] Isaac's home was wonderful
[1:18:27] I'm sure the environment around Abraham
[1:18:29] was wonderful I'm sure that these things
[1:18:32] were wonderful and he knew so much amen
[1:18:35] but he had to come in contact with God
[1:18:37] to a living God face to face with the
[1:18:39] reality of God Amen not the concept but
[1:18:42] the reality
[1:18:45] and he would not turn it loose till it
[1:18:48] changed him
[1:18:50] tell you this message is Christ and if
[1:18:52] you get a hold of him it'll change
[1:18:55] you won't be the same you won't stay the
[1:18:58] same
[1:18:58] it'll change you
[1:19:04] Jesus told his disciples he that
[1:19:06] endureth to the end shall be saved
[1:19:09] not those who tried for a while
[1:19:12] and said it didn't work
[1:19:13] but those who are convinced that it's
[1:19:15] true will get a hold of it and stay
[1:19:18] there till it changes them
[1:19:22] the the
[1:19:24] the Jacob mentality's got to go
[1:19:29] and maybe God will in his Mercy allow us
[1:19:32] sometimes to get into Straits where we
[1:19:34] have no options
[1:19:35] get into troubles and get into
[1:19:37] circumstances and that's the mercy and
[1:19:39] grace of God I don't want to see anybody
[1:19:41] to have to go that way but if you have
[1:19:43] to go that way Amen to meet God face to
[1:19:46] face then that's the thing that's needed
[1:19:49] but I said let's get let's let's
[1:19:51] recognize who's here
[1:19:56] in the
[1:19:58] in the message brother Brian said God
[1:20:00] came down and he had a wrestling match
[1:20:01] and stayed with God and held on until
[1:20:03] the blessing came I like Jacob in this
[1:20:05] way when he actually seen something that
[1:20:07] was right when he got his hand on
[1:20:09] something that was true he held on until
[1:20:11] he got results
[1:20:13] oh my not if not if this and then I'll
[1:20:17] do that and hopefully it'll work out
[1:20:18] listen that's no way to live don't live
[1:20:21] that way don't just come to church and
[1:20:24] recognize that the message was probably
[1:20:25] right and it's better than anything else
[1:20:27] I've heard and I'm going to go along
[1:20:29] with it because it seems to produce a
[1:20:30] good life and everything don't go on
[1:20:32] like that friends don't just keep going
[1:20:34] on but get to a place where you say God
[1:20:36] I've got to have something in me change
[1:20:38] amen not that I'm going in the current
[1:20:40] that I'm caught in the Stream and moving
[1:20:42] along with everybody else but if there
[1:20:44] is nobody else I've got to know where I
[1:20:46] stand
[1:20:47] I've got to meet you face to face
[1:20:49] personally amen with a personal meeting
[1:20:52] amen
[1:20:53] that's what we all need
[1:20:55] and listen I don't think God just comes
[1:20:58] and has a conference with us one time in
[1:20:59] our life
[1:21:01] I don't know about you but I've had
[1:21:03] conferences with God Amen I've had times
[1:21:05] where I get in situations and I get in
[1:21:07] circumstances again and again I trip
[1:21:10] myself up and I get in a place where I
[1:21:12] have no solution and I get desperate and
[1:21:14] I cry out to God and so I've had all
[1:21:16] night prayer meetings before crying out
[1:21:18] to God Amen but it was what I needed to
[1:21:21] come in contact with a fresh portion of
[1:21:23] God
[1:21:24] with a fresh revelation of who I am and
[1:21:27] what direction I'm going on and there's
[1:21:29] many conferences with God but we've got
[1:21:31] to have that one conference with God
[1:21:33] where we know we've met a living God and
[1:21:35] something about us is different we're no
[1:21:38] longer like we were
[1:21:42] I want to go to Isaiah chapter 6. if
[1:21:45] you'll turn there with me
[1:21:51] Isaiah chapter 6 is very familiar
[1:21:54] portion of scripture but we know Isaiah
[1:21:57] was a prophet and he admired Hezekiah I
[1:21:59] believe it was or Uzziah
[1:22:01] in uziah was a Godly King and and but he
[1:22:06] had he had backslided the end of his
[1:22:08] life and
[1:22:10] and Isaiah was there he was a prophet of
[1:22:12] God he serving God
[1:22:15] but God needed to take Isaiah to another
[1:22:17] level
[1:22:19] and when he saw the trouble with Uzziah
[1:22:21] he was troubled and and it bothered him
[1:22:24] but God was going to use all of this
[1:22:26] trouble for a purpose and in Isaiah
[1:22:29] chapter 6 verse 1 it says in the year
[1:22:31] that King Uzziah died
[1:22:32] I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[1:22:35] throne high and lifted up and his train
[1:22:37] filled the temple
[1:22:39] brother bam said God had to get his eyes
[1:22:41] off of Uzziah
[1:22:43] so God took Uzziah off the scene
[1:22:45] listen don't get your eyes on some great
[1:22:47] preacher
[1:22:49] and don't even get your eyes on another
[1:22:50] great believer
[1:22:53] God God wants to meet you face to face
[1:22:56] with nobody else in the group and nobody
[1:22:58] else in between so don't look at a
[1:23:01] brother or sister you got confidence in
[1:23:02] or a spouse or or or anything like that
[1:23:05] you've got to meet God face to face
[1:23:09] so the year that Uzziah died said I saw
[1:23:12] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[1:23:14] and lifted up and his train filled the
[1:23:16] temple and above it stood the seraphims
[1:23:18] each one had six wings with Twain he
[1:23:20] covered his face with Twain he covered
[1:23:22] his feet with Twain he did fly
[1:23:24] and one cried into another and said holy
[1:23:26] holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole
[1:23:28] earth is full of his glory and the post
[1:23:31] of the door moved that the voice of him
[1:23:32] that cried and the house was filled with
[1:23:35] smoke then said I
[1:23:37] woe is me for I am undone because I am a
[1:23:41] man of unclean lips and I dwell in the
[1:23:43] midst of a people of unclean lips for
[1:23:45] mine eyes has seen the king the Lord of
[1:23:48] hosts
[1:23:49] when when Isaiah comes in contact with
[1:23:52] the Living God himself he recognizes I'm
[1:23:55] nothing
[1:23:57] I'm nothing and I have no more
[1:23:59] confidence in Uzziah I have no more
[1:24:01] confidence in the priesthood I have no
[1:24:02] more confidence amen it didn't mean the
[1:24:04] priesthood was wrong it didn't mean
[1:24:05] Isaiah was wrong it did but what it
[1:24:07] meant was that that all Man All Flesh is
[1:24:11] a failure amen All Flesh all together is
[1:24:14] a failure to begin with there's no
[1:24:15] confidence in anything of that when I
[1:24:17] saw God he said I recognize that woe is
[1:24:20] me for I am a man of unclean lips and I
[1:24:23] dwell amongst the people of unclean lips
[1:24:24] and they thought they had the word of
[1:24:26] God and they were speaking the word of
[1:24:28] God as Oracles of God and they were but
[1:24:31] they didn't realize how needy they were
[1:24:35] and he said I woe is me when he met God
[1:24:40] face to face listen when he met God face
[1:24:43] to face he didn't walk out of there was
[1:24:45] his chest stuck up and and and I've met
[1:24:48] God and now who's the prophet today and
[1:24:50] who's the mighty one that's not a man
[1:24:52] who met God face to face
[1:24:55] when when when
[1:24:56] uh when Moses met him face to face in
[1:25:00] the burning bush he says I can't speak I
[1:25:03] can't go send somebody else
[1:25:06] when when Jacob met him and became
[1:25:08] Israel when he got a conversion he
[1:25:10] walked away limping he walked away in
[1:25:12] weakness from that point on he wasn't
[1:25:15] the same man he was he had no strength
[1:25:16] no more confidence and ability when
[1:25:19] Isaiah met him Isaiah realized I'm a man
[1:25:21] of unclean lips and everybody I dwell
[1:25:23] amongst those unclean lips
[1:25:26] I said that that pride and arrogant
[1:25:28] attitude and spirit is not coming from a
[1:25:31] man who's met God face to face
[1:25:33] we never saw it in the prophet of God
[1:25:35] Amen we never saw it in these characters
[1:25:38] in The Bible amen we never saw it in
[1:25:40] them we shouldn't see it in ourselves
[1:25:42] you can't say well I know the message
[1:25:43] and I'm this and I'm bride and I'm this
[1:25:46] and that hey if if you ever get a
[1:25:48] recognition of who you are amen it'll do
[1:25:51] something to your flesh that will weaken
[1:25:52] your flesh to the point where you no
[1:25:54] longer have any confidence in your flesh
[1:25:58] that's what happened to Jacob and that's
[1:26:00] what happened to Isaiah
[1:26:02] so if we ever come face to face with God
[1:26:04] we're going to lose self-confidence
[1:26:08] and we're going to gain God confidence
[1:26:12] you would think that if we take that
[1:26:14] scripture out of First Corinthians 13
[1:26:15] and say now we look into a mirror the
[1:26:18] word is a mirror now Darkly
[1:26:21] but then face to face and then you
[1:26:23] realize I'm the word
[1:26:26] you would think that that Revelation
[1:26:28] would Puff a man up
[1:26:32] when God come to Moses and say you're
[1:26:35] I'm going down to deliver the children
[1:26:37] of Israel come I'm sending you
[1:26:41] Moses didn't say good choice God
[1:26:47] he came in contact with the Living God
[1:26:49] it terrified him and he realized I can't
[1:26:51] do it
[1:26:52] when God spoke to the nation of Israel
[1:26:54] face to face they were supposed to come
[1:26:56] up to him when he spoke to them they
[1:26:58] were terrified and they ran away and
[1:26:59] said we can't do it we can't approach to
[1:27:01] God
[1:27:02] Moses said I exceedingly tremble and
[1:27:05] Quake amen it's not as though you come
[1:27:07] in contact with a living God face to
[1:27:09] face with God and now you're now you're
[1:27:11] you're you're you're bold and yourself
[1:27:13] and you're stuffed you're a stuffed
[1:27:15] shirt and you're so self-confident no if
[1:27:17] it does anything it'll help you realize
[1:27:19] how bad your flesh is and how horrible
[1:27:22] you are and how desperately you need God
[1:27:25] in every area of your life
[1:27:29] and then if you walk away with any
[1:27:31] confidence at all you have confidence on
[1:27:33] who he is and who he's called you to be
[1:27:35] and that he'll do it all
[1:27:39] hey
[1:27:41] brother Branham said in the message
[1:27:42] thirst
[1:27:43] said Isaiah that great thirst that he
[1:27:46] had he perhaps was schooled he probably
[1:27:48] had a good education he had a marvelous
[1:27:51] conception of what God ought to be
[1:27:53] you got that
[1:27:55] he had lots of experience he had been
[1:27:57] around for a long time
[1:28:01] he had a marvelous conception of what
[1:28:03] God ought to be he had heard the priest
[1:28:05] he had been in the temple he had been
[1:28:07] raised to be a believer but you see he
[1:28:09] had never come face to face with it
[1:28:11] before
[1:28:12] he had a desire to do right he wanted to
[1:28:15] be right but he just had the educational
[1:28:18] side he had the theological side of it
[1:28:21] but when he got there in the temple that
[1:28:23] day and he seen those cherubims waving
[1:28:25] These Wings back and forth and realized
[1:28:27] that these angels ministered in the face
[1:28:28] of God and them Angels didn't even know
[1:28:31] what sin was and stand in the presence
[1:28:33] of God they had to cover their holy
[1:28:35] faces to stand in the presence of God
[1:28:37] then that Prophet Cried Out woe is me
[1:28:39] for I'm a man of unclean lips all of my
[1:28:42] Theology and stuff that I've learned all
[1:28:44] of my marvelous conception that I had of
[1:28:46] God I am face to face with it now
[1:28:50] he said I'm a man of unclean lips and I
[1:28:52] dwell with the people that's unclean
[1:28:54] lips all their teaching of the laws and
[1:28:56] things that they had done had never
[1:28:57] reached that place to where he came into
[1:28:59] the presence of God and seen God with
[1:29:01] his own eyes and his Trail when he was
[1:29:04] sitting up on high in the heavens and
[1:29:06] there he was face to face with reality
[1:29:08] and he cried I'm a man of unclean lips
[1:29:11] and I dwell among a people of unclean
[1:29:13] lips and then it was that the cherubim
[1:29:16] took the tongues and the coal of fire
[1:29:17] from The Altar and touched them unclean
[1:29:20] lips and turned him from a coward from
[1:29:22] an educated man a teacher to a prophet
[1:29:24] that the word of God could speak through
[1:29:27] sure while he was in the presence of God
[1:29:29] it was something different that thirst
[1:29:31] that he had had reached that place then
[1:29:33] until he was filled with it and let me
[1:29:35] tell you friend I don't care how much
[1:29:37] churches you join how many names you put
[1:29:39] on which away you go and whether you are
[1:29:42] sprinkled baptized or whatever you are
[1:29:44] until you meet that person Jesus Christ
[1:29:46] that's the only thing that will really
[1:29:49] satisfy
[1:29:51] emotion won't do it you might jump up
[1:29:53] and down and shout as long as you want
[1:29:55] to or you might run up and down the
[1:29:57] floor and you might speak in tongues as
[1:29:58] much as you want to and then things are
[1:30:00] all holy and good I don't say I don't
[1:30:03] say nothing against that but until you
[1:30:05] meet that person that satisfying portion
[1:30:07] that something that takes every fiber in
[1:30:10] your body not by emotion but by a
[1:30:13] satisfaction
[1:30:15] that's what we need we need to meet the
[1:30:18] reality
[1:30:19] not the concept the reality we need to
[1:30:22] meet the person of the word not not the
[1:30:25] the the just the letter form but the
[1:30:27] living word amen in our day he's here
[1:30:31] he's here he's come by amen there's a
[1:30:35] there is there's a man come by who's
[1:30:37] speaking figuratively there's a man come
[1:30:39] by that you can get a hold of amen and
[1:30:42] if you can get a hold of him amen you
[1:30:43] can hold on till He blesses you till he
[1:30:46] changes your name so he changes your
[1:30:48] identity until he causes you to lose all
[1:30:50] confidence in the flesh
[1:30:53] there's a man here
[1:30:55] it's the Lord Jesus Christ he's here
[1:30:58] where is he he's here to speak to you
[1:31:01] face to face
[1:31:03] how do you know he's not speaking to you
[1:31:05] now
[1:31:09] what are you looking for
[1:31:12] what is your imagination tell you
[1:31:16] what if he's here through the preaching
[1:31:18] of the word presenting himself to you
[1:31:22] yeah what if he's here using a vessel of
[1:31:25] clay and and vocal cords of a human
[1:31:28] being but what if he's present now
[1:31:30] laying out his plan and his word and his
[1:31:32] identification of you and he's here to
[1:31:34] meet you face to face
[1:31:37] what are you going to wait for what are
[1:31:39] you going to look for what other
[1:31:40] manifestation do you want before you
[1:31:42] give in
[1:31:46] amen
[1:31:47] God is presenting himself through the
[1:31:51] opening of the word through the word
[1:31:52] he's presenting himself he is the word
[1:31:54] he's the person of the word the veil has
[1:31:57] been taken off the word and he's it's
[1:31:59] the unveiling of God and he's here
[1:32:01] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:32:04] that's the seventh seal he's here now
[1:32:06] presenting himself he's available you
[1:32:09] can get a hold of him and you can
[1:32:10] wrestle it out with him and you can
[1:32:12] start talking to him like Moses did and
[1:32:14] said God if you don't if your presence
[1:32:16] doesn't go with me don't live me Live
[1:32:18] Another Day
[1:32:19] don't let me go up and don't let me keep
[1:32:22] moving forward don't let me keep acting
[1:32:24] like a message believer make me a
[1:32:26] message believe me
[1:32:28] I don't want to be a church member I
[1:32:30] don't want to be this I want to be your
[1:32:32] son I want to be your daughter I want to
[1:32:35] be your bride I need a name change and I
[1:32:38] need you to touch something in me
[1:32:40] that'll cause me to lose confidence in
[1:32:42] this flesh and change me
[1:32:44] change the way I walk change the way I
[1:32:46] talk change the way I think God
[1:32:49] Jacob could not do it to himself there
[1:32:51] is no Reformation for Jacob there was
[1:32:54] only a transformation for Jacob and the
[1:32:56] transformation come and meeting God face
[1:32:58] to face his transformation came at
[1:33:00] penniel
[1:33:02] when he met God face to face
[1:33:05] the face how are we going to meet God
[1:33:06] face to face
[1:33:08] he's taken the veil off of his word
[1:33:11] he's uncovered himself
[1:33:15] amen
[1:33:18] he's tore the veil of denomination
[1:33:22] off of the word
[1:33:24] so you can see him
[1:33:27] and the day that God was in the form of
[1:33:29] Jesus Christ the Lamb of God being slain
[1:33:32] for the sins of the world he was hanging
[1:33:34] on a cross
[1:33:35] and God reached down and he tore the
[1:33:37] veil in the temple from top to bottom
[1:33:39] because he wanted them to see where he
[1:33:42] was
[1:33:43] he wasn't there but The Mercy Seat was
[1:33:46] there hanging on that cross amen what
[1:33:48] was it the word made flesh was hanging
[1:33:50] there on the cross
[1:33:51] and he tore the veil to show he's not
[1:33:54] there that's empty now he's moved on and
[1:33:57] in this day he's torn the veil again
[1:33:59] he's torn the veil of denominations the
[1:34:02] veil of man's understanding on the word
[1:34:05] he has ripped it open to show that he's
[1:34:07] not there he's not behind that theology
[1:34:09] that understanding that interpretation
[1:34:11] where is he he's here in the opening of
[1:34:13] the word it's him it's Christ
[1:34:18] what do I do I mean it's not that you go
[1:34:21] and hug up your message books
[1:34:26] that you get a hold of this word
[1:34:28] this promised word for this day and say
[1:34:31] Lord this is your promise this is what
[1:34:33] you said this is if this is true it's
[1:34:35] got to be in me I've got to be
[1:34:37] identified I don't just have to identify
[1:34:39] it I have to be identified with it
[1:34:42] it's not good enough to say that that
[1:34:44] Prophet was Malachi 4. amen that's a
[1:34:46] wonderful thing to say and that's a
[1:34:48] wonderful Revelation to me but but the
[1:34:50] message came to identify you
[1:34:57] so that you
[1:34:58] with the clear mirror of the word
[1:35:02] can look into the word and behold face
[1:35:05] looking into face
[1:35:07] to come contact with the Living God and
[1:35:10] recognize that God wants to be a living
[1:35:12] God in you
[1:35:15] you say he's a living God where is he a
[1:35:17] living God he's a living God over there
[1:35:19] and he's a living God in that one and
[1:35:20] he's a living God in that church he's a
[1:35:22] living God and those Believers but he
[1:35:23] wants to be a living God living in you
[1:35:29] and Christ is the mystery of God
[1:35:30] revealed the prophet of God says look
[1:35:32] Christ in you makes him the center of
[1:35:35] life of the revelation
[1:35:37] Christ's life in you makes him the
[1:35:38] center of the Revelation Christ and the
[1:35:40] Bible makes the Bible the complete
[1:35:42] revelation of Christ
[1:35:45] Christ in you makes you the complete
[1:35:47] revelation of the whole thing see what
[1:35:49] God is trying to do
[1:35:51] what's God trying to do
[1:35:54] Christ in you makes you the complete
[1:35:56] revelation of the whole thing
[1:35:59] what is the revelation of this
[1:36:01] Christ in you
[1:36:05] we can study and read and study and read
[1:36:07] and study and read and still never come
[1:36:09] to the understanding
[1:36:10] what this what he's trying to do is get
[1:36:12] you to see yourself
[1:36:14] and every story and every time he's
[1:36:16] trying to get you to see you're like
[1:36:18] this and you're like this and you're the
[1:36:20] same kind of person
[1:36:22] you're the same kind of seed you're in
[1:36:24] the same kind of lineage you're in these
[1:36:25] same kind of circumstances I'm the same
[1:36:27] kind of God
[1:36:29] nothing's changed I want you to see
[1:36:31] yourself I want you to see yourself in
[1:36:33] Esther and I want you to see yourself in
[1:36:35] Ruth and I want you to see yourself in
[1:36:36] Mary I want you to I want you to be able
[1:36:39] to look and see Faith shining back at
[1:36:42] face
[1:36:43] and recognize Who You Are
[1:36:47] what is the new birth then you say well
[1:36:50] brother man what is the new birth it is
[1:36:52] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:36:53] personally to you
[1:36:57] now you joined a church you shook a hand
[1:36:59] you've done something different you said
[1:37:00] Creed you promised to live by a code of
[1:37:02] rules but Christ the Bible he is the
[1:37:06] word that was revealed to you and no
[1:37:08] matter what anybody else says what takes
[1:37:09] place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever
[1:37:12] it might be it's Christ in you that is
[1:37:14] the Revelation that the church was built
[1:37:16] upon
[1:37:18] that's what he wants us to understand
[1:37:23] when
[1:37:25] when Jacob the sir planter come in
[1:37:28] contact with the manifested word
[1:37:32] when he came in contact with that
[1:37:35] something in him knew that this was the
[1:37:38] thing that could deliver me
[1:37:42] is there anything in you that knows that
[1:37:44] this revealed word
[1:37:46] this message is the thing that can
[1:37:48] deliver you
[1:37:50] it is what else is there what church
[1:37:54] what form of theology what understanding
[1:37:56] where else are you going to find to get
[1:37:58] delivered from this condition we're in
[1:38:01] this word that's been revealed in this
[1:38:03] day at the opening of the seals the word
[1:38:05] the mystery of God that has been
[1:38:07] unveiled and the unveiling of God that's
[1:38:09] presented itself here is the very thing
[1:38:11] that can deliver us
[1:38:13] and when he came in contact with that in
[1:38:16] his day he got a hold of it and refused
[1:38:18] to let go until he was changed
[1:38:22] and I would encourage you if you're
[1:38:24] something in you that's stirring and
[1:38:25] says this message is the only thing that
[1:38:28] can deliver
[1:38:30] then get a hold of it don't let it be
[1:38:32] somebody else's you get a hold of it
[1:38:34] don't let somebody else grab a grip on
[1:38:36] it you get a hold of it and hold on to
[1:38:38] it until it changes you
[1:38:41] and say God it's got to change me you've
[1:38:45] got to change me I've got to be
[1:38:47] different I've got to be changed
[1:38:52] and then when that word is open
[1:38:55] and it goes back and reveals
[1:38:58] all the fallacy of denominationalism
[1:39:03] the 2 000 years of man's Concepts and
[1:39:06] ideas bring ruined Nation to the church
[1:39:09] when it goes back and shows false
[1:39:11] Doctrine and false content and sincere
[1:39:13] men who love God who were doing their
[1:39:15] very best
[1:39:17] you understand these weren't people who
[1:39:19] hated God Amen that were getting off and
[1:39:21] who were believing wrong things these
[1:39:24] were people who loved God were sincere
[1:39:26] and desired to know God we're doing the
[1:39:28] best they could to study God's word and
[1:39:31] teach the understanding they had of
[1:39:32] God's word and they were doing it wrong
[1:39:35] because the the the veil wasn't taken
[1:39:37] off that portion of the word yet
[1:39:40] and when God in the in the opening of
[1:39:42] the word takes us back down through
[1:39:44] history and shows us failure after
[1:39:46] failure after failure after failure it's
[1:39:49] the same as God touching Jacob and the
[1:39:51] sinew of his thigh you realize I can't
[1:39:54] do it amen I can't figure God out I
[1:39:58] can't come up with it on my own I can't
[1:40:00] do right
[1:40:02] in my flesh I can do nothing amen and
[1:40:05] there's a realization that comes with
[1:40:08] this Revelation and how foolish man is
[1:40:10] and how much God's children have messed
[1:40:13] up God's plan
[1:40:16] to where for the rest of your life you
[1:40:19] never trust yourself again
[1:40:22] for the rest of your life you never
[1:40:24] trust your thinking that's why you read
[1:40:26] the Bible and you'd be like oh I bet
[1:40:27] that means that and the first thing you
[1:40:29] do is say what did God teach through the
[1:40:31] prophets
[1:40:35] because now you're limping you're not so
[1:40:38] sure of your steady walk you're not so
[1:40:40] sure that you can figure this Bible out
[1:40:43] and you read it and you hear somebody
[1:40:44] say oh that sounds good I think that's
[1:40:46] what that means and then you go back to
[1:40:48] the message you find it's taught
[1:40:49] completely different in the message and
[1:40:51] you realize thank you God
[1:40:53] I don't have any more confidence in the
[1:40:55] flesh none of my old abilities are going
[1:40:57] to save me anymore
[1:41:02] that's what happened to Jacob when he
[1:41:04] met God face to face that's what happens
[1:41:06] to us when we meet God face to face we
[1:41:08] don't lean on our own understanding
[1:41:10] anymore
[1:41:11] we don't lean on our own abilities and
[1:41:13] our own Concepts and our own strength
[1:41:15] you realize I don't have the strength to
[1:41:18] live this message
[1:41:21] we're talking just the flesh side
[1:41:23] when you get to the flashlight I do not
[1:41:25] have the strength to live this message
[1:41:27] what is the call in this message the
[1:41:29] call is to live the very life of Jesus
[1:41:31] Christ in your flesh
[1:41:33] what he would say you would say what he
[1:41:34] would do you would do
[1:41:37] you realize how impossible that is
[1:41:41] if it's not for him
[1:41:44] he's got to come and live it through us
[1:41:47] I've got these got to change me
[1:41:49] if he this message
[1:41:52] handicap My Flesh
[1:41:56] this message wrecked my life
[1:42:01] if I could take you back
[1:42:03] 20 something years 23 years
[1:42:06] take you back when I was first married
[1:42:10] and been raised in Pentecostal churches
[1:42:12] and knew I knew the Bible
[1:42:16] I was raised all my life
[1:42:19] my pastor was my great uncle my grandpa
[1:42:21] was one of the ministers in the church I
[1:42:23] mean we were we were raised and we were
[1:42:25] clean living and we had moral standard
[1:42:28] we believe the King James version of the
[1:42:30] Bible and preached out of it and and all
[1:42:32] of these other things we had it all just
[1:42:34] right and everything was fine in my life
[1:42:36] and I was first married and had a baby
[1:42:38] do on the way and bought a new home and
[1:42:41] everything was perfect
[1:42:44] and I was going in My Own Strength
[1:42:48] and God brought the message along and
[1:42:50] wrecked my whole life
[1:42:53] knocked every prop out from under me I
[1:42:56] lost confidence in everything I'd ever
[1:42:57] been taught I lost confidence in my
[1:42:59] ability to even think morally
[1:43:02] I lost confidence in my ability to live
[1:43:04] a clean life I lost confidence in
[1:43:06] everything that I had of self and
[1:43:08] everything that I'd used before to be a
[1:43:10] good church member and a nice boy and a
[1:43:13] good Pentecostal church God knocked it
[1:43:15] right out from under me and from that
[1:43:16] point on I have limped in the flesh
[1:43:18] because I know I cannot do this
[1:43:22] I know what I was before and I know how
[1:43:24] I failed before and I know what he's
[1:43:26] done for me and I don't want to be
[1:43:29] strong in my flesh
[1:43:33] when Paul came to the Lord amen and he
[1:43:36] met him on the road to Damascus Paul was
[1:43:37] strong Paul was able Paul had
[1:43:40] intelligence Paul had a good standing in
[1:43:42] the church but what did God do God
[1:43:44] struck him amen and he he weakened him
[1:43:47] and he gave him a thorn in the flesh and
[1:43:49] he weakened Paul amen and Paul wanted it
[1:43:51] to go away but he said my strength is
[1:43:53] made perfect in your weakness and now
[1:43:55] Paul had no more confidence in his
[1:43:57] education no more confidence and ability
[1:43:59] no more confidence in his lineages or
[1:44:02] his attachments to the high priest
[1:44:05] he gave it all up and he will walk the
[1:44:08] week through this world but Mighty in
[1:44:10] God
[1:44:13] brother Branham never had anything
[1:44:16] going for him
[1:44:18] he never had he never had physical
[1:44:20] strength he was racked with sickness
[1:44:22] from the beginning of his ministry
[1:44:25] he never had attachment or finances or
[1:44:28] education but that's exactly what God
[1:44:30] wanted to display himself
[1:44:33] he didn't have that prophet of God had
[1:44:35] no confidence in his flesh
[1:44:37] he had confidence in the word of God
[1:44:40] Paul had no confidence in his flesh he
[1:44:42] had confidence in the word of God and we
[1:44:44] need to have no confidence in our flesh
[1:44:46] but confidence in the word of God
[1:44:49] say God
[1:44:51] strike us
[1:44:54] Smite us Lord
[1:44:56] so we no longer think we can walk right
[1:44:58] without you
[1:45:00] but no longer we think we can do
[1:45:02] something we can't do anything
[1:45:05] without him
[1:45:07] the greatest gift that he gave to Jacob
[1:45:09] was a halting walk
[1:45:12] when Jacob no longer had any strength
[1:45:16] that's when Jacob became strong
[1:45:20] I want to look
[1:45:23] I want to look at Genesis 33 as we
[1:45:25] finish
[1:45:28] we'll just finish with this
[1:45:42] Genesis 33
[1:45:46] verse 1.
[1:45:53] and Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked
[1:45:55] and behold Esau came and with him 400
[1:45:58] men
[1:45:59] and he divided the children unto Lee and
[1:46:01] unto Rachel and unto the two handmaids
[1:46:03] and he put the handmaids and their
[1:46:04] children foremost and Lee and her
[1:46:06] children after Rachel and after and
[1:46:09] Rachel and Joseph hinder most
[1:46:11] and look at this and he passed over
[1:46:14] before them
[1:46:16] instead of coming last now he goes first
[1:46:20] what happened to Jacob the coward was
[1:46:23] now limping up in front
[1:46:26] he was scared he wanted to go behind us
[1:46:28] and everything first and he wanted him
[1:46:29] to see the women and children and
[1:46:30] everything before they come to him but
[1:46:32] now he's been smitten he's been
[1:46:34] Afflicted he's come in contact with God
[1:46:36] but he's not afraid of Esau anymore
[1:46:40] because now he's not looking at his own
[1:46:43] strength or his ability he has no
[1:46:45] ability to deceive he's got nothing
[1:46:46] going but now he goes out in front
[1:46:50] he takes his position
[1:46:52] and he bowed himself to the ground
[1:46:56] and bound himself to the ground and
[1:46:58] seven times until he came near to his
[1:47:00] brother
[1:47:01] and brother bear says in the evening
[1:47:02] messenger he says Jacob on his road home
[1:47:04] inspired to go back home his brother was
[1:47:07] meeting him old but one night he
[1:47:08] wrestled with God he was scared to meet
[1:47:10] his brother but the next morning he was
[1:47:12] Fearless limping Prince he was a
[1:47:15] Fearless limping Prince
[1:47:18] I don't need Esau nor his army neither
[1:47:20] one God stepped on the scene see he does
[1:47:23] it in a peculiar way
[1:47:26] let's look at verse 8 now
[1:47:29] this is Esau speaking he says and he
[1:47:32] said what meanest thou all this drove
[1:47:34] which I met and he said these are to
[1:47:35] find Grace in the sight of my Lord
[1:47:37] and Esau said I have enough my brother
[1:47:39] keep thou
[1:47:41] keep that thou Hast unto thyself and
[1:47:44] Jacob said nay I pray thee if now I
[1:47:46] found Grace in thy sight then received
[1:47:48] my present at my hand for therefore I
[1:47:50] have seen thy face as though I had seen
[1:47:52] the face of God and that was pleased
[1:47:54] with me
[1:47:55] take I pray thee my blessing that is
[1:47:57] brought to thee because God hath dealt
[1:47:58] graciously with me and because I have
[1:48:01] enough and he urged him and he took him
[1:48:03] I want to I want to look at this
[1:48:06] Jacob had never before said he had
[1:48:09] enough
[1:48:13] never had Jacob had enough
[1:48:15] he always wanted more
[1:48:17] he was always working to get more but
[1:48:19] now he had met God and the things that
[1:48:21] mattered to him before don't matter to
[1:48:23] him anymore and now that Esau is being
[1:48:26] kind to his brother
[1:48:30] Esau before I believe would have took
[1:48:32] him back
[1:48:34] but this Esau said nope you take him I
[1:48:37] have enough
[1:48:39] why he had God
[1:48:42] and he urged him and he took it and he
[1:48:44] said let us take our journey and let us
[1:48:46] go and I will go before thee now Esau's
[1:48:49] offering to lead the way
[1:48:51] now listen Jacob's afraid he was
[1:48:54] he's always afraid he was afraid to meet
[1:48:56] Laban he was afraid to meet Esau he's
[1:48:59] always been afraid
[1:49:00] now Esau's offering a guarded escort
[1:49:04] he said in verse 13 He said unto him my
[1:49:07] Lord knoweth that the children are
[1:49:08] tender and the flocks and the herds with
[1:49:10] young are with me and if men should
[1:49:11] overdrive them one day all the flock
[1:49:13] will die let my Lord I pray thee pass
[1:49:16] over before his servant and I will lead
[1:49:18] on softly according as the cattle as the
[1:49:21] cattle uh
[1:49:23] sorry as the cattle that goeth before me
[1:49:25] and the children be able to endure until
[1:49:27] I come unto my Lord and to see her and
[1:49:30] Esau said let me now leave with thee
[1:49:32] some of the folks that are with me and
[1:49:34] he said what needed what needeth it let
[1:49:37] me find Grace in the sight of my Lord so
[1:49:39] Esau returned that day on his way in to
[1:49:41] see her
[1:49:43] this man who was afraid because he
[1:49:45] looked at himself he's come in contact
[1:49:48] with God and now he's no longer afraid
[1:49:50] to be by himself
[1:49:53] he's not afraid to go on with himself
[1:49:55] he's not afraid they're going without
[1:49:57] Esau's leading he's not afraid to go
[1:49:59] without the the armed men that he left
[1:50:02] with him because now he's come in
[1:50:04] contact with the Living God he's no
[1:50:06] longer afraid to be by himself
[1:50:09] this is what brother bam said
[1:50:12] Jacob stayed all night one night
[1:50:14] wrestling
[1:50:15] that wrestling Prince he wrestled all
[1:50:17] night he had been dodging Esau here and
[1:50:19] there he was scared to death of him and
[1:50:21] he heard Esau was coming he put his wife
[1:50:23] across the brook went over on the other
[1:50:25] side and knelt down you know God come
[1:50:27] down and got a hold of Jacob and they
[1:50:29] wrestled all night he wasn't completely
[1:50:31] convinced to start with
[1:50:33] but time God got through with him he was
[1:50:35] convinced yes he stayed and held on
[1:50:37] until he was convinced that it was gone
[1:50:39] brother he wasn't scared of Esau then
[1:50:42] crossed the river and he was weak and
[1:50:44] limping the worst time that he could be
[1:50:46] in looked like he was the weakest he
[1:50:49] ever was he had been crippled and
[1:50:51] everything but Esau said to him will you
[1:50:53] let me send an army along with you to
[1:50:55] help you said I don't even need the help
[1:50:58] why he was convinced that God that had a
[1:51:01] hold of that the God he had a hold of
[1:51:03] could take care of him
[1:51:06] I say thank you Lord Jesus
[1:51:09] I want that kind of experience to where
[1:51:12] I can get a hold of a living God where I
[1:51:15] don't need a group around me to feel
[1:51:17] secure
[1:51:18] where I don't need protection where we
[1:51:21] don't need armies where we don't need
[1:51:22] defenses either ourselves or anybody
[1:51:24] else's but we can get to a place where
[1:51:26] though I'm weak and though I recognize I
[1:51:29] have no ability I know everything's fine
[1:51:31] because I met a living God and I know
[1:51:33] his promise is no longer if but it is
[1:51:35] when
[1:51:37] that's what that's what Jacob recognized
[1:51:42] brother Branham said in the message
[1:51:43] perfect strength by Perfect weakness
[1:51:45] oh what a preacher this great man he
[1:51:48] sought God he said God I am weak he's
[1:51:50] talking about the Apostle Paul I don't
[1:51:51] know what to do I just pray God give me
[1:51:53] strength take my infirmities away from
[1:51:55] me and these things so I can be stronger
[1:51:57] God spoke back to him and said Paul my
[1:51:59] strength is made perfect in your
[1:52:01] weakness then Paul said when I'm weak
[1:52:03] then then I am strong yes he said I will
[1:52:07] glorify in my infirmities and my
[1:52:09] weaknesses and so forth I'm thanking God
[1:52:12] that I got all of it out of me
[1:52:14] and when I get everything out of me then
[1:52:15] God can come in but as long as I got
[1:52:18] some of myself there then God can't get
[1:52:20] in
[1:52:21] there that's it we smother him out
[1:52:24] we drive him away from the poor of us to
[1:52:27] the richest of us from the least to the
[1:52:29] greatest we keep God out of our Lives
[1:52:31] because of our own selves
[1:52:34] I said God let me get my own self out of
[1:52:38] the way
[1:52:40] again in the same message he says
[1:52:43] brother ma'am is now talking about the
[1:52:45] time he went to see oral Robert's office
[1:52:47] and he stepped out of that great campus
[1:52:49] and he saw the great buildings and he
[1:52:51] had that thought maybe God couldn't
[1:52:53] trust me with this much money maybe God
[1:52:55] just couldn't trust me
[1:52:57] with this
[1:52:59] and this is where he's talking about he
[1:53:01] says remember standing by A Great temple
[1:53:03] one time said Lord I hate for them to
[1:53:05] come to my office
[1:53:07] he said I am your portion
[1:53:10] who needs an office then
[1:53:15] who needs an office who needs a facility
[1:53:17] who needs a salary who needs anything
[1:53:19] when God himself said I am your portion
[1:53:23] I am your portion see I am your portion
[1:53:27] and weakness then my strength is strong
[1:53:30] my perfect will can be done Paul or
[1:53:33] Elijah whoever you are when you get out
[1:53:36] of the way in your weakness then I'm
[1:53:38] made strong I'm the one I'm the strong
[1:53:41] one that comes in and fills up
[1:53:45] I want to meet a living God
[1:53:48] I want to come face to face with the god
[1:53:51] in this day that's presented himself and
[1:53:53] made himself available to the believer
[1:53:55] in this day and I want in that meeting
[1:53:57] with him I want him to change me
[1:54:00] I want to be weakened I mean that sounds
[1:54:04] terrible but I want no more confidence
[1:54:06] in the flesh
[1:54:09] that's what meeting God has done no more
[1:54:11] confidence in the flesh he's so great
[1:54:14] and the fallacy of humanity is so
[1:54:16] exposed and the Fallen nature of man
[1:54:18] from The Garden of Eden's been so
[1:54:19] exposed that I want no more confidence I
[1:54:22] want in my flesh to be weakened
[1:54:25] because if I can be weakened In the
[1:54:27] Flesh he can be made strong
[1:54:30] because his strength is made perfect in
[1:54:33] my weakness
[1:54:34] I want to come in contact with the
[1:54:36] Living God that doesn't make me feel
[1:54:37] like I you know that I'm the man I can
[1:54:41] do this and I'll go out there and I'll
[1:54:43] take charge and I'll do that and I'll do
[1:54:45] this I want to have the contact with God
[1:54:47] that says I tried everything and failed
[1:54:49] and everything if anything's going to
[1:54:51] happen it's not me it's going to be him
[1:54:52] and me
[1:54:55] I want to walk with that kind of
[1:54:57] humility like Paul had and brother
[1:54:58] banham had and
[1:55:00] Isaiah came to and that Jacob came to
[1:55:04] and I want the kind of meeting face to
[1:55:06] face with God that gives me a true
[1:55:09] identity of who I really am
[1:55:12] Jacob was called Sir planter
[1:55:14] but he was Israel
[1:55:17] and I've been called whatever I've been
[1:55:19] called not even bad names good names
[1:55:21] good boy and Chad and whatever
[1:55:24] but there's one name I want more than
[1:55:25] any other
[1:55:27] there's one identification that changes
[1:55:29] everything in my life and that's when he
[1:55:31] called me bride
[1:55:34] when he called me Mrs Jesus Christ it
[1:55:37] changed everything
[1:55:39] now I know who I am
[1:55:42] I know why I'm here
[1:55:44] I'm not here for all those selfish
[1:55:46] reasons I had before I'm not here for
[1:55:48] that
[1:55:49] that's not the life that he wants from
[1:55:51] me amen the meeting with God has
[1:55:54] weakened My Flesh praise God I have no
[1:55:57] confidence and it's given me an
[1:55:58] identification of who I really am and
[1:56:01] has brought me in contact with the
[1:56:03] living Jesus Christ today
[1:56:05] so that's the encounter that we all need
[1:56:08] I mean is that the encounter you want to
[1:56:10] have
[1:56:11] is here
[1:56:13] it's available
[1:56:15] you don't have to run to the mountain
[1:56:17] you don't have to go to the desert you
[1:56:19] don't have to go to a certain church or
[1:56:21] a certain building or a certain Ministry
[1:56:23] you've got to come to Christ the word
[1:56:26] that's been made manifest in this day
[1:56:29] come to The Living Word come face to
[1:56:32] face with the Living God and let him
[1:56:34] change you
[1:56:36] man let's all stand musicians if you'll
[1:56:38] come
[1:56:40] I just want to stop right there and
[1:56:42] we'll get to the rest of it some other
[1:56:44] time
[1:56:46] but oh how
[1:56:48] we need him
[1:56:52] you would think these meetings with God
[1:56:56] these encounters with God
[1:56:59] that all these
[1:57:00] people have had
[1:57:02] that it would have made them 10 foot
[1:57:04] tall and Bulletproof
[1:57:07] but it made Moses afraid to go
[1:57:10] it made brother Branham realize how
[1:57:12] little he was
[1:57:14] it made the Apostle Paul realize that
[1:57:16] everything he ever knew he had to count
[1:57:18] his dung
[1:57:20] and that all of that he had going for
[1:57:22] him was not
[1:57:23] that it made Jacob realize that he was a
[1:57:26] failure to begin with
[1:57:28] these meetings with God they have a way
[1:57:31] of changing us for the better but not
[1:57:33] for self-betterment in a humanistic way
[1:57:37] this isn't self-help and you be a better
[1:57:40] person
[1:57:41] this is you come into contact with the
[1:57:43] Living God and recognize that I am
[1:57:45] nothing without this
[1:57:47] that I can't save myself I can't help
[1:57:49] myself that this is the only reality
[1:57:51] that there is and I'll not let this go
[1:57:54] until it changes me
[1:57:57] amen that's my desire for everyone
[1:58:00] every every person every child of God I
[1:58:03] want us all have the same experience
[1:58:05] however it comes and whatever and
[1:58:08] whatever way that God meets you and
[1:58:10] however he speaks to your heart and
[1:58:12] however you get a hold of him it doesn't
[1:58:14] matter how that's not what I'm concerned
[1:58:16] with I don't care if it's in church or
[1:58:18] out of church I don't care if it comes
[1:58:19] with sensation or no sensation but when
[1:58:22] you come in contact with God and you
[1:58:24] know that you're in contact with a
[1:58:25] living God and that changes you and
[1:58:28] changes the way you walk and changes the
[1:58:30] way you think
[1:58:31] that's what we need
[1:58:33] I said God let that be a reality in this
[1:58:37] place today let it be a reality in our
[1:58:39] lives
[1:58:40] that's what we want
[1:58:42] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[1:58:44] together
[1:58:46] oh heavenly father I thank you Lord
[1:58:50] for the word that you have given to us
[1:58:54] God I'm so thankful
[1:58:56] that in this generation
[1:58:59] you're speaking face to face
[1:59:01] to your children
[1:59:04] Lord there's no more obscurity
[1:59:07] there's no more cloudiness
[1:59:10] you rip the veil of denominational
[1:59:12] understanding
[1:59:14] you tore it open
[1:59:16] to show us that you're here
[1:59:18] you're here in the revealing of your
[1:59:20] word you're present in your word
[1:59:23] [Music]
[1:59:24] go on that word is to be made manifest
[1:59:27] in a people
[1:59:29] your desire for this day is to get
[1:59:31] preeminence in your bride
[1:59:34] that's the word made flesh in this day
[1:59:37] God help us to embrace that
[1:59:41] God forgive us for our foolishness Lord
[1:59:45] forgive us Lord for our Jacob mentality
[1:59:48] of hoping and if and
[1:59:51] but God bring us into that personal
[1:59:53] contact
[1:59:55] God
[1:59:56] Moses wasn't able to find you you found
[1:59:58] him
[2:00:00] Paul wasn't able to find you you found
[2:00:02] him
[2:00:04] God all down through you knew how to
[2:00:06] find your people
[2:00:07] when it came time to send out your
[2:00:10] Prophet you came to him
[2:00:12] God I prayed that you would present
[2:00:14] yourself to your children now
[2:00:16] that there's any here Lord who's not
[2:00:18] coming to personal contact with you and
[2:00:21] been born again by your spirit I pray
[2:00:23] you would come to them now
[2:00:25] may they recognize that you're here Lord
[2:00:27] that you're present may you present
[2:00:29] yourself to them and give them an
[2:00:31] opportunity to grab a hold Lord
