TRANSCRIPT
========================================
calling jesus on the scene he says we need a book of acts again but the only way you'll do it is to get back to the bible how many wants a book of acts how many wants manifestations and gifts and a book of acts he says the only way you'll produce that is if you get back to the bible if you get back to the word see i fear sometimes that we're seeking things that are not evil that are not sinful they're actually of god and worthy of seeking but we're seeking the wrong thing in the wrong way we're seeking to produce something ourselves we're seeking a manifestation to produce within ourself instead of seeking the word and allowing it to produce something so we're trying to get the cart before the horse he says get back to the bible and away from some of this hybrid religion you're a christian because you are born in the spirit of christ and the word of god lives in you i fear that that definition of the book of acts would differ from some of the definitions of the book of acts that i've heard taught because he's saying you want to get back to a book of acts we need a book of acts and then he says you're a christian because you're born of the spirit of god and the word of god lives in you see there's lots of things that go on in the book of acts and a lot of them are very dynamic and don't think for a second that i don't want those i want them i want them all i want more of them but what i don't want is all of them and miss the word of god living in me that is the main point of the book of acts remember the book of acts is based upon what peter had to say when he came out of the upper room and what peter had to say is this word of god right here is what you're seeing right here this word of god that you see in job that's what you're seeing right here that's the book of acts now as that progressed there was multitudes of manifestations from that but if they ever deviated away from the point of being able to say this right here that you see is this right here they've missed the book of acts
