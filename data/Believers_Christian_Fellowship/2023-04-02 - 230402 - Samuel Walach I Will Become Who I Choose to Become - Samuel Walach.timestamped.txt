[11:19] a minute
[11:20] amen it's good to be here today
[11:24] man it's good to have brother Samuel Val
[11:26] walk with us from Poland he had a hard
[11:28] time getting here let me tell you
[11:30] friends it seems like since kova the
[11:32] airlines have not got everything fixed
[11:34] yet they're still in a bad shape brother
[11:36] Samuel was supposed to come in on Friday
[11:38] evening at Fort Wayne and I drove over
[11:41] to pick him up he was going to land
[11:42] about 8 30 something like that
[11:45] everything was perfect except he got
[11:49] stuck in Minneapolis because they didn't
[11:50] have a flight crew that could take his
[11:51] plane from Minneapolis to Fort Wayne so
[11:53] they waited until there was an ice and
[11:56] snowstorm in Minneapolis that caused
[11:57] them to have de-icing situations and
[12:00] delays and so then they finally Florida
[12:02] flew to Fort Wayne after many hours of
[12:04] delay and as they were coming into Fort
[12:06] Wayne there was a tornado Landing in
[12:08] Fort Wayne so they diverted to Detroit
[12:10] landed in Detroit was supposed to refuel
[12:13] and fly to Fort Wayne well then they
[12:15] found out that the pilots were going to
[12:17] time out on their daily allowance so
[12:18] they had to spend the night in Detroit
[12:21] and then then they are going to catch an
[12:23] early flight then so I drove back home
[12:25] then drove back to Fort Wayne in the
[12:27] morning because he was going to get an
[12:28] early flight when he gets to the airport
[12:30] for his early flight they tell him that
[12:32] the pilots haven't had enough time off
[12:34] so they're going to delay their flight
[12:36] to 12 30. so it
[12:39] at one o'clock they got on the plane and
[12:42] sat on the plane for an hour and a half
[12:43] waiting for somebody to fuel the plane
[12:45] so that they could fly to Fort Wayne
[12:47] I said well praise God this is going to
[12:50] be a wonderful service and a wonderful
[12:51] day and God is good anyhow so we got
[12:54] there late uh then when he
[12:57] then we went to the luggage carousel and
[13:01] no luggage came out
[13:02] so we went to file a claim and they told
[13:04] him that his luggage is still in
[13:06] Amsterdam
[13:07] so we had to go shopping so he could buy
[13:11] enough clothes to preach this morning
[13:15] I tell you what
[13:18] you know what if they praise the Lord
[13:19] anyhow you know you just go on and I
[13:22] think brother Samuel is the other
[13:23] brother I met that disliked shopping as

[13:28] election we like it let's go we were in
[13:30] and out amen we know how to shop amen

[29:15] amen the full seven course menu
[29:18] Hallelujah for all the Seven Seals are
[29:21] opened and everything is ready for the
[29:23] word of God to those who
[29:27] isn't that a powerful quote amen we are
[29:29] not feeding on some rabbits amen that
[29:32] was the right in the time of Luther
[29:33] that's the extent of light that they had
[29:35] and there was another promise after the
[29:38] days of Luther they were promised
[29:39] something more but we are promised
[29:42] something totally out of the league of
[29:45] Luther and Wesley amen can you agree
[29:47] with that amen he's been good to us he
[29:50] sent us his message amen it wasn't a
[29:53] sealed book but he brought the book that
[29:57] is open amen he opened the Seven Seals
[29:59] for us amen so that we will we could
[30:02] partake of the full Square meal amen the
[30:06] full seven course menu amen I was just
[30:09] thinking about that you know because
[30:10] whenever you go to a restaurant uh it
[30:14] may be a good restaurant right amen but
[30:16] it's not always true that you would get
[30:18] seven meals right a seven course menu so
[30:22] that is a special kind of restaurants
[30:24] there is something out of the ordinary
[30:26] it is not for Ordinary People to go to
[30:29] such a restaurant to partake of such
[30:31] kind of food amen you need to be a
[30:34] special person and that needs to be a
[30:36] special place amen I believe that we can
[30:39] relate amen can we relate to that are we
[30:42] the special people amen are we in the
[30:44] special place have we received a special
[30:47] message amen so it's a different kind of
[30:50] eating when you go to such an upscale
[30:53] restaurant amen you're not there to
[30:55] stuff yourself with food amen you are
[30:58] not going there just to just to satisfy
[31:00] your natural needs amen you just go
[31:03] there for the experience amen praise the
[31:06] Lord there is something different you go
[31:08] there to discover new tastes new
[31:10] combinations amen because there is
[31:12] somebody it's not that that the food
[31:15] came pre-packaged but there is somebody
[31:17] behind the scenes that is the Master
[31:20] Chef amen and he is the one who who does
[31:23] the difference amen he's the one
[31:25] responsible for all of the me deals amen
[31:28] so we may see different people coming
[31:30] and ministering you can see your pastor
[31:32] you can see this preacher or that
[31:34] preacher but let us realize one thing
[31:37] that we don't want to bring anything of
[31:39] our own we are just servers amen we just
[31:42] serve the food that the Master Chef
[31:45] prepared himself amen so praise the Lord
[31:48] so he wants to take us today on a
[31:50] special Journey Amen to discover new
[31:53] tastes to discover new flavors new
[31:55] combinations sometimes the combinations
[31:57] can be shocking you mean you you know if
[32:01] you go to an upscale restaurant with
[32:03] seven course menu and I don't believe
[32:05] that they will serve you a burger amen
[32:08] it's all right to eat a burger amen but
[32:10] you don't expect a burger Amen in such a
[32:13] place amen that's something different
[32:15] amen so you don't go there just not to
[32:19] die out of hunger amen you don't go
[32:21] there to stock up food Amen to eat
[32:23] because you don't know what will happen
[32:25] tomorrow amen maybe these are not big
[32:28] chunks of food maybe these are small
[32:30] plates amen but they tell a certain
[32:33] story amen and I believe that when we
[32:36] feed on the word of God when we feed on
[32:38] the message we can see the story amen we
[32:42] need to see the story behind the food
[32:44] amen it's not just food to eat and to
[32:46] survive because in laodicea amen we are
[32:50] not just survivors
[32:51] amen we didn't come here just to survive
[32:54] laodicea amen we came here for a
[32:57] different purpose we came here to be
[33:00] victorious in this age amen and that is
[33:02] something different amen praise the Lord
[33:05] aren't you glad for that amen so this
[33:08] kind of food is reserved just for
[33:10] special people amen and I believe it is
[33:13] said in Hebrews that is reserved for the
[33:16] people whose senses are exercised by
[33:19] reason of use amen we need to exercise
[33:22] our senses Amen to appreciate the word
[33:25] of God to appreciate what was sent our
[33:28] way this time amen praise the Lord so
[33:31] that seven chorus menu is not a food for
[33:34] beggars amen it is a food that the kind
[33:38] of food reserved for the children of God
[33:40] for the elect for the chosen priesthood
[33:43] amen for the holy nation amen praise the
[33:46] Lord so it is not a man who prepares
[33:49] that food amen is God himself
[33:52] Hallelujah when when Jesus they were uh
[33:55] in a convention together with the
[33:56] disciples and the disciples they didn't
[33:59] know what to say what to do they wanted
[34:01] to buy food they wanted to bring food
[34:03] maybe from the market from something
[34:05] that was already prepared but there was
[34:08] the Master Chef present amen and so he
[34:11] said you give them food amen but what he
[34:14] did he he just broke the bread amen he
[34:16] multiplied the fishes amen and he gave
[34:19] to the disciples to distribute amen
[34:21] praise the Lord you give them something
[34:23] to eat amen and we've been given
[34:26] something amen there's been something
[34:28] held in store for the entire bride amen
[34:32] special kind of food special kind of an
[34:34] experience that will bring you on a
[34:36] journey that will that will take you
[34:38] from the realm of that just natural
[34:40] needs of the realm of natural uh wants
[34:44] and hungers of this world it'll bring
[34:46] you on a journey that will remind you of
[34:48] the place of the time where you've been
[34:50] before the foundation of the world and
[34:52] mad
[34:53] don't you want to be a part of the
[34:55] journey amen that brings you home
[34:58] that reminds you of the taste of the
[35:01] flavors that were back home in your
[35:03] father's house amen praise the Lord
[35:05] hallelujah and the warehouse is full of
[35:08] good food amen we can agree with that
[35:11] amen we don't want to we don't need to
[35:13] search here and there run to and fro
[35:15] just go and follow every wind of
[35:17] Doctrine something new something shiny
[35:19] we've been given the the the the the the
[35:22] best kind of food that's been stored for
[35:24] us amen praise the Lord and that's why
[35:27] we need his presence amen that's why the
[35:30] food tastes so good in this hour because
[35:32] he is here because the Master Chef is
[35:34] here it is not something uh pre-prepared
[35:37] it's not something that's been warned up
[35:40] in a microwave wave amen it is something
[35:43] that came straight from the hands of the
[35:45] Master Chef amen praise the Lord so we
[35:48] know that these ingredients for for for
[35:51] the end time Bride for the seventh
[35:53] course menu they were always available
[35:55] amen because the word was sent God sent
[35:58] his word amen but there were people who
[36:01] couldn't understand who couldn't grasp
[36:04] the new tastes amen couldn't grasp the
[36:07] the the the flavors that were attached
[36:09] to the word of God Amen but until the
[36:12] last day amen there's been a change
[36:15] there's been a people sent amen they are
[36:18] able to receive the word that are able
[36:20] to respond to the word that the word
[36:22] resonates with them it is something that
[36:25] reminds them of things that were before
[36:28] amen because we've got an intelligence
[36:31] we have the mind of Christ in this hour
[36:33] the intelligence of the Master Chef came
[36:35] down amen and he is able amen we are not
[36:39] able we can mix things up with the word
[36:41] of God and we see all of the
[36:43] denominations
[36:44] and you know we sing the song the angel
[36:46] of the Lord told Mary and there is a
[36:48] verse that says there are a thousand
[36:50] denominations right amen but I just
[36:53] checked there are 30 000 denominations
[36:55] wow
[36:57] from just on the basis of one book amen
[37:00] because not knowing the author it will
[37:03] just bring you to a place where you'll
[37:05] mix different things from the word but
[37:08] the result will be death amen but we
[37:10] have the intelligence in this time he
[37:13] knows how to break the word he knows how
[37:15] to take the word and paint a picture
[37:17] before our eyes amen praise the lord we
[37:21] are so thankful for the opening for the
[37:23] opening of the potentials the potentials
[37:26] of of God Amen in this hour
[37:29] so you know like we said you know it's
[37:31] it's maybe it's not been an easy week or
[37:35] or a weekend for us maybe some of our us
[37:38] are tired you know from either traveling
[37:40] or or or just working on the stuff that
[37:43] was broken uh because of the storm you
[37:46] know but we come here on the basis of
[37:48] the word of God we don't come here
[37:50] because we felt so that uh you know we
[37:54] had a wonderful experience maybe uh this
[37:56] morning of of just wanting to come here
[37:58] maybe you're that way but I don't feel
[38:01] that that good amen amen hopefully I
[38:05] just trust in the inspiration of the
[38:07] Lord I've got the shoes of brother Joe
[38:09] so I'll be in the same aspiration as he
[38:11] is amen we are thinking from the same
[38:13] Source we are thinking from the same
[38:15] warehouse amen amen so we need that so
[38:18] we are believing Against All Odds we
[38:22] come here not because we feel so not
[38:24] because uh somebody made us do it amen
[38:28] we come here because we trust God we
[38:31] believe in God Amen we believe that he's
[38:33] the one who who orchestrates everything
[38:36] in our life whether good or bad amen
[38:38] amen he's responsible he is behind the
[38:41] scenes we just want to see him Amen in
[38:44] the time of unrest we see unrest in the
[38:47] world today we see wars and rumors of
[38:49] wars and things going uh you know in a
[38:52] bad Direction chaos all over the world
[38:56] but we have received the message of
[38:58] Shalom amen that is contrary to what the
[39:01] world will tell you it is contrary to
[39:04] what the world will make you feel or say
[39:06] or do or even uh it'll try to occupy
[39:10] your mind to to to think in a certain
[39:12] way uh but we need to go back to the
[39:15] word amen like Abraham
[39:18] he just he just didn't see the things
[39:20] that were supposed to come amen he
[39:22] didn't see the word being uh
[39:26] manifested in his life for him or a
[39:28] number of years amen he just saw the
[39:31] opposite of that he he saw his weakening
[39:33] old body he saw the body of Sarah his
[39:36] wife
[39:37] but yet amen he looked to the Unseen
[39:40] amen he he called the things that were
[39:44] not as if they were amen he saw
[39:46] something with the side of Faith amen we
[39:49] need that sense in this hour praise the
[39:52] Lord so before there was a even a
[39:54] question
[39:55] we as humans we've got lots of questions
[39:57] right amen little children they've got
[40:00] lots of questions uh maybe as adults
[40:02] we've got questions maybe we don't like
[40:04] to share them or voice them but the Lord
[40:07] knows our questions amen but we are so
[40:10] thankful that he is the answer
[40:11] here's the answer to all of our
[40:13] questions he is a good father who
[40:15] provides for his children and before
[40:17] even Eve and Adam they were created God
[40:22] prepared the answer to the queen to the
[40:24] sin question amen isn't that wonderful
[40:26] praise the Lord before they even were
[40:29] here God had his plan ready amen he
[40:32] didn't have to adjust the plan it was
[40:34] just ready to go amen praise the Lord so
[40:37] I believe that we live in a different
[40:40] time and we've heard it throughout the
[40:42] message that is not the time to eat
[40:44] rabbits it's not a a time to Feast on
[40:47] the old manner but we've been given
[40:50] something fresh amen something something
[40:53] that uh the Saints of all they've been
[40:55] waiting for it for so many years for
[40:58] decades for centuries they died in faith
[41:01] believing that they would witness what
[41:03] we witnessed today amen
[41:07] amen many times we need to be reminded
[41:10] of what we've got amen because Satan
[41:12] will try to point us to the things that
[41:14] we have not or we think that we have not
[41:17] that's the way he came to Eve amen he he
[41:20] just uh Eve didn't know her position
[41:24] amen she didn't know her position that
[41:27] was the main problem if she knew his her
[41:29] position she wouldn't have fell amen for
[41:32] the lies of Satan because Satan proposed
[41:35] her something that she already had amen
[41:38] amen she was a daughter of God she was
[41:41] the one that was supposed to bring the
[41:43] Messiah but not in a fallen way but in a
[41:46] holy matrimony praise the Lord amen but
[41:49] she believed that she lacked something
[41:52] amen and if the devil will let us
[41:55] believe that we are in lack of something
[41:57] today that there is something more to
[41:59] come that we need to wait it's not this
[42:01] time than he's got you
[42:05] but there is a prophecy about the
[42:07] anti-bride isn't that wonderful that she
[42:10] will not fall amen we can either believe
[42:13] that or we can argue with the quote we
[42:16] can push the quote you know to the past
[42:18] or to the future but it's it's as simple
[42:21] as accepting it amen isn't that
[42:24] wonderful amen so every verse we see the
[42:27] Bible and
[42:28] explicitly tells us that we need to look
[42:31] at our Bibles at the word of God as a
[42:33] new book amen we need to see it in a
[42:36] different light because he says that
[42:39] every portion of scripture points to
[42:41] Christ amen whether it is the Old
[42:44] Testament or the New Testament it points
[42:46] to Christ amen and then when you follow
[42:49] the revelation of the word you know that
[42:51] Christ and the bride they are one amen
[42:54] so that the next step is to see yourself
[42:57] in the book Amen to realize that every
[43:00] quote every verse every portion of
[43:02] scripture every prophecy every Prophet
[43:05] they were pointing to our day and age it
[43:08] was written and put in the word of God
[43:11] it was written there for
[43:17] for us to learn amen as the Bible says
[43:19] in Romans 5 4 amen praise the Lord it is
[43:24] written for our benefit for our learning
[43:26] amen whatsoever was written in the past
[43:29] was written for our learning amen that
[43:32] we might learn the position that Christ
[43:34] gave unto us amen so I'm just so
[43:38] thankful for the time that we live in
[43:40] amen
[43:41] that we can be in a special State a
[43:43] state of transition amen we are
[43:46] transitioning from the the corruptable
[43:48] to The Incorruptible from the Earthly to
[43:51] the Heavenly from the things that we
[43:53] call real and tangible to the things
[43:55] that are actually real and actually
[43:57] tangible even more so amen praise the
[44:00] Lord so we live in a time of the Rapture
[44:03] and I believe I think you believe that
[44:06] as well that the Rapture is a process
[44:09] amen we can we can focus on many
[44:11] denominations and many people just focus
[44:13] on this one event the changing of our
[44:15] bodies which is which is part of the
[44:17] Rapture but you won't be changed in a
[44:20] twinkling of an eye if you are not in
[44:22] the state of the Rapture beforehand amen
[44:25] if if your inner man is not lifted up to
[44:28] the position that God gave you before
[44:29] the foundation of the world then you
[44:32] better not wait and anticipate this one
[44:35] twinkling of an eye amen it it won't do
[44:37] you any good amen there will be a bunch
[44:40] of people that will leave this earth
[44:41] because they were in a Rapture condition
[44:43] amen it is a set of events like it was
[44:46] in the first coming of Christ so it is
[44:49] with the second coming of Christ it is a
[44:52] set of events amen praise the Lord so we
[44:54] are living in a time of the second
[44:56] coming okay man we are we are living in
[44:58] a time of a process of the Rapture
[45:00] praise the Lord and I believe that the
[45:03] Lord we know that he is eternal he uses
[45:05] time but he is also the master of time
[45:07] amen and he's not so much Focus maybe on
[45:11] on different days people try to you know
[45:13] do their maths and and figure out when
[45:16] will something happen or or or or or or
[45:19] how many years we've got left and stuff
[45:21] like that
[45:23] and if the Lord leads you to that
[45:25] that's fine that's fine but I believe
[45:27] that the Lord in his plan he didn't put
[45:29] like a a giant timetable because he is
[45:32] not bound by time he can do anything he
[45:35] can prolong the time amen we know that
[45:38] we should have been gone from this Earth
[45:40] a long time ago but we are still waiting
[45:42] for somebody amen we are waiting for
[45:45] that last one
[45:46] and many times we we think that the last
[45:49] one that the last seed will be somebody
[45:51] in the streets it'll be somebody that is
[45:54] maybe Bound by alcohol or Bound by drugs
[45:57] or something else
[45:59] but I believe that it can very well be
[46:02] that the last one is here
[46:04] that he wears a suit and a tie and has
[46:07] been coming to church for a long long
[46:09] time maybe for 20 30 years you've been
[46:11] in this church coming but God is waiting
[46:13] for you and we are all waiting for you
[46:16] or maybe you're all waiting for me to
[46:18] realize who who I am amen praise the
[46:22] Lord because brother Brown tells us and
[46:23] we know uh the quote how do you know the
[46:27] Rapture is not going on all the time he
[46:29] just gives a question he doesn't
[46:31] elaborate on it but I believe that we
[46:34] are spiritually minded amen that we can
[46:36] catch this little question amen and we
[46:39] see a picture we see a a process a set
[46:42] of events because uh we know that life
[46:45] is a process amen so God is not so much
[46:48] focused on the dates uh that people are
[46:51] so focused on but he's focused on people
[46:53] on the process amen because life is a
[46:56] process your life is a process his
[46:58] focused on that process amen so the
[47:01] rapture we know that it is something
[47:03] real amen and it may not be visible to
[47:06] the human eye right now we know that
[47:08] eventually will be changed in the
[47:10] twinkling of an eye amen and there are
[47:12] people who recognize that the bride was
[47:14] here that God himself was the one
[47:17] sitting in the pews of the church and
[47:19] they didn't recognize him they will
[47:21] recognize at that day it will become
[47:23] manifest and visible
[47:25] amen but we know that the Rapture is
[47:28] something real it is not an imagination
[47:30] is not uh some wishful thinking it is
[47:33] not something that that is uh you know a
[47:37] a a a a a concept or something that we
[47:39] talk about a Doctrine a man is something
[47:42] real that is going on right now amen it
[47:45] may be going on in your life as as we
[47:47] are talking as we are speaking the Lord
[47:49] is building something inside of you the
[47:52] Assurance of who you are amen and why
[47:55] did you come here to this earth amen we
[47:57] need to have that Assurance amen praise
[48:00] the Lord
[48:01] so God is more concerned about people
[48:04] than dates amen he is concerned about
[48:06] you making the Rapture not just uh
[48:09] sticking to some date that some man did
[48:12] with his uh little mind he did his mass
[48:15] and then he says it should be by that
[48:17] date or that date is the is the day when
[48:20] the Rapture will happen amen we know
[48:23] what is the condition of the rapture it
[48:25] is US knowing who we are amen for
[48:28] everyone says when the bride knows who
[48:30] she is the rapture will go
[48:33] hey man hey man the Rapture will go once
[48:36] she knows who she is
[48:38] I believe that when we are gathered here
[48:41] it's not all about knowledge right amen
[48:43] we know lots of things we've been coming
[48:46] to church I've been in church since my
[48:49] childhood for 28 years I've been in
[48:51] church I've been listening to to the
[48:53] scriptures I've been listening to the
[48:55] revealed word of God but I believe it's
[48:57] not only about listening amen it is not
[49:00] only about knowledge because we've heard
[49:01] enough amen we know enough
[49:05] but it needs to become something else it
[49:08] needs to become substances in in our
[49:10] lives we need to recognize who we are
[49:12] amen and I'm so when we look at the
[49:15] story of Jesus we know that he is the
[49:18] the perfect foreshadow or he is the the
[49:21] perfect one the first fruit of the first
[49:24] coming we know that we can relate to to
[49:27] the coming of Christ amen the first
[49:29] coming of Christ and we can see our day
[49:31] we can see our day and its message amen
[49:34] I was so blessed it's it's maybe not
[49:37] found in the uh in the final chapters of
[49:40] of the gospels but in Luke 2 52
[49:44] the Bible says that that Jesus increased
[49:47] in wisdom and statue and in favor with
[49:50] God and man amen I believe that's a very
[49:54] powerful quote amen because when brother
[49:56] Branham preached the seals he preached
[49:58] the opening of the seals then after that
[50:00] he tells us just go and live a simple
[50:03] Christian life amen you need to be down
[50:06] to earth you need to make it real in
[50:08] this earth amen you need to grow and
[50:11] increase in in wisdom and statue and in
[50:14] favor with God and man amen that is a
[50:16] process amen that is a process that
[50:18] Christ was in the process of maturing of
[50:21] becoming who he originally was amen
[50:24] praise the Lord hallelujah
[50:28] so many times we think of the Rapture as
[50:30] some sort of an event that we can sign
[50:33] up for or or or make plans to attend
[50:37] you know it's not like that amen
[50:39] otherwise even if you were the elect one
[50:42] you could miss the Rapture amen because
[50:45] we know circumstances you could be
[50:47] flying from Europe because there was a
[50:49] place here in Lima that the Rapture
[50:51] would happen amen and I would be late 24
[50:53] hours amen amen but I believe that I
[50:57] cannot miss the Rapture amen because the
[51:00] Rapture is a person amen you are the
[51:02] Rapture you need to have the Revelation
[51:04] that I am the Rapture and if the Rapture
[51:07] goes I'm going with it amen the Rapture
[51:09] is not going anywhere without me
[51:12] amen
[51:14] and these are not the words of a man
[51:16] amen
[51:17] these are the words of God
[51:19] a man you can either believe that
[51:21] or just argue with that that's your
[51:23] choice everybody's got their choice amen
[51:26] so we are not going to miss the Rapture
[51:28] amen you are not going to miss that
[51:31] final you know that the plane or the
[51:33] train you know
[51:35] because you are the train you are part
[51:37] of of that train of the of the cars
[51:41] that's been loaded up for years with
[51:43] stocked up with good food amen
[51:46] because Brad Brown tells us that the
[51:48] only thing that we'll take from this
[51:50] Earth to glory is our character
[51:53] amen
[51:54] it's not actually our character how how
[51:57] we are some are slow some are some are
[51:59] fast some are are patients some are
[52:01] impatient some are more energetic some
[52:04] are more stable more more uh more
[52:06] settled amen is not the character that
[52:10] God tells us that we should take from
[52:12] this Earth amen it is his own character
[52:15] because as we've read here in second
[52:17] Peter that
[52:21] by these great promises exceeding great
[52:24] and precious promises
[52:26] that we might be partakers of the divine
[52:29] nature amen
[52:31] so our character the character that we
[52:34] take from this Earth is actually the
[52:36] divine nature of God
[52:37] amen isn't that wonderful it is not only
[52:40] by the promises not just uh knowing that
[52:43] this will happen but by the Fulfillment
[52:45] of the promises in your life amen you
[52:48] can be a partaker of the divine nature
[52:50] and we know that Peter wrote it in his
[52:53] day
[52:54] but he I believe that it is written for
[52:57] our day amen because he told us that
[52:59] having escaped the corruption that is in
[53:02] the world through lust amen how can you
[53:05] uh Escape corruption this time we see
[53:08] corruption all over amen wherever we go
[53:11] wherever we look we see corruption amen
[53:15] but there is a promise that to those
[53:17] that are partakers of the divine nature
[53:19] that they will escape the corruption
[53:22] amen that they will be part of a group
[53:24] that will escape corruption amen and we
[53:27] know that David in the Psalms in the
[53:29] first coming of Christ he said you will
[53:31] not leave his soul in Hell nor will you
[53:33] allow your Holy One to see corruption
[53:35] amen you've got the same promise amen
[53:38] aren't you glad you've got the same
[53:39] promise as Christ had that he he will be
[53:42] resurrected that he will not see death
[53:44] that his body will be changed it will
[53:47] not dissolve into ashes it will not
[53:49] dissolve into the elements of of of this
[53:52] Earth but you are going to be changed
[53:54] amen by the promises that are made real
[53:59] inside of you amen having escaped the
[54:03] corruption that is in the world Amen
[54:04] that tells us of the Rapture that tells
[54:06] us of the time where there is gross
[54:08] Darkness upon the people amen but there
[54:11] is also light in the land amen there are
[54:13] people who are the light who became the
[54:15] light amen it is a time of trouble but
[54:18] yet in the time of trouble he shall hide
[54:20] me in his Pavilion the amen that is the
[54:22] rapture message that brother Brown tells
[54:25] us amen
[54:27] now we live in a time of the fullness
[54:30] amen are you glad for that amen because
[54:34] the people before us they couldn't have
[54:37] part in the Rapture amen because they're
[54:40] the the ingredients were there but there
[54:42] was no presence of that Master Chef amen
[54:45] amen
[54:47] and so he needed the people to be able
[54:49] to come to feed on the word of God to
[54:52] experience the journey to experience to
[54:54] get out of their natural thinking to get
[54:57] out of their state of Amnesia and just
[55:00] go to the places where the Master Chef
[55:02] would would show them places familiar
[55:04] places in the word of God Amen so there
[55:08] had to be a people that would be aware
[55:10] of the plan of God amen amen are we
[55:13] aware of the plan of God Amen we are not
[55:16] just knowing the text of the Bible amen
[55:18] we're not we we don't know just the text
[55:21] of the message amen because there are
[55:23] people who are better educated in the
[55:25] word of God than we are than I am amen
[55:28] there are people who are better educated
[55:31] in the message of this hour they know
[55:32] all of the quotes they know all of the
[55:34] passages they can just uh quote it from
[55:37] their mind
[55:38] amen but it's not about knowing the text
[55:41] amen it's about knowing the context amen
[55:45] it's about knowing the whole plan of God
[55:47] Amen that's how you can read the book
[55:49] and you can understand what God is doing
[55:52] amen because you've been given and you
[55:56] are partakers of that divine nature Amen
[55:59] to escape corruption praise the lord we
[56:03] know that Satan's been in every service
[56:04] of brother Brahman amen amen there may
[56:07] be people here who were in The Services
[56:09] of Brahm I was definitely not amen maybe
[56:12] most of you were not but Satan was in
[56:15] every service he attended every service
[56:17] he was the most faithful uh believer in
[56:22] the message of this of that hour amen
[56:24] according to the letter according to the
[56:26] text he knows the text he knows how how
[56:28] to come to you how to quote the message
[56:30] against you
[56:32] he'll try to do it amen if you let him
[56:34] to he'll try to do it
[56:36] but you know the big difference between
[56:38] Satan and you is that he doesn't know
[56:41] the context
[56:42] he doesn't know the whole story amen he
[56:45] was never part of that story amen you
[56:47] were part of that story amen that's why
[56:50] you understand what God is doing in this
[56:52] time
[56:53] amen
[56:56] so we have the promise that the only
[56:58] thing that we'll take from this Earth is
[57:00] our character amen aren't you God Amen
[57:03] will take the character of God With Us
[57:05] amen and a character is the full
[57:08] complexity
[57:10] of God's characteristics amen is the
[57:13] full set of traits of characteristics
[57:16] amen isn't that wonderful when I was
[57:19] reading that you know
[57:21] is not you know God is not from one side
[57:24] he's simple amen but then he's also
[57:27] complex a man in his nature he is also
[57:30] complex amen because we when we see the
[57:33] nature of God when we look around the
[57:35] building when we look at your brother at
[57:37] your sister you see how God's nature is
[57:40] complex it is different you are maybe
[57:42] slow somebody is fast maybe maybe you
[57:45] are uh you pull on the on the trigger
[57:48] real fast somebody it takes him years to
[57:50] do that
[57:51] amen it's the complexity of God's
[57:54] character amen praise the Lord and he
[57:57] wants us to be individuals
[58:00] he wants that complexity of his
[58:02] character to be visible in US amen that
[58:04] you all just go and go to the uh to
[58:07] another country Amen to another culture
[58:11] and not see people who are different who
[58:13] do things differently than I do they do
[58:16] things differently than our church does
[58:18] and then you've got a problem you cannot
[58:20] see God but God expects us whenever you
[58:23] go and his children are gathered he
[58:26] expects us to see his complexity amen
[58:29] the complexity of his character Amen to
[58:32] recognize God Amen in a simple brother
[58:34] and a simple sister maybe uh that does
[58:38] things totally opposite to to what you
[58:40] are used to amen but God loves to hide
[58:43] himself
[58:44] amen praise the Lord so sometimes when
[58:47] you travel you just uh you just
[58:50] encounter different things amen maybe
[58:52] maybe the United States and Poland we
[58:54] are more kind of Western countries and
[58:56] we do most of the things in a similar
[58:59] way there are little differences maybe
[59:01] amen but when you go to Africa when you
[59:03] go to Asia you know sometimes it's
[59:06] totally different amen totally different
[59:08] than you would expect than than you were
[59:10] used to but yet God expects you to see
[59:13] him in the brother and the sister amen
[59:17] on the other continent amen praise the
[59:19] Lord
[59:21] so we know that God is not a man from
[59:25] one side he's simple but yet he is
[59:27] complex amen he wants to manifest
[59:30] himself and we see throughout the
[59:32] scripture we see him manifesting himself
[59:35] under many names amen he was the rose of
[59:38] Sharon he was the lily of the valley he
[59:40] was he was he had the seven compound
[59:42] names of Jehovah he was Jehovah Rapha
[59:45] Jehovah Shalom Jehovah shama and so on
[59:48] and then he was visible and he made
[59:50] himself known as a wheel inside of a
[59:53] wheel uh then then he he appeared as
[59:55] Melchizedek then he came in the form of
[59:57] Jesus Christ so we can see the character
[1:00:00] of God Amen being complex amen he uses
[1:00:04] different ways he uses different masks
[1:00:07] he uses different forms he uses
[1:00:09] different names say Amen praise the Lord
[1:00:11] so and many times we as people as we've
[1:00:14] read here in Exodus we try to ask God
[1:00:17] you know what is your name amen what is
[1:00:20] your name
[1:00:22] because you know us as human beings we
[1:00:24] just like things to to be
[1:00:27] um in order you know we want to put okay
[1:00:30] who are you okay we we ask about the
[1:00:33] name about where he lives and so on we
[1:00:35] ask different questions and we we want
[1:00:38] to have uh the grasp of who God is we
[1:00:41] want to put him in a little box maybe
[1:00:43] put him in a chair somewhere and label
[1:00:45] him that's God Amen so we would know
[1:00:47] that from this day on that's always God
[1:00:50] you know and so there is this little box
[1:00:52] that people have amen
[1:00:54] called God in their life or their
[1:00:57] imagination of God Amen and the box is
[1:01:01] kept locked amen they they lock the Box
[1:01:04] you know they Trap God inside they know
[1:01:07] who he is they they find him in the
[1:01:08] scripture okay that's god let's let's
[1:01:11] hide him in the Box amen just label him
[1:01:14] God however we need him we'll just we'll
[1:01:16] just go to that box we know that he's
[1:01:18] there amen we know that Israel
[1:01:22] they have the problem with that amen
[1:01:24] they were given the Ark of the Covenant
[1:01:27] amen as a visible representative of the
[1:01:30] presence of God Amen but then when God
[1:01:34] changed his place of habitation when he
[1:01:36] moved from one place to another when he
[1:01:39] changed his mask they couldn't follow
[1:01:40] that they were stuck with the same old
[1:01:43] uh Ark of the Covenant amen till this
[1:01:47] day they are still looking for it and
[1:01:48] there are several uh different Arts of
[1:01:50] the Covenant all over the globe some in
[1:01:52] Africa some Asia some in Israel amen
[1:01:55] everybody claims to have the Ark of the
[1:01:57] Covenant amen
[1:01:59] they've got the presence of God trapped
[1:02:01] in a box amen but God is free amen he
[1:02:06] cannot be bound by a box he cannot be
[1:02:08] bound by Traditions he cannot be bound
[1:02:10] by men's ideas amen but us as human
[1:02:15] beings it's natural we just want to uh
[1:02:17] see God and realize that's God and
[1:02:19] always know till the end of our lives
[1:02:21] that was God that this God and so on but
[1:02:24] he wants us to follow him amen praise
[1:02:27] the Lord
[1:02:29] we know that uh just giving a few
[1:02:32] examples we know that in Genesis when
[1:02:35] God was wrestling or or we know that
[1:02:38] Jacob was wrestling with an angel amen
[1:02:40] as Genesis 32 29 you don't have to turn
[1:02:43] to that
[1:02:44] uh but then Jacob asked him as the angel
[1:02:48] and said tell me I pray thee thy name
[1:02:50] and he said wherefore is it that thou
[1:02:53] does ask after my name and he blessed
[1:02:56] him there amen when you go through the
[1:02:59] scriptures when you go through the Old
[1:03:00] Testament you go through the New
[1:03:02] Testament you see how many times people
[1:03:05] had questions and God wouldn't answer
[1:03:07] their questions
[1:03:08] he would he would seem to answer but he
[1:03:11] answered to a different question that
[1:03:13] they never gave amen we see it with the
[1:03:16] with with the disciples amen they were
[1:03:18] inquiring about God you know they were
[1:03:20] inquiring about the future who will be
[1:03:22] uh who will be the greatest or or if
[1:03:24] John will uh outlive the Lord and and
[1:03:27] you know he he will be part of the
[1:03:30] second coming and you know Jesus never
[1:03:32] answered he never answered Peter amen he
[1:03:35] never answered the the disciples because
[1:03:37] he knew that these were not the kinds of
[1:03:39] questions that you need answers to amen
[1:03:42] you need to understand God in his
[1:03:44] complexity amen you need to follow God
[1:03:47] wherever he leads whatever mask he uses
[1:03:50] whatever form he takes you need to be
[1:03:53] faithful and follow him amen praise the
[1:03:55] lord we know when the angel came to
[1:03:57] Manoa that was the father of of Samson
[1:04:00] in Judges 13 17-18 and Manoa said unto
[1:04:05] the angel of the Lord what is thy name
[1:04:07] okay it was not just a question but he
[1:04:09] said that when thy sayings come to pass
[1:04:12] we may do the honor so he wanted to
[1:04:15] worship God he wanted to worship amen
[1:04:18] and he asked for the name amen and the
[1:04:21] angel of the Lord which we know that God
[1:04:23] wasn't that angel amen said unto him why
[1:04:26] ask us Thou after my name sing it is
[1:04:30] secret amen so he never gave an answer
[1:04:33] he never told him the name
[1:04:35] amen and then we read out of Exodus amen
[1:04:39] and that that was the first question
[1:04:41] that Moses had he knew the children of
[1:04:44] Israel he knew that when he would come
[1:04:45] to them as the deliverer he uh he didn't
[1:04:49] have a clean record in Egypt right amen
[1:04:53] they knew him they knew him so he was
[1:04:55] trying to prove his ministry by asking
[1:04:58] the Lord to provide him with the name
[1:05:00] amen Moses said unto God behold when I
[1:05:03] come unto the children of Israel and
[1:05:05] Chase shall say unto them the god of
[1:05:08] your fathers send me unto you and they
[1:05:11] shall say to me what is his name amen
[1:05:14] another human question what shall I say
[1:05:17] unto them
[1:05:18] and God said unto Moses amen we know
[1:05:21] that Moses was the elect one amen he
[1:05:23] told him I am that I am
[1:05:26] and he said does shall thou say unto the
[1:05:29] children of Israel I am has sent me unto
[1:05:33] you amen so God was actually not
[1:05:36] revealing the name it was not a name I
[1:05:38] am that I am he was revealing more of
[1:05:40] his nature amen of who he is and I was
[1:05:44] so blessed
[1:05:45] by by reading a little bit and and
[1:05:49] digging inside what that means in the
[1:05:53] original I am that I am amen because
[1:05:55] that reveals something about God's
[1:05:57] nature amen
[1:05:59] it's the I am the present one amen
[1:06:02] it is the I am that I am amen the one
[1:06:05] that doesn't change Hallelujah he takes
[1:06:07] different forms he's the different masks
[1:06:09] but yet
[1:06:10] he stays the same amen then another
[1:06:13] translation is I am the existing one
[1:06:16] I'm Eternal I am the ever present God
[1:06:19] the ever-present water from the Rock and
[1:06:22] then I was really uh blessed by
[1:06:27] this other translation it says that
[1:06:30] actually I am that I am is translated I
[1:06:33] will become who I choose to become
[1:06:35] amen that is the title of my message and
[1:06:38] that's that's what we want to uh delve
[1:06:40] into for a while amen I will become who
[1:06:43] I choose to become amen it was so
[1:06:46] powerful to me amen
[1:06:49] I will become whosoever I please to
[1:06:52] become amen that just shows you how
[1:06:55] Sovereign God is
[1:06:57] amen
[1:06:58] you cannot use the letter to see God you
[1:07:01] cannot uh search the scriptures and find
[1:07:04] god with the letter amen because he is
[1:07:08] always changing amen he's always
[1:07:10] changing his mask he is always changing
[1:07:12] his forms he's changing his names amen
[1:07:14] but there are some
[1:07:17] who have that Heavenly Instinct amen
[1:07:19] they've got the gene of God
[1:07:22] amen that tells them that's God Amen
[1:07:25] that they can follow God wherever he
[1:07:27] goes amen they are not stuck with their
[1:07:30] own form with their own tradition with
[1:07:32] their own understanding it may be a very
[1:07:34] good understanding based on the message
[1:07:36] of this hour but whenever God tells you
[1:07:38] to move and he he switches places he
[1:07:41] switches The Mask he expects you to
[1:07:44] follow amen praise the Lord so he in
[1:07:47] other words he told Moses Moses if the
[1:07:49] people want to know my name
[1:07:52] tell them that I cannot be labeled amen
[1:07:55] I cannot be put in a box a man for
[1:07:58] future reference amen I'm not the type
[1:08:00] of a God I'm not a god of Egypt I'm not
[1:08:02] the god of of wood stone or whatever
[1:08:05] other material amen I Am The Sovereign
[1:08:07] God that I am and I will become who I
[1:08:10] want to become amen you just follow me
[1:08:14] praise the Lord unless you become
[1:08:16] partakers of God's nature amen you
[1:08:19] cannot see God
[1:08:21] amen because it is the nature of God
[1:08:23] becoming who he pleases to become the
[1:08:26] nature of God is to be Sovereign amen he
[1:08:29] is a sovereign God
[1:08:31] amen so we see that that Israel they
[1:08:35] they wanted to know the name of God and
[1:08:38] so they knew just God on a superficial
[1:08:40] level they just knew God in his acts
[1:08:43] when he would perform great Miracles
[1:08:45] when he would part the Red Sea when he
[1:08:48] would give them Quail give them uh food
[1:08:50] Manna in this season
[1:08:52] that's when they saw God they saw him in
[1:08:55] his actions when he was thundering from
[1:08:57] the mountain they knew it was God he
[1:08:59] they they knew that he was the one who
[1:09:01] gave them the Ten Commandments and all
[1:09:03] of the other Commandments amen but they
[1:09:05] didn't know him in his ways amen and in
[1:09:08] Psalms 103 maybe I I'd like to ask you
[1:09:12] to turn to that amen
[1:09:15] it's Psalms 103.
[1:09:17] verse 7.
[1:09:22] because there is a difference
[1:09:24] in the way God revealed himself
[1:09:28] to Moses and the way he revealed himself
[1:09:31] to the children of Israel amen the
[1:09:32] Psalms 103 verse 7 he made known his
[1:09:36] ways to Moses amen
[1:09:38] he revealed his plan to Moses and his
[1:09:42] acts unto the children of Israel amen so
[1:09:45] the children of Israel whenever they saw
[1:09:47] the manifestation of God they said
[1:09:48] that's God amen when they didn't see the
[1:09:51] manifestation when there was a time of a
[1:09:53] a drought of of tribulation of going
[1:09:56] through the desert of of not uh
[1:09:59] basically being excited about the Exodus
[1:10:01] they couldn't see God they they wanted
[1:10:04] the visible form of God they told Aaron
[1:10:06] okay now you create a God for us like
[1:10:09] you create a God that will lead us that
[1:10:12] that will be visible and he will lead us
[1:10:14] back to Egypt amen they just knew God
[1:10:17] when they saw him Amen in the acts amen
[1:10:20] whatever he did
[1:10:22] whether from The Rock okay that's God
[1:10:24] and that lasted for I don't know how
[1:10:27] many days or hours amen that kind of a
[1:10:29] revelation will not last long amen we
[1:10:32] need to have a stable Revelation brother
[1:10:33] and sister amen we need to have the
[1:10:35] revelation of the ways how God operates
[1:10:39] how he does things Amen in this hour we
[1:10:42] need to be so vigilant
[1:10:43] Amen to see the move of the spirit amen
[1:10:49] so Moses he knew God in another way amen
[1:10:54] he knew God
[1:10:56] because he sawed his face amen he wasn't
[1:10:59] just looking for his hands what he had
[1:11:01] if he had Manna or he had Quail or he
[1:11:04] had water or or he had uh good clothes
[1:11:07] or or he was providing them with
[1:11:09] whatever they needed they didn't lack
[1:11:11] for anything amen God was taking care of
[1:11:14] Israel amen but the relationship that he
[1:11:17] had with Moses once was on a totally
[1:11:19] different basis amen amen he was
[1:11:22] different amen
[1:11:24] actually the Bible tells us that the
[1:11:26] Lord would speak to Moses face to face
[1:11:29] as one speaks to a friend amen he didn't
[1:11:32] speak with any others that same way amen
[1:11:34] he spoke with Moses amen and Moses knew
[1:11:38] God's character you can see it
[1:11:40] in the Bible when God became angry we
[1:11:43] actually see uh
[1:11:46] the behind the scenes amen
[1:11:49] maybe maybe maybe Israelites they they
[1:11:52] weren't uh they were stuck in their own
[1:11:54] thinking they didn't realize what was
[1:11:55] going on behind the scenes but behind
[1:11:57] the scenes God was mad amen he was mad
[1:12:00] at the children that he brought out of
[1:12:02] Egypt amen but God
[1:12:06] made himself known to Moses in a
[1:12:08] different way amen
[1:12:10] Moses knew the ways of the Lord that's
[1:12:13] why he could reason with the Lord that's
[1:12:15] why he could tell him Lord that is
[1:12:17] unlike your character I know your
[1:12:19] character I know that you're loving that
[1:12:21] you are patient
[1:12:22] that you don't want to do it amen
[1:12:25] isn't that a special relationship that
[1:12:27] he said he had a man
[1:12:30] praise the Lord so he knew the plan of
[1:12:32] God
[1:12:33] amen and whenever things went in a bad
[1:12:36] Direction amen we see Moses he was
[1:12:38] appealing
[1:12:40] to God's traits Amen to his character
[1:12:44] he knew who God was amen he didn't just
[1:12:47] know him uh by by the breaking of bread
[1:12:49] or you know the the breaking of the man
[1:12:52] of sending of quails he didn't know him
[1:12:53] only in that way he knew him in a in a
[1:12:56] much more profound way amen praise the
[1:13:00] Lord
[1:13:01] that's the relationship that God expects
[1:13:04] to have with us Amen to not see him when
[1:13:08] everybody sees him amen there is there
[1:13:10] will be a time when people all over the
[1:13:12] globe whether they are uh maybe message
[1:13:15] Believers or or denominational folk or
[1:13:18] some other uh kind maybe they are not
[1:13:20] even Christian they will realize that
[1:13:22] God was here on Earth and now he is gone
[1:13:24] they will recognize that amen
[1:13:28] but we need to recognize God now amen
[1:13:30] what he is doing amen
[1:13:33] and in First John 3 1-2
[1:13:37] let's open it together
[1:13:46] do you love the Lord
[1:13:48] amen
[1:13:51] I will become
[1:13:52] who I choose to become amen let's just
[1:13:55] bear it in our minds amen
[1:13:59] first John chapter 3 verses one and two
[1:14:02] behold what manner of love the father
[1:14:05] hath bestowed unto us that we should be
[1:14:08] called the sons of God
[1:14:10] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:14:13] because it knew him not amen beloved now
[1:14:18] are we the sons of God and it does not
[1:14:21] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[1:14:25] that when he shall appear we shall be
[1:14:27] like him
[1:14:28] for we shall see him as he is
[1:14:31] amen praise the Lord so we just see what
[1:14:34] was written here that it does not yet
[1:14:36] appear what we shall be but we are sure
[1:14:39] of one thing that we will be like him
[1:14:41] will be in His image amen praise the
[1:14:44] Lord so we remember the story of of Saul
[1:14:47] uh of of tarshas of of Paul we know that
[1:14:52] he on the basis of the scripture he
[1:14:54] wasn't ignorant amen he knew the
[1:14:56] scripture because he was a Pharisee out
[1:14:58] of the Pharisees he was one of the the
[1:15:00] brightest Minds when it came to the
[1:15:02] Pharisees in their day amen that's why
[1:15:05] he could prove through the scriptures
[1:15:07] the coming of the Messiah amen he could
[1:15:09] prove basing himself on the letter of
[1:15:12] the law
[1:15:13] he knew everything about the Messiah the
[1:15:15] coming of Messiah amen but what he
[1:15:18] didn't have he didn't have the
[1:15:19] revelation of who he is in the present
[1:15:22] amen that's why when he when he met the
[1:15:25] pillar of fire amen and the pillar of
[1:15:27] fire threw him out of his horse and and
[1:15:31] then there was a question given
[1:15:34] so so
[1:15:35] why do you persecute me amen and it was
[1:15:39] out of the frame of his understanding
[1:15:41] out of the frame of his theology how
[1:15:44] could the pillar of fire and and and and
[1:15:47] the voice of Jesus and then connecting
[1:15:50] it with the church
[1:15:51] he wasn't amen he was just basing his
[1:15:54] Revelation on the law amen that's why he
[1:15:57] he couldn't see God Amen that's why he
[1:16:00] became blind amen and he had to go to
[1:16:03] one of the members of the body of Christ
[1:16:06] to one of those that He persecuted and
[1:16:09] he want he had to ask him amen for his
[1:16:12] side back Hallelujah he had to ask
[1:16:16] amen the part of the body of Christ to
[1:16:19] see again to see God Amen
[1:16:22] Hallelujah
[1:16:23] so we know that that when the prophet uh
[1:16:27] was ananias oh no yeah ananias when he
[1:16:31] prayed for Saul
[1:16:34] he asked God that he would heal him and
[1:16:37] the first person amen
[1:16:39] that's all Saul
[1:16:42] amen
[1:16:45] he asked the Lord maybe he was fearful
[1:16:47] but he asked the Lord
[1:16:50] make this
[1:16:52] Pharisee out of the Pharisees may he see
[1:16:54] you in the present day amen and when he
[1:16:57] prayed that prayer and his eyes were
[1:16:58] open he didn't see uh Jesus of Galilee
[1:17:01] amen Paul didn't see Jesus of Galilee he
[1:17:05] saw ananias amen
[1:17:09] why are you persecuting me Hallelujah
[1:17:12] amen
[1:17:13] praise the Lord
[1:17:18] so
[1:17:21] we know that we we read here in John and
[1:17:25] we can read it in in the Epistles of of
[1:17:27] Paul and Peter and so on that they they
[1:17:30] they knew God for their age they knew
[1:17:33] the unveiling of God but yet they they
[1:17:36] they were sure that there was coming a
[1:17:38] day of the full unveiling of God's
[1:17:41] attributes amen
[1:17:43] that's why John wrote it does not yet
[1:17:45] appear okay it does not yet appear he
[1:17:47] was the type of the Bride he was the one
[1:17:50] who who who laid his head on the chest
[1:17:53] of Jesus but then he says it does not
[1:17:55] yet appear so he didn't know it back
[1:17:57] then but what he was sure of that we
[1:18:01] shall be like him amen we shall be like
[1:18:04] him for his we shall see him as he is
[1:18:07] amen when is the time coming
[1:18:11] amen is there any more time coming are
[1:18:15] we expecting another generation are we
[1:18:17] expecting another church age are we
[1:18:19] expecting uh hundreds of of years edit
[1:18:24] I believe that it will it is shorter
[1:18:26] than that I believe the time is at hand
[1:18:28] I believe the time is right now amen it
[1:18:31] is the time when God himself is on Earth
[1:18:34] amen praise the Lord
[1:18:38] so God has been saying for years I am
[1:18:41] that I am
[1:18:42] I will become who I choose to become he
[1:18:44] was revealing his nature amen praise the
[1:18:47] Lord in other words you will be amazed
[1:18:50] when you see how I chose to hide myself
[1:18:53] amen you'll be amazed you'll be
[1:18:55] surprised amen bear brown tells us that
[1:18:58] we'll be surprised about many things
[1:19:00] amen even going to the uh to the other
[1:19:03] side when we see the people that are
[1:19:04] there will be surprised by the people
[1:19:06] that are there and will be surprised by
[1:19:08] by the people that won't be there
[1:19:10] yeah amen
[1:19:12] so he was saying you all see at the very
[1:19:15] end who I am that will be the final
[1:19:17] revelation of who I am amen maybe you
[1:19:21] thought I was just I was Melchizedek
[1:19:23] giving communion to Abraham maybe you
[1:19:25] thought I was the pillar of fire that
[1:19:26] met Paul maybe maybe you thought I was
[1:19:29] the Holy Spirit that filled the
[1:19:31] Believers in the days of Pentecost and
[1:19:33] that is all true but now he is an
[1:19:35] ever-present God Amen and we need to
[1:19:38] watch him when he becomes something else
[1:19:40] amen
[1:19:41] it may be contrary to our thinking it
[1:19:44] may be contrary to what we expect what
[1:19:46] we imagine what religion uh tries to
[1:19:50] impose on us amen
[1:19:53] is very different that's why we need to
[1:19:56] just yield to the Lord amen may he be
[1:19:59] the guide amen not my will but yours be
[1:20:01] done amen may I see you father
[1:20:05] and the full maturity amen the full
[1:20:08] maturity will be shown at the very end
[1:20:10] amen now we are at the very end amen
[1:20:15] I will become what I choose to become
[1:20:18] Hallelujah beloved now we are the sons
[1:20:20] of God and it does not yet appear what
[1:20:22] we shall be but we know that when he
[1:20:25] shall appear I'm I believe that's our
[1:20:27] time we shall be like him amen for we
[1:20:30] shall see him as he is
[1:20:33] amen at the very end it turns out who he
[1:20:37] always been who he is now amen
[1:20:40] that there are people that are not only
[1:20:42] similar to him but are like him amen
[1:20:44] they are him Hallelujah all that God was
[1:20:48] he poured into Christ all that Christ
[1:20:50] was he poured into the church amen
[1:20:54] and you'll be amazed when you see me God
[1:20:57] says I am that I am you'll be amazed
[1:20:59] when you see
[1:21:01] how I choose to become
[1:21:03] or who I choose to become amen praise
[1:21:06] the Lord
[1:21:08] so God is suffering we see that he does
[1:21:11] whatever he wants amen I am that I am
[1:21:14] praise the Lord you don't have to ask
[1:21:16] anybody for permission amen he doesn't
[1:21:19] ask have to ask all of the people the
[1:21:21] the religious folks or or the
[1:21:23] theologians would it be proper for God
[1:21:27] to hide himself in the people such as
[1:21:29] this amen he didn't do it in his first
[1:21:31] coming he never consulted anybody amen
[1:21:34] about the way he came
[1:21:36] that he came he was born in a manger
[1:21:40] wrapped in swaddling curves
[1:21:42] amen
[1:21:44] but he chose to do it amen to show his
[1:21:47] sovereignty amen
[1:21:50] not only his name but his nature we you
[1:21:52] know there are so many names of God Amen
[1:21:55] there are so many names of God today
[1:21:56] amen
[1:21:58] but we need to see his nature
[1:22:00] amen praise the Lord
[1:22:03] and that is a powerful quote that's
[1:22:05] earnestly contending for the Fate that
[1:22:08] was once delivered to the Saints
[1:22:10] Iran says now if you are not born again
[1:22:14] you do not believe in the Supernatural
[1:22:16] and if you do not believe in the
[1:22:19] Supernatural you haven't been born again
[1:22:22] because when you are born again you
[1:22:24] become a son of God
[1:22:26] and he will being a Son of God you are
[1:22:30] the nature of God
[1:22:32] amen and there he continues and he says
[1:22:35] and then you take on things
[1:22:37] and you want to see the moving of God
[1:22:39] you want to see how God will move
[1:22:42] because you're his son
[1:22:44] and You're Made In His Image and you're
[1:22:46] born of his Spirit you are a part of him
[1:22:50] amen and then you've got faith for
[1:22:53] everything
[1:22:54] Hallelujah when you realize that you are
[1:22:57] part of God that you are a part partaker
[1:22:59] of God's nature amen then you take on
[1:23:03] the things amen you live a normal
[1:23:05] Christian life amen you just go to work
[1:23:07] you just face the responsibilities you
[1:23:10] just face the circumstances why because
[1:23:12] you want to see the moving of God
[1:23:15] you realize that he's part of you then
[1:23:17] you are excited to meet the problems to
[1:23:19] face the problems within the week and
[1:23:22] then see the salvation of the Lord amen
[1:23:24] isn't it wonderful
[1:23:26] isn't it comforting when you when we
[1:23:29] know and realize the nature of God Amen
[1:23:34] praise the Lord
[1:23:35] he can fill your shoes amen amen
[1:23:39] he can he can borrow whatever you give
[1:23:43] to his hands right amen
[1:23:46] he will do it and then he will go in the
[1:23:48] power of your might amen
[1:23:53] you know God
[1:23:57] he did one thing
[1:23:59] he said that he would be faithful to his
[1:24:01] word amen
[1:24:03] amen he may not be faithful to his form
[1:24:06] he may not be faithful to his mask
[1:24:08] amen but he is always faithful to his
[1:24:11] word
[1:24:12] amen praise the Lord
[1:24:17] amen so we see Jesus in the first coming
[1:24:20] amen
[1:24:21] and I'm I'm closing in a while amen we
[1:24:24] see the first coming of Christ we see
[1:24:26] Jesus
[1:24:30] and he wanted the people he wanted the
[1:24:33] disciples amen disciples is not only
[1:24:35] those that just follow
[1:24:37] follow orders or
[1:24:39] or follow the master but disciples are
[1:24:43] actually people who are learning amen
[1:24:46] amen that go through a certain process
[1:24:49] of discipline of of knowledge of
[1:24:51] acquiring knowledge amen praise the Lord
[1:24:54] so he spent three and a half years of
[1:24:56] his ministry just uh teaching the
[1:25:00] disciples not to not just to see him by
[1:25:03] the breaking of bread not just to see
[1:25:05] him by the way he did the Miracles amen
[1:25:09] but he wanted them to see him in his
[1:25:12] ways amen praise the Lord he he said
[1:25:16] I'll be using throughout the ages even
[1:25:18] throughout my Ministry I will be using
[1:25:20] different masks
[1:25:22] but you not focus on the mask you just
[1:25:24] focus on the one who's behind the mask
[1:25:27] amen because God never
[1:25:29] promised that he would be faithful to a
[1:25:32] mask amen he promised that he would be
[1:25:34] faithful to himself he said I swore by
[1:25:36] myself amen by my word
[1:25:39] you can see it in the ministry of Jesus
[1:25:41] he never taught the disciples that he
[1:25:45] would operate in the same way over and
[1:25:48] over and over again amen it's just an
[1:25:51] example of of
[1:25:53] of people being blind in the Bible amen
[1:25:56] and their Encounters of Jesus Amen and
[1:25:59] we are just going to go through it very
[1:26:02] quickly in in Matthew 9 27 and 20 and 30
[1:26:06] there are two Blind Men that approached
[1:26:08] the master you know and what did Jesus
[1:26:11] do he touched their eyes and he said Let
[1:26:13] It Be according
[1:26:15] to your faith amen then we see in Mark
[1:26:18] chapter 8. amen Mark chapter 8 verses
[1:26:22] 22-25
[1:26:24] that was the blind man at Bethesda amen
[1:26:27] and this time
[1:26:29] he didn't touch the guy he didn't touch
[1:26:31] his eyes
[1:26:32] he just spat in his face a man in his
[1:26:35] eyes
[1:26:36] what a weird way to perform a miracle
[1:26:38] amen
[1:26:39] we know that the disciples they were
[1:26:41] shocked
[1:26:42] they didn't know what was happening if
[1:26:44] it's the same Jesus
[1:26:46] or it's somebody else amen
[1:26:49] but Jesus wanted to teach them teach the
[1:26:52] disciples that he will be changing his
[1:26:55] forms he'll be changing his masks and
[1:26:57] now never focus on the mass never focus
[1:27:00] on the way he's been doing it maybe he's
[1:27:02] been doing that in your life for a
[1:27:05] certain period of time but be open to
[1:27:07] see God doing and Performing things in a
[1:27:09] different way hey amen praise the Lord
[1:27:13] then we see in Mark chapter 10 just two
[1:27:15] chapters further 51 and 52
[1:27:19] he didn't touch the blind man he just
[1:27:21] spoke the word
[1:27:23] amen he didn't touch him amen he didn't
[1:27:26] say any special phrase
[1:27:30] he didn't mention his faith amen Go and
[1:27:33] Let it Be according to your faith he
[1:27:34] didn't say that
[1:27:35] amen
[1:27:38] it was just a spoken word no touching
[1:27:40] amen and we know there was the pool of
[1:27:43] Siloam amen that's in John chapter 9
[1:27:46] verses 6 and 7.
[1:27:48] this time he spat on the ground
[1:27:51] made mud put it on the guy's eyes and he
[1:27:55] told him to go wash himself
[1:27:58] another way the same God
[1:28:01] dealing with the same problem in
[1:28:03] different ways
[1:28:04] amen showing to us that we shouldn't
[1:28:07] Focus so much on the acts
[1:28:10] we should focus on the ways we should
[1:28:12] understand the nature of God we should
[1:28:14] be partakers of the nature of God Amen
[1:28:16] he isn't faithful to his mask amen he's
[1:28:19] faithful to his word hallelujah he
[1:28:22] doesn't he doesn't make copies amen God
[1:28:25] doesn't open
[1:28:26] a manufacturing nothing like that God is
[1:28:30] an original
[1:28:31] whatever he feels like doing he just
[1:28:34] does it he doesn't have to
[1:28:36] have to you for permission he doesn't
[1:28:37] ask have to ask me or some other person
[1:28:39] for permission he'll just do it amen
[1:28:42] because he's sovereign
[1:28:44] and he'll tell you that's my nature I
[1:28:46] will become who I want to become amen

[1:28:52] Lord he is the god of amore amen he is
[1:28:55] the god that changes masks

[1:29:06] God under a certain mask under under a
[1:29:09] certain form
[1:29:10] and they just they just worship the form
[1:29:12] they just worship The Mask amen
[1:29:15] and there was a time when God was behind
[1:29:17] the mask and that was the right amen but
[1:29:19] now God wants to move on
[1:29:21] he wants to change his mask he wants to
[1:29:24] change his form why because he can amen
[1:29:28] because he is God because he's Sovereign

[1:30:23] very questionable uh situation with Mary
[1:30:27] not having a husband and having a baby
[1:30:29] you know as God you could think of a
[1:30:32] better way to come amen and we know that

[1:31:00] then the way he died amen he died on a
[1:31:03] on a Roman cross amen what a terrible
[1:31:05] way to die

[1:31:13] sleep amen
[1:31:15] well what we call a a royal death amen I
[1:31:19] don't know if you call it that you know
[1:31:21] without suffering you just lay asleep

[1:31:34] people have always tried to fix the plan
[1:31:36] of God Amen there was all sorts of ideas
[1:31:39] and theologies and ways amen God is not
[1:31:42] interested amen he doesn't have to
[1:31:45] account to no one

[1:32:04] uh the things that you laid out in the
[1:32:07] scripture like it always worked
[1:32:10] but you just see the sovereignty of God
[1:32:13] that he didn't have to
[1:32:15] account to no one even the prophet for
[1:32:17] this age amen
[1:32:19] many times we feel we feel that
[1:32:22] we are special and we are but we are not
[1:32:24] more special than Gods amen God doesn't
[1:32:26] have to account to your little brain and

[1:32:56] who he desires to become amen he cannot
[1:32:59] be bound anymore he was bound for a long

[1:33:05] people that couldn't understand him in
[1:33:06] his ways amen that's why he was bound
[1:33:09] but he is released Amen in the full
[1:33:12] power the full potential amen of the
[1:33:14] word of God and he cannot be bound amen
