surrender ourselves to your hand and give you preeminence may you come and speak to us Lord Lord speak to us comfort and peace Lord be our portion in this hour we love you we ask your blessings over all that we say and do may you take full control and have your Liberty here amongst us we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you all certainly good to be here with you today let's take our Bibles while we're standing and I just want to take a second welcome all the visitors I know we got quite a few visiting today and we want to say welcome to you and God bless you we appre appreciate having you here with us also want to say I appreciated the specials and was Sister Ruth she's here with her family uh visiting from Ontario so we appreciate her she's here with her husband and her two young children and then and my kids I was surprised they didn't discuss that with me they just did it amen and I praise God I'm so thankful the song was such a u testimony of what we heard Wednesday night am and I thank God for that he's our Shepherd amen amen amen let's turn to the Book of John yeah John chapter 10 and I I just had a couple announcements we want to remember brother Emanuel saasu and his family they traveled over to Pittsburgh this weekend he's ministering for brother Jean kadema there and so he he's doing well we text this morning with each other and uh then I want to let you know also next Sunday brother Kyle his family will be traveling over there to preach for brother Jean as well and so brother Jean's starting to have brothers through the church is getting established and I think all of the ministering Brothers here are going to wind up over there in the next month or so so that'll be fun it'll be fun to go over there and see the work and so pray for uh brother Emanuel as he travels back and Brother Kyle and his family as they go next weekend also I want to let you know that this coming Sunday a week from today brother berley Williams will be with us so he'll be preaching for us then so it' be good to have him back uh the minister once again amen let's take a look now at the scripture in John chapter 10 and let's read from verse 27 John 10: 27 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand I and my father are one amen amen God bless you as you have your seats I'd like to preach this morning on a subject called our security and we find Jesus says that we are his sheep and he is our Shepherd and he he says he tells us that no man shall pluck us out of his hand now we are in his hand and nobody can pluck us out of his hand and then he says my Father which is which gave them me is greater than all and no man can pluck them out of no no man can pluck them out of my father's hand then he says I and my father are one so I think we're very secure in the hand of God and so I want to talk about our our security because the world is so uncertain and un insecure that I want to talk about where our security comes from and in the message of trumpet gives an uncertain sound the prophet said the national life is uncertain well the world is uncertain we're just living in a a place to where the whole world is having a nervous prostration look like shaking off every nation everybody one is afraid of the other and if I don't know if you heard the news or not but last night Iran launched an attack against Israel they sent a bunch of drones and missiles or whatever and and most of them were intercepted and and there's just a feeling all over the world as you never know what's going to happen next everything is tense and and there's there's war in Europe and Eastern Europe and there's war in the middle East and and there's tension all over the place but praise God we're in the palm of his hand I'd rather be secure in the palm of his hand and secure in some place on this Earth and so so I thank God for that brother bom he says in the message the uncertain sound from 61 he says your jobs you ain't got no security in your jobs I don't know how true this is but I've been told that there's more people out of work right now than there was during the time of President Hoover's dep because there's more people what's the matter it's just a place where there's no certainty in these things you're not certain of your job somebody can take your place in the morning politics let's just talk a while tonight this is Saturday night politics crooked both sides just so crooked as crooked can be it proved that in this last election when the FBI exposed that they had machines that every time you voted for Mr Nixon they had vote for M for Kennedy at the same time and they proved it and what did they do about it nothing nothing now I'm not Democrat nor Republican neither one I'm a Christian I agree with that statement amen the one pot can't call the uh the the pot can't call the uh call the kettle black or greasy one's just as black as the other one just as dirty as the other one but what's the matter it's because there's no security in those things it's played out a little further down he says don't care how much money you can make or how many buildings you can build or how much president you could come of any company it's falling crumbling the thoughts in my mind now of that third Angel's message that would be brother brenham's Ministry the third Angel flying through Heaven the third Angel's message that went forth Martin Luther John Wesley in the next Angel what did the last Angel's message say when he crossed the Three Angels Babylon is Fallen is fallen and become the habitation of every unclean Spirit that's EXA exactly where it's at we have no security in our Nation it's uncertain everywhere uncertainty there's uncertainty in your job uncertainty in politics uncertainty in Democrat Party uncertainty in Republican party uncertainty in all parties and in the church it's also uncertainty how can we have about 900 different organizations and every one of them different one to the other and fussing with one another how can a poor lady know what to do how can the people know where to stand right praise God it I think he's Shing telling us that there's no uncertainty there's no certainty anywhere it's all uncertainty everywhere and this was 1961 when he made these statements so if we could just fast forward amen 60 whatever 63 years now it's more uncertain than it's ever been the world is perilous the conditions are are are we're seeing extreme everywhere extreme in weather extreme in Politics Nation against nation of pestilences earthquakes in diverse places all the signs that we told we would see they're all present but we should be more secure than we've ever been when the world gets more insecure and there's more uh uh uh insecurity all around our security should be growing amen because our God Amen he's come on the scene in this last day and peeled back the great mystery of his word and open his book so that we can see he has a plan he's always had a plan and everything's worked according to his plan and nothing's out of plan and he's got everything under control and we should find ourselves by the grace of God in the palm of his hand amen and then we have nothing to fear praise God Jesus makes this statement in Luke 21 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken so men's hearts are failing for fear they're running to drugs and entertainment and and if they don't go to illegal drugs they're going to legal drugs through psychiatrists and all just to cope with the way the world is they fry their brains on entertainment and video games and YouTube videos and they're trying to keep themselves completely distracted because it's the only place to find any peace is distraction from the world right because there's no certainty in the world it's it's gone into chaos and uh when we want to look at insecurity we have to go back to the beginning so let's go to Genesis chapter 2 and if I speak from our Human Experience not from our Born Again experience but from our Human Experience I could say that we are all insecure every human being is born insecure and lives a life of insecurity amen because he lost his security at the fall and so he's born in sin he comes into the world he's shaping in iniquity comes through the world speaking lies he's alienated from the things of God and and his mind is darkened to the things of God and so how can there be any security so we talk about insecure people but in reality all human beings are insecure in Genesis CH 2 let's look at verse 8 said and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed so we know God by the power of the spoken word he created and and formed everything on the earth and what he was doing was reforming the Earth after destruction after a chaos and he was putting it in perfect order and when he got everything right amen then he had an Eden there which was which was his pleasure and then he built he made a garden Eastward in Eden and there he placed the man whom he had formed and this word Garden means an enclosure an enclosed Garden so what did God do God had the man in perfect security this is when man was Secure right here is when he was Secure he was Secure in everything God made everything was in harmony nothing was out the kilter nothing died no no animal ate another animal there would everything was in Perfect Harmony and unity and everything the Earth was Secure and God's son and his wife were secure why because Garden means an enclosure so where did God put him God put him in security he was in perfect security but we know that that man left he left the word of God and by leaving the word of God he was sent out of the garden and when he was sent out of the garden Garden he left his place of security and he be became insecure and let's look at Genesis 3 now Genesis 3 Verse 6 this is the Temptation in the fall it says in verse six and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons right here it begins because all of the sudden they're insecure about themselves they had been naked for how long I don't know how many years how much time had went on but they were in a place of security and innocency then brother B said they were under a veil of innocency and they weren't they weren't insecure about anything they weren't insecure about food they weren't insecure about shelter they weren't insecure about Safety and Security they W insecure about themselves in any way but the moment they fall all of the sudden insecurity comes and now they have to cover themselves and brother man tells they formed their own religion what were they trying to do they were trying to cover their sin but they did it by their own mechanism to cover their sin but even their covering for their sin didn't bring security amen it was a false security because you realize you know they they they had to make a covering now their eyes were open they recognize they were naked and we know the nature of the sin how that their eyes were open and so they made themselves aprons because aprons were an attempt to cover the sin amen but but but no matter how much they make believe that everything was all right and everything was covered as soon as the voice of God came walking in the garden amen they were really insecure so insecure listen everything begins in Genesis amen you start by leaving the word amen leaving perfect security you take your own decision and insecurity sits in when insecurity sits in then you try to find security in something you can do and a man-made security they attached that man-made security to them and no doubt made believe that everything was all right but in the presence of God Amen the insecurity that was buried in their heart could not be hid everything starts in Genesis that is what we're still living with today he goes on in verse n and the Lord God I'm sorry in verse 8 and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God this is the first time they've ever been insecure with their relationship with God there was a perfect Security in their environment a perfect Security in themselves and a perfect Security in the relationship with God but now now at the fall they were insecure in their environment they were insecure with themselves and they were insecure with their relationship with God and tell me what every human being is still dealing with the same thing and the Lord God called unto Adam and said Adam said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself those are absolutely tragic words he had lost his security insecurity had set in and now the plague in humanity had begun we come into this world and we are insecure some of us suffer with different insecurities and more severe than others in certain areas but but we come insecure and as we grow older it becomes more and more evident how in in Secure we are because as we get older we try everything under the sun to bring security and it's all brings a false sense of security there's only one place to find security and that's in the palm of his hand it's the only place that will ever find a place for our heart to come to rest is in the palm of his hand nothing else will work when I looked at this uh uh term inse insecure I just went to the um uh Mariam web 's dictionary online and just got the definition so we'll begin to look at the definition and they break it into five different types first is a deficiency in assurance beset by fear and anxiety insecurity can be summed up by a deficiency in assurance and you're not assured of something Part B to this is not highly stable or well adjusted so you can be insecure in school you're not highly stable or well adjusted Ed you can be insecure in anything new number two not confident or sure it's uncertain number three not adequately guarded or sustained like unsafe not adequately guarded or sustained not firmly fastened or fixed like shaky something's unstable and number five unable to reliably afford or access what is needed to meet one's basic needs so like food security that the UN keeps talking about unable to afford or access what is needed to meet one's basic needs these are all different types of insecurity these are different ways of being insecure I should say it that way and so we find that we are all plagued with this in the human realm but I don't want my spiritual life to be plagued by this right there has to be a security that will do away with the insecurity and Christ is our security when I began to meditate on this I realized that that this is a plague amongst human beings so we can't anyone Escape it you can say well that person's insecure and that person is insecure and that yeah and so are you so I mean so what maybe somebody's is more obvious than yours but you're insecure too I guarantee it amen the only place that we can find our security is in Christ CU he is our security we won't find it anywhere else uh we won't find it in accounts and it's amazing how this world makes us insecure the news makes us insecure so if you have a news feed one of the objectives of news is to make you insecure because then it it brings to your attention the danger that's in the world there's either danger by car accident there's danger by natural disaster there's danger from other human beings there's danger from Wars there's danger in the environment there there the the news is constantly telling you you're in danger so the news breeds insecurity but the gospel is the good news amen and that good news brings you security that you're safe from all of these things and so we're we're surrounded by insecurity and what the news does and and what the government does and what everybody does is tell you you're insecure and then what they do is they bring a false sense of security you're insecure because when you get older you won't be able to work so we have social security you have a 401k plan we have this and that but really it's a false sense of security because there's no guarantee that it'll be there when you get there to need it amen and even if it is there who's who's to say it's enough and maybe you will never make it there or when you make it there it may not be there or when you make it there it may not be enough or or when you get there it may be enough money to sustain your life but will it save your children will it solve your problems will it take care no there's no security anywhere all these are human measures to find some way of bringing peace to a heart that's troubled we tried through laws and through regulations and through all of these things they're trying to bring us security amen it's amazing how much how much the the the world spends on defense spending I think it's so funny too defense spending America spends billions on defense spending when was the last time America had to defend its territory that's not defense spending they're the military arm of the Vatican they're going out trying to fight all the Vatican Wars it's not defense spending we have nobody attacking the United States it brings a false sense of security even the terminology brings a false sense of security we try to secure ourselves with tanks and missiles and ballistic missiles and that's no security unless the Lord keeps a house they labor in vain unless the Lord Keeps Us build a city they labor in vain that building unless the Lord keeps a house they labor in vain that watch so there's no security all these things are false measures of security trying to calm an anxious heart and it and is never going to work that's why the world becomes more neurotic all the time and I I think about how we pass on insecurity to one another in the simplest of ways I was I was just meditating because it's so easy to do you think if you have you take a parent you have a mother or father who's afraid of water they're going to P they're going to do their best to pass that insecurity onto their child they're terrified of water and every time that toddler starts running towards the water they scream they overreact they run they scoop them M they yell no no no don't you go near that and and and it may have been just a small amount of water no apparent danger no real risk the reaction was an overreaction and all of a sudden this little child it begins to realize that water's bad water's dangerous water is something Mom and Dad don't like and then as they get older you tell them it's dangerous and you could drown and then when they get little older you tell them all the stories of all the children who have drowned and you think you're keeping them safe you're not keeping them safe what you're doing is building an insecurity and actually it's dangerous because you won't let them experience water in a safe way so they can build up a they can overcome a fear and build up an ability to navigate through the water and not be terrified and be able to swim so that if they ever do happen to fall in the water all those stories of drowning are't in their mind and the terror of mom and they start thrashing around they can't swim they overreact they drown it was your insecurity you put on your child and you created a dangerous situation that's an easy that's that's an easy one that to look at but we do that with religion we do that with salvation we do that all the time we take our own insecurity and religion and we put it on our kids amen cuz we don't really have any peace so we'll clamp down on them cuz we can't overcome sin so all of a sudden we k all kinds of of legalistic restrictions on our kids because there's nothing in me that has a power to overcome sin there certainly can't be anything in you and I put my insecurity religiously on my kids and now they're afraid of everything in the world and God has no power to help anybody overcome any Temptation or luster it's a human insecurity but by the grace of God God is going to help us overcome that in this generation cuz he's provided everything we need and the fullness of of the word brought back the fullness of the spirit which brought the power to live the word amen praise God so we can overreact we can become too strict and it's all based on fear and insecurity and try to build a false security with a system of religion or a set of strict rules and it it's not going to work any better than the missile defense system is going to keep the bomb from Russia from falling in America right cuz the prophet already told us it's going to fall doesn't matter how much they spend on defense spending right right am you take a you take a mother or a father who hates peas detest peas you know you get a little baby food jar of peas and some brings that jar over and the first thing they say is oh she won't like that how do you know she won't like that so crack it open and you take a little bit out and you put it and as you're doing it you're making a yucky face it's your distaste not that child you make your face and what do you think that baby's going to do and then maybe the baby likes it you put it in the mouth but you know they can't work their tongue yet and they like they licking it but their tongue pushes it back out oh they don't like it I knew she didn't like it brother it's funny but it's not funny when we do it with religion it's not funny when we do it with other things in life you know what we need as parents we know what we need as ministers you know what we need as church leaders you know we need as Elders we need security we need security that comes from the word of God so that we don't keep passing religious security down and creating more insecurities by building a false sense of security that will never work amen we need the genuine we need the real we need to know that we're secure we need to be as secure as Israel was when God was the Watchman on the wall not because they had walled cities not because they had huge armies not because they had great fortifications they were just they were just slaves that were marching through a Wilderness amen but they had a chief Captain they had somebody that was watching over them that's the security that we need amen I was thinking uh uh I was meditating actually this morning I remember there was a time when I was an 18-year-old boy and I got a I got a uh I was working at a at a grocery store I was in Cincinnati working at a grocery store as a student in school in college and I was working as a as a a produce attendant and I was stacking the shelves and I don't know what I was doing probably rotating produce and I somebody came up to me from the front office and said Chad you got a call it's it's urgent and I went to the phone and it was my brother and he told me that my dad had just passed away and and instantly I mean you can't imagine what it was like going from moving produce around to getting a phone call from your brother he's weeping on the other end and I tell you that to tell you this for years I was terrified every time I got a phone call it did something to me that when I got an urgent call or somebody says hey somebody's trying to get a hold of you they need you to call back right now whenever there was that scenario something in me my heart would start beating fast I would get sweaty I'd start to get nervous in my stomach and there was nothing wrong there was nothing to be afraid of but because I had that tragic experience in my life now anything that was similar to that would cause a reaction in me I was afraid to answer the phone sometimes I'd overreact and run as fast as I could or but by the grace of God he worked that out of me and I'm thankful but you realize how easy it is for these things to come into our life amen and what we need is we need God to heal our hearts amen because we can't live life In Fear And Terror because we're in the palm of his hand nothing's going to happen I used to I after that happened I would actually after I got married and after I had children I would actually Envision what that call would be like coming from my for somebody calling about my spouse or one of my children and I would terrorize myself because it was an old wound an old uh trauma in my life but but praise God I have found my security in the word amen to overcome that so there are things that happen to us that we can't control we can't just say stop being insecure I'll try I mean I'll I'll do what I can I I'll I'll stop trying to be afraid of heights or afraid of water or afraid of a phone I'll try but you know no matter how much you try you can't just stop feeling insecure because the only way to stop feeling insecure is to all of a sudden feel secure so how in the world am I going to feel secure if I have no real security I'm going to have to find security but it's got to be real and genuine and everlasting and and it can't be it can't be uh it can't be a security that fails or is flawed or won't hold up so we have to find that security in the word of God and this is what heals our heart when we find in the word and in the scripture that God is faithful to his word and he's made precious promises to us that word can heal our heart and bring us a security that can help us overcome trauma in life overcome things that have happened in the past overcome things that are still troubling us you're not going to find it at a psychiatrist office you're not going to find it by jumping into entertainment and you're not going to find it by pretending it's not there you're going to only find it in the word of God Amen by the grace of God his spirit will come and make that word live inside of us and it'll bring a true genuine security to where I'm actually not at all afraid of a phone call and those thoughts never enter my mind anymore because I know everything's under control God knows what's going to happen and I don't have to be afraid of what will happen because God's got a time and a purpose for everything and if God allows something to happen it's the very best thing that could happen we got to come to that kind of reality it's that's got to be that can't just be something we say because you can say that all you want and then you'll go around acting completely insecure ringing your hands being nervous and upset so it's just words coming out of a mouth that doesn't that doesn't bring security when the Revelation strikes the heart that's what brings security right amen so we do this to one another all the time we do this to our children yes the government does it to us if we've had a bad Church experience and people in the church have heard us or our ministers heard us then all a sudden we don't want to trust church people and we don't want to trust the church and we don't want to trust ministers and and God can heal all of that amen because God has to have a real genuine church somewhere he has to have a real fful Ministry there's got to be if God set it up and told us to submit ourselves to there's got to be a real one somewhere and notice I didn't say a perfect one because there's not a perfect one anywhere but there's got to be a real one somewhere a real body of Believers that want to serve God and genuinely love each other a real Ministry that wants to serve God's people and Minister the pure word of God it has to be alive somewhere because it's the word of God so some of those things we have to get over we have to look at the word and say God I need some security from your word because I've been made insecure by past hurts of ministers past hurts from churches and the problem is we'll pass that right down to our children because we'll be reluctant to enter into Fellowship we'll be reluctant to receive from a minister and then we'll tell our children things like be careful be careful of what just be careful don't get too tied into the church don't don't be too trusting all of a sudden what kind of seeds have we sown you think God wants us not to trust in his word not to trust that he can provide we can't pass these things on to one another if there's anything I want to pass on let me pass on faith in the word of God confidence in Jesus Christ to keep me an absolute faith that God will keep his word no matter how many people fail God will keep his word if it didn't work 15 times it'll work the next time cuz God can't fail brother B said if I called a prayer line and every person in that prayer line died the next day I died that night the next day I'd have a prayer line pray for people cu the word Can't Fail it's not confidence in man it's confidence in God so there's so many things that create insecurity there's only one that I know of that creates security and that's Christ I want to go through some scriptures as we look at this because I I think we can find that everything that we have to be insecure about he is provided in the word and I'm going to go through scriptures fast that's why I did a PowerPoint today so I can go scripture to scripture so if you just keep your notepad have handy if you want these scriptures just jot them down amen because we're going to keep moving fast so I first want to look at what it means to be secure so we looked at insecure so what is secure this is the same thing out of Miriam Webster's dictionary online free from danger does Christ make us free from danger affording safety and they use the example a secure Hideway is Christ a secure Hideway trustworthy and dependable is Christ trustworthy independable free from risk of loss everything that I commit unto him will I lose it no two easy in mind being confident having confidence can I be confident in him assured an opinion having no doubt amen can he take away all my doubts can he give me his faith so that I have confidence in him assured that means a secure Victory I'm assured of overcoming I'm assured of being delivered I'm assured of being rescued and four able to re reliably afford or access what is needed to meet one's basic needs can he meet all my needs can he afford it or access it yes so we find that our security is found in him let's look at insecure again a deficiency in assurance beset by fear and anxiety a defici this is one that's amazing to me a deficiency and Assurance so if if my insecurity comes from a deficiency in assurance I have to find a place to get Assurance yes and that if I get Assurance it'll overcome a deficiency in assurance so if I can find Assurance then I'll be secure not because I do some mental exercise not because I say something out of my mouth not because I distracted myself with other things or I created a false uh protection from none of that will work because it can't get rid of the insecurity in your heart your bank account can't take care of that your job can't take care of that the government can't take care of that and your spouse can't even take care of that your mother and father can't take care of that your minister your pastor your church can't take care of that there's nothing that can take care of the insecurity in your heart everything else becomes something to put Security in that will fail the only thing that won't fail is Jesus Christ a deficiency in assurance not highly stable or well adjusted so this is where I want to start going through some scriptures because we want to find our security in the word Hebrews 10:21 and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised where's my Assurance my Assurance is Faith where did I get Faith it was a gift from God and I have Assurance in faith I don't have Assurance in all these physical things but I have Assurance in faith that he who promised it cannot Fail 1 John 4:17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear had torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us so what will take care of the fear in my heart the Revelation that he first loved me when I was unlovable before I deserved his love before I could do anything that would Merit his love he loved me first and because he loved me first he's gave me the capacity to love him back and that amen that will do away and dispel fear because fear is what brings insecurity so what will bring security the Revelation that he loved me first but what if I mess up he loved you while you were messing up he loved you in the midst of your messing up he he loved you before you knew that you could even do right before you even attempted to do right he loved you first that's why you love him and let that dispel the fear amen and we could go on and on and on through the Bible but I just grabbed just a couple scriptures for each one not confident or sure not being conf this is another insecurity another way we can be insecure not having confidence or not being sure you know this is a trag tragedy when it comes to the message we go to a message Church we sit we claim We believe We Worship but if we're not actually confident that it's the truth it's going to show up somewhere in our lives it there's no way you can't fake this you can't pretend it there'll be enough circumstances in your life that that'll pop out amen but we got to find by the grace of God a confidence and an assurance that this message is the truth and you can only receive that by divine revelation God's got to plan it in your heart and reveal himself to you CU this message is Christ amen and he must reveal himself to you that this is me and if we can't find that there's going to be a problem somewhere down the road in Jeremiah 31:3 it says the Lord hath appeared of old and said unto me and old unto me saying y have I loved thee with an Everlasting Love Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee why did God draw you because he he loved you with with an everlasting love not a love that Fades not one he can change his mind but he loved you with an everlasting love and because he loved you with an everlasting love he drew you how did you get here how did you hear the message how who who drew you did you bring yourself or did God bring you if he drew you then he loves you with an everlasting love Isaiah 30:15 for thus sayith the Lord God the Holy One of Israel and return turning and rest shall you be saved and quietness and confidence shall be your strength what am I what am I supposed to where's my strength come from in rest in quietness and confidence my strength doesn't come from action my strength comes from rest and confidence in God why because it's never my strength my strength is Never Enough the strength that I have in myself is never enough to accomplish anything to save myself to deliver myself to overcome anything that's not mine so I'm relying on his and how do I know where his strength is it rests in his word amen so I have to just rest amen and wait with confidence on him to perform his word and that's my strength Ephesians 3:11 according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have Bolden and access with confidence by the faith of him he has given us the faith that gives us boldness and confidence am it doesn't come it it doesn't come just by working it up amen boldness and confidence doesn't come by working it up it comes by confidence by faith of him that's his faith he's given to us it's not not just working up our faith but it's actually a gift of his faith and that's where our confidence comes and that's what gives us boldness and access with confidence 1 John 5 and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desire of him now there's no reason to have no confidence and not be sure why because I'm not looking at myself I'm looking at him he's the one who purchased he's purchased full all Redemption all that was lost in Redemption he purchased it back by his own blood I'm looking to his blood I'm looking to him I'm not looking to myself I'm looking at his word the promise he made me and my confidence now is in resting in him to perform his word if not we strain and we try and we press and we get more tired and more frustrated and more discouraged and and we start to our faith starts to wne why because we were trying to use our efforts to do something and our efforts will always collapse but our strength is in quiet confidence number three not adequately guarded or sustained being unsafe this is another insecurity not adequately guarded or sustained do we we know how risky life life is and there's danger all around but you're still in the palm of his hand remember when that tornado is barreling towards your house you're in the palm of his hand when that car is barreling through the intersection you're in the palm of his hand there's nothing that can take away from the security you have in the palm of his hand so not feeling adequately guarded or sustained in Philippians he says being confident of this very thing that he which ha begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ here's the question has he begun a good work in you if he's begun it then it's guaranteed to the Finish Line he doesn't finish what he started if he started it he'll finish it there's no way that he can fail to finish what he started amen if if if he didn't start it then we we should be nervous but if he begun the work he's going to finish it what do we need to do we need to quietly trust in him and have confidence in him who will finish his own work Proverbs 810 the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and is Sav the name of the Lord we have his name because his name denotes his person his presence who he is and he's given us his name this day in fact we bear his name Mrs Jesus Christ we are in the Strong Tower of his presence of his person he's unfolding holded himself to us and we are locked in that Tower listen this message is not tapes and books this message wasn't somebody's idea this message is Jesus Christ the word the living word that has been restored to us in this day and it is a strong tower that we run into I'm not talking about a set of doctrines I'm not talking about a one man's preaching I'm talking about Christ the word that has made himself manifest in this end time that's the message if we talk about the message and you see a a Healing Ministry and you see a prophetic Ministry and you see books and tapes you're not even seeing the message yet you're seeing the mechanism God used to bring the message to us but the message is Christ restored back to his church to come in Union with his bride that is the message he is the message the message is he is here to unite with you and he is the word made flesh and he is a strong tower that we run into amen it's why this word can't fail in this generation we're not insecure or unstable I mean if you look at me in my flesh I am but if you look at the inner man you look at Christ in me there's no instability there's nothing unstable there's nothing unsecure it's all been secured from before the foundation of the world you can see how powerful this Revelation is and how much we need the revelation of the hour because if not we're going to be tossed about on on these on these waves that are rolling all around us and we'll be tossed up and down and we'll have no real security but our anchor will hold because our anchor is tied to the unmovable word of God if we have a different idea every day you know a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways we need to come back to having confidence in what God's given us and keeping our confidence rested there in Matthew 28 he says and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth all power go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I'm with you all way even to the end of the world who's with you the one who had all power in Heaven and Earth given to him and he's with you to the end of the world am are you secure yes I believe you're secure do you always feel secure no that's why we've been trained not to trust our feelings but to be but to have faith in the word of God I got a feeling we're going to have to pass this test and we're going to have to pass it again and again and again where we stop relying on the way we feel about something and start looking at where our faith is in the word and put our confidence in him and put our confidence in the word and and because we could get tossed all about emotionally amen we're emotional wreck someday amen and we feel good and we feel bad and we feel like we have Victory we feel like we have defeat but we got to stop moving with the feelings and stay fastened to the word because that's the only thing that's going to overcome in this generation there's there's there's news coming so fast there's been never been a generation that gets information as fast as we get information and every tragedy that strikes anywhere can be can be sent to you and you can be notified of it within minutes of the tragedy and they can pile up one after another there's a flood somewhere an earthquake somewhere a war somewhere your grandma's sick and your great uncle just died and you can get all that the same day listen how in the world are we going to cope no wonder the world's going crazy they can't deal with this much negative information all the time oh and by the way interest rates are High houses are still expensive and the and it looks like the economy could collapse any minute yes we had to get to the place that says that that doesn't move me that has nothing to do with it amen that all may happen but I've never seen the righteous forsaken or God's seed begging bread I'm in the palm of his hand there's no insecurity in their news there's no my security is not the financial system of America or the world I I I'm not my my my my my my existence is not based on the government I exist because God wants me here to shine his light and as long as he wants me here shining his light nothing's going to take me off of this Earth and take me out of my position and the minute he's done with me and removes me I'll be glad for the exit ramp to go to the sixth Dimension I can't lose there's nothing that's going to hinder me what do do I have to feel insecure about the Creek's Rising the Creek's Rising let's move to Higher Ground And if I can't get to Higher Ground he's going to have to deliver me and if he doesn't deliver me he's taking me home where's the insecurity amen th this bride amen we may face more and more pressure as time goes on I I don't know and I and I I really don't want to uh uh project bad Omens but there's a lot that the prophet told us and it looks like things can get pretty tight and kind of squeezy and maybe pretty difficult amen and we're going to have to stop trusting feelings and quit looking to anybody else for security we got to get to the place where my husband is all that I need he provides everything for me I'm secure because he said I was Secure I rest cuz he told me to rest amen he told me that he's watching over me he's my shepherd I'm in the palm of his hand he's the Strong Tower I mean how many scriptures do we need to go through but you know what happens the very next time we get bad news every one of those scriptures just out of our mind and all we can think about is what kind of cancer was that they told me ciroma Comm Sama something and that's normal that's human you don't have to feel bad because you're trying to remember what thect told you but just don't dwell on that too long before you come back to the scripture and say but by his stripes I'm Healed that God will never allow anything to happen that he hasn't approved of first there's a purpose in all of this and I though I am tried I shall come forth this go why can't we just speak the scriptures and stop speaking Medical Science and stop talking about disasters and talking about all the negative things and how are you doing doing horrible this happen that happened the plant CL and and and and I lost my job and and the bills are coming due and oh oh who who whoa that tends to be the way I talk if you don't know I preach to myself a lot but why can't we say praise God the plant closed I lost my job and I got bills due I can't wait to see what he's going to do this time because he made a promise to me I can't wait to share the testimony in the church I can't wait to tell you what what's going to happen amen and it drag drags on and it drags on and you get beat down and you get wore out but praise God Amen the testimony gets greater as time goes on Lord help that to be my perspective all the time that's the right perspective you say well sounds like you lost your mind praise God mind was defective anyways I think I'll take the mind of Christ over mind any day that's the one that's going to do me good and that's the is going to get me out of here praise God now let's look at this fourth definition not firmly fastened or fixed shaky are we on Shaky Ground amen praise God 1 Corinthians according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another build it there on but let every man take heed how he build it there on for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ what Foundation are you on is it in any way shaky is it any way unstable if you're built on the foundation of Jesus Christ which the true church is built on then there's nothing shaky about your position praise God Ephesians 2:19 now now there you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into a holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit are we on a good foundation we are on a good foundation the world is shaking brother said the world is falling apart let her fall apart it's going to fall fall apart but one thing's not going to fall apart God and His seed are not going to fall apart the word is not going to fail Matthew 16:16 and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it what's the church built on on the foundation what Foundation The Rock The Rock of R the revelation of Jesus Christ is the rock that the church has built on and it's unmovable unshakable amen it's not Te You the church has never been teetering always been secure in Christ he is our security remember Jesus told the parable of the man who built his house on the rock and the man who built his house on the sand and he likened the man who built his house on the on the Rock and see the waves came the floods Rose and the waves beat vly and the wind blew anden one house stood and one house fell because one was secure one was insecure the one that was insecure had no Foundation I mean it was on the sand that moves and shifts that's the ideas of man the ideas of man move and shift feelings move and shift if you're if your Christian experien is based on a Feeling or a sensation you had alone that's shifting sand but it must be based on the word of God Amen our feelings our emotions they change our ideas the ideas of groups of people they change but Christ never changes God said I am God and I change not and he said the one who built his house is the one who heard my word and did it it's simple the one who received my word and just surrendered to it and obeyed it that's the one whose house is built on this rock the one who had another idea or a better idea or a church system that had some other idea other than the obedience to the word amen that fell down in the time of storm but in the time of the storm the one that was fastened and attached to the word by obedience to the word that one stood the test of time I thank God he's restored his word yeah so that we're not guessing anymore we're not hoping but God in a prophetic Ministry to restore the word so that we know what he expects and what he wants and what we can surrender ourselves to so that we can be fastened to the Rock now we look at this fifth one unable to reliably afford or access what is needed to meet one's basic needs it's interesting so they talk about food security all time in the united nationes there's people with food insecurity they can't access they can't get to the food uh uh they can't purchase it but when we look at it for us unable to reliably afford or access what is needed to meet one's basic needs you know we may come to this place before we're out of here it's a possibility based off things that the prophet told us and you know what that little plastic card that you pull out of your wallet and use when you buy groceries that may not work someday and every government system May Fail and if it doesn't fail it may fail us because we won't be part of the system we're going to have to know where our substance comes from we're going to have to know who's been providing it all along never was your job it never was your account it never was your card it never was the government that's never what provided it those are the mechanisms God used to feed you and care for you but that God's not limited to those mechanisms when they go away he has mother other mechanism when Elijah lost his mechanism he sent Ravens when when the brook dried up he sent her to a widow woman God has never been without resources amen when Elijah was running away and there was no widow woman and there was no Ravens he just sent an angel to bake him some special cakes amen when when when Elisha the prophet was in Dothan and he was surrounded amen by the armies of Syria and and and his servant wakes up and he's and he's all nervous because we're surrounded by the Syrian Army Elisha wasn't worried at all amen he had nothing to feel insecure about amen why should Elisha feel insecure amen he could look out in the spirit and he could see surrounding the Syrian Army was another Army and it was angels and Chariots of Fire all upon the hillside he had nothing to feel insecure about Gazza couldn't look into the spirit ual realm so Gaza could only see in the natural and in the natural it looked like he was at risk it looked like he was in danger it looked like he was insecure but the truth is he was never in danger he was never insecure he was never at risk and that's what Elisha knew and brother bam told us he comes to a meeting and he says there's Angels lining the walls of this building and the question is can we look into the spiritual realm and recognize that the angel of the Lord encompasses about them that fear Him Amen in the times of trouble in the times of disaster in the times of fear amen you can't stop your body from reacting to a situation you can't stop the anxiety the adrenaline dumb you can't stop that that's just a natural reaction because you live in a natural body but as soon as you get a hold of your senses you have to say wait a minute flesh I know you're scared and I know you're reacting amen but there's another Power higher than whatever power we're facing and that's the power of God he's promised in his word and his word can't fail so listen here flesh you who wants to run away and you who's scared and you want to scream stop it sometimes we just have to know how to possess our vessel and not let our vessel possess us we've got we've got to learn how to rule and reign with Christ so we got to rule and Reign this little bit of Earth first before we rule in the m ium and sometimes you got to pull it back down and say wait a minute you're not running this show you're not leading our decisions I'm not following your lead you little terrified scaredy cat who are you talking to the one in the mirror you stop it right now yes because I put my trust in the Lord and he shall deliver me amen why do you think we keep facing trials and why do you think they keep getting more intense and why because we're in training friends we're learning how to depend on him we think that many times we think it's just a bunch of random bad things that happen to us and you're a child of God you're part of the economy of God part of the kingdom of God you're an attribute that was from his mind a part of himself that he's put in the flesh to manifest the word and something random just happened to you on something bad random random and bad and it just happened to you no see the Revelation brings us back to the truth Revelation just wasn't so that we can know the Bible better than every other every other denomination knows the Bible it actually must produce something inside of us it come to bring us Faith so that we know that these things are true we know it's true that I'm not in danger am am I having a trial absolutely Ely but he promised that there would be trials that's also part of the word he promised that a man that is born of a woman is a few days in full of troubles he told his disciples the world will hate you they will even kill some of you he never he never gave them a false understanding he told them you're going to be tried you're going to be tested there's going to be hard things that happen to you amen look at the Heroes of Faith in Hebrews 11 amen was God not on the scene was he not in control anymore no he was working his plan and that was part of of the plan but when bad things happen as he told when he when he we talked about on Wednesday when he told Peter or Paul the Apostle Paul am mean he had a horrible Affliction a messenger of the devil sent to Buffet him and he wanted it to go away I think you would too and when he sought God three times the Lord says basically I'm not going to take it away because of the abundance of Revelation I need you to stay humble but listen Paul my grace is sufficient for you don't worry about this ailment you've got an ailment it's going to stay there don't worry about this family situation it's going to stay there don't worry about that it may remain it may go it may remain but no whether it goes or remains don't forget his grace is sufficient for you too he'll give us the grace to pass through our trials why because they're part of him manifesting himself it's part of him declaring himself upon the Earth praise God so unable to reliably afford or access what is needed but my God shall supply all can you read that word all my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus well God promised to supply all my need just remember all your need may not be a bigger house and a better job and a nicer car that may not be your need but he has promised to supply all your need I mean he's not going to fulfill the lust of the flesh pride of life that's not what he's here to do will he pour blessings on yes will he give us an abundance yes will he give us more than we ask how many can say that's absolutely the truth he gives more than you ask he showers bless he gives in abundance he does but he's not here to answer the prayer of lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life he promised to supply all of your need then as a loving father many times he gives you in abundance and for that we say thank thank you but when he says no can we say thank you CU he's promised to supply all of our need Philippians he says be careful for nothing that word careful means anxious be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus I love this he says don't be anxious for anything but in everything in prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving so you ask God you ask God to help then you thank him for his help let your request be made known to God and and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds what do he promised to give you maybe not the want you asked for but peace he will give you the peace which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus what does peace do it takes away insecurity peace takes away insecurity and he's promised to give us peace John 16:23 and in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you what whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it you hither to have you asked nothing in my name asked and you shall receive that your joy may be full does God want to provide he wants to provide does he want us to ask he wants us to ask Will We lack and be without I ask you a question insecure you become insecure when you don't have the funds or the access to things that you need well if I was looking at myself to provide everything I need I should just start feeling insecure right now but if I don't look at myself and I look at him to be the one that provides he's the one who told us that that don't don't seek after garments don't worry about reignment don't worry about all these things the Gentiles seek after that but consider the Lily it neither toils nor spin but Solomon in all of his glory was not AR raid like one of these amen look at the bird not not one of them falls to the ground that God doesn't know and they have no no material value if God looks after a bird what about you he wants to provide and I want his provision I want his provision more than all of my wants because my wants may come out wrong my wants may lead me astray my wants may come from the wrong motivation amen I want him to supply all my needs and I want him to be the one who decides what I need will I ask yes he told me to ask I'll ask and then I'll Trust I'll ask and trust him to give amen it's like when your child ask for a popsicle and you give him a carrot I remember we had little kids you know they were done eating you know you have vegetables there and you have some meat and you have all kinds of good things and I'm not hungry and then you let them know that we have chocolate cake I want a piece I thought you said you weren't hungry one of them told us one day well I'm not hungry for this food I'm hungry for that food you said you weren't hungry but you're hungry I don't want to be like that with what God's provided me I asked for something and he gives me the best thing I need we pray for comfort and peace and he gives us trials and tribulations amen because trials and tribulations are are better than Comfort or peace our Comforts are just beyond the river and when he gives me a carrot instead of a popsicle I want to say thank you Lord you provide all my needs praise be to God Amen what are we preaching about maturity yeah but it's such a simple subject and we're failing every day right amen my brother Chad this is so simple it's absolutely so simple and it's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life is to reing this flesh in to stop chasing security elsewhere and stay planted on the word and the word only and stop trying in my own measure and stop looking to someone else to save me and stay fastened to the word and trust God for everything I need I don't know about you but I need this lesson and need it again and again and again Amen brother Bon the message a true sign that's overlooked he says as I said a few Sundays ago I thought somewhere along the road it's not a fallout shelter it's a Fallin shelter where we fall into it headlong with all of our heart and all of our soul and all of our mind into Christ God's Ark of Safety people are looking for Fallout shelters I'm looking for the Fallin shelter I want to fall on that stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands I want to run into that strong tower and be saved amen I want to be found in Christ because how can you have any greater security than in in Christ amen and how can you have any greater Security in your heart than Christ in you the hope of glory you in him and him in you that's our security praise God John 14 he says these things have I spoken unto you being yet with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I said unto you peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid he's giving true peace not the false peace not what the world offers but he gives us true peace amen amen oh praise God I I think I went the wrong way okay I want to go to one scripture I don't have it in my in my slides but if you turn with me to Ephesians chapter 1 brother BR makes a statement and I want to look at that statement that I want to read here from Ephesians chapter 1 and this comes from questions and answers in 1961 I don't even remember what the question was that was asked but I just pulled this little excerpt out of it and brother B says if you know noticed Paul in going down he always had trouble with the Corinthian Church he never found them that way he never said nothing about it to the Ephesian church he could teach them eternal security there's nothing about eternal security in the Corinthian Church they were always babies trying one's got a tongue one's got a PSAL isn't that right and so now he begins to parallel the Epistles to the Corinthians with the Epistles to the Ephesians and he shows how the Ephesians were more mature and in their maturity they weren't struggling about the gifts and they weren't arguing about ones of apollis and ones of this and ones of that and me and they weren't they weren't uh uh misusing the gifts and but he shows in Ephesians or in Corinthians and he types it with the Pentecostal move and he shows how they were just babies and they were just like all the steam was going out the whistle and none of it was getting into the wheels to move the train down the these are all things that he describes and so because the Corinthian Church was still uh focused on emotional things and signs and and wonders and and they weren't getting to the deeper things of God they were in this and they were arguing and they were fussing and he was dealing with them on this level but he couldn't deal with them on the level he dealt with them in the Ephesians the Ephesians he could take to a higher level and brother ties that with our day with the Pentecostal movement and and he he himself amen is trying to take the church back to Ephesians to the the beginning and brother M said there will be an Ephesians again in leoda so that means in the end we're going to go back to what the church was intended to be from the very beginning what Paul was setting in order when he was the Apostle to the first age and so when we come back to that we want to come back and see what the Ephesians had that the Corinthians didn't have the Corinthians had gifts but no real security because with all their manifestation of gifts they had infightings and they had insecurities and they had one there with his father's wife and they weren't dealing with they had all kinds of other issues going on and turmoil amen that he didn't have to deal with with the Ephesians the Ephesians he was taking to a higher order and that's where brother brandham came at the end of the Pentecostal uh the Pentecostal Revival and he was trying to take them back to what Paul taught and bring us to maturity and here in Ephesians 1:3 this is what Paul teaches blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places is in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world what is the deeper things it's bringing an absolute security to The Believer by revealing to them their origin the Corinthians couldn't go there yet they were too tied up in the other things but the Ephesians he was trying to take them to a greater revelation a greater understanding and he goes on to say I want to read that again verse four according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved what does this have to do with your works nothing he hath made us accepted in the Beloved if you've been accepted in the Beloved then you're secure amen why did he do that because he predestinated you to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ why because he chose you before the foundation of the world in him all of this goes back to God's desire and that's where our security comes from amen we live in a day where we've been returned back to what Paul taught back to the true security and that security goes all the way back to the mind of God before the foundation of the world before anything was spoken to existence before anything was created your security today is linked back to them and you're just as secure today as you were as an attribute in his thought this is what it means to they going to be in Ephesians again in leoda what does that mean there's a church that's coming back to what Paul taught coming back to the security of eternal security not in a false way where I'm Eternal secure and I can do whatever I want where the Baptist ruined it but through the real genu way genuine revelation of who you actually are who you are in the depths of your soul and what God had planned for you from before the foundation of the world so that we don't get tossed about like children so that we don't get moved by everything that happens where we can keep our feet planted on the rock of Jesus Christ the revelation of who he is in this generation and not run and not move and not get scared and not look for salvation from anywhere else but from the Lord that's what this Revelation is to do to us amen it's not for puff up it's not for knowledge it's not for argument it's to keep your feet planted on the word so that you don't move in every trial in your life because God knew this before the foundation of the world he knew I would be here he planted his seed within me he sent the water of the word to bring this seed to life I've been in the sunlight of this message growing into His Image what do I have to be afraid of and why do I have to run round scared he's known this before the foundation of the world that's what this Revelation in the end time is supposed to do to us bring security not insecurity not not you have to do this to be a believer and you have to do that to to be in the message and you have to have this but that all breeds insecurity but the word brings security that I am who I am by the grace of God and he's called me he's drawn me I'm in his hands he knew me before the foundation of the world he planted my feet beat upon a rock the rock of this Revelation and now I cannot be moved not because of what I've done but because of what he determined before the foundation of the world when he made me accepted in the Beloved I don't have to perform things I don't have to accomplish things I don't have to manifest things amen so many times that confuses people when we go to the works trying to man trying to prove we're a Believer so that we can feel secure that we're a Believer dress right talk right go to right places don't go to the wrong places but listen that's a natural outcropping of being a Believer those things cannot make you a Believer what that'll do is increase your insecurity first thing we do is come to the security of Christ by the revelation of his predestinated plan for our life and then stay planted there and let the fruit just come out you mean I don't have to dress right I don't have to I don't listen you were a child of God before you knew how to dress you were a child of God before you knew how to walk you just weren't born again you weren't awakened to it you don't have to do any of those things you mean I don't have to do anything things no you don't brother Chad what are you saying saying you don't have to but if you're one of them it's the natural outflow of being a child of God it's what happens to the children of God they have a life with Jesus Christ they have a hidden life they've been behind the veil they have communion with Christ amen they love him with all of their heart they are secure in him he manifests himself through them and there's signs and wonders and dreams and Visions amen there's words of knowledge there's prayers that are answered there's Supernatural events in their life all of that is an outcropping of being a Believer but none of that can make you a Believer amen what do we need first I first need the revelation of who I am and I need the understanding of where I came from and why I'm here and how secure I am in the thoughts of God so that I can stay rooted and grounded in this word and lay in the presence of the son and let him draw the fruit out of the seed amen and what will we do dress right talk right go to the right places have the right kind of family uh apologize when we're wrong repent when we fail come to church submit to Ministry have manifestations life we'll have all of those things cuz that's the result so Paul now the Apostle Paul now is telling the Ephesians this really is bigger than you this started before you came here when and before the foundation of the world he already chose you in him you've been predestinated to be I'm striving for adoption listen you were predestinated to be adopted not because you strived and climb I climbed that pyramid yeah okay when you hit the ground again let's [Laughter] talk you're not climbing anything he's drawing You by his own power because you're in the palm of his hand he goes on here read verse six again to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein Heath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the of his grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will in him his will he purposed he did he accomplished in him are you getting it amen verse 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom also in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of your inheritance and to the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory question is are you secure I'll ask you in next question have you always been secure but I didn't feel secure was God waiting for your feelings before he finished his plan he formulated his plan before you could have feelings so your feelings won't change his plan let's look at the token he says we're not to come together to talk about the message we are come together to get in the message and the message is Christ he is the word and he is a strong tower that the righteous run into and are safe the message is Christ he is the word that's right we're not to get in into it get beneath it we are to get into it get beneath it yes sir that's what we're supposed to do he was not responsible for any person out from under the blood not one no matter who he was he was not responsible all had to take uh all had to take not only himself but his whole family they're only safe when the token was displayed we cannot feel safe until this token is displayed that's right you must come under this token God's holy spirit and it displays to you Jesus Christ because it comes and lives lives in you what is that that's his life what is that the seal that seals you to the day of redemption guarantee the earnest are you going to make it yes how you going to make it cuz he's deposited his life in here I'm going to read through several scriptures I found it very fruitful to read some of the things that David wrote David as you know was a man on the Run he had done nothing wrong but he was being chased now if we could put it in perspective David was being chased by the United States Army and the president hated him the president of the United States had a Personal Agenda against him and he commissioned the elite of his forces and his armies to hunt him down and go after him so the Navy Seals are on your tail could you possibly feel insecure would you maybe struggle in your flesh and not only that but you've done nothing but serve the president and you've won victories for him and you've done all the right things and you never mistreated him you always were right and he and he loved you in the beginning and now he turned on you and he hates you and you've been betrayed and your name has been slandered and you're being hunted down do you think that you could possibly feel insecure you're hiding in a cave cave and the Navy Seals are coming there's an Apache helicopter flying around looking for you and mean they've got night vision scopes and all of these things and and what do you think you would feel oh well so we want to put in perspective where David was when he wrote some of these Psalms Psalm 56 what time I am afraid I will trust in thee and God I will praise His word in God I have put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto me I hope you never have an Apache helicopter hunting you down but if you do this is still the truth the Navy Seals are after you if the Green Berets have been commissioned to come and find you this is still the truth amen Psalms 5611 in God have I put my trust I will not be afraid of what man can do unto me you know what creates a lot of our insecurity worried about other people what will they say what will they do will they try to take something from me will they say something about me will they accept me or do they not accept me will they promote me or not promote me do they like me or not like me and we get all kinds of insecurity about other people but we're not supposed to be afraid of what other people can do or say or think we put our confidence in God Psalm 9 the Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble and they that know the name will put their trust in thee for thou Lord has not forsaken them that seek thee Psalms 125 they that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion I believe that which cannot be removed but abideth forever as the mountains are round about Jerusalem so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even forever so is he still round about his people like the mountains around Jerusalem absolutely but I can't see him neither could Gesa and that didn't matter one not whether he could see them or not they were there anyways I don't feel like I'm Jerusalem surrounded by the mountains of God I don't feel that way it doesn't matter what you feel the word says it and it's got to be the truth you are surrounded by the mountains of God Psalms 188 it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes what would that be the government magistrates leaders just trust God Proverbs 29:25 the fear of man bringeth a snare but whoo putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe Proverbs 14:26 and the fear of the Lord is strong confidence and his children shall have a place of Refuge Psalms 1271 except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain Psalms 121:2 My Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth well praise God who's your helper my helper is the one that made Heaven and Earth who do you have help you I've got the US government well I've got the one who made Heaven and Earth is my helper the Social Security Administration is my helper well my helper made the Heaven and the Earth who's your helper I'll take my helper over your helper amen amen in the latery in church days brother B says Matthew 4 where in Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptation of Satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded that corresponded exactly to the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word eve fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word so what was the fall when it really comes down to it Jesus overcame by the word eve fell by failing to use the word you know we're coming right back to the same spot in Eden said the bride will be tempted by this she'll come face to face with the same Temptation that he was faced with what's that Temptation going to be it'll have something to do with either taking the word or not taking the word sticking with the word or taking some other thing the word has to become everything to us our confidence our deliverance our security our promise it's got to be where we place our confidence Eve fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell in direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail we may feel like we're overcoming our trials but if we're overcoming our trials by our own mechanism and not by faith in the word it will fail the only way we can know that we're actually overcoming is by having confidence in the word of God and then we are overcoming but it doesn't feel like I'm overcoming but you're overcoming because you're putting your faith in the word amen I want to uh let's turn in our Bibles to Jonah chapter 2 let's read this together the Book of Jonah Jonah chapter 2 in verse one Jonah chapter 2 verse one when Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly now would you be nervous if you just got swallowed by a fish would you maybe have some anxiety and feel a little insecure this is where Jonah's at when Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and said I cried by reason of mine Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest my voice for thou Hast cast me into the deep in the midst of the Sea and the floods Compass me about all thy Billows and thy waves passed over me then I said I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look again toward the Holy Temple now look at Jonah Jonah is looking towards the temple because in the dispensations he's in Solomon had built a temple and in his dedication prayer he prayed God anybody anywhere in the world that's in trouble if they turn to look at this Temple cuz this is where you abide if they turn their attention to what to the word for the day where you abide if they turn their attention there then you'll hear from heaven and you'll deliver them and Jonah listen what what is Jonah doing he's not looking to a relic he's not looking Amen to a a building because he has no idea if he's north south east or west he has no idea where he's turning he's in a in the belly of a whale it's it's black he has no idea if he's up or down if the if the fish is swimming North or South how can he turn to the temple this isn't a physical turning but in his heart he's looking at the word for his day he's looking at where Christ abide and he's putting his confidence in the dwelling place of God because Solomon established this word and he believed this word and he believed what Solomon said and he stuck with the word for his day and God heard his prayer when he was in the the belly of a whale praise God hallelujah how do you think well how do you think God's not going to hear you no matter what circumstance what trial what's happening where do I turn turn to Christ who's Christ he's the Living Word that's living today this message that has been restored to us is a person that's come among us we don't look to buildings we're not trying to turn somewhere and pray in a direction we're looking to the one who has arrived in the fullness of his word his personal presence has come on the scene where to dwell within us amen he is here turn to that presence of God and say God I'm in trouble but I believe that your Prophet said that you're here to indwell your people and I'm looking to you Lord this is where Jonah's looking not with his physical eyes not turning in a physical Direction but in his heart he's looking to the word for his day and he says and I love how I want to go back and read this said verse three for thou Hast cast Me In The Deep yes I thought those was Men on those ship TI him up and three men Jonah recognizes who's in control of this whole thing Jonah has a much Superior Revelation he says Thou Hast cast me into the deep in the midst of the Seas and the floods Compass me about all thy Billows and thy waves passed over me you know what Jonah is doing Jonah is going to a higher Revelation in his prayer and he's just not wallering and crying what he's saying is Lord I know you had me sent here and I know I'm in the midst of your Billows and your waves you're in control of this whole thing that's what Jonah saying thy waves thy Billows and thy waves passed over me then I said I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look again toward the Holy Temple the waters compassed me about even to the soul the the depth closed me round about the weeds were wrapped around my head my goodness you want to talk about feelings and circumstances those are the worst I went down to the bottom BS of the mountains the Earth with her bars was about me forever yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption oh Lord my God when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee unto thine Holy Temple they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy what were the lying vanities the lying vanities was the whale's belly the weeds wrapped around his Heth and the the darkness The Depths the way they were all lying vanities what made them lying vanities because anything that's contrary to the promise of the word is a lie so the devil tells you you're in danger you tell the devil I can't be in danger I have a heavenly father who watches over me I have a shepherd and I'm in the palm of his hand what do you mean I'm in danger they that observe lying vanities forsake their own Mercy but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanks giving what's he going to sacrifice I'm going to declare Thanksgiving where in the midst of his trouble I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that thou have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land I contest to you I have never been in a circumstance that bad I felt like I've been in bad circumstance I have never been in a circumstance that bad but if I ever find myself in a circumstance that bad may I do what Jonah did and said Lord I you cast me here I'm surrounded by what you've provided I'm here at your bidding I'm here at your leadership I I I I may have made mistakes I may have done wrong but you forsaw before the foundation of the world and I'm looking to the word that you've given to us and the the promises and I'm saying Lord come and Deliver Me Lord come and save me for thy glory Lord and thank you for keeping your word praise God thank you for keeping your word amen in the message Harvest time he says how different from Jesus he stayed with the word now the next few minutes I want to prove all these things true see by both nature and word bring this together this proves he was the word made flesh for bread he was the word made flesh for he reflected what the word only when he come into his temptation he used what only the word what did he reflect the word amen what's his bride to do she's to become the word and to reflect the word so what should she use in all of her troubles the word where should her confidence be in the word what what should she be declaring and praying or speaking the word this is what we're being trained for and Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother bam says he Pro proves his resurrection life then as he vindicates himself she the bride is independent from all others I love that that's where we need to be independent that we we don't need someone else's support to serve God he's all I need I do I want other support yes I want it did God provide it yes he's provided it but I don't want to get to where I need it if I need it he'll provide it if he doesn't provide it I don't need it that's right so we got to get our minds adjusted to the Perfection of God Amen and to God's sovereignty and say God I would love to have a friend but if you don't provide a friend you're all I need God I ask you for more Fellowship but if you see fit not to give it then you're all I need that we can ask for what we want ask for what we need but he knows what we need sometimes we need to be in Fellowship sometimes we need to be alone yes sometimes we need everybody who loves us not to call us for a week and leave us wondering why nobody likes us anymore and start feeling lonely and start feeling rejected and start feeling Outcast cuz sometimes that's where we need to be to we start thinking so God can start speaking to our hearts but when we get in that place we get desperate we start calling and reaching out and and really what God's trying to do and you call somebody they don't have time for you you call somebody else they don't answer the phone you call somebody else they just left on vacation and you wonder what's happening to me I'm being abandoned you're not being abandoned God wants to talk to you God wants you to know you don't need a friend all you need is me if I see that you need a friend I'll give you a friend when you need a friend but what you need more than anything is me you need a relationship with me you need time with me you need confidence in me I am all that you need and I'm the provider of everything you need and when you need Fellowship I'll give you Fellowship when you need a friend I'll give you a friend amen when you need Deliverance I'll give you Deliverance put your trust in me she is independent from all others she's an independent woman praise God I remember when I first read that and I'm like is she allowed to be like that she's not independent from Christ she's dependent on Christ but her dependency on Christ makes her independent from dependency anywhere else she's an independent woman a Great Speckled word that's different from all others you remember the Bible on that The Great Speckled Bird she had his name she had his life how did they speckle the bird they were both white and they pulled the head off of one bird and drained the blood out on the other bird and the other bird was speckled with the red blood and it flopped its wings like this and the blood cried holy holy holy as it bade the ground so Christ the dead mate put his blood his blood from his life into his carrying his blood crying holy holy holy unto the Lord it's an oddl looking bird sure it is but she the bride is identified by him and she is independent from all others he says that again she's independent from all others keep thee only under her as long as thou as you both live keep thee only to him the word no adultery not one sign of denomination no one sign of creed no adultery at all the word and him alone on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking Sands then he says that's it Christ the word he was the word he is the word and the church becomes the word by him making her a part of him and that's the word again personally identified by him his property alone I love that nobody else has rights his property alone amen and so when when the devil tries to push you around or cause sickness to come on you or or cause you to have a want and need all you have to say is I am his property alone I don't have to worry about it I belong to him I've been bought with the blood of Jesus Jesus Christ I belong to Christ I am his property alone amen and he knows how to take care of his property his property alone she is Redeemed by him catch this she is Redeemed by him through him for him and for him alone that's right then what the devil is howling about that it's being revealed what does God what does the devil not want you to get this revelation of your security cuz he wants to use insecurity to move you and motivate you into leaving the word he does not want you to come to this security where you're independent from all others and his property alone and you've been redeemed by him alone not by your works but by his deeds you've been accepted in the Beloved by him that you were chosen in him that he paid for the price himself and that you're the recipient of all that and you're secure in him that's the Revelation he doesn't want you to get because he wants you to still have a need and still feel insecure so that he can manipulate your insecurity to move you away from the word but that's not why the message came in this day the message came to give us a real security a genuine Faith by Revelation in Christ so that you can become an independent woman independent from all others and you can be his property and his property alone he further down a couple paragraphs further down he says identified oh the devil is howling about this the manifested truth of the promise of this word in her alone they don't have the answer when Jesus come why didn't those Pharisees he said if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God who do you cast them out by see he stood alone and his church stands alone she is not hooked with nothing catch all this terminology she stands alone she's not hooked with nothing why cuz if you're hooked to something you can be pulled around by that if you're attached or tied to something you can be moved and manipulated by whatever you're attached or titied to and his church stands alone she's not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil is howling these great organizations to set up something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up she is now risen and by the power of the Vindicated word promised to her why are we not afraid cuz I'm seated right now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I've been lifted up by the message of the hour and I have been there's a part of me that has been lifted above all of this trouble and secure in him already in the message Harvest time he says I trust now that the Lord will bless his word I'm a firm believer in the word and the word only just the word only and that's the message that the Lord has given me so what is the message the lord gave him the word only what do we need Christ and him alone as we close I just want to read two scriptures together let's go to Psalms chapter 3 31 and read these two places in Psalms and then we'll finish Psalms chapter 31 Psalms 31 this is another Psalm of David Psalms 31:19 oh how great is thy goodness which thou has laid up for them that fear thee which thou has wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from The Strife of tongues blessed be the Lord for he has showed me his marvelous kindness in a strong City for I said in my haste I cut off from before Thine Eyes nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I CED Cried unto thee oh love the Lord all ye his Saints for the Lord preserveth the faithful and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all ye that hope in the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart sometimes our hearts are failing for fear but be of Courage Focus your eyes back on what's been given to us and let him strengthen our heart let's go to Psalm 27 and finish with this portion of scripture this is the psalm brother Brenham goes to when he preaches the Rapture message I think that's significant and I think that's powerful that when he goes to preach the Rapture this is the message that he comes through this is the portion of scripture so let's think about this in light of the end time the finality the time just before we exit this Dimension says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid where did brother Brandon read this at the beginning of the Rapture message maybe at the time of the rapture we need this kind of Revelation maybe we need to talk like this and act like this and believe like this the Lord is my light in my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple have you got one request that's above all requests make that your greatest request that's what David said that was the one thing he wanted above everything else is to dwell in the temple of the Lord and inquire in his Temple verse five for in the time of trouble yes Rapture message for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle when the Green Berets are coming after me David knew what it was to be chased to be frightened to have his life in jeopardy to not know what tomorrow holds he's the one who understands this can we understand it when economic woses come when crisises pop up like when confusion comes around us for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord hear oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou sayest seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou has been my help Le me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of mine enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living DAV said I would have fainted unless I believed that God would come on the scene I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on on the Lord who's our deliverer he's our deliverer when Paul and Silas were arrested were beaten were captives of the government were thrown into the prison and had their feet in stalks they did what David did I will sing praises unto their name they began to sing praises unto the Lord and Thanksgiving and worship they weren't boning they weren't groaning they were worshiping the Lord and one of the worst situations you can find yourself in what did God do he came and rattled that jail to Pieces he may not rattle your jail to Pieces but he'll give you Grace to go through and he might just rattle it down he might just perform the Supernatural and and and move mountains he might just move governments he might change policies he might bring provision from nowhere he might have something show up on your doorstep he might but is it any less a miracle that he plants his grace in your heart is that less of a miracle than somebody leaving a sack of groceries on your door when you need it or your car starting when you lay hands on it I don't think it's any less of a miracle when he gives his grace into your heart to give you the strength to go through what other human beings can't go through with joy and gladness and Thanksgiving Lord I think that's just as miraculous and just as Supernatural is all the other and that we can be thankful for when we go through dark days and tough times but yet there's a joy in our heart yet there's a song on our lips and yet we have confidence in him that didn't come from your brain that didn't come from your emotions that came from the father above and when you have that joy in your heart and a song and a realization that he will deliver you and a confidence in him then you realize I'm in the palm of his hand and you can sing his Praises you can call those things that are not as though they are because you know he will deliver am man let's all stand and musicians will come where is our security in Jesus Christ Alone just in him when I'm wrapped and weeds around my head and the Darkness and the under the Billows and under the waves and an impossible situation then why not just cry out to the Lord and say Lord lord I can't rescue myself and there's not another human being who knows what should be done in this situation the doctors don't know my friends don't know nobody else knows but I know before the foundation of the world you already knew and you know just what I need and you can supply my every need to go through this trial and you can move all the obstacles away so I'm turning my eyes to you and I'm looking to you and I'm trusting in you and I'm offering my sacrifice of Thanksgiving to you who is my deliverer my sustainer My Redeemer my healer and the strength that carries me through and I can praise you for all of that amen the devil would love for us to be insecure but this message came to bring us a security it came to make us stable it came to put us on a rock it came to make us an independent woman separated from all others his and his alone that's why this message came and I believe all the things we're going through is bringing us closer and closer to that position he knows what he's doing friends he knows exactly what he's doing and I just want to surrender to his will let's bow our heads together to pray dear heavenly father we thank you Jesus for this day you've given us for the word Lord it means more to us than anything God when we see the we see the Troublesome times that we're in and men's

grace God there's more work to do there's more to manifest there's more things that you want to display through your bride we need your healing we need our confidence to be centered on you help us Lord we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen my father knows what I need my father knows what I need in everything I go through he knows what's best for [Music] me my father knows what I need he's got it all in control in control he's got it all in control he put that reassurance way down in my soul he's got it all in control I put my life I put my life in his hand in his hand my life In His Hands every road I walk down I know is in his place I put my life in his amen I was thinking about something brother Brenham said in his testimony one time he was talking about the death of his wife and his daughter and how hard that was for him and he didn't understand and didn't comprehend but he made this statement years later he said I didn't know then I didn't understand then he said but I understand now he' come to terms with something and he didn't he didn't go on to explain it completely but brother brandham at the end of his life he understood that that was all necessary in the plan of God for his molding for his shaping and his molding and shaping was my benefit was your benefit his training to stay with the word his training to to to not deviate off that word and not let anybody else influence him that training that he went through was for you and I brother B comes to the end and he and he's not bitter about losing his wife he's not bitter about losing his daughter and when he tells the story he still weeps of course he was hurt but he's no longer hurt and bitterness and anger and frustration towards God he's come to terms that that the fact that God did what was best and he didn't understand then but I understand now there's a lot lot of things in life that we don't understand why my parents abandoned me why somebody allowed this abuse in my life why know somebody didn't stop this from happening why God allowed it to go on when God can stop anything there's so many those things we deal with in life and those questions roll around and around in our heart but can we look to the predestinated plan of God and recognize that God has a purpose in at all that I don't understand why but it had to be that way for something in his Kingdom to work out my brother tell you don't know the pain you don't know I don't know your pain the only pain I can identify with is my own but I met a savior who can heal pain he allows things not because he's sadistic and not because he's lost control he allows things because there's something that has to be manifest and there's something we have to know and understand there's a lot of things I didn't understand then but I understand now I understand them now I can say what brother bandam said I may not have a full picture but there's things about my childhood I didn't understand but I understand them now when I was a little boy my parents divorced when I was 5 years old we were drugged from Pillar To Post I went to maybe 11 or 12 different schools before Junior High School uh my mom she was a manager for apartment complexes to make money we moved from one apartment to the other and we like I said drug from Pillar To Post we've had Blended families and mixed families and remarriages and step siblings and Dad remarried and we had it was chaos friends I didn't understand then but when I sit down in my office to talk to somebody who's had pain in their family divorce and rejection and abuse I now feel what they feel and I understand what they understand and I can give him hope and tell him there's a God that can overcome all of those things there's a healing amen I didn't understand then but I understand now why I had to lose my dad when I was an 18yearold boy I didn't understand then but I understand now God was separating me to himself and I'm not bitter about it I'm not angry I wasn't always that way I was hurt and I was angry and I was upset and and I was a rebellious as teenager and I was angry about and I didn't even know what I was angry about I was just mad but this message has done something to me friends it has put me back in his hand this message has made to me in my perspective it is made God God and the the one who controls all things and made him perfect in everything made him perfect in every part of my life this message to me the revelation of this word has put God back in the proper place in my understanding amen and has brought peace back to my heart and love and Thanksgiving and now I'm thankful for everything in my life because if it all had to come together to make the recipe that brings me to where I am now I can say thank you Lord Jesus for all of it cuz I'm so at peace in my heart with God and I know that he's in control friends I didn't say that just so you know my life and feel sorry I said that because you've been through things you've been wounded you've been hurt you've been scarred things that shouldn't have happened we from our perspective never should have happened there but listen let God be God let him be bigger than every problem and let him be greater than every person that wounded you and let him be a God who has everything in control and knows exactly what you and I need and exactly what he's doing and let him be the God who brings healing to your heart and has Grace that's sufficient for everything sometimes we think I can never get over that I can never get over this absolutely you can get over it don't ever say that because he's the one that Health all of our diseases he's the one who came to bind up the Brokenhearted and set free those that are captive and bound he absolutely can help you get over it don't you dare say I'll never get over that or I can't get over this I can't get beyond that that's not the truth that's lying vanities he's your security you're secure in him don't let the devil use old hurts and old circumstances to keep whipping you around and don't be hooked to the past let god come and cut it all off and bring a liberty that comes from having a healed heart you know what bitterness does it attaches you to people and attaches you to circumstances and you can never get over it you can never get free you want to be free and you hate what that person did and you hate that they that what what they stood for and you hate what happened but as long as there's bitterness and unforgiveness in your heart you're still tied to it and you will drag it with you everywhere you go the only Liberty that you can have is from forgiveness that comes from God forgiveness from the heart healing and let him take the bitterness out and then you'll be free you won't be dragging that person that relationship that circumstance it won't be following you everywhere you go when you cut the ties of bitterness and unforgiveness how can I do it you can't do it in yourself you can only do it by a revelation that all things work together for the good to them that love God and are the called according to his purpose it's only the word that gives us this kind of Peace it's only the word that brings this kind of healing let his Spirit come and administer his word in your heart let the spirit of God flow over you don't say I can't get over don't say I can't forgive don't say I'll never be don't say those things just open your heart and say God heal all the broken places in my heart all the wounds and all the hurt we've lost loved ones we've lost spouses some have lost children those are deep wounds brother brandham had them but he knows what it's like to be healed and allow God to use even the evil the Wicked the bad to use it for good I'm tired of the devil getting leverage off everything in my life I want God to get full benefit out of every circumstance in my life I want his kingdom to be glorified I want his name to be praised I want his word to be honored all everything in my life the good the bad the things I liked and didn't like I want it all to come together to sing his Praises for he's been good in it all he never left me he never forsake me he never abandoned me but it's his grace his Mercy his love that's brought me to this day and I'm thankful for it all and I find my security in him I hope you find the same that God bless you is just open your heart and let him heal you I found so many times people don't get over the past because they don't want to get over the [Music] past they're still angry they're still angry towards people they're still angry toward circumstances and they want to rehearse it and they want to throw darts because of the bitterness in our heart I'm just telling you stop it aren't you tired you tired of talking about what this person did to me this circumstance aren't you tired of talking about it wouldn't you love just to let it all work together for good and move forward by the grace of God and let light come out of Darkness let Love come out of hatred let peace come out of bitterness you know what you have to do you have to open your heart and say God I don't want to carry this anymore don't want to be bitter I don't want to be hateful I don't want to rehearse it anymore I don't want to talk about it I don't want to use it to get sympathy or attention I don't want any of it anymore I'm tired of it all I want it to go away and I want you to draw all the good and benefit out of that circumstance and put it on display in your kingdom can you do that now as we sing can you just open your heart and say God strengthen my heart by your love and grace and can you thank him can you thank him for the hard times cuz he proved himself faithful the devil tried to steer you away tried to ruin your life before you got started many times before we got started he tried to derail us but he couldn't stop God's plan in your life and he couldn't stop the seed from coming forth and he couldn't stop you from
