TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you put the works the labor the effort of cain against the labor and effort of abel cain's works far outweighed the works of abel his effort and the beauty and all that he put into his sacrifice far outweighed that of abel but in god's scale when he saw faith amen when he saw faith in the word for the hour god saw it this way amen and cain felt justified in his own actions and when god would not accept it instead of humbling himself and being judged he became angry with god and when god told him just to do like abel does he goes and he has a conversation with abel and after he has that conversation with abel he decided to kill abel and why did he kill abel because when there was a voice of god cable abel had the revelation he had the word he had the path back to god amen he knew what the atonement was he knew what needed to be judged he knew how to come to the judgment and when he had the revelation he was the voice of god to cain amen and cain could not endure that voice amen and he wanted to hide from the voice and the only way to hide from the voice was to stop the voice amen and to kill his brother because his own works were evil and that's why john says marvel not when the world hates you amen because you're testifying amen there's a path back to god and all these other paths are wrong amen they're a man's own doing man's own achievement man's own covering he is there's no atonement in it amen there's no covering but you have to come to the judgment to recognize what went wrong in the garden what's wrong with religion what was wrong with the church age is why we need a judgment today [Music] [Applause] and when you begin to become that voice of revelation amen now the voice is in you amen the voice of god is in the bride and it's the voice of god walking in the garden of his bride in the cool of the evening amen and it's testify your very life amen your very confession what by revelation you understand is testifying that the works of religion are evil what's evil feeding the poor feeding the poor is not evil going to church amen giving tithe supporting missionaries printing bibles i mean that's not even what's evil is rejecting the judgment and the true atonement amen and not coming through the judgment in this hour to have your father make an atonement for you then feeling self-justified by your own works and your own covering those works are evil
