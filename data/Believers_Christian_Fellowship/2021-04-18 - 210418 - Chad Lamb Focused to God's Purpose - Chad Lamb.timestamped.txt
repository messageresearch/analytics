[9:01] appreciate it lord
[9:02] appreciate being here with you this
[9:04] morning i mean if we take our bibles
[9:06] let's turn to john chapter 15.
[9:08] i'd just like to take the moment and
[9:11] welcome my mom sister debbie to service
[9:12] this morning
[9:13] we're happy to have her she's up to
[9:15] visit the family and visit you all and
[9:17] we're happy to have her and serve us
[9:19] along with our other visitors
[9:21] amen so let's look at john chapter 15
[9:24] and also i want to us to continue to
[9:27] remember the phase in family and
[9:30] it's a tough thing to lose somebody like
[9:32] that and
[9:33] god had blessed brother joe with a long
[9:35] life
[9:36] and he had been a blessing to many many
[9:38] people and i just thank god about three
[9:41] weeks ago maybe three or four weeks ago
[9:43] i had the opportunity angie and i
[9:44] to go and sit with brother joe for a
[9:47] while and visit with him we had a
[9:48] wonderful visit
[9:49] he was feeling good he was sharing his
[9:51] testimony with us
[9:53] but he told us then he was ready to go
[9:55] and i believe our brother was ready to
[9:57] go
[9:58] and we just we will mourn his loss and
[10:01] especially for the family we'll grieve
[10:03] for them as well
[10:04] but i wouldn't ask him to come back if
[10:06] he had to come back in that body
[10:08] but when he brother comes back it'll be
[10:10] in a different body
[10:12] and that's the reunion that we long to
[10:14] have
[10:15] that's the hope that we have that's the
[10:17] consolation we have
[10:18] and we know in this hour that we live
[10:20] it's not far
[10:21] away amen let's just read our bibles
[10:25] here in john
[10:26] chapter 15
[10:29] and verse 16. gospel of john chapter 15
[10:33] verse 16
[10:36] ye have not chosen me but i have chosen
[10:38] you
[10:39] and ordained you that you should go and
[10:41] bring forth fruit
[10:43] and that your fruit should remain that
[10:45] whatsoever you shall ask the father in
[10:47] my name
[10:48] he may give it to you just bow our heads
[10:51] and ask the lord's blessing
[10:53] lord jesus we thank you father for the
[10:55] privilege of standing here
[10:57] god we know lord that this is a
[10:59] wonderful privilege and opportunity
[11:01] you've given us in these last days
[11:03] that we can gather together like this
[11:05] lord to hear your word
[11:07] to gather with the licks of fire lord
[11:08] your attributes and sing your praises
[11:11] and god how we so worship you and love
[11:13] you and thank you
[11:14] for what you're doing in this day we
[11:17] thank you god for your word that you've
[11:18] opened to us in continually unveiling
[11:20] yourself before us
[11:22] we ask god that you would do the same
[11:24] today lord that you would
[11:25] take these lips of clay but that you
[11:27] would take control of this vessel
[11:29] and use them to speak your eternal words
[11:32] may you have preeminence among us lord
[11:34] and may you speak
[11:35] what you have ordained to say in this
[11:36] day that we might be equipped
[11:38] to live the life you've called us to in
[11:41] all things may you have preeminence
[11:42] among us
[11:43] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[11:46] you can have your seeds
[11:51] today i'd like to talk about focused to
[11:54] god's purpose
[11:55] focused to god's purpose and
[11:58] i got quite a few scriptures i want to
[12:00] read so keep your bibles handy
[12:02] quite a lot on my heart that i'd like to
[12:04] share but very very simple message
[12:06] there's nothing complicated about what's
[12:07] on my heart today
[12:08] but it is so very good and so pertinent
[12:10] to where we live
[12:12] and it's these things that we constantly
[12:14] need to be reminded of
[12:15] and we have to constantly be focusing
[12:17] ourselves to god's purpose
[12:19] because we live in an age it's so easy
[12:21] to be distracted amen
[12:23] distractions are everywhere the world
[12:25] moves at a
[12:26] rapid pace everything goes so fast amen
[12:29] it's overwhelming at times but there's
[12:32] one purpose that god has amen
[12:34] one purpose that he's had since the
[12:35] beginning amen and we want to stay
[12:37] aligned
[12:38] to that purpose and we stay aligned to
[12:39] that purpose then we will fulfill his
[12:42] purpose in our lives
[12:44] he says in the message the identified
[12:45] masterpiece of god
[12:47] he has a purpose in your life each
[12:49] individual
[12:50] that no one else on the face of the
[12:52] earth can take your place
[12:54] god has got something for you you're
[12:56] made like that you was did that way for
[12:58] a purpose
[12:59] god is sovereign in his work he even
[13:02] things
[13:03] different he we're different one from
[13:05] another
[13:06] and so i know so many times as human
[13:08] beings
[13:09] we always uh not always but many of us
[13:12] have a
[13:13] struggle with identity or a struggle
[13:15] with what am i actually doing for the
[13:17] lord i'm not really doing anything
[13:19] and that's because we get our eyes on
[13:21] the wrong thing we have a misconception
[13:23] of what it means to do the work of the
[13:24] lord
[13:26] we have an idea that to go in the
[13:28] mission field or to preach the gospel
[13:30] that's the only way you can do the work
[13:32] of god and i say that those things are
[13:34] the work of god absolutely all of those
[13:36] things to write a song to saying
[13:38] amen to lead a sunday school or a class
[13:42] or anything like that or the works of
[13:43] god
[13:44] but we limit those things to the we
[13:46] limit the works of god to those things
[13:48] that are visible and tangible
[13:50] and that we would traditionally labels
[13:52] the works of god and but we miss what
[13:54] god is doing in our everyday life
[13:57] god wants to work his work through each
[13:59] of us and he said and brother ben told
[14:01] us he has a purpose
[14:02] in your life so we can't pass this off
[14:05] anywhere else
[14:06] and i'd like to say this too so many
[14:08] times
[14:09] when when we were younger amen i would
[14:11] remember thinking yeah god has a purpose
[14:13] for me and some day
[14:14] some day someday there was always some
[14:17] day like i was going to get to this
[14:19] purpose that i was going to be used for
[14:20] something
[14:21] and that someday god would do something
[14:23] with me
[14:25] and in thinking like that i was missing
[14:27] what god was doing
[14:28] and what god was wanting to do and so
[14:31] it's
[14:32] god in us every day and god through us
[14:36] every day and we don't want to lose
[14:37] sight of that or else we can get
[14:40] caught up in things we ought not to be
[14:41] caught up in and we can find ourselves
[14:42] distracted with things we ought not to
[14:44] be distracted with
[14:46] brother brahms says in the message
[14:48] things that are to be this is just
[14:50] in december of 1965 one of the last few
[14:52] messages he preaches
[14:54] so now the only way that you can be a
[14:56] son a daughter of god
[14:58] because you have to be have to have
[15:00] eternal life
[15:01] and there's only one form of eternal
[15:03] life and that's god's life
[15:05] only one form of eternal life that was
[15:07] god and there
[15:08] to be a son of god you have to be in him
[15:12] always
[15:13] and the gene of your life spiritual life
[15:15] tonight was in god the father before
[15:18] there was even a molecule and you were
[15:20] nothing but the manifestation of the
[15:22] gene of life that was in
[15:23] god as a son of god now you're expressed
[15:27] after his word has come in you
[15:29] to light up this age now that's an
[15:32] individual now you as the individual
[15:34] where you're at today
[15:35] you are expressed after the word has
[15:37] come into you to light up this age
[15:41] and you are expressing god's life in you
[15:43] because you are a son or daughter of god
[15:45] therefore you get what i mean see you
[15:48] are
[15:48] you are now made you're sitting in this
[15:50] church tonight because your duty is to
[15:52] express god to this
[15:54] nation and this people in this
[15:56] neighborhood where you associate
[15:58] wherever you are god knew that you would
[16:00] be here because you have to be one of
[16:02] his genes or his attributes
[16:04] you had to be if you ever if you've got
[16:06] eternal life then
[16:08] it was always eternal life and god
[16:10] before there was a foundation the world
[16:12] knew that you would be here and so when
[16:15] we take this
[16:16] you know when when the prophet of god
[16:18] comes at the opening of the seals and
[16:20] he begins to reveal god's plan of
[16:22] redemption and and
[16:23] this great mystery of god in christ is
[16:26] the mystery of god revealed
[16:27] and then it begins to explain so many
[16:30] things about our life
[16:31] and when the mystery of god was revealed
[16:33] amen really
[16:34] for for us it's revealing the mystery of
[16:37] our life
[16:38] so the understanding of the mystery of
[16:40] god being revealed is
[16:42] breaking the seals off our life so that
[16:43] we can understand who we are
[16:45] and what god's purpose is for us and
[16:47] what his intention is with us
[16:49] so that we don't walk in in some old
[16:51] understanding or some wrong
[16:53] understanding
[16:54] amen and you know there's so many ideas
[16:57] that the denominations brought in
[16:59] that god was trying to take away from us
[17:02] we had ideas of
[17:04] you know i'm here and i'm just trying to
[17:06] make it and if i can just live a good
[17:08] life
[17:08] amen and if i could just uh do good and
[17:11] and be found acceptable to god then
[17:13] someday i can attain
[17:15] unto a good resurrection i can attain
[17:18] and to a good judgment and i can
[17:20] i can get in and that was a
[17:22] denominational way of thinking
[17:25] i remember i was raised in this kind of
[17:26] thinking that if i
[17:28] died and i had done wrong and backslid
[17:30] and i had died that i'd be lost and go
[17:32] to hell
[17:33] that's the raising that i was raised in
[17:35] very armenian
[17:36] that i was constantly you're constantly
[17:39] in jeopardy
[17:40] of dying and being lost but the message
[17:44] came and told you you've never been in
[17:45] jeopardy of being lost
[17:46] because your name was written in the
[17:48] last book of life before the foundation
[17:49] of the world
[17:50] you can no more be lost and god can be
[17:52] lost because you're an attribute a part
[17:54] of god
[17:54] down in your soul is something god has
[17:56] portioned for you to express
[17:58] in this day in this age and god has a
[18:00] purpose for you and he is not going to
[18:02] lose that purpose
[18:04] and if you're a son of god you were
[18:05] always the son of god
[18:07] and i said before you may have been a
[18:09] disobedient son you may have been a
[18:11] rebellious son
[18:12] you may have been a naughty son but you
[18:14] were still a son
[18:16] you may have been you know an
[18:18] unprofitable son but you were still a
[18:19] son
[18:21] so the message came to take away all
[18:24] these wrong
[18:25] ideas that i'm trying to attain and i'm
[18:28] hoping that someday i'll be found good
[18:31] enough and
[18:31] and he took that away so that we could
[18:33] have liberty in christ
[18:35] but not liberty to go and and just you
[18:38] know
[18:38] sit on a creek bank and drink lemonade
[18:41] and and know that everything all is well
[18:43] but
[18:43] liberty freed from the bondage of trying
[18:46] to make it
[18:46] in liberty to be what god had always
[18:49] called us to be
[18:50] liberty to be with just what he made me
[18:52] to be and liberty to express
[18:54] just what he called me to express
[18:58] and so now you're a attribute a
[19:02] gene of your father and you're nothing
[19:06] but the manifestation of the gene of
[19:08] life
[19:08] that was in god as a son of god
[19:12] now i don't think god
[19:15] is wasting any of his attributes
[19:18] if we can just catch this revelation
[19:21] that if
[19:22] if if we are a son or daughter of god
[19:24] there is an
[19:25] attribute a seed gene of god that was in
[19:27] us before the foundation of the world
[19:28] that was ordained and placed within us
[19:31] and that has come down now into
[19:33] expression and now to say
[19:35] well you know everybody else has a work
[19:37] to do but i have nothing to do
[19:39] i'm just here i'm nothing special and
[19:41] someday
[19:42] see we missed the whole point of what
[19:44] the prophet's trying to tell us
[19:45] that you yourself as an individual are
[19:47] expressing this great mystery of god
[19:54] let's turn to luke chapter 9.
[20:07] luke chapter 9 and verse 23
[20:17] and he said unto them all if any man
[20:21] will come after me
[20:23] let him deny himself and take up his
[20:25] cross daily
[20:26] and follow me i like that word daily
[20:31] this wasn't a one-time thing but he said
[20:34] if any man will come after me let him
[20:35] deny himself and take up his cross daily
[20:37] and follow me
[20:38] for whatsoever whosoever will save his
[20:40] life shall lose it
[20:41] but whosoever will lose his life for my
[20:43] sake the same shall save it
[20:46] this is a key principle and when i'm
[20:48] talking today on
[20:49] focus to god's purpose we have to
[20:50] constantly be taking up our cross and
[20:53] and the cross is used for sacrifice
[20:55] that's what the cross was used for
[20:57] amen to kill somebody and when you take
[20:59] up your cross that means it's your cross
[21:01] that
[21:02] means that's the cross that you die on
[21:04] and so daily we take up our cross
[21:06] and follow after him amen and
[21:09] the prophet of god says here in the
[21:11] message god's provided way
[21:13] and you're bound to be backsliding
[21:15] constantly so it takes a constant prayer
[21:17] to god
[21:18] paul said i die daily and if paul had to
[21:20] die daily how much more am i going i'm
[21:22] going to have to stay there
[21:24] dead all the time if paul had to die
[21:27] daily to stay right with god
[21:28] and so we'll all have to do that just
[21:31] die out to ourselves
[21:32] and that's getting god's way now there's
[21:35] only two ways of anything
[21:37] that's the right way and the wrong way
[21:39] and then ways are your ways and god's
[21:41] way
[21:42] and you can't be in your way in god's
[21:44] way at the same time
[21:45] you've got to forget your own way to get
[21:47] in god's way and you've got to get out
[21:49] of your own way to get in god's way
[21:51] for as long as you're in your own way
[21:53] you're out of his way
[21:55] so forsake your way forsake your
[21:57] thoughts forsake everything
[21:59] and just rely on just rely just rely
[22:02] one thing on thus saith the lord that's
[22:04] all then you
[22:05] know you're right so brother is trying
[22:08] to explain to us
[22:10] just forget about yourself amen just
[22:12] just die out to everything because you
[22:14] can't have it
[22:15] your way and god's way at the same time
[22:17] and you can't go according to your own
[22:18] thinking and god's thinking at the same
[22:20] time but we have to surrender our
[22:22] thinking in our way
[22:23] to god's thinking now i want to pick up
[22:26] a story here in john
[22:28] chapter 21 a story of
[22:32] peter after the resurrection the death
[22:34] and resurrection of jesus christ
[22:37] and he's going to come and show himself
[22:40] to his disciples again
[22:43] and he's going to begin to speak to
[22:47] peter
[22:48] and give peter a commission i want to
[22:51] follow this closely
[22:53] john 21 and verse 15
[22:58] so when they had dined jesus saith to
[22:59] simon peter simon son of jonas
[23:02] loveth thou me more than these and he
[23:05] saith him yea lord thou knowest that i
[23:07] love thee he saith in him feed my lambs
[23:11] he saith to him again the second time
[23:13] simon son of jonas loveth thou me
[23:15] he saith in him yea lord thou knowest
[23:17] that i love thee
[23:18] he saith unto him feed my sheep.
[23:21] he saith in him the third time simon son
[23:23] of jonas loveth thou me
[23:26] peter was greed because he said unto him
[23:28] the third time loveth thou me
[23:30] and he said unto him lord thou knowest
[23:32] all things now knowest that i love thee
[23:34] jesus saith in him feed my sheep
[23:38] amen in verse 18 verily verily i say
[23:41] unto thee when thou was young thou
[23:43] gerdest thyself and walkest wither thou
[23:45] wouldest
[23:46] but when thou shalt be old thou shalt
[23:48] stretch forth thy hand and another shall
[23:50] gird thee and carry thee
[23:52] whither thou wouldest not this spake
[23:54] signifying by what death he should
[23:56] glorify god
[23:58] and when he had spoken this he saith
[24:00] unto him
[24:01] follow me so now the peter
[24:05] gets a commission and the way he gets
[24:07] the commission is so unique because we
[24:09] know that he denied the lord
[24:10] three times but three times the lord
[24:12] asked him do you love me and
[24:14] peter had a chance to express three
[24:16] times lord you know i love you but he
[24:18] also gave him a commission he said feed
[24:19] my lambs feed my sheep
[24:21] feed my sheep because we know that peter
[24:24] was given the keys to the kingdom and he
[24:25] was to open the gospel to the three
[24:27] peoples of the world
[24:28] to the jews to the samaritans and to the
[24:30] gentiles and now
[24:32] he is receiving his commission and he's
[24:33] saying do you love me you denied me
[24:35] three times now
[24:36] he's expressing to god that he loves him
[24:38] three times but he's also given him his
[24:40] commission
[24:41] feeding my sheep three times feeding my
[24:44] sheep amen to the jew to the samaritan
[24:47] to the gentile peter was going to unlock
[24:49] the gospel
[24:51] then he tells him amen that that he is
[24:54] going to be surrendered and he's going
[24:55] to die he even gives him a prophecy of
[24:57] his death
[24:58] when i was young thou gerdest thyself
[24:59] and walk us whether thou wouldest but
[25:01] when thou shall be old
[25:02] thou shall stretch forth thy hands and
[25:04] another shall gird thee and carry thee
[25:06] whether thou wouldest not
[25:08] this spake he signifying by what death
[25:10] he should glorify god
[25:12] so god already had it mapped out he
[25:15] already had a commission for peter
[25:17] he already told peter to go feed the
[25:19] sheep he was given the keys to the
[25:21] kingdom
[25:22] and then he was even told what the end
[25:23] of his life would be
[25:25] and he and then when god spoke this he
[25:27] said follow
[25:28] me but i want to look at what peter says
[25:31] next
[25:33] verse 20. then peter turning about seeth
[25:37] the disciple whom jesus loved following
[25:39] which also leaned on his breast as
[25:41] supper and said lord which is he that
[25:43] betrayeth thee
[25:44] this is the apostle john he looks back
[25:47] and he sees john following in verse 20
[25:48] says he's peter seeth him saith
[25:51] peter see him say it to jesus lord what
[25:53] shall this man do
[25:55] jesus said unto him if i will that he
[25:57] tarry till i come what is that to thee
[26:00] follow thou me and then i'll just say
[26:03] this as a of a perfect example
[26:06] peter just got a commission from the
[26:08] lord and then he just was given an
[26:09] opportunity to be reconciled
[26:11] to the lord jesus he denied him three
[26:13] times he was reconciled to him
[26:14] he was given a commission he was even
[26:16] told of his end
[26:18] and he said follow me and peter
[26:20] immediately wants to know
[26:21] what about john and jesus tells him
[26:24] right quick
[26:25] don't you worry about john amen if i
[26:27] will that he abides till i come
[26:29] and you know next it says and then a
[26:30] rumor went out that he would stay till
[26:32] the lord's coming
[26:33] and brother branham cleared that up he
[26:35] said john was going to see him all the
[26:37] way over
[26:38] in revelation and be caught up and see
[26:40] him in his second coming in the
[26:41] millennial reign
[26:42] and all the way to new heavens and new
[26:44] earth and so he said
[26:46] it was true amen but not like they
[26:48] thought but he's telling peter
[26:50] he said what what is it to thee if he
[26:52] abides till i come
[26:53] follow thou me and it's a great lesson
[26:56] for us because god has given us a
[26:58] commission as his bride in this day
[27:00] and it doesn't matter what another
[27:02] family is doing what another person is
[27:03] doing
[27:04] what another church or another ministry
[27:06] or anything else is doing
[27:07] we're not to get our eyes on anybody
[27:10] else but follow him
[27:12] he is the open word in our day he is the
[27:14] word that's been restored he is the
[27:16] headship that has been
[27:17] brought back to unite with the bride and
[27:19] we are to follow him
[27:21] and the commission that he has for us
[27:23] peter's commission was not the same as
[27:24] john's commission
[27:25] was not the same as paul's commission
[27:27] but they each one had their own work to
[27:29] do for the lord
[27:30] and they could never do that if they
[27:32] were constantly worried about what
[27:33] somebody else was doing
[27:36] and god has so clearly given us a
[27:39] commission in this day
[27:40] amen and i'm talking to his bride the
[27:42] bride if you're a bride you have a
[27:44] commission in this day
[27:45] and under that commission there's all
[27:47] kinds of different things god can use
[27:49] you for
[27:49] but we're under one commission and that
[27:52] commission is to display
[27:53] jesus christ in bride form that is our
[27:57] commission that is
[27:58] what god has called us to that is why
[28:00] we're on this earth and that is our
[28:02] purpose
[28:02] and in doing that he's called some as
[28:04] mothers and some as fathers and some as
[28:06] teachers and some as apostles
[28:08] and some is evangelists and pastors and
[28:10] and some is
[28:11] helps and some is this and some is that
[28:13] amen
[28:14] all of that is got to be lined up with
[28:17] the one commission
[28:18] amen and that commission is the second
[28:21] fold of his threefold purpose
[28:23] to have preeminence and a bride and when
[28:26] we have that commission
[28:27] it's to each one of us as an individual
[28:31] god has given us the commission amen
[28:34] and under that commission we know that
[28:37] that we are to give him preeminence and
[28:39] all thing and it is to be his life
[28:41] living through us
[28:43] and now it doesn't matter what he does
[28:45] with my neighbor and he doesn't matter
[28:47] what he does with my brother and he
[28:48] doesn't matter what he does with the
[28:50] other church
[28:52] i hope we can understand that because
[28:54] that's all distractions in the
[28:56] peripheral
[28:58] and the devil is always trying to use
[29:01] these distractions and the peripheral
[29:03] to get us off of our main objective
[29:05] peter was never told to worry about john
[29:08] he was told
[29:08] he was commissioned to take those keys
[29:11] and feed the sheep
[29:12] to open the gospel to the three people
[29:14] forget about john
[29:15] john has nothing to do with what i just
[29:17] told you
[29:20] and you know we we get surrounded by
[29:23] individuals and we can become
[29:25] discouraged by
[29:26] things that we see we can be done become
[29:28] discouraged by
[29:29] things that a brother or sister will do
[29:31] or somebody else in the message that we
[29:33] know and love
[29:34] we can become discouraged by those
[29:36] things but i tell you that's just the
[29:38] tactic of the devil
[29:39] amen to have something in the peripheral
[29:41] of your vision to catch your attention
[29:43] and get you off the main thing
[29:47] and if you've heard your calling amen in
[29:49] this day and you've received your
[29:51] commission
[29:52] i tell you friends that commission is an
[29:55] all-consuming commission
[29:58] in order to fulfill that commission you
[29:59] will have to die daily
[30:02] you will have to you will have to
[30:04] wrestle this
[30:05] body into subjection
[30:08] day by day hour by hour moment by moment
[30:13] and so we have a good lesson here
[30:15] peter's commission and
[30:17] the difference in john's commission and
[30:19] and peter makes the mistake that we all
[30:21] make so much
[30:22] why do i have to do this and why does it
[30:26] seem like they can get away with that
[30:30] you ever thought that why is it
[30:33] god won't let me god won't let me
[30:37] but it seems like everybody else can
[30:40] still believe the message and god will
[30:42] still bless them
[30:45] i say what is that to thee follow him
[30:50] how can how can they allow this in their
[30:53] home and how can they allow this in
[30:54] their church and
[30:55] how can they do this and how can they do
[30:57] that i'm telling you friends if you
[30:59] start taking that bait and chasing that
[31:01] you're going to be missing the
[31:03] commission that god has called us with
[31:06] and called us too it's a distraction in
[31:08] the peripheral
[31:09] and i say let's focus to god's purpose
[31:12] amen
[31:12] god's purpose for me he did not call
[31:15] peter
[31:16] amen to make sure john was doing what
[31:18] john was supposed to do
[31:19] god was dealing with john
[31:22] you understand he didn't call peter to
[31:25] make sure paul was fulfilling his
[31:26] commission
[31:27] god was dealing with paul and god will
[31:29] deal with every one of his attributes
[31:31] amen it's not your job to make sure
[31:33] every one of them are doing what god's
[31:35] called him to do it's your job to make
[31:37] sure you're following him
[31:40] and he is the word that has been
[31:41] revealed in this day he
[31:43] is our headship he is our bridegroom he
[31:46] is the revealed word
[31:49] and so i say don't let the devil play
[31:52] games
[31:54] with us and don't get caught up in what
[31:57] somebody else is doing
[32:00] amen god you know god is god and he's so
[32:04] amazing
[32:05] and he does so many things he could take
[32:08] somebody who's very close to you
[32:10] amen and you believe the same and and
[32:13] they could do something
[32:14] different than you something you believe
[32:15] is wrong amen and not right according to
[32:18] the message and not what they ought to
[32:19] be doing
[32:20] and you may even express that to them
[32:22] but they have a different opinion they
[32:23] say i
[32:23] i believe it's okay because of this and
[32:25] this and they continue on and god pours
[32:27] blessings down upon them and you can
[32:29] become
[32:30] agitated or nervous or even maybe bitter
[32:33] or upset about that
[32:35] and i'm saying why what does it matter
[32:37] let god take care of them
[32:38] god could have done that just to see
[32:40] what you'll do about it
[32:43] i could have blessed them and healed
[32:45] them and given them testimonies
[32:47] amen coming out of their ears i mean
[32:49] like like they are
[32:50] almost the messiah on earth and you're
[32:52] so troubled about this thing that
[32:54] they're doing
[32:54] and he said forget about it you've got
[32:56] enough you've got enough to worry about
[32:58] to make sure you follow him
[33:01] and god may be doing those things and
[33:03] allowing that and you have no idea
[33:05] how many times have you done something
[33:07] that you thought was right and you were
[33:09] bold about doing it but later god
[33:11] revealed to you as wrong and you
[33:12] repented of it and changed your behavior
[33:15] i'd say that's every one of us and god
[33:18] might have been using you
[33:20] at that time to test your brother like
[33:21] he's using your brother to test you
[33:23] right now
[33:25] hey amen oh
[33:29] i love when the message where the rubber
[33:31] meets the road amen
[33:32] and it gets down inside and starts
[33:34] rooting out all of this stuff
[33:36] amen that trips us up that's just
[33:38] absolute nonsense
[33:41] we've got to get to the place amen where
[33:43] when brother branham creates
[33:45] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[33:47] amen in that message
[33:49] he says this is this revelation is to
[33:51] the
[33:52] individual how many times in that
[33:54] message does he say the individual
[33:56] one person one man not a denomination
[33:59] not a group
[34:00] one person one man to the individual
[34:03] i think he's trying to get us to the
[34:05] understanding that this
[34:06] this third pool ministry is to the
[34:08] individual
[34:10] it's not to the group it's not a public
[34:13] show amen under the third pool they were
[34:15] going into the little room one by one
[34:17] amen and in that little room they were
[34:19] being changed and they were coming out
[34:21] and they weren't even clearly able to
[34:23] explain what was happening
[34:25] in there amen but it was an individual
[34:27] one by one
[34:28] it was no longer a public show
[34:33] and god wants this individual affair
[34:35] with you amen
[34:36] he's not coming down to have this a
[34:39] church group
[34:40] church affair this group and that group
[34:42] he's coming for the
[34:43] individual amen and he's expressing
[34:45] himself through the
[34:46] individual
[34:49] and sometimes amen in that individual
[34:53] walk
[34:54] if we're not careful we we we start to
[34:57] take
[34:58] god's leadership for us and we have we
[35:00] start to apply it to everybody
[35:02] else
[35:06] and like peter was doing well you've
[35:08] told me this is what i'm doing
[35:10] and you told me that you know i'm going
[35:12] to be led against my will my arms will
[35:13] be outspread speaking what manner of
[35:15] death he'll die
[35:16] and he says well what about john it
[35:17] doesn't matter about john
[35:19] what if he remains till i come what if
[35:21] he never and you know that john never
[35:22] had to die a martyr's death
[35:26] all the other disciples died of martyr's
[35:28] death but john didn't die of martyr's
[35:30] death amen they tried to boil them with
[35:31] oil but it didn't work because god
[35:33] wasn't done with him yet
[35:34] all the rest of them died of martyr's
[35:36] death but john and now
[35:37] now after peter finds out he's going to
[35:39] be a martyr now he's looking at john
[35:42] and he knows the lord loves him
[35:47] he's got a special relationship with the
[35:48] lord
[35:50] through the book of john he's referred
[35:51] to as the one whom the lord loveth
[35:55] and so peter don't think peter wasn't
[35:58] human
[36:01] peter says well what about him he said
[36:04] what is it to thee
[36:06] if he remained till i come what if he
[36:09] doesn't have
[36:10] any suffering and he doesn't die a
[36:13] martyr's death
[36:14] and i preserve him just for blessings
[36:17] what is that to thee
[36:21] follow thou me
[36:25] let's go to second corinthians chapter
[36:38] 10.
[36:44] second corinthians 10 verse 12
[36:49] for we dare not make ourselves of the
[36:51] number or compare ourselves with some
[36:52] that commend themselves
[36:54] but they measuring themselves by
[36:56] themselves comparing themselves among
[36:58] themselves
[36:59] are not wise
[37:03] peter couldn't compare himself with john
[37:04] john compared with peter they all had
[37:06] something different to accomplish for
[37:08] the lord
[37:09] and god was not actually he wasn't even
[37:11] going to tell peter what was john's
[37:12] portion
[37:14] he told peter what was peter's portion
[37:17] and we're not here to compare ourselves
[37:19] among ourselves or
[37:21] measure ourselves by ourselves
[37:24] we've been given the leadership in this
[37:26] day and that leadership
[37:28] is is christ is the word and that is
[37:32] what we measure ourselves by
[37:33] and that is what we compare ourselves by
[37:36] not with each other
[37:38] because this is not group this is
[37:41] individual
[37:43] the group is over the this is the age of
[37:45] the individual amen
[37:47] the individual with the revelation the
[37:49] individual with the purpose the
[37:50] individual with the calling
[37:53] is to the individual and now we don't
[37:56] want to measure
[37:58] ourselves among ourselves or compare
[38:00] ourselves
[38:01] with one another but we want to always
[38:03] be following him
[38:04] measuring ourselves with the word
[38:08] because to measure ourselves amongst
[38:09] ourselves is not wise
[38:13] and the message influenced brother boom
[38:14] says now and we mustn't try to
[38:17] impersonate anyone
[38:18] just be what you are see and that's the
[38:20] way god made you you never
[38:22] fashioned yourself and remember as much
[38:24] as we ministers would like to take billy
[38:26] graham's place we cannot do it
[38:27] neither can billy graham take our place
[38:29] see each one has something to do
[38:32] the common little fella here that may be
[38:34] a janitor the little woman that may be a
[38:36] housewife the greatest minister on the
[38:38] face of the earth today could not take
[38:39] your place
[38:41] god had a purpose in making you what you
[38:43] are and you just serve god in that way
[38:45] that he made you
[38:48] and i think if we would just do that the
[38:50] wheels would roll
[38:52] a lot easier in the unveiling of god he
[38:55] says don't try to be a moses don't try
[38:57] to be an errand
[38:59] don't just be who you are but be a
[39:02] christian
[39:04] in the super sign he says now you all
[39:07] can't be that one but you can be
[39:08] part of that with your faith
[39:12] he's talking about the elijah ministry
[39:13] all can't be that one but you can be
[39:14] part of that with your faith
[39:16] all of them couldn't be a jesus when
[39:18] they was on earth but they could believe
[39:20] him and accept the message
[39:22] there was one moses one elijah one noah
[39:24] on down
[39:25] always been that but the rest of them
[39:27] could accept it and they would have
[39:29] had no ministry unless there had been
[39:31] somebody believe it
[39:32] jesus would have had no ministry unless
[39:34] somebody believed that paul would have
[39:35] had no ministry
[39:37] unless somebody believed him so brother
[39:39] says you can't all
[39:40] be that one there was one messenger in
[39:43] our age there was one seventh angel
[39:45] event
[39:45] there was one but you can be a part of
[39:48] that with your faith
[39:50] i cannot be that one but i'm part of it
[39:53] by my faith amen
[39:54] i'm part of that ministry i'm part of
[39:56] that calling i'm part of that prophecy
[39:58] i'm part of that work in this age
[40:01] because of my faith
[40:05] brother branham is is here uh he's got a
[40:09] he's preaching a funeral in 1963 at the
[40:11] end of 1963 in november
[40:13] this message is titled i'm the
[40:14] resurrection and the life and he's
[40:16] preaching the funeral of a young man
[40:18] named garnet peak and garnet peak died
[40:21] at 18 and you've been sickly for several
[40:23] years and
[40:24] and they had prayed for him quite a bit
[40:26] and uh he passed away
[40:27] at the age of 18. and i want you just to
[40:30] hear the way brother brenham describes
[40:31] him and describes his life
[40:33] so now this little cold frame laying
[40:35] here none of us can say but what he's
[40:37] part of this great economy of god's
[40:39] creation
[40:40] he is part of god's creation he's a man
[40:42] a human being that god created he lays
[40:45] sleeping now
[40:46] now the thing of it is if he served
[40:48] god's purpose in this life
[40:50] then there's got to be a resurrection
[40:52] for garnet
[40:53] this is a principle that brother brenham
[40:55] teaches that whatever served god's
[40:57] purpose in this life
[40:58] has a resurrection
[41:01] there's no way of getting around it this
[41:03] is not the end of garnet
[41:06] well we've all got to take this route
[41:08] through life we come in from the
[41:09] darkness and
[41:10] enter the same way and every one of us
[41:12] some way or other are going through the
[41:14] shadow of the valley of the shadow of
[41:15] death
[41:16] but the thing we're put here for there
[41:18] is like the world
[41:20] jesus said you cannot serve god and
[41:22] mammon mammon is the world
[41:24] can't serve god in the world at the same
[41:25] time we have our choice we can
[41:28] we can be dramatized by god by his holy
[41:31] spirit and we have eternal life
[41:33] if we don't when we die that's it we're
[41:36] ready for the judgment then
[41:37] why we didn't do it then the punishment
[41:39] it follows that for rejecting it
[41:41] but i am so happy as far as i know
[41:43] within the reach of my understanding
[41:45] by the word of god and by the witness of
[41:46] the holy spirit this boy met that
[41:49] condition
[41:50] he was born of the spirit of god a
[41:51] changed man the spirit of god was upon
[41:54] the little fellow
[41:55] he was a staunch christian he served
[41:57] god's purpose
[41:58] maybe it was for a short time now
[42:02] think about the passing of an 18 year
[42:03] old boy and what they would be like for
[42:05] his family and even himself and
[42:08] and and his parents but brother branham
[42:10] said he served god's purpose
[42:13] everything that has the life of god
[42:16] serves god's purpose and everything that
[42:17] serves god's purpose has resurrection
[42:19] life
[42:21] he served god's purpose maybe it was for
[42:23] a short time
[42:24] but god sometimes trains men for years
[42:27] to get a few days of service out of him
[42:30] john the baptist was 30 years by himself
[42:32] in the wilderness for six months of
[42:33] service
[42:34] jesus christ was 30 years old for three
[42:36] years of service for the crucifixion
[42:39] god trains men brings them up it's his
[42:41] purpose time is with man eternity is
[42:43] with god
[42:44] i believe that god brought this little
[42:45] boy here on earth for a purpose
[42:48] and if you notice right in the time of
[42:50] his sickness and things
[42:52] this struck him for a purpose even his
[42:54] sickness
[42:55] struck him for a purpose god could have
[42:58] made the boy sound and well
[43:01] you know not i imagine they even prayed
[43:03] for him to be sounding well
[43:06] do you believe that they prayed probably
[43:08] prayed probably fasted and prayed
[43:10] probably prayed sincere prayers
[43:12] heartfelt tear-filled prayers
[43:14] for the boy's healing even the boy was
[43:16] delivered many times of things but
[43:18] you find out that brother branham now is
[43:20] saying that this sickness was for god's
[43:22] purpose
[43:24] the sickness and things just struck him
[43:26] for a purpose god could have made the
[43:28] boy sound
[43:28] well but what did he do instead of
[43:30] taking his life he let him get up just
[43:33] where he wasn't going to die
[43:35] and neither did polio kill him he didn't
[43:37] die by polio no
[43:39] other disease killed him that we prayed
[43:41] over he and i and the rest of the
[43:42] christians here around campbellsville
[43:44] that prayed for him
[43:45] it never that never did it see it was
[43:47] garnet's time to go
[43:50] he must he had served his purpose
[43:55] now garnet never preached he never was a
[43:58] trustee
[43:59] or a deacon he never i taught sunday
[44:02] school he never
[44:03] sang as far as i know never sang a
[44:05] special he never went to the mission
[44:07] field
[44:07] but garnet at the age of 18 had already
[44:10] served god's purpose so god had already
[44:11] taken him
[44:13] i hope this changes our idea of what it
[44:15] means to serve god's purpose
[44:18] to do the work of god amen he had served
[44:21] his purpose he came to christ
[44:23] been dramatized what if he would have
[44:25] died before this time
[44:26] polio drove him to god
[44:29] he was to be a tobacco auctioneer what
[44:31] he had in his mind
[44:33] that wasn't his purpose at all we knew
[44:35] that his purpose was to be a christian
[44:38] now a tobacco auctioneer somebody say
[44:40] maybe 75 years from day if the world
[44:43] should stand that long garnet he was a
[44:45] great auctioneer
[44:46] maybe that's all the minister could have
[44:48] said at his funeral he was a great
[44:50] auctioneer
[44:51] but what can we say today he's a
[44:53] christian
[44:55] as an auctioneer without the germ of
[44:56] life just a memory of that generation
[44:58] he'd be gone
[45:00] among a few men now he's among the
[45:02] immortals
[45:03] he's got to come forth in the
[45:04] resurrection there's no way to keep him
[45:06] from it
[45:07] he has to come for he served his purpose
[45:10] he was germatized with the holy spirit
[45:12] of god
[45:12] of eternal life that laid within the boy
[45:14] and so much that if he said if i knowed
[45:16] the last time i spoke to him he said if
[45:18] i knew that i
[45:20] that i could be well strong like these
[45:22] other boys
[45:23] running up and down the roads here with
[45:24] my hot rod and running up and down the
[45:26] roads and drinking
[45:27] it would not know this that i know he
[45:29] said i wouldn't swap this for 10
[45:32] 000 lives like that
[45:36] a young 18 year old boy fine handsome
[45:39] looking young man
[45:40] would probably been a regular target for
[45:42] the devil
[45:43] but god had to throw him in that stage
[45:45] to get out of him to serve the purpose
[45:49] look at his patience his testimonies
[45:51] among you neighbors
[45:52] look what he was what how his little
[45:54] life was spoke to many of you that day
[45:57] that at the day of judgment without that
[46:00] his life will testify right back against
[46:02] you
[46:03] he was an example of what god wanted
[46:05] with him he
[46:06] served god's purpose
[46:12] in his condition weak and sickly and
[46:15] bedfast much of the time and homebound
[46:17] what was he doing
[46:18] he was serving god's purpose and
[46:22] you know even so much as an 18 year old
[46:24] boy said uh
[46:25] you know to have his conversion and have
[46:28] faith in god
[46:28] he said i wouldn't trade that if i would
[46:31] live and be healthy and live like those
[46:32] other boys not for christ i wouldn't
[46:34] trade
[46:35] what i have now for ten thousand lives
[46:37] like that
[46:39] and what was he doing he was displaying
[46:42] a character he was displaying a life
[46:45] amen in the midst of sickness
[46:47] amen a young life a man looked like it
[46:49] being held back or
[46:51] snuffed out or lost opportunities amen
[46:54] brother bam talked about he had ambition
[46:56] he had a dream
[46:57] he wanted to be a tobacco auctioneer and
[47:00] another place in the message he said he
[47:01] was a good auctioneer he must have
[47:03] already been starting
[47:04] amen and maybe he had abilities but he
[47:06] he was losing
[47:07] out on all his opportunities
[47:11] you know i've seen so many people lose
[47:13] out on an opportunity
[47:15] and become bitter over it
[47:18] lose out amen and all of a sudden
[47:21] whether it be a sickness or a lost
[47:22] opportunity or or missed something or
[47:25] and
[47:26] they become bitter and they feel like
[47:28] they missed something or
[47:29] or they didn't get something somebody
[47:31] else had or life
[47:32] somehow was unfair or mistreated them
[47:35] amen and don't
[47:36] think that we as believers are not
[47:38] subject to that same kind of thinking
[47:41] the devil will come in and somehow why
[47:43] do you have to suffer when others don't
[47:45] suffer like you and
[47:46] why can't you be like everybody else and
[47:48] why does god bless this but he withholds
[47:50] the blessing from you
[47:53] that's the situation garnet peak was in
[47:56] but yet brother man said look at his
[47:58] patience
[48:00] look at his testimonies among you
[48:02] neighbors look what he was
[48:03] how his little life was spoke to many of
[48:06] you
[48:07] he was an example of god what god wanted
[48:09] with him he served god's purpose
[48:12] i mean and sometimes to serve god's
[48:14] purpose it means that god will add
[48:16] affliction amen
[48:17] he will allow disappointment he will
[48:20] hold us back from our ambitions and hold
[48:22] us back from our dreams
[48:23] because he has a purpose for our lives
[48:26] and if we're going to fulfill that
[48:27] purpose then we're going to have to die
[48:29] daily
[48:32] because it's not you know you think well
[48:34] god would have got so much glory
[48:36] in garnett peak's deliverance and his
[48:38] healing amen i
[48:40] i would say it this way even through the
[48:41] ministry of brother branham
[48:43] god got tremendous amount of praise and
[48:46] glory through healings
[48:48] is that true god was glorified and
[48:52] god was displayed and his attribute of
[48:54] healer was displayed
[48:56] thousands times thousands of times
[48:58] through the ministry of brother branham
[48:59] but here's a here's a little boy that
[49:01] god was not going to allow to come to a
[49:04] complete wholeness amen
[49:05] he was going to take him what we would
[49:07] say before his time
[49:08] but it was never before god's time
[49:12] it was never too early it was never
[49:14] unjust it was never
[49:16] unfair
[49:21] it was perfect
[49:25] and he wasn't bitter or angry
[49:29] he didn't feel like there was an
[49:31] unjustice
[49:32] he didn't feel like it's not right that
[49:35] i should have to go through this and
[49:37] nobody else has to go through what i go
[49:39] it's not right that god would put this
[49:41] burden on me
[49:42] and not on somebody else he didn't have
[49:43] that attitude and without that
[49:45] attitude he could serve god's purpose
[49:48] remember brother branham was in
[49:50] shreveport louisiana one time and
[49:52] he was preaching there in shreveport he
[49:54] was talking about a little sister
[49:56] sitting there in the wheelchair he said
[49:58] every time we come in she's so pleasant
[50:00] and nice and smiling
[50:01] and many times we've wondered why god
[50:03] doesn't heal her
[50:05] i'm just paraphrasing many times we've
[50:07] wondered why god doesn't heal her
[50:08] we've seen him do more than that is that
[50:11] true
[50:13] we've prayed for brother ben and prayed
[50:15] for and wondered himself
[50:17] why god doesn't heal her because he's
[50:19] more than able
[50:20] in this ministry god's done way more
[50:22] than that but he looked down under he
[50:23] said
[50:24] maybe god let her stay that way
[50:27] so she could bless me prophet of god was
[50:31] encouraged when he would see that little
[50:32] lady
[50:33] stuck in that wheelchair but she always
[50:35] had a smile she was always happy
[50:37] amen she was always in spite of her
[50:40] condition
[50:40] she was cheerful she was smiling and
[50:43] brother ben said
[50:44] maybe he let her stay that way
[50:47] because she could bless me now if that
[50:51] little sister could know
[50:53] amen that that her condition was not
[50:55] without a purpose amen
[50:57] but that god had allowed her to stay
[50:59] that way
[51:00] just to bless his prophet in the end
[51:02] time
[51:03] i'd say if we had the right scope of the
[51:06] grand scope of god's program and
[51:08] what that prophet was to do and and what
[51:10] his troubles were
[51:11] and his difficulties and how he could
[51:13] take cheer and
[51:15] a sister in a wheelchair who god
[51:17] seemingly won't answer their prayer
[51:18] and won't raise her up even though he
[51:20] easily could
[51:23] and she could equate her suffering in
[51:25] that wheelchair
[51:26] with a blessing to god's profit and
[51:28] encouragement to his heart
[51:29] she would probably say i'm fine here in
[51:31] the wheelchair
[51:34] if we only knew amen if we could only i
[51:37] wouldn't say no because we know
[51:38] but if we could only believe if we could
[51:41] only keep it in our mind
[51:43] that everything we go through that the
[51:45] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[51:46] to the lord amen
[51:47] that god has ordained things for our
[51:50] lives and what he wants out of us
[51:52] is he wants to accomplish his purpose he
[51:54] wants us how can i prove my love to him
[51:56] by conducting myself with joy amidst the
[51:58] trials that he sees
[51:59] fit to allow to come my way
[52:03] man i don't think it's pleasing to the
[52:05] lord and we were preaching on
[52:07] wednesday i don't think it's pleasing to
[52:08] the lord to begin to complain
[52:12] i don't think it's pleasing to the lord
[52:14] to begin to blame him for being unjust
[52:17] see that's the problem job got in job
[52:20] would not bring a railing accusation
[52:21] against the lord job would not fail
[52:23] amen and fail against the lord but where
[52:26] job was corrected by god
[52:28] is when job would start to say i've not
[52:30] done anything wrong
[52:31] and this isn't fair
[52:35] and when job got to say i'm innocent i
[52:37] haven't done anything wrong
[52:38] i don't know why god's doing this he was
[52:40] beginning to allude to the fact that god
[52:43] was somehow being unjust
[52:45] amen and god come down and corrected him
[52:47] and says who are you amen you're but
[52:49] dust and you deserve to die
[52:52] i'm the one who gives you life i'm the
[52:53] one who sustained says i'm the one who
[52:55] does all of these things
[52:56] who do you think you are and by the time
[52:58] job was done with that conversation job
[53:00] says
[53:01] i've spoke once and i'll never speak
[53:02] again i spoke twice and i'll put my hand
[53:04] over my mouth
[53:08] because god is perfect in all his ways
[53:12] if he allows something to come your way
[53:14] it's for a purpose and then you're for
[53:16] his purpose you're here for his purpose
[53:18] if you are a seed of god a son or
[53:20] daughter of god then your life has
[53:22] purpose and everything you're doing
[53:23] serves that purpose amen and we need to
[53:26] get comfortable saying
[53:27] god is in charge and i'm happy with the
[53:31] road that he has
[53:32] laid out for me does it have difficulty
[53:35] yes amen
[53:36] is it sometimes hard absolutely does it
[53:39] cause you to weep
[53:40] absolutely is her heartache there
[53:42] without a doubt amen
[53:44] but we've got to get to the place where
[53:46] we can say the lord giveth and the lord
[53:48] taketh away blessed be the name of the
[53:49] lord
[53:52] god who blesses
[53:55] never stops watching over me
[53:59] we need to come and keep in our mind the
[54:01] realization
[54:03] that i have a father who watches over me
[54:08] i'm not ever one day in my life been
[54:11] abandoned
[54:15] brother bram said of of abraham abraham
[54:17] was god's elect seed on the earth in
[54:19] that day
[54:20] and abraham amen god would come to
[54:22] abraham and tell abraham you're to go
[54:24] here and you're to go there and he began
[54:26] to move about in the land
[54:27] and brother brother ma'am says god was
[54:30] always watchful over abraham because
[54:32] abraham was his lexi
[54:33] he knew every turn he made he knew every
[54:35] place he was
[54:38] he knew when abimelech was going to take
[54:40] his wife he knew when he got in trouble
[54:42] down in egypt
[54:42] he knew every turn that abraham made and
[54:45] his eye was always on abraham because
[54:47] abraham was his son
[54:50] and you are the seed of abraham you're
[54:52] the faith seed of abraham you're
[54:54] children of abraham you're the royal
[54:56] seed amen
[54:56] how could he not have his eye on you
[54:58] amen and the problem is
[55:00] we for a fraction of a moment when
[55:02] stress comes and
[55:03] anxiety and all the difficulties come
[55:06] for we have a flashback of spiritual
[55:08] amnesia and we forget we have a father
[55:11] and we begin to act like we have no
[55:13] heavenly father and that we're here to
[55:15] take care of ourselves and
[55:16] there is no purpose and we would never
[55:19] say those things but our actions in the
[55:21] heat of the moment
[55:21] begin to dictate that that we've lost
[55:23] sight of who we are
[55:25] spiritual amnesia's creep back in
[55:30] but god has peeled away the mysteries
[55:34] so there would be no question about who
[55:36] we are
[55:37] and no question about his watchfulness
[55:39] over us and no
[55:40] question about that he is watching
[55:43] over you and i
[55:46] and god
[55:50] if his even brother branham said it this
[55:52] way
[55:54] if god purposed for me to be a deceiver
[55:59] this is what brother bam says
[56:03] i would love him anyways because that
[56:06] was his purpose and he's worthy of my
[56:08] love
[56:10] and he said if at the end of my life he
[56:11] kicked me to hell i would kiss the foot
[56:14] that was kicking me
[56:17] that was his love for god
[56:20] because god is sovereign and god has a
[56:22] purpose
[56:24] and we want god's purpose just amazing
[56:27] that a prophet god would say that
[56:33] and why little bethlehem the man says
[56:36] even nature
[56:37] everywhere speaks of him and nature is a
[56:40] great testimony in another way
[56:42] that is that we cannot have this
[56:44] resurrection life
[56:45] unless it serves god's purpose
[56:48] brotherhood says this like i said over
[56:49] and over again
[56:50] what he's been teaching is what he's
[56:51] saying is everything that serves god's
[56:54] purpose has a resurrection
[56:56] but if it does not serve god's purpose
[56:58] it has no resurrection
[57:00] and he's speaking i know the first
[57:01] resurrection not the general
[57:03] resurrection unto the judgment but he's
[57:04] talking the first resurrection
[57:06] amen and he says if it does not serve
[57:08] god's purpose it does not have a
[57:09] resurrection but if it serves god's
[57:11] purpose
[57:12] it has a resurrection it has
[57:14] resurrection life
[57:16] already in it and i say god
[57:19] i want to serve your purpose amen
[57:21] because it's not this
[57:22] life it's the next life amen it's not
[57:25] this one that i'm gaining
[57:26] i'm going for it's the next one that i'm
[57:28] looking to amen
[57:30] despising the shame we've looked ahead
[57:32] to the glory that lay ahead
[57:35] we've got to be living for the next life
[57:37] amen and allowing god to fulfill his
[57:39] purpose in this
[57:40] life and if we fulfill his purpose then
[57:42] we have a resurrection
[57:43] now if a seed is planted and that seed
[57:45] is germatized it brings forth a new
[57:47] flower
[57:48] but if it isn't germatized it will not
[57:50] bring forth a new flower
[57:51] if it doesn't serve god's purpose yet
[57:54] not just because it's a flower arises
[57:56] because it serves god's purpose that's
[57:59] the reason the sun rises is because it
[58:01] serves god's purpose
[58:02] and we rise when we serve god's purpose
[58:08] i don't know about you but i want to
[58:09] serve god's purpose
[58:14] iran says in the message i know satan
[58:17] could not take them
[58:19] he could not drown noah in the flood
[58:22] until the purpose of god had been
[58:23] finished
[58:25] he could not burn up the hebrew children
[58:27] until the purpose of god had been
[58:28] finished
[58:29] he could not kill job with boils and
[58:31] troubles until the purpose of god had
[58:33] been finished
[58:34] neither could the lions eat daniel until
[58:36] god's purpose had been finished
[58:38] neither could death an old age take
[58:40] abraham until the purpose of god had
[58:42] been finished
[58:43] and neither can it take you or can it
[58:46] take me
[58:47] until the purpose of god of our life is
[58:49] finished so we gather from there
[58:51] consolation oh don't let the devil
[58:54] frighten you don't let the devil scare
[58:56] you
[58:56] with a bad prognosis or a doctor's
[58:58] report that's evil
[59:00] amen you're not leaving this earth
[59:03] until god's purpose is finished with you
[59:06] they couldn't
[59:06] burn up the three hebrew children amen
[59:08] they burn up they
[59:10] intensified the heat so intense that it
[59:12] burnt the guards who threw them in
[59:14] but it could not burn them because god's
[59:16] purpose for them was not finished
[59:18] and say all i want to do now is align
[59:20] myself with god's purpose because in his
[59:22] purpose
[59:23] i have perfect protection i have perfect
[59:25] leadership amen everything will work
[59:26] according to god's purpose and i
[59:28] cannot be destroyed and now my life
[59:30] cannot be ended as long as i'm serving
[59:32] his purpose
[59:36] and when i'm done serving his purpose
[59:39] why would we want to stay
[59:42] when brother branham was lifted beyond
[59:44] the curtain of time and he went there
[59:45] and
[59:46] explained to us what was there and the
[59:48] feeling it had
[59:49] and he didn't even have words enough
[59:50] language enough to explain it amen and
[59:53] he himself did not want to go back
[59:55] and you think about how wonderful a
[59:56] place this was that when his young wife
[59:58] hope at 21 22 years old
[1:00:01] amen laying there dying he called for
[1:00:02] her to come back and she says why did
[1:00:04] you call me back
[1:00:07] 22 years old with two babies
[1:00:11] it was such a wonderful place she had
[1:00:13] already served her purpose
[1:00:16] god would not have let the prophet's
[1:00:17] wife go hope would not have gone if she
[1:00:19] had not already served her purpose
[1:00:22] and after she served her purpose she had
[1:00:23] gone on to a place so wonderful
[1:00:25] amen she wasn't trying to get back amen
[1:00:28] when the prophet called her back said
[1:00:29] why
[1:00:30] did you call me back he said it's
[1:00:33] wonderful it's everything you've
[1:00:34] preached
[1:00:37] and the prophet of god years and years
[1:00:39] later he would go to that same place and
[1:00:41] even see her she would come and greet
[1:00:42] him and say my precious brother
[1:00:44] amen and he would not want to go back
[1:00:46] amen and he could see his body laying in
[1:00:48] a bed
[1:00:49] and next to him would be his wife that
[1:00:51] he dearly loved amen and he began to
[1:00:52] feel funny and when he looked back
[1:00:54] the body was stirring on the bed and he
[1:00:56] said do i have to go back
[1:01:02] see when god's purpose is done for us
[1:01:05] why do we want to stay
[1:01:08] and if god's purpose is not done for us
[1:01:10] we can't go
[1:01:13] so you can't lose this is all i have to
[1:01:16] say
[1:01:17] you can't lose let fear be gone friends
[1:01:20] let anxiety be gone amen let it all
[1:01:23] dissipate right now because if god still
[1:01:25] has a purpose in your life
[1:01:27] you can't die you can't go amen nothing
[1:01:30] can happen to you
[1:01:31] until god's purpose is done and when
[1:01:33] god's purpose is done
[1:01:34] you go down with resurrection power in
[1:01:36] your life and you've got
[1:01:38] a promise of a resurrection because you
[1:01:40] served his purpose
[1:01:41] and while you wait for that resurrection
[1:01:43] to be united you're united with those
[1:01:45] who have already went on
[1:01:46] and you're not missing anything
[1:01:53] amen i tell you
[1:01:57] god is good
[1:02:00] there's no reason to be afraid
[1:02:04] i mean we get afraid that happens to us
[1:02:09] we're still struggling in this this body
[1:02:11] paul says
[1:02:12] oh who can deliver me from this body of
[1:02:14] death but he said i thank god through
[1:02:15] christ jesus
[1:02:20] but there's no reason to be afraid
[1:02:24] fear has torment but perfect love what
[1:02:27] is perfect love
[1:02:28] it's the capstone it's grace
[1:02:32] it's the message that comes to us in
[1:02:33] this hour to tell us
[1:02:35] that everything is right on time
[1:02:38] nothing's out of kilter with god the
[1:02:40] clock's ticking right on time
[1:02:43] nothing can happen in the life of a
[1:02:45] believer unless it first crosses god's
[1:02:47] desk
[1:02:47] and he signs off on it gives his
[1:02:48] approval there's nothing
[1:02:50] going to harm us there's nothing going
[1:02:52] to defeat his purpose in his life
[1:02:54] we can't lose amen but the devil so
[1:02:57] tries to control us by fear
[1:03:00] tries to get us to turn here or turn
[1:03:02] there or
[1:03:03] speak things that are evil or speak
[1:03:05] things that are contrary to the word
[1:03:07] troubles us in our mind and troubles us
[1:03:10] in our families
[1:03:11] amen but we got to come back to this
[1:03:13] revealed word that's been opened for us
[1:03:15] in this day
[1:03:15] and realize everything is absolutely
[1:03:18] as it should be garnett peak was 18
[1:03:21] years old amen laying
[1:03:23] dying and god would deliver him from
[1:03:25] polio he didn't die of polio he didn't
[1:03:26] lie to the other disease but his lungs
[1:03:28] finally came
[1:03:29] and gave out and he couldn't breathe
[1:03:30] anymore and god
[1:03:33] used the polio to drive him to christ
[1:03:36] amen and there is christ
[1:03:37] he became a witness he became a
[1:03:39] testimony he became an example to his
[1:03:41] neighbors he became a light all around
[1:03:43] him
[1:03:43] that will stand at the day of judgment
[1:03:45] brother branham said
[1:03:49] he served god's purpose and he was sweet
[1:03:54] and humble genuine and loving
[1:03:57] while he served his purpose he was not
[1:04:01] irritated angry
[1:04:05] bitter he wasn't saying well i guess god
[1:04:09] wants me to suffer
[1:04:12] to display that's not it
[1:04:18] see it's not what we say i've watched
[1:04:21] people say
[1:04:22] well this is god wants me to bear this
[1:04:24] burden
[1:04:26] and i've watched the attitude and i've
[1:04:27] watched there's a bitterness that goes
[1:04:30] with it
[1:04:32] but when we really catch the revelation
[1:04:34] of god there's a sweet humility that
[1:04:36] comes with
[1:04:37] it when we bear our burden if
[1:04:40] there's some dark place that god wants
[1:04:43] us to shine a light in
[1:04:44] amen whether it be in a hospital bed or
[1:04:46] a bad family situation or
[1:04:48] or whatever it is if there's a dark
[1:04:50] place he wants us to shine the light
[1:04:52] you can't shine that light shrouded in
[1:04:54] bitterness and anger and fear and
[1:04:56] anxiety
[1:04:57] over your situation you can only shine
[1:04:59] that light when you allow the life of
[1:05:01] christ to come through
[1:05:02] and says everything is fine jesus was
[1:05:04] not bitter because they were going to
[1:05:06] hang him on a cross
[1:05:09] paul did not become bitter because they
[1:05:10] stoned him and they beat him
[1:05:14] we can say with our words that we're
[1:05:17] bearing a burden for the lord we say
[1:05:18] with their words one thing
[1:05:19] but our actions are totally different
[1:05:21] but it's got to be that life of christ
[1:05:23] on display that total surrender to the
[1:05:25] will of god
[1:05:26] and that desire amen to display him
[1:05:29] at all costs this blame and the best day
[1:05:32] display him on our worst day but always
[1:05:34] display him
[1:05:36] and realize nothing can happen to me
[1:05:40] unless god knows about it
[1:05:43] nothing can take me off this earth
[1:05:45] unless i've already served god's purpose
[1:05:48] let's go to first kings 19.
[1:05:52] i want to keep using these as examples
[1:05:53] as we progress through here
[1:05:56] first kings
[1:06:04] chapter 19. let's start at verse 1.
[1:06:12] we're going to talk about elijah after
[1:06:15] the mount carmel showdown after the
[1:06:18] great victory that
[1:06:19] god had showed him what to do he'd come
[1:06:21] in obedience to god he had done exactly
[1:06:23] what god said and god came down
[1:06:25] pillar of fire he licked up the
[1:06:27] sacrifice the stones the water and all
[1:06:29] and then they slew the 400 prophets of
[1:06:31] baal a great victory
[1:06:33] then we come to chapter 19 verse 1 and
[1:06:36] ahab told jezebel
[1:06:38] all that elijah had done and with all
[1:06:40] how he had slain all the prophets with
[1:06:42] the sword
[1:06:44] then jezebel sent a messenger unto
[1:06:45] elijah saying
[1:06:47] so let the gods do to me and more also
[1:06:49] if i make not thy life as the life of
[1:06:51] one of them
[1:06:52] by tomorrow about this time
[1:06:55] and when he saw that he arose and went
[1:06:57] for his life and came to beersheba which
[1:07:00] belonged to judah and left his servant
[1:07:01] there
[1:07:02] and he himself went a day's journey into
[1:07:04] the wilderness and came and sat down
[1:07:06] under a juniper tree and he
[1:07:08] and he requested for himself that he
[1:07:10] might die
[1:07:12] oh listen whose plan was he interested
[1:07:16] in now
[1:07:20] he requested for himself that he might
[1:07:23] die
[1:07:24] and said it is enough now oh lord take
[1:07:27] away my life for i am not better
[1:07:29] than my fathers and as he lay and slept
[1:07:32] under a juniper tree behold
[1:07:34] then an angel touched him and said unto
[1:07:36] him arise and eat
[1:07:38] brother branham tells us this story of
[1:07:41] elijah under the juniper tree and
[1:07:43] how he sends the angel with the softest
[1:07:45] hands because he knows the condition
[1:07:47] that elijah's in and he strokes him and
[1:07:49] awakes him and he feeds him and
[1:07:51] and then lays him to sleep and feeds him
[1:07:53] again and
[1:07:54] and would just read the story now and he
[1:07:56] as he lay and slept under a juniper tree
[1:07:59] behold then an angel touched him and
[1:08:00] said unto him
[1:08:01] arise and eat and he looked and behold
[1:08:03] there was a cake bacon on the coals and
[1:08:06] a cruce of water at his head and he did
[1:08:08] eat and drink and laid him down again
[1:08:10] the angel lord came again the second
[1:08:12] time and touched him and said arise and
[1:08:14] eat
[1:08:14] because thy journey is too great for
[1:08:16] thee and he arose and did eat and drink
[1:08:19] and went in the strength of that meat
[1:08:21] forty days and forty nights in dehoreb
[1:08:23] the mount of god and he came hither into
[1:08:26] a cave and lodged there and behold the
[1:08:28] word of the lord came to him
[1:08:29] and he said unto him what doest thou
[1:08:31] hear elijah
[1:08:32] and he said i have been very jealous for
[1:08:34] the lord god of host and for the
[1:08:35] children of israel
[1:08:37] have forsaken thy covenant thrown down
[1:08:39] thine altars and slain thy
[1:08:40] prophets with a sword and i even i only
[1:08:44] am left and they seek
[1:08:45] my life to take it away
[1:08:49] what was he doing he was complaining
[1:08:55] because god comes to him and he says
[1:08:58] what are you doing here
[1:09:00] he wants elijah to identify where he's
[1:09:03] at
[1:09:04] and i don't know that he's just trying
[1:09:06] to identify his physical location
[1:09:08] but i think he's trying to get him to
[1:09:09] identify where he's at
[1:09:12] because when he come to adam he come to
[1:09:14] adam after the fall and said adam adam
[1:09:16] where art thou
[1:09:17] it wasn't that god didn't know where he
[1:09:18] was and when god came to elijah
[1:09:21] amen he knew where elijah was and he
[1:09:23] knew where adam was but he says where
[1:09:25] are you
[1:09:25] and adam said i hid myself
[1:09:28] because i was afraid what was he doing
[1:09:30] he was trying to get adam to identify
[1:09:32] where adam was
[1:09:35] and now he gets elijah identify where he
[1:09:38] is
[1:09:38] and i say sometimes by the way we speak
[1:09:41] in the midst of a trial
[1:09:42] we're identifying where we are amen that
[1:09:45] we are stuck in spiritual amnesia that
[1:09:48] we have
[1:09:48] unbelief creeping in because of fear and
[1:09:50] anxiety amen when we hear
[1:09:52] ourselves begin to speak like elijah
[1:09:55] amen we need to say oh god forgive me
[1:09:57] this is not what you want for me
[1:10:00] it begins to identify where he's at
[1:10:04] verse 11 and he said go forth and stand
[1:10:07] upon the mount before the lord and
[1:10:08] behold the lord passed by
[1:10:10] and a great and strong wind rent the
[1:10:12] mountains and break in pieces the rocks
[1:10:14] before the lord but the lord was not
[1:10:16] in the wind and after the wind on
[1:10:18] earthquake but the lord was not in the
[1:10:19] earthquake and after the earthquake of
[1:10:21] fire
[1:10:21] but the lord was not in the fire and
[1:10:24] after the fire
[1:10:25] a still small voice and it was so when
[1:10:28] elijah heard it that he wrapped his face
[1:10:29] in his mantle and went out
[1:10:31] and stood in the entering into the cave
[1:10:33] and behold there came a voice unto him
[1:10:35] and it said
[1:10:35] what doest thou hear elijah he asked him
[1:10:38] the question
[1:10:39] again and he said i have been very
[1:10:42] jealous for the lord god of hosts
[1:10:44] because the children of israel are
[1:10:45] forsaken thy covenant thrown down that
[1:10:47] altar slain thy prophets with the sword
[1:10:49] and i even i only am left and they seek
[1:10:52] my life to take it away
[1:10:54] and the lord said unto him go return on
[1:10:56] thy way to the wilderness of damascus
[1:10:58] and when thou comest anoint hasael to be
[1:11:01] king over syria
[1:11:02] and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou
[1:11:04] anoint to be king over israel and elisha
[1:11:06] the son of
[1:11:07] shafat of abel mahola
[1:11:10] shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy
[1:11:12] room it shall come to pass that him that
[1:11:15] escapeth the sword of
[1:11:16] hazel shall jehu slay him that escapeth
[1:11:19] from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay
[1:11:23] so now we want to back up here in the
[1:11:24] story and we find out that he's gone
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:28] run away because jezebel threatened his
[1:11:31] life and
[1:11:32] after a great victory now he's running
[1:11:34] in a time of trial
[1:11:35] amen and we know that the anointing had
[1:11:37] left him and and he had crashed back
[1:11:39] down to earth as a man and he's running
[1:11:41] he's weary for his life and he says he
[1:11:44] asked god to let him die
[1:11:46] he never asked god to show me your will
[1:11:49] what do you want me to do next
[1:11:53] elijah start expressing his own will
[1:11:56] i want to die and i say friends we have
[1:11:59] no right
[1:12:01] to express our own will but
[1:12:04] let our will be his will
[1:12:08] and he said gave him food and drink and
[1:12:11] sustained him for the journey
[1:12:13] you know god had to feed him
[1:12:18] elijah was despairing of his life he was
[1:12:20] willing to lay there and die
[1:12:22] but god had to feed him because god's
[1:12:24] purpose for elijah wasn't done yet
[1:12:27] god came to elijah yes he loved him yes
[1:12:30] he was his prophet
[1:12:31] yes he was tender with him but he had to
[1:12:33] sustain his life in that wilderness you
[1:12:35] realize
[1:12:36] god wasn't going to get another one it
[1:12:37] was elijah that was called
[1:12:39] it was elijah that was commissioned
[1:12:42] so god had to take care of elijah that's
[1:12:44] why he had to take care of moses when
[1:12:46] moses was on the run
[1:12:47] that's why he didn't take care of all of
[1:12:48] them because they were still serving his
[1:12:50] purpose
[1:12:52] that's why he had to take care of paul
[1:12:54] when paul was beaten stoned and
[1:12:56] shipwrecked
[1:12:56] he still took care of him amen a night
[1:12:59] in the day he spent in the deep
[1:13:00] god was watching over paul amen he was
[1:13:03] not going to be
[1:13:04] eaten he was in the mediterranean sea
[1:13:06] there's great white sharks in the
[1:13:07] mediterranean sea
[1:13:08] none of them was going to eat paul
[1:13:13] because god's purpose wasn't finished in
[1:13:16] paul
[1:13:20] so now he says elijah what are you doing
[1:13:23] here
[1:13:23] and elijah begins to rant and complain
[1:13:26] this is
[1:13:27] brad and this is wrong nobody else and
[1:13:29] i'm the last one and they seek my life
[1:13:32] and god doesn't sympathize with him god
[1:13:35] doesn't answer him
[1:13:36] god doesn't speak back to any of his
[1:13:38] conditions
[1:13:40] he goes go stand in the upon the
[1:13:41] mountain and he goes we have this
[1:13:43] earthquake and a fire and a wind and all
[1:13:45] these things in a still small voice and
[1:13:47] he asked again
[1:13:48] he asked again elijah what are you doing
[1:13:50] here and elijah goes through the same
[1:13:53] rant the same complaining the same
[1:13:55] negative testimony
[1:13:59] and god never answers him one
[1:14:02] word he says all right
[1:14:06] go back you're not done yet
[1:14:10] god doesn't comfort him god doesn't
[1:14:12] console him god doesn't tell him it's
[1:14:14] all right
[1:14:15] god doesn't say i understand i know it's
[1:14:17] hard
[1:14:18] god just said what are you doing here he
[1:14:20] told him again what are you doing here
[1:14:22] and he says go by the way at damascus
[1:14:23] and anoint this one and anoint that one
[1:14:25] and anoint this one
[1:14:27] i'm not done with you then he comes down
[1:14:30] to verse 18
[1:14:31] it says yet have i left me seven
[1:14:33] thousand in israel
[1:14:34] all the knees which have not bowed unto
[1:14:36] baal and every mouth which hath not
[1:14:38] kissed him
[1:14:40] elijah was saying i'm the only one that
[1:14:42] remains
[1:14:44] brother bam said see he opened the seal
[1:14:46] there
[1:14:48] and let him see that he wasn't the only
[1:14:50] one there was others
[1:14:51] all his complaining was in vain and all
[1:14:53] his feeling was wrong so god opened up a
[1:14:55] seal to show him
[1:14:56] you're not the only one i have a plan i
[1:14:59] have people my redemption cycle's still
[1:15:01] going on
[1:15:02] you're not it you're not lost you're not
[1:15:04] going to be destroyed
[1:15:05] everything's still okay and god opens
[1:15:09] seals for us so that we can know
[1:15:11] everything's okay
[1:15:15] brother man says in the message of the
[1:15:16] seven church ages
[1:15:18] he said john his destiny was met like
[1:15:20] this he was caught and boiled in a vat
[1:15:23] of grease for 24 hours of hot boiling
[1:15:25] grease
[1:15:26] without any harm coming to him and they
[1:15:28] put him on the aisle and
[1:15:29] commonly believed as a witch he
[1:15:31] bewitched the grease so it wouldn't burn
[1:15:33] him
[1:15:33] they said course it was the power of god
[1:15:36] you can't boil the holy spirit
[1:15:38] out of a man why so they tried to boil
[1:15:41] it out of him but
[1:15:42] god wouldn't permit it and he had a work
[1:15:45] for him to do
[1:15:46] and until god was finished with this man
[1:15:48] there's nothing in the world can bother
[1:15:50] him
[1:15:50] that's all see they would go to boil
[1:15:54] the apostle john and they couldn't
[1:15:57] destroy him
[1:15:58] and then they tried multiple times to
[1:16:00] destroy his life and brother man was
[1:16:02] just talking about the boiling now
[1:16:03] they tried to boil him in a vat of
[1:16:05] grease of oil and they could not boil
[1:16:08] him
[1:16:08] amen why because god was not done with
[1:16:10] him because he said what
[1:16:12] if if he shall tarry till i return he
[1:16:15] had to see
[1:16:15] the return of the lord he had to see the
[1:16:18] second coming and the rapture
[1:16:20] and the kingdom set up in the millennium
[1:16:22] and the new heavens and new earth
[1:16:24] and until he had saw it until he had
[1:16:26] scribed it until he had finished god's
[1:16:28] purpose to
[1:16:29] describe the book of revelation amen
[1:16:31] they could not boil him they could not
[1:16:33] kill him they could not destroy him
[1:16:37] but when god was done with him he could
[1:16:39] die of natural causes
[1:16:43] peter when god when god was working
[1:16:46] through peter
[1:16:47] amen when he was taking the keys and
[1:16:49] opening the kingdom
[1:16:50] amen nothing could harm him they could
[1:16:52] imprison him and he would open the gates
[1:16:54] and he would walk right out
[1:16:56] amen the same one that an angel would
[1:16:58] open doors
[1:16:59] the inner chamber he was surrounded by
[1:17:01] guards
[1:17:02] open it up he could walk out from the
[1:17:04] inner chamber to the outer chamber all
[1:17:05] the way out into the gate on the street
[1:17:09] he had a great escape
[1:17:12] and after all that they could take the
[1:17:15] same man
[1:17:16] and they can nail him upside down to a
[1:17:18] cross
[1:17:20] because at one time god's purpose wasn't
[1:17:22] done for him but at the other time his
[1:17:24] purpose was finished
[1:17:26] and this was god's purpose too because
[1:17:29] god had already spoke it
[1:17:33] we get so confused sometimes
[1:17:36] because sometimes miraculous things will
[1:17:39] happen for us
[1:17:40] absolutely supernatural we get into a
[1:17:41] bind and the most supernatural thing
[1:17:43] will happen
[1:17:44] and we get into another bind and it
[1:17:45] seems like god won't do anything
[1:17:50] we get so confused by that
[1:17:53] let's turn to acts chapter 9.
[1:18:02] i'd say like paul said make your calling
[1:18:04] an election sure
[1:18:05] and i'd make your calling on election
[1:18:07] sure before the next trial
[1:18:11] before the next deliverance before the
[1:18:12] next healing before the next
[1:18:14] amen trial make your calling an election
[1:18:16] sure
[1:18:17] now so that when the next bit of trouble
[1:18:19] comes along you're not tossed about amen
[1:18:21] by every wave amen but you've got an
[1:18:23] anchor that holds within the veil
[1:18:25] and you know i am secure in christ and
[1:18:27] there's nothing wrong with me
[1:18:28] that god has called me from before the
[1:18:30] foundation of the world and all this
[1:18:32] is is something that will serve his
[1:18:34] purpose and glorify his name
[1:18:38] acts chapter 9 verse 15.
[1:18:43] this is god speaking to ananias who's
[1:18:46] going to go speak to
[1:18:46] saul he said but the lord said unto him
[1:18:49] go thy way for he is a chosen vessel
[1:18:51] unto me
[1:18:52] to bear my name before the gentiles and
[1:18:54] kings and the children of israel
[1:18:56] for i will show him how great things he
[1:18:58] must suffer
[1:18:59] for my name's sake so paul was a chosen
[1:19:02] vessel and he was chosen for a purpose
[1:19:05] to bear the lord's name before the
[1:19:06] gentiles and kings
[1:19:08] and the children of israel and until god
[1:19:11] was done
[1:19:12] serving that purpose they couldn't kill
[1:19:14] paul
[1:19:15] they tried but they couldn't kill paul
[1:19:18] let's go to acts chapter 14.
[1:19:25] here we pick up the apostle paul is in
[1:19:28] the
[1:19:28] in the city of lystra uh lystra
[1:19:31] leicester i don't know how to say it
[1:19:32] exactly but
[1:19:33] the the he prays every man and a man
[1:19:35] who's been crippled from his mother's
[1:19:36] womb is healed and
[1:19:37] then they try to worship him and
[1:19:39] barnabas as gods and he stops them from
[1:19:41] that
[1:19:41] and the very next verse in verse 19 it
[1:19:44] says
[1:19:45] and there came hither certain jews from
[1:19:47] antioch and iconium
[1:19:49] who persuaded the people and having
[1:19:50] stoned paul drew him out of the city
[1:19:53] supposing he had been dead the verse
[1:19:56] before
[1:19:57] the apostle paul had just stopped them
[1:19:59] from worshiping him as a god
[1:20:02] because he had laid hands on a man who
[1:20:04] was crippled from his mother's womb
[1:20:06] and he prayed for him and he instantly
[1:20:08] leaped up and began leaping
[1:20:09] amen and walking and they they saw that
[1:20:11] it was a great miracle and they looked
[1:20:13] at him and barnabas and say the gods
[1:20:14] have come down
[1:20:15] and they're going to slay and make
[1:20:16] sacrifice to them and immediately
[1:20:18] he just in verse 18 convinces them not
[1:20:21] to worship him
[1:20:24] and then in 19 some false jews can come
[1:20:27] from another city
[1:20:28] who are mad at him because of his
[1:20:29] doctrine and they can convince them to
[1:20:31] stone
[1:20:32] paul to death
[1:20:36] god who could raise a lame man
[1:20:39] would not stop them from stoning paul
[1:20:45] verse 19 again and there came hither
[1:20:47] certain jews from antioch and iconium
[1:20:49] who's persuaded the people and having
[1:20:51] stoned paul
[1:20:52] drew him out of the city supposing he'd
[1:20:53] been dead how be it as the disciples
[1:20:56] stood round about him he rose up and
[1:20:57] came into the city
[1:20:59] and listen and the next day he departed
[1:21:02] with barnabas to derby
[1:21:04] and when they had preached the gospel to
[1:21:06] that city you mean
[1:21:07] paul didn't stop preaching the gospel
[1:21:10] you mean paul
[1:21:11] didn't doubt his commission you mean
[1:21:13] when god didn't protect him from a
[1:21:15] stoning he didn't second guess whether
[1:21:17] he was really called to be an apostle or
[1:21:19] not
[1:21:20] you know paul was shipwrecked i think he
[1:21:22] said three times do you know that we
[1:21:24] never have a record of any of those
[1:21:26] times
[1:21:26] paul wondering why now why did god let
[1:21:29] the ship
[1:21:30] wreck now i know he called me maybe i'm
[1:21:34] out of his will
[1:21:36] maybe i'm not the apostle maybe i
[1:21:38] thought i was a light to the gentiles
[1:21:39] maybe i'm not a light to the gentiles
[1:21:41] because if it was the light to the
[1:21:42] gentiles and god was sending me here
[1:21:44] surely god would protect the ship and
[1:21:46] not let any harm come to the ship
[1:21:47] and now i've been shipwrecked and spent
[1:21:49] a night in the day in the deep and
[1:21:52] do you understand what i'm saying
[1:21:55] we got to make our calling and election
[1:21:57] sure that no matter what happens are
[1:21:58] calling an election sure
[1:22:00] that we know who we are and we know what
[1:22:02] we're here for and we know what we're on
[1:22:03] this planet to do
[1:22:04] and we're here to manifest jesus christ
[1:22:08] in every situation good bad all the
[1:22:11] in-between
[1:22:11] i'm here to manifest christ and just
[1:22:13] because he doesn't stop them from
[1:22:15] stoning me
[1:22:16] or he doesn't stop the car from crashing
[1:22:18] he doesn't stop the
[1:22:20] the whatever from breaking he doesn't
[1:22:22] stop amen the disease from
[1:22:24] afflicting because he doesn't stop it
[1:22:25] i'm not doubting whether or not i'm
[1:22:27] bride and i'm commissioned to live his
[1:22:29] life
[1:22:30] he called me amen he called me by his
[1:22:33] grace he established me in his word
[1:22:35] he quickened me by his spirit amen and
[1:22:37] nothing that's happening on the outside
[1:22:39] is
[1:22:39] changing his mind about who i am and
[1:22:42] neither is it changing my commission in
[1:22:44] this earth
[1:22:45] i'm here to display jesus christ amen
[1:22:47] through a stoning or a car wreck or a
[1:22:49] sickness
[1:22:50] or whatever it is i'm here to display
[1:22:52] jesus christ
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:22:55] paul amen they they stoned him and they
[1:22:58] drew him out of the city
[1:22:59] and left him for dead supposing that he
[1:23:01] was dead
[1:23:03] listen that wasn't a mild stoning
[1:23:09] that was severe he was stoned to death
[1:23:13] or so they thought they had killed him
[1:23:15] that was an effective stoning
[1:23:18] and god didn't stop it
[1:23:24] maybe god was going to be glorified
[1:23:25] through the stoning
[1:23:28] why would he stop what he purposed
[1:23:34] apostle paul when all the saints are
[1:23:36] standing around he rises up
[1:23:38] and i love the scriptures he didn't rise
[1:23:42] up
[1:23:42] there wasn't a pity party not in the
[1:23:45] scriptures i don't know what actually
[1:23:46] happened but
[1:23:48] the scripture doesn't give us a pity
[1:23:49] party or a bunch of remorse or regrets
[1:23:52] or
[1:23:53] paul saying ah i said that wrong i
[1:23:55] shouldn't have said it that way
[1:23:58] i think i offended them
[1:24:02] do you understand what i'm saying what
[1:24:05] did paul do
[1:24:06] paul got up because he was still under a
[1:24:08] commission from god
[1:24:09] he was still the apostle to the gentiles
[1:24:11] and he got up and he went to the next
[1:24:13] city and started preaching
[1:24:18] he didn't go back to check his
[1:24:20] commission to make sure he really was a
[1:24:21] light to the gentiles
[1:24:24] god had already established that he was
[1:24:26] moving on in his commission
[1:24:29] it says i'm going to keep reading here
[1:24:35] yeah verse 20 again how be it as the
[1:24:37] disciples stood around about him he
[1:24:38] arose up
[1:24:39] and came into the city and the next day
[1:24:43] he departed with barnabas to derby where
[1:24:46] did he go
[1:24:46] he kept moving on in his mission work
[1:24:49] now listen
[1:24:50] he's in lystra now so he moved to derby
[1:24:53] and when they had preached the gospel to
[1:24:55] that city and it taught many
[1:24:57] they returned again to lystra
[1:25:01] and to iconium into antioch
[1:25:05] where did the men came that stoned him
[1:25:07] that convinced them to stone him
[1:25:09] they came from iconium and they came
[1:25:11] from antioch
[1:25:12] and they came to lystra and had him
[1:25:14] stoned
[1:25:16] and paul raises up and he goes the next
[1:25:19] day to derby when he's done preaching
[1:25:20] them and teaching them
[1:25:22] he goes back to leicester where he was
[1:25:23] stoned he goes back to iconium where the
[1:25:26] brothers came from that stone him
[1:25:27] and to antioch where the brothers came
[1:25:29] that stoned him
[1:25:31] nothing changed his commission
[1:25:35] the circumstances didn't change his
[1:25:37] calling the circumstances didn't change
[1:25:39] his commission
[1:25:40] he was resolved to do the will of god
[1:25:42] amen he wasn't trying to protect himself
[1:25:45] he wasn't trying to avoid danger
[1:25:48] he would go right back why because god
[1:25:51] called him
[1:25:52] god commissioned him it was his calling
[1:25:54] his purpose in this life
[1:25:55] and he was going because they couldn't
[1:25:57] kill him anyways until his purpose was
[1:25:59] done
[1:26:03] sometimes god would tell paul now don't
[1:26:05] fear to go into the city and speak with
[1:26:06] boldness for
[1:26:07] have much people there and they will not
[1:26:08] harm you
[1:26:10] but he didn't do it in the next city
[1:26:14] see you can't you can't figure out god
[1:26:19] you can't say well that time that he
[1:26:22] said
[1:26:23] don't fear them i have much people in
[1:26:25] the city speak with boldness they not
[1:26:26] harm you
[1:26:27] you were in the will of god then
[1:26:30] but when you spoke in lystra and they
[1:26:32] came and stoned you you weren't in the
[1:26:34] will of god then because look at the
[1:26:35] results
[1:26:41] i hope the devil gets a black eye
[1:26:46] we can't be tossed about by all these
[1:26:49] winds
[1:26:50] of course the devil's going to come
[1:26:51] against us and there's times that god
[1:26:53] will allow
[1:26:54] affliction he will allow sickness he
[1:26:56] will allow rebuke he will allow
[1:26:58] uh uh he'll allow rejection he will
[1:27:00] allow all of these things
[1:27:01] amen and what is paul doing when paul
[1:27:04] gets up and goes to derby and preaches
[1:27:05] what's he doing he's glorifying god he's
[1:27:07] sticking with his purpose amen
[1:27:09] he's not putting himself first he's
[1:27:11] staying in the calling where with god
[1:27:12] called him
[1:27:14] then he goes back to leicester back to
[1:27:16] iconium back to antioch
[1:27:19] because god didn't tell him to do any
[1:27:20] different
[1:27:23] i think it's a shame how quickly
[1:27:26] we doubt our calling
[1:27:30] when troubles come i'm not talking about
[1:27:32] you i'm talking about me
[1:27:34] i think it's a shame how we doubt where
[1:27:36] god has placed us when it becomes
[1:27:38] difficult
[1:27:42] in victory day the prophet of god says
[1:27:44] so
[1:27:45] so had israel forgotten they'd become
[1:27:48] satisfied down in egypt and then become
[1:27:50] slaves
[1:27:52] and now there was a moses that went down
[1:27:54] within his own intellectual affair to
[1:27:56] intellectual achievement
[1:27:58] to try and under a military force to
[1:28:00] bring out israel
[1:28:01] and failed to do it but just a word from
[1:28:04] god on the backside of the desert boiled
[1:28:06] the whole thing up again
[1:28:08] what happened to moses he got his
[1:28:10] glasses focused
[1:28:11] god's only purpose wasn't to marry his
[1:28:13] beautiful ethiopian color girl back
[1:28:15] there and settle down and have children
[1:28:17] and raise his father-in-law
[1:28:18] sheep but his mission was to deliver the
[1:28:20] children of god out from under that
[1:28:22] bondage
[1:28:23] that was his commission that's what he
[1:28:25] was born for
[1:28:26] and each one of us is born for something
[1:28:29] we just wasn't put here for nothing
[1:28:32] i want you to take this personally today
[1:28:35] don't apply we can apply it to the bride
[1:28:37] yes the bride's here for a purpose
[1:28:39] i wanted to be i want this to mean
[1:28:41] something to the individual amen
[1:28:43] we can use terms like bride and we can
[1:28:46] lose ourselves
[1:28:47] in the term by looking again at a group
[1:28:49] but this message has come in this day
[1:28:52] to call out the individual
[1:28:55] and each one of us is born for something
[1:28:58] we just wasn't put here for nothing
[1:29:02] that mountain never happened out there
[1:29:04] just to be that tree was put there for a
[1:29:06] purpose
[1:29:07] everything is for a purpose it's got to
[1:29:09] serve and we are here for a purpose
[1:29:11] maybe it's to testify to one person and
[1:29:14] get them
[1:29:14] saved and out of that out of that might
[1:29:17] come a preacher will send a million
[1:29:18] souls to christ
[1:29:20] look at dwight moody's conversion many
[1:29:23] of those you see
[1:29:24] the one little old woman a little awash
[1:29:26] woman with a message on her heart to do
[1:29:27] something for god
[1:29:29] she rented an old livery stable and got
[1:29:30] a minister to come down and preach
[1:29:32] and nobody but a little old boy with the
[1:29:34] hair hanging down his neck and his daddy
[1:29:36] suspenders on went down there
[1:29:38] and knelt down at the altar that night
[1:29:40] dwight moody
[1:29:41] that sent a half million souls to jesus
[1:29:43] christ see
[1:29:44] that woman had something to do it was
[1:29:46] for a purpose
[1:29:48] she was made a wash woman for a purpose
[1:29:51] don't despise where god has got you but
[1:29:54] serve your purpose
[1:29:56] he says don't despise where god has got
[1:29:58] you don't be trying to get somewhere
[1:30:00] else to serve your purpose
[1:30:04] don't think in your mind if i get this
[1:30:06] or if i do that or if i begin this or if
[1:30:09] i have this position or if i move to
[1:30:11] this
[1:30:12] i'll serve god's purpose don't despise
[1:30:14] your position
[1:30:18] don't despise where god has got you
[1:30:20] right
[1:30:21] now but serve your purpose there's
[1:30:24] coming a great victory day one of these
[1:30:26] days
[1:30:26] where the battle is over and notice
[1:30:28] moses he went down after he got his
[1:30:29] glasses focused and seen that it was
[1:30:31] god's program
[1:30:32] that he was to do he went down
[1:30:36] let's go to revelation 10 7.
[1:30:39] i want to end here with a thought what
[1:30:42] i'd like to do is moses went to the
[1:30:43] backside of his desert and he got his
[1:30:45] glasses focused
[1:30:47] so i'd like to look at revelation 10 7
[1:30:48] and get our glasses focused
[1:30:51] so we can focus down on god's purpose
[1:30:54] and god's purpose in our day
[1:30:58] revelations 10 7 but in the days of the
[1:31:01] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:31:02] begin to sound
[1:31:03] the mystery of god should be finished as
[1:31:05] he has declared to his servants
[1:31:08] the prophets we live in the day
[1:31:11] that under the voice of the seventh
[1:31:13] angel the mystery of god shall be
[1:31:14] finished
[1:31:16] the seven thunders had uttered their
[1:31:18] voices but john was told
[1:31:19] to write not but there was going to come
[1:31:21] a time
[1:31:22] when christ would come and he would come
[1:31:25] and work
[1:31:25] through a prophet and when he come
[1:31:28] through that prophet
[1:31:29] amen he would begin to give the
[1:31:31] interpretation of the thunders which was
[1:31:33] what
[1:31:33] and the mysteries that were contained in
[1:31:35] the seals
[1:31:37] and it was god that was doing that and
[1:31:39] what was he doing it was the
[1:31:41] mystery of god revealing the mysteries
[1:31:43] of god
[1:31:46] and he was in in doing that he was he
[1:31:48] was going to
[1:31:49] he was going to finish the mystery the
[1:31:52] singular mystery of god
[1:31:54] and so brother branham would come in
[1:31:55] july he finished the seals
[1:31:58] in march and he would come in july of
[1:31:59] the same year and he would preach
[1:32:01] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:32:05] and you if you catch revelations 10 7
[1:32:07] when brother branham comes
[1:32:09] now to christ the mystery of god
[1:32:11] revealed he's preaching
[1:32:12] revelations 10 7. he's explaining to you
[1:32:17] what that mystery of god is the mystery
[1:32:20] of god
[1:32:20] is christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:32:23] it's
[1:32:24] christ it's god revealed through christ
[1:32:27] what's christ doing revealing god
[1:32:31] so the mystery of god will be finished
[1:32:33] as the revelation coming through christ
[1:32:35] is being completed
[1:32:37] it is finishing the mystery of god
[1:32:40] because there's been a mystery about god
[1:32:42] and god's been portraying this mystery
[1:32:45] when we come to the end time he's going
[1:32:48] to he's going to begin to reveal the
[1:32:50] mystery
[1:32:50] what's been a mystery will become a
[1:32:52] secret
[1:32:54] what's been a mystery to everybody will
[1:32:56] become a secret to his bride
[1:32:57] and the reason we're going to this is i
[1:32:59] want to focus our glasses now
[1:33:01] on what is our purpose as individuals
[1:33:05] and the message christ is the mystery of
[1:33:06] god revealed prophet of god says
[1:33:10] now god had a purpose and a hidden
[1:33:13] mystery
[1:33:15] what are we going to talk about now
[1:33:17] god's purpose
[1:33:19] we get so distracted by all the things
[1:33:23] in the world
[1:33:24] so distracted by all the things we go
[1:33:26] through daily
[1:33:28] that we need to get our glasses focused
[1:33:30] again
[1:33:32] we have difficulties and we have strife
[1:33:34] and we have hardship and we've
[1:33:36] got all kinds of up and downs and this
[1:33:38] is just part of living in this life
[1:33:40] you know that god as we lived in this
[1:33:41] life he never took away
[1:33:43] all of the effects of the curse when he
[1:33:45] put us in this life
[1:33:47] he called us he quickened us to life but
[1:33:50] he never
[1:33:50] he didn't take away aging
[1:33:55] he didn't take away amen the fact that
[1:33:58] sickness will still come
[1:33:59] difficulties upon this earth we still
[1:34:01] suffer with many things like the rest of
[1:34:03] the world suffers
[1:34:04] but they suffer with no purpose we
[1:34:06] suffer with a purpose
[1:34:10] there's no direction for them the only
[1:34:12] purpose they have is a self-purpose amen
[1:34:15] but we have a different purpose and all
[1:34:16] of these things we may have the same
[1:34:19] things happen to us that happen to the
[1:34:20] world
[1:34:21] amen but our reaction should be
[1:34:23] different than the world's reaction
[1:34:25] because our glasses are focused to god's
[1:34:27] purpose
[1:34:29] and god's purpose is to live his life in
[1:34:32] individuals amen
[1:34:33] and so don't don't don't let me as i
[1:34:36] talk
[1:34:36] don't let me use terms that cause you to
[1:34:39] think bride
[1:34:40] i want to use terms that cause you to
[1:34:41] think me amen i want you to raise your
[1:34:43] hand and say he's talking about me
[1:34:45] amen let's focus our glasses down so you
[1:34:47] can see god's purpose is you
[1:34:49] amen god's purpose is realized in you
[1:34:51] god's purpose is displayed in you
[1:34:53] and the mystery of god is being revealed
[1:34:55] in you
[1:34:58] as an individual this is finishing the
[1:35:01] mystery of god
[1:35:04] now god had a purpose and a hidden
[1:35:06] mystery and that's what i want to speak
[1:35:08] on to the church this morning the hidden
[1:35:09] mystery of god
[1:35:10] that he had in his mind before the world
[1:35:12] ever began and how that it's unfolded
[1:35:15] itself right
[1:35:16] down to this present hour that we're
[1:35:18] living
[1:35:19] see then you will understand clearly
[1:35:22] then you see
[1:35:23] on i believe what is being done
[1:35:26] god's great mystery of how it's a secret
[1:35:30] he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing
[1:35:32] about it even the angels didn't
[1:35:33] understand it see
[1:35:35] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[1:35:37] under our seventh mystery
[1:35:38] when the seventh seal was open there was
[1:35:40] silence jesus when he was on earth
[1:35:42] they wanted to know when he would come
[1:35:45] he said even the son himself don't know
[1:35:47] when it's going to happen see
[1:35:48] god has this all to himself it's a
[1:35:50] secret
[1:35:51] and that's the reason there was silence
[1:35:53] in heaven through space of half an hour
[1:35:55] and seven thunders under their voices
[1:35:57] and john was even forbidden to write it
[1:35:59] see the coming of the lord that's one
[1:36:02] thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he
[1:36:04] will come
[1:36:05] when he will come it's a good thing that
[1:36:07] he doesn't no
[1:36:10] now listen to the next statement he has
[1:36:13] showed
[1:36:14] or revealed it in every type that's in
[1:36:17] the bible
[1:36:23] he has showed or revealed it in every
[1:36:25] type that's in the bible
[1:36:27] the entire bible is the revelation of
[1:36:30] god's mystery in christ
[1:36:34] the entire bible is an expression of one
[1:36:36] goal that god had
[1:36:38] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:36:40] entire bible
[1:36:41] and the acts of the believers in the
[1:36:42] bible has been type
[1:36:44] in type and expressing what god's great
[1:36:46] goal is and now in this last day he has
[1:36:49] revealed it
[1:36:50] and shows it and god's help
[1:36:54] well you'll see it right here this
[1:36:56] morning what the lord has had in his
[1:36:57] mind
[1:36:58] all along and has expressed it
[1:37:02] what is he talking about the seventh
[1:37:04] seal
[1:37:05] the mystery of god christ being the
[1:37:08] mystery of god revealed
[1:37:11] in your part in christ
[1:37:15] it says god had one purpose
[1:37:18] now if we could just focus to god's one
[1:37:21] purpose
[1:37:22] and focus on what god's one purpose is
[1:37:26] and then we could find ourselves in that
[1:37:28] purpose
[1:37:30] then we can begin to realize the purpose
[1:37:32] of everything we go through
[1:37:34] we can find our purpose we can find our
[1:37:37] purpose in trial
[1:37:38] we can find our purpose and difficulty
[1:37:40] we can find our
[1:37:41] purpose and blessings we can find our
[1:37:43] purpose in every way
[1:37:45] if we keep focused on what god's purpose
[1:37:47] is
[1:37:48] what is one goal what the one thing he
[1:37:50] wanted to achieve
[1:37:51] and what the entire bible has been
[1:37:53] typing out all through the bible
[1:37:55] has come down right to this today
[1:37:58] and it's come right down to you and i
[1:38:00] today and if we can keep focused on that
[1:38:03] purpose
[1:38:04] then everything that comes along we need
[1:38:06] to take god's purpose to the situation
[1:38:09] amen and understand how to react because
[1:38:11] if god
[1:38:12] now god's great purpose he's played it
[1:38:15] in a three-fold manner we talk about
[1:38:16] this all the time
[1:38:18] but i want to keep the keep expressing
[1:38:19] it until it becomes so
[1:38:21] second nature to us we don't even have
[1:38:22] to think about it it's just who we are
[1:38:24] it's a revelation so deep in our hearts
[1:38:27] so part of our experience
[1:38:28] that we just react out of this
[1:38:29] revelation
[1:38:32] that he had a threefold purpose and the
[1:38:34] first fold of this
[1:38:35] that he had he had one plan one goal one
[1:38:38] purpose but he unfolded it in a
[1:38:39] threefold manner
[1:38:41] first was to get preeminence in a man
[1:38:43] and he did that in christ jesus
[1:38:45] and second is to get preeminence in a
[1:38:47] body he's doing that now
[1:38:50] where is he doing it he's trying to do
[1:38:53] it and you and i
[1:38:55] that's part of this great mystery that's
[1:38:59] the second fold of this great mystery
[1:39:01] that god had
[1:39:03] that is laying under the seventh seal
[1:39:06] that is the secret
[1:39:08] that's the secret of his coming and
[1:39:12] you're part of it
[1:39:14] and what's he trying to do get
[1:39:15] preeminence in you and i
[1:39:18] so the next time the doctor says you've
[1:39:20] got xyz
[1:39:22] come back to this and say what's god's
[1:39:24] purpose
[1:39:27] he wants to display himself through this
[1:39:30] body
[1:39:31] and he wants me to respond in faith to
[1:39:34] the doctor saying you have xyz
[1:39:38] not in bitterness not in complaint not
[1:39:41] like
[1:39:41] elijah but i want to be like i want to
[1:39:43] be whatever god would be whatever christ
[1:39:46] would be in this body of flesh
[1:39:47] i want to respond that way in this
[1:39:49] situation because that's
[1:39:51] the mystery revealed what's the mystery
[1:39:54] revealed in our day
[1:39:55] the mystery revealed in our day is jesus
[1:39:57] christ and the formation of the bride
[1:40:00] so everything we go through we need to
[1:40:02] take this perspective
[1:40:03] this focus back to god's purpose and say
[1:40:06] how am i supposed to deal with this
[1:40:08] situation
[1:40:08] i'm supposed to let christ deal with it
[1:40:10] through me i'm not supposed to use my
[1:40:12] own mind i'm not supposed to try to fix
[1:40:14] it i'm not supposed to protect myself
[1:40:16] what i'm supposed to do is just
[1:40:17] surrender to god to take his word to
[1:40:20] believe it in the face of this situation
[1:40:22] and watch god overcome through this body
[1:40:24] of flesh
[1:40:25] watch him display himself over and over
[1:40:28] and over again
[1:40:31] that's what he was doing in the apostle
[1:40:32] paul
[1:40:34] that's what he wants to do in us
[1:40:37] again in christ is the mystery of god
[1:40:38] revealed he said he proves his
[1:40:40] resurrection life
[1:40:41] then as he vindicates himself she the
[1:40:44] bride
[1:40:45] is independent from all others she's an
[1:40:48] independent woman a great speckled bird
[1:40:51] that's different from all others
[1:40:53] remember the bible on that that great
[1:40:55] speckled bird but she had his name
[1:40:57] she had his life how did they speckle
[1:40:59] the bird
[1:41:00] they were both white and then they
[1:41:02] pulled the head off of one bird
[1:41:03] and drained the blood up upon the other
[1:41:05] bird and the other bird was speckled
[1:41:07] with the red blood
[1:41:08] and it flopped its wings like this and
[1:41:10] the blood cried holy
[1:41:12] holy holy as it bathed the ground
[1:41:15] so christ the dead mate put his blood
[1:41:18] his blood from his life
[1:41:20] amen it is carrying his blood crying
[1:41:23] holy
[1:41:24] holy holy unto the lord it's an odd
[1:41:26] looking bird sure it is
[1:41:28] but she's the bride is identified by him
[1:41:31] and she is independent from all others
[1:41:33] keep thee only under her as long as you
[1:41:35] both live
[1:41:36] keep the only unto him the word no
[1:41:38] adultery
[1:41:39] not one sign of denomination not one
[1:41:41] side of creed no adultery at all the
[1:41:43] word
[1:41:44] and him alone on christ a solid rock i
[1:41:47] stand all other ground as sinking sin
[1:41:50] that's it christ the word he was the
[1:41:52] word he is the word
[1:41:54] and the church becomes the word by him
[1:41:56] making her a part of him
[1:41:57] and that's the word again personally
[1:42:00] identified by him
[1:42:01] his property alone his property alone
[1:42:04] she is redeemed by him through him
[1:42:08] for him and for him alone that's right
[1:42:11] then what is the devil howling about
[1:42:13] that it's being revealed
[1:42:16] he's upset that it's being revealed that
[1:42:19] you
[1:42:19] are connected to the mystery of god that
[1:42:22] you are revealing
[1:42:23] the finishing of the mystery of god as
[1:42:26] god
[1:42:27] in the as the life of christ comes down
[1:42:29] and comes into you
[1:42:30] and begins to flow through you that you
[1:42:33] are now
[1:42:34] portraying this mystery that's laying in
[1:42:36] the seventh seal
[1:42:38] that it's you as an individual not you
[1:42:40] as a group not you as this church
[1:42:41] not you as the message as a whole but
[1:42:43] you as an
[1:42:44] individual are part of this mystery
[1:42:49] and you are displaying the mystery as
[1:42:52] you let the word flow through you
[1:42:56] that's what the devil's howling about
[1:42:58] that's why the devil
[1:42:59] will come and try to shut down that
[1:43:01] mystery by an obstacle
[1:43:03] he may he'll try to shut it down by a
[1:43:05] stoning or by a rejection or whatever he
[1:43:07] tries to shut it down but
[1:43:09] paul wasn't taking the bait he
[1:43:11] understood amen that he was part of that
[1:43:13] mystery and he was revealing amen
[1:43:16] the light and to the gentiles part of
[1:43:17] the word and he would get back
[1:43:19] up and continue in his commission and
[1:43:21] never stop
[1:43:23] until god said you're done and when he
[1:43:26] was done
[1:43:27] he couldn't stop the guillotine from
[1:43:29] chopping off his head
[1:43:31] because he had fulfilled god's purpose
[1:43:35] i want to keep my glasses focused
[1:43:40] the seventh seal is not doctrine
[1:43:46] oh i just want that to soak in the
[1:43:49] seventh seal is not doctrine
[1:43:55] it's god manifest through his attributes
[1:44:02] it is his great mystery of himself
[1:44:06] becoming tangible that's the seventh
[1:44:09] seal
[1:44:11] the seventh seal isn't doctrine
[1:44:14] you can't get somebody to it by doctrine
[1:44:20] it's a life it's his life
[1:44:24] it's his life having preeminence
[1:44:27] in you the seventh seal is not a
[1:44:32] doctrine
[1:44:34] it's god it's the
[1:44:37] mystery of god revealed it's god in
[1:44:41] these final days
[1:44:42] having a people so under his control
[1:44:45] that they only do
[1:44:46] his will and his will only that they
[1:44:49] face
[1:44:50] every obstacle believing in him trusting
[1:44:52] in him
[1:44:53] confident that his word will not fail
[1:44:55] confident that he will not fail them
[1:44:58] being a submissive bride being a wife
[1:45:00] that will reflect back to the husband
[1:45:02] perfect trust perfect confidence
[1:45:06] that's the mystery that's being refilled
[1:45:08] in this hour
[1:45:10] it's not doctrine friends it's a life
[1:45:14] it's not just a life it's his life
[1:45:18] the mysteries have been revealed to take
[1:45:20] us away from all denominational ideas
[1:45:22] that would that would bring
[1:45:23] anything else and mix anything else with
[1:45:25] this understanding
[1:45:27] it was opened up amen not for the
[1:45:30] purpose of doctrine but the doctrine was
[1:45:32] to bring us to this revelation
[1:45:33] amen so it wouldn't be us trying to
[1:45:36] achieve something it wouldn't be us
[1:45:38] trying to gain something it wouldn't be
[1:45:40] us trying to just understand something
[1:45:42] and by understanding it we would have an
[1:45:43] achievement
[1:45:44] that's not the purpose of the seals
[1:45:46] that's not why the mysteries have been
[1:45:48] revealed
[1:45:48] the mysteries have been revealed so that
[1:45:50] we wouldn't fall back into the same
[1:45:51] denominational trap that the church has
[1:45:53] falled into for 2000 years
[1:45:56] so that we would break away from all of
[1:45:58] man's ideas and all of
[1:45:59] man's injections that he injected into
[1:46:02] the word and come
[1:46:03] back to faith in the original word amen
[1:46:05] and come back to be
[1:46:06] the bride that he has always longed to
[1:46:08] have
[1:46:10] and the seventh seal is revealing this
[1:46:13] now amen that's why
[1:46:14] you are part of this mystery of the
[1:46:16] seventh seal you
[1:46:18] not not don't don't don't throw this off
[1:46:20] on anybody else but say right here
[1:46:23] he's revealing part of his threefold
[1:46:25] plan right here in me
[1:46:26] amen one purpose that he had from before
[1:46:29] the foundation of the world
[1:46:30] and every character in the bible has
[1:46:32] been typing it
[1:46:34] everything he wrote everything he said
[1:46:37] all the law and all the prophets and
[1:46:39] everything has been trying it's been
[1:46:41] trying to reveal this great mystery that
[1:46:43] god's had and he's been unfolding it all
[1:46:45] down through time
[1:46:46] amen and he unfolded the first fold when
[1:46:48] jesus christ was standing here
[1:46:50] who was a representative of god and a
[1:46:52] perfect reflection of the life of god
[1:46:56] and that was the first fold but the
[1:46:58] second fold was to take out of him a
[1:46:59] bride
[1:47:01] and build it through seven church ages
[1:47:03] and unite the two back together so that
[1:47:05] you would have standing on earth a bride
[1:47:07] that would act like a proper bride that
[1:47:09] would be what he has never had
[1:47:11] in the history of the world he would
[1:47:13] have a bride that would keep only to him
[1:47:17] and be subjected to him and reverence
[1:47:20] him
[1:47:21] and believe him and trust him
[1:47:27] and that's why you
[1:47:32] the seventh seal is not a doctrine it's
[1:47:36] not a fairy something
[1:47:37] far off that if i could only get to the
[1:47:39] seventh seal
[1:47:40] if it only was revealed i would have
[1:47:43] some mystery power
[1:47:45] no the power's already been given
[1:47:49] he's coming the fullness of his word to
[1:47:51] inject his full life
[1:47:53] into you into the bride so that you
[1:47:55] could have the very life of christ
[1:47:56] so that he could act out live out his
[1:47:59] his life
[1:48:00] his will his purpose his word in your
[1:48:03] flesh
[1:48:06] what does he need from us surrender
[1:48:11] what does he need what does every man
[1:48:14] need from his wife
[1:48:16] submission
[1:48:19] god is looking for us to submit
[1:48:23] when he says no we submit
[1:48:27] when he says yes we submit when he says
[1:48:29] go we submit when he says stop
[1:48:31] we submit what's he looking for somebody
[1:48:34] who
[1:48:34] trusts him enough enough
[1:48:38] that she doesn't have to inject herself
[1:48:40] or her own idea
[1:48:41] she can take it the way god sent it
[1:48:44] and trust him what is that that's the
[1:48:47] seventh seal
[1:48:48] on display let me read this
[1:48:51] a couple things to you so you'll see
[1:48:53] what i'm saying
[1:48:54] and the message desperations which he
[1:48:56] preached in the evening after he
[1:48:57] preached the token
[1:48:59] so now we have sometimes allowed it the
[1:49:01] lutherans allowed it to accepting the
[1:49:02] word accepting christ's personal savior
[1:49:05] the methodist said when you get happy
[1:49:06] enough to shout that's it
[1:49:08] the pentecostal says speak in tongues
[1:49:10] then you got it and we find out that all
[1:49:12] of it was wrong see
[1:49:13] and the token is the token it's you and
[1:49:16] christ as persons together
[1:49:20] it's the holy spirit his life in you
[1:49:22] working his own life
[1:49:24] through you it's for rich the poor
[1:49:27] for whosoever will receive it
[1:49:30] galatians 4 19 the apostle paul says in
[1:49:33] little children
[1:49:34] of whom i travail and birth again until
[1:49:37] christ
[1:49:37] be formed in you what was paul
[1:49:41] laboring to produce christ in the church
[1:49:45] that's what paul was laboring he was in
[1:49:47] another birth pains he was travailing
[1:49:49] again in birth
[1:49:50] what was he trying to do to the
[1:49:51] galatians he was trying
[1:49:53] amen he was he was trying he was
[1:49:55] travailing at birth so christ be formed
[1:49:57] in you
[1:49:57] that was the purpose of his gospel
[1:49:59] that's why brother branham would take us
[1:50:01] back to the gospel that paul preached
[1:50:03] because paul was trying to birth christ
[1:50:05] in a church the message things that are
[1:50:10] to be says now
[1:50:12] if you are those attributes of god we
[1:50:14] cannot live by creeds
[1:50:16] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[1:50:19] must live by the word because the bride
[1:50:21] is part of the bridegroom like any wife
[1:50:23] is part of her husband
[1:50:24] therefore we must be that word bride and
[1:50:27] what is the word bride
[1:50:29] the manifestation of this hour the bride
[1:50:32] not a creed
[1:50:33] or a denomination but a living oracle of
[1:50:36] god
[1:50:37] a living attribute of god displaying to
[1:50:40] the world the attributes of god
[1:50:42] and the formation of the bride that's to
[1:50:44] be expressed in this hour that we're now
[1:50:46] living
[1:50:47] martin luther could not express the
[1:50:48] attributes that we express
[1:50:50] because that was in the beginning the
[1:50:52] resurrection
[1:50:53] like the corn of the wheat that went
[1:50:55] into the earth
[1:50:56] martin luther was the beginning of the
[1:50:58] resurrection what was god doing
[1:50:59] resurrecting his bride tree through
[1:51:01] martin luther through wesley
[1:51:03] through pentecost but now he's come to
[1:51:06] the restoration of the bride tree
[1:51:07] to have the fruit on the tree what is
[1:51:10] the fruit the same life that jesus
[1:51:12] christ lived is now to live in his bride
[1:51:16] what is that that's the mystery of god
[1:51:18] revealed
[1:51:20] that's the second full mystery coming
[1:51:22] into full revelation
[1:51:24] and coming into full manifestation
[1:51:30] god needs a yielded vessel
[1:51:34] the seventh seal isn't to be taught
[1:51:38] it's to be manifested
[1:51:43] seventh seal isn't to be taught in some
[1:51:47] way
[1:51:48] i mean we teach about the sentence of
[1:51:49] course we'll always teach the word and
[1:51:51] that's the revelation of our hour
[1:51:52] i don't mean that we're not going to
[1:51:54] teach but the seven seals and to be
[1:51:56] taught
[1:51:58] it's to be lived it's to be displayed
[1:52:01] it's to be manifested
[1:52:03] you're at home as a mother with little
[1:52:06] babies what kind of mother are you to be
[1:52:07] you're to be a seven seal mother
[1:52:10] you as a daddy uh overseeing a family
[1:52:13] and shepherding a flock what are you to
[1:52:15] be you're to be a seven seal daddy
[1:52:19] you're to be a christ daddy and a christ
[1:52:21] mommy
[1:52:24] what is that that's the display of this
[1:52:27] hour that's the manifestation in this
[1:52:28] hour
[1:52:29] that's bride wherever he's placed you as
[1:52:31] bride amen you may be mom you may be dad
[1:52:34] you may be a worker somewhere you maybe
[1:52:36] have an office in the church
[1:52:37] it doesn't matter where you're at don't
[1:52:38] despise where he placed you
[1:52:40] but be bride and be the manifestation of
[1:52:43] the seventh seal wherever you're planted
[1:52:46] if it's grandma grandpa this one now it
[1:52:49] doesn't matter what titles and what
[1:52:50] positions
[1:52:51] whether it's male or female forget all
[1:52:53] of that and say the seventh seal needs
[1:52:56] to be displayed right here in this flesh
[1:52:58] right now
[1:52:58] and for him to have the display that he
[1:53:00] needs the preeminence i've got to submit
[1:53:03] to my headshot
[1:53:05] and everything he says in all of his
[1:53:06] directions i just want to yield and say
[1:53:08] god
[1:53:09] be it unto you according to your word
[1:53:16] colossians 1. we read it all the time
[1:53:18] but i'm going to read it again
[1:53:19] colossians 1 26.
[1:53:21] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:53:23] ages from generations but now has made
[1:53:26] manifest to his saints
[1:53:28] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:53:30] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:53:31] among the gentiles
[1:53:33] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:53:40] the seventh seal in the first fold
[1:53:43] was god in christ and in the second fold
[1:53:47] is christ in his bride
[1:53:50] that's why the word was restored this
[1:53:51] day so we knew
[1:53:53] what to submit to we knew who to submit
[1:53:56] to
[1:53:58] we knew what it was like what word it
[1:54:00] was to live and to reflect in this day
[1:54:03] that's why god sent us profit in this
[1:54:05] day
[1:54:06] and the message i'm going to read a
[1:54:07] couple quotes and we'll finish the
[1:54:09] meanest man i know he says we
[1:54:11] we can't never compare with the world
[1:54:13] we're doing wrong by trying to act like
[1:54:15] the world
[1:54:16] we're never can compare with them and
[1:54:18] we've got no business out on their
[1:54:20] grounds
[1:54:20] bring them over on our grounds we got
[1:54:22] something they haven't got
[1:54:24] we go to act like them then we know
[1:54:26] we're saying something we haven't got
[1:54:28] let the world come to us not us go out
[1:54:30] after the world
[1:54:32] you know hollywood shines but the gospel
[1:54:34] glows there's a lot of difference
[1:54:36] between shining and glowing
[1:54:37] glow not shine with the outward
[1:54:39] appearance glow on the inside by the
[1:54:41] holy ghost
[1:54:42] with sweetness meekness gentleness
[1:54:44] patience and love
[1:54:46] glow don't shine shine is after the
[1:54:48] world
[1:54:50] the church is a whole lot like it was in
[1:54:52] the days of esther
[1:54:53] esther didn't take the perfuming of the
[1:54:55] women she adorned herself with modest
[1:54:57] apparel the hidden man of the heart
[1:54:59] and the king said put the crown on her
[1:55:01] head esther was the type of the church
[1:55:03] today those who are ready to come out
[1:55:05] and adorn themselves with the sweetness
[1:55:07] of the holy spirit not the perfuming and
[1:55:09] the dressing of the world
[1:55:10] try to compare with them but the hidden
[1:55:12] man of the heart that's the one
[1:55:15] the other man said the church is a whole
[1:55:17] lot like esther today esther we know was
[1:55:19] taken and
[1:55:20] she was taken with all the virgins and
[1:55:22] she was taken into the care of haggai
[1:55:24] who had to care of the virgins and and
[1:55:26] haggy i put her in a place and gave her
[1:55:27] maids
[1:55:28] and he gave her everything she needed
[1:55:30] for for her anointing and for her
[1:55:32] preparation amen to be united with the
[1:55:34] king
[1:55:35] and she listened to haggai who is the
[1:55:38] prophet of the day for us
[1:55:41] our haggai he gave us everything we
[1:55:43] needed
[1:55:44] he gave us all the instructions we
[1:55:46] needed he gave us everything we needed
[1:55:48] to be ready to be prepared to meet the
[1:55:51] king
[1:55:52] and the scripture says if esther when it
[1:55:54] was her turn to go into the king
[1:55:56] she required nothing but what haggaid
[1:55:59] the chamberlain had given her
[1:56:00] had required of her that means she
[1:56:03] didn't take her own idea
[1:56:05] she didn't take her own wishes she
[1:56:07] didn't take her own once
[1:56:08] amen whatever that prophet said amen was
[1:56:11] good enough for her amen
[1:56:12] if the prophet said this is what god
[1:56:14] likes and this is what god wants if that
[1:56:16] if that haggy i said
[1:56:17] the king likes it this way and the king
[1:56:19] likes it that way
[1:56:20] i think you should wear this outfit i
[1:56:22] think you should put this with it
[1:56:24] i think this goes together she had no
[1:56:26] mind of her own
[1:56:27] but she knew that that haggai had been
[1:56:30] to where that king was
[1:56:31] and knew the mind of the king
[1:56:36] and the church today is not supposed to
[1:56:38] be taking perfumes of the world and her
[1:56:40] own ideas
[1:56:41] and denominational ideas but what that
[1:56:43] prophet brought to us was what we needed
[1:56:45] to unite with the king
[1:56:46] and when the king saw that esther come
[1:56:49] there was something different about
[1:56:50] esther than all the other virgins
[1:56:54] because all the other virgins could take
[1:56:55] anything they want but esther
[1:56:57] the scriptures as esther required
[1:56:59] nothing but what heggie i had provided
[1:57:02] that means she had an opportunity she
[1:57:03] could pick out the dress she wants she
[1:57:05] could pick out the attire
[1:57:06] she could go in this perfume and that
[1:57:08] and in this and everyone who come before
[1:57:10] the king
[1:57:11] that was not acceptable not acceptable
[1:57:12] not acceptable not acceptable but when
[1:57:15] the one came
[1:57:16] that came only the way haggai had
[1:57:18] prepared her
[1:57:19] when he looked at her he saw a character
[1:57:22] that he could trust in
[1:57:24] and it was a character that was
[1:57:26] different than vashti's
[1:57:28] because vashti's character was
[1:57:30] self-willed and then when the king
[1:57:32] called for her she stayed back
[1:57:35] but when he looked at esther and esther
[1:57:38] only had what haggai had provided all
[1:57:41] the way he had said and
[1:57:42] how he addressed her what he had told
[1:57:44] her to take when he saw one that would
[1:57:46] be obedient to haggai
[1:57:48] he said that's the one that i'll put the
[1:57:50] crown on and that's the one that i'll
[1:57:52] let be my wife
[1:57:54] and the bride's got to be of the same
[1:57:56] mind today amen we're not here to
[1:57:57] protect ourselves defend ourselves make
[1:57:59] ourselves better
[1:58:00] do something special we're just here to
[1:58:02] submit to the leadership that god has
[1:58:04] given us in this day and to receive his
[1:58:06] word
[1:58:07] and to submit to that word and in
[1:58:09] submitting to that word
[1:58:10] he's going to find a bride that reflects
[1:58:12] his own character
[1:58:14] because what was the character of jesus
[1:58:16] christ the character of jesus christ was
[1:58:18] i only do that which the father shows
[1:58:20] me jesus christ was a man who is under
[1:58:24] complete
[1:58:24] perfect submission to the father he
[1:58:27] can't have
[1:58:27] any other kind of wife it's the only
[1:58:30] wife that he can have
[1:58:32] because he can only have a wife that
[1:58:34] reflects his character
[1:58:36] brother braham says in choosing of a
[1:58:38] bride the kind of wife a man chooses
[1:58:40] shows what kind of character he is
[1:58:44] and god cannot choose a bride that
[1:58:47] doesn't have
[1:58:48] his character and the bride of his
[1:58:50] character will be the one that's
[1:58:51] submissive
[1:58:52] to the father in all things
[1:58:58] christ is the mystery god revealed again
[1:58:59] he says
[1:59:02] there is only one thing can happen there
[1:59:04] has to be a message at the end time when
[1:59:06] there is nothing else can follow it
[1:59:08] and now the ecumenical world has set up
[1:59:10] such a regime
[1:59:11] that there can be no denomination and no
[1:59:14] nothing else follow him you're either in
[1:59:16] it or you're not
[1:59:17] the fruit is in the top of the tree and
[1:59:18] the light is shining on that
[1:59:20] predestinated fruit
[1:59:21] and she is ripening into christ like
[1:59:23] bringing forth
[1:59:24] the same mellowness and sweetness the
[1:59:27] same spirit that he had in him
[1:59:29] i hope you see it we saw it
[1:59:33] brother says i hope you see it did you
[1:59:35] see it i saw it in that man
[1:59:39] he was submissive to his heavenly father
[1:59:43] he was submissive and obedient to the
[1:59:45] word
[1:59:46] in all things when he was wrong he was
[1:59:49] corrected by the holy spirit he came
[1:59:50] back and he made it right
[1:59:53] see if we say that we have the
[1:59:57] revelation of the seventh seal
[2:00:00] but we have an arrogant condemning
[2:00:03] critical
[2:00:04] judgmental nature i don't think we have
[2:00:07] the revelation of the seventh seal
[2:00:10] because it's to bring forth christ like
[2:00:13] fruit
[2:00:15] to be like him
[2:00:18] brother bev says in the message how can
[2:00:19] i overcome he said sanctify us lord
[2:00:22] fill us anew with thy holy spirit may
[2:00:24] the holy ghost just reign in our hearts
[2:00:25] supremely
[2:00:26] that we'll walk forgetting the things
[2:00:28] that are in the past the muck the mire
[2:00:30] that we once lived in
[2:00:31] we're pressed towards the mark of the
[2:00:33] high calling where our lights can
[2:00:34] so shine and sweetness and humility till
[2:00:37] every passerby
[2:00:38] can say there's a christian lives there
[2:00:40] on that hill
[2:00:42] that person that woman that man is a
[2:00:44] real consecrated
[2:00:45] created flower of god they're so sweet
[2:00:48] and so kind always loving and sweet and
[2:00:50] understanding
[2:00:50] granite father let us be salty that the
[2:00:54] earth might thirst
[2:00:55] granite father and overcome the things
[2:00:57] of this world and the cares of this life
[2:00:59] in the name of jesus christ
[2:01:04] i don't want to verbalize
[2:01:09] my faith in my revelation of the seventh
[2:01:12] seal
[2:01:14] i want to demonstrate the seven seal
[2:01:20] i don't believe that all that god has
[2:01:21] done is on our generation and all the
[2:01:23] manifestations and the magnificent
[2:01:25] things we've seen
[2:01:26] and the tying together the loose sins
[2:01:28] and the opening of the seals
[2:01:31] i don't believe that all that was done
[2:01:33] so that we had doctrine that we could
[2:01:35] talk about
[2:01:37] but continue acting the way we acted
[2:01:39] before
[2:01:41] that we could not no longer have
[2:01:43] denominational ideas
[2:01:45] but we can have denominational behavior
[2:01:49] then we no longer have worldly ideas but
[2:01:51] we have worldly mechanisms for
[2:01:53] protecting ourselves or
[2:01:54] worldly mechanisms for figuring things
[2:01:56] out i don't think that's why god did all
[2:01:59] that he did in this day
[2:02:00] but i believe he did it in this day so
[2:02:02] that we can rise above
[2:02:04] out of ourselves and then leave
[2:02:05] ourselves behind and let christ
[2:02:08] enter in and submit like no bride has
[2:02:10] ever submitted before
[2:02:15] i don't want to just verbalize the
[2:02:19] seventh seal if all i've ever done in my
[2:02:20] life is verbalize the seventh seal
[2:02:22] i still missed the purpose of god
[2:02:27] remember christ is mystery god revealed
[2:02:29] how many purposes does god have
[2:02:35] god's great goal through the whole bible
[2:02:36] how many goals did he have
[2:02:41] and christ is the mystery of god review
[2:02:42] he says he has one goal one purpose
[2:02:45] one achievement that he's been trying to
[2:02:47] achieve all along
[2:02:48] and he reveals it in a three-fold manner
[2:02:51] the second part of that is his
[2:02:52] preeminence
[2:02:53] in me i don't want to talk about that
[2:02:57] and never live it
[2:03:00] but i say let the seventh seal be alive
[2:03:03] in you and i
[2:03:05] how do i do it brother chad just
[2:03:07] surrender
[2:03:08] just say lord i trust you
[2:03:13] see i think it's such a matter of trust
[2:03:15] in our day do we trust him
[2:03:17] oh we trust him when everything's going
[2:03:18] right but whenever everything goes wrong
[2:03:19] do we have the same
[2:03:20] confidence that we always had in him do
[2:03:22] you have the same confidence in his word
[2:03:24] and do we have the same confidence in
[2:03:26] who we are in christ
[2:03:30] i want to display that same nature he
[2:03:33] had a submission
[2:03:35] of sweetness of gentleness of kindness
[2:03:38] and just let him flow through me
[2:03:42] i want to read this last scripture to
[2:03:43] you as we close colossians 3 17
[2:03:47] and whatsoever you do in word or deed do
[2:03:50] all in the name of the lord jesus
[2:03:52] giving thanks to god and the father by
[2:03:55] him
[2:03:57] let everything you do all your life and
[2:03:59] all your reactions
[2:04:00] and all your actions may you do it all
[2:04:03] in the name of jesus christ
[2:04:05] because the bride bears the husband's
[2:04:07] name
[2:04:09] and let's focus our glasses and focus
[2:04:11] back to god's purpose and forget every
[2:04:13] other purpose
[2:04:14] and focus down to this purpose and
[2:04:16] remember
[2:04:17] who we are and what he's done through us
[2:04:21] let's all stand
[2:04:30] musicians if you'll come and brother ben
[2:04:35] i hope more than ever
[2:04:38] that we're realizing more and more
[2:04:42] that the seals aren't about doctrine
[2:04:47] it's about an understanding that
[2:04:50] understanding
[2:04:51] wasn't just to bring us uh
[2:04:55] wiser smarter and more noble than the
[2:04:58] than the
[2:04:59] pentecostals or the lutherans or the
[2:05:00] westlands or it wasn't any of that
[2:05:04] it was god peeling back the mystery of
[2:05:06] redemption
[2:05:08] peeling back who we are and where we
[2:05:10] came from and why we're here and where
[2:05:12] we're going
[2:05:14] so that he could manifest the seventh
[2:05:16] seal
[2:05:17] in this world in this day and i say
[2:05:20] let's give it more than lip service
[2:05:23] let's give it life service
[2:05:25] let's let it be tangible alive
[2:05:29] so when jesus when they looked at jesus
[2:05:32] and they said
[2:05:33] to jesus show us the father and it will
[2:05:36] suffice
[2:05:37] jesus says have i been so long with you
[2:05:40] and you don't know me
[2:05:42] when you've seen me you've seen the
[2:05:43] father and if somebody will say
[2:05:46] show me jesus christ you told me he came
[2:05:49] in 63 show me jesus christ
[2:05:52] i want to live in such a way i say have
[2:05:54] you been with me so long and you don't
[2:05:56] see him
[2:05:58] for it's him living in me this is not my
[2:06:00] life anymore
[2:06:01] i had a different kind of life but he
[2:06:03] took over and it's a different life and
[2:06:05] now i'm trusting in him and i'm living
[2:06:06] for him
[2:06:09] i'm submitted to him it was god
[2:06:12] through christ and now christ through
[2:06:15] his bride
[2:06:17] and let everything we do with word and
[2:06:20] deed
[2:06:21] do all in the name of the lord jesus

[2:09:25] oh precious lord
[2:09:30] strip me up vainglory and of course
[2:09:55] make me
[2:10:02] [Music]
[2:10:17] please take away
[2:10:20] all that's left
[2:10:30] precious
[2:10:34] [Music]
[2:10:36] make me i
[2:10:42] pray
[2:10:44] [Music]
[2:10:46] singing oh precious lord
[2:10:56] [Music]
[2:11:07] oh pressure lord
[2:11:26] i just like to say as we go i pray that
[2:11:29] god will put
[2:11:30] what was in my heart into your heart
[2:11:33] words are not adequate we take so much
[2:11:36] time to try to explain and never
[2:11:38] can come to the point
[2:11:41] but i know that whatever jesus christ
[2:11:45] was
[2:11:46] to god i am to be the christ
[2:11:51] and one of the attributes that he's
[2:11:52] played that was so marvelous
[2:11:55] was his absolute trust in his father
[2:12:00] he had absolute trust and confidence
[2:12:04] in god and i want more than
[2:12:08] anything else for all my actions and all
[2:12:11] my words
[2:12:12] i want everything to display an absolute
[2:12:16] trust in christ
[2:12:18] that i completely trust him that i don't
[2:12:22] doubt his care for me i don't doubt his
[2:12:24] love for me i don't doubt his
[2:12:25] watchfulness for me
[2:12:26] that the way i speak and the way i react
[2:12:29] and
[2:12:29] everything that i do will show that i
[2:12:32] trust him
[2:12:34] and i can submit to him more if it just
[2:12:37] give me the power by his spirit to yield
[2:12:40] more
[2:12:40] my desire is to yield more to show him
[2:12:42] that i trust him
[2:12:44] because if i show him that i trust him
[2:12:45] it's proof that i love him and i know
[2:12:47] who he is
[2:12:49] and i know who i am
[2:12:52] so i say i love you all
[2:12:56] you know with these things that we talk
[2:12:57] about they seem so difficult to live the
[2:13:00] very life of jesus christ
[2:13:02] have perfect trust and perfect faith
[2:13:05] and how could you even preach it it
[2:13:07] wasn't for the fact that god sent a
[2:13:08] prophet and said it's possible
[2:13:11] that this is the age for christ to be
[2:13:13] displayed in his bride
[2:13:15] and if it's possible if the potentials
[2:13:18] are here
[2:13:18] if the life is here then i want to say
[2:13:21] god let that life live through me
[2:13:23] it's here it's available it's not far
[2:13:25] away
[2:13:26] it's here in the revealing of the word
[2:13:28] his life has come back
[2:13:30] to abide in his bride it's possible in
[2:13:33] this hour
[2:13:34] if it's possible and i'm yours and you
[2:13:37] just need a vessel
[2:13:38] i want to say a fresh lord i'm your
[2:13:40] vessel
[2:13:43] you can have your way with me i want to
[2:13:46] trust him every part of my life
[2:13:50] god bless you as you go we love you
[2:13:52] let's just sing this song again
[2:13:59] lord strip me out
[2:14:02] vain glory and pride
