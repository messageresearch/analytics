[6:33] bibles
[6:35] i'm going to go ahead while we're
[6:36] standing together and read the opening
[6:38] scripture tonight we're going to go
[6:39] through the tape we're going to begin to
[6:41] go through the tape god's power to
[6:43] transform
[6:44] and brother branham opens up with a
[6:46] scripture out of romans chapter 12. so
[6:48] if you could turn there with me we'll
[6:50] read that before we're seated
[6:52] also we have some visitors here today
[6:53] sister naomi lau has her mother and her
[6:56] sisters here with her visiting from
[6:57] arizona so god bless you it's good to
[6:59] see you here amen it's always good to
[7:01] have visitors amen and family come in
[7:05] amen let's read romans chapter 12
[7:08] verse 1.
[7:13] as i beseech you brethren by the mercies
[7:16] of god that you present your bodies a
[7:17] living sacrifice
[7:19] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[7:21] reasonable service and be not conformed
[7:24] to this world but be transformed by the
[7:27] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[7:29] what is the good and acceptable and
[7:32] perfect will of god
[7:33] amen you can be seated
[7:40] tonight we're going to go through god's
[7:41] power to transform i think we're going
[7:44] to break this up into three segments
[7:46] each one will be roughly 45 minutes of
[7:48] the tape and we'll do this like we've
[7:49] been doing i i look back to see when we
[7:52] began doing this we started it in 2017.
[7:55] so this is our fifth year now and we
[7:57] like to do at least one tape together a
[7:59] year
[8:00] and it's been something i've very much
[8:03] have enjoyed over the last five years
[8:05] going through taking a tape with the
[8:07] book in hand or tablet or phone or
[8:09] whatever and going through it together
[8:12] but i want to back up and uh and
[8:15] go through the the whole beginning of
[8:17] this again so if we can pull up the
[8:18] powerpoint
[8:20] uh i want to remind those who maybe are
[8:22] new or
[8:23] the youth who are getting older now that
[8:26] back in 2017 we installed a message book
[8:29] rack in the
[8:31] back here in the foyer as you go out the
[8:33] back doors there
[8:34] brother elmer schwartz built this rack
[8:36] for us looks really nice and it fits in
[8:38] there perfect
[8:39] and it holds these these titles
[8:42] um the top rack
[8:44] the top six titles is what i asked the
[8:47] church back then in 2017 for the whole
[8:50] church to read in sequential order amen
[8:53] so if you haven't done that if you were
[8:55] five years ago if you were a tiny top
[8:57] but now you're a young teenager and
[8:59] you're interested in these things it'd
[9:00] be a good time to read these in
[9:02] sequential order if you're new if you
[9:03] haven't done that or if you would just
[9:05] like to go through it again to refresh
[9:07] yourself and we'll go through those
[9:09] titles in just a minute
[9:10] now the bottom six here are titles that
[9:13] get changed out every so often so always
[9:15] you can walk by the rack if you see a
[9:17] book that you don't have you can grab it
[9:18] out brother john pitzenberger helps keep
[9:22] that filled and he keeps the books
[9:24] ordered from voice of god there so we
[9:26] have the books
[9:28] we have went through several of those
[9:30] now and i'll talk about that in just a
[9:32] second so here's the top rack that's
[9:34] constantly the same six in order and
[9:37] they're in this order the spoken word is
[9:39] the original seed
[9:41] present stage of my ministry
[9:43] is this the signed of the answer the
[9:45] breach between the seven church ages and
[9:47] the seven seals the seventh seal and
[9:50] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[9:52] and there was a reason back then we
[9:54] asked for the church to go through those
[9:55] in that order amen because i had went
[9:57] through them in that order and they
[9:58] really were such a blessing to see the
[10:01] transition in brother branham's ministry
[10:03] as he was really coming in to
[10:04] fulfillment of revelations 10 7
[10:07] which ties right back to malachi 4 and
[10:10] to catch it as he was going through that
[10:12] transition and made it from one into the
[10:15] other and when you go through these
[10:16] titles in that order it just pops out
[10:18] and comes to life and so if if you
[10:20] haven't done it in a while it would be
[10:22] good to listen to those or go back
[10:23] through them in that order if you've
[10:24] never done it i'd encourage you to do so
[10:26] because it really is quite a blessing
[10:29] and then this year we ordered four more
[10:31] titles god's power to transform which
[10:33] we'll go through tonight the greatest
[10:35] battle ever fought things that are to be
[10:38] and leadership
[10:41] and then if you go into the
[10:44] library right over here when you go into
[10:46] the library just behind the door you see
[10:47] this book rack this book rack has all
[10:49] the titles that we've ordered over the
[10:51] five years that we keep in stock and uh
[10:54] as you know voice of god quit printing
[10:56] the books and whenever they have an
[10:58] inventory will be the last of these
[11:00] books that they printed before the ones
[11:02] that we're accustomed to and so when
[11:04] they run out they run out so we're
[11:06] trying we try to keep an inventory of
[11:09] everything that we have and i think we
[11:11] have 40 titles now
[11:13] so i just went and counted and looked at
[11:15] it we have 40 titles with the four
[11:16] editions we have now
[11:18] and when i when we started doing this
[11:20] uh we started going through a tape i
[11:22] caught the inspiration five years ago
[11:24] because i really wanted you know brother
[11:26] brahm told us to sit down and study
[11:28] these things
[11:29] sit down and study these things and and
[11:31] i wanted to go through it together and
[11:34] in the format like we do tonight i'll
[11:35] ask questions ahead of time and we can
[11:37] be watching for the for brother branham
[11:39] to answer those questions as we go
[11:40] through this section of the tape
[11:43] but i did it because i wanted to
[11:45] together sit down and study a message
[11:47] together and i wanted some of the young
[11:49] people and those that are new to the
[11:50] message to learn how to feed on the
[11:53] message and glean from it and and get
[11:56] into it to draw out what god is speaking
[11:58] to us not just to read it as a book and
[12:00] not just to listen to it as background
[12:03] noise you know sometimes you play
[12:04] something and it's just noise you're
[12:05] talking and doing other things and and i
[12:07] do that every morning when i get ready i
[12:09] listen to the message and you know stuff
[12:11] will strike your heart but there's times
[12:12] you need to sit down and say what is god
[12:15] telling me in this message
[12:17] what is the message god's trying to get
[12:19] to me and so i wanted us to do that
[12:21] together so that the young ones amongst
[12:23] us can learn how to really dig in and
[12:26] study a message and glean from that uh
[12:29] what god is trying to teach us not just
[12:31] read it and said i read that book but
[12:33] what was he saying
[12:34] what was the point what was the message
[12:36] the prophet was trying to get across in
[12:38] that book what was god speaking what was
[12:40] significant about that book and what was
[12:42] significant about that message in the
[12:44] sequence of messages he preached and the
[12:46] timeline of his ministry where was he in
[12:48] his ministry what was going on in that
[12:51] time what did he preach before what did
[12:53] he preach after what was it that god was
[12:55] trying to get across to his church it
[12:57] was more than just reading a book and
[12:59] said i've read a book
[13:00] but reading to really understand and see
[13:03] what god was trying to speak to us
[13:05] so tonight we're going to read god's
[13:07] power to transform
[13:09] if you look at your book some of you
[13:11] have a tablet or your phone or whatever
[13:14] if you don't have a book they're out in
[13:15] the foyer on the rack you can run out
[13:17] and grab one really quickly or if you
[13:18] forgot yours but in god's powers to
[13:21] transform i've got the spoken word book
[13:23] here that we have out there
[13:25] if you open it to the first page it's
[13:28] got the title page you turn it over to
[13:30] the back of that title page and i always
[13:32] go through this because it to me this is
[13:34] what i do every time i pick up a book
[13:36] first thing i do is say what is the
[13:39] title of this book
[13:42] god's power to transform so what brother
[13:44] branham is going to talk to us about in
[13:46] this message what god has for us is a
[13:48] message on god's power to transform and
[13:50] i want to keep that in my mind the
[13:52] entire time i listen to this message
[13:55] that this is something he's bringing
[13:56] something about god's power to transform
[13:59] so i don't want to lose sight of that
[14:00] and you know brother bam's titles are
[14:02] amazing sometimes
[14:04] and then i look at the back and i want
[14:06] to see when was it priest and this says
[14:08] 65 09 11. so september 11th in 1965
[14:12] that's also on the front left-hand
[14:14] corner of the book as well
[14:17] if you have a tablet when you do a
[14:19] search for the message it comes up on
[14:21] the right hand side how long the message
[14:23] is where it was preached and underneath
[14:24] the title
[14:26] or
[14:26] yeah
[14:27] and underneath the title it has or
[14:29] before the title has the date so you can
[14:31] always get the date to me the date's
[14:33] important because brother branham
[14:34] preached things in order as things were
[14:36] revealed and as things were opened up so
[14:39] it matters to me
[14:40] when he preached it
[14:42] so when you go and look at this there's
[14:44] a paragraph underneath there that just
[14:46] explains that the message was delivered
[14:48] on saturday morning september 11 1965
[14:51] for the full gospel businessman's
[14:52] fellowship international breakfast at
[14:54] the ramada inn in phoenix arizona usa
[14:58] i always like to know where brother
[15:00] brennan was preaching
[15:02] because because it'll help you so many
[15:04] times understand why he phrases things
[15:06] certain ways in certain times there are
[15:09] certain times he'll be preaching he'll
[15:10] say something a certain way
[15:12] amen but that he doesn't say it that way
[15:14] in jeffersonville in his home church and
[15:16] brother branham is very much trying to
[15:18] get the people he's speaking to to
[15:19] understand what he's saying
[15:21] and when he's out with denominational
[15:23] people amen many times she'll say things
[15:25] in a certain way i remember one time
[15:27] after the opening of the seals brother
[15:29] branham is preaching to a crown and he's
[15:31] saying how do you know that your name
[15:33] may not be the last name that's written
[15:35] in the lamb's book of life
[15:36] tonight
[15:37] well that's totally contrary to what he
[15:39] teaches everywhere else he teaches that
[15:41] all names that were ever written in the
[15:43] lamb's book of life were written before
[15:44] the foundation of the world and it was
[15:46] sealed and no new name has been added
[15:48] since then
[15:49] but brother branham isn't changing his
[15:51] doctrine you don't go to that quote and
[15:53] say oh he changed his doctrine he
[15:55] changed his mind he never changed his
[15:56] doctrine he was speaking to the people
[15:58] sitting in that room trying to get them
[16:00] to understand trying to get them to grab
[16:02] a hold of the word
[16:04] so to me it's always important
[16:06] what he said what he's going to preach
[16:09] about the title when he said it in the
[16:11] sequence of his ministry and who he was
[16:14] preaching to so whenever i pick up a
[16:16] book or look at a message i always go
[16:18] through these things and every year i go
[16:20] through the same thing to remind us all
[16:21] the same things because to me these
[16:24] things have really helped me
[16:27] understand in a deeper way the message
[16:29] that god has given us
[16:31] so we're going to start on
[16:33] page one paragraph one
[16:35] and i've got some questions here so if
[16:37] you've got a pen and paper and you want
[16:39] to write down these questions as we go
[16:41] through the the tape
[16:43] we can uh answer these questions brother
[16:45] ben was going to answer every one of
[16:47] these questions there are no trick
[16:49] questions
[16:50] i'm not trying to trick you brother
[16:52] benham we'll just answer these questions
[16:53] as we go through and the reason that i
[16:55] do these is because one we want to learn
[16:57] how to glean from the message and two it
[16:58] helps us stay focused on what we're
[17:01] reading looking for god to answer these
[17:02] questions for us so the the question is
[17:05] what is the bible now listen don't go
[17:07] ahead and write the answer because
[17:09] there's a lot of answers that you can
[17:10] write but we're specifically looking for
[17:12] what brother branham says in the message
[17:14] what is the what is the bible
[17:18] is question number one what is the bible
[17:23] question number two
[17:25] what does the word transform mean
[17:28] i think he actually says transformed
[17:30] either transform or transformed what
[17:32] does the word transform mean
[17:35] now don't go ahead and fill in the
[17:36] answer let's see what brother branham
[17:37] says
[17:40] so number two what does the word
[17:42] transform
[17:44] mean
[17:47] and then question number three
[17:50] what channel must every seed stay in
[17:56] what channel
[17:58] must every seed
[18:00] stay in
[18:05] we'll give you just a second to get
[18:06] caught up because this screen will go
[18:08] away because we'll have the scrolling
[18:10] text of the message up so you won't have
[18:12] these questions
[18:14] after they disappear
[18:16] question number four
[18:19] what power does the enemy have
[18:25] what power does the enemy have
[18:37] and this one number five goes with that
[18:40] and what does he do with it
[18:42] what power does the enemy have
[18:45] and what does he do with it or what does
[18:47] he do with that power
[18:56] all right
[18:59] see people still writing so we'll let
[19:01] you get your last little marks in
[19:04] all right we're going to begin on page
[19:06] one paragraph one
[19:08] and today we'll go to page 14
[19:12] and to the bottom of paragraph 91 it'll
[19:15] be right at
[19:16] just under 45 minutes
[19:19] so brother franco if you could go ahead
[19:21] and
[19:22] bring up the
[19:24] the video the scrolling text
[19:26] and the tape we'll go ahead and also i
[19:28] want to remind you
[19:30] don't forget to respond to the word just
[19:32] because we're playing a tape doesn't
[19:34] mean we have to go silent if something
[19:35] strikes your heart say amen stomp your
[19:38] feet clap your hands raise your hand
[19:40] whatever you normally do when you
[19:41] respond to the word respond to the word
[19:43] because as we listen to this get
[19:45] together it creates an atmosphere and
[19:47] there's a great atmosphere when we come
[19:48] together and as we respond to the word
[19:51] amen it's just as encouragement to the
[19:53] brothers and sisters and we just glean a
[19:55] little deeper as we do this together so
[19:57] don't fail to respond to the word all
[19:59] right god bless you
[20:02] brother franco
[20:04] thank you very much
[20:05] it's really a privilege to have brother
[20:09] branham come so often to phoenix i think
[20:11] he comes to phoenix more than anywhere
[20:13] and we want him to keep coming just as
[20:16] long as i'm around here anyway god bless
[20:18] you
[20:19] thank you brother williams
[20:21] good morning friends
[20:22] i am
[20:24] this uh the shakarian family
[20:27] uh
[20:29] brother williams and sister williams
[20:31] many of them here know about it
[20:33] i saw that in a vision about two three
[20:36] years before she got sick it happened
[20:39] and last year when we were here i
[20:41] believe is in january at the convention
[20:45] is the time that that
[20:47] priest what's his name i forget his name
[20:50] now but sharon
[20:52] stanley bishop stanley from the catholic
[20:55] church remember when he brought me the
[20:57] bible you know
[20:58] and
[20:59] he said to me it was several prophesying
[21:02] my daughter you're healed and he knew at
[21:05] the vision it said that she would not
[21:07] get well she would die between two and
[21:09] three o'clock in the morning remember
[21:11] that
[21:12] so two or three o'clock and i couldn't
[21:14] tell demons
[21:16] and yet i told her stepmother
[21:19] right over in the room right across the
[21:21] place here i said she isn't going to get
[21:24] well mr carrie said well everybody's
[21:26] prophesying i said of course
[21:29] i could be wrong myself but i said it
[21:31] she isn't going to get well i told many
[21:34] of them
[21:35] about three years ago i saw her running
[21:37] for her life
[21:39] and she
[21:40] went into a bed and she raised her hands
[21:43] and screamed to me like that and i i
[21:44] couldn't even reach her and then i seen
[21:47] her die and i looked there's something
[21:49] there's a clock and it said it's
[21:50] something between two and three o'clock
[21:53] and um so
[21:55] the bishop said well i'll just watch and
[21:56] see how that comes to pass
[21:58] so it did come to pass
[22:02] we are certainly sorry
[22:05] i feel the church has lost a great
[22:07] person
[22:08] sister florence to carry him
[22:11] but
[22:12] she was a great singer
[22:14] she was a spirit-filled woman
[22:17] i was with her mother
[22:19] her mother
[22:21] was one of the first
[22:23] contacts i had on the west coast when
[22:26] her mother was healed
[22:28] when the doctor she's in a coma
[22:30] and all swollen up
[22:32] and so then
[22:35] the doctor that was there told me said
[22:37] now be real quiet when you pray don't
[22:39] make much noise woman's dying
[22:41] i said yes sir and said and just kept on
[22:44] telling me
[22:45] well i didn't even have a chance to open
[22:46] my mouth like so his brother demas
[22:50] told me go ahead and go up and see her
[22:52] so i
[22:52] went upstairs in florence was kneeling
[22:54] on the floor then a beautiful little
[22:56] girl
[22:57] and some more women
[22:59] and went over and prayed for her and
[23:01] it's told and she was unconscious and
[23:03] told her she'd get up again and she did
[23:06] a couple years later she died
[23:09] and now
[23:10] god answers our prayers and we know that
[23:12] we believe that we are all
[23:15] have come here by the will of god and we
[23:18] lead the same way
[23:20] one by one will each one cross that
[23:23] portal
[23:24] and that's why we're here this morning
[23:26] together together in this christian
[23:28] businessman's fellowship
[23:30] is to speak of these things and prepare
[23:32] for them because we know
[23:34] they are sure to come
[23:36] ah sister florence is a young woman
[23:40] 42 years old brother
[23:42] williams just told me
[23:44] and very young
[23:46] but
[23:47] before they
[23:49] she knew that she had this disease why
[23:52] i saw a vision of her and told me her
[23:55] outcome then it would be
[23:57] god knows all about it and her seeing
[24:00] jesus in the room before she left
[24:03] we just don't want to pray for her
[24:06] because we've done that so much
[24:09] we just want to thank god
[24:11] for our life that was among us that
[24:13] inspired us all
[24:15] a sister chicarian
[24:16] and we want to pray for brother demas
[24:19] sister rose
[24:21] and remember they've had an awful hard
[24:24] hit in their life in the last there's
[24:26] his father and his sister now in his in
[24:27] the last years
[24:30] and yeah less than
[24:32] less than 10 months

[24:41] demas
[24:42] i had a father
[24:44] brother
[24:45] wife and baby to go within a few days
[24:47] apart
[24:48] so i i know how it feels this morning
[24:51] you only know when you stand in them
[24:53] shoes that's when you know how to
[24:55] sympathize
[24:56] and
[25:00] i did that myself excuse me i hit a
[25:02] little gadget down here somewhere with
[25:04] my hand
[25:05] so i'm i'm sorry i got it too loud
[25:08] and not meaning to
[25:11] so
[25:12] let us stand now while we
[25:14] if you can if it's
[25:20] it's power
[25:26] heavenly father we have a symbol here
[25:29] this morning
[25:30] to worship thee
[25:33] and to give thee thanks and praise for
[25:36] sending jesus our redeemer
[25:39] that we have a hope after this life is
[25:42] over seeing that it's so uncertain
[25:45] that we live here
[25:47] all the time and father to see the
[25:49] wretched conditions these bodies can get
[25:51] into we're glad we don't have to stay
[25:54] here all the time thou has made a way of
[25:57] escape
[25:59] down through the valley of death
[26:02] father
[26:04] we are grateful to you this morning for
[26:06] the life of one who stood with us less
[26:09] than a year ago singing your praises
[26:12] sister florence shakaran as we knew her
[26:15] and thou has told us
[26:18] long before even years
[26:21] that this was going to happen that it
[26:23] wouldn't be too much of a shock for us
[26:26] and we know what you say is true
[26:30] then your word says a man that's born of
[26:32] woman is full of few days and full of
[26:34] troubles we know that's true too lord
[26:37] we know we all must come down through
[26:39] that valley
[26:41] so we thank you for her life that was
[26:43] here on earth believing by faith that
[26:46] now this morning
[26:48] she has passed from this
[26:50] miserable pest house
[26:52] into a glorious body
[26:55] which can never be sick
[26:57] and her talents of singing and the voice
[27:00] she had and their spirit so richly
[27:05] grace with christ
[27:07] that
[27:08] she
[27:10] could return this morning she would not
[27:12] do it by no means
[27:14] she would have to go through all this
[27:16] again which now it's over
[27:18] she's with her mother and her daddy
[27:22] they call their baby home
[27:25] so we
[27:27] we thank you
[27:31] we also want to pray for comfort for our
[27:35] brother chicarian
[27:37] our dear beloved
[27:39] brother
[27:41] knowing the
[27:43] the life that he's lived and the
[27:45] torments he's going through in these
[27:47] last days
[27:49] and how he's
[27:51] seen aging and his hair slipping away
[27:54] and
[27:55] shoulder stooping
[27:56] and yet trying to stay on the field for
[27:59] god
[28:01] god give him strength today
[28:04] we pray god that you'll grant it
[28:07] to all those who have breathed over her
[28:10] going we pray for each one
[28:13] and let us lord as we are thinking of
[28:15] this remember that we too must go
[28:18] someday
[28:19] while we're sitting together here
[28:22] the presence of the lord jesus
[28:24] we would ask that you would bring this
[28:27] fresh to our memory
[28:29] let us check up as it was or take
[28:31] inventory of our own lives
[28:34] that we be
[28:36] under the blood and in the faith
[28:38] granted lord now as i try
[28:42] under these circumstances to bring a
[28:44] little message to the people today i
[28:47] pray that you'll help me lord
[28:50] strengthen me for i i need it lord
[28:54] and i pray that you'll grant it and may
[28:56] something be said that would just
[28:59] honor you
[29:00] if there be any under the sound of our
[29:03] voice this morning who is not
[29:05] ready to meet the hour that lays before
[29:08] them may this be the time that when
[29:10] they'll surrender to him who said i am
[29:15] the way the life the truth
[29:18] even our lord jesus christ for we asked
[29:20] it in his name amen
[29:24] be scenes
[29:41] brother here wants to know if everyone
[29:43] can hear all right he's got two mics on
[29:46] is that all right can you hear raise up
[29:47] your hands if you can
[29:49] can you hear raise your hands
[29:55] i'm sorry that we do not have seating
[29:57] room for everyone this morning
[30:00] and uh
[30:01] we trust that i won't stay up here too
[30:04] long
[30:05] just enough to maybe bring us
[30:09] maybe a reading of the word that the
[30:10] lord god will
[30:12] honor his word that's being read
[30:15] and will give us of his grace that we
[30:17] might serve him by
[30:20] now i was told by billy paul this
[30:23] morning that it might be possible that
[30:25] we speaking next sunday at the grant
[30:28] waste assembly of god in
[30:30] tucson if there's anyone here from
[30:32] tucson i might i get c this week
[30:34] uh be at the grant way assembly of god
[30:37] next sunday
[30:39] so now
[30:40] we just come back from up in the east
[30:42] and i
[30:44] kind of
[30:46] run myself down a little by
[30:48] overeating with over kindness of the
[30:50] people down in the mountains and
[30:52] and um i got sick and so i haven't felt
[30:55] good this week so you're pretty good for
[30:57] me
[30:58] and um why say
[31:02] brother carl williams with his sense of
[31:04] humor and i think we need it right now
[31:06] he said too much possum
[31:10] i don't know about that brother carl but
[31:12] a whole lot of
[31:13] [Laughter]
[31:16] squirrels so you
[31:19] want to pray for someone this morning
[31:21] why
[31:22] i certainly appreciate if it would be
[31:24] some of your prayer for me because
[31:27] i need it
[31:28] now we want to go quickly into the word
[31:31] and i don't want to keep you here too
[31:33] long because i believe there is a
[31:35] telephone hookup
[31:37] across the nation on this this morning
[31:40] goes all the way from the west coast to
[31:42] the east coast from north and south
[31:44] many many assemblies they've got this
[31:46] accommodation that you all had here from
[31:48] the tabernacle it's also hooked up in
[31:50] phoenix
[31:52] that everywhere the services is it comes
[31:54] right in to the and they gather in
[31:57] churches and in homes and things like
[31:58] that through a very fine way they say
[32:02] it's even better than a broadcast it's
[32:04] uh the telephone hookup they put a
[32:07] receiver or
[32:09] a microphone or whatever it is in the
[32:11] room and they my wife said coming from
[32:13] indiana last week down to tucson it's
[32:16] just the same as standing right in the
[32:17] room
[32:18] so
[32:19] we pray that god will bless all those
[32:21] out on the
[32:22] line this morning wherever they are up
[32:24] in new york now it'll be
[32:26] oh in the afternoon
[32:28] and uh different times uh
[32:31] as it crosses the nation now over in the
[32:34] book of romans the 12th chapter
[32:37] and the first and second verses we
[32:40] wish to read this scripture
[32:43] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[32:46] mercies of god that you present your
[32:48] bodies a living sacrifice
[32:51] holy and acceptable to god which is your
[32:55] reasonable service
[32:58] and be
[32:59] not conformed to this world
[33:02] but be
[33:03] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[33:08] that you may prove what is that good and
[33:11] perfect
[33:13] good acceptable and perfect will of god
[33:18] now if the lord willing
[33:20] i want to take it
[33:22] my
[33:23] subject for this morning
[33:25] on
[33:26] god's power to transform
[33:30] that you might not be conformed to this
[33:33] world but be transformed
[33:36] by the renewing of your mind
[33:40] now and prove that which is that good
[33:43] perfect and acceptable will of god it's
[33:46] an old familiar text that
[33:49] many of your pastors has used down
[33:53] through your time it's been used since
[33:55] it was written
[33:56] but yet
[33:57] one thing about the word of god it never
[34:00] grows old
[34:02] because it's god
[34:04] it never grows old through every
[34:06] generation now for
[34:08] prayer near about 2 800 years or better
[34:12] this word of god has been read
[34:15] by man priest so forth and never does it
[34:19] grow old
[34:21] i've been reading it myself for some 35
[34:24] years
[34:25] and each time i read it i find something
[34:27] new that i looked over the first time
[34:30] because it is inspired
[34:33] it is
[34:34] god in the letter form
[34:37] see it's the attributes
[34:39] of god
[34:41] speaking fall forth and is placed on
[34:44] paper
[34:45] many times man said well now man wrote
[34:48] this bible no the bible says itself that
[34:52] god wrote the bible it is the word of
[34:54] god
[34:56] and it
[34:57] it never can fail jesus said heavens and
[35:00] earth will fail pass away but my word
[35:03] shall never fail
[35:05] and it cannot fail in being god because
[35:07] it's part of him
[35:09] and then you being his son and daughter
[35:11] you're a part of it that makes you a
[35:13] part of him so that's why we come to
[35:15] fellowship together around the word of
[35:18] god now this word transform
[35:23] i looked up in the dictionary yesterday
[35:25] when i almost lost track of the time
[35:28] that i was to be up here uh when i was
[35:30] looking at for a text
[35:32] and i found this word or this text
[35:35] rather scripture
[35:37] and
[35:38] in the dictionary it says
[35:40] that it's uh
[35:42] something that's changed
[35:44] is to be changed
[35:47] transformed made different than what it
[35:49] was it's been its character and
[35:52] everything has been changed in it
[35:55] to transform
[35:57] and i
[35:58] thinking this morning in genesis 1
[36:02] this world was without form and it was
[36:06] void
[36:07] darkness is upon the earth nothing but a
[36:11] complete chaos
[36:14] and when this world was in that
[36:16] condition the spirit of god
[36:19] moved upon
[36:21] the face of the water and the
[36:24] entire picture was changed
[36:29] from a total chaos
[36:32] to a garden of eden
[36:35] that's transforming power of god
[36:39] that can take something that's nothing
[36:42] and make something wonderful out of it
[36:46] god's transforming power
[36:50] and we
[36:51] understand that i by reading the
[36:54] scriptures
[36:55] that god was 6 6 000 years
[36:59] and making this preparation for this
[37:02] eden
[37:04] now he might not have been that long but
[37:07] just pursuing and taking it from the
[37:09] scripture where it said one day
[37:12] with god is a thousand years on earth
[37:16] that is that god should count time
[37:19] and uh say it was six thousand years he
[37:21] had in making the earth
[37:24] and
[37:25] he had
[37:27] planted upon the earth all good seed
[37:32] there was just everything was perfect i
[37:34] think many times
[37:36] when even critics begin to read the book
[37:39] of genesis
[37:40] they begin to criticize it because it
[37:42] seems like it constantly repeats itself
[37:46] or throws you out here and there but
[37:48] if we would just notice for a moment
[37:51] before we get into our text
[37:54] that moses
[37:56] saw the vision
[37:58] and god spoke to him
[38:00] god spoke to moses face to face lift to
[38:04] ear
[38:05] now he never spoke to any other man like
[38:07] that as he did moses
[38:09] now moses was a great one of the
[38:12] greatest of all the prophets he was a
[38:14] type of christ
[38:16] and how god can speak
[38:18] he has a voice
[38:20] it's been heard
[38:22] god can speak and god can write
[38:25] god wrote the ten commandments with his
[38:26] own finger he wrote on the walls of of
[38:30] babylon once with his finger he stooped
[38:32] down and wrote in sand one time with his
[38:35] finger god can speak god can read god
[38:39] can write
[38:40] god is
[38:41] the fountain
[38:43] of all
[38:45] uh
[38:46] grace and power
[38:48] and of all
[38:50] divine wisdom is in god
[38:53] so therefore
[38:54] knowing that he is the only creator
[38:58] there is there is no other creator but
[39:00] god
[39:01] satan cannot create it all
[39:03] he only perverts what's been created
[39:06] but
[39:07] god is the only creator
[39:10] therefore
[39:11] he created by his word
[39:14] he sent his word so all the seeds
[39:17] that he had placed upon the earth he
[39:21] farmed those seeds by his own word
[39:24] or there was no nothing else to make the
[39:27] seed out of he placed them and they were
[39:30] beneath the water
[39:32] he just said let there be this and let
[39:35] there be that now we find out
[39:38] that many times it looked like the bible
[39:40] repeating or saying something to what it
[39:42] doesn't say for instance in genesis 1 we
[39:46] find that god created man in his own
[39:50] image
[39:51] in the image of god created he
[39:54] him male and female created he
[39:57] them
[39:58] and then he goes on
[40:00] and many things happen upon the earth
[40:02] then we come to find out there was no
[40:05] man to till the soil then god created
[40:08] man out of the dust of the earth that
[40:11] was a different man
[40:13] and he breathed the spirit of life into
[40:15] him and he became a living soul the
[40:18] first man was in the image of god which
[40:21] is spirit john 4 says god is a spirit
[40:24] and they that worship him must worship
[40:26] him in spirit and in truth but god is a
[40:31] spirit and the first man that he created
[40:34] was spirit man
[40:36] and he was in the image and in the
[40:37] likeness of god
[40:39] and then he put this man in flesh and
[40:42] man fell so then god came down and
[40:45] become in the image of man
[40:48] that he might redeem that fallen man
[40:50] that's the real gospel story to my
[40:53] opinion now god in 6 000 years had
[40:57] planted all these wonderful seeds or he
[40:59] had spoke his word it shall be this way
[41:02] this tree shall be this shall be
[41:05] everything was perfect it was just good
[41:08] and he commanded each one of those seeds
[41:11] that
[41:12] they would be they would transform
[41:14] themselves
[41:15] into the plant of which kind of life
[41:19] that the word of god has spoken in them
[41:22] should be
[41:23] if it was an oak tree it was to bring
[41:25] forth an oath if it was a palm it was to
[41:27] bring forth a palm because a great
[41:30] creator had just sent forth his word
[41:33] and the word seed was there before the
[41:35] real seed was ever formed and the word
[41:38] formed the seed
[41:40] so he made the world out of things that
[41:43] does not appear see
[41:44] he made the world by his word god spoke
[41:47] everything into existence
[41:50] and being
[41:51] god the creator speaking all things into
[41:54] existence it must have been a perfect
[41:58] world it was a
[41:59] beautiful place
[42:01] it was a a real
[42:03] genuine
[42:05] paradise here on the earth
[42:07] now as ever place has to have a
[42:10] headquarters somewhere
[42:13] uh this convention has a headquarters
[42:16] and uh this chapter has a headquarters
[42:20] and a church has a headquarters and god
[42:23] has a headquarters
[42:25] and
[42:26] so
[42:27] this great place nation that we live in
[42:31] it's got a headquarters
[42:33] and so this great
[42:35] eden had a headquarters
[42:38] and this headquarters was headed up
[42:40] in the garden of eden or in eden east of
[42:44] in the garden
[42:46] and god placed over this to rule all his
[42:50] great
[42:51] creation here on earth
[42:53] his son
[42:55] and his son's bride
[42:58] adam and eve god
[43:01] was
[43:02] the father of adam
[43:05] adam was uh the son of god according to
[43:09] the scriptures
[43:10] he was the son of god
[43:13] and god made him a help mate
[43:17] out of his own body
[43:19] perhaps a rib from over his heart so
[43:21] she'd be close to him and made him a
[43:24] helpmate it really wasn't his wife as
[43:28] yet
[43:30] no more than it was
[43:32] man as yet he just spoke it and there's
[43:36] where the trouble come
[43:38] satan her before
[43:41] adam did
[43:43] so
[43:44] it was just his word he had spoken i say
[43:47] that i don't want to spend too much time
[43:49] on it but some of you might get a bit
[43:51] confused
[43:53] some of the people
[43:55] up in the out in the south seem to find
[43:58] this a little confusing on the message
[44:01] that i have from god today to the people
[44:04] that um about the serpent scene
[44:07] and i'm going to
[44:08] go home the lord willing one of these
[44:10] days in jeffersonville i want about a
[44:12] six-hour message and straighten it all
[44:14] out see so to put it just in form and
[44:15] you'll know what we're speaking of and
[44:18] it's thus saith
[44:20] law as it was when you seen
[44:21] just the
[44:23] our sister florence before she went away
[44:26] several years see it's the truth
[44:30] and now
[44:31] we
[44:32] uh maybe it's misunderstood if somebody
[44:35] would come to me something contrary i
[44:37] would kind of misunderstand it myself i
[44:40] wouldn't want to criticize what anyone
[44:41] says we're not to criticize each other
[44:44] i'm not guilty of doing that i thank the
[44:46] lord i've criticized sin and unbelief
[44:48] but no individual persons yeah we're
[44:51] we're brothers and sisters striving
[44:53] we're coming down to where sister
[44:55] florence came uh
[44:57] yesterday mornings and see we we all got
[45:00] to come that way and it's not my purpose
[45:03] to try to
[45:04] criticize a brother or sister they
[45:06] wouldn't agree with you no
[45:07] far be it for me to do that i don't
[45:09] think you'll ever find a tape that i
[45:11] ever call anybody's name on
[45:13] which i felt that many times the person
[45:15] was wrong but that's between them and
[45:17] god but what is wrong in the way of sin
[45:20] and and misunderstanding sometimes it's
[45:23] not even sin it's just misunderstandings
[45:25] of people and i i think each one of us
[45:28] has a right to express herself to our
[45:30] understanding now
[45:32] this great
[45:33] creator had placed his created son now
[45:37] adam was his first created son
[45:41] jesus was his only begotten son
[45:44] he was begotten by a woman but
[45:48] adam was right straight from the hand of
[45:51] god in the creation
[45:53] now
[45:54] the headquarters with his
[45:56] his son and his son's bride overall
[46:00] it looks so perfect
[46:02] there was a a man the head of all of it
[46:06] his own son
[46:07] and his bride
[46:09] and every seed was perfect the palms and
[46:12] the oaks and the grass and the birds and
[46:15] the animals and everything was in
[46:18] perfect order with the commandment of
[46:20] god
[46:21] don't change your nature
[46:26] bring forth of its kind
[46:30] every seed
[46:31] oh don't you never be perverted into
[46:34] a papal tree see palm don't you be
[46:38] perverted into something else
[46:40] but every seed after his time
[46:45] and he
[46:46] it watched it through the times that
[46:48] he'd spoke the word and his great
[46:50] creating power had formed these things
[46:53] that come up and even the man and the
[46:54] woman and they were the head because
[46:57] they were the they were super to all the
[46:59] other races and he put them
[47:02] also under a care of the same thing that
[47:06] he put trees animals and so forth his
[47:10] word
[47:12] they must not never by no means break
[47:15] that word
[47:17] they must stay there don't never
[47:20] take anything from it or add anything to
[47:23] it you must live by this word and as
[47:25] long as that creation would have existed
[47:28] like that
[47:29] sister shakaran wouldn't have had to
[47:31] have went this morning
[47:33] as long as it was stayed like that
[47:36] god's great economy
[47:38] it's what we believe that we're headed
[47:41] back to
[47:43] we're going back to that spot that place
[47:47] where that seventh morning
[47:49] god looked upon it all and he said it's
[47:51] good hallelujah i'm pleased with it
[47:55] i'm glad i did it
[47:58] and it's all now
[48:00] under control
[48:02] and i have trust in my
[48:04] son and his
[48:06] wife that if they'll
[48:08] make them ahead of all of it that
[48:10] they'll watch over it all and see
[48:12] that it's all right that everything will
[48:14] bring forth of its kind now he has the
[48:17] power to do that
[48:19] god then said well if it's all so good
[48:22] and it can't be anything else because
[48:24] it's my own desire
[48:26] it's the way i want it
[48:29] and yeah i spoke it that way and my
[48:31] words has brought it justin exactly the
[48:34] way i wanted it and there it is it's all
[48:36] good so the bible said god rested the
[48:39] seventh day
[48:41] from all his works
[48:43] and
[48:45] everything under control to bring forth
[48:47] of its kind now remember
[48:50] to bring when he put the seed in the
[48:52] earth the seed can only come forth with
[48:56] the power of life within it to transform
[48:59] it from a seed to a plant or whatever it
[49:02] was
[49:03] his transforming
[49:05] power
[49:07] now god
[49:08] put the seed in there
[49:11] with potentials
[49:12] that it would be what he said it would
[49:15] be and as long as it stayed in its right
[49:18] category it would be just exactly what
[49:21] god said it would be it had to be that
[49:23] way because he had made it that way and
[49:25] made a channel
[49:28] that anything that stays in his channel
[49:31] in his line of word
[49:33] it will have to bring forth exactly like
[49:36] his word said it would do
[49:39] it cannot move from there
[49:41] it's channeled just exactly right so
[49:44] with everything and to trust in his own
[49:46] son that it would be that way
[49:49] then god said it's all good so i
[49:52] just rest
[49:54] and each one of those seeds has power in
[49:56] itself to transform itself into the
[50:00] species
[50:01] that i desire to be
[50:04] that's what it must be because i have
[50:06] given every seed
[50:08] transforming power
[50:10] to make out of itself
[50:12] in its potentials now to make out of
[50:15] itself exactly what i wanted to be
[50:19] god has never changed
[50:21] just the same today as he was
[50:24] then god's determined to do something
[50:28] he'll do it
[50:29] nothing's going to stop him he'll do it
[50:32] now after his all so well and set in
[50:35] order god felt assured now that this
[50:38] would all be all right and then when he
[50:40] did then came in the enemy
[50:45] i'm going to
[50:47] god gave power to transform and i'm
[50:50] going to call this fella with power not
[50:54] to
[50:54] to create again but um he had power to
[50:58] deform
[51:00] not transform but to deform
[51:03] not anything deformed
[51:06] is taken from its original
[51:09] state
[51:10] there's something that's gone wrong with
[51:13] it
[51:14] some years ago on patrol going up
[51:17] through the cornfields
[51:19] uh i would think of a
[51:21] there was a limb that brought off of a
[51:23] tree
[51:24] and it fell over on a stalk of corn and
[51:27] the stock was trying its best to get up
[51:31] straight like it was supposed to be
[51:34] but it was deformed
[51:36] because that something had happened
[51:40] and uh
[51:42] the stick was laying over then we find a
[51:45] wild creeper
[51:47] in the field which many you man here
[51:50] maybe some of you women
[51:52] if you come from kentucky the women uses
[51:55] the whole there is same as the man
[51:57] get out in the field with the with the
[52:00] hole we call the old gooseneck hole and
[52:02] chop the the creepers out
[52:05] for if you didn't get those creepers out
[52:08] where the corn was in the roll
[52:11] like this
[52:12] then
[52:13] that creeper would reach over
[52:15] grab a hold of that corn and wrap itself
[52:18] around gradually so easy
[52:21] so slightly that you hardly tell it was
[52:24] wrapping and finally gets stronger and
[52:26] stronger and it pulls that corn till
[52:30] it's
[52:30] deformed pulls it against itself
[52:35] wraps it around its own vine deforming
[52:38] it from what it was to something else
[52:41] yet it's corn
[52:43] but it's
[52:44] deformed upon
[52:46] and we are all still
[52:48] in the image of god
[52:52] but some are so deformed
[52:57] as sons of god
[52:59] that walk contrary to his word into the
[53:02] way that that he had us provided for us
[53:06] to walk
[53:07] setting something the world twist us out
[53:10] of the way
[53:11] pull us close to it and away from that
[53:14] straight
[53:15] narrow strip that he planted us in to be
[53:18] sons and daughters of god
[53:20] sin
[53:22] has done this evil thing
[53:24] to the sons and daughters of god the
[53:28] deformer
[53:29] i know this seems to be
[53:31] rather strange to speak of it in this
[53:34] way the the deform but that's what he
[53:37] was he deformed our perverted
[53:41] pervert needs to be changed over made
[53:44] something different
[53:45] and uh deform is the same thing that
[53:47] it's been brought over and deformed and
[53:49] made in another
[53:51] way yet it's still the same seed but
[53:53] it's dipone
[53:56] now
[53:57] we find that this deformer
[54:01] has also had
[54:03] the same amount of time to deform
[54:08] as god had
[54:10] to transform
[54:13] now he planted his seed or never planted
[54:15] his seed
[54:17] he in the garden of eden
[54:19] since that time he's had six thousand
[54:22] years of deforming
[54:25] the seed of god
[54:27] the word of god to deform it make it
[54:30] something different
[54:32] when he the first time that eve listened
[54:35] to him and
[54:36] got herself just one little phrase
[54:38] remember first satan quoted that
[54:41] scripture just as clear as it could be
[54:42] god has said that ye shall not eat of
[54:46] every tree
[54:48] in the garden of eden see
[54:50] you shall not eat of every tree
[54:52] and uh
[54:54] remember now
[54:56] eve said yes we may eat of every tree
[54:58] but the tree that's in the midst of the
[55:01] garden we mustn't even touch it
[55:05] i watch him in his message twist that
[55:07] word just a little bit
[55:10] and saying
[55:11] he said for god said that if we do this
[55:16] that day we die he said oh surely
[55:19] you'll not die
[55:21] see
[55:22] he was a a man he said you
[55:26] you do this now and you're you're kind
[55:28] of an ignorant people
[55:31] you really you don't know all things
[55:34] but if you would only partake of this
[55:37] then you would have wisdom
[55:40] you'd have knowledge
[55:42] you know right from wrong and be like
[55:44] gods
[55:46] you if you'd only partake of this wisdom
[55:49] that i have i know but you don't but
[55:53] it's all right to have wisdom but if the
[55:56] wisdom is contrary
[55:59] if the wisdom
[56:00] isn't correct wisdom from god
[56:04] divine wisdom and becomes natural wisdom
[56:07] i don't care how much science we have
[56:09] and want more education it's of the
[56:12] devil
[56:14] i'll prove it to you lord willing in a
[56:15] few minutes
[56:17] it's of the devil civilization is of the
[56:20] devil
[56:21] i just got through preaching on that
[56:24] all culture in the earth
[56:26] all
[56:27] the powers of science and everything is
[56:30] of the devil it's his gospel he preached
[56:34] of knowledge in the garden of eden
[56:37] and he's tucked that knowledge
[56:40] perverted knowledge contrary to the word
[56:43] and will and plan of god
[56:45] and now
[56:47] he's had six thousand years
[56:50] to do just exactly
[56:52] what god did only in a perverted way and
[56:56] took the same amount of time to bring
[56:58] his own eden in
[57:01] now he's got an eden here on earth
[57:04] and it's filled with wisdom knowledge
[57:08] that was his gospel at the beginning
[57:12] knowledge
[57:13] wisdom
[57:14] science
[57:16] never did god ever catered as such
[57:19] now i want you to watch a minute
[57:22] he did this
[57:24] and because it he
[57:27] was a man of worldly wisdom
[57:31] now it's hard to see this
[57:34] it's it's very hard because speaking to
[57:38] people who feel the same way i do
[57:40] and the way i have been for many years
[57:44] but since the opening of those seven
[57:46] seals of the angels just behind the
[57:48] mountain
[57:50] this has become a new book
[57:53] it's the things that's been hid
[57:56] as being revealed as god promised in
[58:00] revelations 10 he would do it
[58:02] and we are the privileged people
[58:04] that god has chosen
[58:06] of the earth that we might see and
[58:09] understand these things which is not
[58:12] some mythical
[58:14] fleshly mind of a person trying to make
[58:16] it up it's the word of god
[58:21] made manifest proven
[58:23] that it's right
[58:25] proven not by science but by god that
[58:28] it's right
[58:29] god as i have said before in a message
[58:32] god doesn't need anyone to interpret his
[58:34] word
[58:35] he's his own interpreter he says it'll
[58:37] happen and it happens that's he he
[58:39] confirms it that interprets it a few
[58:42] years ago when we pentecostal people
[58:44] when the
[58:46] other churches told us that we were
[58:48] crazy we could not the holy ghost is a
[58:50] thing pass but
[58:51] we find out that god's promise was to
[58:53] whosoever will
[58:55] and now we know different see that's
[58:57] just little by little this thing has
[58:59] opened up and now he promised that the
[59:02] mysteries that was hidden in those all
[59:04] of those church ages would be revealed
[59:06] right at the end time and it lets us
[59:09] know now we are at the end time
[59:12] we're here now now
[59:14] satan
[59:16] is the author
[59:18] of civilization
[59:21] he is the author of science
[59:24] he is the author of education
[59:27] he says that true all right let us read
[59:30] in god's word now genesis 4 and let's go
[59:33] back and just see for a minute i know i
[59:35] may if i get too long brother carl will
[59:37] probably tell me but uh genesis the
[59:40] fourth chapter in the 16th verse goes
[59:43] head telling here in the beginning what
[59:45] god
[59:46] did in order to place the curse upon the
[59:49] man and the woman and all that they was
[59:51] to do not the curse on them but tell
[59:53] them what would happen to curse the
[59:54] ground for adam's sake
[59:56] and we find out here now that
[59:59] eve
[1:00:00] had a pair of twins
[1:00:02] and one of them was of satan and one of
[1:00:05] them was of god now you say oh no now
[1:00:08] brother just a minute you find me one
[1:00:11] scripture anywhere that says that cain
[1:00:14] was adam's son
[1:00:16] i'll show you in the scripture where it
[1:00:17] says
[1:00:18] cain was of that evil one
[1:00:21] not adam
[1:00:23] now notice when she conceived here we
[1:00:25] begin at the fourth
[1:00:26] chapter first and adam knew his wife and
[1:00:29] she conceived and bear cain and said i
[1:00:32] have gotten she said now i have gotten a
[1:00:34] son from the lord of course there had to
[1:00:35] be no matter if prostitute or anything
[1:00:37] had come from god see because that's his
[1:00:40] seed it's a law of a seed it has to
[1:00:41] bring forth whether it's corrupted seed
[1:00:43] perverted seed or whatever it is it's
[1:00:45] got to bring forth anyhow it's his
[1:00:47] command and she again bear his brother
[1:00:50] abel no more knewing adam knew his wife
[1:00:54] and she barely
[1:00:56] came
[1:00:57] and also bear abel
[1:01:00] twins
[1:01:01] satan was with her that morning adam met
[1:01:03] at you and you see the big fuss in the
[1:01:04] paper here i believe the tucson now that
[1:01:07] woman bringing forth a colored child and
[1:01:09] a white child at the same time she lived
[1:01:11] with her husband that morning and the
[1:01:12] man that afternoon and the man would
[1:01:14] take care of the white man said take
[1:01:16] care of his own child but the colored
[1:01:17] man would have to take care of his own
[1:01:19] see i know that in breeding of dogs and
[1:01:21] so forth it certainly will if it's in a
[1:01:23] few hours afterwards this proves
[1:01:26] now the show where civilization come
[1:01:28] from now let us read genesis over here
[1:01:32] uh uh
[1:01:33] in the fourth chapter of genesis again
[1:01:36] and see where the 16th verse and cain
[1:01:39] went out from the presence of god and
[1:01:41] dwelt in the land of nod
[1:01:44] on the east side of eden and cain knew
[1:01:47] his wife and she conceived and very you
[1:01:49] know
[1:01:50] and he built a city and called the name
[1:01:53] of the city after his son enoch
[1:01:56] civilization started
[1:01:59] amen dr schofield here in my scofield
[1:02:02] bible says the first civilization
[1:02:05] notice then he begot sons and they made
[1:02:08] organs and music the next one begot sons
[1:02:11] and he began to do other things wonders
[1:02:14] build cities and and make uh
[1:02:17] instruments of brass and all kinds of
[1:02:19] things see that's what he did become the
[1:02:22] first civilization which was canaanite
[1:02:29] he's
[1:02:30] done the same thing down to the ages
[1:02:34] now
[1:02:35] let's get there with the 25th verse and
[1:02:37] watch what the next was
[1:02:39] and adam knew his wife again
[1:02:43] now and she bear a son
[1:02:46] and call his name saith for god said she
[1:02:49] has appointed
[1:02:51] me another seed instead of abel who came
[1:02:54] through
[1:02:55] and saith and to say it to him also
[1:02:58] there was born a son and he called his
[1:03:01] name enos and then
[1:03:03] began man to call upon the name of the
[1:03:05] lord
[1:03:06] out of the south side
[1:03:08] not the canaanite side
[1:03:10] see
[1:03:11] that great intellectual
[1:03:14] that we all so hold to
[1:03:18] what's communism today
[1:03:20] what's their god
[1:03:22] it's the intellectual science
[1:03:27] what are we doing anyhow
[1:03:30] why are we living
[1:03:33] consider these words today
[1:03:36] now
[1:03:37] he
[1:03:38] has his kind of an eden
[1:03:41] satan does now and these six thousand
[1:03:44] years
[1:03:45] he has
[1:03:46] farmed not created but deformed
[1:03:51] god's whole earth
[1:03:54] is creatures
[1:03:56] the animals
[1:03:58] interbreeding high breeding
[1:04:00] trees plants human even to religion
[1:04:05] the bible church
[1:04:07] until he's got himself
[1:04:09] a complete
[1:04:11] garden of eden of science
[1:04:15] everything moving by science
[1:04:19] automobiles
[1:04:21] everything that we have was given to us
[1:04:24] by science
[1:04:25] what man has done
[1:04:28] and he's got his great
[1:04:30] eden here
[1:04:31] to prove the message is timely
[1:04:35] to prove that it's not some other age
[1:04:38] but revelations 10.
[1:04:40] look at the high breeding today
[1:04:43] to make a better or prettier not a
[1:04:46] better
[1:04:47] look a little children today
[1:04:50] now i tell you
[1:04:52] as we listen to the first part of that
[1:04:53] brother branham he's laying out his
[1:04:55] scriptures he's laying out
[1:04:56] as he's going into the subject but he
[1:04:59] preached so much doctrine right there in
[1:05:01] those few pages we read if you if you
[1:05:04] catch what brother i'm saying we have
[1:05:06] because we've been looking at this he
[1:05:08] explained the entire problem
[1:05:12] in just
[1:05:13] i mean the first few minutes there he
[1:05:15] was giving a testimony and we left that
[1:05:17] on there you know a lot of times we'll
[1:05:18] cut into a message after we get through
[1:05:20] some of those comments but he'll he he
[1:05:22] refers back to that so i left that in
[1:05:24] there but
[1:05:25] but here in about 30 minutes he lays out
[1:05:28] the entire problem he explained what
[1:05:30] when what was started how it was started
[1:05:32] right how it went wrong and where we're
[1:05:34] at today all in 30 minutes and he
[1:05:36] preached so much doctrine laying in
[1:05:38] there every line had so much meat into
[1:05:41] it
[1:05:41] but we're going to go through our
[1:05:43] questions now and just pull out some of
[1:05:44] these things as we move on
[1:05:47] the first question i asked was what is
[1:05:50] the bible
[1:05:51] and so if we'll go with me to
[1:05:53] paragraph 36
[1:05:59] sorry 30 no
[1:06:01] 34.
[1:06:05] it said many times man said well now man
[1:06:07] wrote the bible no the bible says itself
[1:06:09] that god wrote the bible it's the word
[1:06:11] of god so the bible is the word of god
[1:06:14] and then i want to go up to paragraph 33
[1:06:16] and get some more details it's an old
[1:06:18] familiar text that many of your pastors
[1:06:20] have used down through your time it's
[1:06:22] been used since it was written but yet
[1:06:24] one thing about the word of god it never
[1:06:26] grows old because it's god
[1:06:30] the word of god is god
[1:06:33] amen
[1:06:34] and and it's just so important because
[1:06:36] what brother brown was going to get into
[1:06:38] is the word of god established
[1:06:39] everything but it was the perversion or
[1:06:41] the leaving word of god that brought
[1:06:43] leaving the word of god brought death to
[1:06:45] everything because god is life his word
[1:06:48] is life and light
[1:06:49] because god
[1:06:50] let's read that again
[1:06:52] it never grows old because it's god it
[1:06:54] never grows old though every generation
[1:06:56] now for pretty near about 2 800 years or
[1:06:59] better this word of god has been read by
[1:07:01] men priests and so forth and never does
[1:07:03] it grow old i've been reading it myself
[1:07:05] for some 35 years and each time i read
[1:07:08] it i find something new that i looked
[1:07:10] over the first time because it's
[1:07:11] inspired it's god in letter form
[1:07:15] that's what our bible is god in letter
[1:07:17] form
[1:07:18] and it's the attributes of god speaking
[1:07:21] forth and it's placed on paper
[1:07:24] amen that's why brother branham brought
[1:07:26] everything back to the bible
[1:07:29] we already read verse 34 many times man
[1:07:31] said well now man wrote this bible no
[1:07:34] the bible says itself that god wrote the
[1:07:36] bible it's the word of god
[1:07:38] paragraph 35 and it never can fail see
[1:07:41] heavens and earth will fail pass away
[1:07:43] but my word shall never fail and it
[1:07:45] cannot fail being god because it's part
[1:07:48] of him
[1:07:50] paragraph 36 and then you being a son
[1:07:53] and daughter you are part of it and that
[1:07:56] makes you part of him
[1:07:59] so that's why we can come fellowship
[1:08:00] together around the word because we are
[1:08:03] part of the word amen
[1:08:05] this bible is god amen in written form
[1:08:09] in it's the word of god amen which is
[1:08:13] god
[1:08:14] now it's god in written form and now if
[1:08:17] you're part of god then you're in the
[1:08:19] bible
[1:08:21] and you're part of him you're part of
[1:08:23] this word and it all ties together amen
[1:08:27] i love the way brother bram says that
[1:08:28] matter of fact i mean there's no there's
[1:08:30] no wiggle room he just says it he says
[1:08:31] it so many times he said it and we get
[1:08:34] used to hearing it but when you really
[1:08:36] catch what he's saying and what it means
[1:08:38] for you personally he brought you right
[1:08:39] into this
[1:08:41] as part of that amen so it's very
[1:08:44] profound what he's saying and it's
[1:08:46] actually very astonishing what he's
[1:08:48] saying and i wonder how many people
[1:08:50] there that day actually agreed with what
[1:08:52] he was saying
[1:08:53] they were probably nodding their head
[1:08:54] and saying amen but do you really
[1:08:56] do we really understand what he's saying
[1:08:59] all right the next question what does
[1:09:01] the word transform mean let's look
[1:09:04] together at paragraph 37
[1:09:06] now this word transformed i looked it up
[1:09:08] in the dictionary yesterday when i i
[1:09:11] almost lost track of the time that i was
[1:09:12] to be here when i was looking for a text
[1:09:15] i found this word or this text brother
[1:09:16] scripture and then the dictionary says
[1:09:19] that it's something that's changed it's
[1:09:21] to be changed transformed made different
[1:09:23] than what it is
[1:09:24] it's been its character and everything
[1:09:26] has been changed in it to transform
[1:09:30] let's look at paragraph 38
[1:09:32] and i think this morning in genesis 1
[1:09:35] this world was without form and was void
[1:09:37] and darkness was upon the earth nothing
[1:09:39] but a complete chaos
[1:09:42] and when this world was in that
[1:09:44] condition the spirit of god moved upon
[1:09:46] the face of the water and the entire
[1:09:48] picture was changed from total chaos to
[1:09:51] a garden of eden that is transforming
[1:09:54] power of god that can take something
[1:09:56] that's nothing and make something
[1:09:58] wonderful out of it god's transforming
[1:10:00] power so brother venom is pointing back
[1:10:03] to creation to show god's transforming
[1:10:05] power that when you look in genesis 1 2
[1:10:08] amen it was total chaos water covered
[1:10:11] the face of the deep you couldn't see
[1:10:13] anything that was in the mind of god you
[1:10:16] couldn't and brother banham tells us
[1:10:18] that under the water there were seeds
[1:10:20] amen and those seeds were first formed
[1:10:22] by the word of god before they came into
[1:10:24] a natural form so the natural form
[1:10:27] contained the word of god
[1:10:29] all right
[1:10:30] so the word of god was lacked locked in
[1:10:33] the natural form of that seed and that
[1:10:35] seed was down below the water amen and
[1:10:38] so it was going to take something to
[1:10:40] take this chaos and transform this chaos
[1:10:43] into a beautiful eden it was going to
[1:10:46] take god's power of transformation and
[1:10:48] that's what brother ben was speaking
[1:10:50] about through this whole message that
[1:10:51] it's going to take god's power of
[1:10:53] transformation so what brought the
[1:10:55] transformation amen the spirit of god
[1:10:58] begin to move on the waters because the
[1:11:00] spirit now is going to come upon the
[1:11:01] word and bring the word into effect and
[1:11:04] bring the word to life and as it begins
[1:11:07] to bring the word of life it begins to
[1:11:09] quicken the seed that's there and
[1:11:11] there's a word in the seed and when the
[1:11:14] word and the seed comes to manifestation
[1:11:17] it's the power of transformation is
[1:11:19] already in the seed
[1:11:22] amen the reason brother ben's teaching
[1:11:24] this is so that you and i will
[1:11:25] understand what's in us
[1:11:28] so the spirit of god moved amen to bring
[1:11:30] the conditions right so that the light
[1:11:32] will strike the seed so it will quicken
[1:11:34] what's in the seed so that seed and the
[1:11:36] natural will produce what the word spoke
[1:11:39] of it was spoken to be in the beginning
[1:11:41] and now as it begins to produce and
[1:11:43] begins to produce as the spirit broods
[1:11:45] over and it brings the spoken word of
[1:11:47] god into manifestation this whole world
[1:11:49] was transformed from total chaos
[1:11:53] to a garden of eden by the spoken word
[1:11:56] that was trapped in the seed and the
[1:11:58] spirit of god brooding over that
[1:12:00] bringing it into a beautiful
[1:12:02] transformation
[1:12:06] our lives were chaos
[1:12:09] but the spirit of god brooded over us
[1:12:12] brought the word to us and the word came
[1:12:14] to the word that was in us and we didn't
[1:12:16] just all of a sudden become a man a
[1:12:18] magnificent creature or a son or
[1:12:20] daughter of god amen we were already
[1:12:23] spoken sons and daughters of god it was
[1:12:25] already god's word and that word was
[1:12:27] placed into us as a seed and it was
[1:12:29] laying there when you saw the seed you
[1:12:31] didn't see necessarily the palm tree you
[1:12:33] saw the seed amen but when the spirit of
[1:12:35] god moved over it it took what was
[1:12:37] already in the seed and brought it to
[1:12:39] the manifestation of god's thought
[1:12:42] and that's what god is doing with you
[1:12:44] and i in this day
[1:12:47] that's the heart of this message
[1:12:50] amen let's go to the fourth question
[1:12:56] i'm sorry third question thank you
[1:12:58] what is the channel that every seed must
[1:13:01] stay in
[1:13:02] let's go to paragraph 64
[1:13:04] together
[1:13:05] on page 9.
[1:13:12] in everything under control to bring
[1:13:15] forth of its kind now remember to bring
[1:13:17] when he put the seed in the earth the
[1:13:19] seed can only come forth with the power
[1:13:21] of life within it
[1:13:24] to transform it from a seed to a plant
[1:13:26] or whatever it was his transforming
[1:13:29] power now god put the seed in there with
[1:13:31] potentials that it would be what he said
[1:13:33] it would be and as long as it stayed in
[1:13:36] its right category it would be just
[1:13:38] exactly what god said it would be it had
[1:13:41] to be that way because he had made it
[1:13:43] that way and made a channel that
[1:13:45] anything that stays in his channel in
[1:13:48] his line of word that's the channel in
[1:13:50] his line of word it will have to bring
[1:13:53] forth exactly like his word said it
[1:13:55] would do it cannot move from that it's
[1:13:58] channeled just exactly right so with
[1:14:00] everything in the trust he had in his
[1:14:03] own son that it would be that way then
[1:14:05] god said it's all good so all just rest
[1:14:08] and each one of those seeds has power in
[1:14:11] itself to transform itself into the
[1:14:14] species that i desire it to be that's
[1:14:16] what it must be because i've given every
[1:14:19] seed transforming power to make out of
[1:14:22] itself in its potentials now to make out
[1:14:24] of itself exactly what i want it to be
[1:14:28] god has never changed just the same
[1:14:30] today as he was then
[1:14:33] so i i want to catch this
[1:14:36] really catch it and drive it home
[1:14:39] that last sentence in paragraph 64 on
[1:14:42] page 9
[1:14:43] and each one of those seeds has power in
[1:14:45] itself
[1:14:47] to transform itself into the specie
[1:14:50] that i desire to be
[1:14:52] because the seed that's in us
[1:14:55] has part of god on the inside
[1:14:58] as the life of god it's part of the word
[1:15:00] of god which is part of the thought of
[1:15:01] god of what god wanted that seed to be
[1:15:04] and what he wanted that seed in you to
[1:15:06] express amen and if the spirit of god
[1:15:08] will move over that seed and quicken it
[1:15:10] the life it'll begin to grow and as it
[1:15:12] begins to grow in you it begins to
[1:15:15] transform amen from a fallen creature
[1:15:18] into a redeemed son of god and it's
[1:15:20] moving into the likeness of christ to
[1:15:22] the thought that god had of you before
[1:15:25] the foundation of the world to express a
[1:15:27] certain part of the thought of god and
[1:15:29] the only thing that you have to do amen
[1:15:32] is trust amen in the word of god that's
[1:15:35] given to us and what god put inside of
[1:15:38] you because it's part of himself to be
[1:15:40] expressed in this day and there's a
[1:15:42] power there to express exactly what god
[1:15:45] wanted before the foundation of the
[1:15:46] world but we have to stay in the channel
[1:15:48] of the word
[1:15:50] and if we stay in the channel of the
[1:15:52] word
[1:15:53] god has already put it down inside of
[1:15:56] you to manifest all that he wants you to
[1:15:58] manifest it's not about running around
[1:16:00] and trying to produce something and i
[1:16:02] should be this and i should do that and
[1:16:04] i should manifest this gift and i should
[1:16:05] manifest that gift whatever you're going
[1:16:07] to manifest he already put inside of you
[1:16:09] before the foundation of the world
[1:16:11] there's a portion that's you a portion
[1:16:14] of the seed of the life
[1:16:17] if he spoke palm tree a palm tree would
[1:16:19] be a palm tree if he spoke oh it would
[1:16:21] be an oak it would manifest what that
[1:16:23] thought was and whatever god once
[1:16:25] manifest in your life he has already put
[1:16:27] inside of you amen so it's not about us
[1:16:30] trying to manifest something about
[1:16:32] something it's about staying in the
[1:16:34] channel of the word and having faith
[1:16:36] that whatever he put in me if i stay in
[1:16:38] the channel of the world it'll come to
[1:16:40] life amen because it's god it's the
[1:16:42] power of transformation
[1:16:45] where is that power in the seed
[1:16:48] it's already in you so we don't have to
[1:16:50] worry about becoming something stay in
[1:16:52] the channel of the word it'll happen
[1:16:55] stay in line with this word that's been
[1:16:56] restored amen it's stripped away the
[1:16:59] perversion to bring us back in line if
[1:17:01] we stay in line with the word it will
[1:17:03] produce this seed will produce what he
[1:17:06] predestinated for it to produce in this
[1:17:08] age and you don't have to worry about it
[1:17:10] manufacture it produce it stay in the
[1:17:12] channel of the word the life that's
[1:17:14] already in there will come out under the
[1:17:16] anointing of the holy ghost and channel
[1:17:18] with the true word and you will be all
[1:17:19] that he called you to be
[1:17:23] amen
[1:17:25] that way we're not chasing after things
[1:17:27] that are not even for us
[1:17:30] let's go back and i want to read two
[1:17:32] more places here
[1:17:34] let's go back to paragraph 61 on page 9.
[1:17:38] the channel is the line of the word and
[1:17:40] he said here in paragraph 61 on page 9
[1:17:43] and he had spoke the word and his great
[1:17:45] creating power had formed these things
[1:17:48] that come up and even the man and the
[1:17:49] woman and they were the head because
[1:17:51] they were super to all other races and
[1:17:54] he put them also under a care of the
[1:17:57] same thing that he put trees animals and
[1:18:00] so forth his word
[1:18:01] they must never by no means break that
[1:18:04] word
[1:18:05] they must stay there don't ever take
[1:18:07] away from it or add anything to it you
[1:18:09] must live by the word paragraph 62 and
[1:18:12] as long as they create
[1:18:14] that creation would have existed like
[1:18:16] that sister chicarian wouldn't have had
[1:18:18] to have went this morning
[1:18:20] as long as it would have stayed like
[1:18:22] them god's great economy is what we
[1:18:25] believe that we are heading back to we
[1:18:27] are going back to that spot to that
[1:18:30] place
[1:18:31] we are going back
[1:18:33] to the channel of god's word coming back
[1:18:35] in perfect line to bring us all the way
[1:18:37] back to eden
[1:18:40] amen and listen
[1:18:43] the power of transformation is already
[1:18:44] in the seed
[1:18:46] the power to be translated in your atoms
[1:18:49] to be changed is already in the seed
[1:18:50] just stay in the channel of the word
[1:18:52] we don't have to work anything up pump
[1:18:54] anything up pull anything down just stay
[1:18:56] in the channel of the word it'll produce
[1:18:57] everything that it's supposed to produce
[1:19:01] amen all right question number four
[1:19:04] what power does the enemy have
[1:19:07] let's go to paragraph 66
[1:19:11] on page 10.
[1:19:14] paragraph 66 on page 10. now after it's
[1:19:17] all so well and set in order god felt
[1:19:19] sure now that this would all be all
[1:19:22] right and then when he did then came the
[1:19:24] enemy
[1:19:25] i'm going to god gave power to transform
[1:19:28] and i'm going to call this fellow with
[1:19:30] power not to create again but he had
[1:19:32] power to deform not transform but to
[1:19:35] deform now anything deformed is taken
[1:19:38] from its original state there is
[1:19:40] something that's gone wrong with it so
[1:19:42] he had the power to deform that's that's
[1:19:45] what satan did the devil he had power to
[1:19:47] deform let's go down to paragraph 70 at
[1:19:50] the bottom here
[1:19:54] the deformer i know this seems to be
[1:19:56] rather strange to speak of it in this
[1:19:58] way to deform but that's what he was he
[1:20:00] deformed or perverted
[1:20:02] pervert means to be changed over made
[1:20:04] something different and deform is the
[1:20:06] same thing it's been brought over and
[1:20:09] deformed and made in another way yet
[1:20:11] it's still the same seed but it's
[1:20:13] deformed
[1:20:15] now let's go back and look at
[1:20:17] paragraph 43
[1:20:24] 43 and god is the fountain of all grace
[1:20:26] and power
[1:20:28] and of all divine wisdom is in god so
[1:20:30] therefore knowing that he is the only
[1:20:34] creator there is there is no other
[1:20:36] creator but god satan cannot create it
[1:20:38] all he only perverts what's been created
[1:20:41] but god is the only creator
[1:20:44] so because satan
[1:20:47] because satan has his own agenda he has
[1:20:49] his own plan
[1:20:50] satan cannot create any material to work
[1:20:53] with
[1:20:54] so he can only take the material that
[1:20:57] god created and deform it or pervert it
[1:20:59] into another purpose amen and when he
[1:21:02] can get when he could get the children
[1:21:04] of god to leave the channel of the word
[1:21:06] all of a sudden they became deformed and
[1:21:08] all creation became deformed and that
[1:21:10] was his power because he can't create or
[1:21:12] make anything he can only take what god
[1:21:15] made and deform it he can't bring his
[1:21:17] own word he takes god's word and he
[1:21:18] deforms it
[1:21:20] he can't bring his own creation he takes
[1:21:22] god's creation and deforms it so he
[1:21:23] perverts or deforms so that is his job
[1:21:26] that is his power to deform so satan
[1:21:29] loses all of his power when we refuse to
[1:21:32] leave the word
[1:21:34] he the only power he has is the power to
[1:21:37] deform he cannot create amen he cannot
[1:21:41] he cannot overpower god's word god could
[1:21:44] satan could never come in the garden of
[1:21:46] eden and overpower god's word he could
[1:21:48] only get god's children to leave the
[1:21:51] word or deviate from the word and that's
[1:21:53] how he expressed his power to deform but
[1:21:56] satan could not do that they had to do
[1:21:59] that
[1:22:00] he influenced them he deceived them he
[1:22:03] tricked them but they're the ones who
[1:22:04] had to leave the word so so satan is not
[1:22:07] going to come in amen to us and all of a
[1:22:09] sudden twist us into knots and deform us
[1:22:12] we will do that of our own choice if
[1:22:13] we're deceived into leaving the channel
[1:22:15] of the word then we become perverted
[1:22:19] or deformed
[1:22:21] so what is the solution where is our
[1:22:23] safety amen what will keep us
[1:22:25] the line of the word
[1:22:27] the channel of the word that's why it's
[1:22:28] so important that the word was restored
[1:22:30] to us in this day
[1:22:33] taking his power away to deform the
[1:22:35] bride to deform the church
[1:22:37] the next question question five and what
[1:22:39] does he do with it what does he do with
[1:22:41] the power to deform let's look at
[1:22:43] paragraph 71 at the top of page 11.
[1:22:50] paragraph 71
[1:22:52] now we find that this deformer has
[1:22:55] always had the same amount of time to
[1:22:57] deform has also had the same amount of
[1:22:59] time to deform as god had to transform
[1:23:02] now he planted his seed or he never
[1:23:04] planted his seed in the garden of eden
[1:23:06] since that time he has had six thousand
[1:23:08] years of deforming the seed of god and
[1:23:10] the word of god to deform it make it
[1:23:12] something different from the first time
[1:23:14] that eve listened to him and got herself
[1:23:16] just one little phrase
[1:23:18] let's go to paragraph 76 now
[1:23:23] civilization is of the devil
[1:23:25] it's just got i just got through
[1:23:26] preaching on that all culture and the
[1:23:28] earth all powers of science and
[1:23:30] everything is of the devil it's his
[1:23:32] gospel he preached of knowledge in the
[1:23:34] garden of eden and he has took that
[1:23:36] knowledge perverted knowledge contrary
[1:23:38] to the word and will and plan of god and
[1:23:41] now he has had 6 000 years to do just
[1:23:43] exactly what god did only in a perverted
[1:23:46] way and took the same amount of time to
[1:23:49] bring his own eden in now he has got an
[1:23:52] eden here on earth and it's filled with
[1:23:55] wisdom knowledge that was his gospel at
[1:23:57] the beginning knowledge wisdom science
[1:24:00] never did god ever cater to such and i
[1:24:02] want you to watch a minute he did this
[1:24:04] and because that he was a man of worldly
[1:24:07] wisdom
[1:24:08] so what has he done
[1:24:10] he's taken god took 6 000 years to
[1:24:13] transform by the power of transformation
[1:24:16] a chaos into a garden of eden
[1:24:19] and satan has taken six thousand years
[1:24:21] to deform
[1:24:23] from the garden of eden and to his eden
[1:24:26] satan's eden
[1:24:27] which i would say is another chaos
[1:24:31] let's go to paragraph 91
[1:24:39] now he has his kind of eden satan does
[1:24:41] now
[1:24:42] and in these six thousand years he has
[1:24:44] formed not created but deformed god's
[1:24:46] whole earth his creatures the animals
[1:24:49] interbreeding hybriding trees plants
[1:24:51] human even to religion the bible church
[1:24:54] until he has got himself a complete
[1:24:56] garden of eden of science everything
[1:24:59] moving by science our automobiles
[1:25:01] everything that we have we've given to
[1:25:03] us by science what man has done and he
[1:25:06] has got his great eden here to prove the
[1:25:09] message is timely
[1:25:12] to prove that it's not some other age
[1:25:15] but revelation 10.
[1:25:19] god is the one who puts the parameters
[1:25:21] on time
[1:25:23] god is the one who took six thousand
[1:25:25] years for the power of transformation to
[1:25:28] bring a garden of eden and god has
[1:25:31] allowed another six thousand years to
[1:25:33] transpire and in that six thousand years
[1:25:36] satan under the power of deforming the
[1:25:39] power to deform has made his own eden
[1:25:42] but brother banham said he's done that
[1:25:44] to prove
[1:25:47] he has got his great eaten here to prove
[1:25:50] the message is timely to prove that it's
[1:25:53] not some other age but revelation 10.
[1:25:56] god has given a space of time for for uh
[1:25:59] satan to come to the fullness of his
[1:26:02] plan to the fullness of creating his
[1:26:04] eden amen and at that fullness it's only
[1:26:07] going to declare how true the word of
[1:26:09] god is amen it's only going to declare
[1:26:11] that it's time for revelation 10.
[1:26:13] nothing's out of kilter nothing's beyond
[1:26:16] god's plan he's had 6 thousand years of
[1:26:19] deform but god knew all along he was
[1:26:20] going gonna have six thousand years he's
[1:26:22] had six thousand years to move people
[1:26:24] away from the word of god and twist it
[1:26:26] and deform it and deform society to form
[1:26:29] culture deform everything until he has
[1:26:32] his perfect eden and that's just what
[1:26:34] god was going to give him space of time
[1:26:36] to do so that in satan's eden god can
[1:26:39] come along and strike the final death
[1:26:41] blow to bring us back to the word to
[1:26:43] reverse everything that he's been
[1:26:45] working for 6 thousand years to create
[1:26:49] it's just proving god
[1:26:51] so there's nothing to worry about
[1:26:54] now i just want to make one more note
[1:26:55] that was our last question but one more
[1:26:56] note in paragraph 79
[1:27:02] he says now
[1:27:06] and now he promised that the mysteries
[1:27:08] that was hid in those all those church
[1:27:10] ages would be revealed right at the end
[1:27:13] time
[1:27:14] and he lets us kno he lets us know now
[1:27:17] we are at the end time
[1:27:20] we're here now
[1:27:23] that was 1965.
[1:27:26] he says this signifies that we're at the
[1:27:29] end time that's when he would reveal and
[1:27:31] satan's eating he would reveal all the
[1:27:33] mysteries it marks the end time where at
[1:27:35] the end time we're here now
[1:27:39] and i would say
[1:27:41] we must be at the end of the end time
[1:27:45] that marked the end time
[1:27:47] my brothers and sisters we must be at
[1:27:48] the end
[1:27:49] of the end time
[1:27:51] amen god bless you let's all stand
[1:27:53] together
[1:27:56] musicians if you can make your way up
[1:28:04] all right
[1:28:05] i just wanted to
[1:28:08] remind everybody of the new books that
[1:28:10] came in on the book rack and all the
[1:28:11] books that are in the library
[1:28:13] one of the things that i really
[1:28:15] desired in getting these books and
[1:28:16] keeping them in inventory
[1:28:18] is that everybody who wants can have a
[1:28:20] library of their own
[1:28:22] every child in the church everybody if
[1:28:25] you're
[1:28:26] if you're a child and you're growing up
[1:28:27] and you have an interest in the books
[1:28:29] you're 10 11 12 8 9 10. it doesn't
[1:28:31] matter if you want the bookstore out
[1:28:33] there and like i love going into my
[1:28:35] children's room and i see all their
[1:28:36] books lined up and they all have their
[1:28:38] own library
[1:28:40] of of the message
[1:28:42] you know i know we have all kinds of
[1:28:43] electronic devices we have it on cell
[1:28:45] phones and we have it on tablets and we
[1:28:48] have it on that but you can grab your
[1:28:49] cell phone and you can get distracted
[1:28:51] from reading the message and do all
[1:28:52] kinds of other stuff you can be reading
[1:28:54] the message and your buzzer could go off
[1:28:56] and you go off to your message or to a
[1:28:58] text and read that but when you pick up
[1:29:00] a book and sit down this is the only
[1:29:02] thing you're doing with this book is
[1:29:04] reading the message so you don't have to
[1:29:06] get the message from books i'm not
[1:29:07] saying that but for me i really like
[1:29:09] taking a book
[1:29:11] taking my pocket full of highlighters
[1:29:15] and sitting down and going through that
[1:29:17] book and so i just want everybody who
[1:29:19] wants one to have a chance to have your
[1:29:21] own library
[1:29:22] every child every teenager everybody you
[1:29:25] can have your own book library and we're
[1:29:27] going to order more books we've been
[1:29:28] ordering once a year but i think i'm
[1:29:30] going to step that up because i know
[1:29:32] that the books will eventually be
[1:29:33] depleted so i'm going to start trying
[1:29:35] maybe twice a year to get new books in
[1:29:37] so we'll let you know when they come in
[1:29:39] but right now every child in this church
[1:29:42] can have an exposition of the seven
[1:29:44] church ages
[1:29:45] can have the seven seals and have 40
[1:29:48] individual booklets
[1:29:50] if power goes out for 72 hours you still
[1:29:52] have the word
[1:29:54] you can't recharge your device
[1:29:57] but there's no excuse you still have the
[1:29:58] word amen
[1:30:00] and so you never know with the way the
[1:30:02] world goes and all the crises that are
[1:30:04] around you have no idea that the power
[1:30:07] is going to stay on indefinitely
[1:30:10] but you can always go over to your
[1:30:11] bookshelf and pull off a book
[1:30:13] and open it up and say i'm not going to
[1:30:17] text message right now i'm not going to
[1:30:19] answer an email i'm not going to call
[1:30:21] mom or dad or aunt this or uncle that
[1:30:24] i'm going to sit down with this book
[1:30:26] and i'm going to receive what god gave
[1:30:28] me in this age from this book
[1:30:30] so that's part of the reason that we've
[1:30:32] done what we've done over the years is
[1:30:34] so everybody can have their own library
[1:30:36] so take advantage of it it's there
[1:30:39] don't take it for granted
[1:30:40] i love
[1:30:42] seeing
[1:30:43] young people
[1:30:44] read the message
[1:30:46] i love it i love seeing them with the
[1:30:48] message book i love looking over the
[1:30:50] shoulder and seeing little marks in the
[1:30:52] book
[1:30:53] it does something it thrills in my soul
[1:30:55] because if you can learn to feed from
[1:30:57] what god gave us in this day amen coming
[1:31:00] to church will mean so much more
[1:31:03] sunday and wednesday is not enough word
[1:31:05] to survive on in satan's eden
[1:31:08] we need the word on a daily basis
[1:31:10] and god's given us such a rich treasure
[1:31:13] of the word amen if you if you get into
[1:31:16] those books and get into those tapes i
[1:31:19] promise you sunday and wednesday will
[1:31:20] get more exciting and more exciting and
[1:31:23] more exciting
[1:31:24] amen god bless you let's bow our heads
[1:31:26] and pray
[1:31:27] lord jesus we thank you lord for this
[1:31:30] wonderful word that you've given us
[1:31:32] god help us never to take it for granted
[1:31:34] but we always enjoy
[1:31:37] that when you chose to speak to us in
[1:31:39] this generation you chose that voice
[1:31:42] and god i can never get away from that
[1:31:44] voice and what it means to me lord
[1:31:47] but i thank you for the message that
[1:31:48] you've given us
[1:31:50] but more than that i thank you for eyes
[1:31:52] to see and ears to hear
[1:31:54] for if you had not lord
[1:31:57] quickened us with a
[1:31:59] to life by the power of your spirit if
[1:32:01] you've not planted a seed of
[1:32:02] predestination within us we would never
[1:32:04] understand what this message was we
[1:32:06] would never be able to receive it
[1:32:09] so lord i thank you for the ability to
[1:32:11] receive it
[1:32:13] i pray god that you would make it more
[1:32:15] real day by day
[1:32:17] that would come into greater
[1:32:18] manifestation in our life and father
[1:32:20] help us to stay in the channel of this
[1:32:22] word that you've restored
[1:32:24] so that your power
[1:32:26] of transformation that's within the seed
[1:32:29] can go through the growth process and
[1:32:31] reproduce exactly what you spoke what
[1:32:33] was in your mind from before the
[1:32:35] foundation of the world
[1:32:37] may our lives lord under the brooding of
[1:32:40] your holy spirit may our lives move lord
[1:32:42] from chaos
[1:32:44] into a beautiful garden that you can
[1:32:46] come and visit us in
[1:32:48] or may it happen by the life that's in
[1:32:51] the seed and by the brooding of your
[1:32:53] spirit
[1:32:54] father i ask that you touch each one of
[1:32:56] us as we go our separate ways bless us
[1:32:58] lord we love you and we thank you for
[1:33:01] this word

[1:33:04] always for what you have given to us in
[1:33:05] this generation
[1:33:07] you've given us a power
[1:33:09] to break satan's eden
[1:33:11] a power to break free from the deforming
[1:33:14] power of satan you've given us a power
[1:33:17] lord you've planted it deep within us
[1:33:19] you've brooded your spirit over us to
[1:33:21] quicken us and you've given us the
[1:33:22] channel of your word to stay in that
[1:33:24] will bring every promise to pass
[1:33:27] we love you father
[1:33:28] bless your people we pray
[1:33:30] in jesus christ's name
