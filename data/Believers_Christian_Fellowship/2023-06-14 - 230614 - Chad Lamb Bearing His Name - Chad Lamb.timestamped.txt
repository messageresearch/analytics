[14:03] always feel good when I get back to see
[14:04] everybody once again and know that all
[14:06] is well
[14:07] and then what we're standing let's go
[14:08] and take our Bibles and turn to Acts
[14:11] chapter 9.
[14:13] I bring greetings from Brother Eugene
[14:15] Braun from the church there and all the
[14:17] saints there's so many of them wanted me
[14:19] to say hello to so many of you but uh we
[14:22] want to just receive their greetings and
[14:24] I want to Bear those greetings for them
[14:25] and we had a wonderful time we had
[14:28] weekend meetings there there was a
[14:30] Saturday morning men's fellowship
[14:31] breakfast which was wonderful whether
[14:33] Dale Smith was there and he shared at
[14:35] that and then we had the Saturday
[14:36] evening and Sunday morning serviced and
[14:38] a Sunday evening Fellowship we just had
[14:40] a marvelous time it was good to see
[14:42] everybody it's been almost four years
[14:43] since I've been there because of covert
[14:45] restrictions and all kinds of different
[14:47] things with the Border but oh it was
[14:49] good to see everybody's doing really
[14:50] well amen they're doing wonderful the
[14:52] word was good the fellowship was
[14:54] excellent the atmosphere was outstanding
[14:56] and God is good amen through it all
[14:59] everybody's still pressing on Amen
[15:00] everybody had challenges they had
[15:02] challenges we've had challenges over the
[15:04] last three and a half to four years but
[15:06] God brought us through them all and the
[15:08] word continues to bring us forward and
[15:10] so it was good to go see and hear their
[15:12] testimonies
[15:13] amen God is good also I enjoyed the
[15:16] service brother Nathaniel priest I had a
[15:18] chance to finish it last night as I was
[15:19] traveling home and I enjoyed that and
[15:21] appreciate him coming and doing that for
[15:23] us and also very much enjoyed the
[15:25] special the young men say that was
[15:27] wonderful I appreciate their lives I
[15:29] appreciate their dedication and love for
[15:31] the Lord and it comes through as they
[15:33] sang and it did me a whole world of good
[15:35] to hear them sing
[15:37] I've listened to it maybe five or six
[15:39] times already and I couldn't get enough
[15:41] of it amen
[15:43] don't say God bless you I also
[15:45] understand brother Aaron has some family
[15:46] in God bless you you're very very
[15:48] welcome and we're glad that you're able
[15:49] to come and visit amen let's look in
[15:52] here at Acts chapter 9 now Acts chapter
[15:55] 9
[15:57] verse 15.
[16:02] Acts chapter 9 verse 15 but the Lord
[16:04] said unto him go thy way for he is a
[16:07] chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name
[16:09] before the Gentiles and Kings and the
[16:11] children of Israel for I will show him
[16:13] how great things he must suffer for my
[16:15] namesake
[16:16] amen God bless you as you take your
[16:18] seats we begin to look into his word
[16:22] amen I've got a PowerPoint brother Frank
[16:23] if you could bring up that PowerPoint
[16:25] for me that would be great
[16:27] so we want to look at this scripture we
[16:29] want to talk about bearing his name this
[16:31] evening I was encouraged by Brother
[16:33] Nathaniel's message because it was right
[16:35] in line with where my heart was and some
[16:37] things I ministered up there on Sunday
[16:38] that I also wanted to share here today
[16:40] so I love to watch the continuity and
[16:43] it's always good and it's encouraging
[16:45] but we'll talk about bearing his name
[16:47] for just a little bit
[16:49] and and here in the book of Acts we know
[16:52] that Saul before he was the Apostle Paul
[16:54] he was Saul he was a great persecutor of
[16:57] the Christian faith and he was hauling
[16:59] men and women into prison and
[17:01] persecuting them and he was on his road
[17:03] to Damascus and he was struck down by
[17:05] the pillar of fire we know the story
[17:06] well and God comes to ananias and he
[17:09] wants him to go speak to Paul in ananias
[17:11] is hesitant he has a resistance because
[17:13] he knows the reputation of Paul but what
[17:16] ananias doesn't know is what God knows
[17:18] is that before the foundation of the
[17:19] world that he had already designated
[17:21] Saul to be Paul and to bear his name and
[17:25] so he says go thy way for he is a chosen
[17:28] vessel and to me don't worry about what
[17:30] you see don't worry about your reasoning
[17:31] don't worry about all your fears because
[17:33] in the back part of my mind he was a
[17:35] chosen vessel from before the foundation
[17:37] of the world
[17:38] but he was chosen to do something he was
[17:40] chosen he was a chosen vessel unto me to
[17:43] Bear my name before the Gentiles and
[17:45] kings and children of Israel for I will
[17:48] show him how great things excuse me he
[17:50] must suffer from my name's sake so he
[17:53] was chosen to bear his name
[17:56] I want to look at this for just a minute
[17:58] the word bear here means to take Upon
[18:01] take up in order to carry or bear to put
[18:05] up upon oneself something to be carried
[18:07] so God had actually chosen Paul to carry
[18:11] his name to the Gentiles
[18:15] Amen in this word name here means the
[18:18] name is used for everything which the
[18:20] name covers so everything which the name
[18:22] covers everything the thought or feeling
[18:24] of which is aroused in the mind of
[18:26] mentioning by mentioning hearing
[18:28] remembering the name for one's for
[18:31] example one's rank their Authority their
[18:33] interest their pleasure command
[18:35] Excellence Deeds when you say name this
[18:37] name encompasses everything about that
[18:40] person everything the name brings to
[18:43] mind amen are understanding amen
[18:45] somebody's name a name is more than
[18:48] characters
[18:49] it may be spelled out with characters
[18:51] but a name is more than characters amen
[18:54] the Apostle Paul was not commissioned
[18:56] and chosen to carry a spelling
[19:01] a proper spelling
[19:03] that's not what he was that wasn't what
[19:05] he was commissioned to carry
[19:07] so it's more than characters that of an
[19:11] alphabet that make up a name
[19:13] it's also more than pronunciation
[19:16] right he wasn't Paul wasn't commissioned
[19:19] to carry the right Aramaic characters so
[19:23] that the Gentiles are Greek characters
[19:24] or whatever it would be translated into
[19:26] they would know the name of Jesus Christ
[19:28] and they would have the right
[19:29] pronunciation amen that's not what he
[19:31] was carrying but he was carrying his
[19:33] name which that name is everything that
[19:36] the name represents which it represents
[19:38] the person of Jesus Christ himself
[19:41] when he was bearing the name he was
[19:44] literally carrying the presence of Jesus
[19:46] Christ the person of Christ and he was
[19:48] bearing the name to the people and
[19:51] everything that name represents he was
[19:52] carrying it to the people
[19:55] amen
[19:56] so it's more than just like I said
[20:00] characters or pronunciation this is why
[20:02] we have a whole world of billions of
[20:04] people that believe they're calling on
[20:06] the name of the Lord and they're calling
[20:08] on his history they're calling on
[20:11] characters they're calling on
[20:12] pronunciation amen but they don't know
[20:15] the person
[20:17] and they're not getting the effect out
[20:19] of the words amen that they would like
[20:21] to have amen because they don't have the
[20:23] character of Jesus Christ the person of
[20:25] Jesus Christ all that they have is a
[20:28] name that somebody told them
[20:31] but that name is so much more than a
[20:34] historical name of a historical figure
[20:35] amen that name represents a person
[20:38] represents a living person who's alive
[20:39] today that name represents all of his
[20:42] character his rank who he is and all
[20:44] about him and all that he's accomplished
[20:46] and all of his characteristics are
[20:48] wrapped up in that name
[20:51] praise God
[20:53] so so that is what
[20:57] the Apostle Paul is commissioned to
[20:59] carry to Bear to take upon himself and
[21:02] carry to the Gentiles
[21:05] we see this in the Old Testament here in
[21:07] Jeremiah 7 he refers to this he says but
[21:10] go ye now into the place
[21:12] which was in Shiloh where I set where I
[21:15] set my name at the first
[21:17] and see what I did to it for the
[21:19] wickedness of My People Israel he said
[21:21] go to Shiloh Shiloh was where the
[21:23] Tabernacle was first set up when they
[21:25] crossed Jordan and he says so when they
[21:27] first set up the Tabernacle he said go
[21:29] to Shiloh and see the place where I set
[21:31] my name at first
[21:33] what does he mean by set his name did he
[21:35] have a plaque with spelling and words
[21:37] and characters that's not what he meant
[21:38] by said his name that's where he put his
[21:40] presence that's where he could be found
[21:41] that's where he placed himself amen
[21:43] where they could contact him was in
[21:45] Shiloh that's where the Tabernacle was
[21:47] it wasn't that he had a nameplate and he
[21:49] put that nameplate there and he drove it
[21:51] in the ground and said his name there no
[21:53] he plays this is where they came to know
[21:55] God and contact God this is the place
[21:57] where he placed his name
[22:01] and this word set means to settle down
[22:04] abide dwelled Tabernacle or reside
[22:08] so where he said his name is where his
[22:10] name dwelt
[22:12] where his name tabernacled and it was in
[22:14] Shiloh amen what was in Shiloh the
[22:16] Tabernacle amen and God was dwelling in
[22:19] that Tabernacle
[22:21] and when God was in that time and I go
[22:23] all that God represented was there it
[22:25] was represented there all of his
[22:26] characteristics his nature his word it
[22:28] was all there and he says when when he
[22:31] had when he had come to that place he
[22:33] set his name
[22:34] there
[22:36] so the name I hope we understand now so
[22:39] much more than alphabetical characters
[22:42] so much more than pronunciation
[22:45] amen if we go to pronounce Jesus's name
[22:48] it depends on what country you're in
[22:51] is he Jesus or Yeshua or Jesus or
[22:55] can I say can I say Yeshua can I say
[22:58] Jesus can I say Jesus and get the same
[23:01] results
[23:02] if I'm talking about the same person
[23:06] so it's like what I say his name is not
[23:09] exactly the way it sounds when somebody
[23:10] else calls on the name of the Lord
[23:13] somebody from the other side of the
[23:14] world when they call on the name of the
[23:16] Lord what strikes my ears will be much
[23:18] different than what I say when I call in
[23:19] the name of the Lord but if they have
[23:21] his name amen and all that his name
[23:23] encompasses they're calling on the name
[23:26] of the Lord it'll bring the results
[23:29] amen
[23:31] this word name in the in the Hebrew is
[23:34] Shem it means reputation fame or Glory
[23:39] so much more than characters it
[23:41] represents the person it's their
[23:43] character it's their reputation it's
[23:45] their Glory it's all that they are is
[23:47] wrapped up in their name so when God
[23:48] places his name somewhere he puts his
[23:51] whole reputation his Fame his glory his
[23:53] person he attaches it to that
[23:56] and so now the Apostle Paul is carrying
[24:00] that name to the Gentiles
[24:02] in Acts 15 14 says Simeon hath declared
[24:05] how God at the first did visit the
[24:07] Gentiles to take out of them a people
[24:09] for his name so now God's coming to the
[24:12] Gentiles to take out of them a people
[24:13] for his name
[24:15] now what does that mean he's going to
[24:17] have a people that are going to bear his
[24:19] name amen a people that are going to
[24:21] have his name amen not not a
[24:24] pronunciation not not a spelling but
[24:26] they're going to have the very nature
[24:28] character they're going to have Christ
[24:30] amen and they're going to carry his name
[24:34] in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14 says for
[24:37] this cause I bow my knees into the
[24:39] father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom
[24:41] the whole family in Heaven and Earth is
[24:43] named if you remember when brother
[24:46] Isaiah Brooks was here he mentioned this
[24:47] scripture he went to this and this
[24:49] struck my heart back then and I've been
[24:50] meditating it on that since he said that
[24:53] he says the whole family in Heaven and
[24:55] Earth Bears the name his name Jesus
[24:58] Christ amen and that name is not just
[25:01] something that tickles your ears amen
[25:03] but that name is the the person and and
[25:06] it it brings with it a character
[25:07] characteristics character of a person is
[25:10] attributed to that and if the whole
[25:12] family in Heaven and Earth is named
[25:13] Jesus Christ amen the whole family in
[25:16] Heaven and Earth must bear the same
[25:18] character of that name
[25:21] because listen you know it's there's
[25:24] more to a name when you say when you say
[25:26] somebody has a good name what does it
[25:28] mean to have a good name
[25:30] does it mean well you know I I like I
[25:33] like this name better than that name
[25:35] this one has a just a nice ring to it
[25:37] the way it comes rolls that's not what
[25:39] it means to have a good name
[25:40] but we all know what it means to have a
[25:42] good name is to have a good reputation
[25:44] to have a good character and you're
[25:46] you're well thought of that means to
[25:47] have a good name
[25:49] because your name represents your person
[25:53] so now
[25:54] if you can also ruin your name
[25:59] is that right
[26:01] you're going to have a good name but you
[26:02] can also ruin your name and how can you
[26:04] ruin your name amen because you can act
[26:06] in a bad character and act in a bad way
[26:08] in doing so you ruin your name but the
[26:10] characters of your name never changed
[26:14] the pronunciation never changed but you
[26:17] can either have a good name or you can
[26:19] have a bad name depending on your
[26:21] conduct
[26:24] so this name means so much more than
[26:27] letters and syllables and pronunciations
[26:31] so if the whole
[26:32] heavens and earth is named Jesus Christ
[26:35] the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was
[26:38] the very manifestation of God himself
[26:40] and when he took on human flesh and he
[26:42] was he was a very reflection of the
[26:44] invisible God with all the
[26:46] characteristics and the character
[26:47] likewise and all the whole family is
[26:50] named Jesus Christ they all come under
[26:52] this name amen and if we're going to
[26:54] bear that name we're going to have to
[26:56] bear that character
[26:58] those characteristics amen because now I
[27:02] I had an uncle one time
[27:04] he was actually my great uncle amen but
[27:07] he was of a certain age because my
[27:09] grandpa had a large family where his
[27:11] sons were actually my age they were my
[27:13] second cousins my dad's first cousins
[27:15] but they were closer to my age
[27:17] and he passed away and I remember at his
[27:19] funeral he had I think it was five boys
[27:20] if I remember right and and at his
[27:23] funeral they kept talking about their
[27:26] their dad would tell them when they
[27:28] would go out at night when they got of
[27:29] age they got 16-17 to go out with
[27:31] friends
[27:32] and he said he would make this statement
[27:34] to him he says make sure you represent
[27:38] the family name well
[27:41] and all of those boys
[27:43] all of those boys talked about how that
[27:47] that little saying haunted them when
[27:49] they were out with their friends
[27:51] why because they were bearing his name
[27:55] they were his children they were bearing
[27:57] his name amen and they were bearing the
[27:59] family name and their conduct had a
[28:02] reflection on the family name
[28:05] and he said bear the name bear the
[28:07] family name well amen and then and it's
[28:10] amazing how much impact that had on them
[28:13] but it had a lot of impact on me when I
[28:15] heard that and we realized amen that
[28:18] that our children amen they have a
[28:20] reflection on our name
[28:22] they bear our name the wife Bears the
[28:25] name of her husband and she has a
[28:27] reflection on the character of the
[28:28] husband
[28:30] amen so the whole family in Heaven and
[28:33] Earth is named Jesus Christ and they
[28:36] must come under what that name
[28:38] represents
[28:39] what does it represent it represents a
[28:41] character it represents a life it
[28:43] represents a glory of Fame a reputation
[28:46] and so here we're here on Earth and
[28:48] we're bearing a name
[28:50] but that name that we're bearing is the
[28:53] name Jesus Christ and that name
[28:55] represents characteristics it represents
[28:58] a life and if I'm going to bear that
[29:01] name and have that name attributed to me
[29:03] and come under that family name amen
[29:06] then I must come under the
[29:07] characteristics of that name
[29:11] or else I can
[29:13] I can misrepresent
[29:15] the family name
[29:19] brother said in the God of this evil age
[29:21] but he is calling not a church group but
[29:23] a people for his name that receives his
[29:27] name
[29:28] engaged in his name going to a wedding
[29:31] to be married to him to be part become
[29:32] part of him see by predestination just
[29:35] as a man that chooses a right wife in
[29:37] life was ordained to be part of his body
[29:39] so that is the bride of Christ will be
[29:41] in his now from old ordained by God to
[29:45] be part of that body
[29:47] and to bear his name because it's his
[29:50] body what's the name of his body Jesus
[29:52] Christ
[29:53] I'm part of that body and that body's
[29:55] under the headship which is one name
[29:58] so he's looking for a people for his
[30:00] name that receives his name so what does
[30:02] it mean to receive his name
[30:04] is to receive him
[30:06] and all of his life and character
[30:09] in the Philadelphia churches it says he
[30:11] says Jesus said I come in my father's
[30:14] name and you receive me not therefore
[30:15] the name of God is Jesus for that is the
[30:18] name he is coming he is Lord Jesus
[30:20] Christ and and what name does a woman
[30:23] take when she marries the man she takes
[30:25] his name it will be his name that is
[30:27] given unto the bride when he takes her
[30:29] unto himself so her name will be Mrs
[30:32] Jesus Christ amen but she's going to now
[30:34] by marriage be carrying that name
[30:38] and how is she going to carry that name
[30:40] how are we going to carry that name are
[30:42] we going to carry it in such a way to
[30:44] misrepresent the character that that
[30:46] name represents I said God help us help
[30:48] us Lord Jesus if we're going to carry
[30:50] your name and if you're so gracious Amen
[30:52] to unite with us and place your name on
[30:54] us amen may we surrender ourselves so
[30:57] that your life can live out your
[30:59] characteristics in us so that we don't
[31:01] bring a bad name to your name we don't
[31:03] misrepresent your name
[31:07] we don't take your name falsely because
[31:09] we say I'm part of that family in Heaven
[31:12] and Earth that's named Jesus but I have
[31:14] a totally different character how can
[31:15] you have a totally different character
[31:17] and be part of that family
[31:19] say oh God we need you
[31:23] amen
[31:28] remember says in this message once more
[31:30] he says
[31:31] why did he change Jacob to Israel not
[31:34] until you wrestled with the Lord not
[31:35] until he overcome and when Jesus
[31:37] overcome death Hell In The Grave the
[31:39] Bible said he had a new name and when
[31:41] Jacob overcome and if the church can
[31:43] overcome so let's listen to this if the
[31:46] church can overcome what does the church
[31:47] have to overcome here's what he says she
[31:50] will stop saying I'm Methodist Baptist
[31:53] Presbyterian when she can overcome her
[31:56] Creeds and the world that's drawing her
[31:58] in there she'll come back to the Bride
[32:00] of Jesus Christ Mrs Jesus Christ
[32:03] what do you have to overcome you have to
[32:05] overcome the whole denominational
[32:07] thinking in the whole carnal system and
[32:09] thinking about God and the whole worldly
[32:12] set up we've got to over Heck on that
[32:14] and when we can overcome that we won't
[32:16] call ourselves by a false name
[32:19] we overcome that we won't be methodists
[32:21] and we won't be Baptist and we won't be
[32:23] Presbyterian but maybe it goes a little
[32:24] deeper than that we won't be part of
[32:26] this message group and part of this
[32:28] message group and identified with this
[32:30] Minister and part of this church no I I
[32:32] that's not what I'm bearing I'm not just
[32:34] bearing the name of all I'm bearing one
[32:36] name and that's the name of Jesus Christ
[32:38] and I'm not going to get my
[32:40] identification with Methodist Baptist or
[32:42] this Doctrine or this group or this
[32:44] special this and this special church
[32:46] here but I want to Bear one name and
[32:48] that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:52] amen
[32:54] amen that way that we know that we're
[32:57] overcoming because we're overcoming and
[32:59] we're not taking false identities
[33:02] but we're coming to one identity and
[33:04] that's Mrs Jesus Christ
[33:08] President says in the name is in the
[33:11] word
[33:13] not just because Jesus is spelled out in
[33:15] the Bible somewhere
[33:17] but the name is in the word because he
[33:20] is the word
[33:21] so when you're reading the word you're
[33:24] reading Jesus Christ
[33:27] because it's his characters it's his
[33:29] life it's his reputation it's his glory
[33:31] it is him it's his characteristics so
[33:34] when you're reading your Bible you're
[33:35] reading Jesus Christ even in the places
[33:38] that j-e-s-u-s isn't spelled in your
[33:40] English Bible you're still reading Jesus
[33:42] Christ
[33:44] now listen and the name is in the word
[33:46] because he is the word what is he then
[33:49] the word interpreted is the
[33:53] manifestation of the name of God
[33:56] I thought it was Jesus Christ it is
[33:58] Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the
[34:00] word made manifest in the day and age
[34:03] that we live in
[34:05] so the word interpreted is a
[34:07] manifestation or a revealing of the name
[34:10] of God why do we have to have the name
[34:11] of God revealed we've known it for two
[34:13] thousand years
[34:16] we may know a pronunciation we mean no
[34:18] characters amen but we do we know what
[34:21] those characters rep do we know the life
[34:23] behind it the character behind it
[34:26] so there must in every age be a
[34:28] manifestation of the name of God well
[34:31] we've known that we've known that since
[34:33] Jesus Christ was born we've known that
[34:35] that name no there must be a fresh
[34:37] manifestation of the name and the age
[34:39] you live in
[34:42] amen
[34:45] so no wonder flesh and blood is not
[34:47] revealed this to you but my Father which
[34:49] is in heaven has revealed this to you
[34:50] who I am amen what was the Revelation
[34:54] who he is
[34:57] not just who he was
[35:00] not just who he will be
[35:02] but the Revelation that the church is
[35:05] founded upon is who he is
[35:09] in every day in every age the the
[35:12] manifestation or the the the the the
[35:14] thing the the foundation of the church
[35:17] the rock that the church is founded upon
[35:20] that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[35:22] against it is one foundation and that is
[35:24] the revelation of who he is
[35:28] and that is the manifestation in the
[35:30] name of God
[35:32] amen it goes on in God's chosen place of
[35:35] worship he said there is fine people in
[35:37] the world fine churches
[35:40] but there's one Mrs Jesus Christ
[35:43] and that's who he's coming for that's
[35:45] where his name Lays
[35:48] amen now we're all the way back like we
[35:50] were in the Old Testament
[35:52] all the way back
[35:54] the place where I set my name
[35:58] now what what is Mrs Jesus Christ that's
[36:03] where his name lays there is where his
[36:05] worship is in her and her alone that is
[36:08] true
[36:09] just like he said oh my just like he
[36:12] said in Jeremiah he said go back to
[36:15] Shiloh the place where I set my name and
[36:17] look at it because of their wickedness I
[36:19] brought destruction go look at where
[36:20] it's at now and I tell you go back and
[36:23] look at where the Lutheran Church is and
[36:24] where the Wesley church is it's an
[36:26] absolute apostasy it's disgraceful where
[36:29] they're at why because that's where his
[36:31] name was at one point but when they left
[36:33] Christ amen they're no longer bearing
[36:35] his name that's where he had said his
[36:37] name absolutely in that day amen but
[36:40] that's not where his name is now
[36:48] amen
[36:50] so where is his name wherever Mrs Jesus
[36:53] Christ is
[36:55] that's where his name Lays
[36:58] it's not a plaque it's not a button it's
[37:00] not a name tag
[37:03] it's his very character his life
[37:06] that she is carrying
[37:09] the wife can ruin the husband's name
[37:14] in fact if you marry the wrong kind of
[37:16] woman you will ruin your name
[37:19] your name will be mud your name will be
[37:21] smeared amen because because your wife
[37:24] is a reflection of your character
[37:26] brother Bennett said the kind of woman a
[37:28] man chooses reflects his character and
[37:30] what's on the inside and what he's
[37:32] thinking about his future oh amen he
[37:34] preaches this in choosing of a bride
[37:35] amen so a man's wife reflects what's on
[37:38] the inside of the man and that's why you
[37:40] marry the wrong kind of woman amen and
[37:42] she goes out there and she will ruin
[37:44] your name
[37:48] but if you marry the right kind of woman
[37:51] she will she will actually bring glory
[37:54] and honor to your name
[37:56] when she keeps herself in humility and
[37:59] modesty and reverence and respect and
[38:01] her reputation is good and clean and
[38:03] pure she will actually bring glory to
[38:06] your name
[38:08] because she's the right kind of woman
[38:10] that's the kind of woman the Bride of
[38:12] Jesus Christ should be we should be
[38:14] bringing glory to his name because the
[38:16] woman is the glory of the man
[38:18] according to what Paul said the woman is
[38:20] the glory of the man amen but but a bad
[38:23] woman the Bible says is as water in your
[38:26] blood
[38:27] it weakens you
[38:30] amen but the right kind of woman brings
[38:32] glory to his name
[38:34] so where does his name lay today
[38:36] wherever you can find
[38:38] this is Jesus Christ where the word for
[38:42] this day is being interpreted as a
[38:44] manifestation of the name what's the
[38:47] interpretation of the word for this day
[38:48] Jesus Christ in the formation of his
[38:51] bride he's here living his life in his
[38:54] body and his body is a mini-membered
[38:56] body upon this Earth which is the Bride
[38:58] of Jesus Christ United to the head which
[39:00] is he himself living his life through
[39:02] his body that is the interpretation of
[39:05] the word today
[39:06] and that's where his name Lays
[39:10] oh God I want to represent that name
[39:12] right
[39:13] but I'm not going to be able to do it by
[39:15] myself
[39:17] the only way for me to represent that
[39:19] name is for me to forget my name
[39:24] remember what your name represents
[39:28] your name represents your character your
[39:30] reputation your Fame Your Glory it
[39:33] represents all that you are all that
[39:34] you've accomplished your rank in life
[39:36] your status and everything that goes
[39:37] with that name but in order to bear his
[39:39] name I'm going to have to lose my name
[39:42] which I'm going to have to lose my
[39:43] reputation I'm gonna have to lose my
[39:45] rank I'm going to have to lose
[39:47] everything every everybody thought about
[39:49] me and become absolutely nothing so that
[39:52] I'm not bearing my own name my own Glory
[39:54] my own reputation but I'm bearing his
[39:57] name
[40:00] I I
[40:02] I just can't do both at the same time
[40:06] so may God help me
[40:09] a man in Christ is the mystery of God
[40:11] revealed the prophet of God says and
[40:12] remember we are now as his bride
[40:14] pregnanted with his Spirit oh my the
[40:17] church bearing Children See pregnated by
[40:19] his spirit with his name bearing his
[40:21] name
[40:22] we are now bearing his name we're
[40:24] carrying his name and his name is on
[40:27] display through the bride we're bearing
[40:28] his name what does it mean bearing his
[40:31] life
[40:32] bringing forth the signs of his life
[40:34] evident with the preeminence is evidence
[40:37] of his resurrection showing that he is
[40:39] not dead but Alive forevermore that's
[40:42] what the bride's doing she's bearing his
[40:44] name she's bearing his life
[40:48] amen
[40:50] now now I want to I want to take just a
[40:52] turn that was all just Foundation
[40:56] amen you know when when we say that we
[41:00] must bear his name we go all the way
[41:02] back to Genesis if we go all the way
[41:04] back to Genesis you don't have to turn
[41:06] there but I'm going to reference two
[41:07] scriptures and in Genesis chapter 5
[41:09] verse 1 it says this is the book of the
[41:11] generations of Adam
[41:13] in the day that God created man and the
[41:15] likeness of God made him male and female
[41:17] created he them and blessed them and
[41:19] called their name Adam in the day when
[41:21] they were created
[41:23] what what name was the woman bearing
[41:28] Adam
[41:30] she was bearing his name
[41:33] why because she was carrying his life
[41:35] his Spirit the female part of his Spirit
[41:38] part of his flesh she was bearing his
[41:41] name
[41:42] and her name was never Eve until after
[41:45] she committed adultery
[41:47] and God never gave her her name Adam
[41:49] gave her a name
[41:51] God gave her the name Adam he didn't
[41:54] give her a separate name or a separate
[41:56] identity he only intended for the two to
[41:58] be one and have one identity one
[42:00] identification and one name and that
[42:03] name was Adam
[42:05] she was not to separate from Adam and
[42:08] have her own thoughts her own ideas
[42:13] so when she's separated brother Ben said
[42:15] when she left the word she left her mate
[42:18] and when she left the word she committed
[42:20] adultery amen because now she had her
[42:24] own desire
[42:25] her own lust her own want something she
[42:28] wanted something that she saw that this
[42:31] was good for food to make one wise now
[42:34] there's a reputation involved
[42:36] now there's self-desire and
[42:38] self-reputation and all of this
[42:40] self-promotion amen because the the
[42:42] serpent says in the day you eat there if
[42:44] you'll become like God's knowing good
[42:46] from Evil and now there's a whole
[42:48] reputation coming in
[42:51] and now she left the word she left her
[42:53] mate amen and now after she falls and
[42:56] after the curse comes upon him then Adam
[42:59] Amen in Genesis chapter 3 Adam called
[43:02] the name of his wife Eve which is the
[43:06] mother of all living how did she get to
[43:08] be the mother of a living by adultery by
[43:10] leaving the word by seeking her own
[43:12] reputation her own passion her own lust
[43:15] her own desire
[43:16] that's how you get Baptist that's how
[43:18] you get methodists that's how you get
[43:20] Catholic
[43:22] leaving the mate leaving the word to
[43:25] have her own promotion our own ideas our
[43:28] own glory and our own reputation amen
[43:31] and we think those are just names of
[43:32] denominations listen it can be your
[43:34] church name in the message it can be
[43:36] your family name it can be under your
[43:38] favorite preacher or pastor's name
[43:43] oh God help us not to seek our own
[43:46] identification our own reputation our
[43:48] own our own Glory our own Fame but oh my
[43:51] that Pride was injected at the fall amen
[43:54] it comes from Lucifer through Satan
[43:56] injected into Humanity amen through the
[43:58] serpent and now we find it in Cain and
[44:01] oh my goodness God Almighty help us to
[44:04] fight that thing
[44:05] [Music]
[44:06] because the moment we start making our
[44:08] own reputation amen we're going away
[44:11] from our mate we're going away we're
[44:13] being tempted away we're not here to
[44:15] have our own name amen I'm not here to
[44:18] have a good name on this planet I'm here
[44:20] to Bear a good name one name and that's
[44:22] the name Lord Jesus Christ
[44:25] amen
[44:31] oh praise God
[44:33] if we can keep our mind in the right
[44:36] frame of mind then we can begin to
[44:38] understand the Temptations of the devil
[44:40] as it comes in and these little
[44:42] Temptations they come so subtle
[44:45] they come so subtle and sometimes they
[44:47] seem so good amen and we're tempted to
[44:49] do things to make ourselves look better
[44:51] than someone else
[44:54] I mean it doesn't come in as a bold face
[44:56] it's just a subtle playing with that
[44:59] Pride that's buried in your old
[45:01] conquerber nature
[45:04] playing with that desire amen that
[45:08] desire to be just a little more well
[45:11] thought of
[45:17] telling you we all suffer from it
[45:21] every one of us suffer from it we've got
[45:23] to watch that thing amen and say that's
[45:26] not why I'm on this planet that's not
[45:28] why I'm here I'm not here to make a name
[45:30] for myself I'm here to Bear a name
[45:34] and if God will help me that's what I
[45:36] intend to do
[45:38] amen but I can't do it on my own
[45:41] now I want to look at what we call the
[45:44] statue of a perfect man from second
[45:45] Peter chapter one begin in verse 4.
[45:49] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[45:50] great and precious promises
[45:53] promises
[45:55] promises
[45:57] we have to see this as part of promises
[46:02] if we don't see this as part of promises
[46:04] we'll see us as a works and merit-based
[46:07] program
[46:10] that I have to work my way from Faith to
[46:14] Virtue I've got it's not a Works based
[46:17] program these are promises
[46:24] given us this exceeding great and
[46:26] precious promises that by these by what
[46:28] by the promises
[46:31] you might be partakers of the divine
[46:33] nature how am I going to be a Perfecter
[46:35] partaker of the Divine Nature by the
[46:38] precious promises
[46:40] having escaped the corruption that is in
[46:42] the world through lust and beside this
[46:45] giving all diligence add to your faith
[46:47] virtue
[46:48] and virtue knowledge and knowledge
[46:50] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[46:52] into patience godliness and to Godliness
[46:54] brotherly kindness into brotherly
[46:56] kindness charity for if these things be
[46:58] in you and abound they make you that you
[47:00] shall neither be Barren nor and fruitful
[47:01] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[47:04] Christ
[47:06] amen so these Seven Virtues that we're
[47:08] looking at capped off by charity
[47:12] perfect love
[47:13] amen it's the divine nature
[47:16] but we've received precious promises
[47:18] that we might be partakers of the divine
[47:20] nature
[47:22] so this is a promise to me amen then I
[47:25] want to receive the promise
[47:28] brother Brandon in the message things
[47:30] that are to be he says this now the only
[47:33] way that you can be a son or daughter of
[47:35] God is because you have to have eternal
[47:37] life
[47:38] and there's only one form of eternal
[47:40] life and that's God's life
[47:41] only one form of eternal life that was
[47:43] God
[47:45] and there to be a Son of God you had to
[47:47] be in him always the gene of your life
[47:49] spiritual life tonight was in God the
[47:51] Father before there was even a molecule
[47:53] and you are nothing but the
[47:55] manifestation of the gene of life that
[47:57] was in God as a Son of God I love that
[47:59] statement
[48:01] because when brother Venom says you're
[48:03] nothing but
[48:05] usually when you use that you're nothing
[48:06] but a this or that
[48:08] you use it it's been used so many times
[48:10] derogatory but when he looks at you and
[48:12] says you're nothing but he's about to
[48:15] say the most wonderful thing that could
[48:17] ever be said about you
[48:19] you're nothing
[48:21] in this life you're nothing
[48:23] your reputation doesn't matter you're
[48:26] you're all your glory doesn't count
[48:28] you're nothing but
[48:32] the manifestation of the gene of life
[48:35] that was in God as the Son of God then I
[48:38] can say I'm nothing but the only thing I
[48:41] ever want to be
[48:42] that is that is the most marvelous
[48:45] statement I've ever heard amen
[48:47] attributed to me you're nothing but
[48:49] praise God I don't want to be nothing
[48:51] but that that's the only thing I desire
[48:53] to be is a manifestation of God as a son
[48:56] of God
[48:59] then he goes on to say now
[49:01] now you're expressed
[49:05] after his word has come into in you to
[49:08] light up this age
[49:09] you are expressing God's life in you
[49:12] because you are a son or daughter of God
[49:13] therefore you get what I mean see you
[49:16] you are now made you're sitting in this
[49:19] church tonight because your duty is to
[49:22] express God to this nation and this
[49:24] people in this neighborhood where you
[49:26] associate
[49:28] you're nothing
[49:30] you're nothing but the manifestation of
[49:33] a gene of life that was in God as the
[49:36] son of God
[49:37] and now you're expressed after his word
[49:40] is coming to you and you're expressed to
[49:42] light up this age
[49:44] and you're now made you're sitting in
[49:47] this church tonight because your duty
[49:49] why am I here what's my purpose he's
[49:51] about to tell you this is your purpose
[49:53] your duty is to express God to this
[49:57] nation and this people in this
[49:58] neighborhood where you associate we are
[50:01] not here to make a name for ourselves we
[50:04] are not here to gain a reputation we are
[50:06] not here to have a good name
[50:09] amen we are here to express God
[50:14] where everywhere I'm at is where I'm to
[50:17] express God
[50:19] amen I'm not here to gain accolades I'm
[50:23] not here to collect Awards I'm not here
[50:25] amen listen if they come to my funeral
[50:28] and they start preaching my funeral
[50:29] start talking about all the things that
[50:31] I achieved in this world Amen and that
[50:33] that's all that there's ever said that
[50:35] my life will have been the most wasted
[50:37] life there ever was on the earth he won
[50:39] a Nobel Prize and he invented this and
[50:41] and he he won the the the marathon and
[50:44] he he was first place in the high school
[50:47] or whatever
[50:49] who cares
[50:51] it all Burns and it all perishes amen
[50:53] who cares at the end of my life you can
[50:56] read a whole list of achievements and
[50:58] accolades and awards and it will mean
[51:00] absolutely nothing to me I want to get
[51:02] into the place where that doesn't mean
[51:04] anything but what means something to me
[51:06] is that I die so that he can live so
[51:09] that I can do what my duty is and my
[51:11] duty is to express him
[51:15] and if God wants that the expression to
[51:18] come through accolades and through
[51:19] Awards and through promotion amen then
[51:21] that's got to be up to him it's not my
[51:23] achievement it's got to be his
[51:24] achievement
[51:25] if he wants to move me to another
[51:27] position into another place or he wants
[51:29] to it's got to be his achievement in me
[51:31] not my achievement for myself but his
[51:34] achievement for himself
[51:38] amen
[51:40] when God needs us in a position he'll
[51:43] put us in that position if he can get
[51:45] more glory in another position he'll
[51:46] move us to that position the problem is
[51:48] when we think we earn that position
[51:50] because of our hard work and our
[51:51] dedication and our wisdom and our
[51:56] amen then all of a sudden Pride enters
[51:58] in amen and then a haughty spirit and
[52:01] that's all precursors to a fall
[52:05] we didn't get listen we didn't get to
[52:07] the positions we're in because we're
[52:09] brilliant we didn't get to the positions
[52:10] we're in because of all of our Hardware
[52:12] yeah do you work hard yes I do I work
[52:14] hard because whatever God's given me to
[52:16] do I want to do my best
[52:18] I don't want to be found slothful if
[52:20] God's given me a job I work is unto the
[52:21] Lord
[52:24] amen
[52:26] but we've got to keep our mind
[52:28] in the right spot
[52:30] or else we find ourselves caught in a
[52:32] trap
[52:34] then we end up missing our very purpose
[52:37] and we miss the purpose for our
[52:38] promotion
[52:40] because our promotion is for God to put
[52:42] us in another place so that we can
[52:44] express him
[52:46] we miss the purpose for a job change
[52:48] because that was God moving us because
[52:50] our duty is to express him in this
[52:52] neighborhood and this church and this
[52:53] place where you associate
[52:56] so if God moves your Association it's
[52:58] because your duty is to express him in
[52:59] that new Association
[53:03] maybe God's done with having you express
[53:06] on the shop floor maybe he wants you to
[53:08] express in the executive boardroom
[53:12] what am I doing from here to there I'm
[53:14] there to express God I was there to
[53:17] express God I'm here to express God
[53:18] that's my duty
[53:21] on this planet
[53:23] praise be to God
[53:25] amen
[53:28] oh praise God
[53:31] so let's go to the next version First
[53:34] Peter 4 12. beloved thinking not strange
[53:37] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[53:38] try you as though some strange thing
[53:41] happened to you
[53:43] now now this is really the part that I
[53:45] really wanted to get to all of that was
[53:47] just laying a foundation so that I can
[53:49] speak for the next 10 or 15 minutes on
[53:51] this thought
[53:52] we've made this statement before but I
[53:54] want to make it here in connection with
[53:56] what we're talking about
[53:58] the virtues that we talk about the
[54:00] divine nature Amen to express God if we
[54:03] express God we will Express a god
[54:05] according to his divine nature
[54:07] if we're going to Bear the name of Jesus
[54:09] Christ we're going to Bear a certain
[54:10] nature and we've already been told this
[54:12] is the divine nature of these virtues
[54:15] but the virtues are only expressed in
[54:20] opposition to those virtues
[54:22] we spoke of this before
[54:24] faith is only expressed in an atmosphere
[54:27] of unbelief
[54:28] if everybody's believing there's no
[54:31] expression of faith
[54:33] but when everybody's disbelieving and
[54:34] some will believe now there's an
[54:36] expression of faith
[54:37] Faith Rises to the occasion in the face
[54:40] of unbelief
[54:42] amen Temperance when nobody has
[54:44] self-control Temperance now comes in and
[54:47] is self-control in the face of
[54:49] conditions where you would lack
[54:51] self-control
[54:52] knowledge where there is no knowledge of
[54:54] God God gives knowledge
[54:57] now these virtues aren't yours
[55:01] these are his
[55:03] that he's granted to you it's Holy Ghost
[55:06] virtue
[55:07] Holy Ghost Temperance Holy Ghost not
[55:10] this isn't yours
[55:12] this is his
[55:15] amen but how are these expressed they're
[55:18] expressing the opposition to the virtue
[55:21] so if we never have opposition to The
[55:24] Virtue how will the virtue ever be
[55:25] expressed
[55:28] remember he told us that the whole
[55:30] purpose for the fall is because white
[55:32] stands out against a black backdrop
[55:35] through the contrast brings the
[55:38] Revelation the contrast makes the nature
[55:40] of God stand up and so we can complain
[55:42] about being as Satan's Eden but I'm
[55:43] telling you we've had the best backdrop
[55:45] we've ever had to display the Life of
[55:47] Christ
[55:48] amen you can say oh Satan's in this got
[55:50] me down Satan's even is not to get you
[55:52] down sanezine is not to destroy you
[55:54] laodicea is not to hinder you it's there
[55:57] to create a situation where the light of
[55:59] the Gospel can shine brighter than it's
[56:00] ever shine in any generation because
[56:02] it's blacker than it's ever been
[56:05] so we can grieve and mourn and the
[56:07] government this and I wish we could get
[56:08] it back it's not meant to get it back
[56:10] you're not meant to make America great
[56:12] again that's not what's supposed to
[56:14] happen Satan Zina is supposed to go into
[56:15] full effect so the virtues can be
[56:17] displayed and the faith nobody has
[56:19] self-control except the Bride of Jesus
[56:21] Christ nobody has Temperance except the
[56:23] Bride of Jesus Christ the whole world is
[56:26] good they're losing out to their own
[56:27] desires they're losing out their their
[56:29] victims to their own Passions
[56:33] no more virtue no more strength in the
[56:35] human race amen they're totally given
[56:37] over to their passions their wants their
[56:38] desires until they've become absolute
[56:40] fools chasing after desire
[56:43] and they're ruining lives all over the
[56:45] place there's in everyone else amen but
[56:47] it's the perfect situation for the
[56:49] divine nature to go on display
[56:55] amen
[56:56] I'm so glad to be alive in this day
[57:00] amen there was a day when when when
[57:02] America was Christian amen there was a
[57:05] time then it was under the Puritans and
[57:07] it was mostly holy and mostly right and
[57:10] my goodness my poor little flame would
[57:12] have been so lost in all that life but
[57:14] oh praise God it's so dark that even if
[57:16] I've got a faint flame it's going to
[57:18] shine bright in this day I'm so thankful
[57:21] he put me in this day amen so that if I
[57:24] can surrender to him and his life his
[57:26] word can lighten me it'll shine like
[57:28] it's never shine before
[57:30] amen
[57:32] so we can look at these things and take
[57:34] the wrong mindset oh woe is me oh it's
[57:37] horrible it's perfect friends
[57:40] perfect for what he wants
[57:42] so the virtue
[57:44] the virtue
[57:48] it the opposition to The Virtue is
[57:51] necessary to display the virtue
[57:55] and then also you begin to wonder
[57:59] where do these virtues come from
[58:02] amen they're activated by the Holy Ghost
[58:05] but they come from the seed of God
[58:08] and God knows what's trapped inside of
[58:11] us
[58:12] and he knows to how to draw it out
[58:16] amen God knows how to activate the
[58:19] virtue
[58:22] amen
[58:23] he's placed a seed inside of us and he's
[58:25] quickened that seed by his word
[58:27] and he knows how to bring that seed in
[58:29] the full manifestation
[58:31] and sometimes it takes a little pressure
[58:34] sometimes it takes a little trial a
[58:37] little tribulation a little pressure to
[58:39] get that virtue activated
[58:43] and on display
[58:45] so then the trial doesn't become
[58:47] something terrible the trial becomes
[58:49] something wonderful
[58:51] because it's going to produce in me more
[58:54] of the divine nature on display
[58:58] not less more
[59:00] amen
[59:03] praise God
[59:06] in the Samaritan Church age out of the
[59:08] church age book I'm going to read this
[59:09] quote to you
[59:11] he said why does he stand by the reason
[59:14] is Romans 8 17 and 18 and if children
[59:16] then heirs heirs have gone and Joint
[59:18] heirs with Christ if so be that we
[59:20] suffer with him that we may be also
[59:22] glorified together for I reckon that the
[59:24] sufferings of this present time are not
[59:25] worthy to be compared with the glory
[59:27] which shall be revealed
[59:28] in US
[59:30] not to us
[59:32] in US
[59:34] so the sufferings of this present time
[59:35] are not even comparison not worthy to be
[59:38] compared to the glory that shall be
[59:40] revealed in US
[59:45] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[59:47] reign with him
[59:48] you have to suffer to Reign the reason
[59:51] for this is that character simply is
[59:53] never made without suffering
[59:55] characters of Victory not a gift a man
[59:57] without character can't Reign because
[59:59] power apart from character is satanic
[1:00:01] but Power with character is fit to rule
[1:00:09] you know
[1:00:10] I'm just gonna stop reading for a minute
[1:00:13] just speaking for myself I for so long I
[1:00:17] I I want so much the power of Christ to
[1:00:20] be displayed in my life
[1:00:22] I want to see manifestations and works
[1:00:25] and and want to see all of these things
[1:00:27] and and you know we've seen we've seen
[1:00:29] so many things that God has done we've
[1:00:30] seen him heal in some Supernatural ways
[1:00:32] we've seen him do Supernatural things
[1:00:34] all over our lives and we chase after
[1:00:36] sometimes that manifestation but really
[1:00:38] that manifestation without character it
[1:00:41] becomes satanic
[1:00:43] so then now my main goal is not to chase
[1:00:46] after the power but now my main desire
[1:00:48] is to chase after the character
[1:00:50] because if I chase after the character
[1:00:52] the power won't harm me
[1:00:55] the power won't destroy me the
[1:00:57] manifestation won't won't cause me to
[1:01:00] fall
[1:01:04] you understand what I'm saying
[1:01:06] so now my desire is not for power my
[1:01:09] desires for character oh God Amen God do
[1:01:12] a work in Me God help me help me to die
[1:01:14] help me to overcome and Lord display
[1:01:16] yourself in this vessel Lord I'm
[1:01:18] surrendering oh now you come and live
[1:01:20] with me I need more of you
[1:01:26] but Power with character is fit to rule
[1:01:31] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:01:33] throne on the same basis that he
[1:01:34] overcame and is set down in his father's
[1:01:36] term then we have to overcome to sit
[1:01:38] with him and the little temporary
[1:01:40] sufferings we go through now is not
[1:01:42] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:01:43] Glory that will be revealed in us when
[1:01:46] he comes oh what Treasures are laid up
[1:01:48] for those who are willing to enter into
[1:01:50] his kingdom through much tribulation I
[1:01:52] love how he said the little temporary
[1:01:54] sufferings
[1:01:55] I've been in some of those little
[1:01:56] temporary sufferings and I thought I was
[1:01:57] going to die
[1:01:59] I thought it was the worst thing that
[1:02:00] ever happened I can't even catch my
[1:02:01] breath I think I'm going to die if God
[1:02:03] if you take me home now that would be
[1:02:05] fine by me
[1:02:06] but brother van calls him little
[1:02:08] temporary sufferings
[1:02:09] they're not even worthy to be compared
[1:02:11] to the glory that lays ahead
[1:02:14] amen and then he goes on the court of
[1:02:16] scripture thinking not strange
[1:02:17] concerning the fiery trials that are
[1:02:19] detrium
[1:02:20] this is what Peter said is it strange
[1:02:23] that God wants us to develop a
[1:02:24] christ-like character that comes through
[1:02:26] suffering
[1:02:27] is that strange that he wants us to be
[1:02:29] like him
[1:02:30] why because we're called to bear his
[1:02:32] name
[1:02:33] so he must have his character
[1:02:37] so is it strange that God wants us to
[1:02:39] develop a christ-like character that
[1:02:40] comes through suffering no sir and we
[1:02:42] all have trials we are all tried and
[1:02:44] chastened his sons not one but goes
[1:02:46] through that the church that is not
[1:02:48] suffering and is not being tried hasn't
[1:02:50] got it isn't of God
[1:02:52] Hebrews 12 6 for whom the Lord loveth he
[1:02:54] chasteneth and scourges every son whom
[1:02:56] he receiveth but if ye be without
[1:02:58] chastisement whereof all our partakers
[1:03:00] then you are bastards and not Sons
[1:03:02] now this special condition in Smyrna
[1:03:05] must be applied to every age there is no
[1:03:08] age free from it there is no True
[1:03:10] Believer free from it
[1:03:12] amen this is of god this is the will of
[1:03:16] God
[1:03:17] it is needful we need the Lord to teach
[1:03:20] us the truth that we are to suffer and
[1:03:22] be christ-like in doing it love suffers
[1:03:24] long and is kind
[1:03:27] oh my you say why all the pressure why
[1:03:30] and and you know we've talked about this
[1:03:33] before but my expectation is not for the
[1:03:36] outside pressure to get better
[1:03:39] my expectation is not for the world and
[1:03:42] it's darkness and its encroachment upon
[1:03:45] amen everything we stand for I don't
[1:03:46] expect that to get better
[1:03:49] why because the darkness shines forth
[1:03:52] the light the pressure brings more
[1:03:54] virtue
[1:03:57] Amen Brother Bear said sometimes God has
[1:03:59] to crush a rose to get the perfume out
[1:04:01] of it you know
[1:04:03] and the crushing of the Rose the intent
[1:04:05] was not to destroy the rose or throw
[1:04:07] away the rose it was the intent of
[1:04:09] crushing the rose was to get a fragrance
[1:04:12] out of it that would that would fulfill
[1:04:14] the purpose of the Rose and take the
[1:04:15] rose into another life
[1:04:18] now instead of a rose by the side of the
[1:04:20] trail or by the side of the road who
[1:04:22] only gets smelled by somebody who bends
[1:04:24] down and smells it when that Rose is
[1:04:26] collected and crushed the fragrance now
[1:04:28] can become part of a fragrance that
[1:04:30] fills the house that anoints a person
[1:04:31] that becomes part of the apocry that's
[1:04:34] burnt amen Before the Throne of God now
[1:04:36] what God is trying to do is trying to
[1:04:38] get that sweet saver on display
[1:04:42] not to destroy sometimes it feels like
[1:04:44] we're being destroyed when God is never
[1:04:46] destroying us amen he is always trying
[1:04:49] to get what's inside of us to come out
[1:04:52] of us
[1:04:54] his light his nature his virtue his
[1:04:58] characteristics
[1:05:01] sometimes it literally sometimes it
[1:05:04] feels like God's trying to kill us
[1:05:07] I don't know if you've ever felt that
[1:05:08] way but I felt that way
[1:05:10] I felt like God is literally destroying
[1:05:13] me
[1:05:14] but then I look back and say that's the
[1:05:16] best thing that ever happened to me the
[1:05:18] outer man needed to be crushed needed to
[1:05:20] be destroyed that was my handicap that
[1:05:23] but what was God trying to do not
[1:05:25] destroy me he was trying to bring
[1:05:28] something out of me that would overcome
[1:05:30] the situation
[1:05:33] when God allowed a child to come and hit
[1:05:36] job
[1:05:37] God knew what was in job
[1:05:40] gone God wasn't trying to destroy job
[1:05:43] but God knew what laid inside of job and
[1:05:46] he knew that job was a genuine believer
[1:05:48] in a son and he knew that the trial amen
[1:05:50] would not destroy job but job's Faith
[1:05:53] would go on display
[1:05:54] and that's what happened in the trial
[1:05:56] that job's Faith went on display but God
[1:05:59] as always is accomplishing multiple
[1:06:01] things in one trial he's not ever just
[1:06:03] accomplishing one thing he's
[1:06:05] accomplishing multiple things
[1:06:07] and you can see in Job that he's doing
[1:06:09] multiple things and Joe excuse me
[1:06:13] and job I wrote this down he's
[1:06:15] accomplishing these two things I take
[1:06:16] note of he's probably doing way more
[1:06:17] than two but just two that I want to
[1:06:19] make note of
[1:06:20] he was manifesting the faith that was in
[1:06:23] job
[1:06:24] God knew it was there
[1:06:26] he knew that he could he could throw job
[1:06:29] in front of the devil
[1:06:32] and Satan comes before God and he says
[1:06:35] have you considered my servant job
[1:06:37] there is none like him in all the Earth
[1:06:41] why would God do such a thing like that
[1:06:44] is because he knew what was in job
[1:06:46] even if job had doubts God was endowing
[1:06:49] if job may have been unsure God was sure
[1:06:54] and God wasn't there to destroy job God
[1:06:57] was there to do things he was there to
[1:06:59] manifest a son of God
[1:07:03] but job also had a fear
[1:07:06] and he said that was great I greatly
[1:07:08] feared his come upon me
[1:07:10] and job also had a question
[1:07:13] and what was job's question Joe's
[1:07:15] question was what happens to a man after
[1:07:17] he dies
[1:07:18] I see the tree come back I see the plant
[1:07:20] happened but what happens to the man all
[1:07:21] his children gather around they look at
[1:07:23] his grave What Becomes of a man
[1:07:25] so job has a question and and in one
[1:07:28] dark period of job's life God brings the
[1:07:32] manifestation of the faith of a Son of
[1:07:34] God to the Forefront
[1:07:36] and despite of all of opposition he
[1:07:38] doesn't lose his faith
[1:07:41] but then God also makes job come face to
[1:07:45] face with what he feared most losing
[1:07:48] everything losing his health losing his
[1:07:49] becoming poor moving into poverty losing
[1:07:53] reputation job lost everything that a
[1:07:56] human could lose
[1:07:58] lost his health and lost his
[1:08:00] relationship with his wife lost his
[1:08:01] children lost his reputation in
[1:08:03] community lost all of his wealth
[1:08:06] but he never lost his faith
[1:08:08] what was more valuable
[1:08:10] all those things are Faith
[1:08:16] and job God
[1:08:19] made job face
[1:08:21] his fear
[1:08:24] so that God could be the provider to
[1:08:27] overcome job's fear
[1:08:31] so many things happen to us
[1:08:34] amen and sometimes we have to face the
[1:08:36] very thing we fear
[1:08:39] we have to face
[1:08:41] losing reputation we have to face losing
[1:08:44] wealth sometimes we have to face
[1:08:46] whatever we have to face
[1:08:48] God will bring a child to allow us to
[1:08:50] face it so that that fear doesn't
[1:08:53] control us the rest of our lives
[1:08:56] so that we're not motivated and pushed
[1:08:58] around and controlled by that fear
[1:09:01] fear of never attaining fear of being
[1:09:03] rejected you know if you have a fear of
[1:09:05] rejection God is going to allow you to
[1:09:07] be rejected
[1:09:09] you say oh God how could you let this
[1:09:11] happen to me it's the best thing that
[1:09:12] ever happened to you because you've got
[1:09:14] to get over that fear of rejection so
[1:09:16] that that fear doesn't control you all
[1:09:18] of your life
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:21] fear of not being accepted fear of not
[1:09:24] being good enough fear of losing
[1:09:26] something fear of never attaining
[1:09:28] something amen these trials that we go
[1:09:31] through they're for our perfection
[1:09:34] sometimes we'll have to face the very
[1:09:36] thing we fear we fear losing our family
[1:09:38] so the family will go through a horrible
[1:09:40] trial
[1:09:44] amen
[1:09:46] look at job
[1:09:49] had a question
[1:09:51] but all through the trial job received a
[1:09:55] revelation
[1:09:56] and that Revelation answered her
[1:09:58] question he said though the skin worms
[1:10:00] destroyed this flesh yet in my flesh I
[1:10:03] shall see
[1:10:05] and then once job passed through the
[1:10:07] darkness of the child God restored
[1:10:10] two-fold everything that job lost so now
[1:10:13] amen job had wealth and abundance he had
[1:10:16] abundance of wealth before but now he
[1:10:18] has double everything that he lost amen
[1:10:20] but now job has an abundance of wealth
[1:10:23] without the fear of losing the wealth
[1:10:29] praise be to God
[1:10:33] brother man says in the message I know
[1:10:36] he said and why does God let troubles
[1:10:38] come
[1:10:39] God harnesses trouble puts bits in his
[1:10:42] mouth and makes it obey him and those
[1:10:43] troubles bring us into a closer
[1:10:45] fellowship with God
[1:10:47] there had been no rainbow until the
[1:10:49] flood came
[1:10:51] but after Noah was pressed into that
[1:10:53] condition that he was in to float 40
[1:10:55] days and nights in a storm and the
[1:10:57] little Ark pitching up and down on the
[1:10:59] water it was after the flood was over
[1:11:00] that he saw the rainbow for its first
[1:11:02] time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant
[1:11:04] of Promise after he went through the
[1:11:06] tribulation then he saw the promise
[1:11:10] not before after
[1:11:13] that's the way you see the Promise after
[1:11:15] you've gone through the tribulation I've
[1:11:17] liked that poem or so must I be carried
[1:11:19] home to heaven on a flowery bed of these
[1:11:21] While others fought to win the prize and
[1:11:23] sailed through bloody Seas
[1:11:25] we asked for comfort and peace God gives
[1:11:27] us the best that he could give us trials
[1:11:30] and tribulations that's better than
[1:11:32] comfort and peace our comfort is just
[1:11:35] beyond the river
[1:11:37] most of you know because I've said it
[1:11:38] several times this is my favorite quote
[1:11:40] in all the message
[1:11:43] why is that brother Chad because it
[1:11:44] makes sense of my life
[1:11:49] amen I begin to realize that God is
[1:11:51] always for me
[1:11:53] he's always trying to bring me into my
[1:11:55] position
[1:11:57] and that my trials oh I'm going to say
[1:12:00] something here but just listen my trials
[1:12:03] are promotions
[1:12:06] God is trying to promote me in the Life
[1:12:10] of Christ
[1:12:12] amen the devil is trying to get me to
[1:12:15] take a demotion by taking self-love
[1:12:18] guarding my reputation getting me to
[1:12:21] follow Pleasures to have my desire amen
[1:12:25] that looks like the devil's trying to
[1:12:27] make you look like he's lifting you up
[1:12:28] but what he's doing is he's pushing you
[1:12:30] down
[1:12:31] because the Way Up Is Down
[1:12:33] so God will allow you to go down because
[1:12:36] it's his mechanism for promotion
[1:12:43] look at Moses Moses mother all his life
[1:12:45] told him you're a deliverer you're a
[1:12:47] deliverer you're a deliverer and he
[1:12:48] believed her
[1:12:50] you were born a proper child you were
[1:12:52] born under a sign you're a deliverer
[1:12:53] it's time for the prophecy to come
[1:12:55] fulfilled and you're the one and he
[1:12:57] believed it and he went out and in his
[1:12:59] own strength and his own Desire with all
[1:13:01] his own efforts amen he killed an
[1:13:03] Egyptian amen and then run into trouble
[1:13:04] with his own countrymen and he ran away
[1:13:07] amen and he ran away and became nothing
[1:13:10] he lost his reputation he lost his
[1:13:13] position he lost his power Prestige his
[1:13:15] money his good name he lost everything
[1:13:20] until he began to doubt whether he was
[1:13:23] even capable
[1:13:25] of being God so when God would come to
[1:13:27] him to put him in his commission amen
[1:13:29] God what was God doing God was trying to
[1:13:32] get him to fulfill the promise but he
[1:13:34] couldn't fulfill the promise and pride
[1:13:36] and arrogancy and self
[1:13:39] self self ability you know what I mean
[1:13:43] so God couldn't God couldn't use him in
[1:13:46] that condition to bring forth the
[1:13:47] promise of a deliverer God had to allow
[1:13:50] him to become nothing so that God could
[1:13:52] promote him into the office that Moses
[1:13:54] had
[1:13:56] Moses could never promote himself but
[1:13:58] the way up was down for Moses
[1:14:02] and God would take him from nothing
[1:14:05] and he would bring and and God I mean
[1:14:08] God did such a good job of Moses that
[1:14:10] when God come to tell Moses it's time
[1:14:12] and you're the one Moses says I can't do
[1:14:13] it I can't speak get somebody else
[1:14:16] you're making a mistake God
[1:14:18] so much so he argued with God until God
[1:14:20] was angry with him
[1:14:24] he had become nothing
[1:14:26] what was it it was his promotion
[1:14:30] God couldn't take him from where he was
[1:14:32] to deliver he had to take him from where
[1:14:35] he was and strip away all self
[1:14:38] from Moses and when he strip away self
[1:14:40] he could promote him this was God's
[1:14:42] promotion
[1:14:46] God help us to see our trials the right
[1:14:48] way
[1:14:54] we'll read the last part of this quote
[1:14:56] from the message I know he says it
[1:14:57] wasn't until the Hebrew children was
[1:14:59] forced into the fiery furnace
[1:15:01] on one of their most outstanding trials
[1:15:03] and they seen one like the Son of God
[1:15:05] standing among them their troubles
[1:15:07] produced the son of God
[1:15:12] their troubles produce the Son of God
[1:15:14] standing among them in the breezes to
[1:15:16] wave away the heat wave but not until
[1:15:18] they went into the fire did the
[1:15:19] comforter appear
[1:15:21] what are their troubles produced the son
[1:15:23] of God
[1:15:24] where amen where when things were good
[1:15:28] when they were held in respect when they
[1:15:29] had offices in the government that
[1:15:31] didn't produce the Son of God what
[1:15:33] produced the son of God a hard trial A
[1:15:36] desperate situation an impossible
[1:15:38] situation that they couldn't save
[1:15:40] themselves from but they held true to
[1:15:42] Faith they would not deny the word and
[1:15:45] when they would not deny the word under
[1:15:47] the squeeze and under the pressure It
[1:15:49] produced the son of God
[1:15:53] what they could not produce before was
[1:15:56] produced in the worst of times
[1:16:00] amen
[1:16:03] we should not fear
[1:16:05] troubles
[1:16:09] you know
[1:16:12] if we look at the life of Joseph we all
[1:16:14] know the life of Joseph really well but
[1:16:16] Joseph had a dream and in the dream he
[1:16:18] dreamed two dreams but they were both
[1:16:20] about the same thing and in the dream
[1:16:23] Joseph's mother and father and all his
[1:16:25] brother and bowed down to him he was
[1:16:27] exalted and they did obscence they bowed
[1:16:31] to him showing that he would have
[1:16:33] rulership over them
[1:16:35] and his brothers hated him
[1:16:37] for this dream because this dream was a
[1:16:39] prophecy
[1:16:41] and the prophecy showed Joseph that
[1:16:44] you're going to be exalted over your
[1:16:46] brethren and they're going to bow to you
[1:16:49] my goodness I'd love to receive a
[1:16:51] prophecy like that
[1:16:53] everybody's going to bounce you you're
[1:16:55] going to be the head over everybody my
[1:16:57] that sounds good I don't know what
[1:16:59] Joseph thought when he had that as a as
[1:17:01] a teenage boy amen but if he's a human
[1:17:04] being he must have thought wow this is
[1:17:06] going to be amazing
[1:17:08] and the truth is it is going to be
[1:17:09] amazing but it wasn't going to happen
[1:17:11] the way Joseph thought it was going to
[1:17:12] happen the path to the throne wasn't the
[1:17:15] path that he would have predicted
[1:17:18] so so God Amen used the prophecy to turn
[1:17:22] the hearts of his brothers against him
[1:17:24] so that they would hate him
[1:17:26] then when they begin to hate him they
[1:17:28] rejected him and then the rejection amen
[1:17:30] they sold him out amen they betrayed her
[1:17:32] brother and sold him into slave and in
[1:17:35] slavery he goes down into Egypt amen how
[1:17:38] is he ever going to exalt to the throne
[1:17:40] if he stays up in Palestine he's got to
[1:17:42] get to Egypt how's he going to get to
[1:17:44] Egypt the Way Up Is Down
[1:17:48] I we we read stories in the Bible and
[1:17:51] we're so good at reading stories but the
[1:17:52] prophet of God Has Come Along on our
[1:17:54] generation and he's made the stories
[1:17:55] real he made the people human he made
[1:17:58] the light he made the agony and the
[1:18:00] feeling and the heartache and the joy he
[1:18:02] made it tangible
[1:18:04] and can you imagine Joseph loved of his
[1:18:07] father amen now the sudden he's hated of
[1:18:09] his brother he didn't want his brothers
[1:18:10] to hate him he wanted to love his
[1:18:12] brothers he wanted the respect and
[1:18:13] admiration of his brothers
[1:18:15] he wanted to stay with his family and
[1:18:16] the love of his family and now they hate
[1:18:18] him now they despise him now they sell
[1:18:20] him now he's with a group of a million
[1:18:22] nights now he's on his way to Egypt he's
[1:18:24] a he's a teenage boy he doesn't know
[1:18:26] where he's going he doesn't know what's
[1:18:27] happening to him language is different
[1:18:29] Customs are different everything's
[1:18:31] different and now he finds himself in a
[1:18:32] slave market on the Block being
[1:18:34] auctioned off
[1:18:36] how would you feel
[1:18:38] would you feel like everything was going
[1:18:40] according to God's plan
[1:18:47] I'm I'm sure along this journey
[1:18:50] I may be wrong this is just me don't put
[1:18:53] any Credence on it
[1:18:54] but I just wonder if he ever said
[1:18:57] I thought God showed me
[1:19:04] I wonder if he ever had that thought Pat
[1:19:06] I thought I understood that dream I
[1:19:09] thought God showed me
[1:19:15] Elijah was a man of like passions like
[1:19:17] me
[1:19:21] and then you know things turn around a
[1:19:24] little bit and Potiphar's house he gets
[1:19:26] a little bit of privilege a little bit
[1:19:27] of authority
[1:19:28] things are going okay
[1:19:30] and then another deception in another
[1:19:32] round of Lies
[1:19:34] moving not just in slavery now now he
[1:19:38] goes to prison
[1:19:41] from hated rejection to slavery to
[1:19:44] bondage in Egypt now from bondage in
[1:19:46] Egypt now by more deception and more
[1:19:48] lies and more rejection
[1:19:51] what was he rejected for doing what was
[1:19:53] right
[1:19:55] what was he rejected from his brothers
[1:19:57] for for telling the truth
[1:19:59] of no fault of his own he finds himself
[1:20:01] in this situations and now he's in
[1:20:03] prison and in prison now he's there and
[1:20:06] and now it seems like he's further than
[1:20:09] he's ever been from the prophecy
[1:20:13] but don't ever forget the Way Up Is Down
[1:20:17] and now he goes from Palestine through
[1:20:20] hatred through Envy through Strife amen
[1:20:23] through rejection he winds up in Egypt
[1:20:25] that's where he needed to be for the
[1:20:27] prophecy
[1:20:29] from Egypt he goes from Potiphar's house
[1:20:31] and slavery now he goes down to the
[1:20:33] dungeon because he's got to get closer
[1:20:35] to Pharaoh than what he was and now he's
[1:20:37] right underneath the throne
[1:20:42] can you imagine what was passing through
[1:20:44] Joseph's mind
[1:20:46] oh if if Joseph was a man of like
[1:20:49] passions like me
[1:20:51] I can tell you there had been a thousand
[1:20:53] questions rolling through my mind
[1:20:55] I would have been bouncing from one day
[1:20:57] not losing the promise of the other day
[1:20:59] wondering if I even heard from God
[1:21:08] and now we find a butler and a baker
[1:21:12] they get sent to prison they have a
[1:21:15] dream and his gift is still operating in
[1:21:17] prison
[1:21:18] and in prison so far away from the
[1:21:22] prophecy so far away from what he
[1:21:25] thought God had showed him
[1:21:28] he finds the Butler and the baker with
[1:21:30] the dream and he gives the
[1:21:31] interpretation of the dream and one will
[1:21:33] be restored and the other one's going to
[1:21:35] be killed and it happens exactly like he
[1:21:37] said but he asked the one that was going
[1:21:39] to be restored when you get restored
[1:21:41] your place would you please speak on my
[1:21:44] behalf to pharaoh
[1:21:46] and he says I will I will I Hey listen
[1:21:49] buddy you saved me you gave me the right
[1:21:51] I'm here for you
[1:21:54] then when he gets restored to his
[1:21:55] position what does he do he forgets
[1:21:58] about Joseph he he's now amen now that
[1:22:02] this man is restored to his position he
[1:22:04] forgets Joseph he forgets the one who
[1:22:06] interpret his dream he forgets the
[1:22:07] prophet that's down there in prison he
[1:22:09] forgets all of it amen but I'd like to
[1:22:11] tell you he was ordained to forget God
[1:22:14] erased his mind amen it wasn't that the
[1:22:17] baker or the butler who I think it was
[1:22:19] the butler it wasn't that the butler was
[1:22:21] against Joseph it was that God was for
[1:22:23] Joseph and had to erase his mind amen
[1:22:26] because that wasn't the time if you get
[1:22:28] things out of sequence it never works
[1:22:31] out right
[1:22:32] if he would have spoke for him on that
[1:22:34] day he might have got out of prison but
[1:22:35] he would have never went to the right
[1:22:36] hand of the throne it had to come a time
[1:22:39] when Pharaoh needed a prophecy he needed
[1:22:42] a dream interpreted and God wiped out
[1:22:45] the memory of the baker or the butler
[1:22:51] listen has anybody ever forgot a promise
[1:22:54] to you
[1:22:55] has anybody ever failed to keep the word
[1:22:57] to you
[1:22:58] has anybody ever rejected you
[1:23:01] did anybody ever tell a lie about you
[1:23:05] well praise God
[1:23:07] well praise God
[1:23:12] did Brothers Branham say or did he not
[1:23:14] say nothing's out of kilter everything
[1:23:18] clock's just ticking right on time all
[1:23:21] these things has to be this way
[1:23:25] hey that's either true or it's not true
[1:23:31] the lies
[1:23:32] were necessary
[1:23:34] the rejection was necessary the
[1:23:37] deception was necessary the framing was
[1:23:41] necessary the forgetfulness was
[1:23:43] necessary
[1:23:46] Joseph has an option he can either rot
[1:23:49] away in bitterness
[1:23:52] or he can trust God
[1:23:55] you and I have the same option listen
[1:23:59] sometimes not sometimes all the time if
[1:24:03] God needs to move us into position do
[1:24:04] you think he's only going to use
[1:24:06] positive things and move as a position
[1:24:08] do you think he may also use negative
[1:24:09] things to move us into position
[1:24:14] amen
[1:24:19] you know why they wear Spurs right you
[1:24:21] know why a cowboy wears Spurs
[1:24:24] so he can dig those spurs into the
[1:24:26] flanks of the horse and encourage the
[1:24:27] horse to go forward
[1:24:30] it doesn't feel good
[1:24:33] but it's necessary to get the horse to
[1:24:35] move in the right direction
[1:24:38] amen he told Paul it's hard for you to
[1:24:41] kick against the bricks
[1:24:43] what's the prick something God's using
[1:24:45] to move us along
[1:24:54] so now he's a forgotten friend
[1:24:57] in prison
[1:24:59] serves people does the best he can in
[1:25:01] every situation and now he's forgotten
[1:25:04] left into the dungeon his friend is
[1:25:06] promoted and he's left behind and his
[1:25:08] friend doesn't remember him
[1:25:10] but there come a day that Pharaoh
[1:25:12] Dreamed a Dream
[1:25:14] when he Dreamed a Dream there was nobody
[1:25:16] that could tell it no magician nobody in
[1:25:19] all the kingdom
[1:25:21] and it happened to be that that day when
[1:25:24] nobody can interpret that all of a
[1:25:27] sudden the baker's memory comes back
[1:25:31] he goes now I remember oh Pharaoh I
[1:25:35] forgot I was supposed to tell you this a
[1:25:37] long time ago
[1:25:39] there's a man down there in that dungeon
[1:25:41] and this is what happened and this and
[1:25:42] he said call him up they call him up
[1:25:44] they shaved him they gave him a garment
[1:25:46] gave him a shower amen he comes before
[1:25:48] Pharaoh why because that was the
[1:25:50] appointed moment that was the appointed
[1:25:52] time he couldn't get there before then
[1:25:53] but what did he had to do he had to get
[1:25:55] to Egypt God made sure he got to Egypt
[1:25:57] amen it didn't feel good it didn't look
[1:25:59] good but God got him to Egypt from Egypt
[1:26:01] he had to get to the dungeon and God got
[1:26:03] him from Egypt to the dungeon and from
[1:26:04] the dungeon he had to wait there and be
[1:26:06] there close to Pharaoh for the time that
[1:26:08] Pharaoh needed an interpretation to his
[1:26:10] dream
[1:26:12] because God was going to take him from
[1:26:14] the dungeon
[1:26:15] to the right hand of power
[1:26:19] and overnight
[1:26:21] overnight
[1:26:24] he moves from the dungeon to the right
[1:26:26] hand of power
[1:26:28] amen this is what Joseph says to his
[1:26:31] brother and after his dad dies
[1:26:33] they're worried that after Israel's dead
[1:26:36] that now he's going to get his revenge
[1:26:37] and Joseph said unto them fear not for I
[1:26:40] am in the place of God
[1:26:44] but as for you ye thought evil against
[1:26:47] me but God meant it unto good to bring
[1:26:51] to pass as at this day to save much
[1:26:54] people alive
[1:26:56] can it be that people's people's evil
[1:26:59] intentions towards you is God's Good
[1:27:01] Will towards you
[1:27:03] is that the scriptures
[1:27:05] so we see that it's very possible that
[1:27:08] somebody's evil intentions about you
[1:27:10] could be God's Good Will towards you
[1:27:14] that God means it for good they mean it
[1:27:17] for you and they do mean it for evil in
[1:27:19] all intention his brother's been it for
[1:27:21] evil
[1:27:22] but God meant it for good
[1:27:29] listen we're going to have a choice in
[1:27:31] life friends
[1:27:32] we're going to choose to be eat up in
[1:27:34] bitterness
[1:27:35] and hate everything that happened to us
[1:27:36] and hate everybody who did us wrong or
[1:27:38] we're going to finally get to the place
[1:27:39] to say I'm in the place of God
[1:27:42] amen it was an ugly Road it had lots of
[1:27:44] up and down I went from high places to
[1:27:46] Low Places and Low Places to high places
[1:27:48] and back again I've had detours I've had
[1:27:51] confusions I've had Church splits I've
[1:27:52] had failed Ministry I've had all kinds
[1:27:55] of troubles in my life but I all I know
[1:27:57] is I am now in the place of God how I
[1:28:00] got here is a mystery to me but I'm in
[1:28:02] the place of God and God watched over my
[1:28:05] steps because the steps of a righteous
[1:28:07] man are ordered of the Lord and he
[1:28:08] delighteth in his way
[1:28:12] as if we can come to the place where we
[1:28:14] can say I'm in the place of God but my
[1:28:16] mother rejected me my father abused me
[1:28:18] somebody took advantage of me listen it
[1:28:21] doesn't matter are you in the place of
[1:28:23] God Amen has God got a plan for your
[1:28:25] life everything else could have been
[1:28:26] chaos all around you but what is
[1:28:29] different from your life than the
[1:28:30] characters in The Bible
[1:28:34] amen
[1:28:37] then we can find ourselves in the place
[1:28:39] of God through rejection through abuse
[1:28:41] through neglect through highs through
[1:28:43] lows through promotion through devotion
[1:28:45] through all of that if we can find
[1:28:47] ourselves in the place of God then we
[1:28:49] can look back and say it was all meant
[1:28:51] for good God was leading God knew what
[1:28:53] he was doing God knew how to get me to
[1:28:55] the place I was
[1:28:57] amen God knew what the Apostle Paul
[1:29:00] needed to keep him from being puffed up
[1:29:02] with pride he knew that he needed a
[1:29:05] messenger of the devil and affliction in
[1:29:07] his eye and you know he sought the Lord
[1:29:09] three times because his Affliction was
[1:29:10] somewhat debilitating to him amen but he
[1:29:13] realized that God says my grace is
[1:29:15] sufficient for you this was given to you
[1:29:17] so that you would not be puffed up and
[1:29:19] he says well I'll therefore glory in my
[1:29:21] affirmities
[1:29:23] we think this isn't right this can't be
[1:29:26] right this shouldn't happen to me I
[1:29:27] shouldn't be in this condition
[1:29:31] God knows what we need
[1:29:33] God knows what his children needs
[1:29:36] God knows I shouldn't be like this this
[1:29:38] shouldn't have happened to me
[1:29:42] but I say oh God
[1:29:45] I'm in the place of God
[1:29:47] where would I be if everything had been
[1:29:50] smooth in life
[1:29:51] where would I be if I had no Affliction
[1:29:53] what kind of person would I be if I
[1:29:55] never suffered rejection and had to go
[1:29:57] search my soul and find out where I was
[1:30:00] if I hadn't had doubts if I hadn't had
[1:30:02] confusion if I hadn't been knocked down
[1:30:04] a few times what kind of human being
[1:30:06] would I be
[1:30:07] what kind of character would I display
[1:30:09] amen where would I find The Virtue to
[1:30:12] keep going where would I find the
[1:30:13] strength where would revelation of God
[1:30:15] Christ come where would it come if it
[1:30:17] wasn't under those deep dark times those
[1:30:20] pressing times and we find when we get
[1:30:22] into those pressing times that squeeze
[1:30:24] us amen listen there may be a squeeze
[1:30:27] coming but we've all felt squeezes in
[1:30:29] our life
[1:30:31] and those squeezing times what was it
[1:30:33] supposed to do it was supposed to bring
[1:30:35] the Life of Christ out
[1:30:39] I'll ask you this the greatest
[1:30:41] testimonies in your life that they come
[1:30:43] from Good Times or bad times
[1:30:46] the times that you know God moved and
[1:30:48] you know God answered and you can see
[1:30:50] God vindicate himself was that good
[1:30:52] times or dark times where those easy
[1:30:54] times are trouble sometimes
[1:30:57] I'm just asking
[1:31:01] our trials are promotions
[1:31:05] what's God doing our duty is to express
[1:31:09] God
[1:31:11] how am I going to express God how am I
[1:31:13] going to show virtue unless I'm going to
[1:31:16] need some virtue
[1:31:17] how am I going to show Temperance unless
[1:31:19] I'm going to need in this situation I'm
[1:31:21] going to need some self-control
[1:31:24] it's going to show love unless there's a
[1:31:25] situation that needs love
[1:31:29] where will we show The Life of Christ in
[1:31:32] opposition to the Life of Christ
[1:31:35] my duty
[1:31:37] Express God
[1:31:39] how am I going to do that
[1:31:41] when your squeeze comes down
[1:31:44] then you'll see Christ
[1:31:47] when the squeeze comes down
[1:31:50] there's times there's things that we
[1:31:52] don't really know about ourselves
[1:31:55] we can make bold proclamations people
[1:31:58] are human beings are good I'm this I'm
[1:32:00] that Peter he looks at Jesus and says
[1:32:02] though all men forsake you
[1:32:05] I'll not leave thee
[1:32:08] you look at Peter and say oh Peter
[1:32:10] but my goodness I've got to look at
[1:32:12] myself and say oh Chad you foolish human
[1:32:15] being
[1:32:17] You childish human that lets foolish
[1:32:19] things come out of your mouth
[1:32:22] everybody does this I'm not you don't
[1:32:25] know what you'll do until that time
[1:32:27] comes
[1:32:30] you may feel like now your emotions may
[1:32:32] tell you one thing and you may feel so
[1:32:35] strong and so bold but listen there's a
[1:32:37] lot of people that thought they'd never
[1:32:38] leave this message that don't believe
[1:32:39] brother Branham was a prophet right now
[1:32:46] if we're ever going to be anything it's
[1:32:48] going to be him
[1:32:49] in US
[1:32:51] it's going to be his life his seed his
[1:32:54] Gene of life manifesting itself through
[1:32:56] us
[1:33:00] God Jesus looks at Peter says Peter
[1:33:03] Satan has desired to Sifty like wheat
[1:33:06] he didn't say I prayed to the father so
[1:33:08] that you can bypass that trial no Peter
[1:33:10] needed to be sifted like wheat because
[1:33:12] Peter had way too much self-confidence
[1:33:15] way too much pride he was way too
[1:33:16] arrogant and he felt like he could do
[1:33:18] something
[1:33:19] and he displayed how self-confident he
[1:33:21] was when he drew his sword and tried to
[1:33:23] kill the servant of the high priest he
[1:33:24] was showing how proud and arrogant and
[1:33:26] how self-sufficient that he was amen and
[1:33:28] Jesus didn't say his Satan has desired
[1:33:31] that's asking permission Satan has
[1:33:33] desire to Sifty like we he didn't tell
[1:33:35] him no he said go ahead but I've prayed
[1:33:37] for you that your faith failed not
[1:33:42] Peter needed to be sifted he needed to
[1:33:44] be humbled he needed to run out and weep
[1:33:47] on his face and cry and repent
[1:33:54] what do we need we need the same thing
[1:33:57] we need to be knocked off of our high
[1:33:58] horse like Paul was knocked off of his
[1:34:00] high horse
[1:34:01] we need to be smoked we need to be
[1:34:03] afflicted
[1:34:04] why because there's too much pride in
[1:34:07] the human race there's too much
[1:34:09] self-sufficiency too much arrogancy amen
[1:34:11] every time we start feeling like we got
[1:34:13] our act together we can figure this out
[1:34:14] we know what to do God will stick his
[1:34:17] foot out and trip you so you fall and
[1:34:19] bust your nose come up with a bloody
[1:34:20] nose and you realize I can't even walk
[1:34:22] unless he leads to you
[1:34:25] and that busted nose is the best thing
[1:34:28] that ever happened to you or I
[1:34:31] oh my goodness this is hard this is re
[1:34:36] ese the real people in a real world and
[1:34:38] it's really going to overcome by the
[1:34:40] grace of God by predestination not by
[1:34:42] human effort not by human willpower not
[1:34:45] by our brains and our will and all I I
[1:34:47] am so tired of an arrogant attitude in
[1:34:51] me
[1:34:52] I'm so tired of fighting with pride all
[1:34:55] the time I am so sick of it amen I say
[1:34:58] God help me help me Lord to stay humble
[1:35:01] to stay nothing so that you can be
[1:35:03] something
[1:35:08] Peter goes from I'll never forsake you
[1:35:10] oh men oh men leave you alone I mean
[1:35:14] what's he saying is he showing his love
[1:35:16] for God no he's showing his arrogancy
[1:35:17] his pride in himself
[1:35:20] it looked religious it looked like love
[1:35:23] it was self-love on display
[1:35:30] to finally God has a broken man
[1:35:33] that will humble himself and that it
[1:35:36] will repent
[1:35:37] before Gone
[1:35:40] when he has a repentant broken man then
[1:35:42] he can fill that man with the Holy Ghost
[1:35:44] and he can take him out to the gate
[1:35:46] called beautiful and he can speak in the
[1:35:48] name of Jesus Christ and that man can go
[1:35:49] leaping and running and and then all can
[1:35:51] gather around and they begin they begin
[1:35:53] to praise uh they can begin to praise
[1:35:56] Peter and Peter will say why look you
[1:35:58] upon us as though we in our strength
[1:36:00] have healed this man we haven't done
[1:36:01] anything but in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:36:03] who you crucified this man as him it's
[1:36:06] not us it's Christ
[1:36:07] oh what did Peter need Peter needed to
[1:36:11] be sifted like wheat Peter needed to
[1:36:13] fall Peter needed to repent
[1:36:17] what do we need we need everything God
[1:36:20] has ordained for us
[1:36:22] so that we can come to perfection
[1:36:31] I mean it's even hard to shout
[1:36:32] hallelujah because you know what's
[1:36:33] coming next
[1:36:36] but it's the reality
[1:36:39] it's what we need the Way Up Is Down
[1:36:43] God help us
[1:36:45] let's go to Genesis 45 I want to read
[1:36:48] this as we close Genesis 45.
[1:36:51] thank you
[1:36:58] Genesis 45
[1:37:00] verse 1.
[1:37:04] then Joseph could not refrain himself
[1:37:06] before all them that stood by him and he
[1:37:08] cried because ever caused caused every
[1:37:12] man to go out for men there stood no man
[1:37:14] with him while Joseph made himself known
[1:37:16] unto his Brethren and he wept aloud and
[1:37:18] the Egyptians in the house of pharaoh
[1:37:19] heard Joseph said unto his brother I am
[1:37:22] Joseph does my father yet live and his
[1:37:25] Brethren could not answer him for they
[1:37:26] were troubled at his presence
[1:37:28] and Joseph said unto his Brethren come
[1:37:30] near to me I pray you and they came near
[1:37:33] and he said I am Joseph your brother
[1:37:35] whom ye sold in into Egypt now therefore
[1:37:38] be not grieved nor angry with yourselves
[1:37:40] that you sold me hither for God didn't
[1:37:43] send me before you to preserve life
[1:37:47] listen did it did he make his brothers
[1:37:50] apologize to him before he forgave them
[1:37:56] did he demand they grovel at his feet
[1:38:01] do you see our horrible attitudes
[1:38:04] we say well I'll not forget until they
[1:38:06] come and apologize
[1:38:07] no brother bear said forgive them
[1:38:09] anyways
[1:38:10] don't require anything of them Joseph
[1:38:12] had such a revelation that he was in the
[1:38:14] place of God that that prophecy that he
[1:38:17] saw as a dream as a boy every step was
[1:38:19] moving him that problem he was so
[1:38:21] assured of his position and where he was
[1:38:23] now he could look back and say don't you
[1:38:25] worry about it don't you even feel bad
[1:38:28] about yourselves
[1:38:31] can you say that to the one who rejected
[1:38:33] you can you say that to the one who lied
[1:38:34] about you the one who ruined your
[1:38:36] reputation can you say that about them
[1:38:40] I say of not we need a greater
[1:38:42] revelation of where God has brought us
[1:38:43] and who we are we need a revelation that
[1:38:45] we're in the place of God
[1:38:49] let's keep reading
[1:38:51] I want to read five again B now
[1:38:53] therefore be not grieved nor angry with
[1:38:55] yourselves that you sold me hither for
[1:38:56] God did send me before you to preserve
[1:38:58] life
[1:38:59] for these two years hath the famine been
[1:39:01] in the land and yet there are five years
[1:39:03] in which there shall neither be earring
[1:39:05] nor Harvest and God sent me before you
[1:39:07] to preserve you of posterity in the
[1:39:09] earth and to save your lives by a great
[1:39:11] Deliverance so now it was not you that
[1:39:14] sent me hither but God
[1:39:16] and he hath made me a father to pharaoh
[1:39:18] and Lord of all his house and I ruler
[1:39:20] throughout all the land of Egypt
[1:39:23] it wasn't you it was God
[1:39:27] amen it wasn't you who moved me it
[1:39:30] wasn't you who caused this it wasn't you
[1:39:32] it was God
[1:39:36] Romans 8 28 says and we know that all
[1:39:39] things work together for good
[1:39:42] to them who love God to them who are the
[1:39:44] called according to his purpose
[1:39:47] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[1:39:49] says
[1:39:50] now there is only one thing can happen
[1:39:53] there has to be a message
[1:39:55] at the end time when there is nothing
[1:39:57] else can follow it and now the
[1:39:59] ecumenical world has set up such a
[1:40:00] regime that there can be no
[1:40:01] denominations and and no not nothing
[1:40:03] else follow it you're either in it or
[1:40:05] you're not in it the fruit is in the top
[1:40:07] of the tree and the light is shining on
[1:40:09] the predestinated fruit and she is
[1:40:11] ripening into christ-like Fruit bringing
[1:40:14] forth to say mellowness and sweetness
[1:40:16] and the same spirit that he had in him
[1:40:22] what is my duty to bear his name
[1:40:26] how am I going to bear his name and
[1:40:29] promote my name at the same time
[1:40:32] how am I going to seek my welfare my
[1:40:34] reputation my promotion and promote his
[1:40:37] name
[1:40:39] I'm going to have to become nothing
[1:40:41] and nobody and when I'm having a hard
[1:40:44] time doing that God knows how to help me
[1:40:48] when I'm having a hard time losing my
[1:40:51] reputation God knows how to help me
[1:40:54] and I have a hard time giving up my
[1:40:57] image giving up my desires giving up my
[1:41:00] pleasure God knows listen
[1:41:03] when you hit a really hard time in life
[1:41:05] I mean a hard hard time where you don't
[1:41:08] know if you're going to make it through
[1:41:09] or not when disaster strikes your family
[1:41:11] distracts your life when you've heard
[1:41:13] news that you need to see no way out I
[1:41:15] tell you right then there's no desire
[1:41:17] for you in the pleasures you're not
[1:41:18] going to pick up a TV you're not going
[1:41:20] to go download this or that I mean what
[1:41:22] you're going to do is hit your knees and
[1:41:24] pray
[1:41:26] because that all desire for flesh and
[1:41:28] that desire it begins to fade away when
[1:41:30] it gets really down to the nitty-gritty
[1:41:34] God knows how to get us to pray
[1:41:45] God help me
[1:41:47] that's all I can say friends is God help
[1:41:49] me
[1:41:50] God help me to see my trials as
[1:41:52] promotions
[1:41:54] I don't want to run kicking and
[1:41:55] streaming and crazy like a crazy man
[1:41:57] every time something comes up I want to
[1:41:59] stand there and say God I'm your child
[1:42:03] and I'm in the place you place me and
[1:42:05] I'm going to wherever you want me to be
[1:42:07] help me to express your nature in this
[1:42:11] trial
[1:42:12] give me patience Give Me Faith give me
[1:42:14] virtue let let this trial produce more
[1:42:17] of you in my life God I need something
[1:42:19] more than myself because myself is
[1:42:21] scared myself is worried myself wants to
[1:42:24] run but I'm going to stand right here
[1:42:25] and Trust You amen would you express
[1:42:27] yourself through this body of Flesh
[1:42:30] when I die he can live
[1:42:34] amen the way up
[1:42:36] is down
[1:42:38] God bless you let's all stand musicians
[1:42:40] if you'll come please
[1:42:44] our trials are promotions and the
[1:42:48] development of a christ-like character
[1:42:51] the question is do we want a christ-like
[1:42:53] character
[1:42:55] foreign
[1:42:57] do we want to be like Jesus
[1:43:01] then hang on
[1:43:03] fasten your seatbelt
[1:43:04] it might be a bumpy ride
[1:43:08] because that nature has to be expressed
[1:43:11] in all kinds of opposition
[1:43:14] look at the opposition Jesus Christ had
[1:43:17] in order to express the nature that was
[1:43:18] in him tempted in every way yet without
[1:43:21] sin tempted and pride tempted in this
[1:43:25] and spit upon and mocked and all of
[1:43:27] these things
[1:43:29] my
[1:43:30] but you know what he passed the test
[1:43:33] I say God if that life be in me
[1:43:37] if I can stay out of the way and
[1:43:38] surrender by the power of your spirit
[1:43:40] you can live the same life through me
[1:43:42] help me God
[1:43:45] amen if the squeeze starts coming down a
[1:43:47] little bit just recognize what he's
[1:43:50] after is fragrance
[1:43:52] what he's after is perfume not the
[1:43:55] destruction of Our Lives
[1:43:56] but the perfume that's laying trapped in
[1:43:59] the Rose God wants to come out
[1:44:02] amen he's given us his life he's given
[1:44:04] us his promise we have the sieging of
[1:44:06] God by the predestination and he knows
[1:44:09] how to draw that life and all that
[1:44:11] character out of us I said God allow it
[1:44:14] to work in me
[1:44:16] help me gone
[1:44:18] and you know what I want to say
[1:44:21] I've had some rough times
[1:44:23] I've had some things that I'd rather not
[1:44:25] happen in my life if I had some
[1:44:27] circumstances my fault and the fault of
[1:44:29] other people
[1:44:31] there's things that other people have
[1:44:32] done that have really hurt me
[1:44:35] there's things that I have done that
[1:44:37] have really hurt me
[1:44:38] there's things I have done that have
[1:44:40] really hurt other people
[1:44:43] there's things that I'm ashamed of
[1:44:45] and I regret with all my heart
[1:44:48] but I'll tell you something I'm in the
[1:44:50] place of God by the grace of God
[1:44:53] I'm here by his grace I'm here
[1:44:56] with the Revelation that he's given me
[1:44:57] through every trial and I'm here
[1:45:00] amen because he predestinated me to be
[1:45:03] here
[1:45:05] I say oh God I want to surrender all my
[1:45:09] life to you
[1:45:10] I don't want to be bitter I don't want
[1:45:12] to be angry
[1:45:14] I just want to be thankful
[1:45:16] that God can take everything the devil
[1:45:18] means for good and he can move it to his
[1:45:21] intended purpose for me
[1:45:23] that he can take everything that was
[1:45:24] meant to destroy me and he can bring me
[1:45:26] into my place
[1:45:28] I just thank him for that
[1:45:30] are you grateful for a God who can turn
[1:45:33] everything to good
[1:45:35] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[1:45:38] dear Lord Jesus we're so thankful Lord
[1:45:42] that you have given us precious promises
[1:45:45] promises Lord that we will have your
[1:45:48] very character your likeness that you
[1:45:50] will bring us into your very image
[1:45:52] you've promised that in this age this
[1:45:54] bride will be so much like you she will
[1:45:56] be in your very image
[1:45:58] that she will be you
[1:46:00] that your life will be in US Lord
[1:46:04] and that we will surrender and we will
[1:46:06] die and we will give up so that your
[1:46:08] life can manifest itself in US
[1:46:11] God everything that's happened to us is
[1:46:14] by your grace
[1:46:16] every transition every move
[1:46:18] whether hurtful or not
[1:46:21] you meant it for good
[1:46:24] God if there's those that are here that
[1:46:26] are struggling with bitterness
[1:46:27] [Music]
[1:46:29] over afflictions over hurts from the
[1:46:31] past
[1:46:32] bitter at a Ministry bitter at a parent
[1:46:36] bitter at a loved one bitter at a spouse
[1:46:39] God I pray that you take him to a higher
[1:46:42] level of revelation
[1:46:44] that you would lift them above the
[1:46:45] carnal and above all the pain and all
[1:46:47] the hurt
[1:46:48] and bring him to a realm with Eagle
[1:46:50] Vision where they could look down and
[1:46:52] see that everything that was intended
[1:46:55] for evil
[1:46:56] you're intending it for good
[1:46:59] that nothing can happen in a child of a
[1:47:02] Believer unless you first allowed it
[1:47:05] and let it be according to your will for
[1:47:08] your purpose
[1:47:10] God I pray that if there's any amongst
[1:47:12] us
[1:47:13] that are even re resentful at ourselves
[1:47:17] hating ourselves for our actions
[1:47:21] God may we just lay it all away forget
[1:47:23] about it
[1:47:25] let all the bitterness just be sucked
[1:47:27] out by the knowledge that you're in
[1:47:29] control
[1:47:30] and you're going to wind us up you're
[1:47:32] going to finish this race and you're
[1:47:33] going to bring us to the place you want
[1:47:35] us to be
[1:47:36] in every evil thing you'll work for good
[1:47:39] in every mistake has done us a world of
[1:47:43] good
[1:47:44] you're bringing us to humility you're
[1:47:46] bringing us to a greater reverence and a
[1:47:48] greater surrender
[1:47:50] God there's many things I'm ashamed of
[1:47:53] Lord but I commit them to you and I ask
[1:47:55] you forgive me Lord
[1:47:57] many regrets that I have in life but I
[1:48:00] know that all things work together for
[1:48:02] good
[1:48:03] God would you take my failures would you
[1:48:05] take my mistakes
[1:48:07] check the things I'm ashamed of Lord and
[1:48:09] would you work it together for good Lord
[1:48:11] and bring me to your expected end
[1:48:15] now there's anybody that's still hurting
[1:48:17] from the past
[1:48:18] I pray you would pour the bomb of Gilead
[1:48:21] into their heart
[1:48:23] by Revelation Lord may they find
[1:48:26] that you do all things well and you know
[1:48:28] every hurt and you know every transition
[1:48:30] in life
[1:48:32] and you know the why behind it all when
[1:48:34] we can't possibly fathom why
[1:48:37] when no human being can answer why why
[1:48:39] would this happen why would it be
[1:48:41] permitted why would it be allowed we
[1:48:43] don't know why
[1:48:44] the good I trust that you do
[1:48:47] help me to trust you more

[1:48:52] children

[1:49:03] virtue and more Temperance and more
[1:49:05] knowledge

[1:49:14] name to this dark world and living your
[1:49:17] life in human flesh through us

[1:49:22] one of us Lord
[1:49:23] we surrender to you and we say that
[1:49:25] you're good in all things
[1:49:27] that you do all things well and my life

[1:49:38] all well Lord
[1:49:40] and I want from my heart to forgive
[1:49:42] everybody that's done wrong to me Lord
[1:49:44] because you do all things well and

[1:50:00] wicked and all the evil
[1:50:02] may we be able to stand in a higher
[1:50:04] plane than we've ever stood before
[1:50:06] that by going down

[1:50:13] you Lord

[1:52:20] for it's Jesus
[1:52:29] to see
[1:52:32] I just remembered a story brother man
[1:52:34] tells
[1:52:36] he's in Shreveport Louisiana and he's
[1:52:38] talking about a woman that's Bound in a
[1:52:41] wheelchair brother member says we see
[1:52:43] the sister in a wheelchair and we've
[1:52:44] prayed for her I don't know why she's
[1:52:47] not here we've seen God do much heal
[1:52:49] much worse than that
[1:52:51] even the prophet of God doesn't know why
[1:52:53] she's not healed he he's prayed for the
[1:52:55] dead and they've been raised blind no
[1:52:58] eyeballs and sockets and God has made
[1:52:59] iron balls he doesn't understand why God
[1:53:01] doesn't heal This Woman's wheelchairs we
[1:53:03] prayed for her many times he says but
[1:53:06] every time I come and see her and see
[1:53:08] her light up and smile amen she's so
[1:53:11] she's so pleasant and so happy
[1:53:14] found in a wheelchair
[1:53:15] and brother barely makes this statement
[1:53:17] he says maybe God lets her stay that way
[1:53:19] because she encourages me
[1:53:24] we don't know why
[1:53:26] things happen in our lives we don't know
[1:53:28] why we go through circumstances we don't
[1:53:30] know why some things remain and some
[1:53:32] things are removed we don't know why but
[1:53:35] oh God help me to have joy and love you
[1:53:38] in it all help me to be pleasant and
[1:53:40] smile in it all help me to do something
[1:53:43] if you're allowing this to encourage
[1:53:44] somebody else if you're allowing this to
[1:53:46] build character in me if you're allowing
[1:53:47] this to defeat the Devil whatever it is
[1:53:49] let me have joy in the midst and let me
[1:53:51] praise you no matter what happens
[1:53:53] I don't understand it all but I know
[1:53:56] you're good and I know your word is true
[1:53:58] and I know that everything you promised
[1:54:00] will take place in my life
[1:54:03] we don't have to have it all figured out
[1:54:05] but oh my we can trust him in it all
[1:54:08] we can thank him in the midst of every
[1:54:10] trial and every storm we can thank him
[1:54:12] because he does all things well
[1:54:15] and he's creating an opportunity an
[1:54:18] opportunity to display himself whether
[1:54:21] it be a little girl with joy Bound in a
[1:54:23] wheelchair he's displaying he could
[1:54:25] display himself by raising her up but he
[1:54:27] could display himself by having joy in
[1:54:28] the midst of a trial
[1:54:31] say God display yourself in me and every
[1:54:33] child let your virtue come let your life
[1:54:36] come let me bear your name in every
[1:54:38] circumstance and every situation
