[7:52] 40.
[7:54] i would just like to say
[7:57] also that uh
[7:59] we appreciate everybody who came out
[8:00] yesterday for the celebration of life

[8:05] for all those who helped who worked in
[8:06] the kitchen who helped with the service

[8:19] to the assembly for all the all that
[8:21] helped and all that were involved so
[8:22] thank you very much for that

[8:28] sister dinah cason's mother passed away
[8:31] thursday morning which is kyle weikert's
[8:33] grandmother and so we've posted the
[8:35] information on the bulletin board
[8:36] there'll be a funeral this week and
[8:37] there's some information there if you'd
[8:39] like to send cards so just keep them in
[8:41] prayer brother kyle was asked to
[8:44] take the funeral service for her
[8:45] grandmother so i'm sure he would
[8:46] appreciate your prayers that wouldn't be
[8:49] an easy thing to do but but may god
[8:51] grant him grace
[8:53] to take his place amen so keep the
[8:55] family in prayer
[8:56] if you don't mind
[8:58] and also i'd like to greet the yoder
[9:00] family god bless you it's good to have
[9:01] you in service again i know they were
[9:03] here a couple weeks ago but i wasn't
[9:05] here to greet them so i'm going to greet
[9:06] them anyways so god bless you we're very
[9:09] glad to have you here and also brother
[9:11] glenn and sister satan from florida it's
[9:13] good to have you back visiting with us
[9:15] again and god bless you very much
[9:17] it was a busy weekend and we mean we
[9:19] know we had the youth camp out and the
[9:20] meetings that were there and a lot of
[9:22] you were involved helping with that so
[9:24] we've had a busy time but we've had a
[9:25] good time amen
[9:27] and god has been good to us and we come
[9:29] here this morning to hear his word and
[9:31] to rejoice
[9:32] in what he's doing in our lives and what
[9:34] he's doing in this day we come with
[9:36] anticipation and if you come with
[9:38] anticipation and expectation you always
[9:40] find what you're looking for
[9:42] amen so let's come with a
[9:44] heart desiring to know him better
[9:47] in isaiah chapter
[9:49] 40.
[9:51] i'd like to just read a portion of
[9:52] scripture before we're seated let's
[9:54] begin in verse 3
[9:56] the voice of him that crieth in the
[9:58] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[10:00] lord make straight in the desert a
[10:02] highway for our god every valley shall
[10:04] be exalted and every mountain and hill
[10:06] shall be made low and the crooked shall
[10:09] be made straight and the rough place is
[10:10] plain
[10:11] and the glory of the lord shall be
[10:13] revealed and all flesh shall see it
[10:15] together for the mouth of the lord hath
[10:18] spoken it
[10:19] amen you can have your seats may the
[10:21] lord add his blessing
[10:22] to the reading
[10:24] of the word
[10:27] god is
[10:28] so wonderful to us to open our eyes to
[10:32] give us eyes to see
[10:34] you know no matter how hard you look at
[10:36] the scripture it'll never open unless
[10:37] god opens it amen
[10:39] no matter how hard for thousands of
[10:42] years that they've looked at the seals
[10:43] trying to find the interpretation of the
[10:45] seals nobody could understand what the
[10:48] seals were until the lamb took the book
[10:50] and opened the seals
[10:51] so no matter how much we look at
[10:53] something study it read it want to know
[10:56] it amen unless god opens it we'll never
[10:59] see it
[11:00] that's what the fallacy of
[11:02] intellectualism in our day is we're
[11:04] trying by education in schooling and by
[11:06] the ability to read to know god but
[11:09] you'll never by the ability of
[11:11] by the ability to read to know god
[11:13] because when jesus christ came in flesh
[11:16] they proved that just the ability to
[11:18] study and read was not enough to know
[11:20] god because they read the psalms they
[11:23] read
[11:24] the prophets they read moses and the law
[11:26] and they knew all the pro they knew all
[11:28] the prophecies about the coming the
[11:30] messiah but when the word was made flesh
[11:33] and stood among them amen they had the
[11:35] intellectual reading of the word but
[11:37] they didn't have the divine revelation
[11:39] from god to recognize that this is that
[11:44] this that's standing in front of me is
[11:46] the revelation of what i've been reading
[11:48] in the book all they had was the
[11:50] intellectual part they did not have the
[11:52] revealed party man
[11:54] and god to prove that it wasn't
[11:56] intellectualism he would take illiterate
[11:58] fishermen
[12:02] because it was said of the disciples
[12:03] they were ignorant and unlearned amen so
[12:06] god would take the ones who didn't know
[12:08] the intellectual side of the scriptures
[12:11] amen and he would reveal it to them so
[12:13] that they would be able to declare to
[12:15] understand to see the coming of the lord
[12:18] the coming of the son of god the messiah
[12:21] upon the earth they could see what the
[12:23] learned could not see
[12:27] they they were ignorant and unlearned so
[12:29] they could not even read but they didn't
[12:32] need to be able to read they needed
[12:33] revelation from god
[12:37] so that's where the christian church has
[12:39] failed
[12:40] failed by education and school systems
[12:42] and one man pro
[12:44] proclamating his interpretation by
[12:46] intellectualism to another and to
[12:48] another and to another until they just
[12:50] keep repeating it until it becomes the
[12:52] facts
[12:54] till it becomes the only interpretation
[12:55] of this scripture amen but then god will
[12:58] come and do it in a way according to his
[13:00] word but not according to their
[13:02] expectation
[13:04] and when it comes according to the word
[13:06] it's a perfect fulfillment of the word
[13:08] but it's not a perfect fulfillment of
[13:10] their expectation of the word so they
[13:12] reject the fulfillment of the word
[13:13] because it wasn't the way they expected
[13:15] it
[13:18] lord help us not to fall into that same
[13:20] trap
[13:23] we're continuing on with the same
[13:25] thought we've been on with the
[13:26] unexpected fulfillment part three i'm
[13:28] sure you've guessed that by now
[13:30] but i want to look at this prophecy
[13:32] laying in isaiah and this prophecy is a
[13:35] prophecy of john the baptist coming the
[13:37] forerunner that's coming there's several
[13:39] prophecies that point to his coming
[13:42] to forerun the coming of christ
[13:45] but i want to look at verse five
[13:47] and the glory of the lord shall be
[13:49] revealed and all flesh shall see it
[13:51] together for the mouth of the lord has
[13:53] spoken it so part of this prophecy of
[13:55] this one coming we've already looked
[13:57] last sunday at the first part the voice
[13:59] of one crying in the wilderness prepare
[14:01] ye away of the lord and make straight in
[14:04] the desert a highway for our god so we
[14:06] we talked about that there is a there
[14:09] when you read this description
[14:12] every valley shall be exalted every
[14:14] mountain and shale shall be made low and
[14:15] the crooked shall be made straight in
[14:17] the rough
[14:18] places made plain when you look at this
[14:20] with an intellectual understanding
[14:22] there's no way you can make that equal
[14:24] that man wrapped in a cloak of camel's
[14:28] hair amen eating locust and wild honey
[14:30] screaming on the banks of the muddy
[14:31] jordan you could not make this equal
[14:33] that amen the intellectual mind is
[14:36] looking for a road
[14:39] where physical hills are torn down and
[14:41] valleys are filled in and crooked places
[14:43] straighten out and rough places made
[14:45] smooth making a highway in the desert
[14:47] for the lord and then the intellectual
[14:49] mind will read that and have an
[14:51] understanding by reading that and
[14:53] they'll be looking for something to come
[14:56] based off their understanding of reading
[14:58] those words
[15:00] but when john the baptist came he didn't
[15:02] have a pick or a shovel or a working
[15:04] crew he didn't move stones and he didn't
[15:07] do anything that you would think he
[15:08] would do what he did is he knocked the
[15:10] pharisees off their high horse amen and
[15:12] he brought everybody to a level plane of
[15:15] repentance
[15:17] he brought the prostitutes and and he
[15:19] brought the drunkards up in repentance
[15:21] he brought the pharisees and the
[15:22] sadducees down in repentance what was he
[15:24] doing he was making the way straight
[15:27] amen away in the wilderness through
[15:28] repentance amen so that people the way
[15:30] of christ was made
[15:33] so the fulfillment was a spiritual
[15:36] fulfillment amen and it wasn't physical
[15:39] according to intellectualism amen
[15:42] i hope that makes sense praise be to god
[15:45] and so now i want to look at verse 5
[15:47] because verse 5 is part of the same
[15:49] prophecy and the glory of the lord shall
[15:51] be revealed and the flesh shall and and
[15:53] all flesh shall see it together from the
[15:56] mouth of the lord has spoken it
[15:58] now if you could go with me to to luke
[16:02] chapter 3
[16:03] luke in the gospel he repeats this
[16:17] luke chapter 3
[16:20] and i'm going to begin at verse 3.
[16:26] and he came into all the country about
[16:28] jordan preaching the baptism of
[16:30] repentance for the remission of sins as
[16:32] it is written in the book of the words
[16:33] of isaias the prophet we just read those
[16:36] the saying the voice of the one crying
[16:38] in the wilderness prepare ye the way of
[16:39] the lord make his path straight every
[16:41] valley shall be filled and every
[16:43] mountain and hill shall be made low and
[16:45] the crooked shall be made straight and
[16:46] the rough way shall be made smooth and
[16:49] all flesh shall see the salvation of god
[16:56] if you're looking at this intellectually
[16:58] the question is
[17:00] when did all flesh
[17:05] how many people on the earth knew or
[17:07] seen jesus or witnessed jesus ministry
[17:12] when did all flesh
[17:15] see when you take an intellectual
[17:16] approach and you look at this and you
[17:18] try to make it fit intellectually
[17:21] you know only a portion of the
[17:23] population of the world in that day
[17:25] heard john the baptist preach
[17:28] only a small number repented under his
[17:30] ministry
[17:31] only a few people of the millions that
[17:33] were on earth at that time ever even
[17:35] knew jesus christ not even all israel
[17:38] would have seen jesus and heard him
[17:39] preach
[17:42] but the prophecy says all flesh shall
[17:45] see the salvation of the lord all and
[17:48] and it says all flesh shall see it
[17:50] together and so you realize that the
[17:53] fulfillment of prophecy does not match
[17:55] our intellectual idea
[17:58] because we're thinking of well you've
[18:00] got to you've got to gather every
[18:02] everybody all flesh and i'm not here to
[18:04] interpret this i'm just here to show it
[18:06] amen
[18:07] because i don't know what the
[18:09] interpretation is but we know at some
[18:11] point all flesh shall see the salvation
[18:13] of the lord amen if it may not be to the
[18:15] white throne judgment but at the white
[18:17] throne judgment all flesh shall see him
[18:20] i don't know i don't i don't i'm not
[18:21] going to try to explain this it's not
[18:23] for me to explain was it fulfilled in
[18:25] john the baptist ministry absolutely was
[18:27] he the fulfillment of the forerunner
[18:29] ministry absolutely amen how do you
[18:31] equate all flesh with his ministry i
[18:33] don't know but it's fulfilled
[18:36] if that prophecy is still going on and
[18:38] still rolling all the way down to a
[18:40] final fulfillment at the white throne
[18:42] judgment that's fine with me i'm fine
[18:44] with that but the prophecy has been
[18:46] fulfilled
[18:49] somebody asked me what what what was all
[18:52] flesh then i said
[18:54] all the flesh that he meant by all flesh
[19:02] see why do we why do we intellectualize
[19:04] it
[19:06] and we try to make the fulfillment of
[19:07] prophecy fit into
[19:10] our understanding by reading amen it's
[19:13] not understanding by reading it's
[19:14] understanding by revelation he
[19:16] interprets his word by bringing it to
[19:17] past then when he brings it to pass
[19:19] there's an elect people on the earth
[19:21] that will catch the revelation that this
[19:22] is the fulfillment of that
[19:24] he hides it in simplicity and reveals it
[19:27] in the same amen it's not for the
[19:29] intellectual it's not for the learned
[19:31] it's for those that can receive
[19:32] revelation from the father
[19:35] he's hid it from the eyes of the wise
[19:37] and prudent
[19:38] and revealed it to the babes
[19:41] god
[19:42] he didn't make it to where the
[19:44] intellectual could catch it he made it
[19:46] where the babes could catch it
[19:50] i don't know about you but a baby can't
[19:52] read yet
[19:57] praise god god's good
[19:59] so i just want to retouch this
[20:01] foundation and just keep moving from
[20:03] there because we want we never want to
[20:05] get ourselves hemmed in by
[20:07] intellectualism we never want to corner
[20:10] ourselves in the bible amen by saying
[20:13] well you know this this and this has to
[20:15] happen amen because that's where they
[20:17] were in the days that jesus was pulling
[20:19] the earth even his disciples they were
[20:21] in that mentality they were looking at
[20:23] jesus and they knew there was something
[20:25] special about this ministry and they
[20:27] were believing that it was the messiah
[20:28] the christ that would come but they had
[20:30] a problem in their understanding and
[20:32] they asked him one day they say doesn't
[20:34] the scripture say or why does the
[20:35] scripture say elias must first come
[20:38] because see they're recognizing that
[20:40] this is the messiah they're recognizing
[20:42] this is the christ so there must be a
[20:43] forerunner but they haven't seen a
[20:45] forerunner yet
[20:48] so they asked the question why does the
[20:50] scripture say elias must come first and
[20:53] jesus says elias has truly come already
[20:59] you missed it
[21:01] they're his disciples amen they're
[21:03] looking at him and believing him but
[21:05] they're missing the fulfillment of the
[21:07] scriptures that they were looking for to
[21:09] fulfill to confirm that this was messiah
[21:11] it was already done they're standing
[21:13] here believing this messiah with a
[21:14] question in their heart what about this
[21:16] scripture and he says it's already been
[21:18] done it's already been fulfilled and
[21:19] they did to him whatever they wished
[21:23] so we have to be careful
[21:26] that we don't
[21:27] miss
[21:28] what god has done
[21:31] brother branham made this statement many
[21:32] times
[21:34] he says it's later than you think
[21:38] how many times did he say that friends
[21:41] it's later than you think
[21:44] i'm wondering if it's not still later
[21:46] than i think
[21:49] it could be
[21:51] it could still be later than what i'm
[21:52] thinking
[21:54] we have to realize that the possibility
[21:57] to the disciples it was later than they
[21:58] were thinking
[22:01] they thought well elias must come first
[22:03] and jesus says it's later than you think
[22:08] eliza's already come
[22:11] so brother emily says this later than
[22:13] you think amen what's he saying he's
[22:15] saying it's later than you think
[22:18] whatever you're thinking it's later than
[22:20] you think
[22:22] you know and some people think too far
[22:24] so it might be earlier than you're
[22:25] thinking and later than i'm thinking
[22:29] i don't know
[22:30] but he said over and over and over again
[22:32] it's later than you think
[22:34] let's be aware of that friends
[22:37] it's later than we think amen
[22:40] and second corinthians chapter 4 if we
[22:42] could turn there together and read this
[22:44] scripture
[23:02] you know
[23:04] i'll just say this comment because it's
[23:06] on my mind and on my heart
[23:09] i do not want to be a bible scholar
[23:13] i want to be a bible believer
[23:17] because all the bible scholars missed
[23:18] him
[23:21] but the bible believer saw him
[23:24] so i do not want to be a bible scholar i
[23:26] want to be a bible believer
[23:29] i want to believe
[23:31] what's written of him
[23:33] i want to believe the manifestation in
[23:35] our day of what was written i want to be
[23:37] a believer
[23:39] being a bible scholar won't get you to
[23:41] heaven
[23:43] won't fulfill the promise in your life
[23:45] but being a bible believer will
[23:47] because all these things are apprehended
[23:48] by faith
[23:51] some people take great pride in being a
[23:52] bible scholar
[23:54] i say go back and look at the bible
[23:56] scholars in the bible
[23:58] that's nothing to be proud of
[24:01] second corinthians chapter four verse 6
[24:09] for god who commanded the light to shine
[24:11] out of darkness has shined in our hearts
[24:12] to give the light of the knowledge of
[24:15] the glory of god in the face of jesus
[24:17] christ
[24:19] but we have this treasure in earthen
[24:20] vessels that the excellency of the power
[24:23] may be of god and not of us
[24:26] so there's a
[24:28] there's an excellency
[24:30] there's a treasure i'm sorry there's a
[24:32] treasure
[24:33] that's in our earthen vessels
[24:36] and that's the that's the
[24:39] that is i'm sorry let me read that again
[24:42] that god who commanded the light to
[24:43] shine out of darkness has shined in our
[24:45] hearts to give the light of the
[24:47] knowledge of the glory of god and the
[24:49] face of jesus christ so the glory of god
[24:52] is revealed in the revelation of jesus
[24:54] christ and we have this treasure in
[24:56] earthen vessels
[24:58] amen by what by revelation by the
[25:00] revelation of jesus christ amen the
[25:03] glory of god is revealed and we have
[25:05] this treasure in earth and vessels that
[25:08] should mean more to us than anything
[25:10] friends
[25:11] amen that should be the thing that we
[25:13] value the most amen is the revelation
[25:15] that god has given us and amen in this
[25:18] hour eyes to see and ears to hear amen
[25:20] we had brother john matthew's funeral
[25:22] yesterday and our celebration of life
[25:24] and and several of you were here but we
[25:26] were beginning to talk about that pearl
[25:28] of great price and that treasure hidden
[25:30] the field and and jesus is now giving
[25:33] the parables of the kingdom of heaven he
[25:35] said the kingdom of heaven is like a
[25:36] treasure hit in the field then when a
[25:38] man finds it he hideth and he sells all
[25:40] that he has and he buys the field
[25:42] then he says the the kingdom of heaven
[25:45] is like a pearl a man of great price and
[25:48] a a merchant he finds it he sells all
[25:50] that he has that he might have that
[25:51] pearl amen when you realize uh what's
[25:54] going on what this is is this is the
[25:56] treasure that they've wanted all of
[25:58] their lives this wasn't something to
[26:00] make more money this wasn't that
[26:02] merchant wasn't looking to get this
[26:03] pearl to sell it he wanted the pearl to
[26:05] keep it
[26:07] and he was willing to part with all of
[26:09] his other merchandise to have this pearl
[26:14] and then the one who's found the
[26:15] treasure hidden in the field he was
[26:17] willing to part with everything else to
[26:19] have the treasure to buy the field to
[26:21] have the treasure that was in the field
[26:23] and we realized this is this is this is
[26:25] our lives if we just recognize what god
[26:28] has given us amen we found amen a
[26:30] treasure hidden in the field we found
[26:32] the pearl of great price amen in this
[26:35] day we found the revelation of the word
[26:37] for our day amen and it should be worth
[26:40] everything to us it should be greater
[26:42] than anything else in our lives this
[26:44] should be the primary thing in our lives
[26:48] and what we noticed in brother john
[26:49] matthew's life is it was the primary
[26:51] thing in his life because when you come
[26:53] to his funeral and we talked about his
[26:55] life amen there was there was not a lot
[26:57] of other things awards and accolades and
[27:00] accomplishments to talk about the very
[27:02] thing that stood out the most in brother
[27:03] john matthew's life is that he loved
[27:05] this word
[27:07] you all who knew him you knew i mean
[27:09] tell me what his hobbies were
[27:13] you know tell me tell me what what what
[27:16] what was his greatest accomplishment at
[27:18] work what's the most hours he ever
[27:20] worked in a in a week what's the great
[27:22] what's the biggest paycheck he ever
[27:23] brought home what's the most money he
[27:24] ever made in a year
[27:28] what's the thing we remember most about
[27:29] our brother
[27:30] is that he loved this word above
[27:32] everything else
[27:35] this word was not as something he does
[27:39] in did on the side
[27:42] he didn't have a job and he'd have a
[27:43] career and he didn't have
[27:44] responsibilities and he went to church
[27:47] that's how most of the world does it
[27:48] amen their religion is just a part of
[27:51] the caveat of their life amen it's part
[27:53] of the package i i do this for so many
[27:55] hours and i have this family and we have
[27:57] these activities and i have these
[27:58] hobbies these are my accomplishments and
[28:00] i go to church such and such a place
[28:03] that's modern christianity but that is
[28:05] not biblical christianity that was not
[28:08] the first century christians
[28:11] when they got a hold of this pearl of
[28:12] great price it was everything to them
[28:14] everything else was secondary
[28:17] including their relationships and their
[28:19] families
[28:22] that's the bible
[28:26] and so the primary thing in our lives
[28:28] amen is this revealed word amen is this
[28:31] revelation of this day christ amen as
[28:34] he's revealed to us it's the treasure we
[28:36] have in earthen vessels
[28:39] we found that the treasure is in us
[28:43] we have this treasure in earth and
[28:44] vessels that the excellency might be of
[28:46] god and not of us because we didn't have
[28:48] anything to do with it god put that
[28:50] treasure there and god revealed to us
[28:51] what was down on the inside
[28:56] so our lives should reflect the you know
[28:59] if there's been a prophet in this day to
[29:01] turn the children back to the faith of
[29:03] the pentecostal fathers amen then we
[29:05] should have a faith like the original
[29:07] faith of the pentecostal fathers
[29:09] and the pentecostal fathers amen their
[29:12] whole life was the word amen was the
[29:14] word that they received the revelation
[29:16] of the hour amen they had caught that
[29:18] revelation and it was their whole life
[29:22] they were persecuted for it they were
[29:23] chased away from their homes for it they
[29:25] lost jobs and lost relationships amen
[29:28] everything else had to become secondary
[29:30] for this word amen
[29:34] so we realize that it means more to us
[29:38] than life
[29:39] it's the treasure hidden in earthen
[29:41] vessels
[29:44] the prophet of god says in the message
[29:46] god hiding himself in simplicity then
[29:48] revealing himself in the same
[29:51] i used to just read the first half of
[29:53] that because it takes a long time to
[29:54] read that title
[29:55] but i think one of the most amazing
[29:57] parts of that is the second half
[30:00] of how god reveals himself
[30:03] we know how he hides himself but we have
[30:05] to be aware of how he reveals himself
[30:09] we can see him in the hiding and miss
[30:11] him in the revealing
[30:15] he was hidden in those disciples as they
[30:17] bust out of the upper room
[30:20] fishermen tax collectors men and women
[30:24] common people maybe some levels of
[30:26] education some no education common garb
[30:29] maybe some were a little better some
[30:30] were a little worse off it was just
[30:32] common people 120 common people amen but
[30:36] what was inside of them was the promise
[30:38] for that day
[30:41] the fulfillment of the word for that day
[30:42] was inside of them they had just
[30:44] experienced it when jesus says i will
[30:46] come to you amen i will come to you
[30:49] don't worry i will come to you and i
[30:51] will manifest myself to you and they
[30:52] said how will you manifest yourself to
[30:54] us and not to the world he says my
[30:56] father and i will come to you make her
[30:58] abode with you
[31:00] okay
[31:02] how will that work
[31:03] just wait and see
[31:05] here they come on the day of pentecost
[31:07] and christ comes in the fulfillment of
[31:09] his promise to them that he will return
[31:10] to them that he will come to them amen
[31:12] as the comforter as the holy ghost and
[31:14] he comes according to his word and now
[31:17] the fulfillment of the word for that day
[31:19] is inside of them and they come busting
[31:21] out they have a treasure hidden in earth
[31:23] and vessels amen it was hidden in the
[31:26] simplicity of a fisherman and a tax
[31:28] collector and a farmer and a whatever
[31:31] else
[31:33] but it was revealed in the same because
[31:35] that same ignorant fisherman is the one
[31:37] who stood up on the day of pentecost
[31:39] amen who the the the scribes testified
[31:42] that he was ignorant and unlearned
[31:46] he stood up before them and said this is
[31:48] the prophecy that was given to joel this
[31:50] is what was said this is the fulfillment
[31:53] of that
[31:57] and there must have been some other
[31:59] believers in the area because there was
[32:02] about three thousand or five thousand
[32:04] added to the church at the preaching of
[32:05] that simple vessel
[32:08] amen they could catch the revelation for
[32:11] their day
[32:13] and in this message he says god hides
[32:15] himself in a simple little wash woman
[32:17] or an ordinary man with his dinner under
[32:19] his arm
[32:21] kiss his wife and children goodbye and
[32:22] go out there and maybe hide himself in
[32:24] that man to do something that an
[32:26] archbishop would know nothing about
[32:33] he was doing something in peter john
[32:34] that caiaphas knew nothing about
[32:37] when he goes to question him all they're
[32:38] trying to do is to get him to stop
[32:40] preaching
[32:41] but they were doing something that
[32:43] campuses knew nothing about
[32:46] they were simple they were humble
[32:48] they didn't know how this was possible
[32:50] they tried to bring them amen before the
[32:52] sanhedrin so that they can threaten them
[32:54] they were trying to scare them they were
[32:56] trying to use you know their bully
[32:58] pulpit to threaten these ignorant and
[32:59] unlearned individuals amen and when
[33:02] peter come before them he was so
[33:04] convinced of the word for his day that
[33:06] he was not going to be intimidated by a
[33:08] high priest amen he knew who the real
[33:11] high priest was
[33:12] [Music]
[33:14] the high priest was living inside of him
[33:18] so he stood there and they said you know
[33:21] don't preach or teach any more in jesus
[33:23] name and he says you answer me
[33:26] is it better that we obey god or obey
[33:28] man
[33:30] well how caiaphas is going to answer
[33:31] that he's not going to say well you
[33:33] ignore god and obey man
[33:35] but peter was not going to be
[33:36] intimidated because there was something
[33:38] that became real to him
[33:40] there was a reality of the word the word
[33:42] it became real and now it was hidden in
[33:45] the simplicity of peter
[33:47] but it was revealed through the
[33:49] simplicity of peter
[33:50] because god doesn't need something great
[33:53] to reveal himself god chooses the nobody
[33:56] to do something great god chooses
[33:58] nothing to do something wonderful with
[34:00] because he always does it opposite to
[34:02] the thinking of man
[34:06] so he hides himself and that little man
[34:08] with his dinner under his arm
[34:11] kiss his wife and his children goodbye
[34:14] god can do more with through that man
[34:18] than the archbishop would know anything
[34:20] about
[34:21] you don't hear him blow no horns and
[34:23] send it out god just gets glory that's
[34:25] all the simple hear it and are glad
[34:29] how god was god was hiding himself in
[34:31] the simplicity of a baby hiding himself
[34:33] in the simplicity of a common family god
[34:37] and the ecclesiastics and the great men
[34:39] the mind the genius and all of them the
[34:42] herods and so forth of that day and the
[34:44] neros and they all overlooked it god
[34:46] hiding in simplicity
[34:49] amen they thought they could control it
[34:51] but they didn't realize what it was they
[34:53] thought it was a fisherman
[34:55] a couple of them
[34:56] they didn't realize it was god
[34:58] they thought they could control it but
[35:00] you can't control god because god's
[35:02] hidden and revealed in simplicity
[35:05] let's go back to isaiah
[35:08] chapter 7.
[35:28] isaiah chapter 7
[35:33] verse 14
[35:35] therefore the lord himself shall give
[35:37] you a sign
[35:38] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[35:40] a son and shall call his name
[35:43] emmanuel
[35:45] so here goes forth a prophecy from
[35:48] isaiah
[35:49] and that prophecy is the prophecy of
[35:52] emmanuel coming
[35:54] a virgin conceiving and bearing a son
[35:57] and his name will be called
[35:58] emmanuel
[36:00] let's turn over to verse 9
[36:02] or chapter 9 i'm sorry chapter 9 and
[36:04] verse 6.
[36:12] and unto us a child is born unto us the
[36:14] son is given
[36:16] and the government shall be upon his
[36:17] shoulder and his name shall be called
[36:19] wonderful counselor the mighty god the
[36:21] everlasting father the prince of peace
[36:24] of the increase of his government and
[36:26] peace there shall be no end upon the
[36:28] throne of david and upon his kingdom to
[36:30] order it and to establish it with
[36:32] judgment and with justice from
[36:33] henceforth even forever the zeal of the
[36:36] lord of hosts will perform
[36:38] this
[36:40] this is a prophecy that they were
[36:41] looking for
[36:43] for many many
[36:44] many years for 700 and some years they
[36:48] were looking for this prophecy to be
[36:49] fulfilled and god when it come time to
[36:52] fulfill the prophecy amen because he's
[36:55] hidden and revealed in simplicity he's
[36:57] got to find a simple vessel to hide this
[37:00] prophecy in and a simple vessel to
[37:02] reveal this prophecy through
[37:06] because a virgin has to conceive so if
[37:08] he's going to pick a virgin now if you
[37:10] and i in ecclesiasticals of the day
[37:13] we're going to pick the virgin we would
[37:15] pick you know the number one virgin in
[37:17] all of israel
[37:19] somebody with royal blood somebody uh
[37:23] a dissent from judah or from the high
[37:26] priest or something you know something
[37:28] where somebody from the high priest
[37:30] family had married one of the king's
[37:32] family and they had the best of both
[37:33] worlds
[37:35] this is how the human mind wants to do
[37:37] things
[37:38] but god doesn't do that he goes and
[37:40] finds a nobody in no place
[37:43] in nazareth amen even when nathanael
[37:45] goes amen to speak to philip about jesus
[37:48] of nazareth philip even says can
[37:50] anything good come from nazareth so you
[37:52] realize the reputation of nazareth that
[37:54] day was not a good reputation nazareth
[37:56] there was nothing good that could be
[37:58] said or nothing good thought to come
[37:59] from nazareth
[38:01] but that so if that's the reputation of
[38:03] that place then that's exactly where god
[38:06] is going to go because he's hidden and
[38:07] revealed in simplicity
[38:10] he's going to bring this prophecy amen
[38:12] right through a virgin in an out of the
[38:14] way place amen through somebody who is
[38:17] nobody really in the ranks of the of the
[38:20] class of that day she is nobody from
[38:23] nowhere
[38:25] and nobody from nowhere amen it's the
[38:28] same thing he did in our day when he
[38:29] chose a prophet amen born in the hills
[38:32] in kentucky brought up in southern
[38:34] indiana a nobody from nowhere with a
[38:37] seventh grade education and he's not
[38:38] even got a denomination to support him
[38:41] what did he do he took nobody from
[38:42] nowhere
[38:44] because he's going to be hidden in that
[38:46] man but he's going to be revealed
[38:47] through that man
[38:50] so we see that there's a prophecy of a
[38:51] virgin but but then the prophecy of the
[38:54] child is coming from the virgin
[38:56] for unto us a child is born a son is
[38:58] given and the government shall be upon
[39:01] his shoulders
[39:02] and his name shall be called wonderful
[39:04] counselor the mighty god the everlasting
[39:08] father the prince of peace
[39:10] of the increase of his government and
[39:12] peace there shall be no end
[39:15] upon the throne of david and upon his
[39:17] kingdom to order and to establish it
[39:19] with what do you think they're looking
[39:21] for
[39:23] when they read this scripture what were
[39:25] they looking for friends that's why the
[39:28] disciples kept asking him when are you
[39:30] going to set up your kingdom and when
[39:32] will you establish your kingdom and who
[39:33] will sit on your right hand and who will
[39:34] sit on your left hand because they were
[39:36] looking at this with an intellectual
[39:38] mind and they were watching for the one
[39:40] to be born a meant to be wonderful
[39:45] counselor prince of peace the mighty god
[39:48] they were looking for something big
[39:51] and what they got was a man with no
[39:54] comeliness no beauty that we should
[39:56] behold him
[39:58] there was nothing special about the
[40:00] vessel that god would use and he wasn't
[40:02] born in a special place and then he was
[40:04] born in a not so special place amen god
[40:06] was using simplicity again to reveal the
[40:09] prophecy amen and so god was bringing
[40:11] forth the prophetic word exactly the way
[40:14] he said we do it but not anything like
[40:16] they thought he would do it
[40:19] they didn't understand that this
[40:21] prophecy would continue all the way
[40:23] through the millennium
[40:25] and it's the same prophecy jesus came to
[40:28] fulfill the prophecy he's still
[40:30] fulfilling this prophecy
[40:33] but they thought everything that's
[40:35] listed here will be done all at once all
[40:38] right now all when he comes and shows
[40:41] himself to the high priest
[40:44] and they miss that it's all the same
[40:46] prophecy but this prophecy will unfold
[40:49] over thousands of years
[40:53] and he was he came the way he said he
[40:54] would come
[40:56] he is the person that said would come
[40:58] he's exactly the fulfillment of the
[41:00] prophecy nothing's out of cater
[41:02] nothing's wrong it just doesn't match
[41:04] their intellectual understanding
[41:06] they didn't realize friends because they
[41:08] didn't understand the mystery that was
[41:10] laying in the old testament they were
[41:11] reading they had a bible and in that
[41:14] bible they were holding the bible and
[41:16] not even understanding what they were
[41:17] reading they understood the words they
[41:20] didn't understand what was going on in
[41:21] that bible or they would have realized
[41:24] amen that that all these christ types
[41:26] have a gentile bride
[41:30] joseph had a gentile bride i mean all
[41:32] the way down the line a gentile bride
[41:34] all coming all through the line of judah
[41:36] a gentile bride amen rahab was even a
[41:39] gentile amen in the lineage of christ
[41:42] they're missing the gentile woman that's
[41:44] inserted into the old testament and
[41:46] these types of christ when they come on
[41:48] the scene they have gentile wives and
[41:50] they don't realize that he cannot take
[41:52] the throne until he has his wife because
[41:55] they must sit on the throne together
[41:58] [Applause]
[42:00] and so because they're missing the
[42:02] mystery in the bible amen they're
[42:04] looking intellectually at it and they
[42:06] said all this will have to be fulfilled
[42:09] if they would have known the mystery
[42:10] they would have known it couldn't all be
[42:11] fulfilled in that day because he cannot
[42:13] take the place in the kingdom till he
[42:15] redeems his bride he cannot redeem his
[42:17] bride amen until he redeems her through
[42:19] the two thousand years of the gentile
[42:21] dispensation because it won't be a
[42:23] jewish bride it'll be a gentile bride
[42:26] and if you don't understand this mystery
[42:28] you don't understand what was going on
[42:30] in the old testament when they were
[42:31] constantly defying the word of god and
[42:34] taking gentile women and taking harlots
[42:36] and all of these things that they would
[42:38] take unto themselves and you're like why
[42:40] why would a prince and the army of
[42:43] israel take rahab the harlot i mean how
[42:45] is this god
[42:48] in all of his purity and his holiness
[42:50] why would he allow this with judah and
[42:52] tamar to work out why rahab amen why all
[42:56] of these why why why joseph amen will
[42:59] take an egyptian wife what what is going
[43:02] on this is so
[43:04] odd
[43:08] because god he's not making one mistake
[43:11] with one jot or one tittle there's
[43:13] nothing out of cater everything is
[43:15] exactly the way it should be and god is
[43:18] laying it in the scriptures amen it's
[43:20] all there he doesn't have to write a new
[43:22] bible amen it's all right there in the
[43:24] bible for you to see but you can't see
[43:26] it with the intellectual part
[43:30] because there was a mystery laying in
[43:31] there
[43:32] the gentile bride was all the way back
[43:35] through the old testament
[43:38] and so now when he comes amen he is
[43:40] refused by the jews amen that was all
[43:43] through the bible too
[43:46] and so now he gives his life to pay the
[43:48] price of redemption to redeem israel and
[43:51] to redeem his bride will be coming but
[43:54] he must he must have a gentile bride so
[43:57] they miss that he cannot fulfill this
[44:00] prophecy without getting a gentile bride
[44:03] and getting a gentile abide is part of
[44:05] this prophecy
[44:11] it's laying there right in the word so
[44:13] for 2 000 years he's building a bride
[44:16] he's building her up he's redeeming her
[44:18] amen
[44:19] the blood was shed for her amen before
[44:22] she would ever begin calling her and he
[44:24] begins to redeem her and bring her on
[44:26] the scene amen so that he can marry her
[44:28] so he can unite with her because he
[44:30] won't take the throne without his bride
[44:34] because she's predestined to be a joint
[44:36] heir with him
[44:43] you see the intellectual part can't
[44:45] catch it
[44:48] it can't catch it
[44:50] i mean
[44:52] we all want to know our bibles
[44:56] is that right
[44:57] we read and we want to understand and
[44:59] read and want to understand that's a
[45:01] godly desire there's nothing wrong with
[45:03] that
[45:04] but some man came to brother branham and
[45:06] said you just don't know your bible real
[45:08] well
[45:09] you know he didn't even dispute with
[45:11] that like i don't know the jots and the
[45:13] tittles and the punctuations and the
[45:15] greek and the hebrew and the right
[45:16] pronunciation of all those long names
[45:19] i can't pronounce all the cities and i
[45:21] can't always remember the bible stories
[45:23] in order and sometimes i get the wrong
[45:25] number of people killed with the wrong
[45:28] champion who killed them
[45:31] sometimes i've got a sham guard killing
[45:34] a thousand and and sometimes i've got
[45:37] samson killing 600 instead of samson
[45:39] killing a thousand in shamgar killing
[45:41] 600.
[45:47] and the intellectual mind is like
[45:49] it's not a thousand six hundred
[46:00] what
[46:01] the man under the inspiration of the
[46:03] holy ghost took an ox goat and killed
[46:05] him 600 or a thousand what's the
[46:07] difference
[46:10] brother was able to take one scripture
[46:12] amen one verse of scripture and he was
[46:15] able to tell and paint the whole picture
[46:16] of the scene of that day and what that
[46:18] judge sham guard was doing amen and all
[46:20] you can do is look at him and say it was
[46:23] it was not a thousand it was 600.
[46:30] no no he said when the one comes to
[46:33] prepare a highway he's going to make a
[46:35] road
[46:37] in the wilderness
[46:40] and all flesh shall be gathered to see
[46:43] it
[46:47] no no no no
[46:49] that man no no no that man born of that
[46:52] woman which we doubt her story very much
[46:58] that can't be him because he's going to
[47:00] be wonderful
[47:05] there was no beauty that we should
[47:06] behold him
[47:08] he was going to be the prince of peace
[47:10] the mighty counselor the mighty god
[47:15] and he's going to sit on the throne of
[47:17] david he's going to restore the kingdom
[47:20] and the increase of his kingdom will no
[47:22] no end forever
[47:26] do you see him crucified did you see him
[47:28] die
[47:29] do you think that's the fulfillment of
[47:30] the prophecy
[47:33] the disciples were like yep
[47:39] the intellectual mind will tell brother
[47:40] graham you don't know your bible really
[47:42] well but he says yeah but i know the
[47:43] author real well
[47:46] i know the one who wrote it and the one
[47:48] who wrote it is the one who can reveal
[47:50] it amen a priest a man a scholar a
[47:54] one with a pastor's degree or phd they
[47:56] cannot reveal the word to you because
[47:58] they didn't write it it's only the one
[48:00] who wrote it is the only one who can
[48:01] reveal it
[48:04] and so the revelation must come from the
[48:06] author and so we want to know our bibles
[48:09] we should know our bibles we should read
[48:11] and study our bibles but if you don't
[48:13] know the author all you're doing is
[48:15] reading words and getting an
[48:16] intellectual understanding that'll send
[48:18] you down the wrong road
[48:22] because that's what it's always done
[48:27] praise be to god
[48:29] that's nothing but the truth
[48:32] luke chapter one
[48:35] i wonder sometimes that we don't spend
[48:36] so much time
[48:38] dissecting the bible and studying the
[48:40] bible
[48:42] that we don't even see it
[48:44] like the whole story of the bible
[48:47] the whole purpose of redemption
[48:50] a restoration back to what was fallen
[48:53] the whole plan from beginning to end
[48:59] luke chapter 1 verse 26
[49:04] and in the sixth month the angel gabriel
[49:07] was sent to sent from god unto a city of
[49:10] galilee named nazareth to a virgin a
[49:12] spouse to a man whose name was joseph of
[49:14] the house of david and the virgin's name
[49:16] was mary and the angel came in unto her
[49:19] and said hail thou art highly favored
[49:21] the lord is with thee blessed art thou
[49:24] among women
[49:25] listen
[49:26] before this visitation of the angel she
[49:29] did not know she was highly favored and
[49:31] she didn't know she was blessed among
[49:32] women
[49:35] she didn't know who she was
[49:37] i mean like she knew who she was but she
[49:38] didn't know who she was
[49:41] like she knew her birth record and she
[49:42] probably could go back a few generations
[49:44] and she knew the city she lived in and
[49:46] the name they called her and you know
[49:47] the house that she dwelt in she knew who
[49:49] she was but she didn't know who she was
[49:53] it took the visitation of an angel with
[49:55] a message from god to awaken her to who
[49:58] she really was by calling her hey hey
[50:01] you know you're highly favored
[50:04] and you're blessed arthel among women
[50:08] you know
[50:09] the first time she heard that i'm sure
[50:10] she was a little startled and she might
[50:12] have been like
[50:18] you're talking to me
[50:22] brother venom in the first seal he looks
[50:24] at a group of people and he says i'm
[50:26] going to i'm no longer going to call you
[50:28] church but i'm going to call you bride
[50:30] so that you'll understand
[50:33] there was a group of people there and
[50:34] some may have been they'd all rejoice
[50:36] some may have understood some didn't but
[50:38] when i heard the tape something called
[50:40] me bride amen
[50:43] amen and it wasn't the man from kentucky
[50:45] amen it was the voice behind that man
[50:47] that was saying i'm going to call you
[50:49] bride so that you'll understand that
[50:51] this prophecy is for you amen
[50:54] he had to come to mary so she would know
[50:56] this prophecy is for you and you have to
[50:58] know that you're the bride to know that
[51:00] these prophecies in the end time are for
[51:02] you you have to know who you are amen
[51:04] not not the birth record not going back
[51:07] a few generations not being able to say
[51:09] i live here my address isn't here you
[51:10] can send me mail here my phone number
[51:12] here that's not the true identity but
[51:14] the true identity is coming through the
[51:16] messenger of the age he's here to tell
[51:18] you i'm not going to call you church
[51:20] anymore because we're done with churches
[51:23] this is right now at the preaching of
[51:25] the seals we're finishing the
[51:27] dispensation of churches amen and we're
[51:29] moving into the dispensation of bride
[51:32] so i'm going to call you no longer
[51:34] church but i'm going to call you bride
[51:36] so that you'll understand this prophecy
[51:39] is for you and it's for now
[51:41] [Applause]
[51:43] because if i'm going to continue calling
[51:45] you church like i did through the church
[51:47] ages you'll not understand you'll hear
[51:50] me preaching the seals you'll hear me
[51:51] talking about the lamb taking the book
[51:53] but if we're still in the church ages
[51:58] we're still under church dispensation
[52:00] you won't know you'll still be thinking
[52:02] future future future but i've got to
[52:05] come and give you your true identity so
[52:07] that you know you're the bride
[52:09] this is the time
[52:11] now all these scriptures are culminating
[52:14] today
[52:16] i no longer call you church i will call
[52:18] you bride
[52:20] so the messenger comes to her and says
[52:27] hell
[52:29] thou are highly favored
[52:33] and the lord is with thee
[52:36] blessed art thou
[52:38] among women
[52:40] when she saw him she was troubled at his
[52:42] saying and cast in her mind what manner
[52:45] of salutation this should be
[52:47] and the angel said unto her fear not
[52:49] mary for thou hast found favor with god
[52:52] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[52:53] womb and bring forth a son and shalt
[52:55] call his name jesus and he shall be
[52:57] great and shall be called the son of the
[52:59] highest and the lord god shall give unto
[53:01] him the throne of his father david
[53:04] and he shall reign over the house of
[53:05] jacob forever and out of his kingdom
[53:08] there shall be no
[53:09] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[53:12] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[53:14] these this be seeing i know not a man
[53:16] she keeps going back to the intellectual
[53:19] side
[53:20] how will i conceive how will i have a
[53:22] son amen i don't even i've never known a
[53:25] man i'm a virgin
[53:28] and the angel answered and said unto her
[53:29] the holy ghost shall come upon thee and
[53:31] the power of the highest shall
[53:32] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[53:35] thing which shall be born in thee shall
[53:36] be called the son of god
[53:38] and behold thy cousin elizabeth she have
[53:42] also conceived a son in her old age and
[53:44] this is the sixth month with her who was
[53:46] called barren for with god nothing shall
[53:48] be impossible
[53:49] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[53:52] lord be it unto me according to thy word
[53:55] and the angel departed from her
[53:59] the angel came
[54:01] and gave her her true identity
[54:05] and then he gave her the word for her
[54:08] day
[54:12] he revealed to her the prophecies that
[54:15] were ready to be fulfilled
[54:18] in her
[54:21] and she had a question an intellectual
[54:23] question and he gave a non-intellectual
[54:25] answer
[54:26] how am i going to conceive she's talking
[54:29] nature he says the holy ghost will
[54:31] overshadow you he's speaking
[54:32] supernatural
[54:34] she's speaking natural he's speaking
[54:36] supernatural
[54:39] see the problem is we've always looked
[54:41] for the natural fulfillment and most of
[54:43] the time it's supernatural
[54:48] that's what they did with john the
[54:49] baptist for one to make a highway in the
[54:51] wilderness
[54:52] cut down the hills and build up the
[54:54] valleys amen make the crooked places
[54:56] straight they were looking for a natural
[54:57] fulfillment it was a spiritual
[54:59] fulfillment
[55:00] amen and now in her she's looking for
[55:03] natural
[55:04] ability to conceive and he's showing her
[55:06] supernatural ability to conceive
[55:09] and after he's done speaking to her he
[55:11] does not touch her reasoning
[55:14] because what he tells her is not
[55:16] reasonable
[55:19] nobody had ever conceived and brought
[55:22] forth a baby not knowing a man
[55:25] what he told her was impossible
[55:27] according to science
[55:30] what he told her was inconceivable it
[55:33] could not work amen he didn't appeal to
[55:36] her reasoning here he was a messenger
[55:38] from almighty god just telling her that
[55:41] this is the word that's going to be
[55:43] fulfilled in you and he cannot
[55:45] intellectually explain it to her he just
[55:48] tells her what it was but something in
[55:50] this exchange happens to her where
[55:52] there's something on the inside of her
[55:54] that can just say be it unto me
[55:56] according to thy word
[55:58] i accept what you say i receive what you
[56:02] say amen there has to be a counterpart
[56:04] in every prophecy there has to be the
[56:07] one where jesus comes along and he tells
[56:09] his disciples come follow me but there
[56:11] has to be the disciple that will
[56:13] actually drop his net and go and follow
[56:16] god is always looking for the one who
[56:18] will bring the prophecy and the one amen
[56:20] who will surrender to the prophecy the
[56:22] one who will bring the word and the one
[56:23] who will submit to the word
[56:25] and so now he brings to mary her
[56:27] position her identity and her portion of
[56:30] the word the portion of the word to be
[56:31] fulfilled in her amen and she can the
[56:34] reasoning just went right out the window
[56:37] how will it happen the holy ghost
[56:38] overshadow you the thing conceived in
[56:39] you shall be oh my how
[56:42] that doesn't answer how
[56:45] scientifically
[56:47] but it answers how
[56:50] and somehow that answer was good enough
[56:52] for this virgin
[56:55] hey man her education was not in
[56:57] reasoning her education was not an
[56:59] intellect her education was in faith
[57:03] to believe the word of god and she said
[57:06] be an unto me
[57:07] according to thy word
[57:10] now
[57:11] after that exchange
[57:15] she now conceives
[57:18] and within her there is a life
[57:22] and that life is the life of the word
[57:26] it's the messiah it's the prophecy the
[57:28] word is now inside of her growing and
[57:31] moving
[57:33] she's changing
[57:36] her appetite's changing her desires are
[57:38] changing her physical form is changing
[57:40] everything about her is now changing
[57:42] amen and now you know
[57:45] she goes forth from there and she's got
[57:47] a lot of difficult things to talk about
[57:49] with people
[57:51] she is under the care of parents she's
[57:52] got to explain to them what happened
[57:54] she's a spouse to a man to be married
[57:56] she has to explain to him that what
[57:57] happened i mean this wasn't something
[57:59] that she was able to keep hidden friends
[58:02] what happened to her quickly become
[58:05] manifested amen
[58:07] and she begins to declare and first she
[58:09] goes and tells her cousin elizabeth but
[58:11] elizabeth has already been awakened to
[58:13] the spiritual fulfillment of prophecy
[58:15] and elizabeth is another woman that's
[58:17] able to catch the prophecy coming from
[58:18] this woman
[58:20] and she tells her and elizabeth starts
[58:23] prophesying and then mary starts
[58:25] prophesying what's happening inside both
[58:27] of these women is the word amen john the
[58:30] baptist the fulfillment of the word
[58:31] inside mary the fulfillment of the word
[58:34] and when the word is inside these women
[58:35] they stand up and begin to prophesy
[58:40] that's why amen and in revelation
[58:43] chapter 10 you come down to first seven
[58:45] there's an end time prophet that's got
[58:46] to come on the scene to prophesy but
[58:48] there's a little group that has to take
[58:50] and eat the book amen the ones that he
[58:52] said i no longer call church but i call
[58:54] you bride now you've got to take this
[58:56] same book and eat it amen and you've got
[58:58] to go and prophesy again
[59:00] why because when the word is in the
[59:03] woman the woman begins to prophesy
[59:05] [Applause]
[59:06] we saw it all the way in the beginning
[59:08] of the new testament friends and we find
[59:10] it all the way at the end of the new
[59:11] testament
[59:13] this is in the word
[59:16] our day is in the word our manifestation
[59:19] is in the word amen this is the word
[59:22] it's laid there in mystery form the
[59:23] intellects couldn't catch it they didn't
[59:25] understand what was happening when when
[59:27] elizabeth was prophesying and mary was a
[59:29] prophesying they missed the whole point
[59:31] they didn't realize what it was when
[59:33] john took and ate the book and
[59:34] prophesied again they didn't realize
[59:36] that these two things are connected
[59:37] together
[59:39] but we don't need the intellectual idea
[59:41] we need the revelation that gives us
[59:43] eyes to see and when you have eyes to
[59:45] see there's no problem seeing what's
[59:47] going on
[59:52] you know from that moment on
[59:57] it didn't matter how many people tried
[1:00:00] to convince mary
[1:00:02] that that child
[1:00:04] was not immaculately conceived
[1:00:09] can you imagine the discussions
[1:00:12] now mary just okay we heard your story
[1:00:15] no seriously tell me the truth
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:22] do you think people have changed any
[1:00:26] mary
[1:00:27] now listen
[1:00:28] you've played your little game long
[1:00:29] enough
[1:00:32] somebody's probably deceived you it's
[1:00:34] probably not your fault
[1:00:40] i'm sure you were in a trap somebody's
[1:00:42] just deceived you
[1:00:44] but it's okay just tell me what really
[1:00:46] happened
[1:00:48] you could not talk her out of it
[1:00:52] there's nothing you can do to convince
[1:00:54] her otherwise the angel came to her gave
[1:00:58] her the identification the holy ghost
[1:01:00] overshadowed her the thing that was
[1:01:01] formed in her was formed supernaturally
[1:01:04] inside of her and she knew it you could
[1:01:06] not talk her out of it amen it was the
[1:01:09] experience that she had
[1:01:11] and she began to grow and the talk was
[1:01:14] around the town maybe not so nice and
[1:01:16] maybe it wasn't always just whispered
[1:01:18] maybe it was loud enough she could
[1:01:20] overhear maybe when she would go to
[1:01:21] fetch water at the well the other women
[1:01:23] would snubber they would they would not
[1:01:25] look at her well they rumors were moving
[1:01:27] around and she would hear amen the
[1:01:29] ripple of them as they moved about and
[1:01:30] every once in a while catch the word
[1:01:32] amen and no doubt it had an effect on
[1:01:34] her emotional side and she probably
[1:01:36] didn't like it and it was probably a
[1:01:37] discouragement to her but no matter what
[1:01:39] was happening she could not deny what
[1:01:42] was going on inside of her that she was
[1:01:44] carrying this prophecy amen it wasn't
[1:01:46] her anymore it was what she had received
[1:01:49] and now what she had received was taking
[1:01:51] over
[1:01:52] and she couldn't stop it from growing
[1:01:54] amen she couldn't stop it from changing
[1:01:56] her life she couldn't stop it from
[1:01:58] changing everything
[1:02:01] and the very things she received amen
[1:02:03] which was the word of the lord is the
[1:02:04] very thing that brought her persecution
[1:02:10] the very word that she received in faith
[1:02:12] is the very thing that caused her
[1:02:14] persecution
[1:02:18] do you think anything's changed
[1:02:24] but you can't talk
[1:02:25] mary
[1:02:26] out of her experience
[1:02:30] you can't change her mind on the
[1:02:31] prophecy
[1:02:33] you think anybody could give her another
[1:02:35] interpretation of a virgin shall
[1:02:37] conceive
[1:02:41] can you imagine her going to church next
[1:02:43] sunday and she's sitting there and the
[1:02:45] scripture reading for that day
[1:02:47] the priest he stands up and he reads
[1:02:48] isaiah chapter 7 and a virgin count
[1:02:51] conceived and he starts to give his
[1:02:53] ideas we know that the nation of israel
[1:02:55] is a great virgin and we know that she's
[1:02:58] the wife of jehovah god and jegovah god
[1:03:00] is going to bring out of this nation the
[1:03:03] prophecy and she's sitting there going
[1:03:04] nope that ain't it
[1:03:06] [Applause]
[1:03:09] amen she may not have had an education
[1:03:11] she may not have been able to read amen
[1:03:13] she may have never been had the same
[1:03:16] level of bible understanding that this
[1:03:18] theologian and his robe had reading the
[1:03:21] scroll that day she may have never
[1:03:22] handled the scroll herself
[1:03:26] but she knew more than that preacher
[1:03:28] knew because that prophecy was inside of
[1:03:30] her
[1:03:31] and nobody could explain that scripture
[1:03:34] different to her she knew what that
[1:03:35] scripture meant that that scripture
[1:03:37] means a virgin shall conceive and a
[1:03:39] virgin's conceived and this is the
[1:03:41] virgin and this is the seed
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:03:45] she could have stood in church and told
[1:03:47] them all and they would have laughed her
[1:03:48] the scorn and run her out and forbid her
[1:03:50] to come back but it would have been the
[1:03:51] truth nonetheless
[1:03:53] it didn't matter how many of them
[1:03:55] accepted it how many of them denied it
[1:03:57] it wouldn't change the fulfillment of
[1:03:59] the word the fulfillment of the word is
[1:04:00] the fulfillment of the word whether we
[1:04:02] like it or don't like it whether we
[1:04:03] agree with it or don't agree with it
[1:04:05] whether they think it's true or we think
[1:04:06] it's false it doesn't change the
[1:04:08] fulfillment of the word is the
[1:04:10] fulfillment of the word
[1:04:12] what was happening in her was isaiah 7
[1:04:15] coming to life and she was now the word
[1:04:18] made manifest for that day
[1:04:20] she was that virgin so she was the word
[1:04:23] made manifest for her day
[1:04:26] and to reject that was to reject the
[1:04:28] word of god
[1:04:34] but i learned in school who cares what
[1:04:37] you learned in school
[1:04:39] but i've always thought who cares what
[1:04:41] you always thought
[1:04:43] we all thought something
[1:04:47] i mean i don't know how many of you just
[1:04:50] i mean gave your heart to the lord and
[1:04:51] poof you got all the prophecies lined up
[1:04:53] right you
[1:04:55] you knew it all first time you heard the
[1:04:57] message i read the seals
[1:04:59] i got it
[1:05:02] talk to me after church
[1:05:09] we all had it wrong
[1:05:11] we all were taught somewhere else we all
[1:05:13] had our own thinking and remember when
[1:05:15] the prophecy becomes the manifestation
[1:05:17] for us when it becomes a revelation amen
[1:05:20] then nobody can talk you out of that
[1:05:21] scripture because it's alive right here
[1:05:23] inside of me
[1:05:24] i'm not waiting for that to happen
[1:05:26] that's already happened you're too late
[1:05:30] can you imagine mary oh my
[1:05:33] after jesus is born
[1:05:35] they're still going to synagogue friends
[1:05:37] they're still going up and 12 years old
[1:05:39] they took him up to the feast
[1:05:41] and they forgot him and left him there
[1:05:43] that's how we know they were going to
[1:05:44] the feast
[1:05:46] can you imagine going to the feast and
[1:05:48] the scripture reading for the day when
[1:05:49] jesus is 12 years old
[1:05:53] a virgin shall conceive
[1:05:56] oh god we're looking for the fulfillment
[1:05:59] of this word amen someday someday
[1:06:03] someday
[1:06:04] you'll fulfill this in a virgin bring
[1:06:06] the virgin oh god someday someday they
[1:06:09] didn't know that some day was their day
[1:06:12] they didn't know that they were too late
[1:06:14] on that prophecy amen it had already
[1:06:16] come to fulfillment it already come into
[1:06:18] manifestation a virgin had already
[1:06:20] conceived and delivered the promised
[1:06:22] child
[1:06:26] praise be to god friends
[1:06:28] amen
[1:06:30] oh i hope the angel has told you who you
[1:06:32] are amen and i hope you had something in
[1:06:34] you say be it unto me according to your
[1:06:37] word
[1:06:40] let's turn to john chapter 9.
[1:06:50] we know this story super well
[1:06:55] there was a man that was born blind
[1:06:58] and jesus healed him
[1:07:00] when he was born blind the pharisees
[1:07:02] began to question him who healed you how
[1:07:04] were you made whole and they kept
[1:07:06] questioning him
[1:07:09] in john chapter 9
[1:07:11] verse 24
[1:07:15] says
[1:07:16] then
[1:07:17] then again
[1:07:19] called they the man that was blind and
[1:07:21] said unto him
[1:07:22] give god the praise we know that this
[1:07:24] man is a sinner
[1:07:28] oh praise god
[1:07:29] you know what they can't deny the fact
[1:07:31] that he can see
[1:07:34] there's a manifestation
[1:07:36] and they can't deny the manifestation
[1:07:39] so they can't deny that this man sees
[1:07:42] he's seeing he's looking at them you
[1:07:44] know you're wearing this color you're
[1:07:45] sitting here i mean you can't deny that
[1:07:47] the man sees
[1:07:48] but they say now give glory to god amen
[1:07:51] that man
[1:07:52] you say healed you he's a sinner
[1:07:56] don't trust him don't listen to him
[1:08:00] don't miss what's happened he's a sinner
[1:08:04] and the man was born blind
[1:08:08] he was born blind jesus comes to him and
[1:08:11] he says do you desire to see say yea
[1:08:13] lord he he he spits in clay and makes
[1:08:15] clay rubs in his eyes and tells him to
[1:08:16] go wash i believe that's the story amen
[1:08:19] and he goes wash and he comes seeing and
[1:08:21] comes rejoicing they begin to question
[1:08:22] him they question his parents they can't
[1:08:24] accept amen what they're seeing they
[1:08:26] cannot accept what's standing in front
[1:08:29] of them
[1:08:32] and here they're they're trying to talk
[1:08:34] him out of his miracle
[1:08:38] they're trying to move him into unbelief
[1:08:42] now you give glory to god this man that
[1:08:45] healed you he's a sinner we know that
[1:08:48] this we know that this man is a sinner
[1:08:50] how do you know who made you god
[1:08:53] because he healed on the sabbath
[1:08:56] you call him a sinner
[1:08:58] because he he did something different
[1:09:01] than your traditional understanding
[1:09:04] by your church tradition now you're
[1:09:07] calling this man a sinner by your church
[1:09:08] tradition
[1:09:13] there was a man who was born blind
[1:09:17] and all the history of the world nobody
[1:09:20] ever hid healed anybody that was born
[1:09:22] blind
[1:09:23] this is what this man tells the
[1:09:24] pharisees
[1:09:26] it's never been heard of that one would
[1:09:29] heal one that was born blind
[1:09:32] and they're looking at the manifestation
[1:09:34] and they're condemning it because
[1:09:36] they're trying to match this
[1:09:37] manifestation with their doctrinal
[1:09:40] understanding by traditional teaching
[1:09:43] and their church tradition is causing
[1:09:46] them to reject what they're looking at
[1:09:49] and now by their tradition they cannot
[1:09:51] see what isn't standing in front of them
[1:09:55] and say we know that this man is a
[1:09:56] sinner
[1:09:58] he answered and said whether he be a
[1:10:00] sinner or no i know that one thing i
[1:10:02] know that whereas i was blind now i see
[1:10:10] you say whatever you want to say
[1:10:13] you call him whatever you want to call
[1:10:15] him you can call brother ben i'm a false
[1:10:17] prophet you can say he got off at the
[1:10:19] end you can say that he didn't know his
[1:10:21] bible real well you can say anything you
[1:10:23] want to say but i'll say this whether he
[1:10:25] was right or wrong or whatever you want
[1:10:27] to say this one thing i know where i was
[1:10:29] spiritually blind i now conceived
[1:10:32] i was denominationally blind i was blind
[1:10:35] by the tradition of the father i could
[1:10:37] not see the bible that i was reading i
[1:10:39] did not understand the words that were
[1:10:40] coming into my mind amen but through
[1:10:42] this messenger amen god has brought a
[1:10:45] revelation that i can now see where i
[1:10:47] was blind i now see you calling false
[1:10:50] prophet that's between you and god but
[1:10:51] where i was blind now i see you
[1:10:56] can you imagine trying to convince this
[1:10:58] man out of his healing and he's walking
[1:10:59] over here and he's seeing grass and he's
[1:11:01] seeing sky and he's seeing the temple
[1:11:02] and he's seeing things that he had felt
[1:11:04] all along the path all of his life and
[1:11:06] he's looking right at it and they're
[1:11:07] saying this man of cinema they have no
[1:11:09] idea what they're talking about
[1:11:12] they're trying to talk him out of his
[1:11:14] healing talk him out of the miracle make
[1:11:16] the very hand that god used an evil or
[1:11:18] wicked hand amen but they missed the
[1:11:20] fact that the man can see he was born
[1:11:23] blind and i come into this world born
[1:11:25] blind spiritually blind under spiritual
[1:11:27] amnesia amen but under this ministry
[1:11:30] which was none other than the son of man
[1:11:32] the ministry of jesus christ himself he
[1:11:34] touched me and he opened my eyes
[1:11:38] and now i see the seven seal mystery
[1:11:40] back in genesis when you look at genesis
[1:11:42] when god made man and out of man he took
[1:11:45] his wife and he united the two together
[1:11:46] in his great masterpiece i can see it
[1:11:49] now
[1:11:49] [Applause]
[1:11:51] when i see why rahab the harlot had to
[1:11:53] marry into judah amen and start
[1:11:55] bethlehem i see it now
[1:11:58] why deborah had to be the fourth
[1:12:00] prophetess and providence had to be the
[1:12:02] fourth judge in israel i see it now
[1:12:08] you say whatever you want but where i
[1:12:09] was blind now i see
[1:12:12] you can believe what you want
[1:12:14] you can say anything you want
[1:12:17] can you imagine can you imagine this man
[1:12:20] he's walking down and he's heard the
[1:12:22] gurgling of a stream he walked by it
[1:12:24] every day he could feel how cool it was
[1:12:26] but he never saw how beautiful it was
[1:12:31] and he wanted to know what it looked
[1:12:32] like of course
[1:12:34] but now he sees it
[1:12:37] and they say
[1:12:39] give glory to god that man's a sinner
[1:12:45] i'm looking at the stream
[1:12:49] the temple i used to walk up to and pray
[1:12:51] for my healing i'm touching the stone
[1:12:52] i'm seeing the stone
[1:12:56] the horn i used to hear blow to bring us
[1:12:58] to prayer i'm looking at the man below
[1:13:00] the horn
[1:13:04] call him what you want
[1:13:07] call him what you want
[1:13:09] but where i was blind now i see
[1:13:16] tell me who could make that man unsee
[1:13:22] once god opened his eyes
[1:13:25] who could make that man unsee
[1:13:30] he could see every day he woke up he
[1:13:31] could see everywhere he looked he could
[1:13:33] see he could just see
[1:13:36] that's why when god has opened our eyes
[1:13:38] to this ministry his ministry the
[1:13:40] ministry of the son of man he's opened
[1:13:42] our eyes and we can see every day you
[1:13:44] listen to a tape you can see you read
[1:13:46] your bible you can see you hear the
[1:13:48] preaching of the word you can see who
[1:13:50] cares what anybody says call him a
[1:13:52] sinner whether he is sinner or not
[1:13:54] whatever you want to say but i know one
[1:13:56] thing i could not see my bible now i see
[1:13:58] it amen
[1:14:00] it was discombobulated it was old
[1:14:02] testament new testament 66 different
[1:14:04] books it was confusing because this part
[1:14:06] didn't match this part and i didn't
[1:14:07] understand why they did that there and
[1:14:09] why they did this here but where i was
[1:14:11] blind now i see
[1:14:15] you can say what you want about this
[1:14:17] message
[1:14:19] but it's christ
[1:14:23] and you know what
[1:14:25] i'm not offended whatever you say
[1:14:27] it's okay
[1:14:29] because i see
[1:14:32] like can you imagine the man oh praise
[1:14:34] god
[1:14:35] he leaves the council for him it's kind
[1:14:37] of comical
[1:14:39] he said i've told you once i'll tell you
[1:14:41] again why do you ask do you want to be
[1:14:43] his disciple we're moses disciple
[1:14:47] they're offended they're all upset he's
[1:14:50] the one who can see they're blind he can
[1:14:52] see
[1:14:56] they're now blind he can see they're
[1:14:58] confused by his vision
[1:15:00] he's confused by their blindness
[1:15:07] they can't even speak the same language
[1:15:12] can you imagine him walking away from
[1:15:13] there
[1:15:14] i don't think he was mad
[1:15:16] it's my personal opinion
[1:15:18] i don't think by the way he exchanged
[1:15:20] with him i don't think he was
[1:15:22] angry i think he walked out of there and
[1:15:25] saw the door he was walking out and saw
[1:15:26] the road he was walking on he saw the
[1:15:28] blue sky when he got outside and saw his
[1:15:30] mother and father for the first time and
[1:15:32] i i don't think he was upset
[1:15:36] he came out on top
[1:15:41] if you can see if god has given you ice
[1:15:44] have to see if you've been in the
[1:15:45] laodicean age and he says buy of me i
[1:15:48] have amen gold tried in the fire if
[1:15:50] you've gone to him and got the isab that
[1:15:52] opened your eyes that you can see and
[1:15:54] you've got the white raiment and you've
[1:15:55] got the gold in your pocket amen why do
[1:15:57] you care what anybody says about it i
[1:16:00] can see i've got the garment i've got
[1:16:02] the gold jingling in my pockets i don't
[1:16:04] care what you say
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:07] i mean like i can be greed for you i can
[1:16:09] be disheartened because you're you don't
[1:16:11] see it i can be confused by your
[1:16:13] blindness but you're not going to get me
[1:16:15] to unseat i'm not going to take the gold
[1:16:17] out of my pocket
[1:16:19] and drop it on the ground because you
[1:16:20] say this is a false prophet and he got
[1:16:22] off at the end and he doesn't know his
[1:16:23] bible
[1:16:26] okay
[1:16:37] that's not a white garment that's not
[1:16:39] real gold and you can't really see
[1:16:47] you weren't really impregnated by a
[1:16:49] visitation of holy ghost you were with a
[1:16:50] man
[1:16:53] if that's what you want to believe
[1:16:57] she knew the truth
[1:17:01] so i don't understand this getting angry
[1:17:02] and getting upset because somebody else
[1:17:04] doesn't believe
[1:17:08] i think we should enjoy our vision
[1:17:11] i think we should just move on and be
[1:17:13] happy about what we can see
[1:17:17] praise god
[1:17:19] god is so good friends
[1:17:22] prophet of god said in the message
[1:17:24] trying to do god a service without it
[1:17:26] being god's will so now he reveals these
[1:17:28] things by his foreknowledge to those who
[1:17:31] he has ordained to these things
[1:17:32] otherwise they don't see it
[1:17:34] standing right there looking right at it
[1:17:36] and he can't see it
[1:17:38] how many ever seen the picture of a cow
[1:17:39] in the bush that you just have to look
[1:17:41] and look did you ever see that or see
[1:17:43] the picture of christ in a bush or in a
[1:17:44] sky or clouds and the painter has got it
[1:17:46] that's so fixed up until you have to
[1:17:48] look at it just a certain way
[1:17:51] well then when you once see it you can't
[1:17:53] see nothing else but that
[1:17:56] every time you look there it is how many
[1:17:58] seen those pictures well sure you have
[1:18:00] well that's the way christ is himself
[1:18:06] the gospel the message
[1:18:09] when you once see the message of the
[1:18:10] hour there's nothing else you can see
[1:18:12] but that
[1:18:15] listen friends
[1:18:18] when god opens the book
[1:18:21] and you see
[1:18:22] the plan of redemption and you see all
[1:18:25] the loose ends tied together you can't
[1:18:28] see nothing else
[1:18:34] take away the message and everything the
[1:18:36] messenger brought us and you explained
[1:18:38] to me why there had to be a blood
[1:18:39] sacrifice
[1:18:44] why did a human have to die and why
[1:18:45] wasn't the lamb good enough
[1:18:53] how many gods are there three persons
[1:18:55] equal one god or just one god
[1:19:01] why did he have to be virgin born
[1:19:06] i think sometimes we don't realize how
[1:19:08] much we see
[1:19:10] how clear our vision is
[1:19:12] how much the book's been opened to us
[1:19:15] how much this message has taken us from
[1:19:17] blindness to vision
[1:19:19] to clear vision getting clear and clear
[1:19:21] all the time friends
[1:19:24] amen you tell me he's wrong brother ben
[1:19:27] was wrong about that serpent seed
[1:19:29] okay
[1:19:31] i mean
[1:19:32] you do whatever you have to do to make
[1:19:34] it work
[1:19:36] but when you see you see i mean you
[1:19:38] can't go blind again
[1:19:41] he was wrong about the godhead
[1:19:44] all right
[1:19:46] you make three personalities and three
[1:19:48] persons in one and not make it an oddity
[1:19:50] or a psychological disorder
[1:19:58] multiple personalities
[1:20:00] i think still the cycle i don't know
[1:20:03] most everything's okay now but
[1:20:07] they probably get employment preferences
[1:20:09] now for diversity
[1:20:13] but see once you see you can never go
[1:20:15] back to blindness
[1:20:17] once you see you can never unsee
[1:20:21] and you're reading the same scriptures
[1:20:22] you read all your life but now you see
[1:20:26] the man was walking the same path he
[1:20:28] walked all the lights but now he sees
[1:20:30] amen he's going to the same places but
[1:20:32] now he sees he's touching the same thing
[1:20:34] but now he sees
[1:20:37] and now we're reading the same bible but
[1:20:39] now we see
[1:20:41] we see we see we see
[1:20:45] once you see the message there's nothing
[1:20:47] else you can see but that
[1:20:50] they say what about those who've left
[1:20:52] the message they never saw it
[1:20:58] oh we saw it no you never saw it
[1:21:01] like you saw doctrines
[1:21:04] and teachings
[1:21:05] and caught the intellectual part of
[1:21:07] reading and taking that and tying it to
[1:21:09] scripture and putting together and you
[1:21:10] were able to read and you were able to
[1:21:11] listen to somebody tie some points
[1:21:13] together and it made it reasonable and
[1:21:15] so like water baptism in jesus name
[1:21:17] brother bram said doesn't even take a
[1:21:18] revelation like somebody can tie that
[1:21:20] together and you can recognize that the
[1:21:22] bible bap in the bible they baptize in
[1:21:24] jesus name
[1:21:28] but if you ever really see the message
[1:21:33] you recognize that this message is
[1:21:35] christ
[1:21:40] see once you really see the message
[1:21:43] and you know the message is christ
[1:21:45] then you can't leave christ
[1:21:49] now if you see the message and the
[1:21:50] messages doctrines and teachings you can
[1:21:52] leave the message
[1:21:54] of doctrines and teachings
[1:21:58] but once you see christ
[1:22:01] how can you leave christ
[1:22:04] why would you leave christ
[1:22:08] the prophet says judas couldn't
[1:22:09] understand it he walked right with him
[1:22:12] he didn't see it
[1:22:17] i liked that one
[1:22:19] try to tell judas he didn't see it
[1:22:22] try to convince him he didn't understand
[1:22:24] the ministry of jesus christ
[1:22:27] tried to get judas to believe that he
[1:22:29] didn't see jesus
[1:22:33] i saw him every day i was his treasurer
[1:22:35] i carried the money back come here come
[1:22:37] here come here you
[1:22:38] tell this man that i was jesus treasurer
[1:22:42] yeah he was jesus treasurer
[1:22:44] and i went with him everywhere yeah i
[1:22:45] saw him go see i knew jesus you never
[1:22:47] knew him
[1:22:51] you saw but you didn't see
[1:22:54] because the seeing jesus was talking
[1:22:56] about was not the seeing with these eyes
[1:23:00] but it was seen with these eyes
[1:23:03] and the seeing that matters in the
[1:23:05] scriptures is the seeing with these eyes
[1:23:07] not these eyes
[1:23:09] how many people saw noah's boat
[1:23:12] what was that the fulfillment of the
[1:23:14] word of god the manifestation of the
[1:23:15] word of god what was it salvation for
[1:23:18] that day how many saw did you see the
[1:23:19] boat i saw the boat but they never saw
[1:23:21] what the boat was
[1:23:22] they thought it was some crazy man's
[1:23:24] idea they thought it was a eccentric man
[1:23:26] with an eccentric project they thought
[1:23:28] it was some novelty some something to go
[1:23:30] and laugh about
[1:23:32] they didn't see what it was
[1:23:35] but they saw it
[1:23:36] judah saw jesus but he didn't know jesus
[1:23:39] or he would have never left him he
[1:23:41] walked right with him but judas
[1:23:44] didn't
[1:23:45] see it
[1:23:50] i'm not going to get finished so i'm not
[1:23:52] even going to try
[1:23:56] let's go to revelation chapter 5.
[1:24:18] verse 1
[1:24:19] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[1:24:21] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:24:23] and on the backside
[1:24:25] sealed with seven seals
[1:24:28] and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a
[1:24:30] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[1:24:32] book
[1:24:33] and to loose the seals thereof and no
[1:24:35] man in heaven nor on earth neither under
[1:24:37] the earth was able to open the book
[1:24:39] neither to look there on
[1:24:40] and i wept much because no man was found
[1:24:42] worthy to open and to read the book
[1:24:44] neither to look thereon
[1:24:46] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[1:24:48] not behold the lion the tribe of judah
[1:24:51] the root of david hath prevailed to open
[1:24:53] the book and to loose the seven seals
[1:24:55] thereof
[1:24:56] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[1:24:58] throne into the four beasts and in the
[1:25:00] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:25:02] had been slain having seven horns and
[1:25:05] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:25:07] of god sent forth into all the earth
[1:25:10] and he came he took the book out of the
[1:25:12] right hand
[1:25:13] of him that sat upon the throne
[1:25:17] john saw a book
[1:25:19] in the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:25:21] the throne and we know that this is the
[1:25:23] book of redemption the title deed to all
[1:25:25] creation and it was sealed with seven
[1:25:28] seals and there was a cry from a strong
[1:25:30] angel that said who was worthy to open
[1:25:32] the book
[1:25:34] and no man in heaven had to be a man
[1:25:38] because redemption was paid for by a man
[1:25:41] now to take the claims of redemption
[1:25:43] must be a man
[1:25:45] because man lost the title deed it's got
[1:25:47] to be restored by man because once you
[1:25:49] see you see
[1:25:53] no man in heaven nor on earth neither
[1:25:55] under the earth was able to open the
[1:25:56] book neither to look there on and i
[1:25:59] wept much
[1:26:03] i wept much because no man was found
[1:26:05] worthy to
[1:26:06] open and to read the book neither to
[1:26:09] look there on
[1:26:11] brother bam said why was john weeping
[1:26:16] in the message i think it's the breach
[1:26:17] he says
[1:26:18] somebody said john was weeping because
[1:26:20] he wasn't worthy he said anybody with
[1:26:21] the holy ghost would know better than
[1:26:23] that
[1:26:26] he said john was weeping because that
[1:26:27] was the title deed to all creation
[1:26:31] that was the book of redemption if there
[1:26:33] was no kinsmen redeemer to come forth
[1:26:35] and take the book if nobody was found
[1:26:37] worthy then all creation would be lost
[1:26:46] jesus christ at this point had already
[1:26:49] come and paid the price
[1:26:51] the blood was already shed
[1:26:54] which purchased back all of creation
[1:26:59] he already shed the blood that would
[1:27:01] purchase everything that was lost he
[1:27:03] already paid the redemptive price but
[1:27:06] there was two parts to redemption
[1:27:09] first he must pay the redemption price
[1:27:12] then after he paid the redemption price
[1:27:15] at the right time he must make
[1:27:17] redemption claims
[1:27:20] and although the redemption price was
[1:27:22] paid in a.d 33 amen christ has been
[1:27:26] sitting on the throne in his mediator
[1:27:29] work of intercession amen waiting until
[1:27:32] he's got a bride that's ready to take
[1:27:33] the throne and after he's got a bride
[1:27:36] that's ready to take the throne now he
[1:27:38] can come forth as kinsman redeemer and
[1:27:40] take the book that he's purchased
[1:27:44] in between paying the price of
[1:27:45] redemption and claiming the book amen
[1:27:48] he's building himself a bride through
[1:27:50] seven church ages
[1:27:51] one that will sit on the throne with him
[1:27:53] and rule amen with him for a thousand
[1:27:56] years there will be a joint heir with
[1:27:58] him
[1:27:59] and so now although the redemption price
[1:28:02] was paid the blood was shed and the
[1:28:04] blood was thorough the blood was
[1:28:06] sufficient the price was paid here is
[1:28:09] john looking at a scene in heaven with a
[1:28:11] book in the in the hand of the original
[1:28:13] owner and a cry goes is there any man
[1:28:15] that can take the book and no man was
[1:28:17] found worthy he begins to weep amen he's
[1:28:20] weeping but there's already blood been
[1:28:21] shed
[1:28:23] so something else has to happen for
[1:28:26] redemption
[1:28:28] amen the blood was shed but john's
[1:28:30] weeping
[1:28:34] i hope you understand friends amen we
[1:28:37] get stuck in denominational ideas and
[1:28:39] everybody wants to to go back and go
[1:28:41] back and go back but god's doing
[1:28:43] something now
[1:28:45] he did what he did then to make a way
[1:28:47] for what he's doing now
[1:28:49] he had 2 000 years ago to pay the price
[1:28:52] of redemption to shed his own blood
[1:28:53] which was the blood of god which was the
[1:28:55] exchange price for that book of
[1:28:57] redemption
[1:29:00] but he wouldn't come and claim it till
[1:29:02] after the seven church ages
[1:29:05] and then at the end of the seven church
[1:29:07] ages he's going to stick forward and
[1:29:09] claim what he's paid for and claim what
[1:29:11] he's mediated for
[1:29:13] and john comes to this point amen in the
[1:29:16] vision and he sees him sitting on the
[1:29:18] throne with the book of redemption in
[1:29:19] his hand and john is weeping but you say
[1:29:22] look at calvary i've looked at calvary i
[1:29:25] was john was standing at calvary
[1:29:32] this is the same man that was standing
[1:29:33] at calvary and jesus looked down and
[1:29:35] said woman my son son thy mother
[1:29:39] same john john was standing at calvary
[1:29:41] he knew the blood was shed he saw him in
[1:29:44] his resurrection he knew that he was the
[1:29:46] resurrection in the life he was there at
[1:29:48] pentecost when the baptism of the holy
[1:29:50] ghost came down he knew all of that
[1:29:53] story but here he stands in revelation
[1:29:55] chapter 5 and he's weeping because all
[1:29:57] redemption will be lost if does somebody
[1:30:00] doesn't come and take that book
[1:30:04] amen people want to reject the prophet
[1:30:07] they want to reject the end time
[1:30:08] prophecy you're rejecting your own
[1:30:10] redemption amen
[1:30:12] you're rejecting the fulfillment of
[1:30:14] everything jesus died for everything
[1:30:16] he's interceded for for seven church
[1:30:18] ages you want to reject this message and
[1:30:20] reject the opening of the seals you're
[1:30:22] rejecting your own redemption
[1:30:26] if you don't believe the lamb has taken
[1:30:28] the book you better start weeping like
[1:30:30] john was weeping because you've been
[1:30:32] lifted up to see what john saw that
[1:30:34] there's a book that needs to be opened
[1:30:36] it's the book of redemption you heard
[1:30:38] the prophet say it and now you're
[1:30:39] looking at this book of redemption you
[1:30:41] don't have any place to rejoice if it's
[1:30:43] not open yet you should be weeping and
[1:30:45] mourning hoping that somebody will come
[1:30:47] forth and take that book
[1:30:49] [Applause]
[1:30:56] but when john was weeping
[1:31:01] one of the elders
[1:31:03] i wonder which elder
[1:31:06] there's 24 choices
[1:31:09] 12 of them are apostles and 12 of them
[1:31:12] are patriarchs
[1:31:14] one of the 12 apostles
[1:31:16] is john
[1:31:21] i don't know which one it was so don't
[1:31:22] ask me
[1:31:23] but i have my own thoughts on it
[1:31:28] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[1:31:30] not
[1:31:31] behold the lion of the tribe of judas
[1:31:33] the root of david hath prevailed to open
[1:31:35] the book and to loose the seven seals
[1:31:37] thereof
[1:31:38] stop weeping
[1:31:41] because the kinsman redeemer's coming
[1:31:43] forth
[1:31:46] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[1:31:48] throne unto the four beasts and in the
[1:31:49] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:31:51] had been slain having seven horns and
[1:31:53] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:31:55] of god sent forth on all the earth and
[1:31:57] he came and he took the book out of the
[1:31:59] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:32:01] throne
[1:32:02] and when he had taken the book and the
[1:32:04] four beasts and the four and twenty
[1:32:05] elders fell down before the lamb having
[1:32:07] every one of them harps and golden vials
[1:32:09] full of the odors which are the prayers
[1:32:11] of the saints and they sung a new song
[1:32:13] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[1:32:16] to open the seals thereof for thou was
[1:32:18] slain
[1:32:19] and has redeemed us to god by thy blood
[1:32:21] out of every kindred and tongue and
[1:32:22] people and nation it has made us unto
[1:32:25] our god kings and priests and we shall
[1:32:27] reign on the earth
[1:32:28] and i beheld and i heard the voice of
[1:32:31] many angels round about the throne and
[1:32:32] the beast and the elders and the number
[1:32:34] of them was ten thousand times ten
[1:32:36] thousand and thousands of thousands
[1:32:38] saying with a loud voice worthy is the
[1:32:40] lamb that was slain to receive power and
[1:32:42] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:32:44] and glory
[1:32:46] and every creature which is in heaven
[1:32:48] and on earth and under the earth and
[1:32:50] such as are in the sea and all that are
[1:32:52] in them heard i
[1:32:55] whose eye
[1:32:56] john the one who was weeping
[1:32:59] heard i saying blessing and honor and
[1:33:01] glory and power unto him that sitteth
[1:33:04] upon the throne and unto the lamb
[1:33:05] forever and ever all john's mourning
[1:33:09] turned into rejoicing amen john what
[1:33:12] moved john from morning to rejoicing one
[1:33:14] thing he saw the lamb take the book amen
[1:33:17] and when he saw the lamb took the book
[1:33:19] he now knew we've come to the fullness
[1:33:21] of redemption there's a kinsman redeemer
[1:33:23] on the scene to take the book and loose
[1:33:25] the seals now i don't have to weep
[1:33:27] anymore now it's rejoicing
[1:33:33] my question to you is if you've seen the
[1:33:35] lamb take the book
[1:33:37] do not think intellectually don't think
[1:33:40] naturally and don't use these eyeballs
[1:33:46] because judas used these eyeballs and he
[1:33:48] missed the fulfillment of the word amen
[1:33:50] but peter used a different set of eyes
[1:33:54] and he caught that this is christ the
[1:33:56] son of the living god it wasn't these
[1:33:58] eyes that told him it wasn't this mind
[1:34:00] that told him but he had another source
[1:34:02] of gathering information amen he had
[1:34:04] another kind of seeing about him
[1:34:07] and by revelation he saw that this was
[1:34:09] the son of the living god
[1:34:15] i ask you are you mourning
[1:34:17] or rejoicing
[1:34:21] is all lost and still weighing in the
[1:34:23] balance for you hoping that someday it
[1:34:25] will work out are you on this end saying
[1:34:27] my redeemer liveth and he standeth upon
[1:34:30] the earth in the last day and i know
[1:34:32] that everything i've lost has been
[1:34:33] restored back to me i've already got it
[1:34:36] it's already done it's already finished
[1:34:38] the seals are already open i don't have
[1:34:40] anything to mourn about all i have to do
[1:34:42] is be excited and rejoice
[1:34:46] he's turned our mourning into gladness
[1:34:48] amen he's turned our sadness into joy
[1:34:54] but brother chad we still have to go to
[1:34:56] work and we still have to pay bills and
[1:34:58] amen what do you think they did after
[1:35:01] pentecost
[1:35:06] after pain what was pentecost the
[1:35:07] fulfillment of the word
[1:35:11] after the fulfillment of the word that
[1:35:13] came there was a manifestation of the
[1:35:14] word they became the manifestation they
[1:35:16] became the living word for their day
[1:35:21] and what did they have to do
[1:35:23] go to work
[1:35:24] bake some bread
[1:35:26] preach the gospel
[1:35:28] get arrested
[1:35:33] well i thought at the fulfillment of the
[1:35:34] word everything would work out right
[1:35:37] it was working out right
[1:35:39] the word was being filled it was
[1:35:40] supernaturally being fulfilled and
[1:35:42] fleshed down in flesh and people were
[1:35:44] still abusing them throwing stones at
[1:35:46] them calling them names chasing them out
[1:35:48] of jerusalem scattering them to other
[1:35:49] places
[1:35:52] but i thought you said this was the
[1:35:54] promise being fulfilled it is the
[1:35:56] promise being fulfilled
[1:36:00] but we still get sick
[1:36:02] we still had somebody die we had a
[1:36:04] funeral the other day
[1:36:07] i don't understand
[1:36:08] peter you said
[1:36:10] you said that he's the resurrection and
[1:36:12] the life and the resurrection in life
[1:36:14] has come back to us it has
[1:36:17] but it is a spiritual fulfillment not a
[1:36:19] natural fulfillment it's a spiritual
[1:36:21] fulfillment manifesting in the natural
[1:36:23] fulfillment but they were still subject
[1:36:25] to elements of rain of hunger of
[1:36:28] sickness of disease of peril of stoning
[1:36:31] of persecutions of chasing from city to
[1:36:33] city having to work for their meat
[1:36:38] when they were in prison and god needed
[1:36:39] him out he opened the doors he took him
[1:36:41] out
[1:36:43] but when paul went in prison god didn't
[1:36:45] need him out he needed him in prison so
[1:36:46] he could write the epistles and testify
[1:36:48] in rome
[1:36:49] so paul couldn't open the prison doors
[1:36:53] it wasn't about them having power to say
[1:36:56] i won't be arrested at all eating no no
[1:36:58] more rain on me it rained on paul in his
[1:37:01] journey he was caught in the middle of a
[1:37:03] terrible storm for 14 days
[1:37:07] he was shipwrecked he spent a night in
[1:37:09] the day in the sea
[1:37:14] but i thought he was the prophet for the
[1:37:15] age
[1:37:17] i thought he was the fulfillment of the
[1:37:18] prophecy in isaiah that he would be a
[1:37:20] light to the gentiles the fulfillment of
[1:37:22] the word should always be like super
[1:37:23] powerful super great and nothing bad
[1:37:25] should ever happen to the fulfillment of
[1:37:26] the word
[1:37:30] paul every day he was walking he was
[1:37:33] isaiah's prophecy in flesh
[1:37:36] a light to lighten the gentiles
[1:37:41] but he would still be taken out of the
[1:37:42] city and stoned and left for dead
[1:37:45] they would still spit on him and mock
[1:37:46] him and make fun of him
[1:37:48] he would still be hungry
[1:37:50] he would still be shipwrecked
[1:37:53] he would be lied about he'd be cheated
[1:37:55] on he would be
[1:37:57] he would be praised and acclaimed
[1:38:01] he would still be living in this
[1:38:03] dimension
[1:38:05] but manifesting a reality from another
[1:38:07] dimension
[1:38:09] the word made flesh
[1:38:14] i say it's time for us to rejoice
[1:38:18] if your eyes have seen the lamb take the
[1:38:20] book
[1:38:22] oh have you seen the lamb take the book
[1:38:25] has he opened the seals how do you know
[1:38:27] i heard the thunders amen i heard the
[1:38:30] voice of god i heard the unspoken part
[1:38:32] of the word amen the word was put in
[1:38:34] that prophet's hand that word was sent
[1:38:36] down to him now it's been given to me
[1:38:38] i've ate it i'm one with it i'm
[1:38:40] prophesying again
[1:38:42] there's nothing for me to be sad about
[1:38:44] i'm rejoicing because he's here claiming
[1:38:47] me i'm what he was dying for i'm the one
[1:38:49] he was interceding for i'm the
[1:38:51] manifestation of the bride for this day
[1:38:53] amen he's here he's in me this is the
[1:38:56] hour he's taken the book he's loosed the
[1:38:58] seals
[1:39:01] i didn't see it i did
[1:39:06] did you see it
[1:39:08] oh if you heard the thunders you saw it
[1:39:10] friends if you knew what happened you
[1:39:12] saw it amen the book has been opened and
[1:39:14] you saw it now you're not reading from a
[1:39:16] closed book you're reading from an open
[1:39:17] book because you see it
[1:39:21] oh praise god do you see where we put
[1:39:24] ourselves in this end time ministry if
[1:39:26] we leave the book closed and leave it
[1:39:28] sealed amen you've got to go back to
[1:39:29] mourning and weeping and praying for a
[1:39:31] kinsman redeemer but the kinsmen
[1:39:33] redeemer has come the seals have opened
[1:39:36] the thunders have sounded
[1:39:40] redemption is coming in fullness he's
[1:39:42] here claiming his bride you're the
[1:39:45] inheritance he's claiming today
[1:39:50] i thought we would have power you do
[1:39:52] have power
[1:39:57] when god needs to do something
[1:40:00] say something
[1:40:02] pray something

[1:40:16] exactly like it was
[1:40:18] after pentecost
[1:40:21] what are you looking for in the
[1:40:22] fulfillment of this word
[1:40:24] we've already seen it there

[1:40:29] everything they say comes to pass
[1:40:32] twitch their finger and dinner shows up
[1:40:38] how about a people who have eyes to see
[1:40:41] and hears to hear
[1:40:43] and can see christ in their day
[1:40:46] what about those who were born blind
[1:40:48] but now they see

[1:40:53] sing

[1:41:03] sweet in the mouth i tasted and i saw
[1:41:06] that the lord is good and it was sweet
[1:41:08] amen but i know what it's like for it to
[1:41:10] be bitter in the belly i've experienced

[1:41:16] living revelation 10 8-11
[1:41:20] i have ate the book what book did you

[1:41:35] how precious every bite is
[1:41:37] how it keeps you wanting to come back
[1:41:39] for more
[1:41:40] but you also know when digestion kicks
[1:41:43] in and you become one with that word and
[1:41:45] it brings a change and a reproach and it
[1:41:47] brings a ridicule and a separation you
[1:41:50] know what it's like for it to be bitter
[1:41:51] in the belly

[1:42:09] thunders
[1:42:10] and by god's grace
[1:42:13] that book has come down to me
[1:42:17] and the very thing that john wasn't
[1:42:19] allowed to look at
[1:42:21] or even to look upon
[1:42:23] or to read
[1:42:25] is the very thing that we're feeding on
