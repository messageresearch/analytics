[0:00] there may be tough circumstances we may
[0:02] have to work through a few things we we
[0:03] may have to make apologies and make
[0:05] things right but it doesn't change the
[0:07] truth the truth is you're loved you're
[0:10] highly favored amen the angel came to
[0:13] Mary and Mary was there amen she was
[0:15] just a young girl in a no-name place
[0:16] from a no-name uh situation and she was
[0:19] going to get married and who knows what
[0:21] she's been told all her life she might
[0:22] have been told you know you're kind of
[0:23] an odd person you're a little different
[0:25] her mom might have said you know if you
[0:26] would change this and this you know some
[0:28] boys might marry you
[0:30] I don't know but that's happened to
[0:33] people you know what that starts to do
[0:35] in people makes a lie I'm not nobody
[0:38] wants me my mom thinks that I'm not
[0:42] attractive and if I did this different
[0:45] that starts a lie and a girl starts to
[0:48] believe that lie she has to change
[0:50] something about her appearance herself
[0:52] Amen to attract that's a
[0:54] lie who knows what Mary had heard who
[0:56] knows what she went through who knows if
[0:58] she was rejected not rejected
[1:00] rejected but something happened when she
[1:02] went to the well that day when the angel
[1:04] Gabriel came to her he gave her a true
[1:10] identification he said behold thou
[1:13] highly favored of the
[1:15] Lord it didn't matter at that moment it
[1:18] didn't matter what anybody else had ever
[1:20] said about her if it was her mom if it
[1:22] was her dad if it was an old boyfriend
[1:24] if it was her siblings it did not matter
[1:27] anymore because God had called her
[1:29] highly favored and in the eyes of God
[1:32] she was highly favored chosen The Chosen
[1:35] vessel of God to bring forth Jesus
[1:36] Christ and I'm telling you today there's
[1:38] been an angel that has come to you that
[1:40] said behold highly favored of the Lord
[1:43] you say how do I know it's me because I
[1:45] believe it I heard the eagle scream
[1:47] something in me said that's nothing but
[1:49] the truth it wasn't my emotions it
[1:51] wasn't an education amen something in me
[1:54] responded to the word and what is that
[1:56] it's the Lord saying
[1:58] behold thou highly favored of the Lord
[2:01] You're The Chosen vessel to bring forth
[2:04] Christ in this generation it's you what
[2:07] you need to do is let it come out of
[2:08] your mouth don't be afraid because of
[2:10] the past because rejection because of
[2:12] feelings but take the word and say I've
[2:15] been chosen before the foundation of the
[2:17] world I am part of Christ and he's
[2:19] chosen me to manifest himself in this
[2:21] same
[2:23] time how do you know it I only have one
[2:25] indication and that's because I believe
[2:28] him that's it
[2:30] I don't have any other proof I don't
[2:31] have any other evidence I don't have
[2:33] birth records I don't
[2:35] have but I have
[2:38] faith and if Faith saved zakus and if
[2:41] Faith saved the woman at the well and if
[2:43] Faith saved the woman who washes feet
[2:46] then it's faith that has saved me and
[2:49] redeemed me because I've come to the
[2:52] same place they came to I came to the
[2:55] anointed word made manifest for the day
[2:57] and when I came to the living Jesus
[2:59] Christ Christ the word for this day and
[3:01] I anointed and I washed it I respected
[3:03] and I believed it and I confessed my
[3:06] sins salvation has come this
[3:09] day the truth has set us free
