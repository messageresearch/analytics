for keeping us safe along the roads and giving us safe passage Lord and allowing us this opportunity once again to gather to hear your word Lord and God we want to give you honor respect and love and adoration and we want to surrender ourselves to you we've set this time aside that we can gather together your children Lord according to your word believing in your promise that you promised us you would be gathered with us and now we come Lord according to your way according to your promise according to your word and now we're with expectation Lord expecting to see you keep your promise to us would you come now Lord and feed your Lambs would you come and give us that portion Lord for today that fresh Mana from Heaven that breaking of the bread that only you can do Lord God we yield ourselves to this we surrender ourselves both speaker and hearer Lord that we all might be used of you for your great purpose in this hour that we live may you come and speak freely Lord we pray that you bless our brother Kyle's he's across town ministering Lord at bible Believers strengthen him give him inspiration Lord and wisdom and may be able to relax and just share what's on his heart Lord and may it be a blessing there as well we're trusting in you Lord this morning and may you bless us and all that we say and do May be pleasing to you and bring honor and glory to your name in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you man while we're standing let's just take if you would take your Bibles with me and turn to Galatians uh chapter 4 uh you heard the testimony that Brock gave of his cousin Abby getting baptized that was such a blessing on Thursday he called me Thursday morning and and you know Brock said I've got a problem I said well what's the problem and he started telling me the story of talking to his cousin and her desire to be baptized I said brother that's no problem that's that's one of the best problems we've had you know I like those kind of problems so it was just by the grace of God we were able to put it together she came over that afternoon and we baptized her here in the baptistry and there was a few of the folks here brother John and sister Rachel pitsenberger were here and brother Franco and Sister Amy were here and Brock and Kylie were here and amen it was such a blessing to see her take the step that she knew was the next step to take and she still has a lot of questions a lot of things that she doesn't understand she's heard a lot of things for the first time a lot of things that were new but when when God challenged her with the word she was able to Humble whatever she thought and accept that word and I just I I believe God will honor his promise I know he will cuz it's a promise and that she will receive what she desires amen so just remember to keep her in prayer but that was a quite a blessing amen that was exciting so if any of you ever if any of you run into problems like that don't hesitate to call me it's our pleasure and then then he apologized later I'm sorry brother Chad I'm sorry I said how are you apologizing brother you've made my day you know so that was a wonderful blessing so we're thankful for that also just before we read the scripture I just want to remind you that my family and I will be going away for a few days from this Wednesday to Saturday so brother Benjamin seabolt will be uh he scheduled to minister this Wednesday so I just be remembering him in prayer and the service in prayer and also uh we'll get back on Saturday but I've asked brother Gabe to preach this Sunday this following Sunday and so brother Gabe Smith has agreed to take that service so remember him in prayer as well and then just pray for us also we wouldd appreciate that amen let's turn uh to Galatians chapter 4 and look at verse 19 Galatians 4 and 19 the Apostle Paul writes my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you amen God bless you as you have your seats amen it's all these little nugget scriptures that mean so much to us amen and why does it mean so much to us because of the opening of the seals because of the revealing of the mystery of God God opening his mind and revealing to us his great plan and these little nuggets that have been laying in the Bible amen all these years in this end time have been taken out and Polished up for us amen and now they just shine with such light amen I I just want to uh stop for a minute before I go on preaching once I start with the scripture I'm usually Off to the Races but I just want to uh take a minute to appreciate Brother Joseph Scott for cleaning up the parking lot for us amen he was here uh yesterday afternoon and laid down a layer of salt ahead of time then he came back at 6:00 this morning laid down another layer of salt and then about an hour and a half later he touched it up with another layer of Sal so we just appreciate him putting in all his effort for all of us amen so that we could come today also really appreciate our trustees they do all the work behind the scenes that nobody knows and it's good because if you know then usually it's bad I mean it's better if you have no idea but they make sure we have the equipment we need the supplies we need the schedule and everything so that we don't really have to think about about it it just happens you know and we don't even have to say I wonder what will happen with the parking lot we know it's going to be taken care of so we really appreciate the work that they do and we want to acknowledge that especially at times like that and it's always a precarious decision whether to have church or not to have church like today I always ask God why why I want a green light or a red light why is it always yellow and you have to decide do I go through or not go through do I hit the brakes or do I hit the intersection and it's like God you're challenging us all the time I don't I guess he wants us to grow I don't know or depend on him or get out of our own I don't know I really haven't figured out what it is but I know that it's a special trial designed for me because I think about people getting out in traveling and I think about and and I know I know how faithful the body of Christ is to come but I just want to let you know don't ever don't ever come if you're not comfortable coming cuz there's some times that we get on a we get we make a decision and we just we don't know for sure if it's the right decision we just trust God to lead you got a yellow light do you go through or do you stop amen and and and who knows which is the right decision till after you make it but if you ever get in a situation where you just don't feel safe driving or you're in an area that's more impacted by this area or whatever happens don't don't feel bad about staying home just because we're having church amen those who can make it those who are not impacted those can be here will create an atmosphere so we can stream and you can stay home amen and stream so don't ever feel guilty for that don't ever feel bad for missing church I know how faithful you all are and that's actually what gives me such consternation when I make my decision because I know there are some that'll drive in that shouldn't do it I know it but they trust God and say God will take care of me and the way they go and so and I know we've got and the reason I say is we've got more storm Cycles coming and isn't it amazing that the storms always like to hit on Wednesday it's beautiful Saturday night Sunday morning and Wednesday it's great I could be a meteorologist I could say in January and February we're going to have inclement weather on Wednesdays and on Saturdays and Sundays and I my my accuracy would probably be better than the ones who went to school for whatever six years so just a special challenge friends so just remember to pray for us pray for those who have to make the decision I I usually always confer with the deacons and the trust these and try to find out what's going on in all the areas and we do the best that we can but we're just human beings so just remember to pray for us amen pray for us as we make those decisions so we know we got whatever predictions coming up on Wednesday we'll just see what happens and then who knows they say then another weekend storm praise the Lord we're being perfected friends we're being perfected but but nonetheless just just pray and uh I just want to just just uh say that I guess it makes me better feel better to say it you know stay home but I know it won't happen so we'll do what we can to make things as safe as we can amen how many's happy to be here today I'm certainly happy amen I've been tried on every hand I mean EV if I told you you would just laugh everything that could go wrong has gone wrong in every difficult situation has happened amen all the way to my computer locking up just 30 seconds before I come out here and I had to do a hard reboot and I just said Lord praise God you know praise the Lord but it's working now so we'll see what happens so we trust that the Lord has something in store for us because the devil certainly likes to fight and likes to make it hard but he's just a tool in the hand of God for our Perfection and the harder we have to press amen the better the battle amen the greater the victory so we trust that God will have his great Victory today by his word word man when we look at uh the scripture that we read it's so familiar I I think we could preach on it every service not that we will but I think we could because it has so much to do with the revelation of the hour amen it is the word it is the word that was reserved to be unlocked in this hour and we know it has to lay in the Bible and it's been true in every hour we're not saying that it wasn't true in Paul's day it was very much true in Paul's day but the the full impact of that and the full realization of it was going to come to light in this hour that God is he was going to take the veil off of his great mystery is he was going to reveal what's been in the back part of his mind all of this time he would have these things laying down here that Paul would lay in that were true and they've always been true but the impact of their truth and how true they really are amen begin to impact us after the opening of the word amen and in our lives as individuals it Contin to impact us more and more God peels more of that mystery away for us and our own personal revelation amen and I and I know that that will continue I never wanted it to stop in my life I want these scriptures to become more real to me all the time I want them to take on more color I want them to shine brighter and more than that I want them to reflect in me amen and as we go there's many things that I'm going to uh talk about this morning that we've talked about along the way amen but they just start to they start to come in like I said to that clearer Focus that crisper vision of what God is doing in this hour Amen in in in the message the unveiling of God I've got several quotes from the unveiling of God he says now he said now Moses you understand the people understand now I have showed you I have Vindicated you God had veiled himself in his Prophet to speak his word to the people Moses was the Living God to them the Living Word of God made manifest that's the reason his face is veiled he's referring bring back to when Moses would get the word of the Lord and as he would go deliver it his face would shine so bright that the camp of Israel couldn't take it so he would put a veil over his his face and to deliver the word of God Amen and when God was when Moses was in that position having the Living Word of God the word of God for that day and he was the vessel that was going to deliver the word amen remember when God brought them out to the mountain God wanted to deliver the word to him himself amen God wanted to speak to the camp himself and so God you know he set the conditions and he come to the mountain and he told him to prepare themselves and when God began to thunder out amen those Ten Commandments and it was the Thunder of God Amen it frightened him the voice of God frightened him so much instead of running to God they ran away from God and they commissioned Moses Moses you go to God and hear whatever he says and bring it back to us and we'll do whatever he says and and and we know that this was wrong but it was right right it was wrong that they ran from God but it was right right because God was now going to start working through His prophets it fit into his program although it was the wrong action for them to take but now because now they've decided that they want Moses to become amen The Vessel that's to go between now when Moses would go and get that word that God wanted to thunder to them himself now it came into Moses and as Moses was carrying that he became a living God to the people not that not that he was all that God was but he was carrying the very message that God wanted to deliver and he was standing in the place of God and he would come down and he would deliver that message and as he would deliver that message amen it was a message from God and he was the mouthpiece of God okay and so that's why he said Moses was the Living God to them the Living Word of God made manifest that's the reason his faith is veiled see and then this is the next statement this is what really starts to impact you and I he said do you know the same thing in a genuine Christian is veiled today to unbelievers so now he's taking it from Moses and he's starting to bring it down to you and I but he's doing it and he we're going to read the rest of what he says but he does it in ways that's much simpler than we can imagine he said do you know the same thing in a genuine Christian is veiled today to un believers they see them women with long hair and things and look and they say look at that old model women twist their hair up on the back they got a flat tire spare tire up there see it's all veiled they're blind oh they say I got a PhD I don't care what you got you're still ignorant of the word now brother M says now what that was in Moses that he became the Living God he became let me read it again he Moses was the living God to them the Living Word of God made manifest that's the reason his face was veiled and and when we go into the scriptures and we may we may read those later but it begins to talk about how in the Old Testament Moses had to Veil his face because they couldn't stand the glory of the Lord so what was the glory of the Lord they couldn't stand that Moses had went into the presence of the Lord and got the very Living Word the very current present tense message that God wanted to speak to them and now he became the vessel that God was going to use to speak to them and when he had that word and it was going to come out of his mouth and he became the mouthpiece of God that that face glowed so brightly with the glory of God that they couldn't stand to see it because that was going to be the very vessel and method that God was going to bring his Living Word to them and they couldn't handle that Glory because that face was shining with deity yeah with the glory of God because it wasn't Moses Moses was the one who killed an Egyptian Moses was the one who ran away Moses was the one who couldn't do it who argued with God Moses was the one who would eventually make the mistake and and and he would strike the rock twice Mo Moses was Moses and that's why brother B said after Moses delivered his message he was just Moses again and he could remove the veil so it wasn't that Moses I mean it wasn't that Moses himself the flesh body of Moses was deity it was the very it was the very vessel that God was using to bring his own Word of Life to them and that was what made it Glow with the deity of God now he brings that down to you and I and he says that was a natural Veil that Moses had to put onto his face because they couldn't handle the glory but now he says the veil is changed and he says in the New Testament he says now the Veil is on their heart now the veil is on their heart so they can't see what God is doing so even now when he said when they read the law of Moses the veil is on their heart but now he says do you know the same thing in a genuine Christian is veiled today to unbelievers so what same thing then he goes to such a simple example he says they see a woman with long hair and say look at that old model and then they say when it's twisted up on the back of her head look there goes she got a flat tire on her head and they're mocking but what are they mocking they're not mocking The Vessel they're mocking the word it wasn't the vessel listen it's not that Tabernacle of clay that's deity it's not that Tabernacle of clay amen that's the glory of God but it's when that Tabernacle of clay come subjection to the word and starts to manifest the word and long hair amen when they reject that they've rejected God Amen they're blind to the fact that it's not the vessel listen this is what's so hard sometimes for us to separate this is why people fall on one side or the other they either overestimate themselves or underestimate themselves they have trouble with what brother benham's saying or what other people say about the bride because they're looking at the flesh or or they go too far and they make the flesh deity yeah right so we can fall on either side of this problem but it's not it's not that flesh body amen this flesh body is born in corruption it's still in a Corrupted State it's still a cauber nature it's got to be changed one day in the atams it's got to be completely restructured yeah so it's not that but when this body amen puts on the word of God and begins to manifest the word when the word says a amen uh it's a shame for a woman to have short hair and then she puts that on and she realizes that she's not to cut her hair it's a it's a sign of Glory it's a sign of headship amen and she wears that amen that actually is the Living Word it becomes the display of God Amen and the veil now is not on our faces and it's not on our hair and that's not where the veil is the veil is on the heart of the people that can't see that's the Living Word yeah it looks like an oldfashioned and this and it looks like a this but they don't understand that that's actually the word of God made manifest living right before their eyes but the veil is on the heart that can't see it but he says in the scripture but when it is turned to the Lord the veil is taken away then all of a sudden they understand that's God not the human being the human being subject to the word living the word that's God because what is God the word amen the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us what is this it's the word made flesh in My Flesh and in your flesh and that becomes a Living Word of God to the people so it's it's veiled it's veiled because it's in human flesh like any other kind of human flesh amen we can't make our flesh Superior to anybody else's flesh we can't we we can't all of a sudden make this guy and the attributes of the guy somehow better amen to anybody else my My Flesh and my human Spirits no better than than than the the the drug addict on the street we're both born the same way we both come into the life with the same corruption we're both dealing with the same outside man yeah so I can't make this any better than that what's the difference it says when God by his own Spirit takes control and makes the word live in this flesh amen that becomes the Living Word of God that becomes a manifestation of God to the people so sometimes it's so hard for us to separate these things because sometimes we get so contrary thinking because of our flesh don't worry about the flesh amen just focus on Christ his life will bring the sess into subjection and it'll live the life but you then you can say but what about if I make a mistake amen you'll make a mistake it doesn't matter that I mean I can't say it doesn't matter mistakes matter but God has already paid an atoning price to pay for that mistake he's not expecting the flesh to be perfect what he's looking for is a surrendered vessel that he can take control of and begin to manifest himself Moses wasn't perfect but God still manifest himself through Moses after his mistakes before his mistakes in between his mistakes he manifest himself through Moses amen so what we're looking for is the life of God to take control and bring the outer man subject to the life of the word so it becomes a living display of Christ again in unveiling of God he says Moses was The Veil The Living Word of God veiled behind human flesh the pillar of fire was in Moses of course speaking what was to be veiled later behind skins you see amen now that word the word was brought forth then it was written out then it was put behind and still veiled for God was always in that word amen he is the word always he is that word that's the reason that word had to be veiled so it's amazing that the God's word had to be veiled so it was veiled in Moses until Moses delivered it and then when it was delivered it was written down in a book then it was placed in the Tabernacle and the holy of holies behind veils and the Word was always veiled um oh man there's so many things on my heart friends if we would recognize this it would help us so much because the word has always been veiled amen even in the temple in the day that Jesus was hanging on the cross amen that the the word had been veiled back in behind that veil of the Temple but God now took all of that word you know the the the book of ordinances that Moses had wrote it was placed uh it was placed in a little pocket beside the ark it was placed there and then the Ten Commandments that were written out by the Finger of God on those two stones they were placed in the Ark of the Covenant so God's word was back in the ark it was back amen behind the holy of holies amen but when you say God's word was back there really what it was was a representation of his word because his word is living his word is his thought expressed but then it was placed down on two tables of stone and it was placed in the ark and it was written down in a book of ordinances it was placed in a pocket on the side of the Ark so the representation of the word was there you I hope you understand what I'm saying amen we say that this is the word of God and it is the word of God but really what it is is a representation of the word of God because I can put this book in a fire and a house fire and it can burn to bits but the nothing destroyed the word so we say this is the word of God but truly it's a representation of the word of God so what was back behind the ark what was behind the veil was was the word and for years that they had that representation of the word and that was the word and that's where the life of God would come upon the word yeah so when they built the Tabernacle and they placed the word back there the ark was there in the word was there and everything was there then the shakina glory of God would come down and dwell over that Ark and where was he he was wherever the word was his life was with the word amen but then God would take all that word that was written down in the law and in the prophets and everything he would take the fullness of the word and he would put it now in another representation not a not a book written by Moses not two tables of stones but now it was in flesh in Jesus Christ and he was the word made flesh he was the representation of the word of God he was the full expression of that word Made Alive he was God to them he was the he was the Living Word of God manifest yeah amen and it was behind it was God behind a veil what Veil the veil of the flesh body that he designed to be his exact replication in flesh yeah amen so when that they took that word and they nailed it to a cross God Amen would rip the Veil and the temple and tear it all the way down to open the holy of holies Amen to show that there's no life of God anymore in there amen it's not behind the veil but now it's the it's now hanging on the cross now that word and that life is behind that Veil amen and so even though God will open will open the veil even though God would bring a revelation in that day the only way that you could see what's behind the veil is if God takes the veil off your heart same thing's true in this day God has opened the seals he's he's pulled the veil back to show us where he's dwelling and showing where his word is and where shakina glor is and he's done that in this day amen to fully reveal it but the only way that we can see it doesn't matter how how open he opened it he opened it amen did God open the seals did the lamb take the book and open the seals is all Seven Seals open amen they had to be open because it had to come in the days of the seventh angel which was William brand all Seven Seals is the mystery of God finished amen is the is the veil is the mystery that was in the back part of God's mind is it open it is open but you can only see it if the veil's been taken off of your heart because it's open but it's veiled right it's open but it's veiled so now the only thing that can actually tear the veil is a direct Revelation from God himself that's the only thing that can remove the veil so we understand that we'll never tear that Veil Away by instruction no matter how clearly we tried to preach the message and we should preach it as clear as we can I don't think I I personally don't believe in trying to keep it obscure just to keep people guessing I listen trying to explain Supernatural things is obscure enough trying to use the the fallacy of human language which wasn't designed to explain Supernatural the supernatural word our language was only designed to to to reflect the world that we live in yeah right so that's why brother B when he went to the sixth Dimension he says there's not a word in the human language that could describe it why because there's been no word yeah to describe all our words describe things we experience here so he went to another experience and he had no more words so listen re no matter how much we clearly see when God takes the veil out of our hearts and he gives us a revelation amen you got it it's real to you and it's alive the moment you turn to try to explain it you realize it's still veiled yeah amen it's still veiled it's only unveiled by Revelation and that only comes from the father am and and so now the word is always veiled to us it's unveiled because he's taken the veil off of our hearts amen but until the veil comes off the heart it's still veiled amen and where is it's veiled it's veiled in the Christian it's veiled in his bride the mystery is is alive in her the word is in her and the shakina glory of God is in her and it's still veiled to the public amen but it's unveiled to everyone who's had the veil taken off of their heart yeah amen and I want to make a clarifying statement here because when I say things like that sometimes people get a little bit troubled in their mind because they're saying well I can't explain what I believe and and when I go to explain it I get confused and and I try to say what brother bam said or what I heard preached on Sunday and I can't listen that that's nothing that's a human mind trying to take a revelation and put it into a way that's explainable listen that doesn't mean you don't have the Revelation that doesn't mean it's not real to you amen what is it that's jumping up inside down in you when you hear the message when you read the breach when you read the seven seal and something in you is just bubbling over when you hear the preaching of the word and something in you is just saying amen amen amen amen and then you go around and try to explain it and it sounds like you never read the breach and you didn't hear what was preached on Sunday listen don't let the devil deceive you not being able to accurately describe it doesn't mean you don't have the veil removed from your heart amen amen it's a revelation to you personally amen it's not even something that you have to explain to anybody else it's not something that has to make sense to another person in the world Amen it doesn't even have to make sense to your intellectual mind the only thing it has to do is Quicken the life that's down on the inside of you you don't have to even comprehend in your brain what happened to you you have to know something happened on the inside of you amen he says again in unveiling of God he said oh brother sister are you catching it look don't you see it's been veiled through these ages according to what God Said and it'll be opened in the last days those Seven Seals would be broke and the full thing would come into the view of the people that's took place all along the hour of the seventh Angel's message all the mystery of God should be made known in that Elijah this last hour how that Christ is put out of the church the Son of God how he's revealed as son of man again how that the church is to be put in order in everything for the last day no Creed no denomination just absolutely the word living in the individual I'm going to read that again brother B's telling us that he's open it he says according to what God said it'll be opened in the last days amen those Seven Seals would be broke and the full thing would come into view of the people what took place all along amen so that's what God did at Calvary yeah he tore open the seal of the veil to show that he had transferred that word and that life to another vessel and it was in plain view on galtha on Calvary the mystery was unveiled but how many saw it they all saw it but how many saw it it was veiled behind a bloody mutilated victim disfigured and hanging on a cross and counted as a criminal and rejected of everybody and stripped naked and what was it it was the word made manifest it was God unveiled it was the mystery that was in his mind on display for all to see so where was the veil now it was in their heart it was unveiled and now in this day God's unveiled it has he has he opened it is it completely unveiled is it on display how many see it but I I want you to just stay with me on this quote he said it would come into view of the people which took place all along the hour of the seventh Angel's message all the mysteries of God should be made known in that Elijah this last hour how that Christ is put out of his church that's the leodan church age he was on the outside of his church knocking so Christ the holy spirit amen when the word was rejected the life was rejected and he was rejected so he's put out of side of his church but he's revealed as son of man again through a prophetic Ministry through brother Bram how that the church is to be put in order and everything for the last day no Creed no denomination just absolutely the word living in the individual so now what is it now what is this open word what is this unveiling what's it supposed to accomplish the word living in the individual I'll take one and leave one I'll take this and leave that one see there's no strings no denominations no bindings or nothing it's the heart with God and him alone in the breach brother B says watch look at this my broke the seals revealed the Mysteries revealed them where to the last Church age the only one that's living the rest of them sleeping then further in the breach he makes this statement he see he says the seals was broke why in the last Church age to reveal these truths why the lamb broke the seals and revealed them to his church in order to collect his subjects for his kingdom the bride say Oh my he wants to bring his subjects to him now so now now he says at the end time what did he do in the seventh age in the last age amen he broke wide open he tore the veil off he he opened the mystery of his mind amen he put it on display for the people to see amen but remember it's to the individual and what did he do we put it on he opened it up he preached it he displayed it he sent displays of the son of man Ministry all over the world and then he opened the word amen and and he preached it openly and what was he trying to do he wasn't trying to convince the world that the seals were open he wasn't trying to prove anything to anybody he wasn't trying to convince everybody he did that to collect his bride amen he did that he he didn't listen it was it was done in front of the world but it wasn't done for the world it was done openly before the world but it was only done because it was time now to collect his bride first he would collect the living bride who was the seals revealed to the living bride we know there was sleeping bride that had went to sleep in all the previous ages but he come to reveal it to who the living bride they were the only ones present at the time it was revealed in the last age and he did it for what reason to collect his subjects for his kingdom his bride he wants to bring his subjects to him now amen so what was the purpose purp of revealing the seals it was so that God could collect me amen that he could collect me out of denomination and out of confusion and wherever I was he was collecting me to himself and how did he collect me he tore the veil off he opened the mystery amen and not everyone could see it amen but those who could see it were being collected out of wherever they were and they would be gathered to the kingdom and gathered to him amen amen amen amen amen and that's why brother bam says this is not to a group this is to an individual and it doesn't matter how much we want it to be to a group we can't make it to a group I mean it is to a group that group is the elect bride but who they are none of us know you can never go to any group and say now you all are no it's to the individual the individual who's turned to Christ and had the veil removed I want to I want to look at Acts chapter 9 turn there with me if you'll just pray for me I'm a little conflicted about where to turn and when to turn and where to go and what to include but just we trust God it'll lead us step by step as we move forward amen Acts chapter 9 verse one and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high desert a high priest sorry and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound into Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined around about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and he heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecuted thou me and he said who artart thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the bricks and he trembling and astonished said Lord what will thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man here we have the conversion of Saul God is calling Saul now we we know all about Saul he's not been the he's not been the nicest guy he not been the easiest for the church to deal with but Saul is about to get a revelation God's about to open a mystery to him amen God Jesus Christ is just about to unveil himself to Paul yeah and when he does he he smites Paul down and he speaks to him through a pillar of fire and what he sees is a pillar of fire and and God says to him Jesus says to them Paul why persecutest thou me he said who art you L who art thou he said I'm Jesus who you persecute but Saul wasn't persecuting Jesus of Nazareth he was persecuting the church so here God comes down in a pillar of fire and he comes down with a voice of a man that speaks directly to Paul and he calls him by name he says Saul Saul why persecute down me what's he doing he's taking the veil away he's revealing the mystery of who he is and where he is and and Paul is saying who are you I'm Jesus whom you persecute amen and and he goes so far he says Lord what do you want me to do he says you just go to a city to be told you what to do because what's Jesus going to do Jesus is going to come to him in another form that's right because Paul Saul just realized that he was persecuting Jesus in a form what form was Jesus in he was in his body what was his body this is why the Apostle Paul can preach on the Tabernacle the temple the body of Jesus Christ and many members in a body he got a direct Revelation from God himself of what the body of Jesus Christ is that's right praise God it wasn't confusing to him and he could lay it out in the Epistles he knew where the body he saw the pillar of fire but where was that life that life was dwelling in the Christians in that age and when he was persecuting the Christians he was persecuting Jesus Christ and God was going to further enhance that Revelation to him by not telling him in this this this voice from a pillar of fire telling him what to do he said you go to the city and it'll be told you what to do and then God then Christ comes over and he begins to speak to ananas ananas I need you to go because you're my hands yeah amen you're my hands you're my agent on the earth you're my representation I need you to go to saw oh God you know what kind of person he is and this so what does Jesus have to do he has to open a seal to ananas listen ananas you misunderstand that vessel amen that's a chosen vessel unto me to bring my word amen to the Gentiles so Saul misunderstood ananas and all the Brethren but ananas misunderstood Saul so God had to break the veil and then God would come amen Jesus Christ would come through ananas to give Paul the rest of the commission and to lay hands on him so that he could see and then baptized him and then he was healed but we know that there was other people with Saul there was men that were traveling with Saul right and it says at the end of the verse uh that we just read verse 7 said and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man amen they heard something but they didn't see any person if we go over to acts 22 let's just jump over there quickly Acts 22:9 verse n and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me so it's obvious they were present in this great unveiling of Jesus Christ to sa they were there there were other let's just say there were other ones in church that morning and they saw the yeah and they heard a voice which can just mean sound amen but they didn't see any man but they saw a light and they heard a noise they heard a sound and then Paul later says they saw the light but they didn't hear the voice of him that spoke to me amen listen I I remember listening to the message M amen and when when I would be be listening to the message my my God was speaking to me and I would give that same tape that made me come alive to a friend or associate and I listened to them you know what they heard they heard a noise yeah right but they didn't hear the voice of him that spoke to me amen they could have been in church that day they could have been in the meeting amen they could have seen the pillar of fire move over the prophet am mean they could have seen the manifestations of the son of man on the platform and they could have seen the telling of your history and the raising of the dead and opening of the blind eyes amen no matter how many men were there at the opening of the word amen they didn't hear the voice that spoke to me because he came to unveil himself to his bride as individuals so he came and preached it openly but privately and and friends I can understand how frustrating this could be to somebody who could hear the noise but not the voice that spoke to Paul I I don't know what to do about it and I don't know how to fix it Paul couldn't fix it amen they saw a light I mean they were there for the impact of this meeting and they saw the bright light they heard something but they didn't hear what Paul heard amen amen it's why sometimes you could walk out of the same service and you heard two different messages and there's no way to fix that it's going to take God to fix that many times I think you know if I could just explain it more clearly if I wasn't so limited or if I didn't get confused or I didn't leave that part out listen you don't know what consternation we go through afterwards when you think what what I forgot to mention that and I didn't tie those two points together and I left it in confusion oh God forgive me I messed up everything but who's to say we messed up everything who's to say God still didn't speak to who he's supposed to speak to amen all men heard something and all men saw something but only one got the message amen so Paul he goes on let's let's just turn to Galatians chapter 1 Galatians chap 1 verse 15 Paul says but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's wom and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the Heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood the Apostle Paul is saying when God determined that it was time that he would unveil the mystery of my life yeah what was what was it he was going to unveil to Paul he says when it I'm going to go back and read again in verse 15 when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's wound and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me amen what did he call Paul for to reveal his son in him he was called to reveal Jesus Christ to the people amen and he did that amen amen and when he did that when he was called to reveal the son he couldn't confer with man he couldn't go get it from anybody he had to go buy himself into Arabia and he had to count everything he learned as dong and relearn from Christ himself what the message was amen because it's it's not going to be it's not going to be conferring with man amen that's going to produce that although God can use man like he used ananas like he used Paul to preach it to all the Gentiles God can use man but it's not conferring with man that'll do anything when it's time for Christ to reveal himself in you amen then you have to get alone with Christ and Christ has to teach you the messag amen and it may not be the backside of the desert in Arabia for you amen it may feel like the backside of the desert when God separates you from everything you ever knew amen you feel isolated from every friend you ever had amen but really and God can be using the mouthpiece of a man from a pull pit that's not what we're talking about but it's got to be Christ revealing the message to you like he did Paul because what was the purpose of him calling Paul to reveal the son in him so that he would be revealing Jesus Christ to the world Amen and then the Apostle Paul would pick this understanding up and this is where uh we've talked about it so many times but when brother Brandon would come to Christ is the mystery of God revealed his opening scriptures context would be Colossians chapter 1 most of the chapter and but he would highlight this verse Christ in you the hope of glory because Paul realized why he was called to reveal Christ then he realized what what the great purpose was that's why he says I'm travailing in birth again till Christ be formed in you and it's Christ in you the hope of glory to the individual in an unveiling of God again brother R says now then when when we become part of him as you are the Veil that veils him you are part of him as long as Christ is in you as Christ was of God because God was in him made him God and as Christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of Christ he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also you become part of Christ as long as Christ is hid in you then it's a veil to the unbeliever but you know he's in you here's the next sentence you are templ Christ that's behind the veil the skin so what do you become the Temple of Christ is that what Paul teaches us he says then behind because of this Veil The Veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever where is Christ if you've been born again by the spirit of God Christ is in you you're templ in Christ but he's veiled to the unbelievers because of your flesh because your flesh is just like their flesh our flesh is like anybody else's flesh but it's behind the veil remember when when it was time for the for them to take the word that came from moses' mouth and they wrote In the book and was time to put it behind the veil they build a tabernacle and the Tabernacle in the wilderness is representative of Jesus Christ it's representative of a person and it has many ways it's representative of us because there's three parts the outer Court the inner Court the holy of holies and we have our body and our spirit in our soul but when it come time to put it back behind that Veil behind that Temple amen they had to go gather material and they gather this material they grabbed material that was like other material they took they took took Ram skins died red they took wool and wo it together amen and there was a selection of wool they took from some sheep and not from others amen they took skin from some Rams but not all the Rams yeah you understand what I'm saying they they they there was a selection of where the veil was going to be amen so the wool that was selected to be woven together to become the tapestry amen that would separate the holy place from the holy of holies amen that wool didn't select itself somebody else selected it and it was wool like any other wool that come off any other sheep it wasn't special wool it wasn't selected because it was nicer wool and wider wool and and com from nicer Lambs we like these sheep better yeah it was just selected amen but as it was selected it became the veil yeah it became the veil amen that was veiling what that was veiling the word and the life of the word was behind behind that Veil and it was a veil between the people amen and God and God was living behind the veil God was there God was present and God was manifesting out from behind the veil but it doesn't do any good for the veil to get proud about being the veil right how did you become the veil listen I don't know one day I'm on the back of a sheep next day somebody wrestles that sheep to the ground and listen the process wasn't pleasant I mean shears and separation and all of a sudden I thrown in a bag with other wool and I have no idea what's going on and then they took me out and they did all kinds of things to me I was stretched out and changed in form and changed in color and all this stuff and next thing I know I'm woven together and then I'm hung up here that's what we are friends that's what this guy is amen just the veil we can't take pride in the veil but the Veil The Veil could see both sides amen amen the veil could see outside and the veil could see inside amen and we can't help that we can see outside and we can see inside amen and then know that the veil is hiding the shikina glory of God brother B makes this statement that I'd just like to read to you out of Christ as the mystery of God revealed says now notice god making himself known not we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by a government but by the Revelation the Christ in you right because Paul realized he was going to reveal his son in me Christ in you as God was in Christ as God was in Christ Christ in you when what God did in Christ Christ does in you what signs did God in Christ Christ does in you do you know what happened to Brock's cousin Abby she came in contact with a veil that was hiding Christ and listen the oh praise be to God Amen I I met her on Sunday and I talked to her on Sunday and I and I uh was just saying something about um you know about Brock we love Brock and I don't know the Brock you knew what he was like before but we sure love him now or something like that and she goes oh no oh no you don't know I know him he's completely changed I said maybe I'd like to talk to you after service and have a little interview and Brock was the same flesh the same characteristics even much of the same temperament but there was a different life on the end inside amen she recognized that he had become a veil and what was behind him was shakina Glory life and we don't make converts to Christ amen by sending out of track we make converts to Christ by The Life of Christ in us not by governments not by setting up an order not by bringing people into a form or order or ritual or a church structure that's never going to do it but what's going to happen is the same thing that happened to those that saw Paul coming along and Paul had Christ his son was being revealed in Paul yeah Paul was the veil and he had the mystery and he was letting it out and they saw whatever they saw in Paul brother benam said he was a stoop shouldered Hook New nose Jew but he had come in contact with the pillar of fire and now the sun was be revealing being revealed in him the veil was still the veil amen but the life on the inside had completely changed he was templ in Christ the same thing happened to Abby when she come in contact she told me she goes after talking to him she goes uh he was on fire and I got on fire and I had to come and see this church this place he goes that helped him change we don't make converts to Christianity by government amen but by Christ in you we are the veil amen and and God can God can allows the veil to come off somebody else's heart so that they can see what's behind the veil because what's behind the veil the word and the life of the word brother BR says in desperation the token is the token it's you and Christ as persons together I want read that again because it's such a it's such a strange statement the token is the token well okay it's you and Christ as persons together where is Christ he's a person with you together with you United with you veiled in you it's the Holy Spirit his life in you working his own life through you what is the token we know the token the token is the fullness of the Holy Ghost coming back in his church the token is the life of Jesus Christ in his his people that's the token and it comes to individuals it's not Collective it's individual his token is in you what is the token the token is the representation of his life or it's his life which is the representation of his blood of his death his token is his life and what is the token it's you and Christ as persons together now you're templ in Christ you are the veil that hides him and God hiding himself in Simplicity says and you know what they thought about him what school did he come from what denomination is he with is he with the Pharisees or Sadducees or what more they had and he's speaking here of Elijah the prophet he didn't belong to any of them but he condemned the whole thing see God chose to do that but a simple man no education we have no place where he ever went to school we have nothing we know we have nothing about about him just a simple man but God was pleased to hide in that simple person God back there with this simple man hiding in a human being can you grasp it brother R is explaining Elijah and Elijah Ministry for a reason because he's trying to get us to see in this generation the parallel that Elijah had come back and brother said there's no record of Elijah no record of what school he came from or where he came from he was just Elijah the tishbite nobody even to this day really understands what that means but he but God was hiding brother said God was hiding in that humble man that simple man amen and we saw God hiding in another man in our generation and that was the other Elijah Ministry and William brandham God was hiding in that simple man amen and the man was the veil but what was behind the veil was God he was templ in Christ God was being revealed in him did it make brother Brenham perfect perfect in every way absolutely not don't forget the one who was templ Christ was still able to lie to a lawyer right amen amen so you know for me that's such a blessing because it's a hard thing to say that behind me behind this Tabernacle amen is Christ that I've come in contact with the Living God I I came in contact with the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire woke me up to who I was and taught me the message and now I'm I'm templ in Christ you know what makes that hard to say it's hard to say because we know what all this guy goes through but I don't doubt it a bit and brother brandham and the fact that he went and lied to a lawyer amen listen you say but but you know the Holy Ghost corrected him he went back and made that right but could you imagine if you were standing there the day you saw it happen not knowing that God was going to cause him to make it right and listen brother benam he didn't make it right just because he decided to make it right he made it right because when he went to lay hands on a baby that was sick God spoke to him and said how can you being a liar lay your hands on that baby it wasn't the goodness of the human person it was the goodness of God Amen it was the character of God Amen and it was a man who could surrender to the voice of God it wasn't the Perfection of the veil the veil was a veil it was flesh like any other flesh it was prone to corruption it was prone to error like any other body of Flesh brother Brenham said amen he said listen if you're looking for something to criticize you'll find it there's plenty to criticize and if you're looking for fail don't look at me he goes I'm a failure he said I make mistakes every day he goes I backslide all the time I don't remember the the numbers he put to it but he was still the veil he was still templ in Christ it was still Christ behind that Veil oh I thank God listen we make a pile of mistakes we'll make a pile more mistakes but it's the goodness of God that tells us we're wrong because why he wants to manifest himself through usen I think it's amazing that God can be so powerful and so perfect he can use such a horrible Veil yeah I think it's amazing that he is so powerful his light is so bright and he's so perfect in every way that he can wrap himself in one of the most horrible veils ever and still manifest his life it's not the quality of the veil it's the quality of the life Behind the Veil oh praise God don't always know what to say or how to say it but I just know God I know beyond a shadow of a doubt what God's program is for this hour because he's revealed it in the message I don't fully comprehend obviously there's a million details we don't know but we know for sure that God wants to live in his people and he wants to be manifest and seen in his people people yeah and I believe by a revelation not by conduct not by temperament not by Good Deeds but I believe by Revelation I'm one of those people and I look at my veil sometimes and I think how God but I didn't pick me he picked me neither can I perfect me only he can all I can do is the best I can to stay surrendered and even that I can't do really good it takes his life in me to accomplish it brother brand says I'm just going to quote not not brother B but out of Mark 16 in the resurrection of Jesus Christ when Jesus was first be made manifest it was first to Mary Magdalene she's the first one that will come in contact with the resurrected Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene knew Jesus she'd followed him from City to City serving him she was one of the women that were serving him and cooking food and taking care of him and she knew him quite well but when Christ first represented himself to Mary Magdalene he was in the form of a gardener and she assumed he was the gardener he had taken on another Veil she didn't recognize him and the the veil that he took on what the veil was hiding from her eyes who it was from her human eyes she didn't know that it was Jesus Christ standing there talking to her and she's saying sir show me where he is show me where they've laid his body so that I can go and fetch him she's looking for Jesus Christ and she's talking to Jesus Christ and she's asking Jesus Christ to show her where the body of Jesus Christ is I don't know if any of those scriptures ever Marvel you but they Marvel me what what was blinding her to the life that was before her it was the veil but then he spoke and he called her by nameen and he said Mary and when he called her name listen brother bam we we've been through this many times but brother bam talks about when he called your name and revealing the Mysteries is calling the name amen and when God's revealing himself and revealing this mystery he's calling your name he's not saying Chad and Bob and Ted and it's not that's not what he's saying what he's what he's doing what what was it to call Mary's name that was an identification he was identifying her that he knew her and the way he knew her and understood who she was and the way he called her name she knew in the way that he called her name she knew that was the Lord she turned around and said Rabon teacher amen and she fell at his feet amen listen God Has Come to Us in the form amen he's come into the form of his word he's come through the form of a prophet and many times he's come to us in a form of another human being that was witnessing to us about the message amen and we didn't recognize who was talking to us we didn't recognize the life behind the veil amen but all of a sudden the life behind the veil that knew us before the foundation of the world would call us with a true identification with who we really were and we knew when he called that name not Chad that's not the name amen the name is who he called who I was in his mind before the foundation of the world and when he called me with that identification something in me said that's Christ it's more than the veil that I see and listen supposing that he was a gardener and then he left her sight amen and listen what happened to that Veil what happened to The Gardener oh my goodness I have a pile of questions to ask when I get to heaven if if we have this kind of mind and we ask questions we may not ask anything I don't know but I got a pile of questions next we find him on the road to a mass and and the market says he appeared to two others in another form yeah right in another form what behind another Veil it was the resurrected Jesus Christ his resurrected life amen fulfilling the word and he come to them but their eyes were beholden that they couldn't know him yeah and they knew him they talked to him they loved him they spent time with him but they didn't know who it was that they were walking with because he presented himself to them behind a different Veil than what they were used to yeah amen and then he talks to them along the way and they confessed later that their hearts were burning and he opened to them the scriptures didn't our hearts burn within us as he took to us along the way opening unto us the scriptures and they don't know that this is the Lord whom they're mourning they don't know this is the one that they think they're separated from and he's no more separated than from them than than he's right there and there he goes why are you downcast why are you so sad what's wrong with you I'm right here yeah what is it you're mourning about what is this you're talking about along the way don't you know what's happened a prophet and mighty indeed and whoa whoa whoa listen we're going through the same thing now God where are you he's all around us friends he's here he's behind other veils he's here behind that Veil and then you know that they have the dialogue and they bite him in and then he goes and he does something before them that would be an identification he breaks the bread in a certain way brother said he had done something like he had done it before then it said their eyes were open and they saw him they knew it was the Lord I have a pile of questions there too did the form change or did their understanding change did the facial structures all of a sudden rearrange in that vessel he was using or did they actually catch a revelation of who this is I don't know the answer to that but either one's amazing either one is certainly amazing and then he vanished from their sight he vanished from their sight so what happened to that form yeah this is always my question what happened to that form then next we find them all hidden in a room together the doors being fastened next thing you know he's standing there in their midst only this time he's in another form again he's back in the form they last saw him in yeah with the nail scarred hands the the body they were accustomed to he came to them in the in the way that they knew him Amen in the image that they knew him and they came to him behind closed doors and he revealed himself to them he said it is I come and touch my hands and thrust thy hand in my side and we know what happened to Thomas and we know he got a revelation he said my my Lord and my God and this was a private revelation of Jesus Christ himself not now in another form but he himself comes behind closed doors and reveals himself to them personally in his fullness that they understood at that time and so we we look at we look at this and we we realize that in other form in another form he opened to them the scriptures but now behind closed doors in private he comes to them and says it's me and then he opens their understanding to understand the scriptures listen God has used many forms forms of preachers and forms of friends to open to us the scriptures but the only one that can open our understanding to understand those scriptures is when he meets you behind the closed walls of your house when he shows up and says it's me see my my nails Prince see my hands see my side this is me and in that private meeting with Christ behind your Veil and your holy of holies when he says it's me he may use another form to open the scriptures but when he opens your understanding to understand the scriptures it's when he comes into your house and says it's me he goes on and Miss Christ's the mystery of God revealed he says now look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do what is the new birth then you say well brother bam what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ Christ personally to you not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you set a Creed you promis to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon it's when Christ not in another form in another form he may open to you the scriptures but when he comes into your form he opens your understanding he gives you a revelation this is him this is him and it's him in me and the rising of the sun he says in him we become part of him the Easter the re the revealed Secret Of God like it was then of life after death we are now now alive who were once dead in sin and trespasses the true Easter seal has broke death from around me and I'm alive the Easter seal at the beginning broke the Seal of the Roman seal the Easter seal that he was sealed up and man when they died was gone but he broke that seal and revealed the secret and now God by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and Christ is revealed as he lives in us for we are quickened with him what is the great revelation of this day Christ in you the hope of glory amen and you become the veil you're templ him behind your flesh and it doesn't have to become special flesh that's right it can be just plain old flesh it doesn't have to become perfect flesh it can still be flawed flesh because that's not what we're looking at we're looking at the life that's behind the veil we're looking at the word that's laying there with the shakina glory of God there to make it live that's the reality that's where the temple of God is amen let's turn to 1 Corinthians 13 1 Corinthians 13 1 Corinthians 13:10 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known he says when that which is perfect is come and brother benam says in what we do have today is the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication he says we look into a glass Darkly that means a mirror Darkly we've been looking into the word amen and it's been a bit obscure but at the opening of the seals he was going to take the obscurity away from the scriptures he was going to I I say it this way he was going to clean the glass amen by the message of the hour he was going to take what was jumbled up and what was obscure and he was going to clean it all back and bring it back to the original the original status that it was originally given in and this word was intended to be a mirror but through denominationalism man's ideas all kinds of clutter got attached to it it got laid up in an attic it got dust all over it had smears and fingerprints and everything else and you would look at it and you could never see clearly what you were looking at but at the opening of the seals in this message he came and he and He restored the mirror back to what it was supposed to be he says for now we see through a Darkly but then when when the perfect interpretation of the word has been come back to us been revealed but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known God always knew about me God always knew about me the question wasn't in God's mind the question was in my mind God God always knew what he would do with me God always knew who I was amen God always knew that I would become part of that Temple he always knew he would use my veil if I'm a Child of God he always knew he would use my veil to manifest himself I didn't know it amen but he came and He restored the word so that I wasn't looking at a dirty mirror anymore so that I was looking at the word correctly and when I looked at the correctly I found out it was me it was me he wants to use I can say he used Paul he used Paul look at what he did in the first church age look what he did in the Corinthians look what he did in Peter praise God I saw that look what he did in brother brandham that was beautiful too but he wanted me to catch a higher Revelation that what he did in Paul he wants to do in me what he did in brother brandom he wants to do in me he used the veil to Temple himself to live his life behind the veil he wants to do the same thing in you and I and when the message came to clear that mirror we could get a reflection it wasn't just Paul he wanted to use it wasn't only Paul that would reveal the sun he wants to use me to reveal this sign he's got a body and he's got members of that body and he wants me to be one of those members and then when we're turn to the Lord the veil is taken off of our heart and we could see yes Christ man I have just one more thought that I've been meditating on that I want to share as we wind down and close brother vom in questions and answers on the seals in 1963 it's a Sunday morning right between the Sixth Seal and the seventh seal he does questions and answers and he gets this question said brother brandham if this question is not fit does not fit don't answer brother said that's nice I appreciate that he said what children what children go in the Rapture if any small ones thank you so the question is what happens at the Rapture time with little children or babies obviously they've not been converted yet would you agree not not prayed a sinner's prayer not repented of anything and he says he said look when God puts a name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world there's not nothing in the world can rub it out because it's wrote with the ink of the blood of Christ be it this big that big that big or whatever it might be it it goes just the same remember when uh several weeks ago brother Stan price was here and he made the statement he says he used he referred to the quote he says in the quote where brother B says you was never saved on any certain day you were always saved how can I say I was always saved because you were in the Lamb's Book of Life if you were saved you were in the Lamb's Book of Life so when were when were you saved I mean I know it comes down to technicalities we have an experience here and that experience is for our understanding and our growth and for a manifestation of the word so there's a manifestation of that but the reality of it if I could say it this way the reality is not the drama that's being played the reality is what played out in God's mind the reality is in the Lamb's Book of Life the reality we're just we're just reflecting that reality he said this is the negative that is the positive amen so he says you was never saved on any certain day you were always saved and now they ask about babies what happens to young children in the Rapture will any of them go because they didn't say a prayer they didn't confess you as Lord they didn't get converted amen but at the rapture amen it doesn't matter everybody that's in the Lamb's Book of Life amen all that's part of the elect predestinated seed will go in the Rapture all those who were old enough to come to repentance would right but those who are not old enough Amen to even speak they're going to go anyways God but this is the statement that began I began to look at when he made this statement he says uh he said God puts a name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation world there's not nothing in the world can rub it out because it's wrote with the ink of the blood of Christ amen I began to look at that and I know how brother brandham speaking like I know he's speaking symbolically but I began to look at that and said those names were sealed under the blood of the Lamb they were written in the ink of the blood of the Lamb is that what the prophet tells us but that blood wasn't shed until ad. 33 so how did he get that blood to write names in a book now we realize we we've been taught this we realize that the Book of Revelation is a book of symbols that God is using symbols to teach us truth the truths are greater than the symbols I hope you don't think I'm sacriligious for saying that but the truth is beyond the symbol because the truth is the reality the symbol is a reflection of that reality for understanding so he's saying a book like like there may be a book there may not be a book I I don't know like you have to ask questions like what paper does he have what ink did he write did he write with a quill did he write with his finger like when brother bam saw the vision amen of when he was criticizing the woman in the vision of the blood of Jesus Christ around the earth and his sins hitting that amen he saw his wrap sheet he saw all his transgressions and he saw Jesus dip his finger in his side and write pardoned on on his sheet well God was showing him symbolically what had happened did God ever really write pardoned on a sheet a list of offenses that he had right I don't know maybe he did when did he write it if he ever wrote it he wrote it before the foundation of the world which means he already had a list of your offenses I don't know the answer to these questions all I know is the truth is beyond the symbols and the truth is he wrote your name in the indelible inerasable perfect ink of the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of the lamb but yet there was no physical blood yet to write that name that's why so there there's a there's a message that becomes so vital brother B said he could not preach the token till after the seals yeah because he begins to show us the reality there's a greater reality to everything and he says the blood represents the life he said that blood that Jesus shed ran down the cross and Spilled into the Judean soil and he said it turned back into the elements of the food and the things that he ate right now that's that's what brother brandom said amen and I don't mean to make that Sac religious that's the most precious blood that's ever touched the Earth and that blood was an exchange rate price it was an exchange of money his blood for my sins yeah and that was real blood and that was that was human blood that was created by God so it was the blood of God Amen but that blood was not the blood that he wrote my name in the Lamb's Book of Life with that blood represented the blood just stay with me for a minute amen the blood that I receive today is not that blood because he said that chem he said that blood was a chemistry and that chemistry went back into the soil he said but what I receive was the life of that blood so when I receive the life of that blood amen I receive the effect of the blood and the effect of the blood is my Redemption so that's why the life becomes the token the token is if you go to the bus brother B says and you don't go give the bus driver money because they don't want the bus driver robbed they don't want him to have a big bile of money so you go to a shed amen where they're locked behind iron bar bars you give them the money they drop it in their safe they give you a token the token represents the money but it's not the money righten so what we receive today is a token it's not the physical blood but it represents the physical blood the physical blood ran back into the Earth to redeem all of creation but the token I get was the life of that blood the life that created the blood the life that was living through the blood the life that continues on today that life is what we receive so what blood did he write my name in the Lamb's Book of Life with oh my goodness you know how sometimes brother BR says put your spiritual jackets on we got to look Beyond physical and see the spiritual reality behind it so keep that question in your mind what blood did he write my name and what name did he write does it say Chad Lamb it's a good question like I said I got piles of questions and I don't have all the answers but I realize some of my questions are carnal because of limited understanding I'm fixating on the symbol and I've missed the truth that's beyond the S and questions and answers on the seals again a little bit later he says now Jesus was slain about ad30 is that right it was about the middle of the year I guess ad30 now but the Bible said that he was slain before the world was ever created and your name when the Lamb's Book when the lamb was slain to redeem this book here's a great thing now I might call stimulation look when the lamb now remember the Bible said the Lamb's Book of Life was written before the foundation of the world and your name was put in it was in that book when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world to redeem every name that was written in the book you got it now so when was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world but he was slain ad30 says because this is a reflection of that this on Earth is a manifestation of what's already taken place in the mind of God and so then I ask you which one is more real the one in heaven the Eternal God's thoughts this is a reflection of that and this is a manifestation of that but the more real is the original so he was slain before the foundation of the world to redeem every name that was written in that book see there ain't nothing out of order it's working just exactly like God's Big Time piece like a clock moving right around your name was put in there before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain to redeem what was in the book and now he comes forward and takes the book to claim his Redemption so let's go to Revelation 138 there's a more I'd like to say on this but I just want to touch this thought in context of what we're talking about Revelation 13:8 it says and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world I love this wording CU many times we call it the Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life but I love the terminology here in the Book of Life of the lamb and and we realize Ephesians 1 tells us that God has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world Amen so we were chose in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love so God chose us in Christ Jesus before the foundation of the world and that's the same time he wrote our name in The Book of Life and he wrote it with the ink of the blood of Jesus Christ and it's all been sealed behind Seven Seals so it's unchangeable in the end times is going to reveal at the opening seal is going to reveal the fact that it's been unchangeable all this time that's why it's been a sealed book that's open at the end can't be tampered with this has been God's decision from before the foundation of the world he's not making new decisions amen so so now we come to this book now and brother Brandon makes this statement in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says now you see the seals when he was in his mediat tural work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and and all that's in his book would be him everything in the book is him but I thought my name was in that book and all that's in his book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him amen it's the Book of Life of the Lamb or the Lamb's Book of Life it's the book of the Lamb's life amen so what kind of ink is my name written in in the Lamb's Book of Life what kind of pen did he use how did he get the ink what kind of style did he write it in what language was it written and how big is it written how small is it written how big is the book the book is him amen that's right and everything in the book is him amen and the Believers in the book is the words in the book is him because he is the word amen and the believer is part of the word and they are the words that are in the book and brother Benham called This Book of redemption the Bible and he says you were in the Bible before the Bible was written so the Bible and the Lamb's Book of Life are the same thing the Bible and the Book of redemption are the same thing the Bible and your marriage certificate are the same thing the Bible and the record of the life of the Lamb are the same thing what ink were your name written in and what name was written in there it's his own life that he's sharing with you that's what's in the Lamb's Book of Life it's his life it's the record of him his life as he was going to bring it in manifestation upon the Earth through all the generations and collect it all up at the end day unite himself to his bride which is him male and female him to come back together to unite the book back together and return Christ to the Earth to rule what ink did you write your name in his blood what blood his life so what are are you yes part of his life if your name is written with the indelible ink of his blood that can never be rubbed out right amen that then your name is part of him you're part of his life not this but that seed Gene of God on the inside was an attribute of God that was is part of God's word that wants to be manifest what is Christ the anointed word God's word that he anointed to live in a certain day that's Christ that's why brother B said it was Christ in Noah it was Christ in Moses what was it you remember that was Christ and Moses before the New Birth yeah right amen remember he had to shed his blood to sanctify so that he could live in us before it was God above us then God With Us now it's God in us and that could only come after Calvary he could only live in man after Calvary so what was it Christ and Moses it was a seed or part of God's life that was in Moses it was the word that was in Moses that was living and when that word in Moses lived that was Christ amen what is it that's living in you what is it that what is what is the Holy Ghost come to Quicken you it's come to Quicken his own life that's already in you and how does he Quicken his life by bringing his life to Quicken his life because what's behind what's behind the veil amen the shakina glory of God Amen the very life of God comes and rest upon the word and brings the word into manifestation cuz what's in the inner chamber it's the word it's in the ark which is what his throne his place of rest is inside the believer in the holy of holies and there abides the word the Covenant the promise the Eternal promise of God from before the foundation of the world one of those words that was written in the Lamb's Book of Life is In The Ark in your heart in his resting place and he brings his shakina glory behind your Veil to make that portion of the word live amen and that's why your flesh that was born wrong will always be wrong that's condemned and must be made over that's why it's the veil yeah amen because behind the veil his word which you're a part of because the believer is the words in the book what words my name and it may not be Chad lam it might just be the portion of Christ's life that I'm supposed to represent on this Earth that's my name cuz that's my what's your name it's your identification amen what is my identification my identification is Mrs Jesus Jesus Christ I've took on his identification so he's in me and there's a part of him in me that has to live in this day maybe that's my name on the book my identification what I'm supposed to represent on this Earth and where is it behind the veil written with what kind of ink his own life it can't change it's him am that's why I receive the token listen if that name was written in the ink of his blood before the foundation of the world that's his life his life was come and made flesh so that that blood could spill to pay the price of redemption for creation it had to become a part of creation to redeem creation but that physical blood was a chemistry but that chemistry was reflecting a life the life is the reality the life is the I say the higher reality and that was part of that life that wrote my name in that book what is that that's being expressed Today part of that life that was on that book that's why a baby in the Rapture is going to go in the Rapture if it's part of the Life of Christ what's been drawing us what's been converting us what's been changing us it's his own life he's coming to seek his own when Jesus came and and and and his coming in his body the the prophet from Nazareth he says I came to seek and to save that which was lost I came not to mind the world but I came to mind that were in the world what has he been seeking he's been seeking those names in that book amen why because that's himself amen he was looking for himself to bring his life into manifestation praise God Amen when when Philip asked him said Lord show us the father Jesus said have I been so long with you that you don't know me Phillip when you've seen me you've seen the father he says cuz it's not me that is doing the works it's the father in me he's doing the works amen listen friends we're supposed to be manifesting Christ on the earth so that when people see us they see Christ not this not the veil but the life behind the veil because it's not us that lives the word it's him in us that lives the word it's not us that's overcoming it's him in us that's overcoming it's not us displaying our own life it's him displaying his life through us it wasn't Paul it was Christ revealed in Paul it's not you and I it's that name that was on the book being made manifest today through this veil of Flesh and I can't I can't make the veil any more spectacular than it's ever been but it's the life Behind the Veil am listen when God would ever choose a veil God would use temporary products to hide eternal life yeah amen is that right God would take wool and RAM skins and porpus skins and Badger skins whatever it was and he would take these and listen as it sat out in the elements it began to weather that Tabernacle that was God's Dwelling Place it got old yeah right it got in disrepair it got shabby you say it sounds horrible to say that but God let it get shabby yeah he let the UV light begin to destroy it he let the elements begin to tear it he let it begin to fade over time he let it get weaker and he let it until till David pitched a new tent did he yes until Solomon come along and says now we're going to have to build a temple and then I always ask when David built his Tabernacle what happened to the Tabernacle Moses built where is it wouldn't you love to have a piece of the fabric off of it as a prayer cloth I'd want a piece of that Veil or the inner lining over where the cherubims are if I could get a little piece of that I would carry in my pocket every day of my life but where is it now why cuz it was just a veil the importance wasn't The Veil The Importance was the life behind the veil it would weather it would get old it it get tears in it it had to be repaired and stitched back together and then when it was too old to use they had to get another one and then when that one no no longer was suitable amen then they got another one yeah but what what did God let happen to Solomon's Temple God allowed Invaders God allowed Babylonians to come in and ransack it destroy it tear all the pieces apart and burn it with fire yeah right how could God do that because the importance was not the Tabernacle the importance was the life inside the Tabernacle and when the life left that Tabernacle he had no more use for the Tabernacle it wasn't the Tabernacle it was the life in the Tabernacle that's why we put so much importance on this flesh and certainly God won't let us get sick God won't let me weather God won't let me sit out under a UV light and get weak he won't let my garment get tattered he won't let me get old he won't let me die go read the Bible because it's not about the Tabernacle it's about the life inside this guy gets old gets weak can be torn in a storm amen but it doesn't change what's behind the veil it can need repaired it could get it could get in disorder through a storm and and it may need to be straightened out again the curtains may need to be straight and pulled back down and every that's life friends that's just life but it's not about the Veil The Veil is hiding the shikina glory of God we may have to fix the veil over and over and over again it may need renewed all the time it may need maintenance and I'm not just talking about getting old that happens too but things happen in life that rack the outside but it doesn't change who's on the throne amen it doesn't change that the light and the word have come together to manifest what's behind the veil I say oh God let your life remain behind my veil it's not the best Veil it's not the best wool it's not the best Ram skin it's not the best B your skin but it's the one he chose you can look at yourself and say I don't know why he chose me I hear people say that all the time I don't know why he chose me well I don't know either I mean I'm sure not I sure don't know why he chose you either like I'm scratching my head too but he decided which one would be part of this Tabernacle he's the one who picked up the stone and said that fits in my Tabernacle I'll start shaping it it yeah amen we didn't get to decide I don't know why he picked me sometimes we feel like an odd-shaped Stone why did he pick me cuz sometimes only an odd-shaped Stone will fit we got to quit worrying about those things those are the temporal things and they will fade away and God has a purpose in it all ups and downs and back and forth and storms and weathers and tears and rips and and and all kinds of things it'll come and go friends amen but what matters the most is the life that was in that Lamb's Book of Life yeah that name is in you amen and his life is come to Quicken that life into manifestation cuz brother brandham said that name that was written on the book is part of the word and you were on the Bible before the Bible came into print I've read this Bible through I don't know how many times I've never read Chad Lamb I read lamb a lot that always makes me feel good unless they're killing the lamb but yet I'm in here my name is in this Bible because my identity who I am is in this Bible and what I'm supposed to do in the end time is in this Bible so I and part of this word amen right and I didn't pick it he did when he wrote my name on the Lamb's Book of Life I'm so glad that I'm there and I'm so glad that he's here we couldn't do anything to produce anything in our lives it takes him coming the word found the word the word predestinated found the word for the day and the two came together and brought the manifestation of Christ out of our hearts and I say thank God the veil has been taken away from us and we become the veil that hides him from The World God bless you Saints let's all Stand Together musicians if you'll come brother Blake if you'll come just so many things on my heart friends these things there's nothing that we said today that was new but why is it it's always more exciting am because it's the reality it's the reality of the reality so much of life is just life carnal things that will fade away but there's a depth of reality that's inside of us and it's the most exciting thing in the world it's from out of this world when you realize that that that se gen it's in you that's part of the life of God that's part of the word that's part of Christ amen and when it was quick in life it was always there what is in you now is the same thing that's in the Lamb's Book of Life it's not like that name written there is something different than what you are here the real you on the inside behind the veil that you dwell in is whatever was written in that book yeah amen that's why when the lamb took the book it Thrills us yeah amen what makes us so excited even when brother brandom says and the lamb has to take the book and open the seils and we're all like yes amen what does it mean it's not that he's walking around with the book well I mean that's not the exciting part the exciting part is I don't know how I don't know how it come into me to know this but I know when the lamb takes the book it has something to do with me I don't know it here but when I hear brother brandham say it in the breach I know it down here when when the people are shouting I'm shouting when I look at John when John sees the lamb step forward when no man was worthy to take the book and he hears that the lion of the tribe of Judah has overcome and prevailed to take the book and he looks and he sees a bloody lamb and the Bloody lamb takes the book and when the bloody lamb takes the book and everybody falls down on their face and then John says and everything in heaven and everything on Earth and everything under the Earth heard I John shouting praises and glory and Hallelujah why because John knew he's in the book brother bam said he must have looked over and saw his name in the book how did he see his name in the book it was still sealed amen I don't know how he saw it with carnal natural eyes but something in John knew he was part of that book and if no man took the book all was lost amen what was John re re rejoicing about because by Revelation he knew he was part of that book what is so exciting about this message is by revelation we know we're part of the book part of the book is in me and the life of Christ is here living out that book it's the book of the life of the Lamb his life on display on the earth that's what's recorded in the book and I'm part of that book and the book is alive in me amen that's why this message is so exciting not because we imagine a a lamb with horns and eyes on the horns standing on its back little hoofs with a right those are symbols what we realize is I'm what's being redeemed amen that's right that I'm part of that original life that was fallen for God's manifestation but at the end of time he took the veil off what he's been trying to do all along and when when I saw what he was doing all along I said Glory hallelujah amen I'm part of the book and the lamb has took the book and we live in the day that the lamb has taken the book amen God what does that mean that he's now holding a book know what means he's claiming what he redeemed yeah what he did what did he redeem the names in the book what's the name in the book you yeah amen what book is he holding in his hand he came to claim his bride he's now holding me and he's come to unite with me Amen to manifest what was in this book Thank God Amen let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus we thank you God God we can't thank you enough for your word Lord God it does something to us Lord it stirs up something that's beyond comprehension Lord God I'm stirred Inside by something far beyond my intellect cuz I don't even understand the things I'm talking about but God by Revelation I know I'm part of it Lord when I hear that eagle scream there's a scream echoing inside of me that says amen when I see that eagle fly I know that there's something in me can fly I don't know how Lord but God help me to Flap my wings help me to fly God bless your children may you bring us into a greater reality of your word all the time May these things Lord that's been rehearsed over and over for decades may they be more than a sermon but may be a life Lord your life living in us may we recognize what you've called us to and may we yield ourselves to it in a greater way God help us to resist the carnal attractions of Life help us to push aside those things that don't matter Lord so that we might Lord focus on the thing that's most needful that we might be a vessel that you can use that we might be a veil that you can live in and manif manifest through bless your children Lord give us greater Revelation day by day and Lord I pray that you would help us to give you a greater preeminence that we would Lord surrender more of ourselves so that we can have more of you you so it be less of our carnal life of our old life but more of your life while we re we give ourselves to you we surrender to you we ask that you would take your place behind this veil

completely out of the way and surrendered to you help us to quit being the veil that looks to the outside but let us be the veil that gazes on the inside and recognizes what power is here to work all things are possible Lord Jesus because you're here may you manifest all things your full life may it manifest through us we pray we commit ourselves aresh to you and ask these things in Jesus Christ's
