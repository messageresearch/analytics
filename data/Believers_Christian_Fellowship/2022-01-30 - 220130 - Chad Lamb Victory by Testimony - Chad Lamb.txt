you've been so merciful and kind to us to bring us together again in this place god we're asking now that you would come and do what we cannot do lord that you would break the bread of life and that you would feed us by your own hand for we love you lord and we love your word and we're feasting on your word we're receiving you we're becoming one with you as we feast on this word lord i pray you'd give us a portion today that would take us to higher places it would give us greater victory in our lives that would help us to grow to be more like you father we love you and we ask god that you

waiting children and we might receive from you today we love you father we thank you for your goodness we pray that you would have preeminence and be glorified and all we say or do today in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you all and while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to the book of revelation and we'll go to revelation chapter 12. and just want to let you know brother manuel sent me a text and said he and his family he was invited to minister down in kentucky again and he and his family are there this weekend so if you'll be praying for them as the minister and traveling back today i want to thank everybody who came out yesterday for the memorial service for brother john it was a nice turnout we had a nice time and i appreciate everybody coming and i appreciate all those who helped with the meal and helped clean up and preparation and all that it was wonderful to be able to just gather around sister nancy and her family and show them that we love them and support them and you know as brother ben said don't forget the mcnulty family they just lost sister lou and so we want to remember them in prayer and as soon as we get funeral details we'll get that out to you all i also ask that you'll be remembering me and the family in prayer and a few of us we're going over to levi yoder's to have a service this evening and serve communion so if you remember just to keep us in prayer here at the end of the service we'll be taking off immediately amen are you happy to be in the service today isn't it wonderful to know that there's brothers and sisters who believe like you and when we gather together like this we can sing because we have the same father amen we have the same husband and there's a camaraderie that comes not because we go to the same building as the camaraderie comes because we come from the same source and we're going back to the place we came from and it unites us in a way nothing else could unite us no no geography no building no system no there's nothing else no interest in life there's nothing else that can bind us like the eternal binding that has bound us from eternity to eternity and we've dropped down here and what brother ben said this little hickey of time this little depression out of the circle of eternity to accomplish something to display something but we're going right back in to that circle of eternity and we've come from there we were together we're together we'll be together amen and i thank god for that amen so we appreciate you all this morning let's look here at revelation chapter 12 and we're going to begin at verse 7. and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength in the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe into the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time may may god ask the god we ask god to ask the blessing and bless the reading of his word praise god sit down if we're starting off this rough who knows what service is going to be like lord help us we have not come to hear an eloquent speaker we've come to hear the word of god amen that is evident amen you have to forgive me we had a busy day yesterday with the the funeral we had the funeral preparations and we had to minister to the funeral and the dinner afterwards and then i had to prepare for the preaching tonight when we go over to uh brother levi's and then i started on the service for this morning getting my notes together and uh i got really tired about 1 or 1 30 in the morning i thought i'll lay down and wake up early and and you know just go back on my notes again and i woke up and me and my wife were freezing because we had run out of propane and so i thought praise god anyhow amen but thank god we have a wood furnace we're doing fine and we'll be all right but it's always something and so i was thinking we ran around trying to get check the furnace do this find out what's going on make a call and did all that stuff so i come to church and say lord i'm depending on you but i'm expecting that god will speak to us as he always does amen so we're thankful for that we just trust the lord and we're thankful that no matter what happens when you start to see things uh i don't know if it's just as we have more experiences with god or how this goes and we grow in maturity you start to see things like this and you just hit them in stride and you say hey praise god anyhow the devil cannot stop the word of god he cannot stop the call of god in my life no troubles come those things are disappointments or distractions it cannot stop what god has purposed before the foundation of the world this too will work out for his glory amen and i realized i didn't even need to worry about it because we're on automatic fill and i guess the propane company got behind cause i called this morning and they said oh you're on the list to be filled today i thought sunday who feels on sunday but god already had to take care of i didn't even need to make the call i should have just kept doing what i was doing but god is good anyhow friends so it's good to be with you this morning i'd like to take a a subject this morning and talk about uh just um a statement out of verse 11. so let's read verse 11 again and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives to death and i want to look at this victory by testimony because it's interesting the way this is worded we know that in this passage of scripture amen that that satan is overcome he's he's completely defeated and cast out of heaven and cast into the earth and we'll get to a quote in a minute where brother benham tells us that when the bride goes up he comes down so this is uh this is in direct correlation to the victory of the bride and the translation of the bride and satan coming down and so but it says here is the way that they overcame they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and you know the blood of the lamb is something that god had provided for us when we had we had nothing to do with that god had did it himself he decided to come in a flesh a body that he called the son of god and we know him as jesus christ and god came and lived the perfect life the sacrificial life he became the lamb he died as the lamb of god he shed that perfect blind that redeemed us back to god that washes us from our sins that cleanses us from all perfection he did that for us with no input or help from us so we overcome by that and by the word of our testimony so we we have to realize that god has already done his part god did it faithfully and it was enough god has finished he's done his part but now there's a part in this overcoming when i overcome satan and overcome the devil i overcome by what god did but also by the word of our testimony that's what the scripture's saying here brother branham says in the message god hiding himself in simplicity he said but when he crossed he separated his sonship he's a sinner by nature he's under the hands and dominion of satan and god took a sacrifice a chemical blood and put the blood of bulls and goats and but the blood of bulls and ghosts did not divorce sin it only covered sin if i've got a red spot on my hand and covered with white the red spot's still there see it's still there but god sent down from heaven a bleach for sin it was the blood of his son that when our confessed sin drops into god's bleach try to bring it again the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators and down through time until it hits the accuser satan and lays on him till the day of judgment praise be to god and so the the sin uh the the the cure for sin has already been given in the blood that was shed amen and that blood that was shed was to free us from sin but when when brother bam says it this way when our confess sin amen when we confess our sin and confess the blood of jesus christ amen that sin amen drops off of us and goes down through and goes back to the accuser the originator of sin and lays on him till the day of judgment so we have to confess our sins there's a part that we must do also when we look at this in in revelations 11 uh i want to look at this word testimony where it says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony this word testimony is mature i believe is how you say it in the greek and it's translated witness 15 times testimony 14 times record seven times or report once and the definition they say what one testifies testimony for example before a judge so this is not uh this testimony if you could take it this way is this testimony is like an official report let's say it that way like a testimony before a judge amen it's it's an official report so it's not just a a whimsical statement it's not just something that i just said but when you overcome by your testimony this testimony is your witness amen your witness of the word your witness of the of the day and age that you live in it is an official report it is an official testimony it is an official declaration and we overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by this testimony or by this witness amen so we want to understand that that this is a witness or a testimony brother brahms says in 1959 and the message what hearst thou elijah by the blood of the lamb and their testimony they overcame is that right you overcome by the blood of the lamb and by your testimony if we can just have faith and believe in the lord god that he will do these things for us he says here in the first seal this is the quote that i referred to later referring to this scripture out of revelation 12 it says but in revelation 12 7-9 satan the spirit the devil which is up there now accuser of our brethren all right the church is taken up and satan is cast out when the church goes up satan comes down then satan incarnates himself in the antichrist and is called the beast so he's up there now as the accuser of our brethren so if if you would with me i'd like for us to just think of this like like a courtroom setting and you know brother branham preached the trial a trial trial a court trial he preached this message several times in 1964 and i'm going to refer to many many quotes from one of those messages but if you just think of this that before god amen there's an accuser of the brethren making accusation amen but these brethren that he's accusing are overcoming the accuser or the prosecutor of you they're overcoming by the blood of the lamb and their own witness their own testimony they are standing and testifying against the accusations of the devil they are not bowing and cowering to the accusations of the devil but they're testifying a testimony against what he's saying they say you know but you know they they did this and and they did that and and look at how they acted the other day and look at how they they spoke to their children look how they spoke to their spouse amen but there's got to be somebody that stands up with the testimony and says but his blood has covered all of my sins and i believe that by his spirit he's changing me he has washed me and he's changing me and i have repented for that god has convicted me and repented and that no longer lays to my charge your accusation is false because they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony we have got to be able to take this word and fight back the accusations of the accuser with this word of god that we believe so he's the accuser of the brethren and the accuser of the brethren is there making accusation until a certain time in this certain time when the bride has finished her testimony her witness upon this earth and the last member comes in and she has witnessed of this truth and then she will be brought up and when she goes up he comes down the accuser of the brethren has left because he can no longer accuse them because their witness was true and their witness was witnessed by the translation and he can no longer accuse them any longer so he's cast down to the earth but they overcome them they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony let's go to john chapter 14. see there's an accuser of the brethren and the worst thing you can do in your in your life is to agree with him he stands there day and night accusing the brethren and the very worst thing that you could ever do is agree with him and testify of his testimony the worst thing you'll ever do in your life amen is say what the when the prosecutor says that that you're you know it doesn't work for you and and you're not a real believer and and and god's blessing everybody else with you the worst thing you can do is stand in the seat of a witness when the prosecutor's laying that charge and you start repeating back the same thing the prosecutor says amen where's our overcoming where's our victory if we repeat what the accuser of the brethren is accusing then we're never going to be able to overcome him but we must overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of our witness our testimony we cannot repeat back what he's saying regardless of what it is amen and regardless of how we feel we must come to faith in that word and rebuke all that accusation by the word of god now in john chapter 15 verse 26 he says but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning i want you to look at this scripture and see that these disciples that he's sending out these disciples they will receive the comforter which jesus said i will send to you which earlier jesus said i will pray to the father that he'll send to you so who sent the comforter if you keep reading in john you're going to find out they're all the same thing jesus said i'll pray to the father that he'll send to you another comforter and now now jesus says when the comforters come whom i will send to you from the father and then he says the comforter is the spirit of truth and that he will come to you and the spirit of truth is the holy ghost and then jesus said and i will come to you so who's coming to you is it the spirit of the truth is it the comforter is it the holy ghost did it come from jesus or did it come from the father [Music] so this spirit of truth this comforter this holy spirit he he i will send you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me because the spirit of truth is the spirit of god is the spirit of the word is the life of the word is the spirit of the truth he can never testify anything but the truth the truth is the only thing that he can testify so you can never get the holy ghost to give a false testimony of the word of god the holy ghost will only give a true witness because he is sent to be the true witness and the true witness was sent to you to dwell in you so that with the holy ghost then you can have a true witness so the true witness comes to you to give you a true witness but then he says the holy ghost will testify of me and you also shall bear witness because and that bear witness is the same word as testify you shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning i'm going to ask you a question this scripture here in john 15 27 if if jesus is referring to the beginning of his life none of these disciples he's talking about it doesn't count if he's talking about the beginning of his ministry it'll count for most of them but as his ministry went along he picked up a few more disciples so the question is is he speaking of the beginning of his earthly life is he beginning you know was it the beginning of his ministry when he was baptized because you know andrew found him then and then quickly after peter then a few others in the then he come along in his ministry and gathered some more so if so then that scripture only applies to 11 people is that right but how many of you believe that the scripture applies to you then what makes you a witness or able to bear witness is because you have been with him from the beginning when the logos came out of the father you were there amen when when that expression of the thought of god came out in word form as the logos you were there and because you were there amen that gives you the ability to bear witness because you were with him from the beginning and because you were with me from the beginning you were put on this earth amen to be a witness because the devil will be overcame but he will be overcame and cast out of heaven when the believers overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony so the overcoming of the accuser and the casting down of the accuser is dependent on you and i having a true witness how many want satan to be cast down look let's go back if we can really quickly let's go back to to revelation chapter 12. i want to read this again i started verse 7 again and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him so we see here that he has deceived the whole world but he hasn't deceived me because i'm not part of the world i'm not of the world i come from another father i come from another place jesus says i'm born from above you're from below so he's deceived the whole world but he hasn't deceived the children of god all right he deceived the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with them and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused him before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them this is what heaven has been waiting for there's a rejoicing amen that is the heaven is being reserved for a certain rejoicing and they will rejoice amen when the accuser of the brethren is cast down when michael has the final victory and the accuser of the brother is cast out and those that have been accused have overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of the testimony when the bride goes up he goes down they've overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony amen and now rejoice the heavens and ye that dwell in them and woe into the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down but heaven now is rejoicing why heaven is rejoicing because the last part of christ the last one of his part of his body amen has come to full maturity and has stood the witness in the face of satan's eden and is standing as a true witness giving a true witness have overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony and that has caused amen that final victory of the the bride at the end time has caused the translation the casting down and now heaven is free from that spirit and now there's rejoicing in heaven why because there had to be somebody to give a witness somebody to give a testimony let's look at colossians chapter 1. colossians chapter 1 verse 26. colossians 1 verse 25 where if i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory so there is a hope for glory and that hope is christ in you so that you can become the witness to stand against the accuser of the brethren and that hope is in you let's go to acts chapter 1. acts chapter 1. and verse 6. acts chapter 1 verse 6 and when they were therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and all judea and in samaria and to the uttermost part of the earth jesus is telling the people and telling the disciples that you shall receive power after the holy ghost but what was that power to do they were to receive the the power that would change their nature that would change their life and they would receive the true witness that testifieth of the truth amen so that they could be witnesses so the so god was giving them the spirit of truth the power so that they could give a true witness because god wanted them to be witnesses and we see all the way over and revelation chapter 12 how important their witness their testimony the word witness and testimony is the same how they're using their witness and their testimony to overcome the devil so he sends the spirit of god upon him the spirit of truth so that they can be witnesses of him amen and as they're witnesses of him amen they're overcoming the devil so he gave them the holy ghost so that they could be witnesses of him unto the uttermost part of the earth that shows that that promise was not just for them they weren't the only ones to be the witness because they start in jerusalem they go to judea and to samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth and hey we're still going to the uttermost parts of the earth because the holy ghost has come to make us witnesses of him and that is how we overcome brother branham said in 1958 in the message have faith in god it was on the day of pentecost when 150 jews were in an upper room with the door closed waiting for the promise cowardly afraid to testify the door shut because of the threat of the jews it was after the resurrection christ had come in the form of the holy spirit and had given them an experience and licking tongues of fire set upon them it was then they could run out into the streets and and peter could say ye men of israel and ye that dwell in judea let this be known unto you and hearken to my words it was after he had had the experience of receiving the holy spirit that he could testify fearless and seal his testimony with his own blood crucified with his head turned down after he had an experience so after that experience it gave peter boldness amen to be able to go and testify of what he believed before that the brother and i said timid and cowardly amen but after the baptism the holy ghost the power came to him the true witness came to him amen and peter had the revelation of the word for his day and he ran out so convinced the first thing he does is when he runs out into the public he stands there and he begins to proclaim to them the word of god that was taking place in their day he begins to say this is that that joel prophesied this is prophecy fulfilled amen he started preaching modern events made clear by prophecy that was that the holy ghost gave him power to do it gave him power to proclaim the manifestation that he was in currently he was no longer afraid he was no longer uncertain he was no longer questioning amen he had backslidden he had he had he had gone back on christ because he was protecting his own life but when we go to revelations chapter 12 they overcame by the word of their testimony by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony because they love not their lives unto death and that's what peter received when he ran out that day it was no longer peter protecting peter now peter would get arrested he would he would stand before the the sanhedrin and before the council and the elders and they would tell him don't do this and they would threaten him and they would threaten with abuse and threaten with imprisonment and he would say hey is it far better to listen to man or to listen to god you tell me something had changed he was so convinced when he received the power of the true witness amen it unlocked the power of the word in him and he went out to testify of the days and the age that he lived when he received the holy ghost he didn't go out and preach a previous age gospel when he received the holy ghost he preached present tense gospel and it wasn't just words but he had the life on the inside he had the experience of receiving the life of christ and now he could go and be a a witness he could testify of christ and then in the message investments from 1963 the prophet of god says the life that is in you shows what you are your life testifies so loud in you until your toast testimony is not heard just think about that your testimony is your witness your witness in this world is not always words now i believe it comes with words and many times it needs words but the expression the witness or your testimony in this life is not always just words your life is a witness of christ in this day so i read that again the life that's in you shows what you are your life testifies so loud in you until your testimony is not heard they know what you are by the life that you live in the things that you do if the life of christ is in you then therefore the works and life of christ you live because that's his life living through you you're just in a vessel to carry on the work of god so we're here to be a witness and we're here to witness this present tense truth and the power of the holy ghost has come to change us from our old life and give us the life of christ that will quicken to us the word for our day the message of the hour and we will go out and not testify of previous day truths but we will go out and testify of present tense truth and our testimony will not be words only but power and demonstration of the gospel it will be a life lived it'll be the word fleshed out what peter and the disciples had is they had the revelation of the word for their day but they had the life that proved that the life of christ was inside of them it was both amen the testimony was their life and the word that they preached now i want to spend a little time if you uh be patient with me i want to spend a lot a little time in the in a message i'm going to read several quotes out of a message titled a court trial from 1964 this one was preached april 12 1964 and i want to i want to go through these things these quotes and there's quite a few of them but look at how brother branham was teaching this in a trial brother branham had already preached the indictment amen before he comes to this point so after an indictment then you have a trial you know so it's just interesting that he's now in the trial but in this trial that he's talking about here it's the devil who's trying to accuse god the devil's trying to accuse god of not keeping his word and not all of his word being true and so brother venom sets a drama he makes the church the courtroom amen and he and he starts down this path but i want to look at what he says here and in paragraph 56 he says and the prosecuting attorney also has some witnesses in the case and i'm going to name them and one of them is mr unbeliever and the next one is mr skeptic and the next one is mr impatient these are the one that is trying to get judgment against god now we have all the characters called in now and we're in court so we're going to call the court to order all right the order is the court is called to order and the prosecuting attorney is now going to call his first witness to give witness and his first witness to the stand is mr unbeliever and his complaint is that god's word of promise is not altogether true that's what his complaint is the first witness says he claims that he is a believer though he isn't but he claims he is and he claims that he was attending here some time ago a holy ghost so-called meeting where the people were laying hands upon the people and giving their scriptural rights to do this reading it out of mark 16 where i've just read they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover mr unbeliever testifies and he says that i had the hands of this what was called the holy ghost-filled preacher lay his hands upon me according to mark 16 the promise that god made and the man said he was a believer and many claimed to be healed and he laid his hands upon me and that's been two months ago and nothing's happened therefore the promise is not true all right we asked mr unbeliever to step down so brother graham's doing it as a case the prosecuting attorney he asked his first witness his first witness was mr unbeliever mr unbeliever brother ram title is he mr unbeliever but that's not what mr unbeliever would have went by because he saw he called himself a believer he thought he was a church member and a believer he was an unbeliever posing as a believer i'd say this way that can still be possible that is still possible that that there are unbelievers posing as believers and he thinks that he's a believer and he thinks that there was something untrue in the word of god because god made a claim in his word and i did what god said i had him lay hands on me and it didn't work there is something where there's something wrong with the word of god and it's just amazing to me how brash the the devil can be sometimes amen when he brings accusations because because he's claiming that there's something wrong with the word of god and he never listen the the devil didn't come this mr unbeliever i should say it this way this this unbelieving believer this unbelieving believer has the audacity under a deception accused god of not keeping his word that there's a problem with god's word and never the common sense to say that maybe there's something wrong with me but lays the accusation to the word of god then next it goes on down i'm just skipping through i'm just gonna i've pulled little uh excerpts out of this message so next witness stands up is mr skeptic now he testifies he said i went to a church he was sick and i went to a church that was supposed to have a godly pastor in and that had faith in god's word and had a little crucifix sitting upon his on his desk and all of his people that came in there that wanted to be prayed for he anointed them with oral reading the promise out of god's word in james 5 14. he read the word and said if there be any sick among you let them call the elders of the church let them anoint them in oil and pray over them and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and god shall raise him up if they did any sin it shall be forgiven him now and he said i had as this pastor who had heard testimonies from others anoint me with oil reading the scriptures to me out of god's promise and that has been over a month ago and i'm still just as sick as i was when he anointed me therefore that's his complaint let mr skeptic step down and the prosecuting attorney satan calls his next witness his next witness is mr impatient that's that's a rascal look at this that's a rascal i want to tell you today that mr impatient is still a rascal excuse that expression he just makes you get you so nervous you don't know what you're doing mr impatient he claims that one day while reading the bible all these all these claim to be believers now now think about it mr unbeliever mr skeptic and mr impatient they all claim to be believers they claim to be believers now and they he claims that he was reading the bible and he come across the passage in mark 11 22 and 23 where jesus himself made the promise that if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you have said and again he said if you when you pray and believe that you receive what you asked for now he says i've been a in my feet laying in my feet for some 30 years and i accepted that promise five years ago and nothing has happened since i'm still just as crippled as i ever was now see then he steps down so we've had our three witnesses on the prosecutor's side the prosecutor of satan and the three witnesses are mr unbeliever mr skeptic mr impatient so i really want i'm not mean to add to the message but i really want to bring clarity to this as brother benham said we have mr unbelieving believer mr skeptical believer and mr impatient believer because they all claim to believers they're all part of the church see we're not we're not in the place i don't believe we're in the place right now where the devil he knows his tactics and he's wise he's not ignorant he just didn't wake up this morning and decide that he wanted to try to defeat the children of god he has been working a plan for for the from the beginning he's been working a plan from before the garden of eden and so he's wise and so he comes in the devil comes in in the church he comes in in your thinking he comes in and uses scriptures the devil is so deceptive and we talked about this a little while back when we were talking about the temptation of jesus christ and we were seeing how deceptive the devil is that he comes as an angel of life he comes as a believer or he comes with the word and he's trying to cause you to either unbelieve or be skeptical or be impatient and he uses the word to try to get you to do that the devil is trying to get you to be the unbelieving believer he's trying to get you to be the skeptical believer he's trying to get you to be the impatient believer and he's going to use circumstances he's going to use scriptures and in this day and age we live in the devil will use quotes it's amazing that the devil will use the very thing that is to give us strength which is the word of god and the very thing to give us overcoming power over him and he will use the very thing that god has sent to help us overcome him and he will use it to overcome us it is spiritual judo where you use your opponent's strength against him and our strength is the revealed word of god so the devil will try to use that and try to work as an angel of light seemingly good and try to rob us of our faith and disrupt us and destroy our testimony because it's our testimony that's going to destroy him so brother bam goes on to say we're in the same message court trial we will be i think for the rest of the service he says therefore he is indicting god trying to get a case against him to say that god has put something in his word for his believing children and does not stand behind what he promised now i want you to look at this the real contest that's going on here is a contest between satan and the word of god this is the real contest the contest that's going on all around us is a contest between satan and the word of god he is trying to discredit the word he's trying to destroy the word he is trying to defeat the word amen and so satan he he the whole battle is over the word of god so satan will bring his witnesses to witness against the word of god amen but brother brahms is going to bring us a defense witness on the scene here in a minute and the defense witness is the holy ghost that was sent to testify of christ and the defense witness also has witness says the defense witness will testify himself but he also has witnesses that will testify too because the court case is over whether or not the word of god is true or not and satan has always been trying to discredit god's word amen but there's going to be witnesses that witness against that word but i'm here to say there will be witnesses that will be a true witness with a true testimony that'll stand with the defense witness and say no you're wrong mr unbeliever this word is the truth amen you're wrong mr skeptic this word is the truth you're wrong mr impatient this word is the truth i believe our brother bernie sanders can stand on that day and say mr impatient you're wrong amen many others can stand on that day and say mr impatient you're wrong i remember the testimony of sister viola yingst and sister viola yanks you know she she went through the prayer line on her 40th birthday in july i believe in 1963 in the message i think if i i i might have it wrong but i think it's he cares do you care and if you listen to that tape the first person through the prayer line is sister viola ying she had prayer card number one on her 40th birthday and she goes through the prayer line and there's several things amen that was going on in the life and brother ben begins to discern i see you have a thyroid condition i see a doctor and you've got spiritual troubles you don't know whether you're in you don't know whether you're out and that was because she was just coming to the message and the rest of her family wasn't seeing it yet and she was on thyroid medication and he says i see you holding your head i may not be quoting this exactly right but but you understand you've got bad headaches and sister viola told me that brother ben prayed for her and she left she said instantly she quit taking her thyroid medicine and had no more problems with her thyroid that moment and then uh her and brother ed got a revelation of the message together and and the family come to the message together and the spiritual trouble settled out but she said she had to wait multiple years before she was finally delivered of migraine headaches and some of the family here might remember i don't remember but it was years and years and years it was a long time and it was the same sister coming before the same prophet believing the same word and having the same prayer one is healed instantly one is he uh one comes one deliverance comes shortly thereafter and one she has to wait for multiple years before it's fulfilled i say sister viola yinks is going to be able to stand on that day and say mr impatient you're wrong you're wrong abraham's going to be able to stand and say mr impatient you're wrong 25 years i waited but god was true to his word amen mr impatient you're wrong sister viola can say mr impatient you're wrong brother bernie can say mr impatient you're wrong brother bernie got a terrible case of shingles that left him with nerve damage and he had pain for years amen he prayed believed god was anointed with oil and stood by his confession and after five years god removes it in a moment with no explanation it's not explainable how it went away even the doctor told brother bernie that it doesn't that doesn't see any way that you'll be healed you'll probably live this way because these things there's no there was no healing that the doctors could give for that what do you say brother bernie is mr impatient wrong he's wrong he's a liar praise be to god these this mr impatient whispers in your ear this mr skeptic comes in worship whispers in your ear this mr unbeliever comes and worships in your ear trying to get you to deviate off the word of god and lose confidence and brother brahm says going on with the case he's trying to get a case against him he's indicting god trying to get a case against him to say that god has put something in his word for his believing children and does not stand by behind what he promised also he claims that he is unfair to make such promises to people to his believing children and is not able to back up what he said he would do now the prosecuting attorney is showing a hard case here against the defendant he's not able to back it up because he's got witnesses here he does not stand behind the word that he promised yet the prosecuting attorney speaks on the prosecuting attorney says which is satan yet god promised that all these things are possible to believers god says that in his word the prosecuting attorney is sealing up his case now you see he thinks he's got it because the three witnesses that give witness and give it to the scripture and has quoted the scripture right and everything the way that they've done it the devil the the the prosecuting attorney he thinks he's got his case sealed up he's got three witnesses they've all quoted the word of god all showing that the word of god failed but then the prophet of god goes on to say now we'll call the defense witness the holy spirit oh he was sent to testify to be a witness of christ but he was not sent to do it alone you're to testify with him if brother frank if you don't mind to bring up the whiteboard i want to i want to look together let's go back to genesis chapter 3. let's go to genesis chapter 3. verse 1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of him neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did he and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons i want to look at this serpent speaking to eve now to the woman in the temptation i'm going to say eve so we know who we're talking about we know that her name was not eve at this time her name was woman she was named eve after adultery so she has a name of adultery or a name of a blasphemy she has a blasphemous name because the churches take names after they leave the word so eve is now going to be deceived and the serpent comes along and the serpent is going to play the role sorry that's an arrow of mr unbeliever all right he's first going to play the role of mr unbeliever and he begins to say you you shall not surely die he he's taking the word of god that was a direct comment a direct commandment from the lord and he begins to sow a little doubt about the the exact wording of the an exact meaning of the scripture and he's just sowing a little bit of doubt he comes in a mr believer and says you shall not surely die i mean god's not really going to kill you you're not really going to die and he begins to start with a little doubt in the mind of eve and then he comes down here as mr skeptic and he begins to make her question why god would do such a thing like that and he says for ver let's just read this together let's go over here to verse 4 and the servant said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil now all of a sudden mr skeptic he he begins to say you know uh god's keeping something from you there's more to this story i mean god knows that if you eat that your eyes will be open and you'll becomes his gods knowing good and evil so mr skeptic he brings a little skeptical something about the word now god's holding something back there's a little more truth here there's a little more something to this you're not getting the whole picture you're not getting the whole story amen there's something god's holding something back from you and then he comes as mr impatient and brother branham said he fell because she just couldn't wait she just couldn't wait god had a plan for her and god would have revealed this plan to the man and to the woman if they would have just waited they would have got god's perfect will on what to do but she was impatient she just wouldn't wait so he comes to the serpent comes now who is the serpent amen the serpent was not was not known to them as the devil the serpent was not the devil the serpent was a friend and the devil came into the serpent to deceive them amen but the serpent was not the devil the serpent was part of their church the serpent was part of their church the serpent believed god he believed in god i should say it that way he didn't believe god or he wouldn't have said what he said but the serpent believed in god amen the serpent was part of their church the serpent amen looked almost like a child of god but wasn't a child of god the serpent was something that was similar to a child of god without being a child of god and the serpent even had a place for a soul without having a soul so he was even built very similar to a child of god and looked almost like a child of god but was not a child of god the serpent could speak like a child of god the serpent could hear the word like a child of god and speak like a child of god and talk about god and worship god and speak of god's word but the serpent could never be a child of god so what did the devil use what what vessel did the devil use to bring this deception he brought a friend he brought part of the church of the garden was the name of the church the garden church they were in the garden of eden the first church of the garden of eden and in the first church of the garden of eden there was a member in that church that had a place our soul without a soul was like a child of god but wasn't a child of god and that's where the devil came in for deception and incarnated that vessel began to work through somebody that that the woman was familiar with than what a woman had maybe probably worshipped with the one that that talked about god maybe this wasn't the first time the serpent and the woman had a conversation about god but he begins to he begins to sow a little doubt about the commandment and he begins to sow a little doubt about one part of the commandment amen yes it's true yes god said that but you'll not surely die and there that seed of unbelief drops in and she begins to disbelieve one small part of the word of god she never stopped believing in god she never stopped believing this was a commandment of god just one little part and then he starts to show a little skepticism in her mind and say you know god knows more than you and god's trying to keep this from you because god knows that if you take this then your eyes will be open and you'll be like gods and god doesn't want you to have that and there's a little skepticism that's sewn in and what was eve living under she was living under the message of her day she had the word for that day she had the message of the hour for that day and the devil was coming attacking the message with a little bit of doubt about the message and a little bit of doubt uh a little bit of skepticism about you know really i mean god there's there's something more to this uh a little bit of skepticism about you know is that really right that seems a little bit strange and then a little bit of impatience you know you know it's already been how many years eve how many years have it been since god gave that commandment you see we're in the garden friends we've been given the message of the hour we've been given the word amen we've been united with our bridegroom again we've been put back together and given the full word of god just like eve had the full word of god for her day we've been given the full word of god for our day but don't think that the devil has stopped all of his tricks he has not he's not gone on vacation he's not gone into early retirement he is still here doing what he's always done we have to understand him and all of his tactics so the serpent i'm going to put over here oh man i don't know how to get rid of that i'm not smart enough i'll work on it some other time the serpent was a church member part of the church part of the first church of the garden so uh i want to look at something else here in just a second let's let me finish this quote now we will call the defense witness the holy spirit you know if there's a defendant there has to be a defense witness so we'll call the defense witness to defend the defendant the holy spirit the first thing that the holy spirit says when he steps up is this he wants to call the attention to the prosecutor that the one that's trying trying to try the case that's indicted the prosecutor has misinterpreted the word to the people just like he did to the first human being eve in the garden of eden he has misinterpreted the word to the people and the holy spirit the defense witness calls the attention to this notice he said the prosecutor has said that these promises are to the he says the prosecutor has said that these promises are to the believers and that believers is the only thing that the promise is to not to unbelievers and skeptics the defense witness claims that god distinctly said that it was to the believers and calls the attention that each one that testified in protest against the word admitted that others claimed to be healed so the first thing to dispense witness when he gets up the holy ghost which he says he he says i want to bring attention to one thing that everything the prosecutor claimed all the scriptures that he used and all the scriptures that he claimed the promises of god that didn't work i want to make note of something for the court that those promises are only to believers all right that's just for the when the defense witness comes the holy ghost comes on the scene that's the first thing he wants to make clear amen you may say the word didn't work i tried it a thousand times i waited 20 years but the holy ghost the first thing he wants to establish this truth is that these scriptures only work for the believers they're only promised to the believers amen and it's not my fault if it didn't work in your life amen and because this promise came to the believers and i'm a believer and i'll never throw away my promise because of your testimony you may be a believer who's under deception and you'll get corrected and everything will be fine i'm not saying you're not a believer but i'm saying your testimony will never throw me off because these promises by the witness of the holy ghost are only to god's believing children and just because you have something to say against it amen doesn't change any of the effect of the word of god in my life just because you testify amen there's so many people now that have left the message and they leave the message then they go online and they start a youtube channel and they want to give the world their testimony of why i left the message and what the message did to me and and i just want to say amen on in his defense standing amen in the witness booth this morning that this message only came for the bride of jesus christ it only came for the bride of jesus christ amen it did not come if you're not bride this message was not for you amen and what's funny about this this is what this is just what i find interesting is now you have individuals who are willing to leave the truth of god because it didn't work for them they there was things that went wrong there was difficulties there was uh uh maybe even wrong things that happened ministers that had done wrong and things that they had believed incorrectly or were taught incorrectly or whatever happened sin in their life whatever reason they leave they're willing now to take the stand before hundreds or even thousands of people to testify against the word but when they were believing the message they never took the stand where's the youtube video that says this is why i believe the message but we're willing to take a public stand against the word the bride won't take a stand against the word this message came for the bride of jesus christ this message came to call out a bride to equip a bride to mature a bride amen and to bring a bride to the full the full potential of the word for this day amen so the first thing that the defense witness wants to establish is that the word of promise is only promised to the children of god first thing he says again calling the intention now the prosecutor has misquoted the word and god never said that they would jump up right quick as soon as they had hands laid on them but he said they that believe would recover that is if he believes it's only to believers and again the defense witness wants to call the attention to the court this afternoon that god said that his word was a seed the word is a seed that a sower sowed if this soil seed falls into the right kind of soil that's got enough fertility in it to make the seed spring to life quicken it it'll live now i i just want to look at this mr unbeliever mr skeptic and mr impatient just for a minute and look at it down through history i'm not going to take a lot of time on this but just quickly because i believe that all the things that were written before for our examples mr unbeliever is here to bring doubt upon the word of god but sometimes he doesn't make you it doesn't not but not make you doubt the word sometimes he just makes you doubt the word is for you this is the greatest deception of mr unbeliever because you think if mr unbeliever is whispering in your ear he's going to get you to deny that the message is true to get you deny that that this word the scripture is not true that there is no god that there is no bride that there is no redemption or no attorney or that that would be mr unbeliever but sometimes mr unbeliever he comes in so deceptive he doesn't want you to doubt any of that he doesn't want you to doubt that the message is true he doesn't want you to doubt that brother branham was a true prophet of god he doesn't want you to doubt that all the scriptures are being fulfilled in our day he doesn't want you to doubt that god has called a bride and that there's been an invisible union and that the bride is being caught up word by word he doesn't want you to doubt any of that all that mr believer wants you to do is doubt that it's for you if he can get you to believe that healing's for somebody else and that deliverance is for somebody else and that this message is for somebody else and there's a bride out there but i don't know if i'm the bride if mr unbeliever can get you that far he has already won that's all the victory that he needs he doesn't need you in fact i don't believe mr unbeliever wants you to make a full denunciation of everything because you're more valuable as a tool of deception if you remain saying i believe this and i believe that and it's all the truth but it just doesn't work for me i just can't seem to overcome because your negative testimony of the word amen will bring more unbelief and doubt that if it didn't work for this sister then maybe it won't work for me so mr unbeliever is not necessarily trying to get you to denounce the whole program of god and go running away and call it all a lie he might be just trying to get you to deny that this word is for me and look at what he did to sarah amen before sarah was changed their promise came to abraham that you're going to have a son and sarah believed that promise but then sarah began to doubt that that promise was for her and she began to say take hagar my handmaid and this is how we'll get seed she wasn't disbelieving the word she was disbelieving the word for her she was disbelieving that she could be changed that she could conceive seed that she could bring forth a child that she could nurse the child she was looking at all of her physical conditions and she was doubting she was not doubting the promise she was doubting the promise for her and when she doubted the promise for her this is how deceptive the devil is when she doubted the promise for her she created through her doubt a hybrid product and that hybrid product became the persecutor of the church for the rest of their days and is still the persecutor of the jews so what did her doubt do her doubt produced amen uh their doubt produced a byproduct a hybrid product and that hybrid product became the persecutor of the true genuine product that's exactly what he produced right to doubt the word of god not leave the church not leave the message amen but just doubt that it works for you and come up with another way to have victory come up with another way to overcome come up with another way to make the word work amen bringing a hybrid product and that hybrid product will be the persecutor of the true amen so he made sarah doubt that it was for her she didn't doubt it to be true she didn't doubt that god spoke to abraham they didn't doubt that they were supposed to bring forth the promised son she just doubted that it would work for her i hope more than anything that the message that god has given us so exposed the devil that we stop tripping over the same tripping stones but this bride will keep her testimony in this day because the tactics of the devil have been exposed let's look at mr skeptic this one has been interesting for me to look at i don't like this guy i don't like any of them but i particularly don't like this guy this skeptic he wants you to question he wants you to question something he's throwing a question god doesn't know that the day you eat there of like your eyes will be there's something more to this you're not getting the whole picture something is odd something's wrong with this and brother bram uses the example of i went to a service where he had a little vial of oil and they put the oil on me and the mr skeptic he'll begin to ask questions like how is there healing power and oil isn't that just olive oil and and he starts mr skeptic starts to question the integrity of something and what's behind it like why would you put oil in somebody and for you who's looking at mr skeptic and you've never come across a mr skeptic before you're like duh because the bible says anoint with oil but then mr skeptic will be like but what kind of oil do you need does it have to be like extra virgin olive oil should it be olive oil and imported from israel near gethsemane where the olive trees were where god prayed like what kind of oil and what ingredients did we put in the oil did we put in the oil kind of like the the same fragrance and frankincense and myrrh and what was in i how do you do and he starts to ask questions that are irrelevant and have no meaning he's asking about the power of the oil and it's not the power of the oil it's faith and obedience to the word of god but mr skeptic starts pointing out and questioning things that don't need to be questioned [Music] he starts sowing doubt and bringing odd questions and and asking things what what does it matter anyways amen if god said do this and i do it i believe god knows amen the integrity of my heart if i obey his word god will keep his word and and mr skeptic he he begins to question and he begins to begins to point out possible errors ah if we look at mr skeptic we look at this story in the bible at the woman who touched jesus's hymn let's look at this story i got the scripture wrote down in matthew chapter 9. let's go to matthew chapter 9. matthew chapter 9 verse 19. and jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples a behold a woman which was was diseased with an issue of blood 12 years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment for she said within herself if i may but touch his garment i shall be whole but jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole and the woman was made whole from that hour now you take a mr skeptic with a mr skeptic spirit and remember mr skeptic can be in the church and mr skeptic he could say something like this where did moses tell us to touch the hem of somebody's garment what scripture did she base her faith upon where is it written that if you touch the hem of somebody's garment you'll be made every bit whole but the scripture tells us that she said within herself if i can but touch the hem of his garment i'll be made every bit whole and when jesus turned around and looked at her he said daughter thy faith has made thee whole and so mr skeptic will be like what kind of spiritualism is this what do you think the pharisees said that day what do you think the fair the pharisees wouldn't just accept it as a miracle they would explain it away some way there'd be skeptics within the church within the pharisees and the sadducees and they would begin to become skeptical about this and say you know where where did moses where did moses or any of the prophets tell us that someday somebody will touch the hem of somebody's garment and be made every bit whole see she just received a revelation she believed it acted upon faith and god answered her faith and healed her but the skeptics they begin to question and they begin to say where where was this in the in the scriptures and and who told her to do that and by what authority and and what part of the word they begin to bring doubt and they begin to bring skepticism and and and begin to question things and begin to cause a question where there doesn't need to be a question why question it the woman has made every bit whole so where do we get this so god jesus never corrected the woman for having the wrong kind of faith or putting faith in the wrong thing jesus never turned around and said listen that'll work this time i'll overlook that this time but don't that's not the right way let's look at let's turn over to matthew 14. we're going to go a little bit later in the story jesus has done works he's been traveled to different places after this incident took place healed more people but in chapter 14 verse 34. it says and when they were gone over they came into the land of gnesserat and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent out into all the country round about and brought unto him all that were diseased and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garments and as many as touched were made perfectly whole my question is where did they hear about this where did these people in ganesha when he crossed over amen the sea and came to ganesha where did they hear about this this comes later no doubt the testimony of that woman went forward and they had the audacity but regardless of what mr skeptic said about what scripture and wind and moses and this looks like spiritualism and blah blah blah they would throw all the way and said if it worked for her if god honored her faith god will honor my faith if it worked for her it'll work for me if he's the same god there he'll be the same god here he's the same yesterday today and forever [Music] and so later when they come over to ganesha they begin to lay the sick down so that when he walks by they can just touch the hem of their garment amen what were they doing they had seen god honor that kind of faith now they were coming with the same kind of faith that god honored who cares what mr skeptic said about why or with a spiritualism who cares god is answering the faith of the people that'll just have the simplicity to believe god when they see god amen what about this one in brother branham's life do you remember the story where the jack mormon had a brother and that brother was having epileptic seizures and he had him all his life and he was going to have a surgery for him and brother benham told him to get word to him you know not to do it or i don't remember the exact details of the story but anyways he told him they said the next time he bring him home and the next time he has that fit you rip his shirt off of him and throw it to the fire and say i do this in the name of jesus christ and i'll have no problems no more now can you imagine uh sitting there that day and mr skeptic comes knocking on your door and says where did jesus ever do a thing like that where did you see that in the bible paul didn't do that amen where does he get this from this looks like some kind of spiritualism mr skeptic you know can you imagine if it was you if it happened to you i mean they're sitting there that day amen and and brother brown gives them instructions and and the instructions are so odd to the natural way of thinking they're so unusual to anything these people have ever experienced before in their lives and and the prophet of god doesn't give them a list of bible references he just tells them that next time he has that fit tear his shirt off and throw in the fire and say i do this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and he'll not have problems anymore and he said it happened that the next time he had a fit his the jack mormon's wife amen was there alone and she was afraid when he had these fit she'd gather the children they would get out of his way when he have a fit but she so had confidence in this man of god that mr skeptic whispered in his ear is not going to stop her amen she runs over there straddles over top of this young man which would be her brother-in-law amen rips off his shirt throws it into the fire and said i do this in the name of jesus christ and he never had an epileptic fit after that how does mr skeptic handle that try to bring doubt and questions and and criticisms but the true believer just believes mr skeptic saying well that's strange listen paul never told us to do that well that's fine paul never told us to do that but i believe it's every bit the truth and i believe that was commandment from god to that those people and so mr skeptic can say whatever he wants to say he can point to whatever he wants to point i believe that with all my heart and i believe that was from the lord and i believe the lord answered their faith because the prophet had the word of the lord and he knew exactly what to tell them to do in that situation it may seem odd to others it may confuse others it may cause skepticism to increase and people to say where did he say this and where did he say that you know brother branham said a lot of amazing things amen he began to teach about a civilization amen that was on the earth before genesis 1 2 destruction between genesis 1 1 and genesis 1 2 said it could have been billions of years maybe that's where the dinosaurs came from and blah blah blah and i'll tell you i believe it just the way he said it you can doubt it if you want to you can question it if you want you can mister skepticism could rise up and say well you know we really don't have scripture and that may have been brother brandon just trying to piece something together i believe it just the way he said it i believe there was something on the earth amen that was judged and we find it judged in genesis 1 2. what it was i don't know all the details i don't know but i believe it just the way he said it you can be skeptical if you want you can say well where did paul teach that because brother branham said i taught what paul taught you know that when when the apostle paul wrote a letter to the let's say to the corinthians he's in prison or wherever he's at at the time and he writes a letter to the corinthians when paul wrote the letter it was just a letter it was a letter he wrote the letter in fact paul didn't even write his own letters because of whatever his affliction was he had a scribe who wrote almost all of his letters so he would dictate somebody would write down what he was dictating to them they'd seal it up they'd carry it off to the corinthian church they would open it up in front of the corinthian church and they would read it and what paul said to do they did they didn't say what scripture is paul talking about when paul says that when paul says that the circumcision we have now is the circumcision of the heart not of the flesh where did moses say that but when paul wrote that letter amen the believers in that day they didn't say well let's take paul's letter that he wrote and then all the parts that we can find in the scripture will keep but the parts that we can't find in the scripture we won't keep paul's letter was the scriptures we read the bible and when we read the bible we're reading a letter that a church age messenger and a prophet of god wrote to a church in corinth wrote to a church in ephesus wrote to a church and he wrote it to the church and that day they had to receive it by faith having faith in who that man was they didn't know that what they got was the scripture we look back and we say when paul says it that's thus saith the lord is that right when paul says amen if paul says this in the scripture it's thus saith the lord if paul says this is the way you do it in the church that's the way you do it in the church if paul says amen you don't stumble a brother you don't stumble a brother if paul says whatever paul says in those letters is the way we do it is thus saith the lord [Music] and we look back and say well obviously what else would they say it's the bible it wasn't the bible in their day [Applause] [Music] and paul was bringing things that put him absolutely contrary to the pharisees because he was saying things amen that you could not find direct correlation for in the scripture but paul was pulling out grace out of the law and he was establishing grace it was all the way through the bible but they couldn't see it but paul could see it by revelation and he would begin to take basing it on the entire bible he wrote this letter [Music] and they may not have been able to say what he said hear all that deuteronomy xyz but when he wrote that letter that was thus saith the lord to that church and there were skeptics in paul's day there were skeptics who would say you know where does he get this no physical circumcision that's not anywhere in the bible there were a group of judaizers that were going around amen behind paul to the churches that paul established and they were they were bringing back law bringing back circumcision this is what the book of galatians is all about and they were skeptical of paul's writing because they believed paul had moved them away from the scriptures and they were trying to bring them back to the scriptures not knowing that paul was writing the scriptures [Music] [Applause] but there had to be people that would believe the word for their day and the apostle paul they would take from him handkerchiefs and napkins and they would take those handkerchiefs and napkins and go lay them on the sick they would take them from his body and lay them on the sick and they would recover where did the bible say take handkerchiefs and napkins right but when when the church believed it god honored their faith amen because god had sent them a messenger in their day and they believed that messenger and god honored their faith so they could be skeptical but god honored their faith [Music] praise god they would lay people on the street so peter's shadow could pass over them what would mr skeptical say about that peter coming along had the keys to the kingdom was an apostle of jesus christ amen filled with the holy ghost and they would lay people brother branham he listen he made this statement he said there was a a woman come here the other day was talking to some deacons or something in the church and they said just show me where the man walked if i walk in his footsteps god will heal me [Music] brother branham didn't say that woman's nuts get her out of here brother benham said what kind of faith is that amen amen mr skeptic can have a heyday with the apostles and with peter and with paul and then even with this woman who who who had so much faith in the prophet of god for a day if she could just she believed if i could just walk where the man walked i would be healed and brother bedam said what faith is that praise be to god mr skepticism has had a day he's trying to have a day he's trying mr skepticism is trying to get people to not accept what brother branham said if they can't find it in the bible well that little jack mormon's wife she believed it even though she couldn't find it in the bible and it worked for her so this mr skepticism he seems religious because remember these are in the church he seems religious because i just want to stay i just want to stay where it's safe i don't want to get off in fanaticism well nobody wants to get off in fanaticism but the pharisees wanted to stay where it was safe the judaizers in the early christian church they wanted to stay where it was safe with circumcision and feast days and all they wanted to stay where it was safe but paul was trying to bring him to the word they were trying to stay in a previous dispensation the prophet of god has brought jesus christ back to the earth again the seventh seal brings him back to the earth amen and and he showed us a manifestation of christ and he said some things and shared some things with us amen that they were mind-boggling the christians in that day he talked to talking about theophanies and how the theophany worked and hearing from your theophany and all of a sudden you're like where does the bible say that i can hear from my theophany but i believe it with all of my heart that i have heard from my theophany then i have representation of heaven and when i heard when i heard the eagle scream i recognized that this is eagle food and i left the others i heard from my theophany i hope you don't question that i hope that doesn't stumble you because a vindicated prophet of god taught it as a truth out of god's word but mr skeptic will try to rob our faith by bringing questions about could it be wrong what could it be an opinion is it possible i say god help me to turn a deaf fear to mr skeptic and just believe your word mr impatient mr impatient this is a nasty one brother bram said he's a rascal mr impatience says i believed and it didn't work that statement doesn't work i believed and it didn't work means you didn't believe to say i believed in healing but it didn't work i believed god delivered me and it didn't work i believe it just means you didn't believe or you only had an intellectual faith but you didn't have the faith of god because the faith of god is faith in his word and it doesn't fail i believed and it didn't work and then you realize that there's no time limit to the promise god never put a time limit to the promise don't let mr and patient put a time limit on the promise in you if you've been praying for the salvation of your loved ones you've been praying for your healing you've been praying for your deliverance do not let mr impatient put up a time limit on god's promise or the ability for god to answer your prayer hey god can answer your prayer after you leave this earth amen but god will still honor his word you may not even see the effect of your prayers you may not even see the effect of your faith in god's word but don't you let mr impatient rob you of your blessing amen don't let him take the word out of your heart just because you haven't seen it in 10 years you haven't seen it in 20 years you haven't seen it in 40 years don't let mr and patient whisper in your ear for there is no time limit to the word of god there is no time limit to the promise god keeps his word [Music] the word is eternal so you can't put a time limit on it true faith is eternal [Music] when these two things come together it's going to happen it may not happen tomorrow may not happen the next day it may not happen and you're in my lifetime but it will happen so to say i believe and i waited for months or years and it never happened just means you didn't believe with the right kind of belief because the the right kind of believe can never stop believing it'll believe all the way through to the fulfillment of the promise now brother bam says in the message court trial we're coming back to this court trial now the defense witness wants to call a few witnesses to the platform would we have time to do it the defense witness wants to call a witness now his witness is a prosecuting attorney called his witness the defense witness shall call first the prophet noah and let him witness and so noah takes the stand and says but noah said god told me it was going to rain and i believed it i believe if god said so he is able to put water up there so i pounded away mr unbelief scoffed at me mr skeptic doubted me mr impatient i pounded away till i built the ark every day they came by and said well i guess it's going to rain today see same way i thought you was well i thought you was going to get well where is the rain at you know after all prophet noah as you supposed to be one you said that now remember them's not that's people that's pretending they are believers he's talking about those that were scoffing and mocking at noah they were pretending to be believers they were part of the church well the prophet noah i'm sorry they pretended they were believers no mr unbelief mr skeptic and those are they play they play claim they're believers well the prophet noah we always knowed you as a false prophet because you got foolish ideas that don't cope with science it don't cope with the modern trend you you don't cope with our pastors there's something wrong we know that you're not really a prophet but you said it was going to rain that was a month ago no rain yet two years past hey hey prophet i thought you said that god said so he did say so well two years had passed five years 20 years 50 years the ark is completed listen noah did not have to debate with mr unbeliever mr skeptic he didn't have to debate with mr impatient they kept coming around mocking questioning him saying why hasn't it happened you said it would happen he didn't debate his testimony wasn't a rebuttal his testimony was taking place behind him in the building of the ark his witness was what he did with his faith when he turned around and they were coming up to him and they were saying you're all wrong there's no rain and science says they shot an instrument to the moon there's no rain up there and while they're talking to them he's planing another board and they're waiting for a rebuttal you know the devil loves for you to give him a comeback he loves we spend all of our time thinking oh if i was quicker i would have said that and i would have said this and that's what the devil wants he wants you to get a little quicker and just bring me a comeback because he's got more comebacks than you got comebacks but noah just turned around and noah didn't even have to say i believe it planing the board was testifying that he believed it you're going to say i believe the message no just obeying the message proves that you believe the message just just believing what god said living the way that that the prophet told us to live doing the things that he taught us to do when he shared with us what was in the back part of god's mind and told us how a bride member should behave themselves dress themselves conduct themselves when you take that and you turn around and put it into a life you witness to mr unbeliever you're witnessing the mr skeptic you're witnessing to mr impatient that you believe that this message is true so noah's testimony was not just what he preached but his testimony that was the ark that was taking shape behind him year after year you take your wife by the hand you grab your children and you come to church to hear the word of god year after year you start a new message book when you finish the one before year after year you play the tape on the way to church and on the way back year after year you constantly are adjusting your life to match what god's showing you out of the word of god year after year you're making these little adjustments on oh no that's not pleasing to the lord oh i see what the prophet's saying now and you're understanding the nature of god better and you're lining it year after year you're playing another tape you're going to another serve you're having another discussion with your family amen you're dressing the way the prophet said talking like the prophet said and it's a witness against mr unbeliever that this message is true and that you believe it see they were watching for some great something to prove noah was right the great something that would prove that was right was too late for their repentance no one was right noah believed he was right knows what the word and his witness was taking shape behind him five years 20 years 50 years the ark is completed noah was sitting in the door here comes mr scoffer mr unbeliever mr skeptic mr impatient well now where is the rain god said it was going to rain he didn't say when he said it was going to rain he didn't say when he just said it's going to rain get an ark you'll be safe inside him it's going to rain he didn't say when it was going to rain he said it's going to rain and i built the ark well it looks to me like if you built the ark and you've done your part god will do his part he will but he didn't say when he would do it he just said it's going to do it it's going to rain can you imagine that conversation no testimony for years there's an oncoming rain there's an ark of safety coming rain arc of safety and his actions proved that he believed what he was preaching but what happened when it was all done how many days was it completed and noah was sitting there thinking you know i don't know what to do next i've only done what he told me to do and mr scoffer mister impatience they begin they begin the same ridicule over and over oh the ark's done where's the rain you told us to build the ark because of the rain the ark's built where's the rain noah had to be a believer amen god was going to test whether he was a believer he had to prove that he was a believer he had to stay with the word of god regardless of even what his own thinking was no doubt noah thought when he nailed the last board in and the last pitch cured he probably thought that moment it was time amen but noah had to go beyond even his own idea about the way god would do it and when god did it a different way than his idea he had to stay with the word of god and say it doesn't matter it's going to rain if it had been another 120 years it was still going to rain all right he says your past to 119 years and just lacked about seven days in being 120 years mr unbelief mr scoffer all these others were saying mr skeptic rather mr impatient they all made fun of me and everything i said was crazy to believe such a rational promise is that that if god did promise me that he told something that wasn't true and he wasn't able to back up what he said but i believed god and held steady there you are i believed i held steady remember noah is on the witness stand he's witnessing this is his testimony and you know one day they came up to laugh at me and the door was shut they said well the old fanatic went out there and shut the door i suppose but i heard them but i told them god shut the door no doubt that the rain will fall today that'll be it the first day passed by there was no rain then they really scoffed at me telling god shut the door i don't believe such stuff as that noah shut the door himself him and his son see scoffer unbeliever skeptic all right it went on for a while but on may the 17th one morning it rained and it absolutely destroyed all those people that was put to a test against the word of god and saved those who believed god and made preparation for it and then noah steps down off the stand said now the defense witness now will call the second witness he calls abraham abraham said i was just an ordinary man a believer and god spoke to me by his word and said one day that i'd have a child by sarah sarah was 65 and i was 75. i married her when she was about 16 years old she was my half sister and she was sterile and i was she was barren and i was sterile so there was no way for us to have this child and so we went on for years but god promised it and we went down and got all the bird eye and the pins and everything got ready for the baby and made the little booties and the first month passed by i said sarah remember she was about 20 years past menopause said now sarah is there any difference this last these last 28 days no no difference well i know we was going to have the baby anyhow and we went on and on year after year and i still believe god mr unbeliever mr skeptic mr impatient tried their best to get away they tried to tell me i was wrong why abraham you was a successful farmer you were a fine man everybody thought of you but you went off on the deep end you are believing something that can't be true it's unscientific for an old man like you and an old woman like sarah to have a baby but i believed god anyhow it was 25 years later he didn't tell me when i was going to have that baby but he said i would have it and i believed god and counted anything that was contrary as though it was not and then abraham stepped down off the stand he said let's call another witness right quick isaiah the prophet let's ask him something why he said the lord spoke to me one day in a prophecy i was a prophet everybody know that i that what i said the lord honored and they all believed me as a prophet and one day there comes something rational and it said a virgin shall conceive now that was unusual then isaiah steps off the the stand and the defense witness calls another one he says quickly let's call another one let's call moses and everybody laughed at me because i was right then 80 years old i had a white beard hanging way down like this and i had my wife sitting on a mule and the little gershom on her side and i was going down to egypt and my ass set towards heaven and this old crooked stick in my hand i was going down to take over a one-man invasion and the thing of it was he did it that's right he did it with a crooked stick where he couldn't do it with an army but god said so that settled it i'm just pulling excerpts then moses steps off the stand he said let's just grab another witness right quick before we leave let's pull up joshua here joshua said moses took one out of every tribe every denomination and he sent us over to spy out the land and when we got there at the river and looked across there and seen those amalekites and the amorites perizzites and what more said they were giants the people screamed out for fear well we can't do that and and brother bam goes one after one in this trial and he brings them up and they begin to testify of they withstood mr skeptic they withstood mr unbelief they were stood mister in patient and every one of them had their trial moses had his trial uh joshua had his testing amen when the spies went across they were all part of the church they were all part of the same church amen and 12 of them went across they all saw the same thing they had all heard the same promise when they went across the land they all saw the same thing and they come back with two different reports the majority of the church says we can't take it two joshua and caleb said if god is with us we're more than able to take it they're but bred for us they saw the same thing they testified when they come back they all had the same testimony there's walled cities there's giants there's fruit there's milk and honey it's everything that he said they all they all saw the same thing the ten that were afraid didn't see something different than joshua and caleb saw but joshua and caleb believed the word of god that was the difference and when they come back with skepticism and unbelief amen when they come back with all of that amen joshua and caleb they took their stand on the word of god and believed that they were more than able to take him moses took a stand isaiah took a stand micaiah took a step all the way down through one could come up and testify one after another after another after another that the word of god worked amen amen the the the devil came he tempted me with unbelief tempted me with time tempted me with skepticism but the word always held true remember when brother bram starts this trial he starts with the prosecutor which is satan making an accusation against god that he doesn't keep his word and he brought three witnesses and he brought three examples out of the bible and three witnesses but the defense witness comes the holy ghost with witnesses and he's got a string of them coming moses amen he brings elijah he can bring isaiah he can bring joshua he can bring caleb he can bring david he can bring solomon and every one of them could testify the same thing that the word works amen the promise of god is true it was put to the test in my life i stood with the word and the word worked the promise of god was true amen i failed i messed up i didn't always get it right but his word was always true and what he promised always came to pass [Music] and brother branham goes down in this service and he finally comes to this part this thrilled my heart he said now it's getting late now just let me have one more witness brother branham he's the one moderating this he's telling the story he's telling you you know the the prosecutor satan his witnesses their story now the defense witness the holy ghost he's calling all these and he's building and he's building and he said we're out of time we've got time for just one more witness can we can we have one more witness he said i got a dozen wrote down here we could call a hundred or two but let me just call one more said if you'll pardon me may i be that witness [Music] the congregation says amen he said i'd like to take the stand for him that lays them back there this is here now he said he's talking about those that were back there moses and elijah that lays them back there this is here now and now that would be their testimony but me let me take the witness stand once i'd like to say i want to take the stand would you like to take the stand if if if there's room for one more who wants to take the stand amen we got volunteers who would like to stand for him who would like to give their testimony who would like to be able to stand in his defense that this word works amen i mean the word works under every circumstance under every condition amen even in my failure god kept his promise amen even in my backslidings god kept his promise this word is true this message is true what the prophet taught is nothing but the truth listen friends hattie wright can take the stand hattie wright was sitting there one day in her parents home listening to a story that was unbelievable unless you're a believer how a man in the woods heard a voice and that voice told him that he could create that he could ask for something and it would be given to him and he's having a conversation with an invisible voice and that invisible voice is god almighty telling him as a sin born human being telling him that he could he could speak and request anything and god would back up his words and he's telling the story and he's relating the story and and he's talking about you know i said well he says what should i ask for he says well you're hunting well you have need of and and brother baby says well a squirrels he said how many do you want listen this pre we have to sometimes go back and erase so much of our minds for us this is not a complicated story and that day that was a complicated story and there's a man just in a little poor house and a little poor table with a group of little poor people telling about a conversation that god is having with his prophet and his prophet is dressed in like hunting clothes and he's saying i said well i'll take one and in that tree and we'll have one over here and then and he says but you said three and he says oh well we'll take one and he said i wanted to make it hard it made it run across the field and go up into a locust tree amen because there's never a squirrel in the locust tree or whatever it was and so he made it real hard and he said and it happened exactly the way he said this squirrel appeared here that squirrel appeared here the other one ran down and came from this direction and went up in that spot and he shot it and he's telling this story to this group of humble people and this little humble woman amen she she said brother brenham that ain't nothing but the truth listen i i i hope that you can catch this in the gravity that it hits my heart she didn't have any scripture to say that a man will create squirrels in the end time she didn't have anything to check that story with she only thinks she could check it with was the faith she had in her heart that he's telling me the truth she can't verify it by eyewitnesses they didn't have a video of the event how was she going to verify this but when she said that's nothing but the truth brother branham brother branham said the power of god came down at that table and told him to stand to his feet he stood to his feet and said give her what she wants said sister hattie god told me to give you whatever you want listen whatever you want once it was spoken it was too late to retract amen that woman could have asked for anything she wanted if she wanted another world she could have had another world a million dollars a healing of her sister she could have anything she wanted amen but the kind of person who had the right kind of faith to believe what this prophet was saying god knew would ask for the right thing he knew it was in her heart the most valuable thing in her heart was salvation was eternal life she didn't want the temporal thing she wanted the eternal things why because she was a child of god she was a believer god stood a prophet on his feet and said give her whatever she wants and she was given and brother ram's trying to help her you know you need this and you're poor and you take care of your mom and dad and your sister but all she wanted she goes my greatest desire in my heart is to see the salvation of my two boys and god gave her what she asked for i don't know this is just as far as i know i don't know much but i don't know anybody else in the history of mankind that i know of that was given the right to ask for anything that they wanted and guaranteed that they would get it brother branham went through that and had he right and i'd say what hattie wright said pleased god that's what brother branham said that plea what she said pleased god all of this skepticism that's floating around the message is not pleasing god all of this trying to prove something and all of this it doesn't please god but what pleases god is somebody who believes the word of god and somebody who will turn around and live what they believe to demonstrate it and say this message is to where else will we go where else would we go thou alone have the words of eternal life where else will we go where else will we turn what else would we believe where else can we go i have to accept god's mouthpiece for me because this is what brought the truth in this day i have to believe it i have to accept it what else can i do where else can i go [Applause] we have time for one more if you pardon me may i be that witness when he said that when i was reading this my heart just nearly exploded i said oh praise god let me be that witness if there's going to be a last one to testify let me be that don't get through without my testimony don't move through the case without my witness and i tell you friends this case is not going to be finished until you've given your testimony until you've given your witness because the bride overcomes all those who overcome satan overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony don't worry you got your chance you've got your chance right now amen this whole world is under trial the court case is taking place now amen you've got your chance stand on the witness booth and testify amen testify by your words testify by your deeds testify by your lives testify that this word is the truth this message is right and god didn't lie he didn't send us something false he sent us his word brother bannon goes on to say then in the same message he's praying he said you you are your mind is the jury and your action is your judge the way you judge whether this word is true or not is by your action now bow your heads just a moment he begins to pray lord jesus the trial hasn't started how many more could we call up here on the platform if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover you said the works that i do shall you do also the woman touched her garment you turned and told her what had happened and you keep all your words there is none of them wrong the wrong is in the unbeliever lord mr unbeliever he's the one that contaminates the person mr skeptic and that impatient one that can't wait upon the lord and yet call himself the seat of abraham oh holy spirit the defense witness you know who has faith and who don't i say god i'm thankful that i get a chance to testify that i get a chance to witness i i listened to what brother bran was saying in the trial and we went all through it and when he got to this part if we could have just one more do you pardon me if i could take the stand is it all right could i be that final witness and i something in my heart says no let me have my turn don't end the case i want to testify because i was raised in denominationalism i thought i knew god i thought i believed the truth i thought i was a good boy i thought i had what was right but the voice of god in my day resurrected me out of dead denominations and woke me up to who god really is what i had believed in was not the real god of the word i was stuck i was shrouded in darkness i was every bit just like lazarus wound up in grave clothes and behind a big old rock keeping me from christ but the voice of the resurrection came in my day and i heard that voice and that voice called my name just as deliberate as he called lazarus out of that grave he called chad lamb out of dead denominationalism and brought me back into the life i was always meant to be in i want to stand as a witness i want to testify let my life testify let my actions testify that i believe this word is true that this message is christ let everything i do testify that this word is true i was i was a a pentecostal boy raised pentecostal all my life went to church i i was probably a week or two old when i went to church and probably never missed more than two weeks worth of services my entire life my my there's a string of pentecostal preachers in my family that go all the way back to azusa street my grandpa was a preacher my great uncle was my pastor i mean we had it on both sides and i thought that i was right i thought that i was in a truth and i thought that i knew the bible but you know i had no ability to live a righteous life i was living a hypocritical life i wanted to be good but had no power to live good i wanted to be a christian i wanted to be holy i wanted to be clean but i could not make myself clean and the word that i was given was not producing a holy life it was producing a hypocritical life but then one day i heard a voice it was a voice from the other side of that rock said roll the stone away and loose him let him out of his grave clothes he's all bound up in denominational teaching he's all bound up in wrong understanding let him loose and let him live amen that's my sign and there's something that took place there was an experience that took place that changed me forever and it was no longer trying desperately to live good and hope that i'd be all right but something in me changed and this word came into me and there was another life that come into me and now what i wanted more than anything and all my desire was to please him and to serve him the power of the holy ghost came to be a witness and that witness came to make me a witness and we found that the word of god is true that this message is true within it is the power of transformation to take us from church members to bride i'd say i'd like to testify to you tonight or to this morning it may be tonight by the time i'm done but this message still has the power of transformation because it's the word of god in this message that that's being preached that the prophet of god gave us in this day this message has the power to take you from a church member sitting in your seat right now to the bride of jesus christ this this message has the power to transform you into the bride of jesus christ don't stay a church member amen receive this word become one with it feed on it take it into you become one with this message amen the message is to be taken in amen it's not to be talked about it's to be lived [Music] praise god i want to be a witness but it's not about even wanting to be a witness i've been called to be a witness because revelations 12 is taking place it'll come to its fullness the bride goes up word by word when the bride is translated as a whole satan is cast out and heaven rejoices it's because of our testimony our witness each one of us are having the privilege of standing in the witness booth what are we witnessing in the witness booth what is our testimony what do we believe what is true what can we say when mr unbeliever comes in what do you have to say this is my question as we we finished this morning when mr unbelief comes to you what do you have to say when mr skeptic comes to you not a brother or sister not somewhere else but when mr skeptic comes to you what do you have to say when mr impatient comes to you what do you have to say amen because we're here testifying our life is a witness that this message is the truth amen and god has called us to be that witness he sent his holy ghost to give us the power to be witnesses and i want to testify that this was the only way for me tried religion didn't work tried willpower it failed but this word is the power of transformation and it was the thing that worked for me we could go on with testimony after testimony after testimony but we're testifying in satan's eden remember when brother bam starts this court trial he says the prosecutor brought the case the prosecutor is bringing the case trying to discredit god's word the prosecutor is bringing it trying to bring a discredit bringing witnesses and and talking of the scriptures amen but the holy ghost has a chance as a defense witness and the defense witness is calling on you to take the stand how many of you want to take the stand and say this word is the truth i can testify it's the truth i can testify that what that prophet said is nothing but the truth it's been true every way he said it it's been true in every part of my life it's true and when mr impatient comes and says we'll still wait about this what about this and what about that mr skeptic comes you say you go go talk to somebody else i already believe it [Music] but what about it's been month you go talk to somebody else i already believe it but what about this discrepancy the prophet said this one way here and he said it this one way the other way you say mr skeptic go talk to somebody else i already believe it it's already true amen let's all stand musicians if you can come brother branham says in the fourth seal he said notice now he will be given a heart of a beast at that time and satan will incarnate himself because when the church goes up satan's cast out see it's done then all of his accusing is done there's coming a time where the testimony of the bride will be the finishing of the accusation of the devil he'll be done accusing because there's a bride that'll stand in full faith in the full word of god with no more unbelief and her life will reflect the very life of jesus christ and her testimony her testimony will stop the mouth of the accuser she'll go up he'll be cast out all of his accusing will be over friends that's what we've been called to say lord help us to take your word and stand with that word regardless of what happens around us not as a group as an individual this is not a group prayer although i want it for everybody that's in here i would desire for every one of us but that's not the age we live in it's the individual age it's time for the individual to be called with an individual experience and have an individual revelation and now as individuals you've been called to witness in the witness stand amen what will you witness what will your testimony be what will you have to say amen what has this message done for you what has it brought you to what is christ done inside of you through you what is our testimony because the bride will have the final testimony for the gentile dispensation and i want to give a true testimony let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father for your word god it means so much to us lord in this day that we live god to see the witnesses that have gone before lord to hear your prophet talk about noah and his day and moses in his day jeremiah in his day in isaiah the day that he lived in joshua but god this isn't that day this is a day that you've called us as individuals to take our time to stand our test to give our witness and lord we desire with all of our hearts to give a true witness but it's going to take the spirit of truth to give us the power to be a true witness i pray god that you would fill your children with your spirit lord that you would pour it out upon us lord that would receive the power to be true witnesses in this day and then we'll be witnesses here and abroad and wherever you should lead us lord that we could witness that this gospel is the truth that this there is a bride upon the earth that will take you at your word and that word will be fulfilled god we thank you for all you've done for us we thank you for that prophet that you sent in this day that wanted to be the one to take the stand on that day he said can i take the stand and he could go on and testify for days and for weeks of what he saw you do but god that wasn't the last testimony that you wanted on this earth for you called out a bride and you called me you called my brothers and sisters god of that prophet of god was desiring to take the stand how much should we desire to take the stand for you lord i want to stand in this day lord having believed your word lord let it let the word lord become manifest in my life make the power of transformation to transform me into a bride transform me into the image that you had before the foundation of the world and give me the power to be that true witness of what the whole message was about in this day bring me lord to that picture to that image to that manifestation for i'm yielding to you and believing you let our lives give a true testimony a true witness that this word is the truth and god i pray that you'd put inside of us an eagerness like the prophet had to take the stand to tell of how true your word is and the face of skeptics it's true and the face of unbelievers it's true and the face of those who are impatient it's true lord your word is true we're so thankful for the privilege of being your witnesses in this end time may you empower us and equip us god i ask if there's anybody here lord that is afraid to take the stand is not sure of their testimony doesn't know for sure what they would say there's anybody here that would be a little reluctant to stand on that stand i pray god that you would just energize him now and fill him with your spirit god bring them to a desire where they would open themselves to you and say god i need something more i'm a little intimidated by the witnessing stand i need something from you i need your spirit to give me that power god i pray that you would grant it to all that are asking now anyone lord i just pray you put them in them so that they would have the boldness that peter had on the day of pentecost when he rushed out and said this is that that the prophet joel had said i am convinced and know that this is the word being manifest in our day i pray you'd make it a reality in all of our lives lord bless your people bless us as we leave here may we go with our testimony intact may we wave our testimony as we go in our lives and in our speech and in our conduct that we might testify that the word is nothing but the truth that the message you've given us is nothing but the truth and may that please you like it did when hattie wright said it that day we love you father we ask your blessings upon all that was said may you accomplish in us what you desire to in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless your friends brother ben we have over [Music] by the blood of the land [Music] oh we [Music]
