[0:00] how wonderful is our God how merciful is
[0:03] our God he saw that abimelech was not
[0:06] intending to do evil abimelech was
[0:08] following the law of conscience which
[0:10] matched the law in heaven and God knew
[0:12] that he was righteous and it was
[0:14] Abraham's fault not a beam elect so he
[0:17] comes to abimelech a non-seed
[0:19] non-abraham non-royal seed and warns him
[0:22] so that he won't
[0:24] fall into sin
[0:29] what Bible was abimelech reading
[0:33] he had the law of conscience and by
[0:36] Nature he was doing that which was
[0:37] written in the law and God had mercy on
[0:40] him
[0:41] he was already under a curse because God
[0:44] had shut fast the wounds
[0:46] of the of the servants and of his wife
[0:49] but God said have Abraham pray for you
[0:53] unless he pray for your dead you can see
[0:56] what a difference there is between
[0:57] Abraham and abimelech
[1:00] there's a huge difference between
[1:01] Abraham and abimelech but because
[1:03] abimelech was holding true to that
[1:06] portion of the word that he had God
[1:08] honored abimelech and God protected
[1:12] abimelech
[1:14] God never even condemned Abraham and
[1:16] Abraham was one Abraham was so much
[1:18] further away he was so much in a
[1:21] different position with God than Obama
[1:22] like but God's still honored of being
[1:24] let because abimelech was honoring God
[1:28] I love this Bible
[1:30] I love the God of this Bible and tell me
[1:34] where anywhere else on the earth that
[1:36] there is a there is a Ministry a message
[1:38] a teaching that will teach the god of
[1:40] the Bible the way he's actually written
[1:42] in the Bible with all the mercy and all
[1:45] the grace and all the opportunities he
[1:47] gives the different ones and different
[1:48] categories I'm telling you this Prophet
[1:51] was a prophet of God he knew more than
[1:53] the letter he could go to the heart of
[1:55] God bring the nature of God out and show
[1:57] it through this Bible
[2:00] and when he gets to the white Throne
[2:02] judgment I mean everybody else will say
[2:04] either you confess Jesus Christ as your
[2:06] savior you're in or you're out but this
[2:08] one comes and said these may not have
[2:10] confessed Jesus Christ their savior
[2:12] they're they're brought in solely on the
[2:14] fact that they honored the word when the
[2:16] word was presented to them
[2:17] where was it presented it was presented
[2:19] in the brethren in a body of Flesh
[2:21] manifesting the word and when they
[2:23] honored that God honored them
[2:27] because God judges by his word
[2:31] he judges the Jews by the word there was
[2:33] a portion he kept them from
[2:36] so he judged him on the portion that was
[2:38] open
[2:40] the foolish virgin could not receive
[2:42] revelation
[2:44] so what was commonly open and understood
[2:47] on a surface level when they would honor
[2:49] that and live true to that God would
[2:51] honor them
[2:52] as long as they didn't reject the truth
[2:54] as long as they didn't call it heresy as
[2:57] long as they didn't call it doctrine of
[2:58] devils as long as they as long as they
[3:00] just stayed in the portion that was open
[3:02] and stayed true to it God would honor
[3:04] them
