lord we can't do it ourselves we're here because we want to see you we've come tonight because we want to hear your voice lord god we've done all that we know to do in preparation to make our way here to prepare our hearts to repent to lay before you lord and ask that now you would come and do the part we can't do ourselves may you give us the ice have to see and the ears to hear god may you reveal yourself to us in a greater way than ever before may we see you lord unveiled before us as you continue to unfold that revelation lord i pray you would take preeminence and speak your word through these lips that you would have absolute and utter control lord may we be yielded completely to you god and may you do what you've intended to do this night may we go from here strengthen lord and maybe go from here illuminated and we go back out into the world as bright and shining lights to shine forth the glory of this gospel we ask that you bless all we say and do for your glory in jesus name we pray amen and while you're standing let's turn to first corinthians chapter eight and uh i heard it was announced to remind everybody of the um celebration of life ceremony for brother john matthews so everybody's invited and welcome to come at 10 30 on saturday and it's going to be a busy week and we also have the youth camp out this weekend so the youth will be doing that but a crowd will be ministering there so be in prayer for them and for everybody who's involved with the celebration of life as well and pray for the family amen let's read here in first corinthians chapter 8 verse 2 if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know but if any man love god the same is known of him praise god let's be seated you may be seated this i wanted to start with the scripture because it means a lot to me i want to go into part two of what we were talking about on sunday and so there'll be just a little bit maybe a little bit of review but some things that i just have in my heart to go into and like i said don't wait for something new because this is just review of things we've been talking about for the last several years but i realized that these are things that i want to see better amen that i don't believe that i've come to the end of the unveiling of god and that there's no more to see but i want to see more amen and and this scripture means a lot to me because if you think if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know i think it's a good thing for us to remember that whatever we know we don't know it like we ought to know it amen there's always more to know so when we go back over things and we review them again it's constantly unfolding itself and and so we want to see it more clearly so brother branham said in christ is the mystery of god revealed he said look what was once god's great secret great mysterious secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer that is the body of christ what was god's once great secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest think of it see oh my i'm sure we don't we don't get it well i can't see it the way i ought to and i'm sure you don't that's the truth how many can say amen now brother brennaman's in christ is the mystery of god revealed and he's revealing the great mystery of god and christ is the mystery of god revealed and and he's he's revealing he's speaking of that great mystery that lays under the seven seals and he comes to it and he says now what was the great mysterious secret that was in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believers that is the body of christ so brother venom saying what was once the great mysterious secret in god's mind has now been put into the heart of the believers in the body of christ and then he comes and says well i know you don't see it frankly i don't well he said i don't see it like i ought to and i'm sure you don't see it he says it's already been transferred into the believers but you don't see it like you ought to and so you can receive this great mystery but it doesn't mean we see it like we ought to i think there's more that we can see amen so the one thing i want to come to a realization on as we keep looking at these things and ministering these things as the lord leads us is that we don't ever want to assume that we've come to the end of the understanding of all the things that god has unveiled for us amen they've all been given but i don't think we've come to the end of the unveiling of all things that's been given and i think he's continually unveiling himself amen so there's so much more to see again in god hiding himself in simplicity than revealing himself in the same he said then and watch what he'd done he preached such a mighty christ coming he's speaking of john the baptist he's got his fan in his hand and his fanning his way i mean he will thoroughly purge his floors he will take up the trash and sweep it out yonder and burn it that's right he will gather up the grain and take it into the garner see he was inspired but when jesus come they was looking for and all the apostles you know they they was looking for a great something to come my my boy he's coming that's all there is to it boy he will be mighty he will kick them romans off the face of the earth he will make them greeks go this way and romans go go that when he come when he come a little humble fellow being pushed around from one side to the other what was it god hiding himself in simplicity so we talked about this last time but i want to keep speaking on that when john the baptist amen when he came we we talked about the prophecies before that was laying in isaiah 40 and malachi 3 and in malachi 4 of his coming and when he come to fulfill that the fulfillment didn't match the intellectual understanding or the or the intellectual interpretation of what you could physically read in the prophecy because by physical reading you would come up with the wrong picture but when god amen manifested amen only those with the seed on the inside could receive it amen because it wasn't by intellectual putting the pieces together it was by the holy ghost revealing the truth amen so now he's here speaking he's a forerunner and he's speaking of the thing that he's forerunning and the thing that he's forerunning amen is the coming of the lord and as he's speaking of it he's describing him as well there's one coming after me i'm not that one but there's one coming after me whose shoe latches i'm not worthy done loose and this fan is in his hand and he'll thoroughly purge the threshing floor amen and he'll burn the shaft and he'll gather the wheat into the garners so you can imagine standing that that that day standing there all around john hearing him on the banks of jordan preached this they would get an image in their mind of what this coming christ would be like they would imagine amen a man who who who john in his greatest john innocence the powerful of a preacher as he is amen he's not worthy to unloose unlatch the buckle of his shoes and he says he's got his his fan and his handle thoroughly purge the threshing floor and burn the chaff and gather the wheat into the garner and i can imagine their hearts would burn at this description of such a mighty such a mighty one coming amen such a victorious one but when jesus come and entered his ministry it was nothing like what they imagined the imagination of what john said and the interpretation and when it come to manifestation they couldn't match intellectually that's why the disciples that would follow jesus they couldn't even really put two and two together and get four because they didn't even understand what was going on or what he was saying amen it was later i mean after the baptism of the holy ghost when they were able to start putting the scriptures together to what they had seen and what they had heard but at that time they didn't even understand some of the things that jesus was saying they couldn't even comprehend when he would begin to say unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no part with me and brother said they had no idea what he meant by that but you know what the carnal understanding of that is eating flesh and drinking blood but we know it was spiritually manifest amen they come into a spiritual fulfillment of that prophecy and so they wouldn't understand it till later but because just because they didn't understand it didn't mean that they didn't recognize this was the christ because he looked at his disciples when so many went away he said well you go also and peter says where shall we go thou alone has the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art christ the son of the living god he had that much revelation given from the father and he couldn't move off that revelation even though the other things that he was hearing he was not able to explain he wasn't able to place them didn't understand how it would happen and when you know can you imagine the disciples having to face their family who were there that day when jesus said unless you eat my flesh or drink my blood you have no part can you imagine trying to answer that question amen and when they when they come to them and says what does he mean by what does he mean by eat flesh and drink his blood you heard you heard the same thing i heard peter andrew you heard what i heard that man said that we got to eat his flesh and drink his blood now what does that mean can you imagine peter he has no answer amen he cannot tell him what it means amen he would find out later later by revelation he would be able to tell him what the fulfillment of that was but in that day he couldn't tell him what that was and i could imagine maybe he would stutter a little bit and get read in the face and say i don't know and say how can you follow a man like that that says things like that he says i don't know i mean don't what do you think he meant i don't know are you really going to eat his flesh and drink his blood i don't know but i know one thing that that's the christ the son of the living god i know one thing that he alone has the words of eternal life i can't answer your question i can't explain it i can't put the pieces together it's beyond my comprehension right now but i know that that man has the words of eternal life so we see in god hiding himself in simplicity that even john when john would come and speak of jesus in an intellectual mind would form a picture of what this great one must be like and when we sung this song you know open our eyes i want to see jesus amen the question is what are you looking for what do you expect to see amen when you say i want to see jesus when you talk to that to in a denominational setting people are looking to see a physical form and nail prints and a beard and long hair in a robe amen but but i hope that we've gone beyond that when we sing i want to see jesus that we're not looking for the physical image or the nail scarred hands but we're looking for the word made manifest [Applause] so when we sing the song what do we mean by the song what are we looking for because if we don't know what we're looking for amen we don't know what we see i was meditating today and i just was thinking i was praying and i said god help us to see what we're looking at help us to see what we're looking at we're looking at it but help us to see it amen and and you know how is it that you can pray a prayer like that because it's happened to me time and time and time again in the message i'll look at something and look at something and look at something and read it and read it and read it then all of a sudden i see it so i can continue to pray god help us to see what we're looking at because you've given it to us for for us to look at it to read it amen to ponder over but it takes god amen to bring a revelation a divine revelation from the father to help us to see what we're looking at they were looking at jesus but they didn't see him they were looking at the christ they were looking at the word made flesh they were looking at the manifestation for their day but they didn't see it they were hearing the words that came from his voice but they didn't hear him so you can have hearing and not hear and you can see and not see but but i say god let us see what we're looking at let's go to matthew chapter 11. matthew chapter 11 verse 1. we're going to read here about john john is the one who was the forerunning of the messiah he is the one who saw the dove descend upon the lamb he's the one who saw the sign and declared that this is the lamb of god he's the one the next day who pointed out and said behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sin of the world and two of his disciples left and begin to follow jesus this is the same one that said behold his fan is in his hand he just thoroughly purged the threshing floor he's the one who says there's one among you this is the same one and we get in here to matthew chapter 11 verse 1 and it says and it came to pass when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities now when john had heard in in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples and he said unto him art thou he that shall come or do we look for another art thou he that should come or do we look for another this was john who announced as a coming it was john who announced his arrival it was john who declared that this was the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world it was john who said there's one among you it was john who saw the sign this is the same individual and now he's in prison and he's sent two disciples to ask a question are thou he that should come or do we look for another jesus answered and said unto them go and show john again those things which you do hear and see the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me this is the key john john now had a question and he says two disciples to ask the question are you the one that should come or do we look for another and and jesus could have got all kinds of upset and said you're the one who saw the sign amen you were there when the holy ghost descended like a dove you heard the voice amen what do you mean am i the one or do i look for another and you realize that even john's prophecy what he said was coming and what he saw didn't even match in his own intellectual understanding even john amen the forerunner had a certain expectation and his expectation uh when he would begin to say what he was saying he had an expectation and even jesus may not have met john's expectation i hope you don't think i'm stretching too far when saying that because those are the things the prophet of god told us he said his eagle eye began to film over in prison and he began to question and begin to wonder but jesus took him back to the fulfillment of the word amen and he says he didn't say no i'm him he said go tell john i'm the one and go remind him of of what go remind him of what he saw and what he said no he says go tell him amen all of the prophecies are being fulfilled everything that it said i would do i'm doing. so go back and give him the word amen go back and tell him show him the manifestation of the word or the fulfillment of the word and then say this blessed is he who's not ashamed in me blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended i'm sorry offended in me and what the brother brethren was telling us amen what he's telling us in a message the uh what did he say the forgotten beatitude i believe that's what it was because blessed is so all the beatitudes are blessed is the meek and blessed is this but here we come later after the sermon on the mount said blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and brother branham called this the lost beatitude and that is don't be offended in the way he comes amen don't be offended in the manifestation of the word there's a prophecy and a manifestation just because the manifestation doesn't match your intellectual understanding of the prophecy don't be offended in him don't be offended in him just because it doesn't match just because you can't make it match don't be offended in him but what did he show john the fulfillment of the word the manifestation of the prophecies go tell him that and tell him not to be offended in me malachi 4. let's turn back just a little bit to malachi chapter 4. now i told you we're going to continue on with sunday but i don't remember giving you the title again it was the unexpected fulfillment the unexpected fulfillment that's what john was dealing with the fulfillment was not what he expected his expectation didn't match the fulfillment so god had to bring him back to the word christ had to bring him back to what what are you one are you come for are you another and you know jesus didn't answer his question i just i love this jesus rarely answers a question usually he asks another question and so what he's trying to do is you know we've got to get beyond the notion that jesus came for everyone he came for his father's sheep he came for a sheep the lost sheep that's who he came for and in coming for them he redeemed everything and in redeeming back everything now there we there will be rewards given to more than just the sheep that's his mercy but but he was he comes and he doesn't say hey i'm him i'm the one i'm this and i'm that and let me tie it all together for you no he just demonstrated the word he just manifest the word and he let the spirit of god amen call out the sheep he was there to find the sheep but how did he find the sheep by manifesting the word and the manifestation of the word for their day is what caught the seed for that day and so when john comes and asks a question he doesn't slip him a note and say john you remember this and you remember that amen remember i mean no he said go tell john amen the lame walk the deaf hear the gospels preached to the poor go tell him this is the manifestation of the promise because that's that's what opens the eyes of the sheep of god's children the manifest the manifested word so when we come here to malachi 4 let's just read it verse 5 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse as we said sunday people have been reading their bibles now for hundreds and hundreds of years and and there's hundreds of years of reading the bible they've had they've come across this verse and there's all kinds of interpretations of how this will be fulfilled but god interprets his word by bringing it to pass and when god has brought this to pass in our day he brings it to pass and a fulfillment of the word and that fulfillment of the word is to attract the elect and the elect will be attracted to the fulfillment of the word and so and they will not be offended in the way he fulfills his word because we're not offended that he used a kentuckian with a seventh grade education and poor grammar that doesn't offend me does it defend you i'm not offended amen that he called him out of kentucky and he ministered in jeffersonville i'm not offended that that by the end of his ministry most everybody had pulled away from him and thought that he was off and got off at the end and that he started off good but he wasn't doing good anymore i'm not offended in that because that's the way god chose to manifest his word and something in me says that's nothing but the truth that was the fulfillment of malachi 4. see he does it in such a way it can only attract the elect that's right in the message the trial we read this sunday but i'd like to go through it again in the trial from 1964 he says and he spoke down on the river he said as john the baptist was sent forth to proclaim the coming of christ i love this sentence i'm going to read it twice ask john the baptist so he's saying as john the baptist he's saying as then it'll be now as we did then it's going to happen in you as john the baptist was sent forth to proclaim the coming of christ at the end of his ministry jesus came when did jesus come at the end of the forerunner's ministry at the end of his ministry jesus came brother branham said as john the baptist was sent to forth run and sent forth to proclaim the coming of christ at the end of his ministry jesus came and as john was sent so will your ministry forerun the second coming of christ parallel tracts he's saying as it was here it'll be here let's not be offended in the way he fulfilled that [Music] in the message god hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same now i want to i want to go through that title again and again and again until it locks in because i've heard this title i've read this title we've discussed this title but it's taking on more meaning to me all the time since god is hiding himself in simplicity we got that god's always hiding himself in simplicity john was a simple preacher amen he wasn't a priest he wasn't this brother branham was a simple preacher amen peter was simple andrew was simple john was simple they were all simple your average joe some of them may have been considered below average joe but it was simple amen god was hiding himself in simplicity amen and when he was hiding himself in simplicity but it says and revealing himself in the same so we're comfortable with god hiding himself in simplicity but we've got to get comfortable with him revealing himself in the same because if you're going to see the revelation of jesus christ it's going to come out of the same kind of simplicity that he's hiding himself in so if he's hiding himself in simplicity he's really revealing himself in the same so why are we comfortable with him hiding himself in a simplicity but we're still looking for something big for the revelation if it's hidden in simplicity it's going to be revealed in simplicity when he hides it in something small obscure out of the way unnoticed he's going to be revealing it through the same thing so he's not going to hide it in something simple and reveal it in something great he's going to hide it in something simple and reveal it in something simple that's why brother branham had to preach this at the beginning of the seals it was ordained of god the title was ordained the order of the service was ordained what he said was ordained and he comes to the beginning of this week of services where he's going to be preaching the seven seals and he starts with god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself the same so that we don't miss that god always hides himself in a simple vessel and we all say amen we can read our bibles amen they were all simple vessels but don't miss that he's revealing himself in the same simple vessels unless you want him to stay hidden but he didn't hide himself to stay hidden he hid himself so he could be revealed but he wants to be hidden from some and revealed the others so how is he going to be revealed to some and hidden from others well he'll reveal he'll review he'll hide himself in simplicity so that the great and the intellectual and everybody else will miss it and it'll reveal himself in simplicity so the simple will catch it remember he was going to hide himself as a baby but he was going to hide himself in a stable and first he hid himself in a virgin from an out-of-way city that that's that's that there's nothing good spoke of in the bible he's going to hide in this little virgin that is a nobody and what's hidden in her christ himself the word himself is hidden in her and god is coming down uh in the fulfillment of the word he's coming down writing on a donkey amen why because the whole world had to be taxed amen so the whole world taxation was to fulfill the word of god to bring this simple humble virgin amen down on the back of a donkey led all the way down to bethlehem because the prophecy has to be fulfilled and she's not great enough to make the prophecy fulfilled so the great god is hiding it in a worldwide taxation worldwide politics is doing what hiding the simplicity so now he's come he's coming coming in simplicity amen and then coming down and being born amen not not in any significant place but being born in a stable way man and being placed in a manger so born in the stable placed in a manger what was it god hiding himself in simplicity amen but when it came time to reveal himself he had to get a group of people that would understand this hiding place so he went to a group of shepherds out in the field brother bam said illiterate shepherds and he went to those illiterate shepherds and revealed what was going on in that stable and they were simple enough to receive it amen they didn't question it they didn't have to go talk to the high priest amen they saw angels amen the angel declared to them what was happening they heard the angels singing they ran amen into the city to go see amen what was taking place in simplicity in hiding in simplicity amen was emmanuel and emmanuel was there in that form of a baby laying in a manger in a stable amen and those shepherds come in there and they began to worship him they didn't care he was a baby they didn't care he was in a stable they didn't care what his swatting claws were made of they didn't care he was laying in a manger amen they could receive what god was hiding in simplicity because he was revealing it in the same form [Music] and because they could receive it they were not offended in this manifestation so they ran into bethlehem and told everybody what they had seen and what the angels told them because they were not offended in him [Music] praise be to god do you think anything's different today nothing is different today they were not offended in that manifestation they were not offended in that fulfillment of the word why because they're simple amen they simple could hear the simple could receive amen because they they were ordained predestinated to receive how many people passed by how many people the next day would go into that stable to go get their animal lead them out feed them do whatever and they would see that there was a baby born overnight and see this woman and just grab their cow grab their donkey grab whatever and walk out and pay no attention to what was going on but there was there was shepherds running around town saying we saw an angel angel told us this we went and found it just like the angel said this is emmanuel this is messiah amen this this is the prophecy being fulfilled and they looked at the illiterate simple shepherd what was the simple shepherd now the mystery was hidden in the shepherd and revealed in the same they were revealing the fulfillment of prophecy amen and the people wouldn't receive it because of who had the message and the story repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats all the way down to this day and all the way into this building and all the way into your pew i guess we don't have pews but seats i didn't want to leave anybody out be hidden in simplicity and revealed and the same don't look for the hiding and simplicity and the revealing of something great you'll miss it in this message he says you love him my isn't he wonderful i hope and trust that the message will produce what it was intended to do that it'll get you to the place that you don't look for flowery things when you see god in greatness look how humble it is and then you'll see god don't look for him when elisha was back in that cave the smoke went across blood thunder lightning and all these kinds of sensations we've had blood in the face and in the hands and sensations and everything they've never bothered that prophet he just laid there but he heard a still small voice what was it the word lock into that what was that still small voice it was the word then he covered his face and walked out see that was it remember friend don't look for big you say god he speaks of great big things there'll come a time they'll be this that or the other great big things i hope you're catching what i'm talking about great big things and oh when this comes to pass it'll be great big like this and it'll be so humble you'll miss the whole thing and just go right on see you'll look back and say well that never did come you see you passed right over the top and you never even seen it see it's so simple and god lives in simplicity to manifest himself in greatness what makes him great because he can simplify himself now i want to go to first kings and look at this we've looked at it before but let's go to first kings 19 and look at elijah in the cave again and the reason i want to look at it is after i preached them on sunday i ran into brother emmanuel and brother emmanuel shared with me a quote that he had just heard and when i said brother that's good it had to do with this and he and i said send it to me so last night he sent it to me and late in the night and i read it and i got so excited he found several quotes on this and i just want to bring it to you because it's fresh for me and we thank god for using a simple vessel of brother emmanuel first kings 19 9 and he came hither into a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him said unto him what doest i'll hear elijah and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering into the cave behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou hear elijah so we know this and brother branham is referring to this and god hiding himself in simplicity and he says there was the great big loud uh a wind that was breaking the rocks and shattering them and there was the the fire that burnt through the mountain there was the the earthquake that shook it all amen but none of that moved elijah so he was showing that it was going to be in simplicity not something great not something big brother brandon mentions this and god hiding himself in simplicity he said but when he heard the still small voice what was it the word when he heard the word the word moved him like the thunder or the the wind couldn't move him the earthquake couldn't move the fire couldn't move him but the still small voice of the word is what moved him in humility to wrap a mantle around his face and go out to meet god and here's the one of the quotes that brother emmanuel sent to me he says in the 1960 and the unchangeable god says when he pulled back in the cave there came an earthquake outside that shook the cave where he was sitting there come a mighty rushing wind there came thunders and lightnings and blowing and it was all god but it didn't attract the prophet it didn't touch him somehow he knowed what god's power was he knowed god had shook the mountains and he had rushing winds and so forth and sent fire out of the heaven but he waited and way down inside of him came a little stall still voice where did the voice come from way down inside of him come a little still voice that attracted the prophet there was something he'd seen his power to do things but this time he felt his presence and a still small voice speaking into his heart then the prophet raised up and went out to the end of the cave what moved him the word amen what word the still saw voice that was down inside of him that was speaking to his heart i mean this is important because of what we want to what we want to look at i want to look at this next quote and we'll talk about that in 1962 and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy he says the thing of it is like i was saying last night the pentecostals are waiting for a rushing mighty wind but they failed to hear that still small voice it's wrong to do those things they think as long as what's wrong to do those things as long as the wind is rushing all right i think as long as the wind is rushing as long as there's enthusiasm as long as there's excitement as long as we can see something or hear something that's it and here's what brother brandon said but that didn't attract the prophet's attention the rushing wind never bothered the prophet elijah in the cave the mighty thunders and linings and pouring down never attracted him but what startled him was that still small voice that something speaking with inside my word is truth let every man's word be a lie and mind be truth that's what attracted the prophecy and it still it's it'll and it'll still do it the word of god always attracts the spiritual mind because it's the mind of christ in you that knows that that word is true that's what peter had amen peter had something that could receive a revelation from the father that would say i don't understand what you're talking about i don't know what you mean amen by what if the son of man goes up where he come down from unless i eat your flesh i don't understand but this i know the tower of christ the son of the living god thou alone have the words of eternal life amen there was something that peter had heard and what peter heard and moved him and in here in first kings when when brother was describing this in the cave he's in the cave in and i just wanted to look at it this way he's in separation he's all by himself elijah is away from everybody he's all alone and he's in a cave and if you'll just allow me this flexibility let's just say he's in a little room let's just say he's in a little room all by himself and there's a lot of noise going on all around the room and the little cave all by himself with nobody else present and all by himself with nobody else present all the noise is going on all around him the wind breaking the rocks and pieces amen the roar of the fire as it rushes through the earthquake as it shakes everything and nothing moves him into action nothing brings him out of the cave nothing brings him out humbled amen but when he hears the still small voice with inside him then he comes to the end of the little room amen with a mantle wrapped around his face ready to meet god amen you know there's there's there's so much noise all around there's noise friends there's noise from everybody i mean everything is noisy uh there's religion is noisy politics is noisy entertainment is noisy the world everything around is noisy noise here and noise there and i'll tell you another thing everybody has an opinion do you agree i mean the ones closest to you even your own family they got an opinion that sometimes you don't value or appreciate everybody there's noise noise noise noise noise but god amen had to get elijah's attention and all the noise wasn't going to do it but when he was all alone back in the little cave all alone with nobody else present there was a different kind of noise that resounded and the noise that he heard was a still small voice amen and that still small voice he heard with inside of him and when he heard that voice now it was time to wrap his face in a mantle the earthquake didn't cause him to wrap his face the fire the wind it didn't cause but wrapping his face in a mantle is a sign of ultimate humility and when he heard this still small voice he wrapped his his face in his mantle and he went to the end of the cave amen to to meet god amen to meet god face to face but he didn't do it with pride or arrogancy or any of those great big things it was the little still small voice that moved him to humble himself and get him back in action because he was hiding away and he come out of that cave with a commission to fulfill he come out of that cave with the work to do he come out of that cave with a purpose to do for god and god took him and put him right back in action and and there's noise lots and lots of noise but we need to draw to the little cave and you'll hear somebody say this and somebody will say that listen don't let that move you there's a fire over here and there's a thunder over there and there's a wind over here don't let that move you because if you let that move you you'll be chasing the wind from mountaintop to mountaintop to mountaintop trying to catch that wind if you let the earthquake move you i mean you're going to be waiting for the next earthquake to move you amen but it wasn't any of that that the prophet was waiting for it wasn't any of that that god amen used to get him out of the cave what god used amen was the still small voice within sight of him sometimes what we need to do is get away from all the noise and i don't mean move somewhere i mean that sounds nice let's go to montana or north dakota i think north dakota has more pigs than they have humans sounds good to me but that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about amen drawing aside amen getting along with god amen you can do that in a crowded room you can do that in a church full of people but get along with god and say god i'm listening for your voice in me amen i'm listening for the revelation that can only come from the father that you tell me this is the word this is the way this is the truth can't keep chasing the noise we got to go alone before god and hear his voice with inside see you can't accomplish this with tape listening only we can listen to tapes we can't accomplish this with preaching only all those are tools that god will use to speak to us but the still small voice is the one with inside down in the heart that's the one that moves us that's the revelation that comes from the father that's the one that's the divine revealer of the word telling you this is the truth amen this is right this is the way this is my way so so many voices so much noise but there's a still small voice i wonder how many times we've come to the message we want to serve the lord and we get alone with god and we run out every time something shakes i wonder how many times every time something shakes we we pop our head out to see what that is or we run to it or every time there's something happening we run to the shaking we run to the moving we run to the fire amen but we moved too early because we moved before we had our own revelation we chased the fire we chased the the wind we've chased the earthquake but the problem with that is you just keep chasing chasing chasing i wonder if we could just wait a little bit longer just get along with god and just wait a little bit longer until god drops something into our hearts that says this is it this is true and it'll bring us to a humility where we realize it wasn't me it wasn't anything i've done it wasn't anything i could think up or conjure up or accomplish or understand but i wrap myself in my mantle and i come to the entrance to meet the lord because it's all him now i just want him to tell me what i'm supposed to do and i want to go and i want to do what he tells me to do i want to be what he's called me to be i want to obey all he's told me to obey that's the fact of the still small voice brother branham is preaching in the seventh seal and i just want to go into the seventh seal for a little bit i don't intend to be long i just want to read some things that are familiar but i want to read it in this context he said and i had my hands out and all at once something hit my hand i don't know he's talking about the incident in sabino canyon with the sword in his hand and and he he's come to the seventh seal and in preaching the seventh seal we went through this before he doesn't preach the seventh seal the way he preaches the first six seals so i want to keep reiterating that i want to i want to keep talking about that i wanted god to keep unveiling it to us amen because in the first six seals he gave us the interpretation amen of what the symbol meant the symbol means this and what you saw there represents this and this is that and this is that and he goes through the scriptures and tying it all together but when it comes to the seventh seal he doesn't have that luxury because when you go to the seventh seal in revelation chapter eight there's nothing there to go off of it says there's silence and so he can't preach it the same way he preached to others because this seal is different in the bible and because the seal is different in the bible he can't preach it the same way he preached the other six so he's coming now and he's preaching it and and then he comes to this point here he's just went back over and then the sixth steal and he's went back over the gap between the sixth and the seventh and he showed chapter seven the 144 000 and then all the saints of tribulation and now he's went through that and now he's coming to the to the seventh seal and when he's coming here he just says i feel to stop when he feels to stop then he starts talking about visions and he starts talking about experiences remember he's not preaching the seventh seal the same way he preached to six he says i had my hands out and all at once something hit my hand i don't know i can't say did i go to sleep i don't know did i go into a trance i don't know was it a vision i can't tell you only thing i can see is it's just the same thing that them angels was and it struck my hand and i looked and it was a sword and it had pearl handles real pretty had a guard over it with gold and the blade looked like something like chrome like silver only it was real shiny and it was so feathered sharp oh my and i thought isn't that the prettiest thing it just fit my hand i thought that's awful pretty but said hey i'm always afraid of them things a sword and i thought what will i do with that and just then a voice shook down through there that rocked the rocks it's the sword of the king and then i come out of it the sword of the king now if it said a sword of a king but it said the sword of the king and there's only one the king and that's god and he has one sword and that's his word that i live by that so help me god standing over his holy desk with his holy word laying here it's the word amen so what is that sword that's put in his hand it's the word and brother brandon is getting so excited what's he at he's at the preaching of the seventh seal and he's not preaching the seventh seal the way he preached the sixth so quit expecting him to preach the seventh the way he preaches the sixth don't read the seventh like you read the six read the seventh differently and when he's reading now when he comes to the seventh he says now i was in sabino cain i said lord what is this something hit my hand i looked at it the rocks thundered out it thundered out that shook the rocks it's the king of the sword and he says there's only one the king and he only has one sword and that's the word he said oh praise god he gets excited with his holy word laying here it's the word amen it's the word so what is this it's the word and now he goes on he says and what a day we're living in what a great thing see the myst see the mystery and the secret we're showing you the mystery and the secret what's the mystery in the secret it's whatever was in his hand it's the word standing there when this left me something just come to me and said don't fear now i didn't hear no voice like on the inside of me spoke i didn't hear no voice like on the inside of me spoke i had to just tell you the truth just exactly what happened something hit and said don't fear this is that third pool that wasn't an audible voice amen that was hey listen i just want to say it this way let's back up the to first kings when elijah was in the uh in the cave all alone all by himself he was in the little room all alone and there was fire and earthquake and there was all these if anybody had been in the vicinity around there they would have heard the earthquake shake they would have heard the thunder amen or the wind bust those rocks they would have heard the fire come roaring through amen but there was something that was spoken in silence silence there was something spoken in silence and only the one it was intended for could hear it and he heard a still small voice what was it the word where did he hear it down inside of him listen this is why this is the very reason why brother branham cannot tell you what the seventh seal is [Music] this is the reason he can't come and say listen here's a flow chart and here's a graph he was told amen this will be he was told something down inside of me not an audible voice but something like down on the inside of me said don't fear this is the third pool and when he goes this is the third pool he goes right back to the vision he had seven years ago in the vision of where he was trying to fish and catch those rainbow trout out in the deep water and the rain joe trout are the covenant fish the children of god they were in the deep water and he was trying to catch them and there was all kinds of preachers out there fishing catch the vision everybody's trying to catch fish but brother branham is trying to catch the rainbow trout in the deep water and he knows how to fish and he's got a technique and the ministers gather all around and he starts explaining his technique and that's where he got in trouble because he explained the first pull sign in the hand and the second pulled discernment and he spent too much time explaining them and on the second pull he pulled it too hard and caught a little bitty fish that was just like skin over the lure just like them other ones was catching so he's catching the same fish jack coe was catching and a.a allen was catching oral roberts was catching but it wasn't the kind of fish he was going after and he was and so there was supposed to be a third pull in the technique first pulled attract attention to little fish second pool to scare the little fish away amen and the third pull would get the big fish because when the little fish scattered it would get the attention of the big fish they would come closer and on the third pool they would get hooked that was the technique but he messed it up on the second pole and he got his line all tangled he said i pulled too hard and he said i heard a voice say don't get your line tangled and at first i told you not to do that and he said oh god i'm a stupid person forgive me he said don't get your line tangled at a time like this and he had line in his hand and then he looked and it was a baby shoe we went through all of this with the big cord he's trying to lace it he told him you can't teach pentecostal babies supernatural things leave them alone so quit trying to teach them that's what he was always trying to do explain it explain and explain it but the whole point of the vision is to get him not to explain it then he comes amen and then he's brought up on high and he sees a big tent like a cathedral amen and inside he sees people coming around and inside on the platforms a little room and people are going into the little room amen and they're going in afflicted and they're coming out whole and there's a reporter trying to ask them hey man what happened and they said i don't know they can't explain what happened but they went in one by one by themselves in the little room and they were afflicted and now they're whole i hope you're not looking for a little room somewhere under a cathedral so you can walk into it i hope you're not looking for brother ben to come back and set up a tent somewhere and build a little wooden box in there but i hope you're understanding that all of those people were afflicted what caused affliction the fall what caused the fall unbelief what's being fixed in this little box it's more than legs it's more than crutches it's more than a wheelchair it's more than that amen i don't care if i limp the rest of my life i don't want to limp spiritually anymore amen i want the unbelief washed away i want the revelation of the word to change the effects of unbelief in my life that's what caused all the affliction they come into this little room amen and what did the angel lord said i'll meet you in there amen and he saw that pillar of fire go down there and so what was in there amen it was the pillar of fire what is the pillar of fire the lord himself what is the new birth brother branham amen it's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you there was something going on as they would get in contact with christ one by one as an individual and guess what it was it was silent nobody else knew somebody on the outside has a tablet trying to write down what went on inside amen and the person coming out can't explain what went on inside but where i was afflicted now i'm home this is a spiritual fulfillment and he says he was told he said that will be your third pool that will be your third pool and you won't tell it to nobody then on salbino canyon when the voice speaks within him he said don't fear this is your third pool sabino canyon was a sword in the hand not a tent in a box do you understand he's saying this is the same thing so the sword in the hand and the tent and the little box and the lord and there it's the same thing that'll be your third pull this is your third pole but it doesn't look the same one looks like a tent with people walking an afflicted coming out whole the other one's just a sword in your hand how can that be your third pull and how can this be the third pool so when you go into the box you'll have a sword for the third pool he said the sword is the word amen it's the word what is this this is the third ball this is the very thing that will attract and catch the rainbow trout and bring him into the kingdom of god this is the very thing what is it it's the word what was the tent in the box and the guy is it's the same thing it's the third pool it's the word to the individual one person one at a time to everybody else it's silent nobody else can hear what god revealed to you all they can do is see the effect coming out of the box they could see the effect but nobody knew what happened in the box in the little room something happened i can't explain to you what happened but something happened so nobody knows what's in secret nobody heard what took place but they could see the effect and now nobody nobody knows what you've heard nobody's heard what you heard nobody knows what you know what do you mean nobody knows what i know listen nobody knows what god revealed to you about you and about this message i mean you can act like you've had an experience with god you can pretend you but no nobody heard it nobody was there no it was in silence he said now back to the seventh ceo said now i didn't hear no voice like the inside of me spoke i have to just tell you the truth just exactly what happened something hit and said don't fear this is that third pool third pool you remember it you've had so many impersonators on this what you've tried to explain but said don't even try this do you remember it how many remembers that vision why it's all over the tape and everywhere that's been about seven six seven years ago been seven years ago said don't try to explain that this is the third pull i'll meet you in there what did he just do he just tied those two things together because the sword in his hand he said this is your third pool but seven years ago he said i'll meet you in there this will be your third pool and now he said this is the third pool i'll meet you in there praise god explain all that brother ted i can't i can't not because i'm not allowed to because i can't i really can't explain them but something's thundering in my heart amen amen amen and i can't explain it in details i can't explain it mechanical i can't show you on a graph i can't list it on a powerpoint i can't get you into a place where you now realize i'm in the little room and what am i here i can't do it for you nobody can do it for you it's something that you and god alone go through you can't explain it you hear it you receive it you believe it i don't even know how to i don't even know what terms to use he says in in the seventh seal he said i'd better stop right there i just feel checked not to say no more about it you know my experience first time i read the seventh seal that was like the most anticlimactic statement in the whole world for me i was looking for him to do what he did the first six seals and when he didn't do it in the seventh year i was disappointed and i didn't see what i was looking at i was looking right at it i was reading it but i wasn't seeing it i just feel checked not to say no more about it so just remember the seventh seal the reason it was not open the reason it did not reveal it no one should know about it so are we supposed to know about the seven seal or not the reason it's not real that no one should know about it let's go back to the vision whenever you catch a statement like that don't get off in the weeds go back to the vision each one lit into a little room where the pillar of fire was by themselves they came in afflicted they came out whole without being able to comprehend what happened to them that just something changed right but brother branham says he says the reason i did not reveal it did not reveal that no one should know about it no one should know about it but when i ask you the person who came out of the little room did they know about it so no one should know about it doesn't mean nobody will ever catch the revelation but he's not allowed to explain this one like he did the other two no one should know about it and i want you to know before i even knowed one word about that that vision come years ago you remember that and here it is just as this other has slides right straight into the word exactly where it was and god knows my heart i never one time thought of such a thing as that and here it was it's later than we think oh my just sows it from god for it fits exactly in the promises of god from the end from the end of the message you notice now for the end of time message this seal so this seventh seal is the end of time message have you heard the end of time message that's what he said this seal was he's revealed all the six seals but he don't say nothing about the seven and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the bible i just like to make this statement for everybody who would say that the seventh seal is not open i would say how would you know how can you say that the seventh seal not open he says when the end time seal when it starts it'll be absolutely a total secret according to the bible when it starts it'll be absolute a total secret well the seventh seal is not open how do you know it's an absolute total secret according to the bible when it starts it'll be an absolute total secret oh praise be to god it'd be a total secret according to the bible and before knowing that remember revelation 10 1-7 at the end of the seventh angels message all the mysteries of god should be known were at the end time the opening of the seventh seal he just told you we're at the opening of the seventh seal this is the end time message this seal it's the end of time seal he calls it all these things but he says we're here we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seal but i don't think it opened oh my goodness how would you know unless you went through the little room we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seal now how did i know the other day last sunday a week ago today when i was preaching on be humble be humble remember god deals in little things i didn't realize what it really was talking about and now i see it what brother brahman said brother brahm just told you we're at the end of time the opening of the seventh seal how did i know a week ago when i said don't look for big things remember when we got to the end of god hiding himself in simplicity he says i hope that the message accomplished that the purpose it was spoke for to not have you look for big flowery things and now he comes and tells you when this end time seal when the seventh seal is open it'll be absolute a total secret according to the bible but he says now we're here at the end time the opening of the seventh seal how did i know a week ago sunday when i said be humble be humble don't look for big things i didn't even really know what i was talking about and now i see it it's in such a humble way you think that something like that would be revealed to the vatican or it comes just like john the baptist it comes like the birth of our lord and the stable glory to god so help me the hours at hand we're here amen what is it it's a secret but we're here we're at the end of time the opening of the seventh seal we're here don't look for something big don't look for something big it comes like john the baptist which is brother branham's ministry he come like john the baptist so it comes like john the baptist we've had the forerunner and it comes like our lord in a stable the forerunning and the manifestation don't look for something big look for something little simplicity where it's hidden he said now i see it as in such a humble way you think that something like that would be revealed in the vatican but it comes like john the baptist comes like the birth of our lord and a stable glory to god so help me the hours at hand were here now do you see it i love that he said that right then it does my heart good the first several times i read that i was like no but now when i read it i'm like yes god i'm beginning to see it help me see it more god i'm starting to realize what you've done in our day help me to realize it more now do you see it the truth of god's vision the seven angels bringing me from the west they were coming from the west coming back he's bringing here for this message tonight catch that that whole the seven angels caught up in the constellation bringing them back they were bringing him back for the seventh seal message but each angel went to him monday night tuesday night or monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday to reveal to him that seal that he had needed that day i thought they would have brought him back for monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday but he says no they brought me back for this seal tonight they brought me back for the seventh seal what's that just hold it in your mind they brought me back here for this message tonight now the voice of that great thunder and the mission that was brought here has been revealed and proven that it was of god just think now i knew not those seals and they've been revealed this week did anybody think of that of those seven angels being this being the message that has come forth them angels bring me back here for that and questions and answers from 1964 he gets a question that says have the seven thunders which equals the seven mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the seven seals but they are are yet not known to us as the thunders yet it's a good question and the answer is no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about the seven thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was john knew what it was but he was forbidden to write him but he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh church age so he's telling you during the message of the seventh church age the seven thunders would sound down what was that it was the seven seals that's what the seven seals was all about it was the sounding of those seven thunders again in the seven still it says seven god's perfect number seven just right down the road seven thunders uttered straight together like they're spelling out something all that time john started to write he said don't write it jesus never spoke of it john couldn't write him angels know nothing about it okay let's read this again i don't want you to get lost in the details hang with me now we're talking about the seven thunders brother branham said they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about he said and he says uh he says listen the seven thunders that uttered their voices and no one could make it out that's what the thunders was about uh was revealed in those seals but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed so in the days of the sounding of the seventh church aged messenger those seven thunders would be revealed that's what the seals was all about that's what preaching the seals was all about now listen to what he says here god's perfect number seven he knocks on the pulpit six times just right down the road seven thunders uttering straight together like they're spelling out something what does he say like spelling out something like they're trying to get you to realize something like they're trying to explain something notice at that time john started to write and said don't write it so when we see the seven thunders uttered john was told to write everything that he saw and everything that he heard so he picks up his pen to write amen and he says don't write what the seven thunders uttered he said don't write it then he says jesus never spoke of it john couldn't write it angels know nothing about it what is it it's the thing that jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it see he didn't know it himself said only god would know it what is the mystery that jesus said angels don't know about and he himself don't know about but only god knows let's go to mark 13. he said this is the mystery that the seven thunders were spelling out they're spelling seven in a row like they're spelling out something he says at that time john started to write it but he was forbidden to write it jesus never spoke of it remember brother benham through the seals and the sixth seal he took you back to matthew chapter 24 when they asked when will be the end of the world and the sign of your coming and all these things take place and he starts to answer him and jesus in matthew 24 takes him through six seals but he doesn't say anything about the seventh that's what he's speaking of here jesus never spoke of it john couldn't write it angels know nothing about it what is it it's the thing that jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about he didn't know it himself and only god would know it mark 13 and 28 now learn a parable of the fig tree that's israel when her branches is yet tender and putted forth leaves and know what that summer is near when she's early in her nationhood so you in like manner when you shall see these things come to pass know that it is not even at the doors verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass to all these things be done heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father it's the mystery of his coming in the seventh seal he says now there was some reason that god let those seven voices be thundered because it must come we find that christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened the seventh seal but you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows it but it it's right along with what he said no one would know his coming they also would not know about the seventh under mystery so you see it's connected together what's connected together the seventh seal his the mystery of his coming and the seventh under mystery are all connected together that's the mystery that those seven thunders were spelling out there was something behind that was laying under those seven thunders there was a mystery being revealed in the preaching of the seven thunders and that mystery was the same thing john was told not to write that jesus didn't speak of that angels knew nothing about that the son didn't know but only the father himself needed let's go to revelation chapter eight i think i can just wrap up in just a couple minutes revelations 8 1 and when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour now let's go over to revelation 10 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire he handed his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are in the sea the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets brother branham said revelations 8 1 and revelation 10 are the same thing and it's also the mystery of his coming in the seventh seal he says when will it be brother branham i cannot tell you i do not know but one of these days if we ever meet again on this earth we're going to meet yonder at the judgment seat of christ and you'll find out that in the room the revelation coming from god just like all the rest of them has what's he talking about the revelation that came to him in the room on the seventh seal was just like the first six that revelation came to me in the room just like the other ones has one of the mysteries of that seal one of the mysteries of that seal the reason it wasn't revealed it was seven thunders that uttered their voices and there it is perfectly because nothing knows anything about it wasn't even written so we're at the end time we are here what did he just get done he's finishing preaching the seven thunders and he's telling you what is that mystery it's the seven thunders and he's just finished preaching the seven thunders and he's saying we're here and he's not allowed to tell you this is that he's you've got to catch it amen and the silence of not what's being spoken there has to be a voice from down on the inside that says that is that amen that is exactly what the word said that's exactly what he's pointing to that's exactly what he's talking about but if you're waiting for him to say this is that he's not allowed to do that there's a silence still in the seventh seal and the silence and the seventh seal is only broken inside of you when the voice thunders from down inside of you it says that's nothing but the truth the breaking of the seventh seal it was broken the sounding of those thunders that was the first part of that revelation amen the seven thunders uttered out that was the first part of that which was tied to revelations 8 1 which is tied to the coming of the lord but it was silence and he's not allowed to explain it he explained the first and second he's not allowed to explain this one what is it it's the word what was the preaching of those seven thunders the unwritten word amen john couldn't write it it wasn't written it was the white stone in junior jackson's dream so the line had never shown unwritten word it's the word it's the word it's the word and so now when the word comes into his hand and day by day he receives it from an angel and he comes out and speaks the word the unwritten word he shows it in the written word when he gets to the end of that he's telling you that what is it what is rev revelation 8 1 is what couldn't be spoken jesus never spoke of it in matthew 24 john was forbidden to write it the angels don't know about it even the son don't know only the father it's the mystery of his coming don't be offended in him because it's not like what most people were looking for it's not what the world was looking for brother ben said we don't look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest what is the preaching of the seven thunders the word made manifest when what was sealed is unsealed under the the mystery of god shall be finished in the voice of the seventh angel what is that amen it's the unsealing of the mystery it's the word it's the third pool it's all connected together he says i'll read this last sentence again one of the mystery of that seal the reason it wasn't revealed it was seven thunders that uttered their voices and there it is perfectly because nothing knows anything about it wasn't even written so we're at the end time we are here in the breach this is all the way back before he starts preaching the seals he preached gods and simplicity preaches the breach on revelation chapter 5. he said this seven sealed book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of revelations 10. is the seventh seal book revealed yes has the sunday town seven thunder sounded yes what does that mean let's go to revelations chapter five verse 1 and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne let's go to revelation chapter 6 verse 1 and i saw when the lamb when the lamb i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see [Music] brother branham said in the sixth seal so now tonight we have assembled here to hear your word and as we have been studying in this certain person of the scripture that the lamb was the only one that could open the seals or to loose them who opened those seals why did he open those seals how do you know the seals were open because of the seven thunders when did you hear the seven thunders in those consecutive nights of services when he was given the revelation of the unwritten word what john was not allowed to write when he was given the revelation of the unwritten word it tied you right back to the silence from revelation chapter eight they're the same thing the revelation of the unwritten word is revealing what was done in that silence what was that silence it's his coming and i'll just ask you a couple questions are you married to the lamb is this the invisible union is the wedding here then he has to be here you can't marry somebody who's not present now is the bride pregnant with the word has he pregnanted somebody he's not married to can he marry somebody when he's not present can he pregnant somebody without being here [Applause] see it's it's so simple we can walk right over the top of it because we have in our mind we're looking for the denominational picture of a giant image of jesus coming down and we all stretch our hands out and we all begin to float up to him but that's a denominational idea it's not it's not the scripture it's not what brother benham told us amen he don't look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest it's the silence of the seventh seal it was silent but it was silent in the cave too but elijah heard something see the rapture is even not what we expected because brother brahm teaches us in the rapture that there's three stages to it and it's not even what we expected we were looking for something and missing what we were seeing and i want to go back to the first scripture when you think you know something you know nothing as you ought we talk about all these things and see all these things in the seventh seal what brother benham said the seven thunders and the silence and i still say we don't know anything as we ought to know i still think there's so much for us to understand there's still things i read and i don't know how it fits there's still things i read the prophet saying i still don't know what he means by that amen but one thing i know is that this is the truth amen and i know this is our lord and i know our lord is the one who opened those seals it wasn't a man it was him and he couldn't open those seals until he came forth to take the book and to lose the seals and that was the seven thunders i don't know the rest of the picture always i don't know how it will manifest in coming days i don't always know what the next step is but i know that's nothing but the truth not because somebody told me i read it and read it and i heard it and heard it but one day it was like thunder on the inside it's not something i heard with my ears but something within the inside of me said that's it amen that is it that is what he's trying to tell me and what he was saying and the revelation of my heart just began to slide together and the quotes and the scriptures began to slide together but as much as that has slid together i still say when we think we know something we know nothing as we ought there's still more to this revelation friends there's still something more amen when brother brandon said this is the first part of that of that seal amen was those seven thunders he said it unfolded in a three-part manner showing that even the opening of the seventh seal amen is not just a pinpoint prick seven seal opens closes that's all of it it's done coming of the lord period he said it unfolded in a threefold manner he said this is the first part of that seal is those seven thunders so when we think we know something we know nothing as we ought to but i say god i want to know all that i ought to i want to see what i'm looking at because what i'm looking at thrills my soul what i'm looking at is the most exciting thing that i've ever seen in my life but i want to see what i'm looking at i want to i want the eye sad to see i want you to come and reveal to me i want to see it more clearly than i've ever seen it before in my life show me more reveal more open my eyes more no matter what god does for you no matter what you see and what revelation comes don't ever stop friends don't ever stop moving forward don't ever stop seeking more brother branham tells us in the church age book above everything else play for revelation that means above everything else more than your food your job more than your health and your security pray for revelation it means more than security it means more than health if you're a you need revelation more than you need healing in your body because with this revelation you can die with eternal life inside of you and that crippled body will come back new yeah more than healing be more more than money more than food we need revelation divine revelation from the father above all pray for revelation don't stop just because now god's given me a witness in my heart i see those thunders i see the opening that was just the first part but i want to see it all this is my lord this isn't doctrine this isn't teachings this isn't neat fun things to preach this is my lord this is the you look at the book of revelation in the book of revelation starts the revelation of jesus christ so if this is the revelation of jesus christ i want to know it all i'm not happy with chapter 10. got that i don't want i want it all then brother brahm comes and say this is the revelation of christ so i want it all it's available friends it's been given to us this end time message has given us the revelation of jesus christ the mystery of god is finished christ is the mystery of god revealed it's been handed over to our hands now may god let us see what we're looking at let's pray for revelation let's all stand musicians if you come brother john if you make your way up let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you god for this wonderful wonderful word that you've placed in our hands but god we can hold it we can read it and we can listen to it but only you can break the silence of the seventh seal only you can break that silence to the individual alone in the little room when you begin to reveal yourself to them god i pray that you would break the seventh sea of silence for us all for every one of your hungry children lord that are raising their hand and saying god i want more revelation i pray that you would keep thundering in their heart the revelation god without you it's not possible you're the only one that can bring revelation so father we ask that you would bring us abundant life-giving revelation well we need you in this hour god you've been so good to reveal yourself but we're hungry for more lord help us to see what we're looking at make it real make it vivid make it a revelation in our heart lord may you do the work inside of us so that we can see with your eyes what we're supposed to see may you break the silence of the seventh seal in our hearts lord by a divine revelation personally to each individual god if there's anybody here lord that is still groping around and not sure they want you lord but they don't know how to find you lord i pray that you would come to them and reveal yourself to them in a greater way speak to them lord down on the inside deep in the heart where the word comes to the word lord and quickens that word to life god may you do that work i pray we ask it in jesus name bring genuine births by the word god may we see you as you are in this day we saying lord at the beginning of this service i want to see jesus lord help us not to be offended when you show yourself to us let us not be offended in you in the way that you've come in this hour and the way that you're manifesting yourself in simplicity and revealing yourself in the same let us not be offended in you for god many are offended in your manifestation in this day many are offended because it was not what they expected let us not be one of those many lord help us god change us reveal yourself to us speak to us almighty god that we might see you in a greater way we commit ourselves to you lord as you speak to us lord may we grab the mantle and wrap it around our face because we realize lord there's nothing we could have done to reveal these things to ourselves there's not one thing we can do to produce a revelation there's not one thing we can do to understand you but god if you've spoken down with inside of us it's by your abundant grace in humility lord we come to you to say thank you father to hear the commission that you have for us the purpose in this life and may we go forth lord and fulfill that purpose with all that's in us may we be obedient to your calling oh we love you we ask you would move lord like only
