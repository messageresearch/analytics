[0:00] Some folks are building hopes down here
[0:02] and planning ahead. So busy with their
[0:07] fortunes, they forgot what Jesus said
[0:12] about the wars and earthquakes and the
[0:14] victories but leave me. But there's a
[0:18] group of people getting ready to leave.
[0:22] Ready to leave in the twinkling of an
[0:26] eye. Making investments in that bank up
[0:30] in the sky.
[0:32] Happy preparations, not a reason to
[0:36] grieve. Are you in that number getting
[0:40] ready to leave?
[0:43] And sinner, what's the reason for your
[0:46] needless delay?
[0:48] While you're hesitating, Christ could
[0:51] come most any day.
[0:55] The spirit's calling. Make your way to
[0:58] Calvary
[1:00] and get in that number. Getting ready to
[1:03] leave. Ready to leave in the twinkling
[1:08] of an eye. Making investments in that
[1:12] bank up in the sky.
[1:15] Happy preparations. Not a reason to
[1:18] grieve. Are you in that number? Getting
[1:22] ready to leave or ready to leave in the
[1:27] wings of an eye. Making investments in
[1:32] that bank up in the sky.
[1:35] Happy preparations. Not a reason to
[1:38] grieve. Are you in that number getting
[1:42] ready to leave?
[1:45] As sister Becca would come for her
[1:46] special sing, I
[1:49] am weak but thou art strong.

[13:44] Well, I guess I ought to be looking for
[13:49] a better
[13:51] place to live.
[13:54] Oh, but I just can't seem to get excited
[13:58] about this old world and what it can
[14:02] give.
[14:05] I could care less if I could buy it all
[14:10] with a solitary
[14:12] dime.
[14:15] For what good would a world to me with?
[14:21] Leaving on my mind.

[21:09] Thou king of my heart.
[21:14] Lord Jesus,
[21:19] make this
[21:21] thy throne.
[21:23] Throw there
[21:26] alone.
[21:28] Thou king of my heart.
[21:33] Lord Jesus,
[21:40] I want to greet you all in the name of
[21:42] the Lord Jesus Christ. It's my privilege
[21:45] to be here amongst you. I have begun a
[21:48] study in December
[21:50] and uh yeah, you're gonna I'll try and
[21:54] share that with you today. Um just while
[21:58] we're standing, let us bow our heads for
[21:59] a word of prayer.
[22:02] Our most gracious and loving heavenly
[22:04] father, it is our privilege
[22:07] to gather together once again as part of
[22:09] your body here on earth. And Lord, we
[22:12] have come because Lord, we are part of
[22:14] you from the beginning. And Lord, the
[22:17] revelation of not only who you are, but
[22:19] what we are in you, Lord, is becoming
[22:23] more and more real to each and every one
[22:25] of us.
[22:26] We realize we're a part of something
[22:28] much greater than ourselves because
[22:30] Lord, it's you who lives in us. And
[22:33] Lord, you're wanting to express your
[22:35] life now through us. Take me as your
[22:38] servant, Lord, this morning. Move me
[22:39] aside. Guide my thoughts. Guide the
[22:41] words which are spoken because Lord, we
[22:44] want to hear from you this morning. They
[22:46] don't want to hear from me, Lord. We
[22:48] want we want to hear from you. So Lord,
[22:50] take me, move me aside, and and bless us
[22:53] with your word and bless us with your
[22:55] presence. For I ask it in Jesus Christ's
[22:57] name. Amen. While you're standing, if
[23:01] you'd like to open your Bibles to
[23:02] Colossians, the first chapter, read
[23:04] verses 25- 27.
[23:08] Like I say, I've been studying, for lack
[23:12] of a better word, on a certain subject.
[23:14] I was going through the book of of
[23:15] Ephesians. Um, I started in December. I
[23:19] minister every other week by Zoom to
[23:21] India. It saves on airfare
[23:24] and uh but I've been going through there
[23:26] and as you study it just becomes more
[23:30] and more
[23:32] and so
[23:35] I have there's a lot on my plate and so
[23:37] we we will try and Lord I want you to
[23:41] take control. I don't want it to be me.
[23:46] Lord I want it to be you.
[23:49] In Colossians, it says, "Wherefore I am
[23:51] made a minister according to the
[23:52] dispensation of God, which was given to
[23:54] me for you to fulfill the word of God,
[23:57] even the mystery which hath been hid
[23:59] from ages and from generations, but now
[24:01] is made manifest to his saints, to whom
[24:04] God would make known unto you what is
[24:06] the riches of the glory of this mystery
[24:07] among the Gentiles, which is Christ in
[24:10] you, the hope of glory." And you can be
[24:14] seated.
[24:16] We understand in Revelations 10:7 it
[24:18] says, "But by the days of the voice of
[24:19] the seventh angel, when he shall begin
[24:21] to sound, the mystery of God should be
[24:23] finished as he hath declared to his
[24:25] servants, the prophets." And so this
[24:28] mystery of God has to come to its
[24:30] conclusion.
[24:31] But that conclusion is going to be in
[24:33] us. Amen. When when we read these things
[24:36] and we keep putting it off on the
[24:37] prophet or this person or that person,
[24:39] but when you begin to realize what God
[24:41] is trying to accomplish and he's trying
[24:43] to accomplish it through us
[24:46] because now we literally are the body of
[24:48] Jesus Christ here on earth. Brother
[24:50] Brandham expresses often times we are
[24:52] him. But often we fail to recognize, we
[24:56] fail to accept that. I know when I when
[24:58] I went through the when I when I studied
[25:00] long a while back and I went through the
[25:02] the life of the prophet you know at
[25:05] different stages in his life he had to
[25:07] step into his office
[25:09] he was reading and and and and he
[25:11] studied and he began to understand he
[25:12] says well God speaks to me by vision
[25:15] well that's how he speaks to prophets so
[25:18] he accepted the fact he was a prophet
[25:21] later on he when God began to give him
[25:23] the to reveal to him the secrets of the
[25:26] hearts he began to he looked back and
[25:28] this is well this is how God did with
[25:29] Abraham and Sarah and he began to
[25:32] realize what God was doing in his life.
[25:35] He when he preached the church ages he
[25:38] brother Brandham in the in the 50s he he
[25:40] in my opinion he regarded he regarded
[25:43] Billy Graham as the messenger to the age
[25:45] because he says look at him here he's
[25:47] preaching the word but there's no
[25:49] miracles but then when he preached the
[25:51] church ages because he God had given him
[25:53] visions and says oh these visions are
[25:56] almost all fulfilled then he preached
[25:58] the church ages and when then that's
[26:01] when God told brother Brandham now you
[26:02] read Malachi 4
[26:04] and he began began to realize his
[26:06] office. But then when we get into the
[26:08] seals, what did he do there? He says, "I
[26:11] have been given a message now that I
[26:13] must be that I am responsible to
[26:14] deliver."
[26:16] And so he stepped fully into the office
[26:18] of the being the messenger to this age.
[26:20] That that's how I look at it. But then
[26:22] when we begin to look at ourselves, God
[26:24] is trying to show the bride, this is who
[26:26] you are.
[26:28] And now we have to step into what God
[26:30] has says we are. not something that we
[26:33] are going to become. No, this is who we
[26:36] actually are. We are literally him upon
[26:38] the face of this earth.
[26:41] When I was studying when I when I look
[26:43] at God and and God is a generic term.
[26:47] Some people's God is chocolate. Some
[26:48] people's God is their job. Some people's
[26:50] God is their cars, you know. But when
[26:52] you begin to understand, I was raised
[26:54] trinitarian
[26:56] and so always, you know, we divide God
[26:58] up into three different people.
[27:00] But I began to realize, what is it that
[27:02] dwells in me?
[27:04] Oh, it's the Holy Spirit. What's the
[27:06] Holy Spirit? It's Elohim.
[27:10] The all powerful self-existing one
[27:13] in which nothing is impossible with.
[27:17] I that is what lives in me. But I have
[27:21] to release him. When I was in in India,
[27:25] I talked to some of the kids and they
[27:26] said, "Oh yeah, where does God dwell?"
[27:28] Oh, he dwells in my heart. So I came to
[27:30] so I think I asked the child I said well
[27:32] do you ever let him out
[27:35] because really I mean when when I begin
[27:37] to look at myself this is my problem. I
[27:40] know where he lives. I know where he
[27:42] dwells but I have to allow him the
[27:45] liberty to use this vessel to express
[27:47] himself.
[27:49] When I began to when I began to
[27:51] understand this about God the Bible
[27:53] talks about God as a spirit. Okay. But
[27:56] that spirit has no form. But then he
[27:59] goes on but then he goes on to the fact
[28:01] that he that he that God immorphy God
[28:04] changes his dwelling place. Well, where
[28:07] is his dwelling place now?
[28:10] Us.
[28:11] Not out there.
[28:13] Us.
[28:15] And when and and we make the transation
[28:17] transition in our thinking. This is God.
[28:22] He's he lives in me, but now he's
[28:24] wanting to express his life through me.
[28:27] And that changes the whole picture. We
[28:29] we sang the songs, you know, Lord, take
[28:31] my hand and I think I forget the exact
[28:33] words of the song, but he was leading
[28:35] and guiding. Do you realize every step
[28:38] of the of every step of your life, he
[28:41] was guiding you?
[28:43] Whether sometimes you're not the way you
[28:45] wanted to go, for sure, but still it was
[28:48] his hand.
[28:50] Okay.
[28:52] Okay. Come on. Don't do this to me.
[28:58] All righty. Let's see if this can go.
[29:03] When we when we begin to look at at when
[29:05] we begin to look at some of the things
[29:06] that God was telling us through the
[29:08] prophet, he was talking about God. He
[29:10] says, "And that's what God did. It's the
[29:13] same God
[29:15] all the time."
[29:17] Okay? God in the form of the father, the
[29:20] spirit, and the pillar of fire. The same
[29:22] God was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[29:25] God immorphy brought out so that he
[29:27] could be seen. And now that same God is
[29:30] the Holy Ghost, Father, Son, Holy
[29:32] Spirit. Three gods, three offices of the
[29:34] same God. And so when we begin to look
[29:36] at God and we begin to look at his
[29:38] manifestation, when we take God and we
[29:40] divide him up in different compartments,
[29:42] okay, this is fine because in different
[29:44] compartments, in different
[29:45] manifestations, he manifested himself in
[29:48] one form and the children of Israel, God
[29:50] above us. Then God then that same God
[29:52] came into into a form we call Jesus
[29:54] Christ. And God came in Jesus Christ for
[29:57] the express purpose of of of through
[29:59] that body being able to declare himself
[30:01] and letting people know this is who I
[30:03] am.
[30:04] Amen.
[30:05] He had to come to the place of spirit is
[30:07] I mean when you begin get into the law
[30:09] and you begin to reach through the Old
[30:11] Testament you find all the things that
[30:13] that God had told them. But when God
[30:16] came in Jesus Christ, all of a sudden we
[30:18] began to actually see him.
[30:20] Amen.
[30:22] We could we could touch him. We could
[30:23] they could talk with him. And and when
[30:26] we uh
[30:28] there's a there's a a company called
[30:30] Sight and Sound and and they put on
[30:32] productions and I found them to be real
[30:34] good. They did one on Jesus Christ and I
[30:37] had always thought, you know, God is
[30:39] super holy and all these other things.
[30:41] And when I began to look at Jesus
[30:42] Christ, but in their production of Jesus
[30:44] Christ, they made him a man.
[30:48] He laughed, he joked, he he had fun. I
[30:52] mean, there was one of the scenes, you
[30:53] know, where this leper came by and and
[30:55] so Jesus and the disciples were pulling
[30:58] him away from them and and Jesus just
[31:00] broke himself free from them and what
[31:02] and he he touched the leper and then he
[31:04] turned around and he began to touch one
[31:05] of the disciples and they got, you know,
[31:08] and and and in that in that production
[31:11] Jesus Christ was smiling. Okay? Because
[31:14] I mean this is him. He was a hum he was
[31:16] humanity.
[31:17] He was every much a human as we are. And
[31:21] this is where we sometimes where we
[31:22] stumble and fall. But we have to begin
[31:24] to understand it was Elohim now living
[31:27] in that body and and in that body he was
[31:29] not only expressing himself not only not
[31:32] only doing that but Jesus Christ often
[31:34] time he says I have to go by needs of
[31:36] Samaria. I have to go here. I have to go
[31:37] there. Why? Because there was something
[31:39] inside of him that was guiding and
[31:41] directing him because there was
[31:43] something that God wanted to minister
[31:44] unto the person that was he was leading
[31:46] him to. And he didn't always tell Jesus
[31:50] Christ, "Why are you going by Samaria?
[31:52] Why are you going by Jericho? Why are
[31:54] you going here? Why are you going
[31:55] there?" But when he got there, all of a
[31:57] sudden, God revealed unto him, "This
[31:59] person's blind. He needs to have his
[32:00] side. This person is s this person's had
[32:03] how many husbands and all of a sudden
[32:04] now he brought unto her salvation."
[32:07] So he he was God was leading and God was
[32:10] guiding. And you if I can look back in
[32:13] my life and I can see how God's hand is
[32:15] always led and guided. Not necessarily
[32:18] the way I would want to go. But I have
[32:21] also found that he will put he will put
[32:24] circumstances in my path which will
[32:27] encourage me to go the way he's wanting
[32:30] me to go. Okay. But here we find God.
[32:34] God was in God came in flesh and he
[32:36] dwelt among us. He got him he brought
[32:38] out so that he could be seen. And it was
[32:41] all it was the self-existing Elohim. It
[32:43] was it was God Almighty dwelling in that
[32:45] human vessel. But now where does that
[32:48] where does that go live now? He lives in
[32:50] us
[32:52] when you put him in the prophet that's
[32:53] fine because we recognize that. But we
[32:56] have to realize no he's dwelling here
[32:59] and every one of oh we pray oh we want
[33:01] to see Jesus. Yeah. Well we need to look
[33:03] at each other
[33:05] because now what is God going to do?
[33:06] He's going to express himself in us
[33:10] and we and and and and as we mature in
[33:13] him, his attributes should be able to be
[33:15] expressed through us.
[33:18] I I know sometimes when when you know
[33:20] God, Brother Bram says, you know, you
[33:22] can speak a world and create and live on
[33:23] it. Well, I'd like to make my own planet
[33:26] and have it my but no this this this the
[33:30] uh so solar system we live in could not
[33:33] tolerate 5,000 planets rolling around
[33:35] the same and so okay so what we done was
[33:39] and I'll use this expression I I create
[33:41] my world my bubble okay
[33:45] and in my bubble there's love joy peace
[33:48] longsuffering gentleness meekness
[33:49] patience kindness you know all these
[33:51] wonderful attributes
[33:53] and so when I meet somebody else and
[33:56] they're in the world and you go to the
[33:57] grocery store and then they're scanning
[33:59] your your you know products that you're
[34:01] purchasing they're almost required to
[34:04] say hi how are you and you know and so
[34:07] when they do that all and as they're
[34:08] doing I says well how are you
[34:11] uh isn't it a beautiful day outside and
[34:14] the sun is shining and the clouds are
[34:15] there and all these wonderful things we
[34:17] have to enjoy that God has created I'm
[34:20] inviting them into my bubble
[34:23] And if they if they if they respond,
[34:26] fine. We'll draw them even closer. If
[34:27] they don't, well, okay. You know, that's
[34:29] their their choice. But see here again,
[34:32] when when we begin to live in this
[34:34] bubble, it it it isolates me from the
[34:37] world.
[34:38] Because I don't want the world. I'm
[34:40] finding it very offensive.
[34:44] It goes on when God was becoming man
[34:48] because brother Brandham says this is
[34:50] one of the reasons that that God came
[34:54] says in him was to be man that's the
[34:56] reason Christ was the expressed image
[34:58] see now he was to be the father he was
[35:00] to be the son he was to be the savior he
[35:03] was to be the healer there was nothing
[35:04] there wasn't even angels or nothing then
[35:06] he had created angels and then he became
[35:08] god and then he was worshiped and then
[35:10] these things became the manifestation of
[35:12] his thinking
[35:15] We were thoughts of God.
[35:17] You are the manifestation of his
[35:20] thinking.
[35:21] Amen.
[35:21] Because brother Bradam says if you were
[35:24] not a part of God from the beginning,
[35:26] you will not be a part of God. Now
[35:29] and so if you were a if you were in his
[35:31] thinking, if you were a part of God,
[35:33] what
[35:35] within a seed is a life.
[35:38] Okay? If you plant, it's like the
[35:40] example I I use in India is you take a
[35:42] corn of of of rice and you put it in the
[35:45] ground. You don't expect watermelons.
[35:47] You don't expect palm trees. You don't
[35:49] No, you expect rice
[35:52] because the life that is in that seed is
[35:55] trying to express itself.
[35:57] That's right.
[35:58] And it can only express what it is.
[36:01] So what did God do? God placed his seed
[36:04] in us.
[36:06] That's the life of God.
[36:09] That seed can only produce God.
[36:12] And as it grows and as it matures, that
[36:15] seed all of a sudden is trying to come
[36:17] into full manifestation and expression
[36:19] in us.
[36:22] I mean, God is trying, we are in the
[36:24] last days. I mean, literally, it's not
[36:26] future anymore. We're here. I mean, you
[36:27] look, I don't dwell on on the news very
[36:30] often, but I I don't want to be ignorant
[36:31] either. But when I look at all the
[36:33] things that are being fulfilled, there's
[36:35] a whole bunch of things have been have
[36:37] been fulfilled just in the last few
[36:40] months.
[36:42] It'll take nothing at this point for all
[36:45] of a sudden there to be the change. You
[36:46] let California sink, everything's going
[36:48] to change. That's right.
[36:50] And we know it's going to, okay? Whether
[36:52] we'll be here or not be here, that
[36:54] that's that's points of debate. But we
[36:56] have to begin to understand it'll take
[36:58] nothing to make the major change
[37:00] necessary for the dead in Christ to rise
[37:03] them to come down and my father to come
[37:04] into my house and say, "Hey, could I
[37:07] have a cup of coffee?" We sit down at
[37:09] the breakfast table. We have our toast
[37:11] and coffee and all of a sudden I began
[37:12] to realize here we're here
[37:15] and that'll increase within me the faith
[37:17] to be to be able for the transition for
[37:20] the for the translation of my body.
[37:23] Anyway, so we go and we begin to look at
[37:25] God. We begin to look at what he was. We
[37:27] begin to look at what he was trying to
[37:29] trying to accomplish.
[37:31] Um, so we we go on in in in John John 1
[37:35] 1-3 it says in the beginning was the
[37:37] word or this this logos and the word was
[37:39] with God and the word was God. The same
[37:41] was in the beginning with God. All
[37:43] things were made were made by him
[37:44] without without him was not anything
[37:46] made that was made. And you go into
[37:48] Genesis 1:1 it says in the beginning
[37:49] Elohim created the heavens and the
[37:51] earth. And so when we begin to look when
[37:53] God began to when God began to come into
[37:56] physical manifestation, what did he do?
[37:59] He w did in in John it talks about the
[38:01] logos, the thought of God now coming
[38:03] into manifestation. In Genesis it says
[38:05] this is Elohim and he through and and he
[38:08] and he created everything. So what did
[38:10] God do? He says he says God came in
[38:12] Jesus Christ for the express purpose of
[38:16] being able to manifest himself.
[38:18] We find here in in adoption, brother
[38:20] Brandham makes this statement. He says
[38:23] in Genesis 2 when he made man, he said,
[38:25] 'I am Yahweh. I am Yahweh. Yahweh
[38:29] Jehovah. What did it mean? I am the I am
[38:32] the allexisting one who has created
[38:35] something off of myself
[38:38] to be a son of mine or a temporary or an
[38:41] amateur little one of mine. Jehovah
[38:43] means that he gave man to be the amateur
[38:45] god because he is a he was the father
[38:48] Elohim and he made and he made a man and
[38:51] an amateur god. So he wasn't
[38:52] self-existing anymore. He now he existed
[38:55] with his family.
[38:57] And then when we read this this account
[38:59] in Genesis,
[39:01] God create God took a part of himself to
[39:05] create Adam
[39:07] and we say, "Oh yeah, this this is
[39:08] great." But I tried to think, well, how
[39:10] can we relate that to to something which
[39:12] is down to where we live? When when when
[39:15] uh when I got married,
[39:19] I play I took a I took a part of myself
[39:22] and I placed it within my wife and after
[39:26] the gestational periods, a part of me
[39:29] came into manifestation.
[39:32] That child was an expression of who I
[39:35] am. I mean, her her genetics also mix
[39:37] into that. But still, it's interesting.
[39:40] We have eight daughters and it's
[39:41] interesting. Half of them express her
[39:42] attributes and the other half express
[39:44] mine. They better if they had hers than
[39:46] mine. But that they're stuck with it.
[39:48] But we have to begin to understand. It's
[39:51] the simplicity of this. Yes, sir.
[39:54] You are an expression of God himself. A
[39:57] part of God came in you. A part of God
[39:59] was always in you. That was the seed
[40:01] that God had placed inside of you. But
[40:04] that seed had a life. And what is that
[40:06] life? That life was God. Amen.
[40:08] And so as as you allow that seed of God
[40:11] to come to manifestation expression in
[40:14] your life, all you will produce is him.
[40:19] In order for a seed to be able in order
[40:22] in order for the life within the seed to
[40:24] be able to express itself, the shell has
[40:27] to die.
[40:29] Well, in order for God to express
[40:31] himself through me, this shell has to
[40:35] die.
[40:37] But the more I can die to myself. I
[40:39] mean, Paul had this had the same thing.
[40:41] He says, "The good I want to do, I don't
[40:42] do. What I don't want to do that I find
[40:44] myself doing, oh wretched man that I am,
[40:46] who can deliver me from this the body of
[40:47] death?" And and the expression there,
[40:51] it's interesting, you know, that the
[40:52] Romans had devised ingenious ways, if
[40:55] you will, to to to have the people in
[40:58] their in their prison die. They would
[41:00] take a corpse, they would tie it to the
[41:02] next person who was supposed to die. And
[41:04] so that person would be carrying around
[41:06] a corpse and as that corpse decayed, all
[41:08] the corruption went into that person's
[41:10] body. And eventually they got so sick
[41:12] and they died. Then they would take that
[41:13] corpse and they would tie it to the next
[41:14] one. This is the body of death.
[41:18] I dwell in this temple of clay and this
[41:21] temple of clay is all of my problems.
[41:24] But the more that I can yield to the God
[41:26] that is in me, he can overcome this
[41:28] temple.
[41:29] Because that's what he did in in Jesus
[41:31] Christ.
[41:35] So when God in Genesis 1, it says, "Let
[41:37] God," he said, "let make man in our
[41:39] image after our likeness." And so when
[41:41] God created man, he says, "God created
[41:43] the man in his own image, and the image
[41:45] of God created he him, male and female
[41:47] created he them." When God looked at
[41:50] Adam, within Adam was two was two man
[41:53] two attributes that of masculine that of
[41:55] feminine and and within God was the
[41:58] same.
[41:59] When he also says I I am the alshi. I am
[42:02] the breasted one. Well, breasted one
[42:04] speaks of of of a feminine. Okay.
[42:07] Um and but here again when he created
[42:10] Adam and he took Adam and in theophony
[42:12] form, Adam had no problems. It's when
[42:14] Adam was taken from theophony and put
[42:16] into flesh. That's when that's when
[42:18] problems begin. And theophony that Satan
[42:21] could not tempt theophanes.
[42:23] But in flesh, that's different because
[42:26] in flesh have there there are things in
[42:28] flesh it has its own desires. It has its
[42:30] own things that it has to have. When
[42:33] it's tired, it wants to sleep. When it's
[42:35] hungry, it wants to eat. When it's
[42:37] thirsty, it wants to drink. And these
[42:39] are fine. But then when you get up into
[42:41] the realm of of interacting with other
[42:43] people, then all of a sudden everything
[42:44] begins to change. That's right.
[42:46] Because then we want to be accepted and
[42:48] then we we want to be liked. We want to
[42:50] do this and we want to do that. And then
[42:52] all of a sudden then that's when our our
[42:53] our personalities begin to express
[42:56] themselves and they're not always
[42:58] exactly what God would want.
[43:01] But here again, but when we begin to
[43:03] see, when we begin to understand what
[43:05] God was doing, when we begin to
[43:07] understand the plan of God, like I say,
[43:10] Paul says, there's this mystery that's
[43:11] been hidden.
[43:13] All through the scriptures, there's this
[43:15] mystery
[43:16] and he tried to express it. Where does
[43:18] he come up with this? Christ in you. God
[43:21] living himself in you. This is the
[43:23] mystery.
[43:24] But see, now this mystery now has to
[43:26] come into its finality. Now this mystery
[43:28] has to finally come to its full
[43:29] expression. And so when we begin to look
[43:31] at the time when when when uh when Adam
[43:34] was placed in flesh and he was lonely,
[43:37] then what did God do? He went and and he
[43:39] created a body for the other part of
[43:41] Adam to live in.
[43:43] Right?
[43:44] And then when when all of a sudden God
[43:45] to God reached into Adam. Let's see if
[43:48] this is go to the next one.
[43:52] So God he takes about he talks here
[43:54] about God took ba man. God took Adam
[43:57] from theophony and put him in flesh. And
[44:00] in okay, Adam was given rulership of the
[44:04] earth. But in theophony, he could not
[44:07] experience what the animals experienced.
[44:10] When they were hungry, he did not know
[44:11] what hunger was. Not in theophony form.
[44:14] He didn't know what it's to be hot or to
[44:15] be cold. And because that was theophony
[44:17] form. So God took Adam and he placed him
[44:19] in flesh so that he could experience
[44:21] what the animals experience.
[44:23] Why did God have to come in Jesus
[44:25] Christ? So he could experience us. Amen.
[44:29] He couldn't experience in Moses. He
[44:30] couldn't experience in Isaiah. He
[44:32] couldn't experience in the prophets. He
[44:33] couldn't experience because they I mean
[44:35] they were part of God's creation yet.
[44:37] But but God was but God in in those
[44:40] people could not experience what
[44:42] humanity is.
[44:44] In Jesus Christ, he experienced
[44:47] humanity.
[44:47] That's right.
[44:49] We'll get into that a little bit later.
[44:52] He said, "So then God brought man a
[44:54] little lower down and and and and put
[44:56] him in an animal life. That's his body
[44:58] just like animals so that we so that he
[45:00] could till the soil." Um and so God put
[45:04] him in flesh so that he could till the
[45:05] soil and he gave him the five senses and
[45:08] stuff like that. Um
[45:15] and goes on and on. Yeah. The next one.
[45:18] Okay. So when he first made him, he made
[45:20] him he made them together. He made male
[45:22] and female the man. And he said, "Now
[45:24] when now when man was separated from
[45:27] this theophony and put in flesh, he he
[45:29] wasn't just all together there as part
[45:30] of his being. So he so he took Adam and
[45:33] he made and he made from the original
[45:36] dirt Adam and he took a rib from the
[45:38] side of of him and made a help me that
[45:41] was Eve and she was she was made for man
[45:44] and was a part of man. See, she was a
[45:47] part of him in the beginning in the
[45:48] creation in the theophony. She was a
[45:50] part of him down there in his creation.
[45:53] So, uh she could be so she could not be
[45:57] deliver she did not come through from
[45:59] the other creation. She had to be a part
[46:01] of him.
[46:03] And so when we begin to look at
[46:04] ourselves in Christianity,
[46:08] we always were a part of him.
[46:10] We existed in him. When God was in
[46:12] theophony form, when Jesus Christ was in
[46:14] theophony form, we we existed in him
[46:17] then.
[46:18] Amen.
[46:19] And and and but and so when God took
[46:22] Adam and he and he and he put Adam in
[46:24] flesh and then he took from Adam and he
[46:26] and he and he took a part of Adam so
[46:27] that he could create a body for for the
[46:29] other part of Adam, the feminine part.
[46:31] And and Adam looked and says, "This
[46:33] flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone,
[46:35] spirit of my spirit." And so when we
[46:37] begin to take and relate that to us now
[46:40] we always were in him
[46:43] always. If you weren't in him then you
[46:45] never were you never will be a part of
[46:47] him.
[46:48] Okay. God came to seek and save that
[46:50] which was lost. Lost implies prior
[46:52] ownership. And so here again we find
[46:54] that God that we were a part of God from
[46:56] the beginning. And when and when Jesus
[46:58] Christ went to Calvary he had to be
[47:00] smitten so that so that so that so that
[47:03] we could be released from that body.
[47:04] That that's another part of the sermon
[47:06] if we get to it.
[47:08] But we have to begin to understand this
[47:11] this relationship between Adam and Eve.
[47:14] We have to begin to understand that they
[47:16] that that God regarded them as a single
[47:19] entity.
[47:19] That's right.
[47:21] When God looks at us, he considers Jesus
[47:23] Christ and us the same entity.
[47:25] Amen.
[47:27] He hears our voice speaking through the
[47:29] blood.
[47:29] That's right.
[47:31] Okay. He doesn't He doesn't look at you.
[47:33] He's he's not he's he's not really
[47:35] concerned about you in some regards.
[47:37] What he's wanting is vessels that he can
[47:39] live through, the vessels that he can
[47:40] express himself through. And and what
[47:42] he's trying to do now in in in the in
[47:44] the closing age, closing period of time,
[47:47] he's trying to come to the place where
[47:48] he can so live in us until it's no
[47:50] longer us living, but now it's God
[47:52] himself living his life out through us.
[47:55] Yes, sir.
[48:03] When we look at the fall, we have to
[48:05] understand
[48:08] you had Adam could not be deceived.
[48:12] The part that came out of Adam because
[48:14] it was not part of the original
[48:16] creation. It could be
[48:19] Adam had Satan had his opportunity when
[48:22] Eve began to walk away from Adam
[48:26] and when she was alone then then Satan
[48:28] could go and Satan could approach her in
[48:31] in in the serpent and serpent was not a
[48:33] snake at that point but he could speak
[48:35] he could sit there with Eve and he could
[48:37] interact with her and talk with her and
[48:39] he created within her a desire something
[48:41] which God had withholden from her
[48:44] but she listened to it and she and she
[48:46] looked to the reasoning and she began to
[48:48] reason in her mind. She began to to to
[48:50] desire this this this knowledge, this
[48:52] experience. And that's when that's when
[48:55] Satan was able through the serpent to
[48:57] have an interaction with Eve. And then
[48:59] Eve went and she and and took this
[49:01] interaction, this knowledge, this
[49:02] wonderful revelation that she had come
[49:04] up with. And she goes to Adam and Adam
[49:06] realizes this is wrong.
[49:09] But in order for for her to be saved,
[49:12] Adam had to be a partaker of her sin.
[49:14] That's right.
[49:15] For us to be saved, all of our God had
[49:18] to take Jesus Christ had to take all of
[49:20] our sins on him and pay for those sins.
[49:22] If he had not, we would have been lost.
[49:26] So, he willingly took our sins. He
[49:28] willingly became us. He willingly toart.
[49:31] He He Jesus Christ never sinned. He took
[49:35] our sins on him.
[49:37] But he took our sins on him because of
[49:39] the love he had for his wife. for the
[49:41] love that he had for that which was a
[49:43] part of him. And so when when we go down
[49:46] and we begin to look at this and we
[49:47] begin to come to to Genesis the third
[49:49] chapter, we find out that God would come
[49:52] down in the cool of the evening and Adam
[49:54] and Eve hid themselves.
[49:56] Why would they hide? Because they knew
[49:59] they had been just disobedient
[50:02] and that brought about the fall.
[50:04] And so we go on there. And so God in in
[50:07] Genesis uh 3 starting at at verse 14, he
[50:10] says, "And the Lord God sent a serpent
[50:12] because thou has done this, you're
[50:13] cursed above all the cattle, and above
[50:14] all the beasts of the field." And he
[50:17] goes on in verse 15, "I will put emnity
[50:19] between thee and the woman, between thy
[50:20] seed and her seed, and I it will bruise
[50:23] thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
[50:24] heel." So here even that the time of the
[50:27] fall, God spoke of there would be a
[50:29] redemption. There would be a process and
[50:31] there would be a returning to Eden
[50:33] before the fall
[50:35] something would have to come. A seed of
[50:37] a woman would have to come in order to
[50:40] in in order to fulfill the scriptures in
[50:42] order to pay the price for our sins. And
[50:44] he and he and and and that the seed of
[50:46] the woman would come and and it would
[50:48] destroy Satan.
[50:51] But then Satan would also be able to
[50:53] attack him. And we find that in the life
[50:56] of Jesus Christ. But he goes on he said
[50:58] and in verse 60 and unto the woman he
[51:00] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[51:02] and thy corruption and sorrow thou shalt
[51:04] bring forth children and the desire
[51:05] shall be to thy husband and he shall
[51:07] rule over thee. And you know when we
[51:09] when we read that verse and
[51:12] in India because they were ruled by
[51:15] kings
[51:16] every man feels he is the king of his
[51:19] home which means everything in his home
[51:22] is subservant to him.
[51:24] And sometimes they rule as a king. Not
[51:27] always as a righteous king, but they
[51:29] rule as a king. But when you begin to
[51:32] read this here and and he says and he
[51:34] says, "The man shall rule over thee."
[51:37] When you begin to look at that and you
[51:38] begin to look at Jesus Christ, you begin
[51:40] to look at his our relationship with
[51:42] him. When when she was no longer
[51:45] co-equal with Adam, now Adam had the
[51:48] total responsibility for his wife.
[51:51] That's right. That's right.
[51:53] He had to provide for her. He had to
[51:55] protect her. He had to take care of her.
[51:56] Had to cherish her. You go in in in Paul
[52:01] talks about it in in Ephesians. He says
[52:03] how the the man's supposed to love his
[52:04] wife and cherish. We we are to love our
[52:07] wives and so much so that as Jesus
[52:09] Christ gave his gave his life for for
[52:12] his wife, which is us, we need to be
[52:14] willing to give our lives for our wives.
[52:18] We are in my opinion we are the man is
[52:21] totally responsible for his house.
[52:24] Totally responsible. There's only one
[52:26] form of labor that man cannot perform
[52:28] and that's delivery of a child.
[52:31] When I when I've expressed this to
[52:33] India, I mean there are times when
[52:34] Shirley was so sick she couldn't do
[52:36] anything. Okay, somebody had to do
[52:39] laundry, somebody had to wash the
[52:40] dishes, somebody had to clean the house,
[52:42] somebody had to take care of this, that
[52:43] and the other. Well, that's my function.
[52:46] I am responsible for the house.
[52:50] I am responsible for my family. And so
[52:53] when she's unable, I have to say I have
[52:56] to step up to the plate and I have to
[52:58] fulfill normally what I what I would
[53:00] anticipate her to fulfill. But the
[53:03] responsibility still right still rests
[53:05] on me.
[53:08] I mean I am responsible. I mean that I
[53:11] can't think of it any other way. And and
[53:13] but here again we we have to begin to
[53:15] and Jesus Christ is responsible for us.
[53:19] He has to take care of us. He has to
[53:21] cherish us. He has to watch over us. He
[53:22] has to provide for us. He is our
[53:24] protector. He is our guider. He's the
[53:26] one who watches over us. He's the one
[53:27] who leads and guides us. I mean that is
[53:29] his responsibility to us. I mean he died
[53:32] so that he might redeem us. That's
[53:33] right.
[53:34] Well so we we see the types. We we begin
[53:37] to see the shadows. But but like I say,
[53:39] when when you when I look at a husband
[53:40] and a wife and their relationship and I
[53:42] see how he is ruling his his family, I
[53:45] say it's not by law.
[53:48] No, it's by love.
[53:50] It's not you commanding somebody else to
[53:52] do something. It's you by love
[53:55] interacting with them. I mean, there has
[53:57] to be correction with children. Don't
[53:58] don't don't get me wrong on that score.
[54:00] But but we rule the house by love. I
[54:02] mean, this is something I've had to
[54:03] learn over time. Okay? I I mean when we
[54:07] got married I was the head you know um
[54:11] but over time I began to realize
[54:13] headship requires there's responsibility
[54:16] and the more the longer we've been
[54:18] living and and the I mean we've had
[54:19] difficulties in our marriage
[54:22] but in those difficulties it has taught
[54:24] me my responsibilities
[54:27] and anyway and lots of I have learned to
[54:30] fit into that most of the time. So,
[54:35] and then it goes into Adam said because
[54:36] you have done this thing that um
[54:40] anyway so the the the earth was the
[54:43] earth was cursed because of Adam. So now
[54:45] the earth would no longer bring forth
[54:47] its fullness. Now he had to actually
[54:48] work and labor in order to be able to
[54:50] feed for himself. But when you begin to
[54:53] understand
[54:54] when Adam fell, he lost the title deed
[54:59] that went back to God in the book and I
[55:03] don't know how to explain the book, but
[55:04] he said in the book was also all the
[55:06] names of all God's children that were to
[55:08] come into manifestation.
[55:10] So God took the book. Adam, Satan could
[55:13] not take it because he had no rights to
[55:15] it. So God had to watch over down
[55:17] through time to make sure that all of
[55:19] his children came into manifestation.
[55:21] That's right.
[55:22] And then he had to watch over them. He
[55:24] had to lead them and he had to guide
[55:25] them so they could fulfill God's plan
[55:27] for their lives.
[55:29] Um and then when you begin to understand
[55:31] that the title deed
[55:34] well when you get into into into
[55:36] Revelation, John, you eat the book.
[55:40] What is the book? The title deed of
[55:42] redemption. The title deed to the earth.
[55:44] title deed to the rulership. So where is
[55:46] this title deed now?
[55:49] In us.
[55:50] Everything Adam lost as a result of the
[55:53] fall, we possess.
[55:56] But it'll only operate on our ability to
[55:58] believe it.
[56:00] The more that you understand God, the
[56:02] more you can take and you can begin to
[56:04] to apprehend and and and and over time I
[56:07] I mean I've seen this manifested in
[56:09] different in different occasions. I know
[56:11] we were in Jamaica once and there was a
[56:13] hur tornado hurricane that was coming
[56:16] and it was going to go right over the
[56:17] top of us and we all prayed
[56:21] and we said well Lord if it comes right
[56:23] over the top of us
[56:26] there can be a lot of destruction. So
[56:28] Lord will you just kind of move it for
[56:30] us. We didn't ask for it to go away. We
[56:32] just asked to move. So instead of taking
[56:34] discourage all of a sudden it made a
[56:35] jog.
[56:37] Praise God. because that's the power we
[56:40] have.
[56:42] I know I was with my brother in
[56:43] Arkansas, I think it was, or one of
[56:45] those states down there. There was a
[56:47] tornado coming and we saw it coming and
[56:50] we looked for a place where could we go?
[56:52] Where could we hide? What could we grab
[56:53] hold of? And so I just says, "Well,
[56:56] Lord, just let it go around us." So it
[56:59] went from one to two, went around us,
[57:01] joined back together, and continued on
[57:03] its journey.
[57:05] I'm not trying to brag, but I'm merely
[57:07] trying to say that power we have.
[57:11] But and sometimes when we pray, we we
[57:13] don't realize what we are praying. We
[57:15] don't realize that here again it's God
[57:16] using our voice to be able to speak to
[57:18] be able to to achieve what we want. But
[57:20] you know, I began to apply that in other
[57:22] areas of my life. If I get up in the
[57:25] morning and aches and pains that come
[57:26] with um maturing,
[57:29] um I can look at myself and I can say,
[57:32] "Oh, it's going to be a terrible day. Oh
[57:34] man. Oh yeah. Oh, I overdid it
[57:36] yesterday. Oh, it's gonna be a horrible,
[57:38] horrible, horrible day. Well, I've just
[57:40] spoke it. Enjoy it.
[57:42] But I get up even with the eggs, same
[57:44] aches and pains. I say, "God has given
[57:45] me another day to enjoy him.
[57:48] God has given me another day to enjoy
[57:49] his presence, another day to worship
[57:51] him, another day to get into the word,
[57:53] another day to see his beauty all around
[57:55] me." And so now I've spoken that I
[57:58] expect a good day
[58:00] because I spoke it.
[58:01] Amen. Whatever I speak, that's what I
[58:04] expect.
[58:06] Anyway,
[58:09] when we go back in here again, when we
[58:11] begin to look at Adam and Eve and we
[58:13] begin to understand what God did in the
[58:14] as a result of the fall,
[58:18] God desired fellowship for his with his
[58:21] family.
[58:23] When they had sinned, that separated the
[58:25] fellowship.
[58:26] So, what did God do? It says in in
[58:28] Genesis 3:21, "And unto Adam also and
[58:31] his wife did the Lord God make coats of
[58:33] skins and clothe them,
[58:36] God showed his whole plan of redemption
[58:39] right there.
[58:41] They had sinned." So God went and he
[58:44] took a lamb, probably two of them. He
[58:47] slew the lamb and even while the while
[58:49] the coats were bloody, he threw them
[58:52] over there and the men and and Adam and
[58:54] his Eve wrapped themselves in the in the
[58:56] sacrifice.
[58:59] When the way brother Brandham describes
[59:01] it as Adam and Eve were leaving the
[59:03] garden, the blood was still flowing. God
[59:07] would look at it and the blood something
[59:09] had died in order to cover their sins.
[59:13] And then he would look at the at the
[59:14] outer covering of a lamb the wife. And
[59:17] so when they went out, yeah, God could
[59:19] see the sacrifice had been made.
[59:22] But now all he saw was the sacrifice.
[59:25] But see, that's our relationship.
[59:28] Brother Brandham says God hears our
[59:30] voice speaking through the blood. That's
[59:32] right.
[59:33] It's not about us.
[59:35] And that's one of the thing, another
[59:36] thing I've had to learn. It has nothing
[59:38] to do with me.
[59:40] It's not me striving. I cannot be I
[59:42] cannot live a Christian life
[59:45] first to admit that.
[59:47] But he shed his blood to cover my
[59:49] mistakes
[59:50] to pay for my sins to pay for my
[59:52] shortcomings. And so he look he doesn't
[59:55] look at me. He looks at the sacrifice.
[59:57] And as long as I remain in the
[59:59] sacrifice,
[1:00:00] his shed his blood covers me. It's when
[1:00:03] I step outside of the shed outside of
[1:00:06] the sacrifice that's when problems
[1:00:09] start. When I start walking in my own
[1:00:11] knowledge, when I start walking after my
[1:00:13] own desires, when all of a sudden Satan
[1:00:15] tempts me and I go wandering away from
[1:00:16] where I shouldn't go, all of a sudden
[1:00:18] now I'm in Satan's kingdom.
[1:00:21] Yeah. And this is another thought. It's
[1:00:23] take it for what it's worth. I began to
[1:00:26] think about this thought.
[1:00:29] We live in Satan's Eden.
[1:00:32] Okay, that's his kingdom. Yes.
[1:00:36] But when I accepted Jesus Christ, I was
[1:00:39] translated out of his kingdom into the
[1:00:42] kingdom of Jesus Christ.
[1:00:45] And so I began to think about that when
[1:00:47] I am in America, the laws of America
[1:00:48] apply. When I go to India, the laws of
[1:00:50] India apply. And if I stay in Satan's
[1:00:54] kingdom, the laws of Satan's kingdom
[1:00:56] apply. But when I move into into into
[1:01:00] the kingdom of Jesus Christ, now there's
[1:01:02] another set of laws which apply.
[1:01:05] And so whenever I'm in his kingdom,
[1:01:10] I expect his kingdom. I expect his
[1:01:12] angels. I expect God. I expect whatever,
[1:01:14] however you want to put it. I says,
[1:01:16] "Well, Lord, I'm going to be going on a
[1:01:18] trip now, and I want your kingdom to
[1:01:20] guide me. I want your kingdom around me.
[1:01:21] I want the angels around me, front,
[1:01:23] back, and sides, and everywhere it has
[1:01:25] to be. I don't want to be in Satan's
[1:01:27] kingdom."
[1:01:28] That's right.
[1:01:28] I want to be in a different kingdom.
[1:01:31] Amen.
[1:01:31] And I and I'm becoming more and more
[1:01:33] aware as long as I want to be in his
[1:01:35] kingdom, he'll be there.
[1:01:38] We sing songs of worship and praise.
[1:01:40] Why? To create an atmosphere where he is
[1:01:42] welcome. And so whenever we're having
[1:01:45] some problems, what do we do? We just
[1:01:46] start singing songs. God inhabits the
[1:01:49] praise of his people. So if I sing songs
[1:01:51] of worship and praise and all of a
[1:01:53] sudden I say, "Satan, if you want to
[1:01:54] hear me praise God, just just stick
[1:01:56] around for a while. But I'm not going to
[1:01:57] change. I'm going to praise my God
[1:01:59] because I want him.
[1:02:01] And generally Satan gets tired of me
[1:02:03] listening to my worship. And so he he
[1:02:05] takes off and then God comes in. We have
[1:02:06] a wonderful time of fellowship. But I
[1:02:08] mean that there's a simplicity in all of
[1:02:10] this. It's not as difficult as we try to
[1:02:13] make it.
[1:02:15] If we could begin to understand what God
[1:02:17] did for us at the cross, when we can
[1:02:19] begin to understand the magnitude of the
[1:02:20] love of God expressed to us at Calvary,
[1:02:23] that changes the whole thing.
[1:02:24] That's right.
[1:02:30] Let's see if I got the next one. Okay, I
[1:02:33] found this interesting.
[1:02:36] But brother Chad had mentioned this in
[1:02:37] passing in one of in one of his sermons.
[1:02:40] It says in Revelations 13, it says, "And
[1:02:42] it was given unto him to make war with
[1:02:44] the saints and to overcome them. And
[1:02:47] power was given unto him over all the
[1:02:49] kinds and tongues and nations." So
[1:02:51] that's Satan Esen. Okay. And all that
[1:02:53] dwell upon the earth shall worship him
[1:02:55] whose names were are not written in the
[1:02:59] book of life of the lamb slain from the
[1:03:01] from the foundation of the world. Satan
[1:03:04] ruling and Satan can defeat and Satan
[1:03:07] will war against us because God has
[1:03:09] given him that permission.
[1:03:11] But it says the the world will worship
[1:03:15] him whose names are not written in the
[1:03:18] book of the life of the lamb.
[1:03:21] Satan cannot totally defeat us
[1:03:24] because God will not allow us to be
[1:03:26] totally defeated.
[1:03:29] And and we go when we and normally we
[1:03:31] talk about the you know the the lamb's
[1:03:33] book of life but here it's written
[1:03:34] different the book of the life of the
[1:03:37] lamb.
[1:03:38] Amen.
[1:03:39] And as I as I was dwelling on that
[1:03:42] thought I began to realize as I read
[1:03:44] through the Bible now yeah the life of
[1:03:47] the lamb was expressed in Moses. The
[1:03:49] life of the lamb was expressed in Noah.
[1:03:51] The life of the lamb was expressed in
[1:03:52] David. The life of the lamb was
[1:03:54] expressed in all these other different
[1:03:55] characters in the Bible. Well, where is
[1:03:57] the life of the lamb now?
[1:04:00] Here,
[1:04:02] in us. We are to be the expression of
[1:04:05] the life of the lamb because that's the
[1:04:08] seed that is in us. That is what God has
[1:04:12] placed in us so that his life can now
[1:04:14] come to expression through it. Will
[1:04:16] Satan battle us? Yeah, he will.
[1:04:19] Satan, God gave him permission, but
[1:04:21] Satan cannot defeat us.
[1:04:24] We listen, I listen, Brother Brandham at
[1:04:26] the time when at at the real low point
[1:04:28] in his life, his wife had died and there
[1:04:30] he was out there with his with his baby
[1:04:32] and and and and say and brother Brandham
[1:04:34] was trying to intercede for the life of
[1:04:36] his child. And then Satan began to work
[1:04:39] on his mind. Oh yeah, here you are.
[1:04:40] You've done this and you've done that.
[1:04:42] Listen, God won't even listen to you.
[1:04:44] Look at that. You've done you've
[1:04:45] sacrificed your life. Everybody thinks
[1:04:47] you're a fanatic. everything's this that
[1:04:48] and the other and and and and brother
[1:04:50] Brandham he was agreeing. Yeah, it's
[1:04:52] true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:04:56] But then all of a sudden he said
[1:04:57] something kicked in.
[1:05:00] God has given.
[1:05:02] God has taken.
[1:05:04] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:05:07] He had to go through that to begin to
[1:05:09] realize. He had to go through that be
[1:05:12] because God was trying to express and to
[1:05:14] show him something and it wasn't easy
[1:05:16] for him at all. But here again we come
[1:05:19] down in in our lives in the things that
[1:05:21] we go through. See Satan could not
[1:05:24] defeat brother Brandham.
[1:05:26] He could discourage him. He could try
[1:05:28] him. He could do all these other one
[1:05:30] other things. But because he was part of
[1:05:33] the life of the lamb
[1:05:35] because his name was written in the
[1:05:37] book. Satan did not have the power to
[1:05:41] defeat brother Brown.
[1:05:44] At least that's how I that's how I read
[1:05:46] this.
[1:05:47] And so here again, we go through our
[1:05:49] struggles. We go through our problems.
[1:05:52] But the life of the lamb is here. My
[1:05:54] name is in that book.
[1:05:57] Satan, yeah, he can try me. He can
[1:05:59] discourage me. He can do all these other
[1:06:01] other things that he that he does, but
[1:06:03] he will never be able to defeat me
[1:06:05] because there's a life inside of me that
[1:06:07] is keeping me.
[1:06:09] And brother Brandham realized that Job
[1:06:11] had to realize that all when you when
[1:06:13] you look at at the life of Job and so we
[1:06:16] have to begin well will Satan will Satan
[1:06:18] tempt us? Will he try and make make us
[1:06:20] discouraged? Yeah, he will. That's his
[1:06:22] job.
[1:06:23] But see, we there's something inside of
[1:06:25] us that is greater that has more power
[1:06:27] than him.
[1:06:27] Amen. And what has more power than him
[1:06:30] is is the Elohim, the all powerful
[1:06:32] self-existing one who lives inside of
[1:06:34] me. And when I begin to realize what
[1:06:37] what is attacking me and I begin to
[1:06:38] realize I am in a pickle. I says, "Well,
[1:06:40] Lord, you dwell here.
[1:06:44] And now I need you.
[1:06:47] I cannot take care of this problem.
[1:06:50] I'm giving you
[1:06:51] and then I leave it."
[1:06:54] Sometimes that's the problem. we we even
[1:06:56] after we give it we take it back and we
[1:06:58] carry it home with us but once you can
[1:07:01] take and you just put it in his hands
[1:07:02] and says Lord you you take care of this
[1:07:04] I can't when we were in India there were
[1:07:06] circumstances we came across and if it
[1:07:08] had not been for the grace of God we
[1:07:10] would not be here
[1:07:12] but I began to realize I'm here be I'm
[1:07:15] there doing what I believe to be the
[1:07:17] will of God and if I am in the will of
[1:07:20] God I believe I'm I believe God is
[1:07:23] responsible to take care of me to lead
[1:07:24] me and to guide me and and and and and
[1:07:26] all of those things. Yes, sir.
[1:07:28] And so then I put it in him.
[1:07:30] Amen.
[1:07:30] I says, "Lord, we're in a pickle. If
[1:07:33] we're going to get out of this, you have
[1:07:35] to do it because we can't." And he
[1:07:37] always comes.
[1:07:38] Yes, sir.
[1:07:39] He always intercedes. He always provides
[1:07:41] the way.
[1:07:42] But see, now this has to come down in
[1:07:44] all of our lives. We have to begin to
[1:07:46] real what dwells in us. God does.
[1:07:48] Elohim, the all powerful, all
[1:07:50] sufficient, eternal existing one. He
[1:07:53] spoke and the worlds came into
[1:07:54] manifestation.
[1:07:56] Praise God.
[1:07:57] Is there anything he can't do?
[1:08:00] But we have to let him.
[1:08:04] Okay.
[1:08:11] When we begin to look at this and the
[1:08:12] masterpiece, brother Brandham goes on,
[1:08:14] he says, "This masterpiece was walled by
[1:08:16] the word of God, God's word, and the
[1:08:18] masterpiece itself of the family was
[1:08:19] fortified by this word. But the broken
[1:08:22] part that was speaking of Eve went off
[1:08:24] the original went out beyond the wall
[1:08:26] and give Satan a chance to mar it. But
[1:08:29] the great sculpture when he had seen the
[1:08:31] fall of his family, the masterpiece, he
[1:08:33] wasn't willing to let it lay there and
[1:08:35] face down and ruin. He went to work
[1:08:36] immediately to build it up again. He
[1:08:39] wasn't willing that it should perish. He
[1:08:40] lay there like all that time because he
[1:08:42] is God and he is not and he will not be
[1:08:45] defeated. So we went to work immediately
[1:08:48] to begin to build again uh in his own
[1:08:51] image. I I know we were last time we
[1:08:54] were in India I was given some food and
[1:08:56] it disagreed with me. Um so I I did it
[1:09:00] because the brother kind of you know you
[1:09:02] got to eat something. Well okay. Well
[1:09:05] well whatever I ate didn't agree. So we
[1:09:07] got half about an hour later I had to
[1:09:09] stand and preach. And uh after about 15
[1:09:13] minutes into it, I had to leave the
[1:09:16] pulpit and go outside and get rid of
[1:09:18] some things. And uh and I sat there for
[1:09:23] five minutes or so and I said, "Satan,
[1:09:26] you're not going to win this."
[1:09:29] And they said, "Oh, do you want us to
[1:09:30] take you home? Want to take you to the
[1:09:32] No, I want to finish this." Praise God.
[1:09:35] And so I went back, stood up in the
[1:09:37] pulpit, and I preached for another 45
[1:09:38] minutes.
[1:09:40] Because I was not going to let Satan
[1:09:42] win.
[1:09:44] I was determined, stubborn, in order to
[1:09:47] make it so that Satan could not be able
[1:09:49] to defeat me.
[1:09:51] When I was done and I sat down, I
[1:09:54] realized I didn't have enough strength
[1:09:56] to stand up again.
[1:09:58] Okay, that's fine. So, somebody else had
[1:10:01] to lead me to the car. Somebody else had
[1:10:02] to help me get into the Okay. But see, I
[1:10:05] was not going to let that Satan defeat
[1:10:07] me.
[1:10:09] Something inside of me is stronger than
[1:10:11] him and Satan.
[1:10:12] That's right.
[1:10:13] And so I began I had to rely upon him. I
[1:10:16] mean, to get back up on the pulpit and
[1:10:18] pick up the inspiration where you left
[1:10:20] off and be able to finish the message
[1:10:21] which God had given to you. Yeah, that's
[1:10:23] that that that's difficult.
[1:10:25] Okay. Because all of a sudden you're
[1:10:26] fighting all these other urges within
[1:10:28] your body. But I had to rely upon the
[1:10:31] God to come and re and take repossession
[1:10:33] of me
[1:10:34] so that he could so that he could finish
[1:10:36] delivering to the people what he wanted
[1:10:39] said.
[1:10:40] Amen.
[1:10:40] And so here here again we have to begin
[1:10:42] to understand who is it that is in us.
[1:10:45] That's right.
[1:10:46] It's Elohim the all powerful all
[1:10:48] sufficient all the the the one who
[1:10:50] created all things. The one which in
[1:10:52] which nothing is impossible.
[1:10:55] So that's who we have to turn our
[1:10:57] reliance to.
[1:10:58] Amen. Not relying on us.
[1:11:01] No, relying on him. Yes, sir.
[1:11:04] Anyway, sir,
[1:11:11] so we begin to understand when God had
[1:11:13] created Adam and Eve and and there was
[1:11:15] the fall in the garden,
[1:11:17] God had to God took possession of the of
[1:11:19] the title deed, God had to watch over
[1:11:21] and make sure his seed would come into
[1:11:23] manifestation from that point until the
[1:11:26] time that Christ came.
[1:11:28] He God came and he and he and and he
[1:11:30] created a new dispensation in in in when
[1:11:33] when God had God had tried by different
[1:11:36] covenants. He tried to to covenant and
[1:11:39] and u anyway man always man could never
[1:11:42] man cannot obey God. We always this gets
[1:11:46] in our way
[1:11:48] when you look from the time of the
[1:11:49] creation and the fall and you begin to
[1:11:51] look at how how it progressed into Noah.
[1:11:55] All of a sudden, all the thoughts of men
[1:11:57] were sinful and and and God says, "I'm
[1:11:59] going to wipe this out." So God appeared
[1:12:01] to a man named Noah. Noah, I want you to
[1:12:03] build an ark for the saving of you and
[1:12:05] your household.
[1:12:08] This is out where there's no water.
[1:12:10] I'm going to build a huge boat
[1:12:13] and ain't no place to float it.
[1:12:16] But he had to be. He was obedient to
[1:12:19] God.
[1:12:20] because of his obedience, he brought
[1:12:22] salvation to his family and also to the
[1:12:25] to the animals that God brought into the
[1:12:26] ark.
[1:12:28] But then we go on and then then God
[1:12:30] established another couple of other
[1:12:32] covenants. And God be got he already
[1:12:35] knew but he realized for lack of a
[1:12:37] better way of putting it. He realized
[1:12:38] man cannot keep covenants right
[1:12:41] because of the nature that we have that
[1:12:43] lives within us.
[1:12:46] So God took Abraham Abram
[1:12:49] and God appeared to Abra Abram and and
[1:12:52] and made a promise to him. He says, "I
[1:12:55] want you to go and I want to I want you
[1:12:57] to I want to direct you. I want to take
[1:12:59] you to another land away from your
[1:13:00] family, away from your associates, away
[1:13:02] from everything you're familiar with. I
[1:13:04] want to take you to another land and I'm
[1:13:06] going to give you that land."
[1:13:08] Abraham was willing to obey and follow.
[1:13:12] Actually, there was a pilgrimage from
[1:13:14] from the city he was living in. There
[1:13:16] was a pil there was a pilgrimage there.
[1:13:18] There was other there was other people
[1:13:20] going from where he was living into
[1:13:22] Palestine. He got into there and there
[1:13:24] was a midst of a famine. And he looked
[1:13:26] at and God says, "Yeah, this is the
[1:13:27] land." He looks around and says, "Uh,
[1:13:31] okay, but uh there's a famine here right
[1:13:33] now." So, he turned it on into Egypt.
[1:13:37] Well, Egypt implies your flesh. Egypt
[1:13:40] implies the world.
[1:13:43] And so God through circumstances forced
[1:13:46] him back into the promised land. And God
[1:13:49] kept trying him and trying him because
[1:13:52] God was trying to recreate this
[1:13:54] masterpiece. He was trying to find a man
[1:13:57] which would totally rely upon him that
[1:13:59] God could so live in him until God could
[1:14:01] express himself through him.
[1:14:04] And so God came and and and and so God
[1:14:06] came and he made a covenant with Abraham
[1:14:09] when Abraham was sitting there and they
[1:14:11] Abraham had offered sacrifices and God
[1:14:14] came down and in the midst of that
[1:14:16] sacrifice God's spirit came in in
[1:14:18] between the sacrifices the pieces and
[1:14:21] God told Abraham he says your your seed
[1:14:24] is going to sojourn in the strange land
[1:14:25] for 400 years and after that I will
[1:14:28] bring them out.
[1:14:30] Okay. And Abraham believed God. So
[1:14:33] that's why Abraham is the father of
[1:14:34] faith. But then we go and we begin to
[1:14:37] look at Moses
[1:14:39] 400 years after the after God had made
[1:14:42] the made the promise to Abraham. God God
[1:14:45] brought forth a Moses.
[1:14:47] Moses was Moses when you begin to look
[1:14:49] at his life, God God hid him away. God
[1:14:52] protected him. God watched over him.
[1:14:54] See, God does not have a plan B.
[1:14:59] Okay? We we are plan A.
[1:15:01] That's right.
[1:15:03] If you don't do what God directs you to
[1:15:05] do, there is no plan B.
[1:15:09] You can stop God.
[1:15:14] There we had a brother in our church and
[1:15:16] he had an infection or he had a surgery
[1:15:18] on his elbow and u surgeons did the best
[1:15:22] they could. He got an infection in it.
[1:15:24] They treated with the antibiotics that
[1:15:25] they put all the doctors would have they
[1:15:27] figured that would have cured you know
[1:15:29] taken care of the infection. The
[1:15:31] infection got worse. They had to open it
[1:15:33] up and drain it, pump it flu fluids and
[1:15:35] whatever else. And then God spoke to me.
[1:15:38] Go pray for him.
[1:15:41] Why not the pastor? Why not the deacon?
[1:15:44] Why not these other people that have a
[1:15:47] quote unquote higher position within the
[1:15:49] church? And God says, "No, you go. I
[1:15:53] don't like driving into Charlotte.
[1:15:55] Traffic there is terrible. And that
[1:15:58] hospital has a conglomeration of
[1:16:00] buildings. I can't find even find my way
[1:16:03] out the front door sometimes, you know.
[1:16:06] But if I had not gone,
[1:16:10] God maybe he would have found another
[1:16:12] way, but he instructed me to go
[1:16:15] and if I did not go, the plan of God
[1:16:17] could not have been fulfilled.
[1:16:20] So I I was obedient. I went and we I
[1:16:23] visited with him and and uh he looked at
[1:16:26] me and I mean we were friends. It's not
[1:16:27] like we were enemies or anything, but he
[1:16:29] looked at me. He says, "Why are you
[1:16:30] here?" Um cuz he knows I don't like the
[1:16:34] driving Charlotte and stuff. And uh he I
[1:16:37] says, "God sent me here."
[1:16:40] Oh, I says, "We're not dealing with a
[1:16:42] physical problem. We're dealing with a
[1:16:44] spiritual problem."
[1:16:46] And so God sent me here to rebuke that
[1:16:48] spirit that's in your elbow causing the
[1:16:49] infection.
[1:16:51] Because I knew God had sent me, I knew
[1:16:54] God would hear my prayer.
[1:16:56] And so when I began to pray, the
[1:16:58] anointing was there. God answered the
[1:17:00] prayer and that be the affection began
[1:17:02] to leave.
[1:17:03] But see, I had to be willing to be
[1:17:06] obedient.
[1:17:08] Well, when God directs you, you have to
[1:17:10] be willing to be obedient.
[1:17:16] We sing the song where's God that I I
[1:17:18] don't can't remember the song that we
[1:17:19] sang you just before I came out but God
[1:17:22] light God's guiding hand. Okay. It's
[1:17:24] always his guiding hand. That's right.
[1:17:27] And he's always guiding us to fulfill
[1:17:29] what he wants.
[1:17:30] That's right.
[1:17:31] You know when when when we another
[1:17:33] minister mentioned he was talking about
[1:17:35] um when when when um Joshua they after
[1:17:40] they had gone over over the river Jordan
[1:17:41] there was there they had to they had to
[1:17:43] take Jericho. Jericho was the necessity.
[1:17:46] So he got up there in a mountain and he
[1:17:48] was overlooking the city and and no um
[1:17:53] and all of a sudden he felt a presence.
[1:17:55] He drew his sword and looked at this
[1:17:58] being that was standing there. Are you
[1:18:00] for us or for the enemy? And actually
[1:18:02] when you read it he says I'm not for
[1:18:04] either one.
[1:18:06] I am here to make sure that the plan of
[1:18:08] God is fulfilled.
[1:18:12] Oh, okay. Okay. So, what's the plan?
[1:18:17] H.
[1:18:18] So, then Joshua goes back and meets with
[1:18:21] the heads of the of the military. Okay,
[1:18:24] Josh, what's the plan? What's the plan?
[1:18:25] How are we going to are we going to go a
[1:18:26] frontal assault? We're going to sit
[1:18:28] there batter ram. He says, "No, you
[1:18:30] know, we want to be good neighbors.
[1:18:33] We'll just sit there. We'll get up in
[1:18:34] the morning. We'll have a nice breakfast
[1:18:37] and then we'll just quietly walk around
[1:18:39] the city and then we'll come home, take
[1:18:42] our siesta, sit back, relax, get back,
[1:18:44] enjoy the day.
[1:18:47] Uh Joshua, you've been out in the sun
[1:18:48] too long.
[1:18:51] But see, this was God's plan.
[1:18:54] They had to be obedient to what God
[1:18:57] directed.
[1:18:59] And when they were obedient to way God
[1:19:01] directed, they went seven times around
[1:19:02] the city. They gave a shout. the walls
[1:19:04] fell down and they and they attacked
[1:19:05] from all sides.
[1:19:09] Mentally, Joshua could never have
[1:19:11] figured out that's how you're going to
[1:19:13] take the city.
[1:19:14] That's right.
[1:19:15] God came because God wanted to receive
[1:19:18] the glory for the for the victory.
[1:19:20] That's right.
[1:19:21] And so here again, we have to begin to
[1:19:23] understand sometimes we come into our
[1:19:25] own problems. We sometime we have our
[1:19:27] own situations and we're always fighting
[1:19:29] these things. But see, God has a plan.
[1:19:32] If we do it ourselves then we can point
[1:19:34] to us.
[1:19:36] Look what I've done. Hey, you know um I
[1:19:39] know when we were in India one of the
[1:19:41] brothers from he from Cloverdale came
[1:19:43] down. He was surprised we have so many
[1:19:45] messages available in the Telugu
[1:19:47] language. He said oh man he says he says
[1:19:49] this is your ministry. This is a
[1:19:51] crowning thing. This is this is all the
[1:19:53] glory that you're receiving. I says give
[1:19:55] me a break man. I'm just a mule that
[1:19:57] carries the fo the the food so that they
[1:19:59] you know they can go ahead the money in
[1:20:01] this case so they can go ahead and
[1:20:02] accomplish what they have the desire to
[1:20:04] fulfill.
[1:20:05] That's right.
[1:20:05] The desire was in them. They needed the
[1:20:07] means. They needed the cash. So I bought
[1:20:11] some.
[1:20:14] I never took possession. I never tried
[1:20:16] to direct.
[1:20:18] I was there to encourage. That's how I
[1:20:21] felt. That was my my my my position if
[1:20:24] you will. But over time, God has honored
[1:20:27] that
[1:20:28] and I still feel that, you know, why me?
[1:20:32] You know, why would you even bother
[1:20:33] sending me? There are other people that
[1:20:35] are a lot more confident. There are a
[1:20:37] lot of people that understand that, you
[1:20:39] know, I mean, I had my problems. There
[1:20:41] was a few times that I was anything but
[1:20:43] kind to the brother I was working with,
[1:20:45] and I had to actually call him up and
[1:20:48] apologize to him for me being anything
[1:20:50] but pleasant.
[1:20:52] um because I was frustrated with them
[1:20:54] because their culture is different than
[1:20:55] our culture.
[1:20:58] I'm of the opinion if we're going to get
[1:20:59] it done, let's do it.
[1:21:02] They're of opinion, well, there's always
[1:21:04] tomorrow.
[1:21:09] So then that the following time year
[1:21:11] when I went I I began what fr why do I
[1:21:16] react the way I react? Why does all my
[1:21:18] flesh come out to full manifestation?
[1:21:21] And I began to realize I became
[1:21:23] frustrated.
[1:21:25] And so when I went there, I be I I began
[1:21:28] and so when the frustration began to
[1:21:30] arise, all of a sudden God reminded me
[1:21:32] this is their culture.
[1:21:34] This is their people. This is how they
[1:21:37] think. They don't think American. No,
[1:21:39] no, they think Indian. Okay. So then I
[1:21:43] had to choose my words whenever I wanted
[1:21:45] to encourage them so that I could say it
[1:21:47] in a nice way. Okay.
[1:21:50] But here but here but we have to begin
[1:21:51] to understand God has a reason for doing
[1:21:53] what I mean I'm not a minister. I do not
[1:21:56] have a congregation. I don't have the
[1:21:58] responsibility of a congre. So when I
[1:22:00] went to India I we we spend anywhere
[1:22:01] from two to two and a half months.
[1:22:03] Yeah.
[1:22:05] And so when I am there for that length
[1:22:07] of time I can visit places that nobody
[1:22:08] else can. I can visit little villages. I
[1:22:11] can visit villages with have 20 or 30
[1:22:13] people
[1:22:14] when other ministers come, you know,
[1:22:16] because they have their own ministries
[1:22:18] and stuff like that. I mean, yeah, they
[1:22:20] expect to see a crowd. They expect to
[1:22:21] see four or 500 people at least, you
[1:22:23] know, and that's fine. I'm not I'm not
[1:22:25] throwing stones at that, but somebody
[1:22:27] has to reach the villages. Somebody has
[1:22:29] to reach the little people. Somebody has
[1:22:30] to be able to be concerned about those
[1:22:32] people. And okay, so that's that's the
[1:22:35] that's the that's the blank space that
[1:22:37] we we we filled in.
[1:22:40] But then we begin to look at Moses and
[1:22:42] what God had done through Moses.
[1:22:45] God Moses tried in his own way to to
[1:22:48] deliver the children of Israel. And when
[1:22:51] he tried in on his own efforts, he
[1:22:54] failed. And so God had to bring him to
[1:22:57] the backside of the desert and give him
[1:22:58] a hot-tempered wife to take him down a
[1:23:00] few notches.
[1:23:02] And he go out to the sheep and the goats
[1:23:04] just to get peace and quiet, I think.
[1:23:07] But God had to reduce him to the place
[1:23:10] where he had no confidence in himself.
[1:23:14] And when he got to that point, God
[1:23:16] appeared to him in a in in that
[1:23:18] theophony appeared to him in a bush as
[1:23:20] as a burning fire. And okay, Moses, now
[1:23:24] you're ready. Now you go back. Ready? I
[1:23:26] can't even speak straight. What do you
[1:23:28] mean ready? You know, so Moses argued
[1:23:31] until God actually got mad at him.
[1:23:34] No, there God did not have plan B. Moses
[1:23:36] was plan A. Moses was going to fulfill
[1:23:39] whether Moses wanted to or not. Okay.
[1:23:42] But here, but anyway, when to to take
[1:23:45] all of that, God in in his miraculous
[1:23:47] way, he showed miracles. I mean, he
[1:23:50] brought the plagues and all these other
[1:23:51] types of things. He showed there was a
[1:23:53] separation between the Egyptians and and
[1:23:55] the children of Abraham. And God finally
[1:23:58] he led them out brought them into
[1:24:01] brought them around Mount Si and there
[1:24:04] with through Moses ministry God
[1:24:06] delivered unto them a law and that law
[1:24:08] was created the priesthood and the
[1:24:10] beginning of that that was fine
[1:24:13] but then when you begin to go and you
[1:24:15] get into the book of Joshua and you
[1:24:16] begin to get into the book of Samuel you
[1:24:18] begin to understand that the priesthood
[1:24:19] had failed to instruct the people they
[1:24:22] had be it became a job.
[1:24:26] Okay. And then when you begin to look at
[1:24:28] the law, the law was man trying God. It
[1:24:31] was man trying to man was trying to to
[1:24:34] uh redeem himself by his own efforts.
[1:24:37] That's right.
[1:24:38] You can't do it. You cannot live
[1:24:39] godlike.
[1:24:41] You cannot live the life of God. Your
[1:24:43] flesh will not allow that.
[1:24:47] And so when you begin to look at that,
[1:24:48] when you begin to understand, I know
[1:24:50] when Samuel came up, um Samuel there was
[1:24:54] there had been a war with with the
[1:24:56] Philistines. The ark of the covenant was
[1:24:58] was taken and removed from from the
[1:25:00] holiest of holies and taken into the
[1:25:02] city of the Philistines.
[1:25:04] And you know the ark of the covenant
[1:25:07] never returned to the holiest of holies
[1:25:11] for the time that Samuel was there till
[1:25:13] all the during the time of Saul was
[1:25:14] there and wasn't and and even when David
[1:25:17] was there he never took it and put it
[1:25:18] back into the holiest of holies. He kept
[1:25:21] it a tent by his own house. But see, in
[1:25:24] order for the covenant of God to be
[1:25:26] fulfilled, in order for the sins of the
[1:25:28] people to be rolled over, the high
[1:25:30] priest had to take blood of the
[1:25:31] sacrifice and go into the holiest of
[1:25:33] holies and there sprinkle the blood.
[1:25:36] So that so that that part of the
[1:25:38] covenant was nullified
[1:25:42] because the high priest could not go in
[1:25:43] because the ark wasn't there. And even
[1:25:46] when when Solomon built the temple, it
[1:25:48] it was kind of made the way that God had
[1:25:51] designed it to be in the ar and the
[1:25:53] tabernacle of the wilderness. But um
[1:25:55] there was some variations and
[1:25:56] differences, but here again, at least
[1:25:57] the priest could go in there and
[1:25:59] sprinkle it. Anyway,
[1:26:03] but it goes on,
[1:26:07] let's see, this is
[1:26:12] he goes on in the masterpiece. He says,
[1:26:14] "Now the foundation is laid through
[1:26:16] faith, love, and grace, and to
[1:26:18] perfection through the patriarchs. Now
[1:26:20] the body work that came on into the
[1:26:22] great masterpiece was the prophets,
[1:26:24] which was the word. The prophets, not
[1:26:27] the law, the prophets, for the prophets
[1:26:30] was the vindicated word, which makes the
[1:26:32] body, not the patriarchs. The prophets,
[1:26:35] they were the word."
[1:26:38] And when we begin to understand now how
[1:26:40] God operates,
[1:26:42] God had to operate now through prophets.
[1:26:44] The priesthood had failed. The law had
[1:26:46] failed. The people would come and do
[1:26:47] their own thing. They all had different
[1:26:49] ideas and and and revelations of how God
[1:26:52] what God required and what God tried to
[1:26:54] do and stuff like that. So God had to
[1:26:56] send prophets to correct the people. And
[1:26:59] from that point on, from the time of of
[1:27:01] of Samuel all the way to Christ, it was
[1:27:04] through the prophets that God began to
[1:27:06] go and to instruct the people. And as
[1:27:08] long as the people obeyed what the
[1:27:10] prophet said, God blessed them. It's
[1:27:13] when they went their own way that that
[1:27:15] the problems began. I know there was one
[1:27:18] incident we read in the scriptures where
[1:27:20] God had instructed his prophet, "Go in
[1:27:21] there and bring an accusation or bring a
[1:27:23] judgment against this altter."
[1:27:26] And he and God told him, he says, "You
[1:27:28] go in there, you don't eat. You don't
[1:27:30] partake of anything. You go in, you do
[1:27:32] what you're supposed to do, and you get
[1:27:33] out." And so he went in there, he did
[1:27:36] what he was supposed to do, and somebody
[1:27:37] offered him something. He said, "No, no,
[1:27:38] God told me I couldn't do it." And so as
[1:27:41] he left, and he was resting under a tree
[1:27:43] and uh there was another prophet in the
[1:27:46] city and he said, "Oh, no. God spoke to
[1:27:48] me. You're supposed to come home and and
[1:27:51] eat at my house." And so, well, God
[1:27:54] spoke to you. Well, that that's great.
[1:27:56] Okay. So, he went back and he began to
[1:27:58] eat. And then God spoke to the prophet
[1:28:00] that had that had brought him into his
[1:28:02] house and says, "Because you've
[1:28:03] disobeyed me," he says, "you're going to
[1:28:05] die." And so, as as it went on, okay, he
[1:28:08] went he started leaving and going back
[1:28:10] home and lion came up and killed him.
[1:28:14] But it's interesting, okay, when when
[1:28:16] you begin when another prophet comes and
[1:28:19] tries to tell you something contrary to
[1:28:20] what you were taught, what God has had
[1:28:23] re revealed to you.
[1:28:25] You have to obey what God has revealed
[1:28:28] to you.
[1:28:30] You can't go with what some you cannot
[1:28:33] take somebody else's revelation. You
[1:28:34] cannot in in some regards, you cannot
[1:28:36] take somebody else's teaching or or or
[1:28:39] prophecy or what whatever the word is.
[1:28:42] God sent us a prophet.
[1:28:47] All of the all of the other prophets, if
[1:28:49] you will, of the different
[1:28:50] denominational systems, though, you
[1:28:52] know, they that is not what we
[1:28:54] concentrate on. We concentrate on what
[1:28:56] God has given to us through the prophet.
[1:28:59] And when we get a revelation of who we
[1:29:01] are and when we get a revelation of who
[1:29:03] he was, the prophet, then we can we can
[1:29:06] take and we can rest within the within
[1:29:08] the message that God has delivered unto
[1:29:09] us. We don't need other people's
[1:29:11] revelations. We don't need other
[1:29:13] people's understandings. What we need to
[1:29:15] do is get into the word and we take the
[1:29:16] word for what the word says.
[1:29:19] And as long as we say only what the
[1:29:20] prophet said, we're safe.
[1:29:22] That's when we add our own
[1:29:23] interpretation. We add our own
[1:29:25] translations. We add our own own mental
[1:29:27] capacities. When all of a sudden
[1:29:29] somebody else comes up with this
[1:29:30] marvelous revelation like that other
[1:29:31] prophet, you know, had a revelation. Oh
[1:29:33] yeah, you're supposed to come home. No,
[1:29:35] that's death. That's right.
[1:29:37] We have to stick with what God has given
[1:29:39] us through the prophet.
[1:29:44] But then when we begin to look at when
[1:29:46] we be we we continue to go on here and
[1:29:48] we begin to understand God was going to
[1:29:50] recreate the masterpiece. God was going
[1:29:52] to recreate. And so God had had down
[1:29:55] through the prophet down through the
[1:29:56] what we call the Old Testament. He had
[1:29:58] said how he would come. He would have to
[1:30:00] be of the seed of the woman. He would
[1:30:02] have to be of the seed of Abraham. He
[1:30:03] would have to be born under the law. so
[1:30:05] the laws of redemption could apply. He
[1:30:07] he had to take on he had to be be born
[1:30:09] in a certain lineage so he could take on
[1:30:11] so that he could become uh sit on
[1:30:13] David's throne in the millennium. So all
[1:30:15] these things had to have had to have
[1:30:17] been to take place and so and and so God
[1:30:20] took in place within Mary that what was
[1:30:22] necessary to bring forth a body that God
[1:30:24] had desired to live in.
[1:30:26] And when Jesus Christ was born, brother
[1:30:28] Brandham says he was God.
[1:30:31] He was a he was the manifestation of
[1:30:33] God. Isaiah 9:6, for unto us a child is
[1:30:36] born, unto us a son is given. The
[1:30:38] government shall be upon his shoulder.
[1:30:39] His name shall be called wonderful
[1:30:41] counselor of the mighty God, the
[1:30:42] everlasting father, the prince of peace.
[1:30:44] It goes on Isaiah 7:14, therefore the
[1:30:47] Lord himself shall give you a sign, be
[1:30:49] holy, a virgin, shall conceive and bear
[1:30:50] a son, and they shall call his name
[1:30:51] Emanuel, which is Elohim, existing with
[1:30:54] us.
[1:30:54] That's what Jesus Christ was. God
[1:30:56] created that body so he could come and
[1:30:58] so live in that body until he could
[1:31:00] express himself through that body.
[1:31:08] the perfect image, the God man, God
[1:31:11] immorphy. And it's this immorphy really
[1:31:14] that to me it kind of kind of makes
[1:31:16] everything understandable.
[1:31:18] God and God had the ability to change
[1:31:21] his form. God had the and he he appeared
[1:31:24] to Moses in a burning bush as a pillar
[1:31:27] of fire. He he he appeared to Moses and
[1:31:29] when he when he was talking to to Abra
[1:31:31] to Abraham and Sarah and there he was in
[1:31:34] the form of a man and you begin to go
[1:31:35] and you begin to look at there. So God
[1:31:37] immored God was changing his dwelling
[1:31:39] place. God was changing how he manifest
[1:31:41] and expressed himself. But in Jesus
[1:31:43] Christ he was Emanuel. He was God with
[1:31:45] us. He was father. He was he was Elohim
[1:31:47] in in all in all that that means.
[1:31:50] That's right. So he goes on on on he
[1:31:53] says god immorphy had changed from the
[1:31:56] supernatural to the vision and the
[1:31:58] vision was projected into the image and
[1:31:59] the image was smitten so that the
[1:32:01] supernatural could taste and the feeling
[1:32:04] of death god's perfect masterpiece. He
[1:32:06] could not do it in Moses. He could not
[1:32:08] do it in the prophets and Isaiah who was
[1:32:09] sought aunderder. Um but in this perfect
[1:32:12] masterpiece he was the he was the
[1:32:14] fullness of the godhead bodily. He could
[1:32:16] not only be project, he could not only
[1:32:19] project Moses, he could project his
[1:32:20] entire being into this person and taste
[1:32:23] death for the whole human race. God's
[1:32:25] perfect masterpiece. All the types was
[1:32:27] fulfilled in him. Our kinsman and
[1:32:28] redeemer and Ruth and Boaz and our
[1:32:30] lawgiver and from Mount Si and the
[1:32:32] prophets from the wilderness. So this is
[1:32:34] this is God. This is Jesus Christ.
[1:32:37] He was not the second person of a
[1:32:39] trinity, right?
[1:32:41] He was Emanuel. He he he was he was he
[1:32:43] was he was Elohim, the the
[1:32:45] allsufficient, all powerful,
[1:32:47] self-existing one. He created a body
[1:32:49] that he could come and so live in till
[1:32:51] he could express himself through that
[1:32:53] man.
[1:32:56] But now where is God dwelling now?
[1:33:00] Elohim, the all per the self-existing
[1:33:03] all powerful one, where does he dwell?
[1:33:06] In us.
[1:33:07] We are now him. Brother Brandham says
[1:33:10] she is him. Amen.
[1:33:12] Well, if we are him then then here again
[1:33:16] it's it's God changing his dwelling
[1:33:18] place. Now he's dwelling in us so that
[1:33:20] he can pro so that he can express
[1:33:22] himself in the same way that he
[1:33:23] expressed himself in Jesus Christ.
[1:33:35] There was a time in in Luke this in Luke
[1:33:37] 2:41 he begins to go about he says now
[1:33:39] his parents went to Jerusalem every year
[1:33:41] at the feast of the Passover and when he
[1:33:43] was 12 years old they went up to
[1:33:45] Jerusalem as the custom of their feast
[1:33:46] was when the days were fulfilled and as
[1:33:49] they returned the child Jesus terried
[1:33:51] behind in in Jerusalem and it came to
[1:33:54] pass after three days they found him in
[1:33:55] the temple sitting at the m in his midst
[1:33:57] of the doctors both hearing them and
[1:33:59] asking them questions and all that heard
[1:34:01] him were astonished at the understanding
[1:34:03] in his answers
[1:34:06] at the certain and in the Jewish
[1:34:08] religion when a person goes from 12 to
[1:34:10] 13 years of age they consider him a man
[1:34:13] if they need a minion they can take a 13
[1:34:15] year old stick him in the midst of them
[1:34:17] that that satisfies their their the
[1:34:20] requirements of of their law in order to
[1:34:22] have a certain number of people
[1:34:25] and so here again we look at Jesus he
[1:34:27] didn't go to seminary he didn't go Where
[1:34:29] did he get this knowledge? Brother
[1:34:31] Brandham says he went from theophony to
[1:34:34] flesh
[1:34:36] and in that form he knew all things. At
[1:34:39] what point did he know all things? At
[1:34:41] what point? But here here again we have
[1:34:43] to begin to understand.
[1:34:46] There was two parts for lack of a better
[1:34:48] way of putting it. There was two parts
[1:34:50] to Jesus Christ. The flesh was all man.
[1:34:54] All man. But in spirit he was all God.
[1:35:01] The flesh had to communicate to the God
[1:35:03] that was in it.
[1:35:06] And that flesh could only understand
[1:35:08] what the spirit in it would reveal to
[1:35:11] the flesh.
[1:35:13] Why did Jesus pray? He was trying to get
[1:35:16] in contact to the God that dwelt in him.
[1:35:19] He wanted to know the will of God. He
[1:35:22] wanted he wanted he wanted to fulfill
[1:35:24] the he wanted to fulfill what his father
[1:35:27] wanted him to do. If Jesus Christ had
[1:35:30] not if if Jesus Christ had sinned, he
[1:35:33] could not have become our kinsman
[1:35:34] redeemer.
[1:35:36] He had to be totally obedient to the God
[1:35:39] that was in him.
[1:35:41] If at every point he deviated, he
[1:35:44] sinned.
[1:35:45] At that point, he could not be our
[1:35:47] redeemer.
[1:35:50] But now we have to bring it to us.
[1:35:53] Who do we communicate with? Somebody
[1:35:55] asked asked I think brother Brandham he
[1:35:57] says brother Brandham you know because
[1:35:58] he you know he was trinitarian said well
[1:36:00] now that we're we understand the oneness
[1:36:02] of the godhead. He says who do we pray
[1:36:04] to? Brother says it's easy. You pray to
[1:36:07] the God that's in you.
[1:36:10] How far away is God?
[1:36:12] You know every it's hard for me to get
[1:36:14] away from myself
[1:36:16] because everywhere I go I go.
[1:36:19] That's right.
[1:36:20] Well, if he's in me, that means
[1:36:22] everywhere I go, he's stuck inside of
[1:36:23] me. Therefore, he has to go with me.
[1:36:27] If you follow and so he's never further
[1:36:29] away than I am from myself.
[1:36:32] But I have to be aware of that presence.
[1:36:36] I have to be some. Yeah. I mean, we go
[1:36:39] about brother Brandham in one place he
[1:36:40] says he says when the anointing was on
[1:36:42] Moses, then Moses was God.
[1:36:44] That's right. But when the anointing
[1:36:46] left, he says now Moses became Moses.
[1:36:50] Okay. Well, the same thing here. As long
[1:36:52] as the anointing is on us, yeah. Then
[1:36:54] we're God.
[1:36:56] When the anointing lifts and what are we
[1:36:58] back to what we were? Okay. I mean,
[1:37:01] there there's this transition and some
[1:37:02] and like like with the ministers, he
[1:37:04] says, he oh yeah, you preach on Sunday
[1:37:06] and all of a sudden the anointing is
[1:37:07] there and all, you know, all you're in
[1:37:09] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And he
[1:37:11] says, "Watch out for Monday because all
[1:37:14] of a sudden you return back to what you
[1:37:15] are."
[1:37:18] Okay? Because brother Bradam's ministry
[1:37:20] when he was sitting there discernment,
[1:37:21] all this other kind of stuff and they
[1:37:23] would have to take him outside and walk
[1:37:25] him around the blocks for a bunch of,
[1:37:26] you know, until finally get him home and
[1:37:28] then he would just cry. He did not he
[1:37:31] was able to live in both realms,
[1:37:34] right?
[1:37:34] And sometimes he didn't know which realm
[1:37:36] he was in
[1:37:37] brother Random expresses that.
[1:37:41] But see, we need to be aware of what
[1:37:43] realm we are in and then allow the God
[1:37:45] that is in us to express himself through
[1:37:48] us. Okay?
[1:37:57] Remember in flesh he was just a man, but
[1:38:00] in spirit he was God. but a man in
[1:38:04] flesh. Therefore, his body was a human
[1:38:06] being that was subject to temptations,
[1:38:09] subject to sickness, just the same as
[1:38:12] ours. As he had put on a man and human,
[1:38:15] and then he was God in spirit, and he
[1:38:17] said, "I and my father are one as the
[1:38:19] father dwelleth in me." And so, this is
[1:38:21] where we are. This is in my opinion,
[1:38:23] this is where we are in our transition
[1:38:25] in this period of time.
[1:38:28] When you can because another quote,
[1:38:30] we'll probably get to it.
[1:38:33] He says Pentecost came along those
[1:38:35] restoration of the gifts and all these
[1:38:36] other wonderful things. But he says when
[1:38:38] the bride begin to say I and my father
[1:38:40] are one
[1:38:42] he says then the truck separates.
[1:38:45] But do you understand what that what
[1:38:47] what that is implying?
[1:38:49] We have to allow the God that is in us
[1:38:52] to so possess us until it's no longer I
[1:38:54] who live but Christ living his life
[1:38:57] through me.
[1:38:57] Amen.
[1:38:58] He had in Jesus Christ he had the God in
[1:39:02] in Jesus Christ God had the total
[1:39:04] preeminence.
[1:39:05] Brother Brandham says now he wants that
[1:39:07] same preeminence in the bride.
[1:39:09] Amen.
[1:39:10] And then it talks about and it talks
[1:39:12] about what what's the manifestation of
[1:39:13] the sons of God. That's when what ours
[1:39:16] we what we ever say is the same as God
[1:39:19] himself speaking through us.
[1:39:20] Right?
[1:39:21] And we are in this transition right now.
[1:39:23] We we have that God sent the prophets to
[1:39:26] prepare a bride for a rapture. Amen.
[1:39:29] And so what God has spoken to us through
[1:39:31] him was to prepare us for the trans for
[1:39:34] the for for the the changing of our body
[1:39:36] to come to the realization of who we
[1:39:38] actually are.
[1:39:39] Redeeming means means to be restored
[1:39:42] back to your original.
[1:39:43] That's right.
[1:39:44] In the world because there were there
[1:39:46] serpent seed. There is no original to
[1:39:48] take them back to. But in if God is if
[1:39:52] God's seed is in you then you are being
[1:39:54] restored back to what you were in him
[1:39:57] before the fall.
[1:39:58] And if we go back to what we are before
[1:40:00] the fall you know the brother Brandham
[1:40:02] in other places he says you know we have
[1:40:03] to will to do the will of God.
[1:40:06] Amen.
[1:40:09] He says God has placed us now in the
[1:40:11] same in in in the same condition or
[1:40:13] relationship that Adam had in the
[1:40:15] beginning.
[1:40:16] And he says, he says, well, how's this?
[1:40:18] It all comes down to self-will.
[1:40:21] You have to will to do the will of God.
[1:40:24] And so, you have to submit your will to
[1:40:27] his will. Okay?
[1:40:37] Church in his condition, brother Brown
[1:40:39] makes a statement. And on the day when
[1:40:40] John baptized Jesus at the River Jordan,
[1:40:43] one of the greatest events that there
[1:40:44] ever had taken place, taken place right
[1:40:46] there, the dove and the lamb united
[1:40:48] together, that's when God and man became
[1:40:51] one. That's when heaven and earth
[1:40:53] embraced each other. That's when God
[1:40:55] came down from the spirit form and was
[1:40:57] made a man and dwelt among us. And I
[1:41:01] look at that and I figure, but you know,
[1:41:02] that relates to us. I was in the world.
[1:41:05] I was doing the things of the world, but
[1:41:06] all of a sudden there was something
[1:41:07] inside of me that was different. And
[1:41:10] there was this life of God in me that
[1:41:11] God was drawing unto himself. And
[1:41:13] through and through accepting Jesus
[1:41:15] Christ as my savior, I began a Christian
[1:41:17] walk. But then God came down and by his
[1:41:20] spirit, he began to indwell me. Same
[1:41:22] thing here. That's when God and man
[1:41:24] becomes one.
[1:41:26] That's when you and God unite and
[1:41:28] becomes one.
[1:41:30] Amen.
[1:41:33] What is that that's dwelling in you? the
[1:41:35] eternal, allsufficient, all powerful
[1:41:37] being.
[1:41:38] This is Elohim. This is God himself. You
[1:41:41] know, there there's no limitations.
[1:41:43] Amen.
[1:41:45] And all of the you have sockets around
[1:41:47] here and all of them like they're hooked
[1:41:49] up to a to a panel with fuses in it.
[1:41:53] Depending upon how much current the wire
[1:41:55] can carry, that's what they fuse it at.
[1:41:58] And normally they if normally they they
[1:42:00] make it the safety factor they put in.
[1:42:02] But here again, it's the fuse that
[1:42:04] limits the power.
[1:42:06] Okay. Um, so what limits us?
[1:42:11] It's our lack of faith.
[1:42:14] Our faith is the fuse box.
[1:42:18] The more that you understand about God,
[1:42:20] the more you begin to understand who you
[1:42:21] are. you the more that you begin to
[1:42:23] understand the power of God that is
[1:42:25] available to you. All of a sudden when
[1:42:27] you can open up and let the f let the
[1:42:29] spirit of God flow freely through you
[1:42:31] there's no fuse box.
[1:42:34] He can flow through you as much as you
[1:42:35] will let him.
[1:42:37] So I talked to some people. Yeah. They
[1:42:39] got their fuses at 5 amp 5 amp circuit.
[1:42:44] Some might get to 15. Wow. When we get
[1:42:46] to 20 hey you know now we can plug in
[1:42:48] some equipment. Huh. Yeah. But all of a
[1:42:51] sudden when you when you tap into the
[1:42:52] power lines of I don't know what the
[1:42:54] voltage is what 4,000 volts or whatever
[1:42:56] you tap into that sort. Hey man that's
[1:42:58] unlimited at this point.
[1:43:00] But see this is what God's trying to get
[1:43:02] us to understand. We have to I have to
[1:43:05] understand who God is so I can
[1:43:07] understand who I am.
[1:43:09] And and that I that that you know that
[1:43:11] that's a big statement. But the more I
[1:43:13] understand who he is and the more I
[1:43:15] understand I am a part of him. I'm
[1:43:17] beginning to understand who I am because
[1:43:18] I am a part of him. I am an expression
[1:43:20] of him. Him. He lives inside of me. And
[1:43:23] he lives inside of me for the expressed
[1:43:25] purpose of expressing himself, of
[1:43:26] manifesting himself through this flesh.
[1:43:31] So that's when the love and the dam that
[1:43:33] that's when God came down. That's when
[1:43:34] the dove and the lamb united together.
[1:43:42] It's interesting. And this is something
[1:43:44] I've been dwelling on for a while.
[1:43:46] Jesus Christ could be tempted.
[1:43:50] How could God be tempted?
[1:43:54] When we look at Jesus Christ, we begin
[1:43:56] to realize in flesh he was all man.
[1:44:01] It was the flesh that becomes the
[1:44:03] problem. It's this flesh that becomes
[1:44:07] the problem.
[1:44:09] He could be tempted. In in James, it
[1:44:11] says, "Let no man say when he is
[1:44:12] tempted, I am tempted of God. For God
[1:44:14] cannot be tempted. But every man is
[1:44:16] every man is tempted when he is drawn
[1:44:19] away from his own lust. Lust doesn't
[1:44:21] necessarily mean sexual. It's just
[1:44:23] strong desires to his own lust and is
[1:44:25] enticed. And when lust hath conceived,
[1:44:28] it bringeth forth sin. When sin
[1:44:29] finished, it bringeth forth death. So
[1:44:32] Jesus Christ could be tempted.
[1:44:37] Um
[1:44:39] when when we go and be and and let's
[1:44:41] pull this next one up. Remember Jesus uh
[1:44:46] as as he never used his power for
[1:44:49] himself. He used it for others.
[1:44:55] Okay.
[1:44:57] Why would a man that was that that was
[1:45:00] so full of power like him would ever be
[1:45:03] sick?
[1:45:04] Yes, sir. I I've read some books somehow
[1:45:06] and he talks about the prince of the
[1:45:08] house of David. He had that Jesus Christ
[1:45:10] had he sat on a rock and groan with a
[1:45:12] headache. See, he he he bore our
[1:45:14] infirmity. He had sickness. He had
[1:45:16] temptations. He had he had troubles. He
[1:45:18] had flusterations just as we have
[1:45:20] because he had to be the right kind of a
[1:45:23] mediator. But there's another place
[1:45:25] where what Jesus what what brother
[1:45:27] Brandham had. He says Jesus never knew
[1:45:29] what fear was
[1:45:31] because he always knew that the God that
[1:45:33] was in him was more than able to take
[1:45:35] care of anything he come he he that he
[1:45:38] he any of the problems that he
[1:45:39] approached. So Jesus, even he said, even
[1:45:42] if Jesus was surrounded by a a whole
[1:45:44] host of demons, he wasn't afraid of it.
[1:45:46] He was in the middle of a storm, he
[1:45:47] still didn't have any fear because he
[1:45:49] knew that God was in him was the God
[1:45:51] that was leading and guiding and
[1:45:52] directing him. And he had total faith in
[1:45:55] that God.
[1:45:56] Well, this is, like I say, this is where
[1:45:58] we need to come.
[1:46:01] And and so we understand that he could
[1:46:03] be tempted. We understand when he he
[1:46:06] fasted for 40 days. He went into the
[1:46:08] wilderness for 40 days. He didn't eat.
[1:46:10] And so Satan tempted him. If you are the
[1:46:13] son of God that you claim to be, you can
[1:46:16] take these stones, make them bread.
[1:46:18] Simple for you. Yeah. But Jesus says,
[1:46:21] you know, man doesn't live by bread
[1:46:23] alone. Another one, he he showed him he
[1:46:26] showed them all the kingdoms of the
[1:46:27] earth. You worship me, I will give you
[1:46:30] power. I will let you rule. Now you talk
[1:46:34] to a politician. boy, that wets their
[1:46:36] appetite
[1:46:38] cuz that's all they're wanting.
[1:46:40] They want power.
[1:46:43] And we have to be careful as ministers
[1:46:47] that we don't fall into that trap. I'm
[1:46:50] just expressing my opinion on that.
[1:46:52] Okay?
[1:46:54] Because when we all of a sudden we
[1:46:55] realize what God is, we realize what we
[1:46:59] are on, we are under the anointing, we
[1:47:02] begin to understand the power that is
[1:47:04] available to us because of the position
[1:47:06] that we hold. Elijah got mad one day,
[1:47:09] called out some bears and killed a bunch
[1:47:11] of kids. Moses got mad and rather than
[1:47:13] speak to the rock, he smoked the rock.
[1:47:15] Okay? Because of who he was, because of
[1:47:17] his office, God honored what he said,
[1:47:20] even though it wasn't God's will for
[1:47:21] that to happen. So here again like I
[1:47:23] said we have to be aware of the power
[1:47:25] that we possess by virtue of the of the
[1:47:27] position if you will that we hold.
[1:47:31] But Jesus Christ here again when we
[1:47:33] begin to understand yeah he had
[1:47:35] temptations but he had to overcome his
[1:47:37] temptations. And how did he overcome
[1:47:39] them? He told when when when when Satan
[1:47:41] had tempted him he said oh yeah take
[1:47:43] these stones turn them into bread. So
[1:47:46] Jesus went back went back and he quoted
[1:47:47] the scriptures. Thou shalt not live by
[1:47:49] bread alone, but but by every word of
[1:47:51] God.
[1:47:52] H okay. Fall down and worship me. I'll
[1:47:55] give you the I'll give you all the
[1:47:56] power. He he he says you we are to
[1:47:59] worship God and him alone.
[1:48:01] Okay. I mean so here again we feed these
[1:48:03] and and and and then another place he he
[1:48:06] took him up to the pinnacle of temple.
[1:48:07] Cast yourself down. You got all these
[1:48:09] people down there. Glorify yourself in
[1:48:10] the eyes of the people. when you jump
[1:48:13] off here, the angels have to come and
[1:48:14] bear you up and let you and all these
[1:48:16] host of angels would come and man look
[1:48:18] at the people. They will look at you and
[1:48:20] all they will fall down and worship you.
[1:48:22] And Jesus says, you don't tempt God. You
[1:48:25] do what God directs you to do.
[1:48:28] But he always went back to the word.
[1:48:32] What do we go back to?
[1:48:34] We have to rely upon the word. Okay.
[1:48:38] When I when I did
[1:48:42] this is this is from a commentary that I
[1:48:44] that I I was reading. Let this mind be
[1:48:47] in you which was also in Christ Jesus.
[1:48:49] Let this thinking that this way of
[1:48:51] thinking must be adopted to you which
[1:48:54] was also the way of the thinking adopted
[1:48:56] by Jesus Christ.
[1:48:58] Precisely because he was in the form of
[1:49:00] God. He did not consider being equal
[1:49:03] with God grounds for grasping. He did
[1:49:05] not think because he was God he could
[1:49:07] just go out and do whatever he wanted to
[1:49:08] do because he had all the power.
[1:49:12] Okay? And this was speaking and from
[1:49:14] what the commentary said this was
[1:49:16] speaking of Christ before he was
[1:49:17] incarnate before he became in flesh. But
[1:49:20] it goes on in verse 7 and he says but he
[1:49:22] made himself of no reputation took upon
[1:49:24] him the form of his servant was made in
[1:49:26] the likeness of man. So it says on the
[1:49:28] contrary he rather poured himself out by
[1:49:31] taking the form of a slave and being in
[1:49:33] the form of the likeness of human being.
[1:49:35] He was re he became recognized as a man.
[1:49:39] He did not come to earth to all of a
[1:49:41] sudden to become different than what we
[1:49:43] are.
[1:49:44] He be he had the mentality of a slave.
[1:49:47] He he had the mentality he came to serve
[1:49:49] others.
[1:49:50] He came with a mentality God he God has
[1:49:53] sent me here in order that I can
[1:49:55] manifest him. And it it's God's desire
[1:49:57] to give. For God so loved the world, he
[1:50:00] gave. For God so loved the world, he
[1:50:01] gave. You get sick, what does he do? For
[1:50:03] God so loves you that he heals you. You
[1:50:05] need a job. For God so loves you, he
[1:50:07] gives you a job. For God so loves you,
[1:50:09] he provides what you have needed. For
[1:50:10] God so love and it's not because you
[1:50:12] earn it.
[1:50:15] There's no earning with God.
[1:50:18] There there's another thing that came
[1:50:20] comes to mind. I'll go ahead. when we
[1:50:23] were at youth camp uh a few years back
[1:50:26] um the minister would get up he would
[1:50:29] preach there would be an altar call and
[1:50:32] half or twothirds of the congregation
[1:50:34] the young you know they all go to the
[1:50:36] altar and we as ministers we'd go lay
[1:50:38] hands and pray and pray and stuff
[1:50:40] next night another minister gets up and
[1:50:44] the same group of kids came forward
[1:50:48] okay so we prayed for them and third
[1:50:50] night it was the
[1:50:53] And I began to ask God, I says, "What's
[1:50:56] wrong here?"
[1:50:57] Because obviously they are not being
[1:50:59] able to accept what you are trying to
[1:51:02] give to them.
[1:51:04] And so the thoughts came to my mind, he
[1:51:06] says, "Of of a woman in filth, her hair
[1:51:10] all messed up, clothes that she had on
[1:51:12] were torn and ragged and filthy. And she
[1:51:15] was begging. She was going from one
[1:51:16] person to another. I'm so hungry. I'm so
[1:51:19] Can you just give me just a moral of
[1:51:20] bread? I'm I'm starving to death. I just
[1:51:22] I just want a little morsel. Can you
[1:51:24] just supply me with some little this and
[1:51:25] some and she's constantly begging and
[1:51:27] begging and begging. And then she says,
[1:51:29] "You know, there's a there's a kind man
[1:51:31] on the on the on the hillside, the
[1:51:33] hilltop. I'll go to him and see if maybe
[1:51:35] he'll he'll give me this little bit
[1:51:37] something so I can just just just have
[1:51:39] something to eat." So she knocks on the
[1:51:42] door and all of a sudden the master of
[1:51:43] the house opens the door and he looks
[1:51:45] down at this woman, hair all messed up,
[1:51:48] clothes filthy and rags and stuff.
[1:51:50] And he looks at this woman and says,
[1:51:52] "Sweetheart,
[1:51:55] we were waiting for you to come home.
[1:51:58] We're wondering where you were at. We're
[1:52:00] wondering what you know what's what
[1:52:01] happened to you. Why are you out there
[1:52:03] in the world? Why are you doing all
[1:52:04] these things?" "Oh, look at you." He
[1:52:06] says, "Your hair is such a mess." And
[1:52:08] and and your the dress you have on is so
[1:52:11] filthy. You you got a wardrobe with all
[1:52:14] nice, beautiful white dresses, clothing
[1:52:16] his righteousness. You go in there and
[1:52:18] take a bath or a shower. I guess a bath
[1:52:20] at that point and just get washing by
[1:52:23] the water of the word and oh and
[1:52:25] sweetheart all the things that you want
[1:52:27] to eat is all that's been sitting there
[1:52:28] on the table just waiting for you to
[1:52:31] come home.
[1:52:34] We don't have to beg.
[1:52:38] We are his wife.
[1:52:41] We are his son or daughter.
[1:52:44] We we were his children.
[1:52:48] When my kids come to my house, they
[1:52:49] don't have to beg to get something to
[1:52:51] eat. They know where the fridge is.
[1:52:54] Why do we have the same mentality when
[1:52:56] we go to God?
[1:52:59] Why do you think you have to beg and to
[1:53:01] plead with to get what the necessities
[1:53:03] that you have for life when he is more
[1:53:06] than willing to give it to you? All you
[1:53:08] have to do is ask.
[1:53:10] Amen.
[1:53:11] But then you have to have the faith to
[1:53:13] believe. I mean this also but when you
[1:53:14] begin to understand your position when
[1:53:16] you begin to understand you are you are
[1:53:19] his child when you begin to understand
[1:53:20] you and the relationship you are his
[1:53:23] wife
[1:53:25] it's open to you
[1:53:27] my wife and I have the same credit cards
[1:53:29] my wife and I we have one car but she
[1:53:31] has keys to it also she doesn't have to
[1:53:33] beg to to go someplace she doesn't if
[1:53:35] she wants to buy something yeah go ahead
[1:53:36] and use it I don't like to charge things
[1:53:38] well okay well that's good but but but
[1:53:41] but here again there's There's no
[1:53:43] limitations here.
[1:53:45] Yeah. Right.
[1:53:46] I mean, it's like
[1:53:48] we were going out and she were taking
[1:53:50] she wanted to get a new dress and that
[1:53:52] was good. I I like her to have nice
[1:53:55] dresses. That's my preference. So, she
[1:53:58] was looking in the rack of sale items.
[1:54:02] Okay, that's fine. She tried this and
[1:54:04] that's all right. Yeah, it'll do. You
[1:54:06] know this. Then I found what she's
[1:54:08] wearing. I says, "Honey, try this one
[1:54:11] on.
[1:54:13] Oh, she says, 'Now this is, you know,
[1:54:15] this is a little more expensive. I says,
[1:54:17] I don't care.
[1:54:19] I think you would look nice in this.
[1:54:23] Okay, that was my preference. Okay,
[1:54:26] that's my preference, but she looks
[1:54:29] beautiful in it.
[1:54:31] You may not think so, but I do. Okay, so
[1:54:33] that's but but see here again, it's it's
[1:54:36] this is my desire for I want her to look
[1:54:38] pretty. I want her to I want her to be
[1:54:40] healthy. I I want her to be able to
[1:54:42] enjoy the life that we live together.
[1:54:44] In fact, marriage, the whole purpose of
[1:54:46] marriage in my opinion is two people
[1:54:48] living, two people sharing a life
[1:54:50] together.
[1:54:52] Yes, sir.
[1:54:53] Anyway,
[1:54:57] so here again, it says on the contrary,
[1:54:59] see verse eight, and he being found in
[1:55:02] fashion of man, he humbled himself and
[1:55:03] became obedient unto death, even the
[1:55:05] death of a cross. He became obedient to
[1:55:08] obey what God had instructed him to do.
[1:55:10] And Jesus Christ cried, if there's any
[1:55:12] other way to than the cross, Lord, can
[1:55:14] is can we take that? But he was willing
[1:55:17] to submit to Calvary
[1:55:19] for us.
[1:55:21] He was willing to go through and submit.
[1:55:23] He was willing to take the cross to save
[1:55:26] us.
[1:55:37] And then in the beginning was the word.
[1:55:38] The word was with God and the word was
[1:55:40] and the word was hewed out and reflected
[1:55:42] that the word was in the beginning him.
[1:55:45] The word reflected the masterpiece in
[1:55:47] his own likeness. God back again in his
[1:55:50] own likeness. The word form being
[1:55:52] reflected in the image of the man. The
[1:55:54] masterpiece. All the prophets had flaws
[1:55:57] and the and and all the ones had
[1:55:59] different portions. But see, God and
[1:56:01] Christ were one in so much until he
[1:56:04] until he put his own spirit into him.
[1:56:06] And then even the image of the of the
[1:56:08] builder became one. God and his
[1:56:10] scriptures work his masterpiece. And
[1:56:13] when I when I was reading that and I
[1:56:14] began to look at that, you know, that
[1:56:16] reflects us because
[1:56:20] within Adam and within Christ, the
[1:56:23] genetics was only God.
[1:56:26] So they can only manifest the genetics
[1:56:28] to a large extent affects your attitude,
[1:56:31] affects the way you live, the way that
[1:56:32] you think and all these other wonderful
[1:56:34] things. But see just having the gen
[1:56:36] genetics was not enough.
[1:56:39] Adam had the genetics. He failed. When
[1:56:42] Christ came forth, he had all the
[1:56:44] genetics. But then what happened on the
[1:56:45] river Jordan? God all of a sudden came
[1:56:47] and so indwelt him so that that God
[1:56:49] could now have the have a stronger
[1:56:52] influence for lack of a better word over
[1:56:54] the body in which he was now living in.
[1:56:56] And it's because the God that was in him
[1:56:59] and he relied upon that God that's why
[1:57:01] he was able to overcome all of the
[1:57:02] things that Satan would throw against
[1:57:04] him. And it's now it's the same with us.
[1:57:06] It's because of the God that dwells in
[1:57:08] us we can overcome. It's because of the
[1:57:10] God that dwells in us we have the power.
[1:57:12] Because of the God that dwells in us now
[1:57:13] we have access to everything God is.
[1:57:16] Brother Man I think in one place says
[1:57:18] God will bankrupt heaven for one of his
[1:57:20] kids.
[1:57:22] This is what we have access to.
[1:57:26] You don't have to beg.
[1:57:29] He wants to give it to you.
[1:57:31] He wants to provide. He wants to take
[1:57:34] care of you.
[1:57:46] When God looked down, it's he was so
[1:57:48] inspired that he would that that it
[1:57:50] would be the perfect masterpiece of a
[1:57:52] redeemer. Jesus the redeemer. So God in
[1:57:55] order to be this mitten himself be
[1:57:58] because to pay his own penalty, God and
[1:58:00] Christ became one. So God could smite
[1:58:03] him in the in the image. The perfect
[1:58:05] image, the God man, God immorphic had
[1:58:08] changed from dis the supernatural to the
[1:58:10] vision. From vision was projected to the
[1:58:12] image and the image was smitten that the
[1:58:13] supernatural could taste the feeling of
[1:58:15] death. God's perfect masterpiece. So it
[1:58:18] was the God man. God came in Jesus
[1:58:20] Christ for this sole purpose of
[1:58:21] redeeming us. God came in Jesus Christ
[1:58:23] to become our kinsman redeemer. And this
[1:58:25] is this is the whole plan of God. The
[1:58:27] whole plan of God is to take and make
[1:58:29] and and God wanted man after his own
[1:58:31] image. He did that in Adam. Adam fell.
[1:58:34] He made the masterpiece. Now it was
[1:58:36] Jesus Christ. Now he could now Jesus
[1:58:39] Christ was man in
[1:58:41] Jesus Christ was was the man after God's
[1:58:44] own image that God had created. But see
[1:58:47] now it has to come down to where we are.
[1:58:49] Now it has to come down to the place
[1:58:50] where we begin to understand who we are.
[1:58:53] See he could not do it in Moses. He
[1:58:55] could not do it in the prophets. Isaiah
[1:58:56] who was saw and saw until he was saw
[1:58:58] into pieces. But in this perfect
[1:59:00] masterpiece, he was the fullness of the
[1:59:02] Godhead bodily. He could not only
[1:59:04] project Moses, he could project his
[1:59:06] entire being into this person and taste
[1:59:08] death for the whole human race. God's
[1:59:10] perfect masterpiece. All other types
[1:59:13] were fulfilled in him. Our kinsman
[1:59:14] redeemer and Ruth and Boaz out to the
[1:59:16] lawgiver from Mount Si.
[1:59:19] He was a perfect masterpiece because he
[1:59:21] was God. He was the God man. And when
[1:59:24] did he become the God man of the river
[1:59:26] Jordan? When all of a sudden God and man
[1:59:28] united together and God and man became
[1:59:31] one?
[1:59:32] You you were born in sin. You were
[1:59:34] shaped in iniquity. You you have a
[1:59:35] hybrid nature. Okay. You accepted Jesus
[1:59:38] Christ as your savior. For what purpose?
[1:59:40] Because there was something inside you.
[1:59:41] There was a seed that was in you that
[1:59:43] God quickened to life. And that
[1:59:45] quickening that he that what the life
[1:59:47] that was in you that he quickened to
[1:59:48] life. Now he's wanting that life to come
[1:59:50] into full manifestation and full
[1:59:52] expression. You cannot do it with just
[1:59:54] with just the genetics. You cannot do it
[1:59:56] with simply having the seed. No. Now God
[1:59:58] and man has to unite together in you.
[2:00:02] And we and now we are to be the final
[2:00:04] masterpiece.
[2:00:07] Yes sir.
[2:00:07] What God was what God expressed in Jesus
[2:00:10] Christ. Now he wants to express in us.
[2:00:12] That's right.
[2:00:20] Brother Bradom goes on and in
[2:00:21] masterpiece he goes on he begins to say
[2:00:23] see God came in Jesus Christ and Jesus
[2:00:25] Christ was the perfect masterpiece.
[2:00:27] Jesus Christ was was the masterpiece and
[2:00:29] God came and formed himself in him so
[2:00:31] that he so that perfect masterpiece
[2:00:34] could be smitten but he had to be
[2:00:36] smitten just like God had to reach into
[2:00:38] Adam and draw out of Adam a part of Adam
[2:00:40] in order to create Eve. Now he had
[2:00:42] Christ had to be smitten so that the
[2:00:44] bride that dwelt within that body we
[2:00:46] call Jesus Christ. Now that now the now
[2:00:49] that which was the feminine part of
[2:00:51] Jesus Christ could now come into
[2:00:52] manifestation.
[2:00:54] And so what did he do on on the day of
[2:00:56] Pentecost? He we find that God came down
[2:00:58] and and God placed his seed in the
[2:01:01] church.
[2:01:04] And so that's that seed was planted on
[2:01:06] the day of Pentecost. But see Satan also
[2:01:09] planted his seed. And what was that
[2:01:12] seed? Nicladism.
[2:01:15] Satan always worked through men. Satan
[2:01:18] always works through organizations.
[2:01:20] Satan always works with other people
[2:01:21] getting private revelations. Okay? So
[2:01:25] you have now and you go through the
[2:01:27] church ages, what do you see? You see
[2:01:29] there in in the church ages, it's God is
[2:01:32] talking to two different groups. He's
[2:01:34] talking to the bride and he's also
[2:01:35] talking to the serpent seed
[2:01:38] because God was dealing. God was trying
[2:01:40] to tell him. God was trying to instruct
[2:01:41] them.
[2:01:45] But then when we begin to go on here in
[2:01:48] uh
[2:01:50] legacy and church age, he says a
[2:01:52] momentary consideration of church
[2:01:53] history will prove how accurate this is.
[2:01:55] Dark ages the word was almost lost to
[2:01:57] the people. God but God sent Luther with
[2:02:00] the word and the Lutheran spoke for God
[2:02:02] at that time. When we begin to look at
[2:02:04] the when we begin to look at the church
[2:02:06] as a plant, the plant which was the
[2:02:08] church is the avenue or the the vehicle
[2:02:11] that God was using to to produce the
[2:02:13] seed. You take you take a piece take
[2:02:16] corn, stick it in the ground. The corn
[2:02:17] is sitting there. The life is in that
[2:02:19] corn. But the corn has to the shell has
[2:02:21] to die and then and then the life within
[2:02:23] that corn has to begin to sprout. So you
[2:02:25] come up with leaves that doesn't look
[2:02:27] like the seed. Then it goes up to the
[2:02:29] tassel that looks does doesn't look as
[2:02:31] closer to it. and he gets to the shock
[2:02:33] and I mean this is what brother Brandham
[2:02:35] describes. This is how this is how how
[2:02:36] he begins to bring it and we begin to
[2:02:38] understand this is what we're reading
[2:02:40] about here in in the church Asia. He
[2:02:42] says when the Methodists failed God
[2:02:43] raised up others and so it's gone on
[2:02:45] through the years until in this last day
[2:02:47] there is another people in the land who
[2:02:49] under their messenger will become the
[2:02:51] final voice to the final age.
[2:02:54] Not the prophet
[2:02:57] the bride. Amen.
[2:02:59] We are to be the final voice
[2:03:02] to the final age.
[2:03:04] But we as the bride, if we are the
[2:03:07] bride, that means we are a manifestation
[2:03:08] of Jesus Christ. What is Jesus Christ?
[2:03:11] He is the word. So that means we become
[2:03:13] the manifestation of the word. And the
[2:03:15] word cannot contradict the word. The
[2:03:17] word will only say what the word has
[2:03:18] said.
[2:03:19] So we should be only saying what the
[2:03:20] what God has spoken to us through the
[2:03:22] prophet. That's I mean and and this
[2:03:24] shouldn't be a hindrance. This shouldn't
[2:03:26] be something far out that we we have
[2:03:28] trouble to understand. But here again,
[2:03:31] if we come down to the place we have to
[2:03:32] realize God sent a prophet and that
[2:03:35] prophet God sent that prophet in order
[2:03:37] to tell us who we are.
[2:03:40] When I was in it was I was I was raised
[2:03:42] in the Baptist church went from that to
[2:03:44] Assemblies of God.
[2:03:46] I was always a sinner. Emphasis saved by
[2:03:51] grace.
[2:03:53] And as I listen to some other
[2:03:56] ministers, if you will,
[2:03:59] they are still saying, "You're a sinner.
[2:04:01] You have to overcome your flesh. You
[2:04:03] have to do better than this. You have to
[2:04:05] do this. You have to get in your Bible.
[2:04:06] You have to read the message. You have
[2:04:08] to do this. And you're you're a sinner.
[2:04:09] You have to overcome your flesh. You're
[2:04:11] a sinner. You have to overcome they're
[2:04:12] s." And so you're always you're always
[2:04:14] in the negative. We always realize,
[2:04:16] yeah, I'm a poor, rich, and miserable
[2:04:17] person. I'm a sinner. I I have, you
[2:04:19] know, and and and God in grace and mercy
[2:04:22] and love, he bestowed that grace upon us
[2:04:24] so that I could even have salvation.
[2:04:26] Well, that's all true.
[2:04:29] But when I came to this message, it
[2:04:30] said, I'm not just a sinner saved by
[2:04:32] grace. I am a child of God that has been
[2:04:34] fully restored to my rightful position
[2:04:36] with my father.
[2:04:39] And that God so lives inside of me until
[2:04:41] he is trying to express his life through
[2:04:43] me. But I have to let him. This is the
[2:04:46] pro. This is the battle. The battle's
[2:04:48] not only in Well, the battle's in your
[2:04:50] in our heads. Yeah. Because Satan,
[2:04:51] that's where that's where he works. But
[2:04:53] we have to begin to understand God sent
[2:04:55] the prophet to tell the bride, "This is
[2:04:56] who you are.
[2:04:58] You're him.
[2:05:01] In all that that implies,
[2:05:04] you're him."
[2:05:06] Yes, sir.
[2:05:07] We have to think not of ourselves as
[2:05:09] sinners saved by grace. I mean, that's
[2:05:10] always that we you get up in the
[2:05:12] morning, you realize that. Okay, that's
[2:05:14] not a hard thing to comprehend.
[2:05:16] But when you begin to transition your
[2:05:18] thinking into no, I am a child of God.
[2:05:23] I was a part of God from the beginning.
[2:05:26] Now that God that lives in me is wanting
[2:05:29] to express himself through me.
[2:05:32] Yes, sir.
[2:05:34] He says, "Yes, the church is no longer.
[2:05:37] So, the church is no longer the
[2:05:38] mouthpiece of God. It's his own
[2:05:40] masterpiece. So, so God is turning on
[2:05:42] her. He will confound her through the
[2:05:44] prophet and the bride. For the voice of
[2:05:46] God will be in her.
[2:05:49] It didn't say the and the voice and the
[2:05:51] prophet and and the voice of God will be
[2:05:53] in the prophet.
[2:05:54] No. The voice of God will be in her.
[2:05:58] When the bride begins to say I and my
[2:06:00] father are one.
[2:06:02] When we begin to realize that God is God
[2:06:05] dwelling inside of me and the more I can
[2:06:07] yield to him and all of a sudden I can
[2:06:09] give him the preeminence then it's no
[2:06:11] longer me. Now it's him. And if the more
[2:06:14] of the more of my life I can give him,
[2:06:16] the more of the the more control he has
[2:06:18] of me, the more of himself he can
[2:06:20] express through me.
[2:06:25] Satan knows that if the people can get a
[2:06:27] true revelation of the true church and
[2:06:29] what she is and what she stands for, she
[2:06:32] can do the greater works. She will be an
[2:06:35] invincible army. And if you can get a
[2:06:37] true revelation of the two spirits
[2:06:39] within the framework of the Christian
[2:06:40] church and by God's spirit is earned to
[2:06:42] withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan
[2:06:44] will be powerless before her. So we have
[2:06:46] to understand how does Satan operate?
[2:06:50] He gets his doubts.
[2:06:52] He gets he gets other ministers with
[2:06:54] their own private revelations.
[2:06:56] Okay. Um I'm not interested in their
[2:06:59] private revelation. You you got a
[2:07:01] revelation. Fine. Show me where brother
[2:07:03] Brown said it.
[2:07:04] And not only that, show me in the
[2:07:06] scriptures. I want both of them
[2:07:07] together.
[2:07:08] I want both of them together. I mean,
[2:07:11] there are things that we discussed the
[2:07:13] last couple of days and we have our
[2:07:16] thoughts,
[2:07:18] but until I can take the word and I can
[2:07:20] take the prophet
[2:07:22] and I can bring the two together into a
[2:07:24] revelation and I can substantiate it by
[2:07:26] the word and the prophet and I can bring
[2:07:29] them together, I don't preach it.
[2:07:32] I'm not going to preach a bunch of my
[2:07:33] ideas because I don't know if they're
[2:07:34] going to be right.
[2:07:36] But when I can take the prophet and the
[2:07:37] word and put them together
[2:07:39] now, I have an understanding and on that
[2:07:42] understanding I can rest.
[2:07:44] And like I say, I have a lot of my own
[2:07:45] ideas, but that doesn't mean any of them
[2:07:47] are right.
[2:07:48] But if I can come here and I can begin
[2:07:50] to if the people get a true revelation
[2:07:52] of the true church, that means that she
[2:07:55] gets a revelation that she's Jesus
[2:07:56] Christ because that's what the true
[2:07:58] church is. and that she can and and and
[2:08:02] what she stands for which means she has
[2:08:03] to stand for the word
[2:08:06] and that she can do the greater works.
[2:08:08] Okay. Now there's a transition in
[2:08:10] thinking. Not only do you know who you
[2:08:12] are, not only do you stand for the word,
[2:08:14] you have to have the faith to believe
[2:08:17] that you can do the greater works.
[2:08:21] Only then will you become an invincible
[2:08:24] army.
[2:08:26] So do you believe you can do the greater
[2:08:27] works?
[2:08:31] Do you have the revelation of who you
[2:08:32] are? Do you have a revelation you're
[2:08:35] him? Do you have a revelation of the
[2:08:38] eternal, allsufficient, all powerful,
[2:08:40] self-existing one dwells in you?
[2:08:43] Brother Brham said, "I don't do any of
[2:08:45] these things. I'm just standing there
[2:08:47] while he does them."
[2:08:49] Jesus himself says, "I don't perform any
[2:08:51] miracles. It's the God in me." Look, the
[2:08:54] God in me.
[2:08:55] Amen.
[2:08:56] Performing that.
[2:08:57] Amen.
[2:08:58] Okay, same thing. I can't do it, but he
[2:09:01] can.
[2:09:03] I have to allow him to do it.
[2:09:07] Brother Brandham said the gift he had
[2:09:08] was learning to get himself out of the
[2:09:10] way so that the God that was in him
[2:09:12] could express himself through him.
[2:09:16] This is where we have to come in my
[2:09:18] opinion. Okay,
[2:09:20] you don't like it, you can throw it
[2:09:21] away, but that that's my opinion.
[2:09:24] He goes in the in the rising of the sun.
[2:09:26] He said in the bride coming of Christ.
[2:09:28] What's this bride coming of Christ?
[2:09:30] Christ coming in bride form
[2:09:34] amorphing changing his dwelling place.
[2:09:37] Amorphy manifesting himself different
[2:09:39] forms. He's manifest
[2:09:42] himself in us.
[2:09:45] Okay.
[2:09:46] Um in in the bride coming of Christ
[2:09:48] coming out of the church there'll have
[2:09:50] to be a sheath waved in again in the
[2:09:51] last days. What was the sheath? the
[2:09:53] first one that came to maturity um for
[2:09:55] the bride age for a resurrection out of
[2:09:57] dark denominationalism will be a message
[2:09:59] that the full the full maturity of the
[2:10:02] word which is Christ okay has returned
[2:10:06] back again in its full power and it's
[2:10:08] being waved over the people and goes on
[2:10:10] because I live ye shall live also
[2:10:12] speaking to it speaking to his wife
[2:10:15] because I live you live also what what a
[2:10:17] resurrection that what what a
[2:10:19] resurrection this is to be quickened
[2:10:21] from the dead to be made alive in Jesus
[2:10:23] Christ. It's by God's quickening power.
[2:10:26] We have what was waved in brother
[2:10:28] Bradam's ministry. What was waved over
[2:10:30] the people? The word I mean Jesus
[2:10:33] Christ. Okay. The eternal allsufficient
[2:10:35] all powerful self-existing one. Okay.
[2:10:37] That was God took and that God expressed
[2:10:40] himself and God moved over and God
[2:10:43] manifested himself to the bride.
[2:10:46] Why all the miracles to brother
[2:10:48] Brandham's ministry?
[2:10:50] So we'd have confidence in God.
[2:10:53] Why all the healings? So we could know
[2:10:56] God could heal.
[2:10:57] Why all the, you know, why why do the
[2:10:59] manifestations of God? So we know that
[2:11:01] God himself is real.
[2:11:03] It's not a figment of our imagination,
[2:11:05] not just something we read in a book.
[2:11:07] No, God has to become a reality to us.
[2:11:10] We have to realize where is God? Where
[2:11:12] does he live? Where does he dwell? Right
[2:11:14] here.
[2:11:15] If you put him out there, that's that's
[2:11:17] fine. out there, he's not going to help
[2:11:20] you. Well, I mean, he will. I take that
[2:11:22] back. But when you come to the
[2:11:24] realization, no, he's here.
[2:11:27] And all I have to do is allow him to
[2:11:30] express himself through me.
[2:11:33] I don't have to perform miracles. I just
[2:11:36] have to let him do it.
[2:11:37] Amen.
[2:11:38] When I went to see their brother with
[2:11:40] because of of his infection in his
[2:11:42] elbow, I didn't perform any miracle.
[2:11:45] I went there as as as as as as a
[2:11:48] minister of the gospel because I felt
[2:11:51] led to go and to minister to him. And I
[2:11:54] realized that when I was there and I was
[2:11:55] ministering, I realized God sent me
[2:11:57] there for a purpose. And I didn't heal
[2:12:00] him. I re I under the inspiration of
[2:12:04] God, I rebuked that spirit and then the
[2:12:06] healing began.
[2:12:08] It wasn't anything about me.
[2:12:11] I allow God to use me. Okay.
[2:12:31] I don't
[2:12:38] Yeah. What is this next one?
[2:12:44] Well, okay, brother Brown, when when
[2:12:46] he's talking about how when when
[2:12:49] he was relating what happened when a
[2:12:51] when when God appeared to Abraham and
[2:12:53] and and began to speak to Abra, he be he
[2:12:55] here he relates the fact that that that
[2:12:58] okay, he says, "So will it be at the
[2:13:00] coming of the son of man when the son of
[2:13:02] man is being revealed?" No, not no more
[2:13:04] as a church. See, not no more. Not not
[2:13:07] no more. He sees the bride is called
[2:13:08] out. See, in the day of the son of man,
[2:13:11] in the day the son of man will be
[2:13:12] revealed, what? To join the church and
[2:13:14] to the head to unite the marriage of the
[2:13:16] bride. The bridegroom come will come
[2:13:18] right through this when the son of man
[2:13:20] will come down and come in human flesh
[2:13:22] to unite the two together. The church
[2:13:25] has to be the word. He is the word. And
[2:13:28] the two unites together. And to do that,
[2:13:30] it'll take the manifestation of the
[2:13:31] revealing of the son of man. See, it's
[2:13:33] the son of man. Jesus Christ will come
[2:13:35] down in human flesh among us. And he
[2:13:37] will make his word so real that it'll
[2:13:39] unite. It'll unite the church and him as
[2:13:41] one. The bride and then shall go home to
[2:13:43] the wedding supper. When the word here
[2:13:45] unites with the person and they too
[2:13:48] become one and then what does it do? It
[2:13:51] magnifies. It manifests the son of man
[2:13:53] again. The word and the church becomes
[2:13:56] one. Whenever the son of man's done the
[2:13:59] word and the church does the same thing.
[2:14:03] He goes on here in in in the sea is not
[2:14:05] air with the sh. begins to talk about
[2:14:07] Pentecost. And I'm nothing against
[2:14:09] Pentecost, so don't throw stones yet. He
[2:14:12] says, but he says, "Along came
[2:14:13] sanctification." How many believes in
[2:14:15] sanctification? You believe the Bible.
[2:14:17] You have to share. So that's what it is.
[2:14:19] He says, he says, "But when the pent,
[2:14:21] but when but then come the Pentecost,
[2:14:24] the restoration of the gift, speaking in
[2:14:26] tongues." Why? Why they call it the
[2:14:27] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:29] speaking in tongues? There they call it
[2:14:31] the initial evidence which which brought
[2:14:33] forth what? It brought forth the shock.
[2:14:35] But they denominate. But when you come
[2:14:37] to say I and my father are one and these
[2:14:40] other things then the shuck pulls away.
[2:14:44] The plant is growing. The plant is
[2:14:47] growing. What was the last age? What was
[2:14:50] Lady Oia? It was the shuck.
[2:14:53] But it had but but this it had to it had
[2:14:56] to protect the wheat. It had to protect
[2:14:59] the seed until the seed could come to
[2:15:01] maturity. That's right.
[2:15:04] But we should be coming to maturity.
[2:15:06] Yes, sir.
[2:15:09] Brother Brandham says that the church
[2:15:12] that that laid it
[2:15:14] the seals could not be open until the
[2:15:17] all until the church was dead. That's
[2:15:18] right.
[2:15:20] Um stick my neck out. That means that
[2:15:22] means the late church age ended in 63.
[2:15:25] Amen.
[2:15:26] Because it died.
[2:15:28] Okay. Um,
[2:15:31] so what so where is the life now?
[2:15:34] If all of the life in the plant has
[2:15:36] died,
[2:15:38] where is the life now?
[2:15:39] Amen.
[2:15:40] It's in us, which is the seed.
[2:15:43] And what is that seed? It's a full
[2:15:45] reproduction of the seed that was
[2:15:46] planted at Pentecost.
[2:15:48] It's God coming in human flesh. It's God
[2:15:51] coming in us.
[2:15:52] It's God so coming in us until it's no
[2:15:55] longer us, but now it's him. And this is
[2:15:57] the transitions we have to make in our
[2:15:59] thinking. We have to think beyond
[2:16:02] Pentecost. And nothing wrong with
[2:16:03] Pentecost. Okay. The problem I found
[2:16:06] with Pentecost, Pentecost tend to rely
[2:16:07] an awful lot of on emotions.
[2:16:10] My opinion, emotions don't save you.
[2:16:13] Emotions don't heal you. Emotions don't
[2:16:14] do anything but have you get you a nice
[2:16:16] excited time.
[2:16:18] Okay? And that's fine. But we have to
[2:16:20] get beyond emotions. We have to I don't
[2:16:23] rely upon emotions to know who I am. If
[2:16:26] I relied upon emotions, I would give up
[2:16:27] and just go away. Okay?
[2:16:30] But be I go back to the word. The word
[2:16:34] tells me this is what I am. The word
[2:16:36] tells me I am a son of God. The word
[2:16:39] tells me Jesus Christ died on the cross
[2:16:41] for my sin. I am the very righteousness
[2:16:43] of God himself because I am in him. I
[2:16:45] have accepted Jesus Christ as my savior.
[2:16:48] That God lives inside of me. That's what
[2:16:50] the word says. Amen.
[2:16:53] I will accept it because the word says,
[2:16:55] not because I feel it.
[2:16:58] But because that's what it he's he's
[2:17:00] telling me who I am.
[2:17:02] And the more I can begin to accept who I
[2:17:04] am, the more of the God that is in me
[2:17:07] can begin to live and express himself
[2:17:09] through me.
[2:17:10] And I I keep I'm coming to the real it
[2:17:13] has nothing to do with me.
[2:17:15] I cannot produce miracles. I cannot save
[2:17:17] anybody. I cannot do this that or the
[2:17:20] other. But the God in me can. But I have
[2:17:22] to yield to him.
[2:17:25] He needs a vessel to which he can flow.
[2:17:28] Spirits are powerless until they have a
[2:17:30] vessel in which they can live
[2:17:32] and express themselves.
[2:17:34] I mean, that's what diseases are.
[2:17:36] They're spirits
[2:17:38] and they live in they live in that body
[2:17:39] and they do what they do. Okay? Some
[2:17:42] epilepsy and you got all the cancers and
[2:17:44] whatever else you have. Okay? So, a
[2:17:46] spirit has to be able to abide within a
[2:17:49] vessel in order for it to express
[2:17:50] itself.
[2:17:51] God is a spirit.
[2:17:54] He has to have vessels that he can live
[2:17:56] in so he can express himself.
[2:18:00] Satan is not a gentleman.
[2:18:04] Satan will take possession of you
[2:18:05] whether you want it or not. And Satan
[2:18:07] will cause you to do things you don't
[2:18:08] want to do.
[2:18:10] Look at the people that do drugs.
[2:18:12] What do they do? They've all of a sudden
[2:18:13] they ingested a spirit. And that spirit
[2:18:15] I mean and and they become so bound to
[2:18:17] that spirit it kills them.
[2:18:20] Okay. But God is a gentleman.
[2:18:23] He will not override our self will.
[2:18:28] You have to will to do the will of God.
[2:18:30] Brother Brham had to brother Brandham
[2:18:33] had to will to take his self and and and
[2:18:36] will him.
[2:18:38] Brother Brandham had the will to allow
[2:18:40] God to come and take possession of his
[2:18:42] vessel so that the God that was in him
[2:18:45] could express himself through him.
[2:18:48] Brother Brandham realized it was not
[2:18:50] about him but it was all about the God
[2:18:51] in him.
[2:18:59] God came first he said to express
[2:19:01] himself completely. God was in Christ.
[2:19:04] Second, to have the preeminence by this
[2:19:06] in his church, which is his body, the
[2:19:08] bride, until until he could have the
[2:19:10] preeminence to express himself himself
[2:19:13] through them. And thirdly, to restore
[2:19:15] the kingdom to the rightful position,
[2:19:17] going back to the Eden condition.
[2:19:19] Brother Brandham says when we then when
[2:19:22] we have accepted Jesus Christ that the
[2:19:24] whole thing is we're trying to go back
[2:19:26] to the Eden condition. Brother Brandham
[2:19:28] says when you've accepted Christ and you
[2:19:30] have the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[2:19:31] you're you basically are restored back
[2:19:33] to the Eden condition.
[2:19:36] He says that puts you on that puts you
[2:19:38] on self-will.
[2:19:41] He says, brother, somebody asked, well,
[2:19:42] brother Brown, what what do you mean by
[2:19:44] self-will? He says, you have to will to
[2:19:45] do the will of God. Adam and Eve had to
[2:19:48] will to do the will of God. We have to
[2:19:51] will to do the will of God. When it
[2:19:54] comes to holiness, why is why do people
[2:19:56] struggle over holiness?
[2:19:58] If you have something holy in you, to
[2:20:00] me, the that life that's going to
[2:20:02] manifest itself is also going to be holy
[2:20:04] because that's the life of God.
[2:20:07] Take that for what it's worth.
[2:20:09] But we have to begin to understand what
[2:20:10] God is trying to accomplish in this
[2:20:12] generation.
[2:20:15] Unveiling of God. He says, "No, notice
[2:20:17] then when we become part of him as you
[2:20:20] are the veil that veils him, you are a
[2:20:23] part of him as as no long as long as
[2:20:26] Christ is in you as Christ was in God
[2:20:29] because God was in him made him God."
[2:20:32] And that's that's a mouth mouthful. But
[2:20:35] God in him made him God. And as Christ
[2:20:38] is in you, the hope of glory, now you
[2:20:41] become a part of Christ. Actually, you
[2:20:43] become part of God.
[2:20:45] He says, he says, you going to be a part
[2:20:48] of me. You're going to be my bride. My
[2:20:50] life will be in your body. Just like
[2:20:53] husband and wife is one person. You and
[2:20:55] I are going to be one. At that day,
[2:20:57] you'll know that I am in the father. The
[2:20:58] father's in me, and I in you, and you in
[2:21:00] me. He says, see the oneness of God.
[2:21:04] The oneness of God.
[2:21:09] He's elevating us into the Godhead.
[2:21:12] He's elevating us to the place where we
[2:21:14] literally become a manifestation of God
[2:21:16] himself.
[2:21:19] I cannot comprehend that.
[2:21:22] But there's something inside of me
[2:21:23] that's saying, "No, this is true."
[2:21:26] Something inside of me, if you will
[2:21:28] yield to me, I can do this through you.
[2:21:32] Yes, sir.
[2:21:33] Okay. I still don't understand, but
[2:21:36] I'll take you at your word.
[2:21:38] He said, "All that God was, he poured
[2:21:40] into Christ." know that Christ was he
[2:21:42] poured into the church. There you are.
[2:21:43] It makes them all one. Now the bride now
[2:21:46] now now the bride are one. The tree of
[2:21:49] life. In other words, like husband and
[2:21:50] wife is one. Christ and this bride are
[2:21:52] one. Same thing, same spirit, same
[2:21:54] works, same signs, everything. For the
[2:21:56] works that I do, so you do also. This is
[2:22:00] where we are. We are at the end time.
[2:22:03] Amen.
[2:22:04] The seed that was planted at Pentecost
[2:22:06] now has to come to full maturity. Yes,
[2:22:08] sir.
[2:22:09] What was that seed? It was Christ.
[2:22:11] That's right.
[2:22:12] So full maturity implies that we have to
[2:22:15] be an exact replication of him.
[2:22:18] He was God in man. He was God and man
[2:22:22] joined.
[2:22:23] What are we to be? God and man joined.
[2:22:26] What does it do? It makes the two one.
[2:22:29] And this is to me this is what God
[2:22:32] through the prophet was trying to tell
[2:22:33] me.
[2:22:34] Yes sir.
[2:22:35] You are not just a sinner saved by
[2:22:37] grace.
[2:22:38] You are a part of God from the
[2:22:39] beginning. Amen.
[2:22:40] In the process of time, God brought you
[2:22:42] into manifestation. He brought you into
[2:22:45] manifestation for the sole purpose that
[2:22:46] he could express himself through you.
[2:22:48] That's
[2:22:48] right.
[2:22:49] But you have to yield to him.
[2:22:52] And he will not force that.
[2:22:54] Like I say, I didn't if I didn't want to
[2:22:56] go to pray for the brother in in
[2:22:58] Charlotte. Yeah. I said, "No, I'm too
[2:22:59] busy today. May maybe tomorrow. Maybe
[2:23:01] next week. I'll see if I can put on my
[2:23:03] calendar." No, that that's not No. God
[2:23:05] says, "I want you to do it and I want
[2:23:06] you to do it now." There's some days I
[2:23:08] get up and bad habit I make a list of
[2:23:11] all the things I want to accomplish and
[2:23:12] I start get up in the morning and I'm
[2:23:14] going to get started and all of a sudden
[2:23:15] we get a phone call. The whole day
[2:23:17] changes. I know with pastors that's a
[2:23:20] problem. I don't have a I I can turn off
[2:23:22] my cell phone.
[2:23:24] I told my pastor, "Take a day off. Turn
[2:23:26] it off." He says, "I can't. I'm the
[2:23:28] pastor." Well, okay. That's your
[2:23:29] problem. It's not mine.
[2:23:33] But but do you got can you begin to see
[2:23:35] what he is trying to accomplish now? We
[2:23:39] have to become the seed that was planted
[2:23:41] at Pentecost. We have to become the full
[2:23:44] maturity of the word manifested in our
[2:23:47] lives.
[2:23:48] That's right.
[2:23:48] Which mean like I I tried I tried to
[2:23:51] express the more I understand who God
[2:23:53] is, the more I understand who I am
[2:23:56] because I am an expression of him.
[2:23:59] Amen. And there becomes a more there's
[2:24:03] more and more of an awareness of what
[2:24:05] God is
[2:24:07] and and and and his nature and what he
[2:24:10] desires to do. There's more of an
[2:24:11] awareness of that in my life now than it
[2:24:14] was even six months ago. The revelation
[2:24:17] of God and what God is trying to reveal
[2:24:19] to the bride is coming so fast. It's
[2:24:22] almost too too it's almost coming too
[2:24:24] fast to keep up with it. Yes, sir.
[2:24:27] But yet God is going to take a God has a
[2:24:30] bride. Not going to have. No, God has a
[2:24:32] bride. And what God is going to do is
[2:24:35] he's going to sew live into that bride
[2:24:37] until him and that bride literally
[2:24:38] becomes a single entity
[2:24:40] where we literally become Jesus Christ.
[2:24:42] Amen.
[2:24:43] Let's just pray.
[2:24:47] Heavenly Father, we are so thankful Lord
[2:24:50] you've been with us today.
[2:24:52] Thankful Lord you are able to move my
[2:24:54] thoughts aside and be able hopefully
[2:24:56] express your thoughts and desires to the
[2:24:59] people
[2:25:00] because Lord we are at the end.
[2:25:03] I look around at the world. The world is
[2:25:06] in Satan's Eden. He can have it. But
[2:25:09] Lord you're telling us no we are the
[2:25:10] bride. We have been translated out of
[2:25:12] his kingdom into your kingdom. And now
[2:25:15] Lord you're so wanting to live through
[2:25:16] us until it's no longer us living but
[2:25:18] now it's you living your life through
[2:25:20] us.
[2:25:21] We know we have to be willing to submit
[2:25:23] but Lord you're creating with the within
[2:25:25] the bride the desire not out of law but
[2:25:28] out of love. We do what we do for you
[2:25:31] Lord because of the love we have for
[2:25:32] you. We want to honor you Lord out of
[2:25:35] respect for your word. We want to honor
[2:25:36] you Lord in the lives that we live and
[2:25:38] the things which we do so that the
[2:25:40] people in the world can see that there's
[2:25:42] something more than what Satan is
[2:25:43] offering. We can offer unto them
[2:25:45] something which is alive, something
[2:25:47] which is real. we can offer unto them
[2:25:50] yourself. So be with us, Lord, as we go
[2:25:52] as we as we pause and partake of
[2:25:54] refreshments and come back for the
[2:25:56] communion. Lord, the communion means so
[2:25:58] much to me
[2:26:02] because Lord, that's where we begin to
[2:26:04] show that we as the bride of Jesus
[2:26:06] Christ, we have unity one with the other
[2:26:08] because we are all partaking of the same
[2:26:10] elements and we believe that those
[2:26:12] elements are representation of you. So
[2:26:14] be with us to the afternoon. Lead and
[2:26:17] guide us, Lord. Let our thoughts always
[2:26:18] be centered on you. For I ask this in
[2:26:21] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:26:34] Dear Elijah's God is with us today.
[2:26:39] He's here in us. The word of God on us.
[2:26:45] Behold the bride of Christ in full.
[2:26:51] He's here. Elijah's God is here.
[2:26:57] She walks in step with the revealed word
[2:27:01] of the hour. She talks in demons we
[2:27:06] before his mighty power. Behold our
[2:27:11] strong and mighty tower. He's here.
[2:27:15] Elijah's God is here.
[2:27:19] He's here. Elijah's God is with us
[2:27:24] today. He's here in us. The word of God
[2:27:29] on display.
[2:27:31] Behold the bride of Christ in full.
[2:27:36] He's here. Elijah's God is near.
[2:27:41] She walks in step with the revealed word
[2:27:45] of the hour. She talks in demons flee
[2:27:50] before his mighty power. Behold our
[2:27:54] right to the strong and mighty power.
[2:27:58] He's here. Elijah God is here.
[2:28:04] Amen. Where's he at? He's here. He's
[2:28:08] here. not just out somewhere, but he's
[2:28:11] he's swn himself in our lives. Amen. I
[2:28:14] so appreciated that today. I appreciate
[2:28:16] what God is showing our brother null cuz
[2:28:18] it's the same thing we're striving for.
[2:28:20] It's the same revelation we want to
[2:28:22] become the greatest revelation of our
[2:28:24] lives. Not just something we talk about,
[2:28:27] but we want it to become a reality, not
[2:28:29] a concept, not a doctrine, but something
[2:28:31] we live in. Amen. Something that lives
[2:28:33] in us. And I believe that's what God's
[2:28:35] growing us to. Man, I so appreciated
[2:28:38] that. I wrote down we must become
[2:28:41] whatever he was. That's what we have to
[2:28:44] become. And what was he? He was God and
[2:28:48] flesh united as one. And we have to
[2:28:51] become the same thing. Man, for us it's
[2:28:54] hard because we've got this concept of
[2:28:56] like brother null said of our mistakes
[2:28:58] and our fallen nature. But he paid for
[2:29:00] all of that. That's all taken care of.
[2:29:03] He did that so that he could sanctify us
[2:29:06] with his blood so that he could unite
[2:29:07] with us again.
[2:29:09] So let his blood be enough. Let his
[2:29:11] sacrifice be enough. Let him having
[2:29:14] taken care of that. Let him have what he
[2:29:16] wants now. Oh God, I pray that it
[2:29:19] becomes a greater and greater revelation
[2:29:21] day by day until it becomes the reality
[2:29:24] of our lives.
[2:29:26] Amen. God bless you. Amen. and we're
[2:29:29] going to pray and we're going to
[2:29:30] dismiss, but I just want to remind you
[2:29:32] that the communion service will be this
[2:29:34] afternoon at 400 p.m. We'll be back
[2:29:36] here, Lord willing, for communion and
[2:29:38] feet washing. And may God bless you and
[2:29:41] we hope to see you then. Let's just bow
[2:29:43] our heads and thank the Lord. Lord
[2:29:45] Jesus, we thank you, Father, for you
[2:29:48] have been so good to us, Lord, that you
[2:29:51] in this day, you're constantly trying to
[2:29:53] give us the revelation of who we are.
[2:29:56] You're constantly, Lord, trying to
[2:29:58] dispel all the lies that we've grown up
[2:30:00] believing. All the lies that our nature
[2:30:03] and the world has told us of who we are.
[2:30:06] It's given us a false identity, Lord.
[2:30:09] But God, you've sent a prophet in this
[2:30:10] age. You restored your word. And you're
[2:30:12] here even through the five-fold ministry
[2:30:14] even today trying to dispel the lies and
[2:30:17] tell us the truth. And let truth
[2:30:19] prevail, Lord. Let your truth, Lord,
[2:30:22] become the overwhelming prevalent
[2:30:24] reality in our lives. And may all the
[2:30:26] lies be put away, Lord. And may this
[2:30:29] light be the light that shines in us.
[2:30:31] And God, may you have your way in us,
[2:30:33] Lord. For we must believe in order to
[2:30:36] please you. We must believe that you
[2:30:37] are. We must believe your word. We must
[2:30:40] accept it as truth. And we must
[2:30:42] resurrender ourselves to it. So God, I
[2:30:45] give myself to you, Aresh this morning.
[2:30:48] I want to be a vessel that you can flow
[2:30:50] through without hindrance. Lord, don't
[2:30:52] let my own mind and wrong understanding
[2:30:54] hinder your work. Don't let my own
[2:30:56] selfishness and self-will hinder your
[2:30:59] work. But Lord, I want to surrender all
[2:31:01] of myself to you that you can use this
[2:31:04] vessel to finish your work in this hour.
[2:31:07] Lord, we pray a special blessing over
[2:31:08] our brother null and sister Shirley.
[2:31:11] God, for the work you've called them to
[2:31:13] do, for the ministry that you've
[2:31:14] imparted under Brother Null. Lord, for
[2:31:16] the sacrifices they've made. May you
[2:31:18] continue to strengthen them and use
[2:31:20] them, Lord. May they be a blessing
[2:31:22] wherever they go and whoever they come
[2:31:23] in contact with. Bless us as we part and
[2:31:26] return, Lord, by your will later this
[2:31:29] afternoon. May you be with us and abide
[2:31:31] in us. And Lord, may we give you first
[2:31:34] place preeminence in all things. We
[2:31:37] surrender that to you. In Jesus Christ's
[2:31:39] name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[2:31:43] all and Lord willing, we'll see you back
[2:31:45] here at 4.

[2:31:54] bride in this last age. We have got the

[2:35:37] whose wonders
[2:35:39] are too many
[2:35:42] to tell.
