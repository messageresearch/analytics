[23:26] amen god bless you this morning
[23:29] man it's so good to be here together
[23:31] i really enjoyed that special brother
[23:32] tom thank you so much amen it's always
[23:35] good to hear you sing brother
[23:37] i mean while we're standing i'd like for
[23:39] us to pray together i found out last
[23:41] evening that sister rachel pitzenberger
[23:44] and sister sarah mcdivert's sister rhoda
[23:46] passed away last evening
[23:48] we've been praying for her for quite a
[23:49] while
[23:50] she struggled with poor health and the
[23:52] latest was in need of a valve
[23:54] replacement she'd been waiting for and
[23:56] and uh god chose to take her home last
[23:59] evening so i'd like for us to stand
[24:01] together and just pray for those
[24:03] families this is a big loss this is a
[24:06] very dear sister to both of them and a
[24:08] twin sister to sister rachel and so
[24:10] they've been very close all three of
[24:12] them been very close
[24:13] and so we take it as a as a loss and a
[24:15] loss for the assembly because rhoda was
[24:17] a friend of many of ours we knew her we
[24:19] were very well acquainted with her and
[24:21] she's always so happy and cheerful and
[24:23] full of life
[24:25] and she's full of faith and god had
[24:26] delivered her so many times
[24:29] we were looking forward to a testimony
[24:31] coming from this
[24:33] but no matter what we pray and how often
[24:35] we ask we always resign ourselves to
[24:37] god's sovereign will
[24:39] and god is perfect in all of his ways
[24:41] and when it goes a different way than
[24:43] what we anticipate we still put all of
[24:45] our trust in him
[24:47] for god does
[24:48] what is best in every situation but
[24:51] let's bow our heads together and pray
[24:55] dear lord jesus we thank you father
[24:58] we thank you lord that you understand
[25:01] our grief
[25:02] for you lord partook and flesh
[25:05] you stood at the grave of lazarus and
[25:07] you wept
[25:08] and you understand our weeping lord
[25:11] and god you've promised that you would
[25:13] be a comforter to us and
[25:15] i know lord sister rachel and sister
[25:18] sarah and their families and the family
[25:20] who wrote them
[25:22] they all need your comfort right now
[25:24] i prayed you'd go to them and undergird
[25:26] them by your hand lord strengthen them
[25:28] by your spirit
[25:30] comfort them with your very presence
[25:31] lord
[25:33] god we thank you for all that you did
[25:34] for rhoda how many times you healed her
[25:37] how many times you delivered her
[25:39] and lord we know that you do all things
[25:41] well so we're trusting in you and your
[25:43] decision to take her
[25:45] but god we're asking that you would help
[25:46] the grieving hearts
[25:48] that you would mend the broken hearts
[25:50] that you would help the families
[25:52] bless them as the next few days as they
[25:54] make arrangements and move towards a
[25:56] funeral
[25:57] lord i pray you would help them through
[25:58] it all and be very present help in a
[26:00] time of trouble
[26:01] be the strong power that they can run
[26:03] into and be safe
[26:05] lord envelope them with your love
[26:07] and let your presence be known among
[26:09] them help us as an assembly to encourage
[26:12] them to bless them and help them any way
[26:14] we can
[26:15] we love you father we thank you for your
[26:17] tender mercies and your grace
[26:19] how dearly you care for your children
[26:22] it means so much to us at times like
[26:24] this
[26:25] we ask your blessing over the service
[26:27] this morning as we look into your word
[26:30] would you open the word for us and open
[26:32] our hearts to receive it and take this
[26:34] word lord is the washing of the water
[26:36] the word and changes wash us cleanse us
[26:40] change us to match this word that you've
[26:42] given to us
[26:43] let us in all things be pleasing to you
[26:45] and may you have preeminence among us we
[26:47] pray
[26:48] in jesus christ's name we pray
[26:51] amen
[26:52] and god bless you while you're standing
[26:54] let's take our bibles if you would and
[26:56] turn to first timothy chapter one
[27:01] i want to say it was so exciting to see
[27:03] brother dave wood at his post of duty
[27:05] he was passing out the balance
[27:07] collecting them in his seat back there
[27:09] watching the door which is where he was
[27:11] last sunday
[27:13] and then between last sunday and this
[27:15] sunday the things that god has done for
[27:17] our brother is amazing amen
[27:19] so god is so good and so faithful and
[27:22] god knew that brother dave has a work to
[27:24] do he's got to get back to the door he
[27:25] couldn't let him be down too long so god
[27:29] got to undertook for him and we're
[27:30] thankful for them
[27:32] amen let's look here in 1st timothy
[27:36] and we're going to read
[27:37] uh verse 5 which is the verse we ended
[27:40] with last sunday
[27:42] it says now the end of the commandment
[27:44] is charity or love
[27:46] out of a pure heart and of a good
[27:48] conscience and of faith unfeigned or
[27:51] without pretense or without hypocrisy
[27:54] so the end of the commandment if you
[27:56] want to know at the end of the
[27:57] commandment what god desires the end of
[27:59] it all the the purpose and all of it the
[28:01] end of the commandment is love out of a
[28:04] pure heart
[28:06] and a good conscience
[28:08] and a faith
[28:09] unfeigned amen god bless you as you're
[28:12] seated
[28:14] and i want to continue on uh with a
[28:17] little bit of the thought from last
[28:19] sunday and i'd like to speak on lord
[28:22] willing the motive of the heart
[28:24] the motive of the heart you'll remember
[28:26] we talked about
[28:28] how last week the prophet of god called
[28:31] the thyatiran age the believers in the
[28:33] thyroid age the cream of the crop
[28:35] and we wanted to know why they were the
[28:37] cream of the crop and they were the
[28:38] cream of the crop because their works
[28:40] amen they did out of love their works in
[28:43] their service was done in love in a time
[28:46] when they were not receiving
[28:48] benefits i mean they weren't living a
[28:50] blessed life in the way of natural
[28:52] things they were under extreme
[28:53] persecution imprisonment loss of
[28:55] property they had it was during the dark
[28:58] ages and when the power of the catholic
[29:00] church had come to its peak and they
[29:02] were they were trying to snuff out amen
[29:05] the true religion and the believers that
[29:07] did not go along amen with their with
[29:09] their faith and and god speaks to them
[29:12] and says i know thy works and my love
[29:14] and my service and my patience and my
[29:16] faith and again he says in the end thy
[29:18] works and the last to be greater than
[29:20] the first meaning that even at the end
[29:22] of the age the works they were doing was
[29:24] even increasing as the tribulation with
[29:27] mountains as time would go on and in
[29:29] every other church age the works were
[29:31] diminishing amongst the believers it was
[29:34] going into weakness but these under the
[29:36] most
[29:37] intense of persecution in the dark of
[29:39] the days for the true word of god their
[29:42] works were continuing because they were
[29:44] born out of love amen not for reward not
[29:47] for benefit but it was just simply born
[29:49] out of love they served god because they
[29:52] loved god
[29:54] what a motive amen to serve god so i'd
[29:57] like to continue on with that thought
[29:59] and minister lord willing on the motive
[30:00] of the heart let's turn to psalm 24
[30:03] together
[30:04] and keep your bible handy i'd like to
[30:06] flip to quite a few scriptures
[30:08] here early on
[30:10] psalm 24
[30:15] and verse 3 psalm 24
[30:19] and verse 3.
[30:22] who shall ascend unto the hill of the
[30:25] lord or who shall stand in his holy
[30:27] place
[30:28] he that hath clean hands and a pure
[30:31] heart
[30:32] who has not lifted up his soul into
[30:33] vanity
[30:34] nor sworn deceitfully
[30:37] amen
[30:38] he shall receive the blessings from the
[30:40] lord and righteous in righteousness from
[30:42] the god of his salvation so who will
[30:46] attain to the hill of the lord who will
[30:48] stand in the holy place he that hath
[30:50] clean hands and a pure heart and hasn't
[30:54] puffed up his soul in vanity
[30:56] nor sworn deceitfully he was honest and
[31:00] true sincere and clean in his life this
[31:03] is the one that will make it
[31:05] and brother braham says in the message
[31:07] god keeps his word he says our god we
[31:09] come to thee in the name of the beloved
[31:11] son who has bid us to come saying ask
[31:14] the father anything in my name and i'll
[31:16] do it.
[31:17] so we come in jesus name to first repent
[31:19] of our own sin and our shortcomings and
[31:22] to ask thee to cleanse us
[31:24] and from cleanse us from all of our
[31:26] iniquity and to purge our thinking and
[31:28] that we will think upon the things that
[31:30] are right and pertaining to the kingdom
[31:32] of god now listen this is amazing this
[31:34] is the prophet of the age he's praying
[31:37] amen at this service and he's asking god
[31:41] to forgive him of his sins and his
[31:43] shortcomings and his failures amen needs
[31:45] he's honest to me this is a pure heart
[31:48] not somebody who will
[31:49] never admit to having sin or shortcoming
[31:53] or mistakes or failures but somebody who
[31:55] will so readily say i i am nothing
[31:58] without god i can't do it on my own amen
[32:00] that's a pure heart amen
[32:04] it goes on to say
[32:07] and may our thoughts be tonight on
[32:09] something that would better the kingdom
[32:11] of god and would better the people that
[32:12] are in the kingdom and may our hearts be
[32:14] purged from all foul things we desire to
[32:17] walk upright before thee with clean
[32:19] hands and a pure heart and oh god alone
[32:23] can do this
[32:24] amen we desire to walk with an upright
[32:27] heart with a pure heart and clean hands
[32:29] but only god can do that we can't do
[32:31] that ourselves and that's why he's
[32:33] praying this prayer oh god alone can do
[32:35] this and we pray father to cleanse our
[32:38] hands and purify our hearts wash us in
[32:40] the waters of separation from the things
[32:42] of the world by the word amen so we need
[32:46] the word of god in this day to purge us
[32:48] to wash us
[32:50] it's the waters of separation it's the
[32:52] washing of the water of the word amen
[32:54] and the word that has been restored in
[32:56] this day is a pure word and a clean word
[32:59] and it's here to purify us amen but it
[33:01] didn't just come to to purify the
[33:04] outside of us because you know you can
[33:06] you can take religion and fight man's
[33:09] religion
[33:10] you can bring a pure exterior amen but
[33:13] that's not the purpose the purpose in
[33:15] the end time is to have a pure heart
[33:18] amen a pure heart with pure motives a
[33:21] pure mind a clean mind a clean thought
[33:23] realm a mind that's focused and centered
[33:25] on christ a heart that desires him and
[33:28] him alone amen and in order to have that
[33:30] in such corrupt human flesh because
[33:33] remember the prophet of god told us
[33:35] every age from the fall man has grown
[33:37] weaker and wiser all the time there's a
[33:39] deterioration of humanity
[33:43] humankind because of hybridization
[33:45] because of the fall and the fallen
[33:47] condition and the perversion that is in
[33:49] our flesh and the perversion that is in
[33:51] the word and the world the corruption
[33:53] amen the these bodies in our minds amen
[33:57] are growing weaker all the time
[34:00] and so in an age that's so defiled amen
[34:03] come to the peak of defilement in
[34:06] humanity amen it's going to take a
[34:08] powerful word that can wash these hearts
[34:11] clean amen that can cleanse our minds
[34:13] when we live in a world where there's
[34:16] messages portrayed everywhere you turn
[34:18] your eyes and amen there's ungodliness
[34:20] there's there's lustful things there's
[34:22] there's wrong desires everything that is
[34:25] contrary to god is so visible and so
[34:27] visibly on display amen it's going to
[34:30] take a powerful word amen that can be
[34:33] the washing of the water of the word
[34:34] that can wash and purify our minds
[34:37] that can purify our hearts that can give
[34:40] us clean hands
[34:41] and oh god alone can do this
[34:45] let's turn to isaiah
[34:51] isaiah 29
[34:57] isaiah 29 and verse 13.
[35:04] isaiah 29 and 13.
[35:08] wherefore the lord said for as much as
[35:10] this people draw near me with their
[35:12] mouth
[35:13] and with their lips do honor me
[35:15] but have removed their heart far from me
[35:18] and their fear toward me is taught by
[35:20] the precept of man
[35:23] what he's saying is
[35:25] that their respect and reverence their
[35:27] fear of me is taught by the precept of
[35:30] man meaning the
[35:32] religious order and the traditions and
[35:34] the precepts the teachings of man are
[35:36] what are what keeping the people and
[35:39] respect to god but it is not the
[35:41] pureness of their heart
[35:43] it is the it is the precepts of man the
[35:46] teaching of man that are keeping them in
[35:48] the fear of god amen and that's not what
[35:51] god wanted he wanted a people that
[35:53] served him because they loved him amen
[35:56] if god just wanted subjects he could
[35:58] create subjects amen and he could put
[36:00] them under amen a tyrannical rule and
[36:03] where there's no liberty there's no free
[36:04] choice amen there's none of these things
[36:07] that god has given to humanity amen but
[36:09] he can just set up his laws set up his
[36:11] structures he can give absolutely no
[36:13] wiggle room
[36:15] and he can have subjects that would
[36:17] worship him and they would worship him
[36:19] in a pure clean way because there would
[36:21] be no uncleanness he could have people i
[36:23] mean he could have subjects that would
[36:24] be dressed right that would look right
[36:26] that would act right that would talk
[36:27] right and that would worship him the way
[36:29] he wants to be worshipped amen but that
[36:31] wasn't the desire of his heart amen he
[36:34] wanted people who could choose anything
[36:36] they wanted and in anything they wanted
[36:38] they would choose him
[36:40] that's what god wants that's what he's
[36:42] after in this day amen and
[36:44] and we know that the heart purpose of
[36:46] god was to have a bride of his own
[36:48] choosing and so he would choose a bride
[36:50] but he wanted to choose a bride that
[36:52] would choose him back
[36:55] amen
[36:56] he wasn't looking for a slave he wasn't
[36:58] looking for a subject he's looking for a
[37:02] companion he's looking for the the
[37:05] the counterpart of himself
[37:08] somebody that he can love that would
[37:10] love him back
[37:11] and so he says they're
[37:13] they they
[37:14] draw near me with their mouth
[37:18] and their lips to honor me
[37:20] but they remove their heart
[37:22] far from me
[37:24] so on the outside everything looked good
[37:27] but god looked deeper than the outside
[37:30] it looked fine it was fine and in the
[37:32] appearance it was fine in words it was
[37:35] fine in deeds but it wasn't fine in the
[37:38] heart
[37:40] let's go to ezekiel 33.
[37:58] ezekiel 33 and 31.
[38:06] ezekiel 33 and 31
[38:10] and they cut they come unto thee as the
[38:13] people cometh and they sit before thee
[38:15] as my people he's talking about they
[38:16] come to ezekiel to hear the words of the
[38:18] prophet they come unto thee as the
[38:21] people cometh and they sit before thee
[38:23] as my people and they hear thy words but
[38:26] they will not do them
[38:28] for with their mouth they show much love
[38:31] but their heart goeth after their
[38:33] covetousness
[38:34] they sit they come they sit they listen
[38:38] they come and they act like the people
[38:41] of god they come and listen as though
[38:43] they're people of the god and with their
[38:45] mouth they show much love but they don't
[38:48] do what the prophet said do
[38:51] amen in their heart they hold
[38:53] covetousness and all appearances they're
[38:55] the people of god and all appearances in
[38:57] all words amen they show much love amen
[39:00] but when the prophet gives instructions
[39:02] from god they won't do what the prophet
[39:05] said do and god could pierce through all
[39:08] the actions all the conduct addressed
[39:10] the words and he could go down into the
[39:12] heart and say they show much love with
[39:14] the mouth but their heart is far from
[39:16] you
[39:19] let's go to matthew
[39:22] chapter 15.
[39:24] we're going to stay in matthew for a
[39:25] little while now
[39:35] matthew chapter 15
[39:37] i'd like to read verse 8 jesus picks up
[39:40] what isaiah had said
[39:42] he said this people draw an eye unto me
[39:44] with their mouth and honoreth me with
[39:47] their lips
[39:48] but their heart is far from me
[39:52] so you can see that jesus was not
[39:54] interested in religion
[39:57] that god was not just interested in
[39:59] religious act or religious service but
[40:01] god was interested in the motive of the
[40:03] heart
[40:04] let's go to matthew 23.
[40:13] matthew chapter 23
[40:18] verse 1
[40:19] then speak jesus to the multitude and to
[40:21] his disciples saying the scribes and the
[40:24] pharisees sit in moses's seat
[40:26] and all therefore whatsoever they bid
[40:28] you observe
[40:30] that observe and do but do not ye after
[40:34] their works for they say and do not
[40:37] for they bind heavy burdens and grievous
[40:40] to be born and lay them on men's
[40:41] shoulders but they themselves will not
[40:44] move them with one of their fingers
[40:46] he's showing here a lack of care in the
[40:49] ministry
[40:51] he's showing that that they're teaching
[40:54] the fear of god by the pretense of man
[40:56] or the doctrines of man and they're
[40:58] creating heavy burdens for the people to
[41:00] bear by adding traditions and adding to
[41:03] the law of moses and they're creating a
[41:05] system that looks holy and looks
[41:07] righteous and looks clean and what
[41:08] they've done is they've added to amen
[41:11] the word and they've got the whole form
[41:14] and ritual and it looks so clean and
[41:16] they bind grievous burdens upon people
[41:18] but they do nothing themselves to lift
[41:21] the burden
[41:22] and what's amazing is when god gave
[41:24] requirements to his children god came
[41:26] down and he provided a means to meet the
[41:28] requirement and when they found that
[41:30] humanity could no longer meet it he
[41:32] provided himself as a lamb to meet the
[41:34] requirement because they couldn't do it
[41:36] so he eased everybody's burden himself
[41:40] that's a that's true ministry he's
[41:42] pointing to the difference between
[41:44] himself between god god wants holy
[41:46] living god wants people to live clean
[41:49] amen but then god will now come and
[41:51] through the death and shed blood of
[41:52] jesus christ and the sanctifying power
[41:54] of that blood he will now provide the
[41:56] spirit that will help you live the word
[41:59] he doesn't just give burden amen and
[42:01] does nothing not lift one finger to ease
[42:03] the burden but he'll tell you this is
[42:06] how you need to live this reflects my
[42:08] life and character and i will come down
[42:10] and i will be the power that lives it
[42:12] through you if you'll yield to me
[42:16] amen
[42:17] so
[42:18] so the the pharisees
[42:20] they built something that looked nice
[42:23] and they added doctrines and they
[42:26] and rituals and rules
[42:29] and bound them to the people but they
[42:31] themselves did nothing to lift a finger
[42:34] showing that they didn't care about the
[42:37] people they cared about the system
[42:39] and they cared about the appearance but
[42:42] they didn't care about the souls
[42:45] amen
[42:48] verse 5
[42:50] says but all their works they do for to
[42:53] be seen of men
[42:55] they make broad their phylacteries and
[42:58] enlarge the borders of their garments
[43:00] the phylacteries were they were they
[43:02] were little parchments that they wrote
[43:04] out the law of moses they would roll
[43:05] them up put them in a little box and
[43:07] attach them to leather straps and wrap
[43:09] them around their forehead and around
[43:11] their arm amen and so the the pharisees
[43:15] wouldn't just wear the phylacteries
[43:16] because they're supposed to have the
[43:17] word on their mind and the word in their
[43:19] hand and near their heart so that they
[43:21] wouldn't just have phylacteries like
[43:23] everybody else but they would broaden
[43:24] their phylactery so everybody could see
[43:27] how much they honored the word how much
[43:30] how righteous they were so they they it
[43:32] wasn't good enough just to wear the word
[43:34] like they were instructed to wear it
[43:36] they broadened the factories and brought
[43:37] them the border of their garment so
[43:39] everybody could see how religious they
[43:41] were and how much they loved god and god
[43:44] pierced right through that and said they
[43:46] show that they love but they don't love
[43:49] everything they do is to be seen of men
[43:53] all right everything they do is to be
[43:55] seen of men
[43:57] let's keep reading
[44:00] verse six
[44:01] and they love the uppermost rooms of
[44:04] feasts
[44:05] and the chief seats in the synagogues
[44:07] and the greetings in the markets and to
[44:09] be called of men rabbi rabbi
[44:12] but be not ye called rabbi for one is
[44:14] your master even christ and all ye are
[44:16] brethren
[44:17] and call no man your father upon the
[44:19] earth for one is your father which is in
[44:21] heaven
[44:22] neither be called
[44:24] masters for one is your master even
[44:25] christ but he that is greatest among you
[44:28] shall be your servant and whosoever
[44:30] shall exalt himself shall be abased and
[44:32] he that shall humble himself
[44:34] shall be exalted
[44:37] jesus was the perfect example
[44:39] of this this word that he's giving he
[44:42] humbled himself under the hand of god he
[44:44] humbled himself to bear the reproach of
[44:47] sin he humbled himself amen and
[44:49] subjected himself he subjected himself
[44:51] to earthly rulers he subjected himself
[44:53] even to religious rulers he he humbled
[44:56] himself on this earth amen and and he
[44:59] became the example for us but the the
[45:02] false ministry amen all they wanted to
[45:05] do was to be seen and recognized by men
[45:08] they didn't want to be recognized as a
[45:09] rabbi as a master they wanted the chief
[45:12] seats they wanted to be recognized they
[45:14] wanted to be greeted they wanted to be
[45:15] seen they wanted to be heard they wanted
[45:17] to be religious and so they gave the
[45:19] pretense or they gave the image to
[45:22] everybody else that they are a very
[45:24] religious person but god knew in their
[45:26] heart that they were deceitful they were
[45:28] wicked amen and in their heart was
[45:30] corruption
[45:33] let's go let's get down to verse 25.
[45:39] in verse 25 he says woe unto you scribes
[45:42] pharisees hypocrites
[45:44] for you may clean the outside of the cup
[45:46] of the platter but within they're full
[45:48] of extortion and excess
[45:50] thou blind pharisees cleanse first that
[45:52] which is within the cup and the platter
[45:55] that the outside of them may be clean
[45:57] also
[45:59] woe unto you scribes pharisees
[46:01] hypocrites for you are likened to whited
[46:03] sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful
[46:05] outward but are within full of dead
[46:07] men's bones and of all uncleanness
[46:11] even so you also outwardly appear
[46:13] righteous unto men but within you are
[46:15] full of hypocrisy and iniquity
[46:19] jesus knew that they were pretending
[46:22] and he knew that they were actually
[46:24] defiant in areas against the word of god
[46:27] amen but they were putting on like they
[46:29] were so religious this is the problem of
[46:32] living in a religious society
[46:35] the the israel in that day when you
[46:38] lived in jerusalem it was a very
[46:40] religious society amen and there was a
[46:42] hierarchy that was based not only in
[46:44] government but also in the religious
[46:47] realm and to live in a religious society
[46:50] amen it creates this kind of desire in
[46:54] people amen to be more religious to for
[46:57] the acceptance and for the admiration of
[46:59] other human beings amen and this is an
[47:02] absolute false religion but the reality
[47:04] is i don't i want to get to the place
[47:07] where i don't really care what anybody
[47:09] else thinks of me think good or think
[47:11] bad i would prefer you think good but if
[47:13] you think bad then you think bad but
[47:15] what matters most to me in all my life
[47:17] is what god thinks of me
[47:20] that how he views me is how i want i
[47:23] want to live for his pleasure for his
[47:25] view for his acknowledgement for his for
[47:28] for him to say you're doing good son
[47:32] that's what we live for amen and if we
[47:34] live for that we'll always come out
[47:36] right amen it doesn't matter how many
[47:38] mistakes we might make and stumblings we
[47:40] might make or what people may agree with
[47:42] us or disagree with us or think we're
[47:44] godly or think we're antichrist amen at
[47:47] the end of the day none of that matters
[47:49] and you can't control those things
[47:50] anyways no matter how hard you try to
[47:53] live clean before everybody somebody
[47:55] will misjudge your motives they'll
[47:56] misunderstand your actions they'll
[47:58] mislabel you and misrepresent you so we
[48:02] we need not to be trying to please men
[48:04] and get men to think well of us but we
[48:06] need to please god amen so we know that
[48:09] god thinks well of us because we love
[48:11] him more than anything else
[48:15] amen
[48:17] every one of god's chosen vessels every
[48:19] one of god's servants was loved and
[48:22] hated
[48:24] every one of them
[48:26] and so
[48:27] there's no point in trying to please man
[48:30] amen the pharisees they wanted they
[48:32] wanted the acknowledgement of man not
[48:35] the acknowledgement of god
[48:38] amen but
[48:39] that's not what we want to be like
[48:42] and it's going to take god to help us
[48:44] from going down that road
[48:46] because we live and still what tends to
[48:49] be very much a religious society
[48:51] especially in this part of america
[48:53] we're still part of what a remnants of
[48:56] the bible belt and there's still people
[48:58] you work with very religious there's
[49:00] churches everywhere it's a religious
[49:02] society and even growing up amen in the
[49:05] message and growing up in the realms of
[49:07] christianity it can create this this uh
[49:11] this desire to please everybody with
[49:14] this is a normal social pressure
[49:17] so wherever you grow up wherever
[49:19] atmosphere you grow up you want to fit
[49:21] in
[49:23] that's just the way it is and you want
[49:25] to be accepted by the people you're
[49:26] around and you want to be acknowledged
[49:28] as a good person by and it doesn't
[49:29] matter what environment you grow up amen
[49:31] if if you grew up in a muslim society
[49:34] you would have the same desire to be a
[49:35] good muslim to be respected by the other
[49:37] people to be accepted in society and be
[49:39] promoted in that society
[49:42] but the new birth changes all of that
[49:44] and it says now it doesn't matter where
[49:46] i grow up in what environment i grew up
[49:48] good or bad environment religious or
[49:50] non-religious i all i want to do is
[49:52] please the one who died for me man all i
[49:55] want to do is to gain favor with the one
[49:57] who showed me favor when i was unlovable
[50:00] he loved me anyways
[50:03] amen
[50:05] so
[50:06] so there's human tendencies
[50:09] that we must fight against
[50:11] there's human nature that we must always
[50:13] be at war against
[50:16] and the moment that we start to believe
[50:18] that we've rose above all social
[50:20] pressure
[50:21] and all human tendencies and all human
[50:23] nature you've
[50:25] we're setting ourselves up for a stumble
[50:28] but you got to realize that i live
[50:30] inside my enemy
[50:36] the greatest enemy i got is this flesh i
[50:38] was born into
[50:41] and i'm so close to it
[50:44] amen
[50:45] and so we we never need to we need to
[50:48] never lose sight of how close the enemy
[50:50] is and how how the devil's always trying
[50:54] to find avenue to find gain access
[50:57] through that old nature through that
[50:58] that carnality that remains in the flesh
[51:02] and in a fallen mind
[51:04] and we need to guard ourselves against
[51:06] these things guard ourselves against
[51:08] pride guard ourselves against desiring
[51:11] the acceptance of mankind and guard our
[51:13] heart against these things and
[51:14] constantly be coming back to what does
[51:17] god want what does god care about what
[51:19] matters most to god
[51:22] brother branham in the message the voice
[51:24] of the sign he's speaking of the uh when
[51:26] he goes by samaria he says i have needs
[51:29] to go by samaria and when he goes he
[51:31] sends away his disciples because there's
[51:33] a little woman there that he wants to
[51:34] talk to and she's a woman that's
[51:37] steeped in defilement she's living a
[51:38] defiled life she's she had several
[51:41] husbands the one she's with now is not
[51:42] her own and she's on the sixth and she's
[51:45] in this terrible terrible condition but
[51:48] here's what the prophet says says like
[51:50] the little woman with a pure heart and a
[51:52] defiled body
[51:56] and the pharisee with a pure body and a
[51:59] defiled heart
[52:02] it condemned one and saves the other
[52:06] here comes this woman with an absolute
[52:08] defiled body
[52:10] the pharisee you remember when the rich
[52:13] young ruler come to jesus christ and he
[52:15] says what must i do to gain
[52:17] eternal life to inherit eternal life and
[52:19] he says you know the commandments you
[52:21] know don't steal honor father and mother
[52:23] and he starts to go through some of the
[52:24] commandments that moses gave and he says
[52:26] i've done all of these from my youth
[52:32] this is a picture of a pharisee he he
[52:35] had lived clean he had lived pure he had
[52:37] done him from his youth amen and so he
[52:40] he felt pretty good about his condition
[52:42] and he was able to answer and the
[52:44] affirmative to jesus when he gave him
[52:46] some requirements to me he said i've met
[52:48] all of these requirements for my youth
[52:50] so he did not have a defiled body amen
[52:55] and he was obedient to the law of moses
[52:57] and and he was walking in the statutes
[52:59] and the judgments of the lord amen and
[53:02] right there in the midst of the the
[53:03] religion of the day amen but jesus said
[53:06] to him if thou will be perfect
[53:10] if that will be perfect sell all thou
[53:12] has and given to the poor and come
[53:14] follow me
[53:15] and and the man went away sorrowfully
[53:17] for he had much goods and jesus wept
[53:20] after him because jesus loved him amen
[53:22] jesus statement was not a statement of
[53:24] condemnation because he didn't love him
[53:26] it was an opportunity for this man to go
[53:28] past the religion and come to the
[53:30] reality
[53:32] pass the form past the ritual past the
[53:34] respect of people amen what would have
[53:37] happened to this man if he sold all of
[53:38] his goods
[53:40] where would he have been in society what
[53:42] would the religious leaders of the day
[53:44] thought of him well he would have been a
[53:46] fool he would have been mocked he would
[53:47] have been an outcast then he would have
[53:49] been nobody all the friends that he had
[53:50] would have no longer been friends if he
[53:52] had sold all of his wealth given to the
[53:54] poor and come follow jesus he would be
[53:56] just as much outcast as everybody else
[53:58] that followed jesus was
[54:01] and this man wasn't willing
[54:03] he wanted eternal life but he did not
[54:05] want to have a perfect heart
[54:11] jesus wasn't looking for those
[54:13] who just wanted a reward
[54:16] he was looking for those who wanted him
[54:21] he comes to a couple illiterate
[54:23] fishermen
[54:25] and all that they have is the boat in
[54:27] the net
[54:29] maybe a home maybe a change of clothes
[54:32] poor illiterate fishermen
[54:35] and they're washing their nets and he
[54:37] says come follow me and they dropped
[54:40] everything they had
[54:43] and they went and they followed the lord
[54:47] that's what he was looking for he stood
[54:49] by the treasury one day and he watched
[54:51] rich men blow trumpets and walk up with
[54:53] great pomp and great flair and ceremony
[54:56] and drop gold coins and silver and they
[54:59] probably dropped enough in to make it
[55:00] really rattle when it hit
[55:04] i mean they had blown the trumpet
[55:05] everybody now they had everybody's
[55:07] attention so you can't just you know it
[55:09] can't be ping
[55:11] what's the point of blowing the trumpet
[55:12] you know
[55:14] you got to pour in a bag and hand your
[55:16] stew for another bag and smile and look
[55:18] around at who's looking at you while you
[55:20] pour them back
[55:21] who's seeing me do this
[55:25] but there was a little widow with only
[55:27] two mites and she slipped up because she
[55:30] didn't have anything to be proud about
[55:31] she didn't have anything to boast about
[55:33] she didn't want anybody's attention
[55:35] because she didn't want anybody to see
[55:36] how little she could give to the lord
[55:38] but she took her two minds and she
[55:40] dropped them into the treasury
[55:44] no fanfare no pomp no ceremony no
[55:47] accolades no respect of mankind amen she
[55:50] wasn't pleasing anybody else and nobody
[55:52] else was pleased with what she did
[55:53] except one man standing there that day
[55:55] and that man was god in flesh and he
[55:58] looked at disciples and he said to see
[56:00] this woman she has put in just two mites
[56:02] that these have put in of their great
[56:04] abundance of their wealth but she put in
[56:07] all that she had
[56:10] [Music]
[56:12] and that was the offering that got the
[56:14] attention of god
[56:17] that was what was dropped in the
[56:19] treasury that day that god was pleased
[56:22] with and got the attention of god
[56:25] it's just amazing i was talking to
[56:27] somebody the other day and i thought we
[56:29] think of the judgment of rewards and and
[56:31] how uh the scripture says he that is
[56:34] faithfulness shall be made ruler over
[56:36] cities
[56:37] he is faithful and the least shall be
[56:38] made ruler over cities and so we know
[56:40] there's a judgment of rewards and those
[56:42] rewards will be dished out and we will
[56:44] we will be uh we will have
[56:46] responsibilities and works and things to
[56:48] do in the millennium and we will also be
[56:49] part of the government and those of us
[56:51] will be given rain over certain areas
[56:53] maybe governors magistrates of a city a
[56:56] village a uh i don't know a country i
[56:59] don't know but to whom much
[57:01] those who are faithful and little shall
[57:03] be made ruler over cities
[57:06] and i was thinking
[57:08] wouldn't it be ironic
[57:11] if the great preacher of the day
[57:14] makes it through the judgment of rewards
[57:17] and when we get to the millennium he's
[57:19] in charge of a village
[57:23] but the widow sister
[57:25] who nobody really knew about
[57:27] when we go through the judgment of
[57:28] rewards and get to the millennium
[57:30] she's governor and regent over a huge
[57:33] area
[57:35] and you say
[57:36] what
[57:39] because she gave all she had and she was
[57:42] faithful in everything god had for her
[57:43] to do whereas somebody who's
[57:45] tremendously gifted and equipped and has
[57:48] everything handed to them has support
[57:50] has help has finances has gifts amen and
[57:53] they do half-heartedly what god has
[57:55] given them to do they will not receive
[57:58] the same reward as those who maybe have
[58:00] less gifts no support no finances no
[58:03] helps around them but with what god gave
[58:05] them to do they were perfectly faithful
[58:07] and did it with all of their hearts
[58:09] [Music]
[58:12] it's amazing
[58:13] god has a certain equity and he knows
[58:15] how to keep everything in equity who
[58:17] much is given much is required
[58:20] and those who are faithful in the least
[58:22] shall be made ruler
[58:23] over much
[58:26] and so
[58:27] god judges the heart
[58:29] and he knows
[58:32] he knows what's in our heart
[58:34] there's no hiding it from him
[58:38] i mean we sometimes we even try to
[58:41] deceive ourselves
[58:43] and i would say the very worst deception
[58:45] of all self-deception
[58:48] that's what lucifer suffered from
[58:50] suffers from
[58:51] is self-deception
[58:54] and that is the worst deception of all
[58:56] is self-deception
[58:58] and it's amazing how sometimes
[59:01] uh you find such a need in humanity to
[59:05] rehearse our accolades
[59:09] to recycle the testimonies
[59:12] to talk about
[59:13] you know
[59:14] you know
[59:15] god did this and and i prayed and this
[59:18] person was healed and i went to that
[59:20] person and they come to the lord and i
[59:22] did this and i had this experience and i
[59:24] had that experience these testimonies
[59:25] are wonderful and encouraging to share
[59:27] but sometimes you see that that for
[59:30] certain individuals they become uh they
[59:32] become a a type of justification they
[59:35] become a type of
[59:37] measuring by which they measure their
[59:39] spirituality
[59:41] i say that's a terrible way to measure
[59:44] our spirituality man we must measure
[59:46] ourselves against the word and the
[59:48] desire in our heart to keep that word
[59:51] for love of god amen to love god first
[59:54] amen we can have all kinds of
[59:56] accomplishments in the spiritual realm
[59:58] we can have a i mean if you have a gift
[1:00:00] of faith and a gift of healing you can
[1:00:02] pray for tons of people and they'll get
[1:00:04] better but it doesn't mean that you have
[1:00:05] a pure heart before god it means that
[1:00:07] you have a gift
[1:00:09] same thing with preaching you can preach
[1:00:11] and preach in a way that blesses
[1:00:13] multitudes of people but it doesn't
[1:00:15] automatically equate to a pure heart
[1:00:18] and we think because people were blessed
[1:00:20] by the preaching that i'm accepted by
[1:00:21] god no people can be blessed because
[1:00:23] there's a gift and god will even allow
[1:00:25] the operation of the gift and the pool
[1:00:27] of the people are 50 of the gifts
[1:00:31] and they're going to be a wonderful
[1:00:32] tremendous service people can be blessed
[1:00:34] in that service amen but but at the end
[1:00:37] of the day that service how well the
[1:00:40] word was divided and how much the people
[1:00:41] were blessed is not the measure of how
[1:00:44] accepted you are by god or how pleasing
[1:00:46] you are to the lord amen what the the
[1:00:48] only measure is did you serve god from a
[1:00:51] pure heart amen was it was it a pure
[1:00:54] heart or did you like amen that people
[1:00:56] said that was a good service
[1:00:59] do we do it for the people
[1:01:02] how do we do it for god
[1:01:05] same thing with writing a song or
[1:01:06] singing a song or playing an instrument
[1:01:09] or or serving in any capacity or doing
[1:01:12] anything that god has gifted you to do
[1:01:14] it falls the same way who is it done for
[1:01:18] because if it's done because you like
[1:01:20] the attention if it's done because you
[1:01:22] like the praise now listen don't don't
[1:01:24] get me wrong amen if you know that god
[1:01:26] used you and it blessed somebody that
[1:01:28] feels like a million bucks and it ought
[1:01:30] to
[1:01:31] there should be such a satisfaction and
[1:01:33] knowing that god can take you a lump of
[1:01:35] clay use you for some purpose and it
[1:01:38] would bless one of his children that
[1:01:39] would that feels good it should always
[1:01:41] feel good but that feeling good can
[1:01:43] never equate to way that god views you
[1:01:48] just be happy that somebody was blessed
[1:01:49] and you felt good brother branham one
[1:01:51] time said there was a man that a man
[1:01:53] come up to him and said oh i just hate
[1:01:55] it when i preach and people said it was
[1:01:56] a good sermon or we appreciate that and
[1:01:59] brother bam said well i'm just more
[1:02:00] honest than you i like it
[1:02:05] i can say i like it too
[1:02:08] but when
[1:02:10] when people are done shaking your hand
[1:02:11] and patting you on the back and telling
[1:02:13] you they appreciate your song or your
[1:02:15] sermon
[1:02:16] they appreciate your family appreciate
[1:02:18] your life when you go back home and
[1:02:20] kneel down
[1:02:21] are you serving god with a pure heart
[1:02:24] amen
[1:02:25] was it done for him
[1:02:29] these are important questions to ask
[1:02:36] let's turn to first samuel
[1:02:44] first samuel chapter 16.
[1:02:59] in first samuel 16
[1:03:01] verse 6
[1:03:03] saul has been sent to anoint a new king
[1:03:05] over israel
[1:03:08] in verse 6 and suddenly came to pass
[1:03:10] when they were come
[1:03:11] that he looked at eliab which is the
[1:03:13] oldest brother of david the oldest of
[1:03:15] jesse's sons
[1:03:16] and said surely the lord's anointed is
[1:03:19] before him
[1:03:21] but the lord said unto samuel look not
[1:03:24] on his countenance or on the height of a
[1:03:25] stature because i have refused him
[1:03:28] for the lord seeth not as a man seeth
[1:03:30] for man looketh on the outward
[1:03:32] appearance but the lord looketh on the
[1:03:35] heart
[1:03:37] when god wanted the king he wanted a
[1:03:38] king after his own hearts
[1:03:41] the first king that he chose for israel
[1:03:43] was was a king after their choosing
[1:03:46] based off what they wanted and that
[1:03:48] choosing got a man who was powerful and
[1:03:50] he was head and shoulders taller and
[1:03:52] above all the other men in the kingdom
[1:03:55] so he gave them a warrior a powerful man
[1:03:58] a man of great stature to be their king
[1:04:01] that was their desire and when that
[1:04:03] desire failed amen now god was going to
[1:04:05] seek a king after his desire amen a man
[1:04:08] after his own heart god wasn't
[1:04:10] interested whether he's tall or short
[1:04:12] whether he was strong or weak god was
[1:04:14] looking at his heart because god can
[1:04:16] provide everything else that's needed
[1:04:20] god's not depending on our power our
[1:04:22] mind our strength he's not depending on
[1:04:24] our gifts god is god is not dependent on
[1:04:27] what we can bring to the table amen when
[1:04:30] we come to the lord it's not all of a
[1:04:31] sudden like god was seeking after you
[1:04:33] because you had a good ball of gifts
[1:04:35] inside of you and you got some mental
[1:04:37] prows and some strength and you got some
[1:04:38] support and god's like i need this one
[1:04:41] he'll do me a good job
[1:04:44] that's not what god wants amen god wants
[1:04:46] a willing heart a surrendered heart a
[1:04:48] perfect heart he can provide everything
[1:04:50] else
[1:04:54] and so
[1:04:58] jesus
[1:05:00] remember he says
[1:05:01] in in the gospel
[1:05:03] he says you heard it had been said a
[1:05:05] time of old
[1:05:06] that a man should not commit adultery
[1:05:10] but i say unto you
[1:05:12] he that looketh after a woman to lust
[1:05:14] after has committed adultery with her
[1:05:16] already in his
[1:05:17] heart
[1:05:20] you can see how when jesus shows up he
[1:05:23] is so unraveling the system of the day
[1:05:27] because i mean they knew not to commit
[1:05:30] adultery they had clean bodies but they
[1:05:32] had defiled hearts amen and in the clean
[1:05:35] body they may be able to say well i
[1:05:37] never committed adultery
[1:05:40] i never this and i never that they could
[1:05:42] even say i never stole but what they did
[1:05:45] is they changed the law of god and added
[1:05:47] a few more commandments so that they
[1:05:49] could strip a little wealth from their
[1:05:50] parents and put it back in their pocket
[1:05:52] so they stole
[1:05:55] but they stole in a religious way
[1:05:59] and then they because they didn't commit
[1:06:01] adultery but jesus comes down a couple
[1:06:03] layers deeper and say you know in your
[1:06:06] flesh you may never take in your flesh
[1:06:08] and committed the act but if you looked
[1:06:10] after a woman to lust after her you have
[1:06:12] committed adultery already with her in
[1:06:14] your heart because it's the heart that
[1:06:16] matters amen it's not that the flesh
[1:06:18] doesn't matter amen but the flesh you
[1:06:21] can get right and have the heart wrong
[1:06:22] and everything's still wrong amen you
[1:06:24] can have the flesh completely wrong but
[1:06:26] get the heart right and a right heart
[1:06:28] will work its way out to the flesh and
[1:06:30] bring the flesh subject to the life on
[1:06:32] the inside
[1:06:34] that's why he said you you whited walls
[1:06:36] you you whited sepulchers amen outside
[1:06:39] your clean you wash the outside of the
[1:06:41] pot oh he said you're fools amen wash
[1:06:44] the inside so that the out can be clean
[1:06:46] outside can be cleaned too
[1:06:49] you're like sepulchers outside they're
[1:06:51] white and they're pretty amen but inside
[1:06:53] they're full of dead men's bones amen
[1:06:55] god is concerned with what goes on in
[1:06:58] our heart until our heart is right we're
[1:07:01] not right
[1:07:03] coming to church every service paying
[1:07:05] tithes every service amen giving
[1:07:07] offerings giving to the poor helping one
[1:07:09] another those are good things and they
[1:07:11] ought to be done and they never should
[1:07:12] be diminished but all of them will not
[1:07:15] make us right the only thing that will
[1:07:16] make us right is within our heart we
[1:07:19] worship god from a pure heart and
[1:07:21] surrender to him with all of our hearts
[1:07:24] that's what makes us right
[1:07:28] so
[1:07:29] we got to fight the deception
[1:07:32] you know when
[1:07:35] when
[1:07:36] when we live
[1:07:39] in a place
[1:07:41] where we can encourage one another
[1:07:43] and we have friendship and camaraderie
[1:07:45] with one another
[1:07:47] and we we create such a
[1:07:50] atmosphere the believers create such an
[1:07:54] atmosphere you can be held a little bit
[1:07:57] by atmosphere
[1:08:01] you can be kept somewhat by atmosphere
[1:08:03] because you know these are friends these
[1:08:05] are family these are people that you
[1:08:07] love and you don't want to disappoint
[1:08:09] them
[1:08:10] and you don't want to look bad in their
[1:08:12] eyes and you don't want to hurt anybody
[1:08:13] else so
[1:08:15] we resist certain kinds of sin
[1:08:18] because of the atmosphere
[1:08:22] right
[1:08:25] because what will the people at church
[1:08:26] think what will my family think i don't
[1:08:28] want to disappoint i don't want them to
[1:08:29] hurt i don't want them to think bad and
[1:08:31] that atmosphere it's not a wrong
[1:08:33] atmosphere it's not a bad evil wicked
[1:08:35] atmosphere but that atmosphere which
[1:08:37] should be there ought to be there it can
[1:08:39] hold us a little bit amen and there can
[1:08:41] come a deception from that and saying i
[1:08:43] haven't committed adultery i haven't
[1:08:45] stole i haven't did this i haven't done
[1:08:47] that amen and i don't even get a
[1:08:48] speeding ticket because i know what the
[1:08:50] quote says
[1:08:57] but god wants to go deeper
[1:09:00] than being held by an atmosphere
[1:09:03] or being part of a church no matter how
[1:09:05] correct it is or how on the word it is
[1:09:07] that's not what god's interested in
[1:09:09] god's interested in your heart the
[1:09:11] church should be right the atmosphere
[1:09:12] should be right the conduct should be
[1:09:14] right there ought to be holiness there
[1:09:16] needs to be holiness it's a requirement
[1:09:18] in this day amen but what needs to be
[1:09:20] clean is your heart needs to be cleaned
[1:09:22] first and then the outside will be clean
[1:09:26] let's go to matthew chapter 6.
[1:09:40] remember the
[1:09:42] pharisee that goes into the temple
[1:09:46] and there was a publican i believe it
[1:09:48] was there and
[1:09:50] the publican would not so much as raise
[1:09:52] his head
[1:09:54] and he beat upon his chest and he said
[1:09:56] god
[1:09:57] forgive me and save me a sinner
[1:10:01] the pharisee comes in
[1:10:03] and says oh god i thank you
[1:10:07] that you have not made me like the dogs
[1:10:10] and you've not made me like this
[1:10:11] publican
[1:10:13] i thank you
[1:10:14] that you've made me
[1:10:16] perfect
[1:10:18] wonderful
[1:10:20] i'm so thankful i'm not like this and
[1:10:21] i'm not like that and i'm not like this
[1:10:24] but it was the publican who knew he was
[1:10:27] nothing it was the pharisee who was
[1:10:29] deceit he deceived himself
[1:10:32] into thinking he was something when he
[1:10:34] was nothing
[1:10:36] he was standing there in self-deception
[1:10:38] and all of his pride and all of his
[1:10:40] criticism and all of his arrogancy he's
[1:10:43] standing there talking to god and saying
[1:10:45] god i thank you that i'm not like other
[1:10:47] men and i thank you that i'm not like
[1:10:49] this public and i thank you that i i'm
[1:10:51] not defiled like all these creatures
[1:10:53] defiled around me i thank you thank you
[1:10:55] thank you amen and it was all pride it
[1:10:57] was all arrogancy it was all puffed up
[1:10:59] vanity amen but the publican was getting
[1:11:02] down to business and being real with god
[1:11:04] and not even looking up but beating upon
[1:11:06] his chest and said god i'm a sinner save
[1:11:09] me i need your help
[1:11:12] he said that man went up to his house
[1:11:14] justified but not the pharisee
[1:11:19] i don't
[1:11:20] to me
[1:11:21] this is just me
[1:11:25] all the doctrine all the truth that has
[1:11:27] been restored
[1:11:29] is to bring us to the right life
[1:11:34] it is to so open the mind of god that we
[1:11:37] know god
[1:11:39] we know his nature his character it was
[1:11:42] displayed through us down through the
[1:11:43] characters in the bible it was displayed
[1:11:45] in jesus christ it was displayed again
[1:11:47] in the prophet of the end time it was it
[1:11:49] was it was written it was displayed the
[1:11:52] seals were open so that we could see
[1:11:54] what was god's great desire all along
[1:11:56] what is god like what does he desire
[1:11:58] what does he want what's been his
[1:12:00] objective amen and that word should not
[1:12:03] bring a pharisee attitude amen where all
[1:12:06] of a sudden i thank you god that i know
[1:12:08] the truth
[1:12:09] well i'm super thankful that i know the
[1:12:11] truth but if i know the truth and don't
[1:12:13] live the truth then i'm worse off than
[1:12:15] if i didn't know the truth
[1:12:19] i thank you that i understand the seals
[1:12:21] but you know you realize that if you say
[1:12:24] that statement that you know the message
[1:12:26] and you know the seals you've placed
[1:12:28] yourself in a place of responsibility
[1:12:30] where now there's no excuse there's no
[1:12:32] cloak for sin there's no covering there
[1:12:34] is no excuse amen because the you're
[1:12:36] saying i've seen the open word i've seen
[1:12:39] christ on full display i've seen the
[1:12:41] unveiling of god i know his nature i
[1:12:44] know his plan i know his desire and you
[1:12:46] have taken away any excuse you could
[1:12:48] possibly have to live a pharisee life
[1:12:53] jesus says because you say you see your
[1:12:55] sins remain
[1:12:59] and so there's there's no pride in that
[1:13:02] there's a there's a humility there's an
[1:13:04] embassing that comes and saying oh god
[1:13:08] how can i live what you want me to live
[1:13:10] this day without your help
[1:13:13] how could i ever be what you're calling
[1:13:15] for if it's not for your spirit if you
[1:13:17] don't wash me i can't do it if you don't
[1:13:20] help me i'll never make it
[1:13:24] this is such a difference in attitude
[1:13:28] in matthew chapter 6 verse 1
[1:13:33] it says
[1:13:36] take heed that you do not your alms
[1:13:38] before men to be seen of them
[1:13:41] otherwise you have no reward of your
[1:13:43] father which is in heaven
[1:13:46] therefore when thou doest thine alms do
[1:13:48] not sound a trumpet before thee as the
[1:13:50] hypocrites do in the synagogues and in
[1:13:52] the streets that they may have glory of
[1:13:54] men
[1:13:55] verily i say unto you
[1:13:57] they have their reward
[1:13:59] this to me is one of the
[1:14:01] this is one of the saddest statements
[1:14:04] that i read
[1:14:07] they
[1:14:08] they were going to make
[1:14:10] an offering
[1:14:11] supposedly to god
[1:14:14] but they sounded the trumpet the
[1:14:16] hypocrites did and they wanted glory of
[1:14:18] man they wanted the recognition so they
[1:14:20] sounded the trumpet they put their
[1:14:22] offering in and they received the praise
[1:14:25] of men
[1:14:27] the praise of god
[1:14:30] they pleased man they did not please god
[1:14:32] and jesus says and they have their
[1:14:36] reward
[1:14:37] meaning they already got what they
[1:14:39] wanted
[1:14:40] they're not getting anything else
[1:14:43] no eternal life
[1:14:45] no salvation no deliverance no change
[1:14:49] they have their reward
[1:14:52] he goes on
[1:14:55] verse 3
[1:14:56] but when thou doest alms let not thy
[1:14:58] left hand know what thy right hand doeth
[1:15:01] that thine alms may be in secret and the
[1:15:03] father which seeth in secret shall
[1:15:05] reward the open name
[1:15:06] and when thou prayest thou shall not be
[1:15:08] as the hypocrites are for they love to
[1:15:11] pray standing in the synagogue and in
[1:15:13] the corners of the streets and they may
[1:15:14] be seen of men verily i say unto you
[1:15:17] they have their reward
[1:15:19] but thou when thou prayest enter into
[1:15:22] the closet and when thou has shut thy
[1:15:24] door pray to the father which is in
[1:15:26] secret and thy father which see it in
[1:15:28] secret shall reward thee openly
[1:15:33] the question is are we eligible for open
[1:15:36] rewards
[1:15:37] because of secret prayer
[1:15:41] let's go to verse 16.
[1:15:45] it says moreover when you fast be not as
[1:15:48] the hypocrites of a sad countenance
[1:15:51] for they disfigure their faces that they
[1:15:53] may appear unto men to fast verily i say
[1:15:56] unto you they have their reward
[1:15:59] but thou when thou fast when thou
[1:16:01] fastest anoint thine head and wash thy
[1:16:03] face that thou appear not unto men to
[1:16:05] fast but unto thy father which is in
[1:16:07] secret and the father which seeth in
[1:16:10] secret shall reward thee openly
[1:16:14] this is such a telling passage of
[1:16:17] scripture
[1:16:18] jesus is just exposing the heart of the
[1:16:21] pharisees that what they really want is
[1:16:24] they want
[1:16:25] acknowledgement they want praise they
[1:16:28] want to be seen and they want to be
[1:16:31] praised of men and so god is allowing
[1:16:34] them to have exactly what they want
[1:16:37] they're receiving their reward because
[1:16:40] it is the desire of their heart the
[1:16:42] desire of their heart is to be praised
[1:16:44] the desire their heart is to be seen the
[1:16:46] desire of their heart is to be my
[1:16:47] admired called rabbi given the chief
[1:16:49] seat so they have the reward god's not
[1:16:52] even taking it away from them
[1:16:54] they're receiving their reward but it's
[1:16:56] going to be a shock at the white throne
[1:16:58] judgment when they realize that in this
[1:17:00] life you already received your reward
[1:17:02] because you already were given the
[1:17:03] desire of your heart and you had it in
[1:17:05] this life there's no other reward for
[1:17:08] you because there was nothing else you
[1:17:09] desired
[1:17:15] you know and that's when you think about
[1:17:18] if we come if we come to the word with
[1:17:21] the wrong attitude and the wrong
[1:17:23] approach and we're raised up in a
[1:17:25] certain belief or we've come to it and
[1:17:27] and we've been becoming immersed in a
[1:17:29] certain culture in a certain social
[1:17:31] setting in a certain way amen and what
[1:17:34] we want is the acceptance if we want the
[1:17:37] social acceptance we want the admiration
[1:17:40] of those that we fellowship with
[1:17:43] then you may
[1:17:45] be getting your reward
[1:17:47] right now
[1:17:51] god
[1:17:52] god's not going to break it up and not
[1:17:54] not going to to because you've got the
[1:17:57] wrong desire he's not going to cast you
[1:17:59] away amen he didn't with the pharisees
[1:18:01] he tried to bring correction they
[1:18:02] rejected it he left him alone and let
[1:18:03] him get the reward
[1:18:05] but if the only desire of the heart is
[1:18:08] to be accepted among a group of people
[1:18:09] and have love and have society and have
[1:18:12] fellowship amen if that's the only
[1:18:15] desire of the heart then you can attain
[1:18:17] to that in this life
[1:18:19] you can have it i can have it
[1:18:22] but i say god i want something so much
[1:18:25] deeper than that
[1:18:27] i mean i want fellowship don't get me
[1:18:29] wrong i want camaraderie i want
[1:18:31] fellowship and i want love and i want
[1:18:33] that atmosphere those things are fine to
[1:18:35] want and desire and to enjoy amen but
[1:18:38] they have to be outcroppings amen they
[1:18:40] have to be additional blessings that's
[1:18:41] not the only reward that i want i want
[1:18:44] him amen that's my reward and the only
[1:18:46] reward that will satisfy is him
[1:18:50] amen not just not even just eternal life
[1:18:53] amen i want him what would eternal life
[1:18:56] be without christ
[1:19:00] i
[1:19:01] i want my reward is him amen my portion
[1:19:04] is him my desire is him and everything
[1:19:07] he gives outside of that is bonus
[1:19:09] blessings additional blessings and i
[1:19:11] love everyone and i will enjoy every
[1:19:13] blessing that he ever gives to me and be
[1:19:15] satisfied in it but i'll never be
[1:19:17] satisfied in it alone i can't just have
[1:19:20] the gifts i must have the giver amen i
[1:19:23] can't just have the blessings i have
[1:19:24] must have the one who gives out the
[1:19:26] blessings that's the desire of my heart
[1:19:29] i said god make that the desire of my
[1:19:31] only god can do this the only thing i
[1:19:33] can do is come to him and be honest amen
[1:19:36] i can't change myself i can't make
[1:19:38] myself what i'm not but what i can do is
[1:19:40] come to god and say god honestly
[1:19:43] honestly i realize i've been wanting
[1:19:45] acceptance from my brothers and sisters
[1:19:47] more than i wanted acceptance from you
[1:19:49] god forgive me
[1:19:51] forgive me and wash me and give me a
[1:19:53] pure heart it's not that you can change
[1:19:55] your selfie i mean you can go try all
[1:19:57] you want to change yourself it's not
[1:19:59] going to work
[1:20:02] it's not through effort it's not through
[1:20:03] discipline it's not it's not the only
[1:20:06] thing that the only thing that we can do
[1:20:08] under the preaching of the word when it
[1:20:09] peels back a layer and exposes something
[1:20:11] in us is just admit it to god amen bow
[1:20:14] our heads before him and say god i
[1:20:16] realize lord that i need a more fervent
[1:20:19] desire for you and i need
[1:20:21] a purer heart
[1:20:25] i can get away from the carnal things
[1:20:28] and into those things that really matter
[1:20:31] i don't want to only receive my reward
[1:20:34] in this life
[1:20:37] i don't want
[1:20:39] if the desire of my heart is only so
[1:20:41] deep
[1:20:42] my reward will only be so much
[1:20:45] and i don't want it to be only now
[1:20:48] but i want to be with christ for
[1:20:50] eternity
[1:20:54] i want to look at
[1:20:55] the life of saul for a minute and then
[1:20:57] go to the life of david and i want to
[1:21:00] show a corrupt heart versus a pure heart
[1:21:02] let's go to first samuel chapter 15.
[1:21:06] let me just look at these two characters
[1:21:08] just
[1:21:09] for a few moments
[1:21:21] so
[1:21:28] actually let's back up to 13.
[1:21:31] i'm going to start and read a passage
[1:21:32] out of 13.
[1:21:35] chapter 13 is just after saul becomes
[1:21:37] king of israel he's anointed he's
[1:21:39] declared king of israel
[1:21:42] jonathan then destroys the garrison of
[1:21:44] the philistines and all the philistine
[1:21:46] army comes up to destroy israel
[1:21:49] israel says there's there wasn't a man
[1:21:51] in israel that had a sword in his hand
[1:21:53] besides saul and jonathan they didn't
[1:21:56] have weapons the philistines had taken
[1:21:58] away all their smiths they had no
[1:21:59] weapons all they had was farm implements
[1:22:01] and tools they had no weapons they had
[1:22:03] no standing army they had nothing and
[1:22:05] the philistines were coming against them
[1:22:06] with thirty thousand chariots six
[1:22:08] thousand horsemen and and foot troops as
[1:22:11] the sand of the sea innumerable
[1:22:14] and saul is there with 600 men
[1:22:18] and only two swords
[1:22:21] you can see he's vastly outnumbered he's
[1:22:24] afraid
[1:22:25] and he's waiting and he's waiting for
[1:22:28] samuel to come to offer a sacrifice to
[1:22:31] the lord and while he's waiting the
[1:22:32] people are seeing the troops coming
[1:22:34] they're hearing the numbers and the
[1:22:36] people that were gathering this all
[1:22:37] start running away and hiding even a
[1:22:39] great number of them go across jordan to
[1:22:41] hide out
[1:22:43] so here's saul in this situation where
[1:22:46] he's a new king he's got 600 men with
[1:22:48] him two swords waiting for samuel the
[1:22:51] prophet to come now samuel's delaying is
[1:22:53] coming he's not coming at the appointed
[1:22:55] time amen the armies are coming the
[1:22:57] people are leaving and he's in us he's
[1:22:59] in a fix
[1:23:02] and and let's look at verse 8 first
[1:23:04] samuel 13 8
[1:23:06] and he tarried seven days according to
[1:23:08] the set time that samuel had appointed
[1:23:10] but samuel came not to gilgal and the
[1:23:12] people were scattered from him and saul
[1:23:15] said bring hither a burnt offering to me
[1:23:17] and peace offerings and he offered the
[1:23:19] burnt offerings he was supposed to wait
[1:23:22] for samuel
[1:23:23] but he didn't he made the offering
[1:23:25] himself
[1:23:26] and it came to pass that as soon as he
[1:23:28] had made an end of offering the burnt
[1:23:29] offerings behold samuel came
[1:23:32] he was just a little bit too early
[1:23:36] you think god didn't time that just
[1:23:38] right
[1:23:40] and saul went out to meet him and he
[1:23:42] that he might salute him and samuel said
[1:23:45] what hast thou done and saul said
[1:23:47] because i saw that the people were
[1:23:49] scattered scattered from me and that
[1:23:51] thou comest not within the days
[1:23:52] appointed and that the philistines
[1:23:54] gathered themselves together and mitch
[1:23:56] mash therefore said i the philistines
[1:23:58] will come down now upon me to gilgal and
[1:24:01] i have not made supplication unto the
[1:24:03] lord i forced myself therefore and
[1:24:06] offered a burnt offering
[1:24:07] and samuel said to saul thou has done
[1:24:10] foolishly thou has not kept the
[1:24:12] commandment of the lord thy god which he
[1:24:14] commanded thee for now would the lord
[1:24:16] have established thy kingdom upon israel
[1:24:18] forever
[1:24:19] but now thy kingdom shall not continue
[1:24:22] the lord has sought him a man
[1:24:24] after his own heart and the lord hath
[1:24:26] commanded him to be captain over his
[1:24:28] people because thou has not kept that
[1:24:30] which the lord commanded thee
[1:24:34] so
[1:24:35] there's already a prophecy going out
[1:24:37] that god is going to take the kingdom
[1:24:39] from saul and give it to another man and
[1:24:41] that man is going to be a man we know
[1:24:43] after god's own heart but you can see
[1:24:46] saul i want to start seeing saul's
[1:24:48] attitude we've talked about this before
[1:24:50] but it's so interesting that when he
[1:24:53] sees the enemy coming he sees the people
[1:24:57] scattering they're starting to leave
[1:24:58] because the people still had confidence
[1:25:00] in samuel they wanted samuel to come if
[1:25:02] samuel stood by him amen the people
[1:25:04] would have confidence in saul amen and
[1:25:07] they had faith in the offering so now
[1:25:09] because samuel's delaying he rushes and
[1:25:11] he makes the offering himself and what's
[1:25:13] he trying to do he's trying to get god's
[1:25:15] favor he's trying to keep the people
[1:25:17] together
[1:25:19] he's trying to save himself
[1:25:23] he's trying to save himself
[1:25:27] and he's going against the commandment
[1:25:29] of god to do so
[1:25:33] see
[1:25:35] i think whenever we begin to move into
[1:25:37] this realm of self-preservation
[1:25:41] that we begin to manifest what's really
[1:25:43] deep in the heart
[1:25:46] because
[1:25:47] if we completely trusted in god we would
[1:25:50] completely trust in god
[1:25:52] if saul had confidence in god in the
[1:25:55] word that came through samuel he would
[1:25:57] have just stayed put and waited because
[1:25:59] he had confidence in god amen but his
[1:26:02] his his moving forward against the
[1:26:05] commandment of god he was trying to
[1:26:06] preserve his troops he was trying to
[1:26:09] preserve face he was trying to maybe
[1:26:11] build morale i don't know although he's
[1:26:13] trying to do but he was trying to save
[1:26:15] himself he was trying to preserve the
[1:26:17] situation and in doing so he ended up
[1:26:19] losing the kingdom
[1:26:22] because god doesn't need you to save
[1:26:24] yourself he needs you to love him and
[1:26:26] trust him he needs you to love him more
[1:26:28] than anything else he needs you to love
[1:26:30] him more than you love your
[1:26:34] flesh to say
[1:26:37] god i'm standing behind your word if it
[1:26:40] kills me it kills me but this is your
[1:26:42] word
[1:26:44] so now we begin to see the attitude in
[1:26:47] the approach of song
[1:26:50] let's look at first samuel 15 now
[1:26:54] chapter 15
[1:26:57] that is verse 20.
[1:27:02] in verse 15 samuel brings the word of
[1:27:05] the lord to send saul to destroy the
[1:27:06] amalekites we've talked about this story
[1:27:08] before he's just utterly destroyed
[1:27:11] utterly every suckling every child every
[1:27:14] man every woman every beast everything
[1:27:16] was to be destroyed but he didn't
[1:27:18] destroy it all he saved back the choices
[1:27:20] of the livestock and he saved agag king
[1:27:23] and samuel now comes to him and he says
[1:27:26] here in verse 20 and saul said unto
[1:27:28] samuel yeah i have obeyed the voice of
[1:27:31] the lord and have gone the way which the
[1:27:33] lord sent me
[1:27:34] and i brought ag the king of amalek and
[1:27:37] have utterly destroyed the amalekites
[1:27:39] but the people took of the spoil
[1:27:42] sheep and oxen the chief of the things
[1:27:44] which should have been utterly destroyed
[1:27:46] to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in
[1:27:49] gilgal i think it's amazing to me the
[1:27:52] human nature i love the bible the way
[1:27:54] the bible is written because it's too
[1:27:56] perfect because it's human nature
[1:27:58] because if we can give a religious
[1:28:00] justification from doing what we do we
[1:28:02] always feel safe behind the religious
[1:28:05] justification
[1:28:06] is that right think about standing in
[1:28:08] the gap and the prophet of god wanted to
[1:28:10] go up to near alaska up to bc wanted to
[1:28:14] be a trapper stomp out he started using
[1:28:16] the bible as justification you know like
[1:28:18] prophets of old they didn't mingle with
[1:28:20] the people they stayed out in the
[1:28:21] wilderness to themselves god gave him a
[1:28:22] message they would stomp out and deliver
[1:28:24] it and stomp him back he's using
[1:28:25] religious justification and eventually
[1:28:28] he admits i was just wanting to do that
[1:28:31] for myself so that i could hunt and fish
[1:28:36] aren't you glad we had an honest prophet
[1:28:37] in this day
[1:28:40] and so here saul
[1:28:42] before when he offers without waiting on
[1:28:45] samuel he says i forced myself i really
[1:28:48] didn't want to do it
[1:28:50] but i forced myself because i was they
[1:28:53] were going to come upon me and i didn't
[1:28:54] have the favor of god
[1:28:57] how can you have the favor of god by
[1:28:59] disobeying god
[1:29:01] how can you force yourself to disobey
[1:29:03] god to obtain the favor of god
[1:29:06] it shows that saul had a different
[1:29:08] motive altogether
[1:29:10] and now when he saves back the choices
[1:29:13] he says no the people did that the
[1:29:15] people did that so that they could make
[1:29:17] a sacrifice to the lord isn't that a
[1:29:19] good thing no a good thing is to do what
[1:29:21] god says that's a good thing amen to
[1:29:24] deviate from that is wicked his evil is
[1:29:27] his antichrist amen the good thing is to
[1:29:29] do exactly what god said in his word to
[1:29:32] do
[1:29:33] that's why he wants listen this this has
[1:29:36] been the dilemma with god amen for
[1:29:38] thousands of years what has god wanted
[1:29:40] he has always wanted somebody that will
[1:29:42] just do what he says no more no less
[1:29:47] just obey his word and love him with all
[1:29:49] of their heart
[1:29:50] that's what god has wanted all this time
[1:29:54] so now he goes on let's keep reading
[1:29:57] but the people took verse 21 now verse
[1:29:59] 22 and samuel said hath the lord as
[1:30:02] great delight and burnt offerings and
[1:30:04] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:30:06] the lord
[1:30:07] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:30:09] and to hearken than the fat of rams
[1:30:12] for rebellion is as the sin of
[1:30:14] witchcraft and stubbornness as iniquity
[1:30:16] and idolatry
[1:30:18] because thou has rejected the word of
[1:30:19] the lord he hath also rejected thee from
[1:30:22] being king
[1:30:23] and saul said unto samuel i have sinned
[1:30:26] now he's willing to repent
[1:30:30] amazing before it wasn't his fault it
[1:30:32] was the people actually before that he
[1:30:35] says i did everything god told me to do
[1:30:38] so he wasn't he wasn't repentant he
[1:30:41] wasn't you know he didn't see himself as
[1:30:43] a sinner he i did everything god said to
[1:30:45] do he says then what is this what is
[1:30:48] this lowing of cattle and bleeding of
[1:30:50] sheep what is this that i hear and he
[1:30:52] begins to say well the people did this
[1:30:54] and the people wanted to save this for
[1:30:55] this worship
[1:30:58] and he says
[1:30:59] you have rejected the word you're
[1:31:00] rejected from being king and after that
[1:31:03] now he's willing to admit that he sinned
[1:31:07] why didn't he do it the first time
[1:31:10] why didn't he repent immediately he was
[1:31:12] only repenting and you can see in his
[1:31:15] repentance it's a false repentance all
[1:31:17] he wants is to remain in his position as
[1:31:20] king and to save face in front of the
[1:31:22] people it has nothing to do with a
[1:31:24] genuine love for god
[1:31:27] you say can repentance be false yes
[1:31:29] repentance can be absolutely false
[1:31:32] if it's done with the wrong motive
[1:31:34] repentance is false
[1:31:37] he says
[1:31:40] verse 24 and saul said in samuel i have
[1:31:42] sinned for i have transgressed the
[1:31:43] commandment of the lord and thy words
[1:31:45] because i feared the people and obeyed
[1:31:48] their voice it's still the people's
[1:31:50] fault
[1:31:51] ultimately
[1:31:52] verse 25 now therefore i pray thee
[1:31:55] pardon my sin and turn again with me and
[1:31:58] i may worship the lord and samuel said
[1:32:00] unto saul i will not return with thee
[1:32:02] for thou has rejected the word of the
[1:32:04] lord and the lord hath rejected thee
[1:32:06] from being king over israel and as
[1:32:08] samuel turned about to go away he laid
[1:32:10] hold upon the skirt of his mantle and
[1:32:12] rent and it rent and samuel said unto
[1:32:14] him the lord hath rent the kingdom of
[1:32:16] israel from thee this day and hath given
[1:32:18] it to a neighbor of thine that is better
[1:32:20] than thou
[1:32:21] and also the strength of israel will not
[1:32:24] lie nor repent for he is not a man that
[1:32:26] he should repent then he said i have
[1:32:29] sinned this is saul now i have sinned
[1:32:32] yet honor me now listen yet honor me now
[1:32:36] i pray thee before the elders of my
[1:32:38] people and before israel and turn again
[1:32:41] with me that i may worship the lord thy
[1:32:43] god so samuel turned again after saul
[1:32:46] and saul worshiped the lord
[1:32:48] this is completely disgenuine
[1:32:53] 100
[1:32:54] he said honor me now before the elders
[1:32:57] of my people
[1:32:58] saul is trying to save his reputation
[1:33:01] and he's trying to save his position
[1:33:02] amen he says come with me now so that i
[1:33:05] might worship the lord if he wanted to
[1:33:07] worship the lord he would have done what
[1:33:08] the lord said because that's the purest
[1:33:10] form of worship
[1:33:12] the purest form of worship is not money
[1:33:14] and offering play or attendance and a
[1:33:15] service amen are speaking a certain
[1:33:18] thing the purest form of worship is to
[1:33:20] do what he says do to obey his
[1:33:22] commandments
[1:33:25] jesus said if you love me
[1:33:27] keep my commandments
[1:33:29] worship means to bow down
[1:33:32] to surrender so i said the purest form
[1:33:34] of worship is to obey
[1:33:37] to surrender
[1:33:38] but saul you can see
[1:33:41] had a reputation to maintain
[1:33:43] he had an image to uphold and he had a
[1:33:46] position to guard
[1:33:48] and therefore his repentance
[1:33:50] was not genuine
[1:33:53] because of what he was trying to save
[1:33:57] the prophet says that's the prayer of
[1:33:59] sincerity
[1:34:00] certainly he could put them together
[1:34:02] it's not how we pray in our lips it's
[1:34:05] the motive of our heart is what god
[1:34:07] hears
[1:34:09] i love that it's not how we pray in our
[1:34:12] lips
[1:34:13] it's the motive of our heart is what god
[1:34:16] hears
[1:34:17] it can sound so good it can sound so
[1:34:21] repentant it can sound so religious but
[1:34:23] god is hearing what the motive of our
[1:34:25] heart is saying
[1:34:27] we have good words in our lips but a
[1:34:30] wrong desire in the heart god hears what
[1:34:32] the heart is saying
[1:34:36] you know i want to look at david now
[1:34:38] let's go to ii samuel i want to look
[1:34:40] just one instance in the life of david
[1:34:42] there'd be many we could look at but
[1:34:43] let's just go to second samuel chapter
[1:34:45] 12.
[1:34:47] we know this instant so well this is
[1:34:50] when he sinned with bathsheba and
[1:34:52] committing adultery and then had uriah
[1:34:55] killed her husband was killed
[1:34:57] and in chapter 12 verse 5
[1:35:01] nathan comes to him in chapter 12 and
[1:35:03] begins to tell him a story about a rich
[1:35:05] man and a poor man the rich man had a
[1:35:07] multiple sheep on the hill poor man only
[1:35:09] had one that he loved and raised as a
[1:35:11] child and when a visitor came to the
[1:35:13] rich man he didn't want to give up any
[1:35:15] of his sheep so he took from the poor
[1:35:17] man his one little sheep and he slew it
[1:35:19] and fed it to the visitor and nathan the
[1:35:21] prophet shares this story with david and
[1:35:24] after david hears the story this is his
[1:35:26] answer in verse 5.
[1:35:28] and david's anger was greatly kindled
[1:35:30] against the man and he said to nathan as
[1:35:32] the lord liveth the man that hath done
[1:35:35] this thing shall surely die
[1:35:37] and he shall restore the lamb fourfold
[1:35:39] because he did this thing and because he
[1:35:42] had no pity
[1:35:43] and nathan said to david thou
[1:35:46] art the man
[1:35:48] thus saith the lord god of israel i
[1:35:50] anointed thee king over israel and i and
[1:35:52] i delivered thee out of the hand of saul
[1:35:55] and i gave thee thy master's house and
[1:35:57] thy master's wives unto thy bosom and
[1:35:59] gave thee the house of israel and of
[1:36:01] judah and if that would have been too
[1:36:02] little i would moreover have given thee
[1:36:04] such and such things
[1:36:06] wherefore hast thou despised the
[1:36:08] commandment of the lord to do evil in
[1:36:10] this sight thou has killed uriah the
[1:36:13] hittite with the sword and has taken his
[1:36:15] wife to be thy wife and has slain him
[1:36:17] with the sword of the children of ammon
[1:36:19] now therefore the sword shall never
[1:36:21] depart from thine house because thou has
[1:36:24] despised me and has taken the wife of
[1:36:26] uriah the hittite to be thy wife
[1:36:29] thus saith the lord behold i will raise
[1:36:31] up evil against thee out of thine own
[1:36:33] house and i will take thy wise before
[1:36:36] thine eyes and give them unto thy
[1:36:38] neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives
[1:36:40] in the sight of the sun
[1:36:42] for thou
[1:36:43] didst it secretly but i will do this
[1:36:46] thing before all israel and before the
[1:36:48] son
[1:36:49] and david said unto nathan i
[1:36:52] have sinned against the lord.
[1:36:57] he didn't say anything about the people
[1:36:59] he didn't blame bathsheba
[1:37:01] he didn't talk about preserving his
[1:37:03] kingdom
[1:37:04] saving faces not to elders
[1:37:07] he simply said i have sinned against
[1:37:12] the lord
[1:37:15] he didn't say
[1:37:16] i'm wrong nathan forgive me
[1:37:18] but purge my sin nathan couldn't purge
[1:37:21] sin
[1:37:22] he didn't say but the people but do you
[1:37:24] know how much pressure i'm under
[1:37:27] do you know the situation
[1:37:29] god doesn't know what
[1:37:32] just let's just keep this quiet
[1:37:36] still show me honor in front of the
[1:37:37] people
[1:37:38] none of that david simply said i have
[1:37:41] sinned against the lord who was it david
[1:37:44] cared most about and all things it was
[1:37:47] the lord who did he ultimately sin
[1:37:49] against he sinned against bathsheba he
[1:37:51] sinned against uriah he sinned against
[1:37:52] his own people but when it came down to
[1:37:55] it the one that mattered most was david
[1:37:57] said i have sinned against the lord.
[1:38:03] and nathan said unto david thy lord has
[1:38:06] also put away thy sin
[1:38:08] thou
[1:38:09] shalt not die
[1:38:11] you know when nathan came to him he
[1:38:13] began to tell him all the trouble that
[1:38:15] was going to come in his household and
[1:38:16] the things that were going to happen to
[1:38:18] him and david never repented and asked
[1:38:21] for those things to go away all he did
[1:38:24] was repent and when he repented nathan
[1:38:27] said god has forgiven you you'll not die
[1:38:29] but he didn't say anything about all the
[1:38:31] other consequences for his sin that was
[1:38:33] coming into his family david was willing
[1:38:36] to accept the hand of god because god's
[1:38:39] hand is perfect
[1:38:41] he wasn't complaining he wasn't begging
[1:38:44] he wasn't whining he accepted what god
[1:38:47] said but he repented and god spared his
[1:38:50] life
[1:38:53] in first john 1 9 says if we confess our
[1:38:55] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[1:38:57] us our sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:39:00] unrighteousness but we must confess our
[1:39:02] sins and we must confess him with a pure
[1:39:05] heart not god i did that but you know
[1:39:07] what pressure i was under
[1:39:09] god i did that but you know this and you
[1:39:11] know this i did that but you know what
[1:39:13] they did to me
[1:39:15] how about just simply saying god i was
[1:39:18] wrong
[1:39:20] and i sinned against you would you
[1:39:22] please forgive me the repentance shows
[1:39:25] who we love most the way we repent shows
[1:39:28] who is our desire and who we want to
[1:39:30] please
[1:39:33] praise god
[1:39:35] i want you to look
[1:39:37] at david now
[1:39:39] i want to keep going in verse 14 excuse
[1:39:41] me verse 14.
[1:39:42] i want to read this because it has so it
[1:39:45] has had so much impact on me
[1:39:47] verse 14 how be it because by this deed
[1:39:50] thou has given great occasion to the
[1:39:52] enemies of the lord to blaspheme
[1:39:54] the child also that is born unto thee
[1:39:57] shall surely die
[1:39:58] and nathan reported unto his house
[1:40:01] departed unto his house and the lord
[1:40:03] struck the child that uriah's wife bear
[1:40:05] unto david and it was very sick
[1:40:07] david therefore besought god for the
[1:40:09] child and david fasted and went in and
[1:40:12] lay all night upon the earth and the
[1:40:14] elders of his house arose and went to
[1:40:17] him to raise him up from the earth but
[1:40:19] he would not
[1:40:20] he would not neither did he eat bread
[1:40:22] with them
[1:40:23] and it came to pass on the seventh day
[1:40:25] that the child died and the servants of
[1:40:28] david feared to tell him that the child
[1:40:29] was dead for they said behold while the
[1:40:32] child was yet alive we spake unto him
[1:40:34] and he would not hearken unto our voice
[1:40:36] how will he then vex himself if we tell
[1:40:39] him that the child is dead
[1:40:41] but when david saw that his servants
[1:40:43] whispered david perceived that the child
[1:40:45] was dead therefore david said unto his
[1:40:47] servants is the child dead and they said
[1:40:50] he is dead
[1:40:52] then david arose from the earth and
[1:40:54] washed and anointed himself and changed
[1:40:56] his apparel and came into the house of
[1:40:58] the lord and worshiped then he came to
[1:41:00] his own house and when he required they
[1:41:02] set bread before him and he did eat
[1:41:05] then said his servants unto him what
[1:41:07] thing is this that thou has done thou
[1:41:09] didst fast and weak for the child while
[1:41:10] he was alive but when the child was dead
[1:41:13] thou did rise and eat bread and he said
[1:41:16] while the child was yet alive i fasted
[1:41:18] and wept for i said who can tell whether
[1:41:21] god will be gracious to me that the
[1:41:23] child may live
[1:41:24] but now he is dead wherefore shall i
[1:41:26] fast can i bring him back again i shall
[1:41:29] go to him but he shall not return to me
[1:41:33] david
[1:41:35] he repented unto the lord but he had
[1:41:37] such a relationship with the lord that
[1:41:40] when the child was stritten sick
[1:41:42] david didn't blame god
[1:41:45] david didn't get angry towards god or
[1:41:48] didn't get bitter towards god what david
[1:41:50] did is began to fast and pray and rely
[1:41:54] on the goodness and graciousness of god
[1:41:56] and ask god if there was any chance he
[1:41:58] would spare the child and he laid
[1:42:00] himself out humbly and he laid upon the
[1:42:02] floor and he humbled himself and he
[1:42:04] fasted and he prayed he says while the
[1:42:07] child was alive who knew but that god
[1:42:09] might show grace
[1:42:11] but now that he's dead there's nothing
[1:42:13] more than i can do i can't he can't come
[1:42:15] to me but i shall go to him david is in
[1:42:18] no way bitter towards god blaming god
[1:42:21] upset at god david knows this is his
[1:42:23] fault god is righteous in everything he
[1:42:26] does and doesn't hold god accountable
[1:42:29] you'd be surprised we wouldn't be
[1:42:31] surprised because we're all human beings
[1:42:33] the surprise is the number of times amen
[1:42:36] that we fail god amen and disaster
[1:42:39] strikes in our life and then we become
[1:42:41] bitter towards god because distraction
[1:42:43] disaster hit our life
[1:42:46] all of a sudden things become difficult
[1:42:48] there's family tensions there's all
[1:42:49] kinds of disasters going on all around
[1:42:51] us and it's because we chose to go a
[1:42:53] different way than the word and going a
[1:42:55] different way in the word has brought
[1:42:57] these results and now we become bitter
[1:42:59] towards god to the results
[1:43:01] and start demanding that god change them
[1:43:04] instead of saying god is good god is
[1:43:07] gracious god is loving and everything he
[1:43:10] does is right
[1:43:12] and i'm going to implore his
[1:43:14] graciousness and ask him but i'm not
[1:43:16] going to be bitter towards him
[1:43:18] i'm not going to blame him
[1:43:20] it's not god's fault
[1:43:22] david was a man who loved god and
[1:43:25] respected god he was a man after god's
[1:43:28] own heart
[1:43:29] he was not a man after failure this is a
[1:43:31] tremendous failure this is adultery and
[1:43:34] murder
[1:43:37] this is a huge failure but even in this
[1:43:39] huge failure he still was a man after
[1:43:42] god's own heart and the way that he
[1:43:44] respected and reverenced god and honored
[1:43:46] god above everything else
[1:43:48] and david wasn't saving his reputation
[1:43:50] david wasn't saving his kingdom david
[1:43:52] wasn't trying to save his household
[1:43:54] david was loving god respecting god and
[1:43:57] asking god to be gracious
[1:43:59] and when god took the child there was no
[1:44:01] bitterness
[1:44:03] there was no anger
[1:44:04] there was no resentment
[1:44:06] there was just a resolve that god is god
[1:44:08] and god is good
[1:44:10] and we love god
[1:44:11] let's turn to psalms 51.
[1:44:23] this is the psalm that david wrote
[1:44:27] and it says here at the beginning of the
[1:44:28] psalm in my bible psalm 51 it said to
[1:44:31] the chief musician a psalm of david when
[1:44:34] nathan the prophet came unto him after
[1:44:36] he had gone into bathsheba so this is
[1:44:39] the psalm he wrote after this happened
[1:44:43] he said have mercy upon me o god
[1:44:45] according to thy lovingkindness
[1:44:47] according unto the multitude of the
[1:44:48] tender mercies blot out my
[1:44:51] transgressions
[1:44:52] wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity
[1:44:54] and cleanse me from my sin
[1:44:57] david knows
[1:44:59] he can't cleanse himself
[1:45:01] but he's coming back to the one he loves
[1:45:04] to the very one he offended
[1:45:07] he's coming back to the one he loves and
[1:45:08] he's asking that one to forgive him
[1:45:11] and to cleanse him
[1:45:14] for i acknowledge my transgressions my
[1:45:16] sin is ever before me
[1:45:19] against thee and the only have i sinned
[1:45:23] and done this evil in thy sight that
[1:45:26] thou mightest be justified when thou
[1:45:28] speakest and be clear when thou judgest
[1:45:32] behold i was shapen in iniquity and in
[1:45:34] my incendian my mother conceive me
[1:45:36] behold thou desirest truth in the inward
[1:45:39] parts and in the hidden part thou shalt
[1:45:41] make me to no wisdom
[1:45:43] purge me with hyssop and i shall be
[1:45:46] clean wash me and i shall be whiter than
[1:45:48] snow make me to hear joy and gladness
[1:45:51] that the bones which thou has broken may
[1:45:53] rejoice
[1:45:54] hide thy face from my sins and blot out
[1:45:57] all mine iniquities create in me a clean
[1:46:00] heart oh god and renew a right spirit
[1:46:02] within me
[1:46:03] cast me not away from thy presence and
[1:46:06] take not thy holy spirit from me
[1:46:08] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1:46:11] and hold me with thy free spirit
[1:46:15] when will i teach then will i teach
[1:46:17] transgressors thy ways and sinners shall
[1:46:19] be converted unto thee
[1:46:21] deliver me from blood guiltiness o god
[1:46:23] thou god of my salvation and my tongue
[1:46:26] shall sing aloud of thy righteousness
[1:46:28] o lord open thou my lips and my mouth
[1:46:31] shall show forth thy praise for thou
[1:46:33] desirous not sacrifice else would i give
[1:46:36] it thou the lightest knot and burn
[1:46:38] offering the sacrifices of god are a
[1:46:42] broken spirit a broken and contrite
[1:46:44] heart oh god thou thou will not despise
[1:46:50] i love that psalm
[1:46:53] i love david was a man after god's own
[1:46:55] heart i loved his attitude in the way he
[1:46:59] repented and the the desire of his heart
[1:47:01] was god amen the desire that he wanted
[1:47:03] restored was fellowship with god he
[1:47:05] wanted god to restore him and restore
[1:47:07] the joy of his salvation he knew he
[1:47:09] didn't lose his salvation but he lost
[1:47:11] the joy of his salvation by his own
[1:47:13] transgressions he wasn't blaming god but
[1:47:16] he was asking god to restore what he
[1:47:18] himself had lost he was asking god to
[1:47:21] cleanse what he himself had defiled he
[1:47:23] was coming back to the one he loved and
[1:47:25] the one that he had sinned against
[1:47:27] admitting his transgressions and asking
[1:47:29] that individual to wash him and clean
[1:47:32] him make him pure and he said if you
[1:47:35] desire to sacrifice i would give a
[1:47:36] sacrifice but there's nothing that i can
[1:47:38] give to pay for my sins there's nothing
[1:47:41] that would suffice you amen but the one
[1:47:43] thing you want is a broken and contrite
[1:47:46] heart and a broken spirit
[1:47:49] and that's what david had
[1:47:50] because david's motive of his heart
[1:47:54] was to serve god
[1:47:56] and it became evident
[1:47:58] in the way
[1:48:00] that he wrote this psalm
[1:48:03] remember cain
[1:48:05] cain
[1:48:07] served himself
[1:48:09] cain wanted to serve god but he served
[1:48:11] god his way abel served god the way god
[1:48:14] wanted to be served
[1:48:17] and we know how all of this transpired
[1:48:19] and eventually god rebukes cain and cain
[1:48:22] doesn't take the rebuke of god amen cain
[1:48:25] gets upset he speaks to his brother he
[1:48:27] raises
[1:48:28] and he slays abel
[1:48:32] when god comes to cain
[1:48:34] he comes to cain and says where is thy
[1:48:36] brother and he says am i my brother's
[1:48:38] keeper and he says what hast thou done
[1:48:40] the blood of thy brother crieth out to
[1:48:42] me from the ground and and cain is
[1:48:44] defiant in the face of god and god
[1:48:47] brings a judgment upon cain amen and
[1:48:50] cast him out of his presence and cain
[1:48:52] doesn't humble himself he doesn't repent
[1:48:55] he said i sinned against you lord i'm
[1:48:57] sorry there's no repentance all there is
[1:48:59] is a desire for self-preservation
[1:49:02] because he says if you send me out
[1:49:03] whoever shall find me will slay me
[1:49:08] and god said i'll put a seal upon you
[1:49:10] that whoever slays cain it happened to
[1:49:13] him sevenfold
[1:49:15] cain was content leaving the presence of
[1:49:18] the lord as long as he could keep his
[1:49:20] life
[1:49:22] he he didn't want favor with god he
[1:49:25] didn't want to please or serve god he
[1:49:27] wanted to keep his life and he wanted to
[1:49:29] continue to live upon the earth amen and
[1:49:32] it's completely backwards amen because
[1:49:34] what is life without god amen who wants
[1:49:36] to live without the presence of the lord
[1:49:38] but cain was totally content going out
[1:49:41] from the presence of god as long as god
[1:49:43] would put a mark of protection on he
[1:49:44] could keep his life
[1:49:46] i say my life is less value to me than
[1:49:49] than my relationship with the lord
[1:49:51] god make that so in me make it so that
[1:49:54] my life my pleasures my health my
[1:49:57] everything is not as valuable to me as
[1:49:59] my relationship with you
[1:50:02] so that when i displease you from a pure
[1:50:04] heart that i am brokenhearted and
[1:50:07] contrite in spirit because i sinned
[1:50:09] against you
[1:50:11] not because somebody found out not
[1:50:13] because it's causing problems not
[1:50:16] because people are judging me that's all
[1:50:18] completely the wrong reason for
[1:50:19] repentance but when it comes back to god
[1:50:22] i have sinned it's you and thee alone
[1:50:24] that i have sinned against i have sinned
[1:50:26] against you lord and i am sorry for
[1:50:29] transgressing against you
[1:50:32] that is a true heart of repentance
[1:50:36] amen
[1:50:37] and then david can say in psalms 119 71
[1:50:42] he can say it is good for me that i have
[1:50:45] been afflicted
[1:50:46] that i might learn thy statutes
[1:50:49] never bitter never angry never blaming
[1:50:52] god
[1:50:53] but with a pure heart towards god
[1:50:58] the prophet of god says now while you're
[1:51:00] trying to impersonate that
[1:51:02] if you are you're still a crow he's
[1:51:04] talking about this being a dove and a
[1:51:05] crow the nature of a crow the nature of
[1:51:07] a dove
[1:51:08] the dove is pure and clean can only eat
[1:51:10] clean food and can only go clean places
[1:51:12] the crow can eat wherever
[1:51:15] he says you've got to get your nature
[1:51:17] changed to make your desires change
[1:51:20] then when you truly love god and believe
[1:51:22] him with all your heart that's it when
[1:51:24] you do anything wrong you feel the tears
[1:51:27] of repentance rolling down your cheeks
[1:51:29] you can't stand it you have to go back
[1:51:32] you lay on your face before the father
[1:51:34] said god you know i didn't mean to do
[1:51:36] that and you stay right there until it
[1:51:38] settled with god forever that's right
[1:51:41] he said when you've got that nature
[1:51:43] changed then when you've done something
[1:51:45] against god you feel the tears of
[1:51:47] repentance running down your cheeks and
[1:51:49] you stay in the presence of god until
[1:51:51] you know that things settled you don't
[1:51:54] wait till somebody finds out and brings
[1:51:56] it to your attention and exposes it and
[1:51:57] then you repent
[1:52:00] but when your nature's changed the
[1:52:01] minute you know you've defied god's word
[1:52:03] the minute you know you've displeased
[1:52:05] god you feel that displeasure that
[1:52:08] separation and it throws you into
[1:52:10] repentance this is serving god with a
[1:52:12] pure heart
[1:52:14] with a pure motive
[1:52:16] it says but an old crow it don't bother
[1:52:19] him
[1:52:20] he can just eat anything he wants to he
[1:52:21] can digest it but the dove cannot digest
[1:52:24] these things
[1:52:25] then notice and go back to the lamb now
[1:52:27] he's so meek and he's so gentle in the
[1:52:29] day that when that lamb comes into the
[1:52:31] earth
[1:52:32] he's born meek and gentle
[1:52:35] he's a lamb to begin with and when a
[1:52:37] christian is born into the kingdom he
[1:52:39] takes the nature
[1:52:41] of the lamb
[1:52:43] he goes on in the message here you him
[1:52:44] he says i don't know i just feel like i
[1:52:47] was just all scoured out
[1:52:49] that's something that the word does it
[1:52:51] just scours through us and finds those
[1:52:53] little old weak spots we confess them
[1:52:55] the church moves on the church must move
[1:52:58] on live gallant be faithful at your post
[1:53:00] of duty love the lord with all your
[1:53:02] heart and god will give you the desire
[1:53:04] of your heart
[1:53:07] let's turn to matthew 22.
[1:53:10] we'll wrap up with this
[1:53:13] thought matthew 22.
[1:53:32] matthew 22 34.
[1:53:37] matthew 22
[1:53:39] but when the pharisees had heard that he
[1:53:41] had put the sadducees to silence
[1:53:44] they were gathered together
[1:53:46] when one of them which was a lawyer
[1:53:47] asked him a question tempting him saying
[1:53:49] master which is the great commandment in
[1:53:51] the law
[1:53:53] jesus said unto him
[1:53:54] thou shalt love the lord thy god with
[1:53:56] all thy heart
[1:53:58] with all thy soul with all thy mind
[1:54:00] this is the first and great commandment
[1:54:04] and the second is like unto it thou
[1:54:06] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:54:08] on these two commandments hang all the
[1:54:11] law
[1:54:12] and the prophets
[1:54:14] so there's anything we want to get right
[1:54:16] i want to get this right
[1:54:18] and i need god's help
[1:54:21] in the message hidden life the prophet
[1:54:23] is talking about the baptism of the holy
[1:54:25] ghost he's talking about the inner veil
[1:54:27] in the hidden life he says sure they eat
[1:54:29] manna out there but they didn't know
[1:54:31] about this
[1:54:33] they'd never been in there have you my
[1:54:35] dear brother don't despise my ignorance
[1:54:37] but i want to ask you something have you
[1:54:39] ever come to the place in life where
[1:54:41] christ meant more to you than all the
[1:54:43] arguing you could do about your church
[1:54:46] has christ meant more to you than all
[1:54:48] the world i don't mean from an emotional
[1:54:50] or a mental workup i mean from the
[1:54:51] depths of your heart that something's
[1:54:53] settled in there that something's taken
[1:54:55] place that you don't know how it come
[1:54:58] but you're hid away and your whole
[1:55:00] motive is to serve jesus christ have you
[1:55:02] entered that place my dear brother have
[1:55:04] you come into that place where you don't
[1:55:06] care what anyone says not to go out and
[1:55:08] act smart but till the love of god is so
[1:55:11] anchored into you that you can't see
[1:55:13] nothing else
[1:55:14] your whole motive is to do the will of
[1:55:16] god love for everybody flowing free from
[1:55:19] everywhere what a place to live that's
[1:55:22] the hidden place
[1:55:24] that's the place where we can get to
[1:55:26] come to my brethren that's the place
[1:55:28] where god reveals his secret things
[1:55:31] that's the place where god does the
[1:55:33] placing and the calling
[1:55:35] what does it mean to come behind the
[1:55:37] inner veil what does it mean to come
[1:55:38] into the holy of holies amen to come
[1:55:40] into that place where he said your whole
[1:55:42] motive is to do the will of god and love
[1:55:45] everybody
[1:55:46] to where there's a change that takes
[1:55:48] place when it's no longer defending
[1:55:51] myself providing for myself trying to
[1:55:53] look good
[1:55:55] all of that needs to fade to the to the
[1:55:57] to the outside but we need to come down
[1:55:59] to this genuine love for god that says i
[1:56:02] love god period i love god first i love
[1:56:06] god most i love god with all of my heart
[1:56:08] with all my soul with all my strength
[1:56:11] with all my mind
[1:56:12] that's the greatest
[1:56:14] of commandments
[1:56:16] and that's the life he's called his
[1:56:18] bride
[1:56:19] to live
[1:56:20] in christ is the mystery god revealed he
[1:56:22] says now there is only one thing can
[1:56:24] happen
[1:56:25] there has to be a message at the end
[1:56:27] time when there's nothing else can
[1:56:29] follow it and now the ecumenical world
[1:56:31] has set up such a regime that there can
[1:56:33] be no denomination and no not nothing
[1:56:35] else follow it you're either in it or
[1:56:37] you're not in it the fruit is in the top
[1:56:39] of the tree and the light is shining on
[1:56:41] that predestinated fruit and she's
[1:56:43] ripening into christ-like fruit bringing
[1:56:46] forth the same mellowness and sweetness
[1:56:49] the same spirit that he had
[1:56:51] in him
[1:56:53] what is his word doing
[1:56:55] what is this bright light that's shining
[1:56:57] at the end of the time it's shining on
[1:56:59] the top of the tree the bride tree the
[1:57:01] restoration of the bride tree to bring
[1:57:03] forth the same fruit that was in him the
[1:57:05] same melaness the same sweetness the
[1:57:08] same surrender the same obedience the
[1:57:10] same life that jesus christ had
[1:57:14] that's what this word is to do
[1:57:17] jeremiah 31 i'm just going to quote it
[1:57:19] to you i'll read it through jeremiah 31
[1:57:21] verse 33 says
[1:57:23] but this shall be my covenant that i
[1:57:25] will make with the house of israel after
[1:57:27] those days saith the lord
[1:57:29] i will put my law
[1:57:31] in their inward parts
[1:57:33] and write it
[1:57:34] in their hearts
[1:57:36] and i will be their god
[1:57:38] and they shall be my people
[1:57:41] we've come to that time
[1:57:44] where not that you take your law and not
[1:57:47] that you take your word and write it in
[1:57:49] my mind
[1:57:50] this this message didn't come just to
[1:57:53] enlighten the mind although that's part
[1:57:55] of what takes place but this message
[1:57:57] came so that he could write his word in
[1:58:00] your inward parts amen this message has
[1:58:02] come to be written in my inward parts
[1:58:05] amen to be written on my heart amen it's
[1:58:08] come to bring an absolute complete
[1:58:10] change to me not that i can it's not for
[1:58:12] the outside show there'll be an outside
[1:58:15] so that's where the fruits are
[1:58:16] manifested but he came to correct what
[1:58:19] was wrong inside of me he came to fix
[1:58:21] what hybridization had done to me he
[1:58:23] came to put in me amen he came to give
[1:58:26] me his word to write it in my inward
[1:58:28] parts to write it on my heart to live
[1:58:30] his life in me to come and dwell in me
[1:58:33] to bear the fruit out of me
[1:58:36] he came with sanctifying power he came
[1:58:38] with the power of the blood he came with
[1:58:40] the washing of the water of the word
[1:58:42] that'll clean my heart clean my hands
[1:58:44] clean my mind
[1:58:46] but i've got to stay under the fountain
[1:58:48] till it purges me
[1:58:50] and i can die to myself and ask god god
[1:58:54] purge me by your word cleanse me by this
[1:58:56] word
[1:58:57] put your word into my heart write it in
[1:59:00] my inward parts put it in the depths of
[1:59:03] my soul amen so that i would not sin
[1:59:05] against you that you'll clean my heart o
[1:59:07] god purge me clean me wash me by this
[1:59:11] great word that you've sent pour your
[1:59:13] spirit out upon me and change my heart
[1:59:16] oh god so that all i want is you
[1:59:20] that's why this message came
[1:59:23] this is what this message can do
[1:59:26] that's the purpose that it's here for
[1:59:28] amen not for intellectualism not for
[1:59:31] greater doctrine not to create another
[1:59:34] religious society not to create another
[1:59:36] religious culture not to create another
[1:59:39] system of operation that'll clean up the
[1:59:41] outside but we walk around with just as
[1:59:43] polluted and dirty in our hearts as any
[1:59:45] other denomination that's not why the
[1:59:47] message came the message came so that he
[1:59:50] could purify sanctify cleanse thoroughly
[1:59:52] and dwell in completely
[1:59:55] [Music]
[1:59:56] say god write this message in my inward
[2:00:00] parts
[2:00:02] if the message gets written in my inward
[2:00:04] parts and the message gets written in my
[2:00:06] heart everything else will come out
[2:00:08] right
[2:00:10] but
[2:00:10] lord cleanse me
[2:00:14] he says in christ is revealed in his own
[2:00:15] word the thing that's mattered with the
[2:00:18] message today
[2:00:19] is those who has obtained it in their
[2:00:21] hearts
[2:00:22] must lay in the presence of the
[2:00:25] what's the problem
[2:00:27] too much immaturity
[2:00:29] too much greenness
[2:00:30] but those who received in their hearts
[2:00:32] must lay in the presence of this
[2:00:35] revelation of this word of this restored
[2:00:37] word
[2:00:38] lay in the presence of the sun to get
[2:00:40] ripened
[2:00:42] you can pick up the message and then let
[2:00:44] that sun bake all the greenness out of
[2:00:46] you see
[2:00:47] making matured christians
[2:00:49] see what i mean god is coming soon to
[2:00:51] receive his church and we must have that
[2:00:53] type of christians for him to receive
[2:00:58] amen
[2:00:59] write your word in my heart
[2:01:01] then when we receive the message into
[2:01:03] the heart we must lay under this
[2:01:05] revelation under the presence of the son
[2:01:07] of god
[2:01:08] and let it bake all the greenness out
[2:01:10] and bring us to full harvest maturity
[2:01:13] because it must display the very life of
[2:01:16] jesus christ
[2:01:17] it must be right from the inside out
[2:01:21] amen and if we have a message that makes
[2:01:23] the outside right and the inside wrong
[2:01:25] it's not the right message
[2:01:28] but it must be the one from god that is
[2:01:30] written in the inward part written in
[2:01:32] the heart and it has the power to bring
[2:01:35] a change
[2:01:36] and what we need to do is when when
[2:01:38] we're laying in the presence of the sun
[2:01:41] to bring ripeness to bake out greenness
[2:01:43] which is immaturity amen when we lay in
[2:01:46] the presence of the sun when we come
[2:01:47] across these things we need to say god
[2:01:50] i'm sorry for this take it out of my
[2:01:52] life lord i'm sorry for this attitude
[2:01:54] for this approach i've been bitter
[2:01:56] towards you i've been blaming you i've
[2:01:58] been i've been hiding my sin i've been
[2:02:01] whatever
[2:02:03] but as we come to these things we need
[2:02:05] to deal with them amen not stuff them
[2:02:07] and move on amen not act like they're
[2:02:10] not there but if we want really to come
[2:02:12] to maturity we've got to come and expose
[2:02:14] our sin not hide our sin we've got to
[2:02:17] expose our weaknesses we've got to
[2:02:19] expose those little places in us where
[2:02:21] we're still trying to save ourselves
[2:02:23] when we're still trying to figure things
[2:02:24] out where we're still trying to look
[2:02:26] good in the eyes of people we've got to
[2:02:28] die out to all of that and say god wash
[2:02:30] me from those things and make me pure in
[2:02:33] my heart
[2:02:35] i want to be right
[2:02:37] all the way through i want to be right
[2:02:40] do i want to do right things absolutely
[2:02:42] do i want to bear right fruit absolutely
[2:02:45] but more than anything if he could purge
[2:02:47] my heart
[2:02:49] and purify me by his word and by his
[2:02:51] life
[2:02:52] i know that everything is going to come
[2:02:55] out right
[2:02:56] i desire so much like david said purge
[2:03:00] me
[2:03:00] and i will be clean
[2:03:03] cleanse my heart oh god and make me
[2:03:05] clean because without god we're never
[2:03:08] going to make it
[2:03:09] but oh what a powerful scrubbing agent
[2:03:12] of the pure word he has given us in this
[2:03:14] day
[2:03:15] a pure word where the mind of god has
[2:03:18] been open and revealed so that all these
[2:03:20] little things can't stay hidden they
[2:03:22] have to be exposed the light of the word
[2:03:25] has to shine on them and bring out of us
[2:03:28] and pull out of us all of those things
[2:03:30] that are hindering us
[2:03:32] to be like him
[2:03:33] until we get to the place
[2:03:36] where it's our love for him
[2:03:37] alone
[2:03:39] that if we stand like saul and nobody
[2:03:42] shows up to save us
[2:03:44] i'm not going to go against the word
[2:03:46] i'll stand here and die
[2:03:49] till we can get to the place where it's
[2:03:51] his word and our confidence in his word
[2:03:53] and we obey it out of love that i'm not
[2:03:55] going to change it i'm not going to
[2:03:57] manipulate it i'm not going to ignore it
[2:04:00] but i'm going to stand here and whatever
[2:04:02] happens i trust god with the outcome but
[2:04:04] i'm not going to disobey his word
[2:04:06] because i'm tired of disappointing my
[2:04:08] lord i'm tired of failing my god
[2:04:13] that's a pure motive
[2:04:16] failing other people will do it a
[2:04:18] million times but god keep me from
[2:04:20] failing you
[2:04:22] keep me from sinning against you
[2:04:25] i may hurt people's feelings i i they
[2:04:27] may misunderstand my actions i i those
[2:04:31] things are going to happen and where
[2:04:32] we're sorry for all of those but oh god
[2:04:34] above all help me not to sin against you
[2:04:39] let me have such a love affair with god
[2:04:42] such a sensitivity that i i'll know when
[2:04:46] i displease him
[2:04:47] and i'll feel those tears of repentance
[2:04:49] coming and saying oh god wash me once
[2:04:52] again
[2:04:53] forgive me restore unto me the joy of my
[2:04:55] salvation and my lips will sing your
[2:04:58] praises
[2:04:59] that's the way we want to live

[2:05:14] not with a system of beliefs
[2:05:17] not with a doctrinal order
[2:05:19] but he's come here to unite with people
[2:05:22] he's come here to unite with his bride
[2:05:26] and he wants that
[2:05:28] loving relationship
