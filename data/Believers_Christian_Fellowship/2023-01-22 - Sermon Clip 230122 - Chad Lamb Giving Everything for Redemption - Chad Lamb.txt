TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so now Boaz does what he has to do and he's in his claiming Ministry and now he comes he comes to Ruth and Ruth has been gleaning Ruth has now got received a promise uh uh at the new day Ruth has received the six measures of barley and her veil and and now she's rejoicing in that but if Ruth stays with the six measures of barley and never goes to the seventh redemption's not finished it's good barley it's good word it's a heapingful it's something to Rejoice about it's something to be glad in but if we stay with the with with the six seals amen and miss the seventh seal amen then all of a sudden we're still going to wind up in darkness and coldness of winter because this will run out but there's something that's greater and that's the seventh seal which the seventh seal is not a doctor in the Seven Seals of person and the seventh seal is the lord of the Harvest he's the one who gave the six and brother Graham said I'm not the one who opened those seals he opened those seals who the lord of the Harvest the lord of the Harvest and the new day gave the six measures of barley amen but where was the seventh measure it wasn't going to come like the other six have you read that your church have you read the sales book amen the the first seal there's a whole lot of wheat psychics you know they're a whole lot of wheat you go through them all Amen in tying these scriptures together types and shadows showing all of this and you get to the seventh seal and at the end of the seventh seal you're like where's the barley where's the heaping scoop where is it amen you got to look past the scoop to the hand that's holding the scoop because that's when the seventh seal starts to appear and it's the person it's the lord of the Harvest it's the person of the word it's the one who opened the word he's the seventh seal and now in the day of redemption she's got the six measures of barley that's just to show that he's not going to stop until he's done but when he's done he's going to come and take that little bride and they're going to go into a secret room and a third pool in a private chamber and they're going to have an invisible Union that nobody else is going to see and in that visible Union she's going to get the seventh measure of seed and that's not going to be another Doctrine that's not going to be that seventh measure of seed is going to be the person of the word the lord of the Harvest in her and until we come to that point we haven't come to Redemption that's why to wait on the seventh seal is dangerous to deny the seventh seal is dangerous there's nothing wrong with rejoicing over the sick I mean let's Rejoice over the six but once you get the seventh you never have to worry about running out of the six amen because the lord of the Harvest owns the field owns the weed owns the Garners owns it all and he's constantly giving more barley more barley more but you're never going to run out because you are part of the lord of the Harvest you have come as a joint Heir and now there's no fear of the dark winter cycle there's no fear of the apostasy of the seventh age because the lord of the Harvest is your husband he is you and you are him and he is now in you he's injected his seed into you and now you're carrying the seventh seal
