[10:22] [Music]
[10:25] Hello.
[10:29] Hello. How I love to worship

[11:03] you.
[11:06] Hello. Hello
[11:10] him. How I love to
[11:14] worship you.
[11:18] Praise the Lord. We do long to worship
[11:20] him. Let's just bow our heads while
[11:22] we're standing. Heavenly Father, we do
[11:25] come, Lord, this evening, Father God,
[11:27] just desiring to worship you, Lord, to
[11:29] hear from you, Father, to be surrendered
[11:31] vessels out of the way, Lord. Me up here
[11:35] in front, Lord. I I've got to be out of
[11:36] the way, Father, that you can speak,
[11:38] Lord. Each one that's here today, those
[11:41] that are streaming, Lord, uh help them
[11:43] to get out of the way, Lord. Help us to
[11:45] set aside the day, the events, and uh
[11:48] all the distractions. Lord, and I know
[11:50] how easy it is to get distracted, Lord.
[11:53] So, we just pray, Father God, that you
[11:54] would do something for us this evening,
[11:56] Lord. We haven't come in vain, Lord. You
[11:58] haven't called this assembly together in
[12:00] vain, Lord. There's a desire you've got
[12:02] on your heart, Lord. And we want to be
[12:05] surrendered to hear it, Lord. It's the
[12:06] most valuable thing that we could hear,
[12:09] not what words that Ron Garvin's put
[12:13] together, but a bridegroom. Our
[12:16] bridegrooms want to speak to us this
[12:18] evening.
[12:19] And I pray that we can be surrendered to
[12:21] hear from you. We love you. We thank you
[12:24] for assembling with us, Lord, keeping
[12:27] your word. And we just look to you to
[12:30] know more about you in Jesus name.
[12:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[12:37] Thank you m musicians. Let's uh turn to
[12:39] a scripture in Galatians uh 5 22- 26.
[12:45] Very common scripture. And we're going
[12:46] to hold our place there
[12:49] um because I want to compare that to
[12:50] another scripture. Galatians
[12:52] 5:22 through 26. The fruits of the
[12:55] spirit. I'm sorry I don't have this one
[12:57] on the
[12:58] PowerPoint. I uh assembled the
[13:02] PowerPoint kind of in a hurry
[13:04] and put it on a or I assembled my notes
[13:07] in a hurry. Put it on a PowerPoint the
[13:09] day at work on break time. Emma it to
[13:12] brother Franco and got here to review
[13:14] it.
[13:14] I didn't put a text down. So, so here's
[13:18] our text for the day for this evening.
[13:21] But the fruit of the spirit, Galatians
[13:23] 5:22, but the fruit of the spirit is
[13:26] love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[13:29] gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
[13:33] temperance. Against such there is no
[13:35] law. And they that are Christs have
[13:38] crucified the flesh with the affections
[13:40] and lusts. If we live in the spirit, let
[13:42] us also walk in the spirit. Let us not
[13:44] be desirous to vain glory, provoking one
[13:46] another, envying one another. Amen. You
[13:49] may be seated. So, hold your place
[13:51] there. And then also turn to 1
[13:53] Corinthians chapter
[13:56] 13 as
[13:57] we begin the services this evening. Um,
[14:03] I did want to bring greetings from
[14:04] Brother Chad. I texted him earlier on my
[14:07] 9:00 break. I said, "It's probably about
[14:09] 3:00 there for you. Um, been praying for
[14:13] you and wishing you well." And he wrote
[14:14] back and said that they're enjoying the
[14:16] fellowship. They're doing well. And he
[14:18] had a ser midweek service this
[14:20] afternoon. I think he I think it was
[14:22] about 1:00 when he was supposed to be
[14:23] preaching that. So, it' be about 1:00
[14:26] 1:30 in the morning their time now, I
[14:28] think. So, uh, let's keep holding them
[14:31] up in prayer. Looking forward to them
[14:32] getting back uh, being reassembled with
[14:34] them. So, keep them in prayer. Keep the
[14:36] families in prayers as they're gone.
[14:38] So I was uh out in Pennsylvania over
[14:42] Easter holiday there. Had some
[14:44] fellowship with family and also with
[14:46] brother Jim Shoemake and the church
[14:47] there. So uh enjoyed that. Brother Jim
[14:50] sent his greetings to the to the church
[14:53] here and brother Chad. I don't know if
[14:55] any of you know brother Jim Shoemake,
[14:57] but uh that was my first time to really
[14:58] get to meet him much. So I enjoyed the
[15:00] fellowship out there as well. Yeah. So,
[15:03] uh, brother Chad asked me to to take the
[15:07] service. I don't know when he asked me
[15:09] that, but, uh, I said, "Sure, we'll, uh,
[15:13] we're never prepared, but, uh, we just
[15:15] want to be surrendered." And the Lord
[15:17] gave me a gave me a a thought. It's a,
[15:19] real simple thought, which works well
[15:21] for me. So, but I thought, you know,
[15:23] still I'm inadequate to express that
[15:28] uh, God's so great. you take the
[15:31] simplest little part and try to present
[15:33] it, you you can never never get to the
[15:37] depth of it. You know, um I'm way off my
[15:40] notes already. That's okay. Might be a
[15:42] long service, but I've got a longer
[15:44] drive than most of you. So, you pray for
[15:46] me as I go home. I don't want to hear
[15:48] any complaints. So, but uh you know I
[15:53] hear people uh great ministers uh preach
[15:58] great things, deep things and uh and
[16:00] they can go deep and spin your head
[16:02] around and uh and
[16:05] um you know just in the natural we see
[16:08] people that can do great things. Uh I'm
[16:10] a welder. We got some other brothers
[16:12] here that are welders and uh you know I
[16:15] can make the metal stick together and
[16:17] hold most of the time, you know. So, I
[16:19] don't want to call myself a welder
[16:20] because I might get put up against a
[16:21] real welder and then I might get shown
[16:23] up. But, uh, it it works well for where
[16:25] I'm at and I just do my part there. And
[16:27] that's kind of what we're going to talk
[16:28] about today a little bit. Uh, do your
[16:31] part, do your portion. It's not my job
[16:33] to, uh, to put together some high-rise
[16:37] building or the Golden Gate Bridge.
[16:39] That's that's not my job. If if God
[16:40] wanted me there, he'd give me the
[16:42] qualification to do that. So, we're just
[16:44] sticking a few pieces of metal together
[16:45] there at the county highway. And if they
[16:48] fall apart, then they, you know, they
[16:50] fall off on the road. We'll pick it up,
[16:51] you know. So that's no big deal. You
[16:53] don't have to worry about the bridge
[16:54] collapsing on you or something. So, so
[16:57] God's put me right where he wants me.
[16:59] And if I didn't ask to be up here, if he
[17:02] wants me up here, then he's he's got to
[17:04] give me the qualifications or something
[17:06] to do the job with. So So praise the
[17:09] Lord. Um, so don't complain about what
[17:11] he's given me
[17:13] either. So shift it back on him.
[17:16] So, praise the Lord. Do you love the
[17:18] Lord? Amen.
[17:22] Oh, praise the Lord. Let's turn to 1
[17:23] Corinthians 13.
[17:26] Now, when I was out in Pennsylvania,
[17:30] uh had a little bit of a difficult uh
[17:33] discussion I had to uh go go over there.
[17:37] So, that's the purpose I was being out
[17:38] there. And
[17:40] um I uh did a video call with the
[17:43] family. Uh I don't know if that was
[17:45] Friday or Saturday night, whichever one
[17:47] that was. And the next uh so I was going
[17:50] to do the you know our devotions with
[17:51] the kids before they went to bed. So I
[17:53] called them called up the next uh
[17:55] chapter on our scripture reading was 1
[17:57] Corinthians 13. So we read it and I kept
[18:01] going down through there and it just
[18:02] applied to what I the discussions I'd
[18:05] been involved in that day. And um so I
[18:09] kept reading it and I'd say charity
[18:12] suffers long. Oh my. Charity this,
[18:14] charity. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. We got
[18:16] done. Isaac said, "Why do you keep
[18:17] saying oh my" after everything? Well, it
[18:20] kind kind of hits home here. So, let's
[18:22] let's turn to First Corinthians. If you
[18:24] can do if you can look at Galatians 5 at
[18:28] the same time as 13, then do that. But
[18:31] let's read 1 Corinthians 13. We're going
[18:33] to read verse 4-8 to start with. And
[18:36] then I want to compare these side by
[18:38] side. Charity suffereth long and is
[18:40] kind. Oh my. Charity envth not. Charity
[18:44] vaunteth not itself. Is not puffed up.
[18:47] Doth not behave itself unseemly. Seketh
[18:49] not her own. Is not easily provoked.
[18:52] Thinkketh no evil. Rejoiceth not in
[18:55] iniquity, but rejoicth in the truth.
[18:57] Beareth all things. Believeth all
[19:00] things. Hopeeth all things. Endureth all
[19:03] things. Charity never faileth. Amen.
[19:06] Praise the
[19:07] Lord. Before we compare these
[19:09] scriptures, I've got a quote in here. I
[19:10] think I'll get to it today. I
[19:12] don't well we we'll just see but brother
[19:15] Brandham and Aaron you're familiar with
[19:16] the quotes several places brother
[19:18] Brandham said it that the most powerful
[19:19] force that he's ever found is love
[19:22] charity never faileth
[19:24] now that's what the Bible
[19:26] says that's what our prophet said do you
[19:30] believe it all right then apply it
[19:35] amen
[19:36] I was in a pretty goodiz trial this
[19:39] weekend pretty tough
[19:43] But I take that
[19:45] scripture and I stand on it. Amen.
[19:51] Brother Jim Shoemaker was a real
[19:54] blessing. And um he was talking about
[19:59] kingdom
[20:00] authority and how we can stand for our
[20:02] loved ones, stand for our families,
[20:05] stand for our children. Some of you have
[20:07] got children that have walked away.
[20:10] Apply that scripture
[20:12] with
[20:13] faith. Believe it. You're not going to
[20:16] get anywhere backing down from
[20:18] it. You can stand toe-to-toe with the
[20:20] devil.
[20:23] He's got your
[20:25] back. Don't you doubt it.
[20:28] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[20:31] 1 Corinthians 13, let's let's compare
[20:34] these scriptures there. 1 Corinthians 13
[20:37] verse4. Charity suffereth long. Well,
[20:40] over in Galatians
[20:42] 5:22
[20:44] says, make sure I'm in the right one
[20:46] here. Galatians 5:22, but the fruit of
[20:49] the spirit is
[20:51] longsuffering. Charity suffereth
[20:52] longsuffering and is kind. Well, what's
[20:55] this say over here in Galatians 5:22?
[20:58] Gentleness,
[21:00] goodness, envieth
[21:02] not. Verse 23, meekness vaunteth not
[21:06] itself, is not puffed up. Verse five in
[21:10] 1 Corinthians 13, doth not behave itself
[21:13] unseemly. Well, verse five of or in uh
[21:17] verse 23, Galatians 5, there's meekness,
[21:21] temperance. So does not behave itself
[21:23] unseemly. There's temperance there. So
[21:26] we're just we're talking about the same
[21:27] thing. fruits of the spirit, love behave
[21:30] itself not unseenly, seeketh not our
[21:32] own.
[21:34] Um verse 26 of Galatians
[21:38] 5:22, let us not be desirous of vain
[21:41] glory. Amen. So she's not seeking her
[21:47] own is not easily
[21:50] provoked. Thinkketh no
[21:53] evil. Let's see. Galatians 5:26 again,
[21:57] let us not desire as bang glory,
[21:59] provoking one another, envying another
[22:01] word. So not easily provoked and not
[22:04] provoking the other. Amen. Not envying
[22:07] one another. So think no evil. We're not
[22:09] envying one another. Amen.
[22:13] Rejoice not in iniquity, but rejoices in
[22:15] the truth. In G in Corinthians, 1
[22:18] Corinthians
[22:20] 13 verse uh 25 of Galatians 5. If we
[22:25] live in the spirit, let us also walk in
[22:26] the spirit. So rejoice not in iniquity,
[22:28] but joy rejoices in the truth. So if we
[22:30] live in the spirit, let us walk in the
[22:32] spirit. Uh beareth all things, believeth
[22:34] all things, hopeeth all things, endureth
[22:36] all things, charity never faileth. Amen.
[22:39] Now we can take that to the bank as they
[22:42] say. And I believe that. Now we can get
[22:45] to my quotes here, get to my my
[22:49] PowerPoint.
[22:52] uh you know five weeks ago I gave the
[22:54] trip report here and I spoke on
[22:57] position and relationship talked about
[23:00] Esther and Fashy and all these different
[23:03] ones excuse me and uh I had forgotten
[23:08] what I had written I actually had to
[23:10] look it up in the back uh I'd forgotten
[23:12] what I'd spoken maybe I wasn't listening
[23:14] but uh uh I had to look it up in the
[23:17] back office there to what what seems
[23:19] like this is a familiar here something I
[23:21] spoke about and look well that's what I
[23:23] spoke about position and relationship
[23:25] and today we're going to talk about your
[23:27] position so we're going to try to anyway
[23:30] if I can get get rolling
[23:35] here now we can make this simple I think
[23:38] these welder guys how many welders guys
[23:39] we got here a minute we got Brian
[23:41] where's James is he around here
[23:42] somewhere I got to pick on these guys so
[23:45] different ones brother uh brother Ilia
[23:48] so you got to make it simple for these
[23:50] guys. I I know I know these guys.
[23:53] So, your position, know it, be
[23:56] dissatisfied with it, and stay in it.
[23:59] Amen. Now, if you can catch the
[24:01] revelation, we can dismiss early and go
[24:02] home. But I know who I'm working with
[24:04] here. So, we're going to have to go a
[24:05] little bit a little bit further.
[24:08] So, it's pretty simple. Uh nothing
[24:11] complicated here. And if we could catch
[24:13] the full revelation, like I say, we'd
[24:15] we'd be home early, but uh we're not
[24:19] going to have early dismissal, but
[24:20] hopefully we get out on time that I can
[24:22] get home at a decent hour. I got to go
[24:23] to work in the morning. So, let's let's
[24:25] enjoy the the journey of discovery as we
[24:28] as we look at these things. you know,
[24:30] knowing your position is um it's a
[24:32] little bit more difficult than uh you
[24:34] know, the preacher gets up here and I
[24:36] sit back there and I hear him say it and
[24:38] walk out and forget what he said, you
[24:39] know, and I think we're probably all
[24:41] guilty of that. And uh we just they make
[24:44] it they make it plain plain as day. We
[24:46] sat here and rejoice and we walk out and
[24:48] forget about it and we uh don't retain
[24:51] it somehow. At least that's for me. I
[24:52] speak for myself.
[24:54] But the voice of the culture, the age we
[24:56] live in, uh it dulls the voice of God.
[25:00] So we hear you are this, you are that.
[25:02] We're the bride of Jesus Christ. We're
[25:05] overcomers and and we jump up and shout
[25:07] and say hallelujah. And and we walk out
[25:09] and and the voices we hear out there,
[25:11] it's like you're nothing. You're uh
[25:13] well, look in the mirror. That's who you
[25:14] are. Identify who you are because of
[25:17] your actions and your feelings and your
[25:19] and we just and we forget who we are. So
[25:23] uh you know that first one there knowing
[25:25] your position maybe that's a little bit
[25:26] more difficult than what
[25:28] uh what it should
[25:32] be because this Satan is constantly
[25:35] showing us the wrong position. That's
[25:38] why we forget what we are. If if he was
[25:41] there encouraging us. Take this to
[25:43] heart. fathers, mothers, school
[25:46] teachers, uh bosses, whoever you are. If
[25:50] you're throwing out a positive, uh now
[25:52] this is not not psychology, but if
[25:54] you're throwing out a positive
[25:55] reinforcement there to whoever you're u
[25:58] in charge of, maybe they can start to
[26:01] grasp it because that's the way God
[26:02] works with us. He keeps reinforcing it,
[26:05] telling us over and over. But Satan's on
[26:06] the other side, and now we've got to
[26:08] decide who we're going to hear, who
[26:09] we're going to listen to. Back and
[26:10] forth, back and forth. So, he's o
[26:13] constantly showing, well, you failed.
[26:14] You failed. You failed. You failed. And
[26:16] um but uh we're going to keep on trying.
[26:19] We're going to keep on surrendering.
[26:22] We're going to keep on growing. That's
[26:23] right. So, we Let's look at the carnal
[26:27] side of this equation for a little bit.
[26:30] Thinking about the Welder brothers. You
[26:32] know, Brother Brian works for Spingers
[26:34] and I think James still does, too. You
[26:36] haven't fired him yet. All right. Good
[26:38] deal. Well, we got to know our position
[26:40] there. So just on the natural level and
[26:42] as we talk about let me let me talk to
[26:44] the welders. I they need some real
[26:45] talking too. The rest of you just kind
[26:47] of sit back but it apply to your lives
[26:49] as well. So they got to know their
[26:51] position. Now Brian's been there longer.
[26:53] He's probably a crew crew chief there.
[26:55] He's in charge of some things and and uh
[26:57] James is just a young guy coming in
[26:59] trying to learn the ropes. Uh we need to
[27:01] know our position. Brian needs to know
[27:03] his position. He can't be letting that
[27:05] little punk come up and tell him that,
[27:06] hey, Brian, this is the way we're going
[27:07] to do it. And he wouldn't because James
[27:09] is shorter than him. He wouldn't
[27:11] wouldn't put up with that anyway. But
[27:14] Brian's got to know his position, be
[27:16] confident in it. So, no, this is the way
[27:18] we're doing it. This is this is the
[27:20] correct way. And I know you've got
[27:22] another idea. We've tried that before.
[27:24] It doesn't work. This is the way we're
[27:25] going to do it. And u don't give me a
[27:28] lip, you know. Get my whiffle bat out.
[27:30] Right. Amen. And James needs to know his
[27:33] position, too. I'm the new guy here. I'm
[27:35] learning. I I I got to pay attention.
[27:38] All right. We've all got that to do. You
[27:41] know,
[27:44] uh the new
[27:46] employee, he he needs to be he needs to
[27:50] know his position. He needs to be
[27:52] satisfied with it, and he needs to stay
[27:54] in it, right? you know, if it's a new
[27:57] guy and he's never welded before, he's
[27:59] he's not going up on the he's not going
[28:00] up on the on the lift to weld something
[28:02] overhead. Not going to happen. Brian's
[28:04] not going to let that happen. And uh so
[28:08] he's he's got to be satisfied picking up
[28:09] the the trash off the floor because
[28:12] otherwise everybody's tripping over it.
[28:14] Parts come in, they got boxes, they got
[28:16] trash, they got skids, they got stuff
[28:17] they need to be cleaned up. Somebody's
[28:18] got to do it. Yeah. If the new guy
[28:21] doesn't do it, he decides, "Ah, I'm
[28:23] going to take a break. Go out behind the
[28:25] building here. Nobody know notice that
[28:27] I'm missing." Brian's going to notice it
[28:29] because now he's tripping over
[28:30] everything. So now Brian is the one
[28:33] cleaning up the mess. That's Marty's
[28:35] position. But that's he it's got to be
[28:36] done.
[28:38] If it's not done, the job suffers. So
[28:41] the new guy, he's got to be satisfied
[28:43] with that. If you don't want to pick up
[28:44] trash, then then go flip burgers. go
[28:47] find something else to do somewhere
[28:48] where you're satisfied, where you know
[28:50] your position and you can stay there. Uh
[28:53] if the guy picks up picks up trash and
[28:55] he's he's satisfied with it, that's
[28:57] good. If he's not satisfied with it,
[28:59] that's bad. Uh I would much rather have
[29:02] a guy on the job that is is satisfied in
[29:06] his
[29:07] position and is a willing worker even
[29:10] though he's not got the capabilities of
[29:12] the other guy. Cuz you get a sour apple
[29:14] in there, it ruins the whole thing. It's
[29:16] like, I don't have use for that. I don't
[29:17] have time for that. That just it just
[29:19] poisons the whole atmosphere. Get them
[29:21] out of here. We'll pick up our own
[29:23] boxes. We don't need you. Be satisfied
[29:26] in it or go find something else to
[29:29] do. Be satisfied in your position. Know
[29:32] it. Be satisfied. Stick with it. you
[29:34] know, uh I don't know about you guys,
[29:36] but I work for the county highway and
[29:38] there's guys there that um don't realize
[29:41] the really the value of their position.
[29:44] So, they just take off at every little
[29:45] whim. So, the boss, he cannot schedule
[29:49] the day's jobs cuz he don't know whether
[29:52] they're going to be there or not. It's
[29:54] like, is he going to be there? I don't
[29:56] know. We're going to have to wait and
[29:56] see. We clock in at 6:30 and well, maybe
[29:59] he's there, maybe he's not. If he's not
[30:01] there, okay, we got to find somebody to
[30:02] fill his shoes, drive his truck. Well,
[30:05] that means we got to pull this guy off
[30:06] this. We got to shut that job down now
[30:09] because we don't have the guys to fill
[30:10] it. This guy just thought, "Ah, they
[30:12] don't need a truck driver. I'm going to
[30:14] lay up for the day." Well, that one
[30:16] truck that got shut down also shut down
[30:18] this job over here. That's right. He
[30:21] needs to be there. He needs to know the
[30:23] value of his job. You say, "Well, it's
[30:25] just driving a truck. What value is
[30:26] there to that?" Well, because you was
[30:27] there to drive the truck, we was able to
[30:30] do the paving job that you was going to
[30:31] be on. We also was able to repair this
[30:34] bridge over here that was an emergency.
[30:35] It had to be done. We didn't have to
[30:37] shut things down in order to manipulate
[30:39] and cover for you. Now, this is on the
[30:42] natural. What about on the spiritual?
[30:44] Amen.
[30:46] We need the guy in row row five, seat
[30:48] six. Amen. Is the Is the pastor worried
[30:52] about are they going to show up? Are
[30:54] they going to be there? Are they going
[30:55] to pull? Uh, right. You know, your your
[30:58] calling is not just to warm the seat up.
[31:00] We don't We'll get a heater. You know,
[31:02] don't be the sour sour apple on on row
[31:05] six. I better count see who I'm talking
[31:07] about
[31:08] here. So,
[31:17] know your position. Well, I'm just I'm
[31:19] just I'm just a You're just a what?
[31:21] You're just a part of the body. Amen.
[31:24] Yeah. And like brother
[31:27] uh Riley said, you're half of the gift.
[31:31] Amen. If nobody's pulling out there,
[31:33] it's really going to be tough on the guy
[31:35] up here.
[31:36] So, praise the Lord. Somebody must be
[31:38] pulling tonight. So, appreciate it. Keep
[31:40] doing your job. Stay with it. We got
[31:43] that up there. Yeah. Stay with it. Stay
[31:45] in it. Be satisfied where you're at.
[31:47] Don't try to come up here. The deacons
[31:48] will come after you. No, that's is not
[31:50] your position. Uh, I don't need to be up
[31:52] here if Brother Chad, you know, think
[31:54] brother Chad's going to be out of town.
[31:55] Ah, there's my opportunity, you know.
[31:58] Hey, he's not going to be here next
[31:59] week, Sunday. If I can just cut brother
[32:03] Burley off, I can get up here. No. Row
[32:07] five, seat six. Get there. That's where
[32:09] I need to be. Amen. Amen. This is good
[32:12] for all of us.
[32:14] Amen.
[32:16] Be satisfied picking up trash if that's
[32:18] what your calling is. Yeah. If you're on
[32:21] the job as Spallingers and you're
[32:23] supposed to pick up the trash, pick up
[32:24] the trash. When you show yourself
[32:27] responsible at that, Amen. We'll go
[32:29] further. That's right. I like somebody
[32:32] that's, you know, uh,
[32:35] well, pick on the county highway. They
[32:38] deserve it. So, looking for an easy easy
[32:42] way out, you know, and the boss comes
[32:44] and says, "Uh, hey, could you pick up
[32:46] those sticks?" Like, all right, pick up
[32:49] the sticks, find a place to hide. That's
[32:53] all I was told to do all day. No, you
[32:56] was told to do that. Now, if you go
[32:58] back, what else would you like? Well,
[33:01] can you mow the grass? That's not very
[33:03] important. I'd really like to drive a
[33:04] truck, but mow the grass and be done by
[33:08] lunchtime and just kind of hide. And
[33:10] this this literally these kind of things
[33:12] happen on the job. So if it happens
[33:15] there, it probably happens in the church
[33:17] as well because it's just types and
[33:19] shadows. So just do the one thing and
[33:22] then that's all the boss said. So go
[33:24] hide, you know. Um but give me somebody
[33:28] that when I say pick up the trash and
[33:30] they do and say, hey, what else you got?
[33:32] Hey, could you go get these tools? Could
[33:33] you to put these tools back? When I find
[33:35] somebody that's willing, Amen. They're
[33:37] engaged in the program. They're engaged
[33:40] in the project. They've got a heart for
[33:41] the the overall picture. Yeah. I can use
[33:44] somebody like that. Even if they'll
[33:45] never be able to weld. Yeah. Because not
[33:48] we've I've only got two welders in my
[33:50] shop. Three. But right in my location,
[33:53] I've got two. So, we can't all be
[33:56] welding at one time. Usually, it's just
[33:57] small projects. It just needs one
[33:59] welder. But if I could get somebody that
[34:01] could run the saw and cut pieces for me
[34:03] and go get bolts. Amen. And wow. how
[34:08] that would just propel the job forward.
[34:11] Amen. And then now me, the sole welder
[34:14] there. I mean, there's other guys that
[34:15] do, but I'm the welder on the at the
[34:18] county if it's a big job. So, I'm the
[34:21] only guy that tackles these big jobs.
[34:23] So, now I'm not have to run for bolts. I
[34:26] don't have to I can get if somebody can
[34:28] do that, I can I can make some progress.
[34:31] All right.
[34:33] If you'll pull from your seat, Yeah. the
[34:36] pastor can make some progress. But if
[34:38] he's just got to labor and labor and and
[34:41] oh, he's got to pull this up and he's
[34:42] got to and he just labor and labor and
[34:45] just slow the whole program down,
[34:48] recognize that you're part of this
[34:50] project. I was thinking, you know, if
[34:52] it'd be a great honor for me to uh to be
[34:55] hired by NASA. Could you come and weld
[34:58] for NASA down here at Cape Canaveral or
[35:00] wherever? Uh woo, that'd be that'd be
[35:03] great. I'm not qualified to weld on the
[35:05] on the space station. You don't want
[35:07] that. No. But maybe I could weld
[35:10] brackets for their shelves to hold their
[35:11] parts,
[35:13] you know, and that'd be a great honor.
[35:15] And you're part of the program, right?
[35:17] You know, I'm not chief engineer. I'm
[35:20] not the one welding all the aluminum and
[35:21] titanium, and that's beyond me, right?
[35:25] But they probably got somebody there
[35:27] that sweeps floors, you know. There's
[35:29] probably somebody there that fuels that
[35:32] rocket up, that uh space shuttle. Well,
[35:35] I guess they don't even use a space
[35:36] shuttle. Somebody has to fuel that up.
[35:38] Maybe some little boy had a dream. It's
[35:40] like, wow. Because back in the old days,
[35:42] let me talk about the old days. How many
[35:44] of you remember this? You go to a a full
[35:46] service station, the guy comes out and
[35:48] says, "How much you want? Give me five
[35:49] bucks." Which, you know, was a half a
[35:50] tank back then. And uh they wipe your
[35:52] windshield. Anybody remember that? Oh,
[35:55] look at all you old people out there.
[35:57] So, praise the Lord.
[36:00] And I remember one of the one of the
[36:01] guys at work, uh, his son, you know,
[36:04] that was his ambition life. I want to
[36:06] pump gas. A come on, have higher
[36:08] ambitions than that. Well, maybe there's
[36:10] a little boy that, you know, he wanted
[36:12] to pump gas and and now he's pumping
[36:13] gas. He's filling the the shuttle.
[36:16] He didn't design anything. He's he's not
[36:19] he didn't write any of the computer
[36:21] programs. He's he's not engineered
[36:23] anything, but they need him.
[36:26] Somebody's going to be really upset if
[36:28] that thing's not fueled.
[36:30] And there's probably somebody that wipes
[36:32] the screen the windshield on that thing,
[36:33] too. That probably I could do that. You
[36:36] know, got to go wipe the windshield
[36:38] after I get done with these shelves.
[36:40] We'll stick to the shelves until they're
[36:41] done. Then then maybe we can get you to
[36:45] wipe the wipe the windshield.
[36:48] Do your job.
[36:50] Does it do my welder guys understand
[36:53] this? You got it, Brian. All right. All
[36:55] right. We can move on then. Praise the
[36:57] Lord. Keep on pulling.
[36:59] Praise the Lord. Be satisfied in your
[37:02] position.
[37:08] Because if you abandon your position,
[37:11] you're not if you're not satisfied with
[37:13] it, it's just poison to the whole thing.
[37:14] If you're not satisfied in this church,
[37:16] like, please find some place you're
[37:18] satisfied. You know,
[37:20] Brother Chad might get upset with me if
[37:22] I'm running people away from the church.
[37:25] No, be satisfied in the body. You know,
[37:29] the whole body is not here. Amen. You
[37:31] know, I was out there with brother Jim
[37:32] Shoemake. Praise the Lord. They've got a
[37:34] body out there. Different different
[37:37] bodies. Where's Brother Hector? He's
[37:38] here somewhere. I can't see you,
[37:40] brother. With my my glasses on. I can't
[37:41] see you with them off. So, praise the
[37:43] Lord. Oh, well, you guys will get old,
[37:46] too, someday.
[37:48] Amen.
[37:50] Heard one amen out there. God bless you
[37:52] for an honest heart. Keep on pulling,
[37:54] brother.
[37:55] Uh, and when you wear me out, I'll say,
[37:58] "Quit pulling. We got to go
[38:03] home." So, we could keep going on and on
[38:05] drawing these natural uh types, but just
[38:10] apply it spiritually.
[38:12] If you're not satisfied where you're at,
[38:15] it'll poison the whole church. the whole
[38:17] body. You got to see that you're part of
[38:20] a bigger picture than than uh row five.
[38:24] You're a bigger picture than BCF.
[38:27] This is a body worldwide body. Amen.
[38:30] Amen. So if you poison this part, well
[38:34] that poison can spread. So be satisfied.
[38:37] Stick with your position. So well it's
[38:39] it's nothing. Well, people people get
[38:41] dissatisfied with that. They don't see
[38:43] that they're what they're involved in.
[38:45] They think I'm just doing a little part.
[38:47] Well, that little part's important just
[38:49] like a little child, you know. Um Isaac
[38:53] is uh he be turning seven here uh in the
[38:56] end of May. And uh that boy has got in
[39:00] his genetics to be a chainsaw
[39:03] operator, but not at this
[39:05] point. Or so his mother says. So she
[39:10] won't let him go to the woods with me
[39:11] from now on. But he has got the
[39:13] potential.
[39:15] His daddy was a chainsaw operator. His
[39:17] grandpa was a chainsaw operator. His
[39:19] uncles a chainsaw operators. He's got
[39:21] it.
[39:22] Yep. But not now. He's going to have to
[39:26] bite his time. Needs to be satisfied.
[39:28] you know, a year ago when I'd take him
[39:30] out to trim the edges of the field,
[39:31] which is what we're doing right now, uh,
[39:33] as we got to get ready for the crops,
[39:34] which we just cash in our land and and,
[39:37] uh, so, but we got to get the where the
[39:39] trees have overgrown into the field and
[39:41] where trees have fallen out in the field
[39:42] through the winter time, we got to get
[39:44] all that cleaned up for the farmer to
[39:45] come in and plant the crops. So, we go
[39:47] around and last year, you know, he'd
[39:48] just be playing around and and uh, on
[39:51] the farm, we have a saying, one boy, all
[39:53] boy, two boys, half a boy. Three boys,
[39:57] no
[39:58] boys. And if you don't know the
[40:01] interpretation of that, here it is. You
[40:04] get one boy on the on the hay wagon and
[40:06] that's all you got. He can barely pick
[40:09] up the hay bale, drag it to the back and
[40:12] stack it and and and you just have to
[40:13] slow down for him. And but that's part
[40:16] of the process. You get two boys on
[40:18] there, it slows the process down further
[40:21] because while one's trying to lug the
[40:23] bail, the other one's tripping him,
[40:24] pushing him off the wagon, throwing hay
[40:26] down his back. Okay, you understand? So,
[40:30] we got a lot of boys in here. These
[40:31] guys, they got experience on this. And
[40:34] if you get three boys on the wagon, h
[40:36] you done lost it because they're chasing
[40:38] each other around the wagon. They're
[40:39] throwing rocks at each other. I know.
[40:42] I've got uh I've got three brothers.
[40:45] when you got I don't know what the
[40:46] saying is on four boys, but it's not
[40:48] good.
[40:53] So, praise the
[41:08] Lord. So, anyway,
[41:11] be satisfied in your position.
[41:17] But I was talking about Isaac. That's
[41:18] what I That's where I was at.
[41:21] He's got the potential. Last year he was
[41:23] just all boy. He's just a little bit
[41:25] bigger boy. This year he's he's out
[41:26] helping me with the pruners. I be
[41:28] careful when I say this. He's pruning
[41:30] everything, which means I've got to go
[41:32] pick it all up and get rid of it. But if
[41:35] you left that piece attached, I could
[41:37] have drug it all off with one swoop.
[41:40] So, so now we got to go back and trim it
[41:43] up. But I I don't fault him. He's
[41:46] learning. So, praise the Lord. I'm
[41:48] happy. I'm happy for that. So, next year
[41:51] he'll be pulling bigger sticks. And uh
[41:55] next year he'll be running uh well, if
[41:58] his mother lets him, he'll be running
[41:59] the chainsaw. No, it'll take a while.
[42:02] We'll we'll let him run the pruners this
[42:04] year. Uh next year, maybe maybe hatch
[42:06] it. not in the house. Uh maybe an axe
[42:10] the next year eventually in time, but
[42:13] let him be satisfied. He enjoyed enjoyed
[42:15] the time out there with me and I enjoyed
[42:16] the time with him. We had fun. He was
[42:18] satisfied. If he's just all sour, that
[42:22] makes the job go rough. But uh praise
[42:26] the Lord. I think you get the picture
[42:28] here. Yes.
[42:30] So Amen. Praise the Lord.
[42:34] What do you think God wants in his
[42:36] family?
[42:38] He wants you satisfied. Row six, verse
[42:40] seat five, whatever, whatever your
[42:42] position is, be satisfied right there.
[42:46] When God wants more from you, you show
[42:48] yourself pulling hard from there.
[42:51] God can do something for you. Amen.
[42:55] You know, I was uh 25 at our little
[42:59] church there in Hagerstown, just, you
[43:00] know, just a small country church there.
[43:03] That's the row I I filled my position
[43:06] all those years row whatever seat
[43:09] whatever and was faithful to that and uh
[43:13] when I got to be 25 we come a need for a
[43:16] uh somebody to run the sound to make the
[43:18] cassette tapes back in the old days
[43:21] record the service on cassette and and
[43:23] make up tapes and mail out to those that
[43:26] were homebound and uh they also needed a
[43:28] trustee. So I since I was faithful in
[43:30] that filling that seat now if id have
[43:33] just been out running not being faithful
[43:36] to it because I didn't think I was part
[43:37] of the picture uh you don't want that as
[43:40] a trustee that's not a very trusty
[43:43] trustee. So so I became trustee and and
[43:47] made the tapes and um as things went
[43:50] along later became the treasurer and and
[43:52] just things opened up. God was there. I
[43:55] didn't ask for these positions just come
[43:56] along when I come up here. I didn't ask
[43:58] to be on the missions board or to go
[44:00] overseas. I said, "It's not just give me
[44:03] my assigned seat. Let me sit down and
[44:05] pull." And uh and and we go from there.
[44:08] Uh I don't need to be up here. I don't I
[44:12] I just need to be in position and
[44:14] wherever he places, you know, if if
[44:16] we're seeking a position where we we got
[44:18] to go back and read our text again.
[44:20] Amen. You know,
[44:23] not vaunting ourselves, not trying to
[44:24] put ourselves forward. Let God get the
[44:26] glory. And if we'll just surrender, he
[44:28] can get the glory. Amen. We're going to
[44:30] have a late service. You guys are
[44:31] pulling, but keep it up. Praise the
[44:33] Lord. Not somebody that's looking to do
[44:35] minimum
[44:36] job. You know, that's that's not the
[44:38] kind of employees I like to, you know,
[44:41] we get new guys in and then when they
[44:43] come through, the boss kind of gives
[44:44] them a tour and they come through the
[44:45] welding area and introduce myself. So,
[44:47] yeah, anytime you want to come down,
[44:49] learn, do some welding, happy to have
[44:51] you down here. And a lot of times we'll
[44:54] work them in to just to see what the
[44:55] potential is. And um when I see they
[44:59] they're really not interested, I'll do
[45:01] it myself, you know. Yeah, it's it's
[45:03] harder work. But sometimes it's well
[45:05] it's more late. Well, maybe it's not
[45:07] harder work, you know. I've don't have a
[45:10] helper there to lift the heavy steel
[45:12] down and put it on the saw and all that
[45:14] stuff. It's a little bit harder work for
[45:15] me that way, but having them there
[45:17] sometimes is harder work because I got
[45:19] to
[45:20] keep they can help me get the steel
[45:22] down, but I've got got to keep doing
[45:24] this and directing them instead of them
[45:26] just picking up and going. And man, it's
[45:27] such a pleasure. And I'm sure all of you
[45:30] guys would know this that uh work on a
[45:32] job when somebody comes in that's got a
[45:33] heart and and especially if they got
[45:36] some previous ability. And I remember
[45:37] one man in particular that this kind of
[45:40] work he had done and he he just pitched
[45:42] in. And it's like, wow. It's like, now
[45:45] I'm going to go hide. So, let this guy
[45:48] do it. He that it's such a pleasure.
[45:50] Makes the day go so much better, you
[45:52] know? So, what about our walk with the
[45:54] Lord, too? Just we've been here. We've
[45:57] done this. Okay, let's let's pitch in
[45:58] and do it. Whatever it needs to be done.
[46:00] Praise the Lord. Amen. Uh, you know, we
[46:03] can uh I was thinking about this. Some
[46:05] of you sisters,
[46:07] uh, I won't start calling names because
[46:08] I I'll miss somebody, but you sisters
[46:11] cook the meals, have special fellowships
[46:14] over, send cards, send cards to me. I
[46:17] appreciate that different ones. And and
[46:20] you don't want to leave that to Ron
[46:22] Garvin. That's not my
[46:23] qualification. Do you want me preparing
[46:25] the meal for the visiting minister? No.
[46:28] Get on the job, stay there, be satisfied
[46:30] with it. because nobody else is going to
[46:32] be satisfied if Brother Ron's trying to
[46:33] fill that position. But if you don't, I
[46:36] guess brother Ron will have to.
[46:38] Somebody's got to do it. And Brother
[46:40] Brandham told the story about the little
[46:41] boys. You know, one's supposed to pack
[46:43] the water and one's supposed to pack the
[46:44] firewood. And well, if Johnny doesn't
[46:45] pack the water, well, then it's your
[46:47] responsibility to pack the firewood and
[46:49] the and the water both. The god job's
[46:51] got to be done. So, somebody needs to
[46:53] mail out the letters. I'm terrible. I I
[46:56] don't know when the last time was I sent
[46:57] a birthday card or a Christmas card or
[47:00] any card. Becky gets them on occasion.
[47:04] So So we we fail in that area. I need to
[47:07] pick up the pace there, brother Brian.
[47:09] But uh if that's your position, do it
[47:12] with joy. That's a blessing. It's an
[47:16] encouragement to the to the minister,
[47:17] the man of God, the whoever. Amen.
[47:20] Somebody in the hospital. I I'm terrible
[47:23] about that. I apologize.
[47:26] But you sisters fill that position. Do
[47:30] it. That's your part. Amen. Don't look
[47:33] down on it. That's your part. Praise the
[47:35] Lord.
[47:39] Oh, let me get back on track
[47:42] here. You know, there's little things.
[47:44] Let me make sure I didn't miss something
[47:47] here.
[47:57] We're talking about our
[47:59] position and uh so we're going to go a
[48:03] little bit different route here and I
[48:04] hope I can pull this together as
[48:06] beautifully as as the Lord kind of laid
[48:08] it on my
[48:11] heart from that
[48:14] time. I'm thinking this was in Illinois
[48:16] 1961.
[48:18] I believe this was at a Methodist
[48:21] college. I've got several quotes in here
[48:23] from this. Brother Ram says, "Notice
[48:26] another thing I' I'd just like to say
[48:28] amongst the Pentecostal people. There's
[48:29] one thing that we were forgetting,
[48:30] friends, is our Pentecostal courtesy."
[48:33] I'd never run across this before. I
[48:35] accidentally listened to this. Uh I was
[48:37] I think I had another sermon pulled up
[48:39] to listen on the way to work and then on
[48:42] my phone and I'm still trying to figure
[48:43] out how to use that thing. And I looked
[48:45] up a quote and it was in this sermon.
[48:48] And then when I hit play to listen to
[48:51] what I thought was the previous sermon,
[48:52] I got this one and it blessed me. So
[48:54] here it is. I think this is from the
[48:56] Lord. One thing that we're forgetting,
[48:58] friends, is our Pentecostal courtesy.
[49:01] See, parking in lots. Sometimes I've
[49:03] noticed our Pentecostal brethren when
[49:05] you could really pull in and give
[49:07] somebody else a chance to park by the
[49:09] side of you, just drive in it anyway.
[49:11] cause somebody really makes what we call
[49:13] a boo boo on the road. You fly loose and
[49:15] tear down. Listen, that's not the way to
[49:17] be a Pentecostal Christian. See, let's
[49:19] consider the next man. If he's wrong,
[49:21] let him be wrong. If you pattern after
[49:23] him, then you're wrong. See, let's think
[49:25] of the other fella and just try to do
[49:27] right and think
[49:28] right. I'd never heard this before. Our
[49:32] prophet's telling us how to
[49:34] park. Pentecostal courtesy. Well, our
[49:37] and I thought about this. I think it was
[49:39] yesterday. I'd heard this and just
[49:41] thinking about the service and come to
[49:43] an intersection and and I went before
[49:45] the other guy and he was supposed to go
[49:46] first, but I thought I had time because
[49:48] there was a slow vehicle coming through
[49:49] and I thought we could get through there
[49:50] and
[49:52] um thought that that wasn't quite
[49:55] courteous. I didn't get through the
[49:57] intersection, so he kind of had to delay
[49:59] because of me. That's missing my
[50:02] Pentecostal courtesy there. So So we're
[50:04] we're all learning this as we go. But is
[50:06] this too simple?
[50:08] I think it's I think that's pretty neat.
[50:11] If if you see the depth of it, you say,
[50:14] uh, you know, Brother Ron, that's just
[50:16] too simple. You're not a deep
[50:19] preacher. You tell me what part of the
[50:21] word is not deep. Amen. I'll read it.
[50:23] You, uh, you make the decision. I think
[50:25] it's all deep. Let's, let's see if we
[50:27] can catch the heart of God in
[50:29] this. So, you know, he's saying
[50:33] there, make place for them. Be be
[50:36] courteous. Think about it. This is this
[50:39] is part of our heritage. Isaac's got the
[50:41] heritage that he can run a chainsaw.
[50:43] It'll happen in God's own time. Uh
[50:46] that's going to it's just it's in his
[50:48] DNA. It's going to come to pass. Well,
[50:50] this is also in our DNA. Just just to be
[50:52] polite and courteous, right? Let's look
[50:55] at the graciousness of Brother Brandham
[50:59] um from this same sermon. He says, uh he
[51:02] said, "I think they're going to have a
[51:04] dance in here after a while." Oh, this
[51:06] is the prophet of the age. You know what
[51:09] he thinks about dancing? They're This a
[51:11] co This is a Methodist college. They're
[51:14] going to have a dance in there after the
[51:17] service. This is not looking good for
[51:23] somebody. So, in his closing prayer, he
[51:26] says, "Now, we'd ask that you would
[51:27] bless these lovely women that help us in
[51:29] this this institution of this Methodist
[51:31] college because they'd serve breakfast
[51:33] there. and hear of their courtesy of
[51:36] letting us have this room. God, I pray
[51:37] that the young men coming from here will
[51:39] be real missionaries and men of God.
[51:41] Grant it, Lord. May something be done or
[51:43] said that'll turn their hearts so to God
[51:44] that they'll be real second John
[51:46] Wesley's come out of here. God grant it.
[51:48] Bless the deans and all. Bless us
[51:50] together. Bless the services tonight and
[51:52] oncoming services. Bless our ministering
[51:54] brethren here and that's gathered
[51:55] together and we'll praise thee through
[51:57] this our time and eternity. We ask in
[52:00] Jesus name. Amen.
[52:02] We missed the rebuke. Oh, are we are we
[52:06] disappointed? He should have laid into
[52:08] them so hard. My goodness. Are we
[52:11] disappointed? Are we looking for the
[52:13] rebuke? Are we looking for the heart of
[52:15] God? Do we only look to the
[52:17] chastisement? You know, because that's
[52:19] the easy part. Anybody can get wound up
[52:22] and get angry.
[52:25] Yeah. I better have some hear some
[52:27] amens. I'm going to start talking to
[52:28] some of the kids.
[52:30] Tell me what do you what what happens
[52:32] when uh when mommy says do something and
[52:34] you fail to do it. I better not do
[52:37] that. And daddy daddy's too. And the
[52:41] bosses. Amen. Uh anybody can get mad and
[52:46] riled up and and and start Oh yeah,
[52:48] that's right. storming and huffing. Uh
[52:52] but can we have this courtesy?
[52:56] So the hypocrite, he can he can get all
[52:58] righteous indignation. I'm just going to
[53:00] tear him apart. Oh boy. Help us, Lord.
[53:03] Where's the spirit of Christ?
[53:06] Even in these little things. Yeah. Now
[53:08] it and continuing in this same sermon,
[53:11] this is the very first quote. This is
[53:12] this is the start of the message right
[53:14] here. Thank you, brother Herman. I've
[53:16] just been sitting here drinking in and
[53:17] you know, I appreciate it very much. And
[53:18] before we go any further, I'm just it
[53:20] just we overlooked it. I think this was
[53:22] a wonderful little breakfast that these
[53:24] people served us here this morning. I've
[53:25] eaten breakfast around the world, you
[53:26] know, in different nations. That was
[53:28] real nice little breakfast. And I
[53:30] believe it would be as we were Christian
[53:32] gentlemen and ladies to leave a little a
[53:34] little something lay on the table for
[53:35] those nice little ladies. How nice they
[53:37] served us. You know, if you'd have a
[53:39] little, you know, it's American custom,
[53:41] I think, that we leave them a little
[53:42] something on the
[53:44] table. And in his very closing remark,
[53:49] this is the end. He had his closing
[53:51] prayer, the final. He says, "Now don't
[53:54] forget the sisters tips on the table, if
[53:56] you will, and God be with you until we
[53:58] meet again." All right. God bless you.
[54:01] Thoughtful.
[54:05] It's simple. Amen. But let's continue on
[54:09] here.
[54:11] God's such a gentleman. Uh yeah, I'd
[54:14] like to be that, too. I'd like to have
[54:16] that in my life. You may say, "Well,
[54:19] brother Ron, this is too simple. There's
[54:20] no revelation. You haven't mentioned the
[54:22] seals. You haven't mentioned the coming
[54:23] of the Lord. Uh I think when the Lord
[54:25] comes, I think he's going to be this
[54:27] way. Have you recognized him?
[54:31] Did you miss it? Uh maybe this doesn't
[54:35] uh stir you up, inspire you. Maybe
[54:38] you're the one that needs to watch how
[54:39] you park
[54:41] and your tipping habits.
[54:49] Luke 11:42. But woe unto you Pharisees,
[54:52] for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner
[54:54] of herbs, and Passover judgment, the
[54:56] love of God, these ought you to have
[54:58] done, and not to leave the other undone.
[55:02] So yeah, let's uh let's pay attention to
[55:04] the big things, but don't forget the
[55:05] little things. Amen. What what good is
[55:08] it if we understand all the mysteries,
[55:11] right? And our habits, our parking
[55:15] habits is kind of suffering. our uh
[55:18] traffic uh courtesy out on the road,
[55:21] cutting somebody off, not being
[55:23] considerate.
[55:25] Uh our the Christian character, the life
[55:28] of
[55:29] Christ, I don't believe, now this is
[55:32] just opinion, I guess, so take it for
[55:34] what it's worth. I don't think the life
[55:36] of Christ is displayed on the knowledge
[55:37] we have of this message, the Bible, uh
[55:41] those things are good. they go with it.
[55:45] But we don't want to underemphasize
[55:47] those things. And and this is what Jesus
[55:49] is saying. He says the love of uh you
[55:52] passed over these other big things. You
[55:54] ought to have done those, but don't
[55:56] forget the little things.
[55:59] So, we can all get it's so easy to get
[56:01] concentrating on the big things and then
[56:04] just uh let the little things go and be
[56:05] a little rude. And here I was up there
[56:07] preparing this. Uh, I've been kind of in
[56:10] a crunch for time and uh been gone all
[56:12] weekend. Got back Sunday night and
[56:15] Monday had business with uh I've got a
[56:18] lot of things that I've trying to get
[56:20] wrapped up with um after mom passed. So,
[56:23] a lot of things on my mind, a lot of
[56:24] things to do and and I didn't get to it
[56:26] on Monday. So, Tuesday evening I was
[56:29] setting up there where my computer set
[56:31] up. was kind of in the hallway and and
[56:33] um kept the kids downstairs so I could
[56:35] study upstairs and uh well Bron would
[56:38] come up and she said tripping up there
[56:39] or walking along there and daddy this
[56:42] and that and I've been out doing this
[56:44] that and honey I'm studying so she goes
[56:48] back downstairs I'm just here reading
[56:51] about all this kind gracious spirit I
[56:55] love you honey I do too she was happy so
[56:59] that's kind of when or cute saying, "I
[57:02] love you, honey. I do, too." All right.
[57:04] Do you love me, though? So, uh, got to
[57:07] love those kitties. But, you know, just,
[57:10] and I've I've said this before,
[57:12] different instances that you make a
[57:14] little comment and then something pricks
[57:16] your heart. It's like, "That person
[57:18] didn't understand the way you worded
[57:20] that. You didn't mean anything wrong,
[57:22] but they may have taken that
[57:24] wrong." They'll get over it. Well, maybe
[57:28] they will, maybe they won't.
[57:30] We don't want to cause offense.
[57:32] Well, they're they're just serpent seed,
[57:35] are they? Is that your call to make?
[57:38] Well, they've Yeah, I I know them. They
[57:40] they they're they're out. They're gone.
[57:42] They're long gone. Okay, let's say that
[57:45] they are. But maybe your
[57:49] conduct can do something to help them
[57:51] along the way.
[57:53] Uh maybe your conduct can send them
[57:56] further the way from the Lord or maybe
[57:58] draw them closer to the Lord. And uh
[58:03] I take it serious. I think God does,
[58:05] too.
[58:08] So you say, "Well, Brother Ron, you're
[58:10] just simple on these things." And uh
[58:13] um you we're in the bride age, and we
[58:16] ought to be on we ought to be beyond
[58:19] this simple sermon like this. Well,
[58:21] yeah, we we we should be we should have
[58:23] this down, but there's young ones coming
[58:26] up. And uh and then there's older ones
[58:29] like myself that forget as well. So, uh
[58:32] if God put this on his heart and he
[58:34] placed it on my heart, then uh you just
[58:36] keep pulling. You'll get what you need,
[58:38] too.
[58:40] And uh because uh God's deep, his word's
[58:43] deep.
[58:44] And uh maybe I am a simpleton. Okay, I'm
[58:48] all right with that. If that's what he's
[58:50] called me to be, then I I'll be
[58:53] satisfied with that and I'll just be the
[58:55] best simpleton I can be. All right.
[58:57] Amen. Amen. And you pray for me that God
[58:59] will get full use out of this simpleton.
[59:01] If that's my job, that's my position.
[59:05] I don't have it up on the screen. Know
[59:07] your position. Be satisfied in it. Stay
[59:09] there. All right. I'm going to stay
[59:12] simple. All right. And when he's ready
[59:14] for me to move on from that, we'll uh
[59:16] we'll we'll do that. Are you willing to
[59:19] be a fool for Christ? He was a fool for
[59:21] you. Yeah. Hung up on the cross. We know
[59:25] the story.
[59:27] Uh he took the shame. Are we willing to
[59:30] do that?
[59:32] You know, that was that was part of my
[59:35] vow to the Lord, I guess, as I sought
[59:38] the Holy Ghost as a child. Lord,
[59:40] whatever you've got for me, whatever you
[59:43] want, you got to be
[59:45] desperate. Lord, if it means speaking in
[59:48] tongues in front of my co-workers, these
[59:51] rough
[59:53] sinners, unapologetic
[59:55] sinners, construction guys, if I have to
[59:58] speak in tongues and make a fool of
[59:59] myself, Lord, whatever it
[1:00:03] takes. Hey, how about if you stand in
[1:00:05] front of people in the church and make a
[1:00:07] fool of yourself? I'm good with that
[1:00:09] God. Amen. I'm not
[1:00:12] ashamed. You know, it's one thing when
[1:00:14] when your enemies call you a fool, but
[1:00:16] when it's your brothers and sisters that
[1:00:18] call you a fool, maybe that hurts a
[1:00:19] little bit more. But Christ took it.
[1:00:22] Amen. It wasn't the Romans that killed
[1:00:23] him. They was just the tip of the spear
[1:00:26] that the the Jews were were holding. It
[1:00:28] was his people, the ones he came for.
[1:00:32] True. And he took it. That's right.
[1:00:36] Well, if that's the spirit of Christ and
[1:00:37] you got the spirit of Christ, I think
[1:00:39] you'll take it, too. Amen.
[1:00:42] If you rare
[1:00:43] up um maybe we better go back to read
[1:00:46] our text again.
[1:00:52] Amen. The life of Christ, that's your
[1:00:55] position right there. We could sum it up
[1:00:57] right
[1:00:58] there. What is your position? It's not
[1:01:00] not picking up trash there at
[1:01:02] Spallingers. It's not the county
[1:01:03] highway. It's not it's not just row
[1:01:06] five, seat six, whatever your assigned
[1:01:09] seat is. It's not just being a pastor of
[1:01:11] the church or a missionary. Uh that may
[1:01:15] be what you're assigned to do. Your duty
[1:01:17] while you're here on this earth, but
[1:01:19] your position is the bride of Jesus
[1:01:22] Christ. Amen. To manifest Christ. If
[1:01:25] this is part of the
[1:01:27] manifestation, then you're called to
[1:01:28] manifest that. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:31] Recognize it. Know it. Recognize it. be
[1:01:34] satisfied with it. Stick with it.
[1:01:37] The life of Christ has that tenderness
[1:01:38] and care.
[1:01:40] So when if that's the way it was
[1:01:42] displayed 2,000 years
[1:01:45] ago, that's the way it was displayed
[1:01:47] through William
[1:01:49] Brandom. Why is it going to display
[1:01:51] something else through you? Well, you
[1:01:53] don't know my situation. Well, we don't
[1:01:56] need to argue about that. Not going to
[1:01:57] argue about that.
[1:02:01] you find out where I'm at, where I'm
[1:02:07] going. You I once uh was talking to a
[1:02:11] man and I referred to first Corinthians
[1:02:15] 13 there and he said uh I think that's
[1:02:20] overemphasized. So to which I replied, I
[1:02:23] don't think you can overemphasize the
[1:02:25] Bible
[1:02:28] now. We don't understand it and
[1:02:30] sometimes we misapply it. But I think it
[1:02:32] all needs to be
[1:02:34] emphasized. We want to be the revelated
[1:02:37] eagles that rippers with the
[1:02:39] bill. Tear down, set straight, cracked
[1:02:43] everybody. Uh got my DNA. Well, it's
[1:02:47] ugly. I don't like it. It's got to
[1:02:51] die. It's a selfish spirit. Brother Ram
[1:02:54] says said, 'I recognized the other day a
[1:02:56] selfish spirit coming up in me of saying
[1:02:58] this man's wrong. I have to tell him
[1:03:00] about it. That's wrong. God's the one to
[1:03:03] tell him about it. That's not It's none
[1:03:05] of my business, but my business is
[1:03:06] preach the gospel and love everybody and
[1:03:08] move on and love my enemies as Jesus
[1:03:09] Christ loved me when I was his enemy.
[1:03:11] That's right. When I was unloly, he
[1:03:14] loved me to his bosom. And anybody
[1:03:15] that's unloly, let me love them the
[1:03:17] same. Let the spirit that was in Christ
[1:03:19] be in us. Amen. I love him. I love him.
[1:03:21] Oh my. Amen. Let's balance this
[1:03:23] statement
[1:03:25] out. I don't know if you're familiar
[1:03:27] with this, but uh in this 1962, you
[1:03:30] remember when brother Brandham had the
[1:03:32] gun blow up on him and boogered up his
[1:03:35] face and and God spared him. He says,
[1:03:37] "The other day when the gun went off, I
[1:03:39] went right back down to see if I could
[1:03:41] shoot again. I don't want it to scare
[1:03:42] me. If I had a wreck out on the road, I
[1:03:44] wouldn't quit driving a car. If I walked
[1:03:46] across the floor and stumbled my toe in
[1:03:47] the carpet and went through the window,
[1:03:48] I wouldn't quit walking." See? No. No.
[1:03:51] God give me a clean exercise. That was
[1:03:52] Satan. That wasn't God. See, that was
[1:03:54] Satan. Now, I know the spiritual
[1:03:56] application to it. There's three of us
[1:03:58] in this room right now that knows what
[1:04:00] it is. And it raised the hair on your
[1:04:01] head. But I wouldn't tell no one. See,
[1:04:04] just these three people for
[1:04:06] confirmation. Now, it's all right. It's
[1:04:08] all God knowed all about it and
[1:04:09] forewarned it and everything else. And
[1:04:11] we know it. And it was partly my fault.
[1:04:13] And I had something I took up for a man
[1:04:15] one time when I should not have took up.
[1:04:17] I could have just shook the liver out of
[1:04:19] him. See, instead of doing it, I had to
[1:04:21] pay for it. So then, so we That's all
[1:04:23] right. It's me. It's been forgiven now,
[1:04:25] and we'll go on.
[1:04:28] He didn't have an easy easy road.
[1:04:30] There's a responsibility. Now, we read
[1:04:32] these two quotes, and they look
[1:04:34] contradictory. He said, "It's not my
[1:04:36] business to to correct the man. That's a
[1:04:38] selfish spirit." Now, he's saying, "I
[1:04:40] should have corrected the man and I got
[1:04:42] in trouble for it." So, now what do we
[1:04:45] do?
[1:04:46] We've got to have the heart of Christ.
[1:04:48] Amen.
[1:04:50] uh going through uh mom's will and I
[1:04:55] guess most of you know maybe brother
[1:04:57] Hector wouldn't know but my mom just
[1:04:59] passed
[1:04:59] away three four weeks ago and uh
[1:05:03] suddenly so I'm an executive of the
[1:05:06] estate so my job is to equally represent
[1:05:09] each heir that's my job if I get pulling
[1:05:14] some little finagles and like don't like
[1:05:16] this one and we're going to hide a
[1:05:18] little money over here. Yeah, I'm going
[1:05:19] to be in trouble. I've got to I've got
[1:05:21] to equally represent each one of them.
[1:05:23] So, I'm trying to do that and we're all
[1:05:25] the kids and brothers and sister were
[1:05:27] getting along good and and uh you know
[1:05:29] what what does the will say? We read
[1:05:31] that and um and we say, "Well, you know,
[1:05:34] mom, she she always liked, you know, my
[1:05:37] sister-in-law down in Tennessee, she
[1:05:39] does quilts. Mom did bunch of quilts for
[1:05:41] all 28 grandchildren, all seven
[1:05:42] children, and all six uh sons and
[1:05:46] daughters-in-laws." So she had she done
[1:05:48] a bunch of hand quilting. So she done a
[1:05:50] real good job. And uh and my
[1:05:53] sister-in-law down in Tennessee, she
[1:05:54] likes to quilt also. And so they had
[1:05:56] that connection. But yet the will says
[1:05:59] everything's to be equally divided. Now
[1:06:01] we know that she probably would like for
[1:06:04] her to get like maybe a sewing machine
[1:06:07] and some of her favorite quilts. And
[1:06:10] it's in mom's heart that she probably
[1:06:12] doesn't want Ron getting that turn that
[1:06:14] into a shop rag, you know. Uh, it's not
[1:06:18] going to
[1:06:18] happen. I seen some of the sisters
[1:06:21] hearts going pitterpatter there. So, we
[1:06:24] know mom's heart.
[1:06:27] But we read the letter of the will and
[1:06:30] it says, "Divided equally."
[1:06:34] Okay. Now, me and my sister-in-law are
[1:06:36] going to be fighting. I get one of those
[1:06:39] quilts. The law says,
[1:06:42] "But mom's heart said." Amen. How can we
[1:06:45] fulfill the law and fulfill her heart?
[1:06:49] Now, and I was talking to the the kids
[1:06:51] about this, the brothers and
[1:06:53] sisters. So, we know the heart and I
[1:06:56] think if we try to fulfill mom's heart's
[1:06:59] desire, I don't think she wants us
[1:07:02] abandoning the law
[1:07:05] to try to do
[1:07:07] this. That's that's not the right
[1:07:09] interpretation. I don't feel I think if
[1:07:12] you've got the heart of mom, I think you
[1:07:15] can fulfill both. I think we can equally
[1:07:17] equally divide this.
[1:07:21] And really in my my way of seeing it,
[1:07:23] it's like sister-in-law, you can have
[1:07:25] the quilts. You would enjoy them better.
[1:07:27] I would better than I would. Amen. And
[1:07:29] if we have the heart of mom, even though
[1:07:33] in her
[1:07:35] um uh human failings, as all of us, if
[1:07:40] she forgot to put something in there,
[1:07:42] sister-in-law in Tennessee, she gets so
[1:07:44] many quilts, she gets this, she gets all
[1:07:49] my knitting needles. What's what's Ron
[1:07:51] going to do it do with it? you know, if
[1:07:53] she admitted something, if she forgot
[1:07:55] something, I think if we've got our
[1:07:57] heart, I think we can fulfill both both
[1:07:59] of these things. And it's so easy. We
[1:08:01] can we can say uh you know, the law um
[1:08:04] the law says this, the law says that. We
[1:08:06] can look in the Old Testament, we can
[1:08:07] see all the laws that brother Brandham
[1:08:09] preached and and sometimes because of
[1:08:11] our understanding, we don't understand
[1:08:13] how the law and the heart of God
[1:08:15] correspond.
[1:08:17] God didn't make any mistakes. Now, mom,
[1:08:19] she may have, you know, she may have
[1:08:22] regretted if she was to think about it,
[1:08:25] if somebody was to point it out to her,
[1:08:26] say, "Hey, you remember you always
[1:08:29] wanted to give this to a certain
[1:08:31] daughter or a certain son and you never
[1:08:34] got that stated. You never you never
[1:08:36] said that and you never wrote it down.
[1:08:39] And now you're passed and now alls we've
[1:08:41] got is the law here to go." and my
[1:08:46] great-grandfather's anvil. Not my great,
[1:08:48] my grandfather's anvil out in the barn.
[1:08:51] Who better to have it than I? I've got
[1:08:54] one already, but but I should have that.
[1:08:57] But the law
[1:08:59] says it's equally divided.
[1:09:03] And in the mix and the figuring it all
[1:09:06] out, one of the sisters may get it if
[1:09:09] she wants it, you know, because we got
[1:09:12] to do this according to the law.
[1:09:14] And maybe mom thought, "Yeah, I'm going
[1:09:16] to give that to Ron. It's it's obvious
[1:09:18] and it's just an oversight. She forgot.
[1:09:20] But if our heart's right, we'll fulfill
[1:09:23] the law. We'll fulfill her heart." And I
[1:09:25] think she'd be pleased
[1:09:27] if we make an error trying to do what's
[1:09:30] right instead of trying to just fudge
[1:09:32] and say,
[1:09:33] "H, yeah, that's mine. I'm just going to
[1:09:36] take that anyway."
[1:09:39] Because I think sometimes we do that
[1:09:41] when it comes to the word of God. Some
[1:09:42] people do. Hopefully not us, but uh say
[1:09:45] I understand the heart of God, so I can
[1:09:47] start making some
[1:09:49] amendments. But I think if you fulfill
[1:09:51] the heart of God, you're going to
[1:09:53] fulfill the law, too.
[1:09:56] Uh
[1:09:58] I don't know where we'll get to this,
[1:09:59] but you know, the
[1:10:02] law, thou shalt not, let's let's say
[1:10:05] like the woman, she she shouldn't wear
[1:10:07] pants. Uh, Brother Brham said it, you
[1:10:11] know, he said, "Well, that's Old
[1:10:11] Testament." Well, we've been we've been
[1:10:13] sent a prophet. And he reaffirmed that.
[1:10:16] We'll take that. Okay. So, all right.
[1:10:18] So, she's got to wear a skirt. I was
[1:10:20] thinking about using the whiteboard, but
[1:10:22] that's too much for me. And my drawing
[1:10:24] is not that bad good anyway. So, so the
[1:10:27] sister, she's got to wear a skirt. She's
[1:10:29] got to wear a dress. And, uh, you know,
[1:10:32] it's got to cover the kneecaps. And,
[1:10:35] know, it's got to be all the way to the
[1:10:36] ankle.
[1:10:37] where's where's it at? And the higher
[1:10:40] above the ankle it gets, you know, the
[1:10:41] less Holy Ghost she's got. And uh
[1:10:46] there's a problem here. Amen. And and
[1:10:49] she's trying to get trying to get away
[1:10:52] with all she can and she's trying to get
[1:10:54] it as tight as she can. She's trying the
[1:10:56] law. What what what does God want? He
[1:10:58] wants modesty, right? Okay. Well, I
[1:11:00] think if we've got the heart of God,
[1:11:02] we're going to understand because
[1:11:04] there's and I've got a quote here. We'll
[1:11:06] read it in just a minute. And I've got
[1:11:08] one quote that um almost embarrassing to
[1:11:09] read, but the prophet said it, so we're
[1:11:11] going to read it. So up here make my
[1:11:14] fool out of myself. So you just keep
[1:11:16] pulling. Amen.
[1:11:19] But what about some of those poor
[1:11:23] sisters that cannot afford a dress and
[1:11:27] now they're outgrowing
[1:11:28] them? Say overseas, let's say a third
[1:11:31] world country, probably not here. You
[1:11:33] could, sister, if you've outgrown your
[1:11:35] dress, you talk to Brother Ron. I'll
[1:11:38] I'll help you get a dress so you can get
[1:11:41] it here. But what about over there? What
[1:11:43] about overseas?
[1:11:44] And that sister's dress doesn't quite
[1:11:46] cover the kneecap or whatever your line
[1:11:49] is, right?
[1:11:52] Uh we're going to condemn her. Uh what's
[1:11:56] her heart? She's trying to fulfill it.
[1:11:58] She's wearing a She's wearing the only
[1:12:00] skirt that she's got and she's just
[1:12:02] trying the best she can and her heart's
[1:12:04] right, but her clothes aren't because
[1:12:07] you can
[1:12:08] put uh a prostitute in a long skirt.
[1:12:12] Amen. And don't make her a daughter of
[1:12:13] God, right? Don't make her full of the
[1:12:15] Holy Ghost. Drop it all the way to the
[1:12:17] ground, all the way. Cover the ankles,
[1:12:18] too. Sleeves clear to the fingertips. Uh
[1:12:23] you know that the problem, what's the
[1:12:25] heart of God? Right. And I think if
[1:12:27] we've got the right right heart, we're
[1:12:29] going to fulfill that because you go
[1:12:31] overseas uh and there's guys out there
[1:12:35] in the rice patties and just a just a
[1:12:39] turban, you know, a towel wrapped around
[1:12:41] them their waist. We wouldn't do that
[1:12:42] here, right? But over there, that's
[1:12:46] that's the way they do it. So, what's
[1:12:48] what's the heart of God? uh you know
[1:12:52] especially the sisters you know because
[1:12:53] we can concentrate on that because
[1:12:55] they've got rules and regulations you
[1:12:58] know but what is the heart of God if
[1:13:00] your heart's right with the Lord you're
[1:13:02] going you're going to you're going to
[1:13:03] fulfill it and if you come in with your
[1:13:05] sleeves too short your skirt too short u
[1:13:09] brother Bram said he preached in those
[1:13:10] meetings women stark naked or just with
[1:13:13] a cloud on Holy Ghost drop and they walk
[1:13:16] out and get right yeah amen So right
[1:13:20] right. So if if that happens here, some
[1:13:22] sisters not maybe according to the law
[1:13:25] and our jurisdiction or our
[1:13:28] understanding and our regulations of it.
[1:13:30] Uh the Holy Spirit can can deal with
[1:13:32] that. Amen. Where we at
[1:13:36] here? You know, agape love.
[1:13:42] Uh yeah, brother Brandham. So, we was
[1:13:46] talking about, you know, at one point,
[1:13:47] Brother Brandham was saying it was a
[1:13:48] selfish spirit to go correct the man.
[1:13:50] But then again, another time because I
[1:13:52] didn't correct the man, I got in
[1:13:53] trouble. Yeah. Um, how do you balance
[1:13:56] that? If you've got the heart of God,
[1:13:58] he'll tell you when it's time to speak,
[1:13:59] when it's not time to speak. But if
[1:14:01] you're going on your own, Yeah. If
[1:14:02] you're trying to set your uh dress code
[1:14:05] on your own, you're going to miss it.
[1:14:07] But you get the heart of God, you'll get
[1:14:09] the dress code right. You'll get the uh
[1:14:11] the conduct right. You'll get your
[1:14:12] parking right. you'll get your tipping
[1:14:14] right. So, let let's this is part of our
[1:14:16] heritage. This is part of our position
[1:14:18] is to have the right spirit here.
[1:14:21] You know, agape love is not a
[1:14:23] pushover. Uh because you people can say,
[1:14:26] well, because you don't say something,
[1:14:28] you know, said, you know, I found a
[1:14:30] selfish spirit wanting to tell this man
[1:14:32] or whatever it was, you know, I want to
[1:14:34] set him straight. Well, that's a selfish
[1:14:35] spirit. And then somebody else may say,
[1:14:37] well, that's just a pushover. Well, you
[1:14:39] know, agape love is not a pushover. and
[1:14:41] it'll speak up at at the proper time.
[1:14:44] But yet, agape love when it was here
[1:14:47] walking the streets of Nazareth was
[1:14:49] pushed all over the place. Pushed right
[1:14:51] up pushed right up on the cross. Yeah.
[1:14:54] And how do we understand that? How do we
[1:14:56] balance that out? Because if he would
[1:14:59] have pushed back, it would have been for
[1:15:00] his own good.
[1:15:02] But he didn't push back, right? For your
[1:15:05] good. Yeah. If he' have pushed back, you
[1:15:08] would have suffered. Yeah. So he took
[1:15:11] it.
[1:15:12] So if that was the spirit of Christ
[1:15:13] then, it's still the spirit of Christ
[1:15:15] today. It's the same yesterday, today,
[1:15:16] and forever. Amen. That's right. When
[1:15:19] you start getting pushed
[1:15:21] around, sometimes there's a time to
[1:15:23] stand up. But who are you standing for?
[1:15:26] Sometimes you got to stand up for the
[1:15:27] little guy. Sometimes you got to you
[1:15:30] fathers, you got to correct your your
[1:15:31] family. You know, you just can't let
[1:15:32] them walk all over you and and go off
[1:15:35] because you're responsible. You have a
[1:15:37] responsibility there. Amen. Uh,
[1:15:40] but what are you pushing back on? Is it
[1:15:42] for your defense? Are you willing to
[1:15:45] take take the
[1:15:47] hit? Christ allowed himself to be pushed
[1:15:50] right up on the cross. Are you be are
[1:15:53] you willing to be pushed around for the
[1:15:54] sake of
[1:15:55] others? 2 Corinthians 5:18 to21. And all
[1:15:59] things are of God, who hath reconciled
[1:16:01] us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath
[1:16:03] given to us the ministry of
[1:16:04] reconciliation. We've got a position.
[1:16:06] We've got a we've got a job.
[1:16:09] We got a responsibility. Know
[1:16:11] it. Be satisfied with it. Stay there. He
[1:16:16] has given us the ministry of
[1:16:17] reconciliation to it that God was in
[1:16:19] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:16:21] himself, not imputing their trespasses
[1:16:23] unto them, and hath committed unto us
[1:16:25] the word of reconciliation. And then we
[1:16:28] are ambassadors for Christ, as though
[1:16:29] God did beseech you by us. as God's not
[1:16:33] walking the streets
[1:16:35] today, not in the robe and sandals.
[1:16:40] He needs somebody there at Spallinger.
[1:16:42] That's right.
[1:16:44] Or wherever you're at, he needs somebody
[1:16:46] there.
[1:16:48] You are to do that for Christ's sake. As
[1:16:51] though as though God did beseech you.
[1:16:54] How do these people that you come up in
[1:16:56] contact with them? Are are they uh are
[1:17:01] they getting the same treatment that
[1:17:03] they would have gotten if Jesus Christ
[1:17:05] himself walked in there? Are they
[1:17:08] getting maybe a a little modified
[1:17:12] treatment as
[1:17:13] Christ as Christ did beseech you as
[1:17:16] though God did beseech you by
[1:17:19] us. We pray you in Christstead be you
[1:17:22] reconciled to God. For he hath made him
[1:17:24] to be sin for us who knew no sin that we
[1:17:27] might be made the righteousness of God
[1:17:29] in
[1:17:34] him. Okay, here's several quotes
[1:17:40] here. So sister speaks to brother
[1:17:42] Brandham and he says, "Yes, that's
[1:17:44] right, sister. Yes, sir. The woman I
[1:17:46] said the woman the women would become so
[1:17:48] im immoral in the last. Now you know 30
[1:17:51] years ago how they dressed said they'd
[1:17:53] become so immoral till they'd walk down
[1:17:54] the street with till like just like
[1:17:57] their underneath clothes on. I said then
[1:17:59] will come to pass that they'll even be
[1:18:01] so disgraceful till they're wearing
[1:18:02] something look like a fig leaf. I saw it
[1:18:04] and they've got it and they're wearing
[1:18:06] it and just the immoral immorality of
[1:18:08] women would get so low and degraded. We
[1:18:11] can't go no lower now. You can't go no
[1:18:13] worse. That she's at the end. See,
[1:18:15] they'll never be completely nude. No,
[1:18:18] they I preach to the people, women by
[1:18:20] the tens of thousands that don't have
[1:18:21] one speck of clothes on them. See, young
[1:18:23] men, young women and all, but they don't
[1:18:25] know they're naked. See, they don't know
[1:18:27] it. And the way women act today, I was
[1:18:29] talking to the other night to some
[1:18:31] friends of mine where we was way back up
[1:18:33] in the mountains and a young woman I
[1:18:35] just prayed for her baby. It had
[1:18:37] epilepsy and the baby's well. And a
[1:18:39] little poor family way back up in a
[1:18:41] holler, little old tobacco patch around
[1:18:43] the house and about two rooms in it. and
[1:18:44] seven or eight children. That woman
[1:18:46] works. Oh my, just a broad axe out there
[1:18:48] chopping wood and things and hoing the
[1:18:50] garden and canning stuff. And I looked
[1:18:52] at the poor woman, same dress she's been
[1:18:54] wearing for a year or two and it's all
[1:18:56] split up and everything. And and he
[1:18:58] didn't rebuke her. Sister, that's
[1:19:00] immoral. That's
[1:19:01] indecent. Uh all split up and
[1:19:03] everything. And I was trying to find
[1:19:05] some of Mita's dresses to take down to
[1:19:06] her next week. Um, we're trying to help
[1:19:09] her
[1:19:10] just a little selfish spirit get us get
[1:19:13] in us and and rip and tear. And we
[1:19:15] noticed standing there a couple of
[1:19:17] brothers and I, the lady nursing her
[1:19:18] baby, she just removed her breast from
[1:19:20] her from her dress and began to nurse
[1:19:21] the baby. It was kind of amazing for a
[1:19:23] minute that's the way my mother nursed
[1:19:25] me. It's exactly right. I have more
[1:19:27] honor for a woman like that than I do
[1:19:28] some of the these women that put a
[1:19:30] little strap under them to throw
[1:19:31] themselves out. Don't even look like a
[1:19:33] human being. They got a purpose in doing
[1:19:35] that. That's sexy, ungodly. Woman wear
[1:19:38] ever so many clothes and try to make
[1:19:40] herself look like something she isn't.
[1:19:42] Why women ain't ain't actually that way.
[1:19:44] It's some kind of a Hollywood stuff. And
[1:19:46] the devil's spirit get on them woman to
[1:19:48] make them try to attract attention to
[1:19:49] men through sex. A woman's rest was
[1:19:51] given her for a baby to nurse. That's
[1:19:53] exactly right. The woman's right in the
[1:19:55] primitive line, but she's she's lined
[1:19:57] right. And I have more respect for that
[1:19:59] for that woman like that cuz she that's
[1:20:01] the way her mother raised her. That's
[1:20:03] the way they they never don't pay any
[1:20:05] attention to it. See the baby nursed
[1:20:07] right out there like the Madonna picture
[1:20:08] that you'd see. And if people would only
[1:20:10] get their mindset like that, it would be
[1:20:12] different. But when you come to go on
[1:20:14] the outside, maybe wear so much of a
[1:20:16] blouse or so forth and then boost
[1:20:17] yourself out there with straps and
[1:20:19] things and that looks ungodly and cause
[1:20:21] men. Do you realize that's a spirit of
[1:20:23] the devil on you? Oh yeah. So you don't
[1:20:25] want to do that, sister. Don't you do
[1:20:26] that. That's Hollywood's makeup and the
[1:20:28] trap of the devil. When you do that, you
[1:20:30] make men think the wrong thing about
[1:20:32] you. And when you do that, then you're
[1:20:33] guilty of committing adultery with that
[1:20:34] man because you presented yourself that
[1:20:37] way to him. You can't help the way
[1:20:38] you're built, but just go on and stay
[1:20:40] the way God made you. See, don't try to
[1:20:42] make yourself something that you're not.
[1:20:44] Just stay human being. That awful. Well,
[1:20:47] maybe that answers some question or
[1:20:48] somebody too. I remember him remember
[1:20:50] him reading that hearing that and uh I
[1:20:53] think he's kind of a little apologetic
[1:20:55] for that's awful. Just I think he's
[1:20:56] referring to the way he's he spoke. But
[1:20:59] either way, it that's awful the way they
[1:21:01] do or it's awful that I actually said
[1:21:04] that and I thinking, "Oh my goodness,
[1:21:06] uh, that's what you want me to read,
[1:21:08] Lord." So, okay. But that's what the
[1:21:09] prophet said. But the point of that is,
[1:21:13] you know, we talk about immorality and
[1:21:15] the way the women dress and act and
[1:21:17] stuff and uh, you know, if I could get
[1:21:19] on the whiteboard here, we could show
[1:21:21] what length the skirt is, right? And how
[1:21:23] low the neckline is. and and here this
[1:21:25] woman's exposing herself,
[1:21:27] but her spirit's right.
[1:21:30] And I know as a man, I've experienced
[1:21:32] the same thing, you can have a woman all
[1:21:34] covered up with the wrong spirit. You
[1:21:37] can put a prostitute in a gunny sack,
[1:21:41] which like a burlap bag. There's nothing
[1:21:43] adorable about it, nothing attractive
[1:21:45] about it. She could put that on and
[1:21:48] still pick up business. Yeah. Cuz
[1:21:50] there's a spirit there. Amen.
[1:21:53] And then you can also have a sister
[1:21:55] dress nicely, attractively, and not be
[1:21:58] pulling on that spirit. And I have seen
[1:22:00] it with my own self. And I I forget
[1:22:02] where I was at, but some sister nurse,
[1:22:04] not I don't know if it was a sister,
[1:22:05] just some woman nursing her baby. And
[1:22:08] you know, I seen more than I wanted to
[1:22:10] see, but there was no pull there. There
[1:22:12] was the spirit was not was not uh
[1:22:16] offensive.
[1:22:17] And then sometimes you you see them
[1:22:20] fully clothed, covered up, and they got
[1:22:22] a spirit that's pulling withered. Well,
[1:22:25] that's awful. As he said, that's
[1:22:27] awful. So, so if do we know the mind of
[1:22:30] God? You say, "Well, she shouldn't be
[1:22:33] wearing a neckline this this way or that
[1:22:35] way." And what's the spirit behind it?
[1:22:37] And maybe it's the only shirt she's got.
[1:22:39] Well, she get the right spirit. She'll
[1:22:41] she'll get it right. And then you get
[1:22:43] get yourself right too, brother. Look,
[1:22:45] if Florence Nightingale, this is in
[1:22:48] 1963, the great granddaughter of the
[1:22:50] late Florence Nightingale that founded
[1:22:52] the Red Cross, you've seen her picture
[1:22:53] in a book, weighed about 30 pounds,
[1:22:54] cancer had eaten her up in London,
[1:22:56] England. They brought her from Africa to
[1:22:58] London, England. And there in despair,
[1:23:00] Brother Bosworth wrote back and told
[1:23:01] her, said, "We can't come to Africa."
[1:23:03] She wrote back, had the nurse to write
[1:23:04] and said, "I can't be moved. I can't do
[1:23:06] it." Showed the picture. You seen the
[1:23:08] picture. Only we had to put a little
[1:23:10] piece over it. Just had a small cord
[1:23:12] around. I thought maybe somebody put it
[1:23:15] in the book might criticize because she
[1:23:16] was her body was so exposed there that
[1:23:18] and we had put a little thing across
[1:23:20] there. She just had a little rag
[1:23:22] toweling across across her hips, but up
[1:23:24] above there was nothing. And even we
[1:23:26] thought we'd put a little piece of paper
[1:23:27] on it and photograph the uh photograph
[1:23:29] that keep the people out there or who
[1:23:32] has not got the right kind of a position
[1:23:33] in their mind of thinking that they
[1:23:35] wouldn't criticize me putting that
[1:23:36] picture in there in the paper. So what
[1:23:39] is the mind of God? Brother Bram's
[1:23:41] saying
[1:23:43] indicating that wouldn't be wrong if
[1:23:45] your if your mind's right. Right. Right.
[1:23:52] So if we start trying to make a
[1:23:55] uh what would be a creed, a manifesto, a
[1:24:00] list, what's right, what's wrong? Skirts
[1:24:02] got to be this high. Neckline's got to
[1:24:04] be here. Sleeves here, there. We start
[1:24:08] doing that. If you're going to hit stuff
[1:24:10] like this and say, "Okay, it's okay to
[1:24:11] be exposed
[1:24:13] now. Now we we got problems. We got we
[1:24:16] got real problems.
[1:24:18] The problem's right here. Not not in the
[1:24:20] length of the skirt. Problems right
[1:24:21] here. Right in the heart.
[1:24:24] Not in the length of the sleeve. In the
[1:24:26] heart. Not in the jewelry. Not in the
[1:24:28] whatever it is. You know, uh you know,
[1:24:30] we talk about the sisters painting their
[1:24:33] fingernails. I think I've got paint on
[1:24:35] mine tonight.
[1:24:38] So, I know I've got black specks all
[1:24:39] over. I was painting in the weld shop
[1:24:41] and I didn't think about that till
[1:24:44] now. Got painted fingernails preaching
[1:24:46] in the
[1:24:47] pulpit. Oh, mum's the word. Sister,
[1:24:51] don't let that get back to brother Chad.
[1:24:53] So, brother brother Franco, edit
[1:24:56] that. What's the heart? Right? And I've
[1:24:59] often said that, you know, if I come
[1:25:01] home and my wife's got red fingernails,
[1:25:04] red
[1:25:05] lips, if it's because one of the kids
[1:25:08] knocked a pan can of paint over, I'm
[1:25:10] going to be laughing for a little bit.
[1:25:13] Uh, what's the spirit behind it? If
[1:25:16] she's dalled herself up to go out, we
[1:25:17] got a problem. We got to talk. But if
[1:25:20] the kids knocked the can of red paint on
[1:25:22] her, u probably going to take some
[1:25:24] pictures. Might be on Facebook. So,
[1:25:28] so praise the Lord.
[1:25:34] Here's that quote I was referring to
[1:25:35] earlier. But let me tell you a little
[1:25:37] secret. The most powerful force in the
[1:25:38] world isn't speaking with tongues or
[1:25:40] interpreting tongues or being honored by
[1:25:41] God to be a minister or to be an
[1:25:43] evangelist or to be a prophet. The most
[1:25:45] powerful weapon that I've ever found in
[1:25:46] my life is love. Fileo love with a Greek
[1:25:49] word comes from friendship like you have
[1:25:51] for your wife. There's a difference.
[1:25:53] It'll make a mother for that baby run
[1:25:55] through a blazing fire. Her life means
[1:25:57] nothing. That's filio. What will agapeo
[1:25:59] do? Godly love. We must love divinely
[1:26:03] love one another. Then you don't see
[1:26:05] your brother's mistakes. If he does make
[1:26:06] a mistake, you never you look over the
[1:26:08] top of it. You love him anyhow. See,
[1:26:10] that's it. Love those that love you.
[1:26:12] Then does that then does not the sinner
[1:26:14] the same thing? But love those who
[1:26:16] doesn't love you. That's what shows the
[1:26:18] spirit of God's in you because he loved
[1:26:20] you when you were his enemy and he loved
[1:26:22] you. that spirit's in you. It'll make
[1:26:24] you love your enemy as you do your
[1:26:26] friend. We're talking about your
[1:26:27] position.
[1:26:30] Uh, you know, Isaac, if he wants to know
[1:26:32] his position, if he wants to know what
[1:26:34] he's got in his
[1:26:36] future, well, look to daddy. Yeah, maybe
[1:26:39] you you lose your hair, son. Sorry about
[1:26:41] that. Not I can do not a lot I can do
[1:26:43] about that.
[1:26:44] But you're probably going to have a love
[1:26:46] for animals. You're probably going to
[1:26:48] have a love for being out in the woods.
[1:26:50] probably going to have a love for doing
[1:26:52] chainsaws and mechanical
[1:26:54] things. You know, I was I didn't know my
[1:26:57] grandfather growing up, but when I
[1:26:59] finally got my job and and worked there
[1:27:01] a few years and I was running a
[1:27:02] bulldozer and doing welding and and then
[1:27:04] I begin to get to know grandpa as an
[1:27:06] adult. He didn't really hang out with
[1:27:08] the kids much, but so as an adult, I
[1:27:10] began to relate to him and find out, oh,
[1:27:13] he was a bulldozer operator. Where'd
[1:27:15] that come from? He was a welder. He was
[1:27:17] mechanical. Where'd that come from? it
[1:27:19] come down the line. There's good things
[1:27:21] come down the line. There's bad things
[1:27:22] come down the line. But we can look to
[1:27:24] our father. We can look to our parents
[1:27:27] and kind of know what we got in store.
[1:27:29] If mama loves list, she loves gardening
[1:27:31] and she loves canning and well that's
[1:27:34] she loves quilting. Well, that's
[1:27:35] probably the way the daughter's going to
[1:27:37] go. U we can look to our heavenly
[1:27:40] father. Amen. And we can see the
[1:27:42] characteristics he's got and know that
[1:27:44] that's your position.
[1:27:46] That's your inheritance.
[1:27:49] know it. Be satisfied with it. Stay in
[1:27:52] it.
[1:27:54] You're not just picking up trash at
[1:27:56] Spallingers. You're not just sitting on
[1:27:57] a pew. You're not just the missionary or
[1:28:01] this, that, or the other. Uh we've got a
[1:28:03] higher calling than just these natural
[1:28:05] things in life. But we learn from them.
[1:28:08] You are the bride of Christ. You are the
[1:28:10] elect lady. Amen. You are the chosen.
[1:28:13] That's right. Amen. Uh, and if that
[1:28:16] makes you proud, then you've missed the
[1:28:18] boat somewhere because that was not part
[1:28:21] that's not part of your heritage from
[1:28:22] him. Amen.
[1:28:25] I want to close with this story here or
[1:28:27] try to. Anyway,
[1:28:32] on the farm, we had a big sheep dog.
[1:28:35] It's a great Pyrenees. I can't even
[1:28:36] remember his name. Great Pyrenees. I
[1:28:38] don't know if you've seen them before.
[1:28:39] They're they're a big white dog. They're
[1:28:43] they're big as big big dogs and they're
[1:28:47] bred for for being a sheep dog and they
[1:28:52] you know dogs like to sleep on the porch
[1:28:53] or under the porch or not a not a great
[1:28:56] pyrenees. They like to sleep out in the
[1:28:58] pasture. It's like a cow or a or a
[1:29:01] sheep. That's there they are. They're
[1:29:04] out there laying laying out in the
[1:29:05] middle of pasture. They don't eat grass.
[1:29:06] What's he doing out there? He's got to
[1:29:08] walk all the way back to the house to
[1:29:09] get his food. But that's what he likes
[1:29:11] to do. And that's that's his position.
[1:29:14] That's what he's been bred for. And
[1:29:15] that's he can't help it. So we had this
[1:29:19] great Pyrenees, but we didn't have any
[1:29:20] sheep. So he'd hang out with the cows.
[1:29:23] And uh them calves, they didn't want no
[1:29:26] dog hanging around them. And you know,
[1:29:28] they two or 300 500 lb calf. They just
[1:29:31] come up there and knock him down. He'd
[1:29:33] just fall down, waller around. They'd
[1:29:35] come wall in the in the dirt and mud and
[1:29:38] he'd get up. He just he didn't care.
[1:29:41] He was He was bred to be out there to be
[1:29:44] a protector of the livestock.
[1:29:47] He didn't care. It was It was so fun to
[1:29:50] to watch. And they just waller him
[1:29:53] around and and he he didn't get
[1:29:55] offended. Uh, but if a coyote, and I
[1:29:58] never seen this happen, not with him
[1:30:00] anyway, but if a coyote or neighbor's
[1:30:02] dog came over and was to attack that
[1:30:05] calf that just knocked him down, I'm
[1:30:10] guessing that he would have got up and
[1:30:12] took off after that coyote, that dog,
[1:30:15] and protected the one that was abusing
[1:30:17] him, because that's what he's bred for.
[1:30:21] He can't help it. It's in his genetics.
[1:30:23] It's in his DNA.
[1:30:26] uh he would attack the attacker. Now, if
[1:30:28] it was just a regular dog and that
[1:30:30] calf's wing, knocking him around and and
[1:30:33] wallering him around and and then a
[1:30:35] neighbor's dog come in to attack, well,
[1:30:37] that dog would get up and there'd be a
[1:30:38] team and they'd be going after that calf
[1:30:40] and we're going to get you. We're going
[1:30:41] to get you back. We're going to vaunting
[1:30:43] themselves up, you know, from our
[1:30:45] scripture there in 1 Corinthians 13. But
[1:30:47] not
[1:30:48] him. He has no animosity. They just
[1:30:51] knock him down and waller him around and
[1:30:54] he's just a big old buddy to him and he
[1:30:57] just get up and just have fun lay out
[1:30:59] there. He didn't run from him. Wasn't
[1:31:00] scared of him. Just was really neat to
[1:31:02] to watch there. But I think he'd have
[1:31:05] stood up for him cuz that's what he
[1:31:07] that's what he that's what he was.
[1:31:11] Now it's a simple story.
[1:31:14] But we see what Christ was. Yeah. And if
[1:31:17] that's what we are, if we say the way
[1:31:20] cross Christ acted,
[1:31:23] we can't if we if we are the bride of
[1:31:26] Christ, if we are the manifested word
[1:31:29] for this day, it's going to act the same
[1:31:31] way. Amen. If he took the hit, you're
[1:31:34] going to take the hit.
[1:31:37] Amen. Amen. Chew on that for a while
[1:31:40] because that's a good one.
[1:31:43] What is your position? What are you bred
[1:31:45] for? What? What's your DNA? What is
[1:31:47] what's your background?
[1:31:50] You know, I got blue eyes. Both my kids
[1:31:52] got blue
[1:31:53] eyes. They got it from somewhere. They
[1:31:55] got it from
[1:31:56] daddy.
[1:32:00] Uh you got some you've got some DNA
[1:32:03] behind you.
[1:32:05] And it's got to come to it's got to come
[1:32:07] manifested. Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:10] We got to think way above the carnal
[1:32:12] here.
[1:32:14] Where'd you come from? What's your
[1:32:15] background? You know, I've got a little
[1:32:17] Irish background. No, brother Ram said,
[1:32:20] I've said, I had to come to a
[1:32:21] realization that Charles and Ella
[1:32:23] Brandom was not my mother and father.
[1:32:26] Yeah. Amen.
[1:32:28] Yeah. Like I say, I've
[1:32:30] got, according to my sister going
[1:32:32] through the genetics there, we got a
[1:32:34] little German, a little bit of Irish, a
[1:32:36] little bit of English. Uh, muts
[1:32:39] basically. And, uh, got a little bit of
[1:32:42] this, a little bit of that. But I got to
[1:32:43] recognize, you know, because we can use
[1:32:45] that excuse. I got a little Irish in me,
[1:32:47] so yeah, of course I'm going to get up
[1:32:48] and fight, you know. Uh, no,
[1:32:52] Irish is not my heritage. Amen. I I got
[1:32:55] a different heritage. Amen. Praise the
[1:32:57] Lord. Uh, and we can look in the
[1:33:00] scriptures and we can see
[1:33:02] how a manifested son of God acted. Yeah.
[1:33:06] And then we can we can expect that same
[1:33:08] thing through us. Amen.
[1:33:11] how he lived his
[1:33:14] life when he walked this earth. He's
[1:33:16] going to live the same life if he walks
[1:33:18] the earth again. Is he walking the earth
[1:33:20] again?
[1:33:22] Is he Is he there working for
[1:33:23] Spallingers? Is he working for the
[1:33:25] county highway? Is he sleeping on the
[1:33:28] job or is he up front being being at it
[1:33:32] and doing his doing his duty?
[1:33:37] Save me, Franco.
[1:33:41] Put me on the back on the last slide
[1:33:44] there. See, that's his position. Don't
[1:33:48] abandon it, brother Frank. We need
[1:33:53] you. Okay, I see where we're at. Let me
[1:33:56] just see if I can stay there. See, be
[1:33:58] satisfied where you're at and stay
[1:33:59] there. Now, I did not stay
[1:34:01] there.
[1:34:04] Okay. What was his position? humility,
[1:34:08] fruits of the spirit, dying out,
[1:34:10] self-sacrifice, meekness,
[1:34:14] surrender. That's that's your genetics
[1:34:17] if you are called. That's your genetics.
[1:34:19] That's what you're going to do. You
[1:34:21] can't help it. That great
[1:34:23] Pyrenees couldn't get angry at that
[1:34:26] cow. It just wasn't in him. Uh praise
[1:34:29] the Lord. We've got a we've got a
[1:34:31] heritage. We should rejoice over that. I
[1:34:34] didn't know how this service was going
[1:34:35] to go, especially after that uh long
[1:34:38] quote I just read there. Oh my
[1:34:40] goodness. But this is a rejoicing
[1:34:42] message. So, thank you, Lord. What a
[1:34:45] great testament to a man's character if
[1:34:48] a king would pause and chat with a
[1:34:50] commoner or a CEO of a company would
[1:34:53] pause to talk to the trash picker. And
[1:34:56] when the God of heaven would identify
[1:34:57] himself with fallen man,
[1:35:01] that that's really saying something
[1:35:03] about a man's character.
[1:35:07] Uh when a redeemed son of God will give
[1:35:10] preference to one who hasn't found his
[1:35:13] identity in Christ yet, that speaks
[1:35:15] volumes to me
[1:35:19] because we come up against them every
[1:35:20] day. They might be sons of
[1:35:23] God. Might be a homeless drug addict.
[1:35:27] Just a curse and swear and
[1:35:31] reprobate. It might be a son of God. And
[1:35:34] he just hadn't come to know his position
[1:35:36] yet. You going to let him waller you
[1:35:38] around? You going to take
[1:35:40] it? Are you gonna let him push you
[1:35:44] around? If you've got it in your
[1:35:46] genetics, you
[1:35:47] will. If you see yourself pushing back a
[1:35:50] little bit, maybe
[1:35:52] better better look back and we've got to
[1:35:55] come to identify that we are not the son
[1:35:58] and
[1:35:59] daughter of our natural heritage. You
[1:36:03] know, my daddy was a good guy. Mama's a
[1:36:05] good guy. No, she wasn't. Mama's a good
[1:36:11] gal. But failures. Yeah, failures.
[1:36:16] You're talking about the dead that way.
[1:36:17] Yeah, I said that at the funeral. Oh my
[1:36:21] goodness. Yeah, just like me.
[1:36:25] Yeah, good people. Mom and dad, good
[1:36:27] people
[1:36:30] that
[1:36:31] came as good people because they had
[1:36:33] reidentified themselves.
[1:36:36] They didn't come from a good background
[1:36:39] with a silver spoon in their mouth
[1:36:42] spiritually speaking, right?
[1:36:44] or naturally speaking for that matter of
[1:36:46] fact would the musicians
[1:36:49] come but they had reidentified
[1:36:52] themselves not with
[1:36:55] uh that natural
[1:36:57] heritage and I can't identify myself
[1:37:00] that natural heritage either because I
[1:37:02] think when I see them over yonder
[1:37:03] they're both over
[1:37:05] there I don't know I call them mom and
[1:37:08] dad or brother and sister
[1:37:11] I don't know we'll figure it out when we
[1:37:13] get here. Amen.
[1:37:16] Appreciate you being here. Appreciate
[1:37:17] you pulling.
[1:37:19] Cuz I did not know how this would go,
[1:37:22] but it's been lovely. Amen. I appreciate
[1:37:24] it. Would we stand?
[1:37:26] Riley, come up here and save
[1:37:30] me. There was a song I was thinking
[1:37:32] about singing. I don't want to mess up
[1:37:34] your
[1:37:34] program, but there's a song. I can't
[1:37:37] remember what it is, but I always loved
[1:37:39] the uh the words there. says, "I would
[1:37:42] give anything. I would give everything."
[1:37:45] I can't remember what what song is
[1:37:47] that. I would give anything. I would
[1:37:50] give everything. Because, you know, it's
[1:37:53] almost like the songwriter is thinking,
[1:37:55] you would give anything. Yeah. I'd give
[1:37:58] up my pride, Lord. I'd give up my job. I
[1:38:01] would give up uh uh what do you want,
[1:38:03] Lord? You want
[1:38:05] this? Not just anything, but everything.
[1:38:09] Give it all to him.
[1:38:11] Amen. He gave it all for you. That's
[1:38:14] right. So, why not? Praise the Lord.
[1:38:16] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[1:38:18] it's been lovely to be here this
[1:38:21] evening. Trust that your spirit
[1:38:23] speaking, Lord, not just a man rambling
[1:38:25] along, Lord. Uh pray, Father, that your
[1:38:29] heart's been portrayed some way, Lord.
[1:38:33] Uh we see how precious
[1:38:36] um your spirit is, how tender it is, how
[1:38:40] thoughtful it is. Lord, just to have
[1:38:43] your prophet talk about parking in the
[1:38:46] lot, paint a
[1:38:49] tip. Father, maybe I've wandered around
[1:38:52] and about, but the people have been
[1:38:54] gracious, Lord. And I pray, Father, that
[1:38:56] if they haven't received something maybe
[1:38:58] that they needed today, Lord, would
[1:39:00] would you use this sermon, Lord, to
[1:39:03] speak to them in the days to come, Lord,
[1:39:06] to encourage
[1:39:08] [Music]
[1:39:09] them to help us to grow, Lord. That's
[1:39:12] what we want, Lord. We need you, Father.
[1:39:15] Think of our pastor overseas, Lord. May
[1:39:17] your spirit be with him, the brothers
[1:39:19] traveling with him. May they be blessed.
[1:39:21] May they be a blessing, Lord.
[1:39:24] We pray that you'll bless your people
[1:39:26] over there, Poland, Ukraine. Lord, give
[1:39:29] them traveling mercies, Lord. Satan's
[1:39:32] going to be coming against them, Lord.
[1:39:35] And we just pray, Father, that you would
[1:39:36] uh protect them,
[1:39:38] Lord. May there be such a love. May
[1:39:40] there that life be manifested in them in
[1:39:42] such a way Lord that those wayward
[1:39:45] children of yours Lord would see take
[1:39:48] courage Lord come to a revelation of who
[1:39:51] they are what their position is Lord get
[1:39:54] in that position be satisfied with it
[1:39:56] Lord help us Lord to be satisfied and
[1:39:59] just abide there Lord not to pull the
[1:40:02] other guys get in the other guy's
[1:40:04] position
[1:40:05] Lord not to try to put oursel forward or
[1:40:07] vaunt oursel or get puffed up Lord Lord,
[1:40:11] uh help us to be like that dog,
[1:40:14] Lord, that
[1:40:16] just takes the abuse, not offended,
[1:40:20] Lord, and uh and there to protect the
[1:40:23] one that's abusing him when when it's
[1:40:25] all said and done, Lord. We thank you
[1:40:27] for these simple examples, Lord. And uh
[1:40:30] if I'm a simpleton, Lord, and that's
[1:40:32] what you've made me, then I rejoice in
[1:40:34] it, Father, and I want to remain right
[1:40:37] there. And you get the honor and glory
[1:40:39] from it. We ask you, Lord, to bless us
[1:40:42] now as we go, as we commit ourselves to
[1:40:44] you in Jesus name.
[1:40:48] Amen. Go ahead.
[1:40:51] Oh, I am the bride that you're returning
[1:40:57] for. Dressed in garments white and
[1:41:04] wrinklefree. I have no worthy love that

[1:41:54] covenant.

[1:42:00] not done.
[1:42:04] And someday when I see you standing face
[1:42:09] to
[1:42:10] face, my praise for you will only have
[1:42:15] begun.
