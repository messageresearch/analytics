[3:44] amen god bless you this evening
[3:46] amen let's just bow our heads and
[3:49] pray lord jesus we thank you for the
[3:51] privilege of gathering again
[3:54] god each time is a special time lord
[3:57] may we just focus our attention on you
[4:00] lord
[4:01] no matter what we've been through today
[4:03] and this week and what's going on
[4:05] god may we be able to divert ourselves
[4:08] from the distractions that are in the
[4:09] world
[4:10] and focus our time and attention and our
[4:13] minds on you lord
[4:15] god may you just peel back the pages of
[4:17] your word and reveal yourself to us
[4:20] give us that fresh portion of manna for
[4:22] today
[4:23] may it sustain us lord maybe grow
[4:25] thereby may we be encouraged and edified
[4:29] lord may you set us on our right path
[4:32] lord we pray you take preeminence all
[4:33] that's said are done for we thank you
[4:35] lord for this opportunity that we have
[4:37] to commune with you prayed you would
[4:39] bless it now in jesus christ's name
[4:42] amen
[4:44] and god bless you while we're standing
[4:45] let's take our bibles and you will turn
[4:47] with me to john chapter six
[4:50] i'll let you know that i spoke with
[4:52] brother jim rast today just a little bit
[4:54] ago and he's back home
[4:56] the doctor said the surgery went well
[4:58] and he's got to start therapy and rehab
[5:00] and all of that so pray for him that
[5:02] it'll all go quickly and go smoothly for
[5:04] him he's in quite a bit of pain but just
[5:07] pray for him but the gym is super tough
[5:10] and so he'll be all right but just pray
[5:12] that it all goes quickly and smoothly
[5:13] for him also i want to let you know that
[5:16] i talked with brother levi yoder and he
[5:18] wanted to share a testimony
[5:20] he had a driver driving here
[5:23] um some time ago i don't know i don't
[5:26] remember when several months ago
[5:27] somebody they hired to drive him here
[5:29] for service and that driver sat through
[5:31] service but that driver had gotten the
[5:33] complications with his wife and his
[5:35] name's mr jacobs and they were heading
[5:37] for divorce and and if you remember levi
[5:40] i put in a request one time for him to
[5:42] pray for him and his wife and he wanted
[5:44] to give a testimony back to the church
[5:45] and thank the church for praying that
[5:47] god canceled their divorce and they're
[5:49] working things out and so i thought that
[5:51] was encouraging
[5:53] how many times have the lord done that
[5:54] for us you know for a neighbor or a
[5:56] co-worker or somebody who's helped us
[5:58] out and they ask us to pray and we pray
[6:00] and god moves we don't always hear the
[6:02] outcome but this was encouraging to hear
[6:05] and then god is good
[6:06] and say welcome to our visitors i
[6:08] believe we have a family visiting from
[6:09] montana god bless you it's good to have
[6:11] you here
[6:12] man you're very welcome
[6:14] amen is everybody happy today
[6:17] happy to hear the word of god
[6:19] billions of people are on this planet
[6:22] but god allows us to hear the true word
[6:26] what a privilege that is we should never
[6:28] take it lightly and i'm afraid sometimes
[6:31] we do and i'm guilty of that myself but
[6:32] i want to remind myself this is a
[6:34] privilege amen we're a privileged people
[6:38] let's look at john chapter 6 verse 63
[6:41] together
[6:48] scripture says it is the spirit that
[6:49] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[6:53] the words that i speak unto you they are
[6:55] spirit and they are life
[6:58] amen you can have your seats
[7:00] we ask the lord to bless us as we look
[7:02] into his word
[7:04] amen let's turn over to john chapter 12.
[7:07] just a few chapters over john chapter 12
[7:10] and we'll begin at verse 44.
[7:12] and from this
[7:14] scripture i've drawn my text and i'll
[7:16] give you the title after i read this
[7:19] in john chapter 12 verse 44
[7:23] jesus cried and said he that believeth
[7:25] on me believeth not on me but on him
[7:27] that sent me
[7:28] and he that seeth me seeth him that sent
[7:31] me
[7:32] i am come a light unto the world that
[7:35] whosoever believeth on me should not
[7:38] should not abide in darkness and if any
[7:40] man hear my words and believe not i
[7:42] judge him not for i come not to judge
[7:44] the world but to save the world
[7:46] he that rejecteth me and receiveth not
[7:49] my words hath one that judgeth him the
[7:52] word that i have spoken the same shall
[7:54] judge him in the last day
[7:57] for i have not spoken of myself but the
[8:00] father which sent me he gave me
[8:02] commandment what i should say and what i
[8:05] should speak
[8:06] and i know that his commandment is life
[8:08] everlasting whatsoever i speak therefore
[8:12] even as the father said unto me so i
[8:15] speak
[8:16] so i want to look at these last two
[8:17] verses again but i drew out of there a
[8:19] text for tonight
[8:21] the word in season is life everlasting
[8:25] so think about that the word in season
[8:29] is life everlasting and so look at verse
[8:31] 49 again with this and thought this
[8:33] thought this title in our minds for i
[8:35] have not spoken of myself but the father
[8:38] which sent me he gave me commandment so
[8:40] this is the commandment
[8:42] what i should say
[8:44] and what i should speak
[8:46] so jesus said i'm speaking what the
[8:48] father has commanded me i'm speaking the
[8:51] words that i'm giving you are directed
[8:53] from the father the father is giving the
[8:55] right word for the right season for the
[8:57] right time amen and it's coming forth
[9:00] according to god's purpose and god's
[9:02] decree so that's the commandment that he
[9:04] would only speak what the father spoke
[9:06] he says and i know that this commandment
[9:08] is life everlasting
[9:11] what is life everlasting amen to speak
[9:14] what the father said speak amen that's
[9:16] why i said the word in season is life
[9:18] everlasting because jesus was bringing
[9:20] the word in season amen
[9:23] that's why they rejected him they didn't
[9:25] reject him for the miracles
[9:27] they rejected him for the word and
[9:29] season amen when he says i am the son of
[9:32] god the father and i are one amen they
[9:34] begin to reject him when he began to try
[9:36] to turn them away from their traditional
[9:38] understanding and bring them to present
[9:40] truth they began to reject him they did
[9:42] not reject him for the miracles they did
[9:44] not reject him for reading moses amen
[9:47] they rejected him for the god giving him
[9:49] a commandment to only speak present
[9:52] tense truth and when he spoke by
[9:54] commandment of god he said this
[9:55] commandment is life everlasting
[9:58] amen so the word in season is life
[10:01] everlasting
[10:03] when the god
[10:04] commissions and commands a word to be
[10:06] spoken
[10:08] and that vessel he commissions and
[10:09] commands to speak that word and that
[10:12] word is the father's word for the the
[10:14] season and the time
[10:15] that commandment is life everlasting
[10:20] brother branham says in the message
[10:21] future home said what if moses would
[10:23] have come with noah's message and noah
[10:25] was part of it but it wouldn't have
[10:28] worked
[10:29] if jesus would have come with moses
[10:31] message it wouldn't have worked if jesus
[10:34] had come with the signs and the miracles
[10:36] and moses's message they would have
[10:38] never rejected him
[10:41] but they rejected him because of the
[10:42] message he brought
[10:44] not because of the miracles he worked
[10:48] if jesus would have come with moses
[10:50] message it wouldn't have worked it was a
[10:52] different age it was a different
[10:54] prophecy a different part of the word
[10:56] had to be fulfilled there
[10:58] they was in another day of the week not
[11:00] tuesday's work can't be done on
[11:01] wednesday and wednesday has got to be
[11:03] done on wednesday see saturday has to be
[11:05] saturday's work see
[11:07] and they was they was recognized oh
[11:09] moses we have moses he said if you'd
[11:12] have known moses you would have known me
[11:14] for he was the one that spoke of me the
[11:16] lord your god shall raise a prophet like
[11:18] an unto me get the idea oh my then jesus
[11:21] said in john 14 when he the holy ghost
[11:24] is come he will bring these things to
[11:26] your memory see show you what day you're
[11:29] living in
[11:30] what is the holy ghost going to do show
[11:32] you what day you're living in amen
[11:35] that that's what that's what brother ben
[11:37] is telling us here when the holy ghost
[11:39] come he will bring these things to your
[11:40] memory see show you what day you're
[11:42] living in and then another thing you'll
[11:45] know him by he'll show you things to
[11:47] come see right back to the prophetic
[11:50] again when he's come
[11:53] so the holy ghost will show you what day
[11:55] you're living in the holy ghost won't
[11:57] point you backwards but it'll show you
[12:00] where you're at and what's coming amen
[12:03] and the invisible union says the word
[12:06] that fell on the day of pentecost will
[12:08] not work this day no sir
[12:11] that was for pentecost this is for the
[12:13] bride going home of the bride
[12:15] we got something different the
[12:17] pentecostals represented that again
[12:19] we're in the bright age no more than the
[12:21] word of noah would work in the days of
[12:23] moses no more than moses law would have
[12:26] worked in the time of paul here
[12:28] so brother venom is making it very clear
[12:30] that the the age we're in is the bride
[12:33] age and it takes the word for the bride
[12:35] age amen that's the only word that will
[12:38] work and that is what the father has
[12:39] commanded to be spoken in the end time
[12:42] and he used the prophet at the end time
[12:44] to bring the father's word amen brother
[12:46] branham didn't conjure up the message he
[12:48] didn't invent the message he didn't he
[12:50] didn't speak of his own idea god
[12:52] supernaturally called him called him out
[12:55] amen he was born under a sign born under
[12:57] a special birth amen there was an angel
[12:59] that appeared at his birth as a dove all
[13:01] of these things came together amen to
[13:04] signify that this is a chosen vessel he
[13:07] did not choose himself god chose him
[13:11] and god commissioned him and commanded
[13:13] him what to speak amen and he spoke the
[13:16] message of the hour which was the word
[13:19] in season amen
[13:22] and that season that he was to bring the
[13:23] bride to was the bride age so he brought
[13:26] a bright age message for a bright age
[13:28] season
[13:30] and that word
[13:32] that commanded by the father to speak
[13:34] is life everlasting
[13:41] amen
[13:42] let's look at john chapter 6 again go
[13:44] back with me to john chapter 6.
[13:49] we'll pick this up in
[13:52] verse 67 just a little further down from
[13:54] where we were reading
[13:56] john 6 67
[13:58] then said jesus unto the twelve will you
[14:01] also go away
[14:03] then simon peter answered him
[14:05] then simon peter answered him lord to
[14:07] whom shall we go thou hast the words of
[14:09] eternal life
[14:11] and we believe and are sure that thou
[14:12] art the christ the son of the living god
[14:16] so
[14:17] peter looks at jesus
[14:20] and jesus you know there's a there's a
[14:22] great falling away jesus is saying
[14:24] things that they don't understand
[14:25] they're rejecting and falling away he
[14:27] turns to the disciples he said well you
[14:29] go also and he said to whom shall we go
[14:32] thou
[14:33] hast the words of eternal life
[14:36] peter is looking at a man that's
[14:38] standing before him and that man is the
[14:40] chosen vessel of god the son of god with
[14:43] the word that god commanded him to speak
[14:45] for that season and he says thou hast
[14:47] the words of eternal life when he sees
[14:49] that statement you have to ask yourself
[14:51] well what about moses
[14:53] what about isaiah what about the torah
[14:56] what about all the scrolls see peter
[14:58] wasn't denying moses he wasn't denying
[15:00] isaiah he wasn't denying anything that
[15:03] happened before all of that was building
[15:05] to this amen moses was speaking of this
[15:08] day isaiah was speaking of this day it
[15:10] was all speaking of the day and the hour
[15:12] that we were in but peter had a capacity
[15:15] something down on the inside could look
[15:17] at this man this physical man standing
[15:19] before him and say thou hast the words
[15:22] of eternal life
[15:25] you know can you imagine a pharisee
[15:27] standing beside him and saying ah you
[15:29] didn't even read that out of the torah
[15:32] you were you weren't saying moses you
[15:34] weren't saying isaiah you weren't saying
[15:36] you were looking at this vessel and you
[15:38] were saying thou hast the words of
[15:39] eternal life
[15:42] but it was every bit the truth
[15:45] and to reject
[15:47] what what jesus christ was speaking in
[15:49] that day was to reject eternal life
[15:53] so
[15:54] in no way was peter
[15:57] diminishing moses's ministry
[16:00] moses played his part to bring him to
[16:03] the day where christ would appear in
[16:05] flesh
[16:07] everything was building upon another
[16:09] upon another upon another building
[16:12] through the old testament building
[16:13] through the patriarchs and through the
[16:14] prophets and the psalms building all the
[16:17] way up until the capping off the
[16:19] culmination of it all was jesus christ
[16:22] the son of god made in the flesh
[16:24] standing there before them
[16:26] and he was given the message he was
[16:28] given the commandment of the father what
[16:30] he should speak and when he spoke that
[16:31] he knows that that commandment is life
[16:33] everlasting and peter was picking up on
[16:35] it and says thou hast the words you you
[16:38] have the words of eternal life
[16:41] and so there was no diminishing
[16:43] of a previous prophet
[16:46] the previous prophet was pointing to
[16:47] this dispensation
[16:50] that's why when we come to the end time
[16:52] there's no diminishing of any church age
[16:56] there's no diminishing of any previous
[16:58] messenger
[16:59] because they were all building to this
[17:02] they were all building back to a bride
[17:04] that would reflect perfectly reflect the
[17:07] word that would be married to jesus
[17:09] christ perfectly reflecting the nature
[17:11] the character the word to be manifested
[17:14] in flesh and a body of believers that
[17:16] was to be the completed body of jesus
[17:18] christ paul was pointing to this paul
[17:20] was saying you know my little children
[17:22] who might travail and
[17:24] birth again until christ be formed in
[17:26] you his desire was christ was reformed
[17:28] in you he was saying i have espoused you
[17:30] to one even to christ amen so now when
[17:32] brother branham comes and you can look
[17:34] at that vessel that prophet and say he
[17:36] has the words of eternal life not
[17:38] because he invented the words of eternal
[17:40] life but because god told him what to
[17:42] speak and what the message was for the
[17:44] hour but it was certainly no diminishing
[17:47] of paul it was the capping off of a
[17:49] foundation that paul had laid
[17:54] and that men had built upon
[17:57] so it was no change it was nothing
[17:59] different it was it was the culmination
[18:01] of the fulfillment
[18:03] so to give respect
[18:06] unto the vessel that god chose and to
[18:08] recognize
[18:09] your message and its day
[18:12] is in no way disrespect to any previous
[18:15] age it is the greatest respect you can
[18:17] pay to every previous age
[18:20] it is no disrespect to
[18:23] to paul or anybody else that's gone
[18:25] before it is the greatest respect that
[18:27] we can pay is to believe that all of
[18:30] that as it culminates and all the truth
[18:32] that build up builds all the way up to
[18:34] the message that god has given us and to
[18:36] receive that is to receive the truth
[18:38] that they were preaching as well
[18:42] but we know
[18:44] that the words that the father has
[18:46] commanded to be spoken
[18:48] is life everlasting
[18:50] let's look at acts chapter 13.
[18:59] acts chapter 13
[19:02] and verse 46.
[19:10] all right acts 13 and 46 when paul and
[19:12] barnabas waxed bold and said
[19:15] it was necessary that the word of god
[19:17] should first have been spoken to you now
[19:19] i want you to remember paul is a chosen
[19:22] vessel
[19:24] the lord told
[19:26] ananias when ananias was sent to pray
[19:28] for paul he said he is a chosen vessel
[19:31] unto me
[19:33] he was prophesied of in the old
[19:35] testament as one that would and be a
[19:37] light unto the gentiles he was uh he was
[19:40] so he was prophesied to come amen god
[19:42] told ananias that that he's going he's a
[19:45] chosen vessel for me he'll suffer for my
[19:48] name's sake and he was to to bear the
[19:50] message the message of christ he was to
[19:54] take the gospel to the gentiles he was
[19:56] commanded the lord he was given
[19:58] instruction of christ himself and he was
[20:00] taken
[20:01] to the gentiles
[20:03] so when he says that the word of god
[20:05] should first have been spoken unto you
[20:08] paul is a chosen vessel called by god
[20:10] not called by paul
[20:13] and he was commanded he was given the
[20:16] revelation of the message he was told
[20:18] what to speak and when he was speaking
[20:20] that was the commandment of god now he
[20:22] says
[20:23] it was necessary that the word of god
[20:25] should have been spoken to you but
[20:27] seeing you put it from you and judge
[20:29] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[20:32] lo we turn to the gentiles
[20:35] for so hat the lord commanded us saying
[20:37] i have set thee to be a light of the
[20:38] gentiles that thou should just be for
[20:40] salvation to the ends of the earth
[20:43] and when the gentiles heard this they
[20:45] were glad and glorified the word of the
[20:46] lord and as many as were ordained to
[20:49] eternal life believed amen who believed
[20:52] the ones that were ordained to eternal
[20:54] life what did they believe the message
[20:56] that paul and barnabas was carrying to
[20:58] them because paul was a chosen vessel to
[21:00] bring the word as commanded by the
[21:02] father amen and when he brought that
[21:04] word when that word was rejected he's
[21:06] saying seeing that you that you you
[21:08] count yourselves unworthy of everlasting
[21:11] life paul was equating his message to
[21:14] everlasting life
[21:17] what what a statement to make when paul
[21:21] comes and he begins to preach now listen
[21:23] he's preaching in a synagogue in this
[21:25] synagogue they've had the readings of
[21:27] moses and the reasonings isaiah and
[21:28] ezekiel and jeremiah they've been going
[21:31] through the psalms all of their lives
[21:33] they've been hearing this preach and
[21:35] here comes a man preaching something
[21:37] they've never heard before
[21:39] and preaching in a way they've never
[21:42] heard before in taking their bible
[21:44] and doing things with the scripture that
[21:46] they have never seen done with the
[21:47] scriptures before
[21:49] we have to put ourselves in that day
[21:51] paul comes as a chosen vessel commanded
[21:53] to the lord what to say he's got the
[21:56] message of the hour the present tense
[21:58] truth amen and he was sent for salvation
[22:01] to the ends of the world he was sent for
[22:03] salvation he had the message of
[22:05] salvation amen and when that message
[22:07] that he preached amen
[22:09] listen we say how could they deny paul
[22:11] amen in paul's day
[22:15] it was easy to deny paul
[22:19] the only reason that it's that we would
[22:21] say that is because paul has become
[22:23] accepted amen as a as the writer of the
[22:26] new testament the main writer of the new
[22:28] testament and all christendom has
[22:30] accepted this so paul is revered and put
[22:32] on a pedestal in paul's day it wasn't
[22:35] that way
[22:37] in paul's day he was feared and despised
[22:40] by the early christian church because of
[22:42] his persecution of the church and he was
[22:44] loved by his countrymen then when god
[22:46] converted him he was turned amen unto
[22:48] the gentiles and turned to the
[22:50] christians and they didn't all receive
[22:52] him and accept him immediately they
[22:54] still were suspicious of him and all his
[22:56] countrymen now hated him
[23:02] amen
[23:03] and he wasn't accepted by all the
[23:05] believers
[23:07] he wasn't accepted by all those who had
[23:09] joined the faith in fact after several
[23:11] years of ministry there were those that
[23:13] were going down
[23:14] going around and and contesting paul's
[23:16] teaching and contesting his authority as
[23:18] an apostle
[23:20] so here he comes preaching something
[23:22] they've never heard in a way they've
[23:23] never heard and doing things with
[23:25] scriptures they've never seen another
[23:26] man do with the scriptures
[23:29] and you could see our jew would be easy
[23:33] to question what paul was saying it
[23:36] would be easy to reject all your life
[23:38] you've been the chosen the chosen ones
[23:41] the chosen people of god this is all the
[23:43] word of god and now he's coming and yes
[23:46] he's using scriptures but he's doing it
[23:47] in such an odd way
[23:51] but when they begin to reject paul
[23:55] they stayed with their torah
[24:00] when they rejected paul they didn't tear
[24:03] up the writings of moses and throw them
[24:05] on the ground
[24:08] they still had their same scrolls they
[24:10] came to church with that day
[24:12] and they carried them back home and
[24:13] still read them that night for devotions
[24:18] but paul
[24:19] had the truth of what was buried in
[24:22] those scrolls
[24:24] had been revealed to him by the lord and
[24:26] now he was bringing the truth the
[24:28] illumination on those scrolls he had the
[24:31] light of that day that would illuminate
[24:33] the word that they had been reading for
[24:35] generations to show them the true
[24:36] meaning of that scripture but they
[24:38] wanted to stay with the old
[24:40] understanding of that scripture they
[24:42] rejected paul and paul says when you did
[24:44] that amen you have you have deemed
[24:47] yourself unworthy of everlasting life
[24:52] that's why i i use this title
[24:55] i that the title that i used
[24:59] the word in season
[25:01] is life everlasting
[25:04] see
[25:05] we have to understand
[25:07] this message that we have friends
[25:10] it is not a better idea on the word or
[25:13] the correct teaching on the word amen
[25:15] this is life everlasting
[25:18] this is christ himself amen this is the
[25:21] word the message of the hour the word
[25:24] that is in season the very life of
[25:26] christ amen manifested in the present
[25:29] day truth amen it is not just another
[25:31] idea that you can take or not take not a
[25:34] better way but your way still okay but
[25:36] this is a little better way friends this
[25:38] is the way for this day
[25:40] this is the message of everlasting life
[25:43] amen and to reject this amen is to
[25:46] reject life everlasting
[25:50] amen just because it's been hundreds or
[25:53] thousands of years since these things
[25:55] took place in the bible doesn't mean
[25:57] anything's different
[25:58] it's all the same
[26:01] in the message god's only provided place
[26:03] of worship
[26:04] brother bam says the name is in the word
[26:08] we've talked about this before but just
[26:10] pay close attention for a few minutes
[26:12] the name is in the word he's talking
[26:14] about the name of the lord the name is
[26:16] in the word
[26:18] and see
[26:19] we live in a society where the name of
[26:22] jesus is thrown out all the time by
[26:24] multitudes of people and it's referred
[26:27] to i mean they got the name right jesus
[26:30] christ they got the title right lord
[26:32] jesus christ amen brother branham said
[26:35] you can't just have his name by having a
[26:37] pronunciation of words
[26:40] you can't have a correct spelling and a
[26:42] correct pronunciate pronunciation that's
[26:45] not having his name and because he said
[26:47] his name is in the word
[26:52] and the name is in the word because he
[26:54] is the word
[26:56] what is he then
[26:58] the word interpreted is the
[27:00] manifestation of the name of god
[27:04] and what we have is the word interpreted
[27:06] so we have his name amen so so there's
[27:09] there's the name of jesus is being
[27:11] thrown out all the time it's being
[27:13] thrown out by cr uh those who claim to
[27:16] be christians
[27:17] like i said billions the world over amen
[27:20] but it doesn't mean that they really
[27:22] have his name they have words that they
[27:25] string together and pronounce but that
[27:27] doesn't mean they have his name and just
[27:28] because they say those words god is not
[27:30] obligated to them because they can make
[27:32] a sound over their vocal cords and they
[27:34] can say a name that they recognize to be
[27:37] biblical that is god is not obligated to
[27:40] that
[27:43] but god has attached himself to his word
[27:45] god has obligated himself to his word
[27:51] amen the word interpreted is the
[27:53] manifestation of the name of god
[27:56] no wonder flesh and blood has not
[27:58] revealed this to you but my father which
[27:59] is in heaven has revealed this to you
[28:02] who i am
[28:04] who is he the word interpreted
[28:08] who is he the word interpreted
[28:10] but i thought he was jesus christ yes
[28:12] jesus christ is the word interpreted
[28:14] because jesus christ is the word amen
[28:17] that's all the way back to john 1 1 in
[28:18] the beginning was the word and the word
[28:20] was with god and the word was god amen
[28:23] and later the word was made flesh and
[28:24] dwelt among us jesus christ is the word
[28:27] amen and the word interpreted is a
[28:29] manifestation of the name
[28:32] and flesh and blood has not revealed
[28:34] this to you but my father which is in
[28:36] heaven has revealed this to you who i
[28:38] am
[28:42] and upon this rock i'll build my place
[28:45] of worship and the gates of hell can't
[28:46] shake it down amen old loving a living
[28:49] church of god stand firm
[28:51] firm foundation on
[28:53] jesus christ alone you can sing the song
[28:55] but if you're not on christ the word
[28:57] you're on teetering faltering sand
[29:00] but upon this rock christ the word
[29:04] that's what the church is built upon
[29:06] upon the revelation of jesus christ
[29:09] and the pergamy in church he says now
[29:11] jesus knew that there was going to be a
[29:13] terrible drift away from the word in the
[29:15] pergamian age which was as yet 200 years
[29:19] off from
[29:20] the patmos vision
[29:22] he knew that drift would cause him to go
[29:24] into the dark ages he knew that the
[29:27] he knew that the way man originally got
[29:29] away from god was by first leaving the
[29:31] word
[29:32] if you leave that word you have left god
[29:38] and you can say
[29:39] any name you want
[29:42] but if you leave the word you've left
[29:43] god
[29:45] that's why
[29:47] amen to have god you must receive his
[29:49] word amen
[29:51] and to leave the word you leave god to
[29:53] reject the word you reject god that's
[29:56] what jesus was saying if you reject me
[29:59] you reject him that sent me
[30:02] so he says if you leave that word you
[30:05] have left god
[30:06] thus he is presenting himself to the
[30:08] church at pergamus and indeed to all
[30:10] churches of all ages i am the word if
[30:12] you want deity in your midst then
[30:15] welcome and receive the word oh this is
[30:18] so simple this is so basic but we can
[30:20] never get away from this friend if you
[30:22] want deity in your midst amen then you
[30:25] welcome you can we can want an
[30:27] outpouring of the spirit we can want the
[30:28] life of god the life of jesus christ to
[30:31] be with us so much we can try all kinds
[30:33] of activities and all kinds of prayer
[30:35] meetings and all kinds of super duper
[30:37] this but if you want deity in your midst
[30:39] stay with the word receive the word
[30:41] accept the word the present tense word
[30:44] that has been revealed and brought to us
[30:46] in this day not the previous age word
[30:48] but this age word receive that to have
[30:51] deity in your midst
[30:56] if you he said i am the word if you want
[30:58] deity in your midst and welcome and
[30:59] receive the word don't ever let anyone
[31:01] or anything get between you and that
[31:03] word
[31:05] this which i am giving you the word is a
[31:07] revelation of myself
[31:10] i am the word remember that amen
[31:14] and then listen to what the prophet of
[31:15] god says next he says
[31:17] i wonder
[31:18] if we are sufficiently impressed with
[31:20] the word in our midst
[31:23] that's one thing that's one statement i
[31:25] want to be a take away statement from
[31:27] today if we can have one i wonder if we
[31:30] are sufficiently impressed with the word
[31:32] in our midst amen what was restored to
[31:35] us the word amen what was taken from the
[31:37] church the word what was restored to the
[31:39] church the word amen with the word comes
[31:42] the life with the life comes the power
[31:45] everything we need amen everything that
[31:47] we're meant to have comes by the word
[31:53] god created everything by the word
[31:55] everything for god came by the word
[31:58] everything that come into manifestation
[32:00] from his thought come by the word
[32:01] everything amen that he desired to
[32:05] manifest his thinking came by the word
[32:08] and is an expression of the word so
[32:10] everything is based off the word
[32:14] and the word
[32:16] comes from the thought
[32:19] and the thought is the essence character
[32:22] nature person of god
[32:24] so you can see why to reject the word is
[32:27] to reject god because the word is an
[32:29] outcropping of god because it's the
[32:32] the word is the thought expressed and
[32:35] the thought is the very person of god
[32:38] it is his essence it is who he is and so
[32:41] to reject the word is to reject him
[32:45] but what does it mean then to receive
[32:47] the word
[32:49] we receive him
[32:51] now go back to the statement and
[32:52] continue on he says i wonder if we are
[32:55] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[32:57] our midst
[32:58] i don't think we can ever be
[33:00] sufficiently impressed enough
[33:03] so let me give you a thought here how do
[33:05] we pray we pray in jesus name don't we
[33:08] he's going to give us a super
[33:09] interesting thought here he says now how
[33:11] do we pray we pray in jesus name and so
[33:13] we've done this since we were little
[33:14] kids if we were raised as christians and
[33:16] lord bless my food in jesus name lord do
[33:18] this in jesus name and if we're not
[33:20] careful amen it becomes uh i don't want
[33:23] to say anything wrong but it becomes a
[33:25] formula
[33:27] almost like a a just a statement at the
[33:31] end of a sentence just to finish it up
[33:35] but but this isn't what he's going to
[33:36] say
[33:38] how do we pray we pray in jesus name
[33:40] don't we every prayer is in his name or
[33:42] there isn't any answer
[33:45] yet in first john 5 14 we are told this
[33:48] is the confidence that we have in him
[33:50] that if we ask anything according to his
[33:52] will he heareth us
[33:54] and if we know that he hears us
[33:57] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[33:59] the petition that we desire of him
[34:02] now we ask what is the will of god there
[34:05] is only one way to know his will and
[34:08] that is by the word of god
[34:10] so we ask according to his will we've
[34:13] asked according to the word and we've
[34:15] asked in his name
[34:18] it's not just the period at the end of
[34:21] the prayer in jesus name
[34:24] it's not just a statement we learn to
[34:26] make as a child but when we pray
[34:29] according to his will we've prayed
[34:31] according to the revelation of his word
[34:33] when we prayed according to the
[34:35] revelation of his word we have prayed in
[34:37] his name
[34:40] that's why we can ask for all kinds of
[34:42] prayers but those prayers are not
[34:44] according to his word
[34:46] and they're not in line with the
[34:47] revelation of his word and we can end
[34:49] them within jesus name in jesus name in
[34:52] jesus name but we're not praying in his
[34:54] name because we're not praying according
[34:56] to the revelation of the word
[34:58] so you say i asked for that in jesus
[35:00] name you didn't ask for it in jesus name
[35:02] you made a statement a traditional
[35:04] statement at the end of your request but
[35:06] your request wasn't in his name because
[35:08] your request wasn't according to his
[35:09] word amen
[35:13] i hope that makes sense
[35:15] so that's why
[35:16] i wonder if we are sufficiently
[35:18] impressed with the word in our midst
[35:20] amen we can pray
[35:22] in his name because he has given his
[35:25] will to us in the message
[35:27] we know
[35:28] amen we know what he once done with his
[35:31] word we know his word the word has been
[35:33] restored to us all that's been lost amen
[35:36] down to the church ages has been
[35:37] restored we have the perfect
[35:39] interpretation of the word with divine
[35:40] vindication the word has been given back
[35:43] to us when the word came back he came
[35:45] back his presence came back his name is
[35:47] attached to his word we have his name we
[35:50] have his presence we have his mind we
[35:52] have his will and when we pray according
[35:55] to the revelation of this that this
[35:56] message has restored then we bask in his
[35:59] name and he does it according to his
[36:02] will
[36:06] so
[36:07] don't
[36:08] you're not wrong with ending your prayer
[36:10] in the name of jesus
[36:12] there's nothing wrong with that we do
[36:13] everything in his name brother branham
[36:14] prayed that way
[36:16] but we have to make sure that we're
[36:18] praying according to his word if we're
[36:20] going to invoke his name
[36:27] so let's continue on with this quote in
[36:29] the pergament church age
[36:31] what is the will of god there is only
[36:32] one way to know his will and that is by
[36:35] the word of god
[36:38] lamentation 337 says who is he
[36:41] that saith it
[36:42] who
[36:43] who is he that sayeth and it cometh to
[36:45] pass when the lord commandeth it not
[36:48] there it is
[36:49] if it isn't in the word you can't have
[36:52] it
[36:54] so we can't ask unless it's in the word
[36:57] and we can't petition or ask unless it's
[36:59] in his name
[37:00] there it is again
[37:02] jesus the name
[37:04] is the word
[37:05] the will
[37:07] you can't separate god in his word they
[37:09] are one
[37:13] so how can you ask for something in
[37:15] jesus name that's not according to
[37:17] his will
[37:18] and his will is his word
[37:20] and his word has been restored
[37:25] i hope that helps you understand what
[37:27] i'm trying to say is we're not getting
[37:29] anywhere without the revelation of this
[37:31] hour
[37:34] no matter what we say or what we think
[37:36] without this restored word we're not
[37:38] getting anywhere
[37:40] this word that has been restored through
[37:42] a vessel
[37:44] it is life everlasting
[37:50] in the fourth seal
[37:52] brother ben is going to
[37:54] reference revelation 19 if we could turn
[37:56] there together revelation 19.
[38:08] in verse 1.
[38:15] i'm sorry
[38:18] verse 11
[38:19] revelation 19 and 11
[38:22] and i saw heaven open and behold a white
[38:24] horse
[38:25] and he that sat upon him was called
[38:27] faithful and true and in righteousness
[38:30] he the judge and make war his eyes were
[38:32] as a flame of fire and on his head were
[38:34] many crowns and he had a name written
[38:36] that no man knew but he himself and he
[38:39] was clothed with a vesture dipped in
[38:40] blood and his name is called the word of
[38:43] god
[38:44] and the armies which were in heaven
[38:45] followed him upon white horses clothed
[38:47] in fine linen white and clean and out of
[38:50] his mouth go with a sharp sword that
[38:52] with it he should smite the nations and
[38:54] he should rule them with a rod of iron
[38:56] and he treadeth the winepress of the
[38:58] fierceness of the wrath of almighty god
[39:00] and he hath on his vesture and on his
[39:02] thigh a name written king of kings and
[39:04] lord of lords
[39:06] so
[39:07] here in revelation 19
[39:10] brother brahman the fourth seal is
[39:11] contrasting christ on the white horse
[39:14] versus the pale horse rider and the
[39:16] fourth seal amen and the pale horse
[39:19] rider we know is is named death
[39:21] and it's riding on a mixed colored horse
[39:24] of creeds and denominations and
[39:26] doctrines and all of that from the
[39:28] previous uh four seals or previous three
[39:31] seals and he's death but now he's
[39:33] contrasting it with christ coming on the
[39:36] white horse and his name is called the
[39:38] word of god but i want to read how
[39:40] brother branham describes this
[39:42] now in revelation 19 not only is he
[39:44] getting ready but christ is getting
[39:46] ready to meet him
[39:48] the battle is going to be hot and heavy
[39:50] christ in revelation 19 christ is
[39:52] gathering his not from the four corners
[39:54] of the earth because there's going to be
[39:56] a little bitty remnant what's he doing
[39:58] he's gathering them from the four
[39:59] corners of heaven we'll get them souls
[40:01] under the altar tomorrow night and
[40:03] you'll see whether it's right or not
[40:04] four corners of heaven on a snow white
[40:06] horse he is also has a name not death
[40:10] but the word of god
[40:12] life
[40:13] now brother brahm's doing something now
[40:15] you know the scripture says his name is
[40:17] called the the word of god and brother
[40:20] branham now is equating that to life
[40:23] his name
[40:24] his name is not death but the word of
[40:26] god life he's contrasting him with the
[40:29] horse rider of death
[40:31] on the pale horse now here comes the
[40:33] word of god amen his name is called the
[40:36] word of god riding on a white horse and
[40:38] he's going to call him life because the
[40:40] word of god is life
[40:42] you said the word that i speak unto you
[40:43] they are spirit and they are life amen
[40:46] the commandment is the commandment of
[40:48] everlasting life what was the
[40:49] commandment to speak what the father
[40:50] said speak now he's contrasting the word
[40:53] of god life with death
[40:57] god he's got it wrote right on his thigh
[41:00] there the word of god that's the only
[41:02] life because god is the only source of
[41:04] eternal life there is zoe is that right
[41:07] and he's got wrote life now brother
[41:09] brown says he's got wrote life
[41:14] the bible says he's called the word of
[41:16] god but god's brother bam saying he's
[41:18] life that's his title life amen
[41:23] he's got wrote life riding on a white
[41:25] horse and here's a man with three
[41:26] different powers mixed up called death
[41:28] gathering his earthbound delegates and
[41:30] christ is gathering his heaven-born
[41:32] subjects that's me a heaven-born subject
[41:35] amen
[41:36] are you being gathered
[41:37] amen
[41:39] he's got death wrote on him christ got
[41:42] life wrote on him those with him are on
[41:45] white horses also and they are called
[41:47] the chosen before the foundation of the
[41:49] world amen they are faithful to the word
[41:52] amen he goes woo i like that one called
[41:55] chosen before the foundation of the
[41:57] world and then faithful to the word by
[41:59] their
[42:00] choosing all stimulated with new wine
[42:03] and oil just riding right along
[42:06] coming down to meet him they know the
[42:08] thunders will issue the thing course
[42:09] pretty soon see
[42:11] watch how does he do so if he is the
[42:14] word
[42:15] and his name is the word
[42:17] then the word is life
[42:20] amen it's so easy how a prophet just he
[42:23] just begins to draw equal signs here and
[42:26] makes it so easy if he is the word
[42:29] and his name is the word
[42:31] then the word is life amen
[42:34] so how could you take his name
[42:36] and separate it from the word
[42:39] his name is in the word the
[42:41] manifestation of his name the
[42:43] manifestation of the word is the
[42:45] revealing of his name
[42:47] so if he is the word and his name is the
[42:49] word then the word is life
[42:52] and the antichrist anything anti is
[42:54] against
[42:56] so anti is against christ the word so
[42:58] it's got to be a creed or denomination
[43:00] which is against the word so now he's
[43:02] saying this antichrist is is death and
[43:06] it's anything against the word so the
[43:08] word is life anything against the word
[43:11] is death
[43:14] amen
[43:15] it's that easy
[43:17] let's go to first john
[43:20] first john chapter 5.
[43:31] first john chapter 5 verse 10
[43:34] he that believeth on the son of god
[43:37] hath the witness in himself he that
[43:39] believeth not god hath made him a liar
[43:41] because he believeth not the record that
[43:43] god gave of his son
[43:46] listen to that statement
[43:50] he that believeth not god has made him a
[43:53] liar
[43:57] god himself
[44:00] has sent us a prophet in this day
[44:04] god himself sent a prophet and god
[44:07] himself restored the word
[44:10] and if you don't believe that
[44:12] you make him a liar
[44:19] he that believeth on the son of god had
[44:20] this witness in himself that he
[44:22] believeth but he that believeth not god
[44:24] hath made him a liar because he
[44:26] believeth not the record that god gave
[44:28] of his son
[44:29] we've had a restoration of the son of
[44:31] man ministry
[44:33] in our day and god sent it and god did
[44:35] it and god confirmed his word
[44:37] and to reject that is to reject god
[44:42] and this is the record that god has
[44:43] given to us eternal life
[44:46] and this life is in his son
[44:50] he that hath the he that hath the son
[44:53] hath life
[44:55] and he that hath not the son of god hath
[44:58] not life
[45:00] how do you get the son without the word
[45:05] brother man says
[45:07] in the message there is a man here that
[45:09] can turn on the line
[45:10] life is only by the word of god made
[45:13] manifest
[45:14] it's another fantastic statement from
[45:16] december 1963 so hang on to this
[45:20] life is only by the word of god made
[45:23] manifest
[45:26] so
[45:27] and he repeats it again
[45:29] life comes only by the word of god made
[45:32] manifest
[45:34] we can look back what was done but if
[45:37] that doesn't bring it up to date and we
[45:39] don't receive the word today amen life
[45:42] life comes only by the word of god made
[45:45] manifest those disciples could not come
[45:48] to life until they received the word
[45:50] made manifest amen and paul the apostle
[45:52] was trying to bring light and life amen
[45:55] to the to the church he brought them to
[45:57] the synagogue amen there was greeks
[45:59] mixed in there and gentiles and there
[46:02] was jews and he was trying to bring them
[46:04] life but when they rejected the word
[46:06] that he was bringing they rejected the
[46:08] message that he had the gospel he was
[46:10] preaching he says you count yourself
[46:12] unworthy of everlasting life
[46:16] so life comes only by the word of god
[46:18] made manifest amen
[46:21] so nobody
[46:23] nobody could tell those jews in that
[46:25] synagogue that day that had the scrolls
[46:27] tucked under their arm nobody can say
[46:29] you don't have the word of god
[46:32] it's like if somebody's carrying around
[46:33] their bible and they got that bible
[46:35] tucked under their arm amen you're not
[46:37] going to be able to look at them and say
[46:38] you don't have the word of god because
[46:40] we know this is the word of god in print
[46:42] form brother brennan made it so he told
[46:44] i mean he told us it was so
[46:46] you can't look at them jews and say you
[46:47] don't have the word of god but you can
[46:49] say you don't have the word of god made
[46:51] manifest amen you don't have the present
[46:53] tense word you don't have the revelation
[46:55] of the word for today amen and they had
[46:58] the scrolls under their arm amen but
[47:01] they didn't have the word of god made
[47:03] manifest that's what paul was bringing
[47:05] to them and when they rejected that
[47:06] really rejected eternal life
[47:15] and and paul was clear i mean paul
[47:17] didn't
[47:18] he didn't tiptoe around the subject
[47:22] paul was clear so life comes only by the
[47:25] word of god made and manifest
[47:27] as long as it is just in the book like
[47:30] this it still can be questioned but when
[47:32] it's made manifest and you see the
[47:34] product of what it spoke of being
[47:36] manifested then that is light on the
[47:39] word
[47:40] catch what he's teaching us here that is
[47:43] light on the word that's what brings the
[47:44] word said so and then when it comes to
[47:47] past that is life in light
[47:50] light bringing life light brings life
[47:53] amen
[47:55] so when the word is made manifest that
[47:58] becomes the light amen the light of god
[48:00] the light of the hour the word the
[48:02] spoken word amen that's prophesied but
[48:05] when it comes into manifestation that
[48:07] manifested word becomes light amen and
[48:10] that light is the life of men
[48:13] is that right back to john 1
[48:16] that light is the life of men and so now
[48:20] let's keep reading
[48:22] that that is the life and light light
[48:24] brings life light brings life plant the
[48:27] wheat out there and put it in the
[48:29] basement cover it all over and it'll
[48:31] never bring forth anything because it
[48:33] can't there's no light there but as soon
[48:35] as that light strikes it then it'll
[48:37] bring forth life if it's germatized seed
[48:40] that's the same thing it is with the
[48:42] word see the word is god and when the
[48:45] life strikes it it brings the light
[48:47] strikes it it brings the word to life
[48:49] again
[48:50] every age has always been that
[48:53] oh how we appreciate these great things
[48:56] how the word being vindicated is the
[48:59] light of the spoken word and it is the
[49:01] light that brings life to the seed amen
[49:05] you and i if we're children of god and
[49:07] believers amen if we're the seed of god
[49:10] we had a man a seed of life a portion of
[49:13] god down on the inside and there had to
[49:15] be a light so our that wheat seed in us
[49:18] was in the basement
[49:21] no light was shining on it it wasn't
[49:23] springing to life amen but it had to
[49:25] come in contact with light but what
[49:27] light would make this word live amen i i
[49:30] don't know about you but i was raised in
[49:32] the denominational systems and i had a
[49:34] desire for god i had an emotional
[49:36] attraction to god i wanted to serve god
[49:38] i wanted to be a good boy i wanted to go
[49:40] to heaven i wanted all of those things
[49:42] but there was no quickening power in any
[49:45] of it until i come to this message and
[49:47] this message quickened the seed inside
[49:49] of me
[49:50] what was it about this message amen that
[49:52] the pentecostal church couldn't do for
[49:54] me the pentecostal church could stir my
[49:56] emotions amen because there was a seed
[49:59] there amen there was some response
[50:01] brother brown talks about this he said
[50:04] he said you you some of you can agree
[50:06] with me on these things when you were a
[50:08] boy you know how certain things would
[50:09] move you and you would hear certain
[50:10] things and it'll be that little time he
[50:12] said that was that seed down inside
[50:14] there
[50:16] but it could never bring the seed to
[50:17] life even though there's things i would
[50:19] hear there could be a stimulation and
[50:21] maybe a response but there had to be
[50:23] light to bring this seed to life and
[50:26] that light this seed is word the only
[50:28] thing that will bring the word to life
[50:30] is the word but what kind of word amen i
[50:33] could lay this word on top of me and
[50:35] sleep all night long and it wouldn't
[50:37] bring it to life but it had to be the
[50:39] word manifest which was light amen and
[50:42] that light over this seed would bring it
[50:44] to life
[50:47] i could lay on the bible i could lay
[50:48] under the bible
[50:52] see what i'm saying but the light that
[50:55] brings life
[50:56] is the word made manifest
[51:00] that word made manifest friends is now
[51:02] in you and i
[51:07] god wants his word to live
[51:09] he wants his word to be alive he wants
[51:12] to be manifested and on display
[51:17] the prophet of god says and god is not
[51:19] going to inquire of you how much
[51:21] schooling you got when you were here on
[51:23] earth how much knowledge you accumulated
[51:25] whether you got your bachelor of art or
[51:27] whatever degree you might have been even
[51:29] as a minister it's not going to be
[51:31] required of you
[51:32] but it's going to be required of you
[51:34] what you did about the understanding of
[51:36] god's word
[51:38] that's where the requirement comes
[51:41] my word is life and to know it is life
[51:45] and he said know him he is the word so
[51:48] you can only know him by the word
[51:50] for he is the word that's the only way
[51:52] you'll know him is by the word so to
[51:55] know him as life but the only way you
[51:56] can know him is by the word
[51:59] brother brim says many times he quotes
[52:01] this in a different way many places in
[52:03] the message he says it's not to know the
[52:05] word but to know him as life
[52:07] and here he gives you more information
[52:09] so brother over and over says it's not
[52:11] to know the word but to know him what
[52:13] brother branham is doing he's contesting
[52:16] with theologians who intellectually know
[52:18] the written word
[52:21] they're saying it's not to know the word
[52:23] that's life everywhere else brother i'm
[52:24] saying the word is life the word is life
[52:26] the word is life you have to understand
[52:27] what he's saying when he says it's not
[52:29] to know the word he said not to know
[52:31] just the written word is life but to
[52:33] know him the person of the word is life
[52:35] but how can you know the person of the
[52:37] word outside the revelation of the word
[52:40] for he is the revelation of the word
[52:44] so here he brings some clarity to those
[52:46] statements he says uh uh but the the
[52:49] word of god is life my word is life and
[52:52] to know it is life so it sounds
[52:55] backwards with what he's always been
[52:57] saying
[52:58] and he said know him he is the word
[53:02] so you can only know him
[53:04] by the word
[53:06] for he is the word that's the only way
[53:08] you'll know him
[53:09] is by the word
[53:12] so you must know the person
[53:14] of the word
[53:16] not just
[53:17] written word
[53:18] but living word
[53:23] let's go back to first john
[53:28] first john chapter 5.
[53:31] we'll look at this again
[53:36] first john chapter 5 verse 20.
[53:41] and we know that the son of god has come
[53:43] and hath given us an understanding that
[53:46] we may know him that is true and we are
[53:49] in him that is true even in his son
[53:51] jesus christ
[53:53] this is the true god and eternal life
[53:57] praise god
[53:59] brother ben says in invisible union
[54:01] there is there is your name on the book
[54:03] of life
[54:04] the book of life is the word of god
[54:06] because the word of god because the word
[54:09] is god and god is the only thing that is
[54:12] life
[54:14] so your name was represented in the
[54:16] bible before the bible became onward
[54:20] and if you're here to do that won't it
[54:22] vindicate that word
[54:24] so brother brahm says here is your name
[54:26] on the book of life the book of life is
[54:29] the word of god because the word is god
[54:32] and god is the only thing that is life
[54:34] so your name was represented in the
[54:37] bible before the bible came on word or
[54:39] came on print
[54:41] that means there's something in you that
[54:43] predates the written word
[54:46] that's why you can never deny this word
[54:50] that's why there's an attraction to the
[54:52] word amen because inside is life amen
[54:56] and the revealed word is life and life
[54:58] comes to life light comes the light word
[55:00] comes to word
[55:02] and so that part of us that was in god
[55:05] before the foundation of the world amen
[55:08] that was that that was attracted to the
[55:11] word it was an attraction put in it from
[55:13] before the foundation of the world that
[55:15] the right light the right life would
[55:17] come and spring this to life
[55:21] but there's only one life
[55:23] and that's god
[55:25] let's go look back at chapter one
[55:28] first john chapter one
[55:33] and verse 1 chapter 1 and verse 1.
[55:36] that which was from the beginning which
[55:38] we have heard which we have seen with
[55:40] our eyes which we have looked upon and
[55:42] our hands have handled of the word of
[55:44] life
[55:46] for the life was manifested and we have
[55:48] seen it and bear witness and show unto
[55:50] you that eternal life which was with the
[55:52] father and was manifested unto us
[55:57] that's why to have the son
[55:59] is to have eternal life
[56:01] what is the son
[56:02] it's the word
[56:04] jesus christ is the word he was the
[56:07] logos that came out of the father it was
[56:09] the word coming forth he is the word he
[56:12] is the word has the life is the life of
[56:15] god
[56:16] and
[56:17] and
[56:18] we have that eternal life
[56:21] and paul now john is sitting there
[56:23] saying john is telling us that we have
[56:25] handled the word of life
[56:28] we have touched the word of life amen it
[56:32] wasn't a scroll amen it was manifest in
[56:35] a human being it was jesus christ it was
[56:37] the word made flesh
[56:40] we have handled with our hands of the
[56:42] word of life we have seen with our eyes
[56:44] we have looked upon our hands have
[56:46] handled of the word of life for the life
[56:48] was manifested and we have seen it and
[56:51] bear witness and show unto the that
[56:53] eternal life which was with the father
[56:54] and was manifest unto us and that which
[56:57] came out of the father was the word and
[56:58] the word amen is the son of god and that
[57:01] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[57:03] and they said we touched the word of
[57:04] life
[57:07] amen
[57:09] but when when that body died and raised
[57:12] again life still continued on christ is
[57:15] still living the word is still being
[57:16] made manifest and the word made manifest
[57:18] still has life
[57:20] it is still life
[57:23] and in the message god's power to
[57:25] transform he says and he had spoke the
[57:27] word
[57:28] and his great creating power had formed
[57:30] these things that came up
[57:32] and even the man and the woman they were
[57:35] the head because they were they were
[57:37] super to all other races and he put them
[57:40] also under the care of the same thing
[57:42] that he put trees animals and so forth
[57:44] his word
[57:45] they must never by no means break that
[57:47] word
[57:48] they must stay there don't never take
[57:51] anything from it or add anything to it
[57:53] you must live by this word
[57:57] so he's referring to adam and his wife
[57:59] in the garden of eden when they were in
[58:01] the garden of eden they had life they
[58:03] had life that was never ending the their
[58:05] life was not in danger of ending amen
[58:08] but that life brother ben was telling us
[58:10] is because they were under the word amen
[58:13] they were living in the manifested word
[58:15] of god the the message of their day
[58:19] and they had a word to keep they had a
[58:22] message adam was given a message and
[58:24] that message was don't take of this tree
[58:27] amen and when they left the word death
[58:30] set in so life was staying with the word
[58:33] death was to leave the word
[58:35] so life has always been with the word
[58:38] friends it's always from the very
[58:40] beginning from the earliest story that
[58:42] we have in the bible god is showing us
[58:45] that life is with the word and anything
[58:47] outside the word is death as soon as she
[58:50] left one word death set in so where was
[58:54] her life her life was in the word where
[58:56] did she lose her life outside the word
[58:59] so life is in the word what word the
[59:01] present word she was under present word
[59:05] and when she left that present word
[59:07] death set in
[59:10] that's what the prophet of god is
[59:11] teaching us
[59:12] life is by the word
[59:15] and anointed once at the end time he
[59:16] says now run the scriptures jesus is the
[59:18] word
[59:19] in the beginning was the word and the
[59:21] word was made flesh and one among us in
[59:23] the beginning was the word and the word
[59:24] was with god and the word was made flesh
[59:27] and who lived dwelled among us
[59:29] and man shall not live by bread alone
[59:31] for the physical but by every word that
[59:33] proceedeth out of the mouth of god then
[59:36] you see we live by the word and that is
[59:39] god
[59:41] and the third seal he says god promised
[59:44] the spiritual eve as same as he did the
[59:47] natural eve that again
[59:49] the word would be restored to her
[59:52] remember eve had the word
[59:55] do you believe she had the word
[59:57] she had the full word of god for her day
[1:00:02] and as long as she stayed with that word
[1:00:04] she had life everlasting
[1:00:07] so that commandment was life everlasting
[1:00:11] do we agree
[1:00:13] when she left that word
[1:00:16] she lost life
[1:00:19] but god has promised that he's going to
[1:00:22] bring the spiritual leave he's going to
[1:00:24] bring the word back
[1:00:26] so if he brings the word back
[1:00:28] what's he bringing back he's bringing
[1:00:30] back life amen
[1:00:32] and to stay in that word is life eternal
[1:00:35] and to leave that word is death
[1:00:40] see the bible is one story
[1:00:44] not a bunch of books one story amen and
[1:00:47] what happened in the beginning god has
[1:00:48] been working all these years to rectify
[1:00:51] and bring us back to this place at the
[1:00:53] beginning and he promised he would bring
[1:00:55] the word back to eve amen back to
[1:00:57] spiritual eve which is the bride at the
[1:00:59] end time and there's been a promise for
[1:01:00] the word to come back when the word
[1:01:02] would come back everlasting life would
[1:01:04] come back and to stay in that word is to
[1:01:06] have life eternal to leave that word is
[1:01:09] to leave life
[1:01:10] to reject that word is to reject life
[1:01:14] so what god has given us in our day
[1:01:16] friends this was not another reformer
[1:01:18] this wasn't another step amen this was
[1:01:20] the capping off this was the full
[1:01:22] measure of the word bringing the full
[1:01:24] life this is everlasting life i just say
[1:01:27] it this way this message is life
[1:01:29] everlasting
[1:01:32] not a better idea a better way to live
[1:01:35] amen more truth than somebody else this
[1:01:38] is life everlasting
[1:01:40] what you carry around inside of you is
[1:01:42] everlasting life this message this
[1:01:44] revelation that you have is life
[1:01:47] everlasting the revelation that you can
[1:01:48] give to your neighbor to a co-worker to
[1:01:51] a loved one is everlasting life friends
[1:01:55] the same way paul was carrying
[1:01:57] everlasting life you're carrying
[1:01:59] everlasting life
[1:02:08] he
[1:02:09] promised spiritual eve the same as he
[1:02:11] did natural leave
[1:02:13] that again the word would be restored to
[1:02:15] her
[1:02:18] how did he promise natural eve the word
[1:02:21] to be restored to her
[1:02:23] because along with the curse came a
[1:02:24] promise
[1:02:25] thy seed
[1:02:28] shall bruise his head
[1:02:30] that prophecy was in the natural line
[1:02:33] and there was a natural woman who
[1:02:35] conceived amen by the holy ghost and
[1:02:37] brought forth amen the christ child and
[1:02:40] she was fulfilling what was it what did
[1:02:42] mary bring forth the word made flesh
[1:02:45] what what was restored to the woman
[1:02:47] natural the word now spiritual leave has
[1:02:50] been promised what did spiritual eve
[1:02:52] lose in the 19 council she lost the word
[1:02:55] amen but what if she promised would be
[1:02:56] restored to her spiritually she would be
[1:02:58] restored back to the word now this bride
[1:03:01] has been impregnated with the word she
[1:03:03] has life amen she has received life she
[1:03:07] is carrying life
[1:03:10] so he goes on to say i want to finish
[1:03:12] this quote
[1:03:13] the natural eve that the word would be
[1:03:15] restored to her in the last days he
[1:03:17] would restore to the church to the
[1:03:19] original word again
[1:03:22] has he done it
[1:03:24] he's done it
[1:03:26] in the message things that are to be he
[1:03:28] says now if we are those attributes of
[1:03:31] god we cannot live by creeds
[1:03:33] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[1:03:36] must live by the word
[1:03:38] why we are bringing being brought back
[1:03:41] to eden friends
[1:03:43] and in order to bring the woman back to
[1:03:45] eden he has to first bring back the word
[1:03:47] and she must be tested by that word she
[1:03:50] cannot leave that word if she leaves the
[1:03:52] word she leaves life
[1:03:54] so god has brought back life this word
[1:03:56] that has been restored is everlasting
[1:03:59] life
[1:04:00] and it's bringing us into an eden
[1:04:02] condition
[1:04:05] we must live by the word because the
[1:04:07] bride is part of the bridegroom like any
[1:04:09] wife is part of her husband therefore we
[1:04:10] must be that word bride and what is that
[1:04:13] word bride
[1:04:15] the manifestation of this hour
[1:04:18] what manifestation the manifestation of
[1:04:20] the word for this hour
[1:04:24] that's the word interpreted
[1:04:27] that's where his name is
[1:04:29] that's where his presence is
[1:04:32] that's where life is
[1:04:34] you and i we're not just people
[1:04:38] but we're vessels that god has chosen
[1:04:42] you didn't choose you god chose you
[1:04:44] you didn't decide god decided
[1:04:47] you didn't put a seed of a
[1:04:48] predestination inside of you god put a
[1:04:50] seed of predestination inside of you
[1:04:52] you didn't look for light light came to
[1:04:54] you and when light struck you you came
[1:04:56] to life amen you weren't in control of
[1:04:57] it god was in control of it and god has
[1:05:00] a vessel here that is carrying the word
[1:05:01] the restored word of the hour amen in
[1:05:04] that restored word of the hour is being
[1:05:05] made manifest and a body of believers
[1:05:07] that are making up the literal body of
[1:05:09] jesus christ upon the earth
[1:05:13] and that is where his name is
[1:05:15] that is where his word is that is where
[1:05:17] his presence is that is where life is
[1:05:23] what we have
[1:05:25] is what paul had in his day
[1:05:28] and paul was eager that somebody else
[1:05:30] could have it too
[1:05:32] and i want to be just as eager
[1:05:35] what is the word bride the manifestation
[1:05:37] of this hour the bride not a creed or a
[1:05:39] denomination but a living oracle of god
[1:05:42] a living attribute of god displaying to
[1:05:44] the world the attributes of god and the
[1:05:47] formation of the bride that's to be
[1:05:49] expressed in this hour that we're now
[1:05:51] living
[1:05:53] don't forget my title
[1:05:56] and i don't remember it myself
[1:06:01] lord have mercy
[1:06:04] the word in season
[1:06:07] is life everlasting
[1:06:09] what season did the prophet tell us
[1:06:10] we're in we're in the bright age
[1:06:12] the manifestation of the bride the body
[1:06:15] of christ on display
[1:06:17] the word in season
[1:06:18] is life everlasting
[1:06:24] he goes on to say the formation of the
[1:06:26] bride that's to be expressed in this
[1:06:27] hour that we're not living martin luther
[1:06:28] could not express the attributes that we
[1:06:30] express because that was in the
[1:06:32] beginning the resurrection like the
[1:06:34] corner wheat that went into the earth
[1:06:36] you see the whole program the whole
[1:06:38] church is built upon divine revelation
[1:06:41] jesus said in matthew the 16th chapter
[1:06:43] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:06:45] you but my father which is in heaven has
[1:06:47] revealed this to you what was it a
[1:06:49] revelation of who he was
[1:06:51] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:06:53] and the gates of hell can't prevail
[1:06:54] against it
[1:06:56] see the revelation of jesus christ in
[1:06:58] this hour not what he was in another
[1:07:01] hour what he is now
[1:07:03] the bible expresses it's growing in the
[1:07:06] bride to the full stature therefore if
[1:07:08] the corn of wheat of christ had to fall
[1:07:10] on the ground so did the the bride have
[1:07:12] to fall on the ground through the dark
[1:07:14] ages any grain that goes in the ground
[1:07:16] must die or it can't produce itself
[1:07:18] reproduce itself and the great church
[1:07:20] that he established on the day of
[1:07:21] pentecost by the sending of the holy
[1:07:23] ghost had to suffer martyrdom and go
[1:07:25] into the dirt and to the earth into the
[1:07:27] dark age to bring forth again in the age
[1:07:29] of luther and come on out to the full
[1:07:32] stature of the bride of jesus christ for
[1:07:34] this last day
[1:07:36] and that is the manifestation of the
[1:07:39] word for this day
[1:07:42] it's not trivial friends
[1:07:45] it's everlasting life
[1:07:49] brother bram says in the identified
[1:07:50] masterpiece of god you've got to stay
[1:07:52] with that word
[1:07:54] to be the bride if you're in the bride
[1:07:56] you're in the word and the word is in
[1:07:59] you
[1:08:00] what is the word
[1:08:01] life
[1:08:03] who is the word christ
[1:08:05] if you're in the bride you're in the
[1:08:07] word you're in him
[1:08:08] and the word is in you you're in him and
[1:08:10] he's in you
[1:08:12] if you're in the bride you're in the
[1:08:14] word and the word is in you and the word
[1:08:15] that reflected god through christ
[1:08:17] reflects the same god through you
[1:08:20] amen amen made so be it so be it i
[1:08:23] believe it to be the truth you have to
[1:08:25] be identified with him
[1:08:28] what is it friends
[1:08:30] the word in season
[1:08:33] is everlasting life
[1:08:35] what we have is what we have is
[1:08:39] everything
[1:08:41] not because of us but because of him
[1:08:45] what paul had was everything they needed
[1:08:47] in his day
[1:08:49] amen
[1:08:50] but they rejected it because it came in
[1:08:52] a way they didn't expect and it wasn't
[1:08:54] palatable it was different
[1:08:56] and god sent a prophet in our day and it
[1:08:58] came different to the denomination
[1:09:00] different than anyone expected he spoke
[1:09:02] different he used the scriptures in a
[1:09:04] different way because he had the
[1:09:05] revelation for his hour
[1:09:08] and he was rejected amen but to reject
[1:09:11] that ministry to reject that word was to
[1:09:13] reject jesus christ because the message
[1:09:15] is christ
[1:09:17] but the message didn't stop there the
[1:09:19] messenger came to point us to the
[1:09:21] message to bring the message and the
[1:09:23] message was christ is returning
[1:09:26] but how is returning he's returning as
[1:09:28] the word and where will the word be the
[1:09:30] word will be manifested in a people upon
[1:09:33] the earth
[1:09:34] which is his bride his body he has a
[1:09:38] physical body on this earth and that is
[1:09:41] his bride
[1:09:43] and that is the message it's christ in
[1:09:46] the formation of the bride that's to be
[1:09:48] the manifested word in this day
[1:09:51] that's
[1:09:52] where his name is
[1:09:55] that's why to fight that to deny that to
[1:09:57] reject that it doesn't matter what else
[1:09:59] you say amen doesn't matter what words
[1:10:02] you use amen you're not praying in his
[1:10:04] name
[1:10:05] you're outside of his name we've got to
[1:10:07] come to where god is and where god is
[1:10:09] working and recognize how powerful it is
[1:10:12] amen it is life it is the place of life
[1:10:14] it is where he's dwelling
[1:10:18] and we have to recognize
[1:10:20] that it is what the world needs
[1:10:23] they need this message but they need it
[1:10:25] more than just
[1:10:26] in print form they need it in a living
[1:10:28] form
[1:10:30] they need to rub shoulders with the word
[1:10:32] made manifest
[1:10:34] they need to see the word made manifest
[1:10:36] at work and in a family and an extended
[1:10:40] family and in this situation in that
[1:10:41] situation they need to see the word made
[1:10:44] manifest
[1:10:46] because that's where life is
[1:10:48] they need to come in contact with life
[1:10:51] that's why
[1:10:52] communal living will never work
[1:10:55] the world is falling apart
[1:10:56] we talked about this sunday who wants to
[1:10:59] fly away and run away and go live
[1:11:00] off-grid somewhere in the mountains
[1:11:07] but
[1:11:08] you take life when you pull back into
[1:11:10] the mountains you pull life back into
[1:11:12] the mountains
[1:11:14] when you keep away
[1:11:16] from everybody keep your head down talk
[1:11:18] to nobody refute you pull life back from
[1:11:21] the world
[1:11:23] god did not tell his disciples i'll pray
[1:11:26] to get you out of the world but i'll
[1:11:27] pray that god will keep you from the
[1:11:28] evil in the world
[1:11:31] we have to be here to shine light amen
[1:11:34] she will be the final voice
[1:11:36] to the final age
[1:11:38] it's not trivial it's not light it's
[1:11:41] powerful it is life amen we're carrying
[1:11:43] life we're bearing life we're presenting
[1:11:45] life we're sharing life it's everlasting
[1:11:48] life it isn't the message as a form of
[1:11:50] church and a form of teaching and a form
[1:11:52] of adherence to codes that's not it
[1:11:54] friends it's you and christ as persons
[1:11:57] together sharing life demonstrating life
[1:11:59] being life
[1:12:03] man it's not it's not time to settle
[1:12:05] down into a church and and i'm in the
[1:12:08] message that term can mean anything it
[1:12:10] has become it has turned into anything
[1:12:12] anything you want to be the message has
[1:12:13] been the message
[1:12:15] and it's it's a loosely attached to
[1:12:17] brother branham in one way or another
[1:12:19] loosely or firmly however you do that if
[1:12:22] there's an attachment to the messenger
[1:12:24] saying we believe the message amen but i
[1:12:26] want to do more than believe the message
[1:12:27] because the devil believes the message
[1:12:32] i want to be the message amen i want to
[1:12:36] be the manifestation of the word for
[1:12:38] this day and i could only do it if he
[1:12:40] chose me before the foundation of the
[1:12:42] world amen if it's his choosing not mine
[1:12:44] i can't make myself that but if he made
[1:12:46] me before the foundation of the world
[1:12:48] then that's my place and i want to be
[1:12:50] that so how do you be that brother chad
[1:12:52] you yield yourself to this word and then
[1:12:56] stop resisting it stop explaining it
[1:12:58] away stop trying to form it into our own
[1:13:00] understanding or package it into the
[1:13:02] package we're most comfortable with but
[1:13:04] come back to the message and say if
[1:13:06] that's the way god presented it that's
[1:13:08] the way i believe it
[1:13:10] if that's the way the prophet thought it
[1:13:12] that's the way i believe it if that's
[1:13:14] the way god wanted me to receive his
[1:13:16] word and god instructed me then that is
[1:13:19] the way that i believe it and that's the
[1:13:20] way i receive it
[1:13:28] if you're called
[1:13:30] chosen predestinated
[1:13:33] then he is needing
[1:13:35] preeminence
[1:13:37] and preeminence is not taken by force he
[1:13:40] takes preeminence as we give him
[1:13:42] preeminence
[1:13:45] and i
[1:13:46] want to live this message
[1:13:49] because i want to
[1:13:51] i want to be a vessel carrying eternal
[1:13:53] life that somebody else can get a hold
[1:13:55] of
[1:13:58] i hope i know and trust that you're the
[1:14:00] same way
[1:14:02] friends we cannot reject one iota of
[1:14:04] this message
[1:14:06] cannot
[1:14:07] play with this message tamper with it
[1:14:09] adjust it make it flexible we cannot do
[1:14:13] leave the message pure like god gave it
[1:14:17] leave it the way it was presented leave
[1:14:19] it the way the prophet taught it leave
[1:14:21] the message alone and just bend yourself
[1:14:24] and break yourself to it
[1:14:26] don't bend it to you
[1:14:33] i don't want to be found rejecting god's
[1:14:35] word
[1:14:36] because i didn't understand his ways
[1:14:39] but i want to yield to that so that the
[1:14:42] word can be on display in my life
[1:14:45] a true word a perfect word
[1:14:48] that carries with it eternal life
[1:14:50] god bless you let's all stand
[1:14:55] amen
[1:14:57] i love the word
[1:15:00] i love the lord
[1:15:02] for his goodness to us
[1:15:04] he's taken away our guessing he's taken
[1:15:06] away our wondering he's given himself to
[1:15:08] us and he's given himself and we may ask
[1:15:12] you know why are there so many ideas
[1:15:14] about the message and so many concepts
[1:15:16] listen it's beautiful friends that's why
[1:15:19] for me i have no desire whatsoever to
[1:15:21] fight anybody else's concept to what the
[1:15:23] message is god allowed it if god allowed
[1:15:26] it leave it alone
[1:15:28] because god will present himself through
[1:15:31] the message
[1:15:33] and somebody else will take that and
[1:15:34] present it another way
[1:15:36] and adapt it another way and another way
[1:15:38] and another way and god will see which
[1:15:41] one is bride by what she chooses
[1:15:46] what what way do you want the message
[1:15:49] packaged
[1:15:53] do you want it packaged this way do you
[1:15:55] want it
[1:15:56] more convenient do you want it a little
[1:15:58] more strict
[1:16:01] right
[1:16:02] if god allows it leave it alone don't
[1:16:04] fight it
[1:16:06] but say god
[1:16:07] reveal to me the truth i want all of you
[1:16:11] i don't want it perverted i don't want
[1:16:13] it tainted i don't want to adapt it in
[1:16:15] some way i want it straight the way you
[1:16:17] give it amen give me the true message
[1:16:20] give me yourself
[1:16:21] in truth
[1:16:23] and god will allow
[1:16:25] all kinds of variations and they will
[1:16:27] stay there
[1:16:29] you think why won't god destroy those
[1:16:31] who pervert his word he will after he's
[1:16:34] accomplished his purpose with them
[1:16:39] and god is saying
[1:16:41] which one wants me
[1:16:45] and which one
[1:16:47] wants me packaged to suit them
[1:16:52] i said god help me to only want you
[1:16:56] and if my ideas have to crumble around
[1:16:58] my feet let them crumble around my feet
[1:17:01] but i want you in the genuine truth in
[1:17:03] which you presented yourself in this age
[1:17:06] i want the full word
[1:17:08] i don't even want my idea to mix it up i
[1:17:11] want to die to my own concept to have
[1:17:13] the truth
[1:17:15] because this word
[1:17:17] given to us in this day
[1:17:19] is everlasting life
[1:17:21] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:17:23] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[1:17:26] we thank you for the beauty of your word
[1:17:29] for the way that you work lord we love
[1:17:31] you for that we can see you all down
[1:17:33] through the ages working the same way
[1:17:35] god i
[1:17:36] i praise you lord i thank you god that
[1:17:39] you've given us ears to hear
[1:17:42] you've given us eyes to see in our heart
[1:17:44] to perceive god we could have never
[1:17:46] given that to ourselves it's a gift
[1:17:47] you've given us
[1:17:49] and i'm so thankful for it lord
[1:17:51] and i'm asking now with all the saints
[1:17:53] that are present lord would you just
[1:17:55] break us lord
[1:17:57] break us and bend us lord that that we
[1:17:59] wouldn't be rigid lord but we would be
[1:18:01] flexible to your word that we would
[1:18:03] break under your word and it would be
[1:18:06] formed into the perfect image of you
[1:18:08] lord
[1:18:09] god break our ideas our concepts our
[1:18:11] desires our wishes break it all lord on
[1:18:14] your word
[1:18:16] that we would fit your mold and we
[1:18:18] wouldn't make you fit ours
[1:18:20] lord i love you and i thank you for your
[1:18:22] goodness to us
[1:18:24] i pray lord that you keep each one of us
[1:18:26] lord in the perfect path of light
[1:18:29] that we might manifest this perfect word
[1:18:33] god we give ourselves afresh to you
[1:18:36] you god i pray that you'd shine your
[1:18:38] light through each individual vessel
[1:18:40] that we might shine a light in a dark
[1:18:42] place and another seed might spring to
[1:18:44] life
[1:18:46] may we carry your word lord not carry
[1:18:48] wrong attitudes and wrong thoughts but
[1:18:51] may we just carry your word through life
[1:18:53] and may that word have an effect on
[1:18:54] others around us
[1:18:56] may you use these vessels to root out
[1:18:58] that last predestinated seed
