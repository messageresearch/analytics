[0:00] Religion makes him hard to approach.
[0:03] &gt;&gt; We got to do all of these things to get
[0:05] to him. But listen, the harlot didn't
[0:08] have a problem. The prostitute didn't
[0:09] have a problem. The tax collector didn't
[0:10] have a problem. AND THE LITTLE CHILDREN
[0:12] DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM getting to him.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; He didn't WANT TO BE DISTANT AND
[0:16] UNAPPROACHABLE. HE WANTED TO BE RIGHT
[0:18] THERE WITH HIS PEOPLE, HUMAN, WALKING
[0:20] WITH THEM, GETTING THE SAME DUST ON HIS
[0:23] FEET THAT THEY GOT ON THEIR FEET.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; EATING THE SAME DINNER THEY ATE, HE ATE.
[0:28] THIS IS WHAT GOD DID, FRIENDS. THIS IS
[0:31] THE CONDESCENDING OF GOD. SO THAT HE
[0:33] could be understood.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; So that he could understand.
[0:38] To [snorts] me, this is what Christmas
[0:40] is all about.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; Tinsel and lights. I don't care BEAMS
[0:43] FOR IT. AMEN. BUT THE REALITY IS GOD
[0:45] WANTED TO COME down and be flesh. Amen.
[0:47] So he could redeem us. So he could die
[0:49] for us. So that he could MAKE CONTACT
[0:50] WITH US. SO THAT HE COULD BE UNDERSTOOD.
[0:52] SO that he could be seen. SO HE COULD BE
[0:53] TOUCHED. SO HE COULD BE FELT. SO THAT HE
[0:55] COULD BE EXPERIENCED. BECAUSE THAT'S
[0:57] WHAT GOD WANTS. AMEN.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; We put him too far away.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08] &gt;&gt; Colossians 2:9 says, "For in him
[1:09] dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead
[1:12] bodily."
[1:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; All that was brother said, "All that God
[1:16] was, he poured into Christ."
[1:18] &gt;&gt; Where was he? He was right there.
[1:20] Listen, what's what's amazing to me is
[1:23] they were still going to the temple and
[1:24] they were still taking sacrifices and
[1:26] they were still praying to a god above
[1:28] him.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; And he was walking right by.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; There was days he visited the temple.
[1:36] There was times he was walking down the
[1:38] street. There was times he was in the
[1:39] outer court and there was people
[1:40] shuffling by. And it's amazing. I wonder
[1:42] if anybody ever bumped into him as they
[1:46] were going by and dragging their lamb.
[1:48] Amen. to go be sacrificed to go try to
[1:50] make contact with God to go be heard
[1:51] with God and make contact with God and
[1:53] they just pass God
[1:58] &gt;&gt; trying to do the religion trying to
[1:59] reach a God that's above us trying to
[2:01] reach a God that's far away and trying
[2:03] to make contact with a God who's up
[2:05] there and far away and so much greater
[2:07] than we. AMEN. LISTEN, HE IS SO much
[2:09] greater than we, BUT HE'S SO MUCH
[2:10] GREATER THAT he has enough character
[2:12] that he can condescend down and become
[2:14] low so that we can touch him. Amen. He
[2:16] wants to be within reach. He doesn't
[2:18] want to be out of reach. He wants to be
[2:19] within reach
[2:22] &gt;&gt; CUZ THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS. HE WANTS TO
[2:24] FELLOWSHIP WITH HIS ATTRIBUTES. HE
[2:26] DOESN'T WANT TO SIT THE MIGHTY GOD LIKE
[2:28] ZEUS UP ON A GREAT THRONE SOMEWHERE FAR
[2:30] AWAY IN THE HEAVENS THAT you have no
[2:32] hope of ever getting to UNLESS YOU JUMP
[2:34] THROUGH ALL THESE HOOPS AND AND you and
[2:36] you and you LIVE A PERFECT LIFE. AND IF
[2:37] NOT, YOU GET ZAPPED and you get sent to
[2:39] another demonic world and maybe you pay
[2:41] enough price and YOU CAN CLIMB. LISTEN,
[2:43] THAT'S NOT GOD. GOD DIDN'T ASK YOU TO
[2:46] COME TO HIM. GOD CAME DOWN TO YOU. AMEN.
[2:48] GOD SAID, "THESE ARE MY CHILDREN, MY
[2:50] FAMILY, MY PEOPLE, AND MY ZEAL AND MY
[2:53] PASSION AND MY JEALOUSY FOR THEM WILL
[2:55] PRODUCE ME IN FLESH TO RUB SHOULDERS
[2:57] WITH THEM AND LAY DOWN NEXT TO THEM AND
[2:59] EAT WITH THEM AND LOVE THEM AND DIE FOR
[3:01] THEM." AMEN. AND REDEEM THEM AND WASH
[3:04] THEM SO THAT I CAN COME AND DWELL INSIDE
[3:06] OF THEM. THAT'S HOW CLOSE HE WANTS
[3:08] FELLOWSHIP. FRIENDS,
[3:12] &gt;&gt; it's religion that puts him far away.
[3:14] IT'S YOUR HUMAN MIND THAT PUTS HIM FAR
[3:15] AWAY.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; Don't put God far away. Don't do
[3:19] religious service and keep climbing a
[3:21] religious ladder trying TO GET TO GOD.
[3:23] YOU'LL PASS HIM
[3:25] &gt;&gt; because he's coming down
[3:28] &gt;&gt; to meet with you and I.
