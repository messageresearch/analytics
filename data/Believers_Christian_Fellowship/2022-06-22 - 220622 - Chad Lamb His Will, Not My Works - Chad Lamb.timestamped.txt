[12:36] your glory in jesus christ's name
[12:38] amen
[12:40] amen god bless you all while we're
[12:41] standing let's take our bibles and turn
[12:44] if you will to john chapter 19
[12:46] say god bless you sister karen it's good
[12:48] to see you feeling good amen
[12:50] and brother les it's good to see you
[12:51] here i'm glad you're feeling better
[12:54] man god is good amen
[12:56] um i just wanted to let you know we're
[12:58] gonna have a visiting minister on sunday
[13:00] i hadn't really planned it that way and
[13:01] i wouldn't normally schedule somebody in
[13:04] after having so many visiting ministers
[13:05] and being away myself but i just learned
[13:08] that gabriel matagne from romania is in
[13:11] the country contacting me this week and
[13:14] said that he could he'd like to extend
[13:15] his trip he wanted to come by and see us
[13:17] brother gabriel's a pastor in romania
[13:19] and he's the one who organized
[13:21] the camp
[13:22] that we went and ministered at i don't
[13:24] know maybe four or five years ago and i
[13:26] was supposed to be there for easter and
[13:28] i believe it was 2020 got cancelled by
[13:30] cove but i was supposed to be there in
[13:31] september of 2021 was canceled by covet
[13:35] and so we've been supposed to connect
[13:37] for quite a bit but he's here in the
[13:38] states and he's a fine brother very
[13:40] active in the ministry very active and
[13:42] spreading the message through romania
[13:44] and so he'll be here sunday and i've
[13:46] asked him to take the service so he'll
[13:48] be preaching for us so be praying for
[13:50] that and be praying for him so it's
[13:52] something that just came up and and so
[13:53] i'm looking forward to seeing him again
[13:56] also one of the deacons told me we have
[13:58] visitors from tucson
[14:00] brother juan sister anna gonzalez and
[14:02] their family god bless you it's good to
[14:04] have you you're very welcome amen and
[14:06] we'll hopefully get a chance to shake
[14:08] your hand after service
[14:09] amen let's look now at john chapter 19
[14:12] while we're standing we'll read this one
[14:13] scripture then take our seats john
[14:16] chapter 19
[14:17] verse 16
[14:23] then delivered he him therefore unto
[14:26] them to be crucified
[14:28] and they took jesus and led him away
[14:31] before we have our seats i'd like to
[14:33] read one other scripture in luke luke 23
[14:36] we just turn back to that quickly
[14:39] luke 23
[14:44] and we're going to read part of this
[14:45] verse verse 33
[14:48] luke 23
[14:49] and verse 33
[14:52] and when they were come to the place
[14:53] which is called calvary
[14:55] there they crucified him
[14:59] man you may take your seats and god
[15:01] bless us as we look at his word
[15:05] amen when we look at these two
[15:06] scriptures it says
[15:10] that pilate he's referring to pilate in
[15:11] john 19 then delivered he him therefore
[15:14] unto them to be crucified and they took
[15:16] jesus and led him away
[15:18] and then the scripture we're looking at
[15:20] now it says they they come to the place
[15:22] which is called calvary and there they
[15:24] crucified him we know these four words
[15:27] are very important brother brenham first
[15:29] addresses this in the second seal but
[15:31] then he really elaborates on it in the
[15:33] indictment it says there amen the most
[15:35] holy place jerusalem they the most holy
[15:38] people god's chosen people crucified the
[15:41] most cruel form of capital punishment
[15:43] him the most precious person jesus
[15:46] christ so brother venom takes and lays
[15:48] out the indictment based on this
[15:50] scripture and those four words amen
[15:52] there they crucified him
[15:54] but i'm not really wanting to go into
[15:56] that into the indictment but i just want
[15:58] to
[15:59] take a look at something that's been on
[16:01] my heart i expressed it to a couple
[16:02] brothers on sunday after the service and
[16:04] so this will tie in with sunday but i
[16:06] want to continue with a little bit
[16:07] different thought
[16:09] amen and we know sunday we were talking
[16:11] about the value of the word and and i'd
[16:13] like to just say i don't know that we
[16:15] could ever value enough the word that we
[16:17] have
[16:18] you know we took that statement brother
[16:19] bam said i wonder if um oh i can't
[16:22] remember what it said
[16:24] amen what was it brother
[16:27] praise god i wonder if we are
[16:29] sufficiently i want i know i wonder if
[16:31] we are sufficiently impressed with the
[16:32] word that's in our midst
[16:34] amen praise god i'm glad some people
[16:37] have good fresh memories and they're
[16:38] still young
[16:40] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[16:42] our midst amen i don't think we can ever
[16:44] be impressed enough i don't think we
[16:45] could ever value it enough amen it is
[16:48] the most wonderful thing that has ever
[16:49] happened to mankind for god to open what
[16:52] was a mystery in the back part of his
[16:54] mind and whispered his love secrets to
[16:56] his bride amen i don't know that we ever
[16:59] i don't know what ever come to the end
[17:01] of how amazing that is i don't know that
[17:02] we'll ever discover how wonderful that
[17:05] is amen until we get out of here i don't
[17:07] know but we should give everything to
[17:10] that amen
[17:11] and so now i you know i was thinking on
[17:14] that thought and and then moving from
[17:16] that some things that i've been
[17:17] meditating on and i want to read just a
[17:19] a a statement brother bennett makes here
[17:22] a god's word calls for total separation
[17:24] from unbelief it says then we rebuke
[17:26] satan and all his powers of darkness
[17:28] amen he's at the end of the service here
[17:30] and he says all of his powers of
[17:32] unbelief the spirit of god has raised up
[17:34] a standard against you satan you are a
[17:36] defeated being jesus christ defeated you
[17:39] at calvary i just wanted to read that
[17:41] last statement jesus christ defeated you
[17:43] at calvary brother bennett makes this
[17:44] statement multiple times through
[17:46] multiple uh um
[17:48] sermons he preaches he says many times
[17:50] that satan was defeated at calvary and
[17:52] he when he and he's rebuking the devil
[17:54] many times in a prayer line of praying
[17:56] over people and he's rebuking the devil
[17:58] and casting them out and saying you were
[18:00] defeated at calvary
[18:01] and and we began to look i began to
[18:03] think about
[18:05] the devil being defeated at calvary and
[18:08] i started meditating on this thought and
[18:10] and thinking that at calvary
[18:13] if you'll just
[18:14] not get too stumbled of what i'm about
[18:16] to say
[18:17] but at calvary jesus didn't do anything
[18:23] at calvary jesus had no works
[18:28] no works of his own
[18:31] he extended no effort he didn't do
[18:34] anything there were no miracles there
[18:37] was there was not there was no effort
[18:39] there was no work there was there was no
[18:42] demonstration there was no manifestation
[18:45] there was no preaching
[18:47] one of the greatest victories mankind
[18:50] has ever experienced was calvary
[18:53] the price of redemption was paid at
[18:55] calvary the victory over hybridization
[18:58] was paid for amen was won at calvary
[19:01] amen i don't know that we can ever
[19:03] be thankful enough for calvary for the
[19:05] shedding of that pure blood as an
[19:07] atonement for my sins as a substitute
[19:10] for me amen he took my place at calvary
[19:13] but when it comes to calvary amen it
[19:16] wasn't what jesus did there was nothing
[19:19] he did it's what he surrendered himself
[19:21] to
[19:23] it wasn't a work amen calvary wasn't
[19:25] works amen calvary wasn't effort calvary
[19:28] wasn't ministry calvary wasn't
[19:31] manifestations amen calvary amen was one
[19:34] man totally in control of god amen one
[19:37] person who would completely submit to
[19:40] the will of god amen brought forth the
[19:42] calvary it wasn't what he did it's what
[19:45] he surrendered to amen that brought
[19:47] calvary
[19:49] and remember jesus as our example in
[19:51] everything amen so when we look at the
[19:53] greatest victory the greatest victory
[19:56] came
[19:57] oh i'm going to say things that sound
[20:00] bad but they're not bad they're good the
[20:02] greatest victory came with the least
[20:04] amount of personal effort
[20:09] because it wasn't what he did there they
[20:12] took him and they crucified him there
[20:15] they crucified him he didn't crucify
[20:18] himself amen he didn't scorch himself
[20:20] amen to pay for our sicknesses by his
[20:23] stripes amen it says by his stripes we
[20:25] are healed but he didn't lay the stripes
[20:27] on himself others did it to him amen
[20:30] there he shed his blood but he didn't
[20:32] prick himself he didn't nail himself to
[20:34] the cross he didn't crucify himself he
[20:37] didn't condemn himself to die he didn't
[20:39] pass the judgment he didn't do the works
[20:42] all he did was surrender to god in
[20:44] gethsemane amen and others took him and
[20:47] crucified him it wasn't what he did it's
[20:50] what he surrendered himself to
[20:54] and if that brought the greatest victory
[20:56] to mankind the shedding of blood amen
[20:59] what will bring this greatest victory in
[21:01] the final act of redemption to bring a
[21:04] change in the body what is it that we
[21:06] can do amen what is it
[21:09] this is my whole thought amen is not his
[21:12] will not my works
[21:16] we get so
[21:18] i i find that there there's so many
[21:20] times
[21:21] brother bam said man has always tried to
[21:23] have something to do with it amen that's
[21:25] the failure of mankind that's the
[21:27] failure of denominationalism that was
[21:30] the failure in exodus 19. it's been the
[21:32] failure all along that man wants to put
[21:34] his effort towards something but every
[21:37] time man puts his effort towards
[21:38] something he ruins it amen
[21:41] and it's god it doesn't want us to put
[21:43] our effort towards something he wants us
[21:45] to surrender to something and it was his
[21:48] will now now don't don't get me wrong
[21:50] it's not like we don't have any effort
[21:52] we do the word of god we sacrifice we
[21:55] give up we we obey we do what he called
[21:58] us to do but at the end of the day what
[22:00] can you do amen what what work are you
[22:04] able to work what thing
[22:06] what can you do what power do you have
[22:09] what will your little hands and your
[22:11] little body what will it do they meant
[22:13] nothing but surrender to the will of god
[22:16] it's the will of god that'll bring the
[22:18] victory
[22:22] remember jesus is our example
[22:25] he goes to win the battle
[22:27] he goes to bring victory he goes to
[22:30] release us from bondage he goes to to
[22:33] break the power of the enemy by
[22:35] hybridization he goes to shed his
[22:38] precious blood amen as a perfect slain
[22:40] lamb to free us from the curse
[22:45] and there's nothing he can do
[22:48] there's nothing he can add to it
[22:52] there's no effort he can put into it
[22:55] he just has to completely surrender
[22:58] and let god
[22:59] do what god already ordained that god
[23:02] would do
[23:04] he wouldn't even speak at his
[23:06] trial you think of the wisdom of solomon
[23:09] but he said a greater than solomon is
[23:11] here the wisest of the wisest was
[23:14] standing there on trial amen and the
[23:17] trial was a dog and pony show and it was
[23:19] an absolute ridiculous trial and do you
[23:22] think that jesus with a few phrases
[23:24] couldn't have unraveled the whole thing
[23:26] he couldn't have made pilate ashamed of
[23:28] himself he couldn't make canvases in the
[23:30] high priest tucked their tails and those
[23:31] who were speaking against him run away
[23:33] and hide with just a few phrases he
[23:35] could have discerned the whole thing he
[23:37] had more wisdom than solomon had amen a
[23:40] greater than solomon was standing on
[23:42] trial amen and it wasn't his wisdom that
[23:44] was going to win the day it wasn't words
[23:47] it wasn't discernment it wasn't anything
[23:49] that was going to win the victory he had
[23:51] to close his mouth and completely
[23:53] surrender and let god do it amen this
[23:56] was god's victory man this was god's
[23:58] doing amen but god couldn't do it
[24:00] without a human being god has so set his
[24:03] plan that he doesn't do anything without
[24:05] you and i he needs a man to work through
[24:07] amen but he didn't need this man to do
[24:10] anything he needed this man to say thy
[24:13] will be done not mine
[24:14] [Music]
[24:16] that's the kind of man he needed for the
[24:18] greatest victory amen for the for the
[24:20] destruction of satan for the overcoming
[24:23] amen of the fall he needed a man that
[24:26] wouldn't put his own effort into it amen
[24:28] wouldn't use his own mind that wouldn't
[24:31] even use his gifts
[24:36] for the greatest victory
[24:38] he needed a man that will stand
[24:41] and be quiet
[24:44] and
[24:44] surrender and let god have his way amen
[24:52] brother bam tells us he could have
[24:54] called for legions
[24:56] of angels to deliver him
[24:59] he said brother man quoted billy sunday
[25:01] and he said the trees at calvary were
[25:04] full of angels waiting for him to just
[25:06] twitch his finger
[25:08] he had power to deliver himself he had
[25:11] gifts amen to deliver himself he had he
[25:14] had the ability a man to do all manner
[25:17] of things but he didn't do anything he
[25:20] did nothing he did nothing nothing
[25:22] nothing but completely yield to the will
[25:25] of god
[25:29] i'd like to take his example
[25:32] god help us to take his example
[25:36] we we sometimes feel such a pressure to
[25:39] produce something
[25:41] to do something that that i have to do
[25:44] something as if god needs my help
[25:48] god needs my effort god doesn't need my
[25:50] help he needs my surrender amen god
[25:52] can't work his program without you and i
[25:54] that's absolutely the truth but he's not
[25:56] depending on your brain
[25:59] he doesn't need your thoughts he doesn't
[26:01] need
[26:02] he doesn't need your intellect he
[26:04] doesn't need your smooth charisma he
[26:06] doesn't need your gifts what he needs is
[26:08] you amen
[26:12] jesus says in john chapter 5 let's turn
[26:14] to john chapter 5 together
[26:17] this is such a lesson
[26:19] that we can take
[26:24] you know how brother bam tells us that
[26:27] in jesus temptation in the wilderness
[26:30] he had all gifts but he didn't use any
[26:32] of his gifts to overcome the devil
[26:34] he used he used it is written
[26:37] he had all gifts all knowledge all
[26:40] understanding all power he had all
[26:42] abilities he could have he could have
[26:44] done anything amen as far as a
[26:48] demonstrative a gift or a power or
[26:50] manifestation amen but he used none of
[26:52] his gifts to overcome the devil amen all
[26:55] he used was the word he said it is
[26:57] written and brother bam said he put amen
[27:00] that in the in the hands of the weakest
[27:02] christian the ability to overcome the
[27:05] devil because we can take the same thing
[27:07] that jesus took whether we have gifts or
[27:09] don't have gifts or or whatever we can
[27:11] take it is written and it is written
[27:14] we'll defeat the devil any place anytime
[27:17] under any condition
[27:19] so jesus became our example although he
[27:21] could do all things although he had all
[27:24] power all he had all manifestations he
[27:26] had all gifts he used none of them to
[27:28] overcome the devil to be our example
[27:32] and so when he comes to calvary he is
[27:34] still our example amen
[27:37] so he uses no gifts
[27:39] he uses no power
[27:41] he uses no no nothing
[27:44] he just surrenders
[27:47] john chapter 5
[27:49] and verse 30.
[27:55] he says i can of my own self do nothing
[27:59] as i hear i judge and my judgment is
[28:02] just because i seek not my own will but
[28:05] the will of the father which has sent me
[28:08] i can do nothing of myself
[28:10] this is jesus christ
[28:13] the virgin-born son of god perfect in
[28:16] all ways and he said i can do nothing of
[28:18] myself
[28:20] but he says
[28:22] as i hear i judge and my judgment is
[28:25] just he's confident in his judgment not
[28:28] because of himself but because
[28:30] he says what the father says as i hear i
[28:32] judge and my judgment is just because i
[28:35] seek not my own will but the will of the
[28:38] father which hath sent me
[28:40] remember jesus is our example amen and
[28:43] if we if we are going to be like christ
[28:45] amen christ came and lived alive to set
[28:48] an example for us to follow because as
[28:51] we come to the end time we must be so
[28:53] much like him that we will be him we
[28:55] will be in his very image amen that we
[28:58] will become he was the word made flesh
[29:00] we are becoming the word made flesh amen
[29:03] so we must reflect this same kind of
[29:05] life he was a messiah we're messiahs
[29:07] amen he is jesus christ we're mrs jesus
[29:10] christ so we've got to come to the same
[29:12] kind of a life amen that jesus lived
[29:17] amen
[29:18] i i think what i've been meditating on
[29:21] uh what what i've been dealing with in
[29:23] myself and meditating on is sometimes i
[29:27] get so troubled
[29:29] by the level of arrogance i see
[29:34] in in people who believe that the bride
[29:37] of jesus christ
[29:39] find it myself sometimes and it's
[29:41] shameful
[29:43] like we can do something and we've got
[29:45] this and we've got that and no devil and
[29:48] blah blah blah blah blah
[29:51] and there's true promises and there's
[29:53] true things
[29:54] but what i want more than anything is
[29:56] not to pound my chest and tote my
[29:58] position and how wonderful i want to be
[30:01] like jesus christ i can do nothing in
[30:03] myself
[30:05] amen the only thing that i have is this
[30:07] word that's been given to me which is
[30:08] everything and i can take this word and
[30:10] defeat the devil i can't defeat the
[30:12] devil but i can take this word and this
[30:14] word will defeat the devil it's not me
[30:16] it's the word
[30:19] the sword amen of the word amen we'll
[30:22] drive back the devil and because we've
[30:24] been given such a pure word and that
[30:27] word is powerful and if we take it by
[30:29] faith amen that word will win the
[30:31] victory all the time we have to be
[30:33] careful and stop thinking that we're
[30:35] winning the victory and we're the strong
[30:37] ones amen it's not us it's the word amen
[30:40] it's the word that's been restored it's
[30:42] the word that's been given and because
[30:44] we have so much victory by faith in the
[30:46] word we become proud we become uh we we
[30:50] can be i'm not saying we are but we can
[30:51] become a little bit self-confident
[30:54] because we have victory upon victory
[30:56] pray for the sick and they're healed and
[30:58] deliverances and all the thing that's
[31:00] god doing for us he's doing it for us
[31:02] according to his word he's doing it
[31:04] because of his word he's doing it
[31:06] because we're taking his word the way
[31:07] the prophet told us to take a word but
[31:09] what if there was no prophet what if the
[31:11] word wasn't restored what if you were
[31:13] stuck in a methodist system amen what if
[31:15] you were stuck in some other system you
[31:17] would have no victory in your life you
[31:19] would have no deliverance you would be
[31:20] nothing it's the word that's giving us
[31:23] victory we've got to be careful that we
[31:24] don't start pinning badges on ourselves
[31:27] amen because of victories but we keep
[31:30] acknowledging i can do nothing of myself
[31:33] my judgment is just because i'm
[31:34] repeating what the prophet said i'm
[31:36] judging this situation correctly not
[31:38] because i'm wise but because i have ears
[31:41] to hear by the grace of god what a
[31:43] prophet said about this subject and i
[31:45] just take that and apply it here so my
[31:48] judgment is just
[31:50] because as i hear i judge
[31:52] [Music]
[31:54] but it's not because i'm all wise
[31:58] it's because i believe the word i've
[32:01] received the word by the grace of god
[32:03] and now that word will win the victory
[32:06] every time
[32:09] and sometimes when i hear these things
[32:11] in myself and on others and
[32:14] i say god help us amen
[32:17] let us come back to the example that's
[32:19] been given us
[32:20] and realize
[32:22] if we ever win
[32:24] this great victory over hybridization
[32:26] that's called the change of the body
[32:28] it will not be something you and i have
[32:30] done
[32:32] it will be something that we've
[32:33] surrendered ourselves to
[32:35] it'll be something that we've we've
[32:37] received by faith to the capacity to
[32:40] believe it and we will yield to it and
[32:43] god will do what god
[32:45] promised to do
[32:50] remember
[32:51] brother branham when he is given the
[32:54] power of the spoken word and the
[32:55] manifestation of the third pool
[32:58] and he creates squirrels and speaks to a
[33:00] storm and and all of these things
[33:03] there is a there's a question in
[33:05] questions and answers we've been through
[33:06] it before but i want to read it to you
[33:09] 1964 questions and answers this is
[33:12] august of 64.
[33:14] the question is this third pool is and
[33:16] is speaking the word
[33:18] it seems entirely possible for you to
[33:20] speak the word and one would be
[33:21] completely and fully restored placed
[33:24] entirely ready for the rapture in the
[33:25] resurrection the son of man
[33:28] this is so or is it not and you would do
[33:30] this if properly pressed upon would you
[33:32] not escape
[33:34] not escape all these things
[33:36] escape all these things and stand before
[33:38] the son of man
[33:39] so now my dear friend see now i think
[33:42] there that you got you got a good
[33:44] statement yes sir yes sir brother ben's
[33:47] agreeing
[33:48] you can do that
[33:49] yes sir yes sir
[33:51] now that would be so
[33:53] you say brother branham in other words
[33:55] here's what i i
[33:57] i don't think that it's i believe not
[33:59] polishing enough what you said but i
[34:01] believe i can make it a little clearer
[34:02] to the people see
[34:04] you are believing because of the spoken
[34:06] words and things like that that he said
[34:07] about and all of you here witnessed the
[34:09] squirrels and all those other things
[34:11] that's been done but did you notice
[34:14] that was sovereignly given
[34:17] i think that's the most important part
[34:19] of this
[34:21] we believe
[34:22] that that brother venom spoke
[34:26] and what he spoke manifested and came to
[34:28] exit he said let there be scrolls where
[34:30] he said the direction they would come
[34:32] from god did it exactly the way that man
[34:34] said
[34:37] but but listen to how he describes that
[34:41] because if not we start saying foolish
[34:43] things amen we start taking presumptions
[34:46] upon ourselves and start speaking to
[34:48] brothers brother i'm bright i give you
[34:50] that
[34:53] if you do it the way brother branham did
[34:54] you can do it
[34:58] now listen what he said
[35:01] he said that was sovereignly given
[35:04] [Music]
[35:06] i never asked him lord let me do this
[35:08] speak these things in like that do these
[35:10] things there i never asked him that he
[35:12] by his own divine will came to me and
[35:15] said you go do this
[35:17] [Music]
[35:19] see i wasn't asking one thing about it
[35:21] moses never asked to go down to egypt
[35:23] but was god that sent him down to egypt
[35:25] see
[35:26] now i believe that the holy spirit would
[35:28] come to me and say in a vision go tell a
[35:30] certain certain person that they're
[35:32] trying to overcome a certain thing and
[35:34] they cannot do it and they're smoking
[35:36] they're drinking they're lying stealing
[35:37] or committing adultery whatever it might
[35:38] be or they got lustful spirit and you
[35:41] just go where they are and say thou
[35:43] spirit come out of there i set the
[35:44] captive free would it take place
[35:46] absolutely yes indeed it absolutely
[35:49] would it take place but now upon my
[35:52] presuming now presume means to adventure
[35:55] without authority
[35:59] this is what happens when we start
[36:00] getting puffed up in ourselves and
[36:02] getting proud
[36:05] and this happens because god honors his
[36:07] word
[36:09] we believe the word of god we speak the
[36:10] word of god we do what the prophet told
[36:12] do and we get the results that god
[36:13] promised
[36:15] and then if we're not careful we begin
[36:18] to attach the results to our person
[36:24] and then that gives us a little courage
[36:26] to do a little presuming the next time
[36:30] and what's harder is if it actually
[36:33] works
[36:37] it gives us a little more courage to
[36:38] presume a little more
[36:40] and to take another step
[36:42] and before long amen we're not even led
[36:44] by the spirit of god we're being led by
[36:46] our own spirit our own desires our own
[36:48] wishes amen and and and that is the
[36:51] setup that'll take us off the word and
[36:53] bring an absolute collapse because god
[36:56] will not let his children continue their
[36:58] end
[37:02] presume means to venture without
[37:03] authority and i'd go down there to help
[37:06] this person i'm just presuming that it'd
[37:08] be all right then i don't know i can
[37:11] call the name of the lord over them i
[37:12] can pray for them do whatever i wish
[37:16] so there's nothing wrong with praying
[37:17] and praying in jesus name and praying
[37:19] the word but to pr to presume this is
[37:22] going to be this way brother and this is
[37:23] absolutely this and
[37:25] don't do that unless god tells you
[37:30] he said if i had my own ways this
[37:32] morning i just had an interview with
[37:34] this little lady sitting here in the
[37:35] wheelchair to come to this meeting today
[37:37] they had to have the fire department
[37:38] take her out of her house in chicago and
[37:40] people live across the street and don't
[37:42] come to the meeting see
[37:44] what would i do if it was my power if i
[37:46] i have the authority to do it but i have
[37:49] to wait for orders to do it i have the
[37:51] authority from god to do it but now when
[37:55] but now when he gives the orders she'd
[37:57] go back home well i know that is the
[37:59] truth i'd just be just as willing to die
[38:02] this morning on that as i'd be anything
[38:04] that's the truth but first you see
[38:07] it's all that no one even jesus himself
[38:09] the son can do nothing in himself but
[38:12] what he seeth the father do that do with
[38:14] the son likewise we know that saint john
[38:17] 5 19 the son does nothing in himself but
[38:19] what he sees the father doing that son
[38:22] will do likewise
[38:29] so we find out now that brother venom is
[38:32] telling us even with the spoken word
[38:33] speaking to a storm speaking god told
[38:36] him say what you want amen he didn't
[38:38] even tell him repeat this he put such a
[38:40] power and authority in a human being
[38:42] it's absolutely shocking that he would
[38:44] trust such power in a human being
[38:47] because whatever brother bam said is
[38:48] what would have been because god said it
[38:50] would be that way so he had he had
[38:51] confidence in the character of the man
[38:53] that he was talking to
[38:56] amen but brother bantam even though that
[38:58] happened to him on multiple occasions he
[39:01] would never presume and do that on his
[39:03] own he had so much respect for god and
[39:05] knew amen that that wasn't him that was
[39:08] gone if he just turned around and tried
[39:10] to speak another set of scrolls into
[39:12] existence without it being gone amen
[39:15] it wouldn't have happened it wasn't him
[39:17] and he knew by his own prison presuming
[39:19] he could bring damage to people
[39:23] so
[39:24] so even a gift
[39:27] like that
[39:28] was under the control of god and brother
[39:31] branham wouldn't take any credit for it
[39:34] now even when brother branham would
[39:36] begin to speak about that manifestation
[39:38] of the third pool
[39:40] he said this is how he said it
[39:42] god can create squirrels
[39:46] who created
[39:48] whose lips spoke the words brother
[39:50] branham's
[39:51] is that right
[39:53] but brother branham never said he
[39:55] created anything he always said god
[39:57] created squirrels and god made a
[39:59] squirrel and god created squirrels and
[40:01] god did in god he never took the credit
[40:03] upon himself he knew who had the power
[40:05] to create it wasn't him amen but god was
[40:08] honoring his words because god gave him
[40:10] the power and the authority and the time
[40:12] to do it and when he spoke god brought
[40:15] the squirrel to existence brother
[40:16] branham didn't bring that squirrel to
[40:17] existence god did
[40:19] but he honored the obedience of that
[40:21] prophet and he honored that prophet's
[40:22] faith
[40:25] so brother madam was good at keeping the
[40:26] categories right
[40:29] he was very good at keeping himself in
[40:31] position
[40:32] amen
[40:34] i
[40:35] i don't know
[40:36] what kind of human being i would be if
[40:38] god had trusted me with those kind of
[40:40] gifts and those kind of experiences amen
[40:43] to be able but brother bram said it it's
[40:45] amazing how god can give to man and he
[40:47] can stay a man and not become some
[40:49] superhuman or become a god to himself
[40:52] and that was brother branham
[40:54] and you wonder why god got somebody with
[40:56] such a difficult background with such a
[40:58] humble beginning with such a poor
[41:00] education and and and all of these
[41:03] things with no backing and no ability
[41:04] and rejection all through his life amen
[41:06] because god had to get somebody who
[41:09] could handle that kind of power and
[41:11] never become inflated in the self amen
[41:13] and give all glory to god
[41:16] and he did and i thank god for it
[41:22] in the message
[41:23] communion from 1957 brother bam says now
[41:26] if god did not spare his own son from
[41:28] the cruel testing
[41:29] then he will not spare you or i from
[41:31] cruel testings
[41:33] and jesus was here confronting the
[41:35] greatest test that he had ever had
[41:36] gethsemane laid just before him where
[41:39] that once and final all-sufficient test
[41:41] must come
[41:42] when the burdens of the entire world
[41:44] laid upon his blessed shoulders there
[41:46] was no one all heaven or earth could
[41:48] ever stood but him
[41:50] and to know that all of the sins of past
[41:52] and present and future sins rested upon
[41:54] this decision and it was one of the
[41:56] greatest victories that christ ever won
[41:59] or proved his great messiahship as when
[42:02] he said to god not my will thine be done
[42:07] i
[42:08] i love that sentence
[42:11] one of the greatest victories that
[42:13] christ ever won are proved his great
[42:16] messiahship
[42:17] was when he said to god not my will
[42:21] thine be done
[42:23] that was the greatest victory he'd ever
[42:25] won all the demons of torment was around
[42:28] to tempt him and try him
[42:31] gethsemane was jesus christ victory
[42:36] gethsemane is where he wrestled with his
[42:38] own desire in his own will amen versus
[42:42] the will of god amen he knew the will of
[42:44] god because he told him before the
[42:46] disciples what was going to happen
[42:48] so he knew the will of god but in
[42:50] gethsemane he's wrestling asking god if
[42:53] there's another way brother memphis said
[42:55] he didn't want to die being a man he
[42:56] didn't want to die he didn't want to
[42:57] leave the disciples he loved them all of
[42:59] these reasons he's asking god three
[43:01] times can this cup but pass me amen but
[43:04] his victory was in gethsemane when he
[43:07] says not my will but thy will be done
[43:10] that's where he won the battle that's
[43:13] where he labored that's where he worked
[43:15] the works of god that's where he
[43:17] overcame
[43:19] but when it came to calvary he didn't do
[43:21] anything
[43:23] he already won in gethsemane
[43:27] now god was going to take a surrendered
[43:29] vessel
[43:30] and allow demon forces anointed of evil
[43:33] to fulfill god's plan where now jesus
[43:36] isn't asked to scourge himself he's not
[43:38] asked to nail himself to a cross he's
[43:39] not asked to spit on himself or rip his
[43:42] beard out or beat himself he's not asked
[43:43] to do any of that all he had to do was
[43:45] surrender god did the rest and god took
[43:48] his lamb and turned it over to the
[43:50] authority of the high priest the high
[43:52] priest turned it over to rome amen rome
[43:54] then sacrificed the sacrifice of god
[43:57] amen and all he had to do to win that
[44:00] great victory was nothing
[44:04] was
[44:07] i surrendered god what do i have to do
[44:09] to win this great victory
[44:11] surrender
[44:13] surrender to what brother chad
[44:16] surrender to the word that has been
[44:18] given to us
[44:22] the apostle paul
[44:24] in multiple places in the scripture
[44:25] calls himself a prisoner of jesus christ
[44:29] paul the prisoner of jesus christ and we
[44:32] know this has a dual meaning he's
[44:33] actually imprisoned for the gospel and
[44:35] he's also imprisoned himself by by bonds
[44:38] of love to jesus christ he was a
[44:40] prisoner of jesus christ
[44:43] he goes on to say in galatians chapter 2
[44:45] verse 20
[44:46] i am crucified with christ
[44:49] nevertheless i live
[44:51] yet not i
[44:52] but christ liveth in me
[44:55] and the life which i now live in the
[44:57] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[44:59] god who loved me and gave himself for me
[45:03] he was a love slave to jesus christ he
[45:05] was bound to christ in chains of love he
[45:07] was a prisoner of jesus christ and he
[45:09] was crucified with christ's meaning he
[45:11] he gave up his own life amen his own
[45:14] mind his own will his own desire and we
[45:17] know this because the apostle paul tells
[45:18] us what he was aiming for and what what
[45:21] his accomplishments were and where he
[45:23] came from and what his zeal was all
[45:24] about but he gave all of it up amen to
[45:27] be a prisoner of jesus christ and to be
[45:29] crucified with christ and he said
[45:31] nevertheless i live but not i it's not
[45:33] me now living because paul's dead paul
[45:35] couldn't do anything now it's the life
[45:37] of jesus christ that's living in me
[45:40] it wasn't paul that won all those
[45:42] victories it was christ
[45:45] it wasn't paul amen it was christ
[45:48] working through paul
[45:51] brother mum says in the unfailing
[45:52] realities of the living god
[45:54] it says what can you give
[45:56] god will receive what you'll give but
[45:58] god wants all of you
[46:01] he wants every bit of you he wants all
[46:03] he wants everything you are he wants
[46:05] your life he wants your testimony he
[46:07] wants every minute you live he wants you
[46:09] to live right act right talk right do
[46:11] right he wants everything perfectly
[46:13] surrendered to him that he can lead you
[46:16] and guide you and put you into places
[46:19] where he wants you to go lead of the
[46:21] spirit
[46:23] you know what god's not looking for he's
[46:25] not looking for your great wisdom and
[46:27] that analysis and ability to analyze the
[46:30] world around you and figure out which is
[46:32] the best method to move forward
[46:35] what's the best thing to do amen
[46:38] uh what's the best thing to do uh with a
[46:41] job now let me look into the future and
[46:43] see how jobs are going all this is the
[46:45] best job to have and this is the best
[46:47] way to hedge myself against an economic
[46:49] downturn and this that's all your own
[46:52] intellect amen god will let that fail so
[46:55] that you don't get so comfortable in
[46:57] yourself amen because the children of
[46:58] god are to be led by the spirit of god
[47:01] not their intellect not their reasoning
[47:02] not their skill amen they're supposed to
[47:05] lay all that down and say god i want
[47:07] your leadership amen if i make the wrong
[47:10] decision if you lead me it's the right
[47:12] decision
[47:18] amen the worst time in the world to buy
[47:20] a house is when the market's high the
[47:22] best times when it's low
[47:24] unless god tells you to move then the
[47:26] best time to buy a house is when the
[47:27] market's high
[47:32] hey
[47:34] amen
[47:36] we got to get away from this whole idea
[47:38] of human ability
[47:40] got to get away with all this analytics
[47:42] and analyzing and reasoning and just say
[47:45] god i can't help myself on my best day i
[47:49] was a i i you know
[47:52] i almost use words you shouldn't use it
[47:54] in the pulpit
[47:55] i'll just say a big dummy
[47:58] the best i've ever been is a big dummy
[48:03] what i need is that divine leadership i
[48:05] need leadership in the word i need to
[48:06] know when to move what you want me to do
[48:08] how to do by your word amen not by
[48:11] analyzing not by uh listening to pundits
[48:14] not by all of this i mean we need to
[48:16] shut all of that off and say god i'm
[48:18] picking my foot up where do i put it
[48:19] down
[48:26] praise be to god
[48:30] brother banh said in the anointed ones
[48:32] at the end time and i just want you to
[48:34] catch
[48:35] the the attitude of the prophet
[48:38] so now i want you to know this is sure
[48:40] and you that listens to this tape you
[48:42] might have thought today that i was
[48:43] trying to say that about myself but that
[48:46] being that i was packing this message
[48:48] i have no more to do with it than
[48:50] nothing
[48:51] no more than just a voice and my voice
[48:54] even against my better judgment
[48:56] i wanted to be a trapper but it's the
[48:58] will of my father that i declared to do
[49:00] and i determined to do
[49:02] i wasn't the one that appeared down on
[49:04] the river i was only standing there when
[49:06] he appeared
[49:07] i'm not the one that performs these
[49:09] things and foretells these things that
[49:10] happens as perfect they are i'm only one
[49:12] that's near when he does it
[49:15] i was only a voice that he used to say
[49:17] it it wasn't what i knew it's what i
[49:20] just surrendered myself to that he spoke
[49:22] through it isn't me it wasn't the
[49:25] seventh angel oh no it was the
[49:27] manifestation of the son of man it
[49:29] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[49:31] mystery that god unfolded it's not a man
[49:34] it's god
[49:36] here comes the prophet of god and he
[49:38] says you might have thought you might
[49:39] you could get the impression that i was
[49:41] talking about me because i'm the vessel
[49:44] amen that that the message is coming
[49:46] through but i have no more to do with it
[49:48] than nothing just a voice and it gives
[49:50] my better judgment i didn't even want to
[49:52] go this way god brought me this way it's
[49:54] not my doing it's all god's doings
[49:57] brother branham comes to the end of the
[49:59] seals preaching the seals and he says
[50:01] that was the most spiritual time of his
[50:03] ministry
[50:06] not miracles preaching the seals
[50:09] the opening of the
[50:10] word the third pool
[50:14] and he comes to the end of the seals and
[50:16] he says now don't say thank you to any
[50:19] man
[50:21] remember that
[50:22] he said now don't say thank you he wants
[50:24] the people to know this has nothing to
[50:27] do with me if it wasn't for him meeting
[50:29] in me in that room every day i'd have
[50:31] got every one of these seals wrong when
[50:34] he comes to the end of the seals don't
[50:35] come up and say well brother branham
[50:37] thank you for those messages brother bam
[50:39] says i didn't have anything to do with
[50:40] that that wasn't my mind that wasn't my
[50:43] ability to read the bible amen that
[50:45] wasn't my scholarly intellect from
[50:47] reading larkin and reading a white and
[50:49] all of these other he said i would have
[50:51] totally ruined the seals if he hadn't
[50:53] come and met me every day
[50:55] [Music]
[51:00] so when we get to the end of the don't
[51:02] say thank you brother brown
[51:05] thank god
[51:07] thank god
[51:09] so he's he's putting himself in the
[51:11] right place
[51:14] i think we need to keep ourselves in the
[51:15] right place
[51:19] let's turn to matthew chapter 7 together
[51:40] matthew chapter 7 verse 21.
[51:50] not everyone that sayeth unto me lord
[51:52] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[51:53] heaven
[51:54] but he that doeth the will of my father
[51:56] which is in heaven
[51:59] many will say to me in that day lord
[52:00] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[52:03] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[52:06] in thy name done many wonderful works
[52:08] and then will i profess unto them i
[52:10] never knew you depart from me
[52:12] ye that work iniquity
[52:15] that therefore whosoever heareth these
[52:17] sayings of mine and doeth them
[52:19] i will liken him into a wise man which
[52:21] built his house upon a rock
[52:23] and the rain descended and the floods
[52:25] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[52:27] that house and it fell not for it was
[52:29] founded upon a rock
[52:31] and everyone that heareth these things
[52:32] and mine and doeth them not shall be
[52:34] likened unto a foolish man which built
[52:36] his house upon the sand
[52:38] and the rain descended and the floods
[52:40] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[52:42] the house and it fell
[52:44] and great was the fall thereof
[52:47] the difference between the houses
[52:50] was not the material
[52:54] not the method of construction
[52:57] not the value of the material or how
[52:58] well they were put together
[53:00] the difference into those houses was one
[53:02] was founded on the word and one was not
[53:08] the one that fell could have been more
[53:10] valuable could have been
[53:11] better built with better material more
[53:14] costly goods it could have more
[53:15] conveniences amen
[53:18] amen it's just like our house you can
[53:20] have one house that's modest we could be
[53:23] one of us that's very modest in our ways
[53:25] we don't have many gifts we don't we're
[53:26] not endued with a lot of talent amen we
[53:29] can't sing we don't look good we're not
[53:30] a good speaker we don't have this that
[53:32] or the other amen we're just kind of um
[53:35] just there you know we just average joe
[53:39] then you can have another one among us i
[53:41] mean they can sing they can sing and
[53:43] play amen they can they're wise they're
[53:45] good at their work they're very skilled
[53:48] everything just falls into their hand
[53:50] one house is beautiful the other house
[53:52] is just average amen but it doesn't
[53:54] matter so much about the abilities amen
[53:57] what matters is the foundation what's
[53:59] underneath the one that's founded on the
[54:01] word will stand amen you can have ten to
[54:04] one gifts in the other one but if it's
[54:06] not based on the word that house that
[54:09] life is going to fall to ruin at some
[54:12] point it'll get off track and it'll
[54:14] collapse in the storms of life but
[54:16] you've got one house here one person
[54:18] that will withstand every storm that
[54:20] comes not
[54:23] not because of how well they're built
[54:25] the gifts and the abilities they have
[54:26] the material that's in them the genetics
[54:28] amen they're standing because they're on
[54:30] the rock amen
[54:34] and it's us we can stand when we're on
[54:36] the rock not how gifted we are or how
[54:39] much we do for the lord amen there's
[54:41] nothing else we can do for the lord but
[54:43] what he's purposed before for us to do
[54:47] so it's not the amount of works that are
[54:49] going to amount to anything it's the
[54:51] amount of surrender to the will of god
[54:53] that's going to win the day
[54:56] from the beginning of this passage we
[54:58] were reading in verse 21 he says many
[55:00] will come to me in that day and say lord
[55:02] lord have we not amen in the list of
[55:05] things that they claim to have done are
[55:07] amazing
[55:09] let's look at them
[55:11] verse 22
[55:14] it says
[55:16] we have we not prophesied in thy name
[55:18] now listen i've said this many times
[55:20] before but it's worth noting again when
[55:22] you come to the white throne judgment
[55:24] nobody's lying
[55:26] nobody's standing nobody's at the white
[55:29] zone judgment trying to bluff god
[55:32] [Music]
[55:33] all right so nobody these statements are
[55:35] not untrue statements in fact it's
[55:37] through the fence they're making a
[55:39] defense at the white throne judgment
[55:40] before christ then they say lord have we
[55:43] not prophesied he's saying you know we
[55:45] prophesied
[55:47] and jesus never denies any of these
[55:49] claims
[55:51] have we not prophesied
[55:53] in thy name and in thy name have cast
[55:56] out devils
[55:57] and then thy name have done many
[55:59] wonderful works
[56:02] jesus wasn't impressed with the
[56:04] multitude of works
[56:08] he said depart from me ye that work
[56:09] iniquity
[56:12] iniquity
[56:13] is to know to do something and not do it
[56:20] see the deception
[56:22] they're standing in the white throne
[56:23] judgment they've deceived themselves
[56:27] they're pleading their
[56:28] case before the lord at the white throne
[56:31] judgment lord have we not you can't cast
[56:34] us away because we've prophesied in thy
[56:36] name we've cast out devils listen
[56:38] friends if you prophesy in his name
[56:41] and it comes to pass and you cast out
[56:43] devils and they go and you do many
[56:45] wonderful works it is easy for you to
[56:47] believe that you're okay
[56:50] is that right
[56:52] that's why it's a fallacy to look to
[56:55] manifestations and gifts as a
[56:57] justification amen
[57:00] is that right the charismatic world is
[57:02] full of them
[57:03] but it's not a justification
[57:06] it's not a declaration that you're a son
[57:08] of god
[57:09] man what declares me as the son of god
[57:11] what's my evidence of the new birth amen
[57:13] that i go all the way with the word amen
[57:15] with the word
[57:18] so here they
[57:20] listen i mean
[57:22] it's it's easy for self-deception
[57:25] when you prophesy in his name cast out
[57:28] devils and do many wonderful works
[57:31] but yet they were not fully obeying the
[57:34] word
[57:36] because it said depart from me ye that
[57:38] work iniquity
[57:41] iniquity is to transgress the law
[57:46] so
[57:47] they were not keeping the full word
[57:50] but had the boldness to plead their case
[57:54] to the lord of glory and say lord have
[57:57] we not this down they were deceived
[57:59] themselves they thought it was okay not
[58:01] to keep the full word and they looked at
[58:04] the signs and wonders as justification
[58:06] that they were fine with god even though
[58:08] they were transgressing the word
[58:14] i say god help us
[58:17] you know
[58:18] sometimes the blessings that we have in
[58:20] our life are not even because of us
[58:24] sometimes the blessings we have in our
[58:25] life are because of the previous
[58:26] generation
[58:28] brother ram told us that
[58:30] he talked to a man who was greatly
[58:32] blessed and and he said he says you seem
[58:35] to be blessed and the man said yeah i'm
[58:36] blessed don't even know why and he says
[58:38] because your parents were missionaries
[58:41] god has blessed you in business god is
[58:43] blessed
[58:44] so sometimes we look at our blessings
[58:47] and the things god does for us as proof
[58:49] that god loves us and that we're okay
[58:51] with god amen you're never okay with god
[58:54] unless you're standing on his word
[58:55] unless you're submitted to his word
[58:57] unless you're surrendered to his word
[59:00] so many of our blessings we think is
[59:02] because we're doing right and we don't
[59:03] know how many of his blessings is simply
[59:06] because the generation that was before
[59:08] us
[59:08] sacrificed for the word of god gave all
[59:11] for the word and now those blessings are
[59:13] pouring down to the next generation and
[59:15] we think it's because we're special
[59:16] people it wasn't because we're special
[59:18] people it's because the generation
[59:19] before sacrificed all for the word
[59:23] they were kicked out of churches they
[59:25] were laughed at
[59:26] and by their denomination and then they
[59:28] went without even having a church and
[59:30] starting home groups and all of that
[59:31] amen god blessed them in the generation
[59:34] below because of their sacrifices
[59:38] he said depart from me
[59:40] he didn't say depart from me you liars
[59:45] depart from me that work iniquity
[59:53] i said god help us
[59:56] more than anything
[59:58] i want to have the right perspective
[1:00:02] on the word i want to see
[1:00:04] the bible the way the bible's written
[1:00:08] not the way i feel about it
[1:00:12] not what generationally has been taught
[1:00:14] incorrect in denominationalism
[1:00:17] but i want to come back to the true
[1:00:19] revelation of the word and line my life
[1:00:21] up to that
[1:00:23] i want my security to come from a
[1:00:25] personal relationship with jesus christ
[1:00:27] the revealed word in this day
[1:00:29] and i want to see that he's given me the
[1:00:32] ability to surrender to the word and i
[1:00:34] don't want to be walking around with an
[1:00:36] iniquity
[1:00:38] knowing the prophet taught it this way
[1:00:40] but i'm ignoring that knowing that the
[1:00:42] word says this but look we're blessed
[1:00:44] god's still loving me god's still good
[1:00:46] to me amen don't you go one more day
[1:00:49] like that amen don't you step one step
[1:00:51] further like that if you know there's an
[1:00:53] iniquity in your life if you know
[1:00:55] there's something in your life not
[1:00:56] lining up to the message of the hour
[1:00:58] amen you say god forgive me for that and
[1:01:00] give me the power to line to that word
[1:01:03] don't look to your blessings and your
[1:01:04] good job in your home and your healings
[1:01:06] amen and say i'm fine with god you're
[1:01:08] not fine with god amen if there's
[1:01:10] iniquity there if you know to do
[1:01:12] something and you're not doing it amen
[1:01:14] don't go one day further thinking you're
[1:01:17] fine
[1:01:20] i warn you in the name of jesus christ
[1:01:23] this is your opportunity
[1:01:27] you could be blessed because of your
[1:01:29] parents
[1:01:30] you could be blessed because of your
[1:01:32] respect for the children of god
[1:01:35] you could be blessed because of your
[1:01:36] tithes and offerings
[1:01:38] but that still doesn't mean you're right
[1:01:44] brother branham says in the message one
[1:01:46] in a million
[1:01:47] he says let me give you a shocking
[1:01:49] something not all that saith unto me
[1:01:51] lord lord will enter in but the one that
[1:01:53] doeth the will of my father
[1:01:56] his will is his word
[1:01:58] [Music]
[1:02:00] that's what jesus says
[1:02:02] this is he's reading right out of the
[1:02:04] scripture verse 21 not everyone that
[1:02:06] saith me lord lord shall enter in but he
[1:02:09] in the kingdom of heaven but he that
[1:02:11] doeth the will of my father so how can i
[1:02:14] ensure that i will enter into the
[1:02:16] kingdom of heaven to do the will of the
[1:02:18] father what is the will of the father it
[1:02:21] is the word amen what word if you want
[1:02:24] to know what word it's the word that has
[1:02:26] been restored in this generation that
[1:02:28] has been given to us amen we don't talk
[1:02:30] about the message amen as a title for
[1:02:33] our group the message is the word of god
[1:02:36] that has been restored to us and it is
[1:02:38] subject to be lived by amen
[1:02:41] it is our commandments for life it is
[1:02:43] our instructions for pleasing the lord
[1:02:45] it is the word that has been unveiled in
[1:02:47] our day and the scriptures that have
[1:02:49] been restored in our lives amen it is
[1:02:51] everything to us it's not a title for a
[1:02:54] church it's not a title for a system of
[1:02:56] belief it is the word of god
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:05] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:03:08] his will is his word
[1:03:09] we can be ever so religious
[1:03:12] have great time shouting jumping in
[1:03:14] these meetings which i i don't want to
[1:03:17] be critical but i have a duty to to do
[1:03:20] to god and that duty is to be sincere
[1:03:22] and say what he wants me to say i'm
[1:03:24] certainly grateful for the california
[1:03:26] chapter who has bore with me in my
[1:03:27] convictions if i don't speak my
[1:03:29] convictions i'm a hypocrite and now i'm
[1:03:31] not even honest with you and if i can't
[1:03:33] be honest with you how will i
[1:03:36] how
[1:03:37] will i be honest with god because i see
[1:03:39] you and talk to you of course we do to
[1:03:41] god too but we we got to be really
[1:03:44] sincere and honest with one another we
[1:03:46] are certainly in a horrible horrible age
[1:03:48] and did you ever stop just let me give
[1:03:50] you just a little analysis not all that
[1:03:52] saith unto me lord lord will enter
[1:03:54] therein but one that doeth the will of
[1:03:56] my father jesus said on earth man shall
[1:03:58] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:04:00] word every word not just now and then a
[1:04:03] word but by every word
[1:04:06] it was one word misbelieved by god god's
[1:04:09] commandments that caused death sorrow
[1:04:11] every sickness and heartache to miss
[1:04:13] god's word one word if he taken the
[1:04:15] human race into death by missing
[1:04:18] misbelieving one word surely surely but
[1:04:21] he said it would happen satan said
[1:04:22] surely it won't but it did
[1:04:25] so we've got to keep every word of god
[1:04:28] and if the human and all his suffering
[1:04:30] and things that went on the human race
[1:04:32] by misconstruing or misbelieving one
[1:04:34] word how we going back by missing one if
[1:04:37] it cost all this price even the life of
[1:04:40] his son
[1:04:44] what's the point of restoring the word
[1:04:46] if we don't live the word
[1:04:49] the point of restoring the word
[1:04:52] was so that we would know what the word
[1:04:54] says that all that's been misconstrued
[1:04:57] and all that's been discombobulated
[1:04:59] through the thousands of years of man's
[1:05:02] reasonings god has brought it all back
[1:05:04] to the truth and brought it all back to
[1:05:06] life not to talk about but to live
[1:05:10] not to say god restored the truth but
[1:05:12] when god restored the truth he restored
[1:05:14] the truth for us to submit and surrender
[1:05:17] to that truth to live it to manifest it
[1:05:19] to subject ourselves to it
[1:05:25] he says here
[1:05:27] his word is always the truth
[1:05:29] always the truth his believing children
[1:05:31] believe for and cry for it until his
[1:05:33] word is vindicated
[1:05:35] and his word is always his will
[1:05:37] if you want to know what the will of god
[1:05:39] is find it in the bible it's god's word
[1:05:43] anything contrary to it is perverted and
[1:05:45] don't get into that hybrid condition
[1:05:47] that god said that's the truth
[1:05:50] we quoted jesus from john 14 15 last
[1:05:54] time he said if you love me
[1:05:56] keep my commandments
[1:05:59] pretty simple scripture
[1:06:01] jesus i love you he said if you love me
[1:06:03] keep my commandments
[1:06:05] oh god i love you so much if you love me
[1:06:08] keep my commandments
[1:06:10] and i i we we talked about last sunday
[1:06:13] we read where the apostle paul says if
[1:06:15] anybody spiritual among you let him
[1:06:17] acknowledge that the things i write unto
[1:06:18] you are the commandments of the lord
[1:06:21] so now we're not just talking about the
[1:06:22] four gospels
[1:06:24] now we're talking about the first church
[1:06:25] age messenger
[1:06:27] he gave the commandments of the lord too
[1:06:29] [Music]
[1:06:31] what about those things that brother ben
[1:06:32] and restored and taught out of the
[1:06:33] scriptures what are those
[1:06:36] the commandments of the lord
[1:06:38] [Music]
[1:06:39] if you love me
[1:06:40] keep my commandments
[1:06:46] i want to read just a couple examples
[1:06:49] from scripture just to highlight what
[1:06:50] i'm talking about let's look together in
[1:06:51] luke chapter 5.
[1:06:53] very simple example but i want to show
[1:06:55] the power of it
[1:06:59] luke chapter
[1:07:13] luke five five verse three
[1:07:18] and he entered into one of the ships
[1:07:20] which was simon's and prayed him that he
[1:07:22] should thrust out a little from the land
[1:07:24] he sat down and taught the people out of
[1:07:26] the ship
[1:07:27] now when he had left speaking he said
[1:07:28] unto simon launch out into the deep and
[1:07:31] let down your nets for a draw
[1:07:33] and simon answering said unto him master
[1:07:35] we have toiled all night and have taken
[1:07:38] nothing
[1:07:41] i love this
[1:07:43] nevertheless at thy word
[1:07:46] i will let down the net
[1:07:49] jesus was a carpenter's son
[1:07:54] peter was a fisherman
[1:07:56] by generations
[1:07:59] prophet tells us his father was a
[1:08:00] fisherman
[1:08:02] he was a generational fisherman who grew
[1:08:04] up all his life in the sea of galilee
[1:08:07] fishing for a living
[1:08:10] he was the expert fisherman
[1:08:13] he knew the sea he knew the times he
[1:08:15] knew the habits of the fish he knew the
[1:08:17] way to catch him he knew it all
[1:08:20] jesus as they knew him at that time was
[1:08:22] the son of a carpenter
[1:08:25] amen who may not even stayed long enough
[1:08:27] in the trade to learn at all
[1:08:31] but now he's there speaking and he has
[1:08:33] to use simon's ship and they thrust out
[1:08:35] a little bit he teaches and afterwards
[1:08:36] he said thrust out and let down thy net
[1:08:39] and simon says
[1:08:40] lord you know we've toiled all night and
[1:08:42] caught nothing
[1:08:44] i'm the expert you don't know the sea
[1:08:48] you don't know the fishing you don't
[1:08:49] know
[1:08:50] but at thy word
[1:08:53] at thy word
[1:08:56] i will let down the net
[1:08:58] and when they had this done they they
[1:09:00] enclosed a great multitude of fishes in
[1:09:02] their net
[1:09:04] break
[1:09:05] and they beckoned into their partners
[1:09:06] which were in the other ship these are
[1:09:08] other fishermen experts
[1:09:11] that were in the other ship and they
[1:09:12] should come and help them and they came
[1:09:14] and filled both ships so that they began
[1:09:17] to sink
[1:09:19] i think this is hilarious amen and i
[1:09:21] think it's written this way for a reason
[1:09:23] amen that it will draw attention this is
[1:09:26] extreme amen
[1:09:27] these were fishermen their boats were
[1:09:30] built to catch fish they every night and
[1:09:33] every day we're catching fish to bring
[1:09:35] the market they were experts the tackle
[1:09:37] was correct the boats were correct
[1:09:39] everything was set up for them to be
[1:09:41] commercial fishermen to make their
[1:09:43] living fishing
[1:09:45] and they had they had toiled all night
[1:09:47] and got nothing by their own skill their
[1:09:49] own ability their generational
[1:09:51] understanding by their experiences in
[1:09:53] life amen with their equipment and their
[1:09:55] tackle and their boats and everything
[1:09:57] that they had amen they caught nothing
[1:09:59] but at the word of jesus christ who was
[1:10:02] the word he said let down your nets for
[1:10:04] a draw he said lord we've caught nothing
[1:10:05] but at thy word we'll set down their
[1:10:07] nets and god does something in such an
[1:10:09] extreme way so that we get the picture
[1:10:12] amen the net which they had built was
[1:10:15] built for a commercial fisherman that
[1:10:17] net contained so many fish it began to
[1:10:19] break
[1:10:22] two boats two boats not one boat two
[1:10:24] boats that were set up as commercial
[1:10:26] fishing vessels took in so many fish
[1:10:29] they began to sink
[1:10:32] what is the point of the story the point
[1:10:34] of the story is forget everything you
[1:10:36] ever knew and follow his word amen
[1:10:39] forget what you knew forget your
[1:10:41] experiences forget all your
[1:10:42] understanding cast it all away and say
[1:10:45] lord at thy word i will do what you say
[1:10:48] do
[1:10:50] amen
[1:10:52] the whole world teaches amen in the
[1:10:55] united states that you need two incomes
[1:10:57] two working parents amen two working to
[1:10:59] make it but the brother branham said
[1:11:01] upon the word of god that a woman is to
[1:11:04] be a keeper at home you can just say i
[1:11:06] believe it in the name of jesus christ
[1:11:08] i'll take it as truth
[1:11:11] and watch the net break
[1:11:15] man there's no it's not wrong if a
[1:11:16] woman's willing brother brandon made
[1:11:18] exceptions for it even he even commended
[1:11:20] two women who were working
[1:11:22] and he says those women are working in a
[1:11:23] factory up here
[1:11:25] and god bless them they're holding their
[1:11:26] testimony there while they're helping
[1:11:27] their husbands so you're not we're not
[1:11:29] condemning you if you have to work
[1:11:32] but the whole world says you can't make
[1:11:34] it
[1:11:38] is that right the whole world says you
[1:11:40] can't make it
[1:11:42] your kids won't have enough stuff
[1:11:46] the stuff that's frying their brains and
[1:11:48] ruining their lives
[1:11:52] but the word of god
[1:11:55] then the prophet comes and backs it up
[1:11:56] and teaches us
[1:11:58] that a mother needs to be home with
[1:12:00] those little children
[1:12:02] and not according to my reasoning
[1:12:05] and not based off my intellect or what
[1:12:07] the world says but based off the word of
[1:12:09] god we'll believe what the prophet said
[1:12:12] and see what god will do
[1:12:15] amen i don't say that in any disrespect
[1:12:18] for a sister who finds yourself working
[1:12:20] god brother brandon made exceptions he
[1:12:22] he said there's reasons there's times
[1:12:25] if you find yourself in that then it's
[1:12:27] in the message
[1:12:29] but i'm talking about in general
[1:12:33] in general
[1:12:35] i remember i told you the story before
[1:12:37] but i remember when we had little
[1:12:39] children you know i we didn't have much
[1:12:42] so i packed my lunch every day everybody
[1:12:45] i worked with they bought lunch we were
[1:12:47] field technicians that were usually out
[1:12:49] and so
[1:12:50] i would pack my lunch i had my little
[1:12:52] igloo cooler and
[1:12:53] angie would pack it all in there and i'd
[1:12:55] go to work and and
[1:12:57] and all the guys they wanted to go out
[1:12:58] to these restaurants for lunch they want
[1:13:00] to go here and they wanted to go there
[1:13:01] and eat and and i would ask at the door
[1:13:04] can i bring my lunch in and eat my lunch
[1:13:06] with these guys and they would get so
[1:13:08] embarrassed to me
[1:13:09] actually the guys i worked with they got
[1:13:11] mad at me
[1:13:13] and one man said to me one time he says
[1:13:14] why don't you put that woman of yours to
[1:13:16] work
[1:13:21] amen
[1:13:22] i didn't even get mad at him
[1:13:24] praise god that was a victory in itself
[1:13:30] i don't remember what i said to him i
[1:13:32] don't remember how the conversation went
[1:13:33] but i remember i was shocked more than
[1:13:35] anything at what he said but i wasn't
[1:13:37] angry with him because i knew he didn't
[1:13:38] understand
[1:13:40] but i thank god for every bologna
[1:13:43] sandwich i ate
[1:13:45] because of what it did for my family
[1:13:48] and the character in my children and the
[1:13:50] life that they were able to live at home
[1:13:53] i don't regret a one amen
[1:13:55] i don't regret a time that i took my
[1:13:57] little igloo cooler into a restaurant
[1:14:01] and sat down and unpacked at nate where
[1:14:03] all these guys were ordering whatever
[1:14:04] meals they were ordering i don't regret
[1:14:06] it once
[1:14:09] amen because i've seen god honor that
[1:14:12] word and i can say in our family our net
[1:14:15] has broke and then this ship is nearly
[1:14:17] sunk by god blessing that decision
[1:14:22] i even had family members say you know
[1:14:24] you're so lucky your kids are so well
[1:14:25] behaved
[1:14:26] i was like do you know how many bologna
[1:14:28] sandwiches i've eaten
[1:14:32] so that mom's there teaching them every
[1:14:34] day
[1:14:35] i'm not lucky
[1:14:37] you know how many lunches i've missed
[1:14:38] down no it was it was respect and honor
[1:14:40] for the word of god i heard what a
[1:14:42] prophet said and i did it amen
[1:14:45] and god blessed it
[1:14:49] this is such an extreme story
[1:14:52] because i think god means for it to be
[1:14:55] i think he means to get our attention
[1:14:58] that we stop with all this reasoning
[1:15:01] and stop with trying to adapt the
[1:15:03] world's ways and stop with all this well
[1:15:06] you know well this is the way we've
[1:15:08] always done it and come back to what god
[1:15:10] has taught us and say if god taught it
[1:15:12] to us if the prophet taught it there's a
[1:15:14] reason behind it amen and i may not
[1:15:16] always understand it may not match my
[1:15:18] training my understanding my years of
[1:15:20] experience but if brother brennan was
[1:15:22] adamant on and he taught it and he and
[1:15:24] he brought it out of the scripture
[1:15:25] there's a reason behind it and i and i
[1:15:28] if we could say it this way not because
[1:15:30] i fully understand it not because i see
[1:15:32] the whole picture but at thy word i will
[1:15:35] do what the word says
[1:15:39] amen
[1:15:42] praise be to god
[1:15:46] brother branham says in christ is the
[1:15:48] mystery of god revealed he said it's not
[1:15:49] an expression of some church that we
[1:15:51] should express something
[1:15:53] it's a life that you don't live yourself
[1:15:55] but he comes in you
[1:15:56] and lives by himself
[1:15:59] and you become a prisoner to any human
[1:16:01] intellectual being at all you're led by
[1:16:03] the spirit
[1:16:05] you say
[1:16:06] how how do i know i'm led by the spirit
[1:16:10] if you're following the word
[1:16:12] you're led by the spirit
[1:16:14] because the spirit is the life of the
[1:16:16] word
[1:16:18] it says the words i speak unto you they
[1:16:20] are spirit
[1:16:21] and they are life
[1:16:25] brother baby says in the message
[1:16:27] choosing of a bride
[1:16:29] so the other is pregnated by the word of
[1:16:30] god and will bring forth the body the
[1:16:32] finished body of jesus christ which is
[1:16:34] the bride the body of christ isn't
[1:16:36] finished yet how many knows that a man
[1:16:38] and a woman is one and christ is one
[1:16:40] body the word the bride will have to be
[1:16:43] the rest of that body and the two
[1:16:45] together makes one body again
[1:16:47] like adam was at the beginning man and
[1:16:49] his wife are one now she the true bride
[1:16:52] so sold out to him that she uses no mind
[1:16:56] of her own
[1:17:00] his mind of course is his will
[1:17:03] and his will
[1:17:04] is his word
[1:17:08] say god let it be that simple to me
[1:17:11] let it be that simple for me
[1:17:14] that i can just see it in your word and
[1:17:16] say i'll do it lord
[1:17:19] i'll do it i'll do it according to thy
[1:17:22] word i'll do it
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:27] i want to read one more if i can before
[1:17:29] we close out of exodus chapter 7 let's
[1:17:31] turn to exodus chapter 7.
[1:18:02] exodus chapter 7 verse 8
[1:18:06] and the lord spake unto moses and unto
[1:18:08] aaron saying
[1:18:10] when pharaoh shall speak unto you saying
[1:18:11] show a miracle for you
[1:18:13] then thou shalt say unto aaron take thy
[1:18:15] rod and cast it down before pharaoh and
[1:18:17] it shall become a serpent
[1:18:19] and moses and aaron went into pharaoh
[1:18:21] and they did so as the lord had
[1:18:22] commanded and aaron cast down his rod
[1:18:24] before pharaoh and before his servants
[1:18:26] and it became a serpent
[1:18:28] then pharaoh also called the wise men
[1:18:29] and the sorcerers now the magicians of
[1:18:31] egypt they also didn't like manner with
[1:18:33] their enchantments for they cast down
[1:18:36] every man as rod and they became
[1:18:37] serpents but aaron's rod swallowed up
[1:18:40] their rods
[1:18:43] brother makes a statement in the second
[1:18:44] seal he says and no doubt pharaoh said a
[1:18:46] cheap magician trick
[1:18:48] so he goes and gets his janus and
[1:18:50] jamboree says we can do those things too
[1:18:52] and they threw down their sticks and
[1:18:53] they became serpents now what could
[1:18:55] moses do what was it it was to show him
[1:18:58] that every genuine thing of god the
[1:19:00] devil's got an impersonator for him he
[1:19:02] impersonates to throw the people off the
[1:19:04] track
[1:19:05] what did moses do he said well i guess i
[1:19:07] made a mistake
[1:19:08] i better go back he just stood still for
[1:19:11] he had carried out his commission to the
[1:19:14] letter
[1:19:15] then the first thing you know moses
[1:19:17] servant eat up the other ones
[1:19:20] moses all he had was the commandment of
[1:19:23] god
[1:19:24] he wasn't told what would happen he
[1:19:26] didn't know how to handle every
[1:19:27] circumstance that he would face he was
[1:19:29] given a commandment and he knew what
[1:19:31] commandment was and so he took the rod
[1:19:34] in according to what god said and aaron
[1:19:36] took the rod and threw it down and it
[1:19:38] became a serpent that's as far as god
[1:19:40] had explained to him
[1:19:43] but after that something happened that
[1:19:45] moses probably didn't expect
[1:19:48] because moses now is standing upon the
[1:19:50] word of god
[1:19:51] he's doing what god said amen and we
[1:19:53] always expect that when we do what god
[1:19:55] says everything will work out perfect
[1:19:57] amen but we don't understand what's
[1:19:59] coming next amen so he just did what god
[1:20:02] said and something unexpected happened
[1:20:04] now the magicians did the same thing
[1:20:06] that they did
[1:20:08] and now they're rods amen become
[1:20:10] serpents amen brother said what could
[1:20:12] moses do he can't start explaining he
[1:20:15] can't backpedal he can't do anything
[1:20:17] he's standing on the word of god all he
[1:20:19] needs to do is stand still and let god
[1:20:22] keep his word amen
[1:20:23] [Music]
[1:20:25] amen not every time we take the word of
[1:20:27] god we get the results we expect
[1:20:30] amen sometimes if you've not been paying
[1:20:32] your tithe and giving offering the
[1:20:33] commandment the commandments of god says
[1:20:35] pay your tithe and give an offering
[1:20:38] and you'll return he'll return into your
[1:20:40] blessing amen and we expect amen the
[1:20:43] first time i dropped that tithe check in
[1:20:45] amen some great uncle that i didn't know
[1:20:47] about that died is going to die and i'm
[1:20:49] going to get an inheritance but you you
[1:20:51] could very well amen go into a tough
[1:20:53] time financially right afterwards it
[1:20:55] doesn't mean god's not going to bless
[1:20:57] you it doesn't mean god's not going to
[1:20:58] keep his word you don't know what's
[1:21:00] going to happen next but do you stop
[1:21:02] paying tithe no you stay with the word
[1:21:04] of god and let god do the part you can't
[1:21:07] do
[1:21:09] moses stood on the word of god and and
[1:21:11] he didn't know and moses didn't know
[1:21:13] what the solution was
[1:21:15] he didn't know what was going to happen
[1:21:17] next something unexpected happened
[1:21:20] but he stayed with the word
[1:21:22] and eventually that rod that serpent
[1:21:24] swallowed up the other
[1:21:26] serpents moses was probably as surprised
[1:21:30] as the egyptians
[1:21:34] how many times has god worked a
[1:21:35] situation out in your life that amazed
[1:21:37] people around you and you were just as
[1:21:39] amazed as those people were
[1:21:43] i mean we always play it cool like i
[1:21:45] knew god would take care of it
[1:21:46] everything was under control
[1:21:50] well there's times god does things and
[1:21:52] people are like how did that work out
[1:21:53] for you and you're like well you just
[1:21:55] trust god and things work out
[1:21:59] no you were saying i don't know how this
[1:22:00] is going to work out i did what he said
[1:22:02] to do and i don't know why this is
[1:22:03] happening and all of a sudden god works
[1:22:05] out a circumstance and everybody else
[1:22:07] says how did that happen how did you get
[1:22:08] that job how did that promotion come to
[1:22:10] you how did this work out in your life
[1:22:12] and you say i have no idea god did
[1:22:14] something i didn't expect it to go this
[1:22:16] way god at the last minute turned
[1:22:19] everything around and all of a sudden
[1:22:20] look at where we're at i'm just as
[1:22:22] amazed as you are
[1:22:26] god doesn't tell us everything he just
[1:22:27] gives us what we need
[1:22:30] and he'll take care of the rest
[1:22:34] you remember the story of elijah and
[1:22:35] mount cardinal the mount carmel showdown
[1:22:39] he has the showdown with all the
[1:22:41] prophets of bao and they they he does
[1:22:44] they build their altar he builds his
[1:22:46] altar he lays out the wood he douses it
[1:22:48] with water at the last minute and
[1:22:50] there's no way to delight this wood now
[1:22:52] it's been dumped water on it and he's
[1:22:54] got stones in place everything's in
[1:22:56] place the the
[1:22:58] the priest of baal went they've
[1:23:00] completely failed
[1:23:02] now comes time for the evening sacrifice
[1:23:05] it's the right time
[1:23:07] and elisha comes and says
[1:23:08] god
[1:23:10] i've done all this
[1:23:12] at thy word
[1:23:17] elisha had no power to bring fire down
[1:23:20] from heaven
[1:23:22] elisha could put stones together
[1:23:25] he could lay wood in order
[1:23:28] he could put the bullock on the wood
[1:23:31] he could even do what god told him to do
[1:23:33] the unreasonable part was to douse it
[1:23:36] with water
[1:23:37] he could even do that
[1:23:40] but he could not make the fire come down
[1:23:43] only god could do that
[1:23:46] but after elisha had done everything
[1:23:48] that god told him to do the reasonable
[1:23:50] parts and the unreasonable parts
[1:23:54] he stood and he says god i have done all
[1:23:57] this at thy word
[1:23:59] and then when he did the fire came down
[1:24:01] from heaven and consumed the sacrifice
[1:24:04] licked up the water consumed the stones
[1:24:08] that was extreme it needed to be extreme
[1:24:11] so that we would recognize the only way
[1:24:13] to victory is to keep all the word of
[1:24:16] god
[1:24:18] moses could have built an order or
[1:24:19] elijah could have built an altar he
[1:24:21] could have put the sticks in order he
[1:24:22] could have laid the sacrifice on it but
[1:24:24] he could have come to the water and say
[1:24:25] i just don't know about that water part
[1:24:28] why would god ask me to do something
[1:24:30] like that
[1:24:31] it doesn't make any sense that's too
[1:24:33] much that's not reasonable why would god
[1:24:36] require that
[1:24:40] but he did it anyways
[1:24:44] and he said god i've done all this at
[1:24:46] that word
[1:24:48] there's many times especially when i
[1:24:49] first come into the message there's many
[1:24:51] things that i didn't understand why why
[1:24:53] god wanted it this way why why is a
[1:24:56] woman's dress so important because i was
[1:24:57] taught all my life it's what's in the
[1:24:59] heart that matters not what's on the
[1:25:00] outside and there's truth to that
[1:25:03] and and and sometimes we would be
[1:25:06] discussing it my wife would ask me
[1:25:07] questions and a lot of times i don't
[1:25:08] know i don't understand i don't know
[1:25:11] but i know what the prophet taught i
[1:25:13] know what the scripture says
[1:25:15] so we just submitted
[1:25:18] guess what the fire fell in our lives
[1:25:23] when the fire fell in our lives
[1:25:25] for doing what for throwing away makeup
[1:25:30] for kicking out the tv
[1:25:34] why why do i have to kick out the tv
[1:25:37] like couldn't we just moderate and
[1:25:40] but the prophet said kick it out we
[1:25:42] kicked it out
[1:25:45] we but maybe a little this maybe a
[1:25:47] little that
[1:25:48] we were just dumb young foolish enough
[1:25:50] to just take him at his word
[1:25:52] by the grace of god it was god's grace
[1:25:55] in our lives but we just we just did it
[1:25:57] and we didn't always do it right and we
[1:25:58] didn't always do it the first time and
[1:26:00] we didn't always do it perfect amen
[1:26:02] but by the grace of god we'd go around
[1:26:04] the stump again and finally we would
[1:26:06] kick something out and finally we would
[1:26:08] throw this away and finally we would
[1:26:09] line up to that but i'm here to tell you
[1:26:12] that when we kept his word the fire fell
[1:26:14] in our lives
[1:26:15] and burn out the dross and and all of a
[1:26:18] sudden i began to understand the wisdom
[1:26:20] of everything he said amen why it had to
[1:26:22] be that way it was the only way it was
[1:26:24] the perfect way
[1:26:29] amen
[1:26:32] praise god
[1:26:37] brother baby says in christ is the
[1:26:38] mystery of god revealed he says it
[1:26:40] depends on where you're born from
[1:26:42] if you're born of the word of god
[1:26:44] god's word has the preeminence in his
[1:26:46] church
[1:26:48] that's what he died for that's his
[1:26:50] purpose that he might be able to achieve
[1:26:52] to have his preeminence working in his
[1:26:54] church let the word of god shine forth
[1:26:57] first no matter what anything else looks
[1:26:59] like
[1:27:01] if you're born if you're born of the
[1:27:03] word of god
[1:27:04] god's word has preeminence in his church
[1:27:07] if you're born of the word of god the
[1:27:08] word of god will have preeminence
[1:27:11] and he goes on to say
[1:27:13] god needs prisoners today
[1:27:15] that will prison yourself to his will
[1:27:18] to his word
[1:27:20] god's looking for prisoners like paul
[1:27:23] we will prison yourself to his will and
[1:27:25] his will is what
[1:27:26] his word
[1:27:30] he says and god's only provide a place
[1:27:32] of worship and i'll just wrap up with
[1:27:33] this and
[1:27:34] two scriptures
[1:27:36] that every little jaw everything you
[1:27:38] must be faithful and always the little
[1:27:40] vine the little fox that spoils the vine
[1:27:44] sometimes you leave it's not the big
[1:27:46] things that you do it's the little
[1:27:47] things you leave undone
[1:27:49] remember a chain is only as strong as
[1:27:51] its
[1:27:52] weakest link blessed are they that do
[1:27:54] all the commandments of god that they
[1:27:55] might have right to enter in do all god
[1:27:58] said and it said for women to have long
[1:28:00] hair
[1:28:01] you say a man told me not long ago i
[1:28:03] don't preach a close line religion i
[1:28:04] said then you're not preaching the
[1:28:05] gospel
[1:28:07] god laid it out there he said what to do
[1:28:10] and you either do it that's your natural
[1:28:12] reasonable thing
[1:28:14] that little thing that little
[1:28:16] insignificant jesus said blessed are
[1:28:17] they that would take all the little
[1:28:19] things do do the little things
[1:28:22] and a woman to let her hair grow that's
[1:28:23] just why it's just something she can do
[1:28:26] and she won't even do that she won't
[1:28:28] even do that
[1:28:30] oh teach us great things how can i teach
[1:28:32] you the great things when you won't do
[1:28:34] the simple common thing
[1:28:36] because you see
[1:28:38] this is the part that i really want you
[1:28:39] to catch
[1:28:40] because you see your motive and your
[1:28:43] objective is wrong
[1:28:47] what's the big deal about this and this
[1:28:49] he's getting to the big deal
[1:28:51] the big deal is your motive and
[1:28:53] objective is wrong
[1:28:55] you still want
[1:28:57] you still desire
[1:28:59] you still lust for you still want you
[1:29:02] still need you still like
[1:29:06] it's not you say well what's what's with
[1:29:08] this little thing and what's with that
[1:29:10] brother brother said if you do that you
[1:29:12] know how can you teach great things when
[1:29:14] you won't do the simple common things
[1:29:16] because you see your motive and your
[1:29:17] objective is wrong
[1:29:20] now listen what he says next
[1:29:22] it's your love to god lord i don't care
[1:29:24] what you want me to do i'm willing to do
[1:29:27] it
[1:29:28] then you're getting somewhere but if you
[1:29:30] don't do it that way the way he said do
[1:29:32] it
[1:29:34] see it's
[1:29:36] we want to learn brother he's told over
[1:29:38] and over why don't you teach these women
[1:29:39] great things how to prophesy and how to
[1:29:41] have spiritual gifts said how can i
[1:29:43] teach them that when they don't do the
[1:29:44] abcs
[1:29:46] i say that's still true today
[1:29:49] if it was true in his day it's true i
[1:29:52] mean we we can all we want look back at
[1:29:55] the nominations and say they do this and
[1:29:57] do that and do that but you know what
[1:29:59] the message wasn't given to the
[1:30:00] denominations the message was given to
[1:30:02] us
[1:30:04] i say let the scourging of the message
[1:30:06] purify my heart and purge my life
[1:30:10] amen sometimes we we can take such pride
[1:30:13] in understanding what the opening of the
[1:30:14] seals was and what the seventh seal is
[1:30:16] the coming of the lord amen but you can
[1:30:19] say i know what the seventh seal is but
[1:30:22] but you won't dress the way a prophet
[1:30:24] said to dress
[1:30:26] and the question is why i mean why are
[1:30:29] we so comfortable knowing all the great
[1:30:31] mysteries of god but we can't be
[1:30:33] comfortable doing a simple obedience
[1:30:35] that brother branham said is our
[1:30:36] reasonable service
[1:30:39] something you can do you can take the
[1:30:41] high heels off you're the one who buys
[1:30:43] them to put them back on
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:47] remember
[1:30:48] in the message years ago they threw away
[1:30:50] all the high heels
[1:30:53] so they weren't in the house somebody
[1:30:55] bought them again
[1:30:56] [Applause]
[1:30:58] why
[1:31:00] they were already out how did they come
[1:31:03] back in
[1:31:05] how did sexy dress come back in
[1:31:08] how did these things they were already
[1:31:10] kicked out how did they come back in
[1:31:12] amen the little foxes spoil the vine we
[1:31:15] get comfortable that we've heard the
[1:31:16] message we received malachi 4. we got
[1:31:19] all this and that and what we're touting
[1:31:21] malachi 4 little things are slipping
[1:31:23] back in
[1:31:25] our reasonable service is going away
[1:31:30] i
[1:31:31] praise god i received the prophet's
[1:31:33] message i believe in malachi 4. i
[1:31:35] understand what the seventh seal is i
[1:31:37] see this and i see this and this type in
[1:31:39] this shadow amen but the little things
[1:31:42] keep creeping back in
[1:31:47] i think sometimes we get too comfortable
[1:31:50] that we know so much
[1:31:53] but let's not forget our first love when
[1:31:55] we came to the message and was willing
[1:31:56] to throw everything away
[1:31:59] when he first came to the message we was
[1:32:01] willing to let it all go
[1:32:04] let's not forget that
[1:32:06] let's not lose that love that says i'm
[1:32:09] going to i i want to receive all the
[1:32:12] message all the truth the deep things of
[1:32:13] god and keep the little things at the
[1:32:15] same time
[1:32:17] i want to obey
[1:32:23] samuel the prophet says to saul
[1:32:26] after saul disobeys his commandment
[1:32:29] it says in samuel said hath the lord as
[1:32:30] great delight and burn offerings and
[1:32:32] sacrifices
[1:32:33] as in obeying the voice of the lord
[1:32:36] behold
[1:32:37] to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:32:41] and to hearken than the fat of rams
[1:32:44] samuel had disobeyed a prophet's
[1:32:46] commandment and what was his excuse his
[1:32:49] excuse for disobeying was i wanted to
[1:32:52] offer these to god
[1:32:55] i wanted to do god a great service and i
[1:32:57] wanted to keep the best animals amen
[1:32:59] from and god had told them to slay
[1:33:01] everything every beast every animal
[1:33:03] every man woman child slay it all but he
[1:33:05] saved some back and when the prophet
[1:33:07] said why did you disobey he said because
[1:33:10] i wanted to do a service for god i
[1:33:13] wanted to sacrifice these great
[1:33:15] offerings to god and he said is god more
[1:33:17] pleased in your works and your sacrifice
[1:33:20] and your big show or is he pleased in
[1:33:22] obedience
[1:33:24] what pleases god is it the great big
[1:33:27] show and the great big effort and the
[1:33:29] great big sacrifice or is it in
[1:33:31] obedience
[1:33:34] and we know that god replaced saul with
[1:33:37] david
[1:33:39] is that right
[1:33:41] and i want to read a scripture to you
[1:33:42] out of acts 13 it's the last scripture i
[1:33:44] want to read
[1:33:45] acts 13 verse 21 i'll read verse 22 as
[1:33:48] well and afterward they desired a king
[1:33:53] and god gave them unto them saul the son
[1:33:55] of kish a man of the tribe of benjamin
[1:33:59] by the space of forty years
[1:34:01] and when he had removed him he raised up
[1:34:03] unto them david to be their king
[1:34:06] to whom also he gave testimony and said
[1:34:08] i have found david the son of jesse
[1:34:11] a man after mine own heart
[1:34:13] which shall fulfill
[1:34:15] all
[1:34:16] my
[1:34:17] will
[1:34:20] what was it about david that god wanted
[1:34:24] it wasn't his strength because david was
[1:34:26] small
[1:34:28] it wasn't his experience in battle
[1:34:30] because he had none
[1:34:33] it wasn't his stature it wasn't his
[1:34:35] wisdom
[1:34:37] god chose david
[1:34:39] and he contrasted david with saul for
[1:34:41] one reason
[1:34:43] saul would use his own thinking to try
[1:34:45] to serve god
[1:34:48] to go a little bit beyond what the
[1:34:50] prophet said
[1:34:52] and disobey the prophet but he disobeyed
[1:34:54] the prophet for a good reason
[1:34:56] he had a good reason for disobeying the
[1:34:58] prophet
[1:34:59] because the boy i know the prophet said
[1:35:01] that but
[1:35:02] [Applause]
[1:35:04] i'm doing something good
[1:35:11] but he said i chose david who's a man
[1:35:14] after my own heart
[1:35:17] and in sam in the book of samuel it just
[1:35:19] stops there he said i've chose david a
[1:35:21] man after my own heart but in the book
[1:35:22] of acts he adds another statement he
[1:35:24] said a man after in my heart that will
[1:35:26] do all my will
[1:35:32] i'd like to say something to you
[1:35:36] the church ages who were rejected
[1:35:39] were no better than them
[1:35:45] some of them were
[1:35:47] wise intellectual hard-working
[1:35:49] sacrificing
[1:35:52] they were children of god elect do you
[1:35:53] believe that
[1:35:57] but
[1:35:59] they were rejected
[1:36:01] because they put away the word
[1:36:05] we're not better
[1:36:08] because of strength we're not better
[1:36:10] because of intelligence we're not better
[1:36:12] because of gifts
[1:36:16] god is looking for a bride in this day
[1:36:19] that's after his own heart
[1:36:22] and when god was here in flesh the flesh
[1:36:24] of jesus christ
[1:36:26] what was his what was his character like
[1:36:29] what was his main attribute what was it
[1:36:31] made him the most successful amen is
[1:36:34] because he would not do anything of
[1:36:36] himself he would only do what the father
[1:36:38] showed him
[1:36:40] he would he made a complete full
[1:36:43] surrender and a hundred percent
[1:36:44] obedience to the will of god and he
[1:36:47] never took his own way he only took the
[1:36:49] father's way amen and now he's looking
[1:36:52] for a wife after his own heart
[1:36:56] who will be
[1:36:58] christ
[1:37:00] in female form
[1:37:02] he proved his messiahship when he said
[1:37:04] not my will but thine be done how will
[1:37:07] we prove our messiahship
[1:37:11] he proved in the garden of gethsemane
[1:37:13] who he was how will we prove who we are
[1:37:18] by doing the same thing
[1:37:21] by saying god not my will
[1:37:24] but thy will be done
[1:37:26] if this is what you taught
[1:37:28] this is what i want
[1:37:31] if this is how you had it preached
[1:37:33] through the seventh angel then that's
[1:37:35] the way i want to believe it and that's
[1:37:37] the way i want to live it help me god
[1:37:41] not my will but thy will oh god
[1:37:47] david wasn't stronger than saul he
[1:37:48] wasn't taller than saul he wasn't more
[1:37:50] experienced than saul
[1:37:52] but saul was rejected because he took
[1:37:54] his own thinking
[1:37:56] david was chosen because he would do all
[1:37:58] the will
[1:37:59] of god
[1:38:01] we're not smarter
[1:38:02] better looking stronger more capable
[1:38:07] i want to be one that'll do all his will
[1:38:09] [Music]
[1:38:11] god's predestinated us to be that kind
[1:38:13] of people
[1:38:15] let's yield to it and strive to be that
[1:38:17] kind of people
[1:38:18] let's give all of our heart to this word
[1:38:21] it's not my works
[1:38:23] lord i've cast out devils i've done this
[1:38:25] i've done great listen it's easy to
[1:38:28] deceive ourselves we can see
[1:38:30] i mean when you start feeling down you
[1:38:32] start feeling low and all of a sudden
[1:38:33] god does something for you i'm a son of
[1:38:35] god listen i was a son of god before he
[1:38:38] did something for me
[1:38:41] i was a son of god before the
[1:38:43] manifestation i was the son of god
[1:38:44] before the work i was a son of god i've
[1:38:46] always been a son of god
[1:38:48] [Music]
[1:38:50] i don't want to be deceived by those
[1:38:52] things i don't want to deceive myself i
[1:38:54] want to be a son of god who obeys all
[1:38:56] his will amen i want to say not my will
[1:38:58] but thy will be done if you saw fit to
[1:39:01] vindicate this prophet and this prophet
[1:39:03] taught the word this way god help me to
[1:39:05] line to that and forgive me lord for my
[1:39:08] own reasonings

[1:39:18] heart with you and that you can catch
[1:39:20] the heart's desire amen my heart's
[1:39:23] desire amen listen this is so far
[1:39:26] removed from any legalistic idea i hope
[1:39:28] you get that notion far out of your mind
[1:39:30] it has nothing to do with that amen
[1:39:32] legalism is thinking you can attain to
[1:39:34] something by doing something that's
[1:39:36] legalism i can attain to this position
[1:39:38] by doing right you'll never attain to
[1:39:40] nothing unless god's ordained you to be
[1:39:41] in that position
[1:39:43] all the right works will never give you
[1:39:45] anything this isn't legalism this is
[1:39:47] obedience obedience is not legalism
[1:39:51] but the perfect son of god obeyed the
[1:39:53] father
[1:39:55] the daughter of god will obey the father
[1:39:57] today
[1:39:59] christ was submissive his bride will be
[1:40:01] submissive

[1:40:15] am i
[1:40:17] who am i what am i
[1:40:19] what rock am i standing on
[1:40:22] is there iniquity anywhere in my life
[1:40:26] if there is god expose it
[1:40:29] and get it out of my life
[1:40:32] because it's not going to work
[1:40:35] let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus
[1:40:39] god i thank you for your word
[1:40:44] god this is an age
[1:40:46] like no other age
[1:40:49] this is a day
[1:40:50] like no other day
[1:40:53] and you have called us you've elected us
[1:40:55] and chosen us before the foundation of
[1:40:57] the world
[1:40:58] to live in this day
[1:41:01] but god you've stripped away ignorance
[1:41:04] now there's no excuse for ignorance
[1:41:07] you've given us example by example
[1:41:11] even so much that there was a son of man
[1:41:13] on earth in this day that would reflect
[1:41:15] perfectly the son of man
[1:41:18] that would show us what a mature son of
[1:41:20] god in the end time will look like
[1:41:24] you've given us tapes and books
[1:41:27] we have video recordings audio
[1:41:29] recordings
[1:41:31] we have testimonies
[1:41:33] by the droves
[1:41:35] god you've been good to us
[1:41:37] let us not forsake that lord
[1:41:40] let us not bring a reproach against the
[1:41:42] effort you put forth to give us a pure
[1:41:44] word
[1:41:46] but god help us to surrender
[1:41:49] for you've called us to that kind of
[1:41:51] surrender
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:53] god i believe this is the day
[1:41:55] for a full manifestation of the messiahs
[1:41:59] to reflect the very life and nature of
[1:42:01] the bridegroom and the bride
[1:42:03] but god we can't do it of ourselves we
[1:42:06] need your spirit lord
[1:42:08] god all we can do is the reasonable
[1:42:10] things
[1:42:12] the things you've commanded the things
[1:42:14] you've told we can lay down what you've
[1:42:15] told us to lay down
[1:42:17] we can put away what you've told us to
[1:42:18] put away
[1:42:20] but at the end of the day our strength
[1:42:22] is not sufficient to go all the way
[1:42:24] we need you to empower us lord by your
[1:42:27] spirit
[1:42:28] help us to keep this word every jot and
[1:42:31] every tittle

[1:42:46] the blessedness the blessed things you
[1:42:48] do for us but help us lord to judge
[1:42:51] ourselves
[1:42:52] against your word
[1:42:54] and if we found lacking lord give us the
[1:42:57] grace to cry out and say god forgive me
[1:42:59] and help me
[1:43:00] and help me in this area lord so that i
