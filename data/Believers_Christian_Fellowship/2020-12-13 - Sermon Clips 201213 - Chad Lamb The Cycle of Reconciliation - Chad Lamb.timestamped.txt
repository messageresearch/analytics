[0:00] it was all one thing in the beginning
[0:04] the chinese laundrymen ticket he didn't
[0:06] give you two different tickets
[0:08] say i hope these go together he knew
[0:10] they would go together because they were
[0:12] one substance in the beginning and he
[0:14] took a portion off of this substance so
[0:17] that it would be an exact
[0:19] match
[0:24] and you were tore off the word for this
[0:27] day
[0:29] the bride age the manifestation of jesus
[0:31] christ in bride form
[0:32] that was the portion that was tore off
[0:34] of god that's the part of the word that
[0:36] is in you
[0:38] if you're a predestinated sea gene of
[0:40] god living in this day
[0:41] the part of god that's in you the part
[0:44] of the word that was broke off
[0:45] out of the book what is the book of life
[0:48] what are the believers the words in the
[0:50] book
[0:50] so one of those words had to come out of
[0:52] the book
[0:54] so he tore the word out of the book
[0:58] and he put it in you and what word is
[1:01] that
[1:01] it is the word it is the word
[1:04] for this day
[1:06] [Music]
[1:08] in the only way that he can wake up that
[1:12] word and get into action is to bring the
[1:14] word for this day
[1:15] to the word for this day no other word
[1:18] would work
[1:19] no teaching from a previous age no other
[1:21] doctrine no other theory
[1:23] no other philosophy will work only the
[1:25] word for this day
[1:26] coming to the word for this day and when
[1:29] they match
[1:30] [Music]
[1:31] it comes back to itself the prodigal son
[1:34] has come to himself
[1:36] and he's run to his father and his
[1:37] father's wrapped his arms around him
[1:42] brother man was teaching us to take the
[1:44] scare away you don't know who you are
[1:48] i i hope i have the baptism the holy
[1:50] ghost i hope that
[1:51] it's almost like i just hope that if i
[1:54] get a sensation or experience then i'll
[1:55] have enough confidence to believe that
[1:56] i'm a child of god
[1:59] the baptism of the holy ghost wasn't to
[2:00] give a sensation or
[2:02] or some feeling that you could put your
[2:05] put your stock in and put your hands
[2:07] around because every
[2:08] sensational experience every experience
[2:10] you have the devil will be able to make
[2:12] you question it
[2:13] but the badge of the holy ghost wasn't
[2:14] to give you a sensation or a feeling
[2:17] that you could lock on to
[2:18] the baptism of the holy ghost came to
[2:20] wake up the seed the portion of god that
[2:22] was laying there waiting to go into
[2:24] manifestation
[2:25] that is the purpose of the baptism of
[2:27] the holy ghost
[2:29] and the evidence of the baptism of the
[2:30] holy ghost is that this seed word
[2:32] precedent predestination for this day
[2:34] comes to the word and says that's
[2:36] nothing but the truth and begins to live
[2:38] it and manifest it
[2:39] [Applause]
[2:41] not i had a feeling someday and i had
[2:43] something a dream and something this
[2:45] that may very well be how he came to you
[2:48] but it's
[2:48] it's it's christ coming to christ it's
[2:51] the holy ghost coming to the holy ghost
[2:53] it's spirit the spirit life to life word
[2:55] to word
[2:55] [Applause]
[2:58] so he may come in a dream and a
[2:59] sensation that may be
[3:01] how he comes and that's wonderful but
[3:03] the thing that gives us the
[3:05] evidence that has taken place is that
[3:07] this life comes back to the word it was
[3:10] tore off
[3:10] and said that's the truth i received the
[3:12] word for my day
[3:13] i know it's right because i was in the
[3:16] conference
