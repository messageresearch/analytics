[12:00] 339 or 438 or 439 but but we want to be
[12:07] 4:40 that that's what we're all striving
[12:11] for I I don't know about you but after
[12:13] brother Chad preached that I I didn't
[12:15] want to preach no
[12:18] more I said oh my it must be about 2:30
[12:22] 240 or
[12:26] something so um God's
[12:30] good I um just want to
[12:34] um say
[12:37] um this morning we appreciate the Lord
[12:40] and uh this may be just a few
[12:43] announcements before we we get
[12:46] started
[12:48] um we want to
[12:51] uh remember uh brother
[12:56] Emanuel uh Soldier for the
[13:00] Lord and uh we want to remember him as
[13:03] he travels be heading out uh what day
[13:07] this week brother Tuesday Tuesday that's
[13:10] what I thought Tuesday and then brother
[13:13] brother burley going with him so uh just
[13:16] pray that God would direct his footsteps
[13:19] and we' hold him up in
[13:21] prayer and then um also uh I want to
[13:26] remember these two fellas
[13:29] uh so so Brother Kyle he'll be uh
[13:32] ministering for us this Wednesday and so
[13:36] uh we want to be in prayer for him that
[13:40] uh the Lord would use him also for the
[13:42] youth meeting this uh this
[13:45] evening um we don't want to forget about
[13:48] those as well you know I I yeah you know
[13:52] Brother Kyle he he he's 10 foot tall and
[13:56] bulletproof in my eyes
[13:59] a uh you know uh um I don't know if you
[14:04] if you really maybe if you ain't a
[14:05] minister you don't realize it but you
[14:08] know that man he he preaches to our
[14:10] young people twice a
[14:11] month and I don't know if you unless you
[14:14] ever get behind the pull pit you don't
[14:17] really realize what it takes to minister
[14:20] but then also to channel your thoughts
[14:24] to young people twice a
[14:26] month and and you know
[14:29] um there's no
[14:34] archives you know there's no glory in
[14:37] that if if you understand what I'm
[14:40] saying uh it it it has to be pure burden
[14:43] on that man for him to to labor you have
[14:47] no idea what it takes uh to prepare two
[14:51] Services a month and channel it that way
[14:54] and so but I happen to have walked in
[14:57] his shoes a couple times and so uh to
[15:01] me yeah bulletproof in my eyes and so I
[15:07] appreciate Brother Kyle and the burden
[15:09] that he possesses for our young people
[15:13] and then uh brother Ben looking forward
[15:16] to Sunday trust that God will pour out
[15:19] his blessings upon him and uh and
[15:26] then our pastor
[15:30] uh you know um you know another thing
[15:34] remember when he preached that sympatic
[15:36] resonance you know
[15:38] Bing you know you know you think about
[15:41] this and something else about Ministry
[15:43] that you you may not realize when when
[15:46] he preached that I was in all the whole
[15:49] service and I had to be honest
[15:51] afterwards what I told him I told I was
[15:54] envious that God gave it to him and not
[15:56] to me
[16:01] confession good for the
[16:04] soul I was just hoping that the Lord
[16:07] would anoint me and I could call Brother
[16:09] Chad and say brother Chad let me you
[16:11] ain't using them
[16:14] anymore cuz here's the thing some
[16:17] something else you may not realize is
[16:19] Ministry uh brother Chad I mean he has
[16:22] just been
[16:23] preaching I'm in awe and uh and I don't
[16:27] say that uh you know for your sake or
[16:31] for the camera's sake and you know but
[16:34] I'm just saying it for my heart's sake
[16:36] what it's done for me that he's been
[16:38] able to yield in such a way that the God
[16:40] could use him in such a powerful way but
[16:43] here's something that maybe don't
[16:45] realize after he preached that sympatic
[16:47] resonance Bing and it went into the
[16:50] archives that was
[16:52] over and and and that man like a like an
[16:55] evangelist an evangelist will get one of
[16:57] those minist one of those messages well
[16:59] he can preach it all all across the
[17:00] country you know you understand what I'm
[17:03] saying but a pastor he preaches it it's
[17:06] one and done you and then it's like no
[17:09] matter how much how powerful it was well
[17:13] well now there's another service to come
[17:16] and and now that one's gone that's in
[17:19] the archives that's in the books and now
[17:21] it's like Lord what's next right and so
[17:26] uh for that man to be able to get away
[17:29] uh we just don't want no bears to get a
[17:30] hold of you
[17:33] right I'm G to pray them bears away I'm
[17:36] glad brother Elmer went with him you
[17:39] know but Elmer just flexed you know on
[17:41] time the bear
[17:46] be that brother he big as a bear
[17:51] yeah keep him on my good side
[17:56] yeah but uh but but really what what we
[18:00] want to do is is uh is we want to hold
[18:04] his hands
[18:06] up you you want to know what your
[18:08] ministry is well what can I do for the
[18:10] lord well you may not be Aaron you you
[18:12] may not be a Aaron but just be a
[18:16] her cuz that's who the other one was
[18:18] that was holding up his hands and it
[18:20] wasn't just Aaron you know uh uh uh but
[18:24] it was her also that had to be there
[18:26] holding his hands up and so that's what
[18:28] we can do we can hold him up in prayer
[18:30] not just just while he's on vacation but
[18:33] but every
[18:34] day uh to realize the burden that he has
[18:37] and so I just I I love and appreciate
[18:39] him and not only that but but even
[18:42] family
[18:44] right yeah he uh um so don't forget
[18:50] sister
[18:51] Angie right you know the the the the the
[18:55] Ministries the wives they usually take
[18:58] the backseat neat and you know I
[19:01] remember one time uh brother called my
[19:03] wife uh sister
[19:08] Gabe right you know cuz the preacher but
[19:12] then the the sister they always but you
[19:14] know there's a scripture I believe in
[19:16] Psalms that says that she that carried
[19:18] at home divided the
[19:22] spoils so she got half regardless right
[19:26] the so praise the Lord for that
[19:29] um so we just I I trust we we we'll have
[19:32] a little
[19:33] something uh that that'll be a blessing
[19:36] to you I I want to start off in
[19:38] Revelation chapter
[19:40] 19 and uh just trust that the Lord will
[19:44] have his way this
[19:47] morning uh Revelation chapter 19 and
[19:52] verse 4
[20:00] and the four and 20 elders and the four
[20:02] beasts fell down and worshiped God that
[20:05] sat on the throne saying amen
[20:08] Allelujah and a voice came out of the
[20:11] throne saying praise our God all ye his
[20:14] servants and ye that fear Him both small
[20:17] and great and I heard as it were a voice
[20:20] of a great multitude and as the voice of
[20:22] many Waters and as the voice of Mighty
[20:26] thundering saying Al ujah for the Lord
[20:30] God omnipotent reth let us be glad and
[20:34] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[20:36] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[20:39] wife hath made herself ready and to her
[20:45] was was get granted that she should
[20:48] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[20:54] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[20:57] of saints
[20:59] and he saith unto me write blessed are
[21:02] they which are called unto the marriage
[21:04] supper of the lamb and he he said unto
[21:08] me these are the true sayings of God and
[21:13] then I'd like to turn to Genesis chapter
[21:16] 3 uh verse
[21:22] 8 Genesis 3:8
[21:29] and they heard the voice of the Lord God
[21:31] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[21:33] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[21:36] from the presence of the Lord God
[21:38] amongst the Trees of the
[21:40] garden and the Lord God called unto Adam
[21:43] and said unto him where art thou and he
[21:47] said I heard thy voice in the garden and
[21:51] I was afraid because I was naked and I
[21:54] hid
[21:56] myself and this morning I I'd like to
[21:59] speak to

[23:57] losses and and brother brandham tells us
[24:00] he says every believer in here is a
[24:03] Christian tonight because not that
[24:06] you're good but because God was good to
[24:09] call
[24:10] you you couldn't come yourself our our
[24:14] Natures are against us
[24:19] and um you know we we think so much and
[24:23] talk so much of being the bride and the
[24:28] Invincible Army predestinated elected
[24:32] saved before the foundation of the world
[24:34] and and those things are all yay and
[24:39] amen but no matter how uh thin you slice
[24:43] it there's always two sides to
[24:47] everything can we say Amen
[24:49] today and is is predestinated and as
[24:53] elected as we was there's
[24:56] still um a Time time in our lives that
[25:01] we had to
[25:03] experience uh one of those lost sheep of
[25:11] Israel
[25:25] um teach it brother yes thank you yes
[25:28] that's exactly right and I I I will say
[25:32] this that if um if you're if you
[25:38] are uh here this
[25:40] morning um remember it before you can be
[25:44] found you must first realize that you're
[25:49] lost I I don't know about you but I
[25:51] wasn't born
[25:54] found I I didn't come to this world uh
[25:58] knowing exactly who I was and and who
[26:02] God called me to
[26:03] be I I came to this world with
[26:07] amnesia and it took me decades to shake
[26:10] that Amnesia off now I don't know about
[26:13] you we we all come to this world
[26:15] different ways and and uh different uh
[26:19] Avenues of life as uh uh uh talking to
[26:24] uh brother uh Ben through text the other
[26:27] day he
[26:28] he he was texting brother Chad you know
[26:31] B got a group text and he said something
[26:33] about uh brother Ben said I hope you get
[26:35] the worst case of of Base thumb uh that
[26:40] you ever had and I thought base
[26:44] thumb I'm thinking wonder the world
[26:47] what's Bas
[26:49] th and I just talking to brother Ben I
[26:51] said I said brother I said I got to ask
[26:52] you what what's what's base
[26:55] them but but then he sent me a picture
[26:57] and he said brother it's it's not ba
[26:58] it's bass
[27:05] thumb see you know I come from the other
[27:09] side of the tracks you know I don't know
[27:11] about no no no bass I know about the Bas
[27:13] you
[27:17] know helping me Lord
[27:24] I
[27:26] but but
[27:29] but but but we all come through this
[27:31] thing called life in different
[27:33] ways and so you may have one to one way
[27:37] to pronounce b SS and I got another way
[27:42] but but you can't help maybe so much the
[27:45] path that was laid out before you uh and
[27:48] some of the roads that we chose uh
[27:52] because uh there there's sometimes
[27:54] there's a lot of forks in the road of
[27:55] thing called life and but but I don't
[27:59] know but I know one thing for certain
[28:02] that there was a point in my life where
[28:05] I was as lost as lost as could
[28:07] be and and and I was groping in
[28:11] darkness but but one day a a Merciful
[28:15] Savior came by my way and and in his
[28:19] infinite grace and mercy he he picked me
[28:22] up and he turned me
[28:24] around and and and he he put something
[28:27] on the inside out of me that I couldn't
[28:29] put
[28:30] myself and and he changed me and he
[28:32] transformed me and he made me a new
[28:34] creature in Christ Jesus and for that I
[28:37] am internally grateful because it was
[28:39] not one thing that I done it was his
[28:42] goodness that called me and changed me
[28:45] it wasn't that I was good but he was
[28:47] good to call me and and I think it's
[28:50] something that we as as as uh God's
[28:54] electing this
[28:56] day we got to realize and I hope you
[28:59] know that that we can we can see
[29:01] ourselves as the Invincible Army and
[29:04] that is true but but don't don't get
[29:07] yourself so elected that you're no
[29:10] earthly
[29:11] good right that there has to be a
[29:14] balance in it because you know we we we
[29:17] came lost and we get saved but then we
[29:21] we have to once we get saved then we got
[29:24] to lose ourselves
[29:26] again and that's the battle that we all
[29:28] go through because if you love your life
[29:32] you're going to lose it is that right as
[29:35] brother Emanuel preached uh uh uh so
[29:39] beautifully Wednesday but but Jesus
[29:42] tells us and and that Rich Young Ruler
[29:45] is an example that that he said that
[29:49] look here I was an invincible Army from
[29:51] my
[29:53] youth right he he kept it all he he knew
[29:57] all the quotes he he knew all the
[29:59] scriptures he he knew what Moses said
[30:01] and Abraham and but yet there was still
[30:04] that one little thing Laing in
[30:07] him and we all have to be honest with
[30:10] ourselves and make sure that we ain't
[30:13] just
[30:14] 99%
[30:16] good right that we ain't just
[30:22] 439 but we got to be
[30:26] 440 amen
[30:29] and so it takes us searching out
[30:33] ourselves and trying uh uh to be honest
[30:37] with ourselves because we live in a
[30:40] world as the Bible tells us that
[30:42] iniquity shall abound and the love of
[30:46] many would wax
[30:48] cold but there would take a people that
[30:51] would have to have an
[30:53] endurance to make it to the
[30:56] end there's many that start off strong
[31:00] that thought they were saved that
[31:02] thought they they were the elect of God
[31:05] but they didn't make it to the end of
[31:07] the
[31:12] road maybe they thought they was
[31:15] found the whole
[31:17] time but really in reality they was lost
[31:20] the whole
[31:22] time and I I don't know about you but
[31:25] that makes me tremble to my core yes yes
[31:29] and that makes me search out my own
[31:31] salvation with fear and
[31:32] trembling that that I I I want I want to
[31:35] look in the mirror of God's word and
[31:38] make sure that I line
[31:41] up because brother brandham says that
[31:43] that he he gives us a warning concerning
[31:46] the last days and he takes that
[31:48] scripture that we just read he says
[31:51] because of abounding iniquity the love
[31:52] of many would wax
[31:54] cold uh and it would be in this last age
[31:58] self
[32:02] love
[32:05] right this is the the age of
[32:10] selfies let me ask you why in the world
[32:14] would you care to share what you have
[32:16] for
[32:21] breakfast do you realize how vain that
[32:24] is absolutely
[32:28] do you think I care if you had a egg
[32:30] McMuffin or not I mean
[32:33] really you understand what I'm saying
[32:35] but that's the hour that we live where
[32:38] people are so consumed that they want
[32:40] their life to be on
[32:43] display where where look we don't even
[32:45] have to be trapped by the trappings of
[32:50] Hollywood we can become a star in our
[32:52] own
[32:55] eyes and all you need is a hand handful
[32:58] of
[32:59] followers right and and and we live in
[33:03] an hour where where so much is thrown at
[33:05] us we we live in an hour where there's
[33:08] so much where it's how hard is it for us
[33:13] to pray uh give us this day our daily
[33:19] bread if if I if we would take account
[33:23] at how many has actually prayed that in
[33:26] sincerity I would Dar say that there
[33:30] would be none because we live in the
[33:33] Land of
[33:35] Plenty I'm talk I'm not talking about
[33:38] saying it I'm talking about praying
[33:42] it because we live in so much we live
[33:47] where everything in life is one click
[33:50] away that that if if you can think it
[33:54] you can have it and if Amazon doesn't
[33:58] have it well I got a printer that can
[34:00] make
[34:04] it do you understand that's that's the
[34:07] hour that we live
[34:09] in where where where whatever your
[34:13] desire is you can attain to and and you
[34:18] know we we we couldn't have we couldn't
[34:20] have I don't believe that the Lord could
[34:23] have come in the 19 and80s because
[34:26] everything wasn't one click
[34:28] away but but all we had was a JC Penny
[34:33] catalog sir remember that we couldn't
[34:37] wait till that thing came
[34:39] along right and then we looked at that
[34:41] thing all year
[34:44] long I thought I thought the I thought
[34:46] the 70s they dressed bad till I saw that
[34:49] picture man look hey she look like she
[34:51] getting ready uh try out for the for the
[34:55] Browns sister what's wrong with them
[34:57] shoulder pads I know y'all have some
[35:00] shoulder pads like that man she
[35:07] like but that's where we
[35:09] live where we have
[35:12] everything and and we're so busy getting
[35:15] and getting that how often do we
[35:22] lose we live in a time where where we
[35:26] will absolutely spend
[35:29] thousands to
[35:38] keep because we don't want to
[35:41] lose and we'll spend thousands of our
[35:45] livelihood to make sure everything is
[35:49] safe and
[35:52] sound and I'm not preaching against
[35:54] those things cuz my insurance man is on
[35:57] the second
[35:59] [Applause]
[36:03] row and I don't want to get a bill next
[36:06] year and
[36:07] go I'm
[36:11] [Laughter]
[36:16] sorry but but we live in a time where
[36:20] it's it where we're trying to
[36:23] protect everything that we got so we
[36:26] don't lose it
[36:29] but really is that how we're supposed to
[36:33] be because Jesus said if
[36:41] you if you
[36:44] lose then you're going to
[36:50] gain there's so much I I I wonder I
[36:53] wonder in this in this pie of insurance
[36:58] where does Blessed Assurance fit
[37:02] in you understand what I'm
[37:04] saying we we live we live we live in an
[37:07] hour where it's it's we put our money in
[37:11] in a bank for
[37:17] safety
[37:20] really we we we have we have every week
[37:24] we put money in a stock market that's
[37:26] going to collapse
[37:29] in hopes that one day we'll have
[37:35] enough
[37:38] we we put so much in in getting and
[37:42] maintaining and
[37:43] keeping because we don't want to lose
[37:47] anything but as we by God's grace look
[37:51] through the scriptures losing is a part
[37:53] of
[37:54] life
[37:56] amen and and we have to we have to oh
[38:00] man we have to be I don't even we say
[38:03] balanced but then I go back to what
[38:04] brother Chad said we where is
[38:07] balance right is is it is it your
[38:10] Vantage Point of balance or my vantage
[38:12] point of balance because where are we at
[38:15] in in in this in this grand scheme of
[38:19] life because we're all striving to live
[38:22] a balanced life but that Razor's Edge is
[38:26] going to take only the elect of God will
[38:29] be able to do that right and that's what
[38:32] I want to be that's what I'm striving to
[38:35] be but only thing I can do is look at my
[38:38] life and say God is my life reflecting
[38:41] the elect of God I is my everyday life
[38:46] not not pull pit Preacher Man but but
[38:49] I'm talking about in my private life is
[38:52] that reflecting elect of
[38:55] God be because we we can we can buy a
[38:58] gift we've seen many mighty
[39:01] man that that can preach it like no
[39:05] other but then at some point in time
[39:09] they fade
[39:10] away so so the Bible tells us that we
[39:14] ought not to think of more ourselves
[39:17] more highly than we ought
[39:21] to because what we think uh we have it
[39:25] can be gone in an
[39:28] instant you we we live our whole lives
[39:32] to to have a home and to and to and to
[39:36] you know uh have a college fund for the
[39:38] children and and a piggy bank and
[39:41] retirement and all those things and and
[39:44] we can we can have you know the dream I
[39:47] don't know about you is to have you know
[39:49] all everything paid
[39:53] for but even that if you you have the
[39:58] title deed in the safe at home do you
[40:02] really own
[40:03] [Music]
[40:06] it you may say yeah brother Gabe I Own
[40:09] It Free and Clear I'm debt
[40:12] free but I ask you a
[40:17] question don't pay your taxes this
[40:22] year and then let me ask you a year from
[40:26] now
[40:27] do you own that
[40:30] home and your head's going to fall down
[40:34] low and and those Barn Door shoulders
[40:37] that you had will become
[40:40] deflated amen and you'll realize you
[40:43] don't own
[40:47] nothing that's the world in which we
[40:51] live and we can get so caught up in this
[40:54] thing called life that we lose sight of
[41:00] losing in order to
[41:03] gain and and I am for all those things
[41:07] uh uh we have to do those but but the
[41:09] whole point is is what is our Focus
[41:12] that's right where where are we going in
[41:15] this thing called life because we can
[41:19] look all of
[41:20] us we we we can live in such a life
[41:24] where where where we're not trapped by
[41:26] the things of the world the you know the
[41:29] the the addictions of this world do not
[41:31] have hold on us and that's great but
[41:35] that's not eternal
[41:39] life
[41:41] amen what is eternal life amen you tell
[41:48] me what it
[41:52] is and I'll tell you what the prophet
[41:55] said that's right
[41:57] eternal life is living for
[42:02] others but we
[42:04] live in a selfish World absolutely where
[42:08] it's all
[42:11] about
[42:13] me and we lose sight of
[42:18] others you know we get so caught up in
[42:22] the rat race of
[42:24] life that we lose our joy
[42:27] for the Salvation that's
[42:30] right that we
[42:33] have
[42:35] amen sister you can get so caught up in
[42:38] giving out to the
[42:40] family that you give so much that your
[42:44] joy becomes
[42:50] empty but we have to be mindful say Lord
[42:54] look do y'all remember the first time
[42:56] y'all got saved
[42:57] remember look you know and it don't have
[43:00] to be you know I was on a bar stool and
[43:03] I'm not talking about that that's that's
[43:06] that's not that's not my look cuz I I
[43:08] I'll say this you you young ones can go
[43:10] well brother Gabe you know uh I don't
[43:12] have a testimony I I didn't come from
[43:14] you know drugs and Al listen that's not
[43:17] a
[43:17] testimony look I I have to say this just
[43:21] because I got cleaned up don't mean I
[43:23] got salvation
[43:27] that's right just because my pants ain't
[43:30] sagging and I and I and I and I and I
[43:33] ain't you know uh a living that life
[43:36] does not mean I'm
[43:39] Eternal a suit and tie does not make you
[43:46] Eternal only he makes you
[43:50] Eternal and so don't discredit what God
[43:54] has you in your path called life that's
[43:56] right you have to look at your own self
[43:59] and and you have to be mindful of what
[44:02] God has done for you as an
[44:05] individual Hallelujah and when we see
[44:08] that and we realize what God has done
[44:10] that you are serving not out of Duty
[44:14] that's it that's right not because of
[44:17] what Mom and Dad does Mom and Dad has
[44:21] nothing to do with it the family
[44:25] church has nothing to do with
[44:28] it right how he was raised has nothing
[44:32] to do with it our friends and Associates
[44:36] has nothing to do with it yes sir it's
[44:40] something deeper than
[44:43] that but even when we come to that
[44:47] spot there's times in life where we can
[44:50] we can lose our joy of that
[44:54] moment are y'all with me do do I have to
[44:57] break out the amen sign again I will
[45:00] prompt you if I have to
[45:05] I thank you don't make brother Emanuel
[45:08] work hey y'all going to make me run down
[45:10] to the fifth row go
[45:16] amen we look even even even we can lose
[45:23] our savior that's right
[45:28] and and brother brandham tells us that
[45:30] actually means the power of
[45:36] contact we can get so bottled up in our
[45:39] own
[45:41] world that we fail to reach out and
[45:43] contact one
[45:47] another you know we can get so caught up
[45:50] in our life and our struggles and maybe
[45:53] you
[45:54] know all of our losses become greater
[45:57] than our gains amen amen
[46:02] amen we we look at we look at our
[46:05] missteps in lives and all the things
[46:07] that we lost in life look you
[46:12] know sometimes we lose things in life
[46:15] and we never even got to
[46:18] experience and we look across the aisle
[46:20] and I one of my one of my one of the
[46:24] things that I I love about these young
[46:26] people is to look on them and see
[46:30] innocence right I I look at I look at
[46:33] these you know remember that one uh
[46:36] remember that one sister she was you
[46:38] know she's out on the Dance Floor
[46:39] remember brother B cast that devil out
[46:41] of her and you know one another time
[46:44] brother B talking about and he goes uh
[46:46] she she was talking brother BR she said
[46:48] Oh Brother bam she said I just got such
[46:50] a hard look on my face and she she was
[46:54] looking at uh I remember if it's media
[46:56] open she said she got such a sweet look
[46:59] on her you know and there's something
[47:01] about look when when you youngsters
[47:03] don't get caught up in the world there's
[47:05] a softness that
[47:07] remains but but don't ever um lose sight
[47:12] of the value in which that is because uh
[47:18] there's others that's been on the other
[47:19] side of the tracks and they look at I
[47:22] look like when I look at you and I think
[47:23] oh man Lord don't ever let them lose it
[47:27] because there's such a beauty in which
[47:30] that
[47:31] is because it it it's it it's something
[47:34] that that's to be
[47:36] cherished for for a sister to be able to
[47:39] blush right amen amen right and and so
[47:45] so don't let the world somehow
[47:48] especially you boys you know you want to
[47:50] be tough you want to be uh right you
[47:52] don't be no right you're like
[47:54] brother Gabe I ain't going to put no
[47:55] skinny pants on right right you you want
[47:58] the you want the camouflage
[48:00] and
[48:02] right man I don't know y'all got some
[48:05] can y'all stand up and make sure I got
[48:06] no skinny jeans out
[48:09] there right but but you Brothers you you
[48:12] want to be a man right and and but but
[48:15] that doesn't mean that you can't be
[48:16] tender on the inside
[48:22] too in this thing called life
[48:29] there's there's pitfalls that
[48:32] happens and sometimes we lose things
[48:34] near and dear to
[48:36] us but I but I I want to say this
[48:40] brother or sister look may maybe maybe
[48:44] there's a prodal
[48:46] son that you're waiting on
[48:50] Amen but listen we all know one have
[48:53] been one amen or we're waiting on one
[48:58] amen
[49:01] right but but we have to hold the
[49:05] faith and and and listen may maybe
[49:08] sometimes we look in life and we think
[49:09] well brother Gabe I ain't did nothing
[49:11] for the
[49:15] Lord and and we when we think our life
[49:17] is
[49:19] insignificant and and we're trying but
[49:21] but you know it's it's not about how big
[49:25] we can be
[49:27] it it may be a you know it may be a
[49:29] testimony that we have that that we
[49:32] won't even recognize till we get to the
[49:34] other side at at the impact that our
[49:37] life had that you wasn't even mindful of
[49:40] amen amen you know you know you think
[49:43] about this when when brother Brandon
[49:45] went beyond the curent of time and he
[49:48] saw those
[49:49] Millions now let's really think about
[49:53] this there was millions of his converts
[49:58] but out of those Millions there was only
[50:02] one that was ordained to come out of the
[50:08] congregation and speak to that
[50:11] Prophet
[50:16] yes and and the voice says do didn't you
[50:20] don't you recognize her and this is the
[50:23] amazing thing brother brandham didn't
[50:26] even recognize who she
[50:31] was and though that Prophet didn't
[50:34] recognize her God
[50:37] [Applause]
[50:41] did and and the thing we ought not to
[50:44] take this
[50:47] lightly the voice says she was past
[50:52] 90 when you L her to Christ
[50:57] so out of the
[50:59] millions of Mighty Gentile
[51:04] Warriors out of all the preachers praise
[51:08] God that had handled
[51:10] it that had sent thousands of
[51:14] souls to the kingdom under that
[51:20] Ministry out of the
[51:25] millions God will would have one Grandma
[51:29] amen
[51:33] amen
[51:34] amen one
[51:37] grandma that had lived her whole life
[51:45] unconverted that had spent her life who
[51:49] knows how I look remember brother Bram
[51:51] says uh uh uh we get to the other side
[51:54] I'll spend 10,000 years of peace with
[51:56] you you remember that yeah remember I'm
[51:58] going to be standing in this sister's
[52:00] line
[52:01] too cuz I want to
[52:04] know I want to hear her life
[52:08] story because God you want to talk about
[52:11] unmar Grace hallah that when she was 90
[52:16] years
[52:18] old let me ask you what Earthly value
[52:22] did she
[52:25] possess what Ministry was she going to
[52:28] do her Ministry was when she was on the
[52:31] other side think of the millions that
[52:34] she is encouraged by this story that was
[52:37] told amen
[52:40] am praise God this sister 90 s I ought I
[52:44] should hear a few more Amen brother
[52:47] gab come
[52:49] [Laughter]
[52:52] on it it was it was some mighty preacher
[52:55] there that cleared the aisles you
[52:59] know but it was a
[53:02] grandma that was past
[53:05] 90 when she heard the
[53:08] voice she was
[53:10] lost but then she was
[53:13] found she was
[53:15] blind but then she
[53:20] seen see because remember when the
[53:22] Capstone come down it come down with sh
[53:25] sh shoutings of of right
[53:28] Grace thank you double portion right
[53:32] that's what this message is this message
[53:35] is a double portion of
[53:38] Grace right yes so so when when she's
[53:45] there she was past
[53:50] 90 and though she may have not had any
[53:54] Earthly value yes
[53:57] you understand what I'm
[54:00] saying that that even though and and the
[54:03] amazing thing is that God allowed her to
[54:05] go 90 years he could have saved her at
[54:09] any point in time of that
[54:10] span but God allowed it to be when her
[54:14] life was
[54:17] over right not not three scoring 10 70
[54:22] and but
[54:24] 90 then God would would reveal himself
[54:29] to
[54:30] her with Malachi
[54:33] 4 and she would catch it yes sir brother
[54:37] Bram said 90% of conversions happened
[54:39] before the age of 21
[54:42] 98% so after she had done lived her life
[54:46] hardened you know how grandma is setting
[54:48] the
[54:52] W yeah grandma said they no right come
[54:57] on sisters come on brother some of the
[55:02] brother you get a little am man
[55:06] side don't let her see
[55:12] it but when she's past
[55:16] 90 and set in her
[55:20] ways yet she could hear the
[55:23] voice and it made a certain sound amen
[55:26] and that hardened heart that was set in
[55:29] her
[55:31] ways would
[55:34] begin to crumble amen amen and that
[55:38] heart of Flesh would begin to be
[55:47] pliable some of us need our joy restored
[55:53] amen because of this rat race called
[55:55] life
[55:58] we live in a
[56:02] time of loss and gain gain and
[56:06] loss we live in an hour where it's not
[56:10] baby blue skies and white puffy clouds
[56:14] all the time it's not sunshines and
[56:18] rainbows right I don't y'all got
[56:22] sunshines and rainbows all the time no
[56:25] but but there's there's but but I I was
[56:28] talking to brother brother Josiah months
[56:30] and months ago and he and he told me
[56:32] something he said he said the other day
[56:34] he said he was on his way to work and it
[56:36] was storming out and uh and he said he
[56:40] said he said you know he said he said
[56:42] when you when it's baby blue skies and
[56:43] white puffy clouds you're just
[56:46] driving Lord
[56:50] prepare
[56:52] right but let let let those let those
[56:55] darts Skies uh uh appear out of nowhere
[57:01] and you see the rain come in and it gets
[57:04] real dark and black and the and the
[57:07] lightning flashes and The Thunder
[57:11] Rolls and it gets real dark it ain't
[57:15] Lord prepare me anymore but it's 10 and
[57:22] two and when it starts coming down like
[57:25] sheep of
[57:27] rain and it's wave after
[57:32] wave you ain't Lord
[57:35] prep
[57:36] me but you're
[57:40] what your LA are
[57:44] focused and you're
[57:46] watching that yellow
[57:53] line and really
[57:56] that's when we're in the test that's
[57:59] right that's when you turn off the Lord
[58:03] prep cuz you want to
[58:06] focus and brother Josiah said something
[58:08] he says teachers don't say much during
[58:11] the
[58:16] test and when he said that I thought oh
[58:18] that's so good and I saw I saw a
[58:21] PowerPoint slide in the making
[58:27] I should have gave him credit at the
[58:29] bottom of
[58:32] that
[58:35] right but listen sometimes everything
[58:38] falls
[58:39] apart cuz God trying to get you to focus
[58:42] that's right amen that's right you know
[58:46] I I I I was thinking about brother Tim
[58:51] losing him and I I I had I had this
[58:54] thought before then but it just
[58:56] uh brother brother brother Tony was was
[58:59] preaching on you know there's a time to
[59:01] lose and a time to gain and a time to
[59:05] get and a time of refrain from getting
[59:07] and then and then brother brother
[59:08] Emanuel preached Wednesday and he was
[59:10] use that same scripture about he that
[59:13] keeps his life but if you lose your life
[59:15] and I just and and and and to me it just
[59:18] seems like there's this cuz we're all
[59:21] going through a loss of some kind amen
[59:24] right but but we have have to be mindful
[59:26] in those losses that it's not to hurt us
[59:29] it's really for our
[59:30] good but we can't have a lady oia
[59:35] mentality that's why we have to break
[59:37] out of this lady oia
[59:41] mentality and you know brother brandham
[59:43] tells us this he says when the hand
[59:46] clapping over when it's speaking when
[59:48] tongues are over and the healing service
[59:50] is over when the Music Stops if that
[59:53] deep settled peace them doors of faith
[59:56] face standing there wide open to let him
[59:58] the Lord be Lord over the
[1:00:03] situation it doesn't do any good to play
[1:00:06] music or clap hands or speak in tongues
[1:00:08] or have a healing servant that's right
[1:00:11] we we led him so far but now Lord you
[1:00:14] stay back there you might have done that
[1:00:17] to to he says he says brother so and say
[1:00:20] sister so and so to that child but my
[1:00:24] case is diff oh
[1:00:38] amen no no brother Manuel you don't
[1:00:40] understand my case is
[1:00:44] different I brother John I know it
[1:00:46] worked for
[1:00:48] you but my
[1:00:52] case brother Mike God treats me
[1:00:55] different God favors you
[1:01:00] he that's brother
[1:01:03] Chad he's a
[1:01:11] preach praise God Amen no no no no no
[1:01:17] your case isn't different am it isn't
[1:01:21] different you you're the one that's
[1:01:25] making the
[1:01:27] difference by keeping him out of your
[1:01:29] door
[1:01:34] Faith you are the
[1:01:36] one brother Gabe is the
[1:01:39] one we all have to be mindful our case
[1:01:43] is not
[1:01:45] different God does not treat us
[1:01:49] differently look I I I came from a a
[1:01:53] broken
[1:01:54] home I I I came I came from a home where
[1:01:59] you know I was I was thinking about it
[1:02:02] yesterday you know my mama's uh not
[1:02:06] really a serving the lord my dad was a
[1:02:10] was came to the message I was about 56
[1:02:12] years
[1:02:13] old he's a
[1:02:16] Marine right
[1:02:18] Totaline and uh he it it's it's Dad way
[1:02:21] the highway right and uh very uh I love
[1:02:25] it he's he's my hero so I ain't saying
[1:02:28] this you know against him I'm just
[1:02:30] saying it's just the way he is it's that
[1:02:32] old school way right dad's dad
[1:02:36] and but but you know that only works for
[1:02:39] so long when you're little but if if
[1:02:43] you're built that way Dad you at some
[1:02:45] point in your life you got to transform
[1:02:47] as that child gets older because you
[1:02:49] will push that child away if you keep
[1:02:51] that
[1:02:53] attitude it it only works for so long
[1:02:55] when when they're little you can do that
[1:02:57] you can Strongarm them you can muscle
[1:02:59] them but but once that world starts
[1:03:01] flashing if you Strongarm them when they
[1:03:04] when the light when the world opens up
[1:03:05] and they start seeing it they will look
[1:03:09] my dad was like I worshiped that man so
[1:03:12] I know what I'm talking about and I
[1:03:13] don't mean that in a bad way but it was
[1:03:15] like Larry Joe Smith and then God right
[1:03:19] just I don't mean that sacrilegiously
[1:03:20] I'm just saying he was my everything cuz
[1:03:24] when I my mama you know she was working
[1:03:26] and we wasn't that close when I was
[1:03:28] little but my dad I mean we we would
[1:03:30] sleep back to back uh he put me to bed
[1:03:33] and we sleep back to back I mean I mean
[1:03:36] I couldn't wait for him to get off work
[1:03:38] I mean he was my
[1:03:41] world but even though he was that
[1:03:45] because he was so strong armed and so
[1:03:48] heavy-handed once the World opened up
[1:03:51] that strong arinis didn't play with me
[1:03:58] and you have to realize the same too as
[1:04:00] a
[1:04:01] parent you you can't use Strongarm and
[1:04:04] fear tactics because what happens is
[1:04:07] then it be then it becomes the parents
[1:04:09] against the
[1:04:12] children and and then and then what you
[1:04:15] do is you open up and you start building
[1:04:18] Walls by doing that because then that
[1:04:20] child is seeing how much they can get
[1:04:22] away with because Dad is so heavy-handed
[1:04:25] and my dad he
[1:04:26] he I'm not talking about him beating me
[1:04:28] I I think I only got like one one or two
[1:04:29] spanking in my life he just had to look
[1:04:31] at
[1:04:33] me I mean he's like 58
[1:04:36] 150 right but he'd look at me and he was
[1:04:39] he was like 11 foot tall and nuclear
[1:04:42] proof brother brother
[1:04:47] Kyle but but
[1:04:50] but my my point is is is is is when when
[1:04:54] when we when we when we
[1:04:56] when we have that type of a
[1:04:59] home we we we lose the opportunities of
[1:05:02] actually winning them
[1:05:04] over our children do not come to this
[1:05:06] world born
[1:05:08] again no matter how much they've been
[1:05:11] under this message how many youth
[1:05:13] meetings how many children's church how
[1:05:16] many how many special meetings look they
[1:05:19] are still struggling trying to
[1:05:22] understand life and if Mom and Dad are
[1:05:24] way up here and they are way down here
[1:05:28] then there is no way for them to attain
[1:05:30] to the level that you're at you have to
[1:05:33] come down to their level and speak on
[1:05:35] their
[1:05:36] terms
[1:05:40] amen because if not it just it builds
[1:05:44] walls you have to be mindful that they
[1:05:47] are not
[1:05:48] converted and you have to hold them to
[1:05:51] that
[1:05:52] accountability I'm not talking about
[1:05:54] living free rain understand what I'm
[1:05:56] saying but my point is is is you have to
[1:05:59] understand that they don't have the
[1:06:00] overcoming power that you
[1:06:03] have
[1:06:06] amen unless your case is
[1:06:14] different but you know God has a way in
[1:06:17] which he deals with
[1:06:19] us because
[1:06:27] what when I was in the home
[1:06:31] like you know um I got treated
[1:06:38] differently and so and so you know my
[1:06:41] sisters would get one thing but then I
[1:06:43] would get
[1:06:49] another and so when you grow up with
[1:06:53] that it it it it begins to isol ol at
[1:06:58] you because you get to get you don't get
[1:07:01] to treat get treated
[1:07:05] fairly and you know children children
[1:07:09] have awesome
[1:07:11] discernment you may think you're fooling
[1:07:14] them you
[1:07:15] ain't children see it they see when
[1:07:18] you're
[1:07:19] naughty and they see when you're nice
[1:07:22] they may not have the courage to tell
[1:07:24] you they see see
[1:07:26] it they they see when Mom and Dad play
[1:07:29] church and when they
[1:07:31] don't that's
[1:07:33] right that's why you got to repent and
[1:07:36] say look I can't tell you how many times
[1:07:38] I set them all three girls down wifey
[1:07:40] too and like
[1:07:42] hey that messed up I shouldn't be doing
[1:07:45] this I'm
[1:07:49] sorry cuz Hey ain't going to be no
[1:07:52] Preacher Man here Preacher Man can't be
[1:07:54] over there
[1:07:57] no sir not
[1:07:58] me cuz honestly I'll be honest with you
[1:08:02] uh I want to make heaven and I don't
[1:08:05] care what it cost me that's right
[1:08:08] Ministry family livelihood I don't it
[1:08:12] don't it don't matter it don't matter
[1:08:15] cuz I want to make Heaven Lord that's
[1:08:18] all that matters to
[1:08:20] me right but but you know uh I I I found
[1:08:25] found out that that when when we live in
[1:08:28] life and we get treated those way
[1:08:30] sometimes you can take the way that you
[1:08:33] was treated as a child and then you can
[1:08:35] you can you can reflect that upon
[1:08:40] God and then you can take your hurts as
[1:08:43] a childhood because you was scarred as a
[1:08:46] little boy or a little girl and then you
[1:08:48] can make God the same way and think well
[1:08:50] the Lord treats me different
[1:08:58] and then you can say well my situation
[1:09:00] is different brother Emmanuel no no no
[1:09:03] no look the the problem is brother Gabe
[1:09:06] is not using the filter of God's
[1:09:10] word brother Gabe would be using the
[1:09:12] filter of his
[1:09:14] complex to approach God's
[1:09:18] word and and and and brother bham says
[1:09:22] this brother bham says I find that
[1:09:25] people so struggle seem see seems like I
[1:09:28] meet people and they say it's just such
[1:09:30] a struggle have you seen people that way
[1:09:33] and probably there's many sitting right
[1:09:35] before me now that has ups and downs ins
[1:09:37] and outs this day they're all right you
[1:09:39] meet them and they love the Lord today
[1:09:41] and tomorrow they're having struggled to
[1:09:43] hang on the devil is so tempting them
[1:09:45] and they're having such ups and downs
[1:09:47] didn't you meet somebody that's on the
[1:09:48] hilltop all the time brother there's
[1:09:50] nothing bothers them at all now there's
[1:09:53] bound to be something like back in
[1:09:56] somewhere
[1:09:59] wow God's no respector a person or God
[1:10:04] doesn't respect person he wants all his
[1:10:08] children to have the
[1:10:11] same
[1:10:12] amen woo
[1:10:16] Hallelujah a righteous father wouldn't
[1:10:20] give one a dish of ice cream without
[1:10:24] giving them all
[1:10:27] ice cream
[1:10:32] God I hope this little quote just
[1:10:36] crumbled all of your
[1:10:40] theology of why your Christian
[1:10:42] experience is different than brother so
[1:10:44] and so or sister so and
[1:10:49] so and you know what it was crumbled by
[1:10:53] an ice cream
[1:10:57] that's how good our savior is am that
[1:11:01] that you know he he he he he'll he'll
[1:11:03] have that Prophet anointed to say
[1:11:05] something so rough and he'll do it with
[1:11:08] an ice cream so you can't be mad at
[1:11:13] it so so when we when we think God is
[1:11:18] somehow treating us different no how
[1:11:22] many believes we have we serve a
[1:11:23] righteous father amen
[1:11:25] yes so so if he's going to give
[1:11:31] Brother Kyle ice
[1:11:35] cream then that means he's going to give
[1:11:38] you ice cream too amen that means you
[1:11:42] ain't got to be
[1:11:44] empty-handed where you say but brother
[1:11:46] I'm not talking about your previous
[1:11:50] childhood that's where
[1:11:53] you have to go back back into your
[1:11:59] childhood you say brother Gabe I don't
[1:12:02] want to go back but you have
[1:12:10] to sometimes in life you have to go
[1:12:14] back to the hardest places that are
[1:12:17] going to go back
[1:12:19] to because it's those places in life
[1:12:23] where you lost so much
[1:12:26] all those losses are keeping you from
[1:12:28] gains
[1:12:31] now and if you ain't careful all those
[1:12:34] losses will turn into losses for your
[1:12:42] children they'll turn into losses in
[1:12:44] your
[1:12:46] marriage they'll turn into losses in
[1:12:49] your family
[1:12:50] life your marriage life and your church
[1:12:54] life
[1:12:56] yes because you won't be the sister that
[1:13:00] we
[1:13:03] need you say oh no no brother gab no no
[1:13:06] no you're here and we need you amen amen
[1:13:11] yes that's right come on
[1:13:13] brother right do we not are we not a
[1:13:17] body and we need each other right but we
[1:13:21] have to realize that every lick of our
[1:13:23] father
[1:13:25] fire of our father you need not a not a
[1:13:30] bass Thum you need a base Thumb in the
[1:13:36] congregation because brother Gabe
[1:13:38] balances out brother
[1:13:43] Ben right and and and and and so we have
[1:13:47] to
[1:13:48] realize that God is here to hand out a
[1:13:52] dish of ice cream to every one of us so
[1:13:57] if you leave here not getting a dish of
[1:13:59] ice cream it wasn't the heavenly father
[1:14:03] that passed you
[1:14:05] by it was you making yourself your
[1:14:08] situation different when it does not be
[1:14:12] need to be that
[1:14:14] way God
[1:14:16] is God is just as
[1:14:19] much willing to give you those baby blue
[1:14:22] skies and white there's going to be
[1:14:24] seasons of rain that is true but listen
[1:14:27] it's up to you to make the
[1:14:30] choice
[1:14:32] look brother bam tells us this he says
[1:14:36] you've got to have
[1:14:38] faith he says but you've got to know how
[1:14:41] to use that Faith to make yourself well
[1:14:46] to get
[1:14:47] happiness out of
[1:14:51] life you know sister Wendy Chan G gave s
[1:14:55] Susan and I a little plaque years ago
[1:14:57] and and and I we keep it on our Manel
[1:14:59] and it says happiness is a
[1:15:04] choice amen and it is so true cuz if you
[1:15:09] want to sit in the service sour that's
[1:15:12] your
[1:15:13] choice if you want to sit in the service
[1:15:16] and go no brother Gabe my situation is
[1:15:21] different then brother so and so is
[1:15:23] going to have to preach another service
[1:15:26] like this in another way that isn't like
[1:15:28] brother gab's way that's in a different
[1:15:31] way because God is going to get you to
[1:15:34] understand that you're making your
[1:15:36] situation
[1:15:38] different cuz that's how he is because
[1:15:41] you're one of his and he's yours and you
[1:15:44] got to see it and so he's
[1:15:47] longsuffering not willing that
[1:15:50] anybody would stay in that
[1:15:53] situation and so he's got TR to get you
[1:15:55] to that place where you're going to
[1:15:58] realize I am not going to use my past to
[1:16:02] make my
[1:16:03] choices I'm going to have faith in God's
[1:16:06] word because you have to you have to
[1:16:09] call those things that are not as though
[1:16:11] they are how do you do that it's by
[1:16:13] God's word that's why it's so important
[1:16:17] to understand to read and to believe
[1:16:19] God's word because God is obligated only
[1:16:23] to his word amen look he's not obligated
[1:16:27] to your complex he's not obligated to
[1:16:30] your situation he's not obligated to
[1:16:33] your fears and failures and your losses
[1:16:36] what he is obligated to is his eternal
[1:16:40] word and you have to go to the word and
[1:16:43] find out where you fit in the word if
[1:16:47] you are suffering loss there's
[1:16:50] multitudes of characters for you to pull
[1:16:52] from to find strength right
[1:16:55] that's the way he designed it that's the
[1:16:57] way he built it the prophet of God W was
[1:17:03] built in such a way that that he could
[1:17:05] suffer loss upon loss upon
[1:17:10] loss but it was molding him in such a
[1:17:12] way where he could say I love you dear
[1:17:15] Jesus you've broken my heart over and
[1:17:17] over but I love you for it how in the
[1:17:21] world is that even fathomable I know how
[1:17:24] it's fathomable because I've said the
[1:17:26] same thing thank you Lord thank you
[1:17:30] Jesus amen there's the only this is this
[1:17:33] this this gospel is the only thing that
[1:17:36] is life and life more abundantly and I'm
[1:17:39] finding out in life the more that I lose
[1:17:42] the more that I gain the more that I can
[1:17:44] sacrifice the greater he becomes in my
[1:17:48] life amen you look at that Prophet you
[1:17:51] look at what that Prophet went through
[1:17:53] we think we think wow look you know you
[1:17:55] know we we look at anything how he look
[1:17:59] a crossey child could stand on a
[1:18:01] platform all he'd have to do is look at
[1:18:04] him he didn't have to offer a word of
[1:18:06] prayer and those eyes that were crossed
[1:18:09] would come straight amen and and the
[1:18:12] congregation no doubt would look at and
[1:18:14] be in
[1:18:17] awe but what they failed to see is what
[1:18:19] it cost that man to have that
[1:18:22] ability yes right right yes
[1:18:27] amen what he had to lose in order to
[1:18:31] have the ability to enter into the
[1:18:33] sufferings of that
[1:18:37] child praise God
[1:18:41] Amen but sometimes we look and we go
[1:18:43] well it didn't happen like I thought
[1:18:45] brother Gabe I prayed for something and
[1:18:48] it didn't happen or I wanted this to
[1:18:50] happen and it didn't happen well
[1:18:52] remember the stash Cliff baby
[1:18:56] brother brandom there was a a sister and
[1:18:58] and a and a and a brother over in
[1:19:00] Germany he worked for the military and
[1:19:03] uh uh the baby passed away and they
[1:19:05] heard about brother brandom and uh
[1:19:06] prayed for a baby came back to life and
[1:19:09] so they sent to brother brand brother
[1:19:10] Bram you come to we'll fly you to
[1:19:11] Germany and fly you to pray and fly to
[1:19:13] pray he said let me go pray and so
[1:19:16] brother brandom he goes and he prays I
[1:19:18] don't know it's 4 the night he was out
[1:19:19] in the woods I believe it was a certain
[1:19:21] amount of time he comes back and and God
[1:19:23] said no don't you do
[1:19:26] it and brother bam had to call that
[1:19:29] sister back and go sister it's the hand
[1:19:31] of the Lord God knows
[1:19:34] better amen praise
[1:19:39] God and she says this she said what was
[1:19:43] it brother brandom my weakness of
[1:19:47] faith I said you have great faith you
[1:19:51] prayed for your baby and your husband
[1:19:54] held on to it you and your husband God
[1:19:56] raised that baby and he refused to do it
[1:19:58] because he knows what's
[1:20:01] best
[1:20:04] and you didn't go off and pout that's
[1:20:10] right he says and still you love
[1:20:15] him
[1:20:17] that's real Faith hallelujah amen
[1:20:22] anybody when mountains are moving and
[1:20:24] things can have faith but let it go
[1:20:27] backwards one
[1:20:29] time and see how it works then you then
[1:20:33] that's when you prove whether you got
[1:20:35] faith hallelujah or not it's when you
[1:20:39] when you're wanting something and you
[1:20:41] lose
[1:20:44] it and you're left standing
[1:20:51] going you've met all the requirements
[1:20:55] you've checked all the
[1:20:59] boxes and God still says
[1:21:04] no but as Christians we rest in his nose
[1:21:10] yeah that's right just as much as is
[1:21:15] yeses and that's a hard thing to do in
[1:21:18] lady OA because when we want it we get
[1:21:23] it right yeah and if and if and if we
[1:21:26] want it if we want it fast we just got
[1:21:28] to pay more money and it's
[1:21:32] overnighted right we live in the world
[1:21:35] where we where there isn't really any
[1:21:38] needs it's all just
[1:21:43] want we we live in
[1:21:45] abundance right for the most part what
[1:21:48] right but but but contentment is
[1:21:50] priceless
[1:21:57] you know God is God is is you know we we
[1:22:00] we talk about Revival right we talk
[1:22:02] about the bride's
[1:22:04] Revival
[1:22:09] um
[1:22:11] 125 oh so we we talk about
[1:22:15] Revival and and we talk so much about
[1:22:18] the brides re Revival right yes we talk
[1:22:22] about the great outpouring of God and
[1:22:24] Supernatural and days of ananas and
[1:22:29] Safara right and and and we're longing
[1:22:32] for that but but you know I I think in
[1:22:36] the midst of all of
[1:22:42] that
[1:22:45] amen praise
[1:22:49] God in in the midst of
[1:22:54] all those great outpourings of
[1:22:58] God what was the prophet's definition of
[1:23:02] a
[1:23:06] Revival and and so
[1:23:09] if unless you think there's going to be
[1:23:11] two different like do you think your
[1:23:13] Revival is going to be different
[1:23:21] than
[1:23:23] so if we're wanting those
[1:23:27] manifestations what ought we to be
[1:23:33] doing
[1:23:35] amen I think we need to be losing amen
[1:23:39] amen some of the trash that's in our
[1:23:47] lives cuz cuz if we would be honest with
[1:23:50] ourselves we all got it yes it yes amen
[1:23:55] that's
[1:23:57] right but but sometimes if we're trying
[1:24:00] to get somewhere look hey we we may be
[1:24:02] like Paul look Paul had a commission to
[1:24:05] go before Caesar but he had to lose the
[1:24:08] ship in order to get
[1:24:11] there praise God
[1:24:14] Amen right yes so so maybe we need to
[1:24:18] lose the
[1:24:21] ship maybe we need to move lose what we
[1:24:24] think we're going to get
[1:24:26] somewhere maybe we got to lose that in
[1:24:29] order to get there that's right because
[1:24:32] we can have preconceived ideas 1 + 1
[1:24:35] equals 2 and then this and then this
[1:24:38] and and you're wrong wrong
[1:24:41] wrong and you got to lose the ship in
[1:24:44] order to get there that's how God works
[1:24:48] we got to look we we we got to be like
[1:24:50] Paul we're going to go through these
[1:24:52] real fast Paul said I have suffered the
[1:24:55] loss of all
[1:24:56] things you think about this the first
[1:24:59] church messenger the lion the
[1:25:04] lion and he's got one
[1:25:10] quot but he had to lose all
[1:25:13] things and he count him but D that he
[1:25:15] might win
[1:25:17] Christ
[1:25:20] Moses Moses was a mighty man of God
[1:25:25] but he had to
[1:25:26] lose the
[1:25:30] throne and then after that he had to go
[1:25:33] on the backside of the desert and lose
[1:25:36] everything that he thought he gained in
[1:25:38] his wisdom and understanding and when we
[1:25:41] became so broken and
[1:25:44] lost amen
[1:25:47] amen that he would say to God who am I
[1:25:52] that I should go under pharaoh and that
[1:25:54] should bring forth the children of
[1:25:55] Israel out of Egypt and when he said
[1:25:58] that God said you're ready
[1:26:00] hallelujah hallelujah that's what I
[1:26:03] wanted to hear Lord who are we Who Am I
[1:26:07] who are
[1:26:08] we really you who you say you say I'm am
[1:26:13] Brad are we how do we
[1:26:16] know ask all the the the the the the the
[1:26:20] ones that fell away that's rubbish
[1:26:22] sheeps on the side of the the highway
[1:26:24] way of God ask them if they thought look
[1:26:27] at their archives and find out how many
[1:26:30] times they pumped their chest and said
[1:26:32] they were
[1:26:35] bride when when you look at brother
[1:26:37] bram's life look at his life when that
[1:26:41] man that
[1:26:50] man that man held the sword amen amen
[1:26:54] that was pulled out on Joshua yeah
[1:26:58] amen amen unless you believe there's two
[1:27:02] swords but I got a quote says God has
[1:27:04] one sword that's his word so that same
[1:27:08] sword that was poured out on Joshua the
[1:27:11] captain of the Lord's
[1:27:13] host are you for us or against
[1:27:16] us that same sword struck that prophet's
[1:27:22] hand that that Prophet that had those
[1:27:26] Seven Seals revealed to him
[1:27:30] loosed that got caught up in the cloud
[1:27:33] yes that same Prophet that had a
[1:27:37] mountain range that's right with his
[1:27:40] life written across
[1:27:42] it
[1:27:44] right
[1:27:46] what but at the end of his life you know
[1:27:50] what he'd
[1:27:52] say he said says if you call me a
[1:27:55] prophet I want you to hear this is in
[1:27:58] 1964 after the sword in the hand after
[1:28:01] the after after the mountain range after
[1:28:06] him putting the hand on the back of that
[1:28:09] shirt and his hand fitting the angel of
[1:28:11] the Lord perfectly after all of the
[1:28:14] mighty things that happened to him he
[1:28:16] would say this and if you call me a
[1:28:19] prophet I don't say I am but if you call
[1:28:21] me that remember I'm saying to you in
[1:28:24] the name of a prophet see in the name of
[1:28:26] a prophet of Resurrection Rapture will
[1:28:28] be a general all over the entire world
[1:28:30] no matter where you're at when that hour
[1:28:32] comes you'll be called up to meet him
[1:28:35] there's nothing going to stop you no
[1:28:36] matter where you are I only
[1:28:39] hope that I'm
[1:28:47] there what
[1:28:54] he's went beyond the curtain of
[1:28:57] time they they lifted him
[1:29:04] up you think that's artificial humility
[1:29:06] in 64 he's
[1:29:09] saying you think he's being humble and
[1:29:11] proud of
[1:29:16] it he says and I only hope that I'm
[1:29:20] there one of them I just only trust and
[1:29:23] Hope God that I'll be one of them and
[1:29:26] each one of you will be in the
[1:29:32] same I I I got I got I got seven of
[1:29:35] these here I could read to you from 64
[1:29:38] on uh brother brandom says he he says if
[1:29:41] I don't stay with that message I'd be a
[1:29:43] traitor to God and a hypocrite to
[1:29:47] you 60 I I I I mean it what my my whole
[1:29:52] point is what amazes me is brother
[1:29:55] brandom after all of those great
[1:29:57] manifestations he would still say I'm a
[1:30:00] sinner saved by
[1:30:03] grace he would still say I hope that I'm
[1:30:05] here I'm there that day and and and I I
[1:30:09] I've I've I it just struck me a couple
[1:30:11] weeks ago and I've got seven quotes so
[1:30:13] far that I've been I'm sure there's
[1:30:14] countless more but my whole point of it
[1:30:17] is is that man never
[1:30:20] did exalt
[1:30:22] himself right but he stayed
[1:30:25] Little he stayed
[1:30:27] Little and and and and if and if we as
[1:30:31] the people of God ought not we to do the
[1:30:35] same amen ought not we to do the same
[1:30:40] brother Brenham says he said he says it
[1:30:42] isn't just the way that people get today
[1:30:44] let God just bless a fellow and put a
[1:30:46] little confidence in him and he gets all
[1:30:48] to be a know-it-all he gets to be he's
[1:30:50] got to start an organization he's got to
[1:30:52] do something that's different oh you
[1:30:54] know different Revelation different
[1:30:56] Doctrine you
[1:30:58] know but he says how art thou fallen
[1:31:01] from Heaven oh
[1:31:02] Lucifer he said God has a hard time to
[1:31:05] get some drop body that he can deal with
[1:31:08] that'll stay humble and me can stay in
[1:31:10] the place until God calls him to do
[1:31:13] something you believe that see a man
[1:31:15] that God can bless and he'll still keep
[1:31:18] himself a man amen not be an angel or a
[1:31:24] right
[1:31:26] God as soon as man gets blessed and has
[1:31:29] a little something given to him he wants
[1:31:31] to
[1:31:32] become oh
[1:31:34] my well well wait a minute brother Gabe
[1:31:36] I thought we
[1:31:44] were praise God Amen remember brother B
[1:31:49] brother B are are are you are you Christ
[1:31:52] well
[1:31:54] in one
[1:31:57] way in one way you'd make me
[1:32:00] Antichrist but in another
[1:32:06] way he wants to become a god well in one
[1:32:12] way you'd be
[1:32:15] Antichrist in another
[1:32:19] way amen amen
[1:32:24] he wants to become an angel he wants to
[1:32:26] become some great person what I do he
[1:32:29] says me and me and mine and all that
[1:32:32] that's wrong he said attitude God's
[1:32:36] hunting that for somebody who could
[1:32:39] bless he could bless and pour out the
[1:32:41] blessings and more he blessed the
[1:32:44] litterer that's good the man will
[1:32:47] become and you'll never get more of God
[1:32:51] until you become
[1:32:57] nothing you've got to belittle yourself
[1:33:00] he that will exalt himself God will
[1:33:02] bring a base he that will humble himself
[1:33:05] God will exalt you've got to get little
[1:33:08] before you can get big and you'll never
[1:33:12] be big in your own self I love this
[1:33:16] you'll only be as big as God will be big
[1:33:19] in
[1:33:20] youo preach brother Brandon you'll only
[1:33:24] be as big as
[1:33:27] God will be big in
[1:33:30] you so where does our strength come from
[1:33:33] that's it where where does our power
[1:33:35] come from you know where it come from
[1:33:41] Qui
[1:33:42] [Music]
[1:33:44] me the Bible
[1:33:46] says in returning in rest shall you be
[1:33:50] saved in quietness and in confidence
[1:33:54] shall be your
[1:33:57] strength see it it it's not
[1:34:00] about how loud we can be I you don't
[1:34:04] have to prove to your bride to nobody
[1:34:07] that's
[1:34:09] right right matter of fact if you're
[1:34:11] trying to tell me your bride I'm going
[1:34:13] question whether you are or not cuz
[1:34:16] you're trying to convince
[1:34:18] me you know you know I grew up on The
[1:34:21] Other Side Tracks right so so ah this is
[1:34:26] so crude see when I when I was in
[1:34:30] on sister
[1:34:34] Karen the Lord's nudging me so so when I
[1:34:37] was in the streets right you know it was
[1:34:40] all about being a tough guy right and
[1:34:44] and it and and one thing I found in in
[1:34:48] uh when when you was you know it wasn't
[1:34:51] so much the one that was popping off
[1:34:53] yapping
[1:34:57] you don't really have to pay too much
[1:34:58] attention to him you know it's like like
[1:35:01] when I got I got arrested right and I
[1:35:03] got locked up so I went to I had to go
[1:35:05] to the jail housee right went to the
[1:35:06] block so you walk into the block you all
[1:35:09] in the orange you know got the jumpsuit
[1:35:11] on and uh and I remember I was down uh
[1:35:15] in uh uh a bigger a bigger County Jail
[1:35:18] uh down by Indianapolis and it was you
[1:35:20] know the big boys right so so I walk in
[1:35:22] the block and
[1:35:24] and uh there's this one guy and he's
[1:35:28] yapping and he yapped the whole time I
[1:35:30] was there I was a short timer so I
[1:35:32] wasn't going to Yap back but but all the
[1:35:34] yapping he was doing I wasn't worried
[1:35:37] about him there a bit cuz he was trying
[1:35:40] to prove to everybody that he was the
[1:35:42] tough guy of the
[1:35:43] block but I wasn't worried about him cuz
[1:35:47] I saw through him that he was just
[1:35:49] trying he was trying to put people on
[1:35:51] Front Street you see understand what I'm
[1:35:53] saying you know who I was watching for I
[1:35:57] was watching for that quiet
[1:35:59] one right I they called him the old head
[1:36:02] I was I was looking for the old head
[1:36:05] because that's the one you know don't
[1:36:08] play cuz he knows who he
[1:36:12] is and if you try to test him on who he
[1:36:15] is he's going to prove to you who he
[1:36:18] is right and and in this thing called
[1:36:21] life friends when you see people trying
[1:36:24] to look you have to have that's that's
[1:36:27] my I know that's so crude
[1:36:31] but but but when you have that quiet
[1:36:35] confidence you know who you
[1:36:38] are and it don't matter what anybody not
[1:36:41] that you I I care what you think about
[1:36:44] me but it's a balance but I don't let
[1:36:46] how you think about me control me that's
[1:36:49] right you understand what I'm saying if
[1:36:51] I did I would be trying to talk like
[1:36:54] brother
[1:36:57] Emanuel I would be trying to preach like
[1:36:59] brother
[1:37:00] Chad right but but I'm not brother
[1:37:04] Emmanuel and I'm not brother Chad right
[1:37:08] and and so the thing of it is because we
[1:37:11] are not trying to conform the image
[1:37:13] we're trying to conform is to the image
[1:37:15] of Jesus
[1:37:17] Christ that's who we're trying to be
[1:37:20] like that's the image that matters
[1:37:24] and and and and when we come to that
[1:37:26] spot it gives us it that's where you
[1:37:29] find your
[1:37:31] strength that's right because God Made
[1:37:36] You To Be
[1:37:39] You
[1:37:42] amen you are part of that bouquet
[1:37:45] bride but you have to have
[1:37:48] confidence in the in the part of that
[1:37:51] bouquet that you are
[1:37:54] and it takes a
[1:37:56] molding and it
[1:37:59] takes a loss of ourself yes sir right
[1:38:04] and I know I'm going long but but but
[1:38:07] listen you know when when when Jo
[1:38:17] when look when Joseph was in that
[1:38:22] pit right
[1:38:25] do you think if if Pharaoh would have
[1:38:27] picked him up the next day he would have
[1:38:30] had the grace in his heart that he would
[1:38:32] be able to say when he was on uh when he
[1:38:35] was right there in the palace he' be
[1:38:38] able to say now therefore be not grieve
[1:38:39] nor angry with yourselves that you sold
[1:38:42] me hither for God did send me before
[1:38:45] you to preserve
[1:38:49] life all of those losses in his life
[1:38:54] were transformed into
[1:38:57] gains and if he didn't have all of those
[1:38:59] losses in life he would never have the
[1:39:02] character to be able to say those
[1:39:04] words he would never have the
[1:39:07] understanding to be able to say what he
[1:39:09] said and do what he did to preserve the
[1:39:12] nation of
[1:39:15] Israel and the same thing holds true for
[1:39:17] us the losses that we have in life are
[1:39:21] really for our gain they're really for
[1:39:24] our good do you think David look at
[1:39:27] David when he lost
[1:39:29] everything that man had to fight after
[1:39:32] he was anointed not with a vial manmade
[1:39:36] not Anointed with a horn of oil God
[1:39:39] made right when he was anointed he he
[1:39:43] was ran down like a
[1:39:46] dog but once he come to the throne he
[1:39:50] had the own his own kingdom ripped from
[1:39:52] him
[1:39:53] by his own
[1:39:55] blood and when he lost
[1:39:58] everything and and that and that one his
[1:40:01] Thro spitting on
[1:40:04] him and and one of his rightand man
[1:40:08] would pull out the
[1:40:09] sword I'll take his head off David
[1:40:13] said let him
[1:40:16] alone let him curse for the Lord hath
[1:40:19] bidden
[1:40:22] him see it was the losses that he had
[1:40:25] gave him the ability to say what he said
[1:40:28] that's right and if we want to say the
[1:40:30] right thing we have to see the losses in
[1:40:32] our life and see that our losses have
[1:40:34] purpose and
[1:40:35] meaning because the only way we really
[1:40:37] grow is through
[1:40:40] loss it's when we lose is really when we
[1:40:43] gain it's when God it's those are
[1:40:45] teachable moments in our life look you
[1:40:48] little ones think about this when non
[1:40:51] was a leper think about that little Maid
[1:40:54] nonon was a captain of the host of the
[1:40:56] king of Syria and the syrians had gone
[1:41:00] out by companies and brought away
[1:41:02] captives out of the land of Israel that
[1:41:05] little itty bitty
[1:41:08] girl she lost
[1:41:14] everything the innocence of a
[1:41:17] childhood the love of Mom and Daddy and
[1:41:20] protection and now she's carried away a
[1:41:24] captive but you know what her loss was
[1:41:29] really a gain to be a missionary amen
[1:41:32] amen praise
[1:41:34] God because that little missionary
[1:41:37] Spirit came to life in the middle of her
[1:41:40] loss Hallelujah and when she could have
[1:41:42] been bitter about everything that was
[1:41:45] taken away from her she chose
[1:41:49] life and the persons that had captivated
[1:41:54] her she witnessed to yes and say there's
[1:41:57] a man that can set you
[1:42:03] free brother that it's just it's it's
[1:42:06] just all throughout the
[1:42:10] scriptures as as you look you look at
[1:42:13] look look at look at
[1:42:14] Samson when Samson lost
[1:42:18] everything he lost his
[1:42:20] Prestige of being the great anointed
[1:42:22] even though he's little bitty shrimp the
[1:42:24] great anointed
[1:42:28] man lost his Seven
[1:42:30] Locks lost his
[1:42:33] eyes and he's grinding on the
[1:42:39] meal there's several quotes where
[1:42:41] brother BR said those Seven Locks growed
[1:42:42] out how long did it
[1:42:46] take how many revolutions did he make
[1:42:52] grinding
[1:42:53] thinking about that lustful devil that
[1:42:57] took everything away from
[1:43:02] him how many countless
[1:43:06] nights everything
[1:43:12] gone but he
[1:43:14] said just once more Lord
[1:43:18] amen
[1:43:19] just once more amen
[1:43:23] and the Bible
[1:43:26] says let me die with the Philistines and
[1:43:30] he bowed himself with all of his might
[1:43:32] and the fell and the house fell upon the
[1:43:34] Lords and upon all the people that were
[1:43:37] therein so the dead which he slew at his
[1:43:40] death were more than they which he slew
[1:43:43] in his
[1:43:46] life what did Samson have to
[1:43:49] do he had to lose his life in order to
[1:43:53] keep
[1:43:56] it I don't want to just have some
[1:44:03] victories I want to live a Victorious
[1:44:08] life
[1:44:10] amen as the musicians would
[1:44:16] come but in order for us to live a
[1:44:18] Victorious Life
[1:44:23] we first have to realize am I in the
[1:44:26] fight or
[1:44:31] not I I don't know about
[1:44:35] you I don't I don't want to be just glad
[1:44:38] that I'm no longer in that
[1:44:41] lifestyle that I'm no longer in the
[1:44:43] orange
[1:44:44] jumpsuit that I no longer have to worry
[1:44:46] about when the red and blue lights get
[1:44:49] behind me what I got in the car
[1:44:53] I I I'm thankful for those things but
[1:44:55] that's still not it you can be cleaned
[1:44:59] up and still full of
[1:45:02] devils you can have a Ministry and still
[1:45:04] be full of
[1:45:07] devils gifts gifts that gifts and
[1:45:09] callings is without repentance that's
[1:45:12] right but we have to come to the
[1:45:14] realization
[1:45:16] Lord am I really found that's right
[1:45:19] that's exactly and listen young ones
[1:45:23] little ones look you ain't got to go out
[1:45:26] into the world maybe just play something
[1:45:28] quiet just something
[1:45:31] sister maybe that quiet
[1:45:36] me look all of us you young Brothers you
[1:45:40] young sisters you you got to come to the
[1:45:47] spot where you come to a messy birth

[1:45:56] and that cell phone got a hold of you
[1:45:58] and you on things that you shouldn't
[1:46:01] be that's not
[1:46:03] it you ain't got to be tantalized with
[1:46:06] the world and tempted but look at an
[1:46:08] early
[1:46:11] age you can surrender your life
[1:46:15] right look I'll be honest with you when
[1:46:18] when I hear our pastor preach some of
[1:46:20] the messages that's being said in the
[1:46:22] ministry and I look at the altar and I
[1:46:24] think why ain't it

[1:46:36] be every one of us young and old is
[1:46:41] there no need for us to pour

[1:46:53] don't have to go to an altar but what

[1:47:09] here we ain't playing

[1:59:07] I that's being honest with yourself and
[1:59:10] taking inventory of your
[1:59:13] life you know if anybody ever take
[1:59:15] inventory in your
[1:59:17] job I remember being at the working at
[1:59:20] at the Applebees and

[1:59:24] okay there may be a little one here that
[1:59:26] needs break through or something
[1:59:29] so right I remember I remember being a a
[1:59:33] a manager assistant man kitchen manager
[1:59:36] at Applebees and every software we had
[1:59:38] to go take inventory we get the
[1:59:39] clipboard out and we had a par we had to
[1:59:42] look here say we got three cans of beans
[1:59:44] and supposed to be five we had to go
[1:59:47] through and itemize every aspect of that
[1:59:50] kitchen and we had to to get it to
[1:59:53] par because of what is
[1:59:56] depleted we had to go order more to get
[1:59:59] us to par to make it through to the next
[2:00:05] order and so we'd have to take inventory
[2:00:08] to make sure we got
