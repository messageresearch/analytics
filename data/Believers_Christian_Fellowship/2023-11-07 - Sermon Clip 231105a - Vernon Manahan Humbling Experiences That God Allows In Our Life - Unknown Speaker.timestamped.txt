[0:00] the next years that happened in the next
[0:02] few years uh he was attending a church
[0:05] and he became eventually he became a
[0:08] preacher from a boxer to a preacher all
[0:11] right and if your pastor is a is a
[0:13] former
[0:14] boxer and you know people will just obey
[0:16] the pastor right okay so so here is
[0:20] George foran now then he he said it it
[0:24] took a humbling experience for him to
[0:29] know the Lord without because he was so
[0:31] full of Pride he was popular he had this
[0:35] reputation of being a good boxer and God
[0:39] has to strip everything away amen it
[0:43] took a humbling experience for him and
[0:46] so when he did that when that thing
[0:48] happened to him he started serving the
[0:50] lord he became a preacher and many years
[0:53] later we'd go back to the ring and and
[0:55] fight and God uh uh allowed him I don't
[1:00] know what uh if that is good or not but
[1:03] I mean he allowed him to be Champion
[1:05] again at the age of 45 and there was a
[1:09] part of his testimony he said when he
[1:10] was young he will he will fight and try
[1:13] to finish the game for the first two
[1:15] rounds but when he got older in This
[1:18] heavyweight championship that was that
[1:20] happened in 1994 he said he was he had a
[1:23] lot of
[1:24] patience he was waiting and waiting and
[1:28] waiting he was he was telling the and
[1:30] the testimony in one of the churches and
[1:32] he was waiting and waiting and waiting
[1:34] not unlike when he was
[1:36] younger that he was he always he was so
[1:39] aggressive but this time he's waiting
[1:41] and waiting waiting for the right time
[1:43] and then when he he saw the right time
[1:45] and then bum ented a knockout he became
[1:48] the oldest heavyweight champion of the
[1:50] world at the age of 45 now I while I was
[1:53] looking at it you we can apply that in
[1:55] our spiritual life When We Were Young we
[1:57] are so aggressive we think that that we
[2:00] can do so many things according to our
[2:02] abilities according to our intellect
[2:04] according to what we want but when we
[2:06] get older in serving the lord we learn
[2:08] to wait we we learn to wait on God we
[2:12] learn to wait for God there's a timing
[2:16] and we realize that it's not our
[2:19] sufficiency God is our sufficiency the
[2:21] only way with that we can we can we can
[2:24] accomplish anything even in I'm a
[2:27] minister for for 25 years years uh when
[2:32] I was young I thought that I could I've
[2:35] been accomplishing things for the Lord
[2:38] but then I realized that as I got older
[2:40] without the grace of God without his
[2:43] leading without his anointing without
[2:46] his
[2:48] inspiration nobody can be blessed in the
[2:50] ministry that the Lord has entrusted me
[2:53] and every time I think that the people
[2:55] are blessed in the word that I preach
[2:58] they are not blessed but every time that
[3:01] I feel that I did not do my job well
[3:05] somebody will approach you and they will
[3:06] say that they were blessed and you know
[3:09] that you know that it was not you
[3:11] because you know in yourself that
[3:13] you you're not even sure of what you
[3:16] were preaching and so this this this
[3:19] testimony this humbling experience that
[3:22] the Lord gives us it is part of our
[3:24] learning in life amen
