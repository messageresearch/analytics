[0:00] i remember the testimony of sister viola
[0:02] yingst and sister viola yanks you know
[0:04] she she went through the prayer line on
[0:06] her 40th birthday
[0:08] in july i believe in 1963 in the message
[0:10] i think if i i i might have it wrong but
[0:13] i think it's he cares do you care
[0:15] and if you listen to that tape the first
[0:17] person through the prayer line is sister
[0:18] viola ying she had prayer card number
[0:20] one on her 40th birthday
[0:23] and she goes through the prayer line and
[0:25] there's several things amen that was
[0:27] going on in life and brother ben begins
[0:29] to discern i see you have a thyroid
[0:31] condition i see a doctor and you've got
[0:33] spiritual troubles you don't know
[0:34] whether you're in you don't know whether
[0:35] you're out and that was because she was
[0:36] just coming to the message and the rest
[0:37] of her family wasn't seeing it yet and
[0:40] she was on thyroid medication and he
[0:41] says i see you holding your head i may
[0:43] not be quoting this exactly right but
[0:45] but you understand
[0:47] you've got bad headaches
[0:49] and sister viola told me that brother
[0:52] ben prayed for her and she left she said
[0:54] instantly she quit taking her thyroid
[0:55] medicine and had no more problems with
[0:57] her thyroid that moment
[1:00] and then
[1:01] her and brother ed got a revelation of
[1:03] the message together and and the family
[1:05] come to the message together and the
[1:07] spiritual trouble settled out
[1:09] but she said she had to wait multiple
[1:12] years before she was finally delivered
[1:14] of migraine headaches
[1:16] and some of the family here might
[1:17] remember i don't remember but it was
[1:19] years and years and years it was a long
[1:21] time
[1:22] and it was the same sister coming before
[1:24] the same prophet
[1:26] believing the same word and having the
[1:28] same prayer
[1:29] one is healed instantly one is he uh one
[1:33] comes one deliverance comes shortly
[1:34] thereafter and one she has to wait for
[1:37] multiple years before it's fulfilled i
[1:39] say sister viola yinks is going to be
[1:41] able to stand on that day and say mr
[1:42] impatient you're wrong
[1:45] you're wrong abraham's going to be able
[1:47] to stand and say mr impatient you're
[1:49] wrong 25 years i waited but god was true
[1:52] to his word amen mr impatient you're
[1:54] wrong sister viola can say mr impatient
[1:56] you're wrong brother bernie can say mr
[1:58] impatient you're wrong
[2:01] brother bernie got a terrible case of
[2:02] shingles that left him with nerve damage
[2:04] and he had pain for years amen he prayed
[2:08] believed god was anointed with oil and
[2:10] stood by his confession and after five
[2:12] years god removes it
[2:14] in a moment with no explanation it's not
[2:16] explainable how it went away even the
[2:18] doctor told brother bernie that it
[2:20] doesn't that doesn't see any way that
[2:22] you'll be healed you'll probably live
[2:23] this way
[2:25] because these things there's no there
[2:26] was no healing that the doctors could
[2:27] give for that
[2:31] what do you say brother bernie is mr
[2:33] impatient wrong he's wrong he's wrong
[2:36] he's a liar
[2:39] praise be to god
[2:42] these
[2:43] this mr impatient whispers in your ear
[2:47] this mr skeptic comes in worship
[2:49] whispers in your ear this mr unbeliever
[2:52] comes and worships in your ear trying to
[2:54] get you to deviate off the word of god
[2:56] and lose confidence
