name we pray amen amen let's all stand let's read a scripture and pray together and then we've got some talking to do amen let's go to first thessalonians 5 18. first thessalonians 5 18. also um i received a text message that was forwarded to me and i haven't had time to validate this information so if it's false i'm very very sorry for that but i've heard twice that it may be true that brother donny reagan is requesting prayer for his daughter erica who's age 40 and they found a tumor on her liver the text i said that was sent to me said that the doctor said the tumor didn't originate there but she's going for further testing and brother donnie's asking for prayer so we want to hold our brother and sister up and the whole family up in prayer and their whole assembly as we as we pray with the scripture so let's read this together first thessalonians 5 18 in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you amen let's bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father for this day that you've given us to be upon this earth lord to shine forth your glory to sing your praises to minister lord your word god we pray that you would open this

god i pray you would take control of the service i pray you calm every spirit lord that you would take every evil spirit and move it out of the way knowing that your holy spirit might have free reign in our hearts and lives no we pray for our brother donnie for his daughter erica for their children and spouses and all that's associated with the whole church lord that's our brother our sister this is a family lord that's going through a trial we just want to bind our faith with theirs and as your children we want to bind together with our brothers and sisters and ask that you would deliver lord that you would heal that you would show yourself mighty on their behalf lord and god that there would come forth a tremendous testimony lord that would encourage your bride around the world god be high and lift it up in every situation and bring forth your glory we pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless you as you're seated so like i said we've got some talking to do we find ourselves in a different situation than we found ourselves in a wednesday since from wednesday to today allen county has went under a mandatory mask order from the governor from the department of health and so you know that's that's a change in what's been going on that order is actually a different direction than the way things have been going and it caused a lot of for me a lot of misunderstanding a lot of uh soul searching trying to understand what we're supposed to do now and it came about i guess thursday night was the decision or thursday went into effect friday night at 6 pm for allen county for everyone this order is different than the other orders because this order isn't specific to an entity a church or a business this order is specific to the individual it's no longer a business and mandates for a business it's no longer a church of mandates for a church but now this order moved from the church from the entity from the businesses and put it upon the people now each individual is responsible for this for this order so the church hasn't had to change anything we as an assembly we haven't had to change anything we haven't had to do anything uh differently uh what we're doing is fine what we're doing is in compliance with everything we've been asking in fact the restrictions were reduced for us as a church and that stayed the same but this changes for the individual and so i want to talk about that today and talk about what that what i believe that means and more than anything i just want to share with you uh the result of a wrestling match that i've had with myself over the last couple of days because i feel like i've been through gethsemane again and you know some of us are wearing masks some of us aren't but you know there's a lot of reasons for that some of us drove from outside the county and may not have realized that we're under this mandate some maybe maybe we thought that we're still under a religious exemption and it didn't apply in the church maybe somebody has a medical exemption and they by law they have a right not to wear the mask so maybe we just didn't have time to thoroughly consider the implications of what it meant for us or didn't know maybe we just felt like we would get to church and find out what happens there you know there's a lot of reasons for somebody wearing one and not wearing one so this morning just relax just relax let me share from the scripture from the word what i've been wrestling with and and let god speak out of his word to us and bring to us a proper understanding of what he wants from us the one thing i don't want to do is i don't want anybody to look around and judge i don't want anybody feel uncomfortable these things are new we don't know how to handle them we've never handled these things before we've never been down this road before we've never been asked to make these decisions as believers before this is our first time we may stumble around a little bit we may not exactly hit the mark first time out but by the grace of god he's going to bring us to where he wants us in his word he's going to guide us he's going to direct us we're going to know what he wants his bride to do and the bride will submit to what he wants so let's take our bibles and turn to first peter chapter two and we're gonna read several scriptures together share several quotes and if i if i could i have the liberty just to share my own wrestling match and use myself as an example because i'm an easy target first peter chapter 2 verse 13. submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme or unto governors as the to them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers and for the praise of them that do well for so is the will of god that with well doing you may be you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the servants of god honor all men love the brotherhood fear god honor the king servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the forward for this is thank worthy if a man for conscience towards god endure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it if when we be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently but if then you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with god so this is the first scripture that i want to look at that i've been looking at and wrestling with and there's a couple statements that i want to pull out of here submit yourselves verse 13 to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake that's a this is a scriptural mandate coming from peter that has no wiggle room amen and we'll talk about i mean immediately all of everybody's minds or many people's minds goes but this but this but this but this but just let me finish talking because there are butts right and brother bam talks about that and we'll talk about that but we want to make sure we want to make sure that for me i shouldn't say we i'll say me for chad lamb this issue became an issue of self-will it was not an issue of serving god but initially i tried to make it an issue of serving god and i tried to use my own religious pride to justify my disobedience to the authorities and i've had to wrestle that out with myself through a lot of tears and a lot of prayer and a couple sleepless nights but i wrestled it out and i found out that the real problem i was having with this order wasn't my worship to god my real problem i was having this order with this order was my pride it was the real issue that i was struggling with personally was my own personal pride and i had to go through gethsemane again and die to my own pride because initially when anything is said about the church about the word or if anything even remotely applies i'm ready to take up arms and fight right but fighting is not always what god wants there may be a time to resist there may be a time to stand fast but we have to know what that time is when we're there and when we're not and the only guiding principle that i know that i can rely on is the word because my reasoning failed me my own desires failed me what i thought was spiritual i found out was carnal in myself and i'm not putting that off on anybody else that's just me what i thought was spiritual i later realized was carnal and so it says submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme or to governors as to them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers and for the praise of them that do well let's keep reading and there's a word i want to pull out here for so is the will of god that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness that's an interesting statement we're free we're free unto god we don't worship god by the permission of government that right we don't worship god by permission of government we should worship god by commandment of the word but let's not use our freedom our liberty as a cloak of maliciousness and this word maliciousness means malignant malice ill will desire to injure wickedness depravity wickedness that is not a shame to break laws and i didn't make that up it was right there it is wickedness that is not ashamed to break laws and so let's just keep looking let's go to titus chapter 3. titus chapter 3 verse 1 put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work to speak evil of no man to be no brawlers but gentle showing all meekness unto all men so here paul the apostle is telling timothy to teach this to the believers put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers and to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work now let's go to colossians together colossians chapter 3 verse 22. colossians 3 and 22 servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh not with eye service as men pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing god and whatsoever you do do it heartily as to the lord and not unto men knowing that of the lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance for you serve the lord christ so even in a servant in a master relationship not just the good but the forward also the evil the wicked god is saying the way you serve them is the way you serve me that that you serve them as unto the lord not not in men pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing god so whatever we do do it heartedly ask to the lord and not unto men and see i titled this this morning giving to caesar to please the lord not giving to caesar to please caesar but giving to caesar to please the lord let's turn together to romans 13. romans 13 and verse 1. this is the i would say this way this is the scripture that pierced my soul this scripture right here in it and it brought me down i was wrestling with these things i was debating wrestling with myself asking the lord for answers for direction what should we do what do you want done and you know i had some conversations with different brothers and i had two brothers in the assembly that made comments to me that just kind of peeled away some of my reasoning and i realized after talking to them that i was trying to justify my own reasoning but i come to this scripture then after that and it pierced me through and romans chapter 13 says let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be ordained of god whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist this shall receive to themselves damnation so let's back up and read that again because it's in multiple readings where i was slayed again and again and again let every soul be subject to the higher powers for there is no power but of god but the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise the same for he is the minister of god to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is minister for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that do with evil wherefore you must needs be subject not only for wrath here's another kicker but also for conscience sake not just because you'll get in trouble or you'll get a ticket or you'll get a fine or you'll have to pay back taxes or you could get arrested that's not not for wrath's sake do we obey therefore you must need to be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake for your own conscience with god for this cause pay you tribute also for they are god's ministers attending continually upon this very thing render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honor to whom honor see i i sat my family down last night late like 8 30 and i explained to them that i read these scriptures and we talked and i shocked the daylights out of them because what they were hearing from me was different than what i told them last night i had a different opinion i had reasonings for my difference of opinion i had an action plan that i thought was right and i was i was working it out thinking that we'll be right we can do this and we can whatever and so when i when i sat them down and went through these scriptures and i began to tell them what the scripture says and what i was seeing i mean my family was shocked because they were hearing different out of me so many of you have been hearing me speak maybe differently with a different slant and a different angle on on this but if i have and if i've influenced you i'm sorry i don't i don't want to do that i don't want to influence anybody the wrong way but what i want to do is realize that we do influence each other we have a lot of influence over each other and sometimes our influence is not righteous sometimes our influence is just to try to get other people to see it our way because if many people who are good believers see it our way we believe it's the right way and really what we want to do is see it the scriptural way what does the bible say what does god want from me as an individual in this circumstance today what is my responsibility to christ in this situation not what is my responsibility to the church to other believers but what's my responsibility to christ i mean even coming here and having to have this conversation is not fun for me i don't like it having to wear a mask in the church i don't want to do it i don't do it for me and i don't do it for governor dewine i do it for christ because he told me to i don't want to i don't want to talk like this i don't want to repent to my family and tell them that i have a lord's leading me another way that i don't want to have to tell you that i had uh you know had the wrong idea because of selfishness and pride i don't want to have to come around back with a mask on my face and face all you guys that way but he that will humble himself will be exalted and when you find out that you've not really had the right attitude with the word then it's easy just adjust your attitude to the word and forget about what people think and forget about who's judging you i know who i have to stand before i know who has a string ideas this way and who has extreme ideas this way i know who's judging my comments now and who's not i know i know the possibility of backlash on either side i understand that but one thing that i will not do if i can help it by the grace of god is knowingly go against what god tells me to do if it if it it's cost me and it's costing me and it probably will cost me some more and i want to say that's a good thing that's a good thing you know some people may not have wore mass today because they would have felt funny when somebody looked at him funny that'd have been me somebody wouldn't have wanted the criticism that comes from being unchristianized for giving up your religious rights when in fact i don't see any religious right that was given up that's the real situation i had to be honest with what religious right was given up what brother ma'am used the scripture all the time give unto caesar with a caesar and then the gods what is god's okay and i will give caesar this but i'll give god this but when i thought about my reasoning was i just want to worship with freedom nothing over my faith and and all of these things that i was telling myself and really i just didn't want to wear a mask the reality was i just didn't want to wear a mask and the truth was i was using religious reasons and rhetoric to justify my own desire not to wear a mask but was my reasoning for god or was my reasoning for me that's the million-dollar question that we all need to ask ourselves was my reasoning for god or was my reasoning for me why why did i feel like that somehow i would be off the word or displeasing to god if i worshiped him with a mask on my face why what scripture was i reading what scripture forbade me to do that what scripture limited me in any way from worshiping god with the mouth what scripture and i had to come to terms with the fact no scripture what scripture was i violating by wearing a mask i had to i had to answer myself honestly no scripture i wasn't violating any scripture and i may be missing something you may know something i don't know you may have already wrestled this out and have the answer but i didn't have the answer but for me to move forward without a mask i would have to say there is a scripture that i am going against the scripture to obey those that are in authority i have to i have to disobey this scripture to disobey this order that's just the honesty we have to come down to and i'm not saying that that's wrong there's times as there's orders and laws that will come down that have in the past and will come down that must be disobeyed but they're disobeyed because the word says not because i don't want to not because it's uncomfortable i'm ashamed i'm embarrassed it makes me feel funny and i'm worried about what other people will think of me that's a horrible reason to forfeit the word of god for my own self-will and that's where i was at friends and i was groping struggling you know why i prayed so much didn't take very long to find these scriptures it was very quick but you know what i was praying so much i was wrestling with god i laid on my face and wept before the lord because i wanted him to show me a way around the scripture and that's why i had two sleepless nights that's why i prayed for hours and hours and hours is because i wanted god when i get down to the honesty above all honesty religious rhetoric would say oh i just want to find the will of god his will is his word he gives you his will in his word and so when it come down to it i was begging god to show me a way around this ordinance and then i went through all the same reasoning you go through but is it really a law i mean it's the department of health allen county said they're not going to enforce it if they don't enforce it is it really a law the bible doesn't say if it matches the constitution do you understand we get so much americanism in our mind we get so much laodicea in us people's rights and and our rights and and i got rights to this and legally they can't and the law says and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah when the bible doesn't say that say if it's a magistrate obey them if it's a governor obey them if it's a king obey them it didn't tell me if what they said matches the constitution that sounds funny but that's exactly where our minds have been carnal carnal carnal well it won't hold up in court will it hold up in god's court that's my question i had to ask myself what about i'm not worried about man's court what about god's court well my action with my attitude and my approach and my self-will will it hold up in god's court when he asked me why did you not keep this scripture can is the answer i give him going to satisfy him or is the answer i'm giving to everyone else satisfying me and trying to satisfy them i mean i think this trial is specifically designed to break me and if it has any other effect on you that's fine too but i believe that this this ordinance this trial these circumstances as they change and they fluctuate and and it goes one way it goes in i believe it's all all come down to break chad lamb to break my self-will to break my selfishness to break my pride and if it accomplishes that i say god did a good job and if this one don't do it the next one will and then the next one will chip away what's left and the next one will grind the powder away until eventually you have a bride that's absolutely submissive and wants no mind of her own and has no desire for self-will and she is broken and she is bare and she is honest and says not my will but thine will be done we say that but sometimes god puts us in situations where we actually have to face it you know we talk death to self death to self death to self is an easy thing to ring off the lips and it is the true desire of our heart but when it really comes down to nuts and bolts death to self is hard it takes sacrifice and it takes laying your life down and moving on to the altar of sacrifice and being burnt cut bleed out so that christ can live it took me like i said a lot of wrestling i didn't send any notification to the church because i didn't know what to notify until last night i didn't know what to notify and still in my human spirit i was waffling but in my soul i knew what god was asking me to do and so there had to come a submission you know the whole wrestling match in gethsemane was was wrestling between jesus christ own self-will in the word of god and his wrestling and guessing he was wrestling and that wrestling brought him into agony he knew what the father said he knew what the scripture said he already testified before what was going to happen he knew the word but when it come down to facing the word gethsemane was all about destroying self-will and laying self-will on the altar of god's will and jesus christ born in perfect flesh with no sin when he come to that wrestling match he wrestled it out so much that the sweat was falling as great drops from a blood of great drops of blood from his from his brow amen what do you think that's going to do to us amen when we've got you know a carnal spirit that tries to influence us in a in a body that's not been changed yet amen we've got to stick with the word and stay with the word and say god i've got to die to this and so gethsemane to me is the wrestling match between self-will and god's will and it sounds easy but it's harder than we think and i wonder how much harder it will get yet why because god wants his bride to be perfected by the word see we have a headship and that headship is in our thinking or our reasoning are our spiritual religious justifications but the headship is the word brother branham i'm just going to use some examples of brother benham just to to paint the picture in the message it is the rising of the sun he says as i was tired my arm hurting me from shots that the nurse gave me for leave overseas now as you know in a few days and i must have these shots son and i with cholera yellow fever and everything i was pretty weary making me sick which caesar requires to have these shots before you go into the other nation and i said give caesar that which is caesar's but then give god that which is god's and he's talking about the same experience of having these shots several times but i like he adds to it in different places and another message says when i go overseas they give me so many shots that i look like a guinea egg to get into a place where they just the shots with yellow fever and all kinds of toxins they say that keep you from taking it i didn't want to take it but you have to take it anyhow so that's all right see brother rem didn't want to take it but he said you have to take it anyhow give the caesar what caesar's so it's not that obeying giving up your will and obeying it doesn't mean you want to it doesn't mean you even have to like it you don't have to like it and you don't have to want to because brother bam didn't want to and he didn't like it but he did it because that's what the law required and another time he says monday at two o'clock i have to be down to fort knox kentucky to take some more of those shots to go overseas i try to tell them that i don't need it try to tell them that you don't need it i try to tell them i don't need them but they won't listen to me my arms get so sore and i don't need those things the law says i must have them so the bible said give caesar what caesar's god's what's god's so if i have to take the shots and then preach the gospel to them won't i so that'll be getting god what's god's caesar what's caesar's i'll take the shots because that's what caesar wants and then i'll go preach the gospel and then caesar will get what caesar once and god will get what god wants i ask you the question is that true or not true with a mask can caesar get what caesar wants and god will get what god wants i don't care anymore about my rights as an american citizen i don't care anymore i don't want to have to be a constitutional lawyer to figure out if i obey or not i just want to be a child of god i want to be simple i just want if this is what god wants and i have to look like a fool and i have to be uncomfortable and ashamed and feel awkward and hate it every day i still want to be a son of god i want to obedient to my father see we're not wearing a mask because we're afraid of getting a disease right we were here wednesday and we weren't afraid we were here sunday and we weren't afraid in fact there's no mask required in a in a residence inside a residence i had a residence there's no mask required so we can go over there and all of us if we could pile into one residence we could be in there without a mask and not be afraid of getting anything because it's not about being afraid amen if it was fear then we would be wrong because we should trust god brother branham didn't get a yellow fever shot because he's afraid of getting yellow fever so if it's based on fear i say we're wrong take the mask off but if it's obedience to the word i i want to obey the word and that's like i said things have changed for me and my attitude towards this over the weekend but i don't see wiggle room in it i don't see a way around it i can't see i just can't i can't i can't justify it i can't manipulate it anymore and so when we were faced with it we kept kicking it down the road it won't happen it won't happen it won't happen and boy i was praying that it wouldn't happen but then all of a sudden it happens and when it happens we have to ask ourselves what does god want now now i've really got to deal with it and if i don't really take time to consider what god wants to deal with it i'll make the wrong decision i'll make them i'll make a mistake and that's what i was doing not taking time to actually consider scripturally what i'm supposed to do but what i would do is just you know well you know this and that and the other but when it came down to having to do it now now it throws us into desperation and say god what what am i supposed to do now when the when the health department and the governor they give out guidelines i say thank you for the guidelines because i feel no obligation to keep guidelines but when they make it an ordinance in a law that changes it's different so guidelines are guidelines i appreciate your guidelines those are nice guidelines you did a good job on guidelines but when it comes to an ordinance and a mandate it's different it's different it's a lull let's turn to matthew 17. matthew chapter 17. just so everybody knows the person officiating the service is not required to wear a mask who wants to preach praised god nobody wants to preach this service but after that maybe i didn't want to preach this service but i don't want anybody to feel odd in their mind and that's another thing i'd like to see before we go further i've been watching this thing and because of the church and the trustees and i and the deacons we've been trying to read what we can read and i've been trying to read you know what the ohio department of health puts out and the guidelines and what you find many times is what people think is mandate is suggestion or guideline and what people think is guideline is and there's a lot of confusion in this area and some people would look at somebody and think you're breaking the law when they're not breaking the law they're doing exactly like children 10 and under don't have to wear a mask so people with um uh health reasons a medical exemption they don't have to wear a mask they're not breaking any law and so and there's other exemptions there's other reasons other times there's other places and so let's not let's not become self-righteous on the flip side just leave everybody alone because when you read a news article i've read news articles before that rephrase what's in the guideline what's what's in the order and they rephrase it in a way that's misleading but it's not actually what's said so you can't just read the news article and think that you know exactly what the guidelines are because you don't in fact i spent a lot of time friday friday evening and saturday trying to figure out exactly what's required and i still don't know exactly what's required but i know one thing in allen county if you're indoors and not a resident you're supposed to wear a mask i i don't know past that saturday i tried to call the covet 19 state of ohio coven 19 hotline so i called the hotline i waited i got passed on you can tell when you get past and i got passed to a call center in india and an indian woman with a heavy indian accent picked up the phone and i asked some questions and we got nowhere fast so the coven 19 hotline didn't help because i want to know so i'm going to call monday or tuesday pray for me i'm calling monday or tuesday the local health department here in allen county and ask specific questions about every phase of what we're doing can we hear what do we do here what's and then we'll know exactly there won't be any guessing because some people think it means this and some people think it means that and some people think well if you can do this in a restaurant we can do this in the church but because you can do that in a restaurant doesn't mean you can do this in a church all right so pray for me i got a phone call to make and every time i've talked to the health department here in allen county they've been wonderful to deal with it's been easy they've given good answers they've been sympathetic it's been great so i'm praying that god really makes somebody over there have a really good day and that they're in a really good mood because because a lot of the interpretation is up to the local health department and if the local health department says yeah according to the men that you're allowed to do such and such then we're allowed to do such and such so pray that god just shines sunshine down on somebody in the morning there's no traffic on the way to work their coffee tastes better than it's ever tasted so that we can find out because we'll take advantage of any liberty in the law we can have because we're not afraid of disease for me it's just obedience to the lord that's all i want i want to obey the lord at all cost matthew 17 verse 24. matthew 17 24 and when they were come to capernaum they that received tribute money came to peter and said doth not your master pay tribute he saith yes and when he was coming to the house jesus prevented him saying what thinketh thou simon of whom do kings of the earth take customs or tribute of their own children or of strangers peter sayeth unto him of strangers jesus saith unto him then are the children free notwithstanding lest we should offend them lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast a hook and take up the fish and the first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money thou shalt take and give unto them for me and for thee jesus very clearly is king of the earth he every he was in the earth and everything was made by him and for him that was made the fish the coins the gold that caesar stamped his face on was his it was made by him and for him and he says who do who do kings who they take taxes of of their own of their own or of of strangers that are strange and are the children free yeah the children are free but but but because we're here in this order because we're living life this way that day will come in the millennium but so we shouldn't offend them go get a coin and pay the tribute for thee and for me jesus christ obeyed the law of the land so that he wouldn't offend them my if my lord can do that i can do lord help me to do that brother branham says in the message and knoweth it not yesterday coming up in the car we drove it in two days from tucson here right 2 000 miles billy and i and so we now that wasn't breaking any speed laws we stayed right i sat there if he's driving i rolled up my fist back like a shotgun with the hammer back i seen him go over i said wait a minute boy now we're told give caesar what's caesar's how would you like to drive the car next to brother branham he cocked back his hand and you go to the speed limit he punched you down and say wait a minute slow down if you've read the message brother bam talks about not speeding over and over and over it's not a one-off statement it's over and over and over in fact when he was coming up to pray for bill dowell he said he goes i drove everything to get up to him i drove everything that the law would allow and nearly tore the tire off of my car right but not over what the law would allow he drove everything because he had somebody sick he had to get to and heart failure that he had to pray for it's interesting he didn't justify his speeding because of the heart failure see i've had to repent for more than just my attitude about a mask when i go to look at when i go to look at the life of brother branham what he told us and the way he lived as an example to this age i realized it requires total submission total submission not my reasoning away why i don't have to do this and reasoning away why i don't have to do this but total submission is what is requiring and you cannot have total submission till you come to total humility it's easy to become so religious that we can get around simple things like not speeding like being really honest with our taxes and any paperwork we fill out like obeying every ordinance of man it's amazing if religion can allow us to circumvent these scriptures we've read we need to dump our religion and have the life we need to repent and say lord i'm nothing special in this life made of the same dirt everybody else is made of inside is a piece of god absolutely but outside is a piece of dirt that's in the process of being redeemed back to god and god put me subject to local authorities local magistrates and local laws and it doesn't matter whether i think they make sense or don't make sense am i keeping the law is not based on whether or not the law makes sense or not or that i agree with it that's interesting well i didn't have to do that because i didn't agree with it well praise god try that a few times see brother branham was was strict for something like speeding he says here in the statue of a perfect man hebrew children had patience sure they did god had promised them told them don't you bow down to any image but they had patience said our god is able but nevertheless we're not going to bow to your image patience knowing this that god will raise them up in the last days again this life don't mean so much after all see god will raise it up again in the last days but when it comes to bowing to an image we won't do that now we'll give caesar what caesar but when it comes to caesar interfering with god god is first is that true god is first this was one of my justifying quotes self-justification quotes but really when i when i took it back to every example brother had been amused every example is straightforward clear-cut and absolute violation of scripture bowing down to an image is an absolute violation of scripture wearing a mask in church is not what i can find a violation of scripture it violates my comfort level it violates my personal prestige it violates my personal comfort it even it can even hinder my liberty and this was my big stance that i was taking if it hinders liberty to worship then it's wrong but it doesn't hinder god's ability to receive worship i'm only limited by myself my own thinking my own pride my own arrogance my own need to look good feel good be comfortable god's not limited in receiving praise and praise is not limited the limitation to my praise is me and i realized i'm going to have to get over myself see a dead man don't care and i realized i wasn't as dead as i thought i was a dead man don't care what he looks like you can put anything on him you want he don't get offended he don't care what you say about him what you say to him he don't care what you do to him because he's dead and i want to be more dead please god make me more dead make me to where it's not about me it's about you it's about your word it's about staying true to what you told me to do regardless of how it makes me feel regardless of how it makes me look regardless of what i've said in the past and still have to take a strong stance just to pretend to to protect my previous position because a lot of defiance now is people protecting a previous position and not enough pride to say this is different i was too hard-lined i need to change and some of us you get so uh fixated on the image that that we can't back up on something we said before or a position we took or a claim we made i'll never i'm not going to you'll never see me in a and sometimes we look at the scriptures we have trouble in our heart but we come up with spiritual justification not to be right with god but to protect what we said before because i told everybody i'll never wear one of them god has been slaying me slaying me filleting me shaving me down i'm surprised i could still get my suit on this morning he's been cutting me down and cutting me down and cutting me down until i can say what is me and what is god because i was trying to make this god when this wasn't god it was really me you know a lot of people have forced themselves to die on a mountain they didn't need to die on because they were too prideful to say i was wrong and so they stay on the mountain and die on the mountain and i don't want to die on the mountain of my own self-will my own idea my own foolish speaking without thinking i want to die on the altar of sacrifice and let god take me and use me for his glory do what you want with me lord what would happen what would happen if america is invaded tomorrow communists take over russia takes over and we now become a russian proxy with new laws would you still try to live by american laws and think that that would be right with god or would we just subject to the powers that god allowed to be in power and rulership see we've never had to answer that question but we've had brothers and sisters all over the world that have went through that very thing multiple times those little countries in the eastern bloc change hands change hands change rulership change rules change laws and they've been faced with issues like this time and time again but we've been insulated in america amen but now we're seeing the insulation come off and things are beginning to change and now we're having to face things our brothers and sisters have faced for years and we have to say what's god and wants me if god amen if god removes our government and puts russia in place what are we supposed to do get a gun and start shooting people fight what are you fighting for rights what rights see laodicea takes a while to wash out a merit the american spirit takes a while to wash out it's got to be washed out i say god wash it out of me please wash away laodicea wash away all those natural carnal things to where i can take your word and your word only and stand on your word and let your word be my guiding principle and you give me the spirit amen to obey your word at all costs so when it comes to caesar interfering with god god is first of course he said don't you bow to that god said don't you bow to that image and i won't do it our god is able to deliver us if he don't i'll not bow down to that image so here the three hebrew children they had an exact direct violation of a commandment of god and they're commanded to bow before this image which they know is a direct violation of a commandment of god and they refuse but how did they refuse how do they refuse i'm not obeying your stupid law don't you know i serve god and god's better than you you better watch out you're gonna turn to crispy critters in five minutes but that's the very attitude we can have and it does not please god they said o king live forever o king they showed respect honor and reverence these three had obeyed the king in everything they were counselors they were wise men they had obeyed the laws they had obeyed the king they had served the king but they come to a place now when that rule is interfering with god's commandment and they said o king live forever we cannot bow we cannot bow it wasn't arrogant it wasn't brash it wasn't hateful see if god brings the bride which someday i believe god will bring the bride to have to take a stand and have to refuse the king's order but i believe when it comes to that time this is just brother chad it's not going to be well you know maybe it's this maybe it's that it's going to be clear violation of the scriptures a line we can't cross and if we come to that place how what should our attitude be arrogant brash hateful or should it be submissive and gentle and say oh governor o president old judge your honor i'm sorry that it has to be like this i respect you and i respect the laws but i can't cross this line see we this may just be training for what comes next and i want to pass this test so i don't fail the next one i want to have the right spirit i want to have the right attitude the right approach i want to be scriptural in all things i want to be gentle meek kind loving and i'm ashamed of myself for the rough speech in which i've spoken about governments and authorities and i want to apologize to any of you have heard me speak that way i'm sorry i don't agree with what they're doing i personally i personally don't believe all the hype i don't personally believe anything i read coming from the media i don't believe anything the government says i believe the word i personally don't believe that masks are helping that much but that's me i could be wrong what if i make my decision not to wear when i'm wrong because i believe they're not really that effective i believe them you understand it's still me me me me me and my feeling hasn't changed i don't want to wear one i don't know where i'm gonna go out i don't wanna wear one to church i i don't think it's going to solve all the problems i don't think i can't change that thinking but i can change my attitude how i respond to it i can say that's who god put that's who god put an authority over me and i will not speak evil of men i will not speak evil of magistrates and presidents and i can say i disagree with him look how brother branham dealt with john f kennedy brother ben told us that john f kennedy amen the catholic church came in on the back of john f kennedy he told us what was happening he he typed him with ahab but when that man was shot look at the respect and reverence brother branham showed john f kennedy that when he found out he was assassinated he talked to the crowd and he says now i differ with the man and his ideas he said but nobody should be shot down like that and leave that poor mother with them poor babies he did not say well that's what he gets for doing what he was doing but what would you say if anti-mass protesters stormed the capitol building and tore it down would you secretly be happy for them now we're cutting close aren't we i mean i wouldn't do it that's not right to do but i mean if you're going to push to people what do you think is going to happen or would you say that's a shame human beings would act that way it's a shame they would treat a woman that way a man that way to shame somebody would speak evil to somebody else now we're shaving tight now we're doing heart surgery and say god you're supposed i'm supposed to be a reflection of you i don't mind saying i disagree with that i don't think it's the right decision i don't think it's going to help no problem but don't speak evil of people don't speak evil of those who have the rule over us or an authority just say i don't understand why they're doing that you can say what he did was wrong there's nothing wrong with that but don't speak evil and don't wish evil and don't hope that evil things happen to the people i mean what's worse the person who throws the strict brick through the building or the person that enjoyed that somebody else threw the brick through the window how does god see that what does god see when he looks in our heart well i would never throw a brick through the cavity i wouldn't spray paint that message on there but it's the truth i mean do you understand let's let this thing cut us deep let's get cut to ribbons this morning and say god i'm not into politics i want to love the left and the right the same nobody deserves to be evil spoken of nobody deserves to be threatened nobody deserves violent speech being spoke about him nobody deserves that kind of treatment nobody deserves to be afraid or have their family being afraid nobody deserves to be treated evil when they're going to work and doing their job even if i disagree with every decision they make i still want them to be happy have a happy family have a wife be content be safe i don't want anything bad to happen to them and if we do or we're somehow gratified by violent evil conduct because it matches what's in our heart i say before god that god is not separating us too far from the people who do the acts that's just me brother chad i could be wrong but i think our attitude has got to change my attitude i'm not saying anybody else my attitude had to change and that's why god allowed this masked thing to come to allen county so that he could get me on my face so that i could wrestle not with him but with myself until i figured out that i'm the biggest problem in the whole mix god has orchestrated coven 19 for me sorry i apologize to the rest of you but is god correcting you is god fixing you through covet 19 i hope i hope what i believe is that i don't believe i know these are the judgments that are rolling upon the earth because the judgment cycle started back when brother branham threw that stone in the air and and the earthquake hit alaska and he says judgment's beginning on the west coast and we're under judgment cycles this is judgment for the world but at the same time through the same circumstances god is using to judge the world he is perfecting his bride and the very same circumstance judgment on one hand perfection on the other hand and i i don't want to miss the point of the whole show the whole event the whole thing i don't want to miss the point and put them over there and them over there and they're under judgment but now god's allowed to come to my door amen come to my church come to me as a person and to where i have to face myself with this word and i've got to i have got to subdue myself and then i realized that this whole covenant 19 thing and these orders and mandates are here to perfect me because god doesn't want me to continue on the way i am praise be to god see there's many many times in the bible and many times in the history of the church that the people refused to keep the king's commandments but if you watch when they did it was straightforward it was obvious and easily discerned by the scriptures not by making some spiritual parallel and this means this and see that's what i was guilty of trying to do laboring in prayer looking for a type looking for a scripture looking for a scriptural principle that i could use to justify my anti-mask campaign and i laid before the lord and i prayed and i prayed and i prayed and i could not find oh i tried to manipulate a few into place but somehow when i shoved them in they kept popping out shove it in it pops out because it wasn't an exact fit and i realized i spent all this time trying to find a detour around the scriptures when i should have just submitted and obeyed and saved myself a lot of trouble and then i realized the wrestling match for me was the point was the point of the whole thing brother bram says this is another example i want to look at he says in the message once more now we are sorry that we didn't did not have room to accommodate the people each night nearly when i've come up there's been great throngs of people all up and down the street walking trying to get in and some crying some different you know but i know that it's they they have a law here a fire marshal's law just so many you have to leave so much aisles and so forth and they cannot help and that they cannot help because that we are as christians we've got to do that for the bible said jesus told us to give caesar the things that are pertained to caesar and then to god the things that belong to god so we try to and if we will not obey caesar it's doubtful that we'd obey god that's a stinger if we won't obey caesar it's doubtful that we'd obey god and as long as caesar's law doesn't interfere with god's we must obey god first and then these fire hazards and so forth well they know how to take care of that and they told us i was asking for mercy for the people brother branham is going talking to the fire marshal whoever he's talking to he's asking for mercy for the people for them to stretch the law to let him have more people in i asked for mercy for the people seeing them up and down the streets and things and sick and trying to get in and bring them in cabs from across somewhere else in new york or long island and jersey or different places in manhattan well you see but we can only ask and then when i find out that that's the law why he said if the fire marshal would come in and catch us crowded like that we would close the whole meeting so that would cut everybody out so brother branham what was his motive what was his objective to get more sick and needy people into the church so that he could pray for more people because god told him you've got a gift of healing you're going to take a gift of healing to the peoples of the world so he has a justifiable reason to want to pray for the sick people because an angel of the lord told him he was to take a gift of healing to the people of the world you see how easy it is to make the lines fuzzy well this is a greater spiritual reason it'd be easy to make the lines fuzzy but brother branham said well that's the law that's the law he asked for mercy he tried he talked to somebody they explained to him the law he said well that's just it then he didn't say well don't tell nobody just slip a few more in praise god we're dealing with important things we're dealing with praying for the sick preaching the word the gospel going forth people hearing the gospel and brother brahma stayed in the law let's go to acts 23. acts 23 acts chapter 23 and verse 1. and paul earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou wided wall god shall smite thee thou white a walford for sitteth thou to judge me after the law and command us me to be smitten contrary to the law he just defied the law the high priest he commanded him to be smitten contrary to the law verse 4 and they that stood by said revilest thou are reviled us thou god's high priest then said paul i wish not brethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people. paul because of the word backed down it wasn't that what paul said was wrong it was the truth but it was who he was addressing he had another scripture that told him not to address the ruler of god's people that way and paul repented himself and backed down because of the word not because the merit of the high priest because the high priest was wrong had him smitten contrary to the word and i'm sure that paul may have been a little offended in his spirit being smote across the mouth and what he speaks is the truth amen but then when he finds out who he's speaking to then the word comes back to him and says oh i didn't know that was the high priest for the word says i'm not supposed to speak to him that way. i mean my first response my heart i'm like you get him paul he had it coming but paul was ashamed when he found out who that was can we be ashamed of paul because paul violated the word or do we still are we still proud of him [Music] do you understand friends this is the reality of living life in a fallen human body we got way too much fight in us god doesn't want the fight and the bride god wants to fight for his bride he wants us to submit he'll take care of everything else he wants to be the bridegroom he wants to be the king but so many times we want to be the one with the spear and we want to be the one to do the killing when god wants us to just stop and be still and he'll do the killing it's our own personality that gets in the way brother branham is in questions and answers in 64 and he tells this little story he said i'm going to say this just look at a person a few minutes ago it was asked me by a fine boy the other day we was hunting squirrels the morning i got five i left one of them for that afternoon you only get six in the state of kentucky that's the limit so this certain person said i got nine christian boy fine kid christian boy fine kid i got nine i said you done wrong you did wrong he said well i said i had five that morning saved one for that afternoon and when i got that one squirrel looked in the tree and counted five or six setting right there where i could look at them walked out and left them i said i walked up through here not long ago and there was about 15 or 20 sitting there i just took the limit and walked away and left the rest of them there i said if i come to this country preaching to you boys and you people here that things that's right i've got to live that example christianity ain't what you say it's what you live what you do it's an example you're the salt of the earth i said then the law says jesus said you give caesar them things that belong to caesar you break that speed low out there what are you doing you're doing wrong you sin give caesar what's caesar's in god what's god's say well the law's wrong i can't help what wrong it is it's wrong to break jesus's commandment it's good but it hurts it hurts good it's right but it's too right if and if you don't give caesar the things that caesar's then you did what jesus told you not to do and a transgression of the law is sin that right we're all guilty i'm glad he said that we're all guilty we do it but when you see yourself wrong stop it amen amen when you see yourself wrong stop it boy wouldn't that be nice if we could do that and quit playing scenarios in our mind but what if in scripture says it brotherhood says and blah blah blah blah blah and just say i'm wrong i'm going to stop it i'm wrong i'm gonna stop it we're all guilty i'm gonna read that again we're all guilty we do it but when you see yourself wrong stop it people are watching you people won't go to church but they'll read you see what you do so we've got to be right brother rem tells another story of going to africa in 1965 and we've talked about many times you know but just before he left his visa was was was marked that he could come in as a hunter only that he could not preach so there was a restriction put on him by the government and and brother branham was saying before that he definitely felt led of the lord to go to africa that they're going to have big meetings that he's going to go up there like a hunter and he's going to come down amen and they've already got the hall rented and don't even know it we've already got a plan we're going to work this out and he got the visa just a little bit before he left restricted and he said i nearly fainted somebody come on anyways because i thought the lord wanted me to and here he is just before he leaves he's in johannesburg there's a little bitty tape segment at the end of the message of shame and he's talking about this restriction and all of that he's standing outside and they record this he's not allowed to preach but they're outside somebody's private home and he's he's standing there addressing them talking to them and somebody recorded it just while he's speaking and he says here he goes i remember that great meeting here in johannesburg i remember the boy with the short leg coming long again normal and the the lady that little girl was healed from the back condition and her mother fainted and fell back in the cot and brother bannon was speaking and there was an interpreter interpreting in the afrikaans and the interpreters interjects the interpreter speaks in english brother branham that was my wife's cousin years ago that woman who fainted when her little daughter was healed of a background faint and fell back in the car he said that was my wife's cousin brother man said to your wife oh there are so many great things no doubt there was many of those people attended those meetings are with the lord now i've gotten old too since then it won't be too long until we my time to go up then we'll then we will be together forever no visas then listen what he says next i feel like bringing the message but it is written in the scripture given to caesar the things that are caesar's and to god the things that are god's he felt like preaching right there right outside somebody's home i feel like bringing the message but he pulled himself back and pulled his gift back because of what because of what a carnal authority in a visa office stamped on his document and wrote a restriction here the prophet of the age who now is with believers who who i feel like bringing a message pulls his gift and pulls himself back because of what a man wrote on a piece of paper because he subjected himself to the authorities i said oh how easy it would have been for him to just let loose and start preaching sneak in somewhere where they're not looking get into a church but the prophet of god wouldn't would not violate that visa restriction even though he felt it was the leading of the lord to go he felt god wanted him to preach he felt that he should go over there and pray for the sick again but he had to take and surrender his feelings in what he thought was the leading of the lord and it very well was the leading of the lord but not according to what he thought he had to take what he thought the leading of the lord meant and what he thought he was supposed to do and he had to subject it because god allowed that visa to be restricted and if god allowed that visa to be restricted brother branham obeyed what god allowed do you think god allowed the mandate we're under or does he have nothing to do with it it affects his children if god allowed it then what did he allow it for did he allow it for my protest for my defiance for my willfulness to come to the surface yeah so that he can purge it out of me the question is there's coming a time that the bride will have to put god first that you put see give to caesar what caesars give to god what's gone and there come a time in order to give god what is god you're going to have to deny caesar what he's asking for my question to you is this mask order that time and you have to answer that in your own heart is this a direct violation of the scriptures is this the same thing that three hebrew children went through it's the same thing daniel went through is this the same thing that peter went through when they told him not to teach in his name anymore that's a good question god's already answered the question for me but don't take my answer don't take my answer don't take my actions don't look at my family to decide what to do read the scriptures read the bible read the message lay in prayer get humble and broken and throw all self-will out the window and all pride out the window and forget what you've already been blasting off with the mouth telling people for months just just wipe it all away and sit down there and say god what do you want me to do right now with this order i've even was justifying in my own mind but if i give here what next and if we give a little bit here and give a little bit here what next that's a good question what next do we know if there's a next do we know if there's something coming after that there may there may not why why would i disobey the word here because of what might come next i don't know what's coming next i'll deal with it when it comes next why can't we take this by itself and say what does god want me to do with this regardless of what might come next oh praise god i tell you he's been slaying me slaying me all my reasonings all my justifications all my religious surmisings all my types and spiritual types god just pulled the string and they all fell apart and i had to be honest with the scriptures let's look at the scripture together in romans 14. romans 14 1. before we read that i just like to say i think sometimes for me it's the fact that i so know that the bride has to make a stand and i know at some point that the bride is going to have to say no and i believe that so strongly that i'm always watching for that time and if anything gets close i'm ready to go into action instead of waiting for god did say now how does he tell me through his word not my own desire through his word he'll show me through the word and then i make my stand on the word not for my religious freedoms that come from a united states government we don't stand up for that we stand up for the word not for my own willful desire or my own thoughts but we stand for the word god leads us by the word so convinced that there's coming a time when we all come to show down we all have to stay on the word irregardless as if it brings persecution or rejection or or even if legal consequences there may come a time for that when that time comes i want to be able to make that stand but i i feel like we're so confident that that's coming and we're so confident that we're on the precipice of that possibly that we're ready to spring into action anytime anything looks like it might be that instead of waiting and saying is this that is this this time is it contrary to scripture is it forbidding me from keeping the word is this time to defy or is this not time to defy so good questions really good questions romans 14 verse 1. i'm going to use this as an analogy but the analogy doesn't fit exactly so just don't don't let me explain after after i read this let me look here at yeah romans chapter 14 verse 1 him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eat his herbs let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him that he does not judge him that eateth for god hath three god hath received him who art thou that judgest another man's servant to his own master he standeth her falleth yea he shall be holding up for god is able to make him stand one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord and he that regardeth not the day to the lord he does not regard him he that eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that he is not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks for none of us liveth to himself and no man die to himself for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord and whether we live therefore or die we are the lords for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and the living but why does thou judge thy brother or why dost thou said it not thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me every tongue shall confess to god so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way now let's jump down to verse 22 hast thou faith have it to thyself before god happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth he and he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin i want to bring it to this subject at hand we've got the scriptures we've got the quotes we can read the scriptures we'll come to church wednesday night some people may wear a mask some people not it's not my job to judge them they've heard the word they stand before god they may have a medical exemption and if i judge them in my heart then all of a sudden i'm wrong because they're not doing anything wrong they they could have a medical reason or another reason that i don't know about they may be exempt by some order of the law that you don't know about and you haven't read yet judge nobody that's a brother you let them be judged by their master but don't let their choice influence your decision don't let whether it goes on or comes off don't let that influence your decision let your decision be influenced by the word and the leadership of god according to the word let's not use peer pressure to try to build a political party amen let's just leave everybody completely alone to seek the lord for themself to read the scripture to read the message and decide god judge my heart amen am i matching your word or not and then let everybody take that decision on their own [Music] and then i would say this statement happy is he that condemneth not himself and that thing which he alloweth don't allow it and be condemned yourself make sure that what you're doing see like i said for somebody who doesn't have a medical exemption or some other exemption to the law and they refuse to wear a mask where it's ordered to wear a mask they have violated the scriptures and that may be okay depending on why they violated the scriptures but you better know for sure for sure for sure for sure that when god asked you why did you not keep my commandment to obey those that rule over you your answer will hold up in the face of christ and that's only something an individual can do by themselves nobody else can judge that for anybody else so don't don't condemn somebody if you see somebody sitting over in church and all of a sudden you see them take their mask off don't say what are they doing they're rebound they may be dizzy i mean it may be that simple they may be dizzy and require a little oxygen don't start judging one another leave everybody alone we've got enough trouble to judge ourselves for me to accurately judge myself has taken me about 70 hours of tears and pain and suffering to actually be able to judge my own heart how in the world am i going to look from across the room in a few minutes and judge somebody else don't watch each other watch the word don't look to the group this is not herd mentality this is the individual before god we we won't answer as a group will answer as an individual unless you're a father brother branham said in choosing of a bride 1965 the other is pregnant by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and two together will make one body again like adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word so what do you think friday night and all he said i was praying about god what's your will what do you want us to do what's your will and it was so simple his will is his word not my feeling or not some feeling that i get or think or spiritualize but his will is his word in another message there's only one way provided by god for anything his word is always the truth always the truth his believing children believe for it and cry for it until his word is vindicated and his word is always his will if you want to know what the will of god is find it in the bible it's god's word anything contrary to it is perverted you know what i can say that scripture i can read that quote because i was looking for a way around the word and i was looking for god to give me the justification around the word and i was looking for a scriptural type or a bible verse or a quote to get around the word and what i needed to do is just humble myself and be honest with the word and be really honest with the situation at hand and be really honest with what the word says what i needed to do was just humble myself and die and just obey the word because his word is his will and anything contrary to it is perverted i'm so happy today that god stopped me because my desire was to pervert the word not because i wanted to pervert the word but because i hadn't i wanted to have my own way and in order to have my own way i know now that i chadlam me personally would have had to pervert the word to have my own way and that's not what the bride is here for we're here to stand on the word and the word alone she must be a word bride he was by the word we must be by the word he believed every word and act and we must believe every word and act on it it's god's word anything contrary to it is perverted and don't don't get into that hybrid condition what god said that's the truth the way up is down if you'll be abased in due time you'll be exalted i don't want to fly so high in revelation that i can't keep a simple commandment of the word what good is it if the revelation should produce the life of jesus christ and jesus christ always obeyed the word i don't want to be so revelated that i come up with a revelated way to deny the word i want to be so revelated that the abcs never change in my life that the simple fundamental routine building blocks is the word never change and i don't circumvent them for some mysterious explanation i just believe the word and stand with the word i can say all of this because my desire was to do it all my human my human effort was trying to do all that and god stopped me and i thank god for it let's go to matthew 16. matthew chapter 16. 24 then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it i want to lose my life i want to die to myself i want to stand on his word in his word alone you know the zealots in jesus day they didn't have a bad idea you know the zealots what did they want to do kick rome out kick paganism out re-establish the temple the vision seemed right but they had the wrong timing and if the timing was wrong it wasn't the will of god and the zealots although they had a desire unto the temple it was a religious desire but it was not the will of god and they were willing to fight they were willing to kill for their ideas and it wasn't the will of god because it wasn't the time of god peter got to a place where peter so denied the simple word of god when jesus looked at him and said the son of man will be taken and cruelly treated and crucified and raised again the third day peter denied and said that'll never happen to you lord and he was denying the word but why was he denying the word because he loved god or because he loved himself it looked like he was denying the word because he loved jesus but it wasn't a love for jesus that caused him to deny the word it was a love for himself because he believed jesus was coming into his kingdom and he was going to be part of that he had the right idea but in the wrong way and selfishness got in the way until peter was willing to kill to defend his religious ideas i said god do something different in me different than the way i've lived in the past different than my ideas strip me down to nothing i want to be nothing so that you can just lead me by your word so i don't complicate it i don't reason it that i don't explain it away that i just take it and i just obey it this is the journey i've been on the last few days friends and it's not been fun it's been rough it's made me sick i've been physically sick because of this strain but i wasn't wrestling with the lord i was wrestling with chad until chad died when chad died everything got easier as soon as chad died and i submitted to the word it was amazing how easy everything became then you just do it no more reasoning thinking about you just obey and when you just obey it's just so much easier to obey don't let don't let a commandment to wear a mask steal our joy so you have to wear a piece of fabric on your face i don't like it who here likes it does anybody really like it like are you going to keep doing it when the ordinance goes away who wanted to do it nobody who likes it nobody i don't like it you don't like it but maybe that's why god taylor made it to get us to humble ourselves to look at his word and to say not my will but thy will be done i don't want it to take my joy away and i'll tell you this whole mask mandate took my joy away but why i have to put a mask on my face but who's going to take the word out of my heart who's going to change the revelation of the word that's climbing higher and higher who's going to change my position in christ who's going to change the knowledge of the word that god's given us in the understanding of christ who's going to take away the unveiling of god because they made me put a mask on my face i'm not going to get down i'm not going to grumble i'm not going to complain but i'm going to say god be praised because nothing has changed with my position with god nothing has changed with the word that he's given me and i'm still happy and free because all of these things god is using to bring me out of here god is perfecting me through every trial god is honing me down amen through every decision through every hardship through every temptation god is whittling me away to rescue me out of this land and i say praise be to god keep going god the judgment of the world is the freedom of the bride ones and judgment ones in perfection when it comes to the exodus amen when we go to the exodus journey moses shows up and he tells them god's going to lead you out they hurt him god's going to lead you out he's going to take you to a land that flows with milk and honey they begin to rejoice amen they they in the scriptures you read it they began to rejoice they were so happy and then they went to pharaoh and they asked him can we go and worship and pharaoh says you guys got too much time on your hands we're gonna we're gonna cause you to keep your quota of bricks every day but we're gonna take all the straw away because you've got too much time on your hands you're gonna work harder god just said he's delivering us and now our life got worse they cried on the pharaoh pharaoh it's not fair it's not us it's your people they won't give us and he says you be idle you have too much time you want to go and worship you'll not diminish ought of your bricks and you'll not get any straw you'll have to go find it yourselves and they left and they cried to moses and moses why is this happening you said you're going to deliver us immediately after god promised the deliverance it got worse then moses cried to the lord god why did you even say this and why did you bring this upon the people you know what god's answer was i will surely bring them out with a strong hand everything was working in his plan he told him i'll bring him out he moved pharaoh's heart to punish the people the people cried out in desperation but it was all part of the plan it had to go this way you think those plagues especially the first half of the plagues were pleasant for the children of israel they were afflicted by the same plagues israel was afflicted by do you think that was pleasant you think that was easy you think they're they're asking why why is everything getting worse why is it getting harder why is everything diminishing why does it look weaker and why why why are the sudden we're under restrictions and more restriction then they lift and then they come back amen and it gets worse and it may get worse yet why does the bride look so weak why do they look so weak why are the churches so weak and so feeble and hallelujah what if god will allow a mask mandate to get each of us to be honest with ourselves and honest with the word so that he can perfect us and purge out some of our own self what if by that mandate he's bringing us up higher what if by the purging and the honesty and the obedience to the scripture god is drawing us up higher i used i was reasoning a couple days ago how can you be free in your spirit to worship god with a mask over your face is that really what god wants us to be limited in that way but as i was meditating i thought what if the sweetest verbal praise god wants is praise through the muffle of a face mask but that comes out of an obedient heart he want the verbal tone or does he want obedience from a pure heart for me it was obedience that's what god wanted out of me for me it was obedience and i want to give him what he deserves i'll give caesar what caesar asks but not for caesar i'll give caesar what caesar asks for christ obey every ordinance of man for the lord's sake what you do not as men pleasers not to please men but what you do do it is unto the lord and i want to do unto the lord if you don't see it the way i see it that's fine i won't be angry with you i won't be upset i won't try to persuade you to see it the way i see it if if you come wednesday and don't wear a mask i'll say god bless you because obviously you have a pure heart you know what you're doing you have a medical exemption god spoke to you directly in some way you see another scripture or something god bless you i'm not going to judge you because i've already judged myself and that was the whole point the question i have is can we all judge ourselves can we really be honest and judge ourselves and can we be happy can we sing can we praise the lord because he's worthy to be praised can we be in the happy in the midst of our trial amen can we be happy in the midst of our submission amen maybe what god wants is just to whittle us down and break self-will and bring us into total submission so the bride will quit fighting for herself so that he can finally show up and fight for us maybe he wants us so submissive and so broken and so humble and so pushed around by the world that he's got full justification for coming on the scene and doing the miraculous because we're not defending ourselves anymore and we're not trying to play law games and lawyer games and and but then we just humble ourselves instead of telling the health department guy when he shows up say try to try to get me in a court of law what about the court of god's law what about god allowing us to be so broken so humble so pushed around what if he's drawing the enemy into his trap weakening his bride so humble so submissive that that anybody thinks that they can push her around because she'll keep the word at all costs she won't take her own will she won't fight back she won't speak evil she won't take a stand where the word doesn't take a stand so simple so humble that god is drawing the enemy into his trap and as the enemy gets in and gets in he goes so far and god says that's exactly the line i was waiting for you to cross i'm tired of fighting there's no more fighting me god fights and if god wants to fight through me he will but i'm tired of fighting in my flesh i'm tired of resisting in the flesh i just want to submit completely to the lord i pray that you understand what i'm saying i pray that you understand that i'm talking about what i went through and what i see in the word and what i believe to be the truth and how it's affected me there's no mandate here in the church we're not here to enforce anything we're not asking anybody to do anything against their conscience before god we're not asking by to take one position or the other and the church is not responsible in forcing anything and we will not enforce anything this is between the individual and god we won't judge one another but we'll love one another and let each one stand before their own master and let god have preeminence let him have preeminence let's all stand musicians if you could come i want to sing a happy song who wants to sing a happy song who wants to say regardless of how much i'm stripped down in the flesh i love god regardless of what i have to go through to keep the word i love god regardless of if it feels good if i'm embarrassed and regardless if i'm uncomfortable i don't want it to diminish my joy one on i want to love god and i want to sing a happy song you know this joy that i have the world can't take it away
