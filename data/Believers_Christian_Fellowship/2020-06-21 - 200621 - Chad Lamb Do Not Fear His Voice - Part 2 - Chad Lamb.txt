atmosphere together man i'm going to let you have your seats for just a minute i'm going to talk to you for a minute before we go to the scriptures thank you musicians appreciate it i just want to say happy father's day god bless you and to all the fathers out there man we appreciate all the fathers in the leadership and all that they do and amen if you've had a father especially you had a good father then it's a lot to be thankful for this world is full of bad parents and the world is suffering from that but thank god for good fathers on father's day god bless you brother gene it's good to see you brother gene's been out of service for a long time but god bless you together and then the gene was really sick with double pneumonia by the effects of cloven 19 and he got pretty low but god miraculously stepped on the scene and healed our brother and we thank god for that so this is a very special day for all of us brother gene god bless you dear lord jesus we thank you god for your goodness to us we thank you for your mercy that you've given to us how you've brought us through every change and every obstacle through all kinds of requirements of man and government mandates and sickness and everything else lord but you've brought us through you have prospered us in the midst of the world's chaos you have prospered us you've grown us in your word you have moved us forward in your program and lord for that we're forever grateful as we come to you today on a father's day lord we cannot be so thankful that you're our father that we know our origin is in you lord we come from you we go to you and that makes father's day even more special to the children of god because we know who our father is we know where we came from lord and we know why we're here and we just want to please you in all things i pray in the preaching of the word now that you would just be pleased and all that said that you would come down yourself by the power of your spirit and speak through these lips lord give your children the daily bread that they seek lord god be glorified and honored as we receive your word take take control in charge of every part of the service have preeminence among us and guide us by your spirit in jesus christ's name we pray amen let's take our bibles and turn to second corinthians if we will i want to continue the thought from wednesday i really never did get into some of my notes in the powerpoint i just i felt to continue on so this would be part two and uh i never did give a title last time but i intended to call it do not fear his voice do not fear his voice and then this will be part two lord willing this morning and i want to say god bless you fathers but i don't have a father's day message i just have to go as the lord leads amen and uh praise god us fathers we're tough we can take it right it's okay but i've never been really super good at preaching on schedule with the holidays and having a christmas message and a thanksgiving sometimes it works out that day it's the way sometimes you get inspiration and it's good and thank god but sometimes all you can do is stay in the vein that that he sent us in amen and that's what we want we want on this father's day we want our father to be in control man let's go with the second corinthians uh chapter three second corinthians chapter 3 verse 12. seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remain at the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding us in a glass the glory of the lord are changed unto the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord amen you may be seated ask the lord to bless the reading of his word is a to me this is just a tremendous passage of scripture and man we we want to we want to look at the fact that moses when he come down off of the mountain he come down and because he had received the word and been in the presence of the shekinah glory of god and now that the word was in moses moses face shone so that the congregation could not look steadfastly on him and he put a veil over his face and so moses brother bam tells us that a prophet becomes the word to the age so they literally it's not it's not just that the prophet brings the word because if we just look at the prophet bringing the word we're going to miss so many things that happens in the life of a prophet because that very prophet himself becomes the word to the age his whole life what happens to him the circumstances surrounding his life amen the events that take place in the sequence of events it becomes the word to that age so that's why when we look at brother branham's life when we start to see the way god leads his life and directs him and the significant events that happen in his life we begin to realize it's all ordained of god and it's all speaking the same thing it's speaking the word to us through the actual events that take place in his life for instance the brother behind stands up to preach birth pains and he's preached preaching birth pains he's preaching the sixth seal the world in travail purging of the world to bring forth the millennium and here he preaches birth pains which is the judgment the time of judgment amend the sixth seal and and his bible sticks together the pages in his bible sticks together so that he can't find the scripture he's looking for so that a catholic priest will step forward with the scroll in his hand because we're now replaying a scene that played out when jesus christ was here on earth then he gives him a bible and brother rem said it was a new bible that my that my wife bought me for christmas i mean as normal as normal can be she bought him a bible in the new bible sometimes the pages will stick together amen and they were stuck together it was just a normal event in the life of the prophet amen but there's no normal event in the life of a prophet because his life becomes the word to the people so the very actions he takes the very things that happened to him so now moses is becoming the word to the people because moses has the word amen and because they refused to go up into that mountain when god called for them and he spoke to them now they cannot endure the word and the word has to be veiled from them because god wanted to give his word directly to them because he wanted to be married to them amen and they refused to have that kind of relationship with god and now they ask moses to go up moses goes up and the illumination of the word is so great that moses face shines because out from his face out from his mouth is going to come the word and he puts a veil on it showing that the word now has to be veiled to the people who refuse to go to the light and showing that the same thing is true now that the word is veiled but it's veiled behind badger skins it's veiled behind people it was veiled in brother branham and he may not have had to put a veil over his face because we by this time we've already caught the concept that thou the word the light now is going to shine through human beings and now it's in the veil of human flesh and now the the now the word is veiled in the prophet praise be to god and when we refuse when we refuse to go up the mountain to the light ourselves then there's a veil that's put over our heart because now it's not the physical of a shining of a face and a physical veil but it's spiritual and now that the word is veiled in human flesh it's coming through a messenger amen but now our heart is veiled because we cannot endure the light unless we allow the spirit of god to rip the veil and we with an open face or unveiled face are beholding him face to face and being changed from glory and to glory and to the image of what we're seeing but if we refuse amen to go further in the light then we have a veil over our hearts so because they refused the veil was put over their heart paul the apostle paul says even to this day the veil when the under the reading of moses the veil is on their heart so even even though they were reading the right words the veil was on the heart because they refused this is so important because if we place this back there we miss the whole point because all the word is written for today the whole bible all the word is written for today all this was done for our example so that we will know amen so everything is written for this day this is the end time the last day and all the bible is here to unfold itself in this day and we have to make sure that we don't repeat the same mistake that was repeated back there so let's go to exodus this in a way of review let's look at this in exodus 19. and i just pray to god that i can just express clearly what's on my heart i've never once felt like i've expressed clearly what's on my heart but i keep praying for it but i know that god can express it in your heart correctly because there's a there's a mechanism of human flesh that is so flawed it can never be perfect it can just never be perfect so between the perfect word coming in a perfect revelation and the perfect revelation striking your heart god will allow it to get all jumbled up in human flesh so that only the supernatural can take place in your heart and if it wasn't for that it wouldn't be supernatural it would be by good teaching amen and good teaching would be able to part revelation and then you would be able to be born again just by sitting under the right teacher now there's a truth to that because the right word will bring a birth but it's got to be jumbled up in humanity where it can never be perfect it can all it always has to come amen so through something that's flawed so that there still has to be a supernatural work that only god can do to bring the perfect revelation in your heart and so i'll just give up on trying to do it perfect amen i'm just going to do as the lord leads praise be to god exodus 19 and 10. exodus 19 and 10 and the lord said unto moses go into the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and let them wash their clothes and be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying take heed to yourselves that you go not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death there shall not be a hand toucheth but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not live when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mountain so so we've got a situation here where where he says prepare yourselves into the third day but in the third day i'm going to come down on cyanide and and put a a border around the mountain and guards there that nothing will touch the mountain unless it it be killed amen but then he says but when the trumpet sound is long come up into the mountain so so you can see you can see how easy it is to misunderstand god because god is saying don't come to this mountain you'll die if you come to this mountain before the trumpet sound line [Applause] but because there was such a fearful because there was such a fearful warning and consequences for coming up this mountain within the three days amen because of that amen there's a natural fear of the mountain that sets in because don't go don't go don't go and it's it's like it's like don't try to touch those seals don't touch those seals don't touch those seals amen because you'll bring death if you try to touch those seals you can't interpret those seals and you can see how there's a natural fear of the mountain amen because we're told don't touch it don't touch it don't interpret it but don't touch it until the trumpets sound long but when the trumpets sound long then you get up here to me that's the time to come and so because man probed at it and probed at it and probed at it and couldn't touch it why because it was a stone cut out of the mountain without hands amen man was not going to be able amen to interpret this stone it was it was cut out without hands god didn't do it through man he's going to bring the interpretation himself and so he says don't do it don't do it don't do it now do it and you can see there's a fear and an angst because they have to tell their children they have to keep their animals back if you even touch it you'll be stoned there are thrust through with the dark don't you dare go try to interpret those seals don't you dare move into the book of revelation amen don't you do that amen and so there's a natural through the church ages is a natural fear of the mountain amen but the jubilee trumpet has sounded amen the lord has come himself to the top of the mountain and the trumpet has sounded long and sounded out the seven thunders and now it's time to go up into the thick darkness and so we could easily repeat the same mistakes as the past in deuteronomy 5 we're going to do this like we did wednesday keep your place here in exodus and go to deuteronomy chapter 5 with me to read this passage of scripture as well deuteronomy 5 and 2. the lord the lord our god made a covenant with with us in horeb so you find out that what god was going to do is he was giving them a covenant and it was a marriage covenant he moses had already been up to the mountain god had already set the terms and said if you listen to me and obey me you'll be my people and i'll be a god to you and and he comes down and when he comes down the mountain he tells the people and the people except that uh they they accept the proposal he proposes to him through moses because it's always the friend of the bridegroom it's always a servant that comes amen and he comes and he tells israel this is what god said on the mount and they said we'll do it all we'll do everything we accept the terms of this engagement we now are a spouse to god and then he tells him these next instructions that that stay off the mountain preparing to the third day wash your clothes be sanctified be holy be ready and when the trumpet sound long come up to me and that's where they refused god so they never went into the marriage union they stayed the espoused wife who was put away for the rest of the old testament for the rest of they're still a spouse to god they can't marry to another it's still adultery it's still wrong amen they commit fornication they commit adultery he allows them to get taken by the assyrians he allows them to get taken by the babylonians because of their adultery because they're espoused and once you're a spouse you're married for life they were still espoused to god but god found them in fornication and refusing him before the the that before they accepted the marriage covenant and coming to the union so he put them away but it kept them espoused to him so when they would serve other gods they considered adulterers you got it so in horeb he said he made a covenant with us and that covenant was when the trumpet sound long when when the serpent sounded long there was voices under that great trumpet and the voices under the trumpet were the ten commandments and when he spoke the ten commandments that's all the law that he was going to give to them everything else he they needed he would speak directly but this is all he wanted to give to them this is what if you'll do this we'll stay united in holy matrimony amen and he told them but when they be when he began to speak with his own voice and thundered out those thunders that were under the great blast of the trumpet amen they refused to come up but they ran away and hid and so they rejected the covenant he came and he fulfilled his end of the covenant but they rejected the fulfilled there into the covenant they would not go up and go up into him and they refused him so he put her away praise god so let's look at verse two again in the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb the lord made not this covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this day the lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of fire i stood between the lord and you at that time to show you the word of the lord for you were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the mountain see that was the mistake they went not up into the mountain let's go back to exodus 20. i just really want to lay this in i know we went over it wednesday but i want to lay it in tight here again exodus 20 verse 18. and all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of trump and and the mountain smoking and when the people saw what they removed and stood afar off and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die and moses said unto the people fear not for god has come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that you sin not and the people stood afar off and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was so so when the fire came down it was a thick darkness and the people were afraid and moses is saying don't be afraid he's just trying to prove you amen don't be afraid but they refused they actually they ran away and stood afar off they were supposed to come up but they ran away and stood afar off and they said let not god speak to us lest we die amen and the very thing that was going to bring life they saw was death the very thing that that that would have taken them into the confirm the covenant and brought them in union they saw his death and they feared and they ran away but moses amen because moses is the type of christ moses went up to god in the thick darkness thick darkness what's thick darkness it's the mystery the thick darkness light is illumination light is the word darkness is absent of light or absence of the word or the hidden word let's say because when brother branham when he talks about the vision of junior jackson when he peels the top off of that rock and he says light has never shown on this before it's been in darkness it's been in the thick darkness amen because the light has never hit this part before and so god comes down and moses said god came down in a fire but when god came down in a fire around the fire was thick darkness so there was a mystery on the mountain there was a hidden mystery on the mountain and it was thick darkness and when moses went in he disappeared behind the thick darkness but when moses went in he could see because it was the shekinah glory of light it was the fire of god it was the light of god so it wasn't that that light that thick darkness didn't blind moses it blinded everybody else to what moses was seeing so on one side it's darkness on one side it's light amen it's the same thing as when the children of israel come out of egypt and the pharaoh was coming after them and they were hemmed in pinned against the red sea and the pillar of fire moved behind them and it was darkness to pharaoh but it shined light unto the children of israel and it's the same thing with moses he goes into the thick darkness and in the thick darkness he can see but everybody else can't see what moses can see because the only way to see what moses sees is to go where moses went that's that's better than we realize because the only way to see what brother branham saw was to go where brother branham went we've got to make the same journey he made now let's go look at uh malachi chapter 4 together malachi we're very familiar with malachi chapter 4. i want to start at verse 4. malachi chapter 4 verse 4. we know that this scripture pastor is going to lay down a prophecy for us in our day turning the hearts of the children back to the original pentecostal fathers and it's going to be through the ministry of elijah but verse 4 says remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded him in horeb for all israel with the statutes and judgments so before he moves into this prophecy he wants you to remember horeb because what happened in horeb they made their fatal mistake in horeb they chose law over grace and so now we understand that statement better by what happened at horeb when they chose law over grace they chose to have somebody in between them and god they chose to have somebody go talk to god for them face the fierce judgment of god for them come down and give it to them and give it to them in a rule book amen and then they would they agreed that they would keep the rule book but they never were able to keep the rule book and they thought that keeping the book on earth in a human way was better than ascending the mountain and going into the thunders and the lightnings and the earthquake and the smoke and the fire because if we go there we'll die and that's the truth if you go there you'll die and that's the best thing that'll ever happen to you is if you go up there and let the lightning and the thunder and the fire and the and the earthquake kill you and resurrect you there in that shekinah glory light amen so they they now they would take they would refuse grace and take law they would refuse god and take moses a human a human office to mediate between the two and now when he's coming to the prophecies the end time at the end of the church ages behold i send you the light of the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord before that prophecy he wants you to go back and remember horeb remember moses remember horror remember the laws with the statues and judgments and don't repeat this process again amen you're coming to another mountain i'm coming to the top of mount zion amen the headstone the capstone will be coming down because revelation 10 7 is the same as malachi 4 5. so now we're coming the the the light is descending the cloud is coming down the capstone is falling it doesn't matter what term you want to use or how you describe it it's the same thing he's coming down upon mount zion to confirm the covenant of what marriage amen for what the invisible union and so now remember horeb and don't do what they did there don't run away from the thick darkness but go into the thick darkness and see because it's amazing to me i i titled this do not fear his voice because his voice was calling amen in the long trumpet the long trumpet was the voice of god god was speaking to them face to face but what was he speaking he was speaking the ten commandments showing that in our day it's going to be the long thunder the the long trumpet blast the jubilee trumpet that's going to sound and under that are thunders which are voices of god amen and what is it it's god himself speaking to us just like he was god there giving ten commandments it's god here giving the revelation of the seven thunders and and when he when he does that that's the jubilee call that's the signal that's the time the very place that we were forbidden to go and the thing we were forbidden to touch amen now it's time that we've been stayed sanctified by the word amen cleansed and washed our clothes and sanctified and set apart for three days waiting waiting waiting through luther through wesley through pentecost but after three days now the trumpet sounds and it's time to go to the top of the mountain and unite with him but because it was thunders and lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and smoke and fire they ran the other way amen and many have done the same thing today amen we'd rather stay around the base of the mountain let brother branham go up and connect with god and him come down and tell us what to say and now we're so worried and so fearful to hear from god ourselves that the only thing we'll do is push play on a tape and won't let a preacher preach the word because we're afraid to get off and touch the mountain and be slain by the mountain you see we repeated the same thing he said yeah yep all them tape people it happens the same thing in a church when we ourselves refuse and let the preacher do it all for us it's the same exact problem that we have amen but what if i get it wrong or what if it kills me it's supposed to kill you amen you're supposed to for brother brennan when he went into that cloud he said i went plumb out of my knowing we need to get caught up in the cloud and get plumbed out of our knowing and get a totally different knowing see that trumpet sounded long the seven thunderstounded and what he was he saying he was saying come up here to me come unite with me i want to speak to you face to face i want to give you revelation myself but we get so fearful because i mean to go to that mountain is death and look it's rumbling and thundering and lightnings if i go in the wrong condition i'll die oh praise god don't be afraid of god god's done this to prove you to see whether you love him or not see this is why it's still so easy for human beings to take the precious message that god gives us and turn it from what he gave us into statutes and judgments and laws going back to horeb and he told us before the prophecy of elijah now remember horeb remember moses remember horeb don't do with this what they did there because it's very much a repeat of the same circumstances and so now god wanted to be in a covenant with the people where he would speak himself amen and the people would be able to hear from him amen but that was too fearful for them so they wanted to stick with a system and from that time forward amen the children of god had been trapped and tricked into the system because in that day the system looked safer than the journey to the top of the mountain amen right it looked safer it looked like i i you know i don't have to risk it i don't have to risk being wrong i don't have to risk being an heir i don't have to risk everybody mocking me or making fun of me or i don't have any risk i'll let moses take all the risk that's why moses was the only one with a shiny face and moses was the one who went in behind the veil and because he was the only one who went in behind the veil now he's got to stand behind the veil to them because they can't break behind the veil so moses has to be veiled to them and their heart has to be veiled to the word because they refuse to go behind the veil so moses is the only one that went into the presence of god and become like god until the word was so in him that he was shining forth amen from his face from his mouth was so shiny that they couldn't behold the look upon him they couldn't stand to look up on him and so we we we are human beings prone to the exact same temptations they had back there willing to let another human being take the risk of climbing that mountain and getting direct revelation from god because we're afraid to take the journey ourselves and you say but it's blackness it's pitch dark how can you find your way how can you know what's i mean once you get up into that thick darkness you can't see nothing there's there's nothing written on the white stone there's nothing written about it in the bible how can you go into that darkness and can't see anything and you don't realize the minute you break through the darkness it's all light it's all fire of god it's all shiny and bright amen we've got to be willing to break through the darkness and because brother brennan's been through the darkness oh i just feel it coming i'm going to say some things that are going to get me in big trouble but you here know my heart and know what i'm saying so i'm going to say it anyways will that brother branham break through the darkness and come back so i'll never venture past what is super clear and easy and what he says 10 or 15 times now i've never preached preaching beyond the prophet i'm never preached preaching what he didn't preach and i never will but we get so trapped in the same trap at horeb that if you if you can't show me a quote book on that i know he said it one time there that when he says this way and it looks like a discrepancy i'm just not going to touch it did that spirit come from amen the message has been given to us what is it it's the voice of god calling his bride up higher coming to unite with him it's the revelation of jesus christ it doesn't matter if he said it one time 10 times amen it doesn't matter if he's preaching it and by revelation god can strike it into your heart and you can see it in the word then it's for you it's the revelation of jesus christ but we get so timid with the word amen because we're so fearful of getting wrong or doing wrong or being wrong amen and if you're an elected gene of god how in the world are you going to get so wrong that you've moved outside of redemption how are you going to be lost amen even if the rod of correction will come down and hit you hard amen he will not lose you you can no more be lost and god can be lost and god is not complete without you and so there's now no fear this this message has come to take the scare away the fear of the mountain we're not afraid of that mountain that's our mountain amen at the top of the mountain is my lord amen i'm not afraid of that mountain it's a scary thing to the flesh but i'm not paying attention to the flesh i'm not worried about the naysayers i'm not worried about the denominational mind amen at the top of that mountain is everything i've waited for all of my life it's him amen it's the union with him it's the revelation of who i actually am it is my lord and me and him together in a union amen i can't stay away from the top of that mountain and where is it it's behind the thick darkness friends it's not the obvious it's not the easily seen amen you won't see it till you're willing to go there and take ridicule and take scorn and take a chance [Applause] hey amen scared to death to take a chance what if it's not for me what if i get lost what if i'd that's not the spirit he's looking for in this day he's calling for a bride to match his own character he's looking for somebody who'll say god i have to know more i got to know more i got to know what is this is real and i don't want to know secondhand if it's real i don't want to see the shining life off the face of my brother and sister and say yep they've been in the shekinah glory i see the shekinah glory around their life emanating off of them it must be real if you see that it's still a veil in your heart but i want to go see him face to face with an unveiled face and how do i get the veil taken away in christ and where is christ christ is the word that's been delivered this day through a prophet all of it not the easy parts not the widely accepted parts only not the parts that are easy to match with an intellectual understanding of the bible it's not that only amen because you can get your message theological degree and do a pretty good job in debate and study because there's so much of the bibles open so much of the scripture but there are some things brother ben says about the scripture that make zero sense to the intellectual mind none well this is but in your mind there is no way to make that fit so we leave that out of our message textbook amen do you see what i'm trying to say friends ah let's not when we're moving in to elijah the coming of elijah to turn the harshest jump back to the fathers let's not forget horeb let's not forget what happened in horeb wants a people who aren't afraid of him [Music] and aren't afraid of his word and aren't afraid to climb the mountain of the word and i don't know my next step it's covered in thick darkness but i believe when i get there i'll see the lights where where is this going to end brother where is that revelation going to end where does that go next i don't know but i believe when i step into the thick darkness of that amen that part of the word that part of the message i believe when i step into the thick darkness the light will be there to shine amen praise be to god so the apostle paul he brings us in in hebrews uh chapter 12. we've read this several times but in hebrews chapter 12 he says you've not come to the mountain that can be touched it burns with fire he said you've not come to mount sinai but you've come to a mountain so don't miss this what was natural to them is spiritual to us you've not come to that sinai but you have come to mount zion and on this mount zion is an innumerable company of angels it's it's the sprinkling of blood that speaketh better things it's a mediator of christ all of this is on the mountain of this word of mount zion so the apostle paul brought us to the mountain but brother branham was there at the capping of the mountain the cornerstone and the headstone the alpha the omega the first church age messenger of prophet the last three stage messenger of prophet amen the cornerstone christ the foundation that was laid through paul the wise master builder and now there's going to be another wise master builder that's going to come just like paul amen did at the beginning he's going to come at the end paul made sure the cornerstone was christ amen and the wise master builder at the end is going to make sure the headstone is christ the cornerstone and the headstone have to match and if the cornerstone was right and everything was built true and plumb working all the way up then the headstone will be the exact fit as the if the angles are right you see your cornerstone sets your right angle for the pyramid and it's tapered to set the degree of incline for the pyramid if every h can build off the cornerstone then as we go around we'll be square and the angle will be right square angle right square angle right and when we come to the capstone which is the perfect revelation of jesus christ if everybody is built off the cornerstone that paul laid correctly when the the next wise master builder comes with the capstone the capstone will fit perfect and everything's right proving that it's a perfect word it's jesus christ through seven church ages now capped off by his presence himself and if it didn't fit somebody's got something wrong somewhere praise be to god i love this word i absolutely love it and why do i love this word so much because the bondage and the bonds have changed in my denominational understanding been taken away and i can speak about this word because this word has become one with me and i can talk about it like i talk about a friend like i talk about anything else i know when i see praise god amen you can look at the plans to my house and you can know the dimensions the rooms where the bathrooms are going to be where the bedrooms are with the dimensions of them or how high it is what the grade finish grade is you can know all about my house but until you've lived in my house you don't know where the sun shines best in the summer and in the winter where the best place to put the plants and you don't know what color the wall is and you don't know how it feels so you may know all about my house but until you've lived in it you don't know my house and we can read the blueprint to the word and we can know all about the word but until you've gone inside the word and come into christ you don't know the word man that's why the pharisees missed him they knew all about him but they didn't know him and when he was there they'd never been in him and they didn't know praise be to god so this word is more than doctrine it's more than teaching it's more it's more than it's more than a draft it's more than an engineering drawing it's more than an outline it is the person jesus christ himself and when you come into him now you know what it feels like over here and where the sun comes in best in the winter praise be to god oh god it's so good all right let's look at a powerpoint bathroom says now notice now when this taken place junior he was talking about junior jackson's dream here in the seventh seal standing in the field had a big pyramid like that and there was something wrote on the rocks and i was revealing that to the people is that right junior about a year before it happened and notice the next thing now i took some kind of a bar and cut it off and on the inside was the white rock that had nothing road on it and at that time i started to the west and i told them all i said don't go out west stay here and look on this till i return went west for the blast returned back to the east with the holy spirit interpreting this unwritten word now if that isn't perfectly the god almighty i want you to know what is what am i trying to say this for friends is to show you we're at the end time so brother branham knew there's so many prophecies that have to be fulfilled at the end time and one of the main markers of the end time is the opening of the seventh seal and the opening of the seventh seal in revelation chapter eight one there was silence amen he said nothing was said but then you come over to the seven thunders and they thunders uttered their voices and john was told to write it not but seal it up he said see they're connected together he knows the seventh seal is the end time seal it has to do with the coming of the lord amen uh and and he knows it has to do with these seven thunders and down brother branham knows i mean as he's preaching serves is this the time that those seven thunders amen are the the mystery laying within the pyramid inside the word the unwritten part no light has shined on this before because when john heard it he was told not to write when daniel asked about it he was told to seal it up till the time of the end so brother branham knows when this vision is coming to take place he knows this is the end time and this is the end time then it's time for the end time seal which is the seventh seal and he's able to put it all together knowing when the when it's time for the revelation of the seven thunders or the mysteries the unwritten part are the unwritten seals that were still sealed however he words it when he comes to that he knows it's in time time for the opening of the seventh seal and we should know the same thing and so i'm going through this because i want if the lord will allow me if i could take some time i just want to review several things that we've learned over the last couple of years some things that god has brought to our attention and and kind of tie them together and paint a picture and so there'll be a lot of reviews he'd be like brother dad you've preached that before i know then we get to the next brothers have you preached it i know i know i know it's okay but i could preach this every day and still like it in fact i could talk about junior jackson's dream every day and still get excited you'll be like i haven't memorized i know but it's still amazing because when brother branham when he comes to the inner circles this the time he talks about those six dreams capped off by the vision of him getting caught up to the constellation of angels and he talks about junior jackson he goes back to that dream again and he says i took this sharp object like a crowbar and i ripped the top off of it and i said look on this he says that's been fulfilled today tonight so when he's preaching services this the time he's just fulfilled junior jackson's dream to tell them there's something within the word that light's never shown on we need to get a revelation i've got to go west to get the revelation and i'll bring it back amen that's fulfilled now no future fulfillment it was fulfilled right then so brother bam talks about this pyramid takes the cap off and there's a there's a white rock and and brother franco helped me do this several months back and we did in the shape of a pyramid at first i thought take the top off and there's something laying there flat like flat rock but brother branham said the pyramid within the pyramid it's within the word it's the same shape of the word it's the unwritten mystery that's been within the word the whole time everybody's been looking at the word the funny writing on the outside of the pyramid the pyramid is your bible the word of god but inside in the same shape and form of this word is an unspoken unwritten mystery that's been there the whole time it's been the white pyramid within the pyramid praise be to god and then brother branham when he sees this picture he calls it the pyramid cloud tying the two together what is this it's the same thing it's the white pyramid what is the white period pyramid christ is the mystery of god revealed what has been the unwritten what has been the unwritten part inside the book what has been the mystery within the bible it's been christ it's been god coming into flesh it's been the manifestation of god christ is the mystery of god revealed so when you when this when he sees this pyramid he sees this pyramid cloud when he first sees it he calls it a pyramid cloud he gets caught up into the pyramid of the constellation of the seven angels amen but he doesn't realize till later that that's actually the head of christ amen when he turns it to the right he sees the face of jesus christ recognizing now it's the capstone it's the headstone it's christ the headship to the body it is the mind of christ coming down to give the revelation of the white pyramid the rock within the rock in the seventh seal he says and you remember it was in the pyramid where the mysterious white rock was not written on and the angels took me into that pyramid of themselves oh i want you to catch this if if if you catch no catch everything i say but anyways catch this i love this word so much friends brother branham in order to catch the revelation has to go into the pyramid of themselves this is important i want to say it this way i don't believe it's i don't believe that it's okay for us to just be satisfied that brother branham got caught up in the consolation he said those angels took me into that pyramid of themselves the mysteries of god known only to them and now they with the messenger that come to interpret that pyramid or that message of the secret of the seven seals which lays with inside the pyramid so brother branham he goes inside that pyramid and at that time he knows that seven angels the seven angels that have the mystery of the seven thunders but he doesn't yet recognize that those seven angels were just outlining the head of christ that it's actually the head of christ coming down that it's actually they're representing christ coming or the full revelation the head the mind coming to the body to the church so that the church will see the full revelation of what the white stone is what the mystery of christ is through the whole bible and so now brother branham because i'll just say it this way and you know me so just love me anyways when brother branham gets caught up into the midst of those that pyramid into the mysteries known only to themselves he gets caught up and he comes out now brother branham is very much taking the same journey that moses took because moses gets caught up into the cloud and he comes back and now moses is the mystery if i could say it just stick with me now moses is the mystery because brother brennan says it was christ in moses moses now had the word he had the word of the covenant he had the word of god he understood about the temple and the dimensions of the temple and what god was going to do he was laying down the pattern that that the apostle paul was going to pick up and introduced to the gentiles but he's now he's caught the full revelation moses has and he's coming down he's caught in natural form i should say of a natural temple and tabernacle and all the vessels then he's coming down but now the mystery is in moses and moses i would say that now moses becomes the mystery that's why moses is wearing the veil because god is always behind the veil and now he's showing where the mystery lies and the mystery now lies in moses because moses got caught up and has the revelation so brother branham gets caught up amen and brother branham's moving down and now brother brenham has the revelation and i i know that each one comes to him each night and gives him the revelation of the seals but but brother branham is actually he's just like moses now he's coming down he what he has is not his own word what he has is not his own revelation something he's come up with he's been reading what man wrote he's been trying to piece it together he's been reading what he what he preached years ago about it but now he comes down and these angels come to him one by one every night giving the revelation and he just comes and gives it out amen he's very much playing the part of moses and what's he doing he's actually introducing the bridegroom to the bride brother branham is actually because the bridegroom is the word christ is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god right so we know this it's the word so brother brethren's coming down with the mysterious part of the book he's coming down with the mystery that's been locked in the scriptures all this time and christ is the mystery of god revealed and don't forget christ is male and female christ is is god coming into manifestation now now he comes down and he starts through the preaching of the seals and he's presenting the bridegroom to the bride and he's not presenting the bridegroom to the bride just like he's showing a picture this is the bridegroom someday the bridegroom will come you want to know what he looks like and and i'm introducing you to him and i'm telling you all about him because someday he'll be here and i want you to be able to recognize him when he comes but he's here to help you in an invisible union and so he's not showing you a picture somewhere talking about somebody to come in a physical way but he's actually he's the mystery of the seventh seal because the seventh seal is the son of man amen the son of man is is is coming back in a prophetic form it's the return of the son of man it's the coming of the son of man it's the revealing of the son of man and the son of man is christ and christ is now here where is he at he's behind the veil of the tabernacle of the seventh angel and now the seventh angel becomes the mystery of the seventh seal brother rem's on the platform working miracles and doing signs and wonders and he says now he says if he was here he would do what i'm doing and he says it's not me doing it you know it's not me you know it's him and he does everything to prove that it's jesus christ present tense not the vessel of clay but the son of man and he tells you it's a son of man revealing the son of man so brother branham gets caught up he gets caught up into the mind of christ he gets caught up into the white rock now he he becomes the mystery that's in the white rock he becomes the mystery of the seventh seal you know chad what are you talking about when you look at brother branham in his ministry do you see a man from kentucky or do you see jesus christ and if you see jesus christ then you see the seventh seal because it was christ coming back to his church to prove himself to his church to give a covenant to the church so that the church can be joined in invisible union remember horeb don't forget horeb so when you look at that man and all he's done none of us look at that man and say what a man but we look at that and say what a savior what a bridegroom that's my lord so now within him he becomes the veil but he becomes the mystery of the seventh seal he's the messenger brother now get this he's the messenger of the seventh seal his ministry is the seventh seal because his ministry is the coming of the son of man it's the coming of the lord but how did he come first he come in a prophet form first just like moses but what did god want after he displayed himself in moses he showed the plagues he showed that it was him he gave his commandments he brought him to the mountain then he didn't just want moses to be the mystery of the seventh seal now he wanted the whole camp to be the mystery of the seventh seal remember horeb we're going to go in we're going to talk about elijah amen the coming of elijah amen to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers but don't forget horeb god did not just want moses on the top of that mountain he wasn't just wanting to speak to moses only but he wanted to come into a marriage covenant with the whole nation of israel and he has not come down in this day to show the mystery of the seventh seal and one man to let it stay there only amen but he wants the mystery of the seventh seal to move to the second fold of the threefold mystery and the second fold is him getting preeminence and a bride and the bride now becomes the mystery of the seventh seal she becomes the mystery of the white rock amen she's got you but to do that you've got to get caught up into the mind of christ you got to go into christ and the veil is taken away when you go in the christ the veil is taken away amen and when the veil is taken away nothing about what i'm saying becomes difficult but everything about what i'm saying becomes that's nothing but the truth i may not explain it that way i mean i have the words amen but my heart i know that what you're saying is the truth and that's the journey that i got to take but you know it's thick darkness i mean it's a white stone and a pyramid with letters and and and and a pyramid cloud and face of christ i'm so confused it's all the same thing just different terms for the same thing it's our lord up there amen it's the lord jesus christ coming down himself but i didn't see him if you saw the opening of the word you saw him if you saw the revelation thunder you saw him if you saw the word in this day restored you have seen him because there's nothing different between the word and him but i'm waiting for his coming you haven't seen him yet amen who revealed this word who tied genesis to revelations in one package and showed the mystery of the bride and bridegroom through the whole thing that was him if you're still looking for him i'm telling you you're going to miss something because it's not the nail scarred hands we look for it's the word made manifest oh i'm just waiting and i'm watching oh friends if you can't see him in the word you can't seem in this dispensation because we're gentile not jew if we can't see him in the revealing of the mysteries and the revealing of the thunders the revealing of the word if we can't see him if all we see is white horse red horse black horse we still missed him if all we hear is thou shalt not steal thou shalt have no other gods before us for all you caught was the ten commandments but missed the voice speaking the commandments you missed him and if all we caught was the revelation of the seven seals then you caught the voice you missed the voice behind the voice you missed who was speaking because only the lamb can take the book and loose the seals thereof he can only do it in a certain time period he can only do it at a certain time and that's at the end time and at the end of the gentile dispensation at the end of the church ages and then brother brethren tells us every which way he can tell us through khrushchev and eisenhower through events in history through the opening of the seals to every way he can tell us he tells us it's the end time we're at the end of time end of the gentile dispensation into the church ages we've come to the end and if you come to the end now the lamb can take the book and loose the seals thereof and now the mighty angel can descend with an open book in his hand and now listen because let's not leave the scriptures now when he comes down seven thunders utter their voices john's told not to write he lifts his hand to heaven and swears by him that lives forever and ever that time shall be no more and then then then the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god should be finished not when he goes on his healing campaigns but when he begins to break the word with the revealing of the seals then you have the seven thunders or the yeah then you have the seven thunders then you have the voice the mystery of god finished in the voice of the seventh angel perfect we're right with the scriptures then there's a voice that tells john john not the seventh angel john go to the mighty angel amen not the seventh angel go to the mighty angel christ himself and take the book out of his hand and eat it up up i say all right eat it all not the most palatable parts not too easily digested not the parts everybody else has aiden told you about but eat it all and in your mouth it'll be sweet as honey but in the belly be bitter and then he says for thou must prophesy again not the seventh angel but john when we come to revelation 10 i'd like to tie revelations 10 to revelations 4 because brother branham ties them together so if we're going to come to revelation 10 i'll say it this way don't forget horeb remember my servant moses remember remember the statues in the judge remember the great failure the great mistake the fatal mistake that they made in exodus 19 and don't make the same mistake amen but be willing be have your conscience pricked amen be awake and say i've got to go beyond amen i've got to go beyond anything on flesh and anything on earth and any human being and i've got to go to the mighty angel himself and get this book it's more than going to the library and getting a seals book friends it's more than getting a church book in a seals book amen this is a different kind of book amen it's not the book with print on paper but it's the book of the revelation of himself amen and then when you get the book of the revelation of himself you look in that book and you can see your name is written there what are you eating you're eating you're digesting you're feeding on the revelation of you are in christ you have always been in christ you are part of god and always will be part of god your name is on the book it gives you a right to go to the mighty angel yourself and eat the book praise be to god oh i know to the world it sounds crazy take a book go to christ get a book eat a book capstone you know sharp sword unwritten word thunders and voices and it's all the same thing it's the seven seals the coming of the lord coming to what coming to unite with the bride he comes with an open book in his hand he's calling for his bride to come stand by his side how's he calling them he's calling names but he's not calling like ormond neville or chad lam he's revealing the mysteries and revealing the mysteries is calling the names why because if you reveal the mysteries who did you reveal christ if you revealed the mysteries you revealed christ he is those seven seals so when brother ben revealed the seven seals he revealed jesus christ where as one that'll come someday he revealed jesus christ as the son of man who's here now the one who's revealing amen the one who peeled back the seals and gave the revelation he's he's the one who came in a portion of his spirit every night he meant through those seven angels to reveal reveal reveal reveal who did the revealing the holy spirit did the revealing christ praise be to god the the opening of the seals revealing christ the eating of the book is becoming one with christ going to him how do i go to him where is he he's all around you he's all around you he's been all around you all this time and i'm not talking in some mystical new age fancy fairy dust kind of he's in the hills and he's in the air he's in the revelation of his word he's in the unveiling of his word he's in the preaching of the unveiled word that's presenting christ every sunday every wednesday every time you pick up a book every time you play a tape it's presenting christ that's how you come to him you come to this revelation of this word and you feed on it and it alone and you absorb it with everything that's in your life so why so you can unite with christ so that he can take it from print on paper to a reality in your heart so it moves from understanding to revelation but it's never going to happen waiting for him to come we're never going to move from intellect to revelation waiting for him to come we're never going to move it's never going to move from paper to reality just sitting back on our heels and waiting them to come the only way it's going to happen is if we've heard those seven thunders we've got to start climbing this mountain and this mountain is this revealed word and step by step bite by bite eat the book take it in and say god you've got to make this a living reality oh christ i want to be one with you it's got to be more than paper and ink it's got to be more than a preacher's word it's got to be a living reality inside of me how are you going to get it don't wait he's here don't wait for him to come he's come amen don't wait for something else to happen it's already happened amen what we got to do is start up that mountain forget about the barriers and the old scarecrows and the old don't climb this mountain get past the barrier break through the barrier and start climbing this mountain one book two books another tape fellowship with believers preaching of the word what are you doing you're climbing the mountain i love the word of god so simple that it's confusing it's so easy it's hard i can't say it any other way but those who receive the new birth who've come in contact with him it's so simple but it's so complicated it just depends on which side of the thick darkness you're on which side of the pillar of fire you're on so complicated all these terms but when you see him all the terms say the same thing jesus christ jesus christ jesus christ jesus christ what's the cloud jesus christ what's the white stone jesus christ what's the thunders jesus christ what's the seals jesus christ what's the seventh seal jesus christ what's the bride mrs jesus christ terms terms terms terms terms amen but with a revelation in your heart all the terms mean the same thing it's him he's here he's present tense it's the seventh seal in action he's here let's not wait says in the easter seal or if we are ordained on that ground if we are ordained to be on that ground like the eagle walking in the chicken's nest if you're ordained on that ground the holy spirit is here to find you and when it finds you you recognize its call you know the hour you're living you know that these things are supposed to happen quickly you're raptured up to meet it i wanted you to read that so it wasn't me saying it because i've already been raptured now brother chad you don't believe in the physical i believe in a physical translation in my adam says of course why wouldn't i believe that who doesn't want to believe that but i've already been caught up where brother branham was caught up into that constellation of angels i've already been caught up into the mind of christ and he himself gave me a revelation of who he is that's the new birth and now you're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus oh what a promise what a heavenly father who would give us these things raptured right up to meet it oh praise god brother man looking at this picture and the lord begins to speak to him trying to do god a service he says something said to me turn it right i thought oh i think i'm looking at it right so turn it right see i thought maybe that voice means turn it to the right and when i did you see what it is hoffman's head of christ at 33. here look in here see his black beard his face his eyes his nose and everything else see the part in his hair here coming up and he's wigged with the white angel wig to show that the message of him being god is the truth he is the supreme judge of the universe supreme judge of heaven and earth he is god and nothing else but god he is god expressed in human form called the son of god which the son was the mask and if that don't make our message exactly right identified by the scripture identified in service identified by his presence the same yesterday today and forever therefore those seven seals are the truth brethren what gave him the confirmation when he turned the picture to the right and he said oh it was a white pyramid a cloud it was a capstone absolutely it was seven angels it was but it was also the headship coming to the body it was also the mind of christ coming down it was his headship his identification coming to connect with his body he says in spiritual food and due season and one day turning it to the right looking there was jesus christ just as perfect as hoffman ever drawed him it was standing there with a white wig on looking back down towards the earth showing that he is supreme authority the heavens declare it the bible declares it the message declares it all the same supreme authority with the white wig going you see his black beard under many of you have seen the picture we got it back there just turn it to the right sideways look at it there he is just as perfect as it was if it had been photographed of him they're looking at it from the wrong angle you got to look at it in the right angle listen and only the lord can reveal which is the right angle only the lord brother branham you know what he this kind of statement just throws my heart because brother brahman just said turn it to the right you see his eyes you see his beard you see his hair you see the part in his hair he's saying brother i'm saying turn it to the right that's the right angle and he says see they're not looking at the right angle he said you've got to look at it at the right angle and only the lord brother branham saying turn it to the right is not getting you to see it at the right angle you can turn it to the right say ah it looks like some eyes may be there and there's a i can see the beard and i can see the outline and i can see this but friends at best it's a fuzzy depiction i'm not taking away from the clouds don't at best at best you're you're looking and straining and if you use some light filters it gets a little easier see what i'm saying it's not the natural that shows you the right angle you've got to look at it right you're not looking at it right brother ben was seeing seven angels he was seeing a pyramid of white rock he was seeing a revelation of seven thunders he was seeing this seeing this seeing this and he says you're not looking at it right he's talking about more than just turning to the right you can physically turn a picture to the right and look at it and say i see eyes and i see a beard and still not have the picture right because when the lord reveals to you the the right angle of this picture when you look at it right you say that's nothing but jesus christ come down to unite with his church that's the right angle and only the lord can show you the right way to look at this cloud [Music] oh i love what he does stuff like that amen i want to i'm going to switch gears just a bit but not really it doesn't look like it but hang with me i want to read out a communion from 1962 brother em's in february of 1962 and we noticed 1962 is a huge year because brother brown's coming into 1962 and he preaches in march of 1962 the spoken word is the original seed and in the spoken word is the original seed he starts to share with us that there's a change coming he said there's been three seeds planted there's been an evangelical seed planted there's been a pentecostal seed planted and he said the word's been planted now watch what it produces and he's telling the planting time is over we're moving we're transitioning then he comes later in the year and he preaches the present stage of my ministry and he's showing you we're in 1962 we're in transition and in the end of 1962 he preaches sirs what time it is when he talks about junior jackson's dream and going west and meeting the constellation of angels for the revelation of the seven thunders so it's 1962 it's a huge year it's a transitional year from brother branham and and here he comes right at the beginning of 1962 in february february 4th and a message called communion he says we see that the astronomers are predicting sometime in this early part of this first part of the month beginning on the second or the fifth or somewhere along this month the indian astronomers predict the world to blow to pieces and the american newspapers make fun of it i do not believe the world's going to blow to pieces but i do say it's wrong to make fun of it praise god you know they're still talking about astronomical signs disaligning that aligning and eclipses and i'll tell you there's something to it don't make fun of it but don't go read conspiracy theories on it either don't waste your time but there's something to it he does it first in the heavens before it does it on earth he said the american newspapers make fun of it i do not believe the world's going to blow the pieces but i do say it's wrong to make fun of him because something's fixing to happen one of these days something similar to that when the five planets mars jupiter venus and so forth comes into their they never have did it oh they claimed maybe 25 000 years ago but who was back there to know it i predict that this has a spiritual application big statement i believe it's the coming in of the issue of god that the great revelations of the word will be open during this time that's a huge statement he hasn't even preached surges this the time yet he hasn't even got the vision of getting caught up in the constellation he hasn't even heard about the six dreams yet but here he says i believe that great revelations of the word will be opened during this time remember they claim it was three stars that came into orbits when jesus was born and this is five and five is grace the number of grace three is the number of perfection five is the number of grace j-e-s-u-s grace g-r-a-c-e faith f-a-i-t-h so forth number of grace god ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace catch that god ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace it won't be the obedience of the people as a prophet allowed to say that you could never be obedient enough to get god to send what he said he did it in his time that doesn't mean we're not supposed to be obedient and isaiah said in the 40th chapter how to cry to jerusalem that her warfare was over yet she was guilty of idolatry but it was god's grace that was sending him god sends anything to us it'll be his grace and not our merits so it may mean something i predict that there'll be a change i don't know what it'll be but i believe it's fixing to happen we're right on the eve of it now so brother branham reads in the paper and hears about this constellation of five planets coming together or whatever it is and and everybody's making fun of it and all this stuff is happening he said don't make fun of it there's something to it then he goes to say i believe it's going to be the issue of god bringing in these great revelations in the word and i believe something's coming and we're right on the eve of it now and the next month he preaches spoken word is the original seed which is a six hour message that tells us he's planted these three these three seeds are planted he's planted the word watch what's coming forth now something's going to come forth on the spoken word then he comes the next day for his spoken word the original seed the next day spoken word in the original seed was march 18 1962 on march 19 1962 he preaches the end time signed seed this is what he says three is the number of perfection we all know that three is god's number in his numerology god is known by his numbers three is perfection and seven is worship 24 is worship 40 is temptation 50 is pentecost jubilee so forth all of his numbers his numerals of god is perfected is in perfection now three is the number of perfection just before now listen close when the little baby christ was born three stars went together and made one morning star that reflected the coming of an infant christ a perfect one now what's happened we see a roar in the paper across the television out across the nations where five stars just fell in line with the world what five a number of grace every time these stars come then something happens on earth what taken place five stars fell in what was it an introducing of what he recognizes when the three lined up it was the introduction of a baby infant christ now he sees five line up and it's just happened in the paper he talked about it before he believes it's something coming he didn't know what it was but he believed it was something significant then he preaches spoken words the original seed and the next day he addresses that alignment of five planets and he says what is it it's the introducing of what since jen just look what taken place now pay close attention five stars line up it's introducing something three stars introduced to infant christ jesus christ when he was coming to earth five stars introducing something but the time of the introduction is a great time of trouble so just look what's taken place germany almost washed off the map some of the magi said that the world would burst like a watermelon every distressful things prophesied by them for the last days look what's taken place england the other day had a storm that blowed away 70 000 houses one day disasters everywhere california and los angeles like to wash into the ocean what is it the beginning of sorrows when those five planets and grace lined up to introduce something for grace there was judgment on earth at the same time this is a big deal amen the beginning of sorrows earthquakes has picked up everywhere why is it five stars coming in line grace god's grace you're like grace what do you mean grace germany isn't flooded i mean england almost blowed off the map los angeles earthquakes what are you talking about grace it's not grace to everyone it's grace to a specific group amen and god's grace is to bring destruction to this earth to bring forth a bright new millennium for the honeymoon that's his grace and so when destruction begins to fall upon the earth it's just the earth amen in birth pains trying to bring forth a bright new millennium amen for god and his children to dwell upon that's why when we read the paper now we see everything possible going wrong how many believes everything possible is going on brother brandon preached the world is falling apart i'd love for him to come back now and preach it again let him read the newspapers for a week and preach the message again it's falling apart he said let it fall apart the falling apart of the world is the new birth of the earth for a millennium why is everything picking up in intensity because there's got to be a timing amen the earth has got to go in birth pains amen because it's got to bring forth a bright new earth for a millennium amen so you can't have the birth pains too early and you can't even birth too late because the baby's got to be born at the right time for christ to come in his millennial reign with his bride so the two have to be on the same time sequence so if you can look at the papers and you can look at the earth and you can say birth pains are picking up i mean the contractions are one right on top of the other and the intensity is is overwhelming the baby's about to come then you know that it's time this is time for the bride to unite with christ amen it's time for the coming back and setting up the millennial reign on this earth for a thousand years it's the the condition of the earth is showing the maturity of the bride [Applause] and so for us when we read the paper it's devastating people are hurting the terrible things are happening but you can't help but let anticipation build on the inside because this is birth phase this earth is going to bring forth a brand new a much more habitable never mind a place where i can live i can't live in this one anymore amen this one's squeezing me out and pushing me out and there's no rest and there's no place just to relax and rest in this world but this world is rebirthing a new one through destruction amen and when it's finished there's going to be a place where i can live and so those planets those five of those something was being introduced and the introduction of something that was god's grace amen was bringing trouble upon the earth and the natural amen because these two go hand in hand praise god earthquakes is picked up everywhere why is it five stars come in line grace god's grace what's happened an infant church a bride infancy that the power of god has begun to fall on her she's taking form a bride for this bridegroom brother brethren recognized what it was amen there was a prophet here to say you know back then the three stars it was jesus christ coming as an infant upon the earth and now there's been five planets what is it there's an infant bride coming upon the earth and brother branham is here as the prophet of the age to point to these things that tell us what is happening in the economy of god and he's saying the the 1962 the transition year amen everything's been planted no more planting now the revival fires are dying down now it's time for what's been planted to come up and begin to bear fruit and what now is coming up at the alignment of five grace lady grace the bride amen is now beginning to come up out of the earth this is more than a neat story you realize the stars and the planets foretold it and the whole earth responded to it and you and i will hear it and be like that's kind of neat do you realize what's going on we're missing it we're missing the relevance the impact the power of what's on earth today prophet of god was here to what introduces second coming the john john the baptist came first and then jesus came the elijah ministry came first then the bride came you realize it's the same pattern what's happened before is repeating here now and this is a significant event three stars lined up jesus christ was born five stars line up the infant bride is coming forth it's just as impactful friends it's just as powerful just as impactful it's not a neat idea it's not a concept it's not a trivial thing we talk about to encourage ourselves it is the very event that the world is responding to and still responding to is this what those planets foretold now begin to be birthed on the earth because the seed of the word was planted and a word bride began to form and come up and the whole earth was responding and is still responding in every nation falling apart and diseases and pandemics and earthquakes and fires and floods what is it it's all responding to the fact that lady grace is here on the earth amen and she's she's almost done with what she's supposed to be doing i would i would say it's the most significant thing that's happening on earth now is what's happening inside you and i that's a mouthful but when brother branham was here when brother branham was here and all the events around his life it was the most significant thing that was happening on earth at the time when when that blast went off over sunset mountain and those angels appeared and got caught up into the constellation you tell me one thing on earth that happened that was more important than that blast the rocks rolling off the mountain what happened anywhere else that was more important than that when he comes back to preach the the seven seals he has a night of meetings eight days of meetings he preaches seven seals you tell me one event that was going on that was more significant than that event right there but because it happens in flesh and it's so humble and it's so basic it's so natural and then we overlook it and don't realize the significance and friends we don't realize the significance of our lives on this planet right now we keep we we we we suffer because we're stuck in human flesh and human mind we're suffering that's why we got to constantly be in the word all the time because the devil's constantly trying to distract us and and make everything normal and just human and just fleshly but the supernatural is taking place on earth right now said the bride the empathy that the power of god has begun to fall on her she's taking form a bride for this bridegroom that three stars meant is perfection of the heavenly father of the trinity becoming one on earth god's office is becoming one office what happened now it's the church of the living god coming together under the word of god and the astronomical heaven is announcing her approach amen might not believe that but it's the word just the same yes sir what happened i might say this friends the church is coming forth god's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle and she's predestinated god said so he would have it that makes it right who's a member i don't know i'm trusting to be myself i'm trusting that you are a member but he's going to have a body without spot or wrinkle and i believe that these latter-day signs and these things that's happening every one of them is peeling together to show that christ is ready to come for his bride as god in his word made manifest in a man a perfect man so is god and his word coming again and making himself manifest in a bride not not that not will do like eve did hybrid it to something else but the unadulterated word of god will be borne into that church and shall stand like jesus christ did with his holy spirit anointing his word amen i believe it's the announcement now and guess what it's not the announcement now the announcement's gone forth now's the living reality of what he announced here on earth i say god let it change my thinking let it moan my character let it change every part of my life amen let this which is the most significant one of the most significant things happening on the planet let it be the most significant thing happening to me if it's important to you let it be important to me if it matters globally let it matter to me not make it trivial or just something we've heard all our lives or i've heard that preached before it's not about preaching friends it's about living it's not about the concepts about the reality it's not about it's not about the past it's not about the future it's about right now here today the spoken word is the original seed he says as the end time prophecies will repeat i believe as the first forerunner came from the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of god the second forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word-born bride wait a second wait a second he's supposed to come and be the forerunner of jesus christ he's supposed to repeat that elijah ministry is supposed to do what it did before in john the baptist john the patterns came to point out jesus christ and brother branham says that forerunner is going to point out a word born bride born by what the word brother branham says spoken words original seed the word's been planted now see what comes forth a word born bride the astronomical heavens announce it amen the earth amen goes into disarray amen at the time of the announcement by pointing the people to a word born bride the bride of christ will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of jesus screaming behold the lamb of god will come forth from his lips whose lips brother branham's lips that means he's got to be here at the appearing of jesus christ that means the same one who points out a word born bride is the same one's got the point that the skies are his appearing and say behold the lamb of god it's the forerunner ministry to show the bride is here now the bridegroom can come and unite with the bride amen we've got the bride we've got the bridegroom he points out the bride he points out the bridegroom so what are we waiting for let's climb the mountain let's climb this word and get to him he said what's happened upon mount sunset god confirming his word that's what all this noise is about notice it's god fulfilling his promised word again of revelation 10 1-7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel's message the mystery of god should be finished the hidden mystery of revelations 10 1-7 the last message to the last church age fulfills exactly in this age saint luke 17 30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed the day when the son of man shall be revealed is when revelations 10 1-7 at the sounding of the seven thunders brother brahm says improving his word now remember that was not jesus talking to abraham there he's taking us all the way back to the plains of memory where three men came walking up to abraham two angels that would go to sodom and one that would be elohim god himself and flesh that would stay with abraham he said that was not jesus talking to abraham there that could discern the thoughts on sarah's mind behind him that was not jesus he had not been born yet but it was a man in human flesh that abraham called elohim the great almighty and jesus says as it was in the days of sodom now watch close in the days of sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed so what's the coming of the son of man it's the revealing of the son of man he's coming and revealing himself it's a son of man revealing the son of man not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride so we can say it was a son of man revealing the son of man but what was the purpose of that ministry and the purpose of that ministry was unite the bride with the head to combine them to together and if that invisible union hasn't taken place that ministry hasn't yet served its purpose let's bring it home amen if we've heard the ministry of brother branham the forerunner ministry and and we've listened to the tapes and we've heard the books but we have not yet that ministry has not yet united us with the bridegroom then that ministry has not yet fulfilled its purpose in our lives it wasn't to say god sent a prophet like god sent moses it wasn't so he could go up to the mountain and get the word and bring it to us the whole purpose was so he could take a bride and unite it to the head the body and the head together and if that hasn't happened the purpose of that ministry is not yet fulfilled in your life but i listen to the tapes every day but have you united with the headship are you in a marriage union with jesus christ have you become one with him have you received a new birth that's the purpose to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together he's coming in human flesh the bridegroom the son of man christ himself is coming in human flesh what human flesh did he come in he was there in the prophet what was the prophet he was the veil over the seventh seal he was the mystery that had gotten caught up into the constellation of angels and come back and the revelation was hidden in him it was the coming of the son of man coming in flesh to unite the two together do we believe that then let's read on the church has to be the word he is the word the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman i don't know do you see what i mean see it's a it's son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper amen she's already united see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage see fill yourself with yourself of the flesh of the mighty men because the marriage of the lamb has come but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person then they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing now now let's dial in dial in i know we've preached a long time and you're tired but let's dial it right in the son of man came right down in human flesh and brother branham was the veil that was veiling the seventh seal his whole ministry was the seventh seal he was the messenger of the seventh seal he was the end time messenger with the end time seal the coming of the son of man in the revealing of the son of man a son of man revealing the son of man christ coming into human flesh god almighty coming down to reveal the word to so reveal the word that will unite the head and the body together in an invisible union of marriage union we got that we all believe that to do what what was the purpose of that say i'm married i'm married i'm married married mary to manifest the son of man again he came in flesh and the prophet to manifest the son of man to make the word so real that he would unite the head and body together in an invisible unit to do what so that she would become impregnated by the word so when she become pregnated by the word what would she do she would produce the son of man again and now the mystery of the seventh seal lives on it's behind the veil of badger skins is behind the skin of the bride and there's people walking around with the veil over their heart but if they would ever get into christ he would take the veil away and they would recognize that it's the son of man in his bride making the word live i mean the bride word the portion of the word that pertains to the bride living today in human flesh your flesh and my flesh what is it it's a manifestation of the son of man christ is here it is the bride coming of christ amen when he came to and when he came as a forerunner he had to do two things john the baptist had to look at this vessel and say i saw the dove coming down on this vessel right he had to announce jesus christ coming but now there's another forerunner comes and he's got to do what he's got to point out a word born bride because there's no reason for the bridegroom to come until there's a bride here for them to unite with there's no reason for the head to come until there's a body present for the head to rest on so he's got to come and he's got to show the resting place where the headship of the revealed word is going to rest when it comes down and it's going to rest on the body on the church on the bride so there has to be a uniting so he's got to point out a word born bride and he's got to point her to the skies and say turn it to the right it'll take him to show you the right angle in this cloud what's he doing he's pointing to the skies saying behold the lamb the one who has a right to take the book and loose the seven seals thereof and unite the two together and guess what now god can take that prophet messenger and he can take him home because the transfer has been made the the uniting has come and now the seventh seal is still on earth in a veil and it's veiled and the life is shining so bright there's people walking around that have to have a veil on their heart amen because the light is so blinding all they see is thick darkness but once you come inside the light of the bright coming of christ amen when you step beyond the thick darkness you see the shekinah glory of god and the word lightens up for you praise be to god friends questions and answers on the seals questions and answers on the seals with the bride of christ would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture sure that's what's going on right now the bride of christ certainly it's the message of the hour the bride of christ sure she's consisted of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of christ sure she's got a ministry a great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble what will it look like it'll look like that guy sitting next to you and most of you are saying that's pretty humble what is it there's still a veil on the seventh seal but that veil is taken away in christ brother chad i just don't see it keep climbing the mountain i just can't seem to grasp it just keep climbing the mountain if something in you tells you this message is true keep feeding keep feeding keep feeding keep listening keep feeding because at the top of the mountain you're going to unite with him how will it happen i don't know when will happen i don't know but you just keep climbing don't be afraid of the thick darkness don't be afraid of the confusing statement don't be afraid of the terms once you get past that thick darkness it lightens up friends resume of the ages the brother of them says i sincerely believe that the spirit of god has been speaking to us not only teaching as the truths of the age but has been faithfully dealing with the hearts that they may turn to him that is the reason for all preaching and teaching for it is in the preaching and teaching of the word that the sheep hear the voice of god and follow him what are we doing we're sounding out his voice what are they hearing not the voice of the preacher or the teacher but the voice of god if it's the true word of god by the revelation of the hour it's the true word of god going forth it's the voice of god brother brahm says i'm just going to read a couple more quotes and we're going to be done but the man says in out of the church age book the later season church age a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time can a lutheran speak for god he knows he said at that time they had the fresh manna that came from heaven it came to luther luther was the messenger of the age luther spoke it out when others caught up by revelation and they started teaching and preaching and speaking it they became the voice of god do you get it this is just church ages lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tense toward dogman creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation see it always produced the living word for that day caught from a messenger master gave it to the people the people took it in and they spoke for god and they become the living word in their day and it happened age after age after age after age goes on to say when the methodist failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until the last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age what voice her voice his voice yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her so when you talk make your voice deeper it's not he's talking about it's the word god is the word christ is the word made manifest the anointed word for the hour when you speak the true word of god you are presenting you are the voice it's the voice of god through your voice coming through it doesn't matter if it's a high tone a low tone if it's soft if it's deep it doesn't matter what the what the vocal cords are sounding what matters is the revelation that's coming off those vocal cords and it is the voice of god when it is the word of god for the voice of god will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god as at pentecost i want to hear from god then why didn't you come to church today i want to go out into the woods i want to get all quiet by myself and i want to hear direct from god the brother of said his voice was in the woods and the last day is his voice will be in her i'm not saying god don't speak to your nature you understand what i'm saying so many times we go looking in the wrong direction in the wrong place but he said there will be a people who will be the final voice to the final age this god's voice will be in her that's what he says he says once more the world will hear direct from god i want to hear it for direct from god well once more the world is hearing direct from god and is the voice that is coming through his bride we are direct from god is at pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age later further down in later scene churches he says oh god still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride as we have said and we will talk more about that later so the people of the world there's been a voice given to the people of the world is that true where's that voice coming from if it's not coming from it's bright it's coming from us we have to be that voice we have to be the living written epistle read in our written in our hearts read by all men by our lives and by our speech and by our preaching and by our teaching it all has to say the same thing our whole life what we teach what we speak what we preach what we wear where we go all has to be the voice of god to this age oh man praise god we're running out of time but god help us we're going to wrap up i don't want to go too far brother brahman says and further in the latest in church age but thank god at this moment this age is not over he is yet crying and his cries not only in the spiritual ears of men but his spirit but once again a prophet is in the land once more god will reveal the truth as he did to paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the later seeing age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of god as revealed to paul he will speak out and those who receive the prophet in his own name will receive the benefit the beneficent effect of that prophet's ministry and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day who are mentioned in revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bride say come the corner of wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground at night see has come back to original word grain again praise god forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of god who appears in the last age what he says from god the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing we'll be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word they are saying it now come out from among her now and be separate the cry has gone out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last age there's a cry going on in the land but it's going out from where from his bride see it's not the flesh the flesh is the veil but what's behind the veil what's behind the veil is the mystery of the seventh seal the end time the end time mystery message the end time seal the coming of the lord where is it where is the coming of the lord where is the end time seal why can i put my hands on it can i put it in a book can i diagram it on paper that mystery was alive in that prophet and that mystery is alive and you and me where is the end time seal it's behind badger skins where is the seventh seal i'm waiting for it it's all around you it's all around you don't miss it it's the seventh seal hidden the son of man coming through a bride already did it in one man already did in the prophet already did in the forerunner the forerunners pointed it out and now what he pointed to has united with the head ship and now the head is here united to bride to display his own life and it is the seventh seal how do i get there get caught up into that headshot be the little mystery rock the little white rock of a new name caught up into the constellation of angels the mysteries known only to them and let god reveal who this is to your heart and come back off the mountain veiled with a shining bright life nobody knows what's behind the veil until they go behind the veil what are we here to do portray jesus christ we're here to live for him let's all stand read one quote musicians if you come yeah let's read this last quote together while you're standing now if there are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be the word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living and if we can't see him in that then we can't see him in this hour i hope i hope that hits home if we can't see him behind the veil then we haven't been behind the veil but if we go into christ the veil over our heart will be taken away and when we behold him face to face this is not another person the second person a third person it is the person it is the son of man whatever was in that prophet now through an invisible union is in you and i and there's another voice on this earth and what the voice the spirit and the and the prophet and the bride will all be saying the same is that true why because they have the revelation of the mystery not titled this don't be afraid of the voice don't be afraid of his voice don't be afraid of his voice see we can still be afraid of his voice because we don't trust where it's coming from because now his voice is where in the bride and i just want to go to a tape i just want to stay behind the barrier i just want somebody else to go up and come down i just want to stay in my pew and let the preacher make the journey you see what i was saying at the beginning i want to bring it right here now the same thing i said about horeb applies right now his voice is in his bride his bride is united to them where in the top of mount zion and the thunders and the lightnings and the earthquakes and the voices and he's come down in his headship to unite with the body at the top of the mountain at the top at the end of the church ages and now his voice is in her don't be afraid of his voice just because it's coming from her it's important friends it's more important than you may realize so many times we don't want to accept something because of the sound of the voice that speaks it or because the place it comes from but his voice is in his bride remember we went to revelations chapter i don't know chapter something where the angel takes the golden read and measures the city but then you go to revelation chapter 11 and john's given a read and john measures the temple and the altar and those that worship there i can take it from the angel but can i take it from john do you see what i'm saying i can take it from the angel when the angel says it but when that angel gave a rod the angel gave a rod to john and told john to go measure it now john knows the measurement of it that's the scriptures i'm not afraid to take it from the angel but don't be afraid to take it from john either as long as the spirit and the prophet and the bride are saying the same thing as long as that bride is under her messenger for that age under her messenger she's the final voice to the final age if she gets out from under that she's no longer the final voice but under her messenger the final voice to the final age don't be afraid of his voice just because it's coming from his bride that's a big statement because when brother branham taught what paul taught he didn't just repeat verbatim everything paul said is that right he didn't just repeat verbatim everything paul said but he caught the revelation of what paul said and he preached it and brother branham could use his own bible verses to preach what paul preached and if the brides received the same revelation brother branham received brother graham said i don't have time to preach these seals he said i don't have time we'd go all through the bible it goes from genesis to revelation we go around and around that clock is those things he said we don't have time i'm just hitting the high spots just so you can see what it is but if we caught the same revelation then the bride can do the same thing if she's got the revelation she can take the bible and she can go and find those seven seal mysteries all through the entire bible and don't be afraid of the measurement just because the bride used the reed to make the measurement because his voice is in her and she has to be saying the same thing he said the spirit and the prophet and the bride have to say the same thing but they don't have to just repeat verbatim i don't just stand and read this quote let's go to this quote let's read this bible verse what's the point of preaching just play tapes [Applause] amen but god has given this revelation and the part that the prophet didn't have time to dig down and get out he's given the revelation to the bride and she can go into this word and dig out all of those beautiful truths don't be afraid of his voice because i tell you revelations 22 the end of the book who's the one calling the spirit and the bride say come [Music] come and him that's thirsty let him come amen a drink of the water of life freely you know what that means that means wherever that wherever somebody needs to come to have the water of life the bride's already there she's not saying go go up that mountain go to that place turn right here there's a brook over there water life's there she's saying come if you're thirsty come why because the water of life is flowing right through the tree of life amen and there's tree of life was on either side of the river male and female jesus christ misses jesus christ and the world river of life was flowing right between the two she's right there with christ on the top of the mountain where the river of life is flowing from the throne and she's saying come and drink come and drink come and drink come and drink and if you're scared of that voice you'll run away and stand afar off and say i want moses to go and drink moses moses moses moses moses moses this and moses this and moses this when jesus christ came to them they were still leaning on moses amen the same one that they would have united with on the top of the mountain came down in flesh is jesus christ and he was standing in their midst and he was saying if anybody's thirsty he let him come into me and they're still saying moses moses moses said moses as moses told us i'm telling you the same things repeating today don't let it repeat in you and i i want to unite with him i want to go to the top of that mountain i want to drink from that fountain myself and when i drink from that fountain i want to become the fountain till out of my belly flow rivers of living water and i can say come and drink where's the voice it's here where's the southern man it's here i can't send you anywhere else it's here there's no other church there's no other i mean there's no denomination there's no other baptist doctrine there's no one it's just the message of the hour in the bride of jesus christ that's the only place where this fountain is flowing it's the only well that's open in the house of david don't be afraid of that voice just because it's now speaking out of feminine form it's the same voice that spoke the commandments on the mountain it's the same one that spoke the thunders and the same one as the son of man now bottled and confined is that what the prophet said bottled and confined in the bride voice don't be afraid of it let me know i never heard that scripture brother i've never used that scripture get to the top of the mountain and drink get into the presence of god almighty and let him take the veil off of your heart till you can see him in every verse and every line until the book becomes open to all of us god bless you friends let's

would encourage them to climb god that you would climb with them lord and that you would help them reach the destination that you would make yourself known to them in a very personal and a very real way that there'd be something supernatural that would take place in the hearts of your children now to where they would know they've made a connection that something has sparked off and fired off in the soul and that something would lead them all the way through god i pray that you'd help us to be a clear voice in this generation help each of us lord through our lives through our choices through our speech lord our conduct lord and our preaching our teaching let us be a clear true voice as sounding of the son of man that you would have a a mouthpiece that you can use that we wouldn't do
