[0:00] an angel comes to
[0:02] Cornelius a
[0:03] gentile who's trying his best to serve
[0:06] the Lord and the angel speaks to
[0:09] Cornelius in a dream and the angel says
[0:12] unto him go into a city called J japa to
[0:16] uh uh Simon the Tanner and ask for Simon
[0:21] Peter he'll come and teach you what you
[0:24] need to know and brother Braham said the
[0:27] angel was standing there talking
[0:31] to to to
[0:33] Cornelius why couldn't the angel tell
[0:35] him what he needed to know because life
[0:38] didn't come through the angel life comes
[0:40] through the body because after Pentecost
[0:43] Christ is in his body on
[0:45] Earth the many membered body so brother
[0:49] so meticulously goes through this and
[0:51] spoken word is the Original Seed and
[0:53] then he comes to me this is the most
[0:55] amazing of them all he comes now to the
[0:57] Apostle Paul when he was Saul Saul on
[0:59] the Road to Damascus amen he meets a
[1:01] pillar of fire the pillar of fire says
[1:03] Saul Saul Why persecutest th me and Saul
[1:05] says Lord who are you he said I'm Jesus
[1:08] whom you
[1:10] persecute so Paul is speaking to Jesus
[1:14] amen how many of you want Jesus to do
[1:17] something for you you want want Jesus to
[1:19] tell you what to do you want to hear
[1:20] from Jesus amen Jesus was talking to
[1:23] Saul he interrupted Saul and he says
[1:26] Lord what must I do he said go into the
[1:29] City and I'll send a man that will tell
[1:31] you what you need to do why didn't Jesus
[1:33] tell him cuz he had to work through his
[1:35] body he had changed dispensations and
[1:38] now he was working through his many
[1:40] membered
[1:42] body and that is God's provided
[1:47] way amen and Paul Saul couldn't sit
[1:50] there I mean God knocked him off brother
[1:53] said his high horse knocked him into the
[1:55] dust the Bible says he was knocked to
[1:56] the ground in the
[1:58] dust finally humbled and he didn't say I
[2:01] don't want to hear from one of those
[2:03] wretched Christians you come back and
[2:04] you tell if you want me to do something
[2:06] you come tell me yourself
[2:08] right no if he's going to get it he's
[2:11] going to get it God's provided
[2:16] wayen praise God how many times do we
[2:19] pray and say Lord just tell me what to
[2:21] do tell me what to do if you'll tell me
[2:23] I do God show me the way God show me
[2:25] what to do I say if you start praying
[2:27] that way start looking around for the
[2:28] body to have the answer answer how's he
[2:31] going to give you your answer what's he
[2:33] going to do and we know God speaks to us
[2:35] all kinds of ways God can show us signs
[2:36] he can give us dreams we're not ruling
[2:38] out any of that but neither rule out the
[2:40] body speaking back don't rule out
[2:42] Phillip coming along don't rule out
[2:44] Peter coming along don't rule out ananas
[2:47] coming
[2:48] along to give the words of life don't
[2:51] rule out your prayer being answered
[2:53] during the preaching of the word don't
[2:55] you dare rule that out don't rule it out
[2:57] from fellowship at a believer's house
[2:59] when you're s sitting around the table
[3:00] and a brother says I heard this quote
[3:02] the other day have you ever heard this
[3:04] and he starts reading it and all of a
[3:05] sudden something drops in your heart and
[3:06] you're like that's exactly what I was
[3:08] asking the Lord about look for the
[3:10] answer to come through the body don't
[3:12] say God you're not speaking you're not
[3:14] speaking maybe you're not recognizing
[3:16] his presence maybe it's the presence of
[3:19] God
[3:22] unrecognized we need each other we need
[3:24] Fellowship we need a local body every
[3:28] Christian needs a home Church
