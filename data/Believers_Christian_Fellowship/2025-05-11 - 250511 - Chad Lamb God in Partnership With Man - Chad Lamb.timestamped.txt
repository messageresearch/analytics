[4:38] alone are
[4:41] worthy
[4:43] of my praise.
[4:49] Holy

[4:56] Lord, with all of my
[5:00] heart I

[6:59] Most

[7:05] Lord, greater than

[7:10] my sin is the blood that still cleanses.
[7:18] He is the grace that still
[7:21] sets me
[7:25] free to praise him.
[7:31] And I know that the
[7:34] blood of Christ. I'm walking in
[7:41] newness of
[7:43] life. And I cannot call for he's gater
[7:48] than all the blood of the lamb.
[7:56] Oh, I know that the
[7:59] blood of light I'm walking in
[8:06] newness of life. Oh, I cannot fall. For
[8:12] he's greater than all the blood of the
[8:17] lamb. Oh, greater than all my
[8:20] sin and greater than

[8:26] He is the blood that still
[8:29] cleans
[8:31] in. He is the grace that still
[8:36] sets me
[8:38] [Music]

[9:03] all blood of the Oh, I cannot
[9:08] fall. Oh, I cannot fall. for it's
[9:13] greater than all this blood of the
[9:21] lamb. Amen. Thank you, Lord, for that
[9:23] blood this morning. Let's go to the key
[9:25] of D. And then as brother Chad comes
[9:27] this morning, let's just sing this. The
[9:30] sun is up. The sun is
[9:34] up. Now I can go
[9:37] free. for the chains that were holding
[9:42] me. I can no longer see her long trumpet
[9:49] sound,
[9:51] declaring my
[9:53] jubilee. And all that I once
[9:57] paid again is restored to me. Price has
[10:03] been
[10:04] paid. All my sins washed away.
[10:09] for now and for
[10:15] all. For the sun is
[10:22] up. Oh, the sun is
[10:27] up. Now I can go free.
[10:31] the chains that were holding me. I can
[10:37] no longer see her long trumpet
[10:41] sound,
[10:43] declaring my
[10:46] jubilee. All that I once
[10:49] did again is restored to me and the
[10:54] truth is revealed.
[10:57] For he's opened the
[11:00] seals now and for
[11:07] all. The son is
[11:13] love.
[11:15] Amen. God be praised. Let's bow our
[11:17] heads together. Dear Lord Jesus, we're
[11:20] so thankful to be here again. For Lord,
[11:23] for us the sun is truly up. Lord, God,
[11:27] you've arisen. Lord, you've raised your
[11:29] word back into prominence. Lord, you've
[11:32] taken the veil away that veiled our eyes
[11:34] from the truth and all the things that
[11:37] were hiding the reality from us. Lord,
[11:40] you've removed it now. And God, the sun
[11:43] is shining upon us, Lord. May it bake
[11:45] all of the immaturity out of us that we
[11:48] become exactly like you till our lives
[11:51] reflect back to you exactly what you've
[11:53] been looking for, Lord. and the maturity
[11:55] of your children. God, may you bring
[11:58] your word forth, Lord, this morning. And
[12:00] God, may it may it quicken in our lives.
[12:03] May it become alive and real inside of
[12:05] us, Lord. And God, may it bring forth
[12:07] the fruit that you desire in this hour.
[12:10] For Lord, we're living in the closing
[12:11] moments of time. And we're so thankful
[12:14] for all that you've given us and all
[12:15] that you've allowed us to see and hear.
[12:18] And God, we want to refresh our
[12:20] commitment to you, Lord, this morning to
[12:22] give ourselves h wholly to you that you
[12:24] might use us. May use this vessel of
[12:27] mind, Lord, this morning to deliver your
[12:28] word. And may you, God, anoint our ears
[12:31] to hear all that you have for us, Lord.
[12:35] And may that seed that's cast forth this
[12:37] morning find a good ground in our souls.
[12:40] And may it bring forth a bountiful
[12:42] harvest for your glory. We ask it in the
[12:45] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[12:49] Amen. Amen. God bless you. While you're
[12:51] standing, let's take our Bibles and
[12:53] we're going to turn to the book of John.
[12:55] As we turn there, I just want to wish
[12:57] all the mothers a happy Mother's Day and
[12:59] say, "God bless you and may God's riches
[13:01] blessings be upon you." Amen. Uh
[13:04] motherhood is actually an aspect of God.
[13:08] Praise the Lord. Amen. Because God,
[13:10] remember, he's El Shadai. He's the
[13:13] breasted God. He's the mother of God who
[13:15] nurtures and nurses and gives his
[13:17] strength to his children. Amen. So,
[13:19] motherhood is a reflection of part of
[13:21] the nature of God. And so, we appreciate
[13:23] all the mothers and say, "God bless
[13:25] you." Also want to let you know that
[13:27] someone has uh prepared a small gift for
[13:30] all the mothers. So, after the service
[13:32] right out in the
[13:33] for all the mothers in the assembly, and
[13:36] they would love for you to take that and
[13:38] be blessed by it. Amen. Amen. Uh, also I
[13:42] just wanted to say we had such a
[13:44] wonderful wedding yesterday. It was such
[13:46] a blessing to see Alex and Amy united
[13:48] together and marriage. Amen. And we
[13:51] really happy for the Preston and the
[13:52] Bartram family. So, thank thank God for
[13:55] them and for this wonderful time for
[13:57] their families. And also a big thanks to
[13:59] everybody who pitched in and helped. It
[14:01] was wonderful. But I want to give a
[14:02] special thank you to Sister Amber
[14:04] Hatfield for all that she does in
[14:06] coordinating the weddings. Amen. She's
[14:08] done almost 30 of them now. Amen. and
[14:10] she she's a big help and she's a big
[14:12] help to me. It takes a lot of pressure
[14:13] off me. She does all the hard stuff and
[14:15] I just do what we do up here. Amen. So,
[14:18] we appreciate that and everybody else
[14:19] who helped. May God bless you. Amen.
[14:22] Let's look here at John 15 as we get
[14:24] into the word this morning. John
[14:28] 15 and
[14:32] five says, "I am the vine, ye are the
[14:36] branches. He that abideth in me and I in
[14:38] him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.
[14:42] For without me you can do nothing. May
[14:45] God bless you as you have your seats.
[14:47] Praise
[14:50] God. Amen. This has been an interesting
[14:52] week. As many of you know, the Catholic
[14:55] Church has selected a new pope. Amen. On
[14:58] Thursday. Amen. And and it's been
[15:00] historic for many reasons. It was
[15:02] historic because it was so fast. The
[15:04] choice is so fast. And it was a shock to
[15:07] the world because the world never
[15:09] expected a pope from the United States,
[15:12] but we expected it. Amen. Maybe not this
[15:14] time. We didn't know when, but we were
[15:16] looking for it to happen at some time.
[15:18] And I just want to say I feel privileged
[15:20] of God that my eyes have behold prophecy
[15:24] fulfilled in my day. And I'm so thankful
[15:28] uh to be alive in this day to see God.
[15:31] And you know, nobody could make that
[15:34] happen. Amen. Only God. Even the
[15:38] Catholic Church was shocked. They said
[15:40] e, you know, and brother Brandon
[15:41] prophesied this in 1954. And in 1954, in
[15:45] the minds of the world, it was an
[15:46] impossibility. It's not going to happen.
[15:48] And even in 2025, 71 years later, they
[15:52] still didn't believe it was possible.
[15:54] Hey, praise God. Amen. God's the God of
[15:56] making the impossible possible. Amen.
[15:59] Amen. So, uh, I just want to read, uh, I
[16:03] think I have, do I do I have this Franco
[16:07] on the overhead? I think I have. Yeah.
[16:11] Here's the quote so we can look at it
[16:12] and read it
[16:13] together. Brother says, I believe one of
[16:16] these glorious days when this United
[16:18] Confederation of Church goes together
[16:20] and the new pope is brought out of the
[16:22] United States and put over there
[16:23] according to prophecy, then they'll form
[16:26] an image like unto the beast. It's
[16:28] amazing. Brother Rem says United States.
[16:31] Amen. And I thought was neat, too,
[16:33] brother Dean Hatfield, he had stayed in
[16:35] a hotel on Wednesday night, Thursday
[16:38] morning, uh or I think it that was the
[16:40] case or no, Thursday night, Friday
[16:42] morning. Anyways, he brought me a spare
[16:44] copy he had of the USA Today. And I just
[16:46] love, you know, how when God did
[16:48] something, he put it on Life magazine
[16:50] life and he showed us the cloud. So on
[16:52] USA Today full page front cover is a
[16:56] picture of Pope Leo I 14th and and it
[16:59] says Catholic Church makes history. Then
[17:02] in bold letters Pope Leo the 14th then
[17:04] it says first pope from the US and it's
[17:08] for everybody to see on USA Today. Amen.
[17:12] So I thought that was amazing because
[17:14] brother Ram said the new pope is brought
[17:15] out of the United States and put over
[17:17] there according to prophecy. Then
[17:18] they'll form an image like unto the
[17:20] beast. And I tell you uh the true I and
[17:24] I tell you the true church of God will
[17:26] be drove together. The real true
[17:28] believers out of Methodist, Baptist,
[17:30] Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Nazarene,
[17:32] Pilgrim, holiness, whatever they'll be,
[17:34] will go together and cemented by the
[17:36] love of God that'll make the body of the
[17:39] Lord Jesus Christ, all the believers and
[17:41] agnostic and shallow minded will be cast
[17:43] to one side. They'll go right on into
[17:45] the confederation of churches. So, it
[17:48] was exciting to see a fulfillment of
[17:50] prophecy in our day. And it seems like
[17:52] God's just checking them off all the
[17:54] time. Amen. Prophecy being fulfilled in
[17:56] our day. And we knew we were in the end
[17:58] time. We knew we're in the harvest time.
[18:00] We were knew we in the final ages. This
[18:02] is we've known for some time. But we're
[18:04] watching one by one everything move into
[18:07] position. And the whole world keeps
[18:09] moving into this position. Amen. And
[18:12] there's still so many things. We don't
[18:13] know how things will transpire. But you
[18:15] see God doing what God promised he would
[18:18] do. Amen. But what thrilled me about all
[18:20] of this is it's in this hour. It's in
[18:23] this time. And when we say hour and
[18:25] time, we don't know days, weeks, months,
[18:27] years. Like we don't want to put our own
[18:29] interpretation to it. So we got to be
[18:31] careful of that. But he said the real
[18:33] true believers out in Methodist,
[18:35] Baptist, Presbyterian, Pent. Well,
[18:37] that's us.
[18:39] We're out of Methodist, Baptist,
[18:40] Pentecost of the world. But I believe
[18:42] there's more to come. This is the
[18:44] exciting part for me that that according
[18:46] to this I expect there'll be more true
[18:49] believers coming out of Methodist. Amen.
[18:51] And coming and then the most exciting
[18:54] part being cemented coming together
[18:56] being cemented by the love of God. This
[18:58] is a great hour we live in for the bride
[19:00] of Jesus Christ. I expect us to be
[19:03] cemented together more and more in the
[19:05] love of God.
[19:07] Amen. That'll make the body of the Lord
[19:10] Jesus Christ. So, I say God bless you.
[19:15] Amen. And God be praised. I wanted to uh
[19:18] take a minute and I I don't really want
[19:20] to preach on this, but there's no way we
[19:22] can't talk about it. Amen. It's so
[19:24] exciting. But but really for us,
[19:27] nothing's changed.
[19:30] Nothing's actually changed. We're not
[19:32] supposed to do something different now
[19:33] or act in a different way or change our
[19:36] behavior or attitude or action. We
[19:37] should have already we've we we're
[19:39] already believers before this. This
[19:42] doesn't make us more of a believer. It
[19:43] shouldn't make us more of a believer. So
[19:45] for us, nothing changes. We're supposed
[19:47] to just continue on as we've been
[19:49] continuing on. And really, all the
[19:52] prophecy being fulfilled, it's fulfilled
[19:55] in conjunction with the maturity of the
[19:57] bride because one can't get ahead of the
[20:00] other. So it just shows that God is
[20:03] maturing his bride. But how's he doing
[20:05] it? He's doing it by bringing his word
[20:07] and she's laying in the presence of the
[20:09] sun to bake all the greenness out of
[20:11] her. Amen. So what are we supposed to do
[20:13] now?
[20:15] Lay in the presence of the sun and bake
[20:17] the rest of the greenness out so the
[20:18] rest of prophecy can be fulfilled. I
[20:20] mean the scripture said the bride has
[20:22] made herself ready. How? By feeding on
[20:24] the word and by taking the garment of
[20:26] the word and putting it on herself.
[20:28] Amen. That's all what we've been doing.
[20:30] That's what we're supposed to continue
[20:31] to do. Amen. God will take care of
[20:34] fulfilling all of his
[20:36] prophecy. Amen. I've seen where so many
[20:39] people now are diving in deep diving
[20:41] into the birth date of this new pope and
[20:44] and the name and and I think his name is
[20:46] interesting. Leo the 14. Like super
[20:49] interesting, but I'm not a prophet. I'm
[20:51] not going to tell you all that it means.
[20:52] I'm not going to get into all of that
[20:54] and I'm not going to mess up the
[20:56] beautiful picture God's painted by
[20:58] adding my own thinking to this. They're
[21:00] trying to take his birthday and the
[21:02] years and all of this stuff. And I say,
[21:04] just let the interpreter of the word
[21:06] interpret his word. And God interprets
[21:08] his word by bringing it to pass. And he
[21:11] does a really good job of doing what we
[21:14] can't doise. We have no power to do
[21:16] these things. And he does it and he's
[21:18] good at it. So let's just let him do it
[21:20] and quit taking our feeble little minds
[21:22] and manipulating and twisting and trying
[21:24] to connect this dot and this dot. I
[21:26] mean, that's fine if you get it right,
[21:28] but the problem is if you get it wrong
[21:31] and send somebody's thinking down the
[21:32] wrong direction. And so, let's just be
[21:35] happy with what we see that this day
[21:39] this prophecy is fulfilled in our eyes,
[21:42] at least this portion so far. And the
[21:44] other thing we don't know, too, is how
[21:46] many times we'll see this prophecy
[21:48] fulfilled. There's so many things that
[21:50] we can't know. All we can do is be
[21:52] thankful that God sent us a prophet and
[21:55] opened our eyes. Amen. When brother
[21:58] Benham comes to the seals, I want to
[22:00] just share with you the warning that he
[22:02] gave everybody else and because it ties
[22:04] into what I want to preach uh this
[22:07] morning and on Wednesday as well. He
[22:09] says uh when he comes to the seals, he
[22:12] preaches the seals and he's telling us
[22:14] in the breach, this is a monumental
[22:15] transition. Amen. that the lamb is going
[22:18] to come forth and take the book and
[22:20] loose the seals and only the lamb can do
[22:21] it. And he comes past the sixth seal and
[22:24] he gets to the Sunday morning service
[22:26] was his questions and answers and that
[22:27] evening he's going to preach the seventh
[22:29] seal. And he and he comes to the people
[22:31] and he says, "It's been told to you
[22:33] before, so just don't try to put any
[22:36] interpretation, but just believe me as
[22:38] your brother. We're living in a great
[22:40] hour." Amen. Amen. We're living in a
[22:43] time Well, you just be real humble. Be a
[22:47] Christian and try to live for God and
[22:49] live honest with your fellow man and
[22:50] love those who don't love you. Don't try
[22:53] to make any You see, you do. You only
[22:56] make it a mysterious something and mess
[22:58] the real program of God up. This is what
[23:00] he says. The opening of the seals. The
[23:02] opening of the seals was a mon
[23:03] monumental shift in prophecy and an
[23:06] opening of the word and a transition in
[23:08] time. Monumental.
[23:10] It was earthchanging. It was it was
[23:13] heaven shaking.
[23:15] Amen. But what he told you to do is just
[23:17] stay humble and be a Christian. Amen.
[23:19] And don't try to add anything to it. You
[23:22] make it a mysterious and you mess the
[23:24] real program of God up. Amen. By
[23:26] injecting our own thinking. Amen. Now he
[23:30] goes on later in the same message. He
[23:31] says, "Now look here. Let me show you
[23:33] something. Did you know there's tens of
[23:35] thousands of voices in the room right
[23:36] now? Literally voices of people that's
[23:38] coming through. He's talking about
[23:39] radio. He's talking about television
[23:41] through the electronic waves of radio.
[23:43] Why don't you hear them? Their voices.
[23:45] Is that right? They're waving right
[23:46] through here now. There's people's forms
[23:48] and bodies moving right through this
[23:49] room now. Is that right? Well, why don't
[23:51] you see them? They're here actual voices
[23:54] like my voice. Well, why don't you hear
[23:56] it? See, it's got to strike something
[23:58] first to reveal it.
[24:01] Now, do you understand? Amen. Remember,
[24:03] I'm trying to show you that it's got to
[24:04] strike something first to reveal it. And
[24:06] it struck a prophetic gift first to
[24:09] reveal it. But then it's got to strike
[24:11] something in us as well. He said, "So
[24:14] just don't interpret nothing. If God
[24:17] wants you to know anything, he will send
[24:18] it to you. So just be real, real solid."
[24:22] Now hold still. Something has happened.
[24:25] Amen. So I'd say it's true today. Just
[24:28] be real real solid. Just be humble. Just
[24:31] be a Christian. Just live for God and be
[24:33] honest with your fellow man and love
[24:35] those who don't love you. Keep doing
[24:36] what you're supposed to be doing. Amen.
[24:39] And then he goes on. He says, "Don't try
[24:41] to make yourself odd to be a Christian
[24:44] because you take yourself away from
[24:45] God." That's right. Amen.
[24:48] Amen. That's why when we start diving
[24:50] into the conspiracy theories and you
[24:52] just make yourself weird. You make
[24:55] yourself a weirdo.
[24:58] And that's what brother Bam told us not
[25:00] to do.
[25:01] Don't do that. Don't play around in
[25:04] those areas
[25:06] watching people on the internet and
[25:07] tying these. Don't do that.
[25:10] God's the divine interpreter of his
[25:12] word.
[25:13] And listen, he'll bring it to pass
[25:15] whether you figured it out ahead of time
[25:16] or not.
[25:19] And he didn't require us to figure it
[25:20] out to bring it to pass. He'll bring it
[25:22] to pass whether we figured it out or
[25:23] not.
[25:24] Amen. What he's waiting for is the bride
[25:27] to come to perfection.
[25:30] So what will it take us laying in the
[25:31] presence of the son? Then further in the
[25:34] same message, he gets a question. Should
[25:35] evangelists continue on the field. He
[25:38] said in this hour of course what they
[25:40] mean certainly by all means don't change
[25:43] a thing. If Jesus is coming in the
[25:45] morning preach today like it was going
[25:47] to be 10 years from today but live like
[25:49] it's going to be at this hour. Don't get
[25:51] scrupled up now. That's why I'm trying
[25:54] to warn you about just don't be odd,
[25:56] peculiar. Don't change nothing.
[26:00] Now, just because you saw the Catholic
[26:02] Church elect a US uh uh pope, don't
[26:06] cancel your
[26:08] 401k. I'm serious. They did that in
[26:11] 1977. Ask some of the believers who were
[26:13] here. Don't cash it out and take the
[26:16] vacation of a lifetime.
[26:19] He told us not to do that. That would be
[26:21] disobedience to the prophet. Amen.
[26:25] Listen, don't change a thing.
[26:28] Don't get scrupled up. Now, that's what
[26:30] I'm trying to warn you about. Just don't
[26:32] be odd, peculiar. Don't change nothing.
[26:36] If you're doing something wrong or doing
[26:37] evil, repent. Come back to God. Continue
[26:39] on your evangelistic service just as you
[26:42] always did. If you're building a house,
[26:44] put it on up. If Jesus comes tomorrow,
[26:47] you'd be found faithful at the duty.
[26:50] If you're building your church, go on,
[26:52] put it up. I'd rather be putting my
[26:54] money in something like that than be
[26:55] found with it in my pocket. See, just
[26:57] keep on. Continue as you are. Everybody
[27:01] understand now? Continue right on. Just
[27:04] go right on as you are. Just don't stop.
[27:07] Don't do nothing. Just go right on just
[27:10] as you are. Keep on serving the Lord.
[27:12] Now, for instance, if I was working for
[27:14] a man and and and you know it was 15
[27:17] minutes before quitting time, well, you
[27:18] said it's just 15 minutes more, so I
[27:20] might as well just go over and and sit
[27:22] down. You'd get docked for that 15
[27:25] minutes. If you're planting wheat, plant
[27:27] your wheat. If you're digging potatoes,
[27:29] go on and dig them out. Well, nobody
[27:30] will eat them. That don't make any
[27:32] difference. Dig them out anyhow. Just
[27:34] continue on as you are.
[27:37] Get married. Have babies. Raise your
[27:40] children. Go to work.
[27:43] Because that's what God wants from us.
[27:45] That's where he's positionally placed
[27:47] us. When it's time to stop doing those
[27:50] things, you won't have to guess. Yeah,
[27:54] it'll just stop.
[27:57] Amen. Further down, he says, "Somebody
[27:59] said the other day, he said, a fellow
[28:02] came in and said, "Say, brother, you
[28:03] know what?" He said, "I'm going to give
[28:05] you the second set of keys. I've bought
[28:07] a new car." Said, "I'm going to give you
[28:08] the second set of keys." He was telling
[28:10] his pastor, "I'm going to give you the
[28:12] second set of keys cuz the rapture might
[28:13] come, you know." And said, "I won't be
[28:15] needing it anymore." Then, Brother Rem
[28:17] said, "Well, the pastor was going to
[28:18] miss it."
[28:20] You see? So that makes ready, isn't it?
[28:24] All right. But that's that's the way it
[28:27] is. See, you must we mustn't be that
[28:29] way. We must be a sane, solid Christian
[28:33] that I'm put here to work right up to
[28:35] the last minute. I've got a job to do
[28:38] and I'm going to be right found faithful
[28:39] at the post of duty. If he come, if he
[28:42] comes this morning, I want to be
[28:44] standing right here in the pull pit. You
[28:47] say, "Brother Brandham, if he was if he
[28:48] was to come this morning, shouldn't you
[28:50] be out there?" No, sir. This is my post
[28:53] of duty. I'll be standing right here
[28:55] preaching when he comes, saying the same
[28:56] things I am. Then when he comes, I'll
[28:58] just move right on out with him. If I'm
[29:01] hoing potatoes, I'll just be hoing away
[29:04] just as hard as I can when he comes.
[29:06] I'll just drop the hoe and take off.
[29:11] I'm so glad we had a prophet of God. And
[29:13] if we would have all taken that advice,
[29:15] the things over the last 70 years would
[29:17] have run smoother, the last 60 years.
[29:20] Amen. But thank God that he gave us such
[29:25] instruction,
[29:27] such wisdom, such reality. Amen. And for
[29:31] me, it's not just instruction for the
[29:35] fulfillment of prophecy. It's
[29:37] instruction for every day of our lives
[29:40] because this is actually go what God
[29:41] wants us to do.
[29:44] Whatever God's giving you to do is what
[29:46] God wants you to do. Amen. So many
[29:48] people are struggling in life with what
[29:50] should I do for the Lord. And and
[29:52] brother Benham makes it so simple. If
[29:55] you're a potato farmer, what God wants
[29:57] you to do is hold potatoes. That's
[29:59] right. Amen. He doesn't want you to
[30:02] become so spiritual that your field is
[30:04] overgrown with vines and you lose the
[30:07] harvest because your responsibility is
[30:09] to be a potato farmer. Amen.
[30:13] You say that can't be it. That can be
[30:16] it. Praise the Lord. That can be it. It
[30:20] can be that simple because God wants to
[30:22] be a mechanic, a farmer, a a housewife.
[30:25] He wants to be expressed in all of these
[30:27] attributes. He wants to be expressed.
[30:29] And no one form can express all of God.
[30:32] Jesus Christ was the only one that could
[30:34] do it. The rest of us only have a
[30:36] measure. And we express in whatever
[30:38] place God put us. And he wants us to
[30:41] stay in that place. Amen. Until he
[30:44] changes our place. And he has ways of
[30:47] changing our place. If God's ever
[30:49] changed your place, you know God has
[30:51] ways of changing your place. And so God
[30:54] wants us to be where he's put us. Yes.
[30:57] And he wants us to live to the fullest
[30:59] where we are. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[31:01] Amen. I think this is one of the great
[31:03] mysteries that was unlocked in the end
[31:05] time. And it's one of the great
[31:07] mysteries that actually abolish
[31:10] religion because God doesn't want you
[31:13] only on Sunday. That's right. And only
[31:15] on Wednesday. And he didn't just call
[31:17] you to come to church and dress pretty
[31:19] and sing. That's not the purpose of your
[31:22] life. That's only a very small portion
[31:24] of our life. How much time do you spend
[31:26] in church? If you count Sunday and
[31:28] Wednesday, how much time in the month
[31:30] are you actually in church? And how much
[31:32] time are you outside of church? And so
[31:34] when do you think God is actually
[31:36] working through you and using you?
[31:40] Every moment, every hour, every day,
[31:42] he's expressing himself through your
[31:44] flesh. And that's what God wants.
[31:48] Amen. And in in Satan's
[31:52] Eden, the prophet of God says this, "And
[31:55] so God knew that we would be here, but
[31:58] then he put us in flesh so we would be
[32:01] in contact. in order he could contact.
[32:04] He became one of us when he became Jesus
[32:06] Christ, the son of God himself, the
[32:08] fullness of the manifestation of God.
[32:10] Therefore, that was God's purpose to
[32:12] display his attributes in fellowship.
[32:15] Amen. When I was in my father, I knew
[32:17] nothing about it. When I became his son,
[32:19] I was born of him. I was an attribute, a
[32:22] part of my father, and you're a part of
[32:23] your father. And as children of God, we
[32:26] are part of God's attribute that was in
[32:28] him. Made flesh like he was made flesh.
[32:31] So we can have fellowship with one
[32:33] another as a family of God upon the
[32:35] earth. And that was God's purpose at the
[32:38] beginning. Yes, sir. That's what God
[32:41] wanted at the beginning. So what was
[32:44] God's original purpose at the beginning?
[32:47] He wanted Oh my goodness. He wanted
[32:52] parts of himself, his attributes that
[32:55] was in him to be made flesh like he was
[32:58] going to be made flesh so that we can
[33:00] have fellowship one with the other as a
[33:03] family of God upon the earth. And that
[33:05] was God's purpose at the beginning.
[33:08] Amen. What did God want? What did God
[33:11] always want? What God wanted, he showed
[33:13] us in Eden. He showed us what he wanted.
[33:15] He wanted the masterpiece family. That's
[33:18] what he wanted. He wanted sons and
[33:20] daughters connected together in love and
[33:22] harmony and unity. Amen. And and he
[33:25] wanted that's the picture that he
[33:27] painted and showed us. And that's the
[33:29] foreshadow of everything he's doing now
[33:31] to rebuild his masterpiece family. God
[33:34] wanted to
[33:35] become a family in flesh on the earth in
[33:41] fellowship with one another.
[33:43] That was God's desire. That's what he
[33:46] purposed at the beginning. That's what
[33:47] he wanted and that's what he's restoring
[33:49] now. Amen. What is the mystery? Amen.
[33:52] What is the great mystery of God?
[33:54] Revelation 10:7, "In the days of the
[33:56] voice of the seventh angel, the mystery
[33:57] of God shall be finished." What is the
[33:59] great mystery of God? What was the
[34:01] mystery laying under those seals? What
[34:03] was it that was kept hid from us all
[34:05] through the church ages? What was it
[34:07] that opened up? Why did Brother
[34:08] Brandon's Bible become a new book? What
[34:10] was the great mystery that was laying
[34:12] under those seals? After the mystery of
[34:13] each seal was revealed, there was
[34:15] another mystery. the mystery of God. And
[34:17] what was the mystery of God? The mystery
[34:19] of God was God wanted to dwell in flesh
[34:23] on the earth. That was the great mystery
[34:25] of God. He showed it in Eden. He showed
[34:27] it in Jesus Christ. And now he wants to
[34:30] show it in his bride.
[34:34] It's not hard, sir. Pretty simple. Amen.
[34:37] But pretty impossible, sir. It's not
[34:40] hard, but it's hard. If you try to do it
[34:42] yourself,
[34:44] it's an impossibility. But that's this
[34:46] great mystery friends. It's not
[34:48] something far away and complicated and
[34:50] hard to understand. The great mystery of
[34:53] God was that God wanted to dwell in his
[34:55] people.
[34:58] Praise the Lord. That's the great
[34:59] mystery of
[35:01] God. He he says in Christ is the mystery
[35:04] of God. He talks about the three-fold
[35:06] purpose. And he said secondly to have
[35:08] preeminence in his body of believers
[35:09] that is his bride that he might live in
[35:12] people. Now, he could do that in Adam
[35:14] and Eve, but sin separated them. So, now
[35:17] there had to be some way to get it back
[35:19] again. That's what he wanted. He might
[35:21] live in people. That's what God wanted
[35:23] to live in people on the earth as a
[35:25] family of God. Sin now separated that.
[35:29] So, there had to be a way to get it
[35:31] back. in questions and answers. Uh in
[35:35] 1964, he says, "Now on the day of
[35:36] Pentecost, it came down the pillar of
[35:38] fire and broke apart like that, and
[35:40] tongues of fire set upon each of them.
[35:42] Not their tongues, but tongues of fire
[35:44] set upon each of them an elected
[35:47] selected group identified by his pillar
[35:49] of fire, showing that God had separated
[35:51] himself into man." Do you get it? God
[35:54] the logos separating himself into man.
[35:57] God not in one person. He is in his
[36:00] church universal. Amen. This is what his
[36:03] great desire is. This is why Jesus died.
[36:06] This is what Calvary is all about.
[36:08] Calvary purchased back. It was the
[36:10] blood. The shedding of the blood was the
[36:11] purchasing back of all of creation. He
[36:13] bought back all that was fallen. All of
[36:15] creation. But he also brought a
[36:17] sanctifying power. Amen. By his blood
[36:19] and by his spirit so that he could
[36:21] sanctify these hybrid vessels so that
[36:23] God could once again dwell in man. That
[36:26] was also part of Calvary to bring a
[36:29] power by the blood, shedding of the
[36:30] blood of sanctification so that God what
[36:33] was separated in Eden, God could get it
[36:35] back again so that he could come himself
[36:37] and dwell inside of us. And he started
[36:39] that on the day of Pentecost. In the
[36:41] message one, he says on the day of
[36:43] Pentecost, we find the Holy Spirit, the
[36:45] pillar of fire separating itself and
[36:47] sitting upon each member of the church.
[36:49] God putting himself together. Thank you.
[36:52] What was Pentecost? God putting himself
[36:54] back together.
[36:56] Listen. Oh, let me read it and
[36:59] just God putting himself together. Then
[37:02] with that group of people together, what
[37:04] does it do? It brings back the unified
[37:06] body of the Lord Jesus coming together.
[37:09] Amen. We think when when when I first
[37:12] thought of would think of this quote or
[37:14] read it or however it come to my mind, I
[37:16] was thinking, you know, at the pillar of
[37:19] fire broke apart and tongues of fire
[37:21] rested upon each head. And he said God
[37:23] putting himself back together like he
[37:25] was bringing uh the church back
[37:27] together. But in reality they were
[37:29] already been together and for 10 days in
[37:31] the upper room waiting for the Holy
[37:32] Ghost to fall. So what was he bringing
[37:35] back together? He was bringing back his
[37:38] attribute in their soul with his spirit.
[37:40] He was bringing himself back together
[37:42] again. It wasn't just the binding
[37:44] together of the people. It was the
[37:46] binding together of his spirit with his
[37:49] attribute once again.
[37:52] It was God putting himself back
[37:55] together.
[37:57] Amen. Listen, this is beyond what we can
[37:59] imagine. This is what the message is all
[38:01] about. Amen.
[38:06] He says in choosing of a bride said the
[38:09] other is pregnant by the word of God and
[38:12] will bring forth the body, the finished
[38:14] body of Jesus Christ, which is his
[38:16] bride. The body of Christ isn't finished
[38:19] yet. How many knows that? A man and a
[38:20] woman is one. Christ is one body. The
[38:22] word, the bride will have to be the rest
[38:23] of that body. And the two together makes
[38:26] the one body again like Adam was at the
[38:28] beginning. Praise be to God. This is
[38:30] what God's doing. There's another quote
[38:32] that I want to read to you. It's not on
[38:34] the overhead, but this is from what was
[38:36] the Holy Ghost given for from
[38:38] 1959. He says, "In the cool of the
[38:41] evening, he'd come down and commune with
[38:43] them." speaking of Eden now. And there
[38:46] he lost that fellowship because sin
[38:48] would not let him do it. And then he was
[38:50] made flesh and dwelt among us in order
[38:52] that he could come back again to man and
[38:55] live in man and restore man to a state
[38:57] of communion with him again and give him
[38:59] back his God-given right. That's what he
[39:01] did. This is what Calvary is all about.
[39:03] Amen.
[39:05] He says that's the purpose of the Holy
[39:08] Ghost is the father again, God the
[39:11] Father dwelling in you. Amen. Working
[39:13] out his plans to finish his plan of
[39:16] redemption. Working through you, making
[39:18] you a co-worker with him, giving you a
[39:22] place, giving you a part of your a a
[39:24] part for your fallen, lost brothers and
[39:26] sisters, giving you his spirit and his
[39:28] love to go hunt the lost as he did in
[39:31] the Garden of Eden. So, what is the Holy
[39:33] Ghost? It's it's God the Father coming
[39:35] back in man again. Amen. Providing his
[39:38] spirit and his life. Amen. giving you
[39:41] making you a co-orker with him in this
[39:44] plan of redemption as he put in you love
[39:46] and a desire to seek out your lost
[39:48] brethren. This is God coming back in
[39:51] man. Amen.
[39:53] Amen. And he says in Colossians to whom
[39:57] God would make known what is the riches
[39:58] of the glory of this mystery among the
[40:00] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[40:03] of glory. This mystery is Christ in you.
[40:08] Amen. Amen.
[40:10] Amen. He says in 1 Corinthians 12:12,
[40:14] "For as the body is one and hath many
[40:17] members, and all the members of that one
[40:19] body being many are one body, so also is
[40:22] Christ." Amen. So he says, "So also is
[40:25] Christ." So what is Christ? Christ is a
[40:28] many membered body.
[40:30] Christ is made up of many members. His
[40:33] bride body, his church is many members,
[40:35] all unified together to make one body.
[40:38] Amen. And it's it's the furthering of
[40:40] the body of Jesus Christ. It's what the
[40:43] prophet tells us. Like Adam and Eve in
[40:45] the beginning. Amen.
[40:48] Amen. Praise
[40:53] God. Oh, praise the Lord.
[40:57] All right. I want to go to this next
[41:00] restoration of the bride tree. Said,
[41:03] "Otherwise, you're going to form what's
[41:05] known to me as a bride sea." That's
[41:07] right. I'll go with you. You will be
[41:10] part of me. You will be my bride. My
[41:12] life will be in your body just like a
[41:14] husband and wife as one person. You and
[41:16] I are going to be one. At that day,
[41:18] you'll know that I am in the father, the
[41:20] father in me. I in you, you and me. Oh,
[41:23] I just love that. Satan just gets so
[41:25] angry at that. See the oneness of God.
[41:28] Amen. All that God was, he poured into
[41:30] Christ. All that Christ was, he poured
[41:32] into the church. There you are. Makes
[41:34] them all one. Amen. What does Satan
[41:37] hate? He hates this revelation.
[41:40] He hates this reality.
[41:42] Amen. We're going to get in later to why
[41:44] I believe he hates it. And God is his
[41:47] own interpreter. He says, "What I mean
[41:49] attributes was his thoughts." And a word
[41:52] is a thought expressed. And when that
[41:54] was in his thinking and when he said,
[41:56] "Let there be and there was." Let there
[41:57] be and there was. And now remember, you
[42:00] Christians were his thoughts before
[42:02] there was a world. And you are the
[42:03] manifestation of his thinking before
[42:05] there even was a
[42:07] world. You were in Christ. Amen. In God
[42:10] in the beginning that makes you then you
[42:12] see his subjects and the whole thing is
[42:15] God himself materializing himself
[42:19] tangible so he could be handled seen and
[42:22] so forth. That's what God is the whole
[42:25] thing. So we believe God is the whole
[42:28] thing, right? Amen. But brother
[42:31] Brandham's coming and making you part of
[42:34] that expression of God. That's right.
[42:36] He's making you part of the whole thing.
[42:40] The whole thing is God himself
[42:43] materializing himself tangible.
[42:46] So he could be handled.
[42:53] I hope it sinks in.
[42:55] We got to quit putting this off. That's
[42:57] right. Amen. We got to quit putting it
[42:59] somewhere or into the future or on other
[43:03] people.
[43:04] We've got to stop doing that. Yes, sir.
[43:07] We've got to stop feeling unworthy and
[43:09] it can't be me. Well, that's obvious.
[43:12] It's you're unworthy.
[43:15] And guess what? There's nothing there's
[43:17] no part of you, your human part that
[43:19] makes you worthy or makes you special
[43:21] enough to be part of this. It has
[43:23] nothing to do with your human form.
[43:25] Amen. That's just a tent that God knit
[43:27] together through bringing genetics
[43:29] together so that he'd have a tent that
[43:30] could express the attribute that he
[43:32] placed inside. It has nothing to do with
[43:34] the tent. Has everything to do with the
[43:35] life that he placed inside that seed of
[43:37] his that's in your soul and was put in
[43:39] your soul before the foundation of the
[43:41] world which is him himself, his own life
[43:43] that he wants to manifest and make
[43:45] material upon the earth. And he wants to
[43:48] do it in you. Yes, sir. And we can say
[43:51] bride, but listen, it's got to come
[43:53] home. It's got to change because when
[43:55] this revelation can strike and it's not
[43:57] for a future day and it's not far off
[43:59] and it's not for other people but that's
[44:01] what God wants to do in me. Amen. Then
[44:03] all of a sudden it takes away all kinds
[44:05] of nonsense out of our lives and pushes
[44:08] away all kinds of wrong thinking and
[44:10] wrong desires and wrong motives. Amen.
[44:12] And all of a sudden all I want to do is
[44:14] lay in the presence of the son and let
[44:15] him have his way with me. Cuz I'm not
[44:17] here for my own agenda. I'm not here to
[44:20] serve my own purpose. I didn't come by
[44:22] my own thinking. I wasn't placed in this
[44:24] body in this time in this position
[44:26] because I wanted to be here. I'm here to
[44:28] serve God's purpose and I want to yield
[44:32] myself to that purpose. But I can't
[44:34] yield myself if I don't know I'm part of
[44:36] his purpose and I keep I keep messing it
[44:38] up with my own thinking. That's why God
[44:41] sent a message to peel the veil off of
[44:44] our own mind.
[44:47] Thank you, Lord. to free us from
[44:49] denominational thinking, to free us from
[44:52] religion where I have to go through a
[44:54] form to be part of God. I've got to go
[44:55] through a ritual. I've got to be part of
[44:58] a group. I've got to It has nothing to
[45:00] do with that. God designed you to be
[45:02] part of him before the foundation of the
[45:04] world. And he's bringing you to fruition
[45:06] so that he can be handled. Hallelujah.
[45:11] Not in the church building, in you. Not
[45:14] in a group, in you. Not in a set of
[45:17] doctrines in you.
[45:20] This message is not doctrines.
[45:24] This message is a reality living in you.
[45:27] That's what the message is. This message
[45:29] is the mind of God, the plan of God, the
[45:32] purpose of God being unveiled. Amen. So
[45:34] that those that were in his mind before
[45:36] the foundation of the world can wake up
[45:38] from spiritual amnesia and recognize who
[45:40] they really are. That was the whole
[45:42] purpose of the message, not to bring
[45:44] doctrines and orders and forms and
[45:46] rituals and of course of course we have
[45:49] a church and of course we have
[45:50] fellowship of course we have those
[45:52] things and he said it in order
[45:55] but that's not why the message
[45:57] came or the message came to to peel away
[46:02] our amnesia.
[46:06] Amen. So that we could enter into rest.
[46:10] Yes. Hallelujah.
[46:13] So that we could just realize
[46:16] this is something God's done. That's
[46:18] right. From before the foundation of the
[46:20] world. That's right. This is not what
[46:23] I've done. No, this is what he's done.
[46:27] This isn't what I want. This is what he
[46:29] wants.
[46:32] Thank you, Lord.
[46:35] The denominational
[46:36] idea come to bring us into
[46:39] bondage, to force us into a certain
[46:42] mold,
[46:43] to make us have to jump through certain
[46:45] hoops,
[46:47] to to actually create insecurity.
[46:51] It creates insecurity
[46:54] because unless you're this, you're not
[46:56] this. And unless you're that
[47:00] but the word came to unveil you. Amen.
[47:03] To you.
[47:09] Amen. Thanks be to God.
[47:19] Amen. Oh, I don't know where to go next.
[47:22] Amen. You just you just keep pulling
[47:27] and we'll trust God because there's
[47:28] still so much more that I want to share
[47:32] and I don't always know how to share it
[47:35] and where to go and what to do but I
[47:38] just want to trust God to have his way.
[47:43] In the message God is his own
[47:46] interpreter. Brother Ram
[47:48] says what I mean attributes was his
[47:51] thoughts and a word is a thought
[47:54] expressed and then that was his
[47:58] thinking and when he said let there be
[48:00] and there was let there be and there
[48:02] was. Yes sir. And now remember you
[48:04] Christians were his thoughts before
[48:06] there was a world and you were the
[48:08] manifestation of his thinking before
[48:10] there was even there even was a world
[48:12] you were in Christ in God in the
[48:14] beginning. that makes you then you see
[48:16] his subjects and the whole thing is God
[48:19] m himself materializing himself tangible
[48:22] so he could be handled seen and so forth
[48:26] and that's what God is the whole thing
[48:31] praise God I know I just read that I
[48:33] just read it twice but maybe we need to
[48:35] hear it twice
[48:38] amen showing that we don't know what
[48:41] we're doing friends we're just here
[48:43] trusting God Amen. In Christ is the
[48:45] mystery of God revealed. He says this
[48:48] now he sanctified with his spirit and
[48:50] blood a church that he might make every
[48:52] promise in the last day be revealed. Now
[48:55] see he could go back and pick up what
[48:56] those other fellows had left off there
[48:58] in the last day and by his holy spirit
[49:00] reveal all the mystery of the seven
[49:01] seals and he is expressing himself. That
[49:04] is his purpose. That's why he died.
[49:07] That's the second fold of his three-fold
[49:08] manifestation. first to express himself
[49:11] in Christ, then express himself through
[49:13] the church. And the same thing, Christ
[49:15] was the word, and the church becomes the
[49:17] word when it lets the word go through
[49:20] them. Hallelujah. We're here just to let
[49:22] this word flow through us by the power
[49:25] of his spirit to surrender and to
[49:30] yield in the invisible union. He says,
[49:34] "Oh, the spiritual union of Christ in
[49:36] his church now when the flesh is
[49:38] becoming word and the word is becoming
[49:41] flesh." That's right. What a statement.
[49:46] The flesh is becoming word. And that
[49:49] just means the word and the prophecy and
[49:52] the flesh are becoming the same thing.
[49:59] And I just don't know. I don't know that
[50:02] we could fully absorb what this actually
[50:05] means. I think it means uh it has
[50:10] everything to do with what's going on.
[50:12] Has everything to do with us. It has
[50:14] everything to do with God's purpose and
[50:16] God's plan.
[50:19] And the message
[50:22] perseverant. He says now we believe the
[50:24] Bible to be God's infallible word. We
[50:26] believe that it is the entire revelation
[50:29] of Jesus Christ revealing himself in the
[50:31] Old Testament by the prophets. God
[50:33] making himself known through his son
[50:35] Christ Jesus. And in him dwelt the
[50:37] fullness of the Godhead bodily. He was
[50:39] crucified for our sins. Died, buried,
[50:41] rose the third day, ascended into
[50:43] heaven, and is back here again in the
[50:45] name in the form of the Holy Spirit. God
[50:47] dwelling. One time God above us in
[50:50] Christ, God with us, now God in us. It's
[50:53] God working his way back into man. Amen.
[50:57] Amen. So God above us, God with us, God
[50:59] in us. Was God working his way back into
[51:02] man? Because he was above us, but he had
[51:04] to come. He had to be with us in Jesus
[51:06] Christ so that he could pay the price of
[51:08] redemption and offer the the power of
[51:10] sanctification so that he could get back
[51:11] in man. It was God working his way back
[51:13] in man because that's what he wanted
[51:15] from the beginning.
[51:19] God working his way back into man to
[51:21] worship, be worshiped through man. God's
[51:24] agency. God does nothing outside of a
[51:26] man being his agent, his helper.
[51:30] Remember the last quote when he says it
[51:31] makes you co-workers with him. I want to
[51:34] start talking about this co-workers or
[51:37] partner. I just realized I didn't even
[51:39] give you a title.
[51:41] Uh God in partnership with man. How's
[51:45] that for a title? God in partnership
[51:48] with man. Amen. So, I want to go back to
[51:51] this uh to this quote where we
[51:54] were that man is being his agent, his
[51:58] helper. And then in the next quote,
[52:00] we're going to we're going to talk about
[52:02] this for a little bit because it began
[52:03] to amaze me when I really began to
[52:06] meditate and God started just bringing
[52:07] so much to my heart and mind and the
[52:10] unveiling of God. He said like he was in
[52:12] Moses. When the word was in Moses, he
[52:14] was God in flesh. When it was in Jesus,
[52:18] it was God in flesh. See, only thing he
[52:20] done was change his mask, not his word,
[52:22] not his nature. He is the same
[52:24] yesterday, today, and forever. He only
[52:26] changed his form. He changed from Noah
[52:29] to Moses. He changed from Moses to
[52:31] David, from David, Joseph, on down till
[52:34] he come into the fullness of the Godhead
[52:36] bodily. That was Jesus Christ. It's
[52:38] still the same God. Amen. Amen. I hope
[52:41] that gets through. See, it's the same
[52:43] God, but he just takes on another veil.
[52:46] See, he puts on another veil. He did it
[52:48] in the reformers taking on a veil uh
[52:52] until finally it come down through the
[52:53] Lutheran age down through the other age.
[52:55] Then finally it comes out into the
[52:58] complete. Amen.
[53:00] What is the complete
[53:03] supposed to be Christ in bride form?
[53:06] till he comes back into man.
[53:10] Because his redemption price has
[53:12] redeemed man back by the purchase of his
[53:14] blood, by the sanctification of his
[53:16] spirit, by the indwelling of his spirit.
[53:18] He's bringing man back into his
[53:20] position. And remember, the Holy Ghost
[53:22] was bound by denominational rivers for
[53:24] nearly 2,000 years. He couldn't come
[53:26] back in full measure. Amen. Because of
[53:28] of of limited truth, because of wrong
[53:31] understanding, because of a wrong
[53:32] picture. Amen.
[53:35] And so now after 2,000 years, he says,
[53:38] "But in the evening time, it'll be
[53:40] loosed by the evening time message, the
[53:42] Holy Ghost back in the church again."
[53:44] Amen. This is where he comes and brings
[53:47] his unification. Amen. God and man back
[53:50] together. Christ and his bride in the
[53:52] invisible union. Amen. Back together to
[53:54] the complete picture once again in the
[53:56] end time. God working through man. And
[54:00] remember the comment about partnership.
[54:05] about his agent and his coworker. Amen.
[54:11] I I you know, I was I was going
[54:14] preaching a couple um conventions and
[54:16] while I was preaching it, these things
[54:17] just kept rolling and rolling and the
[54:19] more I preached, the more it came out.
[54:21] And the more I preached it, more it came
[54:22] out. And and I began to realize that if
[54:25] God put man on partnership with him, he
[54:28] made him a coworker. He made him his
[54:30] agent. Listen, there's there's more to
[54:33] this maybe than we always realize. Um, I
[54:37] I did a little uh demonstration or a
[54:40] little object lesson with them in
[54:42] Poland. And I had my interpreter with
[54:44] me, Brother Samuel. And Brother Samuel's
[54:46] fantastic interpreter. He's a good
[54:47] partner. But I got a piece of paper and
[54:49] I said, "All right, we're going to start
[54:51] a
[54:51] partnership because God put man on
[54:54] partnership with him." Is that what the
[54:55] prophet said? So, let's start a
[54:57] partnership. And in this partnership, I
[55:00] did it like this. Some of you saw it,
[55:02] but some of you didn't.
[55:05] So, I'm going to do it again. Amen.
[55:08] Here's the
[55:10] partnership. All right. You front all
[55:12] the money. All the upfront costs come
[55:14] from
[55:15] you. You set everything up. You do all
[55:19] the work. You run the business. You take
[55:22] all the problems. You solve all the
[55:24] problems. And you take all the bad phone
[55:26] calls. And then we'll split the proceeds
[55:28] 50/50.
[55:31] I asked Samuel, I said, "Can you sign
[55:33] here, please?" And he refused.
[55:39] That's not a partnership.
[55:44] That's not a
[55:47] partnership. Let's go to Exodus chapter
[55:50] 3 together.
[56:02] Exodus chapter
[56:06] 3 verse
[56:14] 7. This is when God comes. He's going to
[56:18] deliver his children out of bondage out
[56:20] of Egypt. and he comes to Moses and he
[56:22] gets his attention through the burning
[56:24] bush and Moses draws near and in verse 7
[56:27] he says and the Lord said I surely I
[56:30] have surely seen the affliction of my
[56:32] people which are in Egypt and have heard
[56:34] their cry by reason of their taskmasters
[56:37] for I know their sorrows and I am come
[56:40] down to deliver them out of the hand of
[56:43] the Egyptians and to bring them up out
[56:45] of the land unto a good land to a large
[56:48] unto a land flowing with milk and honey
[56:50] unto the place of the Canaanites, and
[56:51] the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
[56:53] Parizzites, and the Hivites, and the
[56:55] Jebusites. Now, therefore, behold, the
[56:57] cry of the children of Israel is come
[56:58] unto me. I've also seen the oppression
[57:00] wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them.
[57:03] Come now, therefore, I will send thee
[57:05] unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring
[57:07] forth my people, the children of Israel,
[57:10] out of Egypt. So, it starts off by God
[57:13] saying, I am come down to deliver them
[57:15] out of the hand of Egypt. And then he
[57:18] says, "Come now, I send you
[57:22] to bring them out to deliver them out of
[57:25] the hand of Pharaoh." So who's going to
[57:28] deliver them out of the hand of Pharaoh?
[57:30] It's going to be God. But how is he
[57:33] going to go to Pharaoh to deliver his
[57:36] children out of Pharaoh? He's going to
[57:38] go in Moses.
[57:42] This is co-workers. Yes, this is
[57:46] partnership.
[57:49] And you know, it's amazing because it
[57:52] seems like Moses is reluctant to sign
[57:55] the contract for this partnership. Seems
[57:58] like Moses has some hesitations because
[58:01] he's looking at his own inabilities.
[58:04] He's looking at himself and he can't
[58:07] provide in this partnership. He knows he
[58:10] doesn't have the strength, the wisdom.
[58:12] He's not clear speech. doesn't have what
[58:14] it takes to do what God told him he's
[58:16] going to do. Amen. So Moses doesn't
[58:19] quite understand the partnership yet.
[58:21] The partnership sounds like I'm going to
[58:23] deliver him, but you go and do it. He
[58:25] didn't realize that God really intended
[58:27] for this to be a partnership.
[58:30] In verse 11, it says, "And Moses said
[58:32] unto God, who am I that I should go into
[58:34] Pharaoh and that I should bring forth
[58:36] the children of Israel out of Egypt?"
[58:39] And he says, "Certainly, I will be with
[58:40] thee, and this shall be a token unto
[58:42] thee that I have sent thee. When thou
[58:44] hast brought forth the people out of
[58:45] Egypt, you shall serve God upon this
[58:48] mountain." So Moses now says, "I who am
[58:51] I? Who am I to go to Pharaoh? Who am I?
[58:54] Who am I to go do this?" And and it's a
[58:57] it's a fair statement. His perspective
[59:00] is right. I don't have the physical
[59:02] strength or the ability to do what you
[59:04] just said I was going to do. He's right.
[59:07] But he's looking at the wrong thing.
[59:09] He's not supposed to look at himself.
[59:10] He's supposed to look at the word of the
[59:12] Lord. He's not supposed to look at what
[59:14] he thinks about himself, but what God
[59:17] says about him.
[59:19] Yes. And so now his hesitation all has
[59:22] to do with his complexes and with his
[59:24] fears and with his inabilities. Amen.
[59:27] And it's the same thing's true in us.
[59:29] Amen. Amen. When we start preaching like
[59:32] this, automatically I I know beyond a
[59:35] shadow of a doubt, certain of you start
[59:37] to put yourself outside of the picture
[59:40] because you think you're not good enough
[59:42] and it can't be for me and I don't
[59:43] understand enough and blah blah blah
[59:45] blah blah. That is the enemy trying to
[59:47] keep you from your position.
[59:50] Cuz it's not about what you can do or
[59:52] understand or or explain or how strong
[59:55] you are and how much of an overcomer you
[59:57] are. That has nothing to do with it. God
[59:59] didn't choose you for those reasons.
[1:00:00] That's right. God God didn't choose you,
[1:00:03] Amen, to play that part. He just chose
[1:00:06] you to be a willing vessel that he can
[1:00:08] work through.
[1:00:11] Remember he told in and Paul in the book
[1:00:14] of Romans, he says, "You see how not
[1:00:16] many mighty, not many noble, not many
[1:00:19] wise, not many of this, but God has
[1:00:22] chosen the feeble things, amen, to break
[1:00:24] down the strong. He's chosen the weak
[1:00:26] things. Amen. Or the the foolish things
[1:00:28] that confound the wisdom of the wise.
[1:00:30] God is not looking for your ability.
[1:00:32] He's looking for your availability. He
[1:00:34] chose you to be a vessel to finish his
[1:00:36] work. That was his choosing, not yours.
[1:00:38] And what right do you have to refuse
[1:00:39] him? Amen. You have free moral agency.
[1:00:43] Of course, he'll never violate free
[1:00:45] moral agency. Amen. God gave you that
[1:00:47] choice. But God made you. Amen. He
[1:00:51] designed you and ordained you to be part
[1:00:53] of his program. That's right. Amen.
[1:00:57] Moses was his choice. That's right.
[1:01:00] Moses wasn't Moses choice.
[1:01:04] Moses didn't think he was a good choice.
[1:01:09] Hey, listen. At one point, Moses thought
[1:01:11] he was a good choice, but then God had
[1:01:13] to break him and humiliate him and
[1:01:15] humble him. And when God finally came to
[1:01:17] him to to put him into his commission,
[1:01:18] put him into action, he no longer
[1:01:20] believed he was a good choice. And
[1:01:21] that's what made him a good choice.
[1:01:23] Praise God.
[1:01:26] Praise God. Amen. It's good for us to
[1:01:29] realize. Brother Benham said, "You're
[1:01:32] nothing." That's right. Amen. He said,
[1:01:34] "Go stick your finger in a bucket of
[1:01:36] water and pull it out and see the hole
[1:01:37] you left. See what impact you have.
[1:01:39] You're nothing."
[1:01:41] Amen. But man is a paradox because just
[1:01:44] the same as you're nothing, you're also
[1:01:46] God's predestinated plan for this age.
[1:01:49] And he placed a portion of himself in
[1:01:50] you so that you and your flesh are
[1:01:52] nothing. But the attribute of God in
[1:01:54] your soul is everything.
[1:01:56] So you're a walking paradox.
[1:01:59] What am I? Nothing or a son of God.
[1:02:02] There's no way a son of God is nothing.
[1:02:04] But you and your flesh is nothing.
[1:02:08] But you're a son of God. Amen. Don't
[1:02:10] call a son of God nothing.
[1:02:13] Amen. So what am I? You're a walking
[1:02:16] paradox.
[1:02:18] You're a mystery sometimes even to
[1:02:20] yourself.
[1:02:22] Brother Rem said, "My wife doesn't
[1:02:23] understand me. I'm a mystery to my
[1:02:24] wife." He goes, "Frankly, I don't
[1:02:26] understand myself."
[1:02:30] So, there's nothing wrong with that,
[1:02:31] friends. There's nothing wrong with God
[1:02:33] calling you. Amen. God sending you, God
[1:02:35] using you, and you thinking, "I can't do
[1:02:37] it." There's nothing wrong with that.
[1:02:39] That's healthy.
[1:02:42] But don't say it can't be done because
[1:02:44] with God, all things are possible.
[1:02:48] Remember, partnership is not you're
[1:02:49] going to do it by yourself.
[1:02:51] God will be with you. But partnership is
[1:02:54] not God's going to do it by himself.
[1:02:57] He's going to use you.
[1:03:02] Let's look at verse
[1:03:04] 13. God already comforted Moses. It's
[1:03:07] okay. I've given you a consolation.
[1:03:09] You're going to come back here and
[1:03:09] worship on this mountain. Don't worry,
[1:03:11] Moses. Here's what he says next. And
[1:03:13] Moses said unto God, "Behold, when I
[1:03:15] come unto the children of Israel, and
[1:03:17] shall say unto them, God of our fathers
[1:03:19] has sent me unto you, and they shall say
[1:03:21] unto me, what is his name? What shall I
[1:03:23] say unto them?" And God said unto him,
[1:03:25] unto Moses, I am that I am. And he said,
[1:03:27] "Thus shalt thou say unto the children
[1:03:29] of Israel, I am hath sent me unto you."
[1:03:33] And God said, "Moreover, unto Moses,
[1:03:35] thus shalt thou say unto the children of
[1:03:37] Israel, the Lord, the God of your
[1:03:38] fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of
[1:03:40] Isaac, the God of Jacob, has sent me
[1:03:42] unto you, and this is my name forever,
[1:03:45] and this is my memorial to all
[1:03:46] generations."
[1:03:48] Perfect. We settled that. Let's go to
[1:03:52] chapter 4:1.
[1:03:54] And Moses answered and said, "But
[1:03:56] behold, they will not believe me, nor
[1:03:59] hearken unto my voice, for they will
[1:04:01] say, 'The Lord hath not appeared unto
[1:04:04] thee." Listen, God keeps answering his
[1:04:06] questions, and Moses comes back with
[1:04:08] more questions.
[1:04:10] He He's hesitating to sign on the dotted
[1:04:12] line.
[1:04:14] He's not sure he can keep up his end of
[1:04:17] the partnership.
[1:04:19] He's pretty sure he
[1:04:21] can. And then verse two, and the Lord's
[1:04:24] go and the Lord said unto him, "What is
[1:04:26] that in thy hand?" And he said, "A rod."
[1:04:27] And he said, "Cast it down. We know it
[1:04:29] became a serpent." And he fled from it.
[1:04:30] And he picked it back up at the command
[1:04:32] of the Lord and became a rod again. Then
[1:04:34] he told him to take his hand and place
[1:04:35] it in his bosom, pull it out, became
[1:04:37] white with leprosy, and he put it back.
[1:04:39] And when it came back out, it was whole
[1:04:41] again. And he says, "Now by these two
[1:04:43] signs they'll believe you." Let's go to
[1:04:46] verse 10.
[1:04:48] And Moses said unto the Lord, "Oh my
[1:04:50] Lord, I am not eloquent, neither hereto
[1:04:54] for, nor since thou has spoken unto thy
[1:04:56] servant, but I am slow of speech and of
[1:04:58] a slow
[1:05:00] tongue." My goodness. And the Lord said
[1:05:04] unto him, "Who made Who hath made man's
[1:05:07] mouth? Or who maketh the dumb or deaf or
[1:05:09] seeing or blind? Have not I the Lord?
[1:05:12] Now therefore go, I will be with thy
[1:05:14] mouth and teach thee what thou shalt
[1:05:16] say?" And he said, "Oh my Lord, send I
[1:05:19] pray thee by the hand of him whom thou
[1:05:22] wil send." He's saying, "God, pick
[1:05:25] somebody else."
[1:05:28] Verse 14, "And the anger of the Lord was
[1:05:31] kindled against Moses."
[1:05:40] My can you imagine Moses delayed drug
[1:05:44] his feet had hesitations had
[1:05:47] self-doubts reflecting on his own
[1:05:49] ability and inability and the
[1:05:52] impossibility he dwelt on that so long
[1:05:56] that it made God
[1:06:00] angry and the anger of the Lord was
[1:06:03] kindled. Yes, sir. Against
[1:06:06] him. And Moses was just being a normal
[1:06:09] human being.
[1:06:11] Realizing he had already tried and he
[1:06:13] failed. He had messed up and can't talk
[1:06:16] clear and nobody will listen to me and
[1:06:18] I've already tried and I run away and
[1:06:20] I'm in this position and he's just being
[1:06:24] like you and I. Amen. Moses just being
[1:06:27] like you and
[1:06:28] I. But God kept telling him, "It's okay.
[1:06:33] I've come down. I'm here.
[1:06:37] I'm here. And I'm going to Egypt now.
[1:06:41] Come. I'm sending you. You're not going
[1:06:43] by yourself. We're in partnership,
[1:06:46] Moses." Amen.
[1:06:48] Amen. Listen. Who's come down in this
[1:06:51] day?
[1:06:53] You think we're alone? And you think
[1:06:54] what he's called us to do and what he's
[1:06:55] called us to be in this hour is left up
[1:06:57] to our strength and our ability and our
[1:06:59] mind and our will. No. That's why the
[1:07:02] headship has come. That's why Christ has
[1:07:04] come. He's come to fulfill his own word.
[1:07:07] But he's got to have a partnership with
[1:07:09] somebody. Amen. That will yield
[1:07:11] themselves to his word and let him flow
[1:07:13] through them. Amen. He needs partnership
[1:07:16] with
[1:07:17] man. God comes and Moses is uh I can't
[1:07:22] do it. He says, 'It'll be fine. You'll
[1:07:25] come back here. There's your
[1:07:26] consolation. I've given you a guarantee
[1:07:28] you're going to come back here. That
[1:07:29] wasn't enough. God's guarantee wasn't
[1:07:31] enough for Moses. He says, "When they'll
[1:07:33] ask me," what's your name? And I don't
[1:07:34] know what to tell them. He says, "Well,
[1:07:36] tell them this." Then he says, "But but
[1:07:39] yet they'll not believe me no matter
[1:07:41] what I say." He says, "Here's two
[1:07:43] signs." Amen. Can you imagine why was
[1:07:47] the anger of the Lord kindled against
[1:07:48] Moses? Because God told Moses to drop a
[1:07:51] stick and it became a serpent and to
[1:07:54] pick it up and it became a rod.
[1:07:58] Who can do that?
[1:08:01] That wasn't Moses.
[1:08:03] Moses had no power to change the form of
[1:08:06] that rod. And Moses had no power to
[1:08:09] change it back. Who was that? That was
[1:08:11] God. He told him to stick his hand in
[1:08:14] his bosom, pull it out, it was leprosy.
[1:08:16] Put it in again, it was healed. Who did
[1:08:18] that? That wasn't Moses. That was God.
[1:08:21] Amen.
[1:08:24] But then when he was done, Moses still
[1:08:26] said, "But I'm not eloquent in speech. I
[1:08:28] can't do
[1:08:29] it." God said, "Who made a tongue? Who
[1:08:32] made an ear? Who made anything? Go. I'll
[1:08:35] be with you." And he says, "God, send
[1:08:38] somebody else." And the anger of the
[1:08:40] Lord was
[1:08:41] kindled. And you think about this whole
[1:08:44] dialogue. It's so interesting to me. I
[1:08:47] love the Bible. I love how real and raw
[1:08:50] and true and straight the Bible
[1:08:53] is. When you look at this dialogue, you
[1:08:56] realize God had no other option.
[1:09:03] I mean, that's hard for us as human
[1:09:05] beings to imagine, but Moses was born a
[1:09:07] proper child. He was born under a sign.
[1:09:09] He was born to be the deliverer. He was
[1:09:11] predestinated for this job. God was not
[1:09:14] going to change his mind. Amen. He
[1:09:17] foresaw this before the foundation of
[1:09:18] the world. He predestinated Moses and he
[1:09:20] had Moses born under a sign. He had
[1:09:22] Moses hid for three months. He had Moses
[1:09:25] put in in the in the ark of bull rushes
[1:09:28] and sent down saved by Pharaoh's
[1:09:30] daughter. Why? Because Moses is some
[1:09:32] super special human. No. Because Moses
[1:09:35] is going to be God's partner. And God's
[1:09:37] looking after his partner.
[1:09:40] Cuz he predestinated Moses. And so God
[1:09:43] now now going down the Nile with all the
[1:09:46] crocodiles in a little old wicker
[1:09:48] basket. Amen. Floating down there. God
[1:09:50] watches over and preserves him and makes
[1:09:52] sure no brushes the crocodiles
[1:09:55] away. That's right. And then floats him
[1:09:58] right up to the feet of Pharaoh's
[1:10:01] daughter. And she takes him and her
[1:10:02] heart melts. She adopts him. And then he
[1:10:05] and then God makes sure that Moses
[1:10:07] sister Miriam's there and suggests a a
[1:10:10] wet nurse. And that happens to be
[1:10:11] Moses's mother. So Moses's mother, Amen,
[1:10:14] nurse,
[1:10:18] listen, God had no other option.
[1:10:21] God had no plan B. God couldn't say,
[1:10:24] "Moses, I'm a little bit tired of your
[1:10:25] attitude. You're done. I'm getting
[1:10:27] another one." And if you're part of
[1:10:28] God's predestinated plan, he can't do
[1:10:30] that to you either. We mess up. We fail.
[1:10:34] We get it wrong. We go in circles
[1:10:35] sometimes around the same stump over and
[1:10:37] over. We get discouraged. We get
[1:10:39] depressed. We're doing good. we're doing
[1:10:40] bad. All of those things. Amen. But God
[1:10:43] can't change his mind about his
[1:10:46] predestinated children.
[1:10:50] And he can't pick somebody else. That's
[1:10:53] right.
[1:10:57] And God, listen, this is the
[1:11:00] partnership. This is what starts working
[1:11:02] on my
[1:11:06] heart in this partnership.
[1:11:11] God is going to bring a deliverance.
[1:11:14] Amen. That's right.
[1:11:16] God is going to perform miracles.
[1:11:20] God is going to bring plagues.
[1:11:23] God gave Moses two
[1:11:25] signs. The rod into a serpent and the
[1:11:29] hand. That was all God. Amen.
[1:11:33] But Moses had to take the rod to Egypt.
[1:11:37] Yeah. God couldn't carry that stick to
[1:11:42] Egypt.
[1:11:44] Only Moses could.
[1:11:46] Moses couldn't turn it into a serpent.
[1:11:49] He couldn't make it come back to a
[1:11:51] stick. That was God. But God needed
[1:11:54] somebody to carry the sign to Egypt.
[1:11:59] And he predestinated Moses for that job.
[1:12:03] This is partnership with God. There's a
[1:12:06] part that only God can do. And there was
[1:12:09] a part that only Moses could do. Amen.
[1:12:17] Moses had to go. Moses had to go to
[1:12:21] Pharaoh's court. Moses had to say what
[1:12:24] the Lord told him to say. God brought
[1:12:27] the plagues. Moses spoke the words.
[1:12:30] Amen. God brought the sign. Moses
[1:12:33] dropped the rod. Yeah.
[1:12:35] That's right. And it was Moses that had
[1:12:38] to take it back up again.
[1:12:42] It was Moses that had to put his hand
[1:12:44] into his bosom and pull it out and do it
[1:12:48] again. That was Moses' part. It was God
[1:12:52] who changed it lepros and God who made
[1:12:54] it clean again.
[1:13:01] Brother Brandon makes a
[1:13:03] statement. I'm going to try to find it.
[1:13:07] Just bear. This is not a touch screen.
[1:13:09] You always feel right real bright when
[1:13:11] you tap on a screen that's not a touch
[1:13:14] screen. And you just keep tapping on it
[1:13:16] like something's not working. And it
[1:13:18] gets even worse when you start blaming
[1:13:20] the computer and talking about how these
[1:13:21] things never work
[1:13:25] right. Let's look at this quote
[1:13:27] together. My new ministry. Now you say,
[1:13:30] "Well, if if he knows it, then why are
[1:13:32] you preaching?" said that's part of
[1:13:34] God's program. Preaching is his program.
[1:13:37] When he looked upon the apostles, he
[1:13:39] looked upon the harvest. He said, 'The
[1:13:40] harvest is ripe and the labors are few.
[1:13:42] Pray the Lord of the harvest that he
[1:13:44] will send labors into his harvest. How
[1:13:46] many remember that? Well, why would they
[1:13:48] have to pray to the Lord of the harvest
[1:13:50] to send laborers into his harvest? If
[1:13:52] the Lord of the harvest was standing
[1:13:53] there knowing it would be done, why? God
[1:13:56] has so arranged it. Now, listen to this.
[1:13:59] God has so arranged it that his program
[1:14:01] cannot move without you and I. And as
[1:14:04] long as we're not doing what God leads
[1:14:06] us to do, we're paralyzing his program.
[1:14:10] Amen. But when the church moves by the
[1:14:12] anointing of the Holy Ghost, then we're
[1:14:14] in God's will doing his program.
[1:14:18] Amen.
[1:14:19] We think God can just do anything he
[1:14:21] wants. But God has set his program up in
[1:14:24] a way. That's right. That he chose to
[1:14:26] work through man. Amen. That's God's
[1:14:29] program. And God is not going to violate
[1:14:32] his own program. So, he's got to have
[1:14:34] man to work through because God put
[1:14:37] himself on partnership with man. And God
[1:14:39] made man his co-worker in
[1:14:42] redemption.
[1:14:44] Amen. Let's see if we can go back
[1:14:49] now. We successfully made it over to
[1:14:52] another slide. And let's see if we can
[1:14:54] successfully make it back.
[1:15:01] Amen. Let's look at this scripture to it
[1:15:05] that God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:15:08] world unto himself, not imputing their
[1:15:09] trespasses unto them, and hath committed
[1:15:12] unto us the word of reconciliation.
[1:15:16] Brother Rem says in the message total
[1:15:18] deliverance, he says Jesus was
[1:15:20] completely totally
[1:15:22] man. He could cry like a man. He could
[1:15:25] eat like a man. He could be tired like a
[1:15:28] man. He was completely totally man in
[1:15:32] his physical being. And in his spirit,
[1:15:34] he was completely totally God. See, he
[1:15:38] made his flesh submissive to the spirit
[1:15:39] that was in him. You see, he was tempted
[1:15:42] in all manners like we are. He was a
[1:15:44] man, not an angel. He was a man. He had
[1:15:46] desires and temptations just like we do.
[1:15:49] The Bible said he did. He was a man, not
[1:15:51] an angel above temptation. Hebrews 1
[1:15:53] said that. said that he was Hebrews 1:4
[1:15:56] said he was made lower than the angels.
[1:15:57] He was a man, completely man. That God
[1:16:00] took a complete man to bring total
[1:16:02] deliverance and he filled him with his
[1:16:04] spirit. The Holy Ghost was in him
[1:16:06] without measure. And he was tempted like
[1:16:08] we were. And he was completely God. He
[1:16:11] proved it when he raised the dead. When
[1:16:12] he stopped nature, the roaring seas and
[1:16:15] the mighty winds, when he spoke to the
[1:16:17] trees and so forth, they obeyed him. He
[1:16:19] was God inside. And he could have been
[1:16:21] man. and and he could have been man for
[1:16:24] he was man but he totally and completely
[1:16:27] delivered himself as a man into the
[1:16:28] hands of God for the service of God and
[1:16:31] he is our
[1:16:32] example. So there's our example Jesus
[1:16:36] the perfect man. He was brother Bam said
[1:16:40] completely man. Amen.
[1:16:43] But then he says he was completely God.
[1:16:47] Praise the Lord. Yeah,
[1:16:50] he he was so good at being a
[1:16:53] man. When he says, "My my father is
[1:16:58] God," they wanted to take up stones and
[1:17:00] stone him because they say, "You being a
[1:17:02] man, make yourself God." He was so good
[1:17:06] at being a man, they couldn't see God.
[1:17:08] All they could see was a man. He was
[1:17:11] that good at being a
[1:17:13] man. It was God in the form of his son.
[1:17:17] It was God. Amen. In flesh, but he was
[1:17:21] so good at being a man that he was
[1:17:24] completely man.
[1:17:26] Jesus was more like you and me than we
[1:17:29] think. Amen. That's right. Amen. The
[1:17:33] only difference was hybridization. Yeah,
[1:17:35] that's right. He wasn't born with a
[1:17:37] hybrid nature. That's right. But he was
[1:17:39] man like you and I are man. Amen.
[1:17:42] Listen, Jesus got
[1:17:45] hungry. There's a lot of things about
[1:17:48] Jesus we don't think about.
[1:17:50] It said after he fasted 40 days, he was
[1:17:54] hungered.
[1:17:56] Jesus, his stomach rumbled
[1:18:01] with hunger pains. Amen.
[1:18:07] He got
[1:18:08] tired and he needed to sleep. Amen.
[1:18:16] He got disappointed.
[1:18:18] Amen. He got frustrated. Yes. With his
[1:18:21] disciples. And guess how many? When they
[1:18:24] had no faith.
[1:18:26] He got angry.
[1:18:29] He wept at Lazarus's tomb.
[1:18:33] He had compassion.
[1:18:36] He was completely
[1:18:38] man.
[1:18:40] Listen, I started I started asking
[1:18:42] myself questions and at first it was
[1:18:45] just it was it felt
[1:18:48] strange. Did Jesus ever sweat?
[1:18:52] Yes. Did he have to take a bath? Yes.
[1:18:57] Did he have to clean his teeth? Yes.
[1:19:00] When he woke up in the morning, was his
[1:19:01] hair ever a mess?
[1:19:04] Did the disciples ever seen him messed
[1:19:07] up? Yes. We know he had dirty feet.
[1:19:10] Amen. That needed washed.
[1:19:13] So he wasn't this angelic form like like
[1:19:17] an apparation just moving. He was a
[1:19:19] human being.
[1:19:21] He got hungry like you get hungry. He
[1:19:22] gets sad like you got sad. He got angry
[1:19:24] like you get angry. He got frustrated
[1:19:25] like you get frustrated. He got
[1:19:27] disappointed in his disciples. Amen. He
[1:19:30] learned obedience by the things he
[1:19:32] suffered. He grew in stature with God
[1:19:33] and with man. He was a man. That's
[1:19:37] right.
[1:19:38] He was more like you than you think.
[1:19:41] That's right. He got so tired he had to
[1:19:44] rest. He got overworked and had to go to
[1:19:48] the wilderness and separate.
[1:19:50] Amen.
[1:19:56] And this is what God wanted. This is how
[1:19:59] God always wanted to be expressed. God
[1:20:02] wanted to become man.
[1:20:06] God. When God wanted to become man, he
[1:20:09] became Jesus Christ. Is that true?
[1:20:13] God wanted to live in flesh on the earth
[1:20:17] with his family.
[1:20:19] God wanted to become a man. Amen.
[1:20:25] and have messed up hair and have to
[1:20:28] brush it in the morning and have dirty
[1:20:31] feet and have to take a bath and get
[1:20:36] hungry and have to sleep.
[1:20:39] Do you
[1:20:41] understand? Jesus was our example. He
[1:20:44] was a man. He lived a human life, but he
[1:20:48] lived a human life. So he surrendered to
[1:20:51] the spirit of God in him. So that God,
[1:20:54] Amen, was in partnership with Jesus
[1:20:56] Christ manifesting himself to the world
[1:20:58] and he became our example. That's what
[1:21:01] God wants to do. The only difference
[1:21:03] between him and I is he was born he was
[1:21:06] born perfect. I was born imperfect and
[1:21:09] he had the spirit without measure. I've
[1:21:11] only been given a measure. But other
[1:21:14] than that, it's so similar. It's
[1:21:16] shocking.
[1:21:19] Amen.
[1:21:20] God wants to live in
[1:21:24] flesh. He came in flesh as Jesus Christ
[1:21:28] to became one of us to become a brother
[1:21:30] because his whole plan was to dwell in
[1:21:32] flesh upon the earth as a family of God
[1:21:35] in fellowship.
[1:21:37] And he loved that fellowship so much
[1:21:39] that when Jesus Christ come to the
[1:21:41] garden of Gethsemane, the the the the
[1:21:44] agony he was in and the trouble and the
[1:21:46] squeeze he was under because he came to
[1:21:48] a wire in the road and he had to make a
[1:21:50] decision and that decision was would he
[1:21:52] take the sins of the world what God
[1:21:54] wanted him to do or would he stay with
[1:21:56] his beloved disciples what he wanted to
[1:21:59] do. Right? So that means Jesus could
[1:22:02] have a will or a
[1:22:06] desire that had to be submitted to the
[1:22:09] perfect plan of God. Amen.
[1:22:12] Is that what the prophet teaches us?
[1:22:15] Amen. And so he had a will and he had a
[1:22:20] desire that he had to die to and he had
[1:22:24] to give up and he had to surrender to
[1:22:27] the perfect will of the father. Amen.
[1:22:30] And this put him in such agony because
[1:22:32] as a man as God in flesh, he so loved
[1:22:35] the fellowship of his disciples. When it
[1:22:37] came down to parting with them, he could
[1:22:39] hardly part from them. He could hardly
[1:22:41] leave them. This is why he was in agony
[1:22:44] in the garden of Gethsemane because it
[1:22:46] was either leave them or take the sins
[1:22:48] of the world and go to Calvary. And he
[1:22:49] wanted to stay with them. He didn't want
[1:22:51] to part with his beloved disciples. He
[1:22:53] was loving the fellowship upon the
[1:22:55] earth. But the only way to preserve it
[1:22:56] in perfection and bring it back to Eden
[1:22:58] is he had to choose God's way and give
[1:23:00] his life and die and pay the price of
[1:23:02] redemption. Amen. So that he could come
[1:23:04] back and dwell in his disciples,
[1:23:07] not just with them.
[1:23:10] You know what this
[1:23:11] means? God wanted to be human.
[1:23:15] That's right. Amen. Can we say that? God
[1:23:19] wanted to be human. That's right. But he
[1:23:22] didn't want to stop with Jesus.
[1:23:25] Amen.
[1:23:27] God wants to live in you.
[1:23:31] Listen, if I could say it like this, all
[1:23:33] I can do is share with you what's in my
[1:23:35] heart.
[1:23:37] But this message is so simple. That's
[1:23:39] right. But it's so deep.
[1:23:42] It's so profound. It's so shocking. It's
[1:23:45] so unbelievable. It's so true. Amen.
[1:23:47] It's so simple.
[1:23:50] God wants to share your life. Yes.
[1:23:54] Praise God. That's what God
[1:23:57] wants. He wants to dwell in you, walk
[1:24:00] with you, fellowship with you. He wants
[1:24:03] to become one with you. Amen. God wants
[1:24:07] to share his life with you and he wants
[1:24:11] to share your life with you. Amen.
[1:24:14] Because he wants to be human. Amen.
[1:24:22] I know it's shocking, but it's what the
[1:24:24] prophet taught us. That's right. Amen.
[1:24:27] It's what we've been taught. God wants
[1:24:29] to come and be tabernacled in you. Amen.
[1:24:34] To where you become the temple of the
[1:24:36] Holy Ghost. That's right. To where the
[1:24:38] church becomes the habitation of God.
[1:24:41] This is what Paul taught us.
[1:24:46] God put himself on partnership with man
[1:24:50] as co-workers with man. God wants to be
[1:24:53] expressed in
[1:24:55] flesh. Jesus was the perfect expression
[1:24:59] of God in flesh. Amen. But that wasn't
[1:25:03] the only expression of God in flesh
[1:25:05] because now he wants to be flesh fleshed
[1:25:07] out in a many membered bride. Christ in
[1:25:11] you. The hope of glory.
[1:25:18] Brother Vanham says this and I find this
[1:25:21] quote
[1:25:22] amazing. Now in Christ dwelt the
[1:25:24] fullness of the godhead bodily. He had
[1:25:26] all the spirit of God in him. I and my
[1:25:28] father are one. Jesus said that's the
[1:25:30] reason the people couldn't understand
[1:25:32] him. Sometimes he'd say something might
[1:25:35] look like he turned around and said
[1:25:36] something different. It was him speaking
[1:25:39] then the father speaking. Yes. Amen. And
[1:25:42] even the disciples could not understand
[1:25:44] him. And right at the last they said,
[1:25:45] "Lo, now speakest thou plainly. Now we
[1:25:48] believe by this. If you know all things,
[1:25:50] no man need teach you." Jesus said, "Do
[1:25:52] you believe now?" After all the time,
[1:25:54] they couldn't get it. Why? That
[1:25:56] sometimes he'd say this and then say
[1:25:58] that. It was him and the father
[1:26:01] speaking. Amen. Sometimes it was Jesus
[1:26:03] the man and sometimes it was the father
[1:26:06] speaking through the man. And even the
[1:26:07] disciples couldn't figure out Jesus.
[1:26:12] Amen. Amen. What the prophet taught us
[1:26:17] absolutely
[1:26:19] destroys religion. That's right. Amen.
[1:26:22] Destroys religion.
[1:26:25] Because religion puts God far away and
[1:26:29] puts you on a difficult path to get to
[1:26:30] God.
[1:26:32] That's what religion does. moves God
[1:26:34] fars away and puts you on a difficult
[1:26:36] road to get to God.
[1:26:39] But what the message did is taken the
[1:26:40] veil away and show what God always
[1:26:42] wanted was to dwell with you. God, what
[1:26:44] God wants to do is share your life with
[1:26:47] you.
[1:26:49] He wants to live in you, walk in you,
[1:26:51] fellowship with you, talk with you,
[1:26:53] share your life with you. Amen.
[1:26:58] Brother Benham
[1:27:00] said God wants to be manifest in you. He
[1:27:04] says, "How are you going to do it? Call
[1:27:05] him down from heaven?" He said, "No,
[1:27:07] he's in you."
[1:27:10] He said, "If I can just get myself out
[1:27:11] of the way,
[1:27:15] he can come and do things that William
[1:27:16] Brenham's never even thought of."
[1:27:20] So, Brother Bram said, "If I can get
[1:27:21] myself out of the
[1:27:23] way, God can come and do
[1:27:27] things with me out of the way." All
[1:27:30] right, we got this concept. So now
[1:27:32] that's you and I. If we can get
[1:27:34] ourselves out of the way, God can do
[1:27:36] something that we never thought of. So
[1:27:38] if I get myself out of the way, who is
[1:27:41] God going to use to do the thing I've
[1:27:44] never thought of? He's going to use me.
[1:27:48] So he doesn't need me, but he needs me.
[1:27:51] So when I get out of the way, he can use
[1:27:53] me to do what I can't do. He can do, but
[1:27:56] he can't do it without me. So he's going
[1:27:58] to do it through me, but he doesn't want
[1:28:00] me. So when I can get rid of me, then he
[1:28:02] can use me.
[1:28:05] You see why we're a walking paradox. You
[1:28:07] see why sometimes we don't understand
[1:28:08] ourselves. You see why sometimes it's
[1:28:10] our thought. Sometimes it's God's
[1:28:12] thought and sometimes we don't know. Was
[1:28:13] that of the Lord or was that of me?
[1:28:14] Amen. It's the same thing. It's always
[1:28:16] been the same thing. Brother Bam said,
[1:28:18] "I don't even understand myself."
[1:28:21] He has a thought. Brother Bam tells us.
[1:28:22] He's so honest with us. He says, "No, I
[1:28:24] I thought that." I thought, "Well," he
[1:28:26] heard a voice. He said, "Well, that
[1:28:27] might just be me." Yeah. And it was God
[1:28:30] speaking to him in a storm in Colorado
[1:28:32] to come back and do the storm. And he
[1:28:33] said, "That might have just been me."
[1:28:35] And so he had to wait and he had to make
[1:28:36] sure.
[1:28:38] Why? Because he was a man and God was
[1:28:40] dwelling in the man and using the man.
[1:28:43] And sometimes it was the man and
[1:28:44] sometimes it was God.
[1:28:48] Brother Random comes through the pullpit
[1:28:49] and he and he makes a statement about
[1:28:50] Martin Luther King Jr. and he talks
[1:28:52] about I he's going to lead a million of
[1:28:55] those people to death. Amen. That week
[1:28:58] in the in the grocery store, one of the
[1:29:00] sisters in the church goes up to brother
[1:29:02] Bam said, "Brother Bam, that's so sad.
[1:29:04] All those poor, precious black people
[1:29:05] are going to be killed like that."
[1:29:07] Brother Brandham comes back the next
[1:29:09] Sunday and he said, "Listen, I said
[1:29:11] that." He said, "Now, that's just my
[1:29:13] opinion."
[1:29:15] That's what he said. He goes, "God never
[1:29:17] told me that. I don't know that that's
[1:29:19] true. That's just my opinion."
[1:29:22] And then he says, "You have to know when
[1:29:24] it's the Lord and you have to know when
[1:29:26] it's me."
[1:29:27] And then I said, 'Well, how in the world
[1:29:29] am I going to do that? Seems unfair. But
[1:29:32] Brother Benham's giving us a principle.
[1:29:34] He's showing us that listen, he was a
[1:29:37] human being. He was a sinborn flawed man
[1:29:40] who could get the wrong thought, the
[1:29:42] wrong idea, go in the wrong direction,
[1:29:43] make the wrong decision.
[1:29:46] And he
[1:29:47] did. Yeah, but he was also the vessel
[1:29:51] that God was going to manifest his word
[1:29:53] for. He was also the word made flesh. He
[1:29:56] was also on partnership with God. He was
[1:29:59] also the final voice. Amen. In the final
[1:30:01] age, he was he was the seventh angel,
[1:30:03] the last angel's message. Amen. He was
[1:30:06] the one that God was going to use to
[1:30:08] finish out the church ages.
[1:30:12] You saying he was the seventh angel? He
[1:30:14] was the seventh angel. But brother
[1:30:15] Benham said Christ was the seventh
[1:30:16] angel. That's right. Amen. He said he
[1:30:19] was the messenger to the church age.
[1:30:20] Amen. So who was the messenger of the
[1:30:22] church age? Christ or William Brandham?
[1:30:24] And the answer is yes. It was Christ in
[1:30:27] William Brandham.
[1:30:30] Listen, when brother Brandham told us
[1:30:31] who the other six messengers were, he
[1:30:33] didn't he didn't go and say, "Okay, the
[1:30:35] first messenger, that's Christ." No, he
[1:30:38] said Paul.
[1:30:40] But it was Christ and Paul. Paul was on
[1:30:42] partnership.
[1:30:44] Remember Paul, Amen, was persecuting the
[1:30:47] church. He was running them into prison.
[1:30:49] He was scattering them all over. Amen.
[1:30:51] He was wreaking havoc on the church of
[1:30:52] God. That's what the Bible says. He was
[1:30:54] wreaking havoc on the church of God. And
[1:30:56] then one day, God was going to interrupt
[1:30:58] his plan because God had a plan for
[1:31:01] Saul. Yes. He was part of his
[1:31:03] predestinated plan. He was going to be
[1:31:05] part of the program. And no matter what
[1:31:07] he was doing now, didn't change what God
[1:31:09] had already foresaw. That's right. Then
[1:31:12] he comes to Ananas and he says, "I I
[1:31:14] want you to go to Paul first." He smites
[1:31:15] him down on the road to Damascus and he
[1:31:17] gives him a tremendous revelation. He
[1:31:19] said, "Why are you persecuting me?" And
[1:31:21] he said, "Uh, who are you, Lord?" He's
[1:31:23] looking at a pillar of fire, not a human
[1:31:26] body. He's looking at a pillar of fire.
[1:31:28] And the pillar of fire speaks and said,
[1:31:29] "Why do you persecute me?" He said, "Who
[1:31:31] are you, Lord?" He said, "I'm Jesus whom
[1:31:34] you persecute."
[1:31:36] Who was he persecuting? He was
[1:31:38] persecuting the church of Jesus. So when
[1:31:41] he was persecuting the church, Jesus
[1:31:43] says, "That's who I am.
[1:31:47] I am those people. They're on
[1:31:50] partnership with me. When you haul them
[1:31:52] to prison, you're taking me to prison."
[1:31:56] When you persecute them, you persecute
[1:31:58] me. Because I'm dwelling in them.
[1:32:04] So then he smitt and blind. Ananas has
[1:32:06] to come to him. And Ananas said, "How,
[1:32:08] Lord? How how can we do this? Don't you
[1:32:10] know?" I love when people says that. You
[1:32:13] know, he didn't say, "Don't you know,"
[1:32:15] but he says, "I've heard many things
[1:32:18] about this Saul, how he's done this and
[1:32:20] this." Like he's teaching God
[1:32:23] something. And God says, "He's a chosen
[1:32:26] vessel."
[1:32:28] Hallelujah.
[1:32:30] He's a chosen vessel. And I've already
[1:32:32] decided what works he's going to do.
[1:32:34] He's going to take this light and he's
[1:32:36] going to shine it to the Gentiles and to
[1:32:38] kings. Amen. He comes and he gives him
[1:32:41] the commission and sends him off. You
[1:32:43] know what Paul says of
[1:32:44] himself? He said, "I am a light to the
[1:32:47] Gentiles."
[1:32:48] That's a prophecy out of Isaiah. You
[1:32:50] know who that prophecy applies to? Jesus
[1:32:53] Christ.
[1:32:55] But Paul said, Paul didn't say Jesus is.
[1:32:58] He said, "I am." Well, who's the eye?
[1:33:02] Was it the man or was it Christ in the
[1:33:04] man?
[1:33:08] God is on partnership with man.
[1:33:11] The message didn't go to the Gentiles
[1:33:14] until Paul carried it to the Gentiles.
[1:33:18] Paul had to stand. Paul had to open his
[1:33:21] mouth. Paul had to speak. Paul had to be
[1:33:23] willing to be stoned. And Paul, after he
[1:33:25] was stoned, had to get up. And Paul had
[1:33:28] to make the choice to walk back in
[1:33:30] again. Amen.
[1:33:32] That was Paul's part.
[1:33:35] All the supernatural, all the
[1:33:36] revelation, all the truth that was
[1:33:38] revealed, that was God's part.
[1:33:41] But
[1:33:43] Paul, Paul had to get on a boat.
[1:33:49] He had to brave storms. Paul had to get
[1:33:52] seasick.
[1:33:55] Paul had to walk.
[1:33:57] Paul had to stand. Paul had to talk.
[1:34:01] God supplied the anointing. God supplied
[1:34:03] the words. God supplied the revelation.
[1:34:06] God supplied the supernatural.
[1:34:09] But Paul had to carry it to the people.
[1:34:20] Praise God.
[1:34:24] Jesus says this, "Believest thou not
[1:34:26] that I am in the Father, and the Father
[1:34:28] in me? The words that I speak unto you,
[1:34:30] I speak not of myself, but the father
[1:34:32] that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
[1:34:35] Amen.
[1:34:38] Jesus never took credit for the works.
[1:34:41] He said it was the father that dwells in
[1:34:43] him. But what did the apostle say? The
[1:34:46] apostle says Jesus Christ went about
[1:34:48] doing
[1:34:49] miracles. Who was
[1:34:52] it? It was God in a body of flesh. Amen.
[1:34:57] Let's look at this quote
[1:34:59] together. Souls that are in prison. He
[1:35:01] says, "So therefore, he has
[1:35:04] partnershipped, you see, and taken this
[1:35:07] man earthly and this eternal spirit and
[1:35:10] put it together because God reflected
[1:35:13] himself back in that that he became a
[1:35:15] man when he became Christ Jesus." And he
[1:35:18] was God. See, God was in Christ that see
[1:35:20] lived in him reconciling the world to
[1:35:22] himself. And through that perfect man,
[1:35:25] each one of us imperfect that believe in
[1:35:27] God and has accepted that becomes the
[1:35:30] perfection of him. Amen. He has
[1:35:33] partnershipped. He's taken man earthly
[1:35:36] and his eternal spirit and now he's put
[1:35:39] it together in
[1:35:43] partnership. I want to look at the
[1:35:45] Virgin
[1:35:47] Mary. Luke 1:26. And in the sixth month,
[1:35:50] the angel Gabriel was sent from God into
[1:35:52] a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a
[1:35:54] virgin espouseed to a man whose name was
[1:35:56] Joseph of the house of David. And the
[1:35:58] virgin's name was Mary. And the angel
[1:36:01] came in unto her and said, "Hail thou
[1:36:03] that are highly favored. The Lord is
[1:36:05] with thee. Blessed art thou among
[1:36:07] women."
[1:36:08] God comes through Gabriel the angel and
[1:36:11] he tells Mary, "Listen, you're highly
[1:36:16] favored." Not because you've done
[1:36:19] something, right? But because you're
[1:36:21] chosen,
[1:36:24] it wasn't Mary's good works that got her
[1:36:26] this declaration.
[1:36:28] It wasn't because she was performing on
[1:36:30] such a level.
[1:36:33] No, she was highly favored before she
[1:36:36] did anything
[1:36:38] because she was part of God's
[1:36:40] predestinated plan. When God spoke the
[1:36:42] words through Isaiah that a virgin shall
[1:36:44] conceive, he already in his mind knew
[1:36:45] who the virgin was. She was chosen
[1:36:49] before the foundation of the world. God
[1:36:51] knew all his works from the beginning.
[1:36:53] Amen. He knew all that he would do. The
[1:36:55] works were finished from the beginning.
[1:36:57] He knew it was going to be Mary. Amen.
[1:36:59] So he come to Mary and he told her this
[1:37:01] is time for the prophecy to be fulfilled
[1:37:03] and it'll be fulfilled in
[1:37:05] you. A virgin shall
[1:37:08] conceive. You know her first response is
[1:37:11] how can this be? I don't know a man. She
[1:37:15] has a similar response to Moses and her
[1:37:19] response is I can't do what you're
[1:37:21] asking me to do. Yeah, you say this is
[1:37:24] who I am. But h if if I am that, how am
[1:37:28] I going to do that? And he says, don't
[1:37:31] worry, the Holy Ghost will overshadow
[1:37:32] you and the thing that will be formed in
[1:37:34] you will be the son of the most high.
[1:37:35] And she says, okay, yeah, I can't do it,
[1:37:38] but if you do it, that's fine.
[1:37:42] So, you see the partnership and the free
[1:37:46] moral agency. God could not violate her
[1:37:49] choice. He couldn't bring the immaculate
[1:37:52] conception until she surrendered to it.
[1:37:54] But she could never produce the word
[1:37:56] unless God produced it in her. Amen. She
[1:37:59] had no power, no ability. She couldn't
[1:38:01] do it. But listen, if her disbelieving
[1:38:04] the angel's message about her, she would
[1:38:06] have turned and walked away. And God
[1:38:08] would never violate his own free moral
[1:38:10] agency. If she disbelieved, I can't be.
[1:38:12] I'm not worthy. I don't come up from a
[1:38:14] special family. You need to listen. Go
[1:38:17] find the the daughter of the high
[1:38:18] priest. I can't do it. and turns and
[1:38:20] walks away. God is not going to force
[1:38:22] himself on Mary.
[1:38:25] She has to agree with the word.
[1:38:28] She has to believe the word and she has
[1:38:31] to surrender to the word.
[1:38:34] To me, this is what's so detrimental to
[1:38:36] the children of God, not accepting what
[1:38:38] the prophet says about them. Amen. It's
[1:38:41] hindering the whole program. That's
[1:38:43] right. Yes, we're weak. Yes, we don't
[1:38:47] know nothing. Yes, we're incapable.
[1:38:49] Absolutely. Yes. We're as common as
[1:38:51] common or below average. Amen. In many
[1:38:54] cases, we have failed. We have messed
[1:38:57] up. We have misunderstood. We have done
[1:38:59] all of the above multiple times. Amen.
[1:39:03] But that doesn't change the fact if
[1:39:04] you're part of God's program, you're
[1:39:06] part of God's program. And if long as
[1:39:08] we're not doing what the Holy Ghost
[1:39:09] moves us to do, then we're paralyzing
[1:39:11] God's program because he's not going to
[1:39:13] get somebody else to do it. And this is
[1:39:15] what the prophet says about us. And many
[1:39:18] of us hear it and hear it and hear it
[1:39:20] and we walk away feeling like nothing,
[1:39:21] like we're worthless, like we're no
[1:39:23] good. Listen, being humble is good. But
[1:39:26] denying the power of God to do something
[1:39:28] in your life is wrong.
[1:39:30] To deny the word access, to deny that
[1:39:33] he's got the power to make the change is
[1:39:35] not right.
[1:39:38] Because God's a gentleman still and he's
[1:39:41] not going to force himself.
[1:39:43] He's waiting for somebody to say, "I
[1:39:46] accept it. Amen. I believe it. Be it
[1:39:50] unto me according to your
[1:39:53] word." So Mary
[1:39:57] now, she's going to enter into this
[1:40:00] partnership with
[1:40:02] God. And I love this so much, friends,
[1:40:06] because God chose to work through man.
[1:40:07] He does nothing through man.
[1:40:11] He does what Mary cannot do
[1:40:14] and he provides a miracle in her womb.
[1:40:19] He brings the form of a
[1:40:21] baby as a
[1:40:26] cell and then Mary has to carry
[1:40:29] it. Listen, I I'm going to say
[1:40:32] something. Just bear with
[1:40:34] me. God didn't carry Jesus. Mary did.
[1:40:39] Amen.
[1:40:42] Mary gave her body.
[1:40:47] Mary got cravings.
[1:40:51] Mary ate food and the food she ate
[1:40:56] became Jesus's body. Amen.
[1:41:02] It was Mary who would lose sleep because
[1:41:06] she was uncomfortable. Yeah, it was Mary
[1:41:08] who got to the place where she couldn't
[1:41:10] roll over at night. It was Mary who
[1:41:13] would get a stiff kick and have to run
[1:41:15] to the
[1:41:17] bathroom. She was a human. This happened
[1:41:21] in a regular human person, just like you
[1:41:24] and me.
[1:41:27] It was Mary who had shortness of breath
[1:41:30] when she laid down because the baby was
[1:41:31] compressing her lungs.
[1:41:35] God was on partnership with man to
[1:41:38] produce himself on the earth. Amen.
[1:41:44] Mary had to take the reproach. Mary had
[1:41:46] to deal with the rumors.
[1:41:50] Mary had to feel the gaze as she went
[1:41:52] through the market. Amen. The judgmental
[1:41:55] gaze. That was her part. Yes. Not God's
[1:41:58] part. That was her
[1:42:00] part. Because in a partnership,
[1:42:02] everybody plays their
[1:42:07] part. When it came time to deliver,
[1:42:09] there was a
[1:42:10] prophecy that Jesus had to be born in
[1:42:15] Bethlehem. Mary may not have even
[1:42:17] realized it. Joseph might have been
[1:42:19] blind to
[1:42:20] it. So, God did the part Mary couldn't
[1:42:23] do or didn't know to do. He rearranged
[1:42:25] the whole government of the world to
[1:42:28] bring a taxation and a census so that
[1:42:31] Joseph and Mary at the worst possible
[1:42:34] time
[1:42:36] had to go all the way from Nazareth down
[1:42:38] to Bethlehem. God did that.
[1:42:41] But God didn't walk to
[1:42:43] Bethlehem. Mary and Joseph did.
[1:42:50] God's feet didn't get tired.
[1:42:53] Mary and Joseph did
[1:42:57] fulfilling the
[1:42:59] word. When it came time for the baby to
[1:43:02] be
[1:43:03] delivered, God's not the one who
[1:43:07] pushed. Mary did.
[1:43:16] God wants to work through human beings.
[1:43:20] And it's way more simple than we ever
[1:43:23] thought.
[1:43:25] Way more real than we ever give credit
[1:43:28] for. It's not a fairy tale. That's
[1:43:31] right. It's not a Sunday school book.
[1:43:33] Amen. It's the reality of giving your
[1:43:37] flesh for him to live in. Amen. to give
[1:43:42] your flesh for the word to be made
[1:43:44] manifest. It's real.
[1:43:47] It's not a story. It's not a future
[1:43:50] event. It's partnership with God.
[1:43:59] and go awake Jesus. He
[1:44:02] says, "May as they pass through this
[1:44:05] line and we lay our hands upon them, may
[1:44:08] they recognize it's just not just going
[1:44:10] by man, but God and man as one." He's
[1:44:13] talking about a prayer line. God has
[1:44:16] come into man and God does nothing apart
[1:44:18] from man. That's what he does. His work
[1:44:21] is through man. He made man his partner.
[1:44:25] Amen. When Jesus stood and looked upon
[1:44:27] the harvest, he said, 'The harvest is
[1:44:29] ripe, the labors are few. Pray the Lord
[1:44:31] of the harvest. And he was the Lord of
[1:44:33] the harvest. In other words, ask me to
[1:44:35] do what I know is right to
[1:44:38] do. But he had connected himself with
[1:44:41] the disciples. They was the one to ask.
[1:44:46] Listen, this is amazing to me that
[1:44:48] Jesus, this whole dialogue, we've talked
[1:44:50] about it before, but he looks out and
[1:44:52] sees the need of the people and he says,
[1:44:54] "Behold, the harvest is white and the
[1:44:57] harvest, the the crop. Pray to the Lord
[1:44:59] of the harvest that he'll send labors."
[1:45:01] Brother Bram said he was the Lord of the
[1:45:03] harvest. And he saw, but he was teaching
[1:45:05] them that God does nothing without man.
[1:45:07] God wasn't going to move until somebody
[1:45:10] on the earth recognized the need and
[1:45:12] somebody prayed.
[1:45:14] And he was teaching them a lesson
[1:45:16] because Jesus was not going to remain on
[1:45:19] the earth. He was going to leave. And
[1:45:22] now the representation of God on the
[1:45:24] earth was going to be his disciples. And
[1:45:25] they were the ones who were going to
[1:45:27] have to see. They were the ones who were
[1:45:28] going to have to recognize. And they
[1:45:30] were the ones who were going to have to
[1:45:31] ask.
[1:45:35] Jesus said, "It'll come where you're not
[1:45:36] asking me, but you'll pray directly to
[1:45:38] the father in my name." Amen.
[1:45:41] because he has no eyes but yours. He has
[1:45:44] no ears but yours, no hands but yours,
[1:45:46] no mouth but yours. Who's supposed to be
[1:45:49] doing the interceding now? Who's
[1:45:51] supposed to be doing the praying now?
[1:45:53] Who's on earth to see what the needs
[1:45:55] are? Who's supposed to ask now?
[1:45:59] God's in partnership with man. He's got
[1:46:01] his agents on the earth and they see the
[1:46:03] need. They recognize the need. and they
[1:46:05] start going and asking, "Father, in the
[1:46:07] name of Jesus Christ, I see this need
[1:46:09] and I'm asking you to meet this need cuz
[1:46:11] I don't have the power to do it, but I
[1:46:12] recognize it, God, and it needs to be
[1:46:14] done. And would you send the power to do
[1:46:16] it? Would you solve this problem?" Amen.
[1:46:17] It's not somebody else doing it. It's
[1:46:20] God's agency on the earth that's doing
[1:46:22] it now. When Jesus was here, he was
[1:46:25] doing the praying. When he's gone, it's
[1:46:27] our job to do the praying. Amen. Thank
[1:46:30] you, Lord. Because it's him and us.
[1:46:32] Amen. It's partnership with God. Praise
[1:46:35] God.
[1:46:38] Amen.
[1:46:40] You know what I think it is? It's so
[1:46:42] much simpler than we thought. That's
[1:46:45] right. But it's so much heavier than we
[1:46:48] ever
[1:46:48] realized. The level of personal
[1:46:51] responsibility is
[1:46:53] great, but the truth is so tremendous
[1:46:57] that it's shocking.
[1:47:00] We can't go on being children and
[1:47:01] playing games all the time. We've got to
[1:47:04] recognize what hour we live in and what
[1:47:07] partnership with man really is. It's God
[1:47:11] dwelling in
[1:47:14] us. In the message
[1:47:17] desperation, brother Ram said the token
[1:47:20] is the token. Yes, sir. It's you and
[1:47:22] Christ as persons together.
[1:47:26] You and Christ as persons together.
[1:47:29] That's this great token. Brother said
[1:47:31] the token couldn't be preached till
[1:47:32] after the seals. Why? Because the Holy
[1:47:34] Ghost was bound up by these
[1:47:35] denominational rivers. But now the token
[1:47:37] is the literal life of Christ. Now come
[1:47:40] back into a people. And the token is
[1:47:43] Christ, you and Christ as persons
[1:47:47] together.
[1:47:49] Union, invisible union, unity,
[1:47:53] partnership, co-workers, Christ in you.
[1:47:56] He's doing the thing you can't do and
[1:47:59] you're doing the part he can't do.
[1:48:05] Like, what do you mean, brother Chad?
[1:48:08] Listen, I I hope you don't think I'm I'm
[1:48:10] crazy. I hope it's just sinking in.
[1:48:15] That Jesus in his earthly form, he's
[1:48:18] done his job as as Jesus of Nazareth.
[1:48:21] He's gone. He He's not coming back until
[1:48:24] he sets up his throne as the kingdom of
[1:48:26] David in the millennium. Amen. But now
[1:48:29] he works in and through his people,
[1:48:30] through his bride. Amen. So if God wants
[1:48:35] to shine the light of his gospel to the
[1:48:37] person in the cubicle next to you,
[1:48:42] how's he going to get there?
[1:48:46] It's got to be through partnership with
[1:48:47] you.
[1:48:49] Amen.
[1:48:51] You've got to wake up in the morning,
[1:48:53] brush your teeth, get dressed, go to
[1:48:55] work, and do a good job
[1:48:57] so that you can stay there. Because
[1:49:00] that's where God wants you. Because he's
[1:49:02] partnershiping with you to shine a light
[1:49:04] out to those that are around you.
[1:49:07] Because that's the only way he can do it
[1:49:08] now is when he does it in you.
[1:49:12] It's more real. It's more everyday. It's
[1:49:14] more genuine. It's closer to us than we
[1:49:17] ever thought. That's right.
[1:49:20] Amen. It's all around us. It's in us and
[1:49:23] all over us every moment of the day.
[1:49:29] This mystery of God is going on all
[1:49:31] around us.
[1:49:35] Look in the rising of the
[1:49:38] sun says, "The true Easter seal has
[1:49:42] broke death from around me and I'm
[1:49:45] alive." The Easter seal at the beginning
[1:49:47] broke the seal of the Roman seal. the
[1:49:49] Easter seal that that was sealed up and
[1:49:51] man when they died was gone. But he
[1:49:53] broke the seal and revealed the secret.
[1:49:55] And now God by his Holy Spirit has broke
[1:49:58] the seal from around our lives and
[1:50:00] Christ is revealed as he lives in us.
[1:50:02] For now we are quickened with him.
[1:50:05] Hallelujah. Let this seal be broken.
[1:50:08] Whatever sealed him from our
[1:50:10] understanding, let that seal be broken
[1:50:13] and realize where he is. Amen. The Holy
[1:50:15] Ghost broke the seal from around our
[1:50:18] lives and from the around our lives, the
[1:50:20] veil that hid Christ. And Christ is
[1:50:22] revealed in us. Amen.
[1:50:25] Praise God. Mary was on partnership with
[1:50:28] God.
[1:50:31] She's the one who delivered Jesus.
[1:50:36] And I know our minds we can say, "But it
[1:50:38] was God who helped." Absolutely. It's
[1:50:40] the same one who helps you deliver your
[1:50:41] babies. Amen.
[1:50:45] Amen.
[1:50:49] But where did Jesus get nourishment when
[1:50:52] he was three hours old?
[1:50:59] God didn't send an angel from heaven
[1:51:01] with a wafer
[1:51:03] and
[1:51:04] mana. It wasn't a supernatural
[1:51:10] way that he was fed.
[1:51:13] It was a human life. That's right. He
[1:51:15] had to eat to grow. There's only one
[1:51:18] thing he could eat.
[1:51:21] Jesus, God made in the flesh. Jehovah in
[1:51:24] a
[1:51:25] manger. How did he get his
[1:51:28] nourishment? Because he was on
[1:51:30] partnership with
[1:51:33] Mary. And Mary had to nurse that baby.
[1:51:38] Mary had to wash that baby and clothe
[1:51:42] that baby. Mary taught him to walk.
[1:51:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:51] What does God want us to do with the
[1:51:52] word? He wants us to give our life to
[1:51:54] it. He wants us to nourish it. He wants
[1:51:56] us to carry it. He wants us to care for
[1:51:57] it. He wants us to surrender to it. He
[1:51:59] wants us to give our lives.
[1:52:03] We keep waiting for supernatural things
[1:52:05] to happen. Listen, we missing it.
[1:52:09] The supernatural has happened. He's
[1:52:12] brought back the word. Amen. The
[1:52:14] headship has come down. The seals are
[1:52:16] off. He's done the supernatural. And
[1:52:17] then he's done the supernatural in your
[1:52:19] life when he's quickened, the sieging by
[1:52:20] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. The
[1:52:22] supernatural has happened. Quit waiting
[1:52:24] for the supernatural. Just let him live
[1:52:26] in the natural
[1:52:29] because that's where he's dwelling.
[1:52:30] That's where he's manifesting himself.
[1:52:32] That's where this word, that's where the
[1:52:34] flesh is becoming word and the word is
[1:52:36] becoming flesh. When you wake up in the
[1:52:38] morning and brush your teeth and comb
[1:52:40] your hair, put on your boots and go to
[1:52:41] work, the word is becoming flesh and the
[1:52:44] flesh is becoming word. Amen.
[1:52:47] As we
[1:52:48] become his
[1:52:51] body, living what kind of
[1:52:54] life? This is why I want to go all the
[1:52:57] way back to the beginning of the sermon.
[1:52:58] I want to end where we started.
[1:53:03] Now you just be real steady.
[1:53:06] Amen. Something has happened.
[1:53:10] Prophecy has been fulfilled. Something
[1:53:12] supernatural is taking place. A
[1:53:14] monumental shift has happened. Now you
[1:53:17] just be real steady. And go on as you
[1:53:20] are. Amen. Don't change nothing. Yes,
[1:53:23] sir. If he wants you to know anything,
[1:53:25] he'll reveal it to you. That's right.
[1:53:26] Amen. If you're supposed to do anything
[1:53:29] different than what you're doing, he'll
[1:53:31] reveal it to
[1:53:32] you. I I've been born again. I I
[1:53:36] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:53:37] What should I do tomorrow?
[1:53:39] Brush your teeth.
[1:53:41] Comb your hair. Put on your boots and go
[1:53:45] to work.
[1:53:48] But surely, no. He wants to live in you.
[1:53:52] He wants to dwell in you. He wants to go
[1:53:55] to work with you.
[1:53:59] No way. You mean he wants to go to that
[1:54:02] factory? You mean he wants to be covered
[1:54:04] in grease and gr? Yes.
[1:54:06] God wants to go to work with you. God
[1:54:09] wants to clean house with you.
[1:54:12] That's why don't put God far off.
[1:54:16] Remember what we talked about Wednesday.
[1:54:18] The fellowship that God desired. God
[1:54:20] wanted fellowship with man. And the
[1:54:22] fellowship wasn't complicated
[1:54:23] fellowship. It wasn't God saying, "Have
[1:54:25] you understood the molecular makeup of
[1:54:27] blah blah blah today?" No, we come down
[1:54:30] in the cool of the evening where his
[1:54:31] children. He says,
[1:54:32] "Children, have you enjoyed my creation?
[1:54:36] Have you enjoyed your day upon the earth
[1:54:37] today? Listen, you can fold laundry and
[1:54:41] be in fellowship with God.
[1:54:44] You can punch out. You can stand at a
[1:54:46] stamping mill all day long chunk chunk
[1:54:50] chunk and your mind can be on God and
[1:54:52] your praise can be in your lips and you
[1:54:53] can be fellowshipping God all day long.
[1:54:57] Don't put him somewhere else. Don't put
[1:54:59] him in the church.
[1:55:02] Amen. Don't put him in a fellowship or a
[1:55:04] group or a doctrine. Don't hem him in
[1:55:06] there. He's in you.
[1:55:09] He wants to dwell with you. What What is
[1:55:12] the token? It's you and Christ as
[1:55:14] persons together. He wants to share your
[1:55:16] life. He wants to be whatever you are.
[1:55:19] If you're a mechanic, he wants to be a
[1:55:21] mechanic.
[1:55:23] What do you mean? Did not God place that
[1:55:25] attribute of himself in you? And did he
[1:55:28] not look for generations over certain
[1:55:30] ingredients he had to get in you to make
[1:55:32] the tabernacle just right to express
[1:55:34] this life inside? And didn't he give you
[1:55:36] your job? And didn't he give you your
[1:55:37] talents? And didn't he place you where
[1:55:39] you're at? Yes, sir. Didn't he call you
[1:55:43] by this gospel? And didn't he birth you
[1:55:45] by his own spirit? Amen. Is he as he are
[1:55:48] you not born again by the spirit of God?
[1:55:50] Is he not dwelling in you? Then if God
[1:55:52] made you the way you are and God placed
[1:55:54] you where you're working and God dwells
[1:55:56] in you, guess where God wants to go
[1:55:58] Monday?
[1:56:00] He wants to go wherever you go.
[1:56:03] He wants to see whatever you see. He
[1:56:05] wants to touch whatever you touch.
[1:56:09] This message came to take the veil off
[1:56:14] and it came to bring us rest
[1:56:17] because the whole Christian experience
[1:56:19] is based on rest.
[1:56:21] I'm not climbing somewhere. I'm not
[1:56:23] climbing a ladder to find God. I'm not
[1:56:25] going through hoops. I'm not trying to
[1:56:26] memorize doctrine. I'm
[1:56:29] not. God just wants us to wake up to the
[1:56:32] fact that he wants to share your life
[1:56:35] with you and he wants to share his life
[1:56:38] with you so that you'll realize under
[1:56:41] the revelation that it's I in you and
[1:56:44] you and me. Amen. And we stop putting
[1:56:48] him far away.
[1:56:50] We stop waiting to pray. We stop waiting
[1:56:54] for fellowship. and we start becoming
[1:56:57] what he wants us to
[1:56:59] be so that we can just
[1:57:02] be
[1:57:05] normal. What is what does God want?
[1:57:10] He wants you to be normal. Amen. I don't
[1:57:13] mean worldly standards normal. But he
[1:57:16] made you a human and he wants to live in
[1:57:19] human flesh and he wants you to be a
[1:57:22] normal human.
[1:57:25] I'll ask you this. Do you think Jesus
[1:57:28] when he was here had a favorite food?
[1:57:33] Do you think there's something he liked
[1:57:34] the taste of better than something else?
[1:57:39] Because God wanted to be in flesh. He
[1:57:42] wanted to live in
[1:57:43] flesh. Don't make it, you see, if we
[1:57:46] make it too supernatural, then we we we
[1:57:50] distance ourselves so far away from it,
[1:57:52] we don't realize how close it is. bless.
[1:57:56] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. God tasted
[1:57:59] food in Jesus
[1:58:01] Christ.
[1:58:08] Jesus Jesus may have had a favorite
[1:58:15] place, a place he liked better than
[1:58:17] another place.
[1:58:19] He may have had a preference. He may
[1:58:22] have had a taste.
[1:58:25] You understand? He was a
[1:58:27] human so much more like you and I than
[1:58:30] we realize.
[1:58:32] So what does he want us to be? Just be
[1:58:35] normal.
[1:58:38] What did God want? Why did he make man?
[1:58:40] What was the purpose in making humans to
[1:58:42] begin with? He wanted to dwell on earth
[1:58:46] in flesh as a family of God in
[1:58:49] fellowship with one another.
[1:58:52] And now we've went through a redemption
[1:58:53] cycle because that fell. But God
[1:58:55] redeemed it back. And part of the
[1:58:57] redemption was a sanctification so the
[1:58:59] Holy Spirit could come so God could work
[1:59:01] his way back into man again.
[1:59:05] And he wants to dwell with you. Thank
[1:59:08] you, Lord. Just let him just say, "Okay,
[1:59:12] Lord, if that's what you
[1:59:13] want, I'll sign the
[1:59:17] contract." Now, listen. before I sign
[1:59:20] this. You know that I don't have a good
[1:59:23] memory, right? And you know that I don't
[1:59:26] fully understand all of the Bible. And
[1:59:29] you know that I'm weak. And you know
[1:59:31] that I'm prone to fail. I I just want to
[1:59:33] make that clear, Lord, before I sign
[1:59:35] this contract. And you know I can't
[1:59:37] speak. And and and you you know that I
[1:59:40] can't remember. And and you know that I
[1:59:42] I've I've stumbled around a lot. And you
[1:59:45] know that I'm no
[1:59:46] good. And I can see God saying, "Yeah,
[1:59:49] yeah, yeah. Know all of
[1:59:52] it. But if you still want to be in
[1:59:55] partnership with
[1:59:56] me and you'll do the part that I can't
[2:00:00] do, I will do what I can do."
[2:00:04] I'll sign.
[2:00:07] The partnership.
[2:00:09] Are you ready to sign?
[2:00:12] There's a whole lot of things you can't
[2:00:14] do, but there's a whole lot of things
[2:00:17] you can do.
[2:00:20] You can rub shoulders with the
[2:00:23] world. Jesus can't anymore. Amen.
[2:00:27] You can walk into a grocery store.
[2:00:30] That's right. And your very presence can
[2:00:33] change the atmosphere. That's right.
[2:00:35] Amen. You can go to your family
[2:00:38] gathering and you can dwell there in
[2:00:40] sweetness. Amen. and mellowess
[2:00:43] change the atmosphere.
[2:00:47] You can see the need in your aunt and
[2:00:50] your uncle and your coworker and you can
[2:00:53] pray because of your position to God,
[2:00:55] not their position to God.
[2:00:59] You can
[2:01:00] pray, you can worship, you can sing, you
[2:01:04] can get on a nice suit and tie and come
[2:01:07] to church and show your support for the
[2:01:09] gospel. Praise God. There's a lot of
[2:01:11] things you can't do, but there's a lot
[2:01:12] of things you can do.
[2:01:15] You can speak when God moves in your
[2:01:17] heart to say something to somebody. You
[2:01:18] can open your mouth and say the words.
[2:01:20] He'll supply the anointing, but you have
[2:01:22] to supply the mouth.
[2:01:24] And he'll never go against your free
[2:01:26] moral agency. You can always clam up.
[2:01:29] Amen.
[2:01:31] But this is partnership with God. That's
[2:01:34] what God wants to do. He wants to be a
[2:01:35] co-orker with you in redemption. Are you
[2:01:38] willing to be his
[2:01:40] coworker? He already knows you can't do
[2:01:43] this and you can't do that. So, stop
[2:01:45] telling him what you can't do. I'm think
[2:01:48] he's pretty familiar with your cans.
[2:01:50] Yes, sir.
[2:01:52] He can take care of all of that. But
[2:01:54] there's some things you can do that he
[2:01:57] can no longer do. And he's depending on
[2:01:59] you and I to do it.
[2:02:02] So this great huge lesson, the mystery
[2:02:06] of the seventh seal, the mystery that
[2:02:07] was kept hid for all these generations
[2:02:10] revealed. What is it?
[2:02:13] God wants to share your life. And he
[2:02:17] wants to live in you, every moment of
[2:02:21] the day.
[2:02:23] God wants to commune with you and have
[2:02:24] fellowship with you, work in you, shine
[2:02:27] his light through you. Amen. And there's
[2:02:30] part of this you can't do. Only he can.
[2:02:35] But there's another part only you can
[2:02:38] do.
[2:02:39] Thank you, Lord. I don't know about you,
[2:02:41] but I'm ready to sign on the dotted
[2:02:44] line with a little apprehension like
[2:02:46] Moses had because I know I'm going to
[2:02:48] mess it up. But if God wants me for a
[2:02:50] partner, he can have me for a partner.
[2:02:52] Amen. He He wanted Moses and Moses was a
[2:02:56] failure. He wanted Saul and Saul was
[2:02:58] doing all kinds of Saul things. He
[2:03:01] wanted Peter and Peter, we know how much
[2:03:03] problems Peter had.
[2:03:06] God wanted him for a partner. And when
[2:03:08] they surrendered, God used them. He
[2:03:11] wanted Mary and she was pretty
[2:03:15] incapable. Listen, don't look at
[2:03:17] yourself. Don't look at your
[2:03:18] capabilities. Don't look at none of
[2:03:19] that. Look at the promise. What is he
[2:03:22] telling you? What does he want in this
[2:03:24] hour? And is there something in you can
[2:03:26] say, 'Lord, be it unto me according to
[2:03:28] your word. Lord, help me to surrender to
[2:03:31] that and help me do what the prophet
[2:03:33] said at the opening of the seals, at the
[2:03:36] transition, at the lamb taking the book,
[2:03:39] at the fullness of redemption coming,
[2:03:40] the beginning of his claiming ministry,
[2:03:42] the greatest thing that's happened in
[2:03:44] the gentile dispensation. And he comes
[2:03:46] and says, "Just live a humble, just be
[2:03:49] humble and be a Christian and don't
[2:03:52] figure anything out. Just go on as you
[2:03:54] are and don't change nothing.
[2:03:58] And now at the opening of the seventh
[2:04:00] seal and the realization of who you
[2:04:02] really are, what should I do? If you're
[2:04:04] a farmer, go back to hoing your
[2:04:06] potatoes.
[2:04:08] Because that's where God wants to
[2:04:09] manifest his glory is hoing potatoes.
[2:04:12] Praise God. Amen. He said it can't be. I
[2:04:16] say it is. Yes, sir. That's what the
[2:04:19] prophet said it was, and that's what
[2:04:20] this Bible says it is. Amen. It's that
[2:04:24] simple.
[2:04:26] You know, sometimes the simplest things
[2:04:27] are the hardest ones to receive.
[2:04:30] We like formulas and calculations and we
[2:04:32] like it be super complicated because
[2:04:34] when you go super complicated and get
[2:04:35] way out here in some formula, then you
[2:04:37] realize, well, I can't do that anyway.
[2:04:39] So then I But when it comes down so
[2:04:42] simple, you can't dodge it anymore.
[2:04:46] All we can do is say, "Be it unto me."
[2:04:50] Hallelujah. according to your word.
[2:04:51] Amen. Let's all stand together.
[2:04:53] Musicians, if you could please come,
[2:04:59] I had a brother, a minister brother,
[2:05:01] tell me one time, and it and it was a
[2:05:03] surprise to me the way he said it. He
[2:05:06] said, "You ever notice how you get on
[2:05:07] your knees and you pray for God to do
[2:05:08] something, then you get up and you go do
[2:05:14] it because you're the answer to the
[2:05:16] prayer." Many times, you're the vessel
[2:05:19] he'll use. There's a reason you saw the
[2:05:21] need. There's a reason you had a burden
[2:05:22] for it. You know, sometimes you'll be
[2:05:24] praying for somebody, Lord, just open my
[2:05:25] the eyes of my loved one. Save them. Do
[2:05:27] something. Then all of a sudden, the
[2:05:29] next conversation you have with him, God
[2:05:30] opens your mouth and starts,
[2:05:36] man. God wants to use us.
[2:05:39] We want we want angels to come down and
[2:05:43] we want lightning bolts to come and
[2:05:46] supernatural this and supernatural that.
[2:05:49] But you know what God wants?
[2:05:51] God wants to be a normal human. Amen.
[2:05:59] I could I'm just going to share this
[2:06:02] thought. Just just be patient with me,
[2:06:06] okay? Not for time, but for what I'm
[2:06:08] going to say.
[2:06:12] We want so bad to be supernatural,
[2:06:15] but God wants to be natural. Amen.
[2:06:23] We want to be God, but God wants to be
[2:06:26] you.
[2:06:29] I think we're climbing too high.
[2:06:34] And I think in trying to climb too high,
[2:06:36] we're actually moving away from the
[2:06:38] program. That's right.
[2:06:43] God does supernatural all the time, but
[2:06:46] most of his works just take place in
[2:06:49] daily life.
[2:06:51] Our growth, conversions,
[2:06:54] testimonies, songs, service after
[2:06:58] service after
[2:07:01] service. I think maybe we could climb
[2:07:03] too high and too fast and move right
[2:07:06] past the thing that God's always wanted.
[2:07:08] And what he's always wanted was to live
[2:07:11] in
[2:07:12] humans. What he's always wanted is to
[2:07:15] become a family. His attributes in flesh
[2:07:18] as a family on the earth in fellowship
[2:07:20] with one another. That's pretty
[2:07:23] simple. And we want to be supernatural
[2:07:27] and he wants to be
[2:07:28] natural. And we want to be God and God
[2:07:32] wants to manifest in you through
[2:07:35] everyday life.
[2:07:38] pretty simple,
[2:07:40] pretty profound, pretty deep, pretty
[2:07:45] mesmerizing, somewhat
[2:07:47] overwhelming. And the sense of
[2:07:48] responsibility is heavy.
[2:07:52] But don't worry, you don't do it by
[2:07:54] yourself. Amen. I'll be with you and in
[2:07:57] you to the end of the age. Let's bow our
[2:08:01] heads together and pray. Dear heavenly
[2:08:04] father, we thank you, God.
[2:08:07] God that you have taken so many veils
[2:08:10] away from our
[2:08:12] eyes. Lord, religion has corrupted us
[2:08:15] and polluted us. It has hid your great
[2:08:19] mystery and your
[2:08:21] desire. Lord, it's made things
[2:08:23] unattainable and
[2:08:25] unreachable. God, that was the attempt
[2:08:28] of the enemy.
[2:08:30] But Lord, you and your graciousness has
[2:08:32] sent a message to start tearing down all
[2:08:35] the strongholds of the enemy. That's
[2:08:37] right. To free our minds from wrong
[2:08:40] understanding.
[2:08:42] To give us back the simplicity of the
[2:08:44] gospel. Yes, sir. Where all you wanted
[2:08:46] was to come and dwell with your children
[2:08:48] and ask them how their day was. Yes,
[2:08:50] sir. where your joy was fellowship with
[2:08:53] Adam and his wife in the cool of the
[2:08:56] evening when you asked them how they
[2:08:57] enjoyed the tiger and the flower and the
[2:09:00] sunset and the
[2:09:03] leaves. Oh God, I pray you bring us back
[2:09:06] to that simplicity.
[2:09:09] God, the
[2:09:10] simplicity, Lord, of a teenage
[2:09:13] girl receiving an immaculate conception
[2:09:16] and then living it out naturally day by
[2:09:19] day with cravings, hunger
[2:09:23] pains, Lord, carrying a baby that's
[2:09:26] growing within her day by day, natural
[2:09:28] as natural can be. It was one of the
[2:09:31] most supernatural, profound things that
[2:09:33] was happening on the earth and it was
[2:09:35] taking place so naturally.
[2:09:38] God, I pray that you would help us,
[2:09:41] Lord, to not forget this great picture
[2:09:44] that you've painted for us in the
[2:09:45] reality of our lives and how we're
[2:09:48] linked to you and linked to this promise
[2:09:50] and linked to this hour of
[2:09:53] manifestation. For God, you've placed an
[2:09:55] attribute we want in us and and what you
[2:09:57] want is to bring it to life by your
[2:09:59] spirit. And you want access to us so
[2:10:01] that you can live in us so that that
[2:10:04] attribute of yours can manifest through
[2:10:06] our flesh.
[2:10:08] and manifest you to this
[2:10:11] neighborhood, to this city, to this
[2:10:14] township, to these places that we
[2:10:16] live. God, may it be simple to us.
[2:10:21] May we not complicate it with our own
[2:10:24] complexes and our own understandings and
[2:10:26] our own
[2:10:27] doctrines, but may we come back to the
[2:10:30] heart of what you want. That you want to
[2:10:33] dwell in your people and you've made a
[2:10:36] way in the end time where your full
[2:10:38] measure can be poured back into a people
[2:10:40] on this earth. And that you want that
[2:10:42] full expression through a many membered
[2:10:45] body. And you need us to do the natural
[2:10:48] part.
[2:10:49] You'll do the supernatural, but you need
[2:10:51] us to do the natural. Help us, God, to
[2:10:54] do the natural. We love you. I ask your
[2:10:58] blessing upon this congregation. I ask
[2:11:01] your blessing upon the mothers, Lord,
[2:11:02] that are here. May you give them
[2:11:04] inspiration for you're expressing
[2:11:06] yourself in everyday life as a mother,
[2:11:09] nursing, nurturing, caring for. That's
[2:11:13] you, Lord. That's you behind the veil of
[2:11:16] flesh demonstrating that you're El
[2:11:19] Shadai.
[2:11:20] God, may it not be too complicated. May
[2:11:22] be as simple as changing a diaper and
[2:11:24] feeding a baby and realize that that's
[2:11:27] you expressing
[2:11:28] yourself and that sister. May she go
[2:11:32] from here encouraged, Lord, to manifest
[2:11:34] her portion to do the natural part and
[2:11:37] allow you to do the supernatural part.
[2:11:40] God, may you bless every father. May he
[2:11:42] be Jehovah Gyra to his family. Lord,
[2:11:46] bless every individual. May they become
[2:11:48] your legs, your arms, your feet, your
[2:11:51] mouth, your eyes, and the naturalness of
[2:11:54] life. May it be you behind the veil,
[2:11:56] living the life you always wanted to
[2:11:58] live on this earth. And may you do it in
[2:12:00] us. We love you, God. We ask that you
[2:12:03] would bless us and help us. And may the
[2:12:06] reality of these things, the truth of
[2:12:08] it, Lord, hit deep within us. And may
[2:12:12] all Lord the constraints that's been on
[2:12:14] us fall away and everything we've picked
[2:12:16] up by religion of man and man's
[2:12:18] understanding may it crumble now and
[2:12:21] become ashes at our feet. And may you
[2:12:24] give us freedom and liberty to come into
[2:12:27] this rest to realize how simple, how
[2:12:30] normal, how average you want us to live.
[2:12:34] That's right. We love you, God, and we
[2:12:36] ask for your blessings over all these
[2:12:39] things. In Jesus Christ's name we
[2:12:42] pray.
[2:12:44] Amen. Amen. God bless you all.
[2:12:49] Be it unto
[2:12:53] me
[2:12:54] according to your
[2:12:59] word, according to your promises.
[2:13:06] I can stand
[2:13:10] secure and carve upon my
[2:13:15] heart the truth that sets me
[2:13:21] free according to your word. Oh
[2:13:27] Lord, be it unto me.
[2:13:34] Oh, be it unto
[2:13:39] me according to thy
[2:13:44] word, according to your
[2:13:50] promises. I can stand secure.
[2:13:56] Oh, carve upon my
[2:14:01] heart the truth that sets me
[2:14:06] free. Oh, according to your word, oh
[2:14:13] Lord, lead it unto me.
[2:14:19] Oh,
[2:14:20] thank
[2:14:21] [Music]
[2:14:23] you
[2:14:28] Jesus for the grace that you
[2:14:33] have given us.
[2:14:38] And though I can't repay yet from my
[2:14:42] heart, I'd like to say that
[2:14:48] I thank
[2:14:53] you. Oh,
[2:14:56] thank
[2:14:58] you, Jesus.
[2:15:03] [Music]
[2:15:05] Oh, for the things that you
[2:15:08] have brought me
[2:15:13] through. Though I can't
[2:15:16] repay from my heart, I like to say that
[2:15:24] I I thank you. Oh, sing that verse
[2:15:28] again.
[2:15:30] Oh,
[2:15:32] thank
[2:15:34] you
[2:15:39] Jesus for the things that you
[2:15:44] have brought me
[2:15:48] through. No, I can't
[2:15:51] repay all my heart. I'd like to say that
[2:15:59] I thank
[2:16:02] you.
[2:16:04] Little by
[2:16:07] little, I'm
[2:16:10] changing and I'm
[2:16:13] growing
[2:16:15] little by little.
[2:16:19] And I know that it's
[2:16:24] showing. And I'm not who I'll be. And
[2:16:28] I'm not who I
[2:16:30] was. I'm somewhere in the
[2:16:35] middle. And God is changing me little by
[2:16:42] little.
[2:16:45] Oh,
[2:16:47] little by
[2:16:50] little, I'm
[2:16:53] changing and I'm
[2:16:56] growing.
[2:16:58] Little by
[2:17:01] little. And I know that it's
[2:17:07] showing. And I'm not who
[2:17:09] I And I'm not who I was.
[2:17:14] I'm somewhere in the
[2:17:17] middle. For God is changing
[2:17:22] me little by little.
