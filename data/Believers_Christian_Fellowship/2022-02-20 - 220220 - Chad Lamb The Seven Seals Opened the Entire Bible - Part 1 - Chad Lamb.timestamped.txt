[11:54] for god you have called us and you have
[11:56] given us your word
[11:58] you have drawn us lord to your side
[12:00] but now it's such a privilege for us to
[12:02] lift our voices and praise your name
[12:05] lord as we turn our attention lord to
[12:08] the word this morning we pray that you
[12:09] would come yourself
[12:11] you would take this vessel under your
[12:13] control and that you would break to us
[12:14] the bread of life
[12:16] and we might have the portion that's

[12:31] lord that you would open our hearts to
[12:33] receive the truth that you have in this
[12:35] hour for us that we might be
[12:37] strengthened by that and equipped and we
[12:39] might manifest that truth in this end
[12:41] time and we might be light bearers to
[12:44] the world
[12:45] we give ourselves to you afresh this
[12:46] morning in jesus christ's name we pray
[12:50] amen and god bless you all if you could
[12:53] take your bibles while you're standing
[12:55] and turn
[12:57] with me to the book of luke luke chapter
[13:00] 24.
[13:01] say thank you brother tell us for that
[13:02] song i appreciated it
[13:04] very much it was quite a blessing
[13:07] amen i'd like to
[13:09] um
[13:10] i will read this scripture but i'm going
[13:12] to do a little bit of teaching i think
[13:14] this morning you never know for sure how
[13:16] things were going to go sometimes you
[13:18] get in your mind one way and it goes a
[13:19] different way and that's perfectly fine
[13:21] with me but i'd like to do a little bit
[13:23] of teaching and i've got quite a big
[13:25] subject so i made a powerpoint to keep
[13:27] myself on task and i've got a cutoff
[13:29] point and i'm not going to go i don't
[13:31] want to drag this out i want to be able
[13:33] to capture what we're looking at i want
[13:35] to look at it in detail but i want to
[13:36] get in hit the details and i want to
[13:38] stop and continue on wednesday or sunday
[13:41] so i've told you what my intention are
[13:42] we'll see what happens
[13:45] but it's a good intention
[13:47] but let's look at luke chapter 24
[13:50] verse 25.
[13:52] we know this is the luke 24 is the road
[13:55] to emmaus it begins just above this
[13:57] where two disciples are walking on the
[13:59] road to emmaus and jesus draws near and
[14:01] their eyes are holding they don't know
[14:02] who he is and they begin to tell him
[14:04] about all their troubles and then this
[14:06] is his response in verse 25 then he said
[14:09] unto them o fools and slow of heart to
[14:12] believe all that the prophets have
[14:13] spoken
[14:14] ought not christ to have suffered these
[14:16] things and to enter into his glory
[14:19] and beginning at moses and all the
[14:20] prophets he expounded unto them all the
[14:23] scriptures in all the scriptures the
[14:25] things concerning himself amen god bless
[14:29] you you can be seated
[14:30] but frank if you could help by bringing
[14:32] up that first slide on my powerpoint for
[14:34] me
[14:35] and uh when you look at this road to
[14:37] emmaus now jesus has uh he has been
[14:41] manifest upon the earth he's done what
[14:43] the lord has what the uh god as the
[14:45] father has told him to do he manifests
[14:47] the word amen he was crucified and paid
[14:50] the price of redemption for us and now
[14:52] he is resurrected again but his
[14:54] disciples those who are closest to him
[14:56] have missed what's been happening amen
[14:58] they saw the life they saw the healing
[15:01] they they saw the crucifixion and
[15:03] understood the the you know the capture
[15:06] and the crucifixion and but they're
[15:08] confused about all these events and and
[15:10] so christ draws alongside of them uh and
[15:14] and he comes the other scripture says he
[15:16] come to them in another form amen so in
[15:18] another form he comes to them and he
[15:20] begins to
[15:22] admonish them and rebuke them for not
[15:24] believing all that the scripture sits in
[15:27] they thought they were believing the
[15:28] scriptures but they weren't able to take
[15:31] the current present circumstances and
[15:33] attach it to the scriptures amen so they
[15:35] didn't understand and he begins to
[15:38] admonish them and and verse 27 is the
[15:41] one that interested me the most and
[15:42] beginning at moses and all the prophets
[15:45] he expounded unto them and all the
[15:47] scriptures these things concerning
[15:49] himself
[15:51] what did he do
[15:53] he opened the book
[15:56] he opened to them the scriptures he
[15:58] opened the book and he revealed himself
[16:01] out of the book and they were they were
[16:04] looking at the old testament as books of
[16:06] the bible as a torah as laws and as
[16:10] writings of prophets and as psalms that
[16:12] were written amen by singers they were
[16:14] looking at all of these things but they
[16:16] were missing the whole point of the
[16:18] bible the whole point of the bible was
[16:20] to dare to
[16:21] to declare christ and when christ came
[16:23] he was the declaration of the entire
[16:25] bible
[16:27] and when they missed what was happening
[16:29] he says oh fools and slow of heart to
[16:31] believe all that the prophets have
[16:32] written you believed some but you didn't
[16:34] believe it all and then he begins in all
[16:37] the scriptures i love this
[16:39] and in the beginning at moses
[16:42] and all the scriptures he took them
[16:44] through the entire bible amen
[16:46] and beginning at moses and all the
[16:48] scriptures expounded unto them and all
[16:50] the scriptures the things concerning
[16:53] himself
[16:54] so this morning i'd like to take the
[16:56] seven seals open the entire bible
[17:00] jesus in the road to emmaus opened the
[17:02] entire bible to these
[17:04] to these uh disciples along the way he
[17:07] spoke to them starting at moses and all
[17:09] the scriptures the scriptures concerning
[17:11] himself but but then
[17:13] the bible continued to be written amen
[17:16] we have a new testament that came forth
[17:18] after this and at the end of the new
[17:20] testament we saw that there were seven
[17:22] seals that were sealed amen and there
[17:24] was seven thunders that uttered and john
[17:26] was told to seal them up and not to
[17:27] write them but we know that at the end
[17:30] time these things will be unsealed and
[17:32] so the seven seals opened the entire
[17:35] bible
[17:36] this is taken out of a quote and we'll
[17:38] read that
[17:40] i think next
[17:42] yeah
[17:43] and john looked around and he wept
[17:45] because there was no man even worthy to
[17:47] look on the book and especially open the
[17:49] seals to reveal what the hidden mystery
[17:51] was
[17:52] the mystery was in the seven seals when
[17:55] the seven seals was open that opened up
[17:57] the entire bible that's where we get our
[17:59] title from when the seven seals was
[18:02] opened that opened up the entire bible
[18:04] the seven seals it was sealed with seven
[18:06] mysteries and then these seven seals
[18:08] held the entire mystery of it
[18:12] all right we know this we believe this a
[18:15] lot of this will be reviewed but i i
[18:17] like the review amen
[18:18] but we go back here to the road to
[18:20] emmaus it says in beginning at moses and
[18:23] all the prophecy expounded unto them in
[18:25] all the scriptures the things concerning
[18:27] himself
[18:28] amen and we realize that
[18:30] all that scripture
[18:33] was christ because christ is the word
[18:34] christ is the bible amen and
[18:37] and all of it was pointing to him and
[18:40] every story and every every parable and
[18:42] every type and every shadow was pointing
[18:44] to them and he would go down through the
[18:46] the bible and and maybe he didn't have
[18:48] time to read every verse and every word
[18:51] but he was going down through this is
[18:53] just how i envisioned it he was going
[18:55] down through like brother benham did and
[18:56] he was clipping out clips and showing
[18:58] this is what moses said and this is what
[19:00] jeremiah said remember isaiah and
[19:02] remember joseph and remember
[19:08] remember joseph and do you remember job
[19:10] and do you remember these do you
[19:12] remember these stories amen do you
[19:14] remember hearing them in the synagogue
[19:16] do you remember hearing them amen when
[19:18] you were a child at home amen well that
[19:21] story of joseph was me
[19:27] amen
[19:29] the redeemer job was looking for is me
[19:33] i am the fulfillment of those scriptures
[19:36] and he opened to them amen the entire
[19:38] word and when he opened them to entire
[19:40] word and all the scriptures
[19:43] they all the scriptures were pointing to
[19:44] him
[19:46] and i say that's still true today and so
[19:49] that's what the prophet of god is
[19:50] telling us the mystery was in the seven
[19:53] seals when this these seven seals was
[19:55] opened that opened up the entire bible
[19:58] amen these seven seals held the entire
[20:02] mystery of it so i'm just gonna stick
[20:04] with my powerpoint here hopefully and
[20:08] we'll just keep moving
[20:09] amen and i stood there a little bit
[20:11] until the holy spirit revealed it i said
[20:13] the entire bible as much has been
[20:16] revealed to man through justification
[20:17] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[20:20] ghost the baptism in jesus name and all
[20:22] these things has been revealed but there
[20:25] is a secret that's hid inside because
[20:28] the bible is sealed with seven seals so
[20:30] he said you know you remember junior
[20:33] jackson's dream i go over this all the
[20:34] time but i it just is always striking to
[20:37] me how he's going around the outside
[20:39] interpreting the writing on the outside
[20:40] of the pyramid amen when he gets all of
[20:43] that interpreted
[20:44] amen then he he he reaches up and grabs
[20:47] a sharp object out of the air amen and
[20:50] he cuts the top off and inside is white
[20:53] rock that had never been written on and
[20:55] he's told to go out west to get the
[20:56] revelation for that it's a mystery it's
[20:59] unwritten word it's the seven thunders
[21:01] amen that was was thundered but john
[21:04] said don't write it amen there's nothing
[21:05] written it's unwritten word
[21:09] and he was told to go get that so now
[21:10] brother bam saying we've come through
[21:12] justification sanctification baptism
[21:14] holy ghost he's talking about the
[21:15] restoration of the church the
[21:17] restoration of the bride tree the
[21:18] restoration of the word it's coming back
[21:21] and the bible truths have been coming
[21:23] back through the man age amen but he
[21:25] said
[21:26] but there is secrets that's hid inside
[21:30] because the bible is sealed with seven
[21:32] seals
[21:34] i must go there to find it
[21:36] that morning when those seven angels
[21:38] come down and blasted the earth and the
[21:39] rocks flew every way seven angels stood
[21:42] there and said return back to
[21:43] jeffersonville from where you come from
[21:45] for the seven seals of the seven
[21:47] mysteries
[21:48] will be open
[21:51] revelation 10 7 says but in the days of
[21:53] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[21:55] shall begin to sound the mystery of god
[21:58] should be finished as he had declared to
[22:00] his servants the prophets
[22:02] so you have mysteries and you have the
[22:04] mystery
[22:06] there are many mysteries amen but there
[22:09] is there is a singular mystery of god
[22:12] that's being revealed and in the days of
[22:14] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[22:15] shall begin to sound the mystery of god
[22:18] should be finished as he had declared to
[22:20] his servants the prophets so under the
[22:22] mystery is many mysteries
[22:25] many mysteries point to the mystery
[22:28] and the mystery has many mysteries
[22:32] praise be to god
[22:35] but in christ the mystery of god
[22:36] revealed he says now for a text i want
[22:39] to take out of there this for a text
[22:41] basing it upon the entire bible but i
[22:44] want us to title this christ is the
[22:47] mystery of god revealed
[22:49] christ being the mystery of god revealed
[22:53] so we know that in the days of the voice
[22:55] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[22:57] to sound the mystery of god shall be
[22:59] finished and brother branham comes in
[23:01] july amen of that year
[23:04] july of 1963 and he says for a text i
[23:08] want to take a text from my sermon
[23:10] basing it upon the entire bible because
[23:13] when you open the seals you open the
[23:14] entire bible
[23:17] so now for his text in july 28 in 1963
[23:22] he wants to take for his text based in
[23:24] his text on the entire bible and his
[23:26] text is christ is the mystery of god
[23:29] revealed so what did he base that on he
[23:31] based it on the entire bible
[23:34] so the entire bible is christ the
[23:37] mystery of god revealed
[23:40] and i want to look at this i just want
[23:41] to look at this specifically this
[23:43] morning so don't expect me to cover a
[23:46] lot of ground and go far i'm really kind
[23:48] of just focusing down and honing down
[23:50] and focusing on one point this morning
[23:52] so stay with me on this one point i mean
[23:55] there's so much we could preach on and
[23:56] this you can go in so many avenues your
[23:58] mind can go ahead and get five steps
[24:00] ahead of me but slow down just a minute
[24:02] and stay with me
[24:04] because we know so many of these things
[24:06] and so many of them tied together but i
[24:08] want to look at this specifically and
[24:09] lay a foundation because i'm wanting to
[24:11] build off of this into wednesday and
[24:13] maybe into sunday we'll see
[24:16] so christ is the mystery of god revealed
[24:19] so the revelation of christ
[24:23] in the opening of the word
[24:25] is the fulfillment of revelation 10 7.
[24:29] because christ is the mystery of god
[24:31] revealed and brother branham comes in
[24:33] july and preaches christ is the mystery
[24:35] of god revealed
[24:36] and he bases it on the entire bible
[24:42] in the message it is the rising of the
[24:43] sun he says he is the one who opened
[24:45] those seals
[24:47] he is those seals
[24:49] for the whole word of god
[24:51] is christ and christ is the seals that
[24:54] was opened what is opening of the seals
[24:56] then revealing christ
[24:59] see this is such a wonderful beautiful
[25:01] statement because we can make the seal
[25:03] so many different things and there's so
[25:06] much information in the seals brother
[25:08] branham said i could take one of them
[25:09] seals and preaching around and around
[25:11] that clock i could take a month of
[25:13] services and still not touch it he makes
[25:15] several comments along these lines so
[25:17] you find out there's so much in these
[25:19] seals i don't think we've really begun
[25:22] to understand how much is in the seals
[25:26] i don't know that this life is
[25:27] sufficient
[25:30] but but we keep looking at it we keep
[25:32] focusing on it because this was the
[25:34] capping of brother branham's ministry
[25:35] this was the purpose he was here this is
[25:38] the seventh angels ministry
[25:41] and so we we keep focusing on this
[25:44] what is the opening of the seals then
[25:46] revealing christ so we can look at the
[25:49] seals and go back to the base
[25:52] understanding of the seals and that
[25:54] there is a white horse and what that
[25:55] means and and then a lion anointing and
[25:58] then we could go through all of this
[25:59] information which all of that is
[26:01] critical and all of that is important
[26:03] but we have to realize all of that has
[26:06] to reveal christ
[26:08] because he he's the one who opened the
[26:11] seals he is the seals what is the
[26:14] opening of the seals it's revealing
[26:16] christ so the whole point of the opening
[26:19] of the seals and the preaching of the
[26:21] seals and everything that was preached
[26:22] before leading up to and during and
[26:25] after all of it was to reveal christ and
[26:28] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[26:31] so revelations 10 7 is finished amen
[26:35] under the opening of the seals and the
[26:37] subsequent messages that were preached
[26:39] after that
[26:41] first peter 1 13 says wherefore gird up
[26:44] the loins of your mind be sober and hope
[26:47] to the end for the grace that is to be
[26:50] brought unto you at the revelation of
[26:52] jesus christ
[26:54] when was the revelation of jesus christ
[26:56] given to the bride at the opening of the
[26:57] seals
[26:59] and there was a measure of grace amen
[27:01] the grace that is to be brought unto you
[27:04] at the revelation of jesus christ
[27:10] amen
[27:11] he is the principal theme of the entire
[27:13] bible
[27:15] if you read the bible and don't see
[27:17] christ in every verse of it go back and
[27:19] read it again
[27:21] see if see this is why we'll be reading
[27:24] our bibles the rest of our lives
[27:27] this is why we're never going to be able
[27:30] to say i got it now i got the full
[27:32] revelation you may have the revelation
[27:34] of christ in this day the revelation of
[27:36] the open book amen but i'm going to tell
[27:39] you that that revelation goes so deep
[27:41] amen i don't know that will ever come to
[27:43] the end of exploring that
[27:46] and so we'll always be continually
[27:49] reading our bible and discovering christ
[27:53] if you don't see christ in every verse
[27:54] of it go back and read it again see if
[27:56] you can't see christ in every verse of
[27:58] the bible then you read it again because
[28:00] you've missed something
[28:02] the bible is christ
[28:04] he is the word when you read in the
[28:07] beginning god created there is christ
[28:09] see every from that to the amen in
[28:11] revelations is every word testifying of
[28:14] jesus christ
[28:16] so the seals opened up the entire bible
[28:19] the entire bible is the revelation of
[28:21] jesus christ
[28:23] then what is the seals the revelation of
[28:25] jesus christ what is the bible the
[28:26] revelation of jesus christ when he took
[28:29] the oh when he opened the seals he
[28:30] opened up the entire bible
[28:36] you you've got to make the picture look
[28:38] right it's god's great picture and
[28:40] there's only one way you'll see it that
[28:43] when you see jesus christ there is the
[28:46] entire bible
[28:48] he's the principal theme of the bible
[28:53] okay
[28:54] if we go back to the road to emmaus
[28:57] these two uh disciples that are walking
[28:59] down the road to emmaus they made this
[29:02] statement we thought it would have been
[29:04] he that would have delivered
[29:06] now because of the circumstances making
[29:09] a turn you know they they were believing
[29:12] that this was the messiah they were
[29:13] believing this is the son of god that
[29:15] should come they were believing in the
[29:16] miracles and all that but because it
[29:19] took a turn that he didn't expect it to
[29:21] turn turn they didn't expect to make
[29:23] they made the statement we thought it
[29:24] had been he
[29:26] so now there was a question that doubt
[29:28] had entered in and and jesus admonishes
[29:31] him says old fools and slow of heart to
[29:33] believe all all that the prophets wrote
[29:35] you didn't catch at all you were just
[29:37] catching this part amen and then he
[29:40] began to expound the scriptures unto
[29:41] them to correct their understanding or
[29:43] bring them to the correct revelation of
[29:45] jesus christ
[29:46] but
[29:47] but if they had the correct revelation
[29:50] of who this was amen there would have
[29:53] been no question
[29:54] and no doubt to whatever the
[29:56] circumstance would happen amen
[29:59] so now he begins to to reveal himself to
[30:02] them he begins to open the scriptures
[30:04] unto them and open their understanding
[30:06] this is all in luke 24 he opens the
[30:08] scriptures to them but then later he
[30:09] opens their understanding to understand
[30:11] the scriptures amen then he fills them
[30:14] with the holy ghost and empowers them to
[30:16] be witnesses and they go off testifying
[30:18] believing the full word
[30:20] now
[30:21] if they had believed the full word
[30:22] before there would have been no question
[30:25] that he was the one
[30:27] but you could say but they took and
[30:28] nailed him to the cross and you can say
[30:31] i don't quite understand that part yet
[30:34] but it has to fit because of who he is
[30:36] amen
[30:38] so
[30:39] what about your messiah what about your
[30:41] deliverer amen what is this they've
[30:43] they've they've nailed him to a cross
[30:45] amen he's he's dead and he's laid in the
[30:48] sepulchre i saw where they laid him
[30:49] there's guard standing outside amen the
[30:51] correct revelation of who this was would
[30:54] have said i don't know but that has got
[30:56] to be in the word somewhere
[30:59] let me keep reading amen and as i keep
[31:01] reading amen that god will unlock it to
[31:04] me because there's nothing wrong with
[31:05] who this is my revelation of who this is
[31:08] is secure the change in circumstances
[31:11] does not change the truth of who this
[31:13] was
[31:16] and so you see how it takes a divine
[31:19] revelation from god to settle in your
[31:21] heart what this message is this message
[31:24] is christ
[31:26] the opening of the seals was the
[31:27] revealing of christ now if things in our
[31:30] life take a turn if we read things we
[31:33] don't understand and people ask
[31:34] questions we can't answer there's no
[31:36] reason to say well i thought this was
[31:38] christ
[31:41] there's no reason to go back and
[31:43] question amen because a true revelation
[31:46] a genuine revelation from god well says
[31:48] it doesn't matter if i can't answer your
[31:50] question it doesn't matter if even looks
[31:52] like this might be wrong amen i don't
[31:55] know one thing i know for sure that this
[31:57] is christ amen this is the mystery of
[32:00] god revealed in this day this is the
[32:02] truth that's been delivered through a
[32:04] prophetic ministry and been given to the
[32:06] bride i'm not questioning that anymore
[32:09] now i know that question has got to be
[32:11] in this word somewhere
[32:14] because that revelation amen was the
[32:17] entire bible
[32:20] amen
[32:22] i hope we see as we go on that brother
[32:24] branham was a very scriptural prophets
[32:29] amen even when he didn't explain it he
[32:32] was preaching the scriptures
[32:35] he's extremely scriptural
[32:39] so so many times because he doesn't
[32:42] explain he doesn't give the scriptural
[32:44] reference he doesn't uh he doesn't
[32:47] always tie all the pieces together amen
[32:49] that means
[32:50] it leaves many people wondering you know
[32:52] if that was his opinion or the way he
[32:54] felt about something or a statement he
[32:56] made and i just come back to say amen
[32:59] this was the seventh angel amen in the
[33:02] days of his voice the mystery of god
[33:04] shall be finished and christ is the
[33:06] mystery of god and christ is the seals
[33:09] and christ is the bible amen and when
[33:11] the mystery of god was finished it
[33:13] opened the entire bible amen and that
[33:16] that prophet of god was preaching out of
[33:18] that bible
[33:19] [Music]
[33:22] so if he makes a statement amen
[33:25] even if it looks like he might just be
[33:28] making a statement or giving an opinion
[33:30] because he doesn't qualify with
[33:31] scriptures amen do you really think that
[33:35] the man
[33:36] in discussing a situation or answering a
[33:38] question or giving a solution do you
[33:41] really think that the revelation that he
[33:43] had received in the seals did not
[33:45] influence that
[33:47] statement
[33:50] so it was influenced by the open book
[33:53] amen it was his revelation of christ his
[33:56] revelation of the mystery of god his
[33:58] revelation amen that was shaping every
[34:01] answer to every question
[34:04] the things that he would say and the
[34:06] things that he would warn against and
[34:07] the things that he would admonish and
[34:09] rebuke amen they were all shaped by the
[34:12] scriptures because this is the prophet
[34:14] of god who had received the mind of
[34:17] christ for this day
[34:20] and it was the unlocking of the entire
[34:22] bible so he's a very very scriptural
[34:26] prophet and we've had many questions in
[34:28] the past been asked many questions and
[34:30] many things that we could not answer but
[34:32] by the grace of god we can answer today
[34:35] things we could not answer 10 years ago
[34:38] we see and understand through the
[34:40] scriptures things today we didn't
[34:42] understand maybe even two three four
[34:44] years ago
[34:45] what is that there comes a time when god
[34:48] settles it in your heart what this
[34:49] message is and you know beyond a shadow
[34:52] of a doubt that this message is christ
[34:55] and so the the question you can't answer
[34:57] does not become the stumbling stone
[35:00] it becomes the motivation to look back
[35:02] in your bible again because if brother
[35:03] ben i'm taught it it's in the bible
[35:06] amen
[35:08] so
[35:12] there is the entire bible
[35:14] he's the principal theme
[35:17] of the bible
[35:18] and this message is christ
[35:21] so this message is preaching the entire
[35:24] bible
[35:26] message is christ
[35:27] it's the open book it's the opening of
[35:30] the word it's the revealing of the seals
[35:33] it's the revealing of the mystery of god
[35:35] the finishing of the mystery of god
[35:40] so we are a privileged people
[35:43] i want to keep looking in detail some of
[35:45] these statements
[35:47] he is the principle theme of the bible
[35:49] he was in the prophets he was in the
[35:51] psalms he was in the history of the
[35:52] bible the bible is a prophetic book it's
[35:55] a historical book it's a book of love
[35:57] it's a book of songs it's a book of life
[35:59] and in there you find christ he was in
[36:01] the prophets he was in the psalms he was
[36:04] in the history and he also in the bible
[36:06] was the thing that is to come
[36:08] so he was before until after what does
[36:11] that make him then the same yesterday
[36:14] today and forever
[36:17] so why is he the same yesterday today
[36:19] and forever because he's always been the
[36:21] word
[36:22] he was the word yesterday he's the word
[36:24] today he'll be the word forever
[36:27] so wherever the word was revealed that
[36:29] was christ and he's the same whatever he
[36:31] was then he's the same now even though
[36:33] the revelation is different in
[36:35] expression it's the same person
[36:39] it's the same one
[36:40] so he's the same yesterday today and
[36:42] forever
[36:44] john 1 1 in the beginning was the word
[36:47] and the word was with god and the word
[36:50] was god
[36:51] the same was in the beginning with god
[36:53] all things were made by him and without
[36:55] him was not anything made that was made
[36:58] in him was life and the life was the
[37:00] light of men
[37:03] so
[37:04] we know this scripture we've been
[37:05] through it so many times but in the
[37:07] beginning was the word word was with god
[37:09] the word was gone
[37:12] amen all things were made by him and
[37:14] without him was not anything made and in
[37:17] him was life
[37:18] and that life was the light of men
[37:21] so we have to have him the word
[37:24] to have life
[37:25] and to have light
[37:28] and the seven he says now the
[37:30] eighth chapter only reveals the scene
[37:33] of the seventh seal where nothing else
[37:36] is revealed nothing is not revealed in
[37:38] the seventh seal now has nothing to do
[37:40] with the seventh chapter of revelation
[37:42] it's the revealing of the seven seals
[37:44] perfectly mute
[37:45] and if i only had time i'll try in a few
[37:47] places to show you all the way back from
[37:50] genesis the seventh chapter this seventh
[37:52] seal is spoke of
[37:53] from the very beginning in genesis this
[37:56] these seals move right up
[37:59] now i've looked at this i i mean any of
[38:01] us who believe the message for any
[38:03] period of time we've looked at this
[38:04] quote over and over and over again but
[38:06] all of a sudden it just hit me in a
[38:08] deeper way the other day and and i want
[38:10] to share that with you if
[38:13] i only had time and i'll try in a few
[38:14] places i'll show you all the way back
[38:16] from genesis this seventh chapter the
[38:18] seventh seal is spoke of all the way
[38:21] back from the very beginning in genesis
[38:24] this this seals move right on up and
[38:26] i've always taken and looked at that the
[38:28] seventh seal and i showed the creation
[38:30] of man the creation of adam and his wife
[38:32] with him and coming out bringing her out
[38:34] of him and forming her and uniting the
[38:36] two together amen and that being a great
[38:38] thing and it and it was and that is an
[38:41] expression of the seventh seal
[38:43] but he says from the very beginning in
[38:45] genesis
[38:47] and i want to look at this
[38:50] he said he is the principal theme of the
[38:51] entire bible we had this quote before
[38:53] but i'm highlighting a separate part
[38:55] if you read the bible don't see christ
[38:57] in every verse go back and read it again
[38:58] you can't see christ in every verse of
[39:00] the bible then you read it again because
[39:02] you missed something the bible is christ
[39:04] he's the word when you read in the
[39:06] beginning god created there is christ
[39:10] if you want to find the beginning of the
[39:11] seventh seal there it is
[39:14] go all the way back to genesis 1 1 and
[39:17] if you want to find the start of these
[39:19] seals coming up in the beginning of the
[39:20] seventh seal you go back and when it
[39:22] says in the beginning god created there
[39:25] is
[39:26] christ oh i went back to genesis sure i
[39:30] preached on it back in genesis i didn't
[39:32] go back far enough amen
[39:34] you got to go all the way back to
[39:35] genesis 1 1 and when you go back to
[39:37] genesis 1 1 there you find christ
[39:40] christ is in genesis 1 1 and the bible
[39:44] he is the word
[39:45] he is the word amen the word was with
[39:48] god the word was god he is the word and
[39:52] in the beginning god created
[39:54] there is christ
[39:56] we're gonna find out why
[39:58] and see every from that to the amen in
[40:01] revelations is every word testifying of
[40:03] jesus christ
[40:05] so genesis 1 1 in the beginning god
[40:08] created the heaven and the earth
[40:10] and the key lies in how he created
[40:14] in revelation 4 10 he says the four and
[40:16] 20 elders fell down before him that sat
[40:18] on the throne so who did they fall
[40:19] before the one that was sitting on the
[40:21] throne
[40:22] i want you to catch this john is lifted
[40:24] up after the church ages and he caught
[40:26] into a heavenly realm and he first thing
[40:28] he sees is one sitting on the throne and
[40:31] now he sees the 24 others fall down
[40:33] before him that sat on the throne and
[40:35] worship him that liveth forever and ever
[40:37] and cast their crowns before the throne
[40:39] saying thou art worthy o lord to receive
[40:41] glory and honor and power for thou hast
[40:44] created all things and for thy pleasure
[40:46] they are and were created so who created
[40:49] all things the one sitting on the throne
[40:53] god created the heaven and the earth
[40:55] but brother branham said when you read
[40:57] that genesis 1 1 there's christ
[41:00] in the beginning said when it says in
[41:01] the beginning god created heaven and
[41:03] earth there's christ
[41:05] and who created
[41:07] all things the one who's sitting on the
[41:09] throne
[41:11] hebrews 11 tells us now faith is the
[41:13] substance of things hoped for the
[41:15] evidence of things not seen
[41:17] for by it the elders obtained a good
[41:19] report through faith we understand that
[41:21] the worlds were framed by the word of
[41:23] god
[41:24] so the things which are seen were not
[41:26] made of things which do appear so in the
[41:28] beginning when it says god created we
[41:30] know that the worlds were framed by the
[41:32] word of god so how did he create he
[41:34] created with his word so in the
[41:36] beginning when it says god created
[41:38] there's christ right there
[41:41] that's christ because christ is the word
[41:43] and god created by his word amen
[41:46] so the worlds were framed by the word of
[41:49] god
[41:49] praise be to god
[41:52] this is so important amen that we
[41:54] understand these seals open up the
[41:56] entire bible now genesis 1 1 is opened
[41:59] up
[42:01] all the way back in the beginning
[42:02] genesis 1 1 is opened up
[42:04] john 1 10 he was in the world
[42:07] and the world was made by him and the
[42:10] world knew him not
[42:12] he's speaking of jesus this just as john
[42:14] 1 where john 1 1 we just read in the
[42:16] beginning was the word the word was with
[42:18] god the word was god amen now we come
[42:21] it's describing him coming into the
[42:23] world and it says he was in the world
[42:25] who the word
[42:29] the word was in the world
[42:31] the world was made by him and the world
[42:33] knew him not
[42:35] now later when we get to verse 14 notice
[42:38] this is verse 10. so verse 1 says in the
[42:41] beginning was the word john 1 1
[42:43] 10 says he was in the world and the
[42:45] world was made by him and the world knew
[42:46] him not verse 14 says and he was made
[42:49] flesh and dwelt among us
[42:52] so i'd like to say the word has been in
[42:55] the world
[42:57] and the word
[42:58] is christ and christ has been rejected
[43:01] from the very beginning when eve left
[43:03] the word she left christ
[43:06] in the world and he was in the world
[43:10] but he was rejected
[43:13] all the way back in genesis he was
[43:15] rejected
[43:16] because whenever they rejected the word
[43:18] they rejected christ
[43:22] amen
[43:23] the world was made by him and the world
[43:26] knew him not
[43:27] so the worlds were framed by the word of
[43:29] god christ who made it god how did he
[43:32] make it by christ
[43:34] by the word his word which is him
[43:38] and the word was made
[43:40] the world was made by him
[43:43] first john 5 7 for there are three that
[43:45] bear record in heaven the father the
[43:47] word and the holy ghost and these three
[43:49] are one so who is christ the word
[43:53] see when brother branham starts saying
[43:55] you know jesus christ is the word he's
[43:57] the word he's the entire bible he is a
[43:59] very scriptural prophet
[44:02] he's preaching exactly what paul
[44:04] preached amen when i mean when we first
[44:07] began to hear i was raised pentecostal i
[44:09] come up all my life i cut my teeth
[44:11] literally on the back of a pew because
[44:13] we had pews back then
[44:15] and
[44:17] and all my life i heard what was called
[44:19] the gospel
[44:22] but really what i wasn't being taught
[44:24] the gospel i was being taught
[44:25] traditional understanding of scriptures
[44:29] which is not the gospel
[44:31] the gospel is a good news today
[44:33] the good news today is the way of
[44:34] salvation today
[44:37] but i thought i was hearing the gospel
[44:39] and i came up and i and i realized that
[44:42] that i wasn't understanding
[44:45] who christ was
[44:47] and i would hear brother branham make
[44:49] statements like
[44:50] and and christ was the word and the word
[44:53] the entire bible is christ and when you
[44:56] have a denominational understanding you
[44:58] see that christ amen comes on earth amen
[45:02] and uh uh you know comes on earth when
[45:04] he's uh injected into the womb of mary
[45:07] amen and mary delivers and there is the
[45:09] beginning of jesus christ
[45:12] that's a denominational understanding
[45:15] so when brother branham said amen that
[45:18] was christ and moses i
[45:21] as the denominational boy i believe it i
[45:24] got a revelation of the message but now
[45:26] as you take time and read through the
[45:29] word and let the truth dictate your
[45:31] understanding of the scriptures amen and
[45:34] let this message amen be true
[45:38] by revelation not because i tell you
[45:40] that it is i could tell you that it is
[45:41] and you're going to get twisted up in
[45:42] all kinds of nonsense trying to make
[45:45] your own understanding work with the
[45:46] bible but when this message is true by
[45:48] revelation then you don't have to twist
[45:51] the bible to fit any previous
[45:53] understanding you take that the the
[45:55] truth the revelation of the message and
[45:57] you let it shatter every previous
[46:00] understanding that we've ever had
[46:03] and come back to the bible and read the
[46:05] bible
[46:07] through the lens of christ
[46:11] because this message is christ
[46:16] so he is the word
[46:19] in revelation 19 13 and he was clothed
[46:22] with a vester dipped in blood and his
[46:23] name is called the word of god
[46:26] this is why
[46:29] when we talk about the message the
[46:31] restoration of the word
[46:34] it is the coming of christ
[46:36] because he is the word
[46:39] we have embraced christ when we've
[46:41] received this word
[46:44] we have rejected christ when we've
[46:46] rejected the word
[46:49] and so
[46:51] we get so many
[46:53] misunderstandings
[46:55] because of traditional teaching and
[46:57] traditional understanding amen but we
[47:00] miss the truth that has been brought to
[47:02] us
[47:03] that he is the word of god
[47:06] in ephesians 3 8 90 says unto me whom
[47:09] less than the least of all saints is
[47:11] this grace given that i should preach
[47:14] among the gentiles the unsearchable
[47:16] riches of christ and to make all men see
[47:19] what is the fellowship of the mystery
[47:21] which from the beginning of the world
[47:22] has been hid in god who created all
[47:25] things by jesus christ
[47:28] okay now now
[47:30] we know that the bible tells us that in
[47:33] the beginning god created the heavens
[47:35] and earth and by his word the the god
[47:38] framed the heavens were framed by the
[47:40] word of god so now the apostle paul is
[47:43] saying he created all things by jesus
[47:45] christ amen but what form was jesus
[47:48] christ in creating all things amen he
[47:50] was the word or he was the manifestation
[47:52] or the reflection of god he was the
[47:55] thought expressed
[47:58] and the thought expressed was word amen
[48:01] so in john 1 1 when it says in the
[48:03] beginning was the word amen that greek
[48:05] word is logos the word logos means word
[48:08] but it means word with the thought amen
[48:11] including the thought not just a word
[48:13] that you can take and attach another
[48:15] thought to it that's not the word
[48:19] that's why when you can take a bible
[48:21] verse and you can take your own
[48:23] understanding to a bible verse and
[48:25] change it from god's original intention
[48:27] and now make it mean something else that
[48:29] is not the word no matter how much you
[48:31] say it is the word and how much you
[48:33] quote the bible reference amen that is
[48:36] not the word
[48:38] so let's just say let's say you take
[48:40] matthew 28 and you say
[48:43] jesus told them to baptize in the name
[48:46] of the father and the name of the son
[48:48] and the name of the holy ghost and so
[48:50] now we're baptizing according to the way
[48:53] jesus said baptize and they put somebody
[48:55] under under three titles and bring them
[48:58] back up that is not the word
[49:02] you can quote the scripture as you do it
[49:05] you can repeat the phrases out of the
[49:07] scripture but that is not the word
[49:09] because that is not what christ meant
[49:11] when he said that what christ meant was
[49:14] that i want you to baptize in the name
[49:17] singular of the father and the son and
[49:20] the holy ghost and there was one earthly
[49:23] name that god took in his manifestation
[49:25] and that is the lord jesus christ
[49:28] so when you baptize in the name of lord
[49:30] jesus christ amen the trinitarian the uh
[49:33] indoctrinated theologian the high
[49:35] educated scholar amen will take you back
[49:38] to scripture and i've had i've had some
[49:40] people that i've talked to say you know
[49:43] jesus said do it this way
[49:46] peter said do it this way
[49:48] i'll take what jesus said he's better
[49:50] than peter
[49:54] see human reasoning is so childish
[49:59] it misses the it misses how perfect god
[50:02] is amen how beautiful his word is how
[50:05] perfectly he gave us his word amen and
[50:08] it makes god haphazard and somehow god
[50:11] allowed peter to say it wrong and then
[50:13] he allowed some scribe to write it down
[50:15] wrong and that scribe he wrote it down
[50:17] or has been perpetuated wrong but really
[50:19] we got to get back to the original what
[50:21] jesus said was right and why do we even
[50:23] have a bible
[50:24] then if it can't be trusted
[50:28] but you see
[50:30] that's not the word amen quoting
[50:33] scripture is not necessarily the word
[50:38] you say them a lot of places and people
[50:40] want to throw stones at you
[50:43] but this is why we've got over 40 000
[50:45] denominations if we just think about it
[50:47] amen we understand that just being able
[50:50] to base what you believe amen off of
[50:53] scripture that's been twisted to your
[50:54] understanding that fits your purpose
[50:57] does not make that the thought of god
[50:58] expressed
[51:00] that is now your thought expressed
[51:04] you've taken the ink on paper and
[51:06] changed it from its original intent and
[51:08] changed it to some human intent
[51:13] praise be to god
[51:15] so jesus christ is the word
[51:19] but he is the logos he is the word
[51:22] that is expressing the thought of god
[51:25] and whenever that word is expressing
[51:27] god's thought that is christ
[51:31] that's christ
[51:33] that's why to reject that is to reject
[51:35] christ i can't say that enough amen
[51:37] people think that they have to deny that
[51:39] jesus died 2000 years ago to reject
[51:42] christ amen billions of people believe
[51:44] that jesus died 2 000 years ago amen but
[51:46] to reject the word which is the thought
[51:49] of god expressed in our day is to reject
[51:52] christ you're rejecting the same one
[51:54] that died 2 000 years ago
[51:58] he's the word so he created all things
[52:01] by jesus christ
[52:04] colossians 1 14 in whom we have
[52:06] redemption through his blood even the
[52:08] forgiveness of sins who is the image of
[52:10] the invisible god the firstborn of every
[52:13] creature
[52:14] for by him were all things created that
[52:16] are in heaven and that are in earth
[52:18] visible and invisible so who created all
[52:22] things
[52:24] they were created god created all things
[52:26] how did he create it by him
[52:29] who's him the word
[52:30] amen for by him were all things created
[52:33] that are in heaven that are in the earth
[52:35] visible and invisible whether they be
[52:37] thrones or dominions or principalities
[52:39] or powers
[52:41] and all things were created by him
[52:43] and for him
[52:45] and he is before all things and by him
[52:47] all things consist
[52:51] that makes the word
[52:53] central to everything
[52:57] all things are created by him the word
[52:59] oh and for him the word he is before all
[53:02] things the word is before all things and
[53:04] by him the word all things consist that
[53:07] means our life is totally wrapped up in
[53:09] this word amen this word is what brings
[53:11] light this word is what brings life this
[53:14] word is our life we consist in the word
[53:17] all things consist by the word
[53:20] but what word the word that is the
[53:23] expression of god's thought that is the
[53:25] pure
[53:26] word he is the head of the body the
[53:29] church who is the beginning the
[53:30] firstborn from the dead that in all
[53:32] things he might have the preeminence for
[53:35] it please the father that in him should
[53:36] all fullness dwell
[53:39] now and who is this melchizedek he says
[53:42] notice now his attribute
[53:44] then the attribute was first god the
[53:48] thought
[53:49] the attribute itself
[53:51] all in one without being expressed
[53:54] so that's when brother bam says god was
[53:56] alone with his thoughts
[53:58] it wasn't yet nothing was expressed
[54:00] there was no expression this was god
[54:02] with his attributes all of his thoughts
[54:04] now i want to say i'm going to skip back
[54:06] because i get this feeling you're
[54:08] reading ahead
[54:11] i'm not a super sensitive person but i
[54:13] just have that sense
[54:16] so
[54:19] what first was was the god with his
[54:21] attributes with his thoughts that was
[54:23] gone
[54:25] and
[54:26] god's thoughts are real they're they're
[54:28] they're not uh fairy tales they're not
[54:31] something that he changes
[54:34] they're literal they're permanent
[54:35] they're everlasting they are eternal
[54:38] they are his thoughts are himself
[54:42] now you say now those thoughts were
[54:44] expressed and and we are one of those
[54:46] thoughts if we're a predestinated seed
[54:48] of god with the gene of god then we were
[54:49] in his thinking then we're one of his
[54:50] thoughts now now i want you to just hang
[54:53] with me for just a moment amen as i as i
[54:56] try the best i can to explain something
[54:58] as i see it
[55:00] no doubt when god saw the plan of
[55:02] redemption before the foundation of the
[55:04] world he did because he wrote a book
[55:06] called the lamb's book of life before
[55:08] the foundation of the world
[55:10] and he was the lamb slain from before
[55:13] the foundation world so in god's
[55:14] thoughts
[55:16] christ was slain
[55:18] to pay the price of redemption to redeem
[55:20] back that had been fallen
[55:22] so that means in god's thought he
[55:24] understood there would be a fall
[55:26] and if he understood there would be a
[55:27] fall he knew there would be bad
[55:29] characters in that fall
[55:33] and he knew that subsequently there
[55:35] would be air that would come into the
[55:37] church and and
[55:38] god knew the end from the beginning
[55:42] so
[55:44] you cannot say those
[55:46] thoughts are eternal and those thoughts
[55:50] are god
[55:52] right
[55:53] because he knew there would be those who
[55:55] wouldn't be saved in the end
[55:57] is that right
[55:58] but when god when you talk about god
[56:00] alone with his thoughts it's his thought
[56:02] of himself and how he wishes to express
[56:05] himself that's the attributes
[56:09] and in that plan to have an expression
[56:11] of himself amen that expression in order
[56:14] to be understood has to fall against the
[56:16] backdrop of black so the contrast will
[56:19] show god and all of his characteristics
[56:21] show him as a healer because their
[56:23] sickness show him as a savior because
[56:25] there's need of salvation you understand
[56:28] so god as brother matt says the great
[56:31] architect starts laying on his plan as
[56:33] he's laying out his plan he knows that
[56:35] in order to show this attribute there
[56:37] has to be this contrast and for this
[56:39] attribute has to be is contrasted and
[56:42] and and then the lamb is going to have
[56:43] to be slain from before the foundation
[56:45] world there's going to be need for a
[56:47] slain lamb there'll be somebody who will
[56:48] take him and kill him
[56:51] right god is an architect he he saw this
[56:54] out but but the attributes that he was
[56:56] along with was himself
[57:00] the thoughts of himself and how he would
[57:03] express himself in each one of those
[57:06] expressions of god are called attribute
[57:09] or thoughts
[57:12] so if you are on earth to express god
[57:16] then you were there that day as one of
[57:18] his attributes as thoughts you are here
[57:21] to express what he was thinking back
[57:23] then which is how he will express
[57:25] himself
[57:28] so you are part of himself being
[57:31] expressed
[57:32] that's what makes you the word
[57:35] you're not all of the word you're part
[57:38] of the word you may be one little speck
[57:40] of the word but i don't care if it's a
[57:41] microscopic speck the word is the word
[57:44] it's eternal it's his thought it's his
[57:46] attribute it's part of himself
[57:50] so we we can never claim that we're all
[57:52] the word or i may not even be a great
[57:54] big part of the word i might even be
[57:55] just a little bitty teeny part of the
[57:57] word but i'm satisfied with it being the
[57:59] smallest grain of the word that i can be
[58:01] i'm still satisfied amen
[58:04] i'm still thoroughly satisfied because
[58:06] if i'm the smart and they know i don't
[58:08] think god has big thoughts and little
[58:09] thoughts you know what i'm saying
[58:11] but in our own perspective if i'm just
[58:13] the littlest grain of the thought of god
[58:16] that means i was eternal with him and
[58:18] i'm part of his expression and his plan
[58:21] to express himself in this expression
[58:24] that makes me part of the word that
[58:26] gives an eternal eternal quality to me
[58:33] praise be to god that's why brother
[58:37] bremen could say it's not the flesh that
[58:39] comes predestinated not the dirt that
[58:40] you live in it's that seed of god that
[58:42] thought of god that expression that's
[58:44] what becomes predestinated and because
[58:47] that is predestinated and predetermined
[58:49] express god all the dirt that he gathers
[58:52] around you now is predestinated dirt
[58:55] because
[58:57] it's expressing the predestinated life
[58:59] inside
[59:03] praise be to god
[59:06] amen
[59:08] now
[59:09] now let's go back to who's this milk is
[59:11] today
[59:13] then the attribute was first god the
[59:15] thought the attribute itself all in one
[59:18] without being expressed then when he
[59:21] expressed secondarily he became the word
[59:25] and then the word was made flesh and
[59:27] dwelt among us
[59:28] so he's throwing three stages of the
[59:30] progression
[59:31] i kicked back so you can't read ahead
[59:33] i'm wise enough
[59:37] first you have the eternal thoughts of
[59:40] god which the eternal thoughts of god
[59:42] are the thoughts about himself now
[59:44] that's just my terminology that's not
[59:46] what the way brother branham explained
[59:47] this is just the way i understand it so
[59:49] forgive me i may adjust it later
[59:52] but the thoughts god have of himself of
[59:54] how he will express himself are eternal
[59:56] thoughts
[59:59] and because he wants to express himself
[1:00:02] in me
[1:00:03] i'm part of those eternal thoughts
[1:00:05] so i'm part of god at the beginning
[1:00:08] but god in his great condensation when
[1:00:11] he would come into full expression
[1:00:13] he first had thoughts
[1:00:16] and when those thoughts began to express
[1:00:19] the thoughts came the expression came
[1:00:22] from the thought
[1:00:25] and that expression that came from the
[1:00:26] thought was the logos or the word which
[1:00:28] is the thought expressed
[1:00:30] now however the thought is expressed is
[1:00:32] word
[1:00:34] that's the expression of the thought
[1:00:36] and that word that expressed he called
[1:00:39] sun
[1:00:41] it takes the title of son
[1:00:43] but it's not different than him it came
[1:00:45] from him it's an extension of him
[1:00:48] to play another role
[1:00:50] all right
[1:00:52] and then that word that came from god
[1:00:55] that was with god that was god
[1:00:58] that word was taken and put into a body
[1:01:00] of flesh amen in jesus christ at 2 000
[1:01:04] years ago and now it becomes manifested
[1:01:08] word
[1:01:09] okay so we have
[1:01:11] thought
[1:01:13] expressed is word
[1:01:16] coming to earth and it's season of
[1:01:17] manifestation is manifested word there's
[1:01:19] three stages amen to this and it all
[1:01:23] links back to god it all comes from god
[1:01:26] it is all part of god it is all
[1:01:28] expressing god so wherever you find
[1:01:30] yourself amen how can you separate it
[1:01:33] from god you find yourself down here
[1:01:35] you're here in 2022 and in 2022 you're
[1:01:39] here to express christ in the formation
[1:01:41] of the bride your little part your
[1:01:43] little life the little things that you
[1:01:45] do and interact with that little
[1:01:46] snapshot you're here to express bride of
[1:01:49] christ in your body of flesh
[1:01:53] if you're here to express that then you
[1:01:55] were in the logos when the word came out
[1:01:57] of god
[1:01:59] you were there
[1:02:00] when it came out as logos it was a
[1:02:02] theophany a form an expression something
[1:02:04] that could now be seen you were there i
[1:02:06] mean if you were there then you were in
[1:02:08] his thoughts when he was alone with his
[1:02:09] thoughts so where do you draw the
[1:02:11] separating line where do you say what's
[1:02:13] part of god and what's not part of god
[1:02:15] what's an expression of god and what's
[1:02:16] not an expression god it all links back
[1:02:18] to one head which is god
[1:02:22] the thought the father the originator
[1:02:25] the origin of everything is the thought
[1:02:28] the father
[1:02:30] the expression
[1:02:32] is the sun
[1:02:34] and further expressions are sons and
[1:02:36] daughters
[1:02:39] little clinkers off the clinker
[1:02:42] little clinkers off the sun
[1:02:44] our sons and daughters have gone
[1:02:47] you see friends
[1:02:48] when the seven seals opened it opened
[1:02:50] the entire bible
[1:02:53] it was so much more
[1:02:55] than just a
[1:02:57] an understanding of some doctrines and a
[1:02:59] correction of dying all the correction
[1:03:00] of the doctors was pointing back to the
[1:03:02] same thing it was pointing back to the
[1:03:04] origin in the original purpose
[1:03:07] oh i gotta quit i'm getting too far
[1:03:09] ahead
[1:03:11] i told myself i'm not gonna do this
[1:03:14] i think it's partially your fault
[1:03:17] he expressed secondarily he became the
[1:03:20] word and then the word was made flesh
[1:03:22] and one among us
[1:03:24] saint john the first chapter in the
[1:03:25] first verse notice this in the beginning
[1:03:28] but before the eternal notice in the
[1:03:30] beginning was the word when the time
[1:03:32] began it was word but before it was word
[1:03:35] it was attribute a thought
[1:03:38] then it was expressed in the beginning
[1:03:39] was the expression the word now we're
[1:03:42] getting where melchizedek is
[1:03:45] he's preaching who's this melchizedek
[1:03:46] he's talking about melchizedek was an
[1:03:48] expression of the word in theophonic
[1:03:51] form amen it was a theophany of god
[1:03:54] expressing the thought of god
[1:03:57] and that's theophany can take many
[1:03:59] different shapes and forms
[1:04:02] the pillar of fire is the theophany
[1:04:04] of the word
[1:04:07] amen so that's where you get to where
[1:04:09] this melchizedek is that's this
[1:04:11] mysterious person in the beginning was
[1:04:13] the word and the word was with god and
[1:04:15] the word was god
[1:04:17] and then the word become flesh and dwelt
[1:04:18] among us hold that there now notice
[1:04:22] his first being was spirit god
[1:04:24] supernatural all right the great eternal
[1:04:26] second he begin to form himself towards
[1:04:29] flesh and a theophany
[1:04:32] then the thought comes into an
[1:04:33] expression the expression comes into a
[1:04:35] manifestation
[1:04:39] all right it's called the word a body
[1:04:42] this then is the state that he was in
[1:04:43] when he met abraham was called
[1:04:45] melchizedek he was in the form of
[1:04:46] theophany now we'll get to that and
[1:04:48] prove it in a few minutes the lord
[1:04:50] willing he was the
[1:04:52] word
[1:04:54] again and who is his milk is it now god
[1:04:56] in this stage
[1:04:58] it's this stage of his creation later
[1:05:00] formed into flesh jesus
[1:05:03] so
[1:05:04] god
[1:05:06] listen now god in this stage
[1:05:11] who was that in milk is it what state it
[1:05:13] was another stage of an expression of
[1:05:15] god
[1:05:18] now god in this stage
[1:05:20] is this stage of his creation later
[1:05:22] formed into flesh jesus
[1:05:24] from what from the great beginning
[1:05:26] spirit then came down to be the word
[1:05:29] bringing itself out the word doesn't yet
[1:05:31] make itself it just spoke out in morphy
[1:05:35] later he becomes flesh jesus mortal to
[1:05:37] taste death for all us sinners there
[1:05:39] he's talking the three stages again he
[1:05:42] says first
[1:05:44] first he is the spirit in great
[1:05:46] beginning spirit
[1:05:48] now
[1:05:49] now then come down to be the word bring
[1:05:52] itself out so the thought begins to
[1:05:55] express amen the word doesn't yet make
[1:05:58] itself the word doesn't yet make itself
[1:06:00] he's talking about down into flesh and
[1:06:01] this manifestation
[1:06:03] it just spoke out in morphing so it
[1:06:05] turned from thought to a spoken word to
[1:06:08] an expression of the thought
[1:06:10] and then later become flesh
[1:06:13] right i'm going to try
[1:06:16] to draw this out
[1:06:19] i hope this helps i know there's all
[1:06:21] kinds of different ways to express
[1:06:23] things and people learn in different
[1:06:24] ways but i just thought i would try to
[1:06:26] express it this way
[1:06:28] you have
[1:06:30] thought
[1:06:35] an expression
[1:06:40] and there may be even be better words to
[1:06:42] use to express this this is just the way
[1:06:44] that i can express it
[1:06:46] and then manifestation
[1:06:52] all right
[1:06:54] so if i could go up here
[1:06:56] and every time i draw pictures i'm
[1:06:57] embarrassed
[1:07:04] so you've seen these little caricatures
[1:07:06] a little thought
[1:07:08] there's first a thought
[1:07:12] and then
[1:07:12] there's an expression
[1:07:20] right
[1:07:22] some sort of expression
[1:07:26] and then
[1:07:29] there's a manifestation
[1:07:32] and the manifestation is light
[1:07:35] whatever manifestation
[1:07:37] if it's in flesh
[1:07:38] if it's in manna on the ground
[1:07:41] the manifested word is light
[1:07:46] if you look at this
[1:07:47] you have in the beginning i'll just
[1:07:49] write it across the bottom here
[1:07:51] you have god's thought of light
[1:07:54] right god thought about light in this
[1:07:57] world in this creation he thought about
[1:07:59] light
[1:08:01] then
[1:08:02] he spoke light
[1:08:07] and then later
[1:08:10] light appeared
[1:08:14] brother braham said it could have been
[1:08:14] hundreds of years later
[1:08:17] you have here
[1:08:20] jesus or god thought
[1:08:24] of
[1:08:27] jesus
[1:08:29] he spoke
[1:08:31] the prophecy
[1:08:36] and then
[1:08:38] he made flesh
[1:08:42] amen
[1:08:43] so you see the the expressions
[1:08:46] of god
[1:08:48] the thought
[1:08:50] was the original
[1:08:53] when in creation when light appeared
[1:08:56] that was not the original
[1:08:59] the original was the thought
[1:09:03] so the original is with the father the
[1:09:05] originator of everything the original is
[1:09:08] thought sometimes we think the original
[1:09:11] is what we see but by the time we see it
[1:09:13] that's just a reflection of the original
[1:09:15] an expression a manifestation of the
[1:09:17] original but the original is thought
[1:09:20] that's why it's so important that the
[1:09:24] expression
[1:09:25] matches the thought
[1:09:28] and the manifestation matches the
[1:09:30] expression which matches the thought it
[1:09:32] all has to go back to the original
[1:09:35] and this path
[1:09:36] of of god manifesting himself any time
[1:09:40] we deviate from the original we're no
[1:09:42] longer carrying the life of the original
[1:09:45] with us it becomes perverted life
[1:09:48] so in order for it to be true an
[1:09:51] expression of god it has to stay true
[1:09:53] from thought
[1:09:54] to expression now that expression many
[1:09:57] times was misunderstood when isaiah said
[1:09:59] a virgin shall conceive there was a lot
[1:10:02] of misunderstanding that went about that
[1:10:03] expression maybe it's the virgin nation
[1:10:05] of israel maybe it's the virgin daughter
[1:10:07] of the high priest for this day and that
[1:10:09] nobody in that day knew was going to be
[1:10:11] 700 years later a virgin in an
[1:10:13] obscure little town an obscure little
[1:10:15] out of the way place they didn't foresee
[1:10:17] that they got the the expression the
[1:10:20] expression was true absolutely perfectly
[1:10:23] true
[1:10:25] but it can become
[1:10:26] very much misunderstood
[1:10:31] and the misunderstanding is not god's
[1:10:33] fault
[1:10:38] because if we got if we want
[1:10:39] understanding on the word and then we
[1:10:40] need to stop our education
[1:10:43] and pray for revelation
[1:10:47] because revelation on the word will
[1:10:49] bring the original thought to that word
[1:10:52] and make it the correct manifestation
[1:10:56] amen this is this is god's way now we're
[1:11:00] still talking about the opening of seals
[1:11:02] open the entire bible
[1:11:04] but i hope you're seeing now that this
[1:11:05] is the entire bible
[1:11:07] the entire bible amen the entire bible
[1:11:11] was god's thought expressed
[1:11:14] and most of the bible or much of the
[1:11:16] bible contains the manifestation of that
[1:11:19] expression
[1:11:20] it was manifested in moses it was
[1:11:22] manifested in the exodus it was man that
[1:11:24] was the manifestation and then god keeps
[1:11:26] speaking manifesting speaking
[1:11:28] manifesting but it all ties back to his
[1:11:30] original thought
[1:11:32] that's the original
[1:11:35] all right
[1:11:37] let's keep going
[1:11:40] now hebrews 1 1 god who at sundry times
[1:11:43] and in diverse manners spake and time
[1:11:45] passed unto the fathers by the prophets
[1:11:47] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[1:11:49] by his son
[1:11:50] who he hath appointed heir of all things
[1:11:52] by whom he also made the worlds so who
[1:11:55] did he make the worlds by his son
[1:11:58] who's his son the word
[1:12:01] amen
[1:12:03] and who being the brightness of his
[1:12:07] glory
[1:12:08] and the express image of his person
[1:12:12] and upholding all things by the word of
[1:12:14] his power when he had by himself purged
[1:12:17] our sins sat down on the right hand of
[1:12:18] the majesty on high
[1:12:20] so i i want to focus on this uh by whom
[1:12:24] he made the worlds we know he made the
[1:12:25] worlds by the word we know by the word
[1:12:27] of god the worlds were framed that god
[1:12:29] created it all but he did it by his word
[1:12:31] and that word is an express thought and
[1:12:34] that expressed thought is called sun it
[1:12:36] has the title of sun
[1:12:39] so he made the world by his son
[1:12:42] who being
[1:12:43] the brightness of his glory
[1:12:46] and the express image of his person so
[1:12:49] now that son
[1:12:50] is a perfect reflection of the father
[1:12:54] that if you want to see the father you
[1:12:57] need to look at the son because the son
[1:12:59] is the expression of the original
[1:13:01] thought of the father and now he is the
[1:13:04] express image of the father
[1:13:07] that's what make jesus christ amen
[1:13:09] unique in all of creation because all of
[1:13:12] the word was in him and all of the word
[1:13:15] was made flesh in him and he became the
[1:13:18] perfect expressed image of god if you
[1:13:21] wanted to see god what would god be if
[1:13:24] god was in flesh look at jesus christ
[1:13:25] because that's god and flesh
[1:13:28] he's the express image and his life was
[1:13:31] so perfect amen that that the
[1:13:33] manifestation
[1:13:35] matched every scripture that's why on
[1:13:37] the road to the road to emmaus he could
[1:13:40] say he could take them back to moses and
[1:13:42] expound unto them through all the
[1:13:44] scriptures the scriptures concerning
[1:13:46] himself
[1:13:47] because the expression the manifestation
[1:13:50] of his life on this earth was a perfect
[1:13:53] reflection of the expressed word coming
[1:13:56] through all the prophets
[1:13:58] and that word coming through all the
[1:13:59] prophets was a perfect expression of the
[1:14:02] thought of god because those prophets
[1:14:04] weren't speaking their own word they
[1:14:05] were speaking god's word
[1:14:08] so the word that they spoke amen contain
[1:14:10] the thought
[1:14:12] so that word contained the original
[1:14:15] thought and when it was expressed the
[1:14:16] manifestation was perfect
[1:14:20] and that was jesus christ
[1:14:22] that's why
[1:14:24] he and the father or the he and god are
[1:14:26] the same thing because it's god's
[1:14:28] thought manifest and expressed in flesh
[1:14:32] and he becomes the perfect reflection of
[1:14:34] god
[1:14:36] not the father
[1:14:38] because the father is the originator to
[1:14:40] thought this is the son that came out of
[1:14:41] the father another expression of god
[1:14:46] another expression in manifestation
[1:14:49] but the expressed image of his person
[1:14:54] now
[1:14:55] there's and the message there's a man
[1:14:57] here that can turn on the light
[1:14:59] god's word comes only by the bible god's
[1:15:02] bible
[1:15:03] the the printed form of the son of god
[1:15:08] now we know why the prophet said this
[1:15:10] because of all the scriptures that we've
[1:15:12] just read
[1:15:14] the printed form of the son of god
[1:15:16] so
[1:15:17] brother brahm said this is god in letter
[1:15:19] form
[1:15:20] because it's the thoughts of god and
[1:15:21] letter form he said this is the printed
[1:15:24] form of the son of god
[1:15:25] because the son of god is the word
[1:15:27] that came from the father
[1:15:30] the printed form of the son of god
[1:15:32] because the bible said that is the
[1:15:33] revelation of jesus christ it's god it's
[1:15:36] god revealing himself through christ and
[1:15:38] christ is the word and it takes the
[1:15:41] light of god to shine upon that word to
[1:15:43] vindicate it to prove that god still
[1:15:45] speaks life eternal life he speaks
[1:15:48] natural light brings life the life only
[1:15:51] comes by the light the word made
[1:15:54] manifest or made flesh
[1:15:57] we talked about this
[1:15:59] i believe it was on wednesday night life
[1:16:01] only comes by the light the word may
[1:16:04] manifest or made flesh
[1:16:06] when that word
[1:16:08] is the expressed thought is made
[1:16:10] manifest if it's lined up all the way
[1:16:13] back to the original thought
[1:16:15] that manifestation is light
[1:16:18] and that light will bring life
[1:16:22] that is the purpose of the manifested
[1:16:24] word in each age and each age god's
[1:16:27] thought had been expressed in word that
[1:16:29] word come into manifestation that
[1:16:31] manifestation became light and that
[1:16:33] light brought life
[1:16:38] it's always been god's plan it's still
[1:16:40] god's plan
[1:16:43] first john 1 7 but if we walk in the
[1:16:45] light
[1:16:46] as he is in the light
[1:16:50] that means a present tense
[1:16:54] a current light
[1:16:57] if we'll walk
[1:16:59] walk is not stationary walker's movement
[1:17:03] so if we're moving in the light as he's
[1:17:05] in the light the whole terminology gives
[1:17:09] the image of movement
[1:17:11] so that means the light is not
[1:17:13] stationary
[1:17:15] it wasn't stationary in the exodus they
[1:17:17] had to walk in the light as he was in
[1:17:19] the light when the pillar of fire moved
[1:17:20] that was their light they moved with the
[1:17:22] light amen it's it is foreshadowing the
[1:17:25] movement of the church the church moves
[1:17:27] with the pillar of fire as the light of
[1:17:29] the manifested word moves the church
[1:17:31] moves with it and if you walk in the
[1:17:32] light as he's in the light it didn't say
[1:17:35] if you sit in the light as he sits in
[1:17:36] the light
[1:17:38] so you could sit in the light and refuse
[1:17:41] to walk and then find yourself outside
[1:17:43] of light
[1:17:45] and the light brings life
[1:17:48] so you can find yourself outside the
[1:17:50] life
[1:17:51] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:17:53] the light we have fellowship one with
[1:17:54] another and the blood of jesus christ
[1:17:56] his son cleanses us from all sins
[1:18:00] he says god is revealed in every age by
[1:18:02] his promised word to that age
[1:18:05] god has revealed in every age by his
[1:18:07] promised word to that age
[1:18:09] so if you want god find his promised
[1:18:12] word for that age
[1:18:14] because god is revealed i just love the
[1:18:16] way the prophet says this i
[1:18:18] we would skim over these statements and
[1:18:20] read them and read them yeah yeah yeah
[1:18:21] but not understand the full impact of
[1:18:23] what he's saying god is revealed in
[1:18:25] every age by his promised word to that
[1:18:28] age
[1:18:29] so god wants to be revealed in this age
[1:18:32] how will he be revealed in this age by
[1:18:34] the promised word for this age not the
[1:18:36] promised word of a previous age but the
[1:18:38] promised word for this age will be god
[1:18:40] revealing himself
[1:18:43] now if you want to get somebody to a
[1:18:46] church or to a denomination or or to
[1:18:48] understanding that's fine to go to a
[1:18:50] previous manifestation
[1:18:52] but if you want to connect people to god
[1:18:54] you must bring them to a current
[1:18:55] manifestation
[1:18:57] a current revelation
[1:18:59] so you can see many people are content
[1:19:01] just attaching people to a denomination
[1:19:05] attaching people to a church to a
[1:19:07] ministry that that's fine if that's the
[1:19:09] objective then you can attach people to
[1:19:12] previous life it's not that that wasn't
[1:19:14] true it's absolutely the truth nobody's
[1:19:16] going to say it's a lie
[1:19:18] it's the truth but god is revealed
[1:19:22] god has revealed in every age by his
[1:19:24] promised word to that age and if you
[1:19:26] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:19:28] see see the whole principle we must move
[1:19:30] when god moves and we must be where his
[1:19:33] expressed word is being manifest and
[1:19:35] vindicated and where it's being manifest
[1:19:37] brings god's thought his life comes all
[1:19:40] the way down through that channel
[1:19:44] revelation 1 1
[1:19:46] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:19:48] gave unto him
[1:19:50] to show unto his servants things which
[1:19:52] must shortly come to pass and he sent
[1:19:54] and signified it by his angel unto his
[1:19:56] servant john
[1:19:58] this is the opening of the book of
[1:20:00] revelation
[1:20:01] so what is the book of revelation the
[1:20:03] revelation of jesus christ
[1:20:05] brother branham says i believe it's in
[1:20:06] the church age he said many say the
[1:20:08] revelation of john he said it's not the
[1:20:10] revelation of john it's the revelation
[1:20:12] of jesus christ so the rev the book of
[1:20:15] revelation this is why amen it was a
[1:20:18] book of symbols that had been probed at
[1:20:20] for generations but nobody could unlock
[1:20:22] the mysteries in the book of revelation
[1:20:25] because
[1:20:26] because god was going to send a prophet
[1:20:28] in the end time to bring the revelation
[1:20:31] of the entire scripture in the opening
[1:20:32] of the seals and that prophet was going
[1:20:35] to be the one who opened the book of
[1:20:37] revelation amen and had the correct
[1:20:39] interpretation of the symbols
[1:20:42] so the revelation of jesus christ so the
[1:20:45] book of revelation could not be revealed
[1:20:47] until the end time it took the seventh
[1:20:50] angel amen because he said he sent and
[1:20:52] signified it by his angel to his servant
[1:20:54] john
[1:20:56] so it took his angel to come and bring
[1:20:58] it to his servant john
[1:21:01] so in the end time the seventh angel
[1:21:03] amen will unlock
[1:21:05] the mystery the revelation of jesus
[1:21:07] christ which will unlock the entire
[1:21:09] bible
[1:21:11] and the book of revelation contains that
[1:21:14] mystery
[1:21:16] so the book of revelation
[1:21:18] caps off the entire bible
[1:21:21] or i would say it this way the book of
[1:21:23] revelation seals the bible
[1:21:26] because it's the last book of the bible
[1:21:29] but through a prophetic ministry in our
[1:21:30] day he's going to give us the revelation
[1:21:32] of jesus christ which is the unsealing
[1:21:34] of the book of revelation
[1:21:36] and when the book of revelation is
[1:21:37] unsealed it unseals the entire bible
[1:21:42] that's
[1:21:43] the open book
[1:21:44] that's the open word
[1:21:48] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:21:50] he has showed or revealed it in every
[1:21:52] type that's in the bible therefore the
[1:21:54] entire bible is the revelation of god's
[1:21:56] mystery in christ
[1:21:59] the entire bible is an expression of one
[1:22:01] goal that god had
[1:22:02] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:22:04] entire bible and all the acts of the
[1:22:06] believers in the bible has been in type
[1:22:08] and expressing what god's great goal is
[1:22:10] and now in this last day he has revealed
[1:22:13] it and shows it and god's help well
[1:22:16] you'll see it right here this morning
[1:22:18] what the lord has had in his mind all
[1:22:20] along
[1:22:21] and has expressed it
[1:22:24] the message shalom he says rise
[1:22:26] and shine
[1:22:28] for the light has come to you
[1:22:30] the word light is vindicated
[1:22:32] the only way as god was jesus christ was
[1:22:35] the manifestation of god's spoken word
[1:22:38] the light of the hour
[1:22:40] john the baptist was the light of the
[1:22:42] hour he was the light before jesus was
[1:22:44] light the prophet isaiah said a voice of
[1:22:46] one crying in the wilderness prepare the
[1:22:48] way of the lord and make straight his
[1:22:49] path that was the spoken word of god
[1:22:52] it was laying there hadn't come to life
[1:22:54] yet malachi the last prophet 400 years
[1:22:57] before it taken place he said behold i
[1:23:00] send my messenger before me to prepare
[1:23:02] the way of the lord
[1:23:03] here come one out of the wilderness with
[1:23:05] the without denomination without creed
[1:23:08] without identification
[1:23:10] but his light identified him
[1:23:13] the word identified him they said are
[1:23:15] you the messiah he said i'm not but i'm
[1:23:17] the voice of one crying in the
[1:23:18] wilderness prepare the way of the lord
[1:23:21] jesus said you did walk in his light
[1:23:25] so that means john had light
[1:23:27] because he was the manifested word for
[1:23:30] that hour
[1:23:31] and there was
[1:23:32] light and jesus even declared he said
[1:23:35] you did walk in his light he was a
[1:23:38] bright and shining light for a while
[1:23:42] why
[1:23:43] until the wave was prepared then his
[1:23:45] light went out
[1:23:46] the light transferred to the current
[1:23:49] manifestation
[1:23:51] which was jesus christ the son of god
[1:23:54] so it wasn't that john didn't have light
[1:23:56] john was the light
[1:23:59] but that light was going to transfer
[1:24:02] to the word made flesh for that season
[1:24:07] brother says you can't walk in that
[1:24:10] light you baptist referring back to john
[1:24:12] the baptist
[1:24:13] this is the light of the hour the light
[1:24:15] has come rise and shine the word light
[1:24:18] word the manifested word of god
[1:24:20] identified is a light
[1:24:23] that is the light for this hour
[1:24:25] again in shalom he says but did you
[1:24:27] notice before the seven seals was
[1:24:29] revealed before the great mysterious
[1:24:31] light showed forth in the heavens up
[1:24:33] there at above out above tucson
[1:24:37] so what did brother banham call that
[1:24:38] cloud a light
[1:24:41] look at this again
[1:24:43] before that great mysterious light
[1:24:45] showed forth in the heavens up there
[1:24:47] above tucson flagstaff
[1:24:49] what's he saying light amen
[1:24:52] it's a light it was the light it's the
[1:24:54] light of the hour it's the light of the
[1:24:55] age it's the revelation of jesus christ
[1:24:58] it's the manifestation amen coming for a
[1:25:00] vindication to reveal the word for this
[1:25:03] hour the light is coming that's why he
[1:25:05] can preach and shalom rise and shine the
[1:25:07] light has come
[1:25:09] did you see that mysterious light in the
[1:25:11] sky
[1:25:12] amen while we were there brother fred
[1:25:15] two of these men the two men was with me
[1:25:17] that morning when i had been told months
[1:25:19] and months ahead of time what happened
[1:25:22] but both brother fred sofiman and
[1:25:23] brother gene norman sitting there this
[1:25:25] morning when it was there when the blast
[1:25:27] went off and not knowing these things
[1:25:29] would take place and he sent me back
[1:25:31] said that the time was at hand for these
[1:25:33] seven seals which held the seven
[1:25:35] mysteries of the entire bible was sealed
[1:25:37] in with those seven seals and how those
[1:25:40] angels down along the road messengers of
[1:25:43] the church ages
[1:25:44] opened to a certain part of that
[1:25:46] but in the seventh hour the seventh
[1:25:48] messenger that all these mysteries
[1:25:51] should be finished
[1:25:52] see the seventh earthly messenger this
[1:25:55] angel that he speaks of then was on
[1:25:57] earth an angel means messenger and then
[1:26:00] after that he saw another angel come
[1:26:02] down not the earthly angel that had been
[1:26:04] given the message here
[1:26:05] but another mighty angel come from
[1:26:07] heaven with a rainbow over him and set
[1:26:09] his foot on the land and see and swear
[1:26:11] by him that lives forever and ever time
[1:26:13] shall be no more sea but before he broke
[1:26:16] forth on those seven seals to reveal
[1:26:18] them that he showed miraculously
[1:26:21] miraculous
[1:26:22] he showed it first in the heavens
[1:26:25] so catch this statement brother
[1:26:27] branham's saying before he broke in on
[1:26:29] those seals to open which he showed at
[1:26:30] miraculous and the opening of the seals
[1:26:34] before that he showed it in heaven first
[1:26:37] that light that mysterious light
[1:26:40] that day they took pictures all across
[1:26:43] southern united states and mexico there
[1:26:45] it hangs now in life magazine still a
[1:26:47] mystery to them
[1:26:49] but he declares it in the heavens before
[1:26:51] he does it on earth
[1:26:53] he always does that he shows his signs
[1:26:56] in the heavens first
[1:26:59] what's he coming to he's coming to give
[1:27:01] the revelation of the seven seals he's
[1:27:03] coming to open the seals
[1:27:06] but before he comes to do what he's
[1:27:08] going to do he shows the sign in the
[1:27:10] heaven first there's a mysterious light
[1:27:12] there
[1:27:13] and we see it as the cloud brother bear
[1:27:15] said it hangs in life magazine yet what
[1:27:17] is it it's the capping off of the church
[1:27:19] it's the capstone
[1:27:22] we know the capping the final word the
[1:27:24] capstone revelation
[1:27:26] is coming down upon the earth
[1:27:30] and brother branham was told a few
[1:27:31] months later to take the picture and
[1:27:34] turn it to the right
[1:27:36] and he took the picture and he said turn
[1:27:38] it right and he turned it to the right
[1:27:40] and he said there's christ
[1:27:42] see his eye see his nose see his mouth
[1:27:45] now remember
[1:27:46] this was the sign he showed in heaven's
[1:27:48] first before he did it on earth
[1:27:51] so then what's he going to do amen bring
[1:27:54] a revelation of seven new doctrines and
[1:27:56] you've got to study the seven no what's
[1:27:58] happening he's revealing the headship
[1:28:01] christ it's christ the opening of the
[1:28:03] seventh seals the sign shows what he's
[1:28:06] going to do on earth what's he going to
[1:28:07] do on earth he's bringing christ to the
[1:28:10] church amen all of christ the full mind
[1:28:13] of christ the full revelation of the
[1:28:15] entire bible is coming to earth to unite
[1:28:19] with the body with the bride that's what
[1:28:21] the sign declares the capstone is christ
[1:28:25] it's the finishing of the bible
[1:28:27] it's the opening of revelation which the
[1:28:29] book of revelation is the revelation of
[1:28:31] jesus christ but when he turned it to
[1:28:33] the right he recognized who it was that
[1:28:35] was coming it's the one the revelation
[1:28:38] is all about amen what is those seals
[1:28:41] christ christ is he's the one who opened
[1:28:43] those seals he is those seals what is
[1:28:45] the opening of the seals revealing turn
[1:28:47] it to the right
[1:28:50] that's what the opening of the seals was
[1:28:52] showing who could open the seals when he
[1:28:54] could open the seals why he opened the
[1:28:56] seals and who it was the sign shows when
[1:29:00] he opened those seals it opened the
[1:29:02] entire bible
[1:29:04] and the headship the mind the
[1:29:07] intelligence the understanding
[1:29:09] the identification
[1:29:13] take out your wallet and get your id
[1:29:17] how much of your body is shown in your
[1:29:19] id
[1:29:22] that's why brother branham says what
[1:29:24] identification this is identifying what
[1:29:27] this word is this opening of the seven
[1:29:29] seals was the revealing of christ
[1:29:32] and it unlocked the entire bible to show
[1:29:35] us the great plan of god from before the
[1:29:38] foundation of the world all the way
[1:29:39] through and every scripture speaks of
[1:29:42] christ
[1:29:44] and when he come down
[1:29:46] he come to declare himself
[1:29:49] it wasn't new doctrines
[1:29:51] to have new doctrines
[1:29:54] it was giving us a spiritual
[1:29:56] understanding and a scriptural
[1:29:58] understanding of the day and the hour
[1:30:00] that we lived in
[1:30:02] and peeling back the mystery and we'll
[1:30:04] get to that maybe next time peeling back
[1:30:06] the mystery of the previous 2000 years
[1:30:08] and beyond
[1:30:10] so that we would understand
[1:30:13] but before he did it on earth he showed
[1:30:15] it in heaven
[1:30:16] the question is what did he show in
[1:30:18] heaven
[1:30:20] he showed it was the headship
[1:30:22] the mind
[1:30:24] the capstone the finish
[1:30:26] the finishing of the church was coming
[1:30:29] the completing of the word was coming
[1:30:31] down
[1:30:32] the finishing of the revelation and
[1:30:34] manifestation was coming
[1:30:36] the the seven angels
[1:30:39] made his wig
[1:30:41] what are the seven angels showed the
[1:30:43] seven
[1:30:44] the seven ages all completed
[1:30:47] what is this it's the completion of all
[1:30:49] seven ages it's the finishing of his
[1:30:51] whole work through the new testament
[1:30:55] making
[1:30:56] outlining the headship
[1:30:58] what was those seven angels outlining
[1:31:00] they were framing the headship
[1:31:03] so that you would see christ
[1:31:05] in the revelation of this day
[1:31:09] that's why
[1:31:10] if we
[1:31:11] if we get in this message and all we can
[1:31:14] see
[1:31:14] is god sent a prophet all we can see is
[1:31:16] brother branham you haven't seen the
[1:31:18] sign yet
[1:31:20] you don't know what the opening of the
[1:31:21] seals was about you haven't turned the
[1:31:22] picture to the right
[1:31:27] why would brother branham have to come
[1:31:29] back when christ has already come
[1:31:32] what do you come back for the headship's
[1:31:34] here
[1:31:35] the identification is here identifying
[1:31:37] who this body is and what did the
[1:31:39] identification come to do the headship
[1:31:41] come down to identify his body his bride
[1:31:45] how did he identify his bride amen by
[1:31:48] bringing a revelation upon the earth and
[1:31:51] that revelation when it's received is an
[1:31:53] identification when you receive the
[1:31:55] headship identifies you as part of the
[1:31:58] body
[1:31:59] this headship is your identification
[1:32:01] amen this message is christ it is your
[1:32:04] identification it identifies you as
[1:32:06] bride how does it identify me as bride i
[1:32:08] never spoke in tongues i never saw a
[1:32:11] vision you saw christ amen you saw
[1:32:14] christ in this message you saw the
[1:32:16] opening of the seven seals you saw the
[1:32:18] entire bible ripped wide open and you
[1:32:21] believed all of it
[1:32:23] that is the identification of the bride
[1:32:25] that headship coming down
[1:32:29] if somebody tries to make the
[1:32:30] identification some other kind of
[1:32:32] identification they've missed the
[1:32:34] identification that's coming this hour
[1:32:36] and it opened up the entire bible
[1:32:39] and you've been identified with him
[1:32:42] your bridegroom your headship
[1:32:47] zechariah 4 7
[1:32:49] who art thou o great mountain before
[1:32:51] zerubbabel
[1:32:52] thou shalt become a plain and he shall
[1:32:55] bring forth the headstone thereof with
[1:32:57] shoutings crying grace
[1:32:59] grace unto him
[1:33:02] why will he shout grace grace because
[1:33:04] until then amen there's doubts amen
[1:33:06] there's questions there's there's who is
[1:33:09] the bride what is the church is it this
[1:33:11] denomination that denomination this
[1:33:13] understanding who's right who's wrong
[1:33:15] where do i go how do i know that this is
[1:33:18] the original thought becoming
[1:33:20] manifestation how do i find light
[1:33:24] so what god did is he brought the light
[1:33:27] he showed the light he showed it in the
[1:33:29] heavens before he brought it through the
[1:33:31] preaching
[1:33:33] what is it
[1:33:34] it's your identification
[1:33:37] you are identified with your headshed
[1:33:42] oh

[1:33:46] somebody can say you have to understand
[1:33:47] this and you've got to understand that
[1:33:49] you have to have this manifestation you
[1:33:50] have to have this
[1:33:52] you have to have this level of cleaned
[1:33:54] up life
[1:33:58] even after the revelation brother
[1:34:00] branham he still lied to the lawyer did
[1:34:03] he have a level of purified life that
[1:34:05] proved that he had united with the
[1:34:06] headship
[1:34:08] do you believe he united with the
[1:34:09] headship
[1:34:10] yes
[1:34:12] it was the holy ghost that brought him
[1:34:13] to a repentance
[1:34:17] that's why we look at this headstone
[1:34:18] coming down and and jerubal was crying
[1:34:22] bringing the heads on with shoutings of
[1:34:23] grace grace unto it and i say grace
[1:34:26] grace marvelous grace we now know the
[1:34:28] truth and we know who god is we know who
[1:34:31] christ is we know where he can be found
[1:34:33] we know how to embrace him we know how
[1:34:35] to weep at his feet we know how to wash
[1:34:37] his feet with our tears and our hair
[1:34:39] what is he he is this anointed word that
[1:34:42] has been delivered to us the headship
[1:34:43] has come down and we know where to
[1:34:45] embrace him we know where to worship him
[1:34:47] we know where to love him
[1:34:49] grace grace
[1:34:52] and that identification becomes my
[1:34:54] identification
[1:34:56] and i want to read this scripture again

[1:35:12] it's amazing grace
[1:35:15] you didn't earn the revelation
[1:35:18] you didn't decide that you were going to
[1:35:20] become a message believer many of you
[1:35:23] didn't even know what a message was
[1:35:26] never heard of it before didn't even
[1:35:28] know what a term message was didn't know
[1:35:30] that there were seven seals to be opened

[1:35:35] revelation of jesus christ had no idea
[1:35:38] that the book of revelation was the yeah
[1:35:40] we had no idea what was it it was his
[1:35:43] grace and bringing that identification
[1:35:45] and something inside of you was
[1:35:47] triggered by the spirit of god that said
[1:35:49] that ain't nothing but the truth brother
[1:35:50] branham
[1:35:52] that is my lord up there he said what is
[1:35:54] it that's my lord up there and something

[1:35:59] that's some kind of funny para
[1:36:01] paranormal event we have to explain it
[1:36:03] but you said when he said that's my lord

[1:36:25] but what he had in his mind before the
[1:36:28] foundation of the world has come to be
[1:36:29] made manifest
[1:36:31] and when you find yourself by faith as
[1:36:33] part of that
