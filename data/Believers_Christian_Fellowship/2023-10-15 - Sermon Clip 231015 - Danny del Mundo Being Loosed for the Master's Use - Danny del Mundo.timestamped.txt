[0:00] some might have been thinking it's too
[0:02] early to share that original Scene It
[0:04] Might stumble them so but I felt led to
[0:07] share it amen but the Father the father
[0:10] of uh uh of brother Chiba amen he
[0:16] was
[0:18] seriously hearing what every bit of
[0:22] detail I was sharing and uh through the
[0:24] scripture and immediately after that he
[0:27] said I have been I have been believing
[0:31] it was really not an apple amen amen but
[0:35] now it is scripturally
[0:38] clear amen and the whole family accepted
[0:41] the message amen the the father brother
[0:44] Chiba died his his mother remains
[0:47] faithful in the message and then brother
[0:49] Chiba married of my my my youngest uh
[0:53] sister-in-law and now we have another
[0:55] church brother Chiba is pastoring
[0:57] another church amen the the Church of my
[1:00] former uh uh uh uh Pastor uh uh it
[1:03] remains intact until now amen so why but
[1:08] people amen could think oh you're you're
[1:11] all Fanatics and everything amen but you
[1:13] come to think of that there are people
[1:15] who are really
[1:17] predestinated because they could they
[1:19] the seed in them could recognize the
[1:22] word amen hallelujah so that's why in
[1:25] Revelation 3:14 I believe he said uh WR
[1:30] this thing sayth the amen amen write
[1:33] this thing sayth the amen so our amen is
[1:37] not just our expression because we get
[1:40] excited or the the man the woman beside
[1:43] us say amen and we say Amen too amen but
[1:46] actually the amen is a person in
[1:49] Revelation 3:14 amen he said uh uh write
[1:53] this thing sayth the amen so the amen is
[1:57] a person amen that that that will
[2:01] recognize himself that will recognize
[2:04] the word amen so that amening in you is
[2:08] the part of him the part of the word
[2:11] recognizing the word amen write this
[2:14] things sayth the amen so your amen is
[2:18] the person of himself in you recognizing
[2:21] the word in your day Hallelujah write
[2:24] this thing sayth the
[2:28] amen who is the amen the beginning of
[2:31] the creation of God the faithful and
[2:34] true
[2:35] witness he was just he there he knew
[2:39] everything amen so he knows that that
[2:42] Amen in you amen is the same person the
[2:46] same God the same word that's why he
[2:49] recognized
[2:51] [Applause]
[2:52] himself so remember that when you say
[2:55] Amen it's not you when you're the one
[2:58] amening to the word it's you you're just
[3:00] excited but when he the person in
[3:04] you amen urge you say
[3:10] Amen
