[15:06] your name for your worthy Lord while we
[15:09] just pray now that as we come to the
[15:11] this portion of the service Lord where
[15:14] we look into your word I pray you would
[15:15] take absolute control
[15:17] that you would take these lips of clay
[15:19] under your control and speak Eternal
[15:21] words of life through them give us
[15:24] instruction for Life Lord the word that
[15:26] we have need of to overcome in this day
[15:28] God may we yield ourselves to you and
[15:30] receive all that you have for us may
[15:33] take preeminence Among Us and may you be
[15:35] glorified and always say and do for we
[15:38] are your children Lord and we're
[15:39] trusting in you in Jesus Christ name we
[15:42] pray amen
[15:45] amen God bless you and while we're
[15:47] standing let's take our Bibles and turn
[15:48] to First Peter
[15:50] First Peter chapter 1 we're going to
[15:53] continue on with the thought we were on
[15:55] on Sunday which was holy unto the Lord
[15:58] this will be part two
[16:01] and we'll begin reading this is the same
[16:04] opening scripture that we used
[16:06] uh Sunday First Peter chapter one
[16:10] verse 13.
[16:12] First Peter chapter 1 verse 13.
[16:14] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[16:16] be sober
[16:19] be sober and hope to the end for the
[16:21] grace that is to be brought unto you at
[16:23] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[16:26] as obedient children not fashioning
[16:29] yourselves according to the former lust
[16:31] in your ignorance but as he which hath
[16:34] called you is Holy so be holy in all
[16:38] manner of conversation because it is
[16:40] written be holy for I am Holy amen God
[16:44] bless you as you see them
[16:48] amen
[16:49] I'm going to continue with this thought
[16:52] and that take it to the next part and
[16:54] and this is where we ended Sunday but I
[16:57] want to continue on with where we ended
[16:58] brother Frank if you could go ahead and
[17:00] bring up the white board I'll use that
[17:02] and I think we saved the the
[17:05] drawing that I had on there the words
[17:07] that I held on there from last week and
[17:08] we'll begin with that so the scripture
[17:12] says be holy for I am Holy amen God is
[17:16] Holy and he wants us to be holy amen and
[17:19] and when we talked about holy unto the
[17:21] Lord last time we talked about some of
[17:23] the wrong ideas carried over from
[17:25] denominationalism about Holiness right
[17:27] we had the the wrong concept and I don't
[17:30] know about all of you but I speak for
[17:32] myself many times I had the wrong idea
[17:34] of what it meant to be holy or to walk
[17:37] in Holiness amen I had more of a
[17:40] legalistic idea growing up that to be
[17:43] holy was to be perfect with no flaw
[17:45] completely sinless and in a perfect
[17:48] state but that's not really what it
[17:50] means to be holy amen that's not exactly
[17:53] what it means really what it means is to
[17:56] be set apart Amen to be to be set apart
[17:59] or to be sacred and so we saw this is uh
[18:02] the two words I put up here and I got
[18:04] these from the the Old Testament from
[18:06] the words that are used holy are
[18:08] Sanctified or sanctifieth uh holy you
[18:12] can be can mean to be sacred or set
[18:15] apart and so we we talked about that
[18:17] last week how God himself is Holy in
[18:21] himself within himself he is Holy amen
[18:24] but God called the children of Israel to
[18:26] be a holy nation amen and they weren't
[18:28] holy within themselves they were holy
[18:30] because he set them apart he selected
[18:33] them out of all Nations to be set apart
[18:35] for him that made them holy right then
[18:38] out of the the 12 tribes he selected One
[18:41] Tribe the Levites to be the priest and
[18:44] made them holy which means set apart for
[18:47] the office of the priesthood
[18:49] amen right
[18:50] and then our and for the Levites to take
[18:53] care of the Tabernacle to do all of
[18:54] those works but then out of the Levites
[18:57] he chose Aaron and his children and to
[18:59] be in the order of the priests and to
[19:01] the high priest amen so they were holy
[19:03] unto the Lord it didn't mean that they
[19:06] were perfect without flaw and it didn't
[19:08] mean they were holy within themselves
[19:10] but they were made Holy by God's choice
[19:13] by God setting them apart and
[19:15] consecrating them for a purpose that
[19:17] made them holy
[19:19] so when we look at to be holy it's to be
[19:22] sacred or to be set apart
[19:25] and then to sanctify
[19:27] is to separate to sanctify as the act of
[19:31] separating
[19:32] or to be separate sometimes when they
[19:35] say sanctify or sanctify means it's
[19:38] separated
[19:40] or to consecrate so if something's
[19:43] consecrated it's Sanctified it's
[19:46] Sanctified for that purpose and you know
[19:48] we talked about we we have Sanctified
[19:50] this Sanctuary for the worship of God
[19:53] that's all we do in here it's Sanctified
[19:55] it's set aside it's consecrated it's set
[19:58] apart for that purpose and so it's
[20:00] Sanctified for that purpose it's not
[20:03] Sanctified it's not holy it's not
[20:05] consecrated because of the fabric of the
[20:07] carpet or the chairs right we went
[20:09] through all of that we understand that
[20:11] it's not holy in itself it's not sacred
[20:14] in itself or Sanctified in itself it's
[20:16] Sanctified because of the purpose all
[20:19] right so that's where we were and so
[20:21] we're going to move on from there
[20:24] so I want to look at a couple words that
[20:27] we're going to find in the New Testament
[20:28] and so I want to write these down again
[20:30] and refer to these so in the New
[20:34] Testament this word in First Peter 1
[20:36] with this passage we read First Peter 1
[20:38] 13 and we find it in verse 15 and 16
[20:41] when it says holy he which called you is
[20:45] Holy so be you holy in all manner
[20:46] conversation this word holy is the
[20:50] English word
[20:51] holy well
[20:54] I'm gonna I'm gonna move that out of
[20:57] here
[20:58] and try again
[21:04] so this English word holy
[21:08] it means
[21:13] that
[21:22] which
[21:25] is
[21:26] holy
[21:30] okay it doesn't tell you how it became
[21:33] holy
[21:34] it's just that it is Holy
[21:37] this word is used
[21:39] 161 times in the New Testament for Holy
[21:42] the majority of that is Holy Ghost or
[21:44] holy spirit so we talk about holy ghost
[21:46] or holy spirit it's holy within itself
[21:49] it's holy it's it's it is Holy but it's
[21:53] used 61 time it's it's 61 times it's
[21:57] translated Saints
[21:59] so the children of God the Saints in the
[22:01] New Testament they're holy
[22:04] but they're not holy within themselves
[22:06] they've been made holy amen they're holy
[22:09] because God chose them God elected them
[22:11] God selected them God cleansed them God
[22:13] set them apart for his purpose that made
[22:16] them holy amen
[22:18] so holy in the New Testament is that
[22:20] which is holy but it doesn't tell you
[22:22] how it became holy it's either holy in
[22:25] itself it's translated four times as the
[22:27] Holy One referring to Jesus Christ he's
[22:30] holy the Holy Ghost is Holy the holy God
[22:33] is Holy amen the Saints are holy
[22:37] amen but we've been made Holy by his
[22:41] selection and for his purpose
[22:43] amen that's important so then there's
[22:46] another word
[22:47] and sometimes these words are used
[22:49] interchangeably the that they're not
[22:51] always holy or Holiness is attached to
[22:54] the same Greek word they're used
[22:56] somewhat interchangeably so but I'm just
[22:58] going to write it down in the main usage
[23:00] just for clarity of understanding
[23:04] so I want to write down
[23:06] the word
[23:10] sanctify
[23:14] the word sanctify
[23:17] means
[23:24] to separate
[23:28] and
[23:33] dedicate
[23:36] to God
[23:39] to separate and to dedicate to God
[23:42] now it's it's got another usage in the
[23:45] New Testament I'm not going to write
[23:46] down because this thing's not working
[23:48] really well and that's got a long delay
[23:50] but but when you look at this word it
[23:53] means to separate and dedicate to God
[23:55] and either render or acknowledge it to
[24:00] be Hollow or sacred so either you either
[24:03] you're rendering it or making it to be
[24:05] Hollow or sacred or acknowledging that
[24:09] it is hollow or sacred that's what this
[24:11] word sanctify can mean and we'll get
[24:13] into that in a minute you'll understand
[24:14] what what it is the third one that we're
[24:17] going to look at
[24:22] is sanctification
[24:29] and that means to consecrate
[24:36] or
[24:38] purify
[24:41] all right so these three words are used
[24:43] in the New Testament they're used
[24:45] somewhat interchangeably so we're going
[24:46] to get into this and look at it let's
[24:48] look at First Peter chapter 2 and verse
[24:51] 9.
[24:54] it says but you are a chosen generation
[24:57] a royal priesthood a holy nation A
[25:00] peculiar people that you should show
[25:01] forth the Praises of him who have called
[25:03] you out of Darkness into this Marvelous
[25:05] Light so here it says you are a holy
[25:07] nation and he is referring to the
[25:09] Gentiles that have now come to Christ
[25:11] they are a holy nation so before he says
[25:14] be holy for I am Holy God is Holy amen
[25:18] but you're to be holy by him choosing
[25:21] you and calling you out and separating
[25:22] you and sanctifying you he is making you
[25:25] holy he made the Gentiles who are not a
[25:27] people a people and he made them Holy by
[25:30] his purpose amen by setting them apart
[25:32] for his purpose this is what God has
[25:34] done amen
[25:36] and so that they are holy because God
[25:39] made them holy I mean because of his
[25:42] purpose now let's turn to Second
[25:44] Thessalonians
[25:46] and keep your Bibles handy I want to go
[25:48] to several scriptures and read several
[25:49] scriptures like we did on Sunday 2nd
[25:52] Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13.
[25:58] but we are bound to give thanks always
[26:00] to God for you brother and beloved of
[26:02] the Lord because God hath from the
[26:04] beginning chosen you to Salvation
[26:06] through sanctification of the spirit and
[26:09] belief of the truth this word
[26:11] sanctification when it says here through
[26:13] sanctification of the spirit this
[26:15] sanctification is that last one that we
[26:17] wrote down consecration or purifier
[26:20] purification amen so God has chosen you
[26:24] Amen to Salvation
[26:27] through sanctification or purification
[26:30] of the spirit and belief of the truth
[26:32] this is where brother bam talks about
[26:34] amen this second work of Grace and I'll
[26:38] read it again out of birth pains he said
[26:39] so it is in the spiritual realm it's
[26:41] water justification by faith believing
[26:44] on God receiving him as your personal
[26:46] Savior and being baptized second is
[26:49] sanctification of the spirit that God
[26:51] cleanses the spirit from all elements of
[26:53] the world and the desire of the world
[26:56] and then the Holy Spirit comes in and
[26:58] gives New Birth and fills up the
[27:00] Sanctified vessel for instance like this
[27:03] now that I told you what you don't uh uh
[27:06] what you don't believe lay aside then
[27:08] take the pie notice a glass is laying
[27:10] out in the chicken yarn you don't just
[27:11] pick that up and put it on your table
[27:13] and fill it up with water or milk no you
[27:15] pick it up it's justification cleansing
[27:18] it is sanctification because the Greek
[27:20] word sanctifies a compound words means
[27:22] cleansed and set aside for service not
[27:25] in service for service then when you
[27:27] fill it it is put in service so this is
[27:31] all God making something holy first he
[27:34] accuses it by his own election and draws
[27:36] it to himself and when you come to that
[27:38] understanding that's your justification
[27:40] recognizing that God is calling you amen
[27:43] and then God Amen will sanctify he'll
[27:46] bring you through a process of
[27:47] purification amen where he says where he
[27:50] cleanses the spirit from all elements of
[27:52] the world he's doing a work in your
[27:54] spirit Realm
[27:56] amen and then thirdly so that's to
[27:59] cleanse and set aside for service
[28:01] remember holy in the Holy in the Old
[28:04] Testament was to set apart this is the
[28:06] process God is bringing us through
[28:08] because he wants us to be a holy people
[28:10] amen the Saints and the New Testament
[28:12] are holy God is called holy and the
[28:15] Saints are called by the same word so
[28:17] whatever he is they are he's bringing
[28:19] them to a process amen of purification
[28:22] amen our consecration so that he can
[28:26] pour himself his Spirit into them bring
[28:29] them to a new birth burn out all of Amen
[28:31] all over the world Amen and bring the
[28:34] seed of God to life so his life lives in
[28:36] them and now they are holy set aside
[28:39] amen sacred amen they are a hallowed
[28:42] vessel because God is working through
[28:44] them
[28:45] they're put into service amen so this
[28:47] word sanctification is consecration or
[28:50] to purify and this is what God is doing
[28:52] to make his children holy
[28:56] amen
[29:00] and let's let's look at First Peter
[29:01] again let's go back to First Peter
[29:03] chapter one we're going to see the same
[29:04] exact word used again in First Peter
[29:07] chapter one
[29:08] verse 2.
[29:11] he says in First Peter 1 and 2 elect
[29:13] according to the foreknowledge of God
[29:15] the Father through sanctification of the
[29:18] spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of
[29:21] the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you
[29:23] and peace be multiplied amen so God is
[29:27] going to do this purification work in
[29:30] you because he's chosen you to be holy
[29:35] like he chose Israel to be holy like he
[29:38] chose Levites to be holy like he chose
[29:40] Aaron to be holy he chose you to be holy
[29:43] amen only now in order for you to be
[29:46] holy he's got to do a work in your
[29:49] spirit realm amen
[29:51] and that's a work of Consecration and
[29:53] purification
[29:55] this is how brother Brown says it in
[29:56] future home he says then secondly he's
[29:58] talking about the second work of Grace
[30:00] then secondly comes sanctification which
[30:03] sets our mind in order for holiness
[30:06] see brother man when he's talking about
[30:08] this second work of Grace he's talking
[30:09] about gone doing a cleaning work in your
[30:12] spirit realm amen so that he can bring
[30:15] something deeper into the soul he's got
[30:18] to do a work in the spirit realm take
[30:20] away the desires for sin amen do a work
[30:23] and set your mind in order for holiness
[30:28] to think right he said I'll read that
[30:30] again secondly comes sanctification
[30:31] which sets our mind in order for
[30:33] Holiness to think right amen this
[30:35] sanctification begins the process of
[30:37] getting us to think right we used to
[30:39] think like the world thought amen what
[30:42] was normal to the world was normal to us
[30:44] amen the deeds and the actions and
[30:46] everything everybody else did was normal
[30:47] but then God Amen will call us to
[30:50] himself and plucks us out of the Heap of
[30:53] humanity and we recognize his calling us
[30:56] and we when we we yield to that call and
[30:59] then he begins to do a work in the
[31:00] spirit realm setting our mind and
[31:02] Holiness so that we can even begin to
[31:04] think right we begin to recognize this
[31:07] is wrong and this is wrong and this is
[31:09] wrong and this is wrong
[31:12] that's the work that he's doing
[31:15] he's sanctification is a compound Greek
[31:18] words which means cleansed and set aside
[31:20] for service then the next comes the
[31:22] baptism of fire in the Holy Ghost that
[31:24] God might dwell in us and the fire of
[31:27] God cleanses our hearts from sin and
[31:29] puts the Holy Ghost Inside then we bring
[31:32] forth the same life that this did
[31:34] because that's him I say Amen
[31:36] so now he's going deeper amen
[31:40] justification is saying you're mine your
[31:43] whole being is mine I'm calling you to
[31:45] myself but then he starts working
[31:46] setting our mind in order amen cleansing
[31:49] our spirit realm so that he can burn out
[31:52] the world burn out the sin nature from
[31:54] our soul amen and put the Holy Ghost
[31:57] Inside
[32:00] then we can be a saint
[32:03] holy
[32:05] set apart for his purpose and used in
[32:09] that purpose
[32:11] all right let's go back
[32:13] to Ephesians now
[32:29] it's amazing that we
[32:31] we go through things and we've we've
[32:34] learned these things the the prophet of
[32:36] God taught it we know some of these
[32:37] basic things and understand this for
[32:39] years amen but every time I find that I
[32:42] go through a subject again it just
[32:45] becomes more alive and more relevant in
[32:47] my understanding becomes a little bit
[32:49] deeper and and so the same thing with
[32:52] this in Ephesians 5 25
[32:55] I want to use this scripture and compare
[32:56] it to another
[32:58] it says Ephesians 5 25 husbands love
[33:01] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[33:03] church and gave himself for him that he
[33:05] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[33:07] washing of Water by the word that he
[33:10] might present it to himself a glorious
[33:12] church not having spot a wrinkle or any
[33:14] such thing but that it should be holy
[33:16] and without blemish so this is a work
[33:19] that God is doing right he wants a holy
[33:23] bride
[33:24] he's holy his wife must be holy so what
[33:27] is he going to do to make sure she's
[33:29] holy he's going to wash her cleanse her
[33:32] with the water of the word so he is so
[33:34] verse
[33:35] verse 26 that he might sanctify and
[33:38] cleanse it with the washing of Water by
[33:40] the word so this word sanctifies this
[33:43] middle word over here to separate and
[33:46] dedicate to God so he's washing her he's
[33:49] separating her by the word the word is
[33:52] bringing separation remember we talked
[33:55] about Sunday that is as soon as we
[33:58] choose one thing we it means we don't
[34:01] choose another
[34:03] the moment we come to the word and we
[34:05] recognize the word is truth there's a
[34:07] whole lot of things that's become untrue
[34:09] things that we thought were true habits
[34:12] that we had Lifestyles that we thought
[34:13] were okay when the minute that God
[34:16] reveals the word to us amen and we
[34:18] recognize that that is true when
[34:21] recognizing that is true it
[34:22] automatically brings a separation
[34:24] because if we will come to that word we
[34:26] must leave something else
[34:29] we must leave a former understanding we
[34:31] must leave a formal lifestyle a former
[34:33] habit but to come to the word so the
[34:36] word is bringing separation
[34:39] so it's cleansing us from the old ideas
[34:42] it's washing us it's washing old
[34:44] Concepts old ideas old habits away and
[34:48] so it's cutting the world away from us
[34:50] but he's that he might sanctify and
[34:52] cleanse it with the washing of Water by
[34:54] the word that he might present to
[34:56] himself a glorious church not having
[34:59] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[35:01] that it should be holy and without
[35:02] blemish so so Christ gave himself so
[35:06] that he could sanctify and cleanse the
[35:08] Brine and and wash her away this is the
[35:12] work that he is doing he's doing it by
[35:15] his word
[35:17] so this word sanctify means to separate
[35:20] the the uses that they give in the
[35:23] Scofield is to are the uh not the
[35:26] Scofield but Strong's Concordance to
[35:28] separate from profane things and
[35:30] dedicate to God to consecrate
[35:33] also to render or acknowledge something
[35:38] to be venerable or hallowed or sacred
[35:40] it's either to make it sacred or to
[35:44] acknowledge that it's sacred it can be
[35:46] used either way
[35:47] and in this case what he's doing is he's
[35:50] making her Sacred by separating her from
[35:53] the World by cutting her off and out
[35:55] cutting all things and washing all
[35:57] things away and setting her apart so
[36:00] that he can use her so she can be holy
[36:03] and Without Blame
[36:06] but I want to look at another use of the
[36:08] word so that we can get a full
[36:10] understanding same word let's go back to
[36:12] First Peter again
[36:14] only this time we'll go to First Peter
[36:16] chapter 3.
[36:19] First Peter chapter 3.
[36:23] and verse 13.
[36:32] who is he that will harm you if you be
[36:34] followers of that which is good
[36:37] but and if you suffer for righteousness
[36:39] sake happy or ye
[36:41] be not afraid of their Terror and either
[36:42] be troubled but sanctify the Lord God in
[36:46] your hearts
[36:49] sanctify the Lord God in your hearts
[36:52] does this mean that your
[36:55] to clean or purify the Lord
[36:59] no how can you purify the Lord
[37:02] this so remember the word means to
[37:05] render or acknowledge something to be
[37:08] venerable or hallowed or sacred
[37:10] this is acknowledging that he's holy
[37:14] acknowledging so the word can be so you
[37:17] see here this this word sanctify can be
[37:19] used both ways it's either to render it
[37:23] hollowed or Sanctified or sacred or to
[37:27] acknowledge that it is and in this usage
[37:29] it's but sanctify the Lord God in your
[37:31] heart God doesn't need you to purify him
[37:33] what God needs you to do is acknowledge
[37:35] that he's holy amen acknowledge that
[37:38] he's sacred and acknowledge Him in your
[37:40] heart amen
[37:43] so I want us to understand that because
[37:45] the one of the reasons that I want to
[37:47] look at this is because when we see that
[37:50] brother Benham took this word
[37:51] sanctification and he begins to show us
[37:53] the second work of Grace to where God
[37:55] will justify us by grace and he'll
[37:57] sanctifies setting our mind in order for
[37:59] Holiness and fill us then with his
[38:01] spirit and put us into service amen
[38:04] that's not the end of sanctification or
[38:07] being Sanctified or consecrated or set
[38:09] apart amen this goes on for life amen
[38:13] that's what I want us to understand that
[38:16] it's not as simple to say well I was I
[38:18] was saved Sanctified and filled with the
[38:20] Holy Ghost you're still being Sanctified
[38:22] amen you're still being consecrated to
[38:25] God there's a part that he does but
[38:27] there's a part that we do ourselves
[38:29] and so I want to look at that in the
[38:31] scripture so that we don't stay in only
[38:34] this part of the plan of God but we
[38:37] understand the whole plan of God when it
[38:39] comes to being Sanctified and being holy
[38:43] brother man goes on to say in broken
[38:45] sisters to me
[38:47] he is the Waters of the word of
[38:49] Separation that separates you from
[38:51] everything that's contrary to his word
[38:54] that's the fountain I believe in to be
[38:56] yes sir that's the waters that separated
[38:58] me from man-made cisterns to the
[39:00] Fountain of Living Water amen that water
[39:02] should still be separating us
[39:05] not just once amen now I'm filled with
[39:07] the Holy Ghost amen that water should
[39:10] still be separating us separating us
[39:12] from attitudes separating us from lust
[39:15] separating us from selfishness
[39:16] separating us from old Concepts this
[39:19] word should still be sanctifying us
[39:23] it should still bringing it should be
[39:25] bringing us into a greater consecration
[39:27] as we move on Amen we can't say the work
[39:31] of sanctification was already done that
[39:33] was God working in your mind so that he
[39:35] could get to your heart now that he's
[39:36] got to your heart amen he wants to live
[39:39] from there and serve his purpose but to
[39:41] do that you're going to have to stay in
[39:43] agreement with his purpose
[39:46] he set us aside and called us holy we
[39:49] must stay set aside
[39:52] God has never taken away free choice
[39:55] from us it's not that we went through
[39:56] this process we're born again and all of
[39:59] a sudden God ripped from us free choice
[40:00] Takes Over Us completely and now it
[40:03] doesn't matter what we want to do God's
[40:05] just doing whatever with us this is not
[40:07] how it works God put himself on
[40:09] partnership with man he remains on
[40:11] partnership with man God is faithful to
[40:13] his part but he's asking you to
[40:15] surrender and submit and stay Sanctified
[40:18] and stay consecrated
[40:22] and we'll see that clearly through the
[40:24] scripture
[40:26] now let's go to Hebrews chapter 12.
[40:33] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 5.
[40:42] and ye have forgotten exhortation with
[40:44] speaketh unto you as unto children my
[40:46] son despise not thou the chastening of
[40:49] the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked
[40:51] of him for whom the Lord loveth he
[40:53] chasteneth and Scourge us every son whom
[40:56] he receiveth
[40:57] if you endure chastening God dealeth
[40:59] with you as with sons for what son is he
[41:02] whom the father chasteneth not
[41:04] but if you be without chastisement
[41:06] whereof all our partakers then are you
[41:09] bastards and not Sons
[41:11] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[41:14] flesh which corrected us and we gave
[41:16] them reverence
[41:18] shall we not much rather be in
[41:20] subjection unto the father of spirits
[41:22] and live for they verily for a few days
[41:25] chastened us after their own pleasure
[41:27] but he for our Prophet that we might be
[41:31] partakers of his holiness
[41:34] God is helping us with our
[41:38] sanctification
[41:40] through chastisements
[41:42] right verse 11.
[41:45] now no chastening for the present
[41:47] seemeth to be joyous but Grievous
[41:50] nevertheless afterward that yielded the
[41:52] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[41:53] them which are exercised thereby
[41:56] wherefore lift up the hands which hang
[41:58] down in the feeble knees and make
[42:00] straight paths for your feet lest that
[42:02] which is lame be turned out of the way
[42:03] but let it rather be healed that's what
[42:06] this chastisement will do it'll heal
[42:08] that part in you that's going astray
[42:12] follow peace with all men in Holiness
[42:14] without which no man shall see the Lord
[42:17] looking diligently lest any man so it
[42:20] says verse 14 follow peace with all men
[42:22] and holiness
[42:24] all right follow peace and Holiness this
[42:28] word Holiness is this word
[42:29] sanctification
[42:31] Consecration and purify but this isn't
[42:34] the work that he did for you amen when
[42:38] he brought you to the bathroom the Holy
[42:39] Ghost he's telling you to follow after
[42:42] purification you follow after
[42:44] consecration
[42:46] now this is your part follow peace with
[42:48] all men and Holiness sanctification
[42:52] without which no man shall see the Lord
[42:56] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[42:59] the grace of God lest any root of
[43:00] bitterness spring up and trouble you and
[43:02] there might many be defiled
[43:05] so God the same word that's used for God
[43:09] sanctifying you by the spirit is telling
[43:12] you to you follow after this
[43:14] sanctification
[43:16] you strive for you follow after you
[43:19] follow consecration
[43:21] and the message here ye him he says this
[43:23] is the washing of the water Separation
[43:25] by the word the word that what washes us
[43:28] and cleanses us and sanctify them Father
[43:30] through the truth he said Thy word is
[43:33] truth is that rhyme and we're washed of
[43:35] the Waters of separation from our sins
[43:37] by the word of God the word separates us
[43:40] and sets us in place so now we we saw
[43:43] now when the word is revealed we have a
[43:46] choice to make and in choosing the word
[43:48] we automatically separate from something
[43:50] we separate from our sin we separate
[43:52] from our conduct we separate from our
[43:54] thinking but this word god also uses in
[43:58] chastisement
[44:00] has anybody ever been chastised and in
[44:02] the preaching of the word
[44:04] the word brings chastisement Amen in
[44:07] that chastisement is gone as a father
[44:10] amen wanting us to be a partaker of his
[44:12] Holiness he is bringing sanctification
[44:15] this is not just before the baptism of
[44:17] the Holy Ghost this is after the baptism
[44:20] of the Holy Ghost we are his child he is
[44:22] the father and he is making sure that by
[44:25] his word we either choose amen we always
[44:28] choose but we either see the word and
[44:30] come to it or he'll bring chastisement
[44:33] to break us away from the thing that's
[44:35] not the word to bring us in line with
[44:37] his word
[44:40] and no chastisement for the present is
[44:42] joyous but Grievous
[44:45] but it brings the Peaceable fruits of
[44:47] righteousness
[44:48] because he is a father wants us to go
[44:51] the right way so he'll use the word even
[44:54] in chastisement
[44:57] so let's go to Second Corinthians now
[44:59] chapter six
[45:05] second Corinthians chapter six
[45:08] this is another good old-fashioned Bible
[45:10] study
[45:12] second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 14.
[45:20] be not unequally yoked together with
[45:22] unbelievers
[45:24] for what Fellowship hath righteousness
[45:26] with unrighteousness and what communion
[45:28] hath light with darkness and what
[45:30] Concord hath Christ with below or what
[45:33] part hath he that believeth with an
[45:34] Infidel and what agreement hath the
[45:37] temple of God with Idols for ye are the
[45:39] Temple of of the Living God and God has
[45:42] said I will dwell in them and walk in
[45:44] them and I will be their God and they
[45:46] shall be my people therefore come out
[45:49] from among them and be ye separate saith
[45:51] the Lord and touch not the unclean thing
[45:53] and I will receive you and I will be a
[45:57] father unto you and you shall be his
[45:59] sons and daughters saith the Lord
[46:00] Almighty so God calls for separation
[46:05] to come out from among them what part do
[46:08] we have being unequally yoked with
[46:10] unbelief come out from among them amen
[46:13] and be ye separate that's why there was
[46:15] a call that came in Revelations 18 that
[46:18] says come out from among her my people
[46:20] amen and and brother Branham amen was
[46:23] the angel that God used to make that
[46:24] call and that's the call the bride is
[46:26] still calling come out amen don't be in
[46:29] those systems that are anti-word
[46:31] Antichrist but come out why come out be
[46:35] separate he's calling to holiness
[46:38] wants us to be a separated people
[46:42] separated from unbelief separated from
[46:44] sin separate why because we're holy
[46:49] what's it mean to be holy to be
[46:50] separated we're holy for his purpose
[46:54] in The Invisible union he says your
[46:57] first wedding was annulled
[47:00] it was you never done it in the first
[47:02] place because there's only one thing
[47:04] could do it that would be God come down
[47:07] himself and took your place in the form
[47:09] of the Son of God Jesus Christ and
[47:11] washed you by the water of the washing
[47:13] of the Water by the word the word not
[47:16] the denomination the word washed you
[47:20] why he wants you to be purified to be
[47:24] holy to be separated but listen to the
[47:26] next statement but if you won't stand in
[47:29] the water of the word how are you going
[47:32] to be washed
[47:33] you're still as spotted as Eve was
[47:36] so now we know that the second work of
[47:39] Grace is sanctification God dealing
[47:41] cleaning your spirit setting your mind
[47:43] in order for Holiness so he could fill
[47:45] you with himself so they could put you
[47:46] into service amen but he's now saying
[47:49] it's not just something that he's going
[47:51] to do he's done it he's given the word
[47:53] he's continually giving the word but if
[47:56] we won't stay in the washing of the word
[47:58] how are we going to be unspotted
[48:01] we have to stay surrendered to the word
[48:04] we have to stay in the washing of the
[48:07] word because he never takes free moral
[48:10] agency away
[48:12] we can never just say we can never just
[48:15] lay down and say if God wants me to be
[48:17] holy he'll make me holy he'll make you
[48:19] holy but you've got to stay under the
[48:21] word
[48:23] he'll he'll purify he'll consecrate
[48:26] he'll he'll he'll clean your life but
[48:29] you must stay under the cleaning agent
[48:31] and the cleaning agent is this word
[48:34] that's been given in this generation
[48:36] it has a purifying Force to purify and
[48:40] wash away the stains of the prostitute
[48:42] spirits that come through the
[48:43] nominationalism the stain of the world
[48:46] that brings out false ideas amen it has
[48:49] a purifying Force to wash away to set us
[48:52] apart for Holiness but we must stay
[48:55] under the word
[48:59] amen it's not a one-time thing it's a
[49:02] continual washing
[49:04] why do we keep coming back to church why
[49:06] do we keep reading books why do we keep
[49:08] reading our Bible why do we stay in
[49:10] prayer why do we keep playing the tapes
[49:12] so that we can stay under the washing of
[49:14] the water of the word to stay
[49:16] consecrated to stay Sanctified to stay
[49:20] separated
[49:23] praise God
[49:26] and I'm just going to read the scripture
[49:28] to John 17. you don't have to turn there
[49:30] amen John 17 17 I read it last time
[49:33] Jesus in Paris has sanctify them through
[49:35] thy truth
[49:37] Thy word is truth
[49:39] so this word sanctify
[49:42] amen is this uh oh I don't know which
[49:46] word it is
[49:50] yeah it's the same word the second one
[49:52] to separate and dedicate to God to
[49:55] render or to acknowledge something
[49:58] hallowed or sacred and he's saying
[50:01] sanctify them through the truth Thy word
[50:04] is truth
[50:06] as thou has sent me into the world even
[50:08] so have I also sent them into the world
[50:10] and for their sakes I sanctify myself
[50:14] that they also might be Sanctified
[50:16] through the truth so now Jesus is
[50:19] talking about
[50:20] sanctifying
[50:22] sanctifying the disciples being
[50:24] Sanctified by the word being purified
[50:26] then he's talking about sanctifying
[50:28] himself well these are two different
[50:30] usages of the same word one is to render
[50:34] or to make something hallowed or sacred
[50:37] and one is to separate amen and
[50:41] consecrate to God
[50:43] so he's saying sanctify them make them
[50:46] sacred through the washing of the word
[50:49] but he's saying and I sanctify he's
[50:51] saying I'm consecrating myself and
[50:54] dedicating myself to this purpose so
[50:55] that they can be rendered holy
[50:59] does that make sense the same word but
[51:02] two different usages and the same
[51:04] passage of scripture one is he I'm
[51:07] separating myself amen consecrating
[51:09] myself and dedicating myself for the
[51:11] purpose that you purpose me for so that
[51:15] the word can render them and make them
[51:18] purified and hollowed so that they can
[51:20] serve the purpose that you purpose them
[51:22] for
[51:24] so one in one sense of the word we are
[51:28] purified or we are rendered we are made
[51:31] amen hallowed are Sacred by the word and
[51:35] another sense of the word we are
[51:37] consecrating and dedicating ourselves
[51:39] for God's purpose
[51:41] one is him cleaning us and one is us
[51:44] staying consecrated
[51:46] and both of that is to sanctify it takes
[51:49] two parts God must do his part and we
[51:52] must do our part
[51:54] in the message adoption part three says
[51:56] oh Jesus was training 12 men that
[51:59] through these 12 men these 12 men was to
[52:01] take the gospel to the world he said for
[52:03] their sakes I sanctify myself make
[52:06] yourself for your neighbor's sake for
[52:09] somebody else's sake don't use your
[52:11] Liberty for a cloak said Paul but
[52:13] sanctify yourself behave yourself in the
[52:15] neighborhood like a real Christian ought
[52:17] to let your communication if you meet
[52:19] your enemy sanctify yourself for his
[52:22] sake not knowing what you might do amen
[52:25] so here this is this is not brother
[52:27] Benham saying amen God's work of
[52:29] sanctification will purify you for the
[52:31] baptism Holy Ghost no you already you're
[52:33] already in purpose you're already in use
[52:35] now sanctify yourself for somebody
[52:37] else's purpose
[52:39] now this is something we do
[52:43] that's what I want to talk about for the
[52:45] rest of the time we have this evening is
[52:47] what we do
[52:50] now remember
[52:52] we want we never want to lose track of
[52:54] how we started that the idea of Holiness
[52:57] the old denominational the old Methodist
[53:00] the old Nazarene uh the old Pilgrim
[53:03] Holiness idea of Holiness and the
[53:05] Holiness Pentecost which is what I came
[53:06] out of as a boy that idea won't work
[53:11] that idea that through deeds and
[53:13] conducts and obedience that I can become
[53:17] holy in my own effort
[53:20] of obeying and being kind and being kind
[53:22] and obeying the word and all of that no
[53:24] no that'll never you can never be holy
[53:26] till first he's designated you to be
[53:28] holy
[53:30] that's the first step he must be elected
[53:33] to that position you must be chosen by
[53:35] God you cannot Choose Yourself and say
[53:37] through conduct I'll be holy it'll never
[53:40] work
[53:41] is that right yeah but if we're ever if
[53:44] we're ever deemed holy it's because he
[53:47] deemed us holy amen and he made us holy
[53:50] and he chose us to be holy and he
[53:52] provided the word that will purify us
[53:54] and sanctifies so that we could be set
[53:56] apart to be a holy vessel unto him it's
[53:58] all got to be him first
[54:01] but that doesn't mean we're not supposed
[54:04] to obey the word
[54:06] but The Obedience of the word cannot
[54:09] make us holy
[54:11] all right so when I go into the second
[54:13] part I don't want any of us to slip into
[54:15] Old thinking this has nothing to do with
[54:17] us climbing into a position or making
[54:20] ourselves anything this has everything
[54:22] to do with us recognizing what God has
[54:24] called us to be and separating from
[54:27] everything else to stay consecrated to
[54:29] that purpose
[54:30] that I now know who I am I now know why
[54:34] I'm in this generation I now know what
[54:36] he called me for I now know his purpose
[54:38] in my life and now I choose to stay
[54:41] separated from everything that would
[54:43] take me away from that purpose so that I
[54:45] sanctify myself to stay consecrated to
[54:50] this purpose
[54:52] does that make sense
[54:53] it's not a self holiness
[54:57] but it's a it's a surrender to the will
[55:00] of God in our lives
[55:03] and the message the Queen of Sheba
[55:05] brother man says God make every man and
[55:07] woman in here tonight a Christian like
[55:09] unto that that can display such a love
[55:12] in their hearts that they'll be such a
[55:15] Christian live such an unspotted life
[55:18] from the world until their neighbors
[55:20] will know that they are real Christians
[55:22] and want to be like them
[55:25] Jesus said I sanctify myself for their
[55:27] sakes and brother Benham said do that
[55:28] for your neighbor
[55:31] and here he comes right back and he
[55:33] starts saying let them live such
[55:35] unspotted life from the world
[55:38] how can I live an unspotted life from
[55:40] the world stay in the word
[55:45] until their neighbors will know that
[55:47] they are real Christians and want to be
[55:50] like them consecrate ourselves for their
[55:54] sakes
[56:00] let's go back to First Peter chapter two
[56:02] we read the first part of this but I
[56:03] want to read what follows in First Peter
[56:06] chapter 2.
[56:10] First Peter chapter 2 verse 9.
[56:15] but you are a chosen generation a royal
[56:18] priesthood a holy nation A peculiar
[56:21] people that you should show forth the
[56:22] Praises of him who hath called you out
[56:25] of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[56:27] which in time past were not a people but
[56:29] are now the people of God which has not
[56:32] obtained Mercy but now have obtained
[56:34] Mercy dearly beloved I beseech you as a
[56:37] strangers and pilgrims abstain from
[56:39] fleshly lust which war against the soul
[56:42] have your conversation honest among the
[56:45] Gentiles that where whereas they speak
[56:48] against you as evildoers they may by
[56:50] your good works which they Shall Behold
[56:52] glorify God in the day of visitation
[56:56] what is Peter saying Peter's saying live
[57:00] a Sanctified life
[57:02] live a Sanctified life
[57:04] be separate abstain from fleshly Lost
[57:07] he's he's saying you do that
[57:10] you do it you live Sanctified you live
[57:14] to the word you live separated you do it
[57:17] so that they will see your life and
[57:20] glorify God
[57:22] amen
[57:26] let's go back to First Corinthians First
[57:28] Corinthians chapter 5.
[57:34] this is like a sword drill in the New
[57:36] Testament
[57:37] how fast can we turn there first
[57:39] Corinthians chapter five
[57:41] verse 9.
[57:44] now I want to set this in
[57:46] because
[57:49] we saw what Paul said in second
[57:51] Corinthians that don't be unequally
[57:53] yoked with unbelievers be separated come
[57:55] out from among them and be separate and
[57:57] I will receive you but I want to look at
[57:59] what Paul says here because this is a
[58:01] good sound instruction First Corinthians
[58:04] 5 and 9. said I rode into you in an
[58:07] epistle not to company with fornicators
[58:09] yet not all together with the
[58:11] fornicators of this world are with the
[58:13] Covetous or extortioners or with
[58:15] idolaters for then must you needs go out
[58:18] of the world
[58:19] but now I have written unto you not to
[58:21] keep Company If any man that is called a
[58:24] brother be a fornicator or Covetous or
[58:26] adulterer or a or a drunkard or
[58:29] an extortioner which such a one know not
[58:32] to eat the reason I wanted to put this
[58:35] in there is sometimes we get the idea of
[58:37] come out from among them and be you
[58:39] separate amen as as that we're not even
[58:41] to associate with anybody in the world
[58:43] but they're the ones that are supposed
[58:45] to see your Godly life
[58:47] they're the ones that are supposed to be
[58:49] affected by your sanctification
[58:52] so you know he says I he says I told you
[58:55] not to keep company with a fornicator he
[58:57] said but not yet all together with the
[58:59] fornicators of this world for then you
[59:01] must need to go out of the world there's
[59:03] no way to survive if we're going to stay
[59:05] separated from everybody living in sin
[59:08] we have to work together you have to
[59:10] work sometimes on projects together you
[59:12] have to sometimes have dinner together
[59:15] you sometimes have to travel together
[59:17] with co-workers with family members with
[59:19] people who are unbelievers and they may
[59:22] be in this position Amen to be separate
[59:24] is not necessarily saying that I'm never
[59:26] going to I'm never going to eat lunch
[59:30] with somebody who's a fornicator
[59:33] no he says if somebody be called a
[59:35] brother and be in that condition amen
[59:37] there's leaven in the lump there don't
[59:39] associate if he's called a brother but a
[59:42] worldly person that's how they live
[59:45] so if we if we take this separation too
[59:48] far who's going to see your Godly life
[59:50] amen if we go to communal living and we
[59:52] all go up somewhere let's go buy land in
[59:54] Montana amen let's get a big Ranch and
[59:57] we'll all work it together it'll be just
[59:59] us and we won't let sin in the door
[1:00:00] that's not what he wants us Sanctified
[1:00:03] for he wants us to be consecrated to our
[1:00:06] purpose so that we've been Sanctified
[1:00:08] for their sakes
[1:00:09] for the fornicator in the cubicle next
[1:00:12] to you amen for the idolater amen amen
[1:00:15] that goes to the Catholic church that
[1:00:16] you eat lunch with that's who he wants
[1:00:18] you to be Sanctified for
[1:00:21] that's why it's so important amen when
[1:00:24] we're at work amen that we keep
[1:00:26] ourselves in sanctification because it's
[1:00:29] so easy to join the crowd
[1:00:33] I mean I know what it's like I worked
[1:00:35] it's so easy Amen to just enter in with
[1:00:38] the conversation and everything's going
[1:00:40] fine you're having a fine conversation
[1:00:42] we're talking about family then all of a
[1:00:43] sudden it turns
[1:00:45] and it turns to something lustful or
[1:00:47] something ungodly or something dirty
[1:00:49] amen and then you're stuck there you
[1:00:51] know what to do I've been in this
[1:00:53] conversation the conversation goes wrong
[1:00:54] amen we've got to understand that we
[1:00:58] must stay Sanctified for their sakes
[1:01:02] I can't join in the dirty conversation
[1:01:04] and laugh at the dirty jokes and they'll
[1:01:06] see amen the light shining out of me if
[1:01:09] I just enter in the crowd neither can I
[1:01:11] stay completely separate and have
[1:01:13] nothing to do with unbelievers
[1:01:16] you see God Amen said you're in the
[1:01:19] world but not of the world Amen he's put
[1:01:21] us in our workplaces for a reason he's
[1:01:23] put us in our families for a reason he's
[1:01:25] put us in the places we are for a reason
[1:01:27] and we are to stay consecrated
[1:01:30] Sanctified for the purpose that he's put
[1:01:33] us here and what is that purpose so that
[1:01:35] his life can live through us
[1:01:37] so we must stay where God has placed us
[1:01:40] amen we must let the light shine
[1:01:44] but we must keep ourselves consecrated
[1:01:49] to our purpose
[1:01:51] when we can't just
[1:01:55] join in
[1:01:57] every conversation
[1:01:59] we can't just we we even though we must
[1:02:03] be there we must be associated with the
[1:02:07] people God's put us in association with
[1:02:09] and we might but we must stay Sanctified
[1:02:11] for their sakes
[1:02:13] so sometimes it's a it's a tightrope to
[1:02:16] walk
[1:02:17] but I believe God will give Grace he's
[1:02:19] put us there for a reason
[1:02:21] when the conversation goes wrong and you
[1:02:23] find a polite way to excuse yourself not
[1:02:26] condemning not saying you all with your
[1:02:28] filthy Mouse I'm out here but you find a
[1:02:30] polite way to excuse yourself it won't
[1:02:32] take long till they notice he doesn't go
[1:02:33] for that
[1:02:35] you don't have to be rude you don't have
[1:02:37] to be belligerent you don't have to be
[1:02:38] condemning you just have to stay
[1:02:40] consecrated to your purpose
[1:02:42] God didn't put me on this Earth to laugh
[1:02:44] at dirty jokes
[1:02:46] he put me here to shine forth his life
[1:02:49] and that's what I must stay Sanctified
[1:02:52] to
[1:02:53] that's what I must stay consecrated to
[1:02:57] so you realize when we when you don't
[1:03:00] know who you are and you don't know what
[1:03:02] your purpose is then we just Meander
[1:03:04] through life but this this Revelation
[1:03:07] that God opened to us in this day tells
[1:03:09] us exactly who we are and exactly what
[1:03:11] our purpose is
[1:03:12] and then and then we know what am I
[1:03:15] consecrating myself to to that purpose
[1:03:18] amen that's what God wants that's why
[1:03:20] he's called me to be holy in this day to
[1:03:23] be used for his purpose
[1:03:26] in the message of the Hidden life with
[1:03:28] Christ he says God didn't put you here
[1:03:30] to work in a factory just alone that
[1:03:32] means he didn't your whole purpose is
[1:03:34] not just to work in a factory
[1:03:37] he puts you here as a testimony
[1:03:40] a written epistle read of all men to
[1:03:42] live an honorable and decent life in a
[1:03:45] hid consecrated life with God so that
[1:03:48] men would know that Jesus Christ still
[1:03:50] lives and Reigns that's why you're here
[1:03:53] and that's why you work in that factory
[1:03:56] if you want them to know why you're
[1:03:57] where you're at this is why you're where
[1:03:59] you're at amen so that those around you
[1:04:01] will know that Christ lives and Reigns
[1:04:05] it goes on to say uh well let's read
[1:04:09] James and then we'll get to this next
[1:04:10] clue
[1:04:11] James chapter 2.
[1:04:16] as I was looking into this study and I
[1:04:18] was going through the scripture so many
[1:04:20] scriptures came alive fresh again
[1:04:26] James chapter 2.
[1:04:30] verse 17. James chapter 2 verse 17.
[1:04:36] it says even so faith if it hath not
[1:04:39] works is dead being alone
[1:04:43] yea a man may say thou has faith and I
[1:04:46] have Works show me thy faith without thy
[1:04:49] works and I will show thee my faith by
[1:04:52] my works
[1:04:54] this is so interesting because when you
[1:04:56] read James brother Benham addressed this
[1:04:58] issue because it looks like James is
[1:05:00] contradicting Paul in the in the Romans
[1:05:02] in the Book of Romans because because
[1:05:04] Romans is saying that it's not by works
[1:05:07] but it's by faith amen Abraham received
[1:05:10] the promise not of works but by faith
[1:05:12] amen and here he's saying without works
[1:05:14] your faith is dead it looks like it's
[1:05:16] contrary to one another but brother
[1:05:18] banham comes and he makes it so simple
[1:05:20] to understand he said your faith is what
[1:05:23] God sees
[1:05:24] your works is what mankind sees
[1:05:29] that's why James says here he says a man
[1:05:34] may say Verse 18 thou has faith and I
[1:05:37] have worked show me thy faith without
[1:05:38] thy works like how can I see your faith
[1:05:42] show me your faith with no works
[1:05:45] you can't show it it's impossible to see
[1:05:48] James is saying show me Mike show me
[1:05:50] your faith go ahead show it to me
[1:05:52] take it out and show it I mean you've
[1:05:54] got it
[1:05:55] you can't show faith without works
[1:06:00] and he says I will show thee my faith by
[1:06:03] my works that's why brother Venom said
[1:06:05] take me to a man's office take me to his
[1:06:07] home let me see the books he reads let
[1:06:09] me see the posters that he has on the
[1:06:10] wall I'll tell you what's in him amen
[1:06:12] and so the The Works declare the faith
[1:06:15] and he's he's James is dispelling this
[1:06:18] myth that all I have to do is believe
[1:06:20] amen it doesn't matter what I do amen
[1:06:23] you can't do in order to be accepted by
[1:06:26] God that's not the that's the point
[1:06:28] Abraham righteousness was imputed unto
[1:06:30] him not because of the works that he did
[1:06:33] but because of the faith that he had
[1:06:36] but it doesn't mean that works aren't
[1:06:39] important The Works are the light that
[1:06:41] we shine to the world
[1:06:43] that declare our faith
[1:06:46] amen so James is bringing it to the
[1:06:50] highlight and making it important what
[1:06:52] you do declares what you believe
[1:06:57] that's why it doesn't work to be a
[1:07:01] Sunday believer in a Monday mixer
[1:07:05] we're separated on Sunday but we're
[1:07:07] mixing on Monday that doesn't work
[1:07:09] that's James is telling you that's not
[1:07:12] working that's what James is saying
[1:07:15] that's not working
[1:07:16] but we must be separated on Sunday and
[1:07:18] separated on Monday and separated on
[1:07:20] Tuesday and separated when we're tired
[1:07:22] on Thursday and separated when we we're
[1:07:25] having a bad day and everything's going
[1:07:26] wrong on Friday amen we're to stay
[1:07:28] separated from the things of the world
[1:07:30] and consecrate it to the word of God
[1:07:33] amen let's look at James chapter one
[1:07:38] verse 27
[1:07:40] foreign
[1:07:43] and undefiled before God and the father
[1:07:46] is this to visit the fatherless and
[1:07:48] widows in their Affliction and to keep
[1:07:51] himself unspotted from the world
[1:07:54] this is part of pure religion and
[1:07:56] undefiled
[1:07:58] let's go back to First Corinthians
[1:08:04] First Corinthians chapter 9.
[1:08:16] this is the Apostle Paul speaking First
[1:08:18] Corinthians 9 and verse 24.
[1:08:21] know you not the day which run in a race
[1:08:23] run all
[1:08:25] but one receiveth the prize so run that
[1:08:27] ye may obtain
[1:08:28] now I want to stop there because we
[1:08:30] always go on but what does Paul saying
[1:08:34] he's saying you should give your all
[1:08:37] that's what he's saying
[1:08:39] many people run in a race
[1:08:42] they all run but only one person gets
[1:08:44] the prize you should run this race of
[1:08:47] life so that you get the prize if only
[1:08:50] one person's getting the prize it's got
[1:08:52] to be me
[1:08:53] Paul is saying give all
[1:08:57] don't halfway don't hold back Paul is
[1:09:00] telling us to give all
[1:09:03] verse 25 and every man that striveth for
[1:09:05] the Mastery is tempered in all things
[1:09:06] now they do it to obtain a corruptable
[1:09:08] crown but we an Incorruptible I
[1:09:12] therefore shall run not as uncertain so
[1:09:13] fight I not as one that beat at the air
[1:09:15] but I keep under my body and bring it
[1:09:18] into subjection lest that by any means
[1:09:21] when I have preached to others I myself
[1:09:23] should be a Castaway
[1:09:25] the Apostle Paul he's he's not saying
[1:09:29] well I'm born again filled with the Holy
[1:09:32] Ghost been Sanctified by God no he's
[1:09:35] constantly bringing this body subject to
[1:09:38] the word he's watching after his life
[1:09:40] he's watching after his conduct he's not
[1:09:43] letting this body get away from him
[1:09:46] I mean what instruction for us
[1:09:48] sanctification is not just something
[1:09:50] that happened Amen to us in our journey
[1:09:52] to the new birth but sanctification is
[1:09:54] something that's still happening to us
[1:09:56] as we sanctify our consecrate or
[1:09:59] dedicate ourselves to the purpose God
[1:10:00] has God had a purpose for Paul and Paul
[1:10:03] was not going to let his body lead him
[1:10:05] astray but to keep under your body means
[1:10:07] to beat black and blue he was keeping
[1:10:10] himself subject to the word he had
[1:10:12] choices to make he had work to do he had
[1:10:14] a part to play in this
[1:10:17] and if it was true for Paul and we're
[1:10:19] not free from that amen
[1:10:22] let's go to first Thessalonians
[1:10:25] chapter 4.
[1:10:27] first Thessalonians chapter 4.
[1:10:34] verse 1.
[1:10:39] furthermore then we beseech you Brethren
[1:10:41] and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as
[1:10:43] ye have received of us how you ought to
[1:10:46] walk and to please God so you would
[1:10:48] abound more and more for you know what
[1:10:51] Commandments we gave you by the Lord
[1:10:53] Jesus for this is the will of God even
[1:10:56] your sanctification that you should
[1:10:58] abstain from fornication this word
[1:11:00] sanctification is the third one on a
[1:11:02] list here it's Consecration and
[1:11:04] purification
[1:11:06] for this is the will of God even your
[1:11:08] Consecration and purification that's
[1:11:11] continuing on
[1:11:14] that you should abstain from fornication
[1:11:16] that every one of you should know how to
[1:11:19] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[1:11:23] honor same word consecration
[1:11:25] purification not in the lust of
[1:11:28] concupiscence even as the Gentiles which
[1:11:31] know not God that no man go beyond and
[1:11:33] defraud his brother in any matter
[1:11:35] because that the Lord is the Avenger of
[1:11:37] all such as we also have forewarned you
[1:11:40] and testified for God hath not called us
[1:11:42] unto uncleanness but unto Holiness this
[1:11:47] word Holiness is the same one that was
[1:11:49] used sanctification twice in this he's
[1:11:51] called us into Consecration and
[1:11:54] purification
[1:11:55] he's called us to Walk This Way he's
[1:11:58] called us to live this way not once but
[1:12:01] for life
[1:12:03] praise God
[1:12:06] now let's go to Colossians chapter 3.
[1:12:11] I have several other scriptures but this
[1:12:13] is the last one that I'm going to read
[1:12:15] tonight
[1:12:17] Colossians
[1:12:20] chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:12:28] if you then be risen with Christ
[1:12:31] seek those things which are above where
[1:12:33] Christ sitteth on the right hand of God
[1:12:36] set your affections on things above not
[1:12:39] on things on the Earth
[1:12:40] for you are dead and your life is hid
[1:12:43] with Christ in God
[1:12:47] says in the message
[1:12:50] um
[1:12:51] that a hidden life with Christ from
[1:12:54] 1956.
[1:12:56] he says this
[1:12:57] he says Christianity is a sacrifice life
[1:13:01] a hidden life with God through Christ
[1:13:04] sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:13:07] that's what the real Christian Life
[1:13:09] consists of
[1:13:10] not of how well you can do this or how
[1:13:12] well you can sing that's all right how
[1:13:14] well you can preach that's fine but that
[1:13:17] isn't it
[1:13:18] it's a hidden life
[1:13:20] consecrated the veil curtains dropped
[1:13:23] around you and you're dead and you're
[1:13:25] buried and you're hidden God through
[1:13:27] Christ and sealed in there by the Holy
[1:13:29] Ghost
[1:13:31] I I preached everything I preached
[1:13:33] because I want to get to this
[1:13:35] so just for the next few minutes I want
[1:13:38] to talk about this
[1:13:40] you see the the problem with the old
[1:13:43] understanding of Holiness of somehow
[1:13:45] doing everything right to achieve
[1:13:48] something it's totally wrong amen we
[1:13:51] only achieve what God's called us to God
[1:13:53] but we're holy because God chose us to
[1:13:55] be holy but he's told us to stay in
[1:13:58] sanctification for his purpose
[1:14:03] but but
[1:14:04] there's a motivation I should say it
[1:14:07] this way there's a motivation that comes
[1:14:09] from consecration there's a motivation
[1:14:12] that's behind our sanctification and the
[1:14:15] motivation comes from the hidden life in
[1:14:17] Christ
[1:14:19] like I can I can preach oh I hope I can
[1:14:23] express this right just pull for a
[1:14:25] minute please
[1:14:27] I can preach in a way a condemning way
[1:14:31] and if I preach hard enough and I preach
[1:14:34] and I hit enough points I can hit enough
[1:14:37] points to where I can make everybody in
[1:14:39] here feel condemned
[1:14:41] if I just talk about life
[1:14:44] talk about things that you've seen this
[1:14:46] week and things you've heard and
[1:14:47] something you should have turned away
[1:14:49] from you didn't turn away fast enough
[1:14:50] and I thought you had about another
[1:14:52] person I mean how many of us could raise
[1:14:54] our hands now that we're toast amen
[1:14:57] we could just start laying it out and
[1:15:00] laying it out and say you have to stop
[1:15:03] those things you have to change that God
[1:15:05] doesn't want that but you already know
[1:15:07] that
[1:15:08] is that right
[1:15:10] so the motivation cannot be stop doing
[1:15:14] that God doesn't want you to do that
[1:15:16] that can't be just a motivation alone I
[1:15:18] mean there has to be a deeper motivation
[1:15:20] that comes from a deep reality of the
[1:15:23] word and it comes from a relationship
[1:15:25] that takes place behind the veil
[1:15:29] not on the surface level not something
[1:15:31] that takes place amen because you know I
[1:15:34] want to be a good boy and I want to make
[1:15:35] it to Heaven there needs to be a deeper
[1:15:38] Revelation or else we'll never make it
[1:15:40] amen because we we've got to come a
[1:15:42] little higher in our Revelation or else
[1:15:44] we're going to find ourselves constantly
[1:15:46] falling constantly falling constantly
[1:15:48] falling and like never able to achieve
[1:15:50] that which we're going after but we're
[1:15:52] going after the wrong thing the wrong
[1:15:54] way amen what God wants from us is to
[1:15:57] draw us to himself he's looking for us
[1:15:59] to enter in behind the veil amen and
[1:16:02] become one with him and when we come
[1:16:04] into that Unity with him a bridegroom
[1:16:07] and a bride amen then all of a sudden
[1:16:09] there is no desire in you that wants to
[1:16:12] displease the bridegroom
[1:16:15] it's the hidden life that calls for
[1:16:18] consecration
[1:16:20] I
[1:16:21] read all the scriptures to you to show
[1:16:24] that this is part of life
[1:16:25] this is what we're called to this is
[1:16:28] absolutely what God wants from us he
[1:16:31] wants us to stay separate he wants us to
[1:16:33] be consecrated he wants us to stay in
[1:16:36] sanctification he wants us separated
[1:16:38] from the world and consecrated to his
[1:16:40] purpose but if I just tell you that and
[1:16:43] you try to do that if that's the only
[1:16:45] motivation you're going to be a
[1:16:46] frustrated person but what you must do
[1:16:48] first is enter in behind the veil and
[1:16:51] recognize who's calling who's drawing
[1:16:54] amen that you've come into one with
[1:16:56] Christ
[1:16:58] and then after that he's revealed Who
[1:17:02] You Are
[1:17:04] he himself has called you bride
[1:17:08] not a preacher behind the pulpit but he
[1:17:10] himself has called you bride
[1:17:12] he has unveiled himself to you not an
[1:17:15] intellectual teaching not an ability to
[1:17:18] show quotes and show scriptures but
[1:17:20] Christ himself has revealed himself to
[1:17:23] you
[1:17:24] and when you've entered into that
[1:17:27] relationship behind the veil now all of
[1:17:30] a sudden it's not because Paul said it
[1:17:32] that I do it Paul was showing what God
[1:17:34] wants out of my life but it's not Paul
[1:17:37] saying it that makes me want to do it
[1:17:39] it's the hidden life with Christ that's
[1:17:41] motivating me to give my all
[1:17:45] they understand this is why amen when
[1:17:48] when we try to hammer somebody into
[1:17:51] confirmation we can get people to
[1:17:54] conform in a certain way in a certain
[1:17:56] group setting amen but it's never ever
[1:17:59] coming from the depth of their soul amen
[1:18:01] so it'll never last the only thing that
[1:18:04] will last is what's coming from the
[1:18:05] depth of your soul and that's coming
[1:18:07] from the hidden life with Christ
[1:18:10] it's coming because we've entered in
[1:18:12] behind the veil we've become one amen
[1:18:15] and where did we enter in behind the
[1:18:16] veil when he came in amen when we were
[1:18:19] when our soul was regenerate purged and
[1:18:22] that seed come to life now he is
[1:18:24] dwelling within and we are communing
[1:18:27] with God
[1:18:29] and all of a sudden I realize who I am
[1:18:34] not because somebody told me
[1:18:36] but he told me
[1:18:39] I know who he is and I know who I am
[1:18:45] and all of a sudden
[1:18:47] all I want to do is give myself to him
[1:18:52] you see it's the only thing that will
[1:18:55] work
[1:18:57] he he has Sanctified Us by his Spirit he
[1:19:02] has filled us he's burnt out the worldly
[1:19:04] Nature by the Holy Ghost he's come to
[1:19:06] take residence in US amen so that we
[1:19:10] will stay consecrated to him amen not
[1:19:13] because we have to
[1:19:17] but because we want to
[1:19:23] I I grew up and oh I grew up in all
[1:19:27] kinds of preaching friends
[1:19:29] news meetings and all kinds of
[1:19:31] gatherings I hit the altar every time
[1:19:34] the evangelists started naming bad
[1:19:35] things in your life
[1:19:39] because
[1:19:40] it was there
[1:19:42] what other choice did I have
[1:19:45] but it was this Revelation that was
[1:19:48] contained in the seals
[1:19:50] that that unsealed who I am
[1:19:55] there was the Revelation under the seals
[1:19:57] that unsealed who I am
[1:20:00] I knew God was holy but I didn't realize
[1:20:03] that I was supposed to be holy
[1:20:06] I I knew he was holy but I didn't
[1:20:09] realize he wanted me to be holy because
[1:20:11] he wanted to be he wanted me to be the
[1:20:14] Tabernacle that was going to be
[1:20:16] Tabernacle deity in this day
[1:20:19] and when I come to realize what God
[1:20:22] wanted to do in this generation that he
[1:20:25] wanted the deity to be tabernacled and
[1:20:27] flashed and that he wanted my flesh to
[1:20:29] be part of that Tabernacle all of a
[1:20:32] sudden everything in my life changed it
[1:20:34] wasn't anymore I have to be a good boy
[1:20:36] to make it to Heaven I realize I've
[1:20:38] already made it I made it before the
[1:20:40] foundation of the world when he placed
[1:20:41] my name on The Book of Life amen before
[1:20:44] it was there I was in his thoughts I was
[1:20:47] always with God and always a part of God
[1:20:49] I'm not in jeopardy of being lost I'm
[1:20:51] not conducting myself in a way to be
[1:20:53] saved I recognize I'm saved I'm
[1:20:56] conducting myself in a way to keep
[1:20:58] myself in his purpose
[1:21:00] [Music]
[1:21:01] because I recognize his purpose in my
[1:21:04] life I won't join in in the things of
[1:21:06] the world not because I'm going to be
[1:21:08] punished not because lightning bolts are
[1:21:10] going to hit me or because the rest of
[1:21:12] the church will reject me I I know what
[1:21:14] he wants me to do and now that's what
[1:21:16] I'm consecrating myself for
[1:21:18] I know who I am I know my purpose in
[1:21:21] life I know the light that's supposed to
[1:21:23] shine from this vessel now I sanctify
[1:21:25] myself for their sakes amen because
[1:21:27] they're not going to find him in a
[1:21:29] system they're not going to find him in
[1:21:30] Hollywood they're not going to find him
[1:21:32] in Pleasures the world where will they
[1:21:34] find him he'll find him in the word
[1:21:35] that's coming forth from this bride
[1:21:37] she's the final voice and the final age
[1:21:40] how can I now live an unconsecrated life
[1:21:43] where somebody won't hear the voice of
[1:21:45] God
[1:21:48] you understand going behind the veil
[1:21:50] changes everything
[1:21:52] entering the little room amen having him
[1:21:55] unveil himself to you it changes
[1:21:57] everything
[1:22:00] amen
[1:22:03] now
[1:22:04] now why do you consecrate yourself
[1:22:07] because I know who I am
[1:22:10] because it's so important amen
[1:22:14] because of who I rub shoulders with
[1:22:16] because who I'm in contact with because
[1:22:18] of who I am and because of who's in me
[1:22:23] now I must keep the lamp the glass
[1:22:26] that's over the line I must keep it
[1:22:29] clean so the light can shine out
[1:22:32] I don't have to keep it clean so that I
[1:22:35] can receive the light
[1:22:38] does that make sense
[1:22:40] the light is in me
[1:22:42] Jesus said I'm the light of the world
[1:22:44] Amen but then he looked at disciple says
[1:22:46] you're the light of the world where's
[1:22:48] the light he's the light the word may
[1:22:50] manifest in your day is light where's
[1:22:52] the word made manifest in me
[1:22:55] the light is in me I'm not trying to
[1:22:58] receive the light I've received the
[1:23:00] light now for me I'm supposed to be a
[1:23:02] vessel that's shining the light so what
[1:23:04] am I to do I'm to keep that glass clean
[1:23:08] which is this body so that the light can
[1:23:10] shine out
[1:23:11] if I let it get smutted up with the
[1:23:14] world and ruin my testimony into stand
[1:23:16] and compromise who's going to receive
[1:23:19] this light amen they look at a vessel
[1:23:21] that's tainted and dirty and smudge and
[1:23:24] now the light is all obscure and dark
[1:23:27] and there's no clear resonating of the
[1:23:29] Life of Christ amen what I've done is
[1:23:31] I've robbed this world from a clear sign
[1:23:35] but now the Revelation from behind the
[1:23:38] veil
[1:23:39] has put in me a desire for
[1:23:43] sanctification
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:46] now I have to do this and I have to do
[1:23:49] that
[1:23:50] I can say what brother Brandon said I
[1:23:52] can go on the bank of the river and fish
[1:23:53] every day of my life and be just as
[1:23:55] saved
[1:23:56] and go to heaven and be in the new
[1:23:59] heavens and the new Earth
[1:24:00] that's not his purpose for me
[1:24:03] that's not what he wants for me and so
[1:24:05] now I sanctify myself
[1:24:09] to this purpose
[1:24:13] you see friends
[1:24:15] the Revelation changes everything
[1:24:19] amen every teaching every principle
[1:24:22] everything changes with the revelation
[1:24:27] brother Branham said in Revelation
[1:24:28] chapter 4.
[1:24:30] part three
[1:24:32] from 1961 he says all right
[1:24:35] here was voices Oh how we need in
[1:24:37] Jeffersonville
[1:24:39] thousands of lived voices
[1:24:41] the Thunder of God thundering out in
[1:24:44] sweetness and Holiness Purity
[1:24:46] undefiled lives
[1:24:49] that's what he's telling us that's the
[1:24:51] voice of God
[1:24:53] thundering out is our life
[1:24:57] sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled
[1:24:59] lives walking around in the Earth today
[1:25:01] without a blemish yes sir real
[1:25:04] Christians that's Thunder against the
[1:25:06] enemy
[1:25:08] the devil don't care how loud you can
[1:25:10] holler the devil don't care how much you
[1:25:12] can jump or how much you can do this or
[1:25:14] shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see
[1:25:17] that Sanctified holy life consecrated to
[1:25:21] God
[1:25:23] amen I'm going to read that again
[1:25:25] because I like it so much amen there
[1:25:27] there's all kinds of demonstrations that
[1:25:31] take place on Sunday amen but that's not
[1:25:33] what scares the devil amen it's how you
[1:25:35] live on Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[1:25:37] Thursday Friday Saturday that's what
[1:25:40] shakes the devil
[1:25:41] we can we can raise hands and sing and
[1:25:44] demonstrate in Hallelujah and shake
[1:25:46] hands and hug next amen that doesn't
[1:25:48] bother the devil he knows that can be a
[1:25:51] church walk
[1:25:53] but what what really terrifies him is
[1:25:57] somebody that'll stay consecrated to
[1:25:59] their purpose and say Sanctified to the
[1:26:02] purpose that God has in their life and
[1:26:04] fulfill that purpose amen
[1:26:06] was the devil constantly trying to do
[1:26:08] trying to keep you from your purpose
[1:26:11] what is he trying to he's trying to do
[1:26:13] this and he's trying to do that he's
[1:26:15] trying all kinds of things in my life
[1:26:16] really he's got one main objective and
[1:26:18] that one main objective is to keep you
[1:26:20] from your purpose
[1:26:24] praise God
[1:26:26] I'm going to read this again
[1:26:29] the devil don't care how loud you can
[1:26:31] holler the devil don't worry how much
[1:26:33] you can jump or how much you can do this
[1:26:34] or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to
[1:26:37] see that Sanctified holy life
[1:26:40] consecrated to God
[1:26:43] you say that's what God does
[1:26:46] God does it and you do it
[1:26:51] say anything to him call him anything
[1:26:54] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:26:56] right on oh my that throws him away
[1:26:59] that's the Thunder that shakes the devil
[1:27:03] I don't know about you but I want to
[1:27:05] shake the devil
[1:27:07] and I don't need to scream at him to
[1:27:09] shake him
[1:27:11] but what I need to do is surrender
[1:27:14] surrender with everything that's in me
[1:27:17] to this revealed word
[1:27:20] I give all of my life and surrender to
[1:27:23] this word and Obey it with all with all
[1:27:26] that's in my heart
[1:27:28] to yield my members not unto
[1:27:30] righteousness but unto righteousness
[1:27:33] to surrender myself to God to surrender
[1:27:36] myself to his word to his Spirit that's
[1:27:39] flowing amen not to take my own ideas
[1:27:42] about things and not to have my own
[1:27:44] wants and desires about things around me
[1:27:46] but to completely surrender to this word
[1:27:49] amen then when I Surrender and then I
[1:27:52] live that life it is not me you realize
[1:27:55] he said brother Madam said it's not you
[1:27:57] it's a life that he lives through you
[1:28:00] amen
[1:28:01] but he lives it through you as you
[1:28:04] surrender as you yield as you lay down
[1:28:07] your life and let him live his life
[1:28:11] we can hinder that by living our own
[1:28:13] life and making our own choices
[1:28:16] but or we can consecrate ourselves
[1:28:20] we can sanctify ourselves
[1:28:23] dedicating ourselves to his purpose
[1:28:28] and let him
[1:28:30] Shine the Light through us
[1:28:33] when brother man says it's
[1:28:36] the Thunder of God thundering out and
[1:28:39] sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled
[1:28:42] Life that's not a man trying to be nice
[1:28:47] that's the life of Christ living through
[1:28:49] a human being
[1:28:51] it's not just you deciding I want to be
[1:28:53] nice to everybody no it's got to be
[1:28:55] Christ Living Through you but we must be
[1:28:58] surrendered
[1:28:59] to that for Christ to live through us
[1:29:04] it's not a code of conduct
[1:29:06] not a moral order
[1:29:08] it's not a social Gathering or a group
[1:29:12] it's a consecrated life to God Alone
[1:29:16] a life lived for him the word
[1:29:21] separation I wrote down here separation
[1:29:23] from anything
[1:29:25] contrary to him

[1:36:54] may God move us away from group thinking
[1:36:58] may God take each one of us behind the
[1:37:01] veil and may He unveil himself to us
[1:37:04] personally
[1:37:06] so that now amen now my life is lived
[1:37:11] for him
[1:37:13] not for not not for whatever everybody
[1:37:16] around me thinks
[1:37:18] but there's one you remember when
[1:37:20] brother Branham he told the story of the
[1:37:23] of the of the man who was playing I
[1:37:25] believe it was a violin piece and he
[1:37:27] played in a great Orchestra Hong there
[1:37:30] was hundreds maybe thousands of people
[1:37:32] there and he played and he played a
[1:37:34] masterful way he did it perfect and and
[1:37:36] when he was done there was a standing
[1:37:38] ovation and everybody was cheering and
[1:37:40] applauding but he didn't look to the
[1:37:42] people he looked to the balcony because
[1:37:44] in the balcony was the master who had
[1:37:47] taught him and he wasn't satisfied till
[1:37:50] the master was satisfied
[1:37:53] listen you may have tons of people who
[1:37:55] think you're wonderful and people who
[1:37:57] Pat you on the back and sing your
[1:37:59] Praises but there's really only one that
[1:38:01] we want to please amen and that's the
[1:38:03] master that's the one who we met behind
[1:38:06] the veil that's one that we're in a
[1:38:07] hidden life relationship with he's my
[1:38:10] bridegroom amen he may be yours too but
[1:38:13] that's not what I'm worried about I'm
[1:38:14] worried about him being my bridegroom
[1:38:17] amen and I'm his bride you may be too
[1:38:20] but what I what matters to me is that
[1:38:23] he's my bridegroom
[1:38:25] what changes my life is not your
[1:38:27] relationship with him but what changes
[1:38:29] my life is my relationship with him
[1:38:32] we can keep things in general terms
[1:38:34] we're all the bride he's the bridegroom
[1:38:36] we're the bride that doesn't change your
[1:38:38] life what changes your life is when he's
[1:38:40] your bridegroom
[1:38:42] and when you're his bride and when
[1:38:45] you've met him behind the veil
[1:38:48] then all of a sudden
[1:38:50] to me it's inconsequential of whether
[1:38:53] this is accepted or not accepted by the
[1:38:56] people I felt with it's inconsequential
[1:38:59] now to me
[1:39:00] as long as it's accepted by him that's
[1:39:04] what I'm after as long as I can
[1:39:06] surrender to his will and be pleasing to
[1:39:09] him that becomes the most important
[1:39:11] thing in our lives
[1:39:12] and that's what we're consecrating
[1:39:15] ourselves to that's what we're staying
[1:39:17] Sanctified to that's what we're cutting
[1:39:20] and separating from everything else to
[1:39:22] stay lined up to that purpose
[1:39:26] oh the relationship changes everything
[1:39:30] then you don't have to chase people and
[1:39:32] wonder what they're doing bring rebukes
[1:39:34] over the pulpit and line everybody up by
[1:39:36] forceful preaching
[1:39:38] oh all we have to do if God would give
[1:39:41] us Grace is to lift this message high
[1:39:44] and then the unveiling of Christ will
[1:39:46] unveil the bride and when you're
[1:39:48] unveiled and he's unveiled to you all of
[1:39:51] a sudden everything changes and you
[1:39:52] consecrate yourself to this purpose
[1:39:56] it's not that you need everybody around
[1:39:58] you to keep you lined up amen you need
[1:40:00] that revelation of who you are and the
[1:40:02] word to keep you lying down
[1:40:05] oh thank God the bride will line herself
[1:40:10] to the word because she loves the
[1:40:12] bridegroom
