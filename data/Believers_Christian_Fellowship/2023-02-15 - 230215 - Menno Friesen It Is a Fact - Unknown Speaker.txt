God bless you this evening I'm going to let you have your seats for just a moment and as you can see I'm not preaching tonight I mean we had a surprise I got tipped off by an informant that brother minnow was in town he and his wife were here visiting and and so I I just asked him last night I called him last evening and asked if he would take the service for us and he so graciously accepted so I was so thankful for that so we're blessed to have our brother minnow here to minister for us this evening amen before we get into the prayer request I have a special announcement I'd like to announce an engagement man our brother Daniel Aaron our sister Caitlin Williams have been engaged to be married can you two stand for us please praise God [Applause] amen [Music] [Applause] thank you amen this exciting announcement you know how I feel about social media ruins the pastor's privilege to make all announcements so by the time we get around to it most everybody already knows if I could abolish that I would one of my privileges has been taken away but they're hoping to have a wedding here soon in the spring so amen may we all lend our support and help them any way we can and we're excited for the two of them amen God bless it certainly like I said it's a privilege I've put the minnow here brother minnow precedes me by many a year in Lima Ohio he was he was pastoring here in Lyman when I was an infant and so many of you know him quite well some of you may not you may be new and may not know him as well but he's a pastored in Lima for some time he may have been many of your pastor at one point or another but then he moved up to Saskatchewan he's pastored there ever since and I appreciate men like brother minnow because they blazed the trail and we're walking the path we have a lot to owe for the generation that labored for decades Amen to keep the the word true Amen to keep the way open and coming out of denominations and helping many come out and come to this glorious word and stay faithful so so many have fallen away but there's so many that has been held faithful by the Holy Spirit and for those men I'm thankful so it's it's a great privilege to have brother minnow here today and and I really look up to him and appreciate him and I'm thankful that his wife was able to join him and that we're able to have him Minister once again so we'd like to just sing a song and invite him to the pulpit and we just want to pull on the word and receive what we have need of tonight I Came To Worship you I came to sing your praise [Music] your whole name [Music] [Music] oh worship you as long hey man let's just pray one more time Lord we thank you for your goodness and your grace you are worthy to be praised for you are the faithful one we just heard

our hearts are Longing To See You Body Soul and spirits blessed now tonight in this we Fellowship around your truth your word guide my tongue and nudge me when I've said enough and Bless the people Lord may they be encouraged and strengthened and comforted boy you've said Comfort ye Comfort ye my people strengthen them I commit this service to you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can be seated I want to greet you tonight it is uh it's a pleasure to be here I I really was trying to get out of it I was hoping he wouldn't call me I thought I just people walk in and enjoy you know like you all of these years you're never quite get used to it it's just uh but just a part of you so pray for me I'm just uh I don't know if I'm going to preach tonight but I'm going to talk for a while and maybe then I need to pick it up somewhere but I uh this has always been a we are here upon one little thing that we decided years ago uh Irene and I we said ever get to the place to where we should get old enough to where uh wooden Pastor anymore and last year I turned 80 and I said well you know it must be getting very close and uh so this this winter or this this as of January our son-in-law Dwayne fair by the way who sends his love and his greetings he married our daughter Connie and they sent the love the whole church sends a love wherever we went and where we go and of course llama is a little special to us because it's it's a place yeah where we did that's the first place I ever pastored about a year and a half something like that and uh but I was around the the Tabernacle I think one of the first times I ever came to this area was the 1975. and brother Biscoe was invited to preach at brother Tom Brown's barn and uh brother Ed called and said brother why don't you meet me there I was in I was in Michigan here and so uh brother uh I forget the brother brother Henry he drove me down here it's the first time I came down here in 1975. so uh it kind of puts us way back now I have to confess one thing I don't think we I didn't think we'd be here in the year 2023 uh I I didn't uh I don't think any of us did some of you Elders you know what I'm talking about and uh but it's been a glorious time to lay in the presence of the word and ripen and uh sometimes it's uh has to break it down and knock it down and start all over again but but uh the master knows what he's building and uh he's not had to reject any yet he uh he knows how to put it together and uh sometimes we try to do it we kind of get in his way and I kind of like what brother Brian said I don't want to get in his way I'd like to at least be behind him so I could catch up but I don't be in his way we always want to be him to be ahead of us in all things that we do and uh but I I was reading in the old Paul in the book of Acts and I said to my wife what we'd like to do sometimes we if we had a little time so this is the year we took a month in Arizona and then we started heading towards the east and come up to Manny Louisiana and saw the scientists there and up to brother Pruitt's church and uh had a Time weekend service there with them and then and brother uh well uh he's leaving me bro Reagan's place and uh we were there as well and saw the new Tabernacle they built and and um I I uh you know we're getting some of the nicest buildings there is in the in the world but uh but those are just the outside I know this is all volcanic ash is going to pass anyhow but the real building that God's Building is the Tabernacle made by the Holy Ghost but uh we kind of always said I'd like to make a round trip and just go back and kind of you know like I think Paul and Barnabas and acts the uh 15th chapter there they said something like this let's let let us go again to visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of God where we've preached the word of the Lord and see how they do I kind of like that last part and see how they do and it's good to go and get it walk into a place like this and wherever we walked in we found that there's there's a people pressing towards the mark there's not just loafing around they've got a goal there their whole seems like their hearts on fire for the Lord now of course you don't get those in every place those that slack off and we never get away from the one thing that we understand there's always three kinds of Believers but there's a genuine bride that I believe is being formed by word cell upon word cell she's she's on the earth now and I'm by the grace of the Lord I believe I'm a part of them a part of her and uh but I want to bring you greetings also brother like I just said only the church in Saskatoon and they sent their greetings to all of you said wherever you go and uh We've uh you know in this area we kind of certain people were outstanding when we were here there's like the Yanks the woods the Davis the uh different uh Hatfields and the different ones of course I can't see you it's good you're uh you know how the lights are in the eyes it's like driving in the headlights you know going down the highway with a high beam on excuse me and um but I but I want to just say that it's been a pleasure during the years I was coming back and you're you see the children's children's children and uh not all I'm going on with the Lord but there's one thing we we have a promise I never pray I never stop praying and believing for those that that God has let us raise remember the prophet said he gives us a special promise for this age for this is the last of all ages as far as we understand here this evening that this is the This is the End we're summing up God is summing up the book of redemption it's it's going to be closed one of these you see less and less and not to say that there there we don't know how long we don't know that we we understand by the scripture and by the message when the propheter was here he he spoke urgently concerning the time and I believe it's always good to be ready always just I found out one thing now the Bible said just be ready when he comes when he comes in the morning uh just keep walking with the Lord and that's one of the greatest things that I think that we know we're walking in the truth we're not stumbling around trying to find something to walk with to walk Thy word is truth God has pulled the veil off of our eyes and we see the things that the Lord is doing and I'm glad to be a part of it the great work of God Amen you know there's a little song out uh give me Kiev [Music] yeah if you have the words there is a source in times of need I'm so glad there's a source aren't you [Music] you never have to worry about will he be there will the Lord hear my prayer you know he already knows before you're going to ask what you're going to ask he's not troubled he's not ringing his hands whether he's going to be able to help you or not he's not wondering whether you're going to be able to reach him or not he has a provided way he is the provided way and he loves to hear you ask [Music] you know what the prophet said don't ever be afraid to ask much because he's got much and when he gives much he has no less than what he gave inexhaustible fountain amen there is a soul s in time it gives me strength it brings me peace through every tribe through every test my savior stands in my defense showing the road you want leave you tired and warm all your strength is gone and your heart feels torn remember God is greater than the storm take her before the battle is become [Music] [Music] he holds my hand unless I should falter and makes me stand out on the water so when the road you walk leave you tight and warm and your strength is gone and your heart feels torn remember God is greater than the storm take her before the battle is the Lord take courage for the battle is the Lord amen I think we get that from the scripture thank you very much I always enjoy that because of I think of so many times you know we sat out and we said oh I'm going to do this and I'm going to do this but the good thing to pray said Lord go before me David one time was going to you know take the battle we read the Old Testament how sometimes every once in a while God did a miracle he said now just step back so you don't have to do anything I'll do this one I I won't need you as much of that time you know but God does things in his own way that's what I love about God he's sovereign you know he doesn't deal with us the same way we're not just cut out the same just like made the same God's very mindful every one of our needs they're different we're made up different we're boring if we're all the same it sure would be but I'm grateful tonight I want this I want to read a little scripture and some time ago I was I uh you know I was driving along and as we always do and you know ministers always I don't know brother Chad you know how it is uh we uh we've got one of the finest things there is in life we we get along we've always got an open line I I like that I'm glad so you don't have to go on a needle somewhere and be in a certain position or whether you're driving your car where you're at I love that about our Lord he's always he's always listening you can talk to him anytime never too late too early and you can discuss what you need to discuss at length sometimes he likes to hear all the things that we that we are troubled with or that we're going through but then he comes along and says well now you just wait till I do it now that's where we usually get in trouble we get a little impatient with God if you're anything like me I've I you know I used to say I got a lot of patience as long as I got it right now so in the over the years my wife has helped me my wife's saying by the way sitting back to Irene most of these people know her and uh we've been uh We've also hadn't reached another Milestone we're married 60 years this year so that to that young couple that just got engaged uh God bless you you know next to Salvation you've just made the most important decision that you'll ever make in this life or if God hath put them together who can put them asunder not with the preacher puts them together not of the church or the parents or somebody but if God puts them together there's nothing can separate them that's what we are so happy too I'm glad this is not the work of man this is the work of God I wasn't looking for the Lord were you frankly I try to get away from him as much as I could I didn't like things that kept him victim when I did wrong I didn't like it I Want to Be Free of that kept running kept running but you know you got to stop running once in a while but eventually anyhow so he just I gave up when I was about 19 years old and I just wish it would have started earlier and uh but I thank the Lord and and as I was going along saying it always uh brother bam said uh the song they used to sing it shall be a light about the evening time the path to Glory you will surely find so I started singing it real slow I started listening to every word it shall be light about the evening time now you got a whole message there the path to Glory you will surely find that sounds pretty secure then he shows us how in the Waterway is the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus Christ young and old repent of all your sins just one one way does not want a different way for young people oh we got to talk them into it no they have to be born again just like we did they've got to be justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost themselves can be personified in their life it takes that without it you're a church member God's not coming for church members he's coming for sons and daughters the evening light he goes on to sing that [Music] in the Waterway is the light today burden the precious name of Jesus Christ young and old repent of all your sins the Holy Ghost will surely enter in I said oh I hope I get the Holy Ghost sorry I promise you know that brother Bobby said you don't even need to pray for it I pray about it he said you do this you repent genuinely and baptized in my name and I will give you the Holy Ghost that's his promise that's how he works that's how he operates I can't change his mind about his word it's still just the same a birth is still a mess no matter how nice we dress where we live whether we've got money or no money at all the birth is still a mess and you try to make it down to the place to where he said well I'll just hold my hands just right and say Lord forgive me that's all right but if that's all you get you've got to get the assurance that he's heard your prayer when he does he seals you in but I like the part how he continues art the Holy Ghost will surely enter enter in the evening light has come but this is the part I really like it is a fact that God and Christ are one they got to sing in that I stopped that it is a fact it is a fact it is a fact that God in Christ they want to be it is a fact that Jehovah of the oldest Jesus of the is the fact that he that started the work will finish it and I get I got you know what I just went on driving by myself I kept saying all the fact it is a fact you know what the fact means that it's not very you don't have to be very smart to understand what that means but let's say this it says anything already done actually true that which has happened it is a fact that God sent Elijah to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers it is a fact it's not to be argued about disputed about it's a fact it's already over the message went around the world and out of every nation Kindred and people come there are people today worship him God in spirit and in truth they've taken this message in their heart they believe it just like we do well you know when you get a minister from Africa India wherever it comes from start preaching the message here sound just the same now sometimes you get a little awful a bit but just let it keep growing amen they'll come out the same place there's only one way he is the way I'm going to read a scripture Ephesians and um just uh as a I don't believe every any service is complete without the scripture but I like this little part in Ephesians the second chapter and just for a little background and then maybe make some comments on it if I could Ephesians 2 11 to 22 Why Don't We Stand Together as we read that in the respect and honor to God's word whoever remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without Christ being alien from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God in the world what a place to be how horrible but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall a partition between us amen having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained at ordinances for to make in him of Twain one new man Soul making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were far off and to them that were nigh for through him we both have excess by one Spirit unto the father now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and our built up upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together growth unto a holy Temple in the Lord in whom also and him he also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit you can be seated if you want I like that last part there and just to pull on that a little bit in whom ye also are building together for a habitation of God I love that part God is always he is in control of all things and I was just saying some of the things that we uh particular are privileged of was as the message we understand that that we didn't just he didn't just come and tell us a few little things about that happened in this age but God rich in Mercy went back way and before there was time itself and began to unfold himself to his body and came down in this last day and and broke back all pulled back all the veils right clear back to the Millennium Beyond to the new city clear back to it pulled it all back and showed us what has happened what is happening what's going to happen it is the most wonderful thing when you think sometimes on the and yet then we look at uh as you know so many times you you we're human beings we're we're in a body that they'll always give us trouble as long as we're here at several places brother Graham said now uh you know your your flesh Veil is what really keeps you from seeing God is what keeps you from seeing the angels that are here tonight they if you had that Dimension and of course then he goes out and talks about uh Elijah and gehaza and so on and uh how that when his eyes were opened he saw what Elijah saw of course when the situation came he looked and saw exactly what the prophet saw and that's the way it is with the real True Believer sometimes the prophet will say things and say oh I can't see that he says the Lord open my eyes first thing you know say oh that's how touches over here oh that's out come over here oh that's why this happened oh that's why I didn't that's why I tried to force it but it wouldn't work we tried to pray pray you know yeah pray the spirit off somebody when God put it on the person sometimes we'll try to pray off something that God has put on a person so oh I don't know oh yes yes you know brother bam said now God doesn't see one of your sins if you're in Christ Jesus you were there before the foundational world he said you come from the bosom of God and going back to the bosom of God you know there's a there's something brother bam says about that but let me just remember he's talking about the little dewdrop and I asked glisten said well in the morning comes and said then it's under on the clothes line or on the fence line and said and that little dewdrop that during the darkness of night begin to form and then when the Sun starts coming out starts glistering it starts shaking and it makes the most beautiful comment he said it begins to Rejoice because it knows it's going to go back to where it came from he said now that's the way every Christian is well the Holy Ghost starts dealing with you and starts working on you you begin to realize you're something's calling you back to where you were you know you don't remember it but you know by the promise of God that you come from God and you come from the bosom of God and going back to the bosom of God on the little message countdown brother Brown preaches several times to get to the place and he said oh just think of this last day he said now we're in the capsule Jesus Christ the word we're inside of them the countdown is on he said just think we're going back to the bosom of God where we came from but you dwell in a body that as long as you live here we'll give you trouble and he'll never take it away they leave it there he has a purpose but someday you know someday when this body will take on immortality then we'll be able to worship right we really want to worship he actually says you know you never he said we can't worship the way we would like to you ever feel that sometimes you just say oh I'd like to set my wings and just fly oh get up there just in the presence of God every once in a while when you get it you say oh if I could just stay here we were talking about the other day we're sitting around some brothers you know how we like to take when we get around table like to take those things and say and talk about them say now what now what sit and somebody said oh if I could just be more like God oh I want to be so more like God well if I would ask you you probably all would say yeah that's me I know I want to be more like God but you know you can only have so much of God in this body when Jesus was here him being the fullness of the godhead bodily do you know he didn't desire anything on this Earth except his elected seat he didn't care what house he lived in a car to drive you walked you just wore plain clothes didn't need anything because he was God of all but see we hear our and and we're giving this body to to live in and I said we got to talk about that we've been to take some of the quotes that brother bam says about and said you know what we'd be no good if you'd be so full of God then you'd be no earthly good I know and I know it sounds but remember you are a part of God by the will of God in the way that God designed it Paul said now nobody can get brother bam says nobody can get above what Paul was and Paul said every time I want to do good Evil's presence the things I do I don't even want to do them the things I think sometimes I don't even think them but we have a covenant God said I'll not leave I'll not leave you but you're always been mine and you know we know now by Revelation what say oh will you stick well one day I got eternal life no if you have eternal life tonight you've always been a part of God before there was a foundational world and now you're the manifested word of God for this hour you're the flesh male that God has settled in he's taken possession of this he's made us like he said right here he has made us in this scripture we went to the end there see that he's come in and builds a habitation of God through the spirit that's what God's doing that's the reason why he that's why he hated denominationalism that's why the prophet stood over said that's the curse of curse of Satan is denominationalism it won't let the people won't let them get out of the way so God can inhabit them their Church stands in the way their religion stands in the way their personality stands in a way but in a predestinated seed one and here's the word of God there's something inside that quickens to the word and says amen be it unto me according to your word oh I love that I know it's the truth I Live Now 80 years and I know it's get it just gets better and better it doesn't get worse or worse it gets better and better now you think you'll love your wife tonight right now and you're sweetheart you're sitting there I say oh I can have to wait to marry her yeah wait till you lived with her 60 years you know what I can't even I can't do without her I I'll be I'll be real honest you know brother Brian said one time a fellow told them they were talking and you know the prophet would tell us I like that a prophet he told us what he really was in his heart and he said a fella come to him one day he said you know what they were just married and said I really love my wife said but said but if she would leave me said I'd probably I could maybe love again he said then after about five years said I don't know but get a little harder they got to be 20 years said you know what I I don't know I said get about 50 years he said I can't even think those thoughts I couldn't get along without her that's the way I feel with the Lord you know what at the beginning when you serve the Lord some of you were young like like I was too and and you know everything was there but you know it wasn't as important it didn't seem as important but the further you walk with the Lord the more precious it becomes the more real it becomes that that the one thing you realize when you're born of the spirit of God that the desire of sin is gone that is the most glorious reality brother Brown said that's the one thing the scripture tells us that if a man and a woman that's born of the spirit of God they do not desire to sin they do not desire to disbelieve God's word they cry daily Lord let me believe every word don't let me even question it no matter how it looks what it looks like it looks totally impossible just let me just say what God Said for remember we are taught to speak God's language we were talking about that the other day too and you know the prophet said when you know Christian begins to say well I'm not a very good Christian well I I make so many steaks and I I My Flesh still it's I'm not very Christian said that's the devil's language never confess that you're not a good Christian confess that you make mistakes confess that you get your battle that you got trouble Paul said I fight then I Die daily brother bam said all my life he said I fight daily we are Overcomers by the grace of God what if there's nothing to overcome with just the wind would blow us any which way I like a real you know sometimes you have one of the hardest battles you go through and you think I don't know if I'll make this what and about the time you get out of it here comes the Lord said see now you're going to be more careful next time yeah you get a little more you get a little more careful sometimes we get a little careless but see in there Hebrews says concerning the age I like it how the the prophets and all them they they saw that we were that we weren't just starting in the race and I remember when we first came and I came into this message back in well I was in brother Brown's meetings in 1965 when brother Brown preached the marriages divorce series and uh I had been in brother Brown's meetings uh in 1957 when he was in Saskatoon and it was a place if you ever listen to those tapes is where brother Brown talks about the first poll the second poll and uh when it came to Saskatoon it happened in Regina the night before and he said I came the first person that came in the prayer line I think he described her where she's wearing a brown suit or something like that he said and before I could ask her or or take a hold of her hand instead of vision broke and I saw her name and he went through the prayer line and had the whole Services when he come back to when it came to Saskatoon he makes mention of it he said I went to the window and looked outside and I saw the vision that I saw years ago there was that there was that window on the on a river running by and it had some five Bridges or something like that and he said well you can listen to yourself and said the second pull is on but when we when we first when we first came to the light of the semester it was 1957 my my uh if you all of you I could tell your story as well as mine you know how it is we we all have a beginning and we all go through a growth to get out and in our little place was that way we had come through our parents had come through different religions like you all have we were a Mennonite background my great grandfather was a Aston Mennonite you know the word of the black poles and and they didn't believe in music and uh no singers in church were just men singers and and just the old religion deal forms well in 1942 my my dad uh that was the year I was born in 1942 and my dad became a Christian he had an experience something happened and the Lord healed him and uh the Lord healed him before he got saved and when he when he when he when the Lord Heal him had a he had a bad leg it had broken and and uh it was it wasn't healing and they didn't believe in going to doctors so an old columnist midnight preacher came over one night to visit him and had I said I I something said I felt something and I listened to this he said I know we're not we're forbidden to say this he said but uh you I I believe you'll believe me said you believe in praying for the sick and dad said I don't know but he said I'm sick and I'd like to be healed he said that's what I that's what I wanted to talk to you about you know Mark 16 he read and he read mark 16. basically hands on the sick and they shall recover he said now we're forbid to do this but I felt to come and talk to you about and dad said I want you to pray for me so the old congressman is he laid his hands on my dad prayed for him and his leg was twice the size that was just swollen and it was in springtime when he should be out there seating and so when the minister bit of goodbye he they went on home uh my uh my dad said uh to Mom said just get some compost and uh you know the uh bathe it a little bit with something one of the what they had the methods back in those days and and Mom said well if God is the Healer can now take care of the swelling and dad said sure you all right and he fell asleep he said he hadn't slept for more than about two hours for for a long time said he slept for six hours see when I woke up I looked down on my leg instead of a shriveled like the other one but it was all skin was all shriveled is it the swelling was completely down that was the beginning of my dad's experience with the Lord shortly after that somebody led him to Christ and was baptized in those days of course in the titles later on I had the privilege of seeing him baptized being rebapped by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but in 1957 when there was a bunch of they had been kicked out of the church and the latter rain movement was in our area and and they got kicked out of there and they got kicked out of the Pentecostal and you know sometimes the things that look so odd so strange but God's in it breaking the church and so on no look it isn't breaking churches it's calling them out sometimes and in the Pentecostal Church there they've gone so far to where they just wanted to form and there was a back and if any well some of you were my age so you know what in the 50s there was a move of God on the radio everywhere there was Divine Healing going on and uh you know I remember we picked up Waterloo Iowa and Dallas Texas and back in Saskatchewan you know where you'd wind it in in the evening get it you know with this preachers preaching healing Divine Healing and so it got in the local church there was a small country church maybe about 75 people in there and uh and a move went through there I was just a young boy then and we went through there and some people desired for more of God one day the pastor got up and he was a little frustrated because you know we pastors getting hurt sometimes but he was a little frustrated about the contention that was coming over this new light he called it and uh so uh is that Sunday morning I guess he must have acted on his own he said now how many is for that new light and uh so he said stand up so there's about maybe a third of the people got up and he looked around and he said well you can consider yourself dismissed and uh you know now you know that doesn't feel very good and uh my dad well I we were I was there just a little boy but I you know I didn't know what was going on I was 10 years old we walked outside and you know going down the stairs and stood there at the at the bottom of the stairway and uh everybody was real morbid women were crying and and uh so that was the church that they'd built and one of my uncles he had his hat and he hadn't put it on yet and he looked at him said what are you all so sad about and he's through his hat and he said whoopee he said I'm set free broke the whole atmosphere yeah that's right that's right that's what we've been praying for you know sometimes you act that way and it was exactly that time they got in with ladder rain for about three years and they saw the same Folly the old brothers says I saw it rise and fall I said it wasn't of God they won 12 Apostles they want brother Brown to be their their prophet and we lived right there 100 miles away all right my I was a young teenage boy going to be being with all the young people and uh foreign came to Saskatoon those ministers got up and they told our people my dad and my uncles and so on said now when when when brother Brown's coming to Saskatoon William Brown's come to saskatchew and said but don't go here and said he he's got strange Doctrine it's very strange and uh so he's well there again and my dad and my uncle and my brother Gunther was the three and I remember them talking over we just didn't know what he was talking about they said nobody tells us where we can go we're gonna go hear him so they went to the meeting I went and by the time this was on by now I was 15. and we went we went to the meetings and I've heard later that all the ministers sitting on the front row they knew brother Brown was a prophet but they wanted to use that gift so it say like it came from them and then give it to the people you know how that is they wouldn't just let him say truly is a man of God and when I when my dad saw that it struck him all of them and struck real hard and the Holy Spirit moved on him and said order the tapes of brother Branham before you leave go to the person in order said you wanted want the messages in order to take and I'd say this from that time as brother Brown preaches from that time the message came to our house I was 15 years old and brother my dad started reading brother Bam's messages that were there you know the prophet visits South Africa and some of them that were Orient print and uh I remember sitting there and dad would read a little while and then break into tears and say he said this reads just like the Bible and it was the beginning it was the beginning but it started a Revival in that little area until well over 300 people were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ within 10-year period after that just they began to hear and when the message started taking hold in our place it just started growing and of all the areas now just say this humbly you know sometimes you wonder why I looked at Lima I said so many Believers in the area must be some blessedness you know and oh we don't all see everything I drive but I don't need Shi I die with my wife after 60 years but I love her just the same and she sees it a lot less like me and uh but we we get along just fine we're not like you go to your church and I'll go to mine no there is only one church that's born into it you're not born in because you go to this Tabernacle here you support it with all your heart and I I would say this I humbly believe that you believe this is the most Spiritual Church there is in Lima well you shouldn't be here then if you if you didn't think that brother Brian said it was a more spiritual church to find yourself the most spiritual church so then go there support it and then don't speak bad at the other ones pray for them I'm a little charismatic that way you don't have to be you don't have to go to all throughout my church I've asked where people said uh brother mantle I uh we're we're leaving I said oh is there something wrong no we just feel that that other brother uh can feed my soul more I said God bless you if I have been able to lead you this far and someone could lead you further praise be to God as long as we get there as long as we get there we're not trying to just get them to the church we're trying to get them to Christ getting born again then go wherever they want to the discernment is on the inside because remember this is the dwelling place that God has he dwells in Tabernacles living Tabernacles he makes the decisions in you in your life I've seen the holy spirit so mightily what looks so wrong sometimes but he'll use it in a way that that the karma mine can never never understand you know and sometimes we get a little bit too comfortable in this world so God just shakes a little bit sends a little Sickness by said something that you can't maybe your children get a little wayward well I'll tell you one thing you know one time brother Bob they asked brother you've heard him say that to something they talked about about certain things they went through he said did you did it make you pray more I said yes well he said that's exactly what the Lord wanted just a little bit more of us the more that he can walk in and talk in see God knows the end from the beginning he knows how we are motivated and led and I've seen many times things that look so wrong you know I make a little confession here when I was in Lima and you know this is not this is off the Record so you don't have to you can shut the tapes off but when I moved here to Lima it was because when God called me to preach I don't know how many ministers in here oh yeah well Brothers you know when you're an evangelist and you go to churches that don't have a pastor what's the first thing they ask you could you come and pastor this church could you come and I got it all the time when I first started preaching Back in 1970 I went to just household as no there was no big churches we had we had probably uh back in those years we were probably 20 30 40 people in a little country church but brother Bissell we're still meeting in his house I preached for brother biscal in his house in the living room just a little storehouses like little places but the one thing we did have at that time to the ones that had come out we all could play in the same sandbox yeah we just didn't matter you believe the message amen you're my brother see then later on we get to moving along the more we get to know more about it and uh but when I moved to Lima here and it was some of the one is one of those things but I'll let you know sometimes not all the things we make decisions on always work for the glory of God sometimes it may work for our Glory they work against us and when I moved here I told Brother Tom Brown I said the Lord gave me permission I I said I prayed and I prayed and uh and one day I I was praying and something said why don't you go down for a year of course those of you that might not know this but there was a couple other brothers that were there that were ministers and in my heart I felt that that by going to help the church I could help them set up to the place to where they'd have a minister that would stay there because so when I called her the time I said I the Lord told me to come down for a year and how do you feel about that he said that'll be good and maybe that's the will of the Lord so I did and when I came down and we stayed for a year and I I tell you I felt good I said home the Lord is good then a year and a half went by and I was still feeling good but thank you Lord nothing said then one day one morning I walked out and prayed and just as sure as he told me to come here he said it's time to move back and let me tell you something moving back I was moving right back into a hornet's nest that was one of the biggest Strife there was in that church by adding another preacher to the ones that were there uh was not going to work good and it didn't so much so that you know it didn't work out but in there when you look back now when you look back on the things the things that look so wrong at that time but I know for a fact when the you know my brother remember one time brother Bram talks about the tax case and uh how that for five years he was he felt like he was trapped he said felt like I'd taken candy from a baby he said I I confessed it I'd go make things right and he said I just couldn't shake it said and then one day when he gets delivered from it he actually makes note of it and he says I haven't read it for a while but but he stops and he says just think of it for five years said media look at that for five years I've had this on my shoulders just couldn't shake it he said but it's gone the Lord Has Lifted us and I was that way I was I was I was that way and for five years and and I have to say this Lionel was a part of the loop maybe that's why it means more to me than maybe it's just maybe to you but to me it was my place where God trained me where God taught me that if he says to do something like he told the prophet you remember how he suffered for not going when the Lord told him to go you know what he said as long as even 1965. I heard him the other day he said as soon as I dropped back in the valley of Ohio Valley come down there in Jeffersonville said my throat starts clogging up he said I get he said I think he still holds it against me that I didn't go and it makes a statement like that he was a man but he knew that he'd made a vital mistake sometimes you pay for them and I could just say this as confession or as a testimony don't worry sometimes God will lead you but as I went through that Loop and I didn't know I was going I didn't know where I was going when I went back there I thought I'd go back in Evangelistic field but something didn't work didn't work at home but see the Lord had told me and dealt with me that I was supposed to start a church in Saskatoon before any of this started and when I went to the pastor to you know like sometimes ministers and I wanted them so I've got to I've got as many parts as anybody's got and not all good and sometimes I can be pretty it can't be so nice just ask the people that's around me so when I made that decision and followed I the Lord told me I was supposed to do that in the past and said if you do that I quit my my service and God bless his heart he's already passed on the other side he he died in the rejoice in the Lord he's nothing wrong with him it's just it was the Lord testing me I'll say this in in as a as a testimony when when I finally got around to it I was sitting there one day now we started the church we'd been put out of the local church there because of this message because of the doctrine that they you know sometimes people want to force you to leave a certain Doctrine well I've always said this if God doesn't reveal it to me and if I don't get it from the message in the messenger I don't want to hear somebody else so he said this or hear it said that no we've got tape recorders that's why the and I'm a little bit legal on this I know of one person that God told to make a recording of his messages he never told me to record my sermons but I told him to record his sermons he said there'll be a Time come when they will need it now how many degrees is that this is the time when so many doctrines were on this message Time After Time and I've said many times looks right looks look screwed looks good but unless the Lord reveals it to me and remember it never can get outside of the scripture that's not wrong saying what kept me but your understanding has to be at least scriptural absolutely sometimes we might you might sound a certain way but then search back see if the prophet said he took it back to the scripture and showed us where it was so take God in his word and when we were when when that when all it was and then when we got put out of the church I waited on the Lord and one day he said the time is now April 17th 1984. I went and Rental a building and I started Services started pastoring first services that we had was about 75 85 people out was about a week later when I was sitting in my chair and looking at reading the Bible and reading a message and I was reading where brother bam said this five years and I stopped and I counted April of 79 when we moved to Lima here April of 84 five years I say this humbly and the Lord hears me await left my shoulders and at peace came over me and I've never doubted that God called me to be the pastor there in Saskatoon 35 years later not one time did I question whether it's out of the will of God or in the will of God but sometimes the way to get there gets a little muddy you all are that way you've got different things brother bam had so many of those things we all have them but all the time I noticed one thing the Holy Spirit never left me he kept encouraging me along certain areas then one of the brothers came later on said brother how did you manage to keep how did you how did you do and all those things the doctrines and and they were just pushing on you real hard I said the one thing I did I prayed the Lord would never let a bitterness get in my soul I said whatever it takes Lord whatever it takes don't ever let me get bitter I can disagree with the person I believe we ought to be able to just bitterly disagree and still have the right attitude toward the person because remember it's a soul we're not just down on people because they differ and I've seen some people get real ugly and and mean with it God doesn't deal with his children that way he's not mean he said come follow me whosoever will you know brother Brian says I'm glad he didn't say William Branham you see because there's more William random than what he said but whosoever will let him come and drink of the Waters of Life freely I'm I'm I understand it's by the choice the election of God we understand clearly now that we come from God and we're going back to God now we understand why our lord Jesus one is here of course he bypassed the temptation of the flesh but we didn't we come to be tempted first then go back to our Theo offering pick up and when those two when you cross over you know her brother bam says over here said when you hear half of it's over here when when God came over here and took the place of a man he did so he could draw a man back to the place of God we just read it here and that's where we're going when this is over said someday he said either death or the Rapture will take you to the place where you get the other half then you'll worship like you really wanted to worship then we'll live like we really want to live then you'll think like you wanted to think then you'll be what you really want to be but here right now you'll never be what you really want to be that's not don't look down on that say thank you Lord as long as I'm here I need a savior I need a Healer I need a guide I need a shepherd I need him to guide me I need to pray daily that's it I need to read you know Bill Graham said read your Bible pray daily say well you know there's not a message tape that I haven't heard over and over and over again especially since 63 on after the mystery of God I went through those those are my real now real meat strong meat but oh it sets the person down you're not wanting to and fro after Doctrine after that but see what looks so wrong but someone I just shared that with you just I hope you understand what I'm saying is that God does that and I felt I felt I I you're you're in your life you have how many has ever had the little place where you figured yes you couldn't go any further I had it then when I left Lima here the second time my wife knows she said she she realized that I've never been so low in my life I kind of felt like brother bam didn't climbed the power poor grab a hold the wire I felt like taking my life I was so I was so low God had to bring me to that place to where later on when I was challenged and then you know what it doesn't feel good when you're challenged that if you don't believe it this way you don't do this thing you don't do this don't do this you're out now those weren't my enemies they were my closest friends but it's that time then you recognized where you stand in Christ then you realize it's not you it's Christ and you that holds the anchor and I like what brother Brown said it's not you holding on me holding on it's him holding on I know I know we sing hold on Lord I'm holding on Lord I'm holding on not really we just go through the motions sometimes say oh Lord I'm gonna lay a hold of you yeah that's good but really he does the holy he does the drawing it does the convicting he leads you guides you through the Still Water sometimes through what Troubled Waters but by the grace of God here I stand a man an old man now I was young once and now I'm old I've seen I've never I said like David I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread I told the Lord when he called me to preach I said Lord you take care of my finances you feed my family I'll preach we never did go hungry now the the Wolves had to pack their own picnic lunch that's true but they were all around us we got pretty sparse many times but that's also making up the body now I look at Lima here and I looked at later on when we left I seen how the Lord raised up other men and everyone and never despise the ones that God raises up sometimes they go the wrong way sometimes some misses the mark not all bad people but it's missing the mark and the prophet taught us very plain he said when you miss them I come back and said it or adjust it and shoot again I missed the market many Good Times but I don't regret them I'll have traveled for the Lord I don't regret the times I've trusted in his word I've seen the years go by many days without a song but I like singing But even I many days without a song gotta Grumble a little bit gotta complain a little bit but he doesn't like complainers you know that God I I was reading apart I won't read the quote I had someone but I just don't feel led to do it tonight but I but I just bear my heart before you I realize that that you know brother bam says simple things we were talking about God's language when we were in Tucson brother a bunch of us brothers were sitting around the table and talking about God's language and one of the brothers had been preaching on the language of God how that we speak our own language you know that nobody speaks like you what church could you go to talk about the seven Church ages where could you talk about the Seven Seals the mystery of Christ revealed where could you go and said that first sector where would you go and talk about the messengers that got raised up and not was not written in the Bible at all and now they're identified we're clearly identified back through history we got our own language we talk different than religions do we don't join we're born we're born into a kingdom not just a group of people but born into the kingdom of the king is the ruler and we are part of them we're born into that and and I like the whole brother and puts the soul sample said we're not he said it was never asked to join the Branham family right and then amazing how you never you can you can sit and discuss anything and uh nobody ever asked you to join the join the family if you have children sitting with their children and family not one time you've been challenged said if you don't get a birth certificate prove that you're part of the family you're out it's not even our vocabulary that's the way it is with this we're not thinking well one day I'll be saved no now are you safe now are you the sons of God you're not going to be down there you've always been a part of God but you were quickened in this age in this day and no other age will will act and work for us we're born with the spirit to take the challenges of this age I'm thankful to the grace of the Lord in spite of all those things you know you you just you just realize that God put it together none man putting it together it's God put it together here's a little can I get the music up here a little bit and sing one song I if I could I know I had it written down here somewhere and once in a while I forget songs and ah the little song that we sing too many miles behind me too many trials I've gone through too many cheers help me to remember there's too much to gain to lose do you know that one oh well give me a key of D or C try that um I've crossed the hot burning desert struggling the right road to choose somewhere up ahead there's cool clear water and defeat is one word I don't you [Music] too many senses lie behind the mountain to many rivers my feet have walked through too many Treasures I waiting over Yonder and there's too much to gain to lose too many miles behind me too many trials I've gone through Too Many Tears help me to remember that there's too much to gain to lose seeing that course of the too many sunsets lie behind the mountains too many rivers my feet have walked through too many Treasures I waiting over Yonder and there's too much to gain and I don't regret them out that I've traveled for the Lord and I don't regret the times that I've trusted in his word I've seen the years go by many days without a song but I don't regret a mind that I've traveled for the Lord why don't you pray with me Lord it's a great journey oh there's no way we can explain some things that you lead us through but there's one thing that we weren't born with and that's character it takes the trials and the tests and the moldings and the shaping they bring forth the christ-like character we thank you for every test and every trial knowing that we come from you we're going back to you but this is an Earthly journey in here you become Our Savior Our Redeemer our healer our deliverer Lord I pray you'll bless everyone in this Tabernacle

pressing on this is holding holding this word in my heart and keep moving forward it's all going to work out for the glory of God amen we may we all we've all had trials and you know we've all had testings and we've all had highs and we've all had lows and if God allows the things to continue on as they are we're going to have many more we've all all of us try hard to avoid them at all costs we try to circumvent detour navigate around every trial but God he he's got a better plan than we do he brings us right into the middle of it because there's something to be gained in each one his word
