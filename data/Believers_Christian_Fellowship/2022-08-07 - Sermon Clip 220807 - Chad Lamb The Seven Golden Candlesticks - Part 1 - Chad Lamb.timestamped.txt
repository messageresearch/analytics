[0:02] in chapter two verse one in ephesus he
[0:04] ties us right back to exodus to show us

[0:10] likened to an almond tree
[0:13] and when we read it
[0:15] his knobs his flowers his bowls his
[0:19] branches his his his
[0:21] but now when we come to the lord's day
[0:24] and he turns he sees
[0:26] the same form of candlesticks only now

[0:35] bride and now the reflection amen of
[0:38] that tree is now reflected all the way

[1:31] cold night cycle of death and and winter
[1:34] amen where there was nothing left but a
[1:36] stump but he said i will restore and he
[1:38] begins to bring the branches and he
[1:40] begins to bring the leaves and he begins
[1:42] to bring the fruit and in the lord's day
[1:44] at the end of it all it's the full
[1:45] revelation of the fool amen what the
[1:47] bride was intended to be he has brought
[1:50] the bride tree back to life in the end
[1:52] time she has a resurrection life amen
[1:56] and what kind of resurrection life amen

[2:17] church ages amen the rest of them that
[2:20] are laying in the ground they'll come
