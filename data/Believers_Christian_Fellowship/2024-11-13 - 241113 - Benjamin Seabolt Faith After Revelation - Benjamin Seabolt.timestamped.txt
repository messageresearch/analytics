[12:56] Lord man he certainly

[13:03] not let's just bow our heads for a word
[13:05] of
[13:07] prayer precious Lord Jesus
[13:10] we want to approach you this evening
[13:13] with Thanksgiving in our heart
[13:16] Lord that we can have this privilege of
[13:21] gathering around you the revealed
[13:25] word with the revelation of knowing how
[13:29] how you have appeared in our age in our
[13:32] day Lord may we never take that for
[13:35] granted and father as we would come to
[13:39] this Junction of the service Lord we
[13:42] would just present ourselves to you with
[13:45] humility father knowing that there is no
[13:49] capability no
[13:51] worthiness to feed your sheep
[13:54] Lord father I stand here as a mortal t
[13:59] ask with something that no mortal Can Do
[14:02] Lord so we would just ask that you would
[14:04] come here this evening
[14:06] that you would do what your word said
[14:10] that you would do father and that by the
[14:12] foolishness of preaching that Souls
[14:15] would be saved and that your kingdom
[14:16] would be established so father this is
[14:19] your method this is your way and we Just
[14:22] Surrender ourselves to that both speaker
[14:25] and
[14:25] hearer we would ask that you would just
[14:28] come have the preeminence here this
[14:30] evening and accomplish what you've set
[14:33] this service for to accomplish Lord we
[14:36] ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus
[14:38] Christ
[14:40] amen God bless you this evening if you
[14:42] have your Bible we'll turn to Mark the
[14:45] 11th
[14:53] chapter Mark the 11th chapter I'd like
[14:56] to
[14:59] speak this evening on a title of Faith
[15:04] after
[15:06] Revelation Faith after Revelation and I
[15:10] know some of you immediately have the
[15:12] thought that faith is revelation and I
[15:14] know
[15:15] that but we're going to talk about faith
[15:18] after Revelation and I don't intend to
[15:21] present anything Earth shattering to you
[15:24] this is not something that we haven't
[15:26] heard before but I think it's a
[15:28] principle
[15:29] that maybe we can strike from a little
[15:31] bit of a different angle and maybe just
[15:35] encourage somebody this evening um but
[15:38] with that being said I've got some notes
[15:41] here but I don't feel to teach this
[15:42] evening I just feel to be here um well
[15:46] actually I don't feel to be here but I'm
[15:48] here so here I am uh but I just feel
[15:52] relax this evening and just let the Lord
[15:55] do what he wants to so if you have
[15:57] something specific that that you need an
[16:00] answer for or that you're dealing with
[16:03] this is an opportunity because I'm I'm
[16:06] not feeling pressed to stick to my notes
[16:09] I'm not feeling pressed to be here to
[16:11] midnight either but I just say that to
[16:14] let the spirit have Liberty here don't
[16:16] be afraid to to pull and pull me
[16:19] sideways if you need
[16:21] to but here in Mark the 11th chapter
[16:24] we're going to read this very familiar
[16:26] portion of scripture beginning with
[16:27] verse 23
[16:30] uh let's begin with verse
[16:32] 22 and Jesus answering saith unto them
[16:36] have faith in
[16:40] God for verily I say unto you that
[16:42] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[16:44] be thou REM removed and be thou cast
[16:48] into the sea and shall not doubt in his
[16:50] heart but shall believe that those
[16:52] things which he saith shall come to pass
[16:56] he shall have whatsoever
[16:59] he saith amen therefore I say unto you
[17:04] whatsoever things ye
[17:06] desire when ye pray believe that you
[17:10] receive them and ye shall have
[17:14] them let's turn to
[17:25] Deuteronomy um 17
[17:29] and
[17:31] six Deuteronomy
[17:34] 17 and
[17:38] 6 reads as
[17:40] such at the mouth of two witnesses or
[17:45] three
[17:46] Witnesses shall he that is worthy of
[17:49] death be put to death but at the mouth
[17:52] of one witness he shall not be put to
[17:56] death God bless you as you would have
[17:59] your seats this
[18:03] evening this
[18:06] is uh inspiration that actually
[18:11] I've sat on for several months now um
[18:15] but when I
[18:17] first was looking and studying on the
[18:21] pride series that I did that was closely
[18:26] tied to brother random when he had
[18:29] the incident with the spoken word coming
[18:31] into existence and him manifesting that
[18:34] through speaking the squirrels into
[18:36] existence and there was a
[18:39] portion of that situation that really
[18:42] jumped out to me and really struck me
[18:45] but I was you know really in a certain
[18:47] Channel there and I didn't want to
[18:49] deviate off of that didn't feel to but I
[18:51] want to go back and grab that now uh
[18:54] because I think it's very noteworthy it
[18:56] was to me and it's kind kind of altered
[19:01] my thinking um let's read Revelation
[19:06] 12 before we jump into
[19:19] this Revelation 12:
[19:24] 10 this ties directly to the scripture
[19:27] that we just read in
[19:29] deuteron me um 17 as you'll see
[19:34] later it says and I heard a loud voice
[19:37] saying in heaven now has come salvation
[19:40] and strength and the kingdom of our God
[19:44] and the power of His Christ for the
[19:47] accuser of our Brethren is cast
[19:51] down which accused them before our God
[19:56] day and
[19:57] night so we're going to look here in the
[20:00] message speak to this
[20:02] mountain and we all are very familiar
[20:05] with this story but I just want to dig
[20:07] down in some of the details of this
[20:09] because I feel sometimes that we read it
[20:12] a couple times and then we just pass
[20:14] over it and we refer to it as the you
[20:16] know the time the prophet spoke
[20:17] squirrels into
[20:19] existence and we kind of make it a story
[20:24] rather than a situation rather than an
[20:26] event and I believe we can maybe missed
[20:29] some of the importance of what all was
[20:31] going on here during this
[20:33] event but brother brandom is speaking
[20:35] and he says and that scripture came to
[20:38] me again he says whatsoever you say
[20:42] believe that what you say shall come to
[20:44] pass and you can have what you say well
[20:48] I thought and I'm paraphrasing a lot of
[20:50] this for time's sake uh just so you know
[20:53] and he says well I thought why does that
[20:55] scripture keep coming to me when I can't
[20:58] preach on on it because I don't know
[21:00] nothing about
[21:01] it and he says do you think it was the
[21:05] prophets talking well I thought that's
[21:08] right if the person through the
[21:12] atonement Sanctified by the blood of
[21:14] Jesus Christ can live in a sphere with
[21:18] God so close that he can be so wrapped
[21:22] up completely in God by the blood of
[21:24] Jesus that it wouldn't be him talking it
[21:27] would be the Holy Spirit speaking these
[21:30] things so brother brandom is struggling
[21:33] with the scripture he says I wouldn't
[21:34] touch it I wouldn't preach on it I
[21:35] wouldn't present it to a congregation
[21:37] because I don't understand it I don't
[21:38] know if it's prec Covenant post Covenant
[21:41] before the cross after the cross I can't
[21:42] tie it into the scripture of how this
[21:44] specifically applies I don't know what
[21:46] to do with it and he's reasoning this
[21:49] over in his mind of how he would explain
[21:51] it and God's dealing with him on this
[21:56] subject and he says
[22:01] and no more than I said that so he the
[22:04] spirit's revealing this to him and
[22:06] brother brandom's confirming it um that
[22:09] yes you know if if that was God
[22:11] anointing the person it would be the
[22:13] same way as the prophet speaking and it
[22:15] wouldn't be the person speaking anymore
[22:17] if through the blood of Jesus Christ
[22:19] they're Sanctified and God has laying
[22:20] this on their heart to speak it wouldn't
[22:22] be the person anymore it would be the
[22:24] same as Christ speaking through Moses or
[22:26] Christ speaking through Abraham or
[22:28] Christ speaking through any of the
[22:29] prophets and he said as soon as I agreed
[22:32] to
[22:33] that no more than I'd said that till the
[22:35] anointing of the Holy Spirit struck me
[22:38] like I have never had it before in all
[22:41] of my
[22:43] life God knows that I raised up to my
[22:46] feet I got scared and something said to
[22:48] me now this is the beginning of your new
[22:50] ministry now ask what you will and it
[22:52] shall be given you and I stood there I
[22:56] don't want to be a fanatic
[22:59] God knows I want to be sane and just and
[23:03] honest and faithful and
[23:06] true right this is a man who has learned
[23:11] a few lessons in
[23:14] life because I'm telling you here and
[23:16] now I would have failed that test the
[23:18] minute that I thought I had a whisper of
[23:20] inspiration to speak and ask for
[23:21] anything that I wanted I'm going to give
[23:23] it a
[23:24] try but he backs up and he says
[23:29] just a minute I do not want to be led
[23:31] into
[23:35] fanaticism who is this speaking to me
[23:38] what is this speaking to me is this
[23:40] scriptural is this too far or do I have
[23:43] a scriptural bearing for where I'm
[23:45] standing at I'm not just going to try
[23:49] something right what a
[23:53] lesson what a
[23:55] lesson but this point that he's at in
[23:58] his life he's passed this test a few
[24:01] times he's not trigger happy so to speak
[24:06] he says I want to be sane and just and
[24:09] honest and faithful and true you see
[24:11] what his motives are doesn't say I want
[24:14] to be flashy I want to have a bigger
[24:15] Ministry I want to be
[24:19] impressive big big difference when this
[24:21] comes big
[24:25] difference what would I ask for
[24:32] ask what you will and it will be given
[24:33] to you I don't want to be led into
[24:35] fanaticism I want to make sure that I'm
[24:37] doing things right here's a good idea
[24:39] maybe I'll just ask him what I should
[24:41] ask
[24:44] for what
[24:47] wisdom this is how I want to be I don't
[24:50] want to be flip it with my mouth I don't
[24:52] want to be flip it with my
[24:54] life but I want to approach every
[24:57] situation
[24:59] whether it's a high anointing or a low
[25:01] anointing or somewhere in
[25:03] between what would you ask for what
[25:06] would you have me
[25:09] do would you have
[25:12] me bind this and cast it
[25:17] out or would you have me grip my teeth
[25:20] and bear
[25:22] it because you're going to teach me
[25:24] something
[25:27] right God
[25:29] and something just as plain as you hear
[25:31] my voice saying aren't you hunting and
[25:34] you have no game I said that's right I
[25:38] said if I'm doing anything wrong you
[25:41] forgive
[25:43] me if it is Lord then I'll take you by
[25:47] your word he's not jumping into this
[25:50] both
[25:51] feet and this is an anointing like he's
[25:55] never had before
[25:58] you can see how much Faith he's got in
[26:00] the
[26:02] anointing remember brother brandom says
[26:05] that Satan can come I better get back
[26:08] over here I'm going to get carried away
[26:10] he said Satan can come and give you a
[26:13] supernatural feeling and a glorious
[26:15] feeling and it'll make you feel that
[26:17] you're saved and you're
[26:21] not what's he doing he's reverting back
[26:24] to the word he's reverting back to the
[26:26] word he's checking his spirit he's
[26:28] checking his motives he's checking his
[26:30] objectives he's checking
[26:34] everything and
[26:36] then he Ventures forward very carefully
[26:40] if this is you Lord if it's not just
[26:43] check me tell me I'm wrong correct me
[26:45] but if this is you I will take you at
[26:48] your
[26:50] word I thought I'll find something
[26:52] impossible and I found an old Locust
[26:55] Thicket and I said there shall come a
[26:57] young red squirrel on on that old naked
[26:59] limb out yonder and I'll shoot him from
[27:00] right there and there came the
[27:05] squirrel he speaks it and it's
[27:07] immediately there no
[27:12] delay I turned the gun aimed up through
[27:14] the little telescopic lens I seen his
[27:17] eye I shot it and it dropped
[27:20] down so I stood there just a little
[27:24] bit and I said Lord if that was you
[27:32] I'm sorry Saints I failed the test like
[27:35] I felt this little inkling it said do
[27:37] this I did it and it happened praise God
[27:39] it's the Lord full steam
[27:43] ahead you know what happens when you get
[27:45] older is you walk
[27:47] slower
[27:51] amen you know why you walk
[27:54] slower because if you fall down you're
[27:56] not going to heal us quickly and you
[27:58] break
[28:00] easier it's not necessarily A Bad Thing
[28:02] to walk slower might just mean that
[28:04] you're older or it might just mean
[28:06] you're more
[28:08] mature if this was
[28:14] you your Bible
[28:17] said two or three Witnesses is a
[28:22] confirmation where does he go under the
[28:26] the most anointing that he ever felt in
[28:28] his entire life where does he
[28:32] go right back to the
[28:34] scripture if this was you the first was
[28:37] glorious the first was immediate I've
[28:40] it's
[28:42] manifested but is it scripture because
[28:45] the scripture says it has to happen two
[28:46] or three times to be
[28:51] you is a
[28:53] confirmation it can't happen a second
[28:56] time
[28:58] this is him just being honest with
[29:00] us it can't happen a second time but I
[29:05] thought believe I'll try
[29:08] it this is
[29:11] amazing because how many of us have
[29:14] stuck in our head what great faith the
[29:17] prophet used when he manifested the
[29:19] third pole as speaking squirrels into
[29:21] existence but that's not what he says he
[29:25] says I don't know maybe I'll try oh it
[29:27] happen
[29:28] I don't it can't happen a second time
[29:30] you know what I think I'll just try
[29:35] it I want to ask you whose Faith was
[29:39] this who was wanting to do something
[29:42] here amen
[29:45] right who was making this
[29:48] work the prophet is saying I don't even
[29:50] know if this is scriptural I'm going to
[29:52] you know put my toe in and see if the
[29:53] water's warm it worked but I got to have
[29:56] at least another witness for to be God
[29:59] and it can't happen a second time anyhow
[30:01] but I think I'll try
[30:04] it and I said and there shall come
[30:06] another squirrel and set over there and
[30:08] the bunch of grape Vines right there and
[30:10] I took my finger down and I looked back
[30:13] I did not see any
[30:16] squirrel this is
[30:18] different because the first time he no
[30:22] sooner spoke it and it was there
[30:24] immediately
[30:28] the second time he speaks it and he
[30:31] points and he looks and there is no
[30:36] manifestation this is the point that I
[30:38] want to get to this
[30:41] evening there's a
[30:44] delay it's not like the first
[30:48] time God
[30:51] immediately changes his
[30:55] manifestation I looked back and I
[30:58] thought well what is that there pulled
[31:01] up my telescope and there set a squirrel
[31:03] looking right at me 50 yards away I shot
[31:04] the squirrel walked over and picked him
[31:06] up the first time he speaks it and it's
[31:08] immediate the second time he speaks it
[31:10] he points there's a little bit of a
[31:12] delay he looks
[31:14] again and there's a squirrel shoots it
[31:17] and kills it I took off my hat I said
[31:19] certainly thank you sir I believe you
[31:21] now and you're going to do something for
[31:22] your
[31:26] people people
[31:29] I'm hunting Speaking Animals into
[31:31] existence and shooting
[31:33] them and he's thinking about other
[31:39] people why did he get to this
[31:44] point is because he already had the
[31:46] character
[31:47] developed that when the most greatest
[31:50] anointing that he has ever felt comes on
[31:52] him he approaches it scripturally he
[31:55] approaches it reverently and soon as it
[31:57] man manest himself itself he doesn't get
[32:01] caught up in what a great person he is
[32:04] he starts praising God and thanking him
[32:06] that he's going to do something for the
[32:09] people there is no other people out
[32:11] there in the woods for him I'm pretty
[32:13] sure this is just God doing something
[32:15] for
[32:16] him but that's not what he says thank
[32:18] you now you're going to do something for
[32:20] the
[32:21] people look at where this man's heart
[32:24] had came to it's not about me it's not
[32:27] about me getting my limit of squirrels
[32:28] today it's not about me getting what I
[32:30] want and having this power to do this
[32:32] and that thank you God you're going to
[32:34] do something for your people
[32:36] amen right I
[32:40] wonder you know what I wonder
[32:49] amen so I sure appreciate it father dear
[32:52] and I said now I'm going
[32:54] home he said but you wanted three
[33:00] well I said
[33:02] yes now that seemed like it was
[33:05] something inside of
[33:07] me I did not hear a
[33:11] voice but just something inside of me
[33:15] said that
[33:18] right the first is an audible voice
[33:22] convincing him do this do this do this
[33:25] he does it manifestation
[33:27] the second is an audible voice do this
[33:30] prove me he does it slight delay
[33:36] manifestation the third is he's praise
[33:39] God you're going to do something for
[33:40] your people while I'm going home uh
[33:42] excuse me you said three you wanted
[33:49] three no Audible
[33:52] Voice still Small Voice in his heart
[33:57] Where's God trying to get
[34:02] to look at this story and how fastly
[34:05] it's unfolding but look how quickly God
[34:08] is changing how he's manifesting himself
[34:12] amen Audible Voice Audible Voice still
[34:15] Small Voice in your heart
[34:17] yeah remember God never goes backwards
[34:20] God always goes forward in maturity
[34:28] I wonder if we would rather hear the
[34:30] voice in our natural
[34:34] ear I would I'm just being
[34:39] honest it's not what God wants right or
[34:42] that's where God would have led to right
[34:45] he's leading the opposite way he's
[34:48] leading through a natural manifestation
[34:51] Supernatural
[34:53] anointing and he's degrading to just a
[34:56] still small voice in his
[35:04] heart I did not hear a voice but just
[35:06] something inside of me said well I
[35:09] thought I'll make this one so radical
[35:11] it'll have to be something Supernatural
[35:13] and I said it shall come to pass that
[35:14] there will be a young squirrel go out on
[35:16] that limb set on the end of the limb and
[35:17] look over at the farmers cutting their
[35:19] corn shucking their corn and I'll kill
[35:21] him from this tree right here and I
[35:23] stood there a
[35:25] minute no squirrel
[35:27] looked
[35:29] back about five minutes
[35:32] passed no
[35:34] squirrel I thought well this is enough
[35:37] anyhow it's getting time for me to go
[35:39] and I started to walk away and as I did
[35:41] something said but you've already spoke
[35:46] it he's already checked out he's going
[35:49] home praise the Lord see you later
[35:52] excuse
[35:54] me you've already spoke something in my
[35:57] name yeah uh Mark 11:22 ringing any
[36:04] bells what happened to our story of the
[36:07] great powerful Prophet harnessing the
[36:11] creative power of God
[36:13] and I thank God for an honest
[36:18] Prophet sir how easily he could have
[36:22] exploited this he's in the woods Alone
[36:25] by himself me and you would have never
[36:28] known any
[36:29] different right he could have told
[36:31] whatever story he wanted that's right
[36:35] amen anyway it's getting time for me to
[36:38] go and I started to walk away and as I
[36:40] did something said but you've already
[36:41] spoke
[36:43] it I waited another 10 minutes if my
[36:46] West Virginia math is adding uppr right
[36:48] that's at least 15
[36:50] minutes amen no
[36:55] squirrel and I said said how could a
[36:58] squirrel ever get out there and I
[37:02] started to walk away like that walked
[37:05] away twice after he spoke the spoken
[37:09] word gave up on it and walked away
[37:16] twice something said are you
[37:23] doubting oh maybe here's the point
[37:29] see God knows how to school you oh this
[37:32] is schooling going on I thought this was
[37:36] just great manifestation of the spoken
[37:38] word returning to the Fallen hybrid
[37:40] human
[37:42] race God knows how to school
[37:45] you this is the part that was astounding
[37:48] to me you would think I would think I
[37:50] won't put you in the same basket with me
[37:53] but I would think when you come to this
[37:55] point that God has released release the
[37:58] power of the spoken word unto your
[37:59] tongue you have arrived in the faith
[38:05] game amen and in all reality he was just
[38:09] getting started that's
[38:13] right you've got the power of the spoken
[38:16] word put on your
[38:18] tongue and God is still schooling you in
[38:22] faith let me ask you what does God care
[38:26] more about you having the power of the
[38:29] spoken word as Adam did or
[38:34] faith because he's using this
[38:37] manifestation of the spoken word to gain
[38:41] faith in the
[38:42] prophet he's you if you use something to
[38:47] get something that means the something
[38:49] that you're getting is more valuable
[38:52] than what you're
[38:53] using he is using what we what
[38:58] I thought for years would be the
[39:01] Pinnacle of your walk with
[39:03] Christ your restoration to what Adam
[39:07] lost and the prophets
[39:10] telling this is what God used to school
[39:12] me this was just something that he was
[39:15] using to train
[39:17] me what he was really after was are you
[39:21] still doubting what I told
[39:25] you and he was
[39:28] I'm not saying that he said it walked
[39:31] away
[39:32] twice he said no I'm not doubting and
[39:36] just as I said that coming out on the
[39:38] limb came a young squirrel walked right
[39:39] out on the end of the limb stood looked
[39:42] over at the farmers and I shot him from
[39:43] right there making my Three
[39:47] Squirrels am happy ending right two
[39:51] weeks later I was down in the state of
[39:53] Kentucky where squirrel season was still
[39:55] in friend of mine Mr woods and his
[39:56] brother-in-law
[39:58] and he said ask what you will and it'll
[40:01] be given
[40:04] you I said then if that be you I shall
[40:07] have my Three Squirrels this morning
[40:08] gray squirrels those were Reds up in
[40:11] Indiana and I said I shall have my Three
[40:14] Squirrels something said which way will
[40:16] they come
[40:18] from and I
[40:21] thought there it
[40:23] is I could hear it just as plain as you
[40:26] can hear me
[40:28] and I said one will come from this way
[40:30] one will come from back that way and one
[40:31] will come from that way I leaned up
[40:33] against a little tree and waited for a
[40:35] few minutes I didn't see any squirrels
[40:38] and it was getting late time to go back
[40:43] almost
[40:45] that's wonderful pretty
[40:50] powerful see how different this is than
[40:53] the first
[40:55] time the first time it was
[40:58] idiot the second time was a slight delay
[41:01] couple minutes not even a couple minutes
[41:04] he looked looked back look there third
[41:08] time was at least 15
[41:09] minutes fourth
[41:12] time it's time to go home and nothing
[41:15] showed
[41:17] up
[41:19] why why if you have the power of the
[41:22] spoken word on your tongue why is there
[41:24] a delay here yeah
[41:28] amen because that's not what's most
[41:34] important this is astounding to
[41:38] me that manifestation is not what's most
[41:48] important now this is the second
[41:53] time second hunting trip that this
[41:56] happens
[41:58] and God does not start out where he
[42:00] started out the last
[42:02] time he starts out this hunting
[42:07] situation with a long delay right from
[42:10] the
[42:12] beginning I looked back across the hill
[42:15] and way up 125 yards I guessing
[42:17] something looked like it was on a stump
[42:19] a gray squirrel very small I looked
[42:21] through the telescope I couldn't tell if
[42:23] it was a squirrel or not I kept watching
[42:25] it jumped off the stump started down by
[42:26] the side of the tree well that's an
[42:28] awful long shot I'm here to tell you if
[42:30] you shoot a squirrel at 125 yards I want
[42:32] to know about
[42:34] it I can barely hit a deer at that
[42:37] distance with a gun let alone a squirrel
[42:40] 125 yards I just knelt down on my knee
[42:42] laid my gun across the side of my hand
[42:44] killed the
[42:46] squirrel brother random makes a comment
[42:48] he says it's not nice to shoot him up
[42:49] close it's not Sportsman
[42:53] like I'm glad he didn't Define what
[42:55] close was
[42:58] cuz I like them the closer the
[43:01] better I call it grocery shopping not
[43:08] sportsmanship I said that then the next
[43:11] one will have to come from this way I
[43:14] waited about 15
[43:17] minutes so now he's waited I'm guessing
[43:20] all morning finally a manifestation this
[43:24] time you only Waits about 15 minutes
[43:28] stand
[43:30] by here comes a squirrel just as I
[43:32] started to level down second squirrel
[43:34] shows up oh you know we're doing good
[43:38] now first one was just hung up a little
[43:40] bit here's the other three the other two
[43:42] that's my three I said oh praise the
[43:45] Lord there's the second one there they
[43:47] are so I raised up shot the first one
[43:48] killed him right dead hit him right
[43:50] through the eye and then this other
[43:51] Squirrel Run jumped up on a long and it
[43:53] ran over the log picked up a hickory nut
[43:55] started eating it just perfect shot
[43:57] about 50 yard I thought there's my
[43:59] second squirrel that's 1 2 3 just what I
[44:02] asked
[44:04] for he's got it all figured out doesn't
[44:09] he I hope I'm not the only one that can
[44:12] relate to this yes
[44:15] sir yes sir got it all figured out I
[44:18] laid my gun down and shot and I hit the
[44:20] log now out of about 149 squirrels this
[44:23] year I've only missed five shots so then
[44:26] I thought well how did did I miss that
[44:28] squirrel I started waiting till almost
[44:32] dark I said if the other squirrel
[44:36] comes if if the other squirrel comes I'm
[44:40] going to have to shoot him real close to
[44:42] me cuz there's a Thicket here and he has
[44:44] to come down through this Thicket the
[44:45] only way he can well I thought well it
[44:47] wasn't so this
[44:53] time five squirrels he spoke into
[44:56] existence
[44:59] he says well it's not so this
[45:04] time
[45:06] I want to pray that one day I will be as
[45:09] honest as this man but I don't know that
[45:12] I have the courage yet to be as honest
[45:14] as this
[45:17] man that anointing maybe I just happened
[45:19] to get those
[45:25] two so I went up room picked up my
[45:27] squirrels and started
[45:32] home this delay was so long he gave up
[45:35] again and started
[45:38] home
[45:39] why we have to ask
[45:42] ourselves
[45:45] why and it was real dark in the hollow
[45:48] and I started down through the hollow
[45:49] something said to me what about that
[45:51] other
[45:53] squirrel and I said well I've already
[45:55] got to and it's so late now I can't even
[45:57] see through my scope hardly it's too
[45:59] late to get one now and I started on
[46:05] down God speaks to him reminds him about
[46:09] it and he says it's too dark
[46:20] now something said turn and go
[46:25] back and get the other another
[46:30] squirrel you've already said
[46:36] it so I turned and I hadn't walked about
[46:39] 10 steps and I seen a squirrel run up I
[46:41] mean this sounds good turn around and go
[46:43] back and get it while I walk about 10
[46:44] steps there it
[46:47] is stand by that's
[46:51] right and I seen a squirrel run up a
[46:53] tree about 60 or 70 yards from me so
[46:56] dark it had to be just the light across
[46:57] the top of the mountain or I wouldn't
[46:59] have seen
[46:59] him after a while looked like a nod on
[47:02] the tree stuck around and I thought
[47:04] that's his head so I shot the squirrel
[47:06] ran down a tree and I heard something
[47:08] hit the leaves I thought he must have
[47:09] jumped off and about that time about 15
[47:13] yards from it another squirrel run up a
[47:15] tree and I said that was the squirrel
[47:16] that I missed he run around run up that
[47:18] tree so I watched real close it was so
[47:21] dark and the wind blowing so hard I
[47:23] thought I seen some leaves with
[47:24] something moving and I thought well I'm
[47:25] going to shoot at it anyhow now and I
[47:27] shot and I heard the squirrel hit the
[47:29] ground plunk it really killed him
[47:31] outright if you're a squirrel Hunter you
[47:33] know what that means when they thr It On
[47:35] The Ground they're
[47:38] dead I really killed him outright he
[47:41] knows this he knows that sound that's a
[47:44] dead
[47:45] squirrel said well I must have missed
[47:47] him on that tree but I got him over here
[47:51] just a little bit out of line from where
[47:54] he had pointed
[48:00] I missed him where I pointed that I was
[48:02] going to kill him at and I shot him just
[48:04] a little bit over
[48:08] here says I'll go over and get him so I
[48:11] walked up the hill and when I got to the
[48:13] first tree there laid my
[48:18] squirrel the first one right in line
[48:22] exactly the way I pointed
[48:27] well that makes me four he gave me one
[48:30] for good measure that's good I said I I
[48:33] asked for three and I got four that's
[48:36] good now I'm going to paraphrase a lot
[48:38] of this so for time's
[48:40] sake the long story of it is he can't
[48:43] find this fourth
[48:45] squirrel if you've read the story you
[48:47] know this he can't find it he killed the
[48:49] three that he spoke right where he
[48:51] pointed
[48:55] at but he thought thought that that
[48:57] third one he had missed ran down ran up
[49:00] another tree and shot it just a little
[49:02] bit out of line from where he pointed
[49:03] well that wasn't the case he had killed
[49:04] the first one or the third one right
[49:06] exactly where he pointed and this was
[49:08] truly just a fourth random squirrel in
[49:11] the wrong place at the wrong
[49:13] time runs up a Trey brother brandham
[49:16] shoots him and this one the first one he
[49:18] thought he'd missed but this one falls
[49:21] out with a plunk that a him in all his
[49:24] squirrel hunting years knows that's a
[49:26] dead
[49:28] squirrel but he goes up there and he
[49:30] cannot find this squirrel the first the
[49:34] third one he didn't think he' killed it
[49:36] this one he knows he's killed it but he
[49:38] found the third one can't find the
[49:40] fourth one
[49:44] yeah but I thought you had the power of
[49:47] the spoken word on your tongue why can't
[49:48] things just go
[49:51] smooth why all of these ups and downs
[49:55] and we leaving back and forth
[50:04] and
[50:06] so he gets a stick runs it in a stump
[50:10] thinks that if the squirrel's in that
[50:11] stump he can feel something in there
[50:13] moving up and down but he can't cut into
[50:15] the stump to get the squirrel out so he
[50:18] goes back to the house shares the story
[50:20] with the Brethren he says they're all
[50:21] rejoicing praising the Lord and then
[50:24] brother Tony one of the deacons there
[50:27] poor guy he says he don't even remember
[50:29] saying these things but brother Brandon
[50:31] said he had to say these things but he
[50:34] says well brother Brandon we'll know if
[50:36] you're telling the truth when you go
[50:38] back up there in the morning with this
[50:39] knife and cut that squirrel out of the
[50:41] hole when you come back with that
[50:43] squirrel will know that you've told the
[50:44] truth and it just kills brother brandom
[50:47] that's right totally crushes him as a
[50:51] man he says uh he says Tony he didn't
[50:55] say this he thought this this he said
[50:57] brother Tony would you doubt me telling
[50:59] you the
[51:01] truth after all these years and uh I
[51:04] think he had something with his wife
[51:06] that was supernaturally
[51:08] healed so I mean for brother Tony to say
[51:11] this was just like you know saying I
[51:13] don't know whether I believe anything
[51:15] you got to say or not I mean just
[51:16] crushed him why you've got the power the
[51:20] spoken word on your tongue and you can
[51:23] still have your feelings
[51:24] hurt by a brother
[51:27] who loves you who in a couple hours say
[51:29] I don't even remember saying those
[51:31] things I didn't mean it like that I'm
[51:34] sorry why is this
[51:39] happening I'll tell you
[51:42] why but the Lord knows how to train and
[51:45] what to
[51:49] do oh so this isn't just about the
[51:54] manifestation of what Adam lost this
[51:56] this is still about my
[52:01] faith so going on up there that
[52:04] anointing struck me again and said if it
[52:06] isn't there Say it'll be there and
[52:08] you'll find the
[52:10] squirrel and I shall find the squirrel I
[52:14] said up on the mountain I went thought
[52:16] no need for me fearing anymore cuz I'm
[52:18] going to find it that's all I done said
[52:20] it and the Lord said when when the
[52:21] anointing was on me when I said anything
[52:23] it would be that way goes up there
[52:25] searches searches searches searches
[52:27] searches cannot find the
[52:31] squirrel can't find it gives up starts
[52:36] leaving I said I can't find it where is
[52:41] it
[52:42] at something said to me look under that
[52:45] piece of bark and I said yes praise the
[52:48] lord it's under the bark and I went over
[52:49] and picked up the bark and something
[52:51] said but what if it isn't under there
[52:57] why all this back and forth It's either
[52:59] there or it's not there right I either
[53:02] believe that it's there or I don't why
[53:05] why all the back and
[53:07] forth and I said oh it'll be under there
[53:10] and I picked it up and there was no
[53:19] squirrel interesting
[53:24] huh like I thought if you had the power
[53:27] of the spoken word on your tongue if you
[53:29] would just speak it that would be that
[53:30] and there would be no testing about
[53:33] anything there would be no trials and
[53:35] tribulations about
[53:38] anything I me remember this is God
[53:41] speaking not a
[53:44] man and I picked it up there was no
[53:47] squirrel and I thought that was the same
[53:50] inspiration that told me the three would
[53:52] be here the same inspiration was on me
[53:54] when I said that that would be here here
[53:56] speaking of the fourth squirrel so it's
[53:59] got to be and I look down there again
[54:03] and I seen just a little couple little
[54:05] gray hair sticking out from under the
[54:08] leaves I picked it up and there was my
[54:13] squirrel can't find it in the
[54:16] stump it says it's under the bark he
[54:19] says yeah it's under the bark but when
[54:20] he picks up the bark it ain't under the
[54:23] bark it's under the leaves under the
[54:25] bark
[54:30] has God ever told you one thing but not
[54:32] the whole story that's right God wasn't
[54:35] lying it was under the bark yeah
[54:38] right just there were some leaves under
[54:40] the bark that was over the
[54:49] squirrel brother
[54:52] brandom was
[54:54] leaving on his way going
[54:57] going back to the house already made up
[54:59] a story or a plan to get the other
[55:02] brothers bring them to that stump to
[55:04] show them what was in there moving
[55:06] around so that they wouldn't feel that
[55:08] he was lying to
[55:12] them because that's what the brother
[55:14] says if you find the fourth squirrel
[55:16] we'll believe
[55:19] you he's worried about them believing
[55:21] him so much that he's going to go get
[55:24] the brothers bring them back into the
[55:26] Woods show them the stump with the hole
[55:28] in it and show them I think he said it
[55:29] was like a piece of bark or Moss or
[55:31] something in there moving around so this
[55:33] is what I thought the squirrel was I'm
[55:35] sorry you still believe
[55:40] me SS you don't have all of those
[55:43] thoughts if you're completely sold out
[55:44] on your
[55:47] Revelation this is a man being honest
[55:49] with us letting us know how this works
[55:52] and how God trains us yeah right
[55:57] why because without this transparency
[56:00] and without this honesty me and you
[56:02] would never stand a chance we would be
[56:04] so mentally fried every day of our life
[56:07] that we would just go
[56:09] crazy it's only through proper
[56:12] teaching through a proper wave sheath
[56:15] through a proper
[56:16] example that we stand a
[56:19] chance amen
[56:24] remember skipping ahead several
[56:28] years brother brandom's up on top of the
[56:32] mountain and this is 1958 or 59 when
[56:36] this
[56:37] happens we get to I believe 1965 when he
[56:42] has the experience on the
[56:44] mountain very very late in his ministry
[56:46] right before he goes off the
[56:49] scene and there was a certain phrase
[56:52] that God used when he spoke to him
[56:57] we remember the story snow starts
[56:58] falling brother Brandman told everybody
[57:01] get down to the camp as quick as you can
[57:03] if you don't if you stay there on that
[57:06] mountain you're going to get snowed in
[57:07] it's certain
[57:11] death starts snowing brother brandom
[57:14] takes his own advice starts heading off
[57:16] of the mountain and God says
[57:19] what stop and go back
[57:27] stop and go back the first time he told
[57:32] him to do
[57:34] that it was over a
[57:39] squirrel a
[57:41] squirrel listen I like to eat
[57:44] them I love them but it's a squirrel
[57:48] that's right it's not really that big of
[57:51] a deal it's not the end of the world if
[57:54] I don't go back and get the squirrel
[57:57] fast forward a couple years it's certain
[58:01] death right
[58:04] yeah it not just a easy death
[58:09] either a
[58:11] froze to death on top of a mountain in a
[58:15] blizzard
[58:16] slow long
[58:20] miserable
[58:22] painful death
[58:26] if I'm wrong about what this voice is
[58:28] speaking to
[58:33] me started out here squirrel not that
[58:37] really big of a deal but I said stop and
[58:39] go back and get
[58:41] it few years later same same voice is
[58:45] telling me stop and go back into certain
[58:52] death I'll ask you where did he go
[58:56] where did he go where was his faith at
[59:01] then turned around and went right back
[59:04] up onto the mountain into the face of
[59:06] certain death you see the point that
[59:08] God's wanting to get us
[59:13] to yet he slay me yet I'll trust
[59:20] him he's either right or he's not right
[59:24] it's either God in our life or it's not
[59:26] God in our life just because everything
[59:29] goes sideways and I don't understand
[59:31] what's up down or why the difficulties
[59:34] or why it's not running smooth after I
[59:37] know what God has told me about
[59:39] something doesn't change what he's told
[59:42] us about
[59:44] something
[59:45] Faith after
[59:51] Revelation Faith after the
[59:54] Revelation the re Revelation on whatever
[59:58] the situation may be may not be the most
[1:00:01] important thing at
[1:00:03] all it may be a revelation that he gives
[1:00:06] you about something that may be
[1:00:09] Supernatural may come with a super
[1:00:11] anointing that may be an absolute
[1:00:14] blessing for you that you will go and
[1:00:17] testify to everybody at work about not
[1:00:22] knowing that it's simply something he's
[1:00:25] going to use to test your faith
[1:00:27] am he'll give you a revelation give you
[1:00:30] a blessing do something Supernatural to
[1:00:33] use that to increase your
[1:00:41] faith what
[1:00:43] happens when you go to work and you
[1:00:46] testify to somebody about something God
[1:00:48] did for
[1:00:50] you the first
[1:00:53] time God probably vindicates it
[1:00:56] makes you look like a superch
[1:01:00] Christian second time you testify about
[1:01:03] something it goes
[1:01:06] south why tell me
[1:01:11] why CU God's not worried about you
[1:01:13] looking like a superch
[1:01:16] Christian God's worried about your faith
[1:01:19] not worried God's interested about your
[1:01:21] faith more interested about your faith
[1:01:24] than he is about you having having a
[1:01:26] great confession and testimony among
[1:01:28] your co-workers and among your brothers
[1:01:30] and
[1:01:31] sisters that's why he will dump a super
[1:01:34] anointing on you something special major
[1:01:39] blessing and you will write it down and
[1:01:41] turn it in or you'll stand here and tell
[1:01:43] it
[1:01:46] yourself and then after you do that a
[1:01:48] few times you realize you know things
[1:01:50] get really really rough when I open my
[1:01:54] mouth maybe I'll just say thank you
[1:01:59] Jesus I'm not telling
[1:02:02] nobody cuz I don't want Satan to hear he
[1:02:06] might come and test me on what I think I
[1:02:18] believe you know God has a sense of
[1:02:21] humor
[1:02:22] too that's why he'll give people dreams
[1:02:26] or
[1:02:27] visions and after they have their first
[1:02:29] Dream and First Vision how many of them
[1:02:31] you think going keep their mouth
[1:02:33] shut none of
[1:02:35] them you have a supernatural dream
[1:02:38] Supernatural vision for the first time
[1:02:40] you're telling
[1:02:43] everybody what happens after your fifth
[1:02:45] or sixth one brother
[1:02:49] right especially when God starts sharing
[1:02:52] you stuff you don't want to
[1:02:53] see and making you have to go have have
[1:02:56] conversations you don't want to
[1:03:00] have who's proclaiming that from the
[1:03:04] housetops who's praying for more dreams
[1:03:06] and more
[1:03:12] Visions sometimes things come and you
[1:03:14] don't want them to
[1:03:21] come this is super interesting to me
[1:03:26] because brother brandom goes a couple
[1:03:28] years down the road and he finds himself
[1:03:31] in the midst of a vision on a hunting
[1:03:33] trip he's already killed a 42-in caribou
[1:03:35] and he's after a silver tip bear and his
[1:03:38] hunting
[1:03:39] guide is questioning him about
[1:03:43] it where's it going to be at brother
[1:03:45] brandom I can see for nine miles there
[1:03:47] ain't nothing here and you said
[1:03:49] it it's going to be that way thus sayith
[1:03:52] the Lord I don't know where it's going
[1:03:54] to come from God can provide
[1:03:57] are you doubting
[1:03:59] bud that's verb him what he
[1:04:03] said where did that come from who talked
[1:04:07] like
[1:04:10] that I'm venturing to say he learned
[1:04:15] something are you doubting bud but says
[1:04:18] no no I'm not doubting not after what
[1:04:20] I've seen with my brother and the eptic
[1:04:22] fit there no way I can doubt I just I
[1:04:24] don't understand how it could be here
[1:04:27] no sooner than he said that they look
[1:04:29] over and there's the
[1:04:31] bear you tell me which was more
[1:04:33] important the bear or Bud's
[1:04:40] faith I assure you brother brandham did
[1:04:44] not enjoy the schooling process that he
[1:04:47] went through with the
[1:04:49] Lord but in
[1:04:52] it he turns around and starts doing the
[1:04:55] same thing to his
[1:05:02] brother Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:05:05] today and
[1:05:13] forever Church age book what does he
[1:05:15] mean by the word of my patience Hebrews
[1:05:18] 61 13-15 you see the spirit is speaking
[1:05:20] about the word of God which is given to
[1:05:24] us this is the way God teaches his
[1:05:27] people
[1:05:28] patience if he fulfilled his word in
[1:05:30] physical manifestations the very instant
[1:05:32] you prayed you would never learn
[1:05:35] patience but would become even more
[1:05:39] impatient with
[1:05:41] life there it is Abraham was tried after
[1:05:46] he received the Word of Promise most
[1:05:49] think that as soon as we pray in Jesus
[1:05:51] name over the good promise of God that
[1:05:52] there could not be a trial most thank
[1:05:55] that that's what he said most people
[1:05:58] think that most of you all think that
[1:06:02] it's what the prophet said not
[1:06:05] me most of us live our daily lives like
[1:06:09] this and without Revelation we're going
[1:06:12] to keep living our daily lives like that
[1:06:14] but I say we come up a little
[1:06:16] higher I say we not let the prophets
[1:06:19] teaching experiences be in vain I I say
[1:06:21] that we don't let his exhortation and
[1:06:24] his honesty and his trans transparency
[1:06:26] be in vain I say that we grasp it and
[1:06:29] learn something from it and learn that
[1:06:32] things may not be exactly how we think
[1:06:34] we got them figured out all the time and
[1:06:36] how that they should
[1:06:39] work after he received the word of
[1:06:42] promised most think that as soon as we
[1:06:44] pray in Jesus name over the good
[1:06:45] Promises of God that there could not be
[1:06:47] a trial but hear it says the Abraham was
[1:06:49] tried after he received the promise that
[1:06:52] is exactly correct according to the
[1:06:54] psalmist referring to Joseph
[1:06:57] 10519 until the time that his word came
[1:07:00] the word of the Lord tried
[1:07:04] him that was the word of the Lord the
[1:07:07] prophet received out in the middle of
[1:07:08] the woods and what did it do it tried
[1:07:13] him why does the word of the Lord come
[1:07:16] to us to try us it may come with an
[1:07:22] absolute amazing Supernatural experience
[1:07:25] with with us that's not the point the
[1:07:28] point is what is it trying within me
[1:07:32] where is it taking my faith what is the
[1:07:36] purpose of it the purpose of it is not
[1:07:39] the
[1:07:40] experience the sensations or maybe even
[1:07:44] not the
[1:07:46] manifestation the purpose of
[1:07:49] everything that's a big word I'm not
[1:07:51] sure that I want to use it but I feel to
[1:07:53] use it the purpose of everything thing
[1:07:55] in our daily life in our daily walk is
[1:08:00] faith
[1:08:02] faith I feel comfortable in saying that
[1:08:05] because that's what the scripture says
[1:08:06] when the son of man returns will he find
[1:08:08] what name me one other thing he's
[1:08:10] looking for so if there's only one thing
[1:08:13] he's looking for what is everything
[1:08:15] going to be geared
[1:08:20] towards that is exactly correct I'm
[1:08:22] sorry I just read that he will but from
[1:08:24] the time we pray until the time we get
[1:08:27] the answer we must learn to receive
[1:08:30] patience into our souls for only in
[1:08:33] patience do we possess life this is a
[1:08:38] huge profound
[1:08:40] statement only through patience do we
[1:08:45] actually possess life why is that
[1:08:49] because only patience can test our faith
[1:08:55] the
[1:08:56] delay the silence is the only way to
[1:09:01] test whether we have
[1:09:03] faith and if you have faith you possess
[1:09:07] life faith in God that is
[1:09:13] life but the only way to prove that you
[1:09:16] have
[1:09:18] life is to have
[1:09:21] patience
[1:09:23] patience is the testim of your
[1:09:26] faith because if you truly truly truly
[1:09:32] have
[1:09:33] faith the time delay is
[1:09:39] irrelevant the time delay is
[1:09:43] irrelevant because if it's the word of
[1:09:46] God that you have faith in it will come
[1:09:48] to pass and we have faith in that and
[1:09:52] when we express faith in that this is
[1:09:54] what brother random is trying to teach
[1:09:55] us there is no faith involved with God
[1:09:59] told me something I spoke it there it
[1:10:03] is I won't say no faith there's a little
[1:10:05] bit of Faith yes
[1:10:08] sir you understand what I'm saying yeah
[1:10:11] but it's obviously not the faith that
[1:10:14] he's wanting us to come to or he would
[1:10:16] have never invented
[1:10:18] patience he's saying yes that's
[1:10:22] Faith but now have my fa
[1:10:26] faith and my faith God's faith says I
[1:10:31] can tell you
[1:10:33] something and I can
[1:10:36] wait a million
[1:10:39] years and you will not
[1:10:42] waver I can wait however long and you
[1:10:46] will not
[1:10:47] waver I don't want to go into the
[1:10:49] dimensions because brother alexer is the
[1:10:51] expert on that but remember it's only in
[1:10:54] this dimension that there's
[1:10:56] time why is there time so that we can
[1:10:59] express
[1:11:04] patience in eternity we're not going to
[1:11:06] be able to express Faith because there's
[1:11:08] no time and there will be no patience it
[1:11:10] will be
[1:11:12] eternity I don't know how that works it
[1:11:15] just
[1:11:16] does but while we're here the point is
[1:11:22] Faith and faith comes through patience
[1:11:26] and patience is directly tied to time
[1:11:31] and it's time that is always much longer
[1:11:35] than we want it to
[1:11:40] be may God help us to learn this lesson
[1:11:44] even as we know the people of this sixth
[1:11:46] age learned patience we read the history
[1:11:49] of the lives of these great Christians
[1:11:51] what a contrast we see between their
[1:11:53] lives and our lives for they were so
[1:11:56] patient and quiet and
[1:11:59] today we are all but overcome in over
[1:12:04] impatience and
[1:12:06] haste I say
[1:12:09] guilty and I say God help me not to be
[1:12:11] that
[1:12:13] way we're going to go ahead and close
[1:12:16] this but I just want to ask you a couple
[1:12:18] questions
[1:12:25] how many you don't have to raise your
[1:12:27] hand but just think back on your own
[1:12:30] life the first time God supernaturally
[1:12:33] touched you and healed
[1:12:35] you how long was the
[1:12:41] delay I'm going to take a stab and say
[1:12:43] probably not very
[1:12:45] long you probably saw it in the word for
[1:12:47] the first time you prayed about it you
[1:12:51] accepted
[1:12:53] it very very shortly quickly thereafter
[1:12:56] it
[1:12:58] manifested fast forward a couple years
[1:13:00] in your life and your walk with
[1:13:03] God how long is the de the delay on your
[1:13:06] healing
[1:13:08] now I'm not saying it can't be
[1:13:11] instantaneous not saying it can't be
[1:13:13] quick I'm just
[1:13:15] asking
[1:13:17] generally is it slower or quicker than
[1:13:20] it used to be and now I'm going to ask
[1:13:22] you why
[1:13:26] right what he's done with the prophet is
[1:13:29] the same thing he's going to do for us
[1:13:31] what he's done with this manifestation
[1:13:33] of the spoken word is the same thing
[1:13:35] he's going to do in the simplest of
[1:13:37] things in the faith for our healing you
[1:13:39] tell me how much faith is required if
[1:13:42] you know you only have to wait 48 hours
[1:13:43] before it manifests you tell me how much
[1:13:46] faith is required when you don't know
[1:13:48] when it's going to happen
[1:13:54] amen or even if it's going to happen
[1:13:57] right before you die
[1:13:59] right see the difference in the levels
[1:14:03] of
[1:14:07] Faith let me ask you another one don't
[1:14:10] raise your hands on this
[1:14:13] one the first time you was ever
[1:14:15] delivered from a bad habit or a vice in
[1:14:18] your life how quickly did that take
[1:14:22] place and now a few years down the road
[1:14:26] you got something you just can't get
[1:14:30] over can't it's like a squirrel under
[1:14:33] the bark under the leaves I can't find
[1:14:36] it and I'm just going back
[1:14:38] home but he told me I would deliver
[1:14:43] you I know but I can't and it's getting
[1:14:47] dark can't even see can't even see the
[1:14:50] light at the end of the tunnel
[1:14:52] now why was the first time so quick
[1:14:56] and it was something way more difficult
[1:14:58] than this way more complex than
[1:15:04] this why the
[1:15:07] delay this is the 475th time that you've
[1:15:10] delivered me of something why is it
[1:15:12] taking that why is it taking this
[1:15:20] long since we're on the line of
[1:15:22] questions let me ask you another one
[1:15:25] first time God moved in your life you
[1:15:27] really sought God for direction in your
[1:15:30] life I mean just really sold out to him
[1:15:34] and said Lord I've got to know this
[1:15:36] answer not for selfish motives but I'm
[1:15:39] talking really seeking his kingdom
[1:15:42] really seeking his will in your life and
[1:15:45] how quick he answered I'm going to tell
[1:15:47] you my personal testimony it was less
[1:15:49] than 30 minutes and I'm talking a major
[1:15:53] major lifechanging event it made me end
[1:15:56] up in Lime Ohio it was so
[1:16:03] drastic first time I ever completely
[1:16:06] just sold out whatever he wants me to do
[1:16:09] and wherever he wants me to go it was
[1:16:11] less than 30
[1:16:15] minutes why is it six or seven years
[1:16:19] after that there's a trial and a test so
[1:16:24] drastic
[1:16:26] that I'm even questioning that
[1:16:32] experience
[1:16:33] why like it was so profound and it and
[1:16:36] it came so quick why did you wait six or
[1:16:38] seven years and now I'm in the midst of
[1:16:45] this I'm wondering if he was not
[1:16:47] necessarily more interested in what
[1:16:50] happened back then with my faith is what
[1:16:52] he is right now with my faith
[1:16:55] but I ask you that the first time you
[1:16:57] really sold out and sought God about
[1:16:59] something how quick it come and now how
[1:17:01] long are you
[1:17:02] waiting and you are seeking him with the
[1:17:05] same level of sincerity and the same
[1:17:07] level of desperation and you cannot get
[1:17:09] an
[1:17:11] answer why Why didn't it come as easy as
[1:17:14] the first
[1:17:17] time cuz he's not after
[1:17:20] easy he's after
[1:17:23] Faith amen
[1:17:28] I'm going to challenge you you make a
[1:17:29] move for God make a move for
[1:17:35] God maybe a literal
[1:17:39] move to Li
[1:17:44] Ohio God have mercy on your
[1:17:52] soul make a move for God
[1:17:57] amen stand by for a test
[1:18:01] right might be the right move even still
[1:18:05] going to be a test
[1:18:06] involved might be six or seven laders
[1:18:08] down the road still going to be a test
[1:18:11] involved maybe it's just a spiritual
[1:18:14] move come up a little
[1:18:18] higher here's a real double dare come up
[1:18:21] a little higher and testify to a
[1:18:23] coworker or a brother or sister about it
[1:18:28] AM stand by for a
[1:18:34] test say this is pretty
[1:18:40] depressing if you don't know the answer
[1:18:42] it
[1:18:43] is
[1:18:46] right but when you have the answer and
[1:18:48] the proper teaching it should establish
[1:18:51] us and it should accomplish what he's
[1:18:54] after to increase our faith to rid us of
[1:18:57] a fourth dimension element of time right
[1:19:01] and put us right back into the real and
[1:19:04] only true dimension of God said it I
[1:19:07] believe it we're done here yeah
[1:19:12] Faith we're so desperately wanting to
[1:19:16] get into a new heavens and new earth
[1:19:19] we're going to bypass the Millennium
[1:19:21] that still has a time element in it
[1:19:26] we're so desperate to get to a new
[1:19:28] heavens and new earth to get out of this
[1:19:30] time element so we don't have to have
[1:19:31] patience
[1:19:33] anymore but it's not going to work
[1:19:36] Saints as musicians would come it's just
[1:19:39] not going to work our purpose for being
[1:19:45] here our purpose for being here is to
[1:19:49] prove to Satan that we're not like the
[1:19:51] first Eve
[1:19:54] what was the first
[1:19:56] Eve impatient yeah that's right could
[1:20:01] not wait brother brandom
[1:20:03] said did not have
[1:20:06] faith after the Revelation the
[1:20:09] Revelation was multiply and replenish
[1:20:10] the Earth nothing wrong with the
[1:20:12] Revelation praise God hallelujah we're
[1:20:14] going to multiply and replenish the
[1:20:15] Earth wake up the next day uh why aren't
[1:20:18] we multiplying and replenishing the
[1:20:19] Earth what's going on here I want to be
[1:20:20] a mommy why can't I be a mommy everybody
[1:20:22] else is a mommy
[1:20:25] Faith after the
[1:20:35] Revelation first sale brother brandham
[1:20:37] says in Revelation 12:7 Satan the spirit
[1:20:40] the devil which is up there now the
[1:20:42] accuser of the Brethren this is a name
[1:20:44] of the devil accuser a title of the
[1:20:46] devil accuser of our Brethren when the
[1:20:49] church is taken up Satan is cast out
[1:20:53] when the church goes up up Satan comes
[1:21:00] down when the church goes up Satan goes
[1:21:07] down that is an event that will
[1:21:10] happen that can be an event that's
[1:21:13] happening right now
[1:21:14] though when you come up in
[1:21:18] Revelation Satan is cast down I'm going
[1:21:21] to tell you
[1:21:23] why is
[1:21:25] because the accuser of the Brethren is a
[1:21:28] title and the scripture that we read at
[1:21:31] the beginning of the service says that
[1:21:33] there has to be two witnesses in order
[1:21:34] for anything to hold up preferably
[1:21:37] three so when you come up and you do not
[1:21:40] confess doubt when you do not confess
[1:21:43] impatience when you do not confess
[1:21:45] disbelief in God's word the accuser of
[1:21:48] the Brethren is standing there by
[1:21:50] himself trying to accuse the brethren in
[1:21:53] violation of God's law
[1:21:55] yeah because he's standing by himself
[1:21:58] his testimony will not hold up
[1:22:01] right there has to be a second
[1:22:04] testimony that's why I would encourage
[1:22:06] you do not join him in confessing
[1:22:10] impatience do not join him in confessing
[1:22:13] unbelief do not join him in confessing
[1:22:16] frustration right do not let his
[1:22:19] accusation hold weight in the court of
[1:22:22] God's law amen amen he has nobody else
[1:22:27] to help
[1:22:29] him establish his
[1:22:33] testimony it has to come off of your
[1:22:36] lips without it he is kicked out of
[1:22:38] court it will not hold
[1:22:40] water
[1:22:42] right that is an event that will happen
[1:22:45] in the future literally I believe in the
[1:22:47] spiritual realm but that's an event
[1:22:49] that's happening right now in our daily
[1:22:52] lives do not give the accuser of the
[1:22:55] Brethren place in your life Saints you
[1:22:57] have the power to rid him of that
[1:23:01] position
[1:23:03] Amen Let Your confession be yay and
[1:23:07] amen Revelation 12 says and they
[1:23:09] overcome him by the blood of the lamb
[1:23:11] and by the word of their
[1:23:12] testimony and they love their lives not
[1:23:15] to the
[1:23:16] death I've read this differently
[1:23:22] today and they overcome him by the blood
[1:23:24] of the lamb and by the word of their
[1:23:26] testimony I've always read that by the
[1:23:29] word of their testimony being the group
[1:23:32] The Bride
[1:23:33] collectively but I've come to find out
[1:23:35] that's not how God wants me to read it
[1:23:38] God wants me to read it that they by the
[1:23:40] word of their
[1:23:42] testimony their equals me and God amen
[1:23:47] amen right yeah I love you dearly you
[1:23:51] confess whatever you want to confess my
[1:23:53] testimony is is the word of God and by
[1:23:56] the blood of the lamb and by their
[1:24:00] testimony equal sign me and God we will
[1:24:03] overcome if you want to overcome with us
[1:24:07] confess what he says
[1:24:09] amen but I'm no longer going to take a
[1:24:12] group mentality towards that scripture I
[1:24:14] will overcome because I'm not going to
[1:24:17] confess what Satan confesses I'm going
[1:24:19] to confess what God has confessed and
[1:24:22] their testimony mining God's
[1:24:25] testimony will
[1:24:31] overcome there's a semicolon in that
[1:24:33] verse
[1:24:35] though and there's a qualification for
[1:24:38] that they love not their lives unto
[1:24:46] death though he slay me I'm still going
[1:24:49] to trust him that's the only way we're
[1:24:52] going to get anywhere with Christ is
[1:24:54] when we die out to our reasoning when we
[1:24:57] die out to our intellects when we die
[1:24:59] out to what our brothers and sisters
[1:25:01] think about the situation and when we
[1:25:03] stick to God's word that is only when we
[1:25:07] can say I have the same testimony that
[1:25:10] Christ
[1:25:11] has Hebrews
[1:25:14] 11:6 but without faith it is impossible
[1:25:18] to please
[1:25:19] him let's stand
[1:25:22] together without faith
[1:25:24] it is impossible to please
[1:25:28] him how many wants to please God careful
[1:25:36] careful if you want to please God by
[1:25:39] default you are signing up for a delay
[1:25:44] in the promised word taking place in
[1:25:46] your life so that you can express
[1:25:48] patience so that you can express Faith
[1:25:51] which will then please God it's the
[1:25:53] squirrel under the leaves under the
[1:25:56] bark say what go back to the
[1:25:59] beginning and read the
[1:26:01] story it's the squirrel under the leaves
[1:26:04] under the bark he don't tell you about
[1:26:05] the leaves all the time he'll tell you
[1:26:07] it's under the bark you said it would be
[1:26:10] there I said it would be there it's
[1:26:11] going to be
[1:26:12] there what about all the leaves you
[1:26:15] never told me about all the leaves and
[1:26:17] there were just like two
[1:26:18] little hairs sticking out from
[1:26:21] there he don't have to tell you
[1:26:23] everything if he told you everything
[1:26:25] there would be no
[1:26:28] faith Luke 188 I tell you that he will
[1:26:32] avenge them speedily nevertheless when
[1:26:34] the son of man cometh shall he find
[1:26:36] faith on the
[1:26:39] earth I think God's interested in our
[1:26:41] faith that's I think he is focused on
[1:26:43] our faith I
[1:26:45] think I think and I'm not 100% sure but
[1:26:49] I'm pretty sure and I'm getting more
[1:26:52] sure by the day that everything in my
[1:26:55] daily life revolves around me expressing
[1:26:58] more faith in God's
[1:27:04] word in one of these days I'll Express
[1:27:06] so much Faith I'll have the power of the
[1:27:08] spoken word on my
[1:27:11] tongue and when that happens he'll use
[1:27:14] it as a tool to make me Express more
[1:27:17] faith and when I speak it and it doesn't
[1:27:20] immediately come to pass let's get our
[1:27:23] eyes off the man
[1:27:24] stations and let's get our eyes on the
[1:27:27] purpose and the point brother brandom
[1:27:29] did not say that we were placed here to
[1:27:32] not like be the first Eve and have the
[1:27:35] power of the manifestation of the spoken
[1:27:37] word in our tongue he said we were
[1:27:39] placed here to prove to Satan that we're
[1:27:41] not like Eve because we're not going to
[1:27:43] take our own way we'll wait on God we'll
[1:27:46] believe his word and we'll have the
[1:27:47] patience to let him manifest it whenever
[1:27:49] he wants to manifest
[1:27:52] it if that comes with a great
[1:27:54] Supernatural experience praise the God
[1:27:56] praise God I will take all of them that
[1:27:58] he wants to give
[1:27:59] me and yours if you don't want them but
[1:28:03] that's not my focus that's not my
[1:28:06] purpose my
[1:28:09] purpose is to express the utmost faith
[1:28:13] in whatever he's telling me whatever the
[1:28:16] situation whether it's Doctrine or
[1:28:18] whether it's Monday morning amen faith
[1:28:23] in how however he leads me in so much
[1:28:26] that it would get to the point shocker
[1:28:29] that he don't even have to speak to me
[1:28:30] in an audible voice for me to have
[1:28:34] faith may just be a still Small Voice in
[1:28:36] my
[1:28:39] heart Pentecostal is not going to go for
[1:28:42] that not enough manifestation there what
[1:28:45] are you doing today I'm just I'm going
[1:28:48] to I'm going to do what God whispered in
[1:28:51] my heart
[1:28:54] you mean he never even told you you
[1:28:56] didn't
[1:28:57] hear what are we focused on what's more
[1:29:01] important to
[1:29:03] you one last quote and I'm closing on
[1:29:05] promise let the holy spirit this is what
[1:29:08] the prophet's telling
[1:29:09] us this is what he's telling us this is
[1:29:12] his instructions for our life you can go
[1:29:15] and play something softly brother Chad
[1:29:17] if you'll
[1:29:18] come let the Holy Spirit live in the
[1:29:22] church and make way
[1:29:25] that's when you'll have real
[1:29:27] meetings listen to your pastor see if
[1:29:31] the devil see if the devil can't keep
[1:29:33] you from seeing the real thing of God he
[1:29:36] will push you off on the deep end with
[1:29:38] it he'll make you go to a ftic you don't
[1:29:41] have to be fanatical there's too much
[1:29:43] real and genuine to have to be a fanatic
[1:29:45] but listen to your pastor a God sent man
[1:29:48] a teacher that'll send and tell you just
[1:29:51] exactly what to do because himself is
[1:29:54] Anointed with the Holy Ghost and watch
[1:29:55] him he will stay right smack with the
[1:29:57] word you stay right with the
[1:29:59] word and every time you receive the word
[1:30:02] you receive
[1:30:03] life God gave you a checkbook when you
[1:30:07] received the Holy Ghost with Jesus name
[1:30:10] wrote at the bottom of
[1:30:13] it for
[1:30:16] whatsoever you
[1:30:20] desire question are you afraid to fill
[1:30:24] it
[1:30:27] out because if you fill it out you might
[1:30:29] have to manifest
[1:30:32] patience you might have to manifest
[1:30:38] faith I wonder
[1:30:41] saints that if we get so bogged down in
[1:30:43] our
[1:30:47] carnality that we know if we ask for
[1:30:50] something it's going to cost us
[1:30:52] something
[1:30:54] it's going to teach us
[1:30:55] something and we just don't
[1:31:00] ask I
[1:31:05] wonder I
[1:31:08] wonder if we're
[1:31:10] Hesed to really seek God with our whole
[1:31:14] heart because we know what it might cost
[1:31:18] us it's easy to do at the
[1:31:21] beginning it's easy to do I won't say
[1:31:25] easy it's easier to do it's almost like
[1:31:28] you do it without thinking it you're so
[1:31:29] bad off you know you got to have God in
[1:31:31] your life so you just sell out to them
[1:31:33] and after a couple years you realize how
[1:31:35] painful this selling out is and you
[1:31:37] start backing up on that you start
[1:31:39] backing up on that m i maybe I'm okay
[1:31:42] maybe I don't need to come
[1:31:47] higher maybe I won't us to be a little
[1:31:50] bit more like Jesus today
[1:31:53] I wonderful
[1:31:55] hesitant to reach out for his
[1:32:00] fullness because we know it's going to
[1:32:02] cost us patience and an expression of
[1:32:07] Faith he says his name's wrote at the
[1:32:10] bottom of it for whatsoever you desire
[1:32:13] are you afraid to fill it out ask what
[1:32:17] you will in my name God will give it to
[1:32:19] you I like that oh my stand there with
[1:32:22] just unadulterated ated Faith ask and
[1:32:25] believe and it shall come to
[1:32:28] pass that's the way to do
[1:32:33] it he doesn't tell us to back
[1:32:37] up take it
[1:32:39] easy simmer down just a minute stop
[1:32:42] pressing no he says we've got a blank
[1:32:45] check for the word of God in our
[1:32:49] lives fill it
[1:32:52] out fill it out out make the deposit
[1:32:57] it's worth the cost it's worth the
[1:33:02] effects I don't want you to take this as
[1:33:04] a rebuke this evening I'm in the same
[1:33:07] boat you're
[1:33:09] in but I would be
[1:33:13] foolish to try to present to
[1:33:17] you that God operates in our lives
[1:33:24] today the same way that he operated
[1:33:27] yesterday a week ago couple years
[1:33:32] ago he doesn't do it he never did it for
[1:33:34] the prophet that wasn't the example the
[1:33:38] example was I am constantly going to be
[1:33:42] increasing your requirement of faith in
[1:33:46] me but I'm going to encourage you along
[1:33:48] the way I'm going to show you it'll work
[1:33:52] I'm going to give you a powerful
[1:33:53] manifest St I'm going to speak to you
[1:33:55] I'm going to give you
[1:33:57] instructions when you seek me I'm going
[1:33:59] to give you the answer you
[1:34:01] desire but let's be mature let's
[1:34:06] understand that that might come along
[1:34:08] with
[1:34:10] something there might be some
[1:34:13] leaves under the
[1:34:15] bark that's on top of your
[1:34:19] squirrel get back up there and find it
[1:34:22] God bless you this evening brother
[1:34:33] Chad as I look back on this road I've
[1:34:39] traveled I see so many times he's
[1:34:44] carried me
[1:34:47] through and if there's one thing that
[1:34:51] I've learned in my life
[1:34:54] my
[1:34:56] redeemer is faithful and
[1:35:01] true oh my
[1:35:04] redeemer is faithful and
[1:35:09] true
[1:35:11] everything he has said he will
[1:35:17] do every
[1:35:19] morning his mercies are new
[1:35:27] my
[1:35:28] redeemer is
[1:35:33] Fai my
[1:35:36] redeemer is faithful and
[1:35:41] true and
[1:35:43] everything he has said he will
[1:35:49] do every
[1:35:52] morning his mercies are
[1:35:55] [Music]
[1:35:58] you my
[1:36:01] redeemer is
[1:36:06] Fai amen we found him to be faithful and
[1:36:11] true but I want to be faithful to him as
[1:36:14] well I want my faith to grow in a way
[1:36:17] that's pleasing to him and now we learn
[1:36:20] that God is training us teaching us
[1:36:23] growing our faith I marveled sitting in
[1:36:26] my seat how wonderful the word of God is
[1:36:28] and how instructional it is and brother
[1:36:30] B's life teaches us so much I always
[1:36:33] thought it was amazing that God allowed
[1:36:35] a man use the power of the spoken word
[1:36:38] to create a scroll into existence just
[1:36:40] to shoot
[1:36:41] it seconds later and then to eat it I
[1:36:46] thought it seemed odd to me not bad like
[1:36:48] wrong but just odd but I realized it
[1:36:52] wasn't about the squirrels
[1:36:54] it was about the lesson that's what came
[1:36:55] to life to me that God wanted to show
[1:36:59] through this Prophet what it was going
[1:37:00] to be like to have real faith and he was
[1:37:04] honest about it it wasn't his faith it
[1:37:06] wasn't himself as a person that conjured
[1:37:09] this up that had great faith it was
[1:37:11] something God wanted to do through him
[1:37:13] so God took him by the hand and L him
[1:37:15] through it oh God take us by the hand
[1:37:17] and lead us through so that we just do
[1:37:20] what you want train us to have the right
[1:37:23] kind of Faith so that we can serve your
[1:37:25] purpose amen I just read a quote the
[1:37:29] other day uh I think it was yesterday I
[1:37:32] read a quote that tied in with what our
[1:37:34] brother was saying at the end he said
[1:37:37] about the testimony of our our their
[1:37:40] witness brother B said Christ voted for
[1:37:43] me the devil voted against me now it
[1:37:46] depends on which way I cast my
[1:37:50] vote oh God help us to cast our vote
[1:37:53] with god with the word just to believe
[1:37:55] the word despite the obstacles despite
[1:37:57] the personal cost just let's just stay
[1:38:00] with the word amen I appreciated that
[1:38:03] today it was edifying for me I needed it
[1:38:06] I say God I know that you want me to
[1:38:09] grow I want to
[1:38:11] grow sometimes we avoid pain but pain is
[1:38:14] what's causing growth and I don't want
[1:38:16] to avoid pain I don't want pain I I I I
[1:38:19] don't want it but what I want more than
[1:38:22] anything is to be pleasing to to him it
[1:38:24] may require a little bit of confusion or
[1:38:27] uncertainty or patience but I want to be
