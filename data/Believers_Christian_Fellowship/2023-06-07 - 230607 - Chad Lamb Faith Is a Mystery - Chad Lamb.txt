this evening oh Heavenly Father how we desire for you to take control of us Lord God we've had enough life experience to know that we can't do it on our own God we can't in our own strength in our own selves bring glory to you we can in our own strength do anything but God you and us with you and us with you all things are possible would you take control of us this evening Lord would you both speak the word through this flesh and hear Lord through our ears and give us a heart to perceive all that you have for us may you make this word Lord come alive in us and may you bring it to a manifestation in us as we yield to you and surrender for all we believe this is the hour that we have the the right revelation of the hour we live in and what you're trying to accomplish Lord and we want to yield ourselves to that accomplishment that the word may be made manifest in each of us Lord I pray that you take control of this vessel and that you would bring your Eternal Word through these lips of clay Lord give us Grace to hear to understand the faith to believe all that you would speak to us tonight we love you we pray you take preeminence among us as we surrender to you now and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you while we're standing let's turn to Hebrews chapter 11. I want to say I appreciated the special and thank you brother John and sister Jill for sharing that with us amen also I'd like to take a moment to wish my wife a happy anniversary today is our 26th anniversary so June 7th is our anniversary day and we thank God for the grace that he's given to us amen also I want to remind you that I'll be leaving tomorrow I'll be gone this week and I'll be preaching up for the Eugene Bronze in Edmonton and also the brother Nathaniel sius will be here preaching the services Sunday so be praying if you pray for me for traveling mercies I'd appreciate that and for inspiration to preach I appreciate that as well and also be remembering brother Nathanael that God would use him here mightily and let's look at Hebrews chapter 11 together verse 1. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report let's jump over to verse six but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh the God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him may God bless you as you take your seats so these scriptures are familiar to us we know that without faith it is impossible to please God so in order to please God we must have faith but we will also find in our next scripture reading that that faith is not something we just get something we just go and obtain amen so and the ability to please God comes from Faith but faith is a gift from God let's look at this in Ephesians chapter 2. As We Lay Down this Foundation Ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 and we'll read this together Ephesians 2 and 8 says for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast so when we put these two scriptures together we realize that there's no way for me to ever be able to please God without faith and there is no way for me to have faith unless God gives me the gift of faith so I am utterly dependent on God for everything there's nothing that I can do in and of myself and so this evening I'd like to preach on a subject faith is a mystery my faith is a mystery and I pray that God will help me just share this the way that it's in my heart amen and God will unveil it to us in the pergamian church age out of the church age book brother Branham says this and this pergamian age where men where men were humanizing salvation having turned from the truth that salvation is of the Lord having cast aside the doctrine of election and open wide the church door in their Fellowship to any and all who subscribe to their tenants never mind the word in this age of Rapid degradation there were still the few who had the measure of the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ and not only use that faith in Acts of power but withstood those who dared to say that they were saved simply on the grounds of joining a church So it's talking about the humanization of the faith that you have to come and agree with what we say and attend to to where we attend and then you can be saved amen but there were those who would resist that because they had the faith of Jesus Christ because that's what it took he goes on to say they knew that no man could truly believe unto eternal life and the righteousness of God apart from the measure of the faith of the Lord Jesus himself not your faith the faith of Jesus Christ as today's church is filled with mental believers who endorsed the Virgin birth to shed blood going to church taking communion and are not reborn at all even so in the third age was the same problem human Faith wasn't enough then and it is not enough now it takes the very faith of the Son of God to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the Lord Of Glory into the temple not made with hands amen so the mental ascribing to a set of beliefs a Doctrine a set of doctrines Amen in attendance Amen to a church is not enough for salvation Salvation is of the Lord it's going to take a supernatural injection of the faith of the Son of God Amen and and that's what it's going to take to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the Lord Of Glory into the temple not made with hands it's going to take God salvation is of the Lord praise God let's go to Romans chapter 4 together so we find and we're going to find as we talk about this faith is more than just a mental acknowledgment of the truth of scriptures you say I have faith I believe but true faith will believe all the word of God so partial partial belief and partial faith in the word of God that's not the faith that we're looking of that's not the faith of the son of God it's an intellectual faith so in Romans chapter 4 he starts to tell us let's go let's look at verse nine I'm going to look at a couple verses here he says cometh this blessedness upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or an uncircumcision not in circumcision but uncircumcision and he received a sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also so now he's talking about Abraham received the imputation of righteousness because he believed the question is what did Abraham believe Abraham it wasn't that Abraham believed that God created the heavens and earth amen many believe that in that day but Abraham was believing what God told him in that day he was believing the present tense truth and is imputed unto him for righteousness amen so he believed the word for his day and so he became the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of Faith so this promise that he will inherit amen was not just to Abraham and to his seed by the law but through the Rises of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law workers wrath for when the law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all so God Made It by faith how do you acquire this by faith how do you enter in by faith how are you part of the Promise by faith he made it by faith so that it could be by grace so that God by his grace amen and we are saved by grace through faith and not not of ourselves it is the gift of God so it is the faith where we apprehend this Grace which is God's love and favor amen but God to be a righteous God he didn't just come down and he says now you're going to be the one and you're not it you're the one and you're not it no but God comes and puts everybody on the same basis if you can believe me you can be saved but by Grace he has given some amen an ability to believe by a seed of faith [Music] and they are the Seed of Abraham the Royal seed by what by predestination so all Humanity has the same opportunity to believe the word of God Amen and there is a reward even for those who will respect the word of God without ever fighting against it amen but the Seed of Abraham will believe the I am present tense of God and all that he says so now that he made amen he made it by faith so that it could be by Grace so that he could remain a just gone chapter 5 verse 1 says therefore therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith unto this Grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God so it's apprehended by faith and that is not human faith that's not even our faith that's the faith of God the faith of the son of God and the message why are people so tossed about brother says now our faith cannot rest upon nothing a Christian has to have his faith has to have a solid resting place you know that and the only resting place that a Christian a true born-again Christian can rest is Faith or hers is upon the unmovable word of God it isn't built upon the shifting Sands of man's Theology and doctrines and upon some church affiliations but a True Believer his face said solidly unshifting as he approaches the word of God so faith is not just something that we just believe in any old thing amen and I have faith in the faith of God but our faith a Christian faith must have a resting place in that resting place is on the unmovable word of God and and that leads into this next part that I want to share uh let's go to Romans chapter 10 together let's turn over to Romans chapter 10. and read this this is a very interesting part of scripture it just started to uh unlock a little bit in a different way to me today even as I was looking at it Romans chapter 10 verse 16. but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed our report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so now we know this this to be true Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God a Christian's Faith must be placed on a firm foundation and that Firm Foundation is the unmovable word of God so Isaiah said who has believed our report so he's going back to Isaiah and saying who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord uh extended or to who does it shown to and and now he bases it who has believed our report and he says faith cometh by hearing what hearing what the report of the prophet but look at what he does next look at what Paul does next in the scripture Verse 18 but I say have they not heard Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word but haven't they heard wasn't it preached have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the Earth and their words into the into the world but I say did not Israel know didn't they know first Moses saith I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish Nation I will anger you but Isaias is very bold and saith I was found of them that sought me not I Was Made manifest unto them that ask not after me so now he's saying Faith come Isaiah says who hath believed our report so now he takes down and says see Faith cometh by hearing the report of the prophet but he said did they not hear they heard it why didn't they believe amen is not hearing it with these ears amen there has to be another set of ears that are unlocked by God himself to hear the word not sitting in your seat hearing the preaching no matter how right it is it's not these ears didn't the Jews hear didn't they hear the prophecy didn't they hear the preaching didn't they hear Jesus preach didn't they hear what he said amen why didn't they believe amen because it takes something from God let's go to Matthew chapter 13. Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 13. Jesus says therefore speak I to them in Parables because they sing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand so Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God was Jesus not preaching the word Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God if you have ears to hear he says therefore speak I to them in Parables because they see and see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiahs which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are thrilled of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them they sing see not and hearing hear not but blessed are your ears are they here in your eyes for they see I say thank God when I started looking at this and studying this subject I just became happier and happier and more grateful all the time that God has given me ears to hear and eyes to see because without that it is impossible friends in the the future home message brother remember says now you say well look at the priest wasn't he a son of God it proved he wasn't he couldn't recognize what did he say I believe the Bible sure but he couldn't recognize the expressed word of the hour he only had an intellectual learning from some group that he had been back before him and it's the same thing today see I know that's strong but it's the truth there was the word a spoken exactly for that day and he yet he was a scholar yet he was a renowned person but he could not recognize it why no matter how scholarly he was anything like that he still didn't have representation of predestination see only the predestinated will only be the one who does it only can be and you only can do it because look it proves predestination because if you've got eternal life you had to be part of God at all times because he's the only one is eternal he said there's a priest that day in Jesus day wasn't he a Son of God he said he proved he wasn't because if he was he would believe that's what Jesus said in John 6 he said if you're of my father you would believe me but now you don't believe me because you're of your father the devil what was Jesus Jesus was the word made manifest amen and now the priest though he was intellectual the priest though he he he had a belief in the word of God he believed that what went on before him he did not have the true Faith amen that comes from a predestinated seed because if he had he would have believed what was standing before him [Music] let's go to Luke chapter 7. Luke chapter 7. in Luke chapter 7 this is the story of Jesus going to Simon the priest house the Levites house and Simon had invited him and he didn't we know he didn't greet him didn't kiss him didn't anoint him with all didn't wash his feet none of these things and and the the woman of ill Fame she came in and broke the alabaster box and she washed his feet with tears and dried his hair kissed his feet we know all that but then they begin to in their heart be critical of the woman and in verse 44 let's pick it up in 44 and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon he turned to the woman but he's speaking to Simon the Pharisee he says seeth now this woman I entered into thine house thou gave us me no water from my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou does not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace how would she say it wasn't the works The Works were a demonstration of who she believed this was at first it looks like Jesus is rewarding her Works he says you never kissed me she hasn't ceased it because if you didn't wash my feet she washed him with tears and he says your sins are sins which are many are all forgiven amen what was the mechanism amen that declared her righteous that gave her forgiveness of sins it was the fact that she could accept the word for her day amen her he says your faith has saved you amen where did the woman get this ability to believe it wasn't in the school it wasn't in the synagogue it wasn't it was predestinated before the foundation of the world she was a predestinated daughter of God waiting there waiting for something to contact that faith that was laying there and inject Faith so that she could believe and my faith is saved thee go in peace so salvation is of the Lord and it requires the right kind of faith not an intellectual faith not a church Faith but a genuine faith well the man says only the elected who is ordained to see it will see it the rest of them will miss it a million miles when you look at this and I'm gonna I'm going to get into some examples here to show what I'm saying but when we get into this you could you could go two ways depending on I guess your personality or whether or not you have genuine Faith or the grace of God has really become awake in your heart but you can walk away with pride that you can see what others can't see but I don't think that's the reality of faith by grace I think if you walk away with pride that you see what someone else doesn't see then I think you're still stuck in intellectual faith this is my personal belief my personal opinion that how could you come to a revelation of Grace and have pride those two things don't go together I have a revelation of salvation by grace but but I I see and you don't see and I'm this and you're not this and I've got this and you don't have that and this is my position you're nothing my goodness how did you get there amen how was it that Simon would not believe and accept Jesus Christ but this little ill-famed woman could do it it wasn't her Merit ability intellect training teaching it was an absolute gift of God and that gift of God as it went into an expression because it was beating from within her amen caused Jesus Christ to say to her thy sins are forgiven amen it equated to her salvation not her works not her intellect but her faith being expressed in the word for her day and by what Merit none I love the contrast in the Bible amen God has written his Bible in such a way amen he condenses his truths and he wants us to see things and he puts things together amen so this whole scene plays out in a righteous man's house and a Pharisees house amen I mean one that held in good reputation with good training good understanding good intelligence good Bible training good works good alms Deeds good all of this Amen in contrast he'll bring a woman amen who is the opposite of this amen God doesn't do these things by accident this is all intentional amen and the contrast tells the story amen she a Simon is the best of the best she's the worst of the worst Simon's held into respect she's held in disrespect Simon is religious she nobody even pays attention to this woman and whether or not she's religious or saved or anything amen but one of them has representation of predestination and the other one doesn't and it goes to show that it has not the Merit the intelligence the training none of that will work amen it'll take something Supernatural manifesting through a child of God that goes beyond anything that they could think our work up to let's go to John chapter 12. John chapter 12. we'll look at verse 37. John chapter 12 37 but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believe not on him did he preach the word yes did they believe no did he do the sign of the Messiah yes did they believe no did he do remember you see no matter how good we preach it and no matter how many signs follow us only those that are predestinated to believe will believe but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believe not on him that the saying of Isaiah is the prophet might be fulfilled which spake Lord who hath believed or important to whom at the arm of the Lord been revealed therefore they could not believe because that Isaiah said again he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and I should heal them so if you see with your eyes and hear with your heart you'll believe and if you believe you'll be converted what does it take to be converted to have eyes to see ears to hear and a heart to perceive how do you get that by the grace of God when we look in Revelations chapter two we don't have to turn there but Revelation Chapter 2 and chapter 3 begins to express the church ages and there's a phrase that's used seven times seven times seven Church edges this phrase is used seven times and the phrase is he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith into the churches how did they get an ear to hear amen how did they get an ear to hear what the spirit was saying to the churches and through every Church seven times he says let him that hath an ear to hear hear what the spirit say to the churches that means in every Church age there would be some who had an ear to hear and there'll be some who didn't have an ear to hear amen but I thank God if he may if he gave you a hearing ear to hear the truth of the word and a heart to believe it amen that's absolutely the grace of God brother Benham says in the message shalom he said God has moved through history with the rhythm of the promise of his word in each age and the same Rhythm making his word you know in Shalom brother starts talking about this great Symphony and the great conductor who's and everybody who's playing their part and he's saying God has moved through history with the rhythm of the promise of of his word in each age in the same Rhythm making his word that's how God moved down through history from all the way from Genesis to Revelation he has moved through history with his word that's right with the rhythm of the power of the Holy Spirit vindicating his word to the elected remember he's never been able to touch the outside church it's only the elected though the symphony is played out by the elected a little further in the same message he said when the real word of God falls upon the Vindicated upon the seed and they see that Vindication of the word they recognize it they're looking at the word they know the junction they know the time they know the change they know the beat that's supposed to be in that hour Hallelujah they know the beat they know the time they know how it's supposed to go see only the elected knows it I love this I love when he says this because when brother Benham says this he puts me in a quandary the moment he makes this statement all of a sudden my head is spinning because brother Branham makes the statement I I want to read it again I want you to think like think think I don't know how I want you to think but I want you to see what I'm thinking he said when the real word of God falls upon the Vindicated upon the seed they see the Vindication of the word they recognize it they're looking at the word they know the junction they know the time they know the change they know the beat that's supposed to be in that hour Hallelujah they know the beat they know the time they know how it's supposed to go see only the elected knows it and and it's almost like brother Benham saying they know they know that it's time for a junction they know that something has to happen and they're watching for it to happen the problem is the elected never knew what was happening until it happened something inside of them knew amen something not here new amen I asked you before you came to the message were you looking for a junction were you looking for a change in the beat the change in the symphony for the end time seal to be open no but you were elected but you didn't know it was coming amen all of a sudden God did something and awakened something and the part of you that knows there's a time for a junction that something has to change is not this part it's not the outer Man part but the inner man was watching for something the inner man was watching for the change of the beat the inner man was watching not your intellect your intellect didn't know anything amen this message come and it ruined my intellect destroyed my religion so it's not as if the elector's sitting around saying something's got to happen there's something out there I feel it no God come and took your breath away surprise you shocked you astonished you but something inside of you says that's nothing but the truth it is the time for this this is the time for the junction there has to be a changing be it is the end time this is the end time sign and then he makes this statement they know it's supposed to how they know how it's supposed to go listen I'm telling you in my intellect I didn't know how it was supposed to go I didn't I was reading the sheet music and I had no idea how to play it for the end time but there was something laying dormant inside that knew how to play from the sheet music that knew how to play my part it was just laying there waiting for an expression waiting amen until got called upon amen then it knew what to do then the next statement he makes he said when Philip saw it he couldn't stand it any longer he knew that was the Messiah Philip didn't know before Philip knew when he saw the expression something inside of Philip recognized that this is true I'm feeling solid you couldn't stand any longer he knew that was Messiah so he went to a fellow that he had a Bible study together he said Nathaniel he said come see a man come see what we found we have found Jesus of Nazareth we have found Jesus of Nazareth that's the prophet that Moses spoke of that would come we have found him we've found him so now Philip is awake to the sheet music Philip knows this is it so Philip comes to Nathanael nathanael's another elect seed and he begins to tell Nathanael hey guess what this is what Moses talked about this is the Messiah and Nathanael says I don't think so can anything good from that Nathaniel's not he doesn't already know friends Nathanael in his flesh he's doubting he doesn't believe Philip's report and Philip says just come and see and when he comes in contact with Jesus Jesus works the sign of the Messiah on him and he says amen Thou Art God Amen thou Thou Art the Messiah what was it he didn't know here amen something inside he had to come in contact with Jesus Christ and when he came in contact with the Living God it awakened that part that understood the time understood the sheet music Hallelujah so there was a part of me and a part of you that was laying there dormant that that was waiting for an expression but everywhere we went to church and everything we did and all of our efforts they amounted to absolutely nothing but at some given time some appointed time amen God made sure that he came our way and he made sure that he contacted us to awaken the part inside of us that would recognize him in the hour that he's in that wasn't us doing anything it was him doing it let's go to Genesis 15. I touched on this Sunday and I just I can't shake it the story of Sarah and God has really drawn my attention back to it and I want to explore some of this with you I'm gonna follow the life of Abraham just for a few scriptures in Genesis 15 verse 2 he says in Abraham said Lord God what will thou give me sing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus and Abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not thine this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bow shall be thine Heir and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto them so shall thy seed be so now Abraham Abram at this point receives a promise of a son that will come forth from his bounds so let's go to Genesis 16 verse 1. it says now Sarai Abram's wife bear him no children and she had a handmaid an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarah said unto Abram behold now the Lord hath restrained me from bearing I pray they go into my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her and Abram hearkened through the voice of Sarai so first we start with the promised word and and I just if you can just bear with me for a minute while I express what's in my heart Sarah knew the promise that was given to Abraham so she knew the word for her day is that right so Abraham had received the promise she was part of Abraham amen the problem is she had doubts she did not believe she was part of that promise is that right because had she believed she was part of the promise she wouldn't have looked for someone else to fulfill the role so now here is Sarah expressing doubt expressing unbelief but guess what I believe she's a predestinated seed of God I believe the promise she's included in the promise because she's included in Abraham but yet she's confused in her own mind and doubting in her own mind amen and so Sarah here is doubting and disbelieving her part of the promise not that she's disbelieving the promise she's disbelieving herself as part of the promise praise God let's go to Genesis 17. Genesis 17 15 God and God said unto Abraham ask for Sarah thy wife Thou shalt not call her Sarai but Sarah shall be her name shall her name be and I will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her then Abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall Sarah that is 90 years old bear and Abraham said unto God oh that Ishmael might live before thee and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him and as for Ishmael I have heard thee behold I have blessed him and I will make him fruitful and I will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he begin and and I will make him a great nation but my Covenant will I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time the next year so God comes to Abraham and he gives him a further revelation of the promise and that further Revelation is a name change but also that Sarah shall bear the son and he States it three times three times Sarah shall bear a son Sarah shall bear a son Sarah shall bear a son but let's go over to Genesis 18. verse 9. he says then they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent he said I will certainly return unto you according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard in the tent which was behind him and Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure in my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of Surety bear a child which a mole is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh here we find that Sarah a predestinated child of God she is doubting the promise of God is that what you see I hope I'm not the only one she she the promise was in a name change there was a name change and in the name change of God also made the a further Revelation that Sarah shall bow to Bear a son and thou shall call his name Isaac and the promise shall be with Isaac whom Sarah shall bear it was very specific amen but Sarah amen is looking at herself and looking at her age and looking at the circumstances and she can't believe the word and when God comes down in flesh and he begins Amen to confirm the promise Amen in in this this man's already Discerning because he already knows the new name he knows it's Abraham and he knows it's Sarah showing that it's Elohim it's Jehovah God Amen and now he begins to say at this appointed time amen Sarah shall bear a son and she begins to doubt it and begins to laugh amen and and God calls her out on it you say oh my goodness Sarah get a hold of yourself let's go to Genesis 21. this is what we were speaking of on Sunday Genesis 21 and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him I think this is an amazing scripture because we find in Genesis 18 that she's doubting when God comes in flesh and shows the sign of the Messiah she's doubting but in Genesis 21 there's a private visitation where the Lord himself visits Sarah and Sarah conceives and the question is what happened in this visitation it doesn't tell you but if we go back to the book of Hebrews back to the book of Hebrews let's go there together Hebrews 11 and 11. Hebrews 11 11 through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed it was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised oh praise be to God I love the way the Bible is written and Genesis 18 she doubt it in Genesis 18 she questions in Genesis 18 she laughs amen and God calls her out on it and she even denies it to God's face because she's afraid here she's expressing doubt here she's expressing unbelief amen but a little bit later God does something Sarah could not do for herself God comes and he visits Sarah and a private meeting with just Him and Sarah he visits Sarah at the appointed time and what happens by faith she receives strength to conceive where did she get the faith when she met God herself she received the faith amen awaken the faith that was in her before it was intellectual intellectual intellectual intellectual it was a promise for Abraham then she wasn't part of it now he comes and says you're part of it she still doubts that she part of it because she's not capable why doesn't God cast her way brother van said he couldn't kill her then because he couldn't hurt her without hurting Abraham she was part of Abraham she was part of the promise amen God can't destroy her for her unbelief for her stupidity for her lying he can't destroy her because she's part of Abraham she's part of the promise and because she's part of the promise and struggling to believe God has to do something to Quicken her faith and God himself comes to her in Genesis 21. and what is the result by faith she receives strength to conceive sin by faith it wasn't just something God just came and did God did something to get to Quicken her faith so she could believe the promise and by faith she receives strength to conceive brother Benham he comes to this and he says God could not destroy Sarah without hurting Abraham he said and neither can God destroy us for our stupidity because we're part of Jesus Christ and part of the word and part of the promise so what does God have to do God Amen because we're predestinated like Sarah was predestinated amen she disbelieves she doubted she questioned she laughed at she lied to God she had all these things that would put her out of the promise the problem is she was in the back part of God's mind part of that promise before the foundation of the world so God himself would step on the scene and unlock a faith that's trapped deep inside of her heart what did Sarah do that was worth anything what did Sarah do that she could be proud about it was all God Sarah's testimony wasn't so nice until God injected himself on the scene I'm telling you my testimony wasn't so nice until God revealed himself to me personally God would have what were we doing how were we living what were how many times did we doubt how many times did we question how many times did we doubt the very word of God how many times did we question the word of God how many times how many statements that we would love to take back how many statements of disbelief how many statements of I could never be one of them or it's for somebody else it's not for me how many times did people make foolish statements that should put them out of the promise the problem is they're part of Christ they're part of the word they can never be out of the promise and because of that God's going to have to come down it looks like they don't believe it looks like they can't believe this is why we should never lose faith in our children never lose faith in those that have walked away it doesn't matter what they say if they're part of the promise amen God will inject himself in their life somewhere and unlock the faith that's buried down inside they may have said foolish things Sarah did they may have acted in disbelief Sarah did amen but she was part of the promise all along amen many of us would write off many people because of things they say or things that they do I'm telling you the story's not over till the story's over this old scene with Sarah receiving strength to conceive has blessed me so much because I realized in order for me to conceive on this word God had to come to me it took something more than just hearing words amen it took something more amen than just knowing that there was a promise and knowing that there was a bride I could believe there was a pride I could believe this was the day when Jesus Christ amen when the son of man had returned to Earth I could believe all of that and believe he was calling out a bride and believe and believe and believe Sarah could believe that to be a son born of Abraham she could believe but she had to recognize that she was part of that plan and part of that promise and she in her flesh did not have the capacity to believe that so God would do something Supernatural in her life to give her the faith to conceive to have strength to conceive seed by faith I'm so glad that God knows where we're at and this is why faith is a mystery this is why I said faith is a mystery it wasn't that Sarah was a a super super in faith but God came to her to unlock a faith that was hidden there to give her faith to conceive to have strength to conceive seed brother man in the Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says what is the new birth then you say well brother Branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you this is listen this is so far beyond saying that I believe there's a bride I believe brother Branham was Malachi 4 Revelation 10 7 the seventh angel I believe he's come to call out a bride it was a son of man revealing the son of man and the Bride of crisis on the earth and and and what is the bride doing she's manifesting the son of man again that's wonderful but where do you fit into that plan where do you and I fit into that plan and we can have intellectual repeat but it's got to be more than an intellectual repeat there's got to be a genuine faith that goes beyond amen uh beyond all of the outside man it comes and wakes up the one who knows the part that needs to be played praise God what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you joined a church you shook a hand you've done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he's the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon we all know because we preached it before a few on a few occasions but Sarah after this encounter in Genesis 21 she has Faith Now by faith she receive strength to conceive seed she brings forth the promised son but now she understands the promise now there's no more doubt now there's no more questions now she knows where she fits what the word for her day is amen who this is that she brought forth she has an understanding of the full promise she hasn't just heard it she knows it she's part of it and now amen when the son of the Bond woman begins to mock the son amen her son amen now Sarah with the revelation of the word it's unlocked by faith she says cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the bomb woman shall not be Heir with my son what's she doing she knows this promise now she understands there's no question in her mind there's no doubt in her mind now she's standing upon the promise and now Paul picks up what Sarah says later in the book of Galatians it says doth not scripture say cast out the bombing what scripture the scripture where Sarah said why because something happened in Sarah to where she caught the revelation of the hour and now what she's speaking is the word of the Lord amen it's the revelation of the of the prophecy now fulfilled and she's speaking what's right Abraham himself now has a question because of his own emotion what do I do with this son and what about Sarah and God himself says hearken to the voice of thy wife for what she says is Right amen what did it teaching being in the right home no Supernatural encounter where the Lord visited Sarah I say friends we need a supernatural visitation from God to unlock Faith amen we need an injection of the faith of the Son of God himself Amen to unlock what's laying there are training our education our years experience it's not going to work amen our ability to read our ability to play a tape that's not going to work it's going to take something from God and if God unlocks that Faith inside of us then what do we have to be proud about we should be the most grateful people hey that have ever walked the face of the Earth because I have eyes to see and I didn't give them to myself I have ears to hear and I was deaf and I was mutant I was blind until he came to me and when he came to me he opened my spiritual eyes he opened my understanding he opened my ears I didn't open them myself I didn't grab a church age book and said I'll study this and figure it out I did there was no study and figure out anything it was God who turned the key of Revelation so we should be super grateful but also very compassionate super grateful but very compassionate because where would I be if he hadn't unlocked Faith inside of me where would I be and what would I be saying and what would I be doing it was the grace of God and the message I have heard but now I see he says no matter how religious you are how many churches you belong to how many books your name's on if that genuine Holy Ghost is in you which is this word manifested you'll see the message and the hour because it's the holy ghost that does it but there has to be something like that off inspiration strike you if you pour water on the ground and on the ground on the ground and there's no seed in there to strike it how could it ever bring forth anything there's nothing there to bring forth that is that only the elected of God will see it the elected of God seen it in Noah's time Moses time Jesus time the apostles time Luther's time Wesley's time Pentecost time because that was the seed that was on the earth when this inspiration was poured out now while The Inspirations poured out to gather the bride together it's only those who are elected will see it Jesus said I thank thee father that thou has hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed it to babes such as would learn now inspiration has to strike it so you have to have two things there has to be a seed of predestination on the inside there has to be a predestinated seed there to receive it but there has to be inspiration that strikes it it takes God coming down and injecting himself it takes a Genesis 21 experience and that inspiration can pour out and pour out and there's no seed there there's no life but if the seed lays there no inspiration strikes it it doesn't come to manifestation so what could you do without God anyways and where did you get the seed and how did it come awake inspiration Struck it by the grace of God let's go to mark 16. I just want to look at just two more places here and to see this principle mark 16. and nine Mark 16 and 9. now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen after her believed not pay close attention to this who are these These are his disciples these are the eleven are they predestinated seed of God yes let's read it again verse 11 when they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not they were disbelieving the manifestation of their hour after that after they disbelieved after that he appeared in another form and the two of them as they walked and went in the country and they went and told it unto the residue neither believe they them so we have the mouth of two witnesses and they're not believing so what does God do with his predestinated seed who's not believing does he cast them away does he does he chasten them and say you're no longer part of me you get away from me no he can't cast him away no matter what their stupidity or unbelief is because they were part of him before the foundation of the world their names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life he can't cast them away brother bam said he would he would get rid of us for our stupidity yes I've had some stupidity but he can't get rid of me amen he can't cast me away because he chose me for the foundation of the world so here it's too the the first group comes back with a testimony he's alive they believe it not the two on the road to mass come back with the testimony he's alive they believe it not in verse 14. afterward he appeared unto the eleven now he came to them himself I'm telling you it's good to be elect it's good to be a lactate amen it's good to be part of the program because no matter what you said when you first heard the message or what foolish statement you made or how you didn't believe this crazy thing your neighbor or your friend or your co-worker or somebody else taught you amen but down inside of you was a predestinated seed Gene of God that he wasn't going to lose amen so somewhere along the line if you didn't believe this testimony and did believe that testimony somewhere along the line he would come to you after Rudy appeared unto the 11 as they sat at me and unbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of harm because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen he embraded them he rebuked him he corrected them and then what did he do he said go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature you're still mine and I still got a job for you to do you're still part of the program you're still part of the promise you're still my seed you're still the manifestation of the hour it caused me to come to you myself praise God Almighty it's good to be elect's friends I mean we've done all the foolishness thing the world has done we've done all the foolish things the denominations have done the difference is predestination the difference is election and that election didn't allow him to throw us away that election wouldn't allow him to to go seek another that election would bring him to us in a personal revelation of Jesus Christ himself revealed personally amen amen and then he would commission us go ahead and read your part of the sheet music and play it now and then something in you at this meeting with Jesus Christ would know the junction would know the time would be looking for it your brain could have been confused but something inside would recognize when he comes to us let's go to Acts 26. Acts chapter 26. verse 12. this is the Apostle Paul giving a testimony before Agrippa so whereupon I was as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priest at midday a king O King I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining around about me and them which journeyed with me and when we were all Fallen to the earth I heard a voice speaking into me and saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and I said who art thou Lord and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest what was Saul doing he was persecuting the Christians he was hauling them into prison he was having them beaten some were even killed he was there consenting at the death of Stephen all of these things he was doing what was he doing he was fighting the word he was fighting the message of the hour he says he this is Apostle Paul he said I blasphemed but I did it ignorantly but Paul says here he is killing the Christians hauling them to prison persecuting trying to shut down this roof he's fighting against the truth and Jesus say why are you persecuting me and all of this persecution you know what Jesus didn't come down to exhort his wrath upon this man who was doing all this work he didn't come down to Stone him to kill him amen he didn't come down to murder him he came down to do what he came down to wake up the seed that was laying dormant inside a Saul why because he was a chosen vessel unto the Lord amen all of the evil that he was doing all the unbelief that he was expressing all the wrong Deeds that he was committing couldn't cause God to cast him away because he was a predestinated seed what would it do it would bring him down on the scene it would cause him to introduce himself to Paul so Paul would know Paul this is me this is who you really are you're going the wrong way oh praise God it's good to be elect this is why Paul couldn't be puffed up this is why he couldn't he couldn't exalt himself he was going the wrong way multiple times in the gospels he expresses regret for his earlier life he said he wasn't even worthy to be an apostle because he persecuted the church Paul lived with regret for what he did but it didn't change who he was and it never caused God to turn his back on who he was he was always ordained to be a Son of God and always called to be the first church age messenger what would his stupidity what would his unbelief what would his Rebellion against the word do it would cause God to come down to Saul himself [Music] oh I thank God I thank God I was I was steeped in religion stuck in my father's in my grandfather's religion believing it was the only way living a compromised half-baked half-christian nominal life hmm when I first heard the truth I thought it was a cult I received books and tapes for one reason only and that was to that was so I could read them to prove that it was a cult but oh I thank God he didn't cast me away because of my stupidity and because of my expression of unbelief because of my ignorance what he did is he came down and he revealed himself to me personally amen what is the new birth is Jesus Christ revealed to you personally and what did it do it unlocked a Faith in Me That Couldn't Express before it unlocked something in me where there was disbelief now there was Faith where there was questions now there was answers where where there was doubts now there was an absolute belief and a willingness to sell out where I once held it at arm's League now I embrace it with all that's in me what did that he did that amen he did that by unlocking something the inspiration struck water hit the seed and I couldn't do it on my own and I couldn't do it with no seat it was all because of God [Music] that's why this faith is a mystery it wasn't the good priest it was the Harlot who had faith it wasn't the multitudes in Jerusalem who were coming to the feasts and sacrificing the animals it was the Samaritan woman who had too many husbands his faith is a mystery and god holds the mystery oh I thank God brother Branham says and the message works is Faith expressed so now Faith is a revelation from God now Faith is a revelation there's where I want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up to Faith you never have faith it's give to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation you cannot work yourself up to Faith God has to Grant it further down in the same message he says now the Roman Catholic Church says he was speaking to Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church the Protestants say he was building it upon himself now they could be right but to me both of them is wrong it was upon the spiritual revelation of who he was flesh and blood has not revealed this to you Peter but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and Upon This Rock the revelation of who he is upon the Revelation he is the word Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it show that the gates of hell would be against it what against the revelation of Jesus Christ in your day that's what the hell the gates of hell are against amen but what will the Gates of Hell beat not be able to derail against the Revelation that comes from the father Revelation from the father not Revelation from your mind Revelation from the father the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against that he goes on to say Abel by faith revelation by by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that which came which God testified he was righteous how by faith how by Revelation by Revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice because it was revealed to him that it wasn't fruits of the field it was blood that's why some people can believe it and some can't believe it some tried to make believe it in an audience of people where I pray a prayer line comes through you'll find and they were all good people will say there's some that's trying hard to believe it trying to work themselves into it some just can't do it at all others it's just by Grace it's just given to them now there's the difference see that that does it that's the real Revelation because faith is a revelation from God it must be revealed first Jesus clearly expressed this when he said no man can come to me except my father draws him first or reveals me to him first I remember saying even in the prayer line some are trying to believe some is trying hard to believe trying to work themselves into it some can't do it at all and others it's just by Grace they just believe see that's the real faith that trying and pressing and trying to grab a hold and make something happen and trying to be bold and trying to be no it's just natural it's just the faith of God that God injects it's a gift of faith that just says it's the truth it's nothing but the truth and it's for me and it's for now and this is the time it's not something you can work in work out pump up pull down it's given by grace that's why we just go to God and say God give me more of your faith Lord just let me grow in faith and the knowledge of the Lord God help me I need more of you I don't need more pretending I don't need more theatrics I don't need more I don't need more words I don't need to impress anybody else by my firm statements what I need is I need God to grant me the gift of faith I need God to water the seed that's in Me by his word and let the faith in me grow amen and take full control I need Grace in my life and it's amazing when we talk about Grace Grace I I think brother bear said Grace unto disgrace so much grace preaching as if as if Grace is a teaching where God overlooks all your sin and it covers for all your failure and never requires anything else because he's done it all for you that's not the teaching of Grace amen Grace is God by Grace giving you Faith to believe and by faith you're declared righteous not The Graces so you can live any way you want to live and you just say well he died on the cross for all my sins that's true but how do you know it's true you only know it's true if it's been unlocked by a seed of faith in your heart it's true for you it may be true but is it true for you it's Grace that gives us the faith to believe and it's we're saved by grace through faith and not not of ourselves it's the gift of God and we're justified by faith and the little Harlot woman who washed Jesus foot feet her all her sins were forgiven she was saved by what by faith how did you have faith by grace Grace gives me the faith to believe in the faith that declares me Justified with imputed righteousness and then my true genuine faith in God in his word causes me now to act out what I believe which is obedience to the word it's God's grace friends it's not just a all that's all covered no that's not the right kind of faith yet you can do whatever you want but preach great that's not that's not the right kind of faith yet the right kind of faith is recognize the word for our day and our place in the word once Sarah saw who she was and that the promise was her and there was nobody else and she was the one she had faith by faith she had strength to conceived before that no conception no conception no conception when she was young and strong and healthy and a virgin married to her husband and lived with her husband all those years no conception no conception no conception then she got too old and there was a promise and she doubted her part of the promise and tried to bring Hagar into the equation and then even when God confirmed the promise she still laughed because she saw it as impossible but when God came to her amen and gave her faith then when she saw herself as the pro as part of the promise she saw who she was she saw her part in it all then she had strength to conceive seed how by faith how are we going to how are we going to manifest The Life of Christ by faith how are we going to have strength Amen to produce the son of man again by faith how are we going to have faith by grace and if we're missing it he'll come to us why because he doesn't have a plan B he doesn't have a backup amen when Moses had run away from Egypt on the backside of Desert god went to Moses because Moses was the predestinated one he didn't have a plan B when Saul was persecuting the Christians denying the word and doubting and cursing amen he had to come to Saul because he didn't have a plan B and even when I doubted and even when I questioned he came to me because he didn't have a plan B for me and he didn't have a plan B for Sarah amen it was Sarah it had to be Sarah so he had to visit Sarah I'm so glad that there's a Grace that had to lock faith for me because I was part of the plan by grace faith is a mystery you can't give it to somebody else you say faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word but billions have heard the word and don't have faith amen the word is what faith is based on the word comes and unlocks Faith but you must have a seed on the inside to begin with many have heard the end time message and walked away but I can't walk away why because of Grace not into like Grace not effort not willpower Grace I can't walk away because he's already unlocked the mystery to me and he's already showed me this is you when he says bride he means you when the Bible says he'll have a bride with us about a wrinkle that's you and I just say Lord be it unto me according to your word I believe it now let me walk in it Lord praise God let's go to Mark chapter nine I want to lay this scripture in before we close I love this Mark chapter 9 verse 23. Mark 9 and 23 Jesus said unto him if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth he's speaking to a man who has a child who's suffering from a devil that's taking him and throwing him into the epileptic seizures she says Thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth and straightway the Father the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou my unbelief oh I thank God that I believe but oh God help me in those areas of unbelief those Mysteries those things I don't understand in my current stupidity Forgive Me Lord forgive me Lord that when I say the wrong thing when I express the wrong words when I react the wrong way forgive me Lord I believe help thou mind unbelieve if you don't help me there's no help for me if you don't by your grace unlock faith in me and you don't help Faith grow in me and you don't give me a greater Revelation I'll never get it but oh God I believe help me Lord to believe more help me to believe it all I would like to end with this quote out of Crisis the mystery of God revealed that that's what God Christ is doing to the church see he is letting her know the secrets just the secrets not these flirters I mean his wife see all right now look no by having the revelation of a secret made known to them by his grace amen are you a recipient of his grace how how do you know because he's not letting anybody know the secrets of his heart he's not giving these to the flirters he's not giving this to the denominations amen it's by grace by Grace he's letting the secrets the revelation of his secret made known to them by his grace if God has revealed to you the secret what was a mystery is a secret to the bride what is a mystery to the world is a secret to the bride what was a great mystery in the back of God's mind is now a secret he's whispering to his bride but how's he doing it by grace and if he's Whispering the secret to you then you're a recipient of his grace and it should give you strength to conceive on this promise in this hour to manifest the promised son how's it going to come when he comes to you and I amen and reveals to us who we are and unlocks of faith that we couldn't have any other way by Grace he has unlocked Faith to us and I say God I believe help me to believe more help me God help me to get past my own thinking get out past my own fears get past God keep coming to me and Whispering Your Love secrets to me by your grace to give me a greater Revelation so that I can live a greater manifestation it's all going to come by your great grace let's all Stand Together musicians if you come Blake if you please come amen let's just bow our heads together and pray oh Heavenly Father we thank you Lord God when we see what you've done for your children in the Bible Lord we see him going the wrong direction we see him going in ways that look like they're running away from your word it looked like Moses were running away from the promise that was in his life but God you knew where to find him and you knew the time to find him in God when you begin to speak to him he expressed unbelief when you begin to tell him it was time to go back and deliver he resisted you Lord he he denied his place he he didn't believe that he could he thought he was unfit so much so that you were angered but oh God you never gave up on him and you never changed your mind when Saul was going wrong you went to him when Sarah couldn't believe you came to her when the disciples were disbelieving the reports of their friends you came to them and God when we were stuck in our unbelief in our confusion you came to us oh God we're so thankful and God if you can do it for us you can do it for our loved ones you can do it for those who have walked away you can do it for those who are in confusion to those amen no matter what they've done no matter what they've said Lord if they're part of your plan you'll go get them Lord we're asking God that you would go inject yourself go stand on their way don't let them go any farther but Lord make yourself so real to them that you awaken the seed inside of him I'm going I pray that you keep by your grace revealing yourself to us God we admit there's still so much foolishness in our lives so much stupidity so much of the outer outer man the flesh around but oh God keep coming and whispering in our ear give us the revelation of this word Lord let us have strength to conceive to bear this life within us and to manifest it through us for God it's all by your grace this faith that is required you have given it by your grace I'm so thankful Lord I'm so grateful Lord and I want what you've done for me I want you to do it for others I want to see others Lord we want it so bad for them but we can't give it to him we're asking that you would do what we can't do would you meet your people Lord and unlock the faith in their hearts help them to see with eyes and hear with the right ears they might recognize Lord what Generations before have longed to see the opening of the seals the revealing of the great mystery of God for prophets and wise men and church age messengers of all they have longed to see this day but yet by your grace we have eyes to see and ears to hear oh God we're a happy people we're a grateful people we're thankful Lord God that you by your grace have given us eyes to see and ears to hear we love you Lord take full control of our lives and live through us now I pray God you would bless us as we go from here let us walk in this truth that you've revealed to us and may it become evident and alive and may we take on the reality of this as Sarah did who begin to speak your very word and begin to understand the conflict Lord and she could place your word right on the situation Lord may we walk like that knowing this truth and knowing what will and won't work in this day we love you God we ask for your blessings bless your people as we go in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] one by me take the word of God what you see what you believe is what will be set your wings to The Winds of faith do not struggle it's fighting [Music] okay what's your name what's your cry was your mountains [Music] speak the word of God and my advice or you will fly set your wings to The Winds of faith you can fly in a higher place do not know [Music] it's by grace [Music] Watch the Bride Watch the Bride in this in time she does not struggles she does not strive [Music] [Music] down inside you can fly in a higher Place do not struggle it's my grace [Music] amen I was just thinking there's so many times that we've tried and tried to believe there's times when we needed healing we needed a deliverance we needed something and we tried and tried and tried to believe but listen trying to believe will not produce the right kind of Faith it's by grace what we need is a revelation in the hour we need a revelation of the will of God that's faith that's true Faith that's the faith of God Amen we sometimes read and read and read and read and we want to know the message amen but you'll never know the message by reading because that's an intellectual realm when you read you say God I need you to whisper Your Love Secrets while I read I need you to come interpret this to me in my Heart Lord it's not in Reading it's in the whispering of God while you read you can read your Bible all day long but if God doesn't unlock the revelation of that word amen it's going to be intellectual what we need before I ever read the Bible when I pick it up I say God please help me to understand this word because reading and reading and reading is only going to produce more religion and more confusion but I need him to come and Whisper the love secrets in my ear while I'm reading when I read the message and when I need healing when I need Deliverance there's a such a trying and such a pressing sometimes and what it does is it actually hinders the flow of God because all of a sudden we're putting so much effort mental strain and effort amen what we need to do is relax and let God take over we're trying so hard to produce something Sonic trying so hard to have faith trying so hard to understand amen but since when did trying hard ever produce anything in the kingdom of God the whole secret through the Christian Life is rest sometimes I I've talked to people who are trying to believe and they're so frustrated trying to believe but I'm telling you that frustration is going to deafen the voice of God sometimes what we need to do is just recognize that without him I can't do it unless he comes and gives me a revelation I'm not able to produce anything through my efforts and through my mental strain what I need to do is receive him open myself and say God I'm here listening for you to whisper a love Secret in my heart something I can't give myself something I can't do for myself but you've got the answer to my problem you've got the solution to my need you know what I need and I'm going to relax myself in your presence and I'm just going to read the word and enjoy you whispering and answering in my heart I'm going to read my Bible I'm going to read not straining and trying and hoping and maybe in this next chapter will be my answer but I'm going to rest knowing that you know where I'm at and you know what I need and you know how to inject yourself in the situation and I'm desperate for you but I can't do anything but wait for you to come and give me the revelation of the world God I'm receiving you and I'm open to you and I'm listening for you I pray I pray that God would help us to recognize who we are and who he is and what he wants to do in our lives and take away all the mental strain and pressure from pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing I know this has been my biggest problem in the past trying and trying and trying said God forgive me for that help me just to trust to believe and rest and let you come and do the work that you need to do in my heart God I believe help thou my unbelief I believe help me in the areas where I need to grow help me in the Revelation I still need to receive I believe reveal more to me I'm here to receive it I mean that's what we need friends we need this still Small Voice we we need the love Secrets the revelation of the word that he's whispering to his beloved bride oh may God come to us Maine reveal himself to us and may he give us Faith by Revelation to do what he's called us to do in this without him it's not going to happen without him it's not possible but with him All Things Are possible what are we waiting on him why don't you get up and do something I'm waiting on him amen the Temptation is always there to press the Temptation is always there the Temptation is always there to make the pieces fit when they don't really fit but if we'll just sometimes wait and rest and wait till the Love secret comes and all of a sudden oh it fits I didn't have to push myself into a revelation I didn't have to make it happen I didn't have to push myself into believing for healing I just waited and when he dropped a seed of faith it was over that's what we need friends we need to be his bride and let him be the bridegroom we need to be the wife and let him be the husband and Whisper his love secrets into our heart and receive it and open ourselves to it depend upon it may God bless you all I love you all may God bless you remember to keep us in prayer and we'll be praying for you God bless you brother
