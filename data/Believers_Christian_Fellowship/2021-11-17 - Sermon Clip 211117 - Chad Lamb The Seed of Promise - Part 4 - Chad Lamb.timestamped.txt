[0:00] so you cannot take that book away from
[0:02] me i have i've eaten the book amen and
[0:05] me and the book have become one i
[0:06] already have the same experience that's
[0:08] spoken of in the scriptures and what
[0:10] brother branham tells us so you can't
[0:12] tell me the seals aren't open but
[0:13] neither can i tell you that the seals
[0:15] are open
[0:19] we all have to go to the message and
[0:21] find out where we are
[0:23] we've got to look into the word and find
[0:25] out where we are amen we're beyond the
[0:27] time of trying to persuade people to see
[0:29] things and we're beyond the time of
[0:31] trying to convince people and we're also
[0:33] beyond the time of trying to feel con
[0:35] convinced ourselves when we can convince
[0:36] somebody else amen this is an individual
[0:39] revelation to one person not a church
[0:41] not a group of people but to the
[0:43] individual that's what brother branham
[0:45] is teaching us after the opening of the
[0:47] seals this is no longer church this is
[0:48] bride this is to one this message came
[0:51] to one it came to you
[0:54] and now i'm not going to get my security
[0:57] from you agreeing with me
[1:00] [Applause]
[1:02] that's where the denominations were and
[1:04] they all fell they all agreed and they
[1:06] all went off the word agreeing that they
[1:08] were right
[1:10] so my security cannot come from you
[1:12] agreeing with me
[1:15] because then we take back another
[1:16] denominational spirit
[1:19] my security can only come when i know
[1:23] that i've met the mighty angel with the
[1:24] open book and i've taken that book and i
[1:27] began to eat that book and it was sweet
[1:29] in my mouth and it was bitter in my
[1:31] belly amen but now there's something in
[1:34] me like a spring of living water flowing
[1:36] out to eternal life that that revelation
[1:39] of the book is coming out of my mouth
[1:40] amen
[1:42] placing me amen in revelation chapter 10
[1:46] verse 11.
[1:48] you can't put me back in 5 because i'm
[1:50] in 11. i'm in revelation 10 11. you
[1:53] can't take me back to 5-1
[1:58] now if you're in 5-1 i say keep walking
[2:01] brother there's good roads ahead amen
[2:04] you're on the right path you're on the
[2:05] right trail you're in the book of
[2:07] revelation you're moving down through if
[2:09] you've just come to the message or god's
[2:10] never opened this to you and you're
[2:12] looking at revelations 5 1 and saying we
[2:14] need a lamb to come and take the book i
[2:16] say you're on the right path keep moving
[2:18] down because as you move through that
[2:20] book of revelation in the message of the
[2:22] hour you're going to find that there's a
[2:23] lamb that's come forth to take the book
[2:25] and loose the seven seals thereof
