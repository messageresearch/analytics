TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh well the sun is up now i can go free the chains that were holding me i can no longer see a long trumpet sound declaring my jubilee all that i once had again is restored to me because the truth is revealed he's opened the [Applause] [Music] up seals more time well the sun is up now i can go free it's chains that were holding [Music] again is restored to me because the truth is revealed he's opened the season [Music] there's never been a day like this [Music] [Applause] there's never been a light that shines so bright as this day this glory [Music] jesus christ [Music] my lord even so [Music] let's just sing the song as brother chad comes where he leads me you know he can he can come for us but we have to follow him [Music] behind we'll follow [Music] i'll go with him with him all the way where he leads me and where he lives [Music] where he leads [Music] with praise the lord man we'll go with him because we're predestinated to not because of our willpower or the strength in our resolve but the only way we're going to go with him all the way is because he determined before the foundation of the world that this bride won't fall she's predestinated not to all praise be to god and then while we're standing let's turn to the book of exodus and we'll go straight to the word exodus 34. i'll return there i just want to let you know that the new missions newsletter is out and available we've got it printed and it should be on the welcome desk and in the hallway so if you want to grab one of those that'd be great also want to thank brother kyle for last wednesday and brother ben for this past sunday they were wonderful services i enjoyed sitting in the service and feeding on the word so we're very privileged i'm very privileged to be able to sit and enjoy just like everybody else amen so we thank them for that let's look here at exodus 34 we're going to kind of pick up some things we talked about last time and move from there exodus 34 verse 1 and the lord said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and i will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou breakest and be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto mount sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mountain and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flock nor the herds feed before the mount and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and moses rose up early in the morning and went up into the mount sinai as the lord had commanded him and took in his hand the two tables of stone and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord man let's just pray lord jesus we just ask god that you would feed us on your word lord as we've come tonight lord to sing your praises to worship your name god we do so with a heart of joy lord and gratitude for all you've given to us all that you're speaking to us in this hour lord to awaken something inside to a greater realization lord a realization of a truth that we knew before the foundation of the world you're bringing us back to that truth lord we just pray tonight lord that you would move all carnality out of the way all flesh lord let it be laid aside and may you come and speak lord in the way that you provided god that you would speak your word and and draw us nearer to you we ask you to break the bread of life for us tonight in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated so we find moses goes up unto the mountain because god had given him two tables of stone where god had written cut the stone out of the mountain and he had written on the stone and and as moses is walking down he finds that uh israel had already slipped into idolatry and he broke the tables of stone because this is exactly what is going to happen in the beginning of the church ages because the word is going to come through a prophet through a messenger through through the apostle paul amen and right in the first church age they're going to slip into idolatry and the word is going to be fragmented and broken through seven church ages but at the end of seven church ages there's going to be a revelation that there's a white stone with nothing written on it amen so the prophet of god is going to go to mount sunset amen with the revelation of a white stone unwritten stone nothing written on the stone in his heart and he's going to get caught up into the constellation of seven angels to go back amen to find out what is the interpretation of the unwritten word amen and so now we see the same thing played out in moses amen and it's interesting everything that is has been before there is nothing new under the sun i mean the things they're going through now were there and and and all of that and i would even venture to say this is just me i don't have the authority to say but this is just the way i think everything that we're seeing amen right in genesis and exodus we see it again amen but but i don't know if that's the first time it's played out in genesis maybe the first time it played out was in heaven through a great battle and a falling away and to to a kingdom divided amen and then it spills down so everything that we see has been before all the way back because it's an old battle that started in heaven amen way back and it continues on and what started his angels has now fallen into human beings and so now we're here continuing on the same thing that's been so when we look back at this with eyes of understanding god taking the scale off of our eyes we can now begin to see amen he laid down patterns and those patterns continue and so now moses is going to the mountain the first word has been lost amen but now he's coming back to a mountain amen to get the writing for the for the unwritten word the stones with no writing on them praise be to god so we find out that god gives him that interpretation and actually commands him to write on the stone because the sword was given into the prophet's hand amen so he could carve out of the rock of revelation the hidden mystery that was contained in the bible amen praise god did we really think that was new when that happened when a sharp tool struck his hand and he peeled the top off revealing a stone with nothing written on it because moses had to take a sharp tool and cut out two tables of stone to restore the word and go into the mountain so god could give him the word amen because god says i'll write on those stones but but the prophet of god goes in january 1963 and sabino kenny's holding up his hand and a sword hits his hand and it's the sword of the lord and he said the lord only has one sword and that's his word amen so he takes a sharp instrument to cut out of that stone the interpretation of the unwritten word praise god amen first time we heard that we thought that's new where's that in the bible it's right here in moses but when the scale falls off of the eyes then we can see it everything brother branham did was scriptural it wasn't new this is scriptural this has been done before we just have to have eyes to see so now we look in verse five and it said and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord amen but he proclaimed the name of the lord but he didn't come down off of that mountain with a new spelling for a new name so to proclaim the name of the lord may be different than what we think brother brahm said in the message is this the sign of the answer he said when the world is so confused and do not know where they are standing we are glad that the name of the lord is a mighty tower and the righteous run into it and are safe just not so many words but a revelation just not words just not spelling but a revelation because the name of the lord is a strong tower that the righteous run into it's not like you can take and and do paper mache uh a carving of the name jesus and climb inside the name it's the revelation of who that person is in this day is the strong tower that the righteous run into amen not who jesus was but who jesus is is the revelation of his name and it is the strong tower that the righteous run into and are saved not just so many words but a revelation he goes on to saying god's only provided place of worship so then the name is the word because he is the word amen what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god the word interpret is the manifestation of the name of god and he didn't change the english spelling not a new name but a further revelation of who that person is that carries that name the word interpret is the manifestation of the name of god no wonder flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who i am and upon this rock i'll build my place of worship and the gates of hell can't shake it down man so it's important to know that name but there's billions who know that the name jesus christ amen and evoke that name jesus christ but if we do so without the knowledge of who he is today it doesn't bring the same strength that's not the same strong tower in fact there's much deception going out among the land in that name so how do you know if what you're receiving in that name is a tower of deception or a strong tower for the day of battle amen you only know by the revelation of who that person is now and only that revelation amen will will cut away all deception so there's billions millions being deceived in the name of jesus but there's an elect group who's caught the manifestation the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of god and they've caught it and to them it's a strong tower and now they have his name man let's look at exodus 34 29. i'm gonna move on a little bit 29 exodus 34 and 29 and it came to pass when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tables of testimony in moses hand when he came down from the mount that moses was not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses behold the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come nigh unto him and moses called unto them and aaron and all the rulers of of the congregation returned unto him and moses talked with them and afterward all the children of israel came nigh and gave and he gave them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount sinai until moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face but when moses went in before the lord to speak with him he took the veil off until he came out and he came out and spake unto the children of israel that which he was commanded and the children of israel saw the face of moses and the skin of moses face shone and moses put the veil upon his face again until he went in to speak with him so now we find this is a interesting and i want to elaborate on this a little bit but moses he goes and receives the word of god and he goes upon the mount amen and up upon the mount he receives a revelation from god himself and when he comes down he doesn't even realize he's shining his face is shining so bright that it's scaring amen the rest of the congregation until he has to veil his face uh now we realize the illumination by revelation is a scary thing to those who haven't caught the revelation we see it all the way back amen what we're going through now is nothing new it has been before and when moses comes down off the mount and what did he receive the true word of god the true revelation of god the judgments and commandments of god and he came down because now he carries carrying the word and the word is the light of the lord and when he's carrying the word now he's a word bearer and with the word bearer now he's a light emanator amen in the lightest show bright shining off of his face and brother remember said off his face because the words were coming out of his mouth amen shining out of his face that it was frightening to the congregation oh praise be to god amen and today amen the revelation of the mystery that's being revealed right now on his bride can be frightening amen to the rest of the congregation until they catch the mystery themselves praise be to god so moses did him a favor and covered his face with the veil let's go to second corinthians second corinthians and we're going to come back to exodus but let's go to second corinthians chapter 3. second corinthians chapter 3 and verse 12. now now you'll see friends if you've if you've ever been on that mountaintop yourself and caught the revelation from god himself now you know why some people that you were friends with begin to run away from you when you come down from the mountain because even moses brother aaron was afraid of him even his family and his friends the rest of the congregation had no problem with moses amen until moses had been on the mountain caught the revelation and when he come down the revelation the light that was coming from him was so bright amen that they stood afar off they were afraid of him now we understand praise god second corinthians 3 verse 12. seeing seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remain at the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in the glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so now moses wearing a veil was very symbolic because moses came down and he gave commandments it gave he gave verbal dialogue and he even wrote the commandments and the judgments in a book and even had two tables of stone and they they coming down would receive the written word now catch this closely they would receive the written word they would receive the words that that he spoke and they would receive the words that were written down and the words that were chiseled in the stone but because they hadn't been on the mountain themselves and gotten it from god they got it second hand and when it came second hand moses had it firsthand and firsthand he was the illumination but when it came secondhand into their hands now the veil moved from moses face to their heart because now the word couldn't come into the heart because they didn't go to the mountain themselves and get the word they were trying to get the word second hand this is really important because what is the new birth brother branham it's jesus christ revealed personally to you amen matthew 16 who do men say that i am some say this and say who do you say that i am he said thou art christ the son of the living god said blessed art thou because flesh and blood hath not revealed to you you did not get this revelation second hand because somebody said it and you could read it and you nodded your head in agreement amen that will put a veil over your heart if it happened in exodus it'll happen today being able to open a message book and read a message book and not our head does not mean that there's not a veil on our heart amen how do we get the veil off of our heart listen this is what he said he said verse 14 but their minds were blinded for unto this day remain at the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ how do i get the veil removed when i get in christ amen by a revelation and a new birth amen then the veil is taken away and now it's not secondhand revelation it is direct because now i've united with christ i'm a part of him i'm in him and the revelations come direct to rent the veil of my heart amen so that now i can see oh there's nothing new under the sun what has been is again so now verse 15 but even unto this day when moses read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty or freedom but we all with open face we all with open face what's he saying we have come into christ the veil is off of our heart the veil is off of our face now with the unveiled face amen we're looking directly amen not second hand amen not looking we're not looking at print on paper we're looking at jesus christ himself with an open face face to face with him praise be to god now we all with open face be holding as in a glass as in a mirror as in the glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of the lord so now i mean this gets more and more interesting all the time so now with an unveiled face because i've united christ whatever i'm looking at in the uh with an unveiled face with a revelation that comes from god i'm being changed into that image and if i'm looking at christ i'm being changed into christ from glory unto glory unto glory i'm being changed into the image of the thing i'm looking at with an unveiled face because the veil has been taken away by a revelation that came from the father himself to remove the veil off of my face to remove the veil off of my heart and whatever i see with an unveiled face is what i am becoming but you cannot become christ with a veiled face praise god it doesn't matter i'm going to go slow it doesn't matter how much we repeat the phrases this is really important repeating the phrases will not take the veil away because through all the old testament the priests were repeating the phrases and all the ceremonial worship and all the reading of the law they were repeating the phrases but repeating the phrases didn't take the veil away they had to come into christ and when they came into christ it took the veil then is rent it's removed it's parted it's not new words this is what's interesting when the veil was taken away the apostle paul is on a journey to damascus and the apostle paul is veiled to the truth when paul preaches this he knows what he's talking about because he had the veil on his heart he was persecuting christ amen christ spoke to him out of a pillar of fire and said saul saul why does thou kick against the priest he says he says who are you lord he said i'm jesus whom you persecute and he was persecuting the children of god he was persecuting the christians amen and they were christ they were jesus christ he was persecuting jesus christ because jesus christ was behind the veil of their flesh and he couldn't see behind the veil of flesh to find out who was there because he had a veil on his heart and because he had the veil in his heart he couldn't see what was behind the veil of their flesh but if god removes the veil off your heart you'll see what's behind the veil of flesh of your brother and sister so paul he's he's going down and he knows the words he knows the law he's read he can repeat he can probably quote verbatim the message but there's a veil on his heart and because there's a veil in his heart he'll persecute christ in flesh and when god gets a hold of paul amen and paul catches a revelation it's amazing the first thing that happens to paul is his natural eyesight goes black because paul was viewing the word through natural intellectual understanding so god symbolically smashes his natural ability to see you see the word is so perfect why did he smite him blind why did he have to smite him blind what was the point of smiting blind because he thought he could see and god had to say you can't see because his intellectual understanding was natural carnal understanding of words that were written and put in the book and copied by scribes so god smote him blind so he would see and told him that now you're going to be a light to the gentiles i'm going to send you forth to preach of the gentiles this is going to be your commission amen and now he against come not it wasn't agabus it was ananias i believe anyways you know who i'm talking about comes and he lays hands on him he receives the holy ghost scales for all of his eyes and now he can see and now it's not natural vision but now it's supernatural vision by revelation and he goes into the desert of arabia for three and a half years and is taught by christ the word now here's the amazing part paul with a veil over his heart cannot recognize christ in his day he cannot recognize the word he cannot see the fulfillment of prophecy he cannot even understand what moses wrote but as soon as god takes the scale off of his eyes not natural but the heart amen now he can teach him amen he can teach him the revelation of christ and how does jesus teach him the revelation of christ he takes him right back to the same books he's been reading all of his life and with the veil off of his heart he sees christ [Applause] and then paul goes from city to city going into the synagogue preaching christ from the scriptures the same scriptures he read that caused him to disbelieve now he reads the same scriptures that cause him to believe i just want to tell you friends the the message can be read the same exact way you can read quotes that cause you to disbelieve the revelation of christ in this day but when the veil is taken off of your heart you go back to the same quotes amen and now all of a sudden you you see the revelation of christ in your day because god did not give paul a new bible paul's bible became a new book amen oh this is why brother abraham said pray for revelation above everything else pray for revelation because the intellect's never going to get it amen years of service are never going to get it listening to it a thousand times is never going to get it amen if you're not in christ the veil is not taken away but in christ the veil is taken away and now the same tapes we've listened to become new tapes how many has experienced that the same books we read become new books the same bible becomes a new bible i don't read it the same way i've read it before now when i read it it's different but it's the same words why because the veil has to be taken away let's go back to exodus 19. let's take a look here at a couple things a lot of this is review i just wanted to slow down and catch up and review exodus 19 and 10. exodus 19 and 10 and the lord said unto moses go into the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and let them wash their clothes and be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying take heed to yourselves that you go not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death there shall not be a hand touch it but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not live when the trumpet soundeth long then shall thou come up to the mountain so now this is interesting we've talked about this before a couple years ago maybe but but he tells him don't come up to the mountain stay away from the mountain but when the trumpet soundeth long then come to the mountain and that long trumpet sound amen is going to be the voice of god speaking directly from heaven to the people and when they hear that trumpet sound long they're supposed to come up to the mountain let's keep your place in exodus let's go to deuteronomy 5. we're going to take our time here but there's a reason for it i trust i pray deuteronomy 5 verse 2 the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb horeb and sinai are the same place the lord made not this covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this day the lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire i stood between the lord and you at that time to show you the word of the lord for ye were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the mount now he's saying now god had sent a prophet to go gather his people out of bondage out of egypt out of the church ages and he sent a prophet to gather them out of bondage and for us the church ages represent bondage bondage by the chains of men's doctrines and creeds and their own intellectual ideas had bound the holy ghost if the holy ghost is bound friends you're bound [Music] because we can only do move breathe we can only do what we can do by the spirit of god and if the spirit of god is bound we're bound so this holy ghost was bound by the rivers of denomination and creeds and ideas of man and all of these factions amen so for us the denominations as our is our egypt is our bondage amen and god sent a prophet moses down to gather them through many signs and wonders to gather the people and bring them out of bondage to bring them to mount sinai and he was going to meet them on mount sinai and he was going to give them a marriage covenant and they were going to be united there why it was all about marriage he was sending eliezer to fetch a bride but he told her when you hear that trumpet sound long when you hear my voice amen when you hear the voice of the seven thunders thundering what was the long trumpet if you read through we won't take time to read through that long trumpet sound was him thundering out the ten commandments the ten commandments was the only law he was going to give them and it was a marriage covenant between him and them if you'll do this i will be your husband you will be my bride that's it the voice of god him speaking directly to them the 10 commandments was going to be it he was going to add no more to it amen but they refused and when they heard that long voice thundering out what was the thundering what was the long trumpet sound what was the long blast that went forth it was the ten commandments and in our day what was the long trumpet sound what was the long gospel trumpet that sounded it was the seven thunders yes so under the long trumpet was ten commandments and for us under the long trumpet was seven thunders when they heard it they were supposed to come up to god to come up to the mountain and moses said when you heard it i stood between you now because you refuse you need an intercessor you need a go-between now you cry out for a prophet and god said that's good that's what i'll do that's the way i'll do it from now on amen but it wasn't his original idea his original ideas i speak the thunders to you and you come to me hey amen let's go back to exodus 20 and verse 18. and all the people saw the thunderings all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off what were they supposed to do come up to the mountain what did they do ran away this is important we understand this because when we get to another passage of scripture we have to understand what happened they did the opposite what god told them to do they removed and stood afar off and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die god wanted to marry them and god wanted to speak to them and they refused to hear from their husband and they wanted another man in between this is where brother branham said they made their fatal mistake in exodus 19. this is the fatal mistake when he said when you hear that trumpet sound come unto me and they ran away and said moses you go to him amen we want you to go we don't want to have to go but you come back tell us what we said and we'll do all that he said that wasn't the original plan or the original idea and that's where he didn't just give him the ten commandments now now he gave him a whole set of statutes and judgments and a law amen because now they couldn't accept grace and grace was the ability to hear from god what is grace to you and i the ability to hear from god personally a revelation in this day amen he may have used the voice of a prophet on a tape but amen that was not the voice of a prophet that wrote the veil in my heart that was the voice of god thundering out inside of me that rent the veil in my heart and took the veil away of denominationalism that had veiled me from understanding my bible amen because what have we done we've come right back to where we were amen amen everything that is has been before and so now they they ran away verse 19 and they said moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die and they chose law over grace they chose a system over direct contact with god i'm telling you well you know the scripture says that the sight of the the fire coming down and the roaring of the thunder and the lightning and the great smoke it was so fearful that moses said he exceedingly feared and quaked right he was exceedingly fearful it was a scary thing because now when when you hear from god directly and you go to god yourself amen there is no room for margin of error there is no room for sin in our life amen they could not endure the commandment is what the scripture says what was the commandment the commandment was come to me come to the burning fire come to the thunder come to the lightning come to the judge come to the judgment seat and they couldn't endure the commandment they couldn't obey amen but it's funny they couldn't do it but moses although he exceedingly feared he trembled he went into that cloud he went to the judgment seat he went to the smoke and the fire and the thunder and lightning proving that they could have went too they could have went but they were too afraid to face god themselves they wanted a mediator in between why because when you have a personal relationship with god you get away with nothing he reveals to the thunders and the lightnings and the smoke and the fire and he rips you wide open and he looks at every crack and crevice in your life and you get away with nothing but under the system all you got to do is keep the systems protocols and if you keep the systems protocols then your stamped is fine amen but if you go to god yourself through smoke and fire and lightning and voices and thunderings amen there's nothing between you and god and god will judge your life to purge it of sin so that he can dwell inside what did god want to do he didn't want to destroy them he wanted to become one with them but in order to become one with them they had to go to the judgment seat and let the thunder and lightning purge them purge them of what purged them of egypt and we've come to the same thing at the end of time amen we've come to the voices and thunderings and lightning go to revelation 4 and in revelation 4 when john is caught up after the church ages and he sees one sitting on the throne and there's thunderings and lightnings and voices what is that he's coming to the judgment seat praise god that's what people don't want that's what we fear that's what makes us exceedingly fear and quake and if it doesn't make you exceedingly fair and quake there's something wrong in your mind because this is a real god amen but he doesn't just want he's not looking for another system another denomination another church he's looking for a wife somebody that'll pass through the fire of his word and unite with him but i go trembling of course you go trembling you should go trembling but let that fire and smoke and lightning burn it out where else will they be purged where else would they be purged but on top the mountain and they ran from the very thing that would have purged them from egypt and made them fit to unite with him i don't want to run from the very thing that god has sent in this day to purge me from egypt so that i can unite with him you see we're a man verse 19 and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die you're supposed to die that's the whole point let god speak to you and die ah i can't live the message has anybody ever heard that before i love the lord but i can't live the message i just can't do it i did what's happening somebody's refusing to climb the mountain and get to the top because they're afraid they'll die when that's the very thing that's supposed to happen we're supposed to die because you can't live the message the way you are you have to die and be born again to live the message and so many people have run away from the mountain which is the message amen and who's at the top of the message it's god himself amen come down at the top to cap it off the capping stone the headstone jesus christ himself is there and we're supposed to go up to him but many people have run away because i can't live this message you go to god don't let him speak to us anymore lest we die and that was the whole point friends is to die so we run away from the very thing that we're supposed to be running to and blaming the word for our rebellion blaming god for our rebellious spirit i can't live that standard i can't do that whose standard is it whose word is it who gave the word who gave the commandment it's god's word god's commandment god's standard and now i'm blaming god for not serving god it's god's fault because he has too many standards he's got too many don't let that deceiving devil ever deceive you amen if you're a mom and a dad or a friend or a brother or sister or somebody who's running away saying i can't let this out it's just too hard don't you show pity and feel sorry for them they need to run right back up into the face of christ and say christ kill me slay me let the thunder slay me let the lightning slay me let the fire burn me up because i can't live this word i can't perform the word i can't live the message but don't pet him and say it's okay it's all right i know it's hard don't be deceived by that that's a lying devil trying to blame god for their rebellion that's the truth friends the devil's a slick tongue and he's always trying to get somebody to feel sorry for him it's nothing but the devil amen because the word will slay you and the word will raise you up again but we want to be raised up before we're slain we want to climb the mountain without it being scary or we want somebody else to climb the mountain for us pass us down a few tidbits to keep us alive and keep us strong on amen we use parents we use spouses we use preachers we use the prophet to do that very thing oh yeah many times people will ask a preacher what do you think about this you know this marriage situation what do you think about you know if you trim your hair a little bit what do you think about this what do you think about that you know what they're trying to do they're trying to avoid going to the top of the mountain or instead of praying we'll hit a quote list i got 400 quotes on this and uh oh yeah yeah yeah i like this quote right why do you pick that quote out of the 30 you pulled up on whatever subject be it trimming the hair be a dress be it whatever you want to pull up whatever subject you feel like pulling up entertainment or whatever and then you hit a you hit a quote list amen what made you pick that one or those two or those three you're trying to use brother branham just the same way they used moses back then you talk to god you tell me i'll do it then i can blame you for the rebellion that's in my heart because i want to do what i want to do anyways so i search to find a quote that tells me i can do what i want to do so that when i face god i can say brother branham said and it's his fault because we don't want to stand in the face of god this true word in this day and say judge me burn me shine the lightning expose me and let me be a real christian a real genuine christian not a message believer not a church goer not a bcf yet but i want to be a son or daughter of god and i want to be united in a holy union visible you with him with nothing in between not a spouse not a parent not a preacher not a church nothing burn me out god slay me dead then raise me up the way you want me to be see what i'm doing today is exposing the devil because he tries all of these little tactics you get a man who wants to be remarried and he's got no scriptural right to be remarried he'll go to church to church to church until they find a preacher that'll agree with him because he didn't want to go to the top of the mountain and let those seven thunders judge him it happens over and over and over again a lot of church switching is just so we don't have to go to the mountain ourselves and die and be judged praise be to god once you go to the top of that mountain once you're caught up into that cloud once you've been slain and resurrected it don't matter what the preacher says it matters what your father says [Applause] do you understand what i'm saying and it doesn't even matter what brother branham permits and the questions and answers when they're asked a question a certain way your heart tells you no even though the prophet said it would be okay something in you says no because you've been to the top of the mountain you've met with him directly and now you're not going to do it because your father said no so now you don't need a preacher's opinion you don't need to go around and get a consensus from the church talking to all the brothers what do you think about this what you think about that what we need is more people who will hear the trumpet blast and go up the mountain to meet him praise be to god you know how little trouble we'd have in the church how little trouble we'd have in our homes in our lives if we would just let the word slay us if we would just climb the mountain for ourselves and not be content that brother branham was there oh praise god praise god praise god 3 verse 19 again and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die and moses said unto the people fear not for god has come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that you sin not and the people stood afar off and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was this is why moses could come down with an illuminated face and this is why the veil would go over their hearts they couldn't even accept what god had spoke through moses because the veil moved from his face to their heart because he's the only one that went up when they were all told to go up let's not live in the day where brother brenham's the only one who got caught into that cloud let's not live like they lived back here and moses you go up brother brandon you go up you get the revelation of the seven thunders you come preach the seals i'll read it and that's fine with me no friends i want to go up to you i want to go wherever he went i want to go if moses couldn't make it i can make it to do you understand if brother branham can make it i can make it too why because he was the wave chief offering in him was the first part of the word bride word to come to full harvest maturity amen showing what would happen to the rest of the congregation if he made the journey if i come to maturity i can make the journey too praise be to god let's go to hebrews 12 together hebrews 12 verse 18 for year not come to the mount that might be touched what is the apostle paul doing he's taking this church right back to mount sinai you know because when paul caught the revelation what book did he read when paul caught the revelation for his day where did he find the prophecies in the revelation for his day he found it in the old testament so so paul extracted from the old testament the revelation of christ and wrote the new testament where did all the material for the new testament come from the old testament but paul had the veil removed so that he could read the book correctly now and when he read the book correctly he could see the mystery coming all the way through and that mystery was christ and now he could lay the foundation now paul is he he's caught the capping of the old testament and that image of the old testament was a man god in flesh amen amen and he caught that mystery amen when he caught that mystery paul amen he now he laid the cornerstone in the foundation for what for the bride now he realizes in laying and down jesus christ being the chief cornerstone built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets and paul says i as a master a wise master builder has laid the foundation so now we realize if paul lays the foundation who's going to finish it paul lays the foundation where does he get the foundation where does he get the dimensions for the drawing he gets it out of the old testament and he brings it right up and now he says it's christ in you the hope of glory what's he doing he's laying the foundation that the rest of the church is going to be built on amen because the stone that he laid as the cornerstone is going to become the same as the head of the corner as the headstone which was christ the revelation of christ the revelation of the entire old testament now brought into the church as the cornerstone that the church is built on and every church age builds on top of this foundation until we come to the top and the same thing that started it is now the thing that captures it and so now there was a wise master builder that laid a cornerstone and a foundation and that master builder amen got all the uh the drawings and the plans out of the old testament and brought it over and now we come to the end of the building the capping off of the church at the end of the laodicean church age and there has to be another master builder because the cornerstone has to now fit as the headstone so god sends another prophet and he caps off what the old testament where does brother branham get his message he said i preached what paul preached what did paul preach paul preached what moses preached so that's why you know this is why friends brother branham could go all the way back to exodus and show a first exodus and a second exodus and a third exodus amen because moses he were here where moses amen had laid down the pattern in the word paul had continued the pattern in the word and brother branham sees the pattern and reveals the entire pattern from the word nothing has changed when the veil is taken away amen you could look all the way back from genesis to revelation and find us the same thing happening throughout the entire book [Music] so paul gets his message from the old testament brother branham gets his message from the whole bible why because when he preaches the seven seals he says and when he comes to christ is the mystery of god revealed amen when he's really breaking down the seventh seal he said i want to take from my text the entire bible not a new book not a new revelation amen but a veil that through the seven thunders a veil that has been taken away amen from the heart of a human being to where now he can look back and say i'm going to preach a message that's going to require the understanding of the entire bible to understand to preach this message i need the context of the whole of written scriptures [Music] we've not followed cunningly devised fables enticing words of man's wisdom but this is the word friends this is the word made manifest in our day [Music] let's keep reading here in hebrews hebrews 12 and 18 for you're not coming to the mount that might be touched that burn with fire nor into blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet in the voice of words which voice that they heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they not could not endure that which was commanded you know it wasn't the ten commandments they couldn't endure because they kept the ten commandments right it wasn't the ten commandments because then those ten commandments were written on tables of stone they had them they copied them they studied them they tried to live them that wasn't what they couldn't endure it wasn't those ten commandments they couldn't endure it was the commandment to come up to the mountain when you hear the trumpet that's the commandment they couldn't endure because they were so afraid to face god one on one and i don't blame them because there had been no bloodshed for their sins yet but we stand in a different place seeing redemption cycle completed and we realize that there was a lamb god provided the lamb and that lamb shed his blood to cover my sins and now i should have no fear to go into the presence of god i can't hardly blame them back there because they had no shedding of blood for the remission of their sins but we have the shedding of blood amen we have the life of god amen on display amen we should be running up that mountain through the thunders and the lightnings and the quakes hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah verse 20 again for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake but you are coming to mount zion and to the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly in the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel see that you refuse not him that speaketh see what he's tying them to he's tying them to a marriage covenant and a marriage union and when it came time for the marriage ceremony they refused and they were a runaway bride and now he's coming here and he's telling this church he said don't refuse him that speaketh don't repeat the same thing he said now see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not earth only but also heaven in this word yet once more signifying the removing of those things that are shaken as of those things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire you realize he said you've come to the mountain but the fire of god has not changed the power and demonstration of god has not changed our god is a consuming fire approaching with fear amen approaching reverently with fear because he's still a god who wants to judge and he's still a consuming fire and i say friends that's the very reason we should run to him and let the fire of god burn all the dross out not cause us to run from him but cause us to run to him moses received the revelation of the word and he became the light so much so that a veil had to be over his face because i don't know how to say this because in their condition they cannot handle the light of god so the veil was put over their face not for moses but for the unbelievers then god from then on says i will veil myself behind human flesh i'll send the prophet and god in his mercy sent a veiled uh his light and a veil all the way down to paul paul now as is going to fulfill the prophecy that he's going to be a light to lighten the gentiles from isaiah 49 and now he's going to be the one commissioned to fulfill that he's the light bearer he's carrying the light he's the prophet of god and it's still behind the veil and today the light is still behind the veil a veil on earth not one that died 50 years ago but the light of god has hid behind a veil today of vessels of clay on earth today and you can never see it till the veil is taken off of your heart so god has still veiled his word but it's not veiled to his bride brother benham referring to paul in his road to damascus experience he says paul has something greater than any of the apostles did see they said well i've got more of a revelation than you paul because you know i walked with him i went fishing with him one day i heard him talk he sat in a boat with me and actually told me let's go over here and fish in this place and we'll get more fish and we did it see see we seen him do those things but so but paul saw him after he was dead buried rose again and expressed himself in the pillar of fire that led the children of israel so paul sees him converted back to what he was in moses day and moses message and he recognizes when he sees the pillar of fire he says he knows this lord he says lord who are you says i'm jesus whom you persecuted mean the pillar of fire had now moved into the people that paul was persecuting now when he saw it as a pillar of fire he knew it was the same pillar of fire that led the children out of israel so the same one that let them are out of egypt the same one that led him out of egypt was now abiding in a people and paul was persecuting those people so he showed himself to paul in his original form of a pillar of fire and paul knew that was the lord and then he identified himself as jesus what was he doing paul did not see the man who had been pierced but he saw jesus do we understand paul did not see the man who was in peers but when he saw the light he asked the light who are you he's communicating with the light because the light is a person oh just let our carnal mind melt down to oblivion right now but the light is a person the person of the word was speaking to paul and say paul why do you persecute me he said who are you what is now now what is paul going to receive paul is going to receive the interpretation of the word will become the manifestation of god because the interpretation of the word is i'm not jesus who was pierced and then say i'm jesus who hung on a cross he said i am jesus whom you persecute present tense jesus in the people today so the manifestation of the name of god is the interpretation of the word present tense and paul did not get an old image of jesus paul got a present tense image of jesus and the present tense image of jesus revealed the revelation of the hour to paul and positionally placed paul in the program and if we want to get positionally placed in the program we can't keep looking back to the man who walked the sea of galilee we've got to find the strong tower today because the word interpreted today is the manifestation of the name i can be saying the name and get no benefit of the name because i don't know who's carrying the name now [Applause] oh you're a mature people you understand what i'm talking we're not taking away from the manifestation of god and flesh amen guess what we're going to enjoy worshiping jesus christ in the flesh seeing his nail scars at some point and we will bow before that vessel and we will worship and enjoy it he'll sit as a king of the whole world on the throne of david and he will get worship from the whole world including his bride and we will worship him and enjoy that not diminishing from that but if we go back we're going to miss what paul got what paul got was a present tense jesus and the present chance jesus was the only thing that can cure his blindness he had a veil over his heart amen and looking back was not going to cure the veil in his heart he had to meet jesus christ for his day oh praise god we shouldn't be afraid of that that's the one of the most powerful revelations that we can ever give to somebody is that jesus christ is alive and well today behind the veil the same one that led him out of egypt as a pillar of fire the same one paul met on the road to damascus the same one that appeared in a cloud is still here inside his bride [Applause] praise be the god where is that cloud they realize i wish i could have seen the cloud if you can't see it now you need to go yourself into the cloud so the veil can be taken over your heart because the cloud is here the cloud is still here brother branham when he looked at that cloud he saw a pyramid a white pyramid reflecting back to judeo-jackson's dream because inside that pyramid of stone which represented the word of god had funny writing all over the outside brother had to go around amen and what carved the writing the word that had been washing down over it had carved this funny writing oh the word had made a writing in our bible and nobody could interpret it but brother branham he was the only one who could interpret it so now he comes as the seventh church age messenger to interpret the writing on the outside and then he took a sharp instrument and peeled the top off and showed that there's another pyramid within the pyramid there's unwritten word inside the written word and inside the written word is the mystery of what this is all about so when brother branham sees that pyramid of a cloud he's tying it right back to junior jackson's stream and here comes a white pyramid cloud and he gets caught up into the midst of that pyramid because in the white rock is the revelation of the unwritten word or the seven thunders that takes the mystery off the whole bible and so brother bread and where does brother branham go when the cloud appears where does he go he goes into the midst into the middle of the pyramid because you've got to find yourself in that pyramid oh i hope it's not too mysterious brother i was talking symbols and he's using types and shadows and pyramids this and pyramids that but the pyramid coming out of the earth where the water had washed it away and exposed that there was a pyramid amen and the words on it brother rims tying together the loose sins from the seven church ages and revealing serpent seed water baptism godhead he's revealing all that and when he's done revealing all of that after he ties together all the loose sins he pops the top off and reveals that within the bible just take the pyramid as the bible with the ink blots you can read but he pops the top off and shows there's white stone with nothing written on it showing that there's something else in this bible in the same shape and form of the bible amen but light has never shown on this before meaning it's a revelation that no one's ever looked at before because brother branham said they were probing at the seals what the white horse meant what the red horse meant but nobody ever knew there were seven thunders to be revealed light's never shown on this before what is it a mystery inside the word that's the same shape of the word but it's going to take an encounter with jesus christ himself for him to be able to interpret the unwritten word which is what what's the unwritten word what the white horse is what the red no friends the unwritten word is the mystery that's been laying all through the bible that he showed all the way back in genesis when he made a man and out of the man he took a woman and he put the two together in a garden of eden and there it is right there and the whole bible has been god getting back to that and that's the pyramid inside the pyramid what's the whole bible been about the whole bible has been about that the whole bible is a love story the whole bible is christ the mystery of god revealed and christ is just like adam he's the last adam the first adam had a bride the last adam has a bride the first adam and his bride ruled over the earth in a perfect condition called an eden amen and the the last adam with his bride is going to rule over the earth in a perfect condition like in eden what is it it's the mystery within the word and brother and and the word is christ jesus christ christ christ is the mystery of god revealed so when he sees that when he sees that pyramid coming down that cloud pyramid coming down he gets caught up into the middle of that and all brother branham knows at that time is that seven angels representing the mystery through the seven church ages and the seven angels making up a pyramid and he gets caught into that and they bring him back east for the interpretation of the seven thunders and he doesn't even know where he was just in the constellation of angels until a little bit later after he preaches the seals he's looking at the picture and a voice says turn it right and he says it is right like he can see the horizon the grounds here the pictures there and he was then i thought they said turn it right and i thought maybe meant to the right and we turned it right he said there it was hoffman's head of christ the headship the pyramid the capping stone the great revelation that's going to cap off the whole bible to reveal what the whole bible's been about that great capstone was the headship of christ himself the mind of christ amen the headship the husband coming to the bride all of these terms that he used it all means the same thing and when it comes down it caps off the bride and when brother branham turns that capping stone he realizes it is the headstone because he sees the head of christ hoffman's head of christ at 33. showing who this revelation is all about the bride is his body he's the head the two have united back together in an invisible union that's a wonderful story it's an amazing story but if we let brother brandon be the only one who got caught up in that cloud we've done no different than the israelites did standing at mount zion because brother didn't get caught in that cloud just so he can continue to be a mediator between us and god he got caught in that cloud to show us that now you can go into the mind of christ what is it it's the head where did he go into the head he went into the mind of christ the mysteries revealed the mystery the seals that had sealed up the entire book being loosed opening up the entire bible the mind of christ is now available and you yourself can go into the mind of christ because if we just let brother branham go there just like moses going to the top of the mountain and coming out and brother bam tells us all about it that is the reason for 50 some years amen we've been fussing and fighting over quotes is because we let brother branham go up into the mind of christ come out and give us a tapes and put it in a book and we tape the books and we start fighting each other on the quotes and then why are we fighting over the quotes the same reason the sadducees and the pharisees and the herodians and all of them were fighting over the quotes because they didn't go to the mountain themselves to get the revelation from god [Music] but what is it we're supposed to do get caught up get caught up and go into the mind of christ go into the cloud ourselves to do what to be resurrected to go in the rapture amen what do you mean go in the rest of the church brother branham said when you heard that eagle scream when you recognize what it was you were raptured right up right then i've been raptured up where did you get raptured to i raptured right up into that cloud right into the mind of christ and god told me who i was and he told me who he was amen and now i can come back down and we can talk about those things and we read our book and the book becomes a new book christ as the mystery of god revealed becomes a new book amen the book of revelation becomes a new book why because we ourselves went to the same place the prophet went see the israelites were afraid to go there it was scary to go there because there was huge consequences for going there and i'll say the same thing there's huge consequences for getting caught up into that cloud huge because you can't hide your life you can't play pretend and you can't play church anymore now it's you and christ and nobody in between and there's no games there's no churchianity there's no looking nice for the for the people and the pews next to me none of that counts anymore it's risky business man you know what else happens you take on the mind of christ you take on the nature of christ and anybody who's ever taken on the nature of christ has been rejected and hated and stoned and beheaded amen everyone look at noah look at isaiah look at jeremiah look at dave look at them all everyone who's went and caught a revelation a man of their day and then got a portion of the mind of christ and began to express that everyone was rejected and hated of men it's risky to go to that it's risky to go to the top of mount zion but where did he come he come to the top of mount zion the cat mount zion and that's the only place to be in an individual personal revelation of who jesus christ is today i want to send notice the group thing is done [Applause] the group message walk is done finished won't work all of us being together done i want to be together we love to be together but all of us being comfortable because we're together that's finished that won't work no more we got to get down to the fact if i'm by myself all alone with not another believer around i still know who i am and who he is i know what happened today i know what that cloud was i know what the revelation of the mystery of christ i can't explain it thoroughly i may not be able to diagram it for you but i know inside of me the veil has been taken over my heart and i behold him as in the glass and i'm being changed into the thing i'm looking at he's chained he's absolutely changing me amen i'm already resurrected in christ jesus i'm my brother brethren said the quickening power which is this revelation friends don't kid yourself not a sensation not an emotion but this revelation of you getting caught up into the mind of christ it is the quickening power that comes that'll quicken your mortal body into a raptured condition now [Music] brother branham said so the easter seal go read it amen you used to smoke you used to drink you used to do this hey i think friends we should still be saying i used to and you say when you say last week because that quickening power is working in me every day to change me for what i was to what i am rapturing and rapturing and rapturing and rapturing until this body's done rapturing amen because i'm in the rapture and the word is taking effect and it is lifting me higher i'm not in the world anymore i don't live like the world anymore the things that used to hold me don't hold me anymore i've been resurrected out of the church ages brought out a denominationalism amen lifted onto a higher plane raptured where raptured into that cloud bringing this body into a raptured condition oh praise be to god it's not it's not good enough that moses went to the mountain where did that leave israel i say it's not good enough that brother branham got caught into the cloud the constellation of angels i've got to be caught into the constellation constellation of angels into the mind of christ connected to my headship my headship my personal headship the person of the word the lord jesus christ today what paul got in his day i've got to have in my day i've got to have an encounter with the pillar of fire that i know is the lord god almighty when i ask him who am i he says i am christ the message that you're believing i am christ the word that you're feeding on i'm christ the bride that you're dwelling with i am christ amen that's the only way to make it in this day is to get caught into that cloud ourselves brother branham was the tool that god used to show that there was a white rock under the rock he's the tool that god used to show what would happen in the wave chief when when when he gets caught up but he was demonstrating for you and i and i want to go to the top of this mount zion i don't want to stand here at the bottom and say i've come to mount zion i've come to mount zion it's like coming to mount sinai i'm at mount sinai i'm outside that god didn't want them at mount sinai god wanted them to him i've come to the word i've come to the word but have you united with the person of the word if we unite with the person of the word we get caught into the mind of christ he takes the veil over our hearts and every time we pick up a message book it's a new book every time we read our bible it's a new bible there's a quote here i want to read i'm so far away from where i thought i'd be but praise be to god anyhow the seventh seal he says i was standing right there and this explosion left and i was looking this way towards the west and they come and just pick me up and there and i went plum out of my knowing that's the key he just gave us the key when you get caught up into this constellation of angels you're going to get plumb out of your knowing i thought i knew the message i thought i knew the bible i thought i knew that but i got plumb out of my knowing and i realized i've been missing the whole thing praise be to god i say god catch me up till i go plum out of my knowing and then you inject your life your mind right into my heart tear the veil away amen and let me see the light for this day you realize it was the setting of the sun amen when that cloud appeared it appeared wind at the setting of the sun i enjoyed that song and it was saying i didn't even know we were going to sing it tonight but man it was good and the setting of the sun and the setting of the sun the only thing that was still illuminated was that cloud and brother branham called that cloud a light so the only light left when the sun goes down on civilization in laodicea in the church ages the only light left is that cloud and that cloud is the headship that's in the bride and now that light is in you and i amen and the same thing that struck down paul is in you amen and i pray to god that it strikes down somebody else on the road and they say god what is that and it'll say this is me amen this is me in that person and this person and that person it's me paul in that bride praise god then somebody else will get caught up into the cloud i in you you and me where am i supposed to be in the cloud where's the cloud supposed to be in me when paul when when when brother branham got caught into the cloud he got raptured and if you're going to get called to the cloud you're going to get raptured lifted off the earth and off the cardinal and lifted into the heavenly realm so we can see what's going on all around us say god don't let me be an israelite standing the side of cyanide don't let me keep saying brother branham went to that cloud and brother branham got caught up in the constellation and brother branham got the revelation of the thunders and brother brandon preached the thunders and brother branham and brother branham and brother branham and brother branham what does that make us israelites paul brought us back to another mountain mount zion the heavenly city an innumerable company of angels he brought us but we got to go to the top of that mountain where the headstones come down and go into that cloud and let it thunder and lightning and quake and let the consuming fire burn all the world out and be united in a married union with him oh i want it more than anything in the world i want it for everybody more than anything in the world the church disappears but if you've been in that cloud everything's going to be fine everybody you love you and you love vanishes off the face of the earth if you've been in that cloud and that cloud is new everything will be fine because you've connected to the headship i and you you and me declaring they're all one where was the pillar of fire in paul's day and the believer where's the cloud today and the believer why because we've been caught into the cloud and the clouds come alive in us the only light left was that cloud and now that cloud that pillar of fire is in us and it's the only light left on this earth friends and it's veiled behind a veil of human flesh but let god rip the veil of our hearts so we can see it in the holy place before we close i want to look at two scriptures turn with me to revelation 21. there's a reason i want to look at this i want to show you the effect of going into that cloud revelations revelation 21 15. and he that talked with me had a golden read who was it that was talking to him who is me me is john john's a type of who the bride who's talking to john the angel which angel well let's go back to verse one or verse nine revelation 21 9. and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife this is one of the seven angels with the seven last plagues this happens to be the scripture brother branham used at the beginning of choosing of a bride this is the angel one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues that's the angel we're talking about he's the angel talking to john i don't believe that there's a bunch of different angels talking to john i think it's one angel that jesus christ sent and signified his revelation to by to his to john same angel all the way through verse 15 and he that talked with me had a golden read to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof and the city lies four square and the length is as large as the breath and he measured the city he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs the length and the breath and the height of it are equal and he measured the wall there of 144 cubits according to the measure of a man which is of the angel who in our day was an angel that gave us the dimensions of the city and the measurement of the city and the shape of the city the same angel that brought the revelation of jesus christ to john so we know who this is and he was given a golden read amen a golden read and speaking deity the pure word he was given a golden reed by which he could measure this city now go with me to revelation 11. revelation let's go to revelation 10. revelation 10 and 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets verse 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven spaking to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nations and tongues and kings now the question is where is the voice thou must prophesy again brother brenham said she will be the final voice to the final age his voice will be in the bride because we see it right here in the scriptures now let's go to chapter 11. and there was given me a read who's me john the bride now after she eats the book and becomes one with the word and is commanded to prophesy again now it says and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying arise and measure the temple of god what's the temple of god the dwelling place of god the only provided place of worship measure the temple of god in the altar where's the altar he had three the first one was in heaven then in christ and the third is in man and the altar and them that worship thereon the true worshipers but the courtroom which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall be tread underfoot forty in two months you realize friends something transitioned in revelation 10 8-11 that now the reed is not given to the seventh angel but the measuring reed has now been given to john and the angel tells john to take the reed and measure the temple and the altar and them that worship thereon because now the bride knows the proper place of worship and now she knows the truth and now she can take the word and she can measure out the proper place where the temple and the altar and them that worship there and she knows about the gentiles that will be on the outside do you understand friends you can keep saying brother brandon brother brandon brother ben and brother branham but god wants the bride to prophesy again god has given us the measuring tool god has said now now the angel says now you take the same tool and measure it out not a new word not new prophecies not new this but take the same thing that's been given amen and prophesy again take the same thing that's been given to us the angel showed us how to measure with this golden reed now there's a reed given to john that john can go and measure and when is he measuring he's measuring just before the two witnesses come on the scene see in order to do this we've got to get caught up into the mind of christ we've got to catch the same revelation brother branham caught you know the apostle paul preached what moses wrote is that right but the apostle paul didn't just come and read genesis chapter 1. we'll start at verse 1. we'll read to 27 close your book okay because i'm just going to preach what moses wrote that's right amen everything paul preached he caught by revelation of christ out in the wilderness for three and a half years and he come and he took that word and he placed it and he took the word and placed it and took the word and placed it and then brother branham comes along and he says i preached what paul preached but brother bram didn't come to the service one night and say okay open the book amen all right romans chapter one let's read through chapter 1. close the book let's go home because i only want to preach what paul preached do you understand what i'm saying he caught the revelation of what paul preached and when he caught the paul revelation he could preach everything paul preached and he could go into the old testament and pull out types that paul didn't talk about he could use scriptures that paul didn't use your scriptures that jesus didn't use paul could use scriptures that jesus didn't refer to why because it's one revelation one mystery one goal that god won't achieve in all of the bible amen and when we get caught up into the mind of christ and he reveals to us that one mystery that one goal that one purpose in a threefold manner then we can go back and we can see it here and here and here and here and here guess what brother branham never preached at a song of solomon are we allowed to work preach out a song of solomon how can we preach out a song of solomon because there's been given to you a read where do we get the read from the prophet and who told us to measure the angel brother brandon said if i preach this i'd go around and around that clock if i preach this i could preach a month of services on this and never touch it but when you go home you go study it and god will reveal it to you when god when when he opened the seals he tore open the whole bible the bible's loose to us and we've been given a read to measure it by and what's that read it's the message of the hour is the true interpretation of the word and how do you get it by getting caught up in a rapture into the mind of christ until he can reveal to you the threefold plan when you come down all of a sudden everything's different the veil is taken away from the heart and i see the word differently here in here and he keeps taking away the veil it keeps taking away the veil and we keep seeing christ more clearly than we've ever seen him before see going to the mountain was risky going to the cloud is risky but if we don't go we become a pharisee or a sadducee or a herodian because if we're not willing to go into that cloud and get a revelation of this mystery of god ourselves we'll gather safety quotes and safety scriptures and and hide behind the wall we built of our safety quotes and safety scriptures and will start to fight anybody else that contradicts our safety quotes or our safety scriptures what's the cure when you hear the trumpet go to the top of the mountain amen what's the cure get caught up into the heavenlies and into the mind of christ and say jesus christ reveal this message to me personally i don't want another quote book from a human being i don't want to just repeat my pastor i don't want to have to find the best church that teaches it just right so that i know i'm safe and will make it in the rapture friends god will never let there be a perfect church that always teaches it right he will allow error he will allow me to get it wrong just so you cannot rest i'm telling your friends this is why he uses human beings do you think me or any of the other brothers here are always going to say everything right i don't even reference the right scriptures and have you turned to the right place in the bible not not in preaching error that's not what we're talking about but you cannot say they got it right i'll go over here i'm right god's not going to let that happen friends he's going to make sure the only place of safety is in christ amen with the veil taken away with my own revelation so i see it myself well you know i'm not so sure about this i'm going to find another church and this church is right there's no right church god doesn't want a right church you see what i mean i don't mean every church is in error that's not what i'm talking about but god doesn't want the church to be so right you can't be wrong amen god will leave something there amen so that everybody's got to take the same journey and they've got to rapture off of this earth and out of their mind into the mind of christ and catch the revelation themselves and say i know the truth and i know who i am i know who christ is in this day and i'm not looking for safety quotes in a quote book and put together right and somebody else to put the puzzle together for me so that i can stand on the puzzle and say i got the picture what's going to happen if somebody comes along and shuffles your puzzle pieces up you got to go back to the same preacher put it together to you for you the first time to put it back together but if you ever catch the vision that's on the outside of the box if somebody comes and stirs up your puzzle you can put it back together yourself [Music] what about if somebody's preaching and they take your puzzle piece and say it goes right here and watch them while they're preaching just and you know it's not fitting i'm preaching to real people right and you're watching this guy he's preaching he's wiggling his puzzle feed back and forth and your heart's saying i know that'll fit there see when you've caught the vision yourself when you've seen the picture on the outside of the box you don't even get mad at that guy when he's done and he leaves you just go over and you pick up that piece and you put it over there why because you went the same place brother branham [Music] god's going to allow all of us to have different pictures in different places and different understanding of different quotes and different scriptures why so none of us lean on one another so that we all are required to take the same trip off the earth into the mind of christ to catch the revelation of the white stone so that we can come back down and everything's fine with me well i think it means that that's okay i'm fine with that i don't have to shoot you i don't have to be angry at you because you think this means that and you think this is that and this is time for this and not time that's fine but he showed me and this is the way i see it and i'm okay with that and i'm okay with the fact that he's still showing me and the picture keeps getting clear and clear and clear and i'm okay with that i'm okay with it getting clear for you and i'm okay with it getting clear for me why because i took my own trip to the top of the mountain i didn't have to come down and take moses's quote book and try my hardest to understand it and shoot everybody else who had a different understanding i went up there myself said oh now i know what moses is talking about paul went himself and when paul went himself he didn't need to be a pharisee of the pharisees anymore he didn't need to be taught in the best school of gamaliel to feel secure anymore he counted all of that as dung he cast it all behind him and he moved forward why because now he experienced the same thing moses experienced on the top of that mountain he met god himself and realized who he was in that day and he was able to throw away all the security of being a pharisee all the security of being taught by gamalia and now he had the security of the revelation of jesus christ in his day and if you want a security for the bride in this day her security is the revelation of jesus christ in this day and with that secure in our hearts everything else is fine i believe it this way that's okay brother do you see it that way i don't see it that way but that's okay because i'm so happy with what i see i don't need you to see what i see to make me happy i'm happy anyways do you understand what's the secret when you hear the long blast climb to the top of the mountain is it risky yeah you know why because you'll see something nobody else sees and you'll say something out of the word nobody else has ever said before and what's going to happen the first time you say something nobody else has said before a pharisee will pick up a rock and say that's not what brother branham taught trust me it'll happen i don't want to be a pharisee i don't want to be a sadducee i want to be a son of god who's made my own journey to the top of the mountain and went in the presence of the consuming fire and let him undress me and slay me and raise me back up and that he can give me the revelation that i need for the journey i'm in now and he can take the scripture and reveal it to me in a way that i've never heard anybody else talk about or anybody else teach about and i can be happy with that are you happy with that amen god bless you let's stand praise be to god musicians if you make your way up well i made a powerpoint we never got to it i like it that way i pray god made a power point in our hearts don't be afraid of revelation don't be afraid you know there's so much confusion out there they're saying this and they're saying this and they say the thunders mean this and somebody else says you know bright age or seven later seeing age and confusion confusion confusion i'll tell you the cure for the confusion get away from the base of the mountain and start climbing to the consuming fire get to the scary part where was it that moses went when he climbed that mountain when they said we can't go you go he went in to the blackness and darkness what is the blackness in darkness it's the deep mysteries of the word of god and everybody's so afraid that if you go into that blackness in darkness you'll lose your way but i'd like to say the only place to find your way is in the blackness and darkness of the mysteries of god that is where at the top of the mountain cloaked in darkness only the people who go to him see what's in the darkness we stay at the base we never see it what happens i saw somebody else go that way and they never come back what's that got to do with me they got off on this thing they got off on that tangent when you hear the long blast come up into the mountain we've heard the long blast of the seventh unders calling us up let's go up into him and let him take the veil off of our hearts and let our bibles keep becoming a new book let's pray lord jesus we thank you father god you know my heart you know all of our hearts you know our weaknesses and our failures god you know our desire to preach your word and the inability to actually get it out lord we just pray that that you would just take the perfection of your word and drive it into the hearts of your children god it may not be preached in perfection but the word is still perfect lord the vessel that shines the light it could be dirty it could be cracked and broken but the light is still pure god let the purity of the revelation of this light illuminate the hearts of your children lord that we would all look past the vessels and we would receive the light change us lord give us the courage to climb into the blackness and darkness to receive a revelation a true revelation of you burn us out lord help us to connect to you let us see for ourselves this revelation of the hour god anyone here lord who's longing to lift off of the earth and beyond the carnal anybody here who wants to get plum out of their knowing i pray god that you'd lift them up now lift them up into your very presence pull them right up into your own mind and reveal to them personally who you are in this hour take away all the scarecrows and all the scare that's out there so that we as your children have the freedom to go everywhere in the word that you want to lead us lord we love you we give you first place and preeminence among us have your way with us in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you just sing a song let your word let your word be born in the manger of my heart [Music] and
