[10:04] want to be faithful to you and we just
[10:06] pray you would help us gone
[10:08] we come to hear your word lord we pray
[10:10] you would feed us on your word that you
[10:12] give us ears to hear
[10:14] eyes to see in our heart to perceive all
[10:16] that you have for us this day may you
[10:18] lord break the bread of life and i pray
[10:20] you take this vessel under your control
[10:23] and take these lips lord and may you
[10:24] speak your word through them norm as we
[10:27] yield ourselves to you and ask that you
[10:29] would take preeminence in all of us for
[10:32] lord we love you we thank you god for
[10:34] the day that you've called us to live in
[10:36] we thank you for the word that you've
[10:37] given us in this day and may we be
[10:40] faithful to you and to your word lord we
[10:42] ask you to help us lord in jesus
[10:44] christ's name amen
[10:47] amen god bless you i want to say happy
[10:50] father's day to all the fathers out
[10:52] there it's a wonderful day father's day
[10:54] will never eclipse mother's day but it's
[10:56] a good day anyhow amen
[10:58] god bless you let's take our bibles and
[11:00] read while we're standing
[11:02] out of
[11:03] the gospel of john john chapter 1
[11:06] verse 1
[11:07] and then we'll read one verse of
[11:08] scripture and let you have your seats
[11:11] john chapter 1 verse 1.
[11:15] super familiar we could probably quote
[11:17] it but i like reading it together as a
[11:20] foundation for this thought
[11:22] it says that john 1 1 in the beginning
[11:24] was the word
[11:26] and the word was with god and the word
[11:28] was gone
[11:30] i think we could read that verse at the
[11:32] start of every
[11:34] service and still find something more in
[11:37] there because this is everything to us
[11:39] amen in the beginning was the word and
[11:42] the word was with god and the word was
[11:44] god god bless you as you have your seeds
[11:48] and i want to say as a father's day
[11:51] greeting i was thinking god didn't lay
[11:53] on my heart a father's day message he
[11:55] just
[11:56] laid something else on my heart so we
[11:58] always follow the leading of the spirit
[12:00] so we don't have christmas message at
[12:01] christmas and father's day messes and
[12:03] eastern message sometimes it works out
[12:05] that way and sometimes it doesn't but we
[12:07] have to follow inspiration but as i was
[12:09] thinking about the fathers and the men
[12:11] in the assembly and i just say thank god
[12:13] for you brothers
[12:15] that will lead your homes amen
[12:17] that is a very rare thing in the society
[12:20] the day and age that we live in to have
[12:22] men that will take leadership
[12:24] there's a lack of leadership all over
[12:26] the world there's lack of leadership in
[12:27] business lack of leadership and
[12:29] community lack of leadership in politics
[12:32] there seems to be no leadership anywhere
[12:35] and to find a man who will sacrifice
[12:37] himself and lay down his life and take
[12:39] the time to lead his wife and lead his
[12:41] family i say god bless you amen and it's
[12:43] wonderful to look around and see many
[12:45] that are like that not few and we know
[12:48] that's a product of the word amen it's
[12:50] not a product if we just well you just
[12:52] happen to be the best guys out there but
[12:54] we know that that's a life surrender to
[12:56] the word we'll bring the life of the
[12:58] word and the life of the word is true
[13:00] leadership because the word is our
[13:02] leader
[13:03] then we have a father so the father
[13:05] gives the word if we surrender to the
[13:07] word and god's called you to be a father
[13:09] then you'll reflect the attributes of
[13:11] father but i just want to say god bless
[13:13] you it's rare but we find it here amen
[13:17] in a minifold manifestation because of
[13:20] god's word and we're thankful for that
[13:23] amen so keep up the good work
[13:25] keep feeding on the word and letting god
[13:27] do the work through you
[13:29] amen i tell you when you have fathers
[13:31] who will lead homes it makes a pastor's
[13:32] job way easier
[13:34] when you have men who will step into
[13:35] position and take leadership take
[13:37] responsibility do the praying do the
[13:40] searching now you know sit down with the
[13:42] family give the godly instruction i tell
[13:44] you it makes a pastor's job much much
[13:47] easier to have daddy at the head of the
[13:49] home especially a spiritual daddy who
[13:51] loves the lord that'll put his his wings
[13:54] out his umbrella and bring all the
[13:55] family together under the umbrella of
[13:57] the word it's a wonderful place to be
[13:59] amen so i want to say i appreciate your
[14:01] brothers
[14:02] also i i said thank you on wednesday
[14:05] night for your prayers and support for
[14:06] angie and i when we we went on this
[14:09] anniversary trip we had a wonderful time
[14:11] and i just wanted to share his way of
[14:13] testimony
[14:15] we saw the hand of god in every turn on
[14:18] this trip and i was a bit surprised
[14:20] although i shouldn't have been but i was
[14:23] that god would so bless and so put his
[14:25] fingerprint on a trip to go rest
[14:29] i've seen him do it on trips to go
[14:30] minister all the time when we're going
[14:31] to minister we're going overseas we're
[14:33] traveling you see god work out
[14:35] circumstances he works out situations he
[14:37] makes it obvious he's with it but god
[14:40] did some of the the most vindication
[14:43] i've ever had on the trip was on this
[14:44] trip to go and rest
[14:46] and i say thank you god amen the prophet
[14:48] told us we need that it's something that
[14:50] he told us to do but i saw god vindicate
[14:53] it and for me it was a comfort i was
[14:55] able to go and relax because i felt like
[14:57] god was in it and so it was really good
[14:59] for me and we were able to completely
[15:01] disconnect and really relax and have a
[15:03] good time so i didn't even think about
[15:05] preaching
[15:07] the whole time
[15:08] so i come back and i was so thankful
[15:10] that we had wednesday night service
[15:12] covered so i didn't have to get into
[15:13] that mode already i could just come and
[15:15] enjoy the service with you all and so as
[15:17] i've been preparing over the last few
[15:18] days i was like boy i forgot how to
[15:20] preach amen i so disconnected i lost it
[15:23] all
[15:24] but praise be to god
[15:26] god is good amen i remember i was
[15:28] telling one of the brothers one time
[15:30] brother branham took three months off
[15:31] and preaching
[15:32] and he come back and he was saying you
[15:34] know preaching something you've got to
[15:35] stick with he goes i'm nervous
[15:37] i said i've taken two weeks off and i'm
[15:39] nervous amen
[15:40] but you just pull on the gift and we'll
[15:42] trust god amen god hasn't forgot how to
[15:45] deliver his word amen
[15:46] so i just i just say that was we were so
[15:49] relaxed and we just appreciated that
[15:51] time appreciate you guys were so
[15:52] supportive and so thoughtful and so kind
[15:54] and we appreciate that as well i also
[15:56] want to thank the ministers who
[15:57] ministered while we were gone we had a
[15:59] chance to catch up on all the services
[16:01] and we enjoyed them all it was a
[16:03] blessing to listen to him and so it did
[16:05] my heart good to hear the word
[16:07] and i had a this thought that's been on
[16:10] my heart i was ministering in this line
[16:12] before i left and some of the brothers
[16:14] even were picking it up in the same same
[16:16] vein and and this morning i just want to
[16:19] take a thought that i've been meditating
[16:21] on and preach on the value of the word
[16:24] so it's this is nothing nothing earth
[16:27] shattering nothing new but just
[16:29] something i've been dealing with and
[16:30] meditating for myself the value of the
[16:32] word i don't think we can put enough
[16:35] value on the word that's been given to
[16:37] us
[16:38] in fact i think we're constantly
[16:40] undervaluing not intentionally but just
[16:43] because we're carnal minded just because
[16:44] we're human beings we don't realize
[16:47] sometimes the the depth and the the
[16:49] breadth of what's been given to us we
[16:51] don't sometimes take into full account
[16:54] how powerful how wonderful how marvelous
[16:57] the gift that god has given to us in
[16:59] this end time by sending a prophet and
[17:01] restoring the word amen it wasn't a
[17:03] trivial thing it's not a light thing
[17:05] amen it is it is the thing that he's
[17:07] been waiting for for six thousand years
[17:10] amen and he's delivered the word to his
[17:12] bride and we could never be grateful
[17:15] enough amen we could never be reverent
[17:17] enough to the word we can never be
[17:19] humble enough before this word we can
[17:21] never be submissive enough to this word
[17:24] amen because it's everything to us
[17:27] so we know that in the beginning was the
[17:29] word amen so everything starts with the
[17:31] word amen
[17:33] you know god did not start he always was
[17:35] but but in the beginning was the word so
[17:38] god we know dwelt alone with his
[17:40] thoughts right
[17:42] and and we were part of those thoughts
[17:44] is that do you believe that
[17:46] we were part of his thinking but god did
[17:49] not want to dwell alone with his
[17:50] thoughts amen he wanted to come into a
[17:54] deeper fellowship with those thoughts
[17:56] amen and he wanted to come into i
[17:58] wouldn't say deeper i wanted to come
[17:59] into another form of fellowship to
[18:02] fellowship with his own attributes as a
[18:04] family and in order to do that he would
[18:06] take his thought he would begin to
[18:08] express it as word amen and so in the
[18:10] beginning was word and this became the
[18:13] expression of the thoughts of god and
[18:16] we're so thankful that god began to
[18:18] express amen because now he begins to
[18:20] share what's in his mind amen and god
[18:23] did that because he wants fellowship
[18:26] amen god did that because he wants to be
[18:28] known and he wants to have fellowship
[18:30] and because he wants to be known and he
[18:32] wants to have fellowship he began to
[18:34] express the word
[18:36] and the word is the thought expressed
[18:38] amen so god didn't want to just stay
[18:41] with thoughts with attributes within
[18:43] himself but he wanted to express those
[18:45] to be known and to have fellowship amen
[18:48] so god is still expressing his word
[18:51] because he wants to be known and he
[18:52] wants to have fellowship
[18:55] so god is using his word to bring us
[18:58] into fellowship with himself
[19:00] amen i want to look at a few scriptures
[19:03] let's go to first samuel chapter 3.
[19:12] first samuel chapter 3
[19:19] and
[19:20] i want to read verse 1.
[19:24] first samuel chapter 3 verse 1
[19:27] and the child samuel ministered unto the
[19:29] lord before eli and the word of the lord
[19:32] was precious in those days there was no
[19:34] open vision
[19:36] and this word precious means valuable
[19:40] prized weighty precious rare or splendid
[19:44] they lived in such a day samuel becomes
[19:47] the the first of the prophets that come
[19:49] on the break on the scene to bring
[19:51] further revelation of the word of god
[19:53] they had the law they've been operating
[19:55] through judges and now samuel comes to
[19:57] kick off the age of the prophets amen
[20:00] and
[20:01] and brother m tells us that the prophets
[20:02] built his body they begin to express the
[20:05] word which jesus christ is the word and
[20:07] it says in this day as samuel ministered
[20:10] as a child the the word of the lord was
[20:12] precious it was valuable it was rare it
[20:15] was weighty amen and it became a
[20:17] precious thing now that god would bring
[20:19] samuel on the scene to begin to bring
[20:21] the word of the lord and we lived in a
[20:24] day the generation passed amen and the
[20:27] generation that's out there not part of
[20:28] the bride but the generation that's out
[20:30] in laodicea is an absolute apostasy in
[20:34] darkness amen the word of god is rare
[20:36] out there
[20:38] we lived in a day where the word of god
[20:40] again had become rare because it was
[20:41] obscured by denominationalism and men's
[20:44] ideas and it had been discounted it had
[20:46] been chopped up it had been separated
[20:48] and divided amen and have been buried
[20:51] underneath the ideas of man and it
[20:53] become obscure amen and it and the once
[20:56] again the the word of god was precious
[20:58] amen it was rare it was valuable you
[21:00] couldn't find it everywhere and so god
[21:02] would raise on the scene again another
[21:04] prophet only this time it was a gentile
[21:06] prophet to come to a gentile bride amen
[21:09] to bring the word of god and it's a
[21:11] precious thing to us amen
[21:14] we don't take it lightly amen what
[21:16] separates us from the rest of the world
[21:18] that is stuck in apostasy and darkness
[21:20] is not our intelligence
[21:23] it's not our willpower it's not our
[21:25] moral character i mean none of that is
[21:27] what separates us the only thing that
[21:28] separates us is the word
[21:30] we have received the word and by
[21:32] receiving the word we receive the life
[21:34] of the word and the life of the word
[21:36] comes in to manifest the word and we've
[21:38] been separated by the precious word amen
[21:41] not not because we we got a better code
[21:44] of conduct
[21:45] a better code of conduct will do
[21:47] everything a code of conduct has done in
[21:48] the past it'll create legalism and it
[21:50] will fail
[21:52] but we've been separated by the word
[21:53] amen
[21:55] the word is precious to us
[21:57] let's go to psalms 107.
[22:00] this is a scripture that i read several
[22:01] weeks ago when i preached on spiritual
[22:03] cancer and i want to go back and and
[22:05] look at this
[22:08] scripture again
[22:17] psalms 107
[22:21] verse 17.
[22:27] it begins to say in verse 17 fools
[22:30] because of their transgression and
[22:31] because of their iniquities are
[22:33] afflicted
[22:34] so why are they afflicted
[22:36] because of transgressions and iniquities
[22:39] transgressions are doing something
[22:40] against the word
[22:42] and iniquities is not doing something
[22:44] you know to do is right or doing
[22:46] something you know is not right so
[22:48] because of their transgressions
[22:50] because of their transgressions and
[22:51] because of their iniquities they are
[22:53] afflicted
[22:55] their soul aborts all manner of meat and
[22:57] they draw near unto the gates of death
[22:59] they cry unto the lord in their trouble
[23:01] and he saveth them out of their
[23:03] distresses he sent his word and healed
[23:05] them and delivered them from their
[23:07] destructions
[23:09] all that men would praise the lord for
[23:11] his goodness and for his wonderful works
[23:13] to the children of men
[23:15] and let them sacrifice the sacrifice of
[23:17] thanksgiving and declare his works with
[23:20] rejoicing
[23:22] amen he sent his word and healed them
[23:25] they were stuck they were afflicted
[23:27] because of transgressions and iniquities
[23:29] and in their trouble that they created
[23:31] themselves they cried out to him and
[23:34] what was the delivering for us what did
[23:35] he do to deliver them he sent his word
[23:39] he sent his word to deliver he sent his
[23:40] word to heal he sent his word to bring
[23:42] them out they brought themselves in but
[23:45] he sent the word to bring them out amen
[23:48] and this laodicean condition when when
[23:50] we find christ on the outside amen and
[23:53] then total darkness everywhere amen that
[23:56] was created because of transgressions
[23:58] and iniquities amen but there was a cry
[24:00] and he heard the cry and he sent his
[24:02] word amen and he healed us and delivered
[24:05] us from all
[24:07] our destructions
[24:09] brother graham says god must bring
[24:12] judgment upon the earth this is in the
[24:14] message to trial and god has to have
[24:16] something here a standard to judge the
[24:18] world by because it would be unjust in
[24:21] god to judge the world and the world
[24:23] knowing no standard to go by how many
[24:26] believes that's true if the church is
[24:27] the standard which one is it
[24:30] the word god said he would judge the
[24:32] world by jesus christ he is the word in
[24:35] the beginning was the word the word was
[24:36] with god the word was god the word was
[24:38] made flesh and dwelt among us the same
[24:40] yesterday today and forever so he's got
[24:43] to judge the world by something so he
[24:44] judges the world by his word amen and
[24:47] that was what came forth in the
[24:48] beginning and that is everything amen
[24:51] everything consists of the word
[24:54] right everything was made by the word
[24:56] because it says amen in jesus christ all
[24:58] things were made by him and for him and
[25:00] without him was not anything that was
[25:02] made that was made whether there be
[25:04] principalities or thrones and heavenly
[25:05] places on earth everything that was made
[25:07] was made by the word amen
[25:10] and so and he can in all the world
[25:12] everything consists of the world
[25:14] everything is by the word everything is
[25:16] for the word everything and consists by
[25:18] the word amen so the word is everything
[25:20] and god will judge the world by this
[25:22] word
[25:24] amen
[25:27] romans 2 16 says in the day when god
[25:29] shall judge the secrets of men by jesus
[25:31] christ according to my gospel brother is
[25:33] going to refer to this scripture in the
[25:35] day that god shall judge the secrets of
[25:37] men by jesus christ according to my
[25:40] gospel paul's saying he's going to judge
[25:42] all men and the secrets of men by jesus
[25:44] christ
[25:46] and and hebrews 4 12 says the word of
[25:48] god is quick
[25:50] powerful sharper than any two-edged
[25:52] sword piercing even to the dividing
[25:55] asunder of soul and spirit
[25:57] and the joints in the morrow and is a
[25:59] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[26:01] the heart
[26:02] so what is the discerner
[26:04] the word
[26:06] what is the world judged by the word
[26:09] he's going to judge the secrets amen the
[26:12] secrets of men by jesus christ and
[26:14] brother branham tells us in sirs we
[26:16] would see jesus but he said he would
[26:18] judge the world by jesus christ and
[26:21] jesus christ is the word
[26:23] so he'll judge the world by the word now
[26:25] the bible is the entire revelation of
[26:28] jesus christ this is the revelation
[26:30] nothing is to be added to it or taken
[26:32] from it the same will take in our part
[26:34] from the book of life if we add to if we
[26:37] add or take take from it that is the
[26:40] word of god and we believe it so he said
[26:42] he said he would judge the world by
[26:43] jesus christ he's going to judge the
[26:45] secrets of men by jesus christ but jesus
[26:48] christ is the word amen so he will judge
[26:50] the secrets of men by the word and the
[26:53] word is sharper quicker than the
[26:55] two-edged sword dividing to the morrow
[26:58] and the bone and the soul and the spirit
[27:00] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[27:01] intents of the heart and so we saw amen
[27:04] we saw discernment in our day through
[27:06] the ministry of william branham he could
[27:08] give discernment and discern your
[27:10] problem and discern what was going on in
[27:12] your life your sickness and what you've
[27:14] been through and what you should have
[27:15] done or didn't do amen but the word is a
[27:18] discerner the word is the true discerner
[27:20] amen the word is what the world is
[27:22] judged by the word is what the secrets
[27:24] of men is judged by the word is what
[27:27] comes down and separates the soul and
[27:29] the spirit which even when you read
[27:31] through the scriptures it is so hard
[27:32] sometimes in the scriptures to separate
[27:34] the soul and the spirit of man they're
[27:36] so close together but this word will
[27:38] come and divide it
[27:41] amen why because the word exposes
[27:43] everything because the word made
[27:45] everything everything consists by the
[27:47] word and the word discerns everything
[27:50] friends
[27:51] you say how is that possible amen
[27:54] because god amen in our day has restored
[27:56] his word and he's given the word amen
[27:59] and any deviation from that word is a
[28:01] discernment of where your heart is
[28:04] amen if we in any way in any phase are
[28:08] able to take a portion of the message
[28:10] and manipulate it to our own purpose
[28:13] amen or massage it to our own discretion
[28:16] for our own benefit or our own lust our
[28:18] own desires amen be rest assured that
[28:21] that word that was preached was
[28:22] discerning our hearts right there
[28:25] because the question is will he have
[28:27] preeminence that's the question in this
[28:28] day amen will will there be a people
[28:31] that he can unfold the second portion of
[28:34] his threefold plan the second fold is to
[28:36] have preeminence in the people and he's
[28:38] wanting to accomplish that now and
[28:40] preeminence is full control absolute
[28:42] submission to the word
[28:45] so that word is judging us friends that
[28:48] word is discerning us amen we don't need
[28:51] a man to stand in the pulpit amen and
[28:53] bring down discernment and say you did
[28:55] this and you did that you did this what
[28:57] we need is the holy ghost to break the
[28:59] word amen and the word will discern
[29:01] where our heart is
[29:04] if we have any desire to anything other
[29:06] than the message we're being discerned
[29:08] right then
[29:10] is that right
[29:12] if the word is being preached and it's
[29:14] true amen and the word is true and it's
[29:16] coming from the scriptures amen and it's
[29:18] something that the prophet is taught
[29:20] amen and something rises up in us to
[29:23] discredit that amen that word is
[29:25] discerning right there the secrets of
[29:26] men's hearts
[29:28] amen when when
[29:30] when adam and eve were placed here adam
[29:32] and his bride were placed here they were
[29:34] given the word
[29:36] so they were to stand by the word and
[29:39] that word is jesus christ
[29:42] what was it they were given for their
[29:44] protection in the garden of eden jesus
[29:46] christ
[29:48] what were they given they were given the
[29:50] word
[29:51] they were given christ the word and they
[29:53] were told to stand with this word
[29:56] right and if they would have stayed with
[29:58] christ everything would have continued
[30:00] on as god had said it because god had
[30:02] made the world by christ god had
[30:05] established eden by christ
[30:07] he was operating by christ the word and
[30:09] now he was given christ the word to them
[30:11] to keep them protected and in a state of
[30:15] christ of the word of harmony all the
[30:17] time amen but eve because of her own
[30:20] lust that had rose up through an
[30:22] enticement by the serpent amen she
[30:25] deviated from the word was she deceived
[30:27] yes she was deceived but she was
[30:29] deceived because she was enticed of her
[30:31] own lusts
[30:33] and she began to deviate from the
[30:35] commandment and when she deviated from
[30:37] the commandment she was discerned and
[30:39] she was judged
[30:41] judgment came because she left the word
[30:46] discernment came because she left the
[30:48] word amen if she would have stayed with
[30:51] the word everything would have been fine
[30:54] but leaving the word brought the
[30:56] judgments of god amen because because
[30:58] god will judge the world by the word and
[31:00] that's exactly what he did in eden he
[31:02] set the pattern for the rest of the
[31:04] creation for the rest of the world and
[31:06] for the rest of time amen he said it and
[31:08] established it in eden he gave them
[31:10] christ the word they were living in
[31:13] christ the word amen they were they were
[31:15] upheld by christ the word and they'd
[31:17] been made by christ the word they were
[31:19] living in christ the word
[31:21] they were protected by christ the word
[31:23] and when they left christ the word
[31:26] judgment came
[31:28] and when they left christ the word death
[31:30] set in
[31:32] so we start talking about the value of
[31:34] the word amen when i say i don't think
[31:36] we can appreciate it enough the word
[31:39] that god gave them wasn't complex
[31:42] they said don't partake of this tree you
[31:46] may partake of all the other trees but
[31:48] don't partake of this tree
[31:50] it wasn't complicated it wasn't complex
[31:53] but all the value of that commandment
[31:56] the value of that word that simple
[31:59] phrase that simple commandment that
[32:01] wasn't hard to understand it wasn't
[32:03] complex it wasn't complicated it was
[32:06] simple it was straightforward but all
[32:08] the value of that word the value of that
[32:11] word would have kept them in eternal
[32:13] bliss forever amen the value of that
[32:15] word would have kept an eaten condition
[32:17] on the earth perpetually forever there
[32:20] would have been no death there would
[32:21] have been no heartache there would have
[32:22] been no suffering there would have been
[32:23] nothing if they would have stayed with
[32:25] that simple word that simple phrase
[32:29] of all the trees in the garden i'm gonna
[32:30] protect but the tree of the knowledge of
[32:32] good and evil in the midst of the garden
[32:33] thou shalt not not not eat of that tree
[32:37] if they would have stayed it's so simple
[32:39] it wasn't hard it wasn't complicated
[32:41] amen but what happened is the serpent
[32:43] came down and began to attach reasoning
[32:45] to the word and he made it complicated
[32:48] he made it does it really mean this or
[32:49] does it really mean that and it's it's
[32:52] it may not be what i thought it was and
[32:54] blah blah blah blah blah and he took
[32:56] what was simple and made it complex
[33:00] and with that he began to beguile the
[33:02] woman by bringing up her lust that were
[33:05] inside of her and by her lust she was
[33:07] led away by her lust she was deceived
[33:09] and then all of a sudden she wanted she
[33:12] began to want a deviation from the word
[33:16] because of the lust that rose up
[33:19] it became an attractive offer
[33:22] it became something that she desired and
[33:24] now she had a desire to something other
[33:27] than christ
[33:32] praise god
[33:33] i just want to set before you
[33:36] the statement that nothing has changed
[33:38] from that day to this
[33:41] it's the same exact thing we face today
[33:46] god has given us his word
[33:49] god has
[33:50] he has been so kind to us because of the
[33:53] deception that was here at the end time
[33:55] because of thousands of years of
[33:57] denominationalism that started with the
[33:59] harlot and then the daughters he
[34:01] was so kind to us that he would give
[34:03] such a display of his power touch the
[34:06] display of his discernment that it would
[34:08] be so it would be so easily recognized
[34:11] that this is a prophet of god amen this
[34:13] is god's mouthpiece and he would begin
[34:14] to open the word in such a way it became
[34:17] undeniable to us that was god's mercy
[34:19] that was god's grace the thousands upon
[34:22] thousands of times amen that there would
[34:24] be healings and miracles blind eyes open
[34:27] lame walking dead rays dumb speaking
[34:30] amen and recorded by doctors recorded in
[34:33] papers recorded on film recorded on tape
[34:35] amen with multitudes of eyewitness
[34:38] testimonies that was god's absolute
[34:40] grace and love to you and i amen and to
[34:43] take that message and begin to
[34:44] manipulate that message and say well
[34:46] that was his opinion or this means that
[34:48] and i'm going to i'm going to timber i
[34:50] think it's an absolute disgrace to the
[34:52] power that god has displayed in this age
[34:56] i think it's one of the most
[34:57] disrespectful things that we could ever
[34:59] do to god
[35:02] amen
[35:04] and i just like to say
[35:06] that word is still discerning us
[35:10] that word is discerning our hearts
[35:14] you know
[35:14] we don't come to service to to find out
[35:17] how good we are
[35:20] we come to service to find out where the
[35:22] devil's still working on us
[35:26] so that that deception can be nipped in
[35:28] the bud by the word
[35:32] brother brahm said in the end time
[35:34] evangelism so you see christianity is an
[35:36] important thing
[35:38] if it cost all this six thousand years
[35:40] of trouble because of one word being
[35:42] misused
[35:44] now we're not going back with one other
[35:46] word misused
[35:48] it's got to be exactly with the word
[35:50] with nobody's interpretation just what
[35:52] the word says
[35:55] i
[35:56] say
[35:58] what is the value of the word
[36:02] if it was
[36:03] the word that kept eden in a perpetual
[36:06] state of perfection
[36:08] do you believe that it was the word
[36:11] it was established by the word of god
[36:14] it was
[36:15] they were dwelling in the word of god by
[36:18] the word of god for the word of god and
[36:20] they were given the word of god to keep
[36:23] it in that state
[36:25] so everything in eden was the word of
[36:27] god
[36:31] and a slight deviation
[36:34] from one simple commandment
[36:36] brought death
[36:37] and a ruination of everything that god
[36:40] had established in eden become into a
[36:42] fallen condition
[36:44] that's the power
[36:46] amen of
[36:47] undervaluing god's word
[36:50] devaluing or undervaluing god's word it
[36:54] brought that kind of destruction that
[36:56] kind of death and we're still suffering
[36:58] today because of that undervaluing of
[37:01] god's word
[37:02] that deviation from god's word
[37:04] everything we suffer with today is
[37:05] because of that
[37:07] do you agree
[37:09] everything we're suffering with is
[37:11] because of not valuing the word of god
[37:13] correctly in the beginning
[37:16] so god now he's working to reestablish
[37:19] his eden upon the earth and you have to
[37:21] ask yourself by what method will he
[37:23] reestablish to eden amen the only thing
[37:26] he can do is bring back what was lost
[37:28] and what was lost was the word amen so
[37:30] he must bring back the word but there
[37:32] has to be a people that will stay with
[37:35] the word in order to bring back an eaten
[37:37] condition
[37:39] because if god will reestablish eden
[37:42] upon the earth and by his spoken word if
[37:45] he will set everything in order again as
[37:47] it was amen and he will establish the
[37:50] nature as it was the earth the cosmos if
[37:53] he will put everything back the way it
[37:55] was but he will put you and i in there
[37:57] without an absolute preeminence among us
[38:00] then he's going to start the cycle right
[38:02] back over again because we'll leave the
[38:03] word and bring eden into a fallen
[38:05] condition
[38:06] so before he can do that he's got to
[38:09] bring the word back and give a word test
[38:11] to a people amen that'll stay true to
[38:14] that word regardless of anything else
[38:16] there's got to be a people who will
[38:18] value that word over their existence
[38:22] because they're not there's no coming
[38:24] back to eden until there's a people that
[38:26] are ready for eden a people who can
[38:28] dwell in eden a people who can stay with
[38:31] the word at all costs
[38:36] that's why the prophet came
[38:39] to give the ingredients for that kind of
[38:41] people
[38:43] amen until we become that kind of people
[38:46] we should stop looking for eden
[38:52] amen
[38:54] amen
[38:56] brother rem said in christ is the
[38:57] mystery of god revealed he says when eve
[38:59] went away from the word she went away
[39:01] from her mate
[39:04] and when the church goes away from the
[39:05] word to a denomination she rejects and
[39:08] commits fornication with the world of
[39:10] man's wisdom
[39:12] rejecting the authority of god's word
[39:16] i'd like to say
[39:18] when he says
[39:20] the church goes away from the word to a
[39:21] denomination
[39:23] don't let that in your mind
[39:26] fall somewhere else
[39:28] because that denominational spirit is
[39:30] the one pressing upon you
[39:32] the denominational spirit is the one
[39:34] that will take your own idea and your
[39:36] own desire amen and massage the word to
[39:39] match your own desire that's the
[39:40] denominational spirit and it's not far
[39:43] from any of us
[39:45] so we can't say well i left the
[39:46] denominations years ago the
[39:48] denominational spirit is the antichrist
[39:50] spirit and it's all around you amen
[39:53] it's working on your hybrid flesh all
[39:55] the time trying to find inroads back to
[39:58] bring
[39:59] all all that the denominational spirit
[40:01] is trying to do is to get you to
[40:02] hybridize the word and if you can
[40:04] hybridize the word then there's no eden
[40:06] coming back there's no destruction of
[40:08] satan's eden amen he sits as a squatter
[40:10] with squatters right and stays in
[40:12] position of creation
[40:14] so that spirit don't say you know uh as
[40:17] long as you
[40:18] leave the word
[40:20] or you go away from the word to a
[40:21] denomination if you go away from the
[40:23] word to your own desire that's a
[40:26] denominational spirit
[40:28] if you deviate ever so slightly from the
[40:30] word for something you want or something
[40:33] you think or some some reasoning that's
[40:35] come from your own mind that's a
[40:37] denominational spirit
[40:41] and so when we do that
[40:44] we reject and commit fornication with
[40:46] the world of man's wisdom even if it's
[40:48] your own
[40:51] rejecting the authority of god's word
[40:56] brother ben says in the church age book
[40:58] in the pergamum church age
[41:00] on page 171
[41:02] he says the son the second son jesus
[41:06] also a spoken word seed word of god
[41:09] was given a bride like was adam but
[41:11] before he could marry her she also had
[41:13] fallen she like adam's wife was put to
[41:16] the test whether she would believe the
[41:17] word of god and live or doubt the word
[41:19] and die
[41:20] she doubted she left the word she died
[41:24] he's talking about the first church
[41:27] she was put to the word test she was
[41:29] given the word she doubted she left the
[41:32] word she died
[41:34] but there's got to come a bride that
[41:36] won't fall by the same thing the
[41:39] previous ones did
[41:41] amen and
[41:43] as we talk about these things and
[41:45] discuss them i can never get away from
[41:47] the fact that i hold it always before my
[41:49] mind that brother benham said this bride
[41:51] won't fall she's predestinated not to
[41:55] oh that's the statement friends that's
[41:57] it that's what gives us courage that's
[41:59] what gives it hope not by my nor by
[42:01] power but by his spirits by my spirit
[42:03] saith the lord it's not me it's his will
[42:06] it's his purpose his plan but i know
[42:08] amen where the deception lies and i know
[42:11] amen how deceiving that spirit is and i
[42:13] know how weak my flesh is and this is
[42:15] what i have to guard against he's
[42:17] promised that there'll be a bride who
[42:18] won't fall and i believe i'm part of
[42:20] that and it's going to be his spirit but
[42:22] oh i don't want to be childish in my
[42:24] ways i don't want to be foolish in my
[42:26] actions amen i want to stay in this word
[42:29] with all that's in me and knowing with
[42:30] all that's in me i'll still fail but
[42:32] he's here to make up the uh the
[42:34] difference amen
[42:38] in the
[42:38] in the church age book again this is
[42:40] further
[42:41] further down to the pyramid church age
[42:43] actually this is the previous statement
[42:45] the evidence of receiving the holy ghost
[42:47] today is just the same as it was back in
[42:49] the day of our lord
[42:50] it is receiving the word of truth for
[42:52] the day in which you live
[42:54] jesus never did stress the importance of
[42:56] works as he did the word he knew that if
[42:59] people got the word the works would
[43:01] follow
[43:02] that is bible
[43:05] i say praise god
[43:08] we've been given the word we need to do
[43:10] the works of god
[43:13] amen so
[43:15] that's why we don't need to chase after
[43:18] works
[43:19] amen we need to chase after the word and
[43:21] the word will produce the works
[43:24] we don't need to go after works or
[43:27] manifestations or things as a
[43:29] vindication the word will vindicate
[43:31] itself amen that's not my vindication my
[43:34] vindication is my faith in the word amen
[43:37] my ability to receive believe and act
[43:39] upon the word of god amen that's what
[43:42] vindicates me as the son of god and then
[43:44] the word vindicates itself through the
[43:46] works
[43:47] so i must be pursuing after the word
[43:52] he goes on saying now jesus knew that
[43:54] there was going to be a terrible drift
[43:56] away from the word
[43:58] and the pergamian age which was
[44:00] yet 200 years off from the patmos vision
[44:04] he knew the driftwood caused them to go
[44:06] into the dark ages he knew that the way
[44:09] man originally got away from god was by
[44:11] first leaving the word
[44:14] if you leave the word you have left god
[44:19] amen what a statement
[44:21] when eve left the word she left her mate
[44:25] when the first church left the word amen
[44:28] they left christ
[44:30] if you leave the word you've left god
[44:34] thus he is presenting himself to the
[44:35] church at pergamus and indeed to all
[44:37] churches of all ages i am the word if
[44:40] you want deity in your
[44:42] in your midst then welcome and receive
[44:45] the word
[44:47] don't ever let anything don't notice the
[44:50] statement don't ever let anyone
[44:53] or anything get between you and that
[44:56] word
[44:58] this which i am giving you the word is a
[45:00] revelation of myself i am the word
[45:03] remember that
[45:05] then then the next statement that
[45:06] brother bannon says is one that's been
[45:08] ringing in my ears
[45:10] i wonder if we are sufficiently
[45:12] impressed with the word in our midst
[45:15] this is the one that's been rattling
[45:17] around in my mind in my spirit
[45:20] i wonder if we are sufficiently
[45:22] impressed with the word in our midst
[45:25] we say we have the restored word but are
[45:27] we sufficiently impressed with the
[45:29] restored word
[45:31] do we value how do we value the restored
[45:34] word how much do we value the message
[45:37] amen not not to say i'm in the message
[45:39] or i believe the message but how much do
[45:41] we value the word that has come back
[45:44] amen
[45:46] amen
[45:47] we can
[45:48] we can in ourselves we can view the
[45:50] message as any other movement or any
[45:52] other uh uh revival or anything like
[45:55] that but but the message is christ the
[45:58] word that has come back to the people
[46:01] how much do we value the restoration of
[46:03] the word
[46:05] amen
[46:07] i wonder if we are sufficiently
[46:09] impressed
[46:11] with the word in our midst
[46:13] and he goes on to give an example he
[46:15] says let me give you a thought here
[46:17] how do we pray we pray in jesus name
[46:20] don't we every prayer is in his name or
[46:22] there isn't any answer
[46:24] yet in first john 5 14 we are told this
[46:27] is the confidence that we have in him
[46:30] that if we ask anything according to his
[46:32] will he heareth us and if we know that
[46:35] he hear us whatsoever we ask we know
[46:37] that we have the petitions that we
[46:39] desire of him
[46:41] so the state the scripture was that
[46:44] this is the comment that we have in him
[46:45] if we have anything if we ask anything
[46:47] according to his will he heareth us
[46:51] and then brother brahm says now we ask
[46:53] what is the will of god there is only
[46:57] one way to know
[46:58] his will and that is by the word of god
[47:02] so the word is his will how do you pray
[47:05] his will pray the word
[47:08] and if we ask according to his will then
[47:10] he heareth us and if he hears us we have
[47:11] this confidence that he hears us and
[47:12] will answer
[47:14] how do we know that our answer because
[47:15] we asked according to the word
[47:18] then he goes on the lamentations 3 37
[47:21] who is he that saith and it cometh to
[47:23] pass when the lord commandeth it not
[47:26] there it is if it isn't in the word you
[47:29] can't have it
[47:30] so we can't ask unless it's in the word
[47:33] and we can't petition or ask unless it's
[47:35] in his name there it is again
[47:38] jesus the name
[47:40] is the word his will
[47:43] so what's his name the word what's his
[47:46] will the word jesus his name
[47:49] is the word his will
[47:51] so when you ask in his will you ask in
[47:53] his name
[47:55] how do you know it's his will because of
[47:57] the word
[47:58] i'm asking according to the word
[48:01] it says you can't separate god in the
[48:03] word they
[48:04] are
[48:05] one
[48:07] amen that's why i
[48:10] i keep coming back to this
[48:13] question this statement what is the
[48:15] value of the word
[48:17] and the more i i look and meditate on
[48:20] this i i ask are we sufficiently
[48:22] impressed with the word that is in our
[48:24] midst i say we're impressed amen
[48:26] sometimes i feel sufficiently impressed
[48:29] but brother ben asked the question are
[48:31] we sufficiently impressed with the word
[48:33] that's in our midst because the word has
[48:35] brought back every it's brought back the
[48:37] potential of everything to us this word
[48:40] has brought back the potential of eden
[48:42] amen it's brought back the potential for
[48:44] everything we've lost this word has
[48:46] brought back and put within our grasp
[48:48] everything that has ever been taken away
[48:50] from us
[48:52] it's brought back in our fingertips
[48:54] within our reach it's brought back
[48:56] everything that man lost it's brought
[48:58] back the potential for a reversing of
[49:01] hybridization it's brought back amen
[49:03] this word is bringing back a faith
[49:05] that'll bring a rapture that'll change
[49:07] these atoms and change this body and
[49:09] glorify this physical body what's done
[49:12] it it's the word amen
[49:15] amen it's not fairy dust it's not a
[49:18] magic potion amen god brought back the
[49:21] word because there has to be a faith
[49:23] that's restored because the rapture is a
[49:25] revelation to the bride it's going to
[49:27] come as a revelation of the word
[49:32] praise be to god
[49:34] jesus made a simple statement in john 14
[49:37] 15.
[49:38] it's simple and i've passed over so many
[49:41] times reading it and we know it i mean
[49:43] it's probably a sunday school verse we
[49:44] learned years ago it says if you love me
[49:48] keep my commandments
[49:52] if you love me
[49:53] keep my commandments
[49:56] and in this statement we've seen the
[49:58] fallacy
[50:00] of the majority of christendom
[50:03] because every sunday saturday sunday or
[50:06] whatever day they worship they stand up
[50:08] and sing about how they're in love and a
[50:10] love affair with jesus christ and their
[50:12] songs have become so sensual and so
[50:14] saucy about this great love between
[50:17] jesus and themselves and the whole time
[50:20] they're trampling over all of his
[50:21] commandments
[50:24] amen not dressing like a woman not
[50:26] dressing like a man reversing the roles
[50:28] allowing women preachers baptizing in
[50:30] titles amen taking a tongue's initial
[50:33] evidence i mean on and on and on and on
[50:36] we can list the transgressions of his
[50:38] commandments and he says if you love me
[50:40] keep my commandments
[50:43] and it doesn't matter amen you're going
[50:45] to a denominational church amen and the
[50:48] songs are so emotionally charged about a
[50:52] love affair between jesus and i and i'm
[50:54] caught up and i'm swept away and your
[50:57] love is this and i mean it it is so
[51:00] saucy i mean
[51:04] but it's not true
[51:07] it's a lie
[51:09] it feels good it has a lot of emotion
[51:12] that goes with it and it's all about
[51:14] being swept away by his love and caught
[51:16] up in his embrace and so carried away in
[51:19] his love and this and that and that and
[51:21] don't have the simple audacity for a
[51:23] woman to put on a dress and let her hair
[51:25] grow long and says she loves jesus
[51:27] christ jesus says you don't
[51:32] is that right
[51:37] and we must be careful too that we don't
[51:39] take jesus commandments and
[51:42] limit them to the four gospels
[51:45] because the apostle paul came along and
[51:47] he gave some instructions to the church
[51:49] and he says if there's any spiritual
[51:51] among you who acknowledge that the
[51:52] things that i write unto you they are
[51:54] the commandments of the lord
[51:58] who's the lord jesus jesus if you let me
[52:00] keep my commandments paul says if you're
[52:02] spiritual you acknowledge that the
[52:04] things that i write unto you
[52:06] they are the commandments of the lord
[52:08] so that makes the preaching of paul the
[52:11] preaching of jesus
[52:13] makes it his commandments
[52:15] and i say the same thing in our day god
[52:17] has sent a servant in our day that
[52:19] represents himself amen and those
[52:21] commandments they're not brother
[52:22] brenham's ideas amen i believe they're
[52:24] the commandments of the lord
[52:29] but so many times people trivialize them
[52:31] and marginalize them as an opinion or or
[52:34] or that's not in the word or or this or
[52:37] that or
[52:40] so then you're saying that brother
[52:41] bannon was teaching the church things
[52:42] that aren't in the word
[52:47] so what kind of prophet do we have
[52:49] that'll give instruction to the church
[52:51] that's not part of the word
[52:56] when brother branham teaches us on
[52:58] marriage and divorce when he teaches us
[52:59] on interracial marriage when he teaches
[53:02] us on morality when he teaches us on
[53:04] dress when he teaches us on all of that
[53:06] if that's just his opinion and not the
[53:08] word then we have a prophet that'll put
[53:10] his opinion over the word
[53:14] we can leave it in denominations but
[53:17] but there's got to be a reality
[53:19] that says you know what
[53:21] i value what god has done in this age
[53:24] more than my own opinion
[53:26] i value it more than anything else and
[53:29] god help me where i've devalued it god
[53:31] help me where i've taken my own
[53:33] reasoning amen and sometimes we do it
[53:35] for years and we don't recognize it but
[53:37] all of a sudden the light bulb goes off
[53:38] and you say
[53:39] i've been trivializing that commandment
[53:42] i've taken it and marginalized it and
[53:44] i've taken it as the prophet's opinion
[53:46] or i've taken it this or i've taken it
[53:48] there and god forgive me for devaluing
[53:50] what you've done in this day
[53:53] you send a major prophet that can tap
[53:55] into the back part of your mind
[53:59] i mean you realize the places that the
[54:01] prophet of god has been
[54:04] he has been to the back part of god's
[54:06] mind to receive the mystery that's been
[54:08] hidden there from before the foundation
[54:10] of the world and he comes down and he's
[54:12] able to deliver the mystery that's been
[54:15] locked in the thoughts of jesus and the
[54:17] thoughts of god himself from before
[54:20] the beginning
[54:25] and this man doesn't have the
[54:26] credentials to tell me how to live my
[54:28] life
[54:30] what god wants what the nature of god is
[54:32] like what is appropriate inappropriate
[54:34] to please god i would say the man who
[54:37] has journeyed to the back part of the
[54:38] mind knows more about the nature of god
[54:41] than i and my trivial mind knows amen
[54:43] and i don't want to devalue what god has
[54:45] done in this day i want to surrender my
[54:47] whole life to it and say god hey you
[54:50] know what you say what if brother
[54:51] brennan was wrong what if he was wrong
[54:53] it's not my vindication that vindicated
[54:55] him it was god's vindication that
[54:56] vindicated him in a way that was far
[54:58] beyond anything that anybody could ever
[55:00] do or produce or do on their own amen
[55:04] god's the one who backed up what that
[55:05] prophet said god's the one who kept him
[55:07] on the straightener god's the one who
[55:09] corrected him when he was wrong and
[55:10] god's the one who had him come to the
[55:12] pulpit and rectify it
[55:14] so so i'm fine with that
[55:18] i'm comfortable with that if god was
[55:20] comfortable with it i'm comfortable with
[55:21] it amen if brother branham taught it and
[55:23] god didn't correct him i'm comfortable
[55:25] with it i'm comfortable enough to say
[55:27] amen anyway if we show up to heaven and
[55:30] we're standing there and says why did
[55:32] you do this and why did you do that i
[55:35] can say because your prophet said on
[55:37] such and such a tape this was the right
[55:39] way to do it
[55:42] because then it's not my fault anymore
[55:45] [Applause]
[55:46] do you understand that
[55:49] then i'm valuing what god has done
[55:52] i'm putting value where god put value
[55:57] and say
[55:58] you you realize that
[56:00] if we begin to marginalize statements
[56:04] and trivialize them and try to do our
[56:06] own placing
[56:08] and what was opinion and there's
[56:10] sometimes brother bam said no this is
[56:12] just my opinion that's fine that's his
[56:14] opinion he said it was
[56:17] but when other statements we try to
[56:19] marginalize and trivialize and make room
[56:22] for some of our own desires
[56:27] i said god help us never to do that
[56:29] again
[56:31] help me god to realize
[56:33] who you sent why you sent them what his
[56:36] message was what his ministry was for
[56:39] and that you called me under that
[56:41] message
[56:43] under that messenger under this message
[56:45] that's where you called me and that's my
[56:47] position
[56:49] and under the messenger we become the
[56:52] final voice to the final age
[56:54] under the messenger
[56:57] that's where god called me and i'm
[56:59] comfortable there
[57:00] god help me be more comfortable there
[57:03] that's my prayer
[57:04] i said god i
[57:06] i want to die to all my own desires and
[57:10] that's a much that's a simple statement
[57:12] to make but that's a hard thing to
[57:13] produce in life
[57:15] it's a daily dying it's a constant
[57:17] surrender and over and over we realize
[57:20] i've been transgressing i've been
[57:21] disrespectful there's there's things
[57:23] that i realize in my life i've been
[57:25] disrespecting the prophet for 10 years
[57:28] in this thing that i allow not because i
[57:30] wanted to but i was taking my own
[57:32] reasoning my own denominational spirit
[57:34] over what god has done in this day and
[57:36] now i have to come back and say god
[57:38] forgive me i am so sorry
[57:40] i'm so sorry that i could be so proud to
[57:42] think that i would have a better idea
[57:44] than the messenger that you sent to
[57:46] bring me to perfection
[57:52] so many times he says you're not to add
[57:55] one word or take one away
[57:58] and god help me not to add or take away
[58:02] help me to receive to believe to
[58:05] surrender to
[58:07] that's my that's my greatest desire
[58:11] amen i was talking to somebody i don't
[58:13] remember when a few weeks ago we're
[58:16] talking about people with different
[58:17] ideas in the message and if somebody can
[58:19] come to me with scriptures and quotes
[58:22] and a spiritual reason to believe why
[58:23] they believe in their taking from the
[58:25] message i'm fine with that
[58:27] even if i don't see it that way
[58:29] i don't feel like i have to see it that
[58:30] way but if i find that there that
[58:33] they're drawing their inspiration from
[58:34] their message and they're drawing it
[58:35] from the scriptures and they have they
[58:37] gave reasons to believe this scripture
[58:39] and this these quotes i say praise god
[58:42] they're trying to stay with the message
[58:44] i'm over here doing the same thing we
[58:46] may differ on opinion god can correct
[58:48] that later he can bring a revelation
[58:50] that takes these two things and hems
[58:51] them together i'm not going to discount
[58:53] him because he's staying in the message
[58:55] don't discount me i'm staying in the
[58:56] message too
[58:58] i believe this because the prophet said
[59:00] it i believe it because i see it in the
[59:01] scriptures i believe it because of these
[59:03] principles amen it doesn't mean i
[59:04] believe it perfectly but i believe it
[59:06] because i'm under my messenger
[59:09] and if you're the same place then god
[59:11] bless you for staying with the message
[59:13] and we believe that whatever we're not
[59:15] seeing right god will adjust the goggles
[59:17] and we'll take these two things and
[59:18] bring them right together
[59:21] i don't want to discount somebody amen
[59:23] when they're staying with the scriptures
[59:25] staying with the quotes
[59:27] as long as they won't discount me for
[59:29] that either
[59:31] i have a great even if i disagree
[59:33] there's brothers i love dearly there's
[59:35] things i disagree with them more amen
[59:37] but i respect them highly for taking
[59:39] their inspiration from the message
[59:43] not from internet preachers or other
[59:46] sources
[59:47] but i respect him highly for taking
[59:49] their inspiration from the message
[59:51] if i don't if i can't quite click with
[59:53] that thought that's okay
[59:56] if he'll stay with the message and i'll
[59:57] stay with the message it's all going to
[59:59] be okay anyways
[1:00:01] what i can't handle is adding two or
[1:00:03] taking away from
[1:00:04] that's what i can't go along with
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:10] in the third seal 1963 the third seal
[1:00:14] brother graham says now we notice that
[1:00:16] god told eve that after so long the time
[1:00:19] the word is coming back to you
[1:00:22] now how did she fall i want my class to
[1:00:24] say it what did she fall from what did
[1:00:27] eve fall from
[1:00:28] the word
[1:00:30] what did he fall from the word
[1:00:33] how will we ever get back to where eve
[1:00:36] was without the word
[1:00:38] he fell from the word there's no way to
[1:00:41] get back to that position without the
[1:00:42] word
[1:00:45] if it's not for the word coming and full
[1:00:47] manifestation in this day to bring us
[1:00:49] back to eating condition
[1:00:51] all we have is another church
[1:00:54] age all we have is another message
[1:00:58] bringing us into another church age
[1:00:59] waiting for the one that will bring the
[1:01:01] word to bring us back to eden
[1:01:04] so if
[1:01:05] we've received anything less than the
[1:01:08] perfect word of god that will restore us
[1:01:10] back to an even condition all we've
[1:01:12] received is another church age
[1:01:16] but what we've received is the finishing
[1:01:18] of the church age
[1:01:20] because the words come back
[1:01:22] and when the word come back
[1:01:24] all that was necessary to go back to
[1:01:27] eden has been restored
[1:01:31] what did she fall from the word is that
[1:01:32] right the word and god said he'd make a
[1:01:35] way to redeem her back to the word again
[1:01:37] all right after so long a time the the
[1:01:39] word would be known to her all right the
[1:01:42] the word would come for one purpose now
[1:01:45] i love this
[1:01:47] eve received a promise
[1:01:49] that promise was thy seed
[1:01:52] thy seed shall bruise the serpent's head
[1:01:55] and that was the word
[1:01:57] was that seed the word
[1:02:00] a seed was jesus christ the word
[1:02:03] and so she was promised that the word
[1:02:05] would return to you
[1:02:06] that's what the promise is
[1:02:08] thy seed she was promised a seed and
[1:02:11] that seed was the word of god and she
[1:02:13] was promised you fell from the word but
[1:02:14] someday the word will come back to you
[1:02:19] amen and god said he'd make a way to
[1:02:21] redeem her back to the word again
[1:02:23] all right the word would come for one
[1:02:25] purpose now
[1:02:27] hold tight now what i'm saying the word
[1:02:29] would come to her for one purpose
[1:02:31] that was for redemption
[1:02:34] all right but until then she had a
[1:02:36] substitute that that would work until
[1:02:38] the time arrived for the original word
[1:02:40] so now he's referring to eve as the type
[1:02:43] of the jewish bride the hebrew bride the
[1:02:45] old testament church now he's saying
[1:02:48] there was a promise given to her that
[1:02:49] the word will come back to you in the
[1:02:51] meantime you're given a substitute and
[1:02:53] that's the law and that's the sacrifices
[1:02:56] and so now he says you're given a
[1:02:57] substitute
[1:02:59] for the blood now the blood was of bulls
[1:03:01] and sheep and goats and things but it
[1:03:02] didn't take away her sins see it only
[1:03:05] covered her sin it didn't take away at
[1:03:07] all it covered it for it was an animal's
[1:03:09] blood and then the animal's blood is
[1:03:11] animal life it was a substitute until
[1:03:13] the real now get your coats on the real
[1:03:17] human blood as human beings would be
[1:03:19] become incarnate god without sex virgin
[1:03:22] the virgin birth produced that now god's
[1:03:26] word promised became blood and was
[1:03:29] incarnate in the person of jesus christ
[1:03:31] the savior
[1:03:33] god's word that he promised became blood
[1:03:37] that's why brother brown said the word
[1:03:38] bled for you the word died for you the
[1:03:41] word came back to her and when the word
[1:03:43] came back to her that word paid the
[1:03:45] price for her and that word came back to
[1:03:47] her for the purpose of redeeming her
[1:03:49] back to her position
[1:03:52] further down in the third seal he says
[1:03:54] god promised the spiritual eve as as
[1:03:57] same as he did natural eve
[1:03:59] that again the word would be restored to
[1:04:02] her
[1:04:03] so what he did for eve
[1:04:05] naturally he's done for eve spiritual so
[1:04:07] he's told the church the word would come
[1:04:09] back to her too what for for redemption
[1:04:14] in the last days he would restore to the
[1:04:16] church the original word again now watch
[1:04:18] real close i want you to be sure now god
[1:04:20] promised eve that the time would come
[1:04:22] when the word would be restored by her
[1:04:24] seed
[1:04:25] this word itself would become seed
[1:04:28] you say
[1:04:29] and he gave her a substitute and she
[1:04:31] held that substitute and when the word
[1:04:33] came to her what what did she do i don't
[1:04:36] want it it was too humble didn't look
[1:04:38] right to her wasn't polished enough a
[1:04:41] stable oh my a guy like that not a day
[1:04:44] in school i wouldn't accept that that's
[1:04:46] no messiah a guy let guys kick him
[1:04:48] around like that and then call it
[1:04:49] messiah let them put a rag around his
[1:04:51] face and hit him on the head he called
[1:04:53] himself a prophet a real prophet raised
[1:04:55] up after them
[1:04:57] they didn't know prophets jesus said so
[1:05:00] he said if you would have known the
[1:05:01] prophet you'd have known me is that
[1:05:02] right now notice but when the word came
[1:05:05] to her the way just exactly the way god
[1:05:07] said it would come she had it figured
[1:05:10] out some other way i'm talking about the
[1:05:12] bride the jewish bride the hebrew bride
[1:05:15] that was eve to begin with then when it
[1:05:17] come out here she didn't want it she
[1:05:19] wanted to stay with her substitute
[1:05:22] now god promised spiritual eve at
[1:05:24] pentecost told her even before it
[1:05:26] happened 400 years before the church
[1:05:28] ever fell that they would fall away and
[1:05:31] they would do what they've done but he
[1:05:33] promised in the last days he'd send the
[1:05:35] word again
[1:05:37] so the promise that eve received this
[1:05:39] spiritual eve has received the same
[1:05:41] promise the word will come back to you
[1:05:44] for what reason for redemption
[1:05:47] what's the day that we live and we live
[1:05:49] in the day that the word has come back
[1:05:52] the word has come back for what reason
[1:05:55] for redemption to bring us back to all
[1:05:58] that we fell from to bring us back into
[1:06:00] an eaten condition and that's why i say
[1:06:02] we can't value this word enough it's
[1:06:04] going to be this word that brings us
[1:06:07] back not our own idea not our efforts
[1:06:09] not anything it's going to be this word
[1:06:11] that's going to restore amen
[1:06:14] and brother ben said all the way back in
[1:06:16] pentecost he he promised that there
[1:06:18] would be the word restored and so let's
[1:06:20] look at this in the book of acts chapter
[1:06:22] three
[1:06:24] because brother bram said several times
[1:06:26] that from the beginning he knew they
[1:06:28] would fall away and he told the church
[1:06:30] at pentecost that he would restore
[1:06:35] look at acts chapter 3
[1:06:39] verse 19 acts chapter 3 verse 19.
[1:06:44] peter is now preaching it says repent
[1:06:46] you therefore and be converted that your
[1:06:48] sins may be blotted out when the times
[1:06:50] of refreshing shall come from the
[1:06:52] presence of the lord and he shall send
[1:06:54] jesus christ which before which preached
[1:06:56] unto you whom the heaven must receive
[1:06:58] until the time of restitution of all
[1:07:00] things which god has spoken by the mouth
[1:07:03] of all his holy prophets since the world
[1:07:05] began
[1:07:07] right in the beginning he says there's
[1:07:08] going to be a restitution of all things
[1:07:11] brother branham said at the very
[1:07:12] beginning of pentecost he told him the
[1:07:14] word's going to come back to you
[1:07:16] he goes on to say
[1:07:19] in the third seal
[1:07:21] he says now that's what's the
[1:07:24] that's what's the reason today the
[1:07:26] revivals that we're supposed to have
[1:07:28] we have denominational revivals we
[1:07:30] haven't had a real stirring
[1:07:33] no no no no no sir don't think we got
[1:07:36] revivals we haven't oh they've got
[1:07:38] millions and millions and millions of
[1:07:40] church members but not a revival nowhere
[1:07:43] no
[1:07:45] brother branham now is he's giving us a
[1:07:47] good definition
[1:07:49] he's giving us a clear understanding he
[1:07:51] says they're talking about revivals amen
[1:07:54] and in his day they were trying to
[1:07:55] revive the azusa street revival the the
[1:07:58] outpouring of the gifts from 1906 and
[1:08:00] they were looking for that kind of
[1:08:02] revival that that there would be a
[1:08:03] pentecostal revival again and brother
[1:08:06] branham says there hasn't been a revival
[1:08:08] amen there hasn't been a stirring yet
[1:08:10] we've had millions and millions but no
[1:08:12] revival yet
[1:08:14] so what is revival revival then is not a
[1:08:18] crowd revival is not a week-long sermon
[1:08:20] we're not revival it's not an avengers
[1:08:22] in the pulpit none of that is revival
[1:08:24] because brother brown the pentecostals
[1:08:26] had all of that amen
[1:08:28] they enduring those revivals they would
[1:08:30] have manifestations they would have
[1:08:32] enthusiasm they would have good
[1:08:33] preaching they would have ecstatic
[1:08:35] worship they would have but brother bam
[1:08:37] said none of that's a revival yet
[1:08:41] here's what he goes on to say
[1:08:42] the bride hasn't had a revival yet
[1:08:48] there's been no revival there no
[1:08:51] manifestation of god disturbed the bride
[1:08:53] yet
[1:08:55] so that means all of those things that
[1:08:58] through the 50s and 60s they were
[1:09:00] calling revivals
[1:09:02] weren't revivals that would stir the
[1:09:04] bride
[1:09:07] and he said there's been no revival
[1:09:09] there no manifestation of god to stir
[1:09:11] the bride yet
[1:09:14] see we're looking for it it'll take
[1:09:16] those seven unknown thunders back there
[1:09:19] to wake her up again
[1:09:21] he will send it he promised it
[1:09:25] brother now is bringing some clarity
[1:09:28] to the pentecostals in that day and he
[1:09:31] even begins and we'll read a quote in a
[1:09:32] minute he even as good friends as saying
[1:09:34] revival in our time revival in our time
[1:09:36] we'll read that quote next and he says
[1:09:38] but but that's there's been no revival
[1:09:40] there's been no revival for the bride
[1:09:42] there's been no stirring of the bride
[1:09:44] there's been no manifestation of god to
[1:09:46] wake her up yet although there's been
[1:09:49] all kinds of exciting things take place
[1:09:51] even in brother bannon's ministry there
[1:09:53] was exciting exciting things that took
[1:09:55] place but nothing to wake up the bride
[1:09:57] yet
[1:09:58] first and second paul didn't wake her up
[1:10:02] it attracted her attention but didn't
[1:10:03] wake her up amen there had to come
[1:10:05] something and brother venom said it'll
[1:10:07] take
[1:10:08] those seven unknown thunders back there
[1:10:11] to wake her up again what is those seven
[1:10:13] thunders a revelation of the word
[1:10:16] there's a mystery in the word that has
[1:10:17] to come and when the word comes it'll
[1:10:20] wake her up that's the revival she's
[1:10:22] waiting for amen not a revival of a
[1:10:24] stirring not a revival of noise not a
[1:10:26] revival of a crowd not a week-long
[1:10:29] services she was waiting for the word to
[1:10:32] come back and when the word came back
[1:10:34] that's what would bring the bride back
[1:10:37] the word is everything friends
[1:10:42] he goes on and that was the third seal
[1:10:44] he preached in
[1:10:46] march of 1963 and here we come to july
[1:10:48] of 1964 recognizing your day and its
[1:10:50] message said everywhere now there's no
[1:10:53] revival
[1:10:54] everybody's complaining ministers crying
[1:10:58] i was reading one of the outstanding
[1:11:00] papers that comes here to the church a
[1:11:01] very fine paper and i know the editor i
[1:11:04] know the people and they're godly people
[1:11:05] very fine brother and sister more of the
[1:11:07] herald of his coming one of the finest
[1:11:10] papers on the field herald of his coming
[1:11:12] but they hardly will print anything
[1:11:14] unless it's about fast pray fast praise
[1:11:16] sound of trump and how many reads it you
[1:11:18] know you see it all the time fast pray
[1:11:20] fast praise all you hear
[1:11:22] fast pray we're going to have a great
[1:11:24] breaking of the day there is a great
[1:11:26] thing going to happen all you pray pray
[1:11:28] pray we're not too late yet
[1:11:32] why do they do that
[1:11:34] why do they do that
[1:11:36] they want a great awakening
[1:11:38] they're crying believing that there will
[1:11:40] be an awakening they're good people why
[1:11:43] is it what have they done
[1:11:45] they have not recognized the awakening
[1:11:47] of the bride
[1:11:50] brother branham said in 1963 during the
[1:11:53] seals the third seal there's been no
[1:11:55] manifestation of god to wake the bride
[1:11:57] yet
[1:11:58] and now in 1960 but he says it'll take
[1:12:00] those seven unknown thunders that'll do
[1:12:01] it
[1:12:02] it'll take those seven unknown thunders
[1:12:04] to wake her up again
[1:12:06] then in 1964 in july he says why are
[1:12:08] they crying for revival they feel
[1:12:10] something they don't know what it is he
[1:12:12] says they haven't recognized the
[1:12:14] awakening of the bride
[1:12:16] so between march of 1963 and 1964 there
[1:12:21] has been a manifestation of god to wake
[1:12:23] up the bride and what was it it was the
[1:12:25] preaching of the seven thunders it was
[1:12:27] the revelation of the mysteries and the
[1:12:29] seven seals
[1:12:34] he says by being a christian
[1:12:36] they feel the pull of the hour
[1:12:38] but they haven't recognized what's been
[1:12:40] done
[1:12:42] that's what's making them feel the way
[1:12:44] they know something is supposed to
[1:12:45] happen but see they're looking for it
[1:12:47] way far in the future to come when it's
[1:12:50] already happening right by you
[1:12:53] brother ben i'm saying it's happening
[1:12:55] right by you amen and you can feel in
[1:12:58] yourself you can say i need a revival i
[1:13:00] need a fresh outpouring i need a revival
[1:13:03] amen what you need is the word amen the
[1:13:05] word will bring a fresh revival the word
[1:13:07] will bring a freshening to your
[1:13:09] experience what you need amen is the
[1:13:11] word and the line up to the word and let
[1:13:13] the word have preeminence because the
[1:13:15] word brings the awakening the word
[1:13:17] brings the revelation
[1:13:18] the word brings the life amen
[1:13:23] i ask you i'll ask you another question
[1:13:26] if we have enthusiasm excitement without
[1:13:29] the word what do we have
[1:13:32] but let's get excited about the word
[1:13:34] amen let's be enthusiastic about god has
[1:13:37] sent us something i don't have to look i
[1:13:39] have it it's in my hand i'm not hunting
[1:13:41] i'm not fishing i'm not waiting amen my
[1:13:45] everything i need god has delivered to
[1:13:47] me and the message the message to unlock
[1:13:49] the word the word is open amen i may not
[1:13:52] see it all like i want but i have it
[1:13:54] it's in my hands i've got the potential
[1:13:56] here amen we should be so enthused and
[1:13:58] so excited about that everything i have
[1:14:01] need of amen lays within me and it's
[1:14:03] unlocked by the word that's coming to me
[1:14:05] the revelation unlocks the potential
[1:14:07] within
[1:14:10] we're not waiting for another age we're
[1:14:12] not waiting for another ministry we're
[1:14:14] not waiting for more books to be printed
[1:14:15] we've got everything we need amen to
[1:14:18] unlock the potential to go back to eden
[1:14:21] to reverse the curse to end
[1:14:22] hybridization it's all been given to us
[1:14:27] how much can we overvalue this message
[1:14:30] never
[1:14:31] can we overvalue the word has been given
[1:14:33] to us never
[1:14:37] brother bam says in the uh in 1962 in
[1:14:40] december is this the sign of the answer
[1:14:42] he says the seven thunders right in the
[1:14:44] revelation here of jesus christ is some
[1:14:46] mystery does not the bible say this the
[1:14:49] revelation of jesus christ why there is
[1:14:51] some hidden mystery then of it what is
[1:14:54] it the seven thunders have it
[1:14:57] for john was just about to write and the
[1:14:59] voice come down from heaven said don't
[1:15:01] write it but seal it seal it up put it
[1:15:04] on the back side of the book it's got to
[1:15:05] be revealed it's the mysteries
[1:15:09] so the the seven thunders have it
[1:15:12] and the first seal he says
[1:15:15] then along come
[1:15:16] the pentecostal age with the baptism of
[1:15:18] the holy spirit and they cabbage down on
[1:15:20] that
[1:15:21] now there cannot be no more ages
[1:15:23] that's all of it that's the philadelphia
[1:15:25] are not the laodicea age
[1:15:27] we found in the study of the scripture
[1:15:29] that the messenger to the age came right
[1:15:31] at the end of
[1:15:32] of the age every time
[1:15:34] paul came at the end of the age we find
[1:15:36] out that irenaeus came at the end of the
[1:15:37] age martin at the end of the age luther
[1:15:39] at the end of the of the catholic age
[1:15:41] and what wesley at the end of the
[1:15:43] lutheran age and pentecost at the end of
[1:15:45] the age of sanctification through the
[1:15:46] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:49] and at the end of the pentecostal age we
[1:15:51] are supposed to receive according to the
[1:15:52] word as god help me tonight to show you
[1:15:54] through here that we are to receive a
[1:15:57] messenger that will take all these loose
[1:15:59] ends there and reveal the whole secret
[1:16:02] of god for the rapturing of the church
[1:16:05] and then there's coming forth seven
[1:16:07] mysterious thunders that's not even
[1:16:10] written at all
[1:16:11] that's right and i believe that through
[1:16:12] those seven thunders will be revealed in
[1:16:14] the last days
[1:16:16] in order to get the bride together for
[1:16:18] rapturing faith because what we got
[1:16:20] right now we wouldn't be able to do it
[1:16:23] there's something we've got to step
[1:16:25] farther we can't have enough faith for
[1:16:26] divine healing hardly we have got to
[1:16:28] have enough faith to be changed in a
[1:16:30] moment and be swept up out of this earth
[1:16:33] and we find that after a while the lord
[1:16:35] willing we find where it's written
[1:16:38] he said it's going to take
[1:16:39] amen those seven thunders that got to be
[1:16:42] revealed
[1:16:43] in the last days in order to get the
[1:16:45] bride together there was something that
[1:16:47] god was holding in the back part of his
[1:16:49] mind something that he had to get so he
[1:16:52] could finally reverse everything that
[1:16:54] was done when the first woman left the
[1:16:56] word and then she left her mate she
[1:16:58] brought death she left christ amen but
[1:17:01] there's got to be something come at the
[1:17:02] end time that will bring it all back
[1:17:04] again amen and what did she leave the
[1:17:06] word what will be restored the word what
[1:17:09] is the contained in those seven thunders
[1:17:11] the revelation of jesus christ the
[1:17:13] mystery of god has come back to the
[1:17:15] people to understand what's been going
[1:17:18] on all along where we come from where
[1:17:20] we're going to what god's plan of
[1:17:22] redemption is being to build in us of
[1:17:24] faith amen to bring us to rapturing
[1:17:27] faith to reverse what was done it was
[1:17:30] fallen by it was kept by the word fell
[1:17:32] by the word will be restored by the word
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:38] that's why romans 10 17 says so then
[1:17:40] faith cometh by hearing
[1:17:42] and hearing by the word of god
[1:17:46] how can we have faith
[1:17:48] to reverse the curse in eden until the
[1:17:51] word comes
[1:17:52] that will reverse the curse in eden
[1:17:55] the revelation the mystery in the back
[1:17:57] part of god's mind has to be delivered
[1:18:00] amen and with faith cometh by hearing
[1:18:02] and hearing by the word so if i need if
[1:18:05] it's going to be faith a revelation
[1:18:08] faith
[1:18:09] to change this mortal and
[1:18:11] if it's going to be faith and faith come
[1:18:13] by hearing the word how much should we
[1:18:15] be hearing the word that brings this
[1:18:17] kind of faith
[1:18:19] what word brings this kind of faith it
[1:18:21] was the mysteries amen it was what was
[1:18:23] preached in the seals and afterwards
[1:18:25] what was that
[1:18:27] message of the uh the message of the
[1:18:30] messenger amen it was this mystery that
[1:18:32] was laying under those seals to do what
[1:18:34] to bring a word that will bring this
[1:18:36] kind of faith that's where my attention
[1:18:38] should be that's where my devotion
[1:18:40] should be that's what i should be
[1:18:41] surrendered to
[1:18:46] in 1964 in questions and answers i'm
[1:18:48] just going to lay this in here
[1:18:51] a question came have the seven thunders
[1:18:53] which equals seven mysteries already
[1:18:54] been revealed
[1:18:56] were they revealed in the seven seals
[1:18:58] but are yet but are yet not known to us
[1:19:00] as the thunders yet
[1:19:02] it was a good question back in that day
[1:19:04] because brother branham preceding coming
[1:19:06] up to this time was saying those seven
[1:19:07] thunders will bring rapturing faith
[1:19:09] there's a mystery lies in the seven
[1:19:10] thunders amen we're restoring and he's
[1:19:12] telling all of this and now they're
[1:19:14] asking amen well well what were the
[1:19:16] seven thunders
[1:19:18] are they
[1:19:20] are the equal seven mysteries already
[1:19:21] been revealed
[1:19:23] are they this uh were they revealed in
[1:19:25] the seven seals but are yet not known to
[1:19:28] us as the thunders yet
[1:19:29] he says no they were revealed in the
[1:19:32] seven seals
[1:19:34] that's what the thunders was about
[1:19:37] so don't put this in the future it's
[1:19:39] already been given
[1:19:41] don't look for something else it's in
[1:19:43] our hands
[1:19:45] don't look for something else to come we
[1:19:46] already have it friends
[1:19:51] he said the seven thunders that had
[1:19:52] uttered their voices and no one could
[1:19:54] make out what it was john knew what it
[1:19:56] was but he was forbidden to write it he
[1:19:58] said but the seventh angel in the days
[1:20:00] of his sounding the seven mysteries of
[1:20:03] the seven thunders would be revealed
[1:20:06] and the seventh angel is a messenger of
[1:20:08] the seventh church age
[1:20:09] known as william marion branham
[1:20:13] are we looking for something or do we
[1:20:15] have it
[1:20:18] how much value
[1:20:19] can we put on what we have
[1:20:24] and the seventh seal
[1:20:26] he says i had my hands out
[1:20:29] he's talking about being up in sabino
[1:20:31] canyon he's up at pulpit rock and he's
[1:20:33] praying
[1:20:34] god woke him up that morning and told
[1:20:36] him to go up to sabine he took a tablet
[1:20:37] of paper in his bible and he went up to
[1:20:39] sabine and he climbs up to where pulpit
[1:20:42] rock is
[1:20:43] he's got my hands out and all at once
[1:20:44] something hit my hand
[1:20:47] i don't know i can't say did i go to
[1:20:49] sleep i don't know did i go into a
[1:20:50] trance i don't know was it a vision i
[1:20:52] can't tell you
[1:20:54] only thing i can say is
[1:20:56] just the same thing like them angels was
[1:20:59] getting picked up in the constellation
[1:21:00] angels and this was the same thing
[1:21:04] and it struck my hand and i looked and
[1:21:05] it was a sword
[1:21:07] and had a pearl handles real pretty had
[1:21:09] a guard over it with gold and the blade

[1:21:12] silver only it was real shiny and it was
[1:21:15] so feather edge sharp oh my and i
[1:21:17] thought isn't that the prettiest thing
[1:21:19] just fit my hand i thought that all
[1:21:21] that's awful pretty but i said hey i'm
[1:21:24] always afraid of them things of sword
[1:21:26] and i thought what will i do with that
[1:21:30] and just then a voice shook down through
[1:21:32] there that rocked the rock said it's the
[1:21:34] sword of the king
[1:21:36] and then i come out of it the sword of
[1:21:37] the king
[1:21:39] now if it said any sort of a king but it
[1:21:41] said the sword of the king there's only
[1:21:44] one the king and that's god and he has
[1:21:46] one sword that's his word what i live by

[1:23:34] we were talking about wednesday night
[1:23:35] after brother abraham brother marcus

[1:23:44] the solution to every problem is this

[1:24:01] the word it's all the word the word the
[1:24:04] word and the word is not left off in
[1:24:06] this age the word has been restored in
[1:24:08] this age and it's not missing pieces
[1:24:10] even that part which wasn't written in
[1:24:12] the bible amen that john was forbidden
[1:24:14] the right that part has been given back
[1:24:16] to our hand no other generation has had
[1:24:18] that peace
[1:24:20] they could look and read and say
[1:24:22] something uttered from heaven something
[1:24:24] was spoke it thundered there was a voice
[1:24:26] of god something was spoken there's
[1:24:28] another word amen but it wasn't recorded
[1:24:31] nobody has had what those thunders were
[1:24:33] until this day we have been given the
[1:24:36] missing piece of the word the full word
[1:24:38] has been brought back there's nothing
[1:24:40] else we need but to stay with this word
[1:24:43] and give everything to it
[1:24:48] let's not wait for anything else
[1:24:51] let's take all of our life and focus it
[1:24:53] on this word
[1:24:55] all of our affections all of our efforts
[1:24:57] all of our time and attention let's
[1:24:59] focus it on this word and let's
[1:25:01] surrender to the word that's been given
[1:25:02] to us
[1:25:05] i
[1:25:05] i don't know about you but i'm tired of
[1:25:07] myself
[1:25:09] tired of my own hindrances and i'm tired
[1:25:11] of my own distractions and i'm tired of
[1:25:13] my own emotions i'm tired of my own
[1:25:15] weariness i'm tired of my own my own
[1:25:17] desire to play and my own frivolities
[1:25:20] i'm tired of it all what i want is to
[1:25:22] see this word manifest what it was sent
[1:25:24] for amen i'm ready for a body change i'm
[1:25:27] ready for the reversing of the fall of
[1:25:29] eve i'm ready for the millennium i want
[1:25:31] it i want it with everything that's in
[1:25:33] me god help me get past this flesh and
[1:25:36] dig into this word and surrender
[1:25:38] everything to this word
[1:25:40] i'm tired of this hybridization i'm
[1:25:42] tired of a fallen mind i'm tired of
[1:25:45] wrong desires
[1:25:47] what i want is for this word to have
[1:25:49] preeminence in my life
[1:25:51] i want to surrender more i want to give
[1:25:53] more i want to give it more first place
[1:25:55] i want to heed more
[1:25:57] to this word
[1:26:01] i think that's what he's looking for
[1:26:04] because the great threefold plan of god
[1:26:07] unfolded in three folds and the first
[1:26:09] fold was accomplished in jesus christ
[1:26:11] when he got preeminence and a man
[1:26:14] and what kind of premise that he had
[1:26:15] jesus only did that which the father
[1:26:17] showed him
[1:26:20] but the second fold is to get
[1:26:21] pre-eminence in a people and that's what
[1:26:23] he's doing now through you and i
[1:26:25] how much premise does he want the same
[1:26:27] amount that he had in jesus christ
[1:26:30] and
[1:26:31] and the one thing about preeminence
[1:26:33] is even with jesus christ god never took
[1:26:36] it
[1:26:38] jesus had to give it
[1:26:40] jesus had to give him preeminence he was
[1:26:43] allowed to make his choice he was
[1:26:44] allowed to wrestle it out amen in
[1:26:46] gethsemane brother bannon said he did
[1:26:48] not have to go to calvary he chose to go
[1:26:50] to calvary
[1:26:53] he was given as a flesh being he was
[1:26:55] given room to make his choice god never
[1:26:58] took preeminence jesus gave him
[1:27:00] preeminence
[1:27:01] and god will never take preeminence in
[1:27:03] the bride amen until first of god the
[1:27:06] bride gives him preeminence and when she
[1:27:08] gives him preeminence he'll take his
[1:27:09] place in the bride
[1:27:12] i said god i want to give you more
[1:27:14] preeminence
[1:27:17] i think the best thing that could ever
[1:27:18] happen to us
[1:27:20] the best thing is we all lost our jobs
[1:27:22] and they shut down the church
[1:27:25] and we had to get on our face before god
[1:27:27] night and day
[1:27:29] and nothing else mattered and we didn't
[1:27:30] care about anything else
[1:27:32] and nothing else distracted us
[1:27:34] it'd probably be the best thing that
[1:27:35] ever happened to us do you agree
[1:27:37] now i'm not asking for that to happen i
[1:27:38] don't want them
[1:27:40] but what i want is i want to come so
[1:27:42] alive to what god's given me that i
[1:27:43] begin to give him that now amen i begin
[1:27:46] to give him that on a daily basis that
[1:27:47] it's not a treasury for me to wake up
[1:27:49] early and go seek his face because i
[1:27:51] want that more than i want what
[1:27:53] a half hour of sleep god help me
[1:27:56] how many times have i sacrificed a half
[1:27:58] an hour sleep for communion with the
[1:27:59] lord
[1:28:00] i'd be ashamed to tell you how many
[1:28:02] times
[1:28:03] but i tell you i have no desire for that
[1:28:05] inside in the inner man i i want to
[1:28:07] bring this outer man into subjection and
[1:28:09] say i'm tired of you running the show
[1:28:11] there's something deeper inside i want
[1:28:13] him to have preeminence i want him to
[1:28:14] have first place i want him to have my
[1:28:16] best hours i want him to have my
[1:28:18] my undivided attention i want him to
[1:28:20] have my life amen
[1:28:23] i think that's the bride that he's
[1:28:25] looking for
[1:28:27] job said in job 23 let's turn and look
[1:28:30] at this scripture together job 23.
[1:28:43] job chapter 23
[1:28:49] and i'm going to begin
[1:28:51] with verse 8.
[1:28:55] behold i go forward
[1:28:57] but he's not there
[1:28:58] and backward but i cannot perceive him
[1:29:01] on the left hand where he does work but
[1:29:03] i cannot behold him he hideth himself
[1:29:06] from the right hand that i cannot see
[1:29:08] him
[1:29:09] but he knoweth the way that i take and
[1:29:11] when he hath tried me i shall come forth
[1:29:13] this gold
[1:29:15] my foot hath held his steps his way have
[1:29:18] i kept
[1:29:19] and
[1:29:20] not declined
[1:29:21] neither have i gone back from the
[1:29:23] commandment of his lips i have esteemed
[1:29:25] the words of his mouth more than my
[1:29:28] necessary
[1:29:29] food
[1:29:31] i want to put this little statement into
[1:29:33] perspective
[1:29:35] job's in the midst of a
[1:29:36] trial everything's going wrong in his
[1:29:39] life and he doesn't understand why
[1:29:41] things are going wrong in his life
[1:29:43] and he makes this statement
[1:29:45] he says
[1:29:47] he says behold i go forward but he's not
[1:29:50] there.
[1:29:51] he said i can't find god in my trial i
[1:29:53] don't know where he's at
[1:29:55] i go forward but he's not there
[1:29:58] backward but i cannot perceive him i
[1:30:01] don't know what god's doing i don't know
[1:30:03] where god is i don't know what's
[1:30:05] happening and i don't know how to find
[1:30:06] out
[1:30:07] do you understand are we on the same
[1:30:09] page
[1:30:10] this is job's mentality
[1:30:12] on the left hand where he does work but
[1:30:14] i cannot behold him he hides himself on
[1:30:16] the right hand that i cannot see him
[1:30:19] he said i don't know but then he says
[1:30:21] something he does know
[1:30:23] but he knoweth the way that i take
[1:30:25] i don't know where he's at but he knows
[1:30:26] where i'm at
[1:30:28] he knows the way that i take and when he
[1:30:30] hath tried me i shall come forth as gold
[1:30:34] what a bold statement for a man to make
[1:30:39] i don't know where he's at i don't know
[1:30:41] where he's hiding i don't know what he's
[1:30:43] doing but he knows the way that i'm
[1:30:45] taking and when he has tried me i shall
[1:30:47] come forth as gold and why can job make
[1:30:50] a statement like that let's keep reading
[1:30:53] because he says my foot hath held his
[1:30:55] steps
[1:30:57] i did what his word said do
[1:31:01] my foot i thought of steps his way have
[1:31:04] i kept and not declined neither have i
[1:31:08] gone back from the commandment of his
[1:31:10] lips i have esteemed the words of his
[1:31:12] mouth more than my necessary food
[1:31:15] look at job's attitude towards the word
[1:31:17] of god he said i gave him first place i
[1:31:21] went in his way i have not declined from
[1:31:24] his commandment i i have esteemed the
[1:31:26] words of his mouth more than my
[1:31:28] necessary food i have given him first
[1:31:30] place and i have obeyed him i have no
[1:31:32] idea what he's doing but he knows the
[1:31:33] way that i take him when he's tried me i
[1:31:35] shall come forth this goal because i did
[1:31:37] what he told me to do i stayed in his
[1:31:40] commandment i obeyed his word there's no
[1:31:42] other outcome but perfection
[1:31:47] we don't always understand what's going
[1:31:49] on in our lives and we we may not be
[1:31:51] able to comprehend this that or the
[1:31:53] other but one thing amen let's get to a
[1:31:55] place where he says i don't know why
[1:31:57] this is happening to my family but i
[1:31:59] have done what he said do and i know
[1:32:01] it's going to work out for good and i
[1:32:02] know that we shall come forth this goal
[1:32:05] i don't know why this trial has come i
[1:32:07] don't know this or that i prayed and god
[1:32:09] has not revealed to me where i've
[1:32:10] transgressed any of his commandments as
[1:32:12] far as i know i've obeyed everything
[1:32:15] that the prophet taught and i've stayed
[1:32:16] with the word as much as i know and i
[1:32:18] know that this trial when it's over i
[1:32:20] shall come forth as gold because i
[1:32:23] stayed with the word
[1:32:26] we can have confidence not in ourselves
[1:32:28] but confidence in the word
[1:32:31] job wasn't looking at himself job was
[1:32:33] looking at the commandment he kept
[1:32:35] i did what he said and i didn't decline
[1:32:38] i didn't step away but i did what he
[1:32:40] told me and that's why he could be so
[1:32:42] bold
[1:32:43] in his statement
[1:32:47] and the first seal
[1:32:50] brother brahman says now notice
[1:32:52] in the same time this is going on just
[1:32:54] before this takes place rather on the
[1:32:55] earth god has promised while all them
[1:32:58] scruples up with denominations arguing
[1:33:00] their differences about their creed
[1:33:02] god promised that he would send us a
[1:33:03] true prophet of the true word with a
[1:33:05] message to return the original word of
[1:33:08] god and the faith of the fathers
[1:33:10] to bring down the power of the holy
[1:33:12] ghost amongst the people
[1:33:15] what did the message do
[1:33:17] it brought the power of the holy ghost
[1:33:19] amongst the people
[1:33:21] and what does the power do that's what
[1:33:22] he says next
[1:33:24] with a power that'll raise her above all
[1:33:27] these things
[1:33:28] what things all the denominational
[1:33:30] things and all the carnal things and all
[1:33:32] the worldly things what does the power
[1:33:33] of the holy ghost do first it raises her
[1:33:36] above all of these denominational things
[1:33:40] and
[1:33:41] take her in
[1:33:42] at the same time
[1:33:44] to raise her above the denominations and
[1:33:47] take her in to the marriage supper
[1:33:50] that's what the power of the holy ghost
[1:33:51] came down to do
[1:33:52] when was it unleashed when the word was
[1:33:55] restored
[1:33:59] what other power do we want except the
[1:34:00] power to rise above all the carnal
[1:34:02] things and to go into the marriage
[1:34:03] supper
[1:34:04] that's the power that i want and that's
[1:34:06] the power that's been given
[1:34:08] it's with the word
[1:34:11] he said in the message
[1:34:13] in the invisible union
[1:34:15] and when the life comes out of that
[1:34:17] denomination goes into the grain
[1:34:20] then what happens
[1:34:21] when the grain begins to grow and to get
[1:34:24] bigger so that it can cover over
[1:34:25] something the denomination pulls away
[1:34:28] from it
[1:34:29] why ain't we got a denomination out of
[1:34:31] this they never will be it's the grain
[1:34:34] it can't go no farther we're at the end
[1:34:36] time so what does it have to do now
[1:34:39] lay in the presence of the sun to be
[1:34:41] ripened
[1:34:43] that's exact the word to be ripened into
[1:34:46] your hearts to bring forth and live
[1:34:48] what we're talking about
[1:34:51] what's the last stage
[1:34:54] uh
[1:34:54] we know that
[1:34:56] as we've been talking and as we've been
[1:34:58] preaching today
[1:34:59] that god had established everything in
[1:35:02] eden upon his word and it was held in
[1:35:03] perfection by the word of god
[1:35:06] but one deviation from one word brought
[1:35:09] a ruination of everything
[1:35:11] because everything was held in place by
[1:35:13] the word
[1:35:14] and when when eve left the word
[1:35:17] she left christ
[1:35:19] judgment came
[1:35:21] everything fell
[1:35:23] so god has got to bring back a word and
[1:35:25] he's promised to the end time gentile
[1:35:27] bride that the word would be restored
[1:35:29] again
[1:35:30] and what would the word do the word
[1:35:32] would come back and bring rapturing
[1:35:34] faith amen to finish the cycle of
[1:35:37] redemption what does the word come back
[1:35:38] for for redemption
[1:35:40] what will finish redemption when all the
[1:35:43] seed are gathered back home
[1:35:47] everything has come back the word has
[1:35:49] come back it's here god is not going to
[1:35:52] send another prophet he sent the prophet
[1:35:55] there's not another seventh angel
[1:35:57] there's only one seventh angel and he
[1:35:58] sent that seventh angel
[1:36:00] there's not another seven thunders to be
[1:36:02] revealed the seven thunders have already
[1:36:04] been revealed
[1:36:07] what are we looking for what's the last
[1:36:09] phase the last phase is for us who's
[1:36:12] received the word
[1:36:14] to stay in the presence of this light
[1:36:17] to bake out all the immaturity
[1:36:21] to bring us into the perfect image of
[1:36:23] the word that's been restored
[1:36:25] to reflect back the full life of jesus
[1:36:28] christ by what by staying in the
[1:36:32] presence of the son
[1:36:35] not another message
[1:36:37] not another great revelation
[1:36:39] not a new doctrine not new books not
[1:36:41] another church not a move not another
[1:36:43] revival the bride's already been
[1:36:45] awakened why do we need to wake her
[1:36:46] again
[1:36:48] don't need another revival don't need
[1:36:50] another push we don't need to turn
[1:36:51] another corner we've already turned the
[1:36:53] last corner
[1:36:57] we don't need anything else
[1:36:58] we need to take what's been given and
[1:37:00] give our whole life to it
[1:37:02] and surrender and come completely under
[1:37:05] it and completely into it
[1:37:07] and not do like eve did not do like the
[1:37:10] jewish church did not do like the first
[1:37:12] gentile church did but there's got to be
[1:37:14] a church that's different this time a
[1:37:16] church that will take what's been given
[1:37:17] and stick with it until it produces what
[1:37:20] it's promised to produce
[1:37:22] every one of those other churches and
[1:37:24] brides they would have produced what the
[1:37:26] word said if they would have stayed with
[1:37:27] the word just a little bit longer but
[1:37:29] they all stopped too short
[1:37:32] but i'm so glad there's a promise in the
[1:37:34] day that there's a bride that will not
[1:37:36] fall
[1:37:37] she's predestinated not to
[1:37:40] i believe that's me
[1:37:42] i believe that's you
[1:37:44] so what do i do
[1:37:46] lay in the presence of the sun well how
[1:37:48] do you blame the presence of the sun
[1:37:50] not running all over god's creation
[1:37:52] playing around with all your time
[1:37:55] but laying in the presence of son is to
[1:37:56] stay under this word
[1:37:59] stay plugged in keep feeding on it stay
[1:38:02] in fellowship stay in service keep
[1:38:05] reading keep feeding keep staying under
[1:38:07] this life until it keeps baking out all
[1:38:09] the greenness all the greenness all the
[1:38:11] greenness
[1:38:13] amen we're not waiting for anything else
[1:38:15] it's already here
[1:38:17] all we're doing is waiting for it to
[1:38:18] mature within us
[1:38:20] and it's not going to happen until we
[1:38:22] give it first place
[1:38:25] brother bannon was talking about going
[1:38:27] beyond the curtain of time
[1:38:29] and he talked about you know you know he
[1:38:32] had a hard time describing he said it
[1:38:33] was perfection it was beyond perfection
[1:38:35] he said there's not enough words in the
[1:38:37] english language to describe it it was
[1:38:40] it was perfect love the only thing i'll
[1:38:41] enter in there is perfect love it's the
[1:38:43] realm of the word it's so many things we
[1:38:45] can use to describe it but brother
[1:38:46] branham could never accurately describe
[1:38:49] that
[1:38:50] but he said those people would run up to
[1:38:51] him and say my precious brother and and
[1:38:54] they would hug his neck and there was
[1:38:55] perfect love there and brother branham
[1:38:57] was set remember in the vision in the
[1:38:59] dream or the vision he was set up on a
[1:39:01] pillar
[1:39:03] and he said what are you doing this he
[1:39:04] said because on earth you were a leader
[1:39:06] and and so in that realm he's still the
[1:39:08] leader
[1:39:10] over there he's still the one that
[1:39:12] they're all under
[1:39:15] that's important to realize
[1:39:17] and
[1:39:18] and he begins to he begins to talk about
[1:39:21] the feeling and the people and the
[1:39:22] genuine sisters and genuine brothers and
[1:39:24] the genuine love and all of that and
[1:39:27] then he starts to talk about this
[1:39:29] ripening into perfection and receiving
[1:39:31] the word and laying in the presence of
[1:39:32] the sun and then to bake all the
[1:39:34] greenness out to come into the perfect
[1:39:36] image and then it refers back to that
[1:39:39] going beyond the current of time and he
[1:39:41] says before we leave before before this
[1:39:44] happens talking about the going away the
[1:39:45] bride he said i think it'll be something
[1:39:47] like it was over there
[1:39:50] i believe it'll be something like it was
[1:39:52] over there
[1:39:55] when he makes a statement like that
[1:39:57] i say god bake the greenness out of me
[1:40:02] bake the greenness out of me
[1:40:04] what was it like over there
[1:40:06] there was love perfect love
[1:40:10] it was a realm of the perfect word and
[1:40:12] they all over there had perfect faith
[1:40:15] brother branham was exalted in their
[1:40:17] midst they the men grabbed him and put
[1:40:19] him up on the pedestal they were happy
[1:40:21] that he was the head
[1:40:23] they were happy to be under his ministry
[1:40:26] and then when he asked the angel can i
[1:40:28] see jesus and he says he'll come to you
[1:40:30] first and judge you amen and and then
[1:40:33] they told they told brother we'll be
[1:40:34] judged with you
[1:40:36] and they were happy with that
[1:40:39] they were happy for him to be the head
[1:40:41] and for they exalted him to the head and
[1:40:44] for them to be judged underneath of him
[1:40:46] and then brother ben said i preached
[1:40:47] what paul preached and they all said
[1:40:49] we're resting on that
[1:40:53] and brother branham said i think it'll
[1:40:55] be here something like it was over there
[1:40:57] just before the rapture
[1:41:00] i said god let it be that way in my
[1:41:02] heart where i'm happy he's the head i
[1:41:04] exalt him to his position it was the
[1:41:06] brothers who picked him up and put him
[1:41:08] on that pedestal let me now put him on
[1:41:11] that pedestal so that here it's
[1:41:12] something like it was there
[1:41:14] let us live in perfect love for one
[1:41:16] another to appreciate one another and
[1:41:17] call one another precious brother let's
[1:41:19] make it here something like it was over
[1:41:21] there and let's be happy that he'll be
[1:41:23] judged first and will be found in his
[1:41:26] judgment if he passes we pass
[1:41:29] i don't have some side venture going
[1:41:31] where if the prophet was a little wrong
[1:41:32] here i you know i've already told god i
[1:41:35] don't exactly believe it that way i
[1:41:36] really got it lined up with the word
[1:41:37] over here that's not how it was there
[1:41:40] nobody there was correcting him nobody
[1:41:43] there had another idea they put him on
[1:41:45] the pedestal and they were happy to be
[1:41:47] judged they said he'll come and judge
[1:41:49] you and we'll be judged with you
[1:41:55] he said before the rapture it'll be
[1:41:57] something here like it was there
[1:42:00] what'll bring that perfect love this
[1:42:02] kind of attitude
[1:42:04] when when god's word is respected when
[1:42:07] his way is respected when his prophets
[1:42:09] respected when the word has been
[1:42:11] restored is respected when the believers
[1:42:13] together respect one another and live in
[1:42:15] harmony under that prophet amen and when
[1:42:18] he says you'll be will be judged with
[1:42:20] you they're fine with that i'll be
[1:42:22] judged with him
[1:42:25] but what if he's wrong then if he's
[1:42:27] wrong and god was the one who vindicated
[1:42:29] him
[1:42:31] if he was wrong all i will say is god i
[1:42:34] just believe what you've indicated
[1:42:36] [Music]
[1:42:37] i don't need to start hedging against
[1:42:39] the day that brother ben's wrong
[1:42:42] if that attitude's anywhere in your mind
[1:42:44] he was a little awful in this and maybe
[1:42:46] off on that and i've got maybe my little
[1:42:47] own idea on that then it's not here for
[1:42:49] you like it was over there you're not
[1:42:51] ready for the rapture
[1:42:56] we don't need our own little ideas and
[1:42:58] hedging against the possibility that he
[1:42:59] was wrong in this document wrong in that
[1:43:00] doctrine amen we're judged under him
[1:43:03] when he passes judgment we pass judgment
[1:43:07] so i'm going to stay here under that
[1:43:09] headship
[1:43:11] i have no desire to correct him none
[1:43:13] none whatsoever
[1:43:15] if i correct the prophet then somehow
[1:43:17] i'm equal to or above the prophet and i
[1:43:19] don't want to be in that position i
[1:43:20] don't want to bear that responsibility i
[1:43:21] want nothing to do with that i want to
[1:43:23] be the one who lifts him up on the
[1:43:24] pedestal carries him on my shoulder
[1:43:26] praise god you're the prophet of the age
[1:43:28] and i'm so happy that he's going to come
[1:43:30] and judge you first and i'll be judged
[1:43:31] with you
[1:43:33] because that prophet said i preached
[1:43:35] what paul preached and i believe that
[1:43:37] with all my heart and i'm resting on
[1:43:39] that here because i was resting on it
[1:43:41] there because brother branham come and
[1:43:43] he was speaking to a congregation and he
[1:43:45] said i saw all of you over there i
[1:43:47] believe i was over there and i already
[1:43:49] said i'm resting on that i've already
[1:43:50] put him on the pedestal i'm already
[1:43:52] ready to be judged under him and i'm
[1:43:54] already resting in the fact he preached
[1:43:56] a pure word
[1:43:58] and brother benham said i believe before
[1:44:00] the rapture it'll be here something like
[1:44:02] it was over there
[1:44:04] i said friends let's make it here like
[1:44:06] it was over there
[1:44:08] let's just surrender to what god gave us
[1:44:12] let's put good value on the word let's
[1:44:14] stop playing around with our little
[1:44:16] entertainments and then our little
[1:44:17] selfish desires and running after the
[1:44:20] world here and there and our own ideas
[1:44:22] and division on doctrine and whatever is
[1:44:25] holding us back little fashion things
[1:44:27] and entertainment and movies and disney
[1:44:29] stuff and let's just start dropping all
[1:44:32] of that stuff and make it over here
[1:44:33] something like it was over there
[1:44:38] let's surrender
[1:44:40] more
[1:44:42] more can you ever surrender too much for
[1:44:44] the word
[1:44:45] can you give up too much for the word
[1:44:48] can you show the word too much respect
[1:44:51] no the word is god
[1:44:53] can you
[1:44:54] surrender too much give up too much
[1:44:57] no
[1:44:58] you can't surrender too much for the
[1:45:00] word say god help me to surrender all
[1:45:04] because i'm safe
[1:45:06] under that word
[1:45:08] i want it to be in my heart
[1:45:10] today
[1:45:11] something like it was over there
[1:45:13] when brother ben went beyond the curtain
[1:45:15] of time
[1:45:16] i want
[1:45:17] on my shoulders
[1:45:19] to lift that prophet to that pedestal
[1:45:22] do you want to lift him
[1:45:24] lift him in your life in your heart
[1:45:26] today put him on the pedestal
[1:45:28] lift him up above the rest of the
[1:45:30] congregation lift him up above every
[1:45:32] other man and every other man's idea and
[1:45:34] every other minister and everything else
[1:45:36] why don't why don't us as brothers and
[1:45:38] sisters today carry him on our shoulders
[1:45:39] and let's put him on the pedestal so
[1:45:40] it'll be something here like it was over
[1:45:42] there
[1:45:44] let's be content saying he'll be judged
[1:45:46] and i'll be judged with him
[1:45:49] if he's found all right i'm found all
[1:45:51] right because i obeyed what he said
[1:45:55] and i'm content saying i'm resting on
[1:45:58] the fact that he preached what paul
[1:46:00] preached
[1:46:02] this isn't a halfway message this isn't
[1:46:04] a 95 accurate message
[1:46:06] we're not dealing with a close call or
[1:46:09] the best next thing we're dealing with
[1:46:11] the perfect message the perfect word
[1:46:13] with perfection was the man perfect no
[1:46:15] the mistake sure he confessed that he
[1:46:17] told it but i'm talking about the word
[1:46:19] that was brought the doctrines that were
[1:46:20] preached the things that were taught to
[1:46:22] the church was the perfect word for us
[1:46:24] to live by to surrender to
[1:46:26] the the the attach our soul destination
[1:46:30] to
[1:46:31] that's what god has given us in this day
[1:46:34] and he said i believe
[1:46:36] that it'll be something here before the
[1:46:38] rapture to be something here like it was
[1:46:39] over there
[1:46:41] and i say i believe it because in my
[1:46:42] heart it's already coming
[1:46:44] it's already stirring
[1:46:46] let there be perfect love
[1:46:48] by perfect faith and a perfect word
[1:46:52] if there's any little thing in our
[1:46:54] hearts
[1:46:55] that has us concerned about the word
[1:46:58] that has us concerned about whether the
[1:47:00] prophet was right or not listen if
[1:47:02] there's a question or a concern it'll
[1:47:03] never be here like it was over there
[1:47:07] over there they didn't doubt his
[1:47:08] ministry
[1:47:11] they had no questions to whether he was
[1:47:12] right or not
[1:47:14] they weren't worried about if he had
[1:47:16] gotten this wrong or that wrong
[1:47:19] they were content that he was the
[1:47:21] messenger of the age and they were under
[1:47:23] him
[1:47:24] perfectly content
[1:47:27] if there's a question in your heart a
[1:47:28] concern
[1:47:30] about the doctrine about the teaching
[1:47:31] about the life
[1:47:33] i i admonish you with all that's in me
[1:47:36] get on your face and ask god to bring a
[1:47:37] revelation don't stay in that in between
[1:47:39] state it's not going to work
[1:47:42] it won't work you'll fall away somewhere
[1:47:44] you'll come into a dead end you'll hit a
[1:47:46] wreck somewhere you're not going to stay
[1:47:49] much longer in that in between state
[1:47:51] because we're coming fast to the rapture
[1:47:53] and it'll be something here like it was
[1:47:54] there
[1:47:56] if you're not confident
[1:47:58] that god sent the seventh angel and that
[1:48:00] seventh angel was manifest and william
[1:48:03] mariam branham
[1:48:05] and that the preaching of the seventh
[1:48:06] the mystery the seven thunders was
[1:48:08] preached and delivered to the bride that
[1:48:10] the word was restored to perfection with
[1:48:13] the perfect interpretation the word with
[1:48:15] divine vindication if you're not sure of
[1:48:17] that it's time to get on your face say
[1:48:19] god i need a deeper revelation than what
[1:48:21] i have
[1:48:23] because this isn't another church age
[1:48:24] there's another movement we're not
[1:48:25] waiting for another revival we're not
[1:48:27] waiting
[1:48:28] this is it if this ain't it there's
[1:48:29] nothing else is it this is it it's got
[1:48:31] to be all of it it can't be part of it
[1:48:33] it's not 98
[1:48:34] it's either it or it's not it
[1:48:38] there's no time for another age there's
[1:48:39] no time for another messenger it's it
[1:48:41] it's got to be it in your heart it can't
[1:48:43] be it just with everybody else around
[1:48:45] you you can't be moving with the flow
[1:48:47] amen god's going to make sure that you
[1:48:48] can't stay in the flow nobody else is
[1:48:51] going to carry you along you've got to
[1:48:53] have here what they had over there
[1:48:57] i say get on your face until you say i
[1:49:00] believe with all my heart this is the
[1:49:02] only way
[1:49:04] and i'm giving all of myself to this
[1:49:08] and when you do
[1:49:09] you'll find
[1:49:11] that everything we have need of is in
[1:49:13] this word
[1:49:16] everything
[1:49:17] everything we need to overcome laodicea
[1:49:19] everything we need for a body change
[1:49:21] everything we need for perfect love
[1:49:24] everything we need for more faith it's
[1:49:26] in this word that's been given to us
[1:49:28] it's in our hands
[1:49:30] let's give ourselves completely to it
[1:49:33] let's surrender like we've never
[1:49:34] surrendered before let's love his word
[1:49:36] like we've never loved it before let's
[1:49:38] sacrifice everything else for it and
[1:49:40] quit sacrificing the word for everything
[1:49:42] else
[1:49:43] let's give up other things
[1:49:46] to let this word have preeminence in our
[1:49:48] lives
[1:49:49] because it's the solution
[1:49:50] for the end time condition
[1:49:53] it's the solution for all of time's
[1:49:56] condition
[1:49:57] it's the only solution it is the fix it
[1:50:00] is the repair job it is the restitution
[1:50:03] of all things it is the restoration of
[1:50:05] the word it is redemption come to
[1:50:08] fullness
[1:50:09] there's nothing else
[1:50:11] let's just give ourselves to this
[1:50:14] god bless you as we stand
[1:50:17] musicians if you'll come brother john if
[1:50:19] you'll make your way up
[1:50:22] amen whenever i have time
[1:50:24] to stop and meditate
[1:50:26] these are where my meditations go
[1:50:30] that
[1:50:32] this message has got to be
[1:50:34] everything
[1:50:37] god didn't do such a mighty work and
[1:50:39] mighty manifestation
[1:50:41] to get us to halfway surrender to the
[1:50:43] word
[1:50:45] god didn't move nations god didn't move
[1:50:47] circumstances god didn't
[1:50:51] i mean think about god didn't allow a
[1:50:54] pillar of fire to be the only picture on
[1:50:56] a roll of film
[1:50:58] that came out
[1:51:00] for nothing
[1:51:02] god didn't send a cloud
[1:51:04] 37 miles high in arizona to be have
[1:51:07] pictures taken of it 28 minutes before
[1:51:09] sunset so it was visible for about half
[1:51:11] an hour before sunset
[1:51:14] and he didn't he didn't do that amen
[1:51:17] while a meteorologist and atmospheric
[1:51:20] scientist was watching
[1:51:22] for nothing
[1:51:24] god didn't record it and send it in life
[1:51:26] magazine and all over the world for
[1:51:28] nothing
[1:51:30] you understand what i'm saying god
[1:51:32] didn't give us this message the way he
[1:51:34] gave it for nothing he gave it to us the
[1:51:36] way he gave it to us for us to give it
[1:51:38] everything
[1:51:40] we can't take it lightly or trivial
[1:51:43] and i'm afraid in myself there's times i
[1:51:45] take it too lightly
[1:51:47] there's times i don't put enough gravity
[1:51:48] enough weight in it but i say god help
[1:51:50] me i want to give it all
[1:51:53] because this is my
[1:51:55] my only hope
[1:51:57] this message has been given to us it's
[1:51:59] my only hope
[1:52:00] explain to me your plan b
[1:52:03] meet me after church and tell me what
[1:52:06] what you got as a backup plan
[1:52:09] there is none
[1:52:11] this is it
[1:52:12] and i say the faster i can surrender to
[1:52:14] it the better it's going to be for me
[1:52:16] the more that i can give it first place
[1:52:18] listen this word didn't come to disrupt
[1:52:21] our lives amen it come to kill us
[1:52:24] so that it can give us eternal life
[1:52:26] so that we can come into real life it
[1:52:28] come to destroy everything that was not
[1:52:30] the word so that the word could flourish
[1:52:31] in our lives it didn't come to take away
[1:52:33] our fun it gave it it came to give us
[1:52:35] the most peace the most joy the most
[1:52:37] rest that we've ever had in our lives it
[1:52:39] didn't come amen to hamper our lives it
[1:52:42] came to bring us into life
[1:52:45] we've got to have the right attitude
[1:52:47] towards it if we put the right attitude
[1:52:49] towards it we get the right results from
[1:52:51] it
[1:52:52] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:52:54] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[1:52:56] jesus for your word
[1:52:58] oh god what can we say in the face of
[1:53:01] your perfect word
[1:53:03] lord what
[1:53:04] all of time has been waiting for
[1:53:07] is for a restoration of the word
[1:53:10] lord before the foundation of the world
[1:53:13] you had a mystery in the back part of
[1:53:15] your mind
[1:53:16] and you knew exactly when
[1:53:19] that you would unveil that mystery
[1:53:21] you knew the date you knew the vessel
[1:53:23] that you would use
[1:53:25] you knew how you would do it in the
[1:53:26] circumstances surrounding it you knew
[1:53:28] how you would vindicate it
[1:53:30] when you were writing your bible you
[1:53:32] made sure the scriptures were there that
[1:53:34] would point to it
[1:53:36] to show where it is
[1:53:38] you brought the the manifestation you
[1:53:40] brought the sign in the sky you brought
[1:53:42] the prophet on the scene you brought the
[1:53:44] vindication
[1:53:46] you knew when it would happen you knew
[1:53:48] what day we would be here
[1:53:50] not only that you brought me here lord
[1:53:53] in this day
[1:53:55] to benefit from that word
[1:53:57] god you saw fit to ordain me and my
[1:54:00] brothers and sisters that are here to be
[1:54:02] alive in this hour when you've done such
[1:54:05] a work
[1:54:07] and you knew what you would do before
[1:54:09] the fall because you were the lamb slain
[1:54:11] from before the foundation of the world
[1:54:13] you knew how you would redeem you knew
[1:54:15] what method you would take in redemption
[1:54:18] you knew that you would have a gentile
[1:54:20] bride of your own choosing you knew
[1:54:21] about the falling away you knew about
[1:54:23] the restoration of the bride tree you
[1:54:25] laid it in job's prophecy and joel's
[1:54:28] prophecy of the of the canker worm and
[1:54:30] the caterpillar
[1:54:31] but you said i will restore you knew it
[1:54:33] before
[1:54:36] you've brought us to the hour of
[1:54:38] fulfillment
[1:54:39] you've brought us to the moment in time
[1:54:42] then you would reverse that curse that
[1:54:44] you would destroy the works of the devil
[1:54:46] and you brought up people and were part
[1:54:48] of that people that you would use amen
[1:54:50] to destroy the works of the devil and
[1:54:52] you brought a word that will accomplish
[1:54:53] it all and you've unlocked a faith lord
[1:54:56] that can attain it all

[1:55:27] you're going to take these vessels of
[1:55:29] clay that you've predestinated not to
[1:55:31] fall and you're going to accomplish what
[1:55:33] you've not been able to accomplish
[1:55:34] through the bride type before you will
[1:55:36] do it in this hour all you're looking
[1:55:38] for is preeminent somebody that will

[1:58:48] through me
[1:58:53] and hurt and
[1:58:55] self-inflicted pain

[2:00:48] [Music]
[2:00:56] amen
[2:00:57] god bless you all
[2:01:00] man i
[2:01:01] sometimes it's just so hard
[2:01:04] not to just get so serious and
[2:01:06] sincere i don't mean ever to be hard or
[2:01:10] to be
[2:01:11] whatever
[2:01:12] it is i am
[2:01:14] but when you think about what god's done
[2:01:17] when you think about the age we live in
[2:01:19] and the manifestation we've had and what
[2:01:21] god wants to accomplish
[2:01:22] [Music]
[2:01:23] listen there's no room for playing games
[2:01:27] and i sometimes i feel it stronger than
[2:01:29] others but sometimes i meditate and i
[2:01:31] think this is the hour this is the day
[2:01:35] this is what the whole world has been
[2:01:37] building up to
[2:01:38] this is the purpose for calvary this is
[2:01:40] why the blood was shed this is why i
[2:01:43] mean there's been seven church ages this
[2:01:45] is why a prophet
[2:01:47] it's it's all hinged on this moment in
[2:01:49] time
[2:01:51] and god has done so much to bring his
[2:01:53] plan of redemption to this time
[2:01:56] can we value it enough can we give
[2:01:58] enough to it can we bow enough pray
[2:02:01] there's nothing we can do enough
[2:02:04] all we can do is just give up
[2:02:06] and say god i
[2:02:08] i'm not even going to try
[2:02:10] to use my own mind i'm not even going to
[2:02:12] try to manipulate
[2:02:14] but i'm just going to say yea lord
[2:02:18] whatever you say
[2:02:19] let it be that way
[2:02:22] what did you say i should act like let
[2:02:24] it be that way
[2:02:26] however way you should say i should
[2:02:27] dress let it be that way however you say
[2:02:30] we should structure ourselves yea lord i
[2:02:32] don't know what else to do but say let
[2:02:34] it be that way
[2:02:38] it's it's serious
[2:02:41] but i believe when we
[2:02:43] when we get to the other side if there
[2:02:45] is any conversations like this i don't
[2:02:48] know
[2:02:49] if anybody says oh you came in the
[2:02:52] bright age you came out at the end oh
[2:02:54] how did you do it
[2:02:56] and we'll just be the we'll be saying
[2:02:59] i was predestinated not to fall
[2:03:02] it wasn't what i did it's what i
[2:03:04] surrendered myself to that he did
[2:03:06] through me it's the same thing that
[2:03:08] brother branham could say i was just
[2:03:09] standing near when he did it it's not
[2:03:11] the
[2:03:12] the seventh angel it was the mighty
[2:03:15] angel it was it was not a son of man it
[2:03:17] was the son of man amen it wasn't me he
[2:03:21] predestinated me it wasn't because i was
[2:03:23] great it's because he said i come at a
[2:03:25] time that i wouldn't fall he
[2:03:27] predestinated me not to fall it's all
[2:03:29] him not me
[2:03:30] [Music]
[2:03:32] and we recognize that let's just give
[2:03:34] ourselves to him
[2:03:37] sometimes we come across things in the
[2:03:39] message we don't understand why does it
[2:03:40] matter so much why
[2:03:42] does our family have to be structured
[2:03:44] this way why can a woman not wear this
[2:03:46] and do that
[2:03:48] and i said god bring me to a level of
[2:03:50] maturity where i can get beyond all
[2:03:51] those questions and say be it unto me
[2:03:53] according to your word
[2:03:55] if that's what you wanted and if that's
[2:03:57] what your prophet of the age said that's
[2:03:59] the way it's going to be
[2:04:01] because i
[2:04:02] believe
[2:04:04] have confidence in what god has done in
[2:04:06] this hour
[2:04:08] i want to surrender more
[2:04:10] god help me you pray for me
[2:04:13] and i'll pray for you
[2:04:14] that god can have his way
[2:04:17] sometimes i just sit back and i i
[2:04:19] meditate i think
[2:04:21] what would it be like
[2:04:23] if we were all
[2:04:25] able to give him absolute preeminence
[2:04:28] and obey perfectly the word on
[2:04:30] everything in our lives i think we would
[2:04:33] be shocked at what we would see
[2:04:36] but that's what we're coming to
[2:04:38] that's what he's bringing us that's what
[2:04:40] he's growing us to that's why we're
[2:04:41] laying in the presence of the sun so
[2:04:43] that he has absolute control i think
[2:04:45] it's going to be shocking the things
[2:04:46] that we'll see
[2:04:47] not when we get stronger smarter better
[2:04:50] louder but when we completely surrender
[2:04:52] to everything he said
[2:04:55] i think we'll see amazing things take
[2:04:57] place in our life
[2:04:58] that's my desire
[2:05:00] i believe it's yours
[2:05:02] god bless you as we dismiss and
[2:05:05] we go to fellowship
[2:05:06] i pray that the fellowship's a blessing
[2:05:08] to you may we fellowship on these things

[2:05:13] another to love into good works

[2:05:18] word to manifest the word to surrender
[2:05:20] to the word a stay in fellowship on
[2:05:23] these things
