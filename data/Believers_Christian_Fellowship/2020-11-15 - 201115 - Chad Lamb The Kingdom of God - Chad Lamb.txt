worship amen tell you it's a privilege to come together and worship his name you know no matter what we're going through we have things we go through things that we struggle through in life we should never stop praising his name he's worthy amen and we know that this too shall pass whatever struggle whatever difficulty whatever alarming thing is happening in our life now it'll pass but let's never miss the opportunity to worship his name in serving with our lives while we're standing let's take our bibles to mark chapter one it sounds like we're getting a fresh cleaning outside nobody will have to wash their cars later it'll be a blessing amen mark chapter 1 excuse me verse 14. mark 1 and 14. now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel may let savior's place there and let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we ask that you would lord just minister minister unto us this morning we know you're the only one who can break the bread lord we pray god you would do it for us you are the man the lord you are the you are the word that's come down from heaven lord and you can break that word to us this morning we ask that you use this gift that's here yielded unto you and that by that lord you would deliver to us the food that we have need of speak to our hearts lord teach us lord correct us admonish us encourage us with the word that we might continue to do as you want us to do in this life we might be pleasing to you lord set our feet on the right course lord that we may walk a word walk lord every step in obedience to your word by faith let your spirit lead us we pray this morning and that you may have preeminence among us in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated anyway i want to look at this scripture again also i forgot to mention brother uh ben siebold is up in michigan preaching for brother dan ratliff today so just remember him throughout the day and remember his family i believe they probably went with him but praise god so i know they'll have a good time up in michigan amen let's look back at here in mark chapter 1 verse 14. look at the timing it says now after that john was put in prison so jesus now after that john is put in prison he jesus comes into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god and saying the time is fulfilled amen or the time is complete or the time is full it's complete amen and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel because the forerunner ministry had to go first and now when john was in prison now he goes forth now he's declaring that the kingdom of god is here the kingdom of god is at hand amen and so and so we see that jesus now is is going through declaring the time is finished the time is full the time is complete amen just like revelations chapter 10 amen revelations chapter 10 the mighty angel comes down and said it'll be time no longer amen because the forerunner ministry had been finished and now it was time they meant for a dispensational change so now he says the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel let's turn over to luke 17 and look at another scripture luke 17 and verse 20. luke 17 and 20 and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation so jesus had told him the kingdom of god is at hand and it means to to come nigh to be near amen it's near you amen it's right here upon you god bless you sister man apparently you didn't go to michigan amen brother ben's family is here i was wrong amen luke 17 uh we want to continue on luke 17 20. he says the kingdom of god cometh not with observation they're saying you're looking for something but you're looking for the wrong thing amen the kingdom of god is drawn nigh it's near to you but you're looking around and you're saying where is it show us they're demanding of him the pharisees say where is the kingdom and he said the kingdom doesn't come with observation you're making a mistake in your assumptions amen and this has been the case all along and it's still the case today the kingdom cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you so jesus comes because the kingdom of god is in jesus christ he's coming and now the forerunner's ministry has finished and when john is now in prison now he goes into galilee preaching the kingdom of god saying the the time is now fulfilled the time is finished the time is complete and the kingdom of god is near you and the pharisees are begin looking about because they have ideas of what the kingdom of god coming means when the kingdom of god comes upon the earth amen it was supposed to to rid them of roman rule it was supposed to restore the kingdom of david it was it was supposed to bring them back to the glory that they had in the days of solomon there were natural things they were thinking their mind there was natural expectations now we have a forerunner and the forerunner now is going to usher in he's going to usher in the kingdom of god he's going to usher in the messiah and they had certain things in their mind that this messiah would do and when the kingdom the god drew nigh they began to watch because they're looking for an earthly kingdom they're looking for deliverance from rome they're looking for the restoration of wealth amen solomon made gold and silver common in the streets of jerusalem they were looking for that to return but they didn't realize what was coming was the promised word and it was worth more than gold in the streets there was more power coming than solomon had so then he says their conception is wrong and and jesus tells them back when we read in mark 1 he says the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel he's telling you the kingdom of god is near believe this gospel amen repent from your wrong thing you repent from everything amen and believe this god then they ask him now that we're in luke 17 you're asking well where is it amen show us uh the kingdom of god should come when it should come and jesus is telling us you know you're not even thinking right amen see they asked the question the question was when will the kingdom of god come they're asking for a time frame and jesus doesn't give them a time frame he gives them a location because he understood what the what their problem was their problem was they weren't believing that the kingdom of god was on earth at the time they were looking for it to come and so he answers their question correctly but not by answering their question because the entire conception in their mind was wrong so he doesn't go to the human conception in the mind and says when are you going to understand you back up there's types and shadows and if you go back to john's ministry no he just says he just answers the question in a way that raises them if there was a seed there would raise them out of the wrong thinking and he doesn't answer when he answers where because if you understand where you realize now the kingdom of god is not what i thought it was not maybe i had the wrong understanding you see the same thing's true the coming of the lord we can have when will the lord come what will happen and these things will happen and that will happen and we can totally miss what's happening and because we don't know the location we're looking for the time and if you don't pay attention to the time but you listen to what the prophet said about the location amen on the son of man and how the son of man will come and where the son of man will be amen when he unites with his church and what will it do it will reproduce the son of man again and now you realize hey maybe when i was looking for timing i had the wrong understanding i should have been looking for location of this coming because the location of the coming comes at the end of the forerunner's ministry amen in the end of the forerunners ministry he says now there's time no longer now time is fulfilled now there's no more time now we're moving in to that cycle so the so he changes their thinking and he doesn't give him a location or he doesn't give them a time when the kingdom of god should come he answered them said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation they were asking when and he was saying you don't even see it because the question at hand was not when the question at hand was where amen amen and i would say the same thing repeats today the question that not a hand is not when the question at hand is where if you can answer that question then you're going to see a lot of things amen neither shall you say lo here or low there for the behold the kingdom of god is within you let's go to john chapter 14. see i've marveled at the way jesus answers questions i've always marveled in the bible how jesus would answer the pharisees questions of the scribes or other individuals because it's not the way we typically answer questions but jesus was always getting to the heart of the matter always and now we look at john chapter 14 verse 16 it says i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you and now jesus amen to the carnal mind he speaks and riddles but if you have ego vision and can fly above the normal understanding of humanity everything he says makes perfect sense but he's telling them that that i'm going to send another comforter i'm going to pray the father he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him so he's doing the same thing to the disciples he says you know there's a there's a comforter coming from the father the spirit of truth the world won't receive him because they can't see him neither do they know him but you know him amen where where is the kingdom coming where is it where is it at you know him listen to this you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you jesus was standing there amen and the comforter he was the comforter the comforter was him it was the life of god it was the holy spirit and full measure was in him and he's saying the world can't see it because it's invisible it's like the wind they can they can they don't know where it comes from or where it goes and so is everyone that's born of the spirit of god they can see the effects but they can't see it and he said neither they didn't know him but you know him right and say how do i know him amen when you've seen me you've seen the father amen you're with it it is this spirit that you're going to receive you know it it's with you and it will be in you let's keep reading verse 18 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you now all of a sudden he's telling them what's coming well i'm going to pray to a father another being somewhere else he's going to send you a comforter another being somewhere else that comforter is with you now will be in you but i will come to you praise god he's beginning to clue them in on what's happening verse 19 yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you brother brahman said making them all one who's all one you him father all one amen so where is the kingdom going to be the kingdom of god it doesn't come with observation the kingdom of god is it within you brother ben says in 1963 the world is again falling apart he preaches this message by the same title or very similar titles uh just a little over a week apart but this one's from uh november 27th we've got a quote from the other one later said i knew heaven a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and first earth was pas will pass away but in this new heaven and new earth paul said over here in the book of hebrews 14 25 he said for we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved how did we get into it not by a religious system but a kingdom of god is within you the kingdom the king in his word is the same and it's within you the king in his word is the same and it's within you amen so when you receive the word you receive the king you receive the kingdom amen the king in the word is the same and it's within you vindicating the hour that we're now living in the promise that god made for this age here we are living with the king sitting in heavenly places watching him doing these things i'd like to turn to hebrews before i read the next quote hebrews chapter 12. if you'll come and read that with me hebrews 12 and 25 apostle paul is speaking and he says see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him to spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he has promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven so how did he shake the earth by his voice how will he shake the earth in heaven by his voice by another voice in this word yet once more signifying the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire so now the apostle paul saying just as when god spoke out in mount sinai it shook the earth it was so fearful that moses did tremble and he did quake and he feared but now there's another voice coming he'll speak again and he'll not shake just the earth but it'll shake heavens and earth so that everything that can be shaken shall be shaken but the apostle paul says but we've received a kingdom that cannot be shaken amen if we want to grab something that will not be shaken in this day there's only one thing that i know of that will not be shaken in this way and it is the kingdom of god amen it is the kingdom of god that's coming to the hearts of his bride now i'm going to pick up the other quote from the world is falling apart it says we are dead and our lives are hidden god through christ and not only that but we are raised with him raised up what in a system a denomination organization we are resurrected in the kingdom of god so that's your new birth amen by the baptism the holy ghost we're resurrected in the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is within you why all these man-made systems must fall not once more i'll shake the world but i'll shake heavens and those things that can that cannot be shook is what will remain and we receive a kingdom receive a kingdom that cannot be shook or moved that's the kingdom of god not a system not a political wheel not a denomination but a kingdom amen and his subject is dead to the systems of the world its subjects are dead to these organizations it's dead to these political systems it's alive and resurrected by the power of the king and now we're in a kingdom sitting in heavenly places with eternal with the eternal king enjoying eternal life by the eternal word going to eternal heaven forever to be with him hallelujah living in the presence of the king i love him i'm so glad to be one of them i'm so glad to be dead in christ and alive in the kingdom of god this is not my home we seek a kingdom we seek the king we're already in the kingdom we seek the king to come and the king quickly will come to his kingdom for we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved all these other things are falling apart america is falling apart europe is falling apart asia falling apart all the world is falling apart but we are in a kingdom an eternal kingdom it cannot be moved that quoted that last paragraph that quote is truer today than it has ever been the whole system is shaking down under the voice of god that is struck in this day it is shaking every system down amen there's so many times when we catch these human conceptions of something you know when a voice comes and that great voice shakes down and and a great thunder but we we start thinking of you know everything happening immediately happening at once but i'll tell you that voice is still sounding and that voice is still shaking and it's shaking in the world we're watching friends we're watching world and world systems and religious systems and everything else we're watching it crumble away i said america is falling apart europe is falling apart asia is fine i this is amazing all the world is falling apart but we're in a kingdom an eternal kingdom it cannot be moved what does that mean friends that means the world's falling apart but we're not everything all around us can be falling apart and be shaken like there can be you know atmospheres of uncertainty and that uncertainty can get closer and closer to us amen there can be still more fallout from the pandemics and other things and other tensions that are going on there can be many more things that take place and a lot more repercussions and more uncertainty either in this wave or another wave or another thing that strikes there whatever it is and that uncertainty can get closer and closer to home it can infect our employment our jobs and it can affect all kinds of things but but we are secure in a kingdom that cannot be shaken so everything all around us becomes start falling apart we've got to realize that it has to fall apart it's got to fall apart the world is falling apart brother venom said let it fall apart and we work so hard sometimes to hold things together what we need to do is resolve ourselves to the fact that it's going to crumble it's going to burn everything on this earth that is not redeemed as cannon fodder will be burnt over to create a bright new millennium for the bridegroom and the bride to step out on it's part of god's plan it's part of god's program god foresaw and god knew and then this is the way things have to be and we don't want to fret too much about the way things are going because it's the way things need to be you know you can get discouraged when we see news and things changing and and the culture changing and the laws changing and the politics changing you can become discouraged but but don't let that discouragement stay look back to the word and realize these things must be this way i'm encouraged amen i told somebody the other day you know you know the discussion was of gun control and and you know my i think my boys were asking me because they were a little bit nervous about losing their hunting guns and we love to hunt you know something as a family that we enjoy to do and to do that we enjoy our guns but i was talking to a brother and i said when they when they knock on my door and they change the laws and we're no longer allowed to have a gun and it's forbidden you know what i'm not going to be burying him in my backyard i'm not going to be storing up ammunition i'm not going to start a fight with the government because these things have to go that way i will take my gun in my hand i will forfeit it with a smile on my face because my days on earth are almost done i'm part of a kingdom that can't be shaking if you take this from me you'll never take the millennium from me you'll never take my position in security in christ you'll never take the peace that i have in my heart you can take privileges you can take rights amen you can take anything you want but you're not going to take the kingdom away the kingdom is here on earth it's in the heart of his bride everything else is moving in response to this bride's maturity if you're losing privileges it's your fault [Music] it has to be this way i just say if i could say it this way don't waste a lot of energy fighting for things that don't mean much don't waste a lot of energy fighting for stuff that is going to burn let's stick with the thing that cannot be shaken let's devote our time and attention and our heart into the very thing that'll bring us through the very foundation that we stand on the very rock that we are planted with amen the very thing that gives us peace when the storms roll all around let's pay attention to those things and if we have to relinquish some some rights we relinquish them because i i'm coming my inheritance is secure there's things that we're moving through and in order to get from here to that bright new millennium all chaos has to break out oh chaos has to break out amen and it's going to go on all around us and these things are going to be things that have to happen to move prophecy along we know that there'll be a greater tightening up and a squeeze to come to the bride there'll be a greater persecution and pressures that are going to come i mean we know that she's going to try to keep her from preaching going to try to shut the churches down and we'll successfully close the doors of churches we know that there's prophecy out there for that and if it's got to go that way amen we don't want to fret when it goes that way when things begin to tighten up and persecutions come and loss of rights and privileges come all we've done is confirm that brother branham was right that the prophet god sent us was correct and this is everything is clicking right on time these things has to be this way praise god you know so many so many things can trouble us if we lose focus of what really matters we can get so bothered and so bent out of shape and so angry and so frustrated and that's just the normal that's just a human i was reading a quote the other day where brother branham says we're we're we're not citizens from here we're citizens from heaven we need to act like that we're reflecting heaven with citizens from heaven but listen what he said he said now not our flesh our flesh is citizens of america but in our spirit our souls were citizens of heaven so that's why brother branham because he was a citizen of america he wouldn't break the speed limit sign you see what i'm saying he was subject to the place god put him in the flesh and in the flesh walk he was subject to certain things amen because of the place god put him under the jurisdiction and rule that god allowed to have over his life and he was he was beginning to explain this to that but you know america is falling away it'll collapse it'll crumble one day there will be no america but the kingdom of david the throne of david will be established on the earth and i'll be part of that kingdom because i'm a citizen from heaven so as the atmosphere changes and as the news changes and as things change don't get caught up in it you know it's i i've heard talk and people say you know george washington he was a christian man and he fought for this and that but that was george washington's day this isn't george washington's day you know god brother brahm called him a christian man and talked about him praying before he crossed valley forge but we know that there had to be an america there had to be an america there had to be but there had to be an america for the prophet to come out of there had to be freedom of religion for the message to go around god was using his tools god was using his people to bring about his purpose and he had christians in the early days want freedom and they actually rebelled against authority they've done all these things to create a united states of america they mentioned there could be religious freedom so that so that so that that the plan of god can move forward and the prophet could come from here we agree but this is not that day brother branham said america's refused its day of grace and he says i no longer pray for her well if he's not going to pray for her why fight for her right if the prophet is no longer going to pray for it why fight for but think about this maybe those godly men amen were fighting for religious freedom and all of that but it's still the very thing that they created is the very thing in revelation chapter 13 that will turn the world back to the b system so you've got to you've got to look at the whole picture of this thing and say you know it was it's so you know what what a glorious start to america and what a glorious foundation on christian principles god allowed all of that it had to come had to come on christian principles so that the beast amen the two horned beasts that came up amen the the civil and ecclesiastical two horns would unite in this beast that looked like a lamb but brother branham said was a buffalo that had to happen so god would move some of his children and by an anointing he would move them amen to to create an america create a scenario create this where religious freedom would be because there had to be a an ecclesiastical and a political horn so we don't want to go back and repeat what george washington did that was accomplished now we're in another day we want to find our purpose in this day what day are we and what are we in and what does god want us to do today if you think about even think about in the bible brother benham said that it was always a curse for a true israelite a hebrew to leave the promised land he said it was always a curse to leave the promised land and we know the story of joseph and his brethren joseph gets sold into bondage and he comes to the right hand of power amen and he calls for his father and his brothers to come back in the time of family says they'll take care of them amen jacob was not isaac was not so our jacob who became israel was not supposed to leave that promised land what could persuade him to come nothing but his son on the throne and he moved down there amen and they were blessed and they were prospered but it was that very move that would put them into bondage and they would become slaves because it had to happen to fulfill prophecy because he already told abraham that your children should sow jordan in a strange land for 400 years so just because that happened doesn't mean that israelites could always leave the promised land and be blessed amen they left the promised land god moved it that way because of his prophecy but it turned into bondage and this america turned into the beast of revelation 13. so let's not let's not be looking in a rearview mirror but let's be looking forward friends and saying what does god want me to do now i'd say what god wants me to do now is not look to anything that is going to be shaken but to focus on that kingdom that cannot be moved and let everything else go the way it's supposed to go and i pray that god will help me not to let my blood pressure go up one point and i need some help i need some help with this but i pray that god will help me not lose control of my emotions not get discouraged not be downcast and downtrodden when i see the whole world moving in step to the prophecy to the fulfillment of what the prophet told us was going to happen amen we should be looking up and rejoicing we should be saying praise god this is everything he said was going to happen what's happening amen the kingdom is coming the manifestation amen amen the kingdom is here but we're going to move from this phase to the next phase and that's a good thing for us friends so we're looking at a kingdom that cannot be moved in christ the mystery of god revealed brent says then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of god is within you said the bi says the bible jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in our own life so what is the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is the word is the word of god made spirit and life in our own life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and god was one and the word in god is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and to be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as adam and eve in the beginning in the garden of eden the threefold mystery of god his body so my question is is the kingdom of god on earth yes the kingdom of god is on earth the kingdom of god doesn't come with observation or lo here or lo there but the kingdom of god is within you it is the word of god made spirit and life through a new birth the word of god made spirit and life in you he says in the future home even the blood dropped it's yet got to be cleansed by fire he's talking about the redemption of the earth the blood dropped on the earth when jesus christ was crucified he was claiming it back paying the purchase price for all of creation but it says it's yet got to be cleansed by fire that's right for a dwelling place for god god already took up his abode potentially the kingdom of god is in the earth now in the hearts of his saints it's his attributes that he began in the beginning now his attribute is redeemed what's he waiting so this this is what i want to i want you to catch he says his attributes are redeemed the kingdom is here in the hearts of his people what's he waiting to redeem the earth so what's he waiting for to burn the earth right there's been a baptism of water and noah days a baptism with blood jesus christ is crucified but there'll be a baptism of fire and then he'll set the millennium in so he says what's he waiting to do to redeem the earth to set his attributes on it to fulfill exactly his predestinated plan do you see it we're at that time amen the kingdom of god is here the redemption has come to the bride amen the kingdom is here here the word of god has made spirit and life in her amen she is the manifestation of this hour amen she is here declaring the kingdom of god but what's he waiting for there's another step and that other step is the burning of fire amen to set the kingdom of david back on the earth and everything that's happening now is moving towards that again a future homie says when he went up out of the water he said i saw heavens open the prophet saw it he saw the heavens open and here come descending out of heaven a form of a dove and a voice saying this is my part of the earth that i have redeemed and from this part of the earth i will redeem the rest of it so now when the dove is coming which is the holy ghost god's coming amen in the river jordan when when when john is baptizing jesus sees the heaven open in a holy holy ghost in the form of a dove descending and resting upon jesus christ said then brother man says this is my part of the earth that i have redeemed because jesus body was made out of the earth but the holy fire of god coming down and was claiming and then redeeming and claiming this part of the earth so when john saw this scene take place it was the spirit of god claiming i'm claiming this part of the earth and from this part of the earth i will redeem the rest of it for he is my word made manifest in the whole world i spoke it into existence by my word hebrews 11 and satan has held it all this time but i've come to redeem it so much of it has made this body and i'm coming to dwell in it so i don't want you to forget that did he come down in the in the form of the holy ghost to claim this part of the earth and from this part of the earth he'll redeem the rest of it now i want to take a few minutes and i want to look at some scriptures so we're going to flip through the bible quite a bit here but let's turn the book of mark we're going to be in the first few books of the new testament here for a few minutes i want to take a look at the nature of the kingdom because the kingdom was on earth in jesus christ but they didn't know him neither did they see it they were looking for a physical rule of a physical king and the kingdom was here the the word of god made spirit and life in jesus christ and they missed it but i want to look at the nature of that kingdom in jesus christ because i want us to understand some things about ourselves because we know the kingdom is still here in the hearts of his saints so i want to understand it there so i can understand it here mark chapter 1 verse 9. john chapter or mark chapter one verse nine and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john and jordan and straight ray coming up out of the water he saw the heavens open in the spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness this is the part that i want to i want to focus on immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness and he was there in the wilderness 40 days tempted of satan and was with the wild beast and the angels ministered unto him so now this this great declaration comes i've redeemed this part of the earth and from this part of the earth i'll redeem the rest amen the the sign that john was told to watch for and now the nature of the kingdom coming amen the first thing that happens is the spirit driveth him into the wilderness leadeth him out into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil he realized the first thing that he does is not go and start smashing down a systems of man and go out and start the first thing he does is go and be tempted of the devil in the wilderness and and so many times i i think in our own ideas and our own approaches we hear quotes there's some powerful quotes out there about our position in christ about who we really are in our position in christ and there was nobody that had a position with god like christ had like jesus christ anybody have a greater position but that position didn't produce a life of ease and an exercise of power that would keep him from any suffering any hardship any subjection to the through the world and the system the world elements of the world that that kingdom coming that power that position that he had amen that did not build for him an earthly kingdom of great praise and adoration and comfort and easy living but that kingdom coming amen was the word and that it was the word made spirit and life amen and when that word was made spirit and life it had to go through a testing phase where it would go out into the wilderness away from mankind out alone to be tested to be tempted tested of satan and and i i wonder if the same thing can't happen to us we've got a glorious position we're in a kingdom that cannot be shaken all powerful almighty i mean the word of god that cannot be defeated amen and all of a sudden we see sometimes weaknesses we see trials we see difficulties amen and those trials and those difficulties the devil will come along and try to make you doubt that you're part of a kingdom doubt that you're part of an all-powerful almighty unshakeable unmovable kingdom because your whole life is falling apart and you're being tempted and tested in ways that are shaking you all around and everything's falling apart and the devil will try to make you a doubt or question whether or not you're in this kingdom because this shouldn't happen to the bride this shouldn't happen to people in the kingdom this shouldn't happen but it's the very thing that happened to jesus christ and if it happened to him won't it happen to us in the laodicean church age from the church age book he says a quick look at those scriptures which involve the lord jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in matthew 4 where jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the the personal temptations of satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials the the corresponding that corresponded exactly to the temptation in the garden of eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word he fell to personal temptation of satan by failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because the word can't fail that's an interesting statement that's the only way you can know that you're overcoming but in the trial in the testing when you're taking the word and driving back the enemy by the word you're just taking the word and you're just confessing the word because he's the high priest of our profession so you're saying by his stripes i'm healed and and by his stripes i'm healed it was paid for at calvary i resist you devil in the name of jesus christ because i'm a child of god and all the promises are mine and i'm healed in jesus name i'm already healed and none of the symptoms change and none of the symptoms change now you realize jesus didn't say this is how we know we're overcoming we'll know we're overcoming when the symptoms change brother brahm didn't he didn't say it that way and so we got to be very careful that sometimes amen see brother branham said this bride has to be tested like adam's bride was so if you're the bride if there's been a last adam a second adam and you're that part of that last adam that eve that bride that's united with him if you are part of that kingdom amen and that kingdom is in you you have to go to the same testing that eve went to and eve was tested amen and she was tested on three points the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and that is the testing that this bride is going under right now every day we're being tested lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life and the only way you'll know you're overcoming [Music] is because you take the word not because the temptation goes away and not because the trial ends and not because the symptoms change because true overcoming is true success amen is not just when the symptoms change and remember when something in you rises up and you take the word regardless of what your eyes see or your body feels or what's going on in your head and your emotional realm but you stay with the word and the word only that's overcoming and we get the wrong idea that this is a mighty victorious invincible army marching through you know we we get the wrong idea that overcoming is only when we're finally healed because we will be healed and that is overcoming but i tell you friends that's not that's not the way you know you're overcoming the way you know you're overcoming is you stay with the word because the word can't fail and we we hit times realize we all hit times in our lives where where things cycle we run through cycles brother man tells us all the time he makes it so clear that we run through cycles he said churches go through night cycles family go through night cycles he goes you'll be up on the mountaintop and down in the valley and all those things are to grow us you'll hit a time when answered prayer answer prayer answer prayer things are moving supernatural things are working in your life and then you'll go down into a time where you're praying the same prayer you believe the same things but it seems like nothing will move well was i overcoming there not overcoming here was that success in this failure absolutely not amen the only way you'll know you're overcoming is when you take the word because the word is the only thing that can't fail see we have to go to the testing friends we have to this bride has to be tested the same way eve was tested and you have to face it and the only way you'll know you're overcoming is if you stick with the word brother brahman says now he says that jesus gave us this example when he was tested this way lust of the eyes pride of life lust of the flesh he said listen he says satan taken him up in the temple whitewashed the scriptures for him said it is written again he taken him up on the mountain showed him all the kingdoms and jesus said it is written and he defeated the devil by the word of god never used any power at all listen this was the kingdom of god on earth this was the kingdom of god on earth and it was being tested in this man amen in the kingdom of god amen coming to earth it wasn't so god could show off powers it wasn't amen just it was being tested in a man to show that the word will not fail in this man it's the word test that's the greatest test he said defeated the devil by the word he never used any power at all bringing every devil divine blessing down in the reach of the humblest and weakest christian as long as you'll believe that that's the word of god and say it's written it'll defeat satan anywhere anytime on any conditions the word of god it certainly will in the patmos vision out of the church age book remember it says don't fear john don't fear little flock all that i am your heir to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it's yours to use you speak the word and i will perform it that is my covenant and it can never fail all power is mine and jersey used how by speaking the word by speaking the word and believing it all the way back in creation in the genesis account god spoke his word and had to believe his own word and to watch it come to pass now we believe his word we have to speak his word amen we're not here for fear we're not here to be troubled we're we're here to have love and joy and a security and an understanding but how do we defeat the devil how do we overcome in this day by speaking the word by staying with the word and letting him perform the word amen amen i think sometimes i just talk about me because i don't know about you sometimes we get discouraged because we want to see great manifestations of power great manifestations of power and great and i believe there'll be there are and will be and maybe many more manifestations of power in the bride i believe that spoken word all kinds of things but sometimes we get discouraged because we want to see more and then see more dynamic power and we're the bride and this is the word and all of that but the test amen the test comes on the back side of the desert when you're all alone and you're being tested can you stick with the word and stay with the word and watch him perform the word so that he gets all the credit for the supernatural so his powers on display so that his might is on display and so that he is glorified so much of our desire for great dynamics sometimes is just a desire for ourselves to be vindicated for ourselves to be declared you know uh whatever but that's not god brother branham says in 1961 in the message expectations is that a true great revival it don't get headlines and things like that no no there's one thing that jesus christ lacked in his life oh this is gonna be good there's one thing jesus christ lacked in his life i hate to say that but he did jesus lacked one thing a modern showmanship he wasn't a show-off no everybody today has got to have a great big headlines and bragging what they're doing that's a stuffed shirt that's right that's not a servant of god a servant of god will be humble keeping himself back oh this is amazing quote friends amen uh he wasn't a modern he didn't have any modern showmanship and brother bam says this several times that jesus was lacking something he lacked showmanship he didn't have any showmanship he didn't do anything for show he didn't do anything for the approval of man he only did what the father showed him to be pleasing to the father he did amen remember when brother brown tells us about him going down by the pool of bethesda and there's all kinds of halton lame and blind and crippled and they're there at the pool of bethesda and he steps over and steps around all the sick and all the lame and he goes to one man who's had a condition 38 years and he heals that one man and he leaves amen and brother bam said why he said because that's what the father showed him to do amen he wasn't there seeking attention he wasn't there for his own glory he was there the kingdom was on earth and it was the kingdom of god amen and it was not for show-off it wasn't it wasn't to play with amen it wasn't for just demonstrations of power that would bring glory to man it was for god's purpose god was working his purpose and everything must be done for god's purpose let's look at the bible i want to look at a couple places in matthew let's start in matthew matthew chapter eight verse three i'm going to read about four or five scriptures back to back here matthew chapter 8 verse 3. and jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou clean this is to a leper and immediately his leprosy was cleansed and jesus saith unto him see thou tell no man but go thy way and show thyself to the priests and offer the gift that moses commanded for a testimony unto thee what would happen to that in a modern pentecostal church let's go to mark chapter 7. mark chapter 7 and verse 34 and looking up to heaven he sighed and he saith unto them ephitha that is be open and straightway his ears were open and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain and he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he charged them so much the more the great deal they published it what was jesus approach he just he just opened the ears and the tongue of a deaf mute and he says don't tell nobody let's look at mark chapter 8 verse 29 8 29 he says unto them but whom say ye that i am and peter answered and saith unto him thou art the christ and he charged them that they should tell no man of him luke chapter 8 go over to luke chapter 8 and verse 54. luke chapter 8 verse 54. and he put them all out and he took her by the hand and he called saying made arise and her spirit came again and she arose straightway and he commanded to give her meat and her parents were astonished but he charged him that they should tell no man what was done let's go to john chapter five i think you're getting the point but we'll read one more just to seal the deal john chapter 5. verse 19 then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things so ever he doeth these also doeth the sun likewise but then use this scripture over and over to tell us that jesus was led by vision he didn't just go out randomly doing whatever he wanted to do he did what god led him to do for god's purpose god's way and when he would do something he would tell the people often times now don't tell anybody peter and them caught the revelation he was the christ he said don't tell anybody he raised the dead don't tell anybody open the deaf ears don't tell anybody see jesus wasn't showing off he wasn't there for himself he was there for god and i longed to get to the place where i'm not living this life for myself but i'm only living it for god where i say you know what by his stripes i'm healed that i'm delivered in the name of jesus christ but if god chooses to delay my healing then god be praised there's a purpose in it and i want to be delivered amen but if god doesn't want me delivered then praise god there's a purpose in it amen i mean there's a purpose in what god's doing and i want to be satisfied in his purpose but i want to be so sure that i'm part of that kingdom that that kingdom is within me that i know every move in my life is orchestrated by god what he allows and he doesn't allow is according to his will and i want to be satisfied with his will in my life and all i want to do is take his word and speak it and let him perform it amen we've got a right to claim the word whatever situation comes upon us amen it's for us amen to overcome by the word it's a testing by the word we must take the word and fight back devils take the word and resist the enemy amen but let the power of god bring it to pass it's not for us to prove what we are it's to prove that this word is works and we stand with the word the proving of the bride amen is not the demonstration of power because the pentecostals can demonstrate power but the proving of the bride is that she stays with the word praise god let that be our satisfying portion let the word be our satisfaction let the revelation of the word be our satisfaction and let god do whatever he wants to do in 1953 brother branham is talking about a situation that they face in the campaigns and he says one time it happened to be one of my managers not brother baxter but it was a man who was with us one of the field managers and a newspaper had made a very critical statement that was absolutely untrue i can expect friendly criticism but criticism wasn't due because it was untrue as long as it's true all right praise god brother man i'm saying if you criticize me telling the truth that's fine but then he says listen but the criticism wasn't due because it was untrue as long as it's truth all right but it wasn't true and this manager said why don't you go out there and kneel on your knees and tell god to burn that place down and i said oh brother don't think he said what we need today is some more elijahs he was talking to elijah he was talking to elijah but he had his own idea what power was his own idea of what standing up for the word was he had his own concept of what he what should be done in this situation and it had nothing to do with the mind of god he said what we need today is some more elijah said elijah would have called fire out of heaven said he would have done what he would have done to the fifty well the brother was just mistaken see elijah did not call fire out of heaven only but when god showed him he said oh brother branham said elijah just went out there and boldly challenged and said come out and prove who's god i said no he never god told him first oh he said he never seen no vision i said yes he did i said when he said when he put all his bull lock and so forth on the altar and had poured the water upon it he walked out and he said god i have did this at your command is that right then the fire began to fall after he had completed everything this is this this christian brother amen he was a field manager in the campaigns he had the wrong idea of what it was to have power in the kingdom of god he had the wrong idea of how to use the power of god and how to use the gift of god and he was totally making a blunder of it but brother branham had had enough experiences that he knew what to do amen the same thing jesus christ did he only did what the father showed him only when god said only when god told him he wasn't going presumptuous he wasn't going amen out of anger he wasn't going out of frustration he was going obedient to the word of god see jesus he was tempted in the wilderness but he only used the word none of his power he had zero showmanship he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't elevating himself amen he was there to fulfill the purpose and will of god he was in total submission to the father i believe he laid a pattern for you and i i was thinking when i was looking at this i was thinking about brother branham's life brother brandon life early on in his campaign in his ministry he had one of his managers one of his good friends one of his campaign managers come and steal his magazine and steal his tent from him and he had a gift and with that gift he knew what the man was doing see he didn't misuse his gift he didn't misplace the gift or the word he kept it in submission to god he knew when that man was coming he knew that man was coming to steal his magazine and steal his tent and it was and then brother come and he said i got some papers for you to sign will you sign them and brother brahma showed up and he began to he began to sign the papers and he just signed them just as nice as you please knowing exactly what was happening but if god didn't tell him to say nothing he's not saying nothing if god wanted him to lose his tent he was willing to lose his tent if god wanted to lose his magazine he was willing to lose his magazine oh friends can we get to the same place that if we prayed and committed to god and god wants us to lose our job then we want to lose the job if god wants us to lose some prestige he wants us to lose friends then that's if that's the will of god if that's what god wants i'm part of the kingdom i'm on the foundation there's something i'm solid i'm in the unshakable unmoving kingdom of god but god is the head of this kingdom amen and his word is going to come to pass and he's going to display his word through whatever means he wants and if he's got to take me around the cow shed several times so that he can show his word off then that's what i want i don't want to come up with my own mind what i need to do is i need to stomp down there and i need to do this and i need to do that what you need to do is just say i believe you god i believe your word i believe you're my deliverer i believe you're my healer i believe i was healed amen from before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain amen i believe that when he was nailed to that cross he was paying the price for my healing and i accept it now in jesus name and if you want it to come instantly if you want it to come later whatever you want amen i'm satisfied with your leadership in my life if you want me to live in a nation that crumbles that's where i want to be if you want me to live in an america that begins a religious persecution then this is where i want to be jesus didn't fight back you realize he had all power when they come when they come to throw him off a cliff all he did was mask himself in some way from their eyes where he passed through the crowd he didn't fight them back he didn't stop them when he was arrested he went willingly because he had already wrestled it out in gethsemane he had already submitted himself to the will of god amen when they come to arrest him he wasn't fighting he wasn't screaming threats he wasn't angry in his trial he wasn't angry he wasn't upset even pilate was amazed at no answer and he says why won't you answer me don't you know i have power to give you life and my power to take your life and he says you have no power unless it's given to you from above oh maybe god's training us for that kind of response maybe we're in training right now through the highs and the lows the goods and the bad amen the supernatural display and the subtle moving of god all of these things that are happening in life maybe it's training till we get to the place where i said i'm in the hand of god i remember i was listening to a brother from ireland a missionary from brother uh from ireland he was giving a testimony and he got had gotten arrested um somewhere in asia i don't remember exactly where it was and brother ron garvin was with me we were listening to this and he was preaching he was saying they they they arrested him they were questioning him and they made a statement along the lines and saying you know your head is in the mouth of the lion they were threatening him and scare him your head is in the mouth of the lion and he says and if you're able to close your mouth you better. because he realized he was in the hand of god he was in the hand of god amen this bride she's not forgotten he hasn't forgotten us amen he hasn't he hasn't mislocated you and he hasn't lost your gps signal he's not punishing he's not we are being tested friends and the only way that we know we're overcoming is when we stick with his word let's go to revelation chapter 5. i envisioned so many times in my own daydreamings and my own surmising i envision the way i want to preach i mean if you could ever jump in my mind and see the imagination you'd be shocked and what i would like to do if i had my own way is just show the power of god on display and i'd love to just preach it i mean with so much authority and so much revelation and just so much power and see amen and just point out you here you're delivered this and that and that that's my imagination that's what i want to see to see something tangible to see something move you know brother i'm on tape there's a tape where you can hear the wind of god move through the auditorium and roar it happens twice oh god i want to hear that i don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to hear that don't don't get me wrong but that's always our nature we want to hear that amen but the real overcoming comes in the silent time there were there were thousands there in that auditorium that day that heard that and never moved them a bit to believe the word then there was those who were there when brother brennam was calling out diseases and showing amen that that are greater than solomon is here he was showing that there's a man here that can turn on the light by the revelation of the word he's turning his back to show that the same one that was on the plans of mamrie with abraham was here in this service and he was doing those things preaching by revelation that would just it was astonishing and it didn't move the heart of all the people that were sitting there they stayed in their unbelief amen but god he wants a people that'll stick with the word whether it's dynamic or subtle whether it's noisy or quiet and he wants the people that'll be happy with all of it as long as it's the word we're happy with all of it so if you could climb into my imagination you'd be astonished you're like brother chad praise god but you see that would be me that would be my desire and that would be destined for failure but what we do is we just take god's leadership it's subtle sometimes sometimes you're preparing for service and it's just one thought and subtle and it's not dynamic and you look at it and you begin to work in the word and you begin to look at what brother branham said and you begin to meditate and brother bam starts to all right brother man starts to disclose what the scripture means and and god begins to open it up into your understanding and you'll be like but that's so simple i can't take that to the people where does that thinking come from friends if that's god's inspiration no matter how quiet or how subtle it is that's the very word that must be preached that day and if it doesn't have us standing up in our seats waving our handkerchiefs and shouting it doesn't mean that it's not effective in changing the lives of the people that are hearing you we have to be careful that we don't look for our own humanistic ideas and our own wants and our own desires but we're willing to take it the way god brings it amen and for me that's been a personal challenge because sometimes it's so subtle sometimes it's it's just sometimes it's so breathtaking that i can't wait to come here and share because it's absolutely astonishing it's taking my breath away sometimes it's like but this little thought we've talked about it a thousand times and i pray god surely god do you want and i'll labor in prayer and all of a sudden you realize god's saying a thousand and one. and we as a people got to get to the place where we're not questioning his every move amen we have to be secure and say god is god and he's doing with us what he wants i'm my foundation is sure because i have a sure foundation the kingdom of god is within me and i'm going to watch and see what god wants to do and however he wants to do it is the way i want it done let's look at revelation chapter 5 verse 1. i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof i want to look at this verse whenever i get into revelation chapter 5 i just want to preach and preach and preach and preach but there's one thought that i want to bring to you john's weeping because he knows that all redemption is lost if there's no man that can take this book one of the elders say unto him weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed this lion this root of david this great king he has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god set forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne this picture to me is so perfect because john knows that redemption is lost and he's weeping but the elder says don't worry the lion of the tribe of judah the root and offspring of david the great one the prophesied one the mighty one the king that'll be king of all creation amen he has prevailed when he started using terms like lion amen and and and rooting offspring of david and prevailed john turned to see this lion and what did he see a tore up beaten bloody lamb you have to ask yourself what is prevailing what is overcoming how did jesus win the greatest victory that was won on earth for our redemption he didn't do it as a lion he did it as a lamb and humble submission to the will of god if he had to suffer for redemption he would suffer for redemption and john turns to see this great king he turns to see this mighty victor he turns to see the one who has prevailed and he sees a bleeding bloody lamb sometimes i want to see the mighty bride who can't be defeated i want to see the invincible army i want to see the manifestation of the spoken word i want to see i want to see amen this queen of heaven i want to see this this queen united with her king the one who's coming to authority and power in the i want to see this one i wonder i wonder what it would look like to have prevailed to be in this age a bride who prevails over the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life how will we prevail i think if christ prevailed as a lamb maybe we'll prevail as a lamb maybe it may not be the bold and the dynamic it might be the humble daily submission to the word of god taking whatever comes and believing god anyways every upset an obstacle and trial taking it and believing anyhow and to where god amen he can look back and say devil you've thrown everything you can throw at her you've thrown cancer and family troubles divorce issues amen there's been all kinds of abuses there's been everything that you can possibly throw at her amen and look just as humble and just as humble as i was when i was in flesh she stands there and she says but the word says but i'm his but he's redeemed me but the kingdom of heaven is within me but i am part of the bride i believe regardless of what you throw at her devil she believes anyways because the only way you can really overcome is to stay with the word isaiah 53 says of jesus he was opposed and he was afflicted he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened on his mouth he's brought us a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shares is dumb so he opened not his mouth what was he doing he was gaining the victory he was prevailing the message proving his word 1964 brother braham says now we find that god come into this little cell and he began to develop cells drew from his mother's vitamins and things that she said didn't even become old enough to eat himself he began to eat what was it it's the dust of the earth which you come up and plant life and animal life and so forth and as you begin to eat the fish and the bread and so forth it began to develop cells and then when it's fully matured at 30 years old he was baptized in obedience to john down there or to god and the water went out and what happened the dove which was god descended from heaven and a voice saying this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell what did he come to do to redeem that part of the earth he was the beginning of the creation of god because god is not a creation only in christ he is a creation because god is an eternal and a spirit and a spirit is not created he was the beginning of the creation of god and god redeemed that body see when he come down this is my beloved son i'm well pleased in him so he god come down after after going through this and now every son that you eat and born of natural sex birth the way you come then when it comes to a place to where you go through water baptism then the holy ghost baptism then the holy ghost comes down at the fire baptism and claims this creation the same as it did him now brother graham's taking what happened in jordan and then when the dove come down in the form of the holy ghost and said upon him he said i'm claiming redeeming claiming this part of the earth to redeem the rest now when that holy ghost comes down upon you it's doing the same thing it's claiming you and then the holy ghost comes down at the fire baptism and claims his creation the same as it did him the holy ghost and god is the same spirit see and it comes down and claims this body for the resurrection and he was raised for our justification all the father has given me will come not one will be lost i'll raise it up at the last day not one hair of the head will even perish that is the beginning of the creation of god he's pointing back to the jordan that is the beginning of the creation of god this is the continuation of the creation of god what's happening with the holy ghost baptism when when god uniting with you amen it's a continuation of the creation of god it's the kingdom of god within you so then this is the continuation of the creation god then the whole earth has to have a baptism then next the whole earth has a baptism so we know the holy ghost came back in full measure on the church at the opening of the seals under the end time messenger's prophet prophecy under his missed ministry and he come down to claim a bride what it is the continuation of the creation of god and whatever nature that that kingdom had when it was on earth then that kingdom has to have the same nature now brother branham come as a wave chief of that and if you look at brother branham's life we we talked about his tent was stolen and his magazine was stolen and he let it go he didn't fight for it because god told him didn't tell him to he was used by at the end of his ministry he was used by the the christian businessman just to gather a crowd brother brahm said sometimes you know they'll put your name on the bulletin just to get your friends to come they were just using his name to gather a crowd and then they would switch it and say well we've only got one night for you only one meeting they were using him amen but what did he do he still went with the christian businessman he didn't fight he didn't use his gifts and his powers amen to to straighten them up and correct them and make them change their ways if that's what god wanted that's what he wanted in one meeting they they lied about him and his sick brother they had a meeting just to gather the people and brother branham they wanted him to change his teaching his doctrine and he wouldn't change it amen and they come to the poop and say uh reverend william branham can't speak tonight because his brother's sick and he was standing there by the door waiting to go in waiting to go in and what did he do he turned and walked away because he was a lamb led to the slaughter he had no form no beauty that we should behold him he was oppressed and he opened not his mouth he was afflicted and we esteemed him not brother man he you think about it he was the word made flesh the prophecy of malachi 4 of revelation 10 7 of luke 17 30 standing there in the flesh the very word of god materialized into a flesh being right the very son of man was working through this son of man and yet he could suffer and be humble be persecuted amen be ridiculed be made fun of be rejected have his tent stole from him amen be light about to gather crowds and what would he say and do about it nothing he used none of his powers for himself none of his gift for himself he was a lamb led to the slaughter remember when the the ir the irs case the tax case opened back up remember they thought they had it settled and he he got a check and he put in the bank and they opened up the tax case and he was talking to a brother brother lee vale brother level says why do you put up with that and this and that and all of that and he told him just he said brother i think you're just a little too quick on the trigger and then he was he was going back home and he went back home and he got into the house and his wife was upset and somebody said something all that tax collector and brother benham said leave him alone maybe god told him to do that leave him alone maybe it wasn't none of this don't you know who i am i'm the servant of god i'm the prophet for the age he never exhibited that kind of attitude friends and neither did jesus christ you know jesus never said any bad thing about the roman government i don't remember reading anything that jesus said that was negative about the roman government oh man let that be a correction for us friends jesus wasn't worried about the roman government the roman government was there to accomplish god's purpose it had to be there they were there to crucify him because it's going to be rome that crucifies the word all through the church ages it all is in place it all has to be there man jesus is not amen saying horrible things about rome about the oppression amen he's not he's not blasting it because it has to be there to accomplish god's purpose and then he's satisfied with it being there i tell you what a rotten corrupt political system in government in america is not anything to fuss about it's perfect it's perfect friends it's what god needs at this time to accomplish his word if we get too much on the flesh side because his flesh and the flesh were citizens of america so when we start boiling over about politics and we start getting upset about the unrighteousness and the and the corruption and and and all of this stuff uh it's a clear indicator we've moved over to the flesh and i don't say they criticize you amen that's me too and so just as soon as we start i mean the blood pressure goes up and how can and unbelievable and these things and all of a sudden we're in the flesh because in the spirit in the soul we're citizens of heaven and in my citizenship in heaven there is no compromise there is no there's no corruption there's no false leadership i mean there's no lying there's no cheating no stealing everything is fine i am completely satisfied with the kingdom of god with the kingdom of heaven and my citizenship there and in the flesh god's placed me here for this time for a reason god has positionally put me here and if god wants me to be here subject to an unrighteous government that is corrupt and will bring a religious persecution then there's no other place on this planet that i want to be that's a mouthful but that's where jesus was he was right in the grip of rome rome was compromising with the jewish religion to hold a precarious position of power and there was a there was a religious forces and political forces that were working together pilate was stuck in this conundrum where he's trying to to to have rule and power without an insurrection but he's got all these pharisees and all those in the temple causing so much trouble and there's all kinds of political maneuvering hypocrisy corruption i mean israel was full of it in that day full of corruption i mean the high priest when when when jesus resurrects the the guards that come back to the high priest and tell them that the body's gone we saw an angel rolled the stone away and the body was gone they gave them money this is the priesthood gave them money talk about corruption you can't get any more corrupt than that gave the soldiers money to lie about the resurrection of jesus christ you can't find more corruption than you found in jerusalem in the day jesus was there but jesus wasn't worried about it because it was all on time it was the way it had to be the corruption amen in the religious system the corruption in politics the roman rule it was all perfectly set in place amen for the son of god to step on the scene and do what he had to do in obedience to his father and take all kinds of abuse and name calling being misunderstood called wrong names and he didn't do anything to fix any of that he just kept doing what god told him to do humbly what was that that was the beginning of the creation of god what is this this is the continuation of the creation of god god has a certain nature to him brother branham says in things that are to be there's a few quotes i want to read in a row just to highlight this continuation of the creation of god and then we'll wrap up now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour that was the beginning of the creation jesus christ was the manifestation of that hour but now there's a manifestation in this hour and it's jesus christ in bright form and you and i the kingdom of god is within you and it's got to have the same nature it's got to operate the same way as it did in that day the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living we're here to show the attributes of god in invisible union he says and you remember when i went down and the grain began to ripen that you find before that grain can ripen everything in that stalk has to be dead hallelujah can't you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same jesus in bright form same power same church same thing same word the same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head here and all that life that come through here picked it picked up its people now it's forming up into a head for the rapture the same jesus in bride form what was he a lamb led to the slaughter he was oppressed and afflicted in the open not his mouth he was subject to the powers that were around him to the authorities that were around him why because that's what the father wanted christ is the mystery guard revealed and when the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing could be added or taken from it so that same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one they are husband and wife they are flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of his spirit see amen how do you know it bears the same record same fruit same word manifest christ same life same god same spirit same word same book amen same signs these things that i do shall you do also oh hallelujah god is good god is good he says in god's provided place of worship the church will come through justification through luther through sanctification through wesley through baptism of holy ghost or the pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the son of man that when the husband and wife shall be the same self person remember when brother branham was here he was the wave chief of what's coming and in the wave sheath amen he was a son of man revealing the son of man and there was a son of man ministry on earth and that man and that son of man ministry was subject to tax laws how did he get in trouble tax laws by going out and preaching the gospel he was preaching amen and during preaching they were giving money and he didn't know how to handle the money and he was just signing it all to himself and paying all the bills and they were giving him credit for receiving all these offerings and now he was delinquent on taxes amen amen brother venom couldn't do anything about it he didn't call fire down from heaven he just subjected himself to it and when it looked like they were wrapping things up and they opened the case again and they got upset with them somebody from his family or somebody was with him got upset with the tax collector he said leave him alone maybe god told him to do that and god was so pleased there was a question between him and his wife whether they should go back to arizona or come back to jeffersonville and god was so pleased with his answer that he actually flashed words on the wall says come on back to arizona and a supernatural display of the hand of god putting writing on a wall he said come on back answering the question so perfectly what moved god it was the humility of this servant who had said leave him alone maybe god told him to do that we want to see supernatural in our lives i let's i say let the supernatural come through extreme humility let god do for us what we can't do for ourselves and not work it up and pull it down and pump it up but through simple humility and submission walk with god and let god work the supernatural he's doing it friends all the time healing upon healing testimony upon testimony we could go around the room and testify all day long about supernatural things that are happening in our life but it's so humble the world doesn't know anything about it so supernatural but so humble because it takes the nature of the lamb it goes right on down into the perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self person god will be so manifested in his church his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at but the remember says in stature of a perfect man from 1962 he said so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and they're under souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection that when christ does come they're waiting for the church to come to perfection sometimes our vision of that church coming to perfection is different than what maybe god's idea of a church coming to perfection is for for us sometimes in a human idea we want to see operations and manifestations which those are part of every church the the manifestations of the gift of the spirit must be part of our lives and must be part of the church but sometimes we get focused too much on that and not realize that sometimes the most supernatural things that happen in our life are subtle and nobody sees it nobody knows about it things that are changing within us amen attitude our our whole being our whole mind our whole response is lining up with the lamb over and over and over again and you're coming into that reflection of jesus christ in bride form and it's happening so so uh subtly by degrees amen it's happening but it's happening so sure friends but so subtly by degrees and not big flashes and not big things but decision by decision day by day all of a sudden your life is lining up with the life of jesus christ and it's jesus christ in you more and more and more and it's one of the most supernatural things that can happen on this earth but it doesn't always get the fanfare it doesn't always get celebrated like it ought to when we make the right choice and suffer when we could bypass suffering we make the right choice and not speak back amen when we had every right to correct the wrong but god didn't tell us to so we feel checked and we just be quiet these are great victories friends because she's got to have the same life and the same spirit as jesus christ it's jesus christ brother branham says in the smyrna church age out of the church age book why does he stand by the reason is in in romans 8 17 to 18 and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with them that we may also be be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift amen i i wonder i wonder what god's wanting out of us and i wonder if it's not his own character on display the very nature the very life life of his life word of his word spirit of his spirit when we say that and we'll do exactly what he did the works that i do show you do also and we believe in all of those but we get we get so lopsided that we only think of the supernatural in miracles we don't we don't see the humility the submission the suffering that's also his works that's also what he did in obedience to the father those things are just as important character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same bases that he overcome and sat down on his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation hallelujah i can identify with that you know when jesus christ come there was a forerunner here telling him this great messiah is coming calls him out identifies him this is the one and then jesus goes about into his ministry amen and there's many wonderful things that are done in the ministry of jesus christ healings by the droves and all kinds of stuff but you realize even with all that happened it somehow did not match john's expectation of what was coming until john looked at the humility of jesus christ amen the total humility of him with all the supernatural things and the healings and all of that he looked at the humility and he had an expectation even of his own prophecy and he asked a question he sends the side and says are you the one or do we look for another what was confusing him amen his own expectation of what he should see and he wasn't he he was looking at the humility and christ wasn't becoming a king and he wasn't taking over and he wasn't driving out the romans and he he was just doing what his father told him to do and he says he'll thoroughly purge his threshing floor his fan is in his hand and you'll thoroughly purge his threshing floor and when he begins to talk like that you begin to see he's going to drive out brother man says he's going to drive out all the romans clean out the sanhedrin reestablish the proper worship and bring the throne of david on the scene and they didn't realize his fan was in his hand he was thoroughly purging his threshing floor because he was demonstrating the word amen and the seed was staying and the chaff was going away he was doing in great power the work that god had sent him to do and it was a powerful work and he was doing it through great power but it was the simplicity of the demonstration of the word and then in the word that he was speaking and it was keeping the seat on the threshing floor and driving away all the chaff until he drives away and drives away and drives away and drives away until he only has a little seed left and it looks like he's losing his ministry it looks like it's going downhill brother bam would he would begin to describe it and dramatize and he said we don't have the great meetings that we have the campaigns are we don't track the crowds the campaigns are diminishing we had the thousands left when they didn't understand what you were saying he was giving them the revelation of the word they didn't catch it and they left unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood hard saying left he begs it harder what's he doing he's bringing the revelation to the word because he knows that the word can't leave the word the seed can't leave the word even if they don't comprehend what he's saying the seed can't leave the word and he gives it again and the 70 leave and the great campaign's leaving brother branham is describing his own ministry and he went out in 46 47 48 49 50. great campaigns he couldn't get to enough places and they couldn't find places with enough seats and you look at that and you say that's it that's it that's the move of god that's the power of god on display that's jesus christ return to the earth again and you don't even realize amen when we really get down to the real display of jesus christ with a fan in his hand it's a man amen in a brick tabernacle the corner of eighth and pin street and been breaking the seals down to a people who will stay and hear it amen he was the forerunner for running this great coming amen christ comes now to take the book and open the seals and he's doing it in such humility in such simplicity that people are like go ahead uh okay all right we're waiting he said i already preached it [Laughter] amen you can in this day we can we can have in our own minds we can say where is this great manifestation of the bride where is this bride that is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life spirit of his spirit all his power is now in her they're united together the kingdom on earth where is it it's right here friends i'll declare here's part of it right here it may not be flashy it may not do what you think it will do amen but there's people here that are part of the kingdom of god the bride of jesus christ that have united with the bridegroom that are flesh of his flesh life of his life bone of his bone spirit of his spirit blood of his blood brother said and they're here with the same life he had and what are they doing they're just humbly sticking with that word and not exchanging that word for any human idea for any pleasure for any anything of this world say did i miss the bride you didn't miss the bride only if your expectation of what he said was wrong how do you know you're overcoming the only way to overcome is to stick with the word because the word's the only thing that can't fail is it is this the bride or do i look for another you see things don't change friends these patterns roll on and on things don't change but i expected what did you expect well i thought by these statements they're all true but don't just get your expectation in the wrong spot watch how he come through jesus christ watch how he come through brother ben watch just watch how he come through every prophet and the apostles but ministry was drying up finished just when it was finished in the eyes of all those who saw great campaigns and wanted the great campaigns when they saw it diminishing his friends left him they accepted his funny doctrines as long as there was tons of miracles and gigantic crowds but when it began to diminish and pull back amen they weren't so comfortable with his doctrines anymore when it looked like the power and the prestige when it looked like the mighty thing that would come and drive back the enemy amen when it looked like it had failed amen it wasn't the word that was their attraction it was the power that was on display was their attraction and they didn't realize the root of all of that power was the manifested word and the root of all power is the word friends and if we've got the word we've got all power it's not about oh i want to see this and i want to see that stick with the word and you'll see everything you need to see and you'll see supernatural things in abundance if you stick with the word don't go chasing supernatural things the supernatural thing is the revelation of the word stick with the word and the supernatural will follow will come amen you see there's a scripture in hebrew says talks about the heroes of faith and says they without and us are not yet made perfect are showing that there's a waiting for us there's a finishing up they without us are not yet made perfect but did you ever go read through that list they were afflicted tormented what are we finishing if you go back and read the list amen they without us are not yet perfect we're finishing this great chapter of the heroes of the faith and the chapter of hebrews we're finishing that we're completing that but what did it look like rejection tormented afflicted they were in caves and dens of the earth and they were tormented and then they were killed they were slain they were sown asunder what is this it's the kingdom of god coming amen it's elect of god coming through the ages amen what is that what are we finishing we're finishing that friends it was never recognized in this day it always looked like it was in weakness and come in humility but yet they without us are not yet finished praise be to god romans 8 35 says who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or neckiness or peril or sword all of a sudden you look at that and you say what if you've given your life to jesus christ you should be able to bypass all of that and the apostle paul is not expecting a bypass for any of it he said even if these things come tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness or perilous sword it will not separate us from the love of god love of christ as is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter we want to be mighty but i think sometimes our our might is best expressed in our humility our might and our power and our strength is expressed in the ability to surrender to the word because how many billions of people on the planet cannot surrender to the word what's the power what's the strength what's the might to be able to subdue this flesh to bring it subject to the word that's power that's might for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord the message desperation brother branham says the devil can impersonate any of those things but he cannot be the holy ghost he can impersonate those gifts but he cannot be the holy ghost and the holy ghost is the token that the blood has been applied because it follows the blood all the way from the book of redemption see that was the purpose of his coming that's what he followed in every age every age he has followed that to see that it's brought forth and they could not be made perfect without us and now the entire holy spirit visits the church making god in human flesh i could read that quote in a different way than the context of what i'm preaching and you can get people to stand in their seats and shout and wave their hands because it's an amazing quote think about it and now the entire holy spirit visits the church what when it when the chains were removed from it at the opening of the seals at the evening time message and now the entire holy spirit visits the church making god in human flesh that's an amazing quote the entire holy spirit visits the church this church at the end time the whole measure of the holy ghost comes at the fullness of the word making it god in human flesh and i can preach that in a certain way under a certain vein and i can take certain scriptures and certain quotes to make us to make us go wild friends and it's just as effective it's true i get excited in other contexts but now when you go in the context when the entire holy spirit was in flesh the first time when the entire holy ghost was in flesh making god in human flesh that was in the life of jesus christ and what did we see we saw rejection we saw affliction we saw suffering we saw a lamb led to the slaughter and now in the context of what we're saying this should thrill our hearts we should be absolutely thrilled and say nothing can harm us no weapon formed against you shall prosper that's absolutely the truth but that is not talking about your flesh there are weapons that can prosper over you in the flesh but nothing can touch your soul nothing can touch your life nothing can happen outside the will of god if god didn't allow it it can't happen nothing will harm you that's the truth nothing will harm you but that doesn't give you an invincibility in yourself it gives you an invincibility in the plan of god in the will of god and in the purpose of god not your flesh your flesh suffers your flesh gets sick but nothing can touch that soul nothing can take you nothing can hurt you nothing can by any means harm you why because i have a heavenly father and he already made a plan but now the entire holy spirit visits the church to make god in human flesh i say god that's the truth but i want to act exactly the way you did the first time that holy ghost was in human flesh i want to act the same way i want to be just as reverent submissive humble faithful bold i want to be everything that jesus christ was as he did before sodom the burning there which was a type then then then abraham he appeared to him i'm sorry he says now the entire holy spirit visits the church making god in human flesh as it did before sodom because god came down and took on human flesh when he went to the plains of memory and now he's done the same thing again and all these and all the things that he hasn't done now through the ages in the church ages he is now doing back to the word because the messages and the messages and the messages has to wind up in the entire word and in the last days the seven seals being opened was to pick up every straggle that's been left off in it and make the whole thing in one great big body of the bride that them who lived back there was not perfect until this church be perfected this bride group in the last days to bring them in and all together be taken up he's back the holy ghost is back he's visited his church he's back and they cannot be perfect until this church be perfect this bride group in the last days to bring them in they're waiting on us what are they waiting on they're waiting on us to stand our test to take our test and to take our test and stand our test and not fail by the word there's been failure by the word and failure by the word and failure by the word but by the grace of god there's coming of bride that's not going to fail on the word but she's got to be tested by the word and all these testing times and all these trials amen don't lose heart don't lose heart amen don't look for don't look for anything else than what god's doing right now because god what god is doing right now in his bride is exactly what god wants to do everything is right on time nothing is wrong don't say it should be this way and it should be that way and it should be it should be exactly what god's doing don't get discouraged don't lose heart don't be dissatisfied with what god's doing but say god teach me teach me in every circumstance how to yield to you and submit and then you know we don't know what's going to happen in the world the world's falling apart there may be reprieve things may get better things may get worse it may cycle back and forth it may still oscillate up and down i don't want to make any prediction on on what will happen next but the world is literally falling apart systems of the world are unraveling things are changing at a fast pace and if you see things changing and things tightening up don't get mad friends get glad do you see things pressure coming to where we don't have all the freedoms we used to have and we don't have all the liberties and it's not as easy as it used to be there's more restriction and more difficulty oh don't get upset with that because there's a promise he's made a promise and that promise comes through a prophecy when he's just about to perform her cowardly deed all the squeeze the tightening up the person with just about to accomplish her cowardly deed he snatches her away oh praise god i believe we're going to see supernatural things friends we have seen we will see but regardless of what i see the only way that i'll know that i'm overcoming is by that word because the only way to overcome is to take the word because the word is the only thing that won't fail if i don't see anything it doesn't matter i still believe that word if i claim the promise and nothing moves brother graham say you speak to this mountain and the mountain will move if you if you don't doubt in your heart brother man said sometimes you speak and you don't see any move but you didn't realize on the back side a little grain of sand broke loose and began to roll down the backside don't let your eyes discourage you don't let circumstance discourage you don't let symptoms or trials or situations in the news don't be discouraged by any of that god's got a plan and when you take that word and speak that word there might be one grain of sand that just began to move off the backside of that and you may not see that come around for months or years but don't lose heart friends because the word won't fail if god takes us through dark places he's promised to be with us and guide us if persecutions come brother brahm said persecution was always good for the church tightening up come say perfect it's prophesied don't get discouraged and don't be heartbroken say god i'm yours we are counted as sheep all the day long counter for the slaughter lord whatever your purpose for this little sheep is i want to fulfill that purpose and i want to trust in you i want to stay with your word and i want to watch you do supernatural things with your word things that i never could imagine things that i never could fabricate things that i could never do but i'm going to let you do it and i'm going to trust you let's all stand musicians if you'll come i pray that god will bless you friends these things i like preaching fun stuff where we can dance and sing and get excited about the revelation but the revelation has to produce a life all the truths that we have all this word that's been given to us it's got to be more than an excitement and enthusiasm on a sunday morning it's got to be a life monday morning tuesday morning thursday friday amen when you get bad news and when things go wrong this word has to be the thing that lives in us we could try to preach excitement and enthusiasm but what's going to happen to your excitement enthusiasm when you take a hard blow and your family is rocked to the core by a trial that hits your difficulty that comes amen i want you to think back on this message and i want you to say but i'll still believe his word but i'll take him on his word and i'll watch him do the supernatural there's nothing i have to do there's not there's no hoops i have to jump through there's no work-up emotions i have to do all i've got to do is say i still believe that word and i'm standing on your word lord i believe your promise and i believe what you said and i'm standing right here and if you slay me you'll take me believing your word and when you deliver me you'll get credit amen we we live in an uncertain time full of uncertainty i think we can all agree on that i don't think any of us has a clue what's going to happen next it used to be there was a certain pattern to life and there was a few hiccups every once in a while something would happen that was odd and then we go back to the pattern of life but that pattern is severely disrupted and the the things that used to be stable are no longer stable but i want you to realize you're more stable than you've ever been you're more secure and more sure than you have ever been a day in your life is right now the most secure time for the bride don't be disheartened don't get discouraged don't get sad because the world is falling apart man let's look to this kingdom that is within us you think it's falling apart now wait till the bride leaves the earth and he will now let us we'll let till he be taken out of the way and wait till he's taken out of the way friends stay with the word and be joyful in the midst of it all that's a challenge for me not just a challenge for you a challenge for me a challenge for me to be happy when everything goes wrong a challenge for me to trust the lord amen when i don't understand what's happening next and i see problems and i see troubles but you know what i love him many ways and i believe that he loves me and i know that this kingdom is in me and i know nothing's out of kilter so this must be what he wants and i'm happy with it fight the devil i'll fight the devil every day of my life i won't give him an inch stand on the word i'll stand on the word 100 cast out devil cast out devil pray for the sick pray for myself see the hand of god and deliverance but when things don't go the way i expect them to do i'm not going to lose heart anymore but i'm going to say god you're testing me and when i'm tried i shall come forth as gold though i'm tried though i'm tested when i'm tried i shall come forth as gold what's god looking for in this earth today the gold the fiery trial just declares the gold and purifies the gold let's bow our heads friends dear heavenly father we thank you lord god we just want to be obedient to you preach what you'd have us to preach to say what you would have us to say to live the way you would have us to live god you've already ordered our steps we don't have to worry about it because you've already ordered our steps you've already determined lord things that must happen in our life for your glory to display your word to show forth your attributes your prophet told us the word is so clear [Music] god there's nothing out of kilter in our lives for the kingdom is on earth and the kingdom is in us but there's things that you must accomplish and the only way you'll accomplish it is through your body on the earth god i just want to be surrendered to your will help me not to resist or fight you help me just to fight the devil fight the unbelief fight the compromise on the word and the rejection of the word to fight that stay true to your word because that's the secret to overcoming not work up not pull down but of faith in the word help us to believe it lord in the face of all odds and all obstacles help us to believe your word and stand fast upon it encourage your bride lord help our lord to see that this plan is sure it's constant it's not changing it won't change and our deliverance is sure as well it's already done it's already finished our healing is done our deliverance is done it's all finished lord we're just here acting it out for a display of your attributes god keep each one those who are struggling and the devil's bringing torment to the mind i pray you'd free their mind right now in the name of jesus christ it calls them the doubt lord where they are with you whether they're not bride because of the happenings and the circumstances and the trials i cursed that devil in the name of jesus christ may lord you deliver your people now from wrong thinking may you deliver your people from the lies of the enemy may they recognize lord the pattern in the scripture and the promise and the message may we stay true to that lord we're trusting you for every manifestation that you've promised for every gift for every working of the gift for every manifestation we're trusting in you for it lord for your purpose according to your will may we stay humble lord may we stay as your sheep lord counted for the slaughter all the day long for your purpose may it be accomplished in us but may we be joyful lord saying when all of our work on earth is done we will receive our crown and our reward for god we're here for you now be glorified manifest yourself in us lord and let your word be made alive we ask it lord in jesus name bless us as we go from here to our fellowship to our homes may you encourage us by your word in jesus christ's name we pray [Music] [Music] amen how we've waited for moments like this have your way in this place holy spirit come to as you wish we are changed [Applause] like this as we win i'd also like to say if we know the pattern know the pattern of jesus ministry pattern of brother branham's ministry we see it you know the the bride has been blessed she's been given a voice around the world to spread the message to be on internet to travel freely to spread the message she's been persecuted of course rejected but it's been local rejection by churches and different individuals and family members and we've had quite a deal of freedom and quite a voice the internet and airwaves you know i just want to tell you no matter what you see next don't be discouraged if you see it looks like ministries diminishing don't lose heart if it looks like powerful voices are quieted it looks like powerful ones who had great displays and before go quiet and voices are shut down and maybe internet streaming except i don't know i'm not saying i know what will happen but if you see it diminishing don't lose heart friends it fits the pattern don't get scared don't say was she the one or do we look for another don't say was this really the bride that looks so weak and humble and unable with no power because that's the way god's always done it he took the weak things of this world the beggarly elements the nobodies the castaway the cast down the rejected and that's what he was working with so whatever you see next i don't know if we'll see anything it may get better than it's ever been it may get worse i don't know but don't let what you see discourage you let the revelation of your heart stand fast with the word if it looks like it's diminishing there's a scriptural pattern for that if it looks like it's weak and it's washed up there's a scriptural pattern for that don't lose heart friends don't get discouraged god's doing mighty things powerful things things that are changing this earth he'll display himself he'll show up right on time he'll do what he's promised to do don't lose heart no matter what we see in our own lives in the lives around us stand fast with the word because that's the only way to overcome he failed he failed because she left the word if we don't leave the word we'll not fail it's guaranteed god bless you gentle shepherd come and lead us [Music] foreign [Music] come and feed us for we need your strength from day to day there's no other [Music] who can help us face [Applause] come and leave us for we need to find our way [Music] come and lead us [Music] [Music] come and feed us for we need your [Music] strength [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] hey [Music] um
