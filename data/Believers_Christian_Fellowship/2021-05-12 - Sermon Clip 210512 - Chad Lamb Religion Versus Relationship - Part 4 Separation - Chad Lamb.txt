========================================

even lot and his carnality went down to the well-watered jordan because it was fertile it was fruitful he could be have progress and he could prosper there and even he moved down there which would force abraham to go the other way and where did god get abraham he got him smack dab in the middle of the promised land and he got him in the middle of the promised land which was not the better piece of land like the plains of jordan but it was the exact predestinated spot where he needed to be when he finally come into full separation he's standing in the middle of the land he said now lift up your eyes look northward look southward look to the east and look to the west why he's standing in the middle of the promised land because god is perfect and god is jealous and god always wanted to get abraham by himself to this place so that he could give him the promise and all the wonderings and movings and shiftings and right and wrong and in and out and all of it is because god has got to get abraham his elect predestinated seed in his program to his spot amen so that he can reveal to him all this word is yours from genesis to revelation in the old testament the new testament [Applause] it's all yours amen i've separated you from denominations you've had so much strife and trouble and so many things that have happened in your life but i'm trying to break the babylonian system i'm trying amen i'm trying to break it down where they don't understand your language anymore you don't understand your language anymore you're not even speaking the same thing anymore and even the ones that would come out with you originally god would allow them to fade off the scene or it would bring a contention where they would have to go one way and you would have to go the other way amen because god is bringing separation because separation is bringing relationship why the separation listen it's not separation because this one's bad and this one's good and blah blah it has nothing to do with it the separation is all about god being a jealous god and he wants a relationship with just you and he's so jealous he doesn't want you comforted by this one or that one or this church or that system or this if any of those comforts are coming between his jealous love for you and if it's dividing your focus if it's if it's causing you of affection somewhere else or comfort or our confidence and something else god will see to it that that thing gets broke somehow and separated off because he's a jealous god with a jealous love and he wants you and just you and somehow through it all he'll bring you right back to the middle of the promised land and when you get all by yourself and wondering how did i get to this place in my life you say now lift up thine eyes and look from genesis to revelation from before the foundation of the world to the new heavens and new earth it's all yours i've given it all to you
