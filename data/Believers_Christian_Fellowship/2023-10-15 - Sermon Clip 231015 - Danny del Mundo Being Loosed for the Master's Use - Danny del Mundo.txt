TRANSCRIPT
========================================
some might have been thinking it's too early to share that original Scene It Might stumble them so but I felt led to share it amen but the Father the father of uh uh of brother Chiba amen he was seriously hearing what every bit of detail I was sharing and uh through the scripture and immediately after that he said I have been I have been believing it was really not an apple amen amen but now it is scripturally clear amen and the whole family accepted the message amen the the father brother Chiba died his his mother remains faithful in the message and then brother Chiba married of my my my youngest uh sister-in-law and now we have another church brother Chiba is pastoring another church amen the the Church of my former uh uh uh uh Pastor uh uh it remains intact until now amen so why but people amen could think oh you're you're all Fanatics and everything amen but you come to think of that there are people who are really predestinated because they could they the seed in them could recognize the word amen hallelujah so that's why in Revelation 3:14 I believe he said uh WR this thing sayth the amen amen write this thing sayth the amen so our amen is not just our expression because we get excited or the the man the woman beside us say amen and we say Amen too amen but actually the amen is a person in Revelation 3:14 amen he said uh uh write this thing sayth the amen so the amen is a person amen that that that will recognize himself that will recognize the word amen so that amening in you is the part of him the part of the word recognizing the word amen write this things sayth the amen so your amen is the person of himself in you recognizing the word in your day Hallelujah write this thing sayth the amen who is the amen the beginning of the creation of God the faithful and true witness he was just he there he knew everything amen so he knows that that Amen in you amen is the same person the same God the same word that's why he recognized [Applause] himself so remember that when you say Amen it's not you when you're the one amening to the word it's you you're just excited but when he the person in you amen urge you say Amen
