just bow our heads together this morning Heavenly Father we're so grateful for another opportunity to gather and God as we take ourselves Lord out of the way now and just rest in your presence allowing you to minister the word to us Lord I pray that you would just speak to our hearts Lord that you would change Us by this word oh we love you we want to give you preeminence in first place we want to surrender ourselves Lord yield to your word pray to take this vessel into your controller and that you would speak the Eternal words of life through these lips of clay would you grant us all ears to hear and a heart to perceive all you have for us may you increase our faith lord well we love you we ask God that you would be the great one Among Us may we see you high and lifted up we love you father we ask your blessings are always say and do Jesus Christ name we pray amen God bless you while we're standing let's take our Bibles and turn to the Book of Proverbs man it's a good morning good to see you all here amen I know that this is vacation season so I've known of several families that are out on vacation and and everybody's going to be coming to or over the next couple months so we're always grateful to see the ones who are here amen God bless you all amen God is good we should just all go on vacation at the same time and I'll be here at the same time so we don't have to do all that I don't like the separation I want to remind you too that brother Noel Johnson will be preaching for us this Wednesday I mean he always comes up in the area around the time of the believer's shoes camp and so sometimes it works out that he can take a service for us so that's good we appreciate that also I heard from one of the brothers who headed over yesterday to Holmes County to help with the church building that they had a good day there's a lot of people who showed up we only had a few brothers from here because of the late notice but I believe brother Dominic was there brother Josiah priest and brother Riley Sanders so thank God they made it over but they had a good work crew and they got a lot done so that's wonderful if they do another work day I will do my very best to let you know ahead of time amen I will be more faithful and before we read the scriptures I just want to wish my wife a happy birthday and God bless you and man it's her birthday today and also it's Kylie white or Kelly Weichert so Cali's got a good birthday too amen amen let's read now Proverbs 28 and verse Proverbs 28 and verse 26. well we run verse and we'll let you have your seats Proverbs 28 and verse 26. he that trusteth in his own heart as a fool but whoso walketh wisely he shall be delivered amen you can have your seeds what an opening scripture but it's the truth he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool amen uh this is a subject that the Lord's been dealing with me on but for a title I'd like to take trusting not in ourselves trusting not in ourselves for the Proverbs is full of statements like this and we're going to pull a few out and read them but that there's a major theme in the Bible around this we won't get into all of it but he that trusteth in his own heart as a fool in this word heart is is interpreted mind will heart understanding our knowledge our thinking our reflecting our memory our inclination our resolution our determination and will our conscience amen so he that's trusting in our own understanding our own thinking our own conscience our own resolution our own inclinations he that's trusting in his own heart is a fool amen so we have to put our trust in something other than ourselves amen and I thank God that we live in a day that God has provided that something that we can put our trust in other than ourselves let's turn real quickly over to the Book of Jeremiah I want to read two more scriptures real quickly and then we'll go back to Proverbs let's go to Jeremiah 17 Jeremiah 17. Jeremiah 17. and nine says the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it and then then Jeremiah goes on to say or through Jeremiah the Lord says I the Lord search the heart I try the Reigns as reigns mean your inward part your belly I searched the heart I try the Reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings so the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it the Lord knows it and the Lord is the one who searched the heart and he tries the Reigns amen it's amazing that God goes uh goes deeper than what's on the outside but he goes down to what's on the inside he's the one who tries the the heart he searches the heart he's the one who tries to Reigns and your Reigns like I said is your belly or your inward part which is the the seed of emotions and the scripture and God is that's where he's getting down to test that and try that amen and brother brim told us it's it's our motive and objective is what counts and we'll get to that in a minute and God is the one who can Pierce through whatever we put on the outside God can Pierce through all of that and get to what's actually going on on the inside let's go to Hebrews chapter 4. Hebrews chapter 4. we'll begin at verse 12 Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12. for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of joints and Morrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart so the heart is desperately wicked who can know it the word is one that's Discerning the thoughts of the heart amen the discerner the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do amen it's amazing that that that the heart is deceptive the heart is desperately wicked he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool amen but God Amen by the word the word is sharper than a two-edged sword through the cutting asunder of the spirit and the soul and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and I thank God that God sent a perfect word in this day because we I mean we were stuck in a hybrid condition by no fault of our own but by what happened in the Garden of Eden and it's trapped us into this Amen to this hybrid flesh that still has a sticky culk of her nature but there's a word here that's going to cut that away amen and it's going to discern what's going on on the inside [Music] sometimes we have a hard time Discerning ourselves I said before self-deception is the greatest deception because self-deception is why Lucifer fell by amen because of his own brightness he was lifted up he was exalted by his own brightness by his own wisdom by his own Grandeur amen and he suffered through that self-deception amen and sometimes we have a hard time Discerning ourselves but God has sent a word in this day amen that can cut through everything and search the hearts and try the Reigns amen it's amazing how just when you think you're safe just when you think you've arrived I've served God I've given him my whole life I've turned it on just when you think you're safe amen the word comes and it slices another layer off and you find there's still something laying there that needs to be surrendered amen there's still selfishness there's still self there's still Pride there's still things there's still complexes there's still things that came down through the family tree there's still things laying there but by the grace of God he'll bring the word that'll cut down deep enough to open that up amen so we can see ourselves there's something there that needs to go and that's the mercy and grace of God amen it's it's amazing I was thinking I was meditating on this thought of why we come to church you know why do we continually come to church we come to church Sunday we come to church Wednesday and many things are happening each time and then we're always learning something more about God God is using the preaching of the word and the assembling together to bring the atmosphere to give us greater Revelation to open himself to us in a greater way amen there's people who are coming to the Lord there are people who are growing in their walk with the Lord there's so many things that are happening amen but we come and and some of you have been have been serving the lord and coming to church and worshiping Amen in the message longer than I've been alive 50 years or more you've been studying this word and hearing the preaching and hearing the message and and you know the message amen you know what the prophet taught you know the ministry and life of the Prophet amen and it's amazing how God still continually opening things but it's not like you we have no understanding amen of what God has done in our day and why do we keep coming back and reading over the same scriptures and reading and listening to the same messages and reading the same Bible amen it's because God Amen is bringing us to a higher plane all the time by his word because he doesn't want us to stay where we were 20 30 40 years ago but we're constantly growing in the Lord we're coming into the statue of a perfect man to be the very reflection of Jesus Christ on this Earth praise God that's a tall order but that's why we continually come if you'll turn with me to Second Timothy 3. I just thought of this scripture just a few moments ago and I'd like to read it second Timothy chapter 3 verse 16. second Timothy 3 16 all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works God wants us to be perfect and thoroughly furnished and what's it going to take it's going to take the word it's going to take the scripture the word of God which is profitable for Doctrine that's teaching for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that's why we keep coming back to church when we begin to get the attitude as I know the message I I've been this I've been I believe the message for 20 years I believe the message for 30 years and and sometimes I mean we we sit in our seats as almost the preacher can't say anything I don't know because there's some pride there that comes I've been serving the lord I've read the message I know I have a revelation and and yeah we'll see what this one has to say the question is why did you come to church if that's the attitude amen amen and and sometimes we can come and if we don't hear the subjects we want to hear we just tune out I always say oh the going this is a basic thing this is not the Rev no sometimes the basic thing is the one that's tripping us up sometimes knowing how to love our brothers the thing that we're having problems with and we're so revelated we can't get along with but if it's not a certain if it doesn't have that certain flavor if it's not coming this certain Revelation if it's not what I think up to the I'm gonna tune out and I'm gonna say that that's a certain level preacher in my book oh my goodness maybe what we need is not to keep climbing up but maybe we need to go down maybe we need to Humble ourselves and say God I need your help amen because I can't trust myself I can't trust my own thinking I can't trust my own heart this heart Amen to the carnal part of me is deceitfully wicked I need your spirit amen to come and bring the word to discern where I'm at amen when we come to the message perfect strength by Perfect weakness the prophet of God says then Paul said when I am weak then I am strong as he said then I will glory in my infirmities of my weakness and so forth I'm thanking God that I got all of it out of me and when I get everything out of me then God can come in but as long as I got some of myself there then God can't get in see that see we smother him out we drive him away from the poorest of us to The Riches of from the least to the greatest we keep God out of our Lives because of our own selves because I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William Branham he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture amen this is the prophet of God saying this after all of his experience with the Lord and God using him for so many things he's still recognizing that the problem he's having is him and any problem he has is him and if he has too much of himself he's pushing God right out of the picture and when he gets to a place where he thinks he can do something amen if there's anybody that I think would have got to a place where they think they can do something about it to me it would be the prophet of God but even him that's when he's hindering God he realizes that but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that he's out of the way then God can come over and do things that William Branham knows nothing about that's when God can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we've got ourselves in the way then we cannot amen let's go to back to Proverbs to proverbs 26. we're going to stay in Proverbs I believe for a little while Proverbs 26 and 12. he says see us thou a man wise in his own conceit there is more hope of a fool than of him this word conceit is I it can mean your physical eye are also your mental qualities your understanding what you see what you understand so you see a man wise in his own understanding in his own eye there's more hope of a fool than of him I said God help us as we grow in this revelation we never get to the place where we feel like we've got something under control we know something and now I know oh my goodness the Bible says amen if anybody thinks he knows something he knows nothing as he ought to that's the reality whatever it is we know by the grace of God he's allowed us to understand by revelation we still don't know any of those subjects like we ought to because there's so much more depth amen there's so much more how do we find the bottom of God how do you get to the end of God Amen this word is God Amen how do you you say I've got that Doctrine pinned down my goodness how are you ever going to have a Doctrine pin down if it's a teaching about God it goes on and on and on and it gets deeper and deeper and deeper amen and sometimes when we feel like we've got it and we've nailed it and I've got that one let's move to the next one amen we're going to miss opportunities to go deeper [Music] amen so we're not that's that's a danger in human beings and I say we all suffer from that some of us more than others because that Pride was injected into the human race at the fall amen the very pride of Satan came through and we find it in Cain amen and brother bear said where did Cain get that he didn't get it from Adam he didn't get amen every seed brings forth after its kind that was an Adam that came from somewhere else from another source and Satan found a way to inject himself into the human race through the serpent and that Pride got injected in and now all of us are struggling with this pride and in better it's better off just to recognize it and say you know what I'm a failure to begin with I mean this old sticky conquer where nature is going to lead me awry I need God to lead me or else I'm going to go astray my own understanding my own thinking my own feeling my own emotions will my own emotions will deceive me my own thoughts my own inclinations my own inspirations will deceive me amen you know that still as we walk in this Earth today being born again and full of the Holy Ghost you haven't been able to completely shed that old sticky over nature and you catch Inspirations from God and you catch Inspirations that are your own and if you make every inspiration you catch from God you're going to wind up bankrupt and down a dead end Road someday it's better for us just not to trust ourselves and say God I need you to really show me I don't even trust my own inclinations I don't even trust my own feelings my own emotions sometimes have led me the wrong way God I if this is you I need you to confirm it by something other than just me amen because I don't trust me is maybe you leading me and I trust that you've led me this way before but oh God would you confirm amen show me because I don't trust my own thinking my own emotions my own Revelations my own inclinations man it makes me nervous when I see somebody so confident so spiritually self-confident and so bold and all their intuitions and all their feelings it scares me to death and maybe that's more spiritual than me but I've never been able to come to the place where I can say that I always know what to do most of the time I have no clue and God Rescues Me that's generally what happens to me I have no clue what's going on I have no clue the right decision I have no clue how to solve this problem and somehow God works it all out and Rescues Me that's generally what happens for me and the message proving its word he says now to heal I cannot you know that what is a gift brother Branham something that you take no it's something you know how to get yourself out of the way as long as you're there it'll never work William Branham is the greatest enemy I got but when I get him out of the way see then Jesus Christ can use the body brother Branham had enough confidence in the gift that God gave him and the commission that God gave him an angel that he would stand before thousands amen and he would call meetings and he would plan meetings and he would rent tents and he had enough confidence in what God told him Amen to do that he would stand there amen but once he got there he had no confidence in himself he was waiting for the angel of the Lord to show up because he said you know I can't do anything until he comes so it wasn't self-confidence it was confidence in God's commission but he still was helpless without God his gift wasn't something he could just take and operate his gift he said the gift I got is to get myself out of the way that's the gift I have to pull myself into another gear where I relax myself then he comes on the scene and he begins to operate praise God so when he learned if he can get himself out of the way he's the greatest enemy he's the hindrance let's look at Proverbs chapter 3. Proverbs chapter 3 verse 5. trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path amen the Bible's so clear on this we have so much instruction that we're not to trust our own understanding our own thinking our own feeling but oh I thank God that that we've received a word in this day and that word is continually going forth amen and as we go back and read the same scriptures we read before amen and we listen to the same tapes we LED before and we come to the service after service just like we did before that God is constantly peeling away a layer of my heart and showing me you've got to get rid of this you've got to surrender that amen this isn't right I'm glad he didn't leave me alone a few years ago when I thought I had arrived I got the Revelation I'm glad he didn't stop working on me then but I'm glad I kept coming into his presence and coming back to the word so he can keep cutting more away amen I'm saying God hiding himself in Simplicity says so it's pleases God to reveal himself and then hide himself then hide himself and reveal himself in simple little things it's put over the top of the head of man because if you say why would I adjust God do that is because that man was made up in the beginning not to try to shift for himself a man was made to rely completely upon God that's the reason we're liking to the Lambs or sheep a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the holy spirit's supposed to lead us amen we're not supposed listen I'll just say it this way we're not supposed to have it figured out sometimes we feel like we've come to a position in the revelation of the word we have the message and we're the bride of Christ as if we're supposed to now be all-knowing and all understanding and have everything figured out to be the bride known to be the bride of Christ means that I am surrendered to the headship of my husband I'm his wife I'm his bride and I'm a submissive wife surrendered to him he's the lead he's the one that knows I don't know he's leading he knows what comes next I have no idea amen so to be a bride to be a good bride is not to know everything to be a good bride is to be fully surrendered to the headship of Christ the word I felt the pressure so many times in my own life to have all the answers and to know everything and to be able to so funny I would feel so much pressure and even as a pastor in the past I and a minister I felt pressured to have all the answers like I have to have all the answers and and so I have to come and massage some spiritual type and I have to make it fit and I have to have an answer and I've got to say something sometimes the very best thing we can say is I have no idea brother I'm as clueless as you are if God doesn't come and show us we'll never know to have to have all the answers and to be a know-it-all and always know what's best and what somebody should have done and the church should have done that he should have made this decision and I don't agree with that and we ought to do this and they ought to do that and I that's a trap friends that's a pride trap amen and that Pride trap has caused so much destruction all around us in our own lives and the lives of others when we get caught in that Pride trap it's so much better to say I don't know all I know to do is put my hand in his and say God you've got to lead me on the way because there's things coming I don't have the answers to I know the answers in the Bible I know it's in the message but I don't have it in my own thinking I don't know how to put the pieces together I need you to do it Lord so man was made to rely completely upon God if man was made to rely completely on God then maybe God will allow us to get into situations where we don't know the answer so that we can rely completely on him [Music] maybe that's what God intended that we're not supposed to shift for ourselves so that that God Amen and God has not uh given us okay I'll give you all the word now you figure it out from here that's not the plan man was never intended to shift for himself amen he was supposed to rely completely on God amen and so if that's the case then we ought not to get surprised when we run into obstacles we don't have the answers for when we Face things we haven't faced before when when it's not obvious what the solution should be amen I always think it's funny when people know what everybody else around them should be doing well they shouldn't do that and they should do this and that's wrong and the brother Bram says and listen I ain't got a clue what I'm doing I'm just walking with God day by day and asking him to show me I ain't got a clue I've come to the place where everything I thought would happen didn't happen the things I thought would never happen or the things that happened the way this situation I thought was going to resolve it resolve something completely I've come to the place where I just throw my hands in the air and say God you're in charge I don't know but I know this word is true and holds the answer and you will always give us an answer by Your Word you will always lead by your spirit your spirit will always lead by the word and I can't think of it now but there's a solution here somewhere amen brother random there's a an interesting thing that I found as I was reading through the message humbled myself and and I was studying in this message it's just a little short message brother bam just gets up and he's making some opening comments and he's making comments before brother Lee Vale preaches then brother levale preaches and then it's got Brothers comes up at the end and he makes a few more comments and it's only I don't remember how long it is it's not very long and I just went to that there's a quote that I remembered in the message humble myself so I went to that quote and I just decided to read the whole message and all of a sudden it really began to touch me and and move me and I found this in here that I thought was very interesting brother Ben says because since I've been home I've told you about the visions and what's happened and everything and I brought it right up why I've done all these things and then this morning bringing it right up now to that last pool coming to the third pool so now it's my time for consecration to God 's time to speak to me I'm I must just have a little change in my own life not as that that I think I'm wicked I want to feel a little more closer to the people brother remember comes and this is after he preached standing in the Gap this is about three weeks after he preaches standing in the Gap and we'll read a quote out of that but brother branham's coming to the third pool and here he is after the opening of the seals he's here and this is the end of June June 23rd that he's preaching humble thyself and and a couple weeks later he's going to preach standing in the gap and and he's he's at this place coming to the third pool Ministry the ministry of the third pool and brother Branham doesn't feel like he's arrived because he's come to the third pool he feels like he needs another change in his life I I must just have a little change in my life not as that I think I'm wicked I want to feel a little more closer to the people my brother REM comes to this after the preaching of the seals after all of that he knows that something in him has to change he's got to have a feeling for the people there's got to be some there's got to be a victory in Divine love I think that's amazing that touched me in a way because when have we arrived I still need something to change in me yes I need a little change not that I think I'm wicked but I need more and I don't ever want to strive for more of him I don't want to stop striving for more of him I don't ever want to get in that relaxed State the minute you start to relax you start the backslide that's what happened to Ephesus they aimed at and relaxed I don't ever want to get into that relaxing where I stop striving to to be to emulate Christ in every way Amen to be a reflection of him in every way and to constantly go to him and open my heart and say God would you take the sword of your word and would you divide asunder soul in spirit and be a discerner the thoughts and intents of my heart amen because I don't even sometimes know what's wrong with me I don't even know sometimes what I'm struggling with but I need you to come and open it up amen and discern my own heart amen so that I could surrender to you in a greater way and somebody say to me one time amen we're always taught to die and to surrender and die and surrenders and sometimes you don't know what to die out too sometimes you don't know what to surrender because you don't know what the problem is amen how many believe we all have some sort of complexes or family heritage or and sometimes we have no clue what they are I'll raise my hand and say I've got complexes but ask me what they are I don't know my wife could probably tell you that my friends could probably tell you better than I could tell me is that right we could look around and we can all begin to if we all had a conversation we could all begin to diagnose each other's complexes or family traits or but when it comes to our own that's when we begin to stumble and say I know I'm struggling I know I don't see everything right but I don't know how to make myself see right I know that sometimes my perspective is wrong and sometimes I jump to conclusions and I know but but I don't know my way around it I need God to come and buy the word open me up and expose me brother bear said we don't come to church to see our good parts we come to see our bad parts because that's what we're blind to we need somebody in the Pulpit with a gift that God can pick up and use and wield that sword and begin to do a heart surgery and say listen look here there's something laying there and it laid there from Grandma and Grandpa and God can deliver it but but we need to ask for deliverance we need to understand we need to cry out and say God I need this Pride gone I need this gone I need this going on in my life amen and brother man I'm coming through the third pool after the opening of the seals the final stage of his ministry he needs a change a change in him to go into the final stage of the ministry and if the bride is the final stage of Christ's Ministry on Earth and we're coming to the final days of the final Ministry I think we need a change in US I think we continually need a change in us to come to Perfection amen and I want to be open to that always how am I going to be open to that by first recognizing that if I trust in my own heart I'm a fool and if I lean on my own understanding I'm going to fall in air and if I think I know something I better take heed when I think I stand lest I fall now the the best thing for me to do amen as a child of God is learn not to trust myself and then we'll be okay and the message standing in the Gap this is the one that brother brother Branham comes and preaches a couple weeks oh I'm sorry I had that backwards humble thyself is July 14th standing in the Gap came first June 23rd and he says and the message standing in the Gap Moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen to him and brother Rory you see your dream and now I cannot go with a Ministry like that until I feel different in my heart about it no matter what if God did tell me even if God told me to go God told him you go back to the people you've you've left the sick people lay he told him to go back you've got more gifts than that you go to the people he said I can't go even if God did tell me until something in me changes until I feel different in my heart about it no matter if God did tell me but that is that change that brother Roy that scene coming what did Brother Royce he's seen a dream and at the dream brother Brennan was at the end of the table and they were all sitting there and brother Brandon was picked up and he whisked away amen and brother Roy was crying brother Brown come back come back and a little bit later he comes back when he but when he comes back he looks like Moses he's got a white beard he's got a white white hair or however it is he's glowing and he looks like Moses and brother branham's saying this is that change Moses had lost a feeling for his people he had run away from his commission amen because he was rejected and he had run Amen to the Wilderness and hung out there but he came back amen God in a meeting of a pillar of fire and brought him back brother Branham went out west and he come back and now he's saying I need a change in me that's the change that you're seeing brother Roy it wasn't to change listen it wasn't that change to some super powerful now I'm going to start this and that and that not a big platform show not a big something that would Elevate man what the change he needed was something in his heart had to change and I ask you why did Brother Branham take rejection so hard because of his childhood because of the things that he suffered all through life he had a complex he had he had things and he tells us in standing in the Gap I built myself a complex because the people wouldn't hear me I love that term built myself a complex because you can't blame anybody else for it it's like Devil the devil hands you the bricks and you're the one stacking them and he brings this negative thought and you stack it in this negative thought and you stack it and the devil's handing you all these negative thoughts and you're building yourself a complex which is a wall that separates you from brethren but remember I said I built myself a complex because the devil sold a negative thought brother Branham had these negative thoughts about they didn't hear me I thought they ought to have heard me and they rejected the message and didn't hear the message and now he says I built myself a complex and we do the same thing friends the devil hands us negative thoughts about the way somebody treated us or away a situation unfolded or away somebody handled something amen we begin to stick these things here and accomplish the next thing though we're walled off and we think the problems with everybody else that church that Ministry that family that family member that but they're not the ones who built the wall we are we sit inside our wall all bricked in and separated from fellowship and and licking our wounds and sucking our sores and blaming everybody else for this wall That's separating us and we think we're right say God forgive me knock down this wall that I built this thing that's separating me from fellowship this thing that's hurting me and we're the ones who hurt the most we suffer by our own efforts to save ourselves we destroy ourselves our own efforts to protect our heart from any more damage is the very thing that destroys our heart because we pull away from the fellowship that God wants to use to heal us I say God help me forgive me amen knocked These Bricks out of the way all these negative lies of the devil all the wrong seed that was sown in my mind and I allowed it to stay God forgive me of that and knock it all away and help me to have a softer feeling in my heart towards others this is what he says I will repeat that last phrase until I feel different in my heart about it no matter if God did tell me but that is the change brother Roy that scene coming something's got to change me because I in my heart if I go out there feeling the way I do now I still feel that they ought to have heard the message they ought to have done it and I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have until I get that feeling there is no need in me going because I'd be a hypocrite my goodness brother Branham when he's coming with a perfect interpretation of the word a perfect Revelation and brother Branham at this point had Revelation he hadn't even shared yet he had things God told him he felt to stop not saying anymore he understood what the third pull was he knew what the seventh seal was he knew what all the seals were he knew the day and hour he knew all of this he had this great Revelation and what he needed was not was not more Revelation what he needed was for him to change so that he can Manifest this revelation so they can move into this final stage of the ministry he was going to take a change in him and the change in him was not going to be Pride it wasn't going to be arrogancy it was going to be a haughty Spirit it wasn't going to be a know-it-all the change in him was going to be a greater feeling for the people he was moving into the Capstone of perfect love that's the change that he needed and what change do we need we don't need to have the answers for everything we don't need to cut everybody's legs out from under them when they don't understand the message or they disagree we don't need debate we don't need all of this nonsense what we need is a more Divine love perfect love working in us we need something to change us so that we can move into this final stage of the ministry it's not going to be had knowledge that does it is not going to be we understand it all and nobody can stand against the Bible Understanding that we have my goodness what we need is to project love because when love projects Sovereign Grace takes its place we need some things got to change me God changed me I thought that was so amazing when he recognizes coming to the third pool he's got to have the change now when we moved further down and to Humble thyself it's amazing the things that he says and I'm going to pull several excerpts from there quite a few he says don't forgive this Tabernacle will lose its strength remember that this is the target where Satan has got every gun and Hell trained on it he'll cause one person to do something that's contrary to what the other one thinks he didn't say they did something wrong he said they did something contrary to what the other one thinks I'm surprised at how many times this is the problem not sin just somebody did something contrary to what another person thinks and it creates a great disruption because we all think we're right uh I'm sorry to burst your bubble but we all think we're right we all think we have good perspective we all think we have good discernment we all think we're a good judge of what we see all of us and we all think that we understand what's going on by the Limited information we have many times we're looking at a situation through a people and say yep that's it I got it that's what the word says if they would just listen to the prophet and we really think we know the answer the Bible says he that judges the matter before he heareth it is foolishness I think what we need to do is just stop being know-it-alls just stop trusting in our own understanding and stop being super spiritual stop having everything figured out and leave everybody alone and let God lead and if something's wrong go to that person and find out because many times you'll find you didn't have all the information you misunderstood instead of just lobbing arrows why don't we just stop that and say you know what it doesn't look good to me but I don't understand there must be more to it because that's a good brother that's a good sister that's a good family that's a good Minister that's a good church that's my brother I don't understand why they're doing what they're doing but there must be an explanation and what I see I don't agree with but there must be more to it why don't we give each other the benefit of the doubt why do we always jump to the negative conclusion why can't we start defending one another and say hey there's probably more to the story than we understand those are good people those are my brothers and sisters I'm sure there's a reason let's not constantly constantly reinforce the negative let's take it the other way he says he'll cause one person to do something that's contrary to what the other one thinks he is doing that he is up to it that's his business if he can get somebody to say something somebody to talk about another say well listen did you know so and so did don't you listen to it don't you listen to it at all that's the devil see it Satan don't you believe it if there is anything that somebody has done wrong pray for them and don't pray in a selfish way and say I know it's my duty I've got to pray for that brother you know you can pray for a brother with a haughty spirit God that poor brother he don't know what he's doing and I can see it and I mean we don't say it exactly like that but that's the very attitude we go to prayer with we go to the attitude we're here and our brothers down here and we're praying down for him to God help this poor ignorant brother who doesn't know anything you know God hates a proud heart it's an Abomination to God a proud amen how do we pray we get down underneath and begin to lift a brother or sister this is what he says he says don't pray in a selfish way say I know it's my duty I've got to pray for that brother like you're God's gift to that brother and somehow your prayers are rocking heaven for the brother because he can't pray for himself that's the attitude we go to prayer with sometimes once I prayed for him everything changed but that's exactly what we do it's exactly what we do I mean when we're when we're praying for somebody to get healed and they died we don't say anything but we're praying for somebody to get healed and they they're they're miraculously saved and delivered you say I was praying for them I want my name attached to the success of my but when the situation turned they died you don't say nothing about I spent hours praying for them and Hey listen we're all plagued with this thing we all need to be free from this amen Paul was able to say I have watered Apollos I planted Apollos water but God gets the increase amen so he goes on to say he Sid you take it in your heart when you go to pray take it in your heart really down for that sister and just talk and be real sweet and the first thing you know you find them right back in the service again because after all we're headed toward the setting of the Sun where are we going we're going to the finish line but we're going to go together friends we're going to go loving each other supporting each other having a feeling for one another amen really laboring for one another defending one another standing up for one another not cutting one another and misjudging one another and being suspicious of one another amen so this is the instruction that he's given to church he goes on down further and humble thyself he says now we look at this watch to find out what time it is unless that every instrument in that watch is coordinated one with the other will never know the correct time is that right and that takes all of us all together if we want to see their third pool really do something for God now brother Branham takes this and humbled himself he's talking about praying for a brother and sister and not having a haughty spirit and all these things and he's taking it he's tying it to the manifestation of the third pool that we're not going to have this manifestation until we get to this place till we all are coordinated and all of us are doing our part and every part is in its place and there's Harmony in unity he says it's going to take that for the third pool really to do something for God amen so listen we're not going to do it by ourselves no matter how much we think we're the greatest thing that that ever happened to the Earth and we're the greatest believer in the church amen nothing's going to happen without all of us amen it's going to take all of us all together we want to see the third pool really do something for God it's coordination with every one of us together to Humble ourselves before God and confess our wrong and pray and believe God for these things praise God further down he says you know people want Power and really they don't know what power is they don't really know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ you see the humble yourself before him that's real power amen real power is not noise real power is not demonstration real power is not a show but real power is being able to conquer yourself because brother man said the greatest enemy I got it's William Branham well the greatest enemy I God's Chad Lamb amen and what what happens if I conquer everything else around me but this guy's the one deceiving me and tripping me up and building complexes and causing me to make wrong decisions and misjudge circumstances and oh we prayed for this one and they were healed well that's wonderful we love that amen but who's going to save me from myself I need God for me I need to humble myself and I need God Amen to take his word and slice and open and and reveal and and Purge and do all the things that I need him to do for me we could walk in Pride and see God use gifts and see God use us and and all the things that he's used us for and walk in Pride and not realize we're corrupting ourselves but so proud about being a good Christian and we're corrupting ourselves and sowing negative seed all around us I say God help us help us to stay humble Lord like your Prophet told us to stay humble like your word tells us to stay humble let's humble ourselves he goes on to say you show me a church that's humble real humble not an arrogancy a church just sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise amen when I read this this is what I want with all my heart this is what I want I need God's help I need the spirit of God to lead me into this but this is what I want with all of my heart because with this with the right humble attitude and the right humble Spirit anything is possible God can do absolutely anything when he has full control and we're not we're not handicapping his efforts by our own Pride our own arrogancy but when we come into subjection and real humility and surrender to him then he's the great one he's the preeminent one he's everything and we realize we're nothing when we come to that place then absolutely anything is possible and anything he does Amen will be him getting all the credit because we know that we can't do it so when the prophet of God could come in the end of his ministry say I'm not the one that was there that day I was just standing near him I wasn't the one who came down on the river I wasn't the one who said those things I wasn't the one who did those things I was just standing near when he did that oh God I want to be standing near when you do those things too help me God and the message the influence of another he says put God before you and you'll have reverence for God and respect for him that's right now he goes and he starts speaking of the cherubims that we're worshiping when Isaiah saw him high and lifted up he said two Wings he covered his face two wings that means reverence reverence before God bowing covering his face now we don't have any Wings to cover our face we bow our head at his feet bow our heads and pray in reverence respects yes sir recognize it the two Wings he covered his feet his feet covered his feet represents humility and respect hear the very angels in heaven brother member said that we're pure and never sinned the day in their life amen but they would cover their face in reverence and respect to God and they recover their feet in humility in the presence of God listen he says Moses and the respects of God telling him he was on Holy Ground he took his shoes took off his shoes he done something to his feet Paul and respect the god reverence when the angel of the Lord came before him the pillar of fire he fell on the ground on his face respects John the Baptist he had such respects when he saw Jesus coming he said I'm not even worthy to touch his feet see the feet showing respects oh be conscious here is only one thing to be conscious of your littleness if you want to get somewhere with God make yourself real little I started thinking about all the men who come into the presence of God Moses amen humbled him Isaiah was undone Paul was flattened to the ground we think all these Bible figures brother Benham said when the angel comes I nearly die all of these figures what did it do it brought humility and then when I when I see sometimes that arrogant spirit I wonder if we've ever been in the presence of God because how could we have an an arrogant hottie know-it-all Spirit if we've been in the presence of God amen it must bring humility to actually see God recognize God in this hour to come in contact with the Living God it must bring reverence respect and humility when we see the lack of that I wonder if we've just introduced people to a church to a building to a local Gathering but if we've really brought people into the presence of God Amen should bring a reverence a respect and humility help us this is the struggle of Our Lives back and humble thyself he says above all things is our individual Souls that were responsible before God it's you going to heaven it isn't whether I go or he goes It's You Going see and you first and you've got to look this out and come sweet before the Lord and I've always found out that the man that humbles himself is the man that God exalts when you take a person with his chest out and knows everything and you can't tell him nothing and he's arrogant and well that's the person that never gets anywhere but you take the person that humbles themselves and walks sweetly I love how brother Branham over and over says humbly and sweetly and humbly and sweetly and all through this message humble thyself he keeps referring to sweetly and humbly and then I started thinking of those terms and I went and I did a search and brother Branham over and over and over when the angels of the Lord comes on the platform amen he'll tell the people you feel that real humble sweet feeling he said that's him he said that's him he said that's our Lord he said that's Jesus Christ he said that's the angel of the Lord he called it all those things that's the presence of God all of that amen and and over and over and over he says you feel that humble sweet presence you feel that and then in one place he said you feel that sweet Meek presence that's the presence of the Lord and dozens maybe hundreds of times he says this on tape how can we walk away from the presence of the Lord and take a hotty arrogant spirit when every time it came it was humble sweet meek brother bam says when the bride when she comes to the image of Christ said the devil the Thunder that shakes the devil is that sweet humble spirit that's the Thunder that shakes the devil that's what it means to act like Christ not stand up and [Music] sometimes we want demonstrations because demonstrations help us with our pride but I want demonstrations I want all the gifts of the Spirit operating and I want God to demonstrate and vindicate his word over and over but I want him to do it I want him to get the credits because if we do it wrong it'll lay a trap at people's feet but I want God to show himself mighty I want God to come on the scene I want him Amen to keep his word I want him to perform it I want him to be preeminent I want him to be king and Lord of lords and I want him to be the great Shepherd and I want him to get all the credit amen let's look at Proverbs 18 together I hope we're still in our Bibles in Proverbs let's go to proverbs 18. Proverbs 18 verse 12. Proverbs 18 and 12 says Before Destruction the heart of man is haughty and before honor is humility so the question is do we want destruction or do we want honor then the Way Up Is Down back and humble thyself he says we want to keep it running smoothly sweetly in an order of the Lord so just remember that your part may be the mainspring or it may be the little some little hand or some little part or the whining stem or whatever it may be or it may be the hands on the face of the clock that tells the time but whatever it is it takes all it takes us all working together in harmony with the Gospel of Jesus Christ to bring this to pass and he's talking about the third pool it's going to take all of us working in harmony to bring this to pass just think if gifts is so great what we call power and Paul said though I have faith that would move a mountain and have not charity I am nothing think of that and though well we understand I wish I know the Bible though I understand all the mysteries of God see and still though I could do it and have not charity I am nothing see I ain't got nowhere yet see the main thing is love God and humble yourself with it is talking about every little piece has to play their part amen and it's amazing how whenever you get a group of people all personalities begin to pop up and all these old complexes and uh and pride and all of that and you find it's so hard sometimes for somebody just to stay in their Lane just to stay with what God given because somebody else gets more notoriety somebody else's position is more seen and they're always trying amen there's a Temptation either to try to get into that position or to tear down the one who's in that position find criticism amen for the officers of the church find criticism for the heads of a family find criticism for the one singing find criticism because why the reality is there's a pride in you somewhere and you feel sorry for yourself that you're not in that position and that critical spirit's coming up and we can I mean sometimes we're so good at finding fault with everything how about praising how about saying I appreciate somebody that'll stick with their office I appreciate somebody that will give themselves for that give themselves for this I appreciate it until God moves me from here I want to do this part the best I can that's Pride that Pride brings criticism that Pride amen brings a tearing down but all humility can come in and value everybody I appreciate everyone I appreciate the place that they play the role that they play I appreciate what they do and then we all every little mainspring every Cog every gear wheel everything works together and in harmony brings us into the manifestation of the third pool it takes us all working together doesn't matter what position we hold what God's called us to what gift he's given us where we fit in the body we all have to play our part and we all have to stay in our Lane I mean we can't take the ball out of somebody else's hand we got a block for them we all have to work together and love one another amen brother member says now surely after all these years we're still in Humble thyself I'm telling you I go home and read it or listen to it if you can because it meant so much to me now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in at and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around you don't let No Malice come in no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person see you be sweet and kind remember God loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he's wrong and just pray for them and love one another why is that so hard because of the old sticky Caulker burnt nature amen above everything love God and love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless us and it's hard telling what he will do it we'll just be humble with God and humble with one another and love God and be humble with one another and love one another there's no telling what God will do Proverbs 16 verse 5. let's turn there read the scripture this is the one I referred to a moment ago Proverbs 16 5 everyone that is proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord an Abomination is bad we just say it that way I don't want to be proud and hearth I want to have a humble let's go to First Peter chapter 5. look at another scripture together First Peter chapter 5. first Peter 5 chapter 5 verse 5. likewise you younger submit yourselves into the Elder and yet all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisted the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore unto the mighty hand of God that may he may exalt you in due time praise God this is what God wants for us and humble thyself he says let not that Spirit ever depart from this place if it ever does then I don't care how eloquent your pastor might be how well he might bring the word of God the spirit of God is grieved away when we can have all things in Fellowship in common and love one another then God will work with us amen you know what it means it means we can't just sit back and have an arrogant spirit and have contention and have criticism one towards another we can't sit back and expect the gift to work I can have contention I can have a complex this is when I can have a feeling and I can have this and that and I can be proud and and I'll go to church and we'll still hear a good message no the spirit of God will be grieved away from that in order for us to hear from God Amen we've got to keep the spirit right we've got to keep the atmosphere right we've got to keep ourselves humble before God loving before God and humble with one another and loving amen and the Way Up Is Down in the message blind Bartimaeus he says redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die that's right get love in your heart and be true and honor and have the right kind of motive and the right kind of objective and God will take care of the rest if your motive is right and your objective is right if your objective is right and your mode is wrong it won't work I love this I looked I looked here that motive and objective just to have a definition so we're all on the same page the definition of motive is a reason for doing something so we have to judge our motive what's the reason we're doing it and I think that's a good question to ask whenever we get into anything it's great sometimes you know life is fast we move at a fast pace we go go but every once in a while stop it's good to stop just stop for a minute and just meditate and say why am I doing what I'm doing why am I doing this what's my motive behind it I mean we can get caught up in false motives so easy amen and and sometimes we can mask a false motive with religious rhetoric we're so good at that you see somebody has a problem with gossip they just need to tell you about somebody in the other church so that you can pray for them the motive was they just want to tell you what they heard there's no need for you to be involved there's nothing that you need to hear it doesn't have anything to do with you you're not intimately involved in the situation there's already people praying but somebody has a problem with gossip they'll come and start to be a tail Bearer and tell things and they'll cover it with religious rhetoric if I'm telling you this so you can pray when the reality is you're telling me this because you want to tell me this there's already people praying there's already a pastor involved there's already a church handling the situation there's no reason for you to tell me this and so we have to stop and say why do I want to tell this why do I want to share this why what is my real motive behind my actions I tell you when we get down to this it's a little bit tough to judge ourselves but I think we need to take time to judge ourselves and quit moving at such a fast pace amen and stop and say why am I doing this why am I doing that why did I make this decision why why did I say it I I've walked away sometimes from conversations and absolutely embarrassed at myself ashamed of myself because I said things in a certain way I phrase things a certain way because I was trying for people to have a good opinion of me and I and I wanted some way to tell them that I had accomplished something but they weren't asking yet so I found a way to work it into the car and I walk away and I hang my head so ashamed of myself that was nothing more than Pride you say why did I tell them that why would I didn't need to tell them that they weren't asking me the conversation wasn't on that it I hope I'm not the only one [Music] we we need to stop and say why why am I doing that who benefits from that who looks good if I tell that who does it make look good if it just makes me look good then there's no reason to tell it because the scripture says we're not to praise ourselves let another praise you don't praise yourself why because that just generates more Pride so sometimes we've got to stop and look at the motive behind why we do things I mean sometimes you can see it so often in the way people post things on social media you see pride coming through and people will have all kinds of reasons I posted this for this reason I post and the real reason you post it is because you wanted to be accepted or look accepted or and we have to stop and say why am I doing what I'm doing am I following following in to the devil's trap or if this real humility is this real christ-like character or is this just my own Pride deceiving me what's our motive what's our motive for talking about a situation is it to help or is it just to talk about the situation so it's times that we need to talk about situations there's times we need to correct things there's times that we need to go to people there's times we need to go to a Brother's sister and we need to straighten something up there's times but what's my motive for doing it am I doing it so that they'll know I'm right and they're wrong you better not have that conversation yet am I doing it so that I can say well I tried it's their fault now I did my part wrong motive but if I'm concerned for their soul and there's something wrong and I don't want any hindrance and I don't want this odd feeling and I want love and I want Harmony and I want Unity then you better go to them because your motive is right there's times we have conversations there's times we talk about things there's times for everything but what's our motive if our motive is right and our objective is right then God will make sure it comes out but if our motive is wrong then God's not obligated to make it work out because there's something else going on then I looked at the word objective objective means something toward which effort is directed an aim a goal or the end of an action so the motive is the reason we're doing it the objective is what we're trying to achieve what is the goal what is the aim what are we trying to do amen and if what we're trying to do amen is not for the kingdom of God if what we're trying to do is not for somebody else's benefit if what we're trying to do if it somehow is for our benefit for personal gain for selfish reasons then we better leave it alone [Music] brother Benham taught us not to even pray selfishly he says you want to be healed what do you want to be healed for what do you want to do when you're healed what are you going to do with your health are you going to serve God what do you want to be what do you want to be healed for so you can testify what do you want to be healed for he told us not to even pray even for our healing just for selfish reasons just so we can feel better and not have pain he told us what what's the motive behind what you're asking because when you get the motive right God will make it come out right you say my motive is God I want to see your word work I believe your promise and I know it's true and I want to testify that this word is true I want to have health so that I can serve you better so I can serve my family so that I can serve in my position what's our motive what's our objective he said when our motive and objective is right God will take care of the rest sometimes we just need to stop for a minute and just reflect and ask God to open up our understanding so God show me where I'm at right now and why I'm doing what I'm doing and if her motive is right and our objective is right we're humble move forward with faith that God will take care of the rest God will come on the scene and God will work it out when you look at the Pharisees the Pharisees motives and their objectives were wrong but their actions were right you look at the Pharisee who kept the Sabbath you look at the Pharisee who paid tithes you look at the Pharisee amen who went to the temple to pray you look at the Pharisee his actions were right his motives and objectives were wrong amen you remember the one who goes to the temple to pray and he says I thank you God that I'm not like this Publican and I'm not a sinner and I fast so many times a day and I pay tithes of all and Jesus said there was another poor man he went in there and knitting so much as raised his head up but bowed his head and smote himself on the chest and say God I'm an unworthy sinner he said that man went Justified to his house not the other one Jesus says in Matthew 23 I'm just going to read it to you on Matthew 23. he's referring to the Pharisees he says for they are blind for they bind heavy burdens and Grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers but all their Works they do for to be seen of men that was their motive to be seen of men they make broader phylacteries they enlarge the borders of their garments they love the uppermost rooms at feast and chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets and to be called men be called of men Rabbi Rabbi teacher teacher their motive is wrong and their objective is wrong and that's why Jesus spoke so harshly with him their actions were right their motive and objective was wrong I said God I want my actions dictated by a right motive and a right objective further down in Matthew 20 23 23 says wound you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and anise and come and cumin and I have a mid and have emitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and Faith these ought to you have done and not leave the other undone ye blind guides which strain it in that and swallow a camel woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortions and excess Thou blind Pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter then the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you like unto Whited sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity I say God forbid that I'd ever step into this picture I look back with shame at things I've done things I've said foolishness Pride a need to be accepted fear of rejection all those things motivated conversations and phrasing things a certain way presenting ourselves a certain way I said oh God forgive us for all of that forgive us for our childishness forgive us for our insecurities forgive us for believing the lies of the devil help me God to humble myself to where I don't even have to think about myself anymore real humility is where you just don't think about yourself anymore you've seen people who try to project humility and by trying to project the humility they're just like I'm a worm I'm nothing I'm no good I don't even know why people like me that's not real humility I mean real humility you know who you are I'm a Son of God by the grace of God God's call me to my position I can do nothing without him but by the grace of God I am what I am real humility false humility is trying to project humility so people think well of you and we see a lot of false humility but real humility you don't even think about yourself you don't think good you don't think bad you just don't think about yourself real humility is you're not in the way you're not great you're not the worst creature that ever lived you're just there you're just a tool in God's hand one of God's children one that he called by his grace your your one that he's called that he wants to do something with if anything good comes it's him real humility is balance real humility is in the middle of the road real humility is a false humility is you're the object you're always focused on I can't believe I did that I'm such a fool I'm such a disaster nobody should talk to me you're still paying attention to yourself way too much other humility is did you see what I did did you see how I did that was everybody looking when I did that both of them are Pride when we come in the middle we just step out of the picture and it's not about us I'm not the most important one ah nobody's really paying attention to me and I don't really want anybody to pay attention to me I want them to pay attention to God I'm a tool in his hand i'm something that he's using I'm his son I'm part of his bride but he's he's not a worm amen I've been redeemed from that I've been brought to his side how can I call myself such horrible things when he calls me bride but I'm nothing without him I'm right here in the middle a correct view of ourselves amen and then we don't have to worry about ourselves we don't talk about ourselves we don't talk good we don't talk bad we don't have to spend all this time paying attention we can start getting on with the work of God and letting him be the great one let him have success let him do what he wants to do and us just stay out of his way God heal us of our complexes God heal us of our insecurities God Deliver us from our pride so that you can really get on with the work that you've left for this day for this hour he goes on to saying the message God's only provide a place of worship he says now you can't take your sincerity in all that you want to confess you just can't take it to the Methodist altar to the Baptist altar to the Pentecostal altar but there is an altar somewhere that he chose that he put his name in it and he would meet you at that place now if you get everything running just right it's going to run everything set in order if there's a short in the wire that light won't come on because it's been grounded and when you take one of God's words or one of his places and in your own heart have selfish objectives it'll ground the power of God right there if you do it because you want to be smart you want to be different from somebody else or something right there it's grounded it'll blow the fuse you're wrong you've got to come with sincerity with all your heart your motives and your objectives placed on God then search for his place find where he said and bring it there oh God line up our motives and objectives and the message perfect strength by Perfect weakness he says the important thing one of the important things that we must Master now remember this and especially you young preachers so I'm taking this for myself I'm still believe I'm a young preacher especially young preachers and lay members alike there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us hey man let's go to First Corinthians 8. I referred to this but I want to read it together first Corinthians chapter 8. and we're winding down here to a finish First Corinthians chapter 8. now as touching things offered into Idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth it's amazing all of our spiritual understanding if it doesn't come the right way and if we take it with our arrogant Spirit it can puff up but charity love Capstone love always edifies builds up knowledge that puffs up will tear other people down because in order for me to be puffed up I have to put somebody else down so there has to be other ministers that are not it's good there has to be other churches not as good there have to be other believers not as good we have to be at a higher level than other people to be puffed up but charity doesn't put down charity builds up that's what the word edified mean it builds up real love will build up everywhere you can build up let's keep reading and if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know so any of us who thought we knew the message let's apply this scripture I don't even know it as I ought I don't even know it like I really need to know it I don't even know it like God really wants me to know I don't even know it to its fullest extent do you know the word yes I know the word but I don't know it like I ought to know it I want to know it more I want to constantly strive for greater Vision greater word greater understanding greater manifestation Greater Life I want to constantly be pressing forward amen I want to Die daily Paul didn't die once Paul died daily Paul took up his cross and followed after Christ because he realized he was going to have to stay dead be dead stay dead and carry and pack around his own cross I said God help us to stay dead myself and alive in Christ I can humbled ourselves he this is the last quote I'll read from humble myself from this message he said look at Jesus nothing but one bundle of love he was God's he was God manifested he God expressed himself through him no wonder Miracles and things happen his humble life and consecrated life to come from being God to be a man here on the earth to express God through himself that's what made him what he was I've always said what made Jesus God to me was the way he humbled himself he was so great and yet he could be so small he said that's what made him God to him was his ability to Humble himself you know the devil can't humble himself Lucifer can't humble himself he exalted himself God can humble himself I want to be a child of God so I want the attributes of my father I want the ability to humble myself he said in the message presuming he said bless God I'm a one that's Hallelujah bless God I'm an assembly glory to God I'm a Church of God we're this kind we're that kind you're nothing oh I love that you're nothing as long as you think that you're nothing the Bible said when a man thinks himself something he's nothing he has nothing that he ought to be that's exactly right you think yourself nothing come down so empty yourself found you're trying to fill your yourself up you empty the biggest job for the church and the individual is empty itself that's rough but it's good what do I need to empty I don't need to empty myself of the word I don't need to empty myself the spirit of God I need to empty myself of myself I need to get rid of things that I got from my grandparents and my parents picked up as a child I need to let those things not influence me not run the day but I need them exposed so I can ask God God help me to cast this aside help me to discard that thinking help me to get rid of that feeling you know there's if you ever had a feeling before oh yeah we're human beings you ever had a negative feeling have you ever had a negative feeling towards another human being okay stop feeling that how do you stop feeling that you get to a place where you get on your knees and you recognize God this isn't according to your word I'm not supposed to have ought towards your brother I'm not supposed to have ought towards nobody God would you come and Purge this out of my heart I need your help I'm dying to this and asking you to take it away amen so many times we try to just pretend we don't feel this way or pretend that or I don't do this I stop feeling that way I mean our emotions are really hard to control there's times when you just have to get on your knees and say God I've carried this too long I'm still hurt about things in the past I still have awe against people who are now dead people have wronged me family members and people in churches and God it's time that I got rid of this and I can't do it myself I can't just say I'm not going to be hurt anymore I need to lay this at your feet and if God if I give this to you will you take it from me because it doesn't belong it's not part of your word God help me to forgive from my heart amen how do you get from your heart when your heart is still angry and your heart is still bitter amen you need God to come heal your heart so that you can forgive from your heart we need to be honest we need to be real we need to be genuine we need to Humble ourselves and ask God to have mercy on us and not just continue kicking the can down the road and act like things are going to go away we need to deal with some things get them purged so that we can stay humble reverent humble with our brothers and sisters and that that love can begin to project out of us the devil put a lot of traps in you and I put a lot of roadblocks and a lot of hindrances in our heart to keep us from really expressing what God wants us to express in this day he saw to it that you got hurt and you were wounded and you may have been abandoned you may have been neglected you may have had people uh uh uh tear down your name you may have had false accusations brought against you you may have had all kinds of things that's happened to in your life amen and all kinds of cruel things said about you and rejections and and that's just the devil trying to stop a manifestation of God before it gets started but I'm telling you there's a balm in Gilead there's a Holy Ghost and there's a word that promised us that he'll heal all of our diseases and when he came he come to bind up the Brokenhearted amen those of a contrite heart amen those things that he just as much as he's here to heal diseases he's healed to hear your heart too yeah if we take those things to him and say will you heal me he's not going to turn his back on us amen we're asking him Lord this thing's a stumbling Stone this is a hindrance to me this is keeping me from projecting the love I want to protect this can constantly holding me back and making me suspicious of people God would you come and clean my heart if I give it to you will you take it from me Lord and help me to forgive those who wounded me forgive my brothers forgive my family forgive so that I can be free to express your love to this world so that I can be what you've called me to be brother bam said we're going on a journey in this journey you don't pack for you unpack when we get there everything's already provided there's nothing we need to take he's going to pick our souls up and take us but we're in the process now of unpacking unpacking complexes unpacking ideas unpacking selfishness unpacking wrong motives unpacking Pride I say God I got a lot to unpack help me God to unpack help me to die help me to surrender help me to give up why because this manifestation of the third pool requires all of us working in harmony together it's going to be through the bride and the bride is one body and that one body is not to have strife and contention but it's to be in Harmony and love every member loving one another in each joint supplying and edifying one another we need to grow we need to grow Beyond ourselves we need to grow Beyond a lot of things that we've allowed to trouble us because in order to get on with the program of God 's going to need all of us to Humble ourselves and be humble with one another to be surrendered to be tender to be soft to be sweet and meek and humble and loving I'm ready for unpacking there's things I've carried too long and I want to unpack them there's things that other people handed me that I've been carrying but I want to unpack that one too there's things that people threw on me that I never wanted but by the grace of God I can unpack them now God would you help me unpack help me empty out help me be free help me be free from Pride help me be free from selfishness help me be free from rejection fears complexes help me be free I want to be a vessel that you can flow through so easily and that others will come in contact with and recognize there's something different here Christ is here amen so that they don't see me they see you in me amen First Corinthians 10 12 gives us a warning said wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall that old proud Spirit well how's it thinking we're fine I'm fine I've served God so many years I'm fine I know this I know that I'm fine he that thinketh he stand that should take heed lest he fall I say rather than trying to stand it might be easier just to fall at his feet and say God I can't stand without you I can't stand unless you're holding my hand I can't stand unless you help me out I can't stand unless you're standing beside me I can't do it on my own I don't want to think that I've got this figured out or I've got it in the bag or I've been so many years and so long and done so well and accomplished so many things and have finally we'll know when we finally get to that place because I think our atoms will change until then I want to be striving for the Mastery for the goal I want to be faithful striving for the Mastery let's all stand together please Blake if you're common musicians and let's just bow our heads and our hearts before the Lord say here heavenly father I thank you Lord Jesus you're so merciful to us God you're so faithful to come to us in every stage of life and in every need that we have God you're so good to never let us just keep plowing on keep pushing keep acting like everything's all right but there's times special times you give us an opportunity to stop push the pause button and say God show me where this is coming from Lord help me to get rid of this Pride selfishness God show me my motives and my objectives take the sword of your word and discern the thoughts and intents of My Heart Lord I pray Lord for all of us as we're unpacking would you help us Lord help us peel US Open and show those things in US Lord that are contrary that's hindering our walk that's stopping your expression in our lives and help us to turn loose of it Lord to take our fingers off of it and let it go that you can take it from us Lord I pray that you would pour the balm of Gilead in our hearts pour healing into US Lord make us whole make us what you called us to be may we stand as your bride on this Earth a vessel completely surrendered to you and may you be the only one who has influence in us not other Spirits Lord not other touch points not other hooks from the past but may we be free Lord so that you're the one with influence in our lives may you move us Lord give us a real humility a real humble Spirit Lord where we can humble ourselves amongst ourselves or we can be humble to one another and we as an assembly can be humble before you that you can accomplish what you've left for this hour God you told us so many times the Way Up Is Down all through the scriptures your Prophet come and reinforced it Lord we're coming to recognize it's true Lord we know that that's the true way is the Way Up Is Down help us gone will you lead us along the way would you take us by the hand and Shepherd us Lord till we can be Freer than we've ever been before free to follow free to express free to believe free to love move every roadblock out of the way remove every obstacle from our hearts Lord let our hearts soar Lord with freedom that only you can give God give us love for people love for one another a love that was surprised the unbeliever like your Prophet said they were so shocked at how they loved one another that was their testimony of the first church age my how they love each other your Apostle John instructed us Above All Things love one another God there's so many things that are handicapping that process remove it from us Lord and not just one another help us to love the way you love all men give us compassion and desire to see lives changed and people helped for God when your Prophet was coming from the seals and knowing that his ministry must move higher he knew that he had to change he had complexes he had ill feeling he felt rejected and felt like the people should have heard him and he had to have a change if he had to have a change Lord I have to have a change I needed change to come into this third pool manifestation to reflect you on this Earth in fullness to be you on this Earth I need a change in Me Lord and I need that change to continually change me until I come into your perfect stature into your perfect image Lord I'm keeping laying myself down at your altar and saying Lord Purge me cleanse my heart free me from the traps of the devil from the snares and the hooks remove them Lord God I thank you for your word I thank you Lord for the sword of the spirit that will come and discern thoughts and intents of the heart you've laid us bare Lord but that's what your word said you would do that we are naked in your sight and you have demonstrated tonight just how much you know us Lord God I pray that as we lay here that we wouldn't try to cover up with religious excuses that we wouldn't try religious rhetoric and phrases and words but that we would just lay bare before you and say Lord strip us naked and clothe us in your word take everything else away and clothe us in your own righteousness and your word manifested in US take this word and make it our garment Lord May our filthy rags be dispersed of and may your Holiness project through us for we're surrendering ourselves to you afresh we love you God we ask that you would take us Lord you have plans that we can't even fathom you have works that you left undone that you did not complete in your Earthly Ministry now you're going to do it in and through your bride and you're doing it now and there's more to come help us God to stay out of the way and be fully surrendered we love you thank you for your word we we thank you for what you're doing in our lives for this word came to wash us by the washing of the water of your word and
