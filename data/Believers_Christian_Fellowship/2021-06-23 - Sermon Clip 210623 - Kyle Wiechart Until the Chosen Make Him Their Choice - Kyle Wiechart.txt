TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i don't think we should constantly be looking of i want to stay comfortable i don't want to cause problems i want everybody to like me i want to get along with everybody i'm sorry i don't believe that's what a christian does in this day and age how can we live in satan's eden with this nonsense and only come and shout and praise god at the service and then go out and kiss baal out and be friends with the world i don't think we can do that anymore i think that is done i think we're going to have one opportunity one opportunity to present ourselves in the right wedding garment before the king and i don't want to be one of those fair young virgins that were chosen just to present what kind of life and style and presentation i wanted to give him i want to be presenting to him what he desired and only what fits in that is all i want to bring to him and if it doesn't fit god help me get me in that dress cut me shape me put me on a strict lettuce diet i don't know whatever you gotta do get me in that dress you know what i'm saying i'm not just saying i'm not sometimes we come when we when we shout we praise god and we should praise god but you realize that this word was given to you to mold you to shape you to get you into the form of his bride it's not just something we rally around and just say praise god we rally around with humble bowed faces and tears saying god i'm not fitting in that dress get me in that you do what you've got to do you cut me to pieces you shred me you fall you fall let me fall upon the rock and be broke into pieces i gotta get in there
