[12:31] he is everywhere he's there by uh he's
[12:34] omnipresent omniscient amen he's all of
[12:36] those descriptive

[12:45] there is children of god amen it doesn't
[12:47] matter
[12:48] what country what church what what is

[12:55] the song said
[12:56] has to have she with their little
[12:58] antennae up amen
[13:00] picking up what the word is trying to
[13:02] say in this day
[13:04] and i tell you what she is not weak she
[13:07] is not broken down amen she's not
[13:09] hunched over from the load of laodicea
[13:12] amen but she is vibrant and full of her
[13:15] husband amen
[13:17] she she knows by revelation that he is
[13:20] the same yesterday today and forever
[13:22] amen
[13:22] hallelujah that's the god that we serve
[13:25] amen
[13:26] you you should this whole past year i'm
[13:29] sure that he's growing you in the fact
[13:30] that you
[13:31] you change your whole thinking on prayer
[13:34] and and when you pray
[13:35] you say hey let's pray as a family and
[13:37] we're going to speak that into existence
[13:39] amen
[13:42] hallelujah that's you amen
[13:46] and we've been doing that this whole
[13:47] year god's been doing things and doing
[13:49] things and doing things
[13:51] amen and so it it's all about
[13:54] relationship amen it's all about brother
[13:56] mam said
[13:56] if if we it's not the big things we
[13:58] leave undone but it's the little things
[14:00] that we leave
[14:02] out amen hallelujah but when you come
[14:05] into an intimate relationship then you
[14:08] begin
[14:09] to have a love affair to do the little
[14:12] things amen
[14:13] and this message is not about do's and
[14:15] don'ts but it is about a love affair
[14:17] amen
[14:18] hallelujah and so i wanted to start out
[14:21] with joshua because we're going to look
[14:23] at
[14:23] uh some other scriptures in first samuel
[14:26] chapter four and chapter five and
[14:28] and there's there's some of my favorites
[14:29] because it really gives the devil the
[14:31] black eye
[14:33] and so we i wanted to start off with
[14:35] something positive because we're gonna
[14:37] have to talk about some negative things
[14:38] but we're we're bringing it back hey man
[14:41] uh you gotta stretch this way sometimes
[14:43] to come back in the middle and stretch
[14:45] this way to come back in the middle
[14:46] but i but i know that my redeemer lives
[14:51] amen and as you as his bride those that
[14:54] are converted
[14:55] those that are predestinated hallelujah
[14:58] amen you should have a confidence the
[15:00] the scripture says that that we are the
[15:03] head and not the tale
[15:04] amen the the the prosperity people
[15:07] hijack that
[15:08] but that is for us amen what goes
[15:11] first forward it's the head and the head
[15:13] is higher than the body amen
[15:15] what what is the last anointing for this
[15:17] age it's an eagle
[15:18] so that you can see all the potholes in
[15:21] the road bumps amen
[15:22] that is not for the church member that
[15:24] is not for the unbeliever that is for
[15:26] you the bride of christ amen hallelujah
[15:30] so i know that god wants us to take a
[15:32] hold
[15:33] of him tonight amen and and just believe
[15:36] him
[15:36] and receive him hallelujah praise the
[15:39] lord jesus
[15:41] first samuel 4 3-11
[15:45] and when the people were come to into
[15:48] the camp the elders of israel said
[15:50] wherefore hath the lord spitting us
[15:52] today before the philistines
[15:55] amen see remember joshua did the same
[15:57] thing he fell on his face and he goes
[15:59] god
[15:59] why did we lose these men why and god
[16:02] goes
[16:04] joshua get up there's sin in the camp
[16:07] joshua goes
[16:08] oh okay amen so god had to tell him what
[16:12] was going on
[16:13] because joshua's went back to oh what
[16:15] are they going to think that god brought
[16:17] us out and didn't deliver his people
[16:20] no there was sin in the camp amen and so
[16:22] joshua took
[16:23] courage then and he went and found the
[16:25] sin and they purged the sin
[16:27] amen it says let us fetch the ark
[16:30] of the covenant of the lord out of
[16:32] shiloh unto us
[16:33] that when it cometh among us it may save
[16:36] us out of the hand of the enemies
[16:38] do you hear what he said it isn't amen
[16:41] but did you hear what they said
[16:43] there was no remorse there was no
[16:45] repentance of
[16:46] life there was no oh god have we sinned
[16:49] have we done something or not done
[16:50] something
[16:51] go get the go get the the ark amen and
[16:54] bring it and
[16:55] it will deliver us hallelujah
[16:59] so the people sent to shiloh that they
[17:02] might bring
[17:03] forth thence the ark of the covenant of
[17:05] the lord of hosts which dwells between
[17:07] the cherubims
[17:08] and the two sons of eli hofney and
[17:11] phineas
[17:12] were there with the ark of the lord our
[17:14] god
[17:16] talk about two scoundrels
[17:19] perverts destroyer of people's faith
[17:24] but the people oh here comes the ark oh
[17:26] the priest you know they're carrying it
[17:28] and it's just
[17:29] see there's no conscience there's no
[17:31] consciousness of
[17:32] of of god there it's all a form amen
[17:37] and when the ark of the covenant of the
[17:39] lord came into camp all israel
[17:41] shouted with the great shout so that the
[17:43] earth rang again amen they got cited
[17:46] because they were in a meeting and their
[17:47] favorite pastor
[17:49] and minister was there amen hallelujah
[17:52] and so and when the philistines heard
[17:56] the noise of the shout
[17:57] they said what mean at this noise of
[17:59] this great shout
[18:01] in the camp of the hebrews and they
[18:03] understood that the ark of the lord was
[18:05] coming to the camp
[18:06] and the philistines were afraid for they
[18:08] said god
[18:09] is common to the camp see they they had
[18:12] heard they haven't they hadn't tasted it
[18:14] firsthand
[18:15] but they'd heard the testimony of what
[18:18] would happen
[18:19] and they began to be afraid amen and and
[18:22] they said
[18:23] whoa unto us for there hath not
[18:26] been such a thing heretofore woe
[18:29] unto us who shall deliver who shall
[18:32] deliver us out of the hand of these
[18:34] mighty gods
[18:35] these are the gods that smote the
[18:36] egyptians with all the plagues in the
[18:38] wilderness
[18:39] be strong and and quit yourself right
[18:41] men oh you philistines see someone spoke
[18:43] up
[18:44] that you be not servants unto the
[18:45] hebrews as they have been
[18:47] unto you quit yourselves like men and
[18:49] fight
[18:50] they were going to fight it they were
[18:51] going to fight to the death amen
[18:54] hallelujah
[18:59] oh ye philistines that you okay and the
[19:02] philistines fought
[19:03] and israel was smitten and they fled
[19:06] every man into his tent
[19:08] and there was a very great slaughter
[19:11] for their fell of israel thirty thousand
[19:13] foot men
[19:14] and the ark of the of god was taken and
[19:17] the two sons of eli
[19:18] hofney and phineas were slain amen
[19:21] and so what had just happened
[19:24] they were they were message believers
[19:28] amen and and and we're going to see
[19:31] that what went on up to this point
[19:34] is that there there was a a a dropping
[19:38] of the ball
[19:38] i say that in the leadership of what god
[19:42] really wanted and the communication of
[19:44] that love affair that jehovah god wanted
[19:47] and so all of these people went into
[19:49] battle thinking that they were covered
[19:51] by the blood
[19:52] and they were not amen hallelujah
[19:56] praise the lord the israelites had been
[19:58] a long time without the
[20:00] without the truth in reality amen
[20:03] and so i'm not speaking tonight really
[20:06] of signs and wonders and miracles
[20:08] i'm talking about the truth of reality
[20:10] of
[20:11] all of your your feelings your thoughts
[20:14] amen your job your school
[20:17] amen a need that arises that all things
[20:21] are brought under subjection
[20:23] casting down all imagination and
[20:25] anything that exalts itself against god
[20:27] because you are not a church member
[20:30] you're not a make-believer
[20:31] you are part of jesus christ amen and
[20:34] you have to stay with it amen you can't
[20:38] you can't give up your rights amen glory
[20:41] to god
[20:42] praise the lord they had been too long
[20:46] without reality
[20:48] so they didn't know brother madam speaks
[20:51] frequently that
[20:52] people are good people they just weren't
[20:53] taught right amen
[20:56] they didn't understand that there's a
[20:58] way of approach to god
[21:00] and a way for him to come on the scene
[21:03] and there's a way for him to manifest
[21:05] the way of his word
[21:07] amen he he's everywhere he that anointed
[21:11] word is here tonight amen
[21:12] and he's looking for somebody to say yes
[21:16] lord he's looking for somebody to say
[21:18] lord
[21:19] i'm gonna believe this word no matter
[21:22] what no matter if i have to wear a mask
[21:26] no matter if i have to drive the speed
[21:28] limit
[21:32] right
[21:35] the devil doesn't look at this pass
[21:39] that says i'm a message believer i can
[21:41] break all the laws
[21:44] amen i'm just being honest
[21:48] that this has been good because it's
[21:49] really brought out some little old men
[21:51] and little
[21:52] ladies who are rebels
[21:59] praise the lord but god god god's
[22:02] spanking us enough
[22:04] that we finally wake up and say oh
[22:07] because see
[22:11] and i know your pastor preached on this
[22:13] but i i i like to kind of
[22:15] poke the bear a little bit
[22:20] do you think he's going to bless you if
[22:21] you don't pay your tithes or give
[22:22] offerings
[22:25] no you may think he does
[22:30] but he doesn't amen
[22:33] do you see what i'm trying to say is
[22:35] what what is
[22:36] what defines the bride of jesus christ
[22:40] every word agreeing with it believing it
[22:43] every word
[22:44] and so that's all the little things and
[22:46] so that's what i'm trying to
[22:47] encourage us tonight we can't walk all
[22:50] over uh these things and
[22:54] that's why god let the covenant come
[22:56] amen
[22:57] so that we would release our rights a
[22:59] paul and silas
[23:01] they didn't fight for their rights amen
[23:05] there's too much politics we're too much
[23:07] a democrat or republican we need to be
[23:10] christians amen
[23:11] hallelujah and because god's pulling us
[23:14] out of laodicean spirits
[23:17] so that we can walk with him amen
[23:20] hallelujah we want to walk with him in
[23:22] love
[23:22] amen when i speak something i expect it
[23:24] to manifest amen
[23:27] amen hallelujah but see they had been so
[23:31] long without that
[23:32] that they had forgotten but there's
[23:34] there's hope and we're going to see it
[23:36] in a little bit amen
[23:37] god god had a little boy raising up
[23:40] in the temple who was sold out amen
[23:44] hallelujah he has brides all over this
[23:46] world
[23:47] raised up for this day to sell out and
[23:49] just to say
[23:50] there's nothing wrong we are right where
[23:53] we're supposed to be hallelujah
[23:55] we are more than conquerors amen amen
[23:59] and i'm going to give some testimonies
[24:00] in a while but it's not a work up
[24:02] amen it is an absolute no-so hallelujah
[24:07] see the philistines knew what that ark
[24:09] meant isn't it strange that israelites
[24:11] really didn't have a revelation of that
[24:14] there's other
[24:15] there's other people on the outside of
[24:16] this uh what we call the message
[24:19] and they they have better revelation of
[24:21] the reality
[24:23] of the word than some message people do
[24:26] hallelujah but but don't worry the bride
[24:29] she's right where she's supposed to be
[24:30] amen
[24:31] hallelujah proverbs 14 12
[24:34] there is a way that's which seems right
[24:36] unto a man
[24:38] but the end thereof is the ways of death
[24:41] oh that's what this year has done
[24:44] give up just finally relax and let god
[24:49] lead don't be afraid to step out don't
[24:51] be afraid to pray and speak something
[24:54] into existence
[24:55] when you go to a hotel don't you pray
[24:57] and bind those spirits
[24:59] that is you're speaking an atmosphere
[25:01] into existence
[25:02] and so with the and see you can't do
[25:05] this and be religious
[25:06] you can't do this and just be a message
[25:08] person amen
[25:09] you have to be in christ amen
[25:13] hallelujah ii samuel 22
[25:16] 29 and 31 for thou
[25:20] art my lamp o lord praise god
[25:23] and the lord will lighten my darkness
[25:28] for by thee i have run through a troop
[25:31] by my god have i leaped over a wall as
[25:34] for god
[25:36] his way is perfect and the word of the
[25:38] lord is tried
[25:40] get that he is a buckler that all
[25:43] them that of all that trust in him
[25:47] amen and so the word amen
[25:50] not your thought not your favorite
[25:52] pastor not your favorite evangelist
[25:54] the actual word and you say well how do
[25:56] we know what is the actual word
[25:58] because it manifests it comes to pass
[26:01] amen
[26:02] and so when that is tried in your life
[26:05] then you know he is your shield and
[26:08] buckler
[26:08] you know absolutely that what you say
[26:12] will come to pass amen and don't doubt
[26:14] in your heart
[26:15] because you are part of him don't you
[26:18] set down in his throne
[26:22] you have authority over everything
[26:26] that's the earmark that's the trait of
[26:29] the bride amen
[26:30] that's why you're persecuted
[26:34] because you don't paul says i don't
[26:36] judge myself by others
[26:38] and that's why i don't i don't we don't
[26:40] judge ourselves by other message people
[26:42] right
[26:43] we don't judge ourselves by other other
[26:45] churches because last time i checked
[26:47] we're all sovereign
[26:49] but it's those that compare themselves
[26:52] with themselves
[26:53] that's a dangerous road to walk amen
[26:56] you you your grandmother your father
[26:58] your mother
[26:59] art is not your experience but you have
[27:01] to
[27:02] let go and compare your life with the
[27:04] word amen
[27:06] and i'll keep saying it over and over
[27:08] there's nothing greater than the word
[27:09] amen
[27:10] and i'm not just saying that i'm really
[27:12] meaning the word
[27:14] hallelujah and so the revelation of the
[27:18] bride
[27:19] allows her the revelation of the bride
[27:22] allows her to have a living
[27:26] expectation amen good people are
[27:30] may not be there yet but we all have to
[27:32] come to adoption we have to be useful in
[27:34] the body
[27:35] amen but it's that revelation amen that
[27:39] she has a living
[27:40] expectation on the word amen it's not
[27:43] just a mental concept
[27:45] praise the lord hallelujah and so
[27:49] she expects her god just like the wives
[27:52] expect the husband to fix the car that's
[27:54] in the driveway broke
[27:56] amen just like the wife expects the
[27:59] husband to pay the electric in the gas
[28:01] bill praise
[28:02] the lord but this is a greater
[28:04] expectation
[28:05] yea though i walk through the valley of
[28:07] the shadow of death
[28:08] i will fear no evil and you will only do
[28:11] that
[28:12] as the revealed bride of jesus christ by
[28:15] the word in this day
[28:17] amen what does he do he puts your entire
[28:20] life in order
[28:21] no more out of order there's no more out
[28:23] of order sign in your house
[28:26] praise the lord your kids are in order
[28:33] your relationship's in order
[28:36] well brother how can you say that
[28:39] because i'm
[28:40] speaking it into existence and it's by
[28:43] the word
[28:46] the token puts your house in order
[28:51] well i don't see it well don't quit
[28:54] looking
[28:55] believe it amen it's it's it br
[28:59] i promise you it brings everything into
[29:01] order
[29:02] amen and and god becomes the discerner
[29:05] of the thoughts and intents of your
[29:06] heart
[29:07] and your house amen glory to god
[29:10] he is absolutely real remember this
[29:13] is this is your benefit as a believer
[29:15] tonight amen
[29:16] hallelujah and so there's no other order
[29:20] but the word of god
[29:22] oh we we have fun amen i used to say
[29:26] you know you can put a camera up in my
[29:28] house and and what we are here is there
[29:30] my kids lately they've been going maybe
[29:32] you better take that statement back
[29:34] because you act pretty crazy amen
[29:38] they're probably right but see
[29:42] sometimes things may seem like the will
[29:44] of god
[29:45] and again a lot of good people get told
[29:47] things that
[29:48] brother branham said or or this is where
[29:50] we should go and it may seem right
[29:53] and and but what are what are you doing
[29:55] amen you're you're actually going to
[29:57] step into something
[29:58] step into a situation step into a
[30:01] relationship
[30:02] step into into something that you're
[30:05] going to take on that
[30:07] that may look like the word but it's not
[30:09] the proper time
[30:10] it's not the season amen those that are
[30:13] gonna get married
[30:14] you must be born again amen
[30:17] because then your spouse god will bring
[30:20] the born-again spouse to you amen
[30:23] hallelujah but see it may seem like the
[30:26] will of god
[30:27] but are you allowing god to manifest his
[30:30] word in
[30:30] remember time and season
[30:34] it's all about for the bride time and
[30:36] season praise the lord
[30:38] and so it when you let it be a blessing
[30:41] in the time of season
[30:42] then the blessings will roll from that
[30:45] word
[30:46] it's not you trying to lift yourself up
[30:48] but as you stay
[30:49] in line in order of the word in time and
[30:52] season
[30:53] then you are blessed beyond
[30:55] comprehension
[30:56] the bible says you are blessed going in
[30:58] and you're blessed going out
[31:00] again get your mind off prosperity
[31:04] but i'm not going to sit here and and
[31:07] and
[31:08] and be upset because he meets my needs
[31:13] he says he'll rebuke the devourer he
[31:16] says that he'll meet his your knees he
[31:18] says that he's the same
[31:20] yesterday today and forever he says that
[31:22] your family
[31:24] that your wife's womb amen that all
[31:26] these things are blessed
[31:27] because you're just following the word
[31:30] why was the word restored
[31:32] so the bride could live out a blessing
[31:35] that she could not contain
[31:40] right in the middle of a plague
[31:43] hallelujah we have been blessed
[31:46] amen your flesh and your emotions mind
[31:50] this year
[31:51] all of us have been tore up but i wake
[31:54] up
[31:56] one of them one of them you can't
[31:59] contain
[32:00] it amen because you have been blessed by
[32:03] your husband amen
[32:05] amen blessings are designed to come from
[32:08] the word amen
[32:10] first samuel 5 1-3 and the philistines
[32:14] took the ark of god and brought it from
[32:16] ebenezer
[32:19] unto ashdod when the philistines took
[32:22] the ark of god they brought it into the
[32:24] house of dagon
[32:25] and sat it by dagon this is i think is
[32:28] so
[32:28] god has a sense of humor and when they
[32:30] of ashdod
[32:32] arose early in the morrow behold dagon
[32:34] dagon was
[32:35] fallen upon his face and on the earth
[32:38] before the ark of the lord
[32:39] and they took dagon and set him back up
[32:41] amen this went on for three nights but
[32:43] the last time
[32:44] god cut his head off and cut his palms
[32:46] off and says nothing will stand before
[32:48] me
[32:50] amen i am is here
[32:53] i am the anointed word amen our thoughts
[32:56] our feelings we come to the point where
[32:59] we surrender that
[33:00] because he says nothing will stand
[33:02] before me amen
[33:04] nothing will stand before my word amen
[33:07] and i'm purposely
[33:09] putting you through these trials and
[33:10] tribulations
[33:12] so that you can stand there blessed
[33:15] beyond comprehension amen
[33:18] hallelujah first samuel 5 8-12
[33:22] they sent therefore and gathered all the
[33:24] lords of the philistines unto them and
[33:26] said
[33:26] what shall we do with the ark of the of
[33:28] the god of israel and they answered let
[33:30] the ark
[33:31] of the god of israel be carried about
[33:33] unto gath
[33:34] and they carried the ark of the lord of
[33:36] god of israel
[33:37] about thither and it was so that after
[33:40] they carried it about the hand of the
[33:42] lord was against
[33:43] the city with a very great destruction
[33:46] and he smote the men of the city both
[33:48] small and great and they had
[33:50] emeralds in their secret parts amen
[33:53] therefore they sent the ark to another
[33:56] place
[33:57] they sent the ark of god to ekron and it
[33:59] came to pass as the ark of god came upon
[34:02] came to ekron that the achronites cried
[34:05] out saying
[34:06] they have brought about the ark of god
[34:08] of israel to slay us amen
[34:10] and our people so they sent and gathered
[34:13] all the lords of the philistines and
[34:14] said
[34:15] send away the ark of god of israel and
[34:17] let it go down to its own place that it
[34:19] slay us not
[34:21] and our people for there was a deadly
[34:23] destruction
[34:24] all throughout all the city the hand of
[34:27] god was
[34:28] very heavy there and the men that died
[34:31] not were smitten with the emirates and
[34:34] the cry of the city went up to heaven
[34:37] oh if i ever think of a of a
[34:40] of a church that that just will not
[34:43] allow god to work the way he wants the
[34:46] word to come to pass
[34:48] what is it people died literally in
[34:50] those days amen people
[34:52] died of leprosy literally but see people
[34:55] are dying
[34:55] spiritually because they're they just
[34:58] don't
[34:58] know what this god is all about they
[35:01] think he's defined by their church
[35:04] by their pastor by by what they read or
[35:07] don't read
[35:08] amen and they they they bring a
[35:10] destruction
[35:11] upon them and their family oh
[35:15] it is sad amen and i don't want to see
[35:18] that amen
[35:19] i want god to be unleashed to everyone
[35:22] the proper way in the proper time
[35:24] hallelujah
[35:25] and so the anointed word of god in a in
[35:28] a
[35:28] church is alive and it will pour out a
[35:31] blessing
[35:32] upon individuals but it will also bring
[35:35] ruin and judgment on others
[35:38] that's why you can sit in the same
[35:40] church and somebody says
[35:42] he called me an eagle we had that happen
[35:44] in new zealand
[35:46] somebody my dad was preaching a couple
[35:48] came up to brother gray alfred
[35:50] afterwards and says
[35:50] that man called us chickens brother
[35:54] alfred says well he called me an eagle
[35:56] amen
[35:58] it's whatever you identify with
[36:00] sometimes that you're preaching people
[36:01] start identifying with the mule instead
[36:04] of the thoroughbred horse
[36:06] see that's satan don't let him do that
[36:08] to you
[36:09] he he's a master of mind battles amen
[36:12] and
[36:13] and you in yourself will not win that
[36:15] battle but you
[36:16] always have jesus christ the anointed
[36:19] word
[36:20] ready to pour out the living part of
[36:23] that letter
[36:23] into your life amen hallelujah
[36:27] oh but he's always here amen did you
[36:30] know that the pillar of fire is here
[36:32] right now
[36:36] if we don't believe that something's
[36:38] wrong amen i know you do amen
[36:41] because you're here he's here amen
[36:44] and there's angels all over the place
[36:46] and so
[36:47] i want to see that the people of god i i
[36:52] i want them to regain that lost
[36:54] revelation
[36:55] that personal revelation of this word
[36:59] amen
[37:00] because there's a lack of conviction and
[37:03] care for the word of god amen
[37:05] how can we cast all of our care upon him
[37:08] if we don't know that he really does
[37:10] care
[37:10] i i challenged you to prove him amen
[37:13] there's no
[37:14] time limit on it so you prove it and
[37:16] allow god to work tonight amen
[37:18] hallelujah amen you can't handcuff
[37:22] god he says that you pray and believe
[37:25] he says first here's the big thing you
[37:27] have to repent
[37:31] well brother i i have a revelation of
[37:35] this and
[37:36] i i don't think i need to do this over
[37:38] here repent about this
[37:40] okay but don't plan on getting healed
[37:46] you have to repent that's why when we
[37:49] come to get healed
[37:50] we always repent of anything and say
[37:52] lord quicken something to my
[37:54] to my heart and let me make that right
[37:57] amen
[37:58] god does not heal you if you don't
[38:00] repent
[38:02] praise the lord hallelujah
[38:05] amen see a lack of conviction and you
[38:08] people get so
[38:09] oh we're in the bride and we're this and
[38:11] that have you
[38:14] there's a persecution for those that
[38:16] want to follow the word
[38:18] and i know that you understand that amen
[38:21] hallelujah
[38:22] but but it's because
[38:27] you have a god-consciousness
[38:30] right a woman has a husband
[38:34] consciousness amen
[38:37] and so no matter if he gets fat and bald
[38:39] no matter if she
[38:40] is three or four hundred pounds she's
[38:43] still a revelation
[38:45] he is still a revelation right
[38:48] amen and so no matter what anybody says
[38:51] around you
[38:52] uh in this church or other churches
[38:54] hallelujah it it
[38:56] it may hurt the the feelings a little
[38:58] bit but here say lord
[39:00] i praise you and i thank you because you
[39:02] are my revelation amen
[39:04] and i this puts me under conviction i
[39:07] when you're in your reading you you see
[39:09] something you say lord
[39:10] i'm sorry forgive me for not doing or
[39:13] doing this and god i'm going to put this
[39:15] under the blood
[39:15] and you're going to see a new person
[39:17] amen hallelujah
[39:20] you say well that's just the way it is
[39:23] is it is that sensitivity
[39:27] all over the world i say no in the bride
[39:30] it is
[39:32] and so that's where we have to stop
[39:34] identifying as groups god does not deal
[39:37] with groups he deals with individuals
[39:39] amen
[39:40] and we are at the time when the group
[39:42] called the message
[39:43] is the shock and the bride is the seed
[39:45] of god
[39:46] bride in those churches
[39:51] doesn't mean those are bad people at all
[39:55] it's just i'm not taking up for him
[39:57] anymore
[40:00] love everyone i have no hatred i have no
[40:02] ill feelings towards anyone
[40:05] because i'm part of god i'm a little
[40:08] messiah
[40:08] i have divine love for everyone but when
[40:11] it comes to the word
[40:13] it's the word
[40:18] and you will be shunned
[40:22] by not so much the world but by message
[40:24] people
[40:25] and i just say if you want to do that
[40:27] that's up to you but we're setting here
[40:29] with open arms amen
[40:31] hallelujah but see the philistines they
[40:34] knew what the ark could do
[40:36] they had a revelation of it but
[40:39] when they quickly realized that they
[40:41] were fighting a people
[40:43] who were had just a painted fire then
[40:45] they said oh we see what's going on
[40:47] they don't really believe and they
[40:49] swooped in and they defeated them amen
[40:52] and because they knew that the ark would
[40:54] do them no good amen
[40:57] hallelujah praise the lord
[41:01] this is nuclear power folks
[41:06] see you thought it was just paper and
[41:08] some black and red ink
[41:10] but when god sent a prophet and opened
[41:12] the word to us
[41:13] then it became nuclear power you mean
[41:16] that's been sitting there i've had all
[41:18] these books on top of it god forgive me
[41:20] may i never put anything on this bible
[41:22] amen
[41:23] hallel not even message books this is
[41:26] the word
[41:29] hallelujah don't cover it up don't be
[41:32] ashamed but
[41:34] how many denominational thinking people
[41:36] today are in this same situation
[41:38] where they know intellectually that god
[41:40] is real but
[41:42] but they don't have the conviction or
[41:44] the sensitivity to say
[41:47] i'm gonna do that amen but they they
[41:49] want to worship how they want
[41:52] oh brother i've been in the message a
[41:54] long time and i just don't see
[41:55] i don't think that god that god cares
[41:58] about that
[41:59] okay keep being defeated
[42:02] keep having your kids tore up keep
[42:05] having all these other things going on
[42:07] amen and it's not always like that
[42:09] because sometimes the devil will let
[42:11] that person prosper
[42:13] physically and all sorts of things
[42:17] but when it comes down to it then their
[42:19] families ruined and their wife is ruined
[42:21] or their husbands are on amen
[42:23] because they haven't stayed with the
[42:25] revealed word of the hour amen
[42:28] hallelujah yet these fellow scenes they
[42:31] had no desire to change
[42:33] oh i was some pla actually i was at home
[42:36] church and we had a visitor from another
[42:37] church and
[42:38] afterwards he goes hello pastor he goes
[42:40] that was a nice little message
[42:44] okay see
[42:47] i it doesn't hurt my feelings but i'm
[42:49] looking at him saying
[42:54] you're messed up and you're you're
[42:56] making fun of me
[42:59] see what i'm saying that's the devil but
[43:01] at least we know how to pray for him
[43:03] and that's the thing every time somebody
[43:05] comes against you then you know how to
[43:07] pray for them
[43:08] you don't write them off you just say
[43:10] okay another one on my list praise the
[43:12] lord amen
[43:14] because prayer changes things but see
[43:17] how many people are in that same
[43:19] situation they intellectually know that
[43:21] god is god
[43:23] but they still want to worship in their
[43:25] own flavor of the message
[43:30] amen there's one flavor
[43:34] excuse me it's the living word flavor
[43:39] it's the open word flavor amen because
[43:43] you know what
[43:44] this open word you and i are walking
[43:46] around as little messiahs we're
[43:48] walking around creating atmospheres
[43:50] we're walking around
[43:52] creating our children we're walking
[43:53] around creating our our work we're
[43:55] walking around
[43:57] manifesting that anointed word through
[43:59] us amen
[44:00] only because of the revelation of this
[44:02] anointed word
[44:04] hallelujah praise the lord
[44:07] we couldn't get through this life
[44:09] without this amen
[44:11] amen a denominational christian cannot
[44:14] do this
[44:17] can't they may be coming out of it
[44:20] but that they can't produce this i
[44:22] challenge anybody in the name of jesus
[44:25] i challenge you to to to love
[44:28] to divinely love you can't do it
[44:33] it takes god it's the living word and so
[44:36] the word of god in the days of eli
[44:38] and the child samuel praise the lord for
[44:41] the prophet coming on the scene amen
[44:44] it says that the word of the lord was
[44:45] precious and there was no open vision
[44:48] and so we we we can see that that
[44:52] god it was time and brother braham says
[44:54] that
[44:55] the word is so precious that he has to
[44:57] send it through a prophet
[44:58] and then he distributes it to the
[45:00] ministry amen
[45:02] hallelujah and so it's all god and it
[45:05] wasn't samuel it was god amen
[45:07] god ordained his mother to cry out for
[45:10] him
[45:10] amen and and to to bring him back to the
[45:14] temple
[45:14] where he grew in grace and it says that
[45:18] he had a good report of all the people
[45:20] amen
[45:21] glory hallelujah and so
[45:24] we see that people they they they had
[45:27] drifted in that time
[45:29] so far from the living word and so no
[45:32] no one knew how to activate it it said
[45:35] that
[45:35] phineas and hufny was so vile
[45:39] that they would go and take the meat
[45:41] from the sacrifice before it was even
[45:43] seed in the pot and they would sleep
[45:45] with the women
[45:46] at the gate amen they were just
[45:48] scoundrels amen
[45:50] it got to the place where people didn't
[45:52] even want to go to church anymore
[45:56] i've seen that amen but see
[46:00] they didn't know how to activate it they
[46:01] didn't know how to handle it and they
[46:03] didn't know what kind of a relationship
[46:04] was
[46:05] needed to bring the blessings of the
[46:08] lord
[46:08] alive in your life amen oh hallelujah
[46:13] this is see the word of god is more than
[46:16] just a mental concept
[46:18] it's a living experience amen and so
[46:21] it was the living the god the word of
[46:23] god was so precious
[46:24] it was so powerful and it was so
[46:26] important to god that he sent
[46:28] samuel to be raised up to reveal the
[46:31] word
[46:33] god he loved you and i so much in this
[46:35] day
[46:36] that he sent a prophet to open and
[46:38] reveal the word
[46:39] amen his commission was to open the word
[46:43] amen
[46:44] glory to god and so the reason why eli
[46:48] he compromised because he didn't know
[46:50] about the reality of god
[46:52] he actually he did and he wouldn't do
[46:55] anything about it
[46:57] that's what the foolish virgin is she's
[46:59] dilatory
[47:02] she sees what it is but she doesn't want
[47:05] to do anything about it
[47:07] amen see
[47:10] so none of that reality was passed on to
[47:14] the people
[47:15] and so they just began to accept that
[47:18] the ark of the covenant will be there
[47:20] when they need it
[47:21] and we don't want to go to church
[47:22] because the ministers are scoundrels
[47:26] if we're not back there i don't know
[47:28] where we're at amen
[47:30] see they were supposed to be spiritually
[47:32] leading the people
[47:34] and any minister who's not called that
[47:36] steps into this pulpit you were actually
[47:38] killing souls
[47:42] praise the lord oh just let him preach
[47:46] you know he was he wants to preach so
[47:48] bad
[47:49] oh i've seen that over and over crash
[47:52] and burn every time
[47:53] amen and i'm not making fun but i'm just
[47:56] saying we have to prove all things
[47:58] amen and we and brother chad lets people
[48:01] in who he feels god is wanting them to
[48:02] preach
[48:03] and that's exactly what should be done
[48:05] amen he is the shepherd and he should be
[48:07] suspicious of everyone
[48:10] hallelujah but see he
[48:14] eli knew that his sons were wrong
[48:17] because
[48:17] how do you know brother rich because
[48:19] when samuel
[48:21] had the visitation from god samuel goes
[48:23] now son don't hold nothing back
[48:25] and samuel told everything and and eli
[48:28] says
[48:28] god's will be done he was saying i know
[48:34] why didn't you just correct it because
[48:37] the spirit of the day
[48:39] was so strong amen
[48:42] why don't people today correct the word
[48:45] and the spirit in their life because
[48:47] it's so strong
[48:49] upon the people lay at it people are
[48:51] they walk around saying oh laid to see
[48:53] you can't get me i'm a message believer
[48:54] ah sorry it already has
[48:58] amen that's why god wakes up his people
[49:01] to see the anointed words standing in
[49:03] your midst and
[49:04] every day you're praying you cast down
[49:07] imagination
[49:08] by the word the word the word amen and
[49:11] you're going to see why in a little bit
[49:12] i'm saying that
[49:14] so that spirit of the age weighed heavy
[49:16] upon eli
[49:18] oh laodicea is a terrible thing
[49:21] amen hallelujah but see
[49:24] he didn't realize what that word really
[49:27] meant
[49:28] amen but see there was there was people
[49:30] around israel that did praise god
[49:32] but it was the leadership that needed
[49:34] that revelation
[49:36] and so we know that that that things
[49:38] haven't changed much today amen
[49:40] where ministers lack revelation to
[49:43] preach and to
[49:45] live the life
[49:48] live the life amen
[49:51] the minister has to live the life i
[49:54] challenge any minister to be transparent
[49:57] i
[49:58] challenge you to let people know how
[49:59] much you spend amen
[50:01] i challenge you to let them know how
[50:03] much money is in
[50:04] in the church amen i challenge you uh
[50:07] for all that i
[50:08] challenge you to to say people
[50:11] if i say something up here that's not
[50:13] right you are obligated to come to me
[50:16] hallelujah we are in that kind of day
[50:19] amen
[50:20] hallelujah but see a lot of good people
[50:23] they're held by fear
[50:25] i don't understand it we are
[50:28] we should be the happiest people on the
[50:30] face of the earth
[50:32] amen we should be the most liberated
[50:34] people on the face of the earth
[50:35] we should be saying what can man do unto
[50:37] me i'm full of the holy spirit
[50:40] with the word of god for my day who can
[50:42] touch me
[50:43] amen do you realize that the devil was
[50:46] created defeated
[50:47] amen and that the only authority he has
[50:50] is because people give it to him
[50:54] hallelujah amen
[50:58] hallelujah we need people to preach the
[51:01] word
[51:03] amen i don't care about entertainment
[51:07] it just who cares amen
[51:11] i don't care about program and church
[51:13] dinners and suppers and
[51:15] and church music videos amen i don't
[51:17] care about that
[51:18] that has nothing to do with god
[51:21] hallelujah
[51:22] but see they're held by fear and
[51:26] but but god holds you by love a good
[51:28] marriage holds you by
[51:29] love and what what is the love based
[51:32] upon
[51:32] it's the word only the word amen
[51:38] hallelujah praise the lord and so
[51:40] throughout all this the ark of the lord
[51:43] was still anointed and powerful
[51:45] throughout laodicea
[51:46] and and and now that we have lived all
[51:49] these years and the old fighters are
[51:50] dead amen
[51:51] and god's raising up a people that that
[51:54] he
[51:54] challenges to love them with all their
[51:56] heart amen
[51:57] and and he they are beginning to see
[52:00] that he
[52:00] is an all-powerful god nothing will
[52:03] stand in his way
[52:04] not even cancer not even unbelief amen
[52:08] glory to god praise the lord
[52:12] he's still anointed he's still
[52:14] victorious
[52:16] praise the lord amen can't we see that
[52:20] the lack of teaching has
[52:23] caused a lack of conviction and
[52:25] revelation
[52:26] oh i just want people you can see it
[52:29] sometimes their faces say
[52:31] brother i want to believe that i'm just
[52:33] afraid to step out
[52:34] don't be afraid just start stepping over
[52:37] the cliff amen
[52:38] and let the word manifest praise the
[52:41] lord
[52:42] amen it's no longer time to live in fear
[52:46] it's no longer time to be depressed it's
[52:48] no longer
[52:49] time to to be upset about the rest of
[52:52] the message
[52:52] or about politics amen it's time to
[52:55] see that lovely one who's coming and
[52:58] playing to you
[52:59] praise the lord proverbs 29 18
[53:04] where there is no vision the people
[53:07] perish
[53:08] but he that keepeth the law happy is he
[53:12] how does your vision come by the word
[53:16] well just think if you went to camps and
[53:19] all the ministers were preaching the
[53:21] exact same
[53:22] revelation you talk about a revival at
[53:26] those camps
[53:29] well brother they do they they sing and
[53:32] shout and
[53:33] say amen yeah but they come home the
[53:36] same way
[53:38] so this is rough but what good is it
[53:44] see it should be in the home
[53:48] and so see what's happening is god is
[53:50] getting hold of parents
[53:52] and so the parents are beginning to get
[53:55] this revelation
[53:56] and so their kids are beginning to see
[53:58] firsthand
[53:59] the anointed word coming to pass in
[54:01] their parents
[54:04] that should be the youth camp and and i
[54:06] love getting together i'm not saying
[54:08] that
[54:09] because run jump do whatever you do amen
[54:13] have a good time but it starts at home
[54:18] because that's where they live amen
[54:20] praise the lord and there's nothing
[54:22] wrong with crying out to god
[54:23] none of that i'm not saying that but
[54:25] it's it's all for not
[54:28] if if they're not being taught right and
[54:31] that's why a lot of those ministers go
[54:32] to different camps because they have a
[54:34] burden because the kids aren't being
[54:35] taught right amen
[54:37] proverbs 10 28 the hope this is
[54:40] amplified
[54:41] the hope of the uncompromisingly
[54:43] righteous the upright
[54:44] in right standing with god is gladness
[54:47] but the expectation of the wicked
[54:50] those who are out of harmony
[54:53] with god come to nothing we can't be out
[54:56] of harmony
[54:57] can you imagine if all the musicians
[54:59] were playing a half step
[55:00] different oh you know that doesn't
[55:04] matter they're making a joyful noise
[55:07] oh i'll just let him go
[55:10] no who's in charge our brother there
[55:14] he would come up here and say
[55:18] no it's in whatever
[55:22] see right
[55:26] he's not going to sit there and let him
[55:27] do that and neither is god going to let
[55:29] his church the church of the living god
[55:32] be out of tune because it's an
[55:34] unbeliever who's out of tune
[55:36] who's out of harmony with god and he
[55:38] won't he or she won't stay that way as a
[55:41] daughter or son of god but he'll come
[55:42] into the harmony
[55:44] of the word amen because that's where
[55:46] god meant for us to be
[55:48] is to be harmonious with the word amen
[55:51] oh hallelujah glory to god and i
[55:54] i want to keep going back to this it's
[55:57] only become
[55:58] because jesus christ has been revealed
[56:01] amen
[56:02] in the opening of the word especially
[56:05] from 63 on
[56:09] i love all of it and there he has
[56:13] a lot of the same revelations before
[56:15] that but his
[56:16] commission was for the word
[56:19] was then on amen
[56:24] praise god and so
[56:29] when the armies of israel called for
[56:32] that anointed word to come out
[56:34] and to be in their midst and to defeat
[56:36] their enemies
[56:38] they felt just like before and see that
[56:40] is the stumbling block especially to the
[56:42] young people
[56:43] they say we're supposed to be believing
[56:45] this message and and
[56:46] and they can always go back and show us
[56:48] deep call to the deep and all this other
[56:50] and
[56:50] and tell all the stories and and i love
[56:52] those people but
[56:54] enough is enough it's the generations
[56:57] books are awesome and they're needful
[56:59] but let's create our own book of acts
[57:03] let's i'll say it this way let god
[57:05] create his own book of acts
[57:07] amen and i'm focusing on your attitude
[57:11] towards christ
[57:12] and your family amen and your children
[57:14] and the word of god amen
[57:17] praise the lord jesus and so they were
[57:20] defeated i want us to begin to
[57:22] this one and this one to pop up and say
[57:24] glory to god
[57:25] i i had a need and and and there was
[57:28] some bad feelings
[57:29] between two people and and god came on
[57:32] the scene at my prayer
[57:33] and he delivered us hallelujah
[57:37] amen hallelujah i i don't want to see
[57:41] the bride
[57:42] the bride won't be defeated amen but i
[57:45] want to see all of us start to raise up
[57:48] and get those faith muscles to working
[57:50] hallelujah
[57:51] and so why do you think all the music in
[57:53] the program has changed around this
[57:55] message
[57:56] because the people are defeated the
[57:59] ministry is defeated amen
[58:01] and they're good man but they don't
[58:03] realize that
[58:04] they're allowing the goats to come in
[58:07] because
[58:08] the revelation of the literal word of
[58:11] god
[58:11] has drifted
[58:16] amen i'm sorry if you have to delete
[58:19] this off the website
[58:23] but i've stopped messing around
[58:27] the deception is not out in the
[58:29] denominations it's matthew 24
[58:31] right here amen hallelujah
[58:35] and so the ministry and now the people
[58:39] have lost the vision
[58:43] even the words of their joshua
[58:47] not the bride see the bride is marching
[58:50] onward christian soldier she's growing
[58:52] but see i don't like to see the rest of
[58:55] the people sad
[58:56] and defeated i don't like it pastors
[58:58] don't like that we're shepherds
[59:01] amen i don't want to see people
[59:04] get upset from the preaching i don't
[59:06] want them to to
[59:07] to say you're not going to take my
[59:09] experience away amen i'm not
[59:12] but what is god saying to us amen
[59:16] and so we know that that it was
[59:19] corrupted vessels and hopped me and and
[59:22] and the other one i can't remember his
[59:24] name right now but they were carrying
[59:26] the word of god
[59:27] they didn't love god but the people were
[59:32] putting their confidence in that
[59:33] ministry
[59:35] oh let's
[59:39] let's just get back to god amen let's
[59:41] just get back to the reality of jesus
[59:43] christ amen
[59:45] israel they could not understand why the
[59:47] message of the hour wasn't working
[59:49] why it wasn't effective i had people
[59:50] talk to me brother where's all the
[59:52] miracles
[59:53] where are the victories and i'm going
[59:55] where have you been

[1:00:05] you been for
[1:00:06] our interpreter instantly getting healed
[1:00:08] amen the other day
[1:00:09] where have you been for people coming
[1:00:12] and accepting christ as their savior
[1:00:14] where have you been amen hallelujah
[1:00:19] praise the lord jesus amen don't worry
[1:00:22] little
[1:00:23] flock he's effective amen don't worry
[1:00:26] tonight
[1:00:27] he's still here in his anointed word and
[1:00:30] he will do exactly
[1:00:31] what he says he will do amen hallelujah
[1:00:35] praise the lord
[1:00:39] amen the ark was a plague to the enemy
[1:00:43] you've got god on your hands you're
[1:00:45] going to be plagued
[1:00:47] hallelujah no matter where it went
[1:00:49] though it was powerful
[1:00:51] no matter where this word is no matter
[1:00:53] what house it's
[1:00:54] this sets in it's still atomic weapons
[1:00:56] amen hallelujah
[1:00:58] praise the lord jesus and we can see
[1:01:00] today in his bride all over this world
[1:01:02] he is the anointed he becomes quick and
[1:01:05] powerful and sharper than any two-headed
[1:01:07] sword amen
[1:01:08] hallelujah and he's bringing this one
[1:01:10] and this one into revelation of his
[1:01:12] person
[1:01:13] and you begin to just eat up amen you
[1:01:15] don't have to be told to listen to the
[1:01:17] message you don't have to be told to
[1:01:18] pray or read your word
[1:01:19] amen and your pastor he can look out
[1:01:22] there on sunday
[1:01:23] and see you eating up the word
[1:01:27] hallelujah amen god is equipping his
[1:01:31] bride waking her up
[1:01:32] and bringing her back into the battle
[1:01:34] amen bringing her back with an effective
[1:01:37] sword of the word
[1:01:38] amen bringing her back to every attitude
[1:01:41] and everything that is unlike god you
[1:01:43] cast it down amen
[1:01:45] hallelujah but that's not to the group
[1:01:49] the message
[1:01:50] that's to the individuals in the message
[1:01:54] it's not meant to the church member it's
[1:01:56] meant to the special class of people
[1:01:59] red brown yellow black and white
[1:02:02] you are a super race
[1:02:06] see you've got to start thinking you you
[1:02:08] look in the mirror and it's like

[1:03:58] church but it's not your church
[1:04:00] love your pastor but it's not really him
[1:04:02] he is a conduit

[1:05:40] hallelujah amen and so we know that
[1:05:43] people want to move the word

[1:05:52] bride does
[1:05:53] it may be this you're still going
[1:05:56] forward

[1:05:59] just baby steps you're still going
[1:06:01] forward

[1:06:05] forward

[1:06:11] hot amen
[1:06:12] and and it's uh you know you're getting
[1:06:14] close to the seat of the fire
[1:06:16] all of a sudden you don't back up say
[1:06:18] retreat
[1:06:21] what do you have with you oh i have a
[1:06:24] nozzle
[1:06:24] oh it has lots of water
[1:06:29] you get in closer your low crawl it
[1:06:31] sometimes your ears burn and you
[1:06:33] you can feel it burning through your
[1:06:34] turnouts but you you're not afraid why
[1:06:37] is it you have revelation of your
[1:06:39] turnout gear
[1:06:41] you have revelation of your air pack you
[1:06:43] have revelation of the nozzle
[1:06:45] you have revelation that the engineer is
[1:06:47] going to give you water
[1:06:48] and so you come in there and you say
[1:06:51] what can the fire do to me
[1:06:55] hallelujah what can 2020
[1:06:59] due to you nothing
[1:07:05] oh hallelujah praise the lord
[1:07:09] amen hallelujah see
[1:07:13] if you want to move the word off the
[1:07:14] page do it
[1:07:17] surrender your life just that's that's
[1:07:20] why
[1:07:20] you you comb through that's why you take
[1:07:22] communion calm to your life
[1:07:25] okay i'm all good i'm in the line of
[1:07:27] duty sometimes you're in the line of
[1:07:29] duty and here goes
[1:07:30] and what was that for
[1:07:36] but god's testing you you say okay did i
[1:07:38] do something not do something what's
[1:07:40] wrong
[1:07:40] okay it's good it's the devil okay it's
[1:07:42] the devil onward christian soldiers
[1:07:45] amen see this we have to get our big boy
[1:07:50] pants on we have to get our bride dress
[1:07:54] on
[1:07:56] amen you don't realize the victory that
[1:07:59] you possess
[1:08:00] hallelujah amen and so they they
[1:08:03] couldn't put the
[1:08:04] the word or the ark into into
[1:08:06] manifestation because they didn't know
[1:08:08] it they didn't believe it
[1:08:09] but the bride in this day she recognizes
[1:08:12] it
[1:08:13] and she puts her husband to work you say
[1:08:16] honey i got this big honey-do list and
[1:08:18] jesus christ goes glory
[1:08:21] finally she wants to put me to work
[1:08:26] hallelujah i know i'm a little strange
[1:08:30] maybe a lot but
[1:08:33] that's the way i have to be
[1:08:38] see you know what god wants he wants his
[1:08:41] people to fight
[1:08:43] he wants his people to take his word and
[1:08:45] fight for every inch of ground
[1:08:47] he wants he wants us to say husband i'm
[1:08:50] in a battle come and deliver me
[1:08:53] he goes yes amen
[1:08:56] he wants to give you peace
[1:09:00] hallelujah you're not designed
[1:09:03] for fear you're not designed for
[1:09:07] depression
[1:09:10] amen and so don't go looking up on the
[1:09:13] internet all about these stupid little
[1:09:15] maladies
[1:09:17] and i'm not saying that lightly because
[1:09:18] you're going to see my some testimonies
[1:09:21] the more you feed what that demon is
[1:09:26] the less vic it's going to take longer
[1:09:30] hallelujah you have atomic
[1:09:33] hallelujah and so god he wants to
[1:09:36] protect you
[1:09:37] he wants you to be at peace he wants you
[1:09:39] to serve him with joy unspeakable and
[1:09:41] full of joy
[1:09:42] but see eli he didn't have that
[1:09:44] revelation but that's
[1:09:46] why a samuel came on the scene
[1:09:49] and so god never took his word away from
[1:09:52] israel did he
[1:09:53] he never took his presence was there all
[1:09:56] the time amen
[1:09:57] and he was just as powerful as when he
[1:10:00] opened the red sea amen
[1:10:02] but he had to bring the belief to an
[1:10:06] end the unbelief to an end and and as
[1:10:08] your pastor and all of us
[1:10:10] around we're preaching and belief and
[1:10:12] we're bringing the unbelief
[1:10:14] to an end this is no longer message
[1:10:17] theology
[1:10:18] this is no longer what the pastor thinks
[1:10:20] well i think amen
[1:10:21] no amen the pastor knows that he knows
[1:10:24] that he knows
[1:10:25] and god is saying it's time that
[1:10:27] unbelief is
[1:10:28] terminated hallelujah
[1:10:32] so he rose up with samuel
[1:10:36] and samuel released
[1:10:41] the word into its proper position the
[1:10:44] the fivefold ministry that's called
[1:10:46] releases the word into the proper
[1:10:48] position
[1:10:50] jesus said receive
[1:10:53] the holy spirit brother braham said that
[1:10:56] that is the same
[1:10:57] thing as when you have hands laid upon
[1:10:59] you to receive your healing
[1:11:01] it's a foreshadow of what is coming
[1:11:04] hallelujah
[1:11:05] and so samuel was raised up to release
[1:11:07] the word
[1:11:08] into the proper position and to show the
[1:11:11] people that jehovah god was still
[1:11:13] victorious
[1:11:14] and they were still overcomers amen
[1:11:17] glory to god hallelujah
[1:11:19] amen and it's it's been released today
[1:11:22] god released his word amen he revealed
[1:11:24] it
[1:11:24] and so why are we bumping around amen
[1:11:27] like brother or jewel says wowsy
[1:11:29] wellesley woo him in a message church
[1:11:33] no amen he is the same yesterday today
[1:11:37] and forever
[1:11:38] what has happened good men in the pulpit
[1:11:41] are dilatory
[1:11:43] and they're they're they're preaching a
[1:11:45] lethargic message
[1:11:48] i'm sorry i'm going to offend somebody
[1:11:53] because they say well who are you you're
[1:11:54] nothing
[1:11:56] exactly
[1:11:59] but i know who i am so i
[1:12:02] challenge you to prove me wrong
[1:12:06] because it's not me it's his word just
[1:12:08] like you
[1:12:10] your life challenges people to prove you
[1:12:13] wrong and they can't do it
[1:12:15] amen because you're not dilatory
[1:12:19] you're not lazy you're up and about your
[1:12:21] father's business
[1:12:22] and you're reproducing sheep amen with
[1:12:25] your life
[1:12:25] praise the lord jesus and so the word to
[1:12:29] joshua
[1:12:30] is what the ministry today should be
[1:12:31] spreading
[1:12:33] to the people amen
[1:12:38] deuteronomy 31 3-8
[1:12:42] the lord thy god he will go over before
[1:12:44] thee
[1:12:46] that's you he goes before you and he
[1:12:49] will destroy these nations from before
[1:12:51] thee
[1:12:52] and thou shalt possess them every word
[1:12:54] in that bible
[1:12:55] is yours and joshua he shall go over
[1:12:58] before thee
[1:12:59] as the lord hath said and the lord shall
[1:13:01] do unto them as he did unto cehan and og
[1:13:04] do you realize that cehan's bed was 27
[1:13:07] feet long
[1:13:09] read it
[1:13:13] and unto the land of them whom he
[1:13:14] destroyed and the lord shall give them
[1:13:17] up before thy face
[1:13:18] and they that they may that ye may do
[1:13:21] unto them
[1:13:22] according to all the commandments which
[1:13:24] i have commanded you
[1:13:25] be strong and of good courage fear not
[1:13:28] nor be afraid of them
[1:13:30] for the lord thy god he it is that doth
[1:13:33] go with thee you're not in this
[1:13:34] alone today he will not fail thee
[1:13:37] nor forsake thee and moses called unto
[1:13:40] joshua and said unto them in the sight
[1:13:42] of all israel
[1:13:43] be strong enough good courage for thou
[1:13:45] must go with the people unto the land
[1:13:48] which the lord hath sworn unto their
[1:13:50] fathers to give them
[1:13:51] and thou shalt cause them to inherit it
[1:13:54] and the lord
[1:13:55] he it is that death go before thee he
[1:13:58] will be with thee
[1:13:59] he will not fail they neither forsake
[1:14:01] they fear
[1:14:02] not neither be dismayed amen what are
[1:14:05] you worrying about
[1:14:09] nothing nothing
[1:14:12] hallelujah praise the lord jesus
[1:14:16] amen but see we there's seed that still
[1:14:20] has to come
[1:14:21] amen there's people that still need to
[1:14:24] hear the foolishness of the gospel to
[1:14:26] bring the water upon the seed to bring
[1:14:28] it to life amen
[1:14:30] hallelujah there's still people that
[1:14:31] need to inherit eternal life
[1:14:34] hallelujah and so we we know that
[1:14:38] that the holy ghost is it's here to do
[1:14:41] that
[1:14:42] for us praise the lord amen and so this
[1:14:45] generation
[1:14:46] uh that's why we focus on the on the
[1:14:49] younger people because
[1:14:50] us older ones we we know what god has
[1:14:53] said
[1:14:53] but the newer ones they need to see
[1:14:56] god in skin sometimes and
[1:15:00] and i'm not saying about remember we're
[1:15:02] not talking so much about signs and
[1:15:04] wonders and miracles
[1:15:05] i'm talking about god in skin delivering
[1:15:08] you
[1:15:08] from disease from attitude from
[1:15:11] from all of these things from lost amen
[1:15:14] and greed and all of that amen
[1:15:17] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:15:23] the holy ghost is here the prophet of
[1:15:25] the hour
[1:15:27] uh you misspoke that's brother branham
[1:15:30] no brother brown says the holy ghost the
[1:15:32] prophet of the hour
[1:15:34] did he say it or not praise the lord
[1:15:38] he's looking the holy ghost is looking
[1:15:40] for vessels
[1:15:42] who will allow him to nest in their
[1:15:44] heart amen
[1:15:45] hallelujah praise god amen i'm gonna
[1:15:48] have to skip some of this but
[1:15:51] we know that romans 10 14 and 15 says
[1:15:54] how they
[1:15:54] how should they call in him and whom
[1:15:56] they do they don't believe
[1:16:00] and these are good people how should
[1:16:01] they believe in him whom they have not
[1:16:03] heard
[1:16:04] and how should they they hear without a
[1:16:07] preacher and how shall they preach
[1:16:08] except they be
[1:16:09] sent that is written how beautiful are
[1:16:13] the feet of them
[1:16:14] that preach the gospel of peace and
[1:16:16] breed glad tidings
[1:16:18] and of good things amen
[1:16:23] it's no more stories this is not story
[1:16:25] hour
[1:16:27] this is bride hour this is
[1:16:30] god in living word hour
[1:16:34] this is what he's doing right now amen
[1:16:37] praise the lord jesus amen and amen
[1:16:41] this is about this is about the ministry
[1:16:43] bringing the living
[1:16:45] soul outward of god amen praise god
[1:16:49] hallelujah
[1:16:53] and we'll go into these testimonies now
[1:16:56] throughout all the last year
[1:16:58] he has been molding me into rest
[1:17:04] amen hallelujah
[1:17:08] do you realize that fox news is not the
[1:17:10] news channel of the bride
[1:17:15] do you realize that donald trump though
[1:17:17] he did some good things
[1:17:18] he's a philanderer he's not a nice man
[1:17:25] and last time i checked
[1:17:28] the lord of chaos is not in control god
[1:17:30] is
[1:17:34] i i'm he's brought me to a rest
[1:17:38] and guess what those who have a
[1:17:39] retirement that could be gone tomorrow
[1:17:46] i'm at rest hallelujah
[1:17:51] and so i am at more peace and more rest
[1:17:54] than at
[1:17:55] any other time in my life praise the
[1:17:58] lord
[1:17:58] you're saying through all of that
[1:18:02] absolutely because it's taught me about
[1:18:04] the spoken word
[1:18:08] it is awesome
[1:18:12] and that's because god is still god
[1:18:16] that's because the anointed word is
[1:18:18] still the anointed word
[1:18:20] and so i know some of you know about
[1:18:22] this but
[1:18:23] but i was having trouble and thought i
[1:18:26] had an infection in my kidneys and leg
[1:18:28] and
[1:18:29] and brother tom sister barbara out there
[1:18:31] we're building a
[1:18:32] a rock kind of retaining area on our
[1:18:35] property and and i'm just oh man you
[1:18:38] know
[1:18:38] i'm wore out and and
[1:18:42] i uh after they left i i went to bed and
[1:18:45] i laid down and i
[1:18:47] i really felt like i was dying and so
[1:18:49] when you feel that you tend to pop right
[1:18:51] back up
[1:18:53] it's just like whoa what was that and so
[1:18:56] i come out i said we need to pray
[1:18:58] and so we prayed and
[1:19:02] trying to decide what to do and and so i
[1:19:05] you know
[1:19:06] we've seen a lot of miracles and we've
[1:19:08] been healed a lot and you know that's
[1:19:10] that's just part of us
[1:19:12] and i went to the hospital that's not
[1:19:15] unbelief
[1:19:17] hallelujah and when i got there then
[1:19:20] charity began to uh
[1:19:22] text everybody and and one of the
[1:19:24] brothers sent me a
[1:19:25] i thought it was a prophecy but it was a
[1:19:27] scripture but it was it was
[1:19:29] for me amen and i started feeling better
[1:19:32] before they did
[1:19:34] anything and they didn't really
[1:19:37] they gave me one pill they did find that
[1:19:40] i had blood clots
[1:19:41] plural in my lungs and she almost sent
[1:19:44] me home
[1:19:45] because i was ready to go sure let's go
[1:19:48] you know
[1:19:49] she goes uh let's give you a a ct
[1:19:52] and so so i had that but you know what
[1:19:58] confession lord
[1:20:01] i'm searching my life is there anything
[1:20:03] in there amen
[1:20:04] make things right but also
[1:20:08] if it was just a mental
[1:20:12] concept of god i wouldn't be here
[1:20:16] but something inside
[1:20:19] kept quoting the word
[1:20:24] the word the word and so
[1:20:28] i i went i was back in the pulpit
[1:20:30] preaching that that this happened
[1:20:31] saturday i was back in the pulpit on
[1:20:33] wednesday
[1:20:34] and and and so i'm creating an
[1:20:37] atmosphere i'm not denying anything but
[1:20:39] i'm creating an
[1:20:40] atmosphere and so i tell you that four
[1:20:44] nights
[1:20:45] and anybody i can sympathize with you
[1:20:49] because or empathize is those four
[1:20:52] nights were the worst
[1:20:53] i've ever experienced in my whole life
[1:20:57] have you ever felt like you were
[1:21:01] naked and setting up on a windy cliff
[1:21:06] and no one's with you
[1:21:10] and you can't cry out to a doctor
[1:21:14] or a psychologist or a prophet
[1:21:20] because they're not there but the devil
[1:21:23] is there
[1:21:25] and he was so real
[1:21:30] but what did i have
[1:21:34] the word it is written
[1:21:38] my mouth hurt it was so tired because
[1:21:41] it is written it is this it is this
[1:21:45] it is that four nights it was terrible
[1:21:47] my wife it wasn't for her praying
[1:21:49] us together but where could i run to
[1:21:55] you know who could my favorite minister
[1:21:58] what they
[1:21:58] what could they do for me nothing amen
[1:22:02] but i i kept and it was i tell you
[1:22:05] you talk about the greatest battle ever
[1:22:07] fought that's what it was
[1:22:09] and so for four nights and finally the
[1:22:11] last night
[1:22:12] i just said lord i believe you
[1:22:15] and i i accept my healing in the name of
[1:22:18] jesus
[1:22:19] and i was downstairs and that thing just
[1:22:21] lifted amen
[1:22:22] hallelujah praise the lord amen
[1:22:26] and then saturday i got a kidney stone
[1:22:35] it's like really
[1:22:39] and so it was i was
[1:22:42] i'm glad there wasn't a video but i'm
[1:22:44] rolling around the floor and making all
[1:22:46] sorts of noises and
[1:22:48] and so finally charity goes what do you
[1:22:50] want me to do i said go ahead call 9-1-1
[1:22:53] so she helped me out to the ambulance
[1:22:55] and i get to the hospital and they do
[1:22:57] the cat scan and it's like
[1:22:58] five millimeters not centimeters
[1:23:01] five millimeters and he goes yeah you'll
[1:23:04] pass it
[1:23:04] maybe four days to two weeks and so they
[1:23:08] you know doped me up and sent me home
[1:23:10] and so
[1:23:11] i was praying the next day and i said
[1:23:13] lord we're going on this trip that's
[1:23:14] when we came out here
[1:23:15] and i said lord my desire is that
[1:23:19] you pass this stone before we get on
[1:23:21] that plane
[1:23:24] so we're that day we're flying out to
[1:23:26] ohio
[1:23:27] and that feeling came back and we're
[1:23:30] almost to the airport and
[1:23:32] if you've had stones say man uh that
[1:23:35] night i said
[1:23:36] i told i said people we're not gonna
[1:23:38] make it to the airport unless you pray
[1:23:39] and they they laid hands upon me and
[1:23:42] that thing started to go away
[1:23:44] well we got to our gate and i said well
[1:23:47] i'm going to go the restroom one more
[1:23:48] time
[1:23:51] i don't mean to be graphic but i'm just
[1:23:53] saying
[1:23:55] i went to the restaurant one more time
[1:23:59] and i i didn't want to be weird i'm in
[1:24:01] the bathroom
[1:24:02] and you know you're going oh praise the
[1:24:05] lord
[1:24:06] you know
[1:24:10] but i'm looking and it's like i got i
[1:24:12] i'll admit it i got the light on my
[1:24:14] phone and turned it on it's like
[1:24:16] that is that stone and i come out to
[1:24:19] them i said i just think i passed that
[1:24:20] stone
[1:24:21] and she goes well you spoke it
[1:24:25] amen see but i have other i have other
[1:24:28] examples of that so that's not a
[1:24:30] coincidence amen
[1:24:31] but it's it's it's little and does it
[1:24:34] happen all the time
[1:24:38] when we have a need it's just like god
[1:24:42] i speak that my lawn is going to be one
[1:24:44] one length
[1:24:46] no amen it's when you have a need
[1:24:49] praise the lord and so recently
[1:24:53] just before we came out here the
[1:24:56] medication that i'm on it's a blood
[1:24:57] thinner
[1:24:58] and and when i go home i get to get off
[1:24:59] of it praise god
[1:25:02] and so and i've been normal i feel great

[1:25:27] because your heart's beating so fast
[1:25:28] oh you know he's right there and and
[1:25:31] that spirit
[1:25:34] was coming back again the devil's not
[1:25:36] going to give up
[1:25:38] but he's defeated and so
[1:25:42] one night about uh two weeks ago i i
[1:25:45] just went down to the basement and i got

[1:26:50] have been in depression
[1:26:51] and to tell them that he has delivered
[1:26:54] amen

[1:27:45] enemies
[1:27:46] we are blessed i'm looking at a people
[1:27:49] that are
[1:27:49] blessed beyond their comprehension amen
[1:27:52] you don't realize how fortunate you are
[1:27:55] to have ministry that just wants to stay
[1:27:58] with the word
[1:27:59] it's not common amen but it will give
[1:28:02] you life amen
[1:28:03] it may be hard sometimes but it will
[1:28:06] give you life amen
[1:28:07] it's but we've got to keep feeding on it
[1:28:10] and feeding on and let the
[1:28:12] digestion of the holy ghost put it into
[1:28:14] our limbs and let it manifest amen
[1:28:17] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:28:20] it's the devil's job to buffet us
[1:28:24] but greater is he that is in you than he
[1:28:27] that is in this world amen
[1:28:29] hallelujah brother chad you better come

[1:28:36] hallelujah
[1:28:37] god is good i i hope this was
[1:28:39] encouraging amen
[1:28:40] hallelujah and i i pray that we have
[1:28:44] more of an affinity and a love affair
[1:28:47] for the word because it's real
[1:28:51] amen he will never leave you no forsake
[1:28:53] you
[1:28:54] amen he he the word is a discerner of
[1:28:57] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:29:00] and so whatever you have need of he is
[1:29:05] supplying you brother
[1:29:17] it's all stand i was encouraged amen
[1:29:22] one thing i was thinking about the
[1:29:25] message what i was preaching was
[1:29:27] there's an encouragement for two things
[1:29:29] for me an encouragement to surrender
[1:29:32] and encouragement to believe and i wrote
[1:29:35] this down right at the end
[1:29:37] that if we want god to be real how many
[1:29:39] wants god to be real
[1:29:41] if we want god to be real then we have
[1:29:43] to be real
[1:29:45] so many times we want god to be real but
[1:29:47] we don't want to have a real confession
[1:29:49] and a real life that matches the word
[1:29:50] and a real surrender
[1:29:53] but if we want a real god then let's be
[1:29:55] a real believer
[1:29:57] let's give him our lives and know that
[1:30:00] we've surrendered that we've given
[1:30:01] everything to him and everything he
[1:30:03] reveals to us we repent of it
[1:30:04] we put it under the blood we make it
[1:30:06] right so that we can stand with
[1:30:08] confidence that there's nothing between
[1:30:09] me and god and there's nothing to hinder
[1:30:11] the word from coming to pass
[1:30:13] and then let's do what brother rich
[1:30:14] encourage us just move forward in the
[1:30:17] word
[1:30:18] he said i've surrendered my life i've
[1:30:19] given god everything he knows i love him
[1:30:21] he knows i'm being real for him in my
[1:30:23] perfect note but i'm being real
[1:30:26] i'm confessing i i'm surrendering i want
[1:30:29] him to have all of me and because i give
[1:30:33] him all of me
[1:30:34] i want to have all of him amen amen i'm
[1:30:38] encouraged just
[1:30:39] to believe to believe that i'm his
[1:30:43] to believe that there's a personal love
[1:30:45] affair between him and i
[1:30:48] can you just believe that i believe it's
[1:30:50] not it's not about whoever is around me
[1:30:52] i mean they can be included too i have
[1:30:54] nothing against that but the real love
[1:30:56] affair is just between me and him
[1:30:58] he knows me and i know him and i want to
[1:31:00] know him more
[1:31:02] and i want more of him and i want him to
[1:31:03] have more of me
[1:31:05] and i want to see that life manifest
[1:31:08] the message didn't come so that we could
[1:31:11] have books
[1:31:13] the message didn't come so that we could
[1:31:15] have doctrine
[1:31:17] the message came to set us free so that
[1:31:20] we can live
[1:31:21] the life he's always called us to live
[1:31:23] that we could be real believers
[1:31:25] amen real christians what god always
[1:31:27] wanted his bride to be
[1:31:28] the message came to make us that
[1:31:31] and i say that's what i want to be and
[1:31:34] i'm not going to wait for everybody else
[1:31:35] around me
[1:31:36] i'm going to do my part amen god bless
[1:31:39] you let's sing blake do you have a song
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:53] no matter what circumstance or what i
[1:31:57] feel or see the word is
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:35] no matter what the circumstance or what
[1:32:38] i
[1:32:38] feel
[1:32:46] brother rich gave us some good
[1:32:48] instruction tonight
[1:32:50] if you wanna if you're gonna take god at
[1:32:51] his word it's not gonna be a five-minute
[1:32:53] deal
[1:32:54] because the devil's not bringing a
[1:32:56] five-minute battle amen but if you're
[1:32:57] going to take god at his word you got to
[1:32:59] keep taking in mata's word
[1:33:01] and you've got to be able to say the
[1:33:03] word is working mightily in me when you
[1:33:05] see nothing and feel nothing and nothing
[1:33:07] seems to be changing
[1:33:09] but you still know that because of the
[1:33:11] virtue of his word and the virtue of god
[1:33:14] that i know that this word will work
[1:33:16] because he's god
[1:33:17] and he cannot lie and his word cannot
[1:33:20] fail
[1:33:21] it doesn't matter what i see it doesn't
[1:33:23] matter what i feel
[1:33:25] what matters is that it's true
[1:33:28] and it will become a living reality
[1:33:31] and brother rich was good enough to
[1:33:34] share his real battle four nights
[1:33:37] of discouragement four nights of
[1:33:38] difficulty four might nights of pain and
[1:33:40] suffering
[1:33:42] but the word was still working mightily
[1:33:44] in him
[1:33:45] and after sticking with the word god
[1:33:48] never failed
[1:33:50] the only way the word can fail is if we
[1:33:52] leave the word
[1:33:53] and give up on it and run away from it
[1:33:56] but if we just stick with him god's
[1:33:58] promised
[1:33:59] he'll prevail and let's bow our heads
[1:34:02] and pray and give god's thanksgiving for
[1:34:04] the word
[1:34:05] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[1:34:08] that you're so mindful of us
[1:34:11] god i know that if this is the word that
[1:34:13] you brought
[1:34:14] brought for us tonight it was because we
[1:34:15] needed it tonight
[1:34:17] lord i believe there's somebody many
[1:34:19] maybe many of us lord
[1:34:20] we need this encouragement lord we need
[1:34:23] to remember
[1:34:24] god that you're the same yesterday today
[1:34:26] forever and that nothing has changed
[1:34:27] with you
[1:34:29] and if we can approach you the same way
[1:34:31] lord we can get the same results
[1:34:33] if we can come humbly with faith if we
[1:34:35] can be repented and surrendered and
[1:34:37] believing
[1:34:38] lord embolden our faith lord then we can
[1:34:41] have the same results that your word has
[1:34:42] always brought
[1:34:43] down through history god i pray that
[1:34:46] there's somebody here that's been
[1:34:48] discouraged that they would be
[1:34:49] encouraged now
[1:34:50] if there's somebody that's been defeated
[1:34:52] lord that they would no longer walk in
[1:34:53] defeat but they would stand
[1:34:55] lord and say the word is working
[1:34:57] mightily in me
[1:34:58] though the symptoms haven't gone yet
[1:35:00] they will go
[1:35:01] though the circumstances hasn't changed
[1:35:03] yet it will change
[1:35:05] because it's in your word and i believe
[1:35:06] it and i've surrendered everything to
[1:35:08] you lord
[1:35:09] and i know that your word will work for
[1:35:11] me
[1:35:12] god i pray that you'd help us lord to
[1:35:14] have a positive confession
[1:35:16] forgive us for our complaining lord
[1:35:18] forgive us for our negative confession
[1:35:20] we want to repent right now and lay that
[1:35:22] before you lord forgive us for any
[1:35:24] compromise that's in our life lord and
[1:35:26] any neglect
[1:35:26] lord we want to lay that before you but
[1:35:28] we want to lord be able to say
[1:35:30] that i've given all to you lord and i
[1:35:32] know that your word will work for me
[1:35:35] god i pray to bring deliverance lord
[1:35:38] there's many needs and
[1:35:39] in a body of believers there's always so
[1:35:41] much as we walk through this life
[1:35:43] we're constantly finding ourselves in
[1:35:45] need but lord you've already provided
[1:35:48] everything we need
[1:35:49] it's already done it's already finished
[1:35:51] the works were done before the
[1:35:53] foundation of the world
[1:35:54] you're just asking us lord to believe
[1:35:56] and step into it lord
[1:35:59] help us to believe and move forward by
[1:36:02] faith
[1:36:03] while we commit ourselves to you we ask
[1:36:06] that you bless our brother rich lord and
[1:36:08] strengthen him god he poured his heart
[1:36:10] out as you give him leadership to and
[1:36:12] i thank you for it lord and i pray you
[1:36:14] would restore his strength and health
[1:36:16] and
[1:36:16] give him encouragement lord and let him
[1:36:18] go home back to his church refreshed and
[1:36:21] charged up
[1:36:22] and that he might have some energy lord
