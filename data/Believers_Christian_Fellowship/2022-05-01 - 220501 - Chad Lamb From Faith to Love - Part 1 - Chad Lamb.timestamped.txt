[16:42] ephesians chapter one
[16:45] we're going to continue on with a
[16:46] thought from sunday sunday we were
[16:49] talking about the stature of a perfect
[16:50] man and uh we're gonna go on uh today
[16:54] and the subject from faith to love we'll
[16:56] get into some of those virtues today i
[16:58] don't think that i'll be able to finish
[17:00] it but if we're not able to finish it
[17:01] we'll just carry on on wednesday
[17:04] so i want to thank brother telus for
[17:06] that song it was timely god bless you
[17:08] for the telus appreciated that
[17:10] also wanted to let you know if you have
[17:12] not heard already that uh brother harold
[17:14] hildebrant from edmonton canada passed
[17:17] away this past week
[17:18] on wednesday evening i got the
[17:20] notification late wednesday that he had
[17:23] passed away
[17:24] and i only had the privilege of just
[17:26] shaking brother harold's hand one time
[17:28] just a few years ago but i never had the
[17:30] privilege of fellowship with him or
[17:31] knowing him but i know his reputation
[17:33] well he's a brother who's been very
[17:35] active in spreading the message he's
[17:37] preached this gospel for a long time
[17:39] he's printed books he's been a
[17:41] missionary traveled all over the world
[17:43] and so i say god rest his gallant soul
[17:45] amen
[17:46] so if you're
[17:48] if you're interested there'll be a
[17:49] memorial service this coming saturday
[17:52] may 7th at 11 a.m which would be
[17:54] edmonton time on the church's website so
[17:57] i just wanted to inform you of that and
[17:59] we just pray that god will bless his
[18:01] family and bless his church as they
[18:03] continue on in the direction he set them
[18:05] in and that's what he would desire for
[18:06] them to do
[18:07] i mean a lot of the old soldiers are
[18:09] passing away
[18:11] but the baton has been passed and this
[18:13] is our time now amen and let's not let
[18:15] all their work and all their labor labor
[18:18] be in vain
[18:19] but let's just take it and keep moving
[18:20] it forward amen
[18:23] god bless you as we're standing let's
[18:24] just read i also want to remind you
[18:26] we've got communion and feet washing
[18:27] this afternoon so we'll be coming back
[18:29] for that
[18:30] let's read in ephesians chapter 1
[18:33] verse 3.
[18:39] blessed be the god and father of our
[18:41] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[18:43] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[18:45] places in christ according as he hath
[18:48] chosen us in him before the foundation
[18:50] of the world that we should be holy and
[18:52] without blame before him in love having
[18:55] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[18:57] children by jesus christ to himself
[19:00] according to the good pleasure of his
[19:01] will to the praise of the glory of his
[19:04] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[19:08] in the beloved amen god bless you as
[19:10] you're seated i mean the lord bless us
[19:12] as we look into his word
[19:16] i love this opening scripture we read
[19:19] this on
[19:21] wednesday
[19:23] but it said
[19:24] according has chosen us in him before
[19:26] the foundation of the world
[19:28] so who chose who
[19:30] i love going to these scriptures we've
[19:31] been through him before but every time
[19:33] they're so exciting he chose us when did
[19:35] he choose us before the foundation of
[19:37] the world
[19:38] so so you know there's a security that
[19:41] comes with revelation
[19:43] and the revelation
[19:45] shows us that god had a purpose and a
[19:48] plan for us from before the foundation
[19:49] of the world he chose us in him
[19:53] before the foundation of the world that
[19:54] we should be holy and without blame
[19:56] before him in love he chose us in him
[20:00] because christ would come and be the
[20:01] sacrifice the propitiation for our sins
[20:04] to to wash away our sins to purify us so
[20:07] he chose us in him that we should be
[20:09] holy and without blame before him in
[20:11] love
[20:12] amen
[20:13] when we really look at this the whole
[20:15] plan is god's not ours the whole purpose
[20:17] of god's not ours the idea is his not
[20:20] ours amen and so we're always uh we're
[20:24] always uh
[20:25] looking at two perspectives you know
[20:27] what we're doing and what god's doing
[20:29] but sometimes we just have to back up a
[20:31] little bit further and go amen when you
[20:33] were a thought still in his mind amen
[20:35] before you were an expressed image on
[20:37] this earth before you had a chance to
[20:39] actually do anything in this form you're
[20:42] in now doing wrong or doing right or
[20:44] making choices in this form amen before
[20:46] all of that he already chose you and him
[20:49] so that you would be blameless before
[20:50] him in love
[20:53] so praise god
[20:55] without that there's no hope
[20:57] without him doing that there's no chance
[20:59] but with him already choosing amen
[21:02] there's nothing that can stop it from
[21:03] coming to pass
[21:05] so then it says in verse 5 and having
[21:07] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[21:09] children by jesus christ to himself
[21:11] according to the good pleasure of his
[21:13] will so we were talking wednesday about
[21:16] adoption from birth to adoption and and
[21:19] that's what brother branham was talking
[21:20] about in the stature of a perfect man
[21:22] that we're birthed amen and as we're
[21:24] birthed that's when we recognize that we
[21:26] are a son or daughter of god and we are
[21:28] birthed into the kingdom of god and and
[21:30] god wants to grow us from there into
[21:32] maturity amen every baby that's born on
[21:35] this earth in a natural way was born to
[21:38] grow
[21:39] amen no matter how much we would love
[21:41] for them to stay tiny you know i wish
[21:43] you would just stay just like this amen
[21:46] that's not the purpose of the birth amen
[21:48] everything that's born is born to grow
[21:51] and come to maturity amen and come to
[21:53] the form of the thing that birthed it
[21:57] everything a dog a cat a human
[21:59] everything that's birthed in this world
[22:01] amen plants and all their birth they
[22:04] meant to grow into the image of the
[22:05] thing that birthed it
[22:07] so what do you think our purpose is on
[22:09] this earth amen we were predestinated
[22:11] unto the adoption of children in jesus
[22:13] christ adoption is the placing of a son
[22:16] as the sun grows into maturity when they
[22:18] hit a certain level of maturity their
[22:20] place positionally placed in the kingdom
[22:22] work amen given responsibility
[22:25] reflecting back the character of the
[22:27] father and their given responsibility to
[22:29] work in the kingdom so now we've been
[22:32] predestinated unto adoption so it's not
[22:35] just all my efforts trying to come to
[22:38] maturity i was born to mature
[22:41] i was born to grow i was birthed in the
[22:44] kingdom to take my position as an
[22:46] adopted son that was the purpose because
[22:48] it says according to the good pleasure
[22:51] of his will
[22:53] so in here it doesn't speak anything
[22:54] about your will so far we've not talked
[22:57] about you at all except you're the
[22:59] object that his will is being expressed
[23:01] in
[23:02] but it wasn't what you thought it wasn't
[23:04] what you purposed it wasn't what you
[23:05] decided so so far in the book of
[23:07] ephesians really you're out of the
[23:09] picture you're just the vessel that he's
[23:11] going to do he chose that he's had a
[23:13] desire for that he's going to do a work
[23:16] in according to his good pleasure
[23:18] [Music]
[23:19] and i say i'm so thankful it's that way
[23:21] because i know me and i know what i was
[23:23] born with and i know my genetic makeup
[23:25] and if it wasn't for these scriptures
[23:27] and this being a true reality there is
[23:29] absolutely no way that i could ever come
[23:32] to maturity and serve god in any
[23:33] capacity
[23:35] but it's not my will it's his
[23:39] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[23:41] wherein he hath made us
[23:43] accepted
[23:45] in the beloved
[23:47] listen that scripture right there if
[23:50] that doesn't make your heart swell
[23:53] he made us accept it in the beloved i
[23:56] did not have to first become acceptable
[24:00] to be accepted in the beloved
[24:02] he
[24:03] made me without my effort he made me
[24:07] accept it in the beloved
[24:09] oh praise god there was it wasn't me
[24:12] working my way into a place where
[24:14] finally he would accept me finally he
[24:15] would declare his love for me finally i
[24:18] got good enough that he would accept me
[24:19] as his beloved no before all of that i
[24:22] was accepted
[24:24] in the beloved
[24:26] praise god
[24:27] amen we've got a powerpoint we're going
[24:28] to go through here for a little bit i've
[24:30] got quite a few slides but like i said i
[24:32] probably won't finish them but i i
[24:34] wanted to do this to keep us organized
[24:36] and get go through this together
[24:39] so in the quote the statue of a perfect
[24:41] man
[24:42] and this morning we want to speak on the
[24:44] subject or teach rather if we can
[24:46] building the living tabernacle building
[24:48] the living tabernacle of the living
[24:50] god's dwelling place the perfect man the
[24:53] living tabernacle of the living god
[24:55] where he dwells so if you want to know
[24:57] what the subject statue of a perfect man
[24:59] is he's telling you right here in
[25:01] paragraph seven right from the beginning
[25:02] what i'm going to teach about now is the
[25:05] perfect man perfect we defined on
[25:09] wednesday perfect means mature or
[25:11] complete or whole it doesn't mean with
[25:13] never an error
[25:15] never a fault never a flaw perfect means
[25:17] you've come to completeness or wholeness
[25:19] amen so you come to maturity as a man or
[25:22] as a son and daughter of god the perfect
[25:24] man the living tabernacle of the living
[25:27] god where he dwells so what's the whole
[25:30] point of this is to be birthed to grow
[25:33] up to be a vessel that god dwells in and
[25:36] manifest himself in this earth in that's
[25:39] the whole point that's what he's talking
[25:40] about that's the whole point of
[25:42] everything he's going to say is god
[25:44] birthed you to grow you so that he can
[25:46] fill you and he can live his life
[25:48] through you and you're a living example
[25:50] a living tabernacle of the living god
[25:53] living inside of you his life in your
[25:56] flesh that's the whole point
[25:59] amen
[26:00] praise god god bless you isabella
[26:03] it's good to have you here
[26:05] amen back from germany so soon amen
[26:07] we're so happy
[26:09] god bless him
[26:10] amen
[26:12] in blasphemous names he goes on to say
[26:14] now when jesus had been obedient jesus
[26:16] to god god placed him positionally this
[26:19] is him we talked about this on wednesday
[26:21] but but brother bantam go uses the
[26:23] example of jesus christ and i want to
[26:25] take a look at this because jesus
[26:27] becomes the example because as he he
[26:29] grows amen he comes to this uh the
[26:31] jordan river at the appointed time and
[26:34] he comes and the holy ghost descends
[26:36] upon him and bodily form like a dove and
[26:38] brother branham said that pillar of fire
[26:40] came down and john saw it and that that
[26:43] that baptism in jordan brought the holy
[26:46] ghost upon him and led him in the
[26:48] wilderness to be tested and tried and
[26:50] brother bam tells us that's that's what
[26:52] happens when we're birthed by the
[26:53] baptism holy ghost then we go into our
[26:55] testings and trials amen under tutors
[26:58] and school masters to be taught to learn
[27:00] lessons to grow into maturity remember
[27:03] brother branham says when when god when
[27:05] jesus had been obedient jesus to god god
[27:08] placed him positionally this is him and
[27:11] he's speaking of mount transfiguration
[27:14] he says now when the number
[27:16] when a member is born by the holy ghost
[27:18] into the family of god and has proven to
[27:20] have these virtues in him that god can
[27:22] see virtue knowledge temperance patience
[27:25] brotherly kindness and godliness in him
[27:27] then god seals him or places him and
[27:30] there that's when you see the sons and
[27:32] daughters of god
[27:34] so we look at we looked at this in
[27:36] matthew chapter 3 verse 16. this is
[27:39] jesus at the jordan river it says in
[27:41] jesus when he was baptized went up
[27:42] straightway out of the water and lo the
[27:44] heavens were open unto him and he saw
[27:46] the spirit of god descending like a dove
[27:48] and lighting upon him
[27:49] and the lo the voice from heaven saying
[27:51] this is my beloved son in whom i am well
[27:54] pleased so so god begins this is the
[27:58] birthing of the ministry of jesus christ
[28:00] his birth right here in the water and at
[28:02] that place he already declares this is
[28:04] my son in whom i'm well pleased
[28:07] so at the birth of the ministry of jesus
[28:09] christ there's a declaration that goes
[28:11] forth this is him this is my son in whom
[28:14] i'm well pleased i'm in this vessel
[28:17] and then we come to matthew 17 on mount
[28:19] transfiguration it says well he yet
[28:21] spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed
[28:23] them and behold a voice out of the cloud
[28:25] which said this is my beloved son in
[28:27] whom i am well pleased hear ye him
[28:30] and so now he repeats the phrase this is
[28:33] my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased
[28:35] and now hear ye him now he's speaking
[28:38] for me amen
[28:40] now he's fully in my place and he is
[28:43] speaking for me amen and brother branham
[28:45] is showing typing that with us coming
[28:48] into adoption he shows what happened in
[28:50] jesus christ i show this because uh we
[28:53] talked about before that that there's
[28:55] been some confusion many times around
[28:57] the message because of the messy statue
[28:59] of a perfect man and more so by the
[29:01] message blasphemius names because
[29:03] brother bam talks about being sealed
[29:05] being capped being baptized with the
[29:07] holy ghost when all of these virtues are
[29:09] in you then the cat comes down and seals
[29:11] you and uses all this language amen but
[29:13] i'm going to show several quotes from
[29:15] there to show that brother banham has
[29:16] never changed his doctrine brother venom
[29:18] always taught that the true baptism of
[29:20] the holy ghost and the new birth are one
[29:22] and the same
[29:23] he goes through in the church age book
[29:25] amen that's why i think the church age
[29:26] book is so instrumental to us what a
[29:28] gift that god gave to us amen because
[29:31] there's so many questions that the
[29:32] church age book answers
[29:34] so many things that he set straight
[29:36] because brother branham he will change
[29:39] terminology amen when he's trying to
[29:41] describe something and as he describes
[29:43] it this is a man who says i wish i could
[29:45] explain it the way i received it he said
[29:47] i don't have language enough amen we
[29:49] know he was limited in his education but
[29:51] he was not limited in his revelation
[29:54] so he understood amen but he had to
[29:57] express it in a way that he could
[29:59] express it and we even see brother ben
[30:02] change his terminology and the
[30:04] terminology will flex with who he's
[30:05] speaking to trying to get the people to
[30:07] understand what the revelation he's
[30:09] trying to get across
[30:11] but if you watch the message from
[30:13] beginning to end brother branham is not
[30:15] changing his doctrine amen what he
[30:17] teaches remains true all the way through
[30:19] even when he changes
[30:21] his terminology we cannot change our
[30:24] doctrine as brother ram changes his
[30:25] terminology because the next message you
[30:27] come to he could change the terminology
[30:29] back
[30:31] so the point is what is he teaching us
[30:34] what is the lesson what does he want us
[30:37] to know amen that's the point
[30:40] amen i think sometimes uh we can we can
[30:43] get so fixated on the brushstrokes of
[30:46] the painting
[30:48] that we don't even know what the picture
[30:50] is
[30:51] amen my brother ben said before he says
[30:54] when you're going to put the the puzzle
[30:55] together you've got to see the picture
[30:57] first to put the puzzle together and
[30:59] sometimes i think we can be fixated on a
[31:01] couple puzzle pieces and it's like they
[31:03] go together
[31:04] you know i think they go together this
[31:07] one's rounded this way and it's got a
[31:08] curve up this way and and it doesn't you
[31:10] know how it doesn't really feel
[31:12] right
[31:13] does anybody work the puzzle
[31:15] but you convince yourself it's right
[31:20] but then later as the picture emerges
[31:23] you realize no that doesn't fit there
[31:25] that doesn't it pop it out and there's
[31:26] another place it fits just exactly but
[31:29] brother bam showed us in order to get
[31:30] this puzzle together you've got to see
[31:32] the picture that's on the outside of the
[31:33] box and if you look at the messages the
[31:35] whole brother venom has painted the
[31:37] picture
[31:38] and now when we go look at all the brush
[31:40] strokes and all the pieces they fit the
[31:42] picture
[31:44] so here in the beginning
[31:48] jesus
[31:49] had the holy ghost
[31:51] and in the end it was the holy ghost
[31:54] when was he a son
[31:55] and what part was he a son when was god
[31:58] using him
[31:59] all the way through
[32:00] [Music]
[32:01] in second peter this is where we get
[32:03] into the virtues where brother branham
[32:05] draws out the virtues in second peter
[32:06] chapter one verse five it says whereby
[32:09] are given unto us exceeding great and
[32:10] precious promises that by these you
[32:13] might be partakers of the divine nature
[32:15] having escaped the corruption that is in
[32:17] the world through lust and beside this
[32:20] giving all diligence add to your faith
[32:22] virtue and divert you knowledge
[32:24] into knowledge temperance and to
[32:26] temperance patience into patient's
[32:28] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[32:30] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[32:32] charity so this is where brother branham
[32:35] takes these virtues for when he's
[32:37] preaching the statue of a perfect man
[32:39] but i'd like to note that it says we are
[32:42] given
[32:43] given unto us exceeding in great
[32:45] precious promises exceeding great and
[32:47] precious promises so these promises are
[32:50] given to us
[32:52] they're not earned they're given
[32:55] that by these by the promises you might
[32:57] be partakers of the divine nature
[33:00] so there is a divine nature a nature of
[33:02] the divine amen and that's what these
[33:05] these virtues all uh paint to point to
[33:07] they're all expressions of the divine
[33:09] nature and having escaped the corruption
[33:12] that is in the world through lust
[33:14] now in the statute of a perfect man he
[33:16] says after you've done come from here to
[33:18] here to here to here to here he's
[33:20] working his way up the pyramid on his
[33:22] chalkboard now you're coming into the
[33:24] full stature now the son of god but you
[33:26] got to have this plus this and you can't
[33:29] even start until you get this
[33:31] i wish we had that i wish we had a video
[33:34] of that
[33:35] but you can't even start till you get to
[33:36] this and i believe he's pointing down to
[33:38] the foundation faith
[33:40] now remember the black bird with peacock
[33:42] feathers don't forget him
[33:44] don't try to add it till you're actually
[33:46] born again
[33:48] so you can never be born again at the
[33:50] top
[33:51] you're born again at the bottom
[33:54] amen you come to the realization you're
[33:56] a son and if you're a son then you're
[33:58] predestinated to adoption then then
[34:00] you're predestinated to be conformed
[34:02] into the image of the sun so you have to
[34:04] grow there's no option but growth you
[34:05] can't stay a newborn baby in christ
[34:07] forever you've got to grow
[34:10] so don't try to add that until you're
[34:11] actually born again because it won't
[34:13] work you can't make it work it'll come
[34:15] to this or this here it'll crumble
[34:17] somewhere
[34:18] but when you get down here a genuine
[34:21] born-again dove then you don't add
[34:24] nothing it adds to you
[34:27] that is such an important statement
[34:30] because if we look at the statute of a
[34:32] perfect man as a works program
[34:35] we're going to miss the whole point it's
[34:37] a growth amen it's a pattern of growth
[34:40] it's a maturity amen amen your children
[34:43] they don't have to work their way into
[34:45] growth all they have to do is eat and
[34:47] they grow
[34:50] amen
[34:51] so you don't add nothing it adds to you
[34:54] why you already have the seed gene of
[34:57] god on the inside amen the holy ghost is
[35:00] brooding over that seed bringing it into
[35:02] the image of the one who birthed it
[35:05] and you don't add nothing it adds to you
[35:07] see comes on up all right coming into
[35:09] perfection now
[35:11] now there are a lot of times
[35:13] where many of us
[35:15] pentecostals has made a mistake i think
[35:17] well the holy ghost has poured out on me
[35:19] glory to god that's all i have to have
[35:22] no sir you're just then getting started
[35:26] so the baptism of the holy ghost and the
[35:28] new birth is just the beginning
[35:31] it's not then it's your test and your
[35:33] trial just like we find over in the old
[35:36] testament testing trying and then
[35:37] placing a son
[35:39] adoption placing the son after he's
[35:41] already a son been born into the family
[35:44] he's the son then he would be tested and
[35:47] tried and raised up by tutors and see
[35:50] how he comes out and then he's placed
[35:52] positionally equal almost to his father
[35:56] so you can see
[35:57] the goal
[35:59] this there's another quote here in
[36:00] statute of perfect man i'd like to read
[36:01] it says and look here
[36:03] having escaped the corruption that is in
[36:05] the world through lust escaped it see
[36:08] you see who it's to
[36:10] so when you go back to
[36:12] peter when he's speaking of the virtues
[36:14] there in chapter one it's to those who
[36:16] have escaped the world amen so it says
[36:19] those who have escaped the corruption
[36:21] that is in the world through lust
[36:23] escaped it see who it's to it's to the
[36:26] church them who are in christ amen so
[36:28] this divine nature is open to those who
[36:31] have already escaped the world amen
[36:33] those who are already born again those
[36:35] who are already in christ
[36:38] that's who this is written to
[36:41] has been exalted above these things not
[36:43] he exalted himself but christ brought
[36:45] him up
[36:46] and he goes to share this testimony from
[36:48] a sister she said i want to make this
[36:50] testimony for the glory of god she said
[36:53] now i ain't what i ought to be
[36:55] and she said i ain't what i want to be
[36:58] one thing sure i ain't what i used to be
[37:02] she said i had come from somewhere she
[37:04] had been brought up
[37:06] that's how we know we've passed from
[37:08] death unto life we look back to the pit
[37:10] where we were hewed from we're not what
[37:12] we want to be we're not what even what
[37:15] we're not even what we ought to be but
[37:17] one thing we're thankful for we're not
[37:19] what we used to be that's right we're on
[37:21] the road amen and having escaped the
[37:23] corruption of the world having escaped
[37:25] that the lust and corruption of the
[37:27] world you're above that now now that's
[37:30] the type of person that he's talking to
[37:32] the person that has escaped these things
[37:34] see the corruption of the world so you
[37:36] can say amen
[37:38] i'm not what i used to be
[37:41] i'm not even what i want to be or ought
[37:42] to be but praise god i'm not what i used
[37:45] to be i'm not what i was something
[37:47] changed something's happened and i'm on
[37:49] my road you may say well you're not a
[37:52] you're not a very good christian you're
[37:53] not a very good image of jesus christ
[37:55] and i can say that may be absolutely
[37:57] every bit the truth but i know i'm not
[37:59] what i used to be i've been changed
[38:01] something changed in my life i've been
[38:02] born again and i may still act like a
[38:04] child in some ways and must need to grow
[38:06] up but praise god i know who i am and i
[38:09] know what i'm growing to
[38:13] this message amen is not to discourage
[38:16] us this message is to encourage us
[38:17] because we've been predestinated unto
[38:19] adoption
[38:21] let's turn together to romans chapter 8.
[38:33] i think sometimes it's such a
[38:35] it's such a pity and a shame that you
[38:37] see people sometimes so discouraged
[38:40] trying to live a christian life
[38:43] and they the there's a legalistic
[38:45] mentality sometimes that is entered in
[38:48] and people are so discouraged and so
[38:50] beat down amen
[38:52] they seemingly never have the victory
[38:54] because they always look at flaws in
[38:56] their life and they look at the man in
[38:57] the mirror and they get so utterly
[38:59] discouraged and begin to even doubt
[39:01] their salvation
[39:04] but but when you look at the what paul
[39:06] wrote and you look at what brother
[39:08] branham preached amen it's a totally
[39:10] different viewpoint
[39:12] hey verse let's look at romans chapter 8
[39:14] verse 28
[39:19] and we know that all things work
[39:22] together for good to them that love god
[39:24] to them who are the cold according to
[39:27] his purpose
[39:29] whose purpose
[39:30] his purpose
[39:34] for whom he did for no
[39:36] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[39:39] to the image of his son
[39:42] you have been predestinated to be
[39:45] conformed into the image of jesus christ
[39:48] god decided that before the foundation
[39:51] of the world god chose you in him before
[39:54] the foundation of the world god foreknew
[39:56] you and predestinated you to be
[39:58] conformed into the image of his son it's
[40:00] not your idea it's god's idea
[40:04] it conformed to the image of his son
[40:07] that he might be the firstborn among
[40:10] many brethren moreover whom he did
[40:11] predestinate them he also called whom he
[40:14] called then he also justified whom he
[40:16] justified then he also glorified
[40:21] has he called you
[40:22] do you know he's called you
[40:24] then he's called you unto adoption
[40:27] he's predestinated you to be conformed
[40:29] to the image of his son he's called you
[40:31] amen he's justified you just as if
[40:33] you've never done it and he's already
[40:35] glorified you in god's mind it's a
[40:37] finished work it's a done deal we're
[40:39] just now working out his plan we're now
[40:42] manifesting what was in god's mind
[40:44] coming into that place of adoption amen
[40:47] it's not something that we have to
[40:49] accomplish on our own it's something
[40:51] that's already been accomplished in the
[40:52] mind of god and what about those
[40:54] thoughts they're literal aren't they
[40:57] they're literal they're real it's
[40:59] already determined it has already
[41:01] happened this is now the reflection of
[41:04] that and this is growing into what he's
[41:06] already determined it to grow into amen
[41:09] so now let's take all the scare and all
[41:11] the pressure away and now let's just let
[41:14] a dove be a dove amen and let everything
[41:16] that's on the inside come out amen
[41:19] let's let a sheep begin to bear wool
[41:21] amen the sheep doesn't have brother
[41:22] memphis says the sheep doesn't have to
[41:23] concentrate to bear wool
[41:25] then the trihal what it has to do is it
[41:28] has to eat amen and it needs a shepherd
[41:30] amen to keep it safe and guide it into
[41:32] the good pastors and beside the cool
[41:34] water and as it eats and as it
[41:36] drinks and as it rests
[41:40] what will slow down production in any
[41:43] farm is a tension or sickness or
[41:45] disturbances but as that little sheep
[41:47] can come to rest under the care of the
[41:49] shepherd amen and it gets the good water
[41:52] and it gets the the good food amen it
[41:55] automatically bears wool amen wool just
[41:58] comes amen and the whole brother man
[42:00] said the whole christian walk is based
[42:02] on rest
[42:06] now i say that and i feel like i need to
[42:08] balance that it's not based on laziness
[42:11] amen it's not rest like lemonade in a
[42:14] lounge chair on the porch waiting for
[42:16] god god's going to make me perfect
[42:18] praise god
[42:21] i can watch the things i've always
[42:22] watched and talk about the things i've
[42:24] already talked about and god it's not
[42:26] spiritual laziness it's a spiritual rest
[42:28] amen
[42:30] amen where we still labor in the word of
[42:32] god where we still work amen we still
[42:34] feed we still drink we still grow amen
[42:37] but but it's not it's not our idea it's
[42:40] his idea so he provided the nutrients he
[42:42] provided the vitamins amen he provided
[42:45] the seed gene
[42:48] then he's the one who brought the light
[42:50] to quicken it and he's the one who keeps
[42:52] shining light for it to grow he's the
[42:53] one who waters it with his word he's
[42:55] provided everything to bring us to
[42:58] maturity
[42:59] he put the seed in you that would start
[43:01] the growth he quickened it to life at a
[43:03] certain time now he provides all the
[43:05] nutrients all the vitamins the right
[43:07] atmosphere the right sunlight he's
[43:09] giving it all for growth all we have to
[43:11] do is stay in the presence of the sun
[43:13] and quit running away from the shepherd
[43:14] and chasing after things eating weeds he
[43:17] told us not to eat if we just follow the
[43:19] shepherd and stay where he told us to go
[43:21] and eat what he told us to eat and trust
[43:23] in him and rest in his leadership will
[43:25] grow
[43:27] so it's never spiritual laziness
[43:30] but it is spiritual rest
[43:34] he goes on the statue of a perfect man
[43:36] to say and let me stop here a minute the
[43:38] sheep doesn't manufacture
[43:40] wool he has wool because he is a sheep
[43:45] you're going to grow into adoption
[43:46] because you're a son
[43:50] a lot of people try to say well i'll try
[43:52] to get good i'll try to do this don't
[43:55] manufacture nothing
[43:57] you can't do it a sheep doesn't isn't
[44:00] asked is an expected manufacturer well
[44:01] it bears wool and it does because it's a
[44:04] sheep and when you're a christian you
[44:06] just bear the fruit of the spirit you
[44:08] don't manufacture it
[44:10] you don't try to make it up don't make
[44:12] yourself something that you're not you
[44:13] just become what you're supposed to be
[44:15] and then it takes care of itself have
[44:17] you heard people say well i'll tell you
[44:19] i've joined church i really ought to
[44:21] quit this lying
[44:23] you're trying to manufacture something
[44:25] again
[44:27] now you can't do it so there's no need
[44:28] of trying to no more than a mule can
[44:31] make himself have wool he can't do it or
[44:33] a vulture trying to eat with a dove and
[44:35] a vulture trying to be a dove could you
[44:37] imagine a buzzard out there say you know
[44:39] i'm a dove and put a few feathers in him
[44:41] and say see i look like he'd just be all
[44:44] out of shape
[44:46] that's a man who professes to be
[44:47] something when he's not see you can't do
[44:49] it you can't say now look i'm supposed
[44:51] to have virtue so all have virtue i'm
[44:54] supposed to live godliness so i'll just
[44:56] have it
[44:57] why you're you're only trying to place
[44:59] feathers
[45:00] though they're in your reach but you
[45:02] can't put the feathers in the wrong bird
[45:04] it just won't work and it only shows
[45:06] that a hypocrite what a hypocrite that
[45:08] bird is could you imagine an old buzzer
[45:10] trying to have a couple of dove feathers
[45:12] saying look here see i'm a dove why we
[45:14] all know he's a buzzard that's all we
[45:16] can tell that he's a buzzard well no
[45:18] that's the way it is trying to
[45:20] manufacture christianity you can't do it
[45:23] the first thing you have to do is be
[45:25] born again you have to you got to be
[45:28] changed
[45:29] the very first thing you have to come to
[45:31] is a birth by the baptism of the holy
[45:33] ghost
[45:34] you've got to be changed something
[45:36] inside has to change something has to
[45:38] quicken something has to come alive
[45:40] inside of you there must the first thing
[45:42] you've got to do is be born
[45:45] if you want to grow into maturity you
[45:47] have to be born first
[45:50] and once you're born you're born to grow
[45:55] the first thing you have to do is be
[45:56] born again you've got to be changed and
[45:58] when you're changed you become a new
[46:00] creation now you're getting right see
[46:02] now you don't have to worry about the
[46:04] feathers it'll take care of itself when
[46:07] you're born again
[46:09] all you have to do then
[46:11] is then grow
[46:14] praise god
[46:17] ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 and he gave
[46:20] some apostles some prophets some
[46:22] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[46:24] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[46:26] working of the ministry for the edifying
[46:28] of the body of christ till we all come
[46:31] into the unity of faith and of the
[46:32] knowledge of the son of god unto a
[46:35] perfect man this is the word perfect we
[46:37] took last time and showed that meant
[46:38] complete or whole or mature
[46:41] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[46:43] the stature of the fullness of christ
[46:46] that's the goal that's when we come to a
[46:48] perfect man we're coming to the stature
[46:51] of the fullness of christ we're going to
[46:53] have the divine nature
[46:56] that we henceforth be no more children
[46:58] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[47:00] every wind of doctrine by the slight of
[47:02] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[47:04] lie in way to deceive but speaking the
[47:06] truth and love may grow up into him in
[47:09] all things which is the head even christ
[47:12] so
[47:13] even in ephesians 4 here it's telling us
[47:16] that god sent the ministry along amen to
[47:19] to give the sheep food out amen
[47:22] to so that we could all it's for the
[47:24] perfecting of the saints for the growing
[47:26] of the saints for the work of the
[47:28] ministry to edify the body of christ
[47:30] build up this great body of christ until
[47:33] we come into the unity of faith until we
[47:35] come into a perfect man the stature of
[47:37] the fullness of christ that's been the
[47:39] goal that's the goal of preaching
[47:42] that's the goal of ministry if the
[47:44] ministry is doing something other than
[47:46] this the ministry has missed its point
[47:48] because this wasn't meant to build
[47:50] ministries or to build empires to build
[47:52] great men amen the ministry came to
[47:54] build the body of christ and to build
[47:56] individuals into perfection
[47:59] and now we're no more children
[48:02] god wants us to grow up
[48:06] he does not want us to remain children
[48:08] god wants us to grow up god has been
[48:10] waiting for his bride to grow up he
[48:11] wants brother vance said he's coming
[48:13] back for a fully mature bride not a
[48:15] little girl
[48:16] he wants a bride of marriage age of
[48:18] marriage maturity amen that's what he's
[48:20] come to unite to amen so this is the age
[48:23] of adoption this is the age of full
[48:25] maturity this is when the bride comes
[48:27] into full marriage maturity and as
[48:29] individuals as we grow we come into that
[48:32] invisible union one by one because this
[48:34] is the age of adoption this is the age
[48:36] of maturity
[48:38] amen
[48:41] he was on to say
[48:42] then the word coming from here
[48:44] manifests itself through each one of
[48:46] these beings he's talking about the
[48:48] stages
[48:49] and makes the complete being a
[48:51] tabernacle of the living god a walking
[48:53] living example of christianity what
[48:55] christ was these people are because this
[48:58] life is in here
[48:59] they are in christ and their life is
[49:01] dead and hid in christ through god and
[49:03] sealed in there by the holy ghost first
[49:05] corinthians 12 that's right you reckon
[49:07] yourself dead then you're born of faith
[49:10] then virtue of these other things is
[49:12] added to to you till you're a perfect
[49:15] living image of god
[49:17] so then you're born by faith so the
[49:19] foundation becomes faith
[49:22] let's look at ephesians chapter 2.
[49:25] now therefore
[49:27] you are no more strangers
[49:29] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[49:32] the saints into the household of god
[49:34] and are built upon the foundation of the
[49:36] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[49:38] himself being the chief cornerstone
[49:41] in whom all the building fitly framed
[49:43] together groweth into a holy temple in
[49:45] the lord in whom ye also are builded
[49:48] together for a habitation of god through
[49:50] the spirit
[49:53] god wants a house
[49:57] amen
[49:58] what what tabernacle what temple will
[50:01] you build him
[50:02] but a body has not prepared
[50:05] when god wanted a place to dwell it
[50:07] wasn't solomon's temple it wasn't the
[50:10] tabernacle of david it wasn't the
[50:11] tabernacle and wilderness it wasn't the
[50:13] one that was rebuilt by zerubbabel but
[50:15] what god always wanted to do was live in
[50:17] flesh that was his goal from the
[50:19] beginning and he accomplished that in
[50:21] jesus christ but that wasn't the end
[50:23] amen
[50:25] that wasn't the end that was only the
[50:27] beginning of what god wanted to do
[50:30] and now god wants to live in flesh in a
[50:33] mini-membered body of his bride and he's
[50:36] been accomplishing that over seven
[50:37] church ages and now we've come to the
[50:39] capping time the completion of that amen
[50:41] that bride has come to full maturity
[50:43] growing over seven church ages and what
[50:46] does he want to do he wants to live in
[50:48] her she is the tabernacle that he wants
[50:51] to dwell in
[50:52] so he's had to bring us to maturity
[50:56] if we look here at the pyramid
[50:58] we see we've drawn the pyramid franco
[51:00] helped me with this powerpoint and he
[51:02] helped me with many of these graphics
[51:03] and we've got the seven colors of the
[51:05] rainbow and and we got the capstone so
[51:08] we got seven stages and we got the
[51:10] capping amen and the cap i we i put it
[51:13] in white like light because uh we've
[51:15] been taught we we've been taught by
[51:17] brother branham we've been taught for
[51:18] years by brother lonnie that white light
[51:21] contains all of these colors
[51:24] so all of these virtues are in god
[51:27] it's the divine nature
[51:29] all of these virtues were expressed in
[51:31] jesus christ because he he had the life
[51:34] of god he had the divine nature he was
[51:36] god fully expressed in man
[51:39] and so all of these virtues that we're
[51:41] talking about come from god
[51:44] he is the source
[51:46] amen and it all comes from him so when
[51:48] you get to the top when you get to the
[51:51] very capping the cap is a complete
[51:53] pyramid
[51:54] you see that so the capstone is a
[51:56] complete pyramid it's perfect
[51:59] it's absolutely perfect nothing needs to
[52:02] be added to it but when you look down at
[52:04] the pyramid the body amen it's not a
[52:06] perfect pyramid
[52:08] because without the capping it's not
[52:11] perfect
[52:13] but when the capstone comes the perfect
[52:15] comes to the body it becomes perfect
[52:18] amen
[52:19] it becomes the image
[52:21] it's growing into the image of the very
[52:23] thing that birthed it
[52:25] so what birthed the church
[52:27] it was god
[52:28] birthed the church what's the church
[52:30] growing into into the image of god in a
[52:32] female form
[52:35] so
[52:36] brother branham begins to describe
[52:38] the growth amend the growth of the
[52:40] church from infant all the way up
[52:43] through seven church ages
[52:45] any and he begins to to show that god's
[52:48] been building his bride over seven
[52:50] churches he had a plan from the
[52:51] beginning he's working his plan he's
[52:53] bringing her to full maturity
[52:56] but he says through the virtues he's
[52:58] building the individual the same way he
[53:00] built the church
[53:02] so we see in this picture of a prism
[53:05] which this one i like because it looks
[53:06] like a a pyramid it looks like the
[53:09] capstone amen the light coming through
[53:12] this amen shows that the light has seven
[53:16] virtues seven characteristics seven
[53:19] parts of the divine nature but when you
[53:21] put it all back together it comes back
[53:23] to being god amen so what what what is
[53:27] these divine natures what are you
[53:28] growing into amen when you add to this
[53:31] to this to this to this and you have it
[53:33] all amen what are you coming to you're
[53:35] coming to be like god you're coming in
[53:37] the nature of god you are going to be an
[53:39] earthly tabernacle of the living god
[53:42] reflecting to the world the divine
[53:44] nature of jesus christ
[53:46] that's the point one builds on another
[53:49] on another on another to bring us back
[53:51] into the image of god to bring us back
[53:54] into an expressed image of jesus christ
[53:57] that's the point
[54:00] amen
[54:02] brother brahman said the way he makes
[54:03] his bride
[54:05] is the way he makes his individual
[54:09] and he says it's been the holy ghost in
[54:11] this age that age that age that that
[54:14] that on up the top the holy spirit
[54:19] so
[54:20] where was the holy ghost
[54:22] was it at the beginning
[54:24] or was it at the end
[54:26] i say it was at the beginning
[54:29] the holy ghost birthed it the holy ghost
[54:30] captured amen alpha and omega the
[54:32] principle runs all the way through the
[54:34] bible but brother branham said it was
[54:35] the holy ghost that birthday it was the
[54:37] holy ghost that grew it
[54:39] and it's the holy ghost that captures
[54:42] it's the holy ghost all the way through
[54:45] amen so we can we can choose to be
[54:48] confused or we can just say it's been
[54:50] the holy ghost all the way through we're
[54:52] birthed by the baptism of the holy ghost
[54:54] we're grown by the baptism of the holy
[54:56] ghost growing us all the way into the
[54:58] full expressed image of christ what is
[55:00] it it's the holy ghost
[55:02] it was the holy ghost in this age in
[55:05] that age it's been the holy ghost in
[55:07] your life all the way through
[55:09] you're not trying to get to the holy
[55:11] ghost it was the holy ghost growing you
[55:13] back into himself
[55:16] it says
[55:18] blasphemies name he said but you cannot
[55:19] join the church
[55:21] of the living god you're born into it
[55:24] by the baptism of the holy ghost so how
[55:26] are you born by the baptism of the holy
[55:28] ghost and when you're baptized with the
[55:30] holy ghost these virtues are sealed in
[55:32] you by the holy ghost and therefore he
[55:34] that's born of god does not commit sin
[55:37] cannot there you are
[55:39] so
[55:41] many times when i begin to
[55:44] draw out the statue of a perfect man for
[55:46] people or or when i'm thinking about it
[55:48] myself we start from the bottom faith
[55:50] and work our way up but this morning i'd
[55:53] like to start from the top
[55:55] but i don't want to start from the top
[55:56] and work my way down i want to start
[55:57] from the top because the top is the goal
[56:00] the top is the source the top is the
[56:02] beginning and the top is the end
[56:05] it's god it's the divine nature
[56:08] and this is the this is a quote that i'd
[56:09] like to take that idea from
[56:11] so now in building the virtue building
[56:14] this monument building this stature it
[56:16] starts off with the foundation stone
[56:18] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[56:20] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[56:23] now what does it do then they're waiting
[56:25] for the headstone which is love for god
[56:27] is love and he controls he is the
[56:29] strength of every one of these things
[56:31] that's right
[56:33] right in here right in here you see i
[56:35] got in between all these works in here
[56:37] he's showing again on the blackboard and
[56:39] here these little waves come what is
[56:41] that the holy ghost comes down through
[56:43] christ see the holy spirit the holy
[56:45] spirit is above all of this welding this
[56:48] together
[56:50] building a what a perfect church for the
[56:52] capstone to cap it off
[56:54] so so brother brennan said
[56:57] the holy ghost is above all of this
[57:00] welding it all together what's he doing
[57:02] it was the baptism of the holy ghost
[57:04] that birth you and you come to birth and
[57:06] you start to grow into maturity but it
[57:08] is god amen it is the life of christ
[57:11] standing over you drawing life out of
[57:13] you amen pulling you up amen what are
[57:16] you doing you're growing into all things
[57:18] into the head
[57:20] you're growing the body is growing up to
[57:22] meet the head that's what's happened to
[57:24] the church ages the body's growing up to
[57:26] meet the head what are you doing you're
[57:27] growing up to meet the head and the head
[57:30] is the thought the mind of god the the
[57:32] it is god himself they're drawing you
[57:34] building you up into himself the holy
[57:37] ghost is the strength of every one of
[57:38] these virtues is the holy ghost that
[57:40] birth you it's the holy ghost that's
[57:41] growing you and what's he growing you do
[57:43] he's pulling you to himself
[57:47] so we start with faith
[57:52] now
[57:52] this is the beginning
[57:55] of our walk because it begins by faith
[57:57] everything in the kingdom of god is
[57:59] acquired by faith
[58:01] everything begins by faith amen god even
[58:04] himself operates by faith
[58:07] because god spoke his word but he had to
[58:09] believe his own word for it to appear so
[58:11] even god operates by the law of faith
[58:14] everything in the kingdom of god
[58:15] operates by faith and we come to a birth
[58:18] by faith
[58:20] but well we'll get to that in a minute
[58:23] ephesians chapter 2 for by grace are you
[58:25] saved through faith and that not of
[58:27] yourselves it is the gift of god
[58:30] so now this is not even your faith
[58:34] to begin the journey this is i hope
[58:36] we've established one thing for sure
[58:38] today that that you're just the vessel
[58:41] that he's using this is his plan his
[58:43] work his strength his virtues his
[58:46] drawing power his coming to you for a
[58:49] birth it's his word it's his everything
[58:53] his plan his foreknowledge his
[58:55] predestination his power history it's
[58:58] his absolute everything that he's doing
[59:00] in you and he's over all of this drawing
[59:02] it up and welding it all together
[59:05] so by grace you're safe through faith
[59:07] that not of yourselves it is the gift of
[59:09] god
[59:12] now again in the stature of perfect man
[59:14] he says notice you must be born again
[59:16] and when you're born again you can't be
[59:18] born again without having faith that's
[59:20] right so you see on my chart here i got
[59:23] the very foundation faith is the
[59:25] foundation of all of it for without
[59:27] faith it is impossible to please god he
[59:29] that cometh to god must believe that he
[59:31] is and a rewarder of those that
[59:32] diligently seek him so faith is the
[59:35] starting point for us at birth you come
[59:38] to a birth by faith
[59:40] and he says jesus
[59:42] the apostle paul says in galatians 5 for
[59:44] in jesus christ neither circumcision
[59:47] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[59:49] faith which worketh by love
[59:52] so how does faith work by love
[59:55] where is love god is love the capstone
[59:58] so faith worketh by love what's he doing
[1:00:01] he's above all of this welding it all
[1:00:03] together putting it in growing it up
[1:00:06] bringing maturity amen what was it that
[1:00:08] brought faith grace what's grace a
[1:00:10] product of his love brother brennam says
[1:00:12] grace and love are twin sisters
[1:00:16] so what was that grace that bro that
[1:00:18] that gave me faith it was his love
[1:00:20] expressed to me and faith worketh by
[1:00:23] love what does it work by by the
[1:00:24] capstone by the head
[1:00:28] so
[1:00:29] my the point here is you can't even
[1:00:32] begin on the first level without the
[1:00:34] capstone already working in your life
[1:00:37] god already has the goal predetermined
[1:00:39] he knows where you're coming it's not
[1:00:41] that god is holding off and saying i'm
[1:00:43] not going to use him i'm not going to
[1:00:45] adopt him into the family until i know
[1:00:47] for sure that he's the right one he
[1:00:49] already knows you're the right one amen
[1:00:51] before you got started before you were
[1:00:53] born he knew you were the right one so
[1:00:55] now all the ingredients are in place and
[1:00:57] he's hovering over this what is it the
[1:00:59] holy ghost over your life
[1:01:01] welding these virtues together building
[1:01:04] in you into the image of god because
[1:01:06] what he wants is a tabernacle to live in
[1:01:08] to express himself through
[1:01:12] how can god express himself when you
[1:01:14] hate and lie and cheat and steal and
[1:01:17] how is that vessel expressing god
[1:01:20] god has to get this thing shaped into
[1:01:22] his image so it's a perfect expression
[1:01:26] in hebrews 11 he says now faith is the
[1:01:28] substance of things hoped for the
[1:01:29] evidence of things not seen for by it
[1:01:31] the elders obtained a good report but
[1:01:34] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:01:36] him for he that cometh to god must
[1:01:37] believe that he is
[1:01:39] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:01:41] diligently seek him
[1:01:43] so without faith you can't even please
[1:01:46] him
[1:01:48] without faith i can't please god
[1:01:51] so how do i get faith
[1:01:53] it's a gift
[1:01:56] it's a gift
[1:01:57] that comes from his love
[1:01:59] because faith worketh by love
[1:02:02] we love him because he first loved us
[1:02:05] i can't even please god without faith
[1:02:09] but god wants me to please him so he
[1:02:10] gives me faith
[1:02:13] oh i hope we can see the picture
[1:02:17] and the message the identification of
[1:02:19] christ in all ages he says therefore he
[1:02:22] and his word is the same so his word is
[1:02:24] perfect
[1:02:25] if you don't believe that don't never
[1:02:26] come in the prayer line because that's
[1:02:28] the only basis that you can accept
[1:02:29] anything faith can only take its rest
[1:02:32] upon something that's sure of and the
[1:02:34] real genuine faith rests itself on the
[1:02:37] eternal rock of god's eternal word
[1:02:40] it doesn't shift it stays right there
[1:02:42] regardless
[1:02:44] so the foundation of your maturing in
[1:02:48] christ
[1:02:49] is based on another foundation
[1:02:52] so your foundation is on a foundation
[1:02:55] and what is the foundation your faith on
[1:02:57] it's on the word of god
[1:02:59] because this whole building is built on
[1:03:02] the foundation of the apostles and
[1:03:03] prophets jesus christ being the chief
[1:03:05] cornerstone what is that it's the word
[1:03:08] amen what is our faith based on our
[1:03:10] faith is always based on the word our
[1:03:12] faith just doesn't float around but our
[1:03:14] faith is anchored to something and that
[1:03:16] anchor that it's anchored to is the word
[1:03:17] of god amen
[1:03:19] so what a sure foundation that you and i
[1:03:21] have because we're built upon the rock
[1:03:25] and the word is
[1:03:28] christ
[1:03:29] so we're built on christ
[1:03:31] growing into christ
[1:03:34] christ in the beginning christ in the
[1:03:36] end alpha and omega
[1:03:43] he says now you're going to build a
[1:03:45] house
[1:03:46] and you pour the foundation and say boy
[1:03:47] i got her you got the foundation to
[1:03:49] build your house on now you got to build
[1:03:51] a house now there's where the thing
[1:03:53] comes in this morning we're going to
[1:03:54] talk about now a house this foundation
[1:03:57] is first what is the foundation of
[1:03:59] christianity faith in the word of god
[1:04:01] that's your foundation then you begin to
[1:04:04] grow then you start you begin to add to
[1:04:07] this foundation so your foundation
[1:04:10] starts with faith in the word of god and
[1:04:12] faith is a
[1:04:14] revelation
[1:04:16] you have to have a revelation of your
[1:04:18] sonship you have to have a revelation of
[1:04:20] god calling you a revelation that you're
[1:04:22] a son of god amen is the basis that all
[1:04:24] of this starts on and that revelation
[1:04:27] amen to me is such a fundamental
[1:04:30] revelation that i know who i am amen i
[1:04:34] know that i am a child of god and that
[1:04:36] revelation that faith starts me on my
[1:04:39] journey to grow amen what am i a son of
[1:04:42] god who birthed me god what am i growing
[1:04:45] to god amen
[1:04:47] a wheat grows to look like a wheat amen
[1:04:49] a cocker bowl grows that will look like
[1:04:51] a cockle bird but praise god by this
[1:04:53] foundation based on the word of god i
[1:04:55] believe that i'm a son of god
[1:04:57] [Music]
[1:04:59] and so what do i expect to grow into
[1:05:02] i don't expect to grow into a raft about
[1:05:04] i don't expect to grow into a castaway i
[1:05:07] don't expect to grow into something with
[1:05:08] another image or something that reflects
[1:05:10] laodicea i expect because of my
[1:05:12] revelation that i will grow into the
[1:05:14] very image of jesus christ that's my
[1:05:16] target that's my whole heart that's my
[1:05:18] whole goal i'm not starting off afraid i
[1:05:21] won't make it but i'm starting on the
[1:05:23] rock of the word amen which said i was
[1:05:25] predestinated unto adoption i'm starting
[1:05:28] with a revelation of what my end will be
[1:05:31] [Music]
[1:05:33] i think that's what creates so much
[1:05:35] turmoil is i hope i make it i hope i can
[1:05:37] be this i hope i can be good enough i
[1:05:40] hope i have this and i hope i won't
[1:05:41] stumble too much and i hope the rapture
[1:05:43] won't come till i'm finished
[1:05:46] god's baking me i'm in the oven i
[1:05:48] i hope that the rapture doesn't come
[1:05:50] until the timer goes off amen
[1:05:53] there's no way amen you were
[1:05:55] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:05:57] the world in him to be blameless before
[1:05:59] him in love love started this journey
[1:06:02] love finishes this journey it's the love
[1:06:04] of god to you god's choice and it's what
[1:06:07] is it it's god loving himself
[1:06:11] that's why brother bennett said you can
[1:06:13] no more be lost in god can be lost let
[1:06:15] that be the rock that you're playing and
[1:06:16] let that be the foundation of this
[1:06:18] journey that i am part of god i come
[1:06:23] from god i'm going to god i mean i've
[1:06:25] got a lot of growing to do but i'm not
[1:06:27] worried about it i'm just going to sit
[1:06:29] here buy this stream drink this water
[1:06:32] eat this grass stay in the sun and it's
[1:06:34] going to come out of me
[1:06:38] but with that revelation it helps us to
[1:06:40] make other choices
[1:06:43] the distractions amen that can distract
[1:06:45] a sheep
[1:06:47] shiny things in the distance
[1:06:49] attractive sounds curious noises curious
[1:06:52] images amen when we know what our target
[1:06:55] is and we know where we're going and we
[1:06:57] know what we're on this earth for it
[1:06:59] helps us so much not to chase all the
[1:07:01] nonsense that's in line hey listen we
[1:07:03] live in laodicea you can do anything you
[1:07:06] want to do
[1:07:08] i mean it's it's available to you you
[1:07:10] can learn anything you want to learn
[1:07:11] amen you've got you've got access to
[1:07:14] funds you can get loans you can use
[1:07:16] credit cards you can save up money you
[1:07:18] can get a second job if you really want
[1:07:20] something you can do you can start a new
[1:07:21] hobby you can chase some interest
[1:07:25] and all of that can be a distraction
[1:07:29] and and that distraction amen can begin
[1:07:32] to slow down our growth
[1:07:34] but when we start on the basis of faith
[1:07:36] of who we are and what the trajectory is
[1:07:39] and where we're going to wind up then
[1:07:40] all of a sudden you say i don't need
[1:07:42] that
[1:07:43] i don't need that i don't need that and
[1:07:45] i'm not even talking about sinful things
[1:07:46] some of these things are not sin
[1:07:49] they're not wrong further education is
[1:07:51] not sin necessarily amen switching jobs
[1:07:53] necessarily is not sin having a hobby is
[1:07:55] not necessarily sin amen but it can
[1:07:57] definitely be a distraction off the
[1:07:59] point amen the purpose that god puts you
[1:08:01] on this earth and when you know your
[1:08:03] purpose all our decisions can line to
[1:08:05] that purpose
[1:08:07] i am here to reflect god i am here to be
[1:08:10] a living tabernacle a living image of a
[1:08:13] living god a written epistle read of all
[1:08:15] men i am not here for my purpose i'm
[1:08:17] here for his purpose i was not born
[1:08:20] again so that i could go chase my own
[1:08:22] desires he birthed me to grow me into
[1:08:24] his image
[1:08:26] so that i would reflect him
[1:08:28] so there's so many things in life
[1:08:31] that we could just do without
[1:08:34] and nobody has to rip them out of our
[1:08:35] hands
[1:08:37] nobody has to get up and say don't ever
[1:08:40] do this and don't ever do that and if
[1:08:42] you do that
[1:08:43] i mean of course the minister will
[1:08:45] always warn against traps and warn
[1:08:46] against things but when you really catch
[1:08:48] the vision of who you are and what your
[1:08:50] purpose says all of a sudden you say i
[1:08:52] don't need that
[1:08:54] i can lay that down i don't need it i
[1:08:56] don't want it amen nobody has to come
[1:08:59] into your house and do an inspection and
[1:09:01] make sure you're not secretly watching
[1:09:02] tv on some alternative device
[1:09:08] you see what i mean
[1:09:10] like
[1:09:11] you don't have to have a tv anymore you
[1:09:12] know it used to be it used to be easy to
[1:09:14] go inspect the believer's house
[1:09:17] you just open the cabinet doors you know
[1:09:20] but now it's in your pocket now it's
[1:09:21] everywhere so so god has made it so
[1:09:24] it's so perfect this satan is so perfect
[1:09:27] to prove the seed of god
[1:09:29] it's so perfectly designed to magnify
[1:09:32] the nature of god
[1:09:34] because only the divine nature will
[1:09:36] overcome this world
[1:09:39] so now
[1:09:40] it's the revelation that gives us the
[1:09:42] ability to set things down
[1:09:45] it's the revelation that gives us the
[1:09:46] desire to turn away from certain things
[1:09:48] not because somebody else in the church
[1:09:50] will find out and not because somebody
[1:09:52] will preach it against it and i'll feel
[1:09:53] bad but all of a sudden it doesn't fit
[1:09:56] into the picture god's painted for my
[1:09:57] life
[1:09:59] it doesn't match amen where i'm going it
[1:10:01] doesn't help me get to where i'm going
[1:10:04] so so many of these things can become
[1:10:06] distractions and eat up so much time but
[1:10:09] we can say i don't need it
[1:10:11] i don't want it and nobody has to force
[1:10:14] the issue
[1:10:17] so our foundation
[1:10:18] is a revelation
[1:10:20] our foundation is faith that worketh by
[1:10:23] love
[1:10:25] now i'd like to look at virtue
[1:10:29] the next one
[1:10:31] and jesus said
[1:10:32] who touched me
[1:10:34] then all denied peter and they that were
[1:10:36] with him said master the multitude
[1:10:38] thronged thee and pressed thee and
[1:10:40] sayest thou who touched me
[1:10:42] and jesus said somebody has touched me
[1:10:44] for i perceive that virtue has gone out
[1:10:46] of me
[1:10:48] jesus was a display of the divine nature
[1:10:52] and here he was passing through a crowd
[1:10:54] and a woman with a blood issue for 12
[1:10:56] years she touched to him of his garment
[1:10:58] and drew virtue out of christ and he he
[1:11:02] felt it he sensed it he stopped and said
[1:11:04] who touched me
[1:11:06] he knew that virtue had gone out of him
[1:11:08] and brother ben says well
[1:11:10] if i'm going to
[1:11:12] to be like jesus i've got to have virtue
[1:11:15] brother man tells us virtue is strength
[1:11:17] amen
[1:11:18] there was a certain strength that was in
[1:11:19] christ a virtue that this woman could
[1:11:21] tap into for her healing he said i've
[1:11:24] got to have virtue and past that that it
[1:11:26] can pass forward from me to people
[1:11:30] because virtue went out of him to the
[1:11:32] people
[1:11:33] virtue and before you can let it out
[1:11:36] you've got to have it first
[1:11:38] you haven't got it it won't come out
[1:11:40] there's nothing for it to come out of
[1:11:43] what if someone tried to draw virtue out
[1:11:45] of us and the check would return it's
[1:11:47] insufficient funds
[1:11:50] what a simple concept but brother ben
[1:11:52] said before somebody can draw virtue out
[1:11:55] of you there must be virtue in you to
[1:11:57] draw out first
[1:11:59] they can't draw something that's not
[1:12:01] there and when you look around so many
[1:12:04] times
[1:12:05] in christianity and
[1:12:07] even amongst our fellow brothers and
[1:12:09] sisters you find people who barely have
[1:12:12] enough strength to serve god for
[1:12:13] themselves
[1:12:15] can barely get to church can barely keep
[1:12:18] it together can barely and then anything
[1:12:21] goes wrong in their life they miss you
[1:12:23] know three four services because they
[1:12:24] just don't have enough strength to deal
[1:12:26] with and can't even hardly bring
[1:12:27] themselves to church and raise their
[1:12:29] hands and worship god because of the
[1:12:31] trials and the tribulations and the
[1:12:32] stresses and all that amen but god wants
[1:12:35] to build enough strength amen you've got
[1:12:38] to have strength to walk in this life
[1:12:40] and where does strength come from it
[1:12:41] comes from christ it comes from the holy
[1:12:44] ghost he's over this welding these
[1:12:46] things together amen in the revelation
[1:12:48] built upon revelation will come strength
[1:12:50] amen because the revelation will bring
[1:12:52] us strength the life of christ will
[1:12:55] bring us strength not just strength so
[1:12:57] we can be a christian strength so that
[1:12:59] somebody else can draw virtue out of us
[1:13:03] the virtue he's talking about is not
[1:13:04] just strength to endure the world
[1:13:06] strength to stand against laodicea
[1:13:08] you've got to have that strength plus
[1:13:10] strength for someone else
[1:13:13] amen so it's not we can look at
[1:13:16] ourselves when we get into these things
[1:13:18] and if anything that's preached today
[1:13:20] begins to strike a spot just just go to
[1:13:22] the lord and say lord you've promised by
[1:13:25] these promises that i can be a partaker
[1:13:28] of the divine nature and i find in
[1:13:30] myself a lack of virtue
[1:13:33] but i believe that by these divine
[1:13:36] promises i'm a partaker of the divine
[1:13:38] nature i need you to pour into me virtue
[1:13:41] i need more strength than i have right
[1:13:43] now
[1:13:45] i mean i can barely make it through the
[1:13:47] week i can barely hold it together i can
[1:13:50] barely keep confessing a positive
[1:13:52] confession amen and i've got to keep
[1:13:55] going back and i need somebody else amen
[1:13:58] and there's there's some amongst us
[1:13:59] that's always drawing strength from
[1:14:01] somebody else got to get with the
[1:14:03] brother got to talk to somebody else
[1:14:04] about their problems got to have
[1:14:06] somebody else pray with them again and
[1:14:08] that's fine because all of us are on
[1:14:10] different stages we have brothers who
[1:14:11] are just born and sisters just born they
[1:14:14] need our virtue
[1:14:16] but some at some point we've got to grow
[1:14:19] that god puts virtue in us amen do i
[1:14:22] don't constantly have to go amen and
[1:14:25] draw from somebody else just so i can
[1:14:27] make it another week draw from somebody
[1:14:29] else just so i can overcome this trial
[1:14:31] amen god can pour the divine nature into
[1:14:34] me because by the promise i have a right
[1:14:36] to be a partaker of the divine nature
[1:14:38] it's for me it's part of my growth
[1:14:42] i can have enough strength to make it in
[1:14:45] this world
[1:14:46] i can have enough strength to overcome
[1:14:48] trials i can have enough strength to
[1:14:51] testify to witness to pray for somebody
[1:14:53] else to stand in the gap for so i can
[1:14:55] have enough strength that somebody can
[1:14:56] come and draw from me
[1:14:59] so if you find yourself always drawing
[1:15:02] and no one drawing from you go to the
[1:15:04] lord say lord i need that virtue
[1:15:07] i find lacking and god revealed to me
[1:15:09] anything in my life that's plugging the
[1:15:11] channel
[1:15:13] because i promise you the problem is not
[1:15:15] on god's side
[1:15:16] [Music]
[1:15:18] so say god revealed to me if there's
[1:15:20] anything i know this is my destiny i
[1:15:22] know this is where i'm going i know this
[1:15:24] is what you call me to don't start the
[1:15:26] question of well maybe i'm not a
[1:15:28] believer get that out of your mind now
[1:15:30] you should have got that out at the
[1:15:31] foundation
[1:15:33] that's why sometimes we can never go on
[1:15:35] to the right kind of strength because
[1:15:36] we're still questioning the first level
[1:15:40] am i a child of god or not have i been
[1:15:41] born again or not and then there's never
[1:15:44] never strength we can never grow in
[1:15:46] strength we can never have greater
[1:15:47] strength we can never have strength for
[1:15:48] somebody else because we're still
[1:15:50] questioning step one
[1:15:54] step one is based on the word
[1:15:56] and a revelation of the word
[1:15:59] go back and say god let me see myself in
[1:16:02] your word
[1:16:03] who am i god
[1:16:05] and from faith
[1:16:07] then add to your faith virtue
[1:16:10] say god
[1:16:12] i need more strength
[1:16:14] god i want to stand like you would stand
[1:16:18] isn't that the point
[1:16:20] to have
[1:16:21] godlike virtue holy ghost virtue
[1:16:25] not just this is not gritting teeth and
[1:16:28] bearing it kind of virtue
[1:16:30] this is not brother chad said something
[1:16:32] about always going to some people so i'm
[1:16:34] not going to go talk to anybody else i'm
[1:16:35] going to be stronger
[1:16:38] that will never work
[1:16:41] never work
[1:16:42] this has to be holy ghost virtue
[1:16:45] something that comes from the seed
[1:16:47] within and is grown up by the holy ghost
[1:16:50] as he's drawing more of the divine
[1:16:52] nature out of the seed more out of the
[1:16:55] sea gene of god what is the seed gene of
[1:16:57] god it contains the potentials of god
[1:16:59] and the holy ghost is drawing all those
[1:17:01] potentials out in our life
[1:17:03] and god wants us to have virtue
[1:17:07] not just so we can make it through
[1:17:08] another week
[1:17:10] not just so i can get back to the
[1:17:11] service again on wednesday and then get
[1:17:13] back on sunday but god wants us to have
[1:17:15] another an enough virtue that somebody
[1:17:18] can come to us and draw it out
[1:17:21] somebody at work somebody in our family
[1:17:23] a another brother or sister somebody who
[1:17:26] needs virtue that i can't say
[1:17:29] i'm sorry
[1:17:30] i'm too weak and i'm too tired to help
[1:17:32] you
[1:17:34] when you're going to start
[1:17:36] serving
[1:17:38] the body of christ
[1:17:40] you're going to have to have virtue
[1:17:42] because there's needs out there and when
[1:17:45] people begin to talk and when they want
[1:17:47] to counsel and they want prayer and they
[1:17:48] want you to pray for them it draws
[1:17:50] virtue out of you jesus felt it come out
[1:17:52] of him
[1:17:55] jesus and brother brenham said you see
[1:17:57] why i get weak he said it's all of you
[1:18:00] you're pulling amen you're pulling on
[1:18:02] that gift and it's drawing virtue out of
[1:18:04] the prophet of god and he would get so
[1:18:06] weak he'd begin to stagger in the pulpit
[1:18:08] amen and he would go home and he would
[1:18:10] be crying as they took him away and
[1:18:12] telling them to take him back home then
[1:18:13] they'd walk him on the streets so he'd
[1:18:14] come to himself he'd go back to prayer
[1:18:16] he'd go back that night into his hotel
[1:18:18] room pray and he come back the next day
[1:18:20] and do it all over again why because he
[1:18:22] was a son of god expressing god's virtue
[1:18:26] amen and god does wants us to have
[1:18:28] enough virtue not just to live in
[1:18:30] laodicea he wants to have enough virtue
[1:18:32] that you can be a tap a source a virtue
[1:18:35] for somebody who needs virtue
[1:18:37] so that somebody at work amen where they
[1:18:39] can begin to draw virtue from you and
[1:18:42] somebody else can draw virtue from you
[1:18:44] and you still have enough virtue to make
[1:18:46] it to live to survive
[1:18:49] i say god give us more virtue
[1:18:52] this is real holy ghost virtue
[1:18:56] now we want to look at knowledge
[1:19:00] it says and then thirdly you add
[1:19:02] knowledge knowledge now that don't mean
[1:19:04] worldly knowledge because that's
[1:19:06] foolishness to god but knowledge to
[1:19:08] judge to judge what right from wrong
[1:19:11] how do you judge it then if you've got
[1:19:12] christian knowledge with your virtue and
[1:19:14] faith you judge whether the word is
[1:19:16] right or wrong
[1:19:18] and if you can lay aside all your creeds
[1:19:20] and all your unbelief and everything
[1:19:21] that you claim to have done then you
[1:19:23] have knowledge to believe that god
[1:19:24] cannot lie
[1:19:26] let every man's word be a lie but mind
[1:19:28] true now you're getting knowledge that's
[1:19:30] supreme knowledge you don't have to have
[1:19:33] four degrees in some college or
[1:19:35] something like that to have it because
[1:19:37] all these virtues are given to you by
[1:19:39] god to place upon the foundation of your
[1:19:42] faith that you might come to the full
[1:19:44] stature of a real living man of god yes
[1:19:47] sir and add knowledge because knowledge
[1:19:50] of his word
[1:19:52] amen i think this is so astounding that
[1:19:55] god wants us to have knowledge
[1:19:58] not worldly knowledge
[1:20:00] but knowledge of the word
[1:20:02] because
[1:20:03] that
[1:20:04] when you're building to the the statue
[1:20:06] of a perfect man you're coming to the
[1:20:07] image of christ amen you have to start
[1:20:09] with a revelation with faith enough to
[1:20:12] know you're a son of god and upon that
[1:20:14] you need some strength to operate in
[1:20:15] this life but as you gain some strength
[1:20:17] to operate you need some knowledge some
[1:20:19] understanding to understand the plan of
[1:20:21] god and what's going on amen
[1:20:24] you know
[1:20:25] the whole idea is i don't want to know
[1:20:26] all the details i just want to i just
[1:20:28] want to just just i just want to know
[1:20:30] god well god is the one who gave all the
[1:20:32] details
[1:20:34] you understand
[1:20:36] god is the one who brought the message
[1:20:38] god is the one who preached the seals
[1:20:40] god is the one who gave the
[1:20:41] interpretation of the symbols god gave
[1:20:44] information because god wants us to know
[1:20:46] his plan he wants us to know what was in
[1:20:48] the back part of his mind amen knowledge
[1:20:50] has a way of settling us and raising us
[1:20:52] over situations and giving us eyes to
[1:20:55] see when we know the purpose and plan of
[1:20:57] god god wants us to have word knowledge
[1:21:00] holy ghost knowledge of the word
[1:21:04] if not you're like a child
[1:21:06] tossed to and fro by every wind of
[1:21:08] doctrine
[1:21:10] every wave of doctrine he doesn't want
[1:21:12] us to be children that's what he said in
[1:21:14] ephesians he wants us to grow up into
[1:21:16] the full stature of christ no more his
[1:21:18] children toss to and fro by every wind
[1:21:20] of doctrine
[1:21:21] he doesn't want everybody to be able to
[1:21:23] sway us this way and sway us that way he
[1:21:26] doesn't want somebody to come and line
[1:21:27] up two quotes and move us all the way
[1:21:29] over here and then come later with two
[1:21:31] other quotes and swing us all the way
[1:21:32] over here but he wants to give you a
[1:21:34] revelation of his word knowledge of his
[1:21:36] word to establish us so we're not tossed
[1:21:38] all about that we get the big picture
[1:21:40] because god has given us enough
[1:21:42] information to paint the picture
[1:21:44] he has revealed his word in this day
[1:21:46] he's tied together all the loose ends
[1:21:48] you want to talk about details this
[1:21:50] message is so full of details it'll
[1:21:52] blind you if you try to swallow it all
[1:21:54] at once
[1:21:56] detail upon detail upon dj and brother
[1:21:58] branham said when he's preaching the
[1:21:59] seals he goes i could preach a month of
[1:22:01] sundays i could just go around and
[1:22:03] around that clock and still not touch
[1:22:05] one of those seals
[1:22:07] there's so much there and it's there for
[1:22:10] us amen it's not for us to say i mean i
[1:22:12] don't need to know that you need to do
[1:22:14] it god gave it he wants you to have
[1:22:16] godly knowledge but not like a textbook
[1:22:18] not intellectualism not to pass a test
[1:22:21] not to recite a bunch of phrases and
[1:22:22] prove that you're something but he wants
[1:22:24] you to be established by the knowledge
[1:22:26] of god amen
[1:22:30] that's why we're preaching that's why
[1:22:32] we're teaching that's why we go over
[1:22:34] these things amen because god's building
[1:22:36] in us knowledge it's part of the statue
[1:22:38] of a perfect man
[1:22:40] he said you're getting to be pretty good
[1:22:42] man right now
[1:22:44] see you're coming up what with with
[1:22:46] faith and virtue the knowledge you see
[1:22:48] how it's building this man you can see
[1:22:50] there's no way escaping it this is the
[1:22:52] way to become in the full stature of
[1:22:54] christ
[1:22:56] there's no way to get around it you've
[1:22:57] got to go through these processes
[1:22:59] and if you notice as you add to this to
[1:23:02] this to this to this
[1:23:03] it's growing more and more and more into
[1:23:06] the image of christ
[1:23:07] it's shaping more and more to begin to
[1:23:10] reflect what it's looking at
[1:23:13] so as we grow
[1:23:15] we're losing more of ourselves in
[1:23:16] becoming more like him
[1:23:19] more and more it's less of us and more
[1:23:22] of him
[1:23:23] and so god wants us to have this
[1:23:26] biblical knowledge this
[1:23:28] holy ghost knowledge
[1:23:30] second corinthians he says for god who
[1:23:31] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:23:33] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[1:23:35] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:23:38] glory of god in the face of jesus christ
[1:23:41] jesus christ was the reflection of god
[1:23:43] and he shined in our hearts to give us
[1:23:45] the
[1:23:46] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[1:23:48] of god
[1:23:49] god wanted us to know something
[1:23:52] about himself
[1:23:54] that's why he came in the form of man so
[1:23:56] that we could he could be we could
[1:23:58] understand god better
[1:24:00] that is why he came in flesh to redeem
[1:24:03] us he wants us to know something about
[1:24:05] him
[1:24:06] god had a mystery hidden in the back
[1:24:08] part of his mind
[1:24:10] but that mystery he wanted somebody else
[1:24:12] to know it
[1:24:13] he wasn't always going to keep it a
[1:24:15] secret
[1:24:16] he wasn't always going to stay in the
[1:24:17] back of art of his mind it wasn't always
[1:24:19] going to be hidden
[1:24:20] and that mystery contained knowledge
[1:24:24] understanding information
[1:24:26] and in due season he took what was in
[1:24:28] the back part of his mind and he brought
[1:24:30] it out through a prophetic ministry and
[1:24:32] brought it through the lips of a prophet
[1:24:34] because there was something god wanted
[1:24:36] his bride to know
[1:24:39] and i say thank god for that we need
[1:24:42] holy ghost knowledge we need to be
[1:24:44] established in the word
[1:24:46] we can't listen we can't live this whole
[1:24:49] life by feelings because your feelings
[1:24:50] will change
[1:24:53] so many people want to know the holy
[1:24:54] ghost or not by feelings i feel this way
[1:24:56] and i feel that way your feelings will
[1:24:58] end up derailing you somewhere
[1:25:00] you have to have holy ghost knowledge of
[1:25:02] the word to check your feeling with
[1:25:06] because god didn't god gave us his word
[1:25:09] as our foundation not our feelings amen
[1:25:11] but you don't operate without feelings
[1:25:13] god leads us personally individually but
[1:25:15] we have to have still a rock somewhere
[1:25:17] because our feelings are too fickle and
[1:25:19] they move all over the place we can't
[1:25:20] just serve god by feelings we have to
[1:25:22] know the word amen
[1:25:24] and when god leads us god leads you god
[1:25:27] god definitely leads by an inward word
[1:25:29] and he can move you and he can lead you
[1:25:31] and he can speak to you amen but you've
[1:25:33] got something
[1:25:34] knowledge to know what is this voice
[1:25:36] that's speaking to me it's god because
[1:25:38] it matches the word
[1:25:41] praise god
[1:25:44] in ephesians chapter 1 verse 17 that the
[1:25:47] god of our lord jesus christ the father
[1:25:49] of glory may give unto you the spirit of
[1:25:51] wisdom and revelation and the knowledge
[1:25:53] of him
[1:25:55] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:25:56] enlightened that you may know what is
[1:25:58] the hope of his calling and what is the
[1:26:00] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:26:02] in the saints
[1:26:04] that's why paul was preaching
[1:26:06] paul was preaching so that you would
[1:26:08] know
[1:26:09] so that you would know the word so that
[1:26:10] you would have the word so that you
[1:26:11] would be established
[1:26:13] in the word so that you'd grow up into
[1:26:15] christ and not be tossed by every wind
[1:26:17] of doctrine but that you would god would
[1:26:19] share
[1:26:20] knowledge with us in his word so that we
[1:26:23] would be established enough that when
[1:26:25] everything comes along you don't have to
[1:26:27] move instantly you can say hold on
[1:26:29] let me check this with the word
[1:26:31] you don't have to sweep off on the one
[1:26:33] side and sweep off in the other you say
[1:26:34] come back and say but god sent us a
[1:26:36] prophet and that prophet unlocked the
[1:26:38] mind of god let me come back to this
[1:26:40] word amen i've got something that we're
[1:26:42] building up into the image of christ and
[1:26:44] as we grow up and get higher this this
[1:26:46] holy ghost knowledge comes in
[1:26:49] can't get there without it
[1:26:52] brother said i believe in genuine holy
[1:26:54] ghost knowledge holy ghost knowledge
[1:26:56] will always punctuate the word with amen
[1:26:58] when you get these things that seem to
[1:27:00] contradict themselves in the bible you
[1:27:02] sit down and study it and prayerfully
[1:27:04] like that and the first thing you know
[1:27:06] the holy spirit begins to move in after
[1:27:08] a while you see it ties together and
[1:27:10] there you get it that's knowledge
[1:27:13] praise be to god what is this knowledge
[1:27:15] is god revealing the word amen and
[1:27:18] showing you it's not a contradiction
[1:27:20] even in the message even the message
[1:27:21] we're talking about today seemed like a
[1:27:23] contradiction he said the baptism of
[1:27:25] holy ghost is your birth then he says
[1:27:26] the capping off is the baptism of the
[1:27:28] holy ghost and statue of a perfect man
[1:27:30] it looks like a contradiction but let
[1:27:32] the holy ghost knowledge come in and say
[1:27:34] there is no contradiction here
[1:27:37] amen what is he teaching what is he
[1:27:39] getting me to understand what's it going
[1:27:40] to take holy ghost knowledge or else
[1:27:43] we're going to get hung up in the
[1:27:45] contradictions in the bible and the
[1:27:47] contradictions in the message
[1:27:50] you say what yeah one time brother ben
[1:27:52] will say something like this
[1:27:54] and later he'll say it like this
[1:27:57] and if you take it on surface just
[1:27:59] surface value amen with no understanding
[1:28:01] whatsoever it looks like maybe they're a
[1:28:03] polar opposite statement
[1:28:07] it's going to take some holy ghost
[1:28:08] knowledge to go a little deeper
[1:28:11] amen it's going to take some holy ghost
[1:28:12] knowledge in the word to say god what is
[1:28:15] this and pray about it and wait for the
[1:28:17] holy ghost and all of a sudden you see
[1:28:18] it tied together through the whole
[1:28:20] message through the bible back and forth
[1:28:22] and all of a sudden you say i got it i
[1:28:24] understand now i know and guess what
[1:28:26] that thing will never trip you up again
[1:28:29] when that holy ghost knowledge comes
[1:28:31] nobody will sway you off with that
[1:28:33] nobody will trip you on that amen god
[1:28:35] has put another rock down in your heart
[1:28:37] and you know what he's talking about and
[1:28:39] god's not going to use that amen he's
[1:28:41] not going to use any of that to trip you
[1:28:43] up anymore
[1:28:46] praise be to god
[1:28:48] we love holy ghost knowledge holy ghost
[1:28:51] virtue holy ghost faith
[1:28:54] i want to look at temperance
[1:28:58] temperance this is out of the
[1:29:00] concordance temperance means
[1:29:01] self-control
[1:29:03] the virtue of one who's mastered his
[1:29:04] desires and passions
[1:29:06] especially essential appetites
[1:29:10] brother branham he says it this way i
[1:29:11] didn't put on the overhead because it's
[1:29:12] a long quote but he says
[1:29:14] fourthly we'll have to hurry
[1:29:16] because it just feels so good to stand
[1:29:18] here and talk about it amen
[1:29:20] fourthly and temperance oh my we've come
[1:29:23] to temperance now you've had faith first
[1:29:26] have to have that to begin with then you
[1:29:28] add virtue to your faith if it's the
[1:29:30] right kind of virtue then you add
[1:29:31] knowledge if it's the right kind of
[1:29:32] knowledge now you're going to add
[1:29:34] temperance
[1:29:36] temperance doesn't mean stop drinking
[1:29:37] alcohol
[1:29:38] hear either no no tempers doesn't mean
[1:29:40] alcoholic cure not in this case this is
[1:29:43] bible temperance holy spirit temperance
[1:29:46] that's just one of the lusts of the
[1:29:48] flesh but we're talking about the holy
[1:29:50] spirit temperance that means how to
[1:29:52] control your tongue not be a tattler how
[1:29:55] to control your temper not fly off every
[1:29:57] time everybody speaks across to you oh
[1:29:59] my
[1:30:00] boy a lot of us going to fall off before
[1:30:02] we get started aren't we then we wonder
[1:30:05] why god is not in his church doing
[1:30:06] miracles and things that he used to do
[1:30:08] yes sir see and these things add
[1:30:10] temperance to it oh temperance how to
[1:30:13] answer in kindness when wrath is spoken
[1:30:15] to you
[1:30:17] that means there's no such thing as road
[1:30:19] rage
[1:30:22] in the divine nature
[1:30:25] so if you find yourself mad at everybody
[1:30:27] on the road
[1:30:28] we need a little more temperance
[1:30:31] we need the divine nature
[1:30:34] amen
[1:30:35] not that you can't point out somebody
[1:30:37] did something wrong because i mean
[1:30:39] there's some bad things that happen
[1:30:43] but i'm talking about when you just
[1:30:44] can't even get over it amen you're just
[1:30:46] getting the rage you get so mad and
[1:30:48] you want to blare your horn and run up
[1:30:50] on somebody's bumper because you're so
[1:30:51] mad that they cut you off or they did
[1:30:53] this or that i'm telling you if that's
[1:30:55] where you're at and you need to go back
[1:30:56] to the lord say i need holy ghost
[1:30:58] temperance
[1:30:59] i need something to flow out of me to
[1:31:00] overcome this old nature that's inside
[1:31:02] of me
[1:31:05] amen
[1:31:07] at temperance oh temperance how to
[1:31:08] answer in kindness when rather spoke to
[1:31:10] you
[1:31:11] somebody say you bunch of holy rollers
[1:31:13] down there don't jump out and roll up
[1:31:14] your sleeves now not that but talk with
[1:31:17] godly love temperance kindness is that
[1:31:19] the way you want to be when you're all
[1:31:21] riled up rile not back let him be your
[1:31:23] example
[1:31:25] when when they said if you be the whole
[1:31:27] the son of god turn these stones in the
[1:31:28] bread he could have done it he showed he
[1:31:31] was god but he had temperance
[1:31:34] then when they called him beelzebub he
[1:31:36] said i'll forgive you for it that's
[1:31:37] right they pulled handfuls of beard out
[1:31:39] of his face and spit in his face and
[1:31:40] said come down off the cross he said
[1:31:42] father forgive them they don't even know
[1:31:44] what they're doing
[1:31:47] when he had the gift he knowed all
[1:31:49] things for in him was the fullness of
[1:31:50] the godhead bodily they had seen him
[1:31:53] perform miracles by telling people what
[1:31:54] was wrong with them and so forth like
[1:31:56] that they put a rag around his head like
[1:31:58] that around his eyes and hit him on the
[1:32:00] head with a stick and said prophesy tell
[1:32:03] us who hit you we'll believe you see he
[1:32:05] had
[1:32:07] he had temperance now if you've got it
[1:32:09] like that add it to your faith if you
[1:32:11] still blow up and sass and fuss and stew
[1:32:14] and carry on you ain't got no you you
[1:32:17] can't add that because it won't add
[1:32:19] it won't vulcanize you couldn't take a
[1:32:22] piece of rubber you know and vulcanize
[1:32:24] it with a piece of iron it just won't
[1:32:26] work no it's got to be flexible just
[1:32:28] like the rubberisc and when your faith
[1:32:30] and your temperance becomes the same
[1:32:32] kind of holy ghost temperance that he
[1:32:34] had then it will vulcanize with him
[1:32:37] you're added to it
[1:32:38] when your virtue is like his virtue then
[1:32:41] it will add to it when your knowledge is
[1:32:43] like his knowledge i come to do th thy
[1:32:45] will o god see with the father's word he
[1:32:47] defeated every devil heavens and earth
[1:32:49] will pass away but the word will not
[1:32:51] when you got that kind of knowledge
[1:32:53] it'll vulcanize with your faith
[1:32:55] when you got the right kind of
[1:32:56] temperance like he had it'll vulcanize
[1:32:59] if you haven't just a man-made half-way
[1:33:01] soused up belief or temperance oh i
[1:33:03] ought to slap him down but maybe i
[1:33:05] better not because they might not put my
[1:33:07] name in the paper about they might put
[1:33:09] my name in the paper about it that ain't
[1:33:11] the kind of temperance he's talking
[1:33:12] about
[1:33:13] don't try to add that it won't work but
[1:33:16] when you can really with sweetness from
[1:33:17] your heart forgive every man hold your
[1:33:19] peace let it be gone see then it'll
[1:33:21] vulcanize you can add that to your faith
[1:33:24] [Music]
[1:33:26] so as we come up more and more into the
[1:33:28] image of christ higher in the divine
[1:33:30] nature now we come to temperance which
[1:33:32] is self-control
[1:33:34] and where where instead of getting angry
[1:33:37] and fussing and talking back now there's
[1:33:40] a whole different approach to all of
[1:33:42] these situations and it's got to be the
[1:33:44] kind of temperance he had
[1:33:45] and then you see moses failed
[1:33:48] in temperance
[1:33:50] moses got angry because they kept
[1:33:52] pushing him and pushing him and pushing
[1:33:54] him and finally he grabbed his staff and
[1:33:56] and smote the rock a second time which
[1:33:58] was not according to the word of god and
[1:34:00] it was lack of temperance that kept him
[1:34:02] out of the promised land
[1:34:04] but you see david a man after god's own
[1:34:06] heart he had temperance when when when
[1:34:09] saul his enemy that's chasing him and
[1:34:11] trying to kill him and
[1:34:12] speaking evil of him and chasing him and
[1:34:14] trying to destroy his life he comes into
[1:34:17] the same cave where david and his men
[1:34:18] are hiding and he lays down and goes to
[1:34:20] sleep and his men begin to tell him you
[1:34:23] can take him
[1:34:25] look god has delivered him to you
[1:34:30] they start even using religious talk
[1:34:34] trying to convince him to kill his enemy
[1:34:37] and and saul was doing evil to david
[1:34:40] david on a human level had every right
[1:34:43] to retaliate
[1:34:46] but david had knowledge
[1:34:48] and that knowledge was he's been
[1:34:50] anointed by the prophet he's been
[1:34:52] anointed by god to be king and that
[1:34:54] knowledge
[1:34:55] brought him temperance
[1:34:58] and said how dare i touch god's anointed
[1:35:01] and he had self-control although he was
[1:35:04] evilly mistreated evenly spoke about
[1:35:07] deceived and trapped and almost killed
[1:35:10] my soul when saul came in even the
[1:35:12] religious rhetoric of his closest
[1:35:14] friends saying god has delivered him to
[1:35:16] he wouldn't even move past that because
[1:35:18] he had knowledge and knowledge he added
[1:35:20] to his knowledge temperance and now he
[1:35:22] had self-control and he would not touch
[1:35:24] god's elect
[1:35:26] he would do no harm to the anointed of
[1:35:28] the lord and he went down and he cut a
[1:35:30] little section off of his skirt amen and
[1:35:32] when saul went out he stood up on the
[1:35:34] mountain and he yelled back to him and
[1:35:35] all that had happened but i spared you
[1:35:37] and he had this great discourse and even
[1:35:40] then he repented that he even cut the
[1:35:42] hem of his skirt
[1:35:44] even said that was too much
[1:35:46] and and all of his buddies were like too
[1:35:48] much i mean you didn't he was in your
[1:35:50] hands
[1:35:52] but he had temperance
[1:35:55] that's the kind of temperance that god
[1:35:57] wants us to have
[1:35:59] then when you have every right every
[1:36:01] opportunity
[1:36:03] you you can you can you can really i
[1:36:06] mean you can really let them have it
[1:36:08] because they've been pushing and pushing
[1:36:10] and pushing and now finally i've got the
[1:36:12] open window i've got every right i'm in
[1:36:14] the right i've got the right words amen
[1:36:16] but if you're doing that in retaliation
[1:36:19] if you're doing that out of hurt if
[1:36:21] you're doing that to get back and you
[1:36:23] need some temperance and say i'm not
[1:36:25] going to take my rights and i'm not
[1:36:26] going to say anything although it's the
[1:36:28] truth i'm not going to speak because
[1:36:30] it's it's meant to hurt
[1:36:34] so many people think they can say
[1:36:35] anything they want if it's true
[1:36:38] you'll see people sometimes say
[1:36:39] something to somebody it's so rude so
[1:36:41] cutting so sharp and you say something
[1:36:43] to them say but it was the truth
[1:36:46] jesus could have said a lot of things
[1:36:48] that was the truth but he didn't say a
[1:36:49] word
[1:36:51] when he stood before pilate he could
[1:36:52] have said a lot of things but he didn't
[1:36:54] speak when he was on the cross he could
[1:36:55] have said a lot of things that would
[1:36:57] have been every bit the truth but he
[1:36:59] kept his peace
[1:37:00] all he said is father forgive them
[1:37:03] we think sometimes we have a right to
[1:37:05] cut people down or set the record
[1:37:07] straight or expose somebody's sin or
[1:37:09] something like that and then we feel
[1:37:11] justified because it's the truth
[1:37:14] i think what we need is some holy ghost
[1:37:16] temperance
[1:37:18] to say what good would it do anyways it
[1:37:20] won't change them
[1:37:22] if you speak the truth you have to speak
[1:37:23] the truth in love
[1:37:26] so don't be angry at a brother and want
[1:37:28] to stick it to him and say i'm just
[1:37:29] saying this because i love you
[1:37:32] that doesn't justify what you're getting
[1:37:34] ready to do amen you have to really love
[1:37:37] them to say the truth not say you love
[1:37:40] them just to clear up you know i've
[1:37:42] already okay i love you okay now i'm
[1:37:44] going to cut you to the heart
[1:37:46] in front of your wife and your children
[1:37:48] but i already said i love you and i said
[1:37:50] it in love so it's the truth and i'm
[1:37:51] okay no we need some temperance
[1:37:54] to control ourselves no retaliation
[1:37:58] there's no there doesn't need to be any
[1:37:59] retaliation
[1:38:01] you know jesus didn't even set the
[1:38:03] record straight
[1:38:06] so many false accusations so many things
[1:38:09] were said against him so many lies
[1:38:11] defaming his character calling them
[1:38:13] bails above doubting his birth all these
[1:38:16] things uh they were coming against him
[1:38:18] amen denying his place in scripture
[1:38:20] denying his sonship all of these things
[1:38:22] and he never set the record straight
[1:38:26] he let them believe whatever they wanted
[1:38:28] to believe he had absolute temperance he
[1:38:30] was just going to do what god told him
[1:38:31] to do
[1:38:33] i mean so many times we're so tempted
[1:38:35] when somebody spoke evil about us or
[1:38:37] said something or a rumor comes full
[1:38:39] circle and comes around and you know
[1:38:41] that's not true hey you know what
[1:38:44] sometimes it doesn't do any good to set
[1:38:46] the record straight and most of the time
[1:38:47] when you try to set the record straight
[1:38:49] you look guiltier
[1:38:53] sometimes that's just the trap of the
[1:38:54] devil to get you in a little deeper
[1:38:58] jesus didn't pay the time of day to it
[1:39:00] he kept doing what the father called him
[1:39:01] to do and i think it's a good habit for
[1:39:03] us does not pay any attention to the
[1:39:05] rhetoric not pay any attention to the
[1:39:07] accusation of somebody at work he's
[1:39:10] trying to defame your character trying
[1:39:12] to take credit for your work just let it
[1:39:14] go let god expose it when god does it's
[1:39:17] way better anyways
[1:39:20] you're not here for a promotion and
[1:39:22] you're not here for a good name at work
[1:39:24] you're here to serve god's purpose
[1:39:26] and if it god's purpose he has you in
[1:39:28] that job and you need a good standing in
[1:39:30] that job god will right the wrong and
[1:39:32] when god writes the wrong i mean nobody
[1:39:35] can work like god can work and nobody
[1:39:37] can fix a situation like god can fix the
[1:39:39] situation in fact if you keep quiet and
[1:39:43] have temperance and have and you just
[1:39:44] wait on the lord and have patience you
[1:39:46] watch god work by the time god's done
[1:39:48] you'll feel sorry for that man or woman
[1:39:52] that's what will happen you'll have
[1:39:53] sympathy for them
[1:39:55] and because i mean you could have been
[1:39:57] so upset so hurt and have such a
[1:39:59] temptation to go set the record straight
[1:40:01] because you know that they would be in
[1:40:02] big trouble you didn't do anything wrong
[1:40:04] they did it wrong they're lying blah
[1:40:06] blah blah whatever but you just hush up
[1:40:08] and have temperance control yourself and
[1:40:10] stay in the line god puts you in and
[1:40:12] when god solves that problem you end up
[1:40:14] saying oh god help them i'm sorry i
[1:40:16] didn't want that to happen to them
[1:40:18] you'll feel so sorry for them
[1:40:22] amen what is it going to take holy ghost
[1:40:24] temperance
[1:40:27] just to say
[1:40:28] if i say anything it won't change
[1:40:30] anything
[1:40:32] i could tell them
[1:40:33] but what's it going to matter i'm i'm
[1:40:36] going to be under control of my emotions
[1:40:40] my tongue
[1:40:41] i am going to possess my vessel
[1:40:45] because he taught us how we ought to
[1:40:47] possess our vessel
[1:40:49] and by the grace of god with his holy
[1:40:51] ghost leadership i want to possess this
[1:40:54] vessel for the glory of god
[1:40:56] i need some holy ghost temperance
[1:40:58] because this vessel still has a sticky
[1:41:00] cockapoo nature to it
[1:41:03] if you poke this vessel the first thing
[1:41:05] he wants to do is poke you back
[1:41:07] is that right
[1:41:10] amen but there's something else coming
[1:41:12] on the inside that now when you poke me
[1:41:15] all i want to do is say father forgive
[1:41:17] them they didn't mean that
[1:41:20] somebody tells a lie about you you say
[1:41:22] you know father just
[1:41:23] forgive them for my sake i don't want
[1:41:25] any harm to come their way
[1:41:28] a whole different level of self-control
[1:41:32] not reformation
[1:41:34] not holding yourself back
[1:41:36] not gripping the seat so you don't honk
[1:41:38] the horn
[1:41:40] that's not temperance
[1:41:42] that's not holy ghost temperance
[1:41:44] not where you have to be patient all day
[1:41:46] long and just
[1:41:48] then all of a sudden something horrible
[1:41:49] flies out of my mouth we need some
[1:41:51] temperance amen it's not counting to 10.
[1:41:55] it's not five deep breaths
[1:41:58] that's not temperance
[1:42:00] temperances say god hey i need i need to
[1:42:03] have temperance like you have temperance
[1:42:05] i need temperance and me to reflect your
[1:42:07] temperance amen and every one of us can
[1:42:10] find some of these virtues that our old
[1:42:11] sticky cockapoo nature has a hard time
[1:42:13] with and that gives us a way to come
[1:42:15] back to god over and over and say god i
[1:42:18] by the promise you've given to me am a
[1:42:20] partaker of the divine nature but i'm
[1:42:22] having problems with temperance
[1:42:25] please god give me more temperance
[1:42:27] according to your word amen i need it to
[1:42:30] come natural
[1:42:33] amen
[1:42:34] i need it to come natural i need it to
[1:42:36] be a natural outflow of me because i
[1:42:38] can't always remember to count to ten
[1:42:41] and i can't always stop to take five
[1:42:43] deep breaths
[1:42:45] but i need a divine nature
[1:42:48] to come in
[1:42:49] and give me temperance
[1:42:51] and when i'm riled against i round not
[1:42:53] back
[1:42:54] that when somebody speaks evil
[1:42:57] i want to say something nice
[1:43:00] because i know the judgment of god is
[1:43:01] coming down the pike and i just want to
[1:43:04] do something to temper that
[1:43:07] i i by the knowledge god's given us
[1:43:10] by the faith in who we are by the
[1:43:13] strength that he's given us
[1:43:15] by by the knowledge in the word of what
[1:43:18] what we're here for and what's going on
[1:43:20] bring us into a temperance that no
[1:43:22] matter what happens around me and what
[1:43:24] people do to me i can recognize that
[1:43:27] it's not me that they're afflicting god
[1:43:31] because this is the vessel that god has
[1:43:33] chosen to manifest himself in he is
[1:43:35] building this into a living epistle a
[1:43:38] living tabernacle of a living god and
[1:43:40] then all of a sudden you can say oh
[1:43:42] don't do that
[1:43:45] god help them forgive them because you
[1:43:47] know that they're in big trouble amen
[1:43:50] not because of you because of god amen
[1:43:53] and so now we come to a different
[1:43:55] understanding of who we are and what
[1:43:58] we're here for and it brings us the
[1:44:00] knowledge this the the faith the virtue
[1:44:03] the knowledge brings us into temperance
[1:44:07] you know when brother branham said so
[1:44:08] many people are trying to get on the
[1:44:10] ladder up here and they fall and crack
[1:44:11] their head you've got to get on the
[1:44:13] bottom you've got to start off by
[1:44:14] knowing you're a son of god
[1:44:16] and then as the son of god he gives you
[1:44:17] strength to live and strength for others
[1:44:19] and then understanding and knowledge of
[1:44:21] the word and then brings you into
[1:44:22] temperance and the higher you go the
[1:44:24] more like jesus christ you look like
[1:44:27] you get somebody who has control over
[1:44:29] their emotions who doesn't get fly off
[1:44:31] the handle doesn't get upset doesn't
[1:44:34] fight back doesn't talk back doesn't
[1:44:36] talk about other people isn't sharp and
[1:44:38] isn't cutting you get somebody like that
[1:44:40] and you begin to see the reflection of
[1:44:42] jesus christ in their life
[1:44:45] because there's holy ghost temperance
[1:44:46] working there
[1:44:49] has anybody found a place to pray
[1:44:52] today
[1:44:55] i have
[1:44:57] in preparing this i'm like oh god i want
[1:44:59] a little more of that and i want a
[1:45:00] little more of that and i need a whole
[1:45:02] lot more of that
[1:45:03] i'm not going to tell you which one
[1:45:05] my wife already knows
[1:45:11] but you realize it's yours to
[1:45:14] have it's not a straining and a and
[1:45:17] struggling and a trying it's a
[1:45:19] recognizing and you know if we ask of
[1:45:22] our father bread will he not give us a
[1:45:24] stone
[1:45:25] if we ask him for meat will he give us a
[1:45:27] scorpion or a serpent amen if our if our
[1:45:30] earthly father knows how to give us good
[1:45:31] gifts how much more so our father in
[1:45:34] heaven gives the holy ghost to them that
[1:45:35] ask for what about those that are asking
[1:45:37] for his divine nature will he give it to
[1:45:39] you when you recognize lord i need some
[1:45:41] more this i find in myself it's still
[1:45:44] not reflecting you the way i want it to
[1:45:46] god would you come and give me more
[1:45:47] temperance lord would you give me more
[1:45:48] faith lord would you give me more virtue
[1:45:52] and he'll give it to you
[1:45:54] because by these promises you're a
[1:45:56] partaker of the divine nature
[1:45:58] so go as a partaker of the divine nature
[1:46:00] and partake of the divine nature say god
[1:46:02] i'm coming for more temperance i'm
[1:46:04] coming i need more because i'm here to
[1:46:07] reflect you
[1:46:09] i'm here for your purpose i'm here for
[1:46:11] your plan and i see a need and god i'm
[1:46:14] coming to the only source that can
[1:46:15] supply that need
[1:46:17] i could try harder and i will try harder
[1:46:19] but my try harder will fail
[1:46:22] i want to do better i want to try harder
[1:46:24] but no matter how much i want it'll fail
[1:46:27] what i need lord is for you to pour more
[1:46:30] of that holy ghost nature in me
[1:46:33] because above me is love
[1:46:36] god himself
[1:46:38] molding all of this into me
[1:46:41] all i got to do is look to a god who
[1:46:43] loved me first
[1:46:45] and in love go to a god who loved me
[1:46:48] and say god would your love give me more
[1:46:50] temperance
[1:46:52] what do you think he'll say
[1:46:55] do you think he'll refuse you
[1:46:57] no i think he'll honor that kind of
[1:46:59] prayer
[1:47:00] say god this is marring the image and i
[1:47:03] gotta reflect you
[1:47:05] come and help me
[1:47:06] god amen god bless you we're not going
[1:47:09] to go on we'll go on on wednesday i
[1:47:11] don't want to go any longer let's all
[1:47:13] stand musicians if you could come
[1:47:19] brother ben if you make it up
[1:47:21] let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:47:23] right here
[1:47:26] lord jesus we thank you father for your
[1:47:28] word
[1:47:30] god what would we do without this
[1:47:31] message
[1:47:33] there's so much calvinistic armenian
[1:47:35] confusion in the world
[1:47:37] we wouldn't know what to do
[1:47:39] we wouldn't know where to go
[1:47:41] we'd be fussing with one another and
[1:47:43] arguing about what way is right
[1:47:45] but oh god how you've painted a
[1:47:47] different picture for us
[1:47:49] you've sent the illumination through a
[1:47:51] prophet to illuminate this word to tie
[1:47:53] together the loose ends that were lost
[1:47:55] the church ages to bring us back to the
[1:47:57] right understanding of birth and
[1:47:59] adoption
[1:48:00] and god we're so thankful for eyes to
[1:48:02] see and ears to hear
[1:48:04] but god i don't want to know the
[1:48:06] doctrine
[1:48:08] i want it to become the reality in my
[1:48:09] life
[1:48:11] i'm so thankful that you give us
[1:48:13] understanding that we know lord what
[1:48:14] you're doing in our lives but i don't
[1:48:16] want just the understanding of what
[1:48:18] you're doing i want the evidence flowing
[1:48:20] through me
[1:48:21] i want that holy ghost faith
[1:48:24] and virtue and knowledge and temperance
[1:48:26] and patience and godliness and love i
[1:48:28] want it all flowing through me god so i

[1:48:34] vessel help me god to die to my own
[1:48:37] thinking and die to my own ways and die
[1:48:39] daily and let these virtues live in me
[1:48:42] for i know that without you it is
[1:48:44] impossible but i'm so thankful that you
[1:48:46] foreordained it lord and predestinated
[1:48:49] it for me
