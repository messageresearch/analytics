with us last night and all through this journey so many thoughtful things have been said kind acts have been done there's no way to uh remember all the things that uh you've done for the family and it's a testament to the lives that Jan has touched so we appreciate that and we'd like to open with a word of prayer if you'd wish to stand with us as we pray and honor him who gives us life Heavenly Father father we uh come Lord with heavy hearts but I pray father that you'll just help us to uh see uh the events of the day from your perspective and I pray father that you'll be with the proceedings the songs the worship the memories that are expressed today pray that you'll Comfort hearts and touch each one Lord It's been a blessing to the family and we just ask these things and we give you all the honor and praise and glory for it in Jesus name you may be seated I believe we have a song from uh Steve his boys my wife Rebecca [Music] the holy hills of Heaven call me to Mansions [Music] gr across the sea where of one's way and crowns are GI when the hills of Home start calling me this house of flesh is but a prison B ofone hold my soul but the doors of Cl are going to burst wide open when the angel said my spirit free and I'll take my fly like a mighty E when the hills of Home start calling me and I see loved ones oh Yonder tears are gone [Music] and hearts are free and from the throne My Savior beon and the hills of Home are calling me this house of fles is but a [Applause] prison B the bone oh my soul but the doors of clay are going to burst wide [Music] open when the angel says my spirit free and I'll take my flight like a mighty e go when the hills of Home start calling me when the hills of home start calling [Music] me I'm sure most of you know that it's been a tumultuous Journey uh for the family over the past year two months especially the last week or so was really um intense so um my wife and I we live 2 hours away from here so we would come up and spend several days try to help uh Sam with Jan and the family as they took care of her and uh just a constant uh state of care and need so my job was toh keep the children out from underfoot and I enjoyed that and so we were on the Monday that she passed uh the kids and I were staying at Paul and Alicia's House house so uh we had to drop some milk off for the family so we swung by the house at 10:00 and I told the kids says Grandma's not doing so well so you'll need to stay in the garage they said well we just want to stay in the car I said okay so I just turned the car off and ran in and just as I stepped in the house uh Jan was taking her last breaths and so I stood in there with the family that was gathered around and U as she uh took her final breath uh Amy said I'm not supposed to be getting emotional here Amy said something just uh almost under her breath said uh precious in your sight Lord she was uh quoting Psalms 116 where it says precious precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints and this seems like a strange verse but uh seems like just something clicked in me and I caught what that meant and I know it would not have been appropriate at that time to give a fist pump and a and a big uh yell Victory out but that's how I felt inside and got a little bit teer eyed and so I thought I'd just share that thought with you also in Ecclesiastes 7:1 it says uh says the day of one's death is better than the day of their birth and that's a rough interpretation there and in verse 8 says better is the end of a thing than the beginning and we don't understand that from the human perspective we uh but if we're Christians and we think this is God's word we've got to say Amen to it and we can say Lord I don't understand that it doesn't make sense because we look out on those poster boards we see the picture of Jan when she was just a baby brought home and some of you some of the family was there when that little lump of love and joy was was brought home we'd much rather be there than where we're at today but God's word says that this is a better day than that and to help us understand that I thank the Lord just give me a little Insight on that and you know as humans when we begin a project of whatever size it starts as a uh it's conceived in our mind and let's say if it's building a house and maybe we sit down at a restaurant and we scribble something out on the back of a napkin we show that to our spouse or whoever's involved in the project and then that project that conception has been taken back to the kitchen table and and we get the ruler and we we try to get our Our rough thought put down a little bit better and we go over it and finally Architects are got get involved and blueprints are drawn up and permits are are uh Acquired and contractors are lined up and every all this groundwork goes on and then we have a ceremony and family is invited and friends and we have a a groundbreaking ceremony and a shovel is shoved into the sod and turned over in a ceremony blueprints are displayed cookies and milk are passed around and there's a big celebration at the potential that we've got and people are trying to catch the vision they don't quite see it maybe we don't understand how this bare piece of ground here is going to turn out to look like what you've got in your mind but the master architect has got something in his mind and so as the family disperses and the excavators and the big equipment come in the concrete trucks the Saws and the Hammers the dust and the dirt and the mud and uh the work goes on working on that Vision that the master had in mind and uh there's disappoints disappointments along the way and setbacks and the weather and ordered material that never arrives and material that comes that's not the right color and and you know how these things are and and uh there's delays and discouragements along the road but finally the day of completion comes all the equipment's gone no more cement trucks no more big noise Vehicles no more saw dust and mud all those family and friends are invited back for an open house contractors neighbors so the the the end of this project is bigger than the beginning more people were involved and touched throughout the process and they come together for a celebration of the vision that the master architect had in mind and there's a ribbon cutting ceremony and again cookies and milk are passed around and people walk through the the house and now they can see the vision that the master architect had and that's what I think God had in mind and when Jan took her last breath it was like that was the ribbon cutting he was done he was satisfied all along the road you know those big trucks and stuff and digging the hole and pouring the concrete that was not the vision the goal of the architect but he wanted a dwelling place and Jan when she came home from the hospital as just as a child that was not the goal that the master had had in mind when she graduated from high school and nursing school that wasn't the goal he had in mind as a mother as a grandmother as a great-grandmother that was not the goal he had in mind but he kept working on it till he got it completed a feeble 75-year-old bedridden woman was not what he had in mind but a Dwelling Place he's working on the spirit and when he got it finished he took it home and I just rejoiced then and I want to Rejoice now we miss the process and like my six-year-old son he would rather have all the excavators running day and night for the rest of his life but that's not the ma that's not the Master's plan he had a goal in mind and he achieved it and I rejoice in that thank you [Music] is so sweet to trust in Jesus just to take him at his word just to rest upon the prise just to know thus sayth the Lord Jesus Jesus how I trust him how I Pro him more andore Jesus Jesus preious Jesus oh for Grace to trust him more oh how sweet to trust in Jesus just to trust his

and needs of her family before herself she sent her children off to school every morning after reading a chapter from the Bible over breakfast although she will be greatly missed her family is at peace with her in entering into her internal body and accepting the best birthday gift she could ever hope to receive thought this day would never come hoping it would never come never have to do this but just want to stand here on behalf of the family and read a few comments here from the sisters here um this one here is from Chris some words I have many great memories of writing bikes taking walks and having long conversations with mom in good times and in bad she was always there for me my mom had a great sense of humor we had so many laughs together among all my memories her Devotion to the Lord will always stand out to me our mom made sure we attended church every Wednesday night twice on Sundays she read the Bible to us and prayed with us every day rather than just telling me how to be a good person she modeled it for me my mom was not just an ordinary parent she was truly special to me she's my best friend friend confident Confidant uh she she was my role model she will always know she always knew how to make me feel better and was always there for me no matter what her love and support were unwavering and I will always be grateful for the amazing impact she had on my life I'm truly blessed to have such a special mom and then Amy uh wanted to add into here too um some time ago I asked Mom in her life what what brought her the joy and without hesitation her answer was motherhood she loved the years that she and Dad spent rearing as children I knew there had been good times and there were hard times in those years but no matter what was going on she she always faced that that sorry no matter what was going on what adver ad adversity she faced mom always put her needs above our needs above her own as always good Mothers do it was it wasn't just a physical needs that she took care of but she also nurtured us spiritually she prayed with us and read the Bible to us every morning before school even when we were running late teaching us the importance of a daily walk with the Lord mom's care for us the lessons she taught us her examples of perseverance and her constant love for us are the best Legacy she could have left with us and I'm so thankful for it and Mom was the uh everybody here knows it but the Wallflower in the room she was always the quiet lady that would sit with a smile and uh if you're watching the slideshow here you saw that almost every picture she was in a brown chair sitting in the corner and that was that was mom's place and we would come in and say hello to her and and uh give her a kiss on the forehead and we carry on our conversation she would sit there and listen to everything that was going on she would know my doctor's appointment she would know when I had to where we were going to go on vacation when it was going to be and I didn't think she would even know I'd come back in she goes isn't the 7eventh you're supposed to be going the yep that's exactly right in the middle of everything that was going on with her she would still remember those things but she was always always we were the center of her life and she did everything to just to just to pull us into to together as a family and that's a place for us it's going to be really hard um to have that that empty chair there at the house and and uh we're going to we're going to heal and and it's going to be good God's going to give us peace but you know right now it's just a little bit tough but um I did get a text from Bill herburger and uh this kind of when I was thinking about Mom just being that quiet Rock sitting there with a smile Bill text this this morning or last night I guess it was but he said I will never forget the times we spent with your parents at their house when I was a young Christian Aunt Jam was an encouragement to me as a young believer in Christ she was always so kind and pleasant to be around that type of Christlike character that's vitally important for new Believers and I thank the Lord for her life God bless you and give you strength and courage but that was exactly that was what I was just thinking on Mom that was just that that encouragement she always had it was quiet encouragement but she was able to just to just a smile and and and when you need need it she was there um when she was going through the last about 6 months it was kind of tough for her and uh I would remind her she would always felt like she was putting us out when we come over late at night to help her get to bed and she uh she really felt bad that it was uh causing us some grief but I would tell her uh one of the best memories I have was on the playground there at Columbus Grove School and I was hanging upside down on the monkey bars and I slipped fell off and landed in the gravel on my forehead got a bunch of stones in the forehead no joke they got a few left but they were digging those out and the doctor was trying to get me down I remember looking up mom had to come in and grab my shoulders and hold me down I remember looking up and he had a light that shining down I can see Mom and her eyes uh started getting tearing up and remember big tear drop on my cheek and U when I saw that I hated to see her cry and uh and uh so I was able to to guess man up and and take it after that but I was telling when we were trying to help her in the St stah study and move her around and things about how much it was a problem for us mom I that story remember that you were holding me down as much as you hated to do it but always taking care of us you know all those years and and here we get a chance and opportunity to be able to to return just a little bit of that to her it was it was a blessing for us who hated to see her go through it but to be able to help like that but uh and speaking of that Dad I want to say the absolute best caregiver I mean the last the last four or five years yeah he's been that's been his full time you know helping Mom and no I mean it was all of love not a duty not a sense of Duty but he helped her everything everywhere they went just I could talk on that but I said no this No No Cry it was good dad I love you just can't say enough that yeah that was good I will jump onto this right here lilacs you know Uncle Mike he did a super job right here this is just the embodiment here I mean seeing these flowers here mom's lilacs she was big lover lilacs the purple and Uncle Mike and Barb you guys stayed late there at Town and Country after the hours and it was closed and did such a marvelous job here but those lilacs meant a lot to Mom every house we went we always had a lilac bush and this last one we just put one in the back of the house for her and uh she loved the spring lilacs but it was unusual this year we were able to have a fall uh uh Bloom here on the lilacs and so Alicia you brought some over to Mom there just a few days before things really did a downturn but she she was able to respond able to hold that that BL that bloom there and smell it tell her tell you how much she loved it but uh Becky found a little article here but it says about why lilacs bloom again but it says um stressful growing conditions typically are the reason for an untimely Bloom occasionally lilacs will Bloom out of season during the fall months this out of season Bloom it's usually triggered by stressful environment conditions during the summer growing season hotter than normal temperatures drought conditions are large contributors to the phenomenon these spring blooming plants set their flower buds for the following year in early summer shortly before after the previous spring sorry spring blooms fade help me out here these spring blooming plants set their flower buds for the following year in early summer shortly after the previous spring blooms fade stressful conditions are the plant stressful conditions put the plant in a dormant likee State and when the cooler temperatures and shorter days of fall arrive some of the flower buds are triggered to bloom but I was just thinking that here the last about 6 months you know it's been extremely stressful for Mom but you know even in the stressful times and even in the last 6 months she's still growing you know and and uh and then we finally here on her birthday here back on the 25th she was able to to bloom again so that was wonderful but and I'm going to right here um just finishing up we've had all the family different ones that take part I'd like to get the grand great grand baby to come up Caleb could you bring her up they don't know this cuz I would want to stress them out but she's the only we've had Sons son-in-laws daughters Frank it was a very good slideshow that was very good appreciate it but I just want to want for come here come here how you doing just you love Grandma was Grandma very good say yes you know sorry I just take the tears away for a minute but CR when she was just a little bit older than this here she came out of the bedroom one time she said Dad she go I don't want to go to heaven and you you know when you hear that coming from your maybe three or four what you want to go to heaven she says I've got my room I've got my had a play set out back got a play set I've got my she's you know naming all the different things she has here and she's afraid that she goes to heaven she'll not you know have those Comforts and and I told her caressa not you but I told caressa you see that said that uh I said if I was to tell you you know when you were in mommy's belly when you were in the womb if I was to say you know hey come out here you've got your toys and your swing set and all these good things that you like you would have no idea what it was like or what you were going to be looking at you know and you could feel your mama's heartbeat and you could hear your mama's voice and you wouldn't want to leave that spot and told her I said the same thing I said now would you want to go back into the mommy's belt no I don't want to do that and I said the same thing when you get to heaven you know all of these things these Comforts of Life they go away you know it's just it's a greater it's more real than this here and that's what mom's getting to experience to ask her to come back even with the great grandkids like this she would never do it you know but that's it that's that's all mom I love you and looking forward to the reunion and I appreciate you everybody coming out Uncle Mike again flowers so beautiful family thank you so much you guys are a real Testament to to us to the hardworking elro family I'm telling you just love those good putham County Farmers you guys are wonderful appreciate you coming oh amen that was wonderful say God bless you all it's good to see you all out here and we're counted a privilege to be able to gather here like this to reflect and remember our sister Jan and uh each one of us are here had some part in some way we touched by her life had interaction with her some more than others some for longer than others but each one of us are here because we were in contact with a life and that life had an impact on each one of us I really appreciate the remarks from the family there and uh it was encouraging to me because it's so in line with the things that were on my heart to just share with you as we look to the word of God and reflect on what a life lived is all about um as brother Ron said uh right there in the beginning of the comments that he made he said precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints and precious means with great value or great weight are of great importance and for God it's it's something that's of Great Value and important to him amen and God doesn't mourn it the way we do for him he sees it as a graduation and for her for our sister Jan it was quite that way a graduation I'd like to read a scripture out of Philippians chapter 1 and uh verse 21 and this is from the Apostle Paul he says for to me for for to me to live as Christ and to die is gain the Apostle Paul was struggling with whether or not he should continue on in Life or go on to his reward and and he makes this following statement uh down in verse 23 he says for I in a straight betwix two having a desire to depart and to be with Christ Which is far better I love that phrase far better he said for I'm in a straight between two what what's the straight whether to stay and help you all or whether to go on but he acknowledged uh that uh but I have a desire to depart and be with Christ Which is far better nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you so that was Paul's struggle Paul's struggle was not whether to have this life or to have the next he knew exactly what he wanted he wanted to go on his struggle was either to remain and help you or to go on and I say our sister Jan I'm sure had the same struggle whether to stay with her family and be a mother and a grandmother and a wife or to go on but I'd say she would confess the same thing Paul confessed to be with Christ is far better and I'd say for sure that'd be your testimony if you could ask her now it's far better amen and for us we're happy for her we're thankful that she was able to move on to her reward and to her blessing once again and though she would have liked to have stayed and been a help to her family and to the Saints and to everyone else whom she loved I believe her work was done that she had done what God intended for her to do and she was rewarded at the end for her for her faithfulness second Timothy 4 the Apostle Paul writes in verse 6 for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love is appearing things Paul says I have finished my course and he say I have finished the course but I finished my course that course is a type of race but not a race is in a Sprint but like in a marathon a long race a long race that takes endurance and takes patience and takes time to complete and Paul knew that he had come to the end of of what God had given him to do he'd come to the end of his course and I believe we each have a course each of the children of God have a course a race a path in life that we must run and he in doing so he had kept the faith and he knew that there was a crown of righteous is laid up for him I thought it was amazing as we we began to realize that the day of sister Jan's birth also became the date of her departure I thought that was extra special gift that God gave to her and to the family she came into the world and she left the world on the same date 75 years apart because she had a course and that course was mapped out by God and God knew the day that that course would begin and he knew that the day that that would end and I I believe that sister Jen kept the faith I believe she fought a good fight and she ran her course and she kept the faith as I was thinking about our sister and looking into the word I I came across this thought that that really began to move me out of Matthew chapter 9:9 we all know really well that Jesus called his disciples to himself but it says in Matthew 9:9 and as Jesus passed forth from then he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receipt of customs and he said unto him follow me and he arose and he followed him we find this language many times in the gospel as he comes to different disciples again in John 1:43 he says the day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth Phillip and saith unto him follow me and it's amazing how Jesus was commanding them not to go somewhere not to do something he gave them one command and that command was follow me he wanted them to follow him and and when I reflect on what does it mean to follow Jesus and how would sister Jan follow Jesus and how would we follow Jesus we must realize that that these men what they saw is they saw a man in flesh they saw another human being and they could actually follow him and keep their eyes on the back of his head and go where he went but we know that Jesus is the word that was made flesh and to follow Jesus today as Jan did in her life would be to follow Jesus Christ the revealed word to follow the word of God because God is his word and the Word was made flesh and I believe that's what sister Jan did I believe she followed Jesus she followed him amen we know that just the statement follow me is a big statement because when he says follow me it shows that Jesus was an intent on being stationary he wasn't planning on being in a fixed position to be stationary and and constant and unmoving but God Jesus Christ God in flesh the word made flesh was on the move and because he was on the move he had to give this commandment don't stay here and don't stay there but follow me because if you want to stay where I am I'm moving and you have to follow me and we know that this word has been moving through generations through time as God unfolds himself himself and the children of God are getting the same command follow me Amen in in Matthew uh 16 verse 20 24 and verse 25 says then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it so here in another commandment from Jesus the disciples we find the message of Follow Me Goes a little deeper because in order to follow him if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me so to follow the lord doesn't is not a simple statement of I'll just walk the way Jesus walks and I'll follow him but there must be a self-denial attached to it and there must be a self- crucifixion there must be a death to self because we have to die many times to the way we view the world or the way we think should things should be or the way that we have taught things are and in order to follow him there must be a death to self and and then you can take up your cross and follow me for if we will save our life we'll lose it but if we'll lose our life we shall find it this is what our sister Jen was able to do this is the example that she left for all of us she was able to follow the lord in Romans 6:3 Paul says you know you not that so many of us as we baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin so but Paul's saying when we were baptized into Christ we were baptized unto our death we died we died so that we can come forth with a newness of life our life in Christ Jesus as we begin to follow him that self crucifixion and Jan made that transition she had to move in life from what was familiar to her and what she understood and what was traditional she had to make a move and she had to make a transition and and in doing so she had to die to self and when she would make that transition she would come to the revelation of the word for her day and she would recognize that the word is real the word is true the word is present tense and it's asking me to he's asking me to follow him and she did that and we know according to scripture that she was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ literally taking the name of Christ on her in baptism and to do that was a major death to self and and coming forth in newness of life as she followed him and sister Jan made that transition she died to to many things to come to follow Christ and in Matthew 4 Jesus says to his disciples for those who will follow him he says this and Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee saw two brothers Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were Fishers and he said unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men and they straightway left their Nets and followed him and going on from then he saw other two Brethren uh James the son of zebede and John's brother in a ship with Zebedee their father mening their Nets and he called them and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him amen this is what it was to deny yourself and take up your cross and follow they left every everything that was familiar to them they left their family business they left their father they left the Nets they left everything that had they had grown to know all of their lives they left it to do what to follow Jesus but he said I'll make you a promise if you follow me I'll make you Fishers of Men meaning if you'll follow me I'll make you to catch Souls you will win those to Christ if you follow me and that's the promise for those who will follow Jesus and we found that to be true for sister Jan very true for because she she in her family and her household she went first she heard the call she heard the word she recognized that God Amen had brought a further revelation of his word in this day and and that was Jesus Christ the word that was revealed and she heard his call she heard him calling for her to follow and she left Nets and she she left everything and and she followed him but because she followed him he says I I'll make you Fishers of Men and that's exactly what happened to our sister because shortly behind her came her husband Brother Sam was testifying to me and sharing the story again with me the other night that that what he saw in his wife affected him so much he wanted what she had it says in 1 Peter chapter 3 Peter says likewise you wives in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation that's lifestyle that's the life of the wives while they behold your chaste conversation that's your holy lifestyle coupled with fear that's reverence to God and that's what Brother Sam told me he saw he saw that in his wife he saw the change that had come over her he saw her chased conversation coupled with her reverence for God and had such an impact on on him that Jan got what Peter had had promised her and what Jesus had said if you follow me I'll make you Fishers of Men and her husband was caught and it's so amazing it wasn't because she preached him sermons and it and it wasn't because she forced him or she manipulating or made him feel bad all she had to do was follow Jesus and he said if you follow me I'll make you a fisher of men and that example had an impact amen uh the prophet of God says this he says listen so many people has got the wrong concept to convert people to Christianity and to a government is not God's thought at all said we made coners to Christianity by his government that's not it well they're not supposed to drink they're not supposed to lie do you know that muhammadans can outshine you further down he says now notice God makes himself known not we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by a government but by the Revelation the Christ in you as God was in Christ Christ as God was in Christ Christ in you then what God did in Christ Christ does in you what signs did God in Christ Christ does in you oh isn't that beautiful I mean we're not supposed to convert people because we bring them to a form or a structure or an order or a set of rules or a government of the church but what's actually supposed to bring people to Christ is Christ in us the life that we live becomes an attractant the life that we live becomes an attractant to the people amen and and then it brings them into a connection where they can follow Christ themselves now it's Christ in US becomes the attractant so that Christ can be in them and that becomes the conversion Amen in 2 Corinthians 3 the Apostle Paul says you are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ that means you're the letter of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the Spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart amen that's that's the promise to us that if we'll follow after him then we become the Epistles of Christ read of all men written in our hearts and that was sister Jan to us it's amazing how uh brother Steve described his mom as the Wallflower the one on the side but yet without a dominant personality and without any force or any gift of persuasion without that she was able to influence everybody around her what was it it was the Christ in her it was the light shining through her it was she followed Christ and now Christ was using her Amen to do what he promised to do to make her a fisher of men because it wasn't just her husband that she caught but it was her children too that influence went on beyond beyond her husband it went beyond that and it began to influence the children that God gave her amen and the prophet of God made this statement which I absolutely love he said everything thinks thinks about their mother you know I think mother the good true mother is the Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John mother mother gets them first that's the one who brings them up first is Mother amen and that's why my I was so encouraged when I heard the things that the family were saying about their mother because to them she was the Gospel she was a living gospel she was the word made manifest in her life and they saw it and they knew it was real and the reality of life and mother amen had great impact on her and I say that impact is continuing on not just in her children it influence her children and their children they saw her follow Christ amen they met Christ for themselves and then now they're giving that example to their children and now it's going to another generation we know God has no grandchildren each one must come to their own experience with Jesus Christ themselves and begin to follow him but it's the ones who who who who gave that example that lead us to Christ amen and then we meet him for ourselves and then we follow him and leave an example for somebody else to meet Christ and then they follow him and we see in the family that it's happening generationally as each generation has their own experience with Christ amen because that was her promise if you'll just follow me don't try to figure it out don't try to get smart don't be preachy don't just follow me and in following him she became the Fifth Gospel to her children in fact probably the one they read first before they could read their Bibles they could read the word in mom's life in John 15:16 Jesus speaking again to his disciples he says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and whatsoever you ask the father in my name he will give it you those that Jesus said to follow he told them I've ordained you I've called you you didn't find me I found you and I don't believe sister Jan found Christ I believe Christ found her came her way like he did to the disciples one day and says follow me and she was able to leave everything and follow him but in so doing he said I've ordained you and in my ordinance for you my ation for you is that you'll bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain when we think about sister Jan the thing that was remarkable what the family mentions and what we all remember is that she had the simple humble Life of Christ not extravagant I don't know that she ever preached I don't know that she ever stood up and gave a testimony not that I ever remember I don't know that she was ever dying dynamic in that way I don't know that she ever was testifying on the street I don't know but she was following the Lord and she had a Ministry and he made her Fishers of Men and those fish got caught and many of them are sitting right here and others who were influenced but he ordained that she would bring forth fruit and that that fruit should remain that it's not going to be lost but it'll be there on that day because that was her course that was her life that was her Ministry that was her work and following the Lord and that was her promise that she'll be a fisher of men and that she was going to bring forth fruit and she brought forth fruit and that that fruit shall remain because it was God's plan for her life it's amazing when you reflect on the impact that one life can have an eternal impact an everlasting impact not something that's trivial or foolish but something that can go on for the ages to come Jesus he's the one who said follow me he he's the one who led the disciples and he had fruit and his fruit would remain but he said this in a prayer in John 17 he said father I will that they also whom thou Hast given me be with me where I am what was jesus' desire that all that the father had given him will be with him where he is he was getting ready to depart the time of his departure was near he was leaving the Mortal realm and moving in back into the immortality and his desire was that all that God had given him would be with him where he was that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world I believe sister Jan's prayer was the same father of all that you've given me the fruit of my Ministry the promise of following after you I pray that they be with me where I am amen and where is she she's beyond the Gate of mortality she's beyond the time of journeying in this flesh she's moved on to an eternal inheritance kept in the heavens she's moved on to her theophany body she's in a body that cannot get sick she's in a body that cannot feel pain she's in a body amen that that that cannot suffer the way that she was suffering she's gone on to a reward and we thank God there's been a prophet in this generation that's went beyond the curtain of time and brought us back the report so we know exactly where she is and what she's enjoying and the blessings that she's walking in but I believe her prayer would be that where I am they may be also in John 13 Jesus says this John 13:36 Simon Peter said to him Lord whether goest thou Jesus had told him I have to leave I'm leaving and Peter wanted to be where he was Peter says no don't leave me he said I'm leaving whether goest thou Jesus answered him whether I go thou cast not follow me now but Thou shalt follow me afterwards Jesus had told his disciples follow me follow me and Peter wants to keep following him but there's a course for Peter to run there's a or there's a path for Peter that's ordained and fruit for Peter to bring forth but he says you cannot follow me now he didn't say you can't follow me he said you can't follow me now but in due time you'll follow me beyond the Gate of mortality Beyond fleshly life you'll move back into the Realms of immortality and we believe Peter was also able to follow one day amen 1 Corinthians 11 this is the last verse that I want to leave with you 1 Corinthians 11:1 be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ and I want to say that on behalf of sister Jan be followers of me even as I also am of Christ she heard his call when she said follow me she followed she dropped the Nets and left the boat and she followed and in so doing she became a written epistle that others read in her life and were influenced to give their lives to Christ her family and others and there was a time there was a place you couldn't follow him yet and that was into the realm of immortality you can't follow me here now Jan but you shall come later well she's followed him she's followed him Beyond mortality she's followed him into immortality she's went she was the first in her family to follow and she led the way now she's first to go through the gate called death into immortality she's went first the whole time Brother Sam she went first again but she went first because that's where she followed her Lord to remember but I know she would want all of you to follow to keep following her as she followed Christ to keep following Christ the word until you too can Step Beyond the Gate of mortality and immortality for some it'll be by the way of the Grave for some it'll be a change in the body but let's keep following Christ keep following this revealed word keep following after him amen until we too can follow from this life into the next life I would believe that would be a parting message for us to take away from Sister Jan's life that the impact of a life sometimes cannot be measured Moment by moment in the times that the families were gathering in the Simplicity of a meal or a holiday or a family function and the Simplicity of her just being there and being attentive and being encouraging reading a Bible verse or reading a scripture or saying something from the word and that moment by moment you might not be able to measure the impact of a life but when you stand back and you you gather it all up and the impact it had on everybody all the scriptures all the encouragement all the prayers the constancy of service after service Wednesday after Wednesday Sunday after Sunday and you wrap it all up together and the impact of her life is immeasurable it's Eternal because she followed him it was simple but it was profound it was not Dynamic it was simple but in it was subtle but in the simple subtlety eternity was taking place things of the most momentous the things of the the the greatest priority the most important things ever were transpiring Moment by moment hour by hour day by day visit by visit I don't know about you but I'm encouraged just to follow him not to worry about how I will or how this or how my love one how just follow him and become a written epistle because he promised he'll make a fishes of men and I want my life to reflect like sister Jans did that it had impact Moment by moment hour by hour day by day because I simply followed him and I too if I'm not present and not still in this mortality at the time of the change of the body at the Rapture of the church I too want to follow on to where Jan's gone I wanted to follow Christ beyond the Mortal realms into the immortal Realms amen God bless you at this time we're going to have a another special song if you guys want to make your way up at this [Music] time does J
