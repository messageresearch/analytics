[0:00] you are called as christians
[0:04] but you're also called to be the bride
[0:05] of jesus christ
[0:08] you were born a human being but now
[0:12] you're called to be sons and daughters
[0:13] of god
[0:15] it takes a huge change in our thinking
[0:17] oh yeah i'm just a sinner saved by grace
[0:19] in fact
[0:20] that's what bothered me when i was in
[0:21] the bath in in in the denominational
[0:23] system
[0:24] oh yeah you're a sinner saved by grace
[0:27] the emphasis was on i was a sinner i was
[0:30] always going to be a sinner i was always
[0:31] going to have mistakes i was always
[0:32] going to have problems i'm always going
[0:33] to trying to overcome
[0:35] but in this message i find that no i'm a
[0:36] son of god that has been fully restored
[0:38] to my rightful position with god
[0:40] but still it takes a huge chance for
[0:43] information in my thinking
[0:45] do i am i acting as a sinner side by
[0:47] grace or now am i
[0:48] able to act as a son of god am i able to
[0:50] actually get into the channel where god
[0:52] can speak through me and do the things
[0:54] through me that he's wanting to do
[0:55] because see that's what we are called to
[0:57] be we are at the
[0:59] end time the end time is no longer
[1:01] future we are there
[1:03] but see we have to begin we have to step
[1:06] into the office
[1:07] of being the bride of jesus christ we
[1:09] have to step into the office of being
[1:11] sons and daughters of god
[1:12] we have to be able to sit there and
[1:14] begin to realize this is what i
[1:16] am the bible says now are you the sons
[1:19] of god does not appear what you shall be
[1:21] but but when you shall see him you
[1:23] should just be him like he is
[1:25] that's now but you have to believe it
[1:29] [Applause]
[1:32] you have to believe this that's why god
[1:35] sent the prophet
[1:37] that one one minister i think anyway
[1:39] they they made mention of the fact you
[1:41] know during the church ages
[1:42] he was dealing with both vines when he
[1:45] gets to the to the last church age the
[1:47] lady is seeing church age no he was just
[1:49] dealing with a false one
[1:51] it took a prophet to this generation to
[1:53] tell the bride no you are not lukewarm
[1:55] no you are not reaching increasingly
[1:57] no what you are you are the son of god
[1:59] you are the pure
[2:01] pure virtuous sinless bride of jesus
[2:03] christ
[2:04] you are sinless in his sight and
[2:07] sometimes i wrestle with that one even
[2:10] but it has to it comes to the place in
[2:12] our thinking we have to be willing to
[2:14] step into that
[2:16] we have to be willing to get out of
[2:17] ourselves and quit relying upon ages and
[2:19] good relying upon our own thoughts and
[2:21] our own processes
[2:22] and our own intellect if you will and
[2:24] begin to come to
[2:25] come to grips with the fact no we are
[2:27] sons and daughters of god
[2:28] we have the authority of god because of
[2:30] who we represent
