[7:01] precious lord jesus we just want to
[7:04] pause here a moment lord to
[7:06] once again thank you for this
[7:09] opportunity together
[7:11] lord to come and to fulfill your
[7:13] scripture that we would not forsake our
[7:16] assembling ourselves together lord and
[7:18] even the more so as we see the end
[7:20] drawing now
[7:22] lord and we're so thankful once again
[7:25] that we can gather here
[7:28] knowing that we're not just socializing
[7:32] knowing that we're not just here because
[7:35] we think alike
[7:37] or maybe we would see some things in the
[7:39] scripture the same
[7:40] but lord that we've been able to come
[7:43] and together
[7:44] around a person the person of the word
[7:48] the lord jesus christ lord to come and
[7:51] together
[7:53] around truth as billions
[7:56] or at least millions would gather on
[7:59] what we would know as sunday or
[8:02] representing the sabbath day and
[8:05] they would gather and go to lodge's
[8:09] lord and they would have certain
[8:11] portions of the scripture that they
[8:13] would agree upon
[8:15] but yet they would deny other ones lord
[8:18] we're so grateful that you have come and
[8:21] that you have revealed
[8:23] all of yourself to us and that we've
[8:26] been able to receive all of you lord and
[8:28] that's who we gather around this morning
[8:31] we don't ever want to take that for
[8:33] granted lord we don't ever want to
[8:36] let it be common to us that we have
[8:39] truth to walk in
[8:41] lord we would just ask now that as we
[8:43] would come to this part of the service
[8:45] lord
[8:46] father we stand here and you know the
[8:49] hearts of each and every one
[8:52] lord there is no mortal man that can
[8:54] stand here
[8:55] and meet the needs of every person
[8:58] that's in this building lord
[9:00] even if there would just be one or two
[9:02] here lord it would be impossible for a
[9:04] man
[9:05] to meet the needs of another man lord
[9:07] you've got to come on the scene
[9:08] father you have got to come and break
[9:11] your word lord
[9:13] for we need you lord we just commit all
[9:15] things into your hands lord
[9:17] we love you we ask this in the name of
[9:19] the lord jesus christ
[9:21] amen god bless you if you'll turn in
[9:24] your bibles to revelation chapter 19.
[9:29] we'll uh have every intention of
[9:32] continuing on where we left off a couple
[9:34] sundays ago
[9:36] with the preamble to the marriage
[9:40] and i'll have to apologize for how long
[9:43] i kept you last time i
[9:45] certainly did not intend to keep you two
[9:48] hours so i apologize for that i
[9:52] really intended three or four so
[9:55] i'll try to do better
[10:00] but the lord knows it's
[10:04] you would just have to i guess be in
[10:06] this position to understand but
[10:08] every time i walk out here you know i
[10:10] look at my notes and i
[10:11] think about the thought that they've
[10:13] given me and
[10:14] you're like okay well yeah 30 45 minutes
[10:18] and we'll be done here and
[10:20] i'm not sure what happens but then i
[10:22] look over at my timer
[10:23] and it's two hours and i haven't got
[10:26] anywhere so
[10:27] i'm not sure how that works i'm not sure
[10:30] if it's a good thing or a bad thing but
[10:32] it is a thing
[10:33] and it's true and it's it is what it is
[10:36] so we just want to commit ourselves to
[10:38] him and we want to
[10:40] go as slow as he wants us to go and we
[10:41] want to go as fast as he wants us to go
[10:45] and you all control a lot of that so
[10:48] really the blame is on you so you can't
[10:50] blame me
[10:51] but god bless you this morning it's sure
[10:53] good to be with you
[10:54] we'll look here at revelation chapter 19
[10:57] and verse 7
[10:58] and then i'll let you have your seats
[11:01] says
[11:02] let us be glad and rejoice
[11:05] and give honor to him for the marriage
[11:08] of the lamb has come
[11:10] and his wife hath made herself ready
[11:13] god bless you as you would be seated
[11:16] i'm just going to read this
[11:20] uh excerpt of this story out of the
[11:22] choosing of the bride that we're really
[11:24] basing
[11:26] this inspirational and this this topic
[11:29] one
[11:30] obviously it's a very familiar story
[11:32] very familiar
[11:34] uh parable that brother branham lays
[11:36] down here but just for the sake of maybe
[11:38] somebody that would be here that's not
[11:39] familiar will just
[11:42] review this very quickly in 1965
[11:46] choosing of the bride and
[11:47] we want to remember the context that's
[11:50] because it's
[11:50] crucial to remember the context that
[11:54] brother branham is preaching this under
[11:56] he's standing on the west coast he's
[11:58] standing in the los angeles
[12:00] at the at the tail end of his ministry
[12:04] and he's standing there and he's pulling
[12:07] out the scripture of elegies are going
[12:09] to call out a bride
[12:10] he's pulling out the scripture of the
[12:11] seventh vile angel
[12:13] uh pouring out the seventh vial and
[12:17] he's literally as he's preaching this
[12:19] sermon
[12:20] he's literally fleshing these scriptures
[12:23] out
[12:24] because he's literally the instrument
[12:26] that god used as
[12:27] eleazar to go into call out abroad and
[12:29] he's literally the seventh vile angel
[12:31] standing there
[12:32] and he's getting ready at the end of
[12:34] this service to spiritually
[12:36] through his vocal cords pour out the
[12:38] seventh vial on the west coast
[12:41] so as i said before it's you know it's
[12:44] not that all the messages aren't
[12:46] important but there's just some of them
[12:48] that are at a crossroads
[12:49] there's some of them that are a juncture
[12:51] in time and a dispensational change
[12:54] and a literal literal
[12:58] fulfillment of the scripture so we want
[13:00] to
[13:01] we want to understand the context
[13:04] that this is under when brother branham
[13:06] just tells this story
[13:10] it's ex he's he's not just telling the
[13:13] story
[13:14] there's something crucial and critical
[13:16] that he's trying to lay out
[13:18] in simplicity but he says starting in
[13:22] paragraph
[13:23] 85 and i'm going to paraphrase some of
[13:25] this he says i've married
[13:27] many couples but it always reminds me of
[13:30] christ and his bride
[13:33] one of the weddings that i performed
[13:34] here some time ago was quite an
[13:36] outstanding thing in my life it's been
[13:38] several years ago when i was just a
[13:40] young minister
[13:42] my brother was what was working on the
[13:44] pwa
[13:45] and there was a boy that worked up there
[13:47] with him from indianapolis
[13:49] he said to my brother one day i want to
[13:51] get married
[13:52] if i just had enough money to pay the
[13:54] preacher
[13:56] doc said well my brother is a preacher
[13:58] and he may marry you
[13:59] he said he never charges people for
[14:01] things like that
[14:02] well that night my brother asked me and
[14:04] i said if he's never been married before
[14:06] either one of them
[14:07] and everything is all right so
[14:10] when saturday came along and the boy
[14:13] came down
[14:14] it's been a great thing for me to always
[14:17] look back upon this
[14:19] a rainy afternoon an old chevrolet car
[14:21] with the headlights wired on with
[14:23] belling wire
[14:24] that drove up and out got a boy
[14:27] he certainly did not look like a groom
[14:30] to me
[14:30] or would do anybody he had on a pair of
[14:32] shoes looked like they was run over
[14:35] his trousers was real baggy he had on
[14:37] one of these old moleskin jackets looked
[14:39] like he had been run through a washing
[14:41] machine without being rinsed
[14:43] and a little lady got out with a little
[14:45] checkered dress
[14:46] and she didn't have hardly any shoes on
[14:48] she had hitchhiked from indianapolis
[14:51] had a little hair and long kind of
[14:53] plaits down her back looked very young
[14:56] and i said to you said to her are you
[14:59] old enough to get married
[15:01] she said yes sir said i have my written
[15:04] permission from my father and mother
[15:06] i had to show it to the court here to
[15:08] get my license
[15:10] i said i'd like to talk to you for a
[15:12] little bit before we perform this
[15:13] wedding
[15:14] and they sat down the boy kept looking
[15:16] around the room he needed a haircut real
[15:18] bad
[15:20] he wasn't listening to me i said son i
[15:23] want you to listen to what i'm saying he
[15:26] said yes sir
[15:27] and i said do you love this girl he said
[15:30] yes sir i do
[15:31] and i said to her do you love him
[15:35] yes sir i do i said to the boy now have
[15:38] you got a place to take
[15:40] her after you marry said yes sir i do
[15:44] said all right said now i want to ask
[15:46] you something i understand you're
[15:47] working up here on the pwa
[15:50] and he said yes that's about 12 a week
[15:53] i said you think you can make a living
[15:55] for her he said i'll do
[15:57] all that i can do and i said well that's
[16:00] all right
[16:01] and i said now what if he gets out of
[16:02] work what if he loses his job sister
[16:04] what are you going to do
[16:06] you going to run back home to mama and
[16:07] papa she said no sir i'm going to stay
[16:10] right with him
[16:11] and i said what sir if you have three or
[16:14] four children
[16:15] nothing to feed them and you haven't got
[16:17] any work what are you going to do are
[16:18] you going to send her away
[16:20] said no sir i'll struggle right on we'll
[16:24] make it somehow
[16:26] brother brandon says i felt real little
[16:29] and i
[16:29] seen that he really loved her and that
[16:32] they loved one another
[16:34] and i married them so
[16:37] obviously we're most of us are very
[16:40] familiar
[16:41] with that story but again remember the
[16:44] context that he's dropping this under
[16:46] this is the this is the same context and
[16:49] the same way
[16:50] he'll come to the first seal and he's
[16:52] you know everybody's setting an
[16:54] anticipation
[16:55] waiting for him to break the seal break
[16:57] the seal read the scripture break the
[16:58] seal
[16:58] and he says me and brother vale was
[17:00] talking the other day about these guns
[17:04] you know if it gets off a little back
[17:05] here when it gets all the way out here
[17:07] at a thousand yards it's clear off the
[17:08] target
[17:10] he just broke the seal and everybody's
[17:12] wanting him to break the seal
[17:14] he's here preaching choosing of a bride
[17:15] they're wanting him to preach choosing
[17:17] a bride he's already preached choosing
[17:18] another bride
[17:20] and that's how simple that we can miss
[17:22] it that's how
[17:24] simple it is that a fool would not err
[17:27] therein
[17:28] if we will just understand the context
[17:30] that he's delivering this in
[17:32] and the simplicity that he brings this
[17:34] in
[17:35] will catch you so obviously we picked up
[17:38] these questions
[17:39] that brother branham was asking this
[17:41] couple and that's what drew my attention
[17:43] to the situation because every time that
[17:44] brother branham tells this story
[17:46] he's got the same questions in here that
[17:48] never deviates
[17:49] and there's a significance to that
[17:51] because we know what he's doing
[17:53] is this is the pattern and these are the
[17:55] principles
[17:56] for a true and proper marriage for a
[17:59] true and proper
[18:00] engagement that leads into a marriage
[18:02] and
[18:03] that that marriage would stand and that
[18:04] there would not be
[18:06] anything that would undermine that so
[18:10] this is the pattern that will work
[18:14] both naturally and spiritually
[18:17] so we want to understand that that way
[18:20] we don't come to the end
[18:22] of our road here thinking we're married
[18:26] but yet we deviated away from the
[18:27] pattern and
[18:29] maybe we were in a relationship maybe we
[18:31] were even engaged maybe we were even a
[18:33] spouse but we weren't
[18:34] actually in a marriage and remember the
[18:36] point of the marriage
[18:38] is to reproduce the son of man again
[18:42] and if you're unfamiliar with that
[18:44] terminology don't get nervous about that
[18:46] to reproduce the son of man again is to
[18:48] simply reproduce
[18:49] all of the word in flesh that's that's
[18:52] the definition of the fullness of the
[18:54] son of man
[18:55] all of the word in flesh and we know
[18:58] collectively as a bride that we have to
[19:00] be able to do that
[19:04] so just a very quick review he spoke to
[19:06] this lady
[19:08] and asked her are you old enough to get
[19:10] married she said she was
[19:12] produced her written permission said
[19:14] that you know i had to show that to the
[19:16] court in order to be married
[19:19] and we typed that to our written
[19:22] permission in the word we don't want to
[19:26] go off of feelings and we don't want to
[19:28] go off of
[19:29] think so's but we understand that acts 2
[19:32] 38
[19:32] gives the prerequisites to the marriage
[19:35] and acts 2 38 says you have to repent
[19:37] and you have to be baptized in the name
[19:39] of the lord jesus christ
[19:41] in order to move into a marriage with
[19:42] him in order for him to give you his
[19:44] spirit to give you his name you have to
[19:46] take those first two steps
[19:47] it's not optional it has to be there
[19:51] so that's obviously just a very simple
[19:54] thing
[19:54] but you know it's it's true and there's
[19:58] a lot of people that would
[19:59] that will overlook that and say well god
[20:00] knows what's in my heart you're right he
[20:02] does
[20:03] and if he lays in his scripture that you
[20:05] have to be baptized in the name of the
[20:06] lord jesus christ and you don't then he
[20:08] knows what's in your heart
[20:10] that's a problem so i won't dispute that
[20:12] he looks upon your heart
[20:13] and the water is not going to save you
[20:16] but it's an outward expression of an
[20:17] inward work and it's a confession before
[20:19] the people
[20:20] that you have taken his name therefore
[20:22] when you go out and you act like the
[20:24] world
[20:24] after you said that you've taken his
[20:26] name there's church discipline for that
[20:29] so there's a purpose and a reason behind
[20:32] that and he says if you love me you'll
[20:33] keep my commandments
[20:34] so even if you even if you disagree with
[20:38] it if you can see
[20:39] in the word that it is one of his
[20:40] commandments you still have to line up
[20:42] to it
[20:43] so there's no wiggle room around that
[20:44] there's no way to move forward with god
[20:47] without
[20:48] obeying what his word says to do and
[20:51] that is your written permission
[20:52] because if you have truly repented and
[20:54] you have truly been baptized
[20:56] in the name of the lord jesus christ god
[20:58] is obligated brother branham said
[21:01] he is obligated to give you the gift of
[21:04] the holy spirit
[21:05] it's not optional because if he didn't
[21:07] he would be a liar
[21:08] and we all know that god is not a liar
[21:10] so that is your written permission
[21:12] that you can give to the minister when
[21:14] he asks you are you old enough to be
[21:15] married
[21:16] are you spiritually mature enough to be
[21:19] married
[21:21] yes i have my written permission i have
[21:24] repented
[21:25] and i've been baptized in his name we
[21:27] can move forward with this
[21:32] he asked the man he says do you love
[21:33] this girl
[21:35] obviously that's a huge
[21:40] huge issue because if he doesn't love
[21:42] this girl obviously we're not moving
[21:44] forward but
[21:47] we took that into the spiritual realm
[21:50] and we
[21:50] we realized that brother branham told us
[21:53] about god's love and he says it's not as
[21:56] a
[21:57] parent who would just protect their
[21:59] child and hover over their child
[22:01] and not let anything bad happen to them
[22:03] while that's good
[22:04] he says that's not god's love he says
[22:07] god's love is much
[22:08] deeper than that god's love is elective
[22:10] love his love is expressed through
[22:12] election and predestination
[22:16] so we want to drive that stake down
[22:19] first and have a proper understanding
[22:21] of god's love because if not we're just
[22:23] going to be second guessing our entire
[22:25] walk
[22:26] you have to settle that first peter says
[22:28] you have to make your calling
[22:29] and your election sure so if you don't
[22:32] settle the fact that god
[22:33] loves me simply because he chose me
[22:38] then the rest of the marriage is just
[22:39] going to be in shambles
[22:41] just the same as in natural if that lady
[22:44] doesn't understand that this man loves
[22:47] me if
[22:48] nothing else if he messes up every day
[22:50] and does everything else wrong
[22:52] if every external indicator tells me he
[22:55] doesn't love me he still loves me
[22:57] because he's told me he loves me
[23:00] and it's that simple we have to
[23:01] understand that god
[23:03] does love us god has chosen us because
[23:05] he's told us that
[23:07] and he's told us that how did brother
[23:10] reno say
[23:11] because he brought his word our way
[23:15] it's really that simple saints it really
[23:18] really
[23:18] is of all the billions of people on the
[23:21] earth
[23:23] think of the small minority that's even
[23:25] had a chance to hear what you've heard
[23:27] let alone have the capacity to truly
[23:31] receive it
[23:32] that is not a coincidence don't make it
[23:35] more complicated than what it has to be
[23:38] remember he's choosing a bride
[23:43] he's choosing the bride so if he's
[23:46] chose you allow it to be so allowed the
[23:49] indications to be so
[23:51] if he's chose you he's got to come and
[23:52] tell you he's chose you
[23:54] that's why you have the capacity to
[23:56] receive it
[23:57] so we want to drive that nail down and
[23:59] have a good
[24:00] clear proper understanding of that
[24:04] and then we moved to the lady brother
[24:05] branham obviously asked her do you love
[24:07] him
[24:08] and we obviously brought this out in the
[24:10] church age book in the same
[24:12] the same portion brother branham says we
[24:14] prove our love to him
[24:16] by simply believing what he said
[24:19] and conducting ourself with joy amongst
[24:22] the trials that he sees fit to bring our
[24:24] way
[24:26] so we understand that he loves us but
[24:29] then there's the reciprocating
[24:31] outward expression for us that we can
[24:34] prove our love back to him
[24:37] if there was anything else that we could
[24:40] do
[24:40] to prove our love to him do you
[24:43] not think eliezer would have told us
[24:48] because remember that's his job
[24:52] eliezer's job is to go get rebecca make
[24:55] sure she loves isaac
[24:56] and then bring her bring her to isaac
[25:00] if ellie easier thought
[25:03] that rebecca could have done
[25:07] anything else to prove her love to isaac
[25:13] remember isaac's daddy is the one that
[25:15] hired him
[25:16] so if he brings this girl back and isaac
[25:18] is not happy daddy's not going to be
[25:20] happy he's out of a job
[25:22] so if there's anything else that he can
[25:26] do
[25:26] or instruct rebecca to do to prove her
[25:30] love to isaac
[25:31] would he be most foolish
[25:34] not to tell her
[25:38] so when he comes and the only thing that
[25:40] he tells us is to prove your love to him
[25:43] is believe what he said and conduct
[25:46] yourself with joy amongst the trials
[25:47] that he
[25:47] sees fit to bring your way and he
[25:50] doesn't say anything else to prove your
[25:52] love to him
[25:54] that's how simple it is he would be most
[25:57] foolish if there was a works program you
[26:00] could get into to prove your love to him
[26:02] and he didn't tell you about it
[26:04] guess what when he comes back he's going
[26:05] to get fired
[26:08] and he's not going to take that risk
[26:10] he's not going to do that
[26:12] he's going to make sure that the proper
[26:15] instruction is given
[26:17] so when when he brings that and it's in
[26:21] such simplicity and it's just so
[26:24] as we would say so simple why
[26:28] make it more than what he said it was
[26:31] why not just rest
[26:34] in the simplicity that he says
[26:39] believe what he said and conduct
[26:41] yourself with joy
[26:42] amongst the trials that he sees fit to
[26:44] bring your way
[26:46] it's really that simple that's how we
[26:48] prove our love to him
[26:50] per the prophet he moves back to the
[26:53] gentleman
[26:54] asked her do you have a place to take
[26:56] her after you marry
[26:57] he says yes i do he never told him it
[26:59] was a boxcar
[27:02] brother branham didn't ask it wasn't
[27:05] important what it was
[27:06] he just says do you have a place because
[27:09] he wasn't going to go out and do an
[27:10] inspection on the place
[27:12] the point was he just had a place
[27:18] so he did have a place he said yes i do
[27:21] and they moved on to the next step
[27:24] obviously
[27:25] we know that christ has a place for us
[27:28] he says
[27:29] if i leave you i will come again and get
[27:31] you again
[27:32] because i'm going to prepare a place for
[27:34] you
[27:35] we know in revelation chapter 5 that he
[27:37] opened the door to that place for us
[27:39] into heavenly places so he did have a
[27:42] place
[27:43] he prepared that place and he took us
[27:46] to that place revelation chapter 4
[27:50] he tells his bride to come up hither
[27:54] if he's going to tell her to come
[27:56] somewhere that obviously means he has
[27:57] somewhere for her
[27:59] he has somewhere he's wanting her to go
[28:02] so that'll finish our review portion if
[28:05] you want any more than that you can go
[28:06] back and
[28:07] listen to it yourself we're going to
[28:08] move forward here
[28:10] into this next question that he asked
[28:14] brother brown says i said all right
[28:18] now i said i want to ask you something
[28:21] i understand you're working up here on
[28:23] the pwa
[28:24] and he said yes sir says that's about 12
[28:27] a week said do you think you can make a
[28:30] living for her now remember he's already
[28:32] asked her do you have some place to take
[28:34] her
[28:34] he answered yes but now he says can you
[28:37] make a living for her
[28:40] he says i'll do all that i can twelve
[28:43] dollars a week i'll do
[28:44] all that i can brother brandon says well
[28:47] that's all right twelve dollars a week
[28:52] twelve dollars a week
[28:55] brother brandon says that's all right
[28:58] why
[28:58] why did he say that's all right he
[29:00] wasn't worried about the numerical
[29:02] figure
[29:06] he wasn't worried about the dollar
[29:07] figure he was worried about what the man
[29:10] said he says
[29:11] i will do all that i can
[29:16] that was the that was the important part
[29:19] do you think you can make a living for
[29:21] her he said i'll do all that i can
[29:25] john 6 53 says then jesus said unto them
[29:31] now we have to remember he's already
[29:32] said he's got a place for them but now
[29:34] this is about a living
[29:36] making and living for her what is the
[29:37] living he has to feed her
[29:39] and he has to clothe her right
[29:42] i mean we all learned that in school the
[29:44] three elements of survival
[29:46] food uh shelter and clothing right
[29:49] i mean we have food water and clothing
[29:51] we have to have those three elements
[29:54] so he's got he's got the shelter for her
[29:56] but is he going to be able to feed her
[29:58] and is he going to be able to clothe her
[30:01] john 6 53
[30:02] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[30:05] i say unto you
[30:07] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[30:08] man and drink his blood you have no life
[30:10] in you
[30:12] whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh
[30:14] my blood hath eternal life
[30:16] and i will raise him up at the last day
[30:18] for my flesh
[30:19] is me indeed and my blood is drink
[30:22] indeed
[30:23] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[30:25] blood dwelleth in me
[30:26] and i in him as the living father has
[30:29] sent me and i live by the father
[30:31] so he that eateth me even he shall live
[30:34] by me
[30:36] this is that bread which came down from
[30:39] heaven
[30:40] not as your fathers did eat manna and
[30:43] are dead
[30:45] he that eateth of this bread shall live
[30:47] forever
[30:49] so obviously we're looking that at the
[30:50] natural typing it to the spiritual
[30:52] this gentleman tells brother man i make
[30:54] 12 dollars a week i will do all that i
[30:56] can to feed her and clothe her
[30:58] christ comes on the scene and he says i
[31:02] am the bread that came down from heaven
[31:05] why does he need to tell them his bride
[31:08] that he
[31:08] is the bread that came down from heaven
[31:10] because he knows this principle
[31:13] and he's looking to move into a marriage
[31:16] he's already told him i'm
[31:18] going to prepare a place for you i will
[31:20] go i will prepare a place for you i will
[31:22] come again and gets
[31:22] you and gets you but in that meantime he
[31:26] still has to feed her and he still has
[31:27] to clothe her
[31:29] and christ knows these principles for a
[31:31] true marriage
[31:32] and he says my my flesh is meat indeed
[31:36] my blood is drink indeed and if you will
[31:39] eat of my flesh and drink of my blood
[31:41] you shall have life he that eateth of
[31:44] this bread
[31:45] shall live forever it sounds like to me
[31:48] he's meeting the requirement
[31:51] revelation 10 verse 8 says and the voice
[31:55] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[31:57] again and said
[31:58] go and take the little book which is
[32:01] open in the hand of the angel with
[32:02] standeth upon the sea and upon the earth
[32:05] and i went into the angel and said unto
[32:06] him give me the little book
[32:08] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[32:11] up
[32:12] why didn't he tell him to take it and
[32:14] stand on it
[32:18] because that's not his responsibility
[32:19] his responsibility is to feed his bride
[32:22] and to clothe his bride take it
[32:25] eat it up and it will shell it shall
[32:27] make thy belly bitter
[32:29] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[32:31] hunting
[32:32] 1965 the anointed one at the end time
[32:34] brother branham said
[32:36] it wasn't the angel his message
[32:39] it was the mystery that god unfolded
[32:42] it's
[32:42] not a man it's god
[32:46] the angel was not the son of man he was
[32:48] the messenger from the son of man
[32:50] the son of man is christ he is the one
[32:53] that you're feeding
[32:54] on you're not feeding on a man
[32:57] a man his words will fail but you're
[33:00] feeding on the unfailing
[33:02] body word of the son of man very
[33:05] familiar quote
[33:06] but why is he drawing attention to this
[33:08] why is he laying this down
[33:09] why is it so important that we recognize
[33:11] what we're eating
[33:13] because this is a requirement that god
[33:16] himself has laid out for a proper
[33:17] marriage
[33:18] i must feed this lady i must clothe this
[33:21] lady
[33:22] can i make a living for her
[33:25] it sounds like to me he can make a
[33:27] living for us
[33:28] it sounds like to me that he has
[33:30] provided food for us
[33:32] isaiah 61 verse 10 says i will greatly
[33:36] rejoice in the lord my soul shall be
[33:38] joyful in my god for he hath clothed me
[33:41] with the garments of salvation he hath
[33:44] covered me with the robe of
[33:45] righteousness
[33:46] as a bridegroom decath himself with
[33:48] ornaments and as a bride adorneth
[33:50] herself with jewels
[33:53] revelation 19 verse 7 we just read let
[33:56] us be glad and rejoice
[33:58] and give honor to him for the marriage
[33:59] of the land has come
[34:01] and his wife has made herself ready and
[34:04] to her was granted that she should be
[34:06] arrayed in fine linen
[34:07] clean and white for the fine linen is
[34:10] the righteousness of saints
[34:12] why is there so many references to
[34:14] feeding
[34:15] and clothing go search the scriptures
[34:18] why is it always about i've got a place
[34:20] for you here's food
[34:22] here's clothing
[34:25] because the whole picture is the
[34:28] marriage
[34:30] and god knows the principles to the
[34:33] proper marriage
[34:35] that's why it's always talking about
[34:38] i've got a place for you
[34:39] come through an open door i will clothe
[34:43] you with my word i will clothe you in
[34:45] righteousness
[34:46] eat the book
[34:49] see it's all of these small things
[34:52] pointing to the bigger picture
[34:55] it's all of the small things pointing to
[34:58] the whole picture
[34:59] which is the marriage
[35:02] verse 13 and he was clothed
[35:06] with a vesture dipped in blood and his
[35:08] name is called the word of god
[35:09] and the armies which were in heaven
[35:12] followed him upon white horses
[35:14] clothed clothed in fine linen
[35:19] white and clean revelation 21 verse 1
[35:23] says and i saw a new heaven and a new
[35:25] earth
[35:25] for the first heaven and the first earth
[35:27] were passed away and there was no more
[35:29] sea
[35:30] and i john saw the holy city new
[35:32] jerusalem coming down from god out of
[35:34] heaven
[35:35] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[35:38] husband
[35:41] sounds like she's clothed to me sounds
[35:43] like she's been fed to me
[35:45] sounds like he has met his end of the
[35:48] deal
[35:48] even at twelve dollars a week present
[35:52] sage of my ministry brother branham says
[35:53] i
[35:54] hope he will crown my ministry of this
[35:58] of letting me take the cloth of the word
[36:01] and dress his bride in the cloth of the
[36:04] word
[36:06] for his righteousness and i hope he will
[36:09] crown me let me stand on that they say
[36:12] behold the lamb of god that takes away
[36:16] the sin of the world why is this
[36:18] prophet's
[36:19] request of all things that he
[36:23] he could request why would his request
[36:25] be to take the cloth
[36:27] of the word and to clothe the bride
[36:30] because he knows the principles
[36:32] he knows what it's all about he knows
[36:35] this is about a marriage and he knows
[36:39] that the obligation that god has to his
[36:42] spiritual right is the same that a man
[36:44] has to his natural bride
[36:45] he's got to feed her he's got to clothe
[36:49] her
[36:50] why would eliezer want to do anything
[36:52] else
[36:54] why would he want to do anything else
[36:56] this is what god wants to do
[36:58] this is what god has to do and if he
[37:00] wants to be about
[37:01] god's business he knows that he has to
[37:04] do what god
[37:04] wants done which is to meet his
[37:06] principles which is to meet his
[37:08] requirements
[37:08] to feed her and to clothe her
[37:12] he cares do you care 1963.
[37:16] listen to this statement jesus cared
[37:19] enough
[37:19] for the message of today to bring these
[37:23] same things to pass as he said till he
[37:25] died
[37:27] and rose again to send them by the holy
[37:30] spirit
[37:34] i'm going to read it again jesus cared
[37:37] enough for the message of today
[37:43] to bring these same things to pass as
[37:46] he said till he died and
[37:49] rose again to send them by the holy
[37:52] spirit
[37:55] well i thought he just died on calvary
[37:56] for my sins he did
[38:00] well i accept calvary i accept god i'm a
[38:02] christian
[38:04] the prophet of god said jesus died
[38:08] on calvary for this message
[38:13] so if you try to tell me that you can
[38:15] set this message aside but yet still
[38:17] accept calvary
[38:19] it doesn't line up he says
[38:23] he he cared so much for this message
[38:26] to bring this message that he died
[38:31] and rose again to send them by the holy
[38:33] spirit
[38:34] you can't accept one without accepting
[38:36] the other saints it is impossible
[38:41] his ministry today that he's still alive
[38:43] he cared enough
[38:45] won't we care that's the thing won't we
[38:48] care
[38:49] he died for this ministry
[38:54] so if you reject this ministry
[38:58] what have you rejected you've rejected
[39:00] his death
[39:02] and there is no way that he can feed you
[39:05] and clothe you and prepare a place for
[39:07] you
[39:10] that's remember what we're talking about
[39:12] what did brother branham ask this
[39:14] guy can you make a living for her
[39:17] and what was his response at twelve
[39:18] dollars a week
[39:20] living going to take her to live in a
[39:22] boxcar
[39:26] his response was i'll do all that i can
[39:28] do
[39:31] is that not the same response christ has
[39:34] had
[39:36] i will do all that i can do to the point
[39:39] i will give
[39:40] my life for this ministry so that they
[39:43] can be properly clothed out of a
[39:46] laodicean condition out of a low see
[39:48] later with cnh that i can clothe them
[39:51] properly at that time
[39:52] and all the darkness and nakedness of
[39:55] the world
[39:56] i will still do all that i can do i will
[39:59] die 2 000 years ago i will literally
[40:03] give my life
[40:04] i will die so that they can have truth
[40:06] to be clothed in 2000 years from now
[40:11] this this man
[40:14] who was in real bad need of a haircut
[40:18] answered the prophet the same way christ
[40:20] himself would answer the prophet
[40:23] i will do all that i can do
[40:29] he turns to the sister he says
[40:33] what if he gets out of a job sis what if
[40:35] he loses his job
[40:37] what are you going to do are you going
[40:40] to run
[40:40] back up home to mama to papa she said no
[40:44] sir
[40:45] i'm going to stay with him
[40:48] what if he loses his job what if it
[40:50] looks like he's not going to be able to
[40:52] take care of you what are you going to
[40:53] do
[40:54] think spiritually saints don't get lost
[40:57] in the natural
[40:58] the natural is important yes if your
[41:00] husband gets out of a job and you run
[41:02] back to mama and papa you're out of the
[41:03] will of the lord you're wrong
[41:05] but think spiritually
[41:09] also in the natural he gets out of a job
[41:12] things look tight
[41:13] as we as we touched on last sunday if
[41:15] you start if you start thinking that
[41:17] you're going to start fending for
[41:18] yourself maybe you won't run back to
[41:21] mama and papa but maybe you'll run out
[41:22] and try to fend for yourself
[41:25] you're out of the will of the lord it's
[41:27] not it's not the proper pattern here
[41:30] what if he loses his job sister what are
[41:32] you going to do are you going to run
[41:34] back all
[41:34] remember this is the same problem that
[41:36] started this whole thing saints in the
[41:37] garden
[41:38] eve tried to fend for herself
[41:43] let's not go let's not get so
[41:46] spiritually lifted up in our position
[41:48] that we can start that we can start
[41:51] deviating from the pattern
[41:53] and do the same mistake that happened in
[41:55] the beginning to bring all of this
[41:57] about eve stepped out and
[42:01] tried to fend for herself she tried to
[42:03] shift for herself she tried
[42:05] to make something happen because she
[42:07] didn't have a proper understanding
[42:08] and she didn't have proper trust in adam
[42:11] to fulfill this word remember the word
[42:13] was multiply and replenish the earth
[42:16] the the motive was not a bad motive it
[42:19] was a motherly motive
[42:21] it was a motherly instinct she
[42:23] recognized that was her position she
[42:24] recognized that's what she was to do
[42:26] but brother branham says where adam
[42:28] lacked was he lacked in the knowledge of
[42:29] how to reproduce himself
[42:31] so adam is lacking in this knowledge god
[42:33] has withheld this knowledge from him at
[42:35] this point in time
[42:35] so how can he give it to his wife but in
[42:38] that meantime his wife gets impatient
[42:40] and she doesn't have trust in him let's
[42:42] put it this way adam adam
[42:44] lost his job
[42:47] and what did eve do did she stick with
[42:50] him
[42:50] or did she go try to fend for herself
[42:55] think spiritually i was praying in the
[42:57] back before i came out and
[42:59] you would just have to be really i'm
[43:02] just going to say this you all forgive
[43:03] me i'm
[43:04] it may sound really blunt but we've
[43:06] we've recognized the last several
[43:08] services god is trying to say something
[43:10] very specific very clear
[43:17] to the point that it's almost laughable
[43:19] like
[43:20] this is kind of obvious at this point
[43:22] everybody's saying the same thing
[43:23] but nobody can help it we don't have
[43:25] anything else to say
[43:27] everybody's saying the same thing but i
[43:29] was just praying in the back before i
[43:30] came out
[43:31] and i was asking the lord it's like help
[43:32] me not to miss it
[43:34] what specifically is this about
[43:37] everybody's coming along and just saying
[43:40] the same thing everybody's in the same
[43:41] vein everybody's saying this
[43:43] what specifically is it and i didn't
[43:46] hear a voice but just what dropped in my
[43:48] heart was this
[43:49] very clear i don't want my bride
[43:53] trying to fend for herself that is what
[43:57] this is about saints
[43:59] that's as clear as i know how to make it
[44:02] maybe we should sing him and go out
[44:04] but that's as clear as i know how to
[44:07] make it that is the
[44:08] point of all of this the
[44:11] laodicean age is all about that woman
[44:14] fending for herself
[44:18] it's wrong in the natural and it's wrong
[44:21] in the spiritual
[44:22] and if i had to wrap everything up
[44:24] everything that's been preached here for
[44:26] brother kyle from brother chad from
[44:28] brother burley for myself
[44:29] everything the the last several services
[44:32] that is what god is trying to say is i
[44:35] don't
[44:36] want my bride to fend for herself
[44:39] because if you try to fend for yourself
[44:42] you're going to mess it up
[44:48] that's why he's asking this sister this
[44:51] question
[44:52] what are you going to do sis when it
[44:54] gets tough
[44:57] because tough times are coming saints
[45:01] there's too many scriptures and too many
[45:02] quotes to support that
[45:05] and furthermore if
[45:08] tough times weren't coming it would
[45:11] break this marriage pattern because the
[45:14] whole reason that brother branham is
[45:16] asking this lady what she's going to do
[45:18] when tough times come
[45:20] is because he knows there's going to be
[45:22] tough times come
[45:26] so don't try to tell me that there's not
[45:28] going to be a politically backed
[45:29] persecution before this bride leaves the
[45:31] earth it would actually break this
[45:33] pattern
[45:34] there is going to be tough times come
[45:39] what are you going to do what are we
[45:42] going to do as an individual when things
[45:45] are tough
[45:48] and maybe our pastor doesn't even have
[45:49] the answer
[45:52] you sure don't have the answer the
[45:53] deacons don't have the answer
[45:56] the trustees don't have the answer you
[45:59] don't have the answer the pastor don't
[46:01] have the answer
[46:02] nobody's got the answer we're all out of
[46:05] a job
[46:09] what are we going to do what are we
[46:12] going to do
[46:13] are we going to run back to mama and
[46:15] papa are we going to run back to our own
[46:18] understanding
[46:19] are we going to run back to our own
[46:22] knowledge
[46:22] are we going to run back to our own
[46:25] thought process
[46:28] are we going to fend for ourself
[46:35] there's nothing wrong with not knowing
[46:38] the answer
[46:41] there is something wrong with trying to
[46:43] make up the answer
[46:46] and that is what started all of this in
[46:50] the beginning
[46:51] that is what we have to not do
[46:55] to reverse it it
[46:58] how much better now we understand the
[47:00] big picture we know as
[47:01] brother chad has been bringing out we
[47:02] know eve had to fall we know
[47:04] that the lamb was slain before the
[47:06] foundation of the world we know she had
[47:07] to fall so his expressions could be made
[47:08] manifest
[47:10] but i'm with with that understanding
[47:13] just think
[47:15] how much better would it have been
[47:18] or what would the result have been if
[47:21] eve would have simply rested
[47:24] and when he says and he comes you know
[47:26] you were made this way
[47:27] this is your purpose this is what you're
[47:29] supposed to do you were designed for
[47:31] this
[47:32] this is the way that it's supposed to be
[47:34] what if she would have just said
[47:35] i don't know that looks great
[47:39] looks okay looks like it might be right
[47:42] but my husband hasn't told me that yet
[47:44] so i don't know
[47:48] see that was the deviation in the
[47:50] beginning
[47:51] that is the deviation that has to be
[47:52] reversed in the end
[47:54] and that is what god if you leave here
[47:56] with nothing else this morning
[47:59] don't walk out of these doors in times
[48:02] that are coming
[48:03] and try to fend for yourself spiritually
[48:09] let your husband come on the scene and
[48:11] let
[48:12] him fend for you let him come on the
[48:14] scene and feed you
[48:16] and clothe you and make a place for you
[48:19] don't try to fend for yourself do not
[48:23] make the same mistake
[48:26] what if he loses his job sister are you
[48:29] going to run back home to mama and papa
[48:32] don't run back to your own knowledge
[48:34] don't run back to your own reasoning
[48:37] let me ask you this has it ever worked
[48:39] for you in the past
[48:43] and you think when more pressure comes
[48:45] and more situations come
[48:47] and it gets it gets harder and it gets
[48:49] more intense that all of a sudden now
[48:51] your reasoning is going to work it's
[48:54] not going to work saints it's not going
[48:56] to work
[48:57] we have to put our trust in him
[49:02] totally we half at
[49:05] 12 a week we have to put our trust in
[49:08] him
[49:10] living in a boxcar
[49:14] with newspaper tacked up onto the wall
[49:17] we have to keep our trust in him you
[49:20] know i found that ironic
[49:23] when brother branham goes through all of
[49:24] this he marries them they go and they
[49:27] live in their boxcar
[49:31] he does his sneaking up on them acting
[49:34] like he's checking the lines
[49:35] so he can see how they're doing
[49:38] and when he gets there what
[49:42] are they talking about
[49:45] they've got all the money laid out on
[49:47] the table
[49:49] and the only thing that this man is
[49:51] concerned about
[49:53] is buying this lady another dress
[49:58] oh that's a good story that's cute
[50:00] tearjerker
[50:02] saints it's not a story
[50:06] the only concern this man has is
[50:09] clothing this lady
[50:11] he had it then he has it now he always
[50:14] will have it
[50:18] it's in such simplicity that we just
[50:21] drive right over top of it his concern
[50:25] is to clothe you
[50:27] allow him to clothe you don't go try to
[50:29] make your own clothes
[50:31] don't go try to fend for yourself allow
[50:33] him to clothe you
[50:36] she said no sir i'm going to stay with
[50:39] him psalms 31 verse 23
[50:41] says o love the lord all ye his saints
[50:44] for the lord preserveth the faithful
[50:49] and plentiful rewardeth the proud doer

[50:58] go and do it themselves

[51:44] mike he's speaking of his covenant with
[51:45] david
[51:47] it shall be established forever as the
[51:50] moon
[51:51] and as a faithful witness in heaven
[51:55] psalms 101 6 mine eyes shall be upon the
[51:59] faithful

[52:07] ones that just stand there say
[52:09] i don't know i don't have the answer my
[52:12] husband hasn't told me
[52:14] but i'm sure not going to do something
[52:15] on my own i'm sure not going to try to
[52:17] make something up
[52:19] i'm going to stand here and i'm going to
[52:21] be faithful
[52:23] on what he showed me mine eyes shall be
[52:26] upon the faithful of the land
[52:28] that they may dwell with me he that
[52:30] walketh in a perfect
[52:32] way he shall serve me isaiah 1 18
[52:35] come now let us reason together saith
[52:38] the lord
[52:39] though your sins be as scarlet they
[52:41] shall be white as snow
[52:42] though they be red like crimson they
[52:44] shall be as wool
[52:46] if ye be willing and obedient ye shall
[52:48] eat the good of the land
[52:50] but if you refuse and rebel you shall be
[52:52] devoured with the sword
[52:53] for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it
[52:56] how is the
[52:57] faithful city become a harlot
[53:02] how is the faithful city become a harlot
[53:06] it was full of judgment and
[53:08] righteousness lodged in it
[53:09] but now murderers thy silver has become
[53:13] drost thy
[53:14] wine mixed with water thy princes are
[53:16] rebellious in companies of thieves
[53:19] everyone loveth gifts and followeth
[53:21] after rewards
[53:22] they judge not the fatherless neither do
[53:24] the
[53:25] doeth the cause of the widow come unto
[53:27] them
[53:28] therefore oh my goodness did you hear
[53:31] that verse saints
[53:33] 33 23 thy princes
[53:37] are rebellious and companies of thieves
[53:42] everyone loveth gifts and followeth
[53:45] after rewards
[53:47] they judge not the fatherless neither
[53:49] doeth the cause of the widow coming to
[53:51] them
[53:52] who's he talking about since he's
[53:53] talking about the ministry because it's
[53:55] the ministry's job to look after the
[53:57] fatherless it's the ministry's job to
[53:59] look after the widow
[54:00] but what did they do they became
[54:03] rebellious
[54:04] thieves loving gifts following after
[54:07] rewards
[54:09] how is it the faithful city has become a
[54:13] harlot
[54:21] therefore saith the lord the lord of
[54:24] hosts the mighty one of israel
[54:27] i will ease me of mine adversaries
[54:30] and avenge me of mine enemies
[54:34] and i will turn my hand upon them purely
[54:36] purge away thy dross and take away all
[54:38] thy ten
[54:39] and i will restore thy judges as at the
[54:42] first
[54:43] and thy counselors as at the beginning
[54:45] who's he talking about
[54:47] the ministry i will restore thy judges
[54:51] as the first
[54:52] and thy counselors as at the beginning
[54:55] afterward thou shalt be called
[54:58] afterward after i do this after i
[55:01] restore
[55:03] thou shalt be called the city of
[55:05] righteousness
[55:07] the faithful city
[55:10] why did he have to send us a prophet
[55:13] saints
[55:14] why did he have to send us malachi 4
[55:17] because
[55:17] they had become thieves they had become
[55:19] robbers they didn't care about the
[55:21] fatherless they didn't care about the
[55:23] widow
[55:23] they cared about gifts they cared about
[55:25] rewards
[55:27] but he says you have turned into a
[55:30] harlot
[55:31] the ministry has fallen they've turned
[55:33] my church into a harlot
[55:35] but i will restore i will send my true
[55:38] word
[55:40] i will send my true word and after that
[55:44] after i have restored the judges and the
[55:47] counselors
[55:48] after i have restored the word through
[55:50] the ministry
[55:52] thou shalt be called the city of
[55:53] righteousness the
[55:55] faithful city ephesians 1
[55:59] verse 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ
[56:01] by the will of god
[56:02] to the saints where which are ephesus
[56:05] and to the
[56:06] faithful in christ jesus why did he ask
[56:10] this little lady this question
[56:11] because he wanted her to tell him i'm
[56:13] going to be faithful
[56:14] because if she tells him i'm going to be
[56:17] faithful now he can identify her in the
[56:19] scripture
[56:20] now he can say it's going to be okay
[56:22] because if she's going to be faithful
[56:24] she will be the moon she will be the
[56:26] faithful city she will be the righteous
[56:28] city
[56:28] she will be the one that paul will speak
[56:30] to
[56:32] paul is not speaking to the unfaithful
[56:34] paul is not speaking to a bride that's
[56:35] going to defend her
[56:36] finn for herself
[56:40] paul is speaking to the faithful in
[56:41] christ jesus if you're not faithful in
[56:43] christ
[56:44] jesus paul is not even speaking to you
[56:46] but if you are the faithful in christ
[56:47] jesus
[56:48] paul is speaking directly to you
[56:51] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[56:53] will of god to the saints which are at
[56:55] ephesus
[56:56] and to the faithful in christ jesus
[56:59] grace be unto you why is grace unto you
[57:02] because you're faithful you're not
[57:06] fending for yourself you're trusting in
[57:08] him
[57:09] grace be to you and peace why is peace
[57:12] given to you
[57:13] because you're faithful from god
[57:17] our father and from the lord jesus
[57:18] christ blessed be the god and father of
[57:21] our lord jesus christ
[57:22] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[57:24] blessings in heavenly places in christ
[57:27] why do you have spiritual blessings
[57:29] because you're faithful
[57:30] why have you been called up into
[57:32] heavenly places because you're faithful
[57:34] do you get any of that if you're not
[57:36] faithful no
[57:40] why is it important that this little
[57:42] lady responds to the prophet
[57:44] i'm not running back to mama and papa
[57:46] i'm not going to try to fend for myself
[57:48] oh you say well that's just a good
[57:50] question it is it's a good question
[57:53] but the spiritual principle that lays
[57:55] behind it
[57:56] allows this prophet to know that if
[57:58] she's going to be faithful
[58:00] and she's not going to run off and try
[58:01] to do her own thing she's going to be a
[58:03] representation of the faithful city
[58:05] and now there is nothing withholding
[58:07] from her now
[58:09] nothing stands in the way
[58:14] blessed be the god and father of our
[58:15] lord jesus christ who hath blessed you
[58:17] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[58:19] places in christ
[58:20] according as he hath chosen us in him
[58:23] before the foundation of the world that
[58:25] we should be holy and without blame
[58:28] before him in love
[58:29] how many wants to be holy and without
[58:31] blame before him in love
[58:34] be faithful be faithful and you can be
[58:38] having predestinated us unto the
[58:40] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[58:42] himself
[58:43] according to the good pleasure of his
[58:45] will to the praise
[58:47] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[58:50] hath made us
[58:51] accepted in the beloved
[58:55] colossians 1 verse 1 paul an apostle of
[58:58] jesus christ by the will of god and

[59:00] timotheus our brother to the saints
[59:04] and faithful brethren in christ which
[59:07] were which are at colosse

[59:13] because god because god is not going to
[59:16] speak to a flirter
[59:18] god is not going to come home at the end
[59:20] of his work day
[59:21] and try to find his wife
[59:24] wondering where she's at wondering where
[59:27] she's gallivanting around at now
[59:30] and then just express himself to anybody
[59:34] he's going to come home at the end of
[59:36] his work day
[59:38] at the end of the laodicean age at the
[59:40] end of the seventh day
[59:41] when he's going into his rest he's going
[59:43] to come home and he's going to sit down
[59:45] and say there is my faithful wife and
[59:47] reveal himself to her
[59:51] to the saints and faithful brethren
[59:53] which are in christ which were
[59:54] which are at colosse grace be unto you
[59:59] and peace from god our father and the
[1:00:01] lord jesus christ

[1:04:19] common to man
[1:04:20] but god is faithful
[1:04:24] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:04:26] above that you're able but will
[1:04:28] with the temptation also make a way of
[1:04:30] escape that ye may be able to bear it
[1:04:33] hebrews 10 23 let us hold fast
[1:04:36] fast the profession of our faith without
[1:04:38] wavering for
[1:04:39] he is faithful that promised
[1:04:43] hebrews 11 11 through faith
[1:04:48] also sarah herself received strength to
[1:04:50] conceive seed and was delivered of a
[1:04:52] child
[1:04:52] when she was past aged because
[1:04:57] she judged him faithful
[1:05:01] who had promised
[1:05:05] how did she conceive because
[1:05:09] she judged him who was faithful
[1:05:16] she judged him as faithful
[1:05:19] who had given her the promise she didn't
[1:05:22] run back to mama and papa
[1:05:24] at this point she had already tried her
[1:05:26] own way remember
[1:05:27] didn't work out too swell funny thing is
[1:05:30] what did it produce
[1:05:31] an ishmael what did brother brandon say
[1:05:34] ishmael was
[1:05:35] unregenerable unconvertible
[1:05:39] aka kane
[1:05:43] it's detrimental to try to make our own
[1:05:45] way saints
[1:05:47] it is detrimental it will
[1:05:50] cause this cycle to continue over
[1:05:53] and over and over in the big picture
[1:05:56] and in your daily life keep trying to
[1:06:00] make your own way financially
[1:06:03] it's going to be unconvertible and
[1:06:04] unregeneratable
[1:06:06] it will not work try to solve your
[1:06:09] emotional problems
[1:06:11] it's going to be unregenerable and
[1:06:13] unconvertible it will never work
[1:06:16] try to fix your spiritual problems
[1:06:20] not going to work the pattern is already
[1:06:24] there it will not work in any instance
[1:06:30] but if you judge him
[1:06:34] as faithful you can conceive
[1:06:38] and you can bear the son of man again if
[1:06:41] you judge
[1:06:42] him as faithful see the funny thing is
[1:06:44] you can never you can never be faithful
[1:06:48] as much as you want to be you can never
[1:06:50] be faithful
[1:06:51] unless you judge him as faithful because
[1:06:54] we love him because he first loved us
[1:06:59] if he wasn't faithful we would have no
[1:07:02] capacity to be faithful
[1:07:05] if he wasn't faithful we would have no
[1:07:08] desire to be faithful
[1:07:10] because remember what we're talking
[1:07:12] about
[1:07:13] he's choosing a bride
[1:07:17] and he's brother branham says a man
[1:07:19] always chooses
[1:07:22] what's on the inside of him
[1:07:28] why is he looking for a faithful bride
[1:07:31] because he's faithful why is he not
[1:07:34] looking for a bride who wants to fend
[1:07:36] for him
[1:07:37] for herself because he never offended
[1:07:39] for himself when he was here
[1:07:43] why is he looking for a bride that will
[1:07:45] be satisfied with twelve dollars a week
[1:07:48] is because he was satisfied with the
[1:07:51] allotment the father gave him when he
[1:07:52] was here
[1:07:54] why is he looking for these
[1:07:55] characteristics why is he desiring for
[1:07:58] you to display these characteristics
[1:08:00] is because these are his characteristics
[1:08:06] and if you will be as sarah and you will
[1:08:08] judge him as
[1:08:10] faithful big picture
[1:08:13] and little picture
[1:08:17] then he can move then he can come on the
[1:08:20] scene
[1:08:21] it's got to the point now saints that
[1:08:22] anymore whenever something rises up the
[1:08:26] first thing i try to do is go to god
[1:08:28] and tell them i can't fix this
[1:08:31] because you know the first thing that i
[1:08:32] always wanted to do and it's in my dna
[1:08:35] to do
[1:08:36] is see problem fixed problem it's my
[1:08:39] specialty
[1:08:40] c problem fixed problem
[1:08:44] see problem fix problem some of us get
[1:08:48] more of a dose of that than others i got
[1:08:51] a lot of it
[1:08:53] my daddy had a lot of it his daddy had a
[1:08:55] lot of it it's what we're known for
[1:08:58] working and fixing problems
[1:09:01] it's not always a good thing unless he
[1:09:04] tells you how to fix the problem first
[1:09:05] and then you see the problem you can fix
[1:09:07] the problem
[1:09:08] but it's got to the point that when
[1:09:10] something rises up i try
[1:09:12] i haven't perfected it yet but i try to
[1:09:14] pump the brakes and say lord i can't fix
[1:09:17] this
[1:09:18] because even if i think i can fix it i
[1:09:20] know i really can't
[1:09:24] because even if i think i can
[1:09:27] let's just take something carnal
[1:09:30] there's a bill that needs paid i can't
[1:09:32] pay that bill
[1:09:34] but i can pay that bill if i work this
[1:09:36] other job
[1:09:38] or i work an extra job whatever the case
[1:09:40] may be
[1:09:41] so that you see the problem you fix the
[1:09:43] problem but what if he doesn't even give
[1:09:45] you health and strength to work that job
[1:09:48] how are you going to fix the problem you
[1:09:49] can't so if he doesn't even give you
[1:09:52] health and strength to work i'm not
[1:09:54] saying there's anything
[1:09:55] working the overtime or work in the
[1:09:56] other job it may be perfectly right it
[1:09:57] may be the answer to the solution
[1:10:00] it may be what god has put there to fix
[1:10:03] it
[1:10:05] but if you say i'm going to do that
[1:10:07] because i can see how that will work
[1:10:09] it's not going to work and even if it
[1:10:11] does it doesn't give glory to him so
[1:10:12] what's the purpose of it
[1:10:13] if your life doesn't give glory to him
[1:10:15] and everything what's the purpose of
[1:10:16] even living
[1:10:17] but if he comes and he says i've
[1:10:19] presented and i've prepared and i've
[1:10:21] i have allowed this job here in this
[1:10:23] situation to provide the funds for this
[1:10:25] bill that needs paid and that's the way
[1:10:27] i want you to fix that
[1:10:29] now who has fixed the problem and now
[1:10:32] who is obligated
[1:10:33] to give you health and strength to go
[1:10:35] and do that job
[1:10:37] it's really that simple it really is
[1:10:41] it is really that simple but we get so
[1:10:44] prideful and we get so arrogant and we
[1:10:47] get
[1:10:48] such such faith in ourselves
[1:10:51] that we think we can take care of
[1:10:54] ourselves
[1:10:55] and the scripture says you can't even
[1:10:57] breathe unless he gives you breath
[1:11:00] so don't try to convince me that you can
[1:11:02] fix your problems
[1:11:04] because you couldn't even breathe to
[1:11:06] provide oxygen into your lungs
[1:11:08] and into your brain cells to even reason
[1:11:10] out a problem if he didn't even give you
[1:11:11] breath to do it
[1:11:13] you say well that's really elementary it
[1:11:16] really is
[1:11:17] but we have got so prideful in our in
[1:11:20] our own knowledge
[1:11:21] just as lucifer did he got so lifted up
[1:11:24] in his own capacity
[1:11:27] that he failed to even recognize i can't
[1:11:30] even get out of
[1:11:31] bed unless he gets me out of bed
[1:11:35] but it's got to the point that that's
[1:11:36] how i try to approach it now
[1:11:39] and most of the time i'm actually kind
[1:11:40] of right because if something happens to
[1:11:42] the vehicle
[1:11:43] lord knows i i can't fix it like i can
[1:11:46] put gas in it
[1:11:47] i can change the oil if i have to i can
[1:11:49] hear up the tires
[1:11:51] but something else happens it's not
[1:11:54] going it's not going to work
[1:11:55] it is not going to work i am not going
[1:11:58] to be able to fix that
[1:12:01] you say well that's really trivial it is
[1:12:03] but it works
[1:12:04] the windshield washer square quit
[1:12:06] spraying on my vehicle
[1:12:09] i am so humble at this point that i just
[1:12:11] said ain't no way i can fix that i'm
[1:12:12] taking it somebody who can
[1:12:14] so i called the guy i said hey i've got
[1:12:15] to bring this in it's not spraying i'm
[1:12:16] not even getting into it
[1:12:18] like i know my capacity i know my
[1:12:19] limitations
[1:12:21] if you need a deer it needs killed call
[1:12:23] me if you need the turkey need skill
[1:12:24] call me
[1:12:24] you need somebody spied on call me but
[1:12:26] you need a vehicle fixed
[1:12:29] not me i said i know my capacity i don't
[1:12:31] deal in this realm
[1:12:33] when can i bring it in he says well do
[1:12:36] me a favor before you do that just pop
[1:12:37] the hood look up under there there's
[1:12:38] usually a little rubber hose that goes
[1:12:40] into the back of the nozzle
[1:12:41] those pop off a lot of times and it
[1:12:42] won't spray
[1:12:44] yeah but you don't know me you don't
[1:12:48] know my luck with vehicles you don't
[1:12:49] understand it'll be more complicated
[1:12:51] than that no
[1:12:51] it was literally that simple i said god
[1:12:53] i don't know how to fix that
[1:12:55] i've got to take it to somebody please
[1:12:56] help me with this situation i call the
[1:12:58] guy he says just check the rubber nozzle
[1:13:00] now
[1:13:00] i know you all are laughing at me
[1:13:01] because you're like yeah i would have
[1:13:02] done that
[1:13:03] you know you're ignorant for not even
[1:13:05] knowing that i am i'm sorry it's just
[1:13:06] the way that it is
[1:13:08] but he says just look back there those
[1:13:10] rubber hoses pop off a lot of times
[1:13:12] you can plug them back on and everything
[1:13:14] will be fine pop the hood the rubber
[1:13:15] hoses
[1:13:16] had popped off plugged it back on
[1:13:19] it was fine i needed to get a little
[1:13:23] like two dollar nozzle to replace it
[1:13:25] with because it got plugged up and
[1:13:26] that's why the
[1:13:27] hose had popped off but it's that simple
[1:13:30] saints
[1:13:32] and he wants to operate on that level
[1:13:37] and on a heavenly level from the lowest
[1:13:40] of lows
[1:13:41] to the simple of simple to the point
[1:13:45] that you're setting on the throne with
[1:13:47] him
[1:13:48] not fending for yourself
[1:13:52] and if we can't get it right in the
[1:13:54] simple things
[1:13:55] we will never get it right in the
[1:13:56] spiritual things
[1:13:58] the scripture says that he that is not
[1:14:01] faithful in the little things and no
[1:14:02] wise will get greater things
[1:14:06] we have to come to that recognition on a
[1:14:09] daily basis
[1:14:10] i can't fix this i don't know the next
[1:14:13] step
[1:14:14] i don't know what to do and if you do
[1:14:18] that's fine just recognize that he's the
[1:14:20] one that's gave you the knowledge to
[1:14:21] know what to do
[1:14:24] don't think it's yourself don't think
[1:14:25] it's something that you came up with
[1:14:27] don't get prideful and lifted up
[1:14:31] where am i at
[1:14:35] sarah judged him faithful
[1:14:39] that's how she was able to produce a
[1:14:41] promised son revelation 1
[1:14:43] 5 and from jesus christ who is the
[1:14:46] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:14:48] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[1:14:49] of the earth and to him that loved us
[1:14:50] and washed us
[1:14:52] from our sins in his own blood
[1:14:57] who is the faithful witness jesus is the
[1:15:00] faithfulness
[1:15:01] why is he looking for a faithful witness
[1:15:05] as the moon in the sky because he is the
[1:15:08] faithful witness
[1:15:10] that's why he's looking for a faithful
[1:15:11] witness
[1:15:14] revelation 3 14 and unto the angel
[1:15:17] of the church of the lord it seems right
[1:15:20] these things saith the amen
[1:15:24] the faithful and true witness
[1:15:28] why does he keep
[1:15:32] repeating himself see it's scriptural
[1:15:36] what i do
[1:15:37] i keep repeating myself in the scripture
[1:15:39] god does the same thing
[1:15:42] why does he keep repeating himself why
[1:15:45] does he keep drawing attention to this
[1:15:48] because as he is so
[1:15:52] are we in this world
[1:15:55] why does he want us to be faithful
[1:15:58] and true is because he is faithful and
[1:16:01] true
[1:16:02] why is he choosing a bride that is
[1:16:05] faithful and true
[1:16:07] is because that is what's on the inside
[1:16:09] of him
[1:16:12] revelation 19 11 and i saw heaven opened
[1:16:15] and behold a white horse and he that set
[1:16:18] up on him was
[1:16:19] called faithful
[1:16:22] and true and in righteousness he doth
[1:16:26] make that he doth judge and make war
[1:16:30] isaiah 49 15 can a woman forget her
[1:16:33] sucking child that she should not have
[1:16:35] compassion on the son of her womb
[1:16:37] yea they may forget yet will
[1:16:41] i not forget thee
[1:16:44] sounds like to me he is faithful
[1:16:47] remember we're dealing with the question
[1:16:48] brother branham turned to the man and he
[1:16:50] asked her
[1:16:51] ask him what are you going to do when
[1:16:53] things get tough
[1:16:55] what are you going to do when you got
[1:16:58] too many children to feed
[1:16:59] and you can't make it what are you going
[1:17:02] to do are you
[1:17:03] going to send this bride away you've
[1:17:05] brought her through luther
[1:17:07] you've brought her through wesley you
[1:17:08] brought her through the pentecost but
[1:17:10] now it's a load of seeing and things are
[1:17:12] tight
[1:17:14] it's dark it is hard to make a living
[1:17:18] what are you going to do lord
[1:17:21] are you going to send this bride back
[1:17:23] into another age
[1:17:28] are you don't get confused about into
[1:17:30] another age are you going to send her
[1:17:33] back
[1:17:33] into another condition are you going to
[1:17:36] just leave
[1:17:37] her in a justified condition are you
[1:17:39] just going to leave
[1:17:40] her in a sanctified condition
[1:17:44] are you just going to leave her with the
[1:17:46] gifts of the spirit
[1:17:47] because things are tight things are
[1:17:49] tough it's dark
[1:17:52] are you just going to leave her there
[1:17:53] are you going to send her back into that
[1:17:56] it's safe there it's safe there mama and
[1:17:58] papa will take care of her
[1:18:02] what did the lord say he said no
[1:18:07] i will die i will die
[1:18:11] here on calvary so that i can clothe her
[1:18:14] two thousand years from now
[1:18:16] i will die here on calvary i will give
[1:18:20] everything that i am
[1:18:21] so that she does not have to stay in
[1:18:23] those conditions that i can bring her
[1:18:25] out
[1:18:26] of those conditions and literally make
[1:18:29] her as i
[1:18:30] am she will be on the earth i will not
[1:18:33] leave her in an incomplete condition i
[1:18:35] will bring her into the fullness of the
[1:18:37] word made flesh
[1:18:39] i will not leave her with just an
[1:18:41] anointing but i will
[1:18:42] i will bring her to the point that the
[1:18:44] holy spirit indwells her
[1:18:46] i will bring her to the point that i
[1:18:48] indwell her myself
[1:18:49] i will not send her away when things get
[1:18:51] tough i will make a way for her i will
[1:18:53] struggle on
[1:18:55] i won't leave her in those those
[1:18:57] conditions
[1:18:59] i will open that door for her
[1:19:02] i will open that door into heavenly
[1:19:04] places
[1:19:06] even if it cost me my life and it did
[1:19:11] per the prophet he died
[1:19:15] for this ministry he died
[1:19:18] so you have no excuses
[1:19:21] he died so that you have
[1:19:25] no no way back
[1:19:28] you don't have to run back you can move
[1:19:31] forward in the word
[1:19:32] you can be as he is
[1:19:36] in this earth he died for that
[1:19:39] he didn't just send you back he didn't
[1:19:42] send you away till things got easier
[1:19:43] it's not going to get easier
[1:19:46] but he died to make that way for you he
[1:19:50] died to prepare this word for you so
[1:19:53] that you could be clothed
[1:19:54] so that you could be faithful
[1:19:59] are you going to send her back to mama
[1:20:01] and papa
[1:20:03] things are tight things are rough things
[1:20:05] are dark
[1:20:06] are you going to just leave her there in
[1:20:08] her own in her own reasoning
[1:20:10] in her own thinking maybe she makes it
[1:20:12] maybe she doesn't
[1:20:15] he says no no we'll struggle on
[1:20:18] we will make a way somehow
[1:20:22] how's he going to do it saints i don't
[1:20:24] know
[1:20:26] i don't know how is he going to overcome
[1:20:30] this load of cnh on 12
[1:20:32] a week i have no idea
[1:20:36] but i know he died so that he could
[1:20:40] and i know he has washed me and he has
[1:20:42] forgiven my sins
[1:20:44] and covered them with his own blood
[1:20:47] the sins of my unbelief the sins of my
[1:20:50] not understanding
[1:20:51] the sins of my ignorance he
[1:20:54] died to bring a word so that we don't
[1:20:57] have to stay in that condition
[1:20:59] we don't have to stay in a condition
[1:21:02] of sin by ignorance
[1:21:06] we can move into a proper understanding
[1:21:08] if you want to stay in ignorance you can
[1:21:11] but you don't have to if you if you
[1:21:14] see that was the that was the issue with
[1:21:16] the lotus c and ages they wanted to stay
[1:21:18] into that
[1:21:20] they thought they were rich they thought
[1:21:23] they were closed
[1:21:24] they thought they could see but they
[1:21:26] were ignorant to the fact that they
[1:21:28] couldn't
[1:21:29] they were wretched and blind and naked
[1:21:31] and poor and miserable
[1:21:34] but they didn't know any better because
[1:21:36] they were ignorant because they refused
[1:21:38] the i south
[1:21:41] but you don't have to stay in that
[1:21:42] condition
[1:21:45] because he died that you didn't have to
[1:21:49] he says a woman may forget her sucking
[1:21:52] child but i
[1:21:53] will not forget my bride sounds like to
[1:21:55] me he's faithful
[1:21:56] sounds like to me he meets the
[1:21:58] requirement
[1:22:04] deuteronomy 31 6 be strong of a good
[1:22:07] courage
[1:22:08] fear not nor be afraid of them
[1:22:12] for the lord thy god he it is
[1:22:16] that doeth go with thee that
[1:22:20] he will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:22:24] sounds like he's faithful to me
[1:22:28] hebrews 13 5 let your conversation be
[1:22:31] without covetedness
[1:22:33] and be content with such things as you
[1:22:35] have for
[1:22:36] he hath said i will never leave thee
[1:22:40] nor forsake thee
[1:22:43] philippians 1 verse 3 i thank my god
[1:22:46] paul's speaking
[1:22:47] i thank my god upon every remembrance of
[1:22:50] you
[1:22:51] always in every prayer of mine for you
[1:22:54] all making requests with joy
[1:22:56] for your fellowship in the gospel
[1:22:59] from the first day into now being
[1:23:02] confident of this thing that he
[1:23:06] which hath begun a good work in you
[1:23:09] will perform it until the day of jesus
[1:23:13] christ
[1:23:15] why does he want you to be faithful
[1:23:17] because he is faithful
[1:23:19] and he's going to express his
[1:23:21] faithfulness through you
[1:23:28] musicians if you'll come we're going to
[1:23:31] wrap this up revelation 21
[1:23:37] verse 5 and he that set upon the throne
[1:23:41] said
[1:23:43] behold i make all things new
[1:23:47] and he said unto me
[1:23:50] write for these words
[1:23:54] are true and
[1:23:58] you guessed it faithful
[1:24:04] what are you going to do lord when
[1:24:05] things get tough
[1:24:07] you want to send her away you want to
[1:24:11] tell her to make her own way
[1:24:14] you're going to tell her good luck and
[1:24:16] walk out the door
[1:24:18] he says no no i am going to open a door
[1:24:21] for her into heavenly realms
[1:24:24] i'm going to call her up a little higher
[1:24:27] to where she can see things for what
[1:24:29] they really are
[1:24:30] and i'm going to impart into her before
[1:24:33] the foundation of the world
[1:24:35] the capacity to be faithful
[1:24:39] and trust in me and then i'm going to
[1:24:42] stand back and i'm going to watch
[1:24:44] and i'm going to watch as she chooses
[1:24:47] to be faithful unto me you say well
[1:24:50] that's kind of rigged
[1:24:52] it is it is
[1:24:56] but would you have it any other way
[1:25:00] brother branham says he could
[1:25:02] predestinate because he foreknew
[1:25:05] he foreknew the decision you would make
[1:25:08] therefore he could predestinate you
[1:25:10] to have the capacity to believe would
[1:25:13] you have it any other way
[1:25:15] do you want it to rest on your willpower
[1:25:18] your ability to get it right or are you
[1:25:21] comfortable
[1:25:22] and are you okay with him rigging it
[1:25:26] and giving you that capacity
[1:25:29] right he says write this down john
[1:25:34] for my words are true and my words
[1:25:38] are faithful we get to the end of this
[1:25:42] and brother branham says
[1:25:45] now let me just review the questions
[1:25:47] real quick
[1:25:50] we're at an hour and 15 minutes so i'll
[1:25:52] get you out under two hours
[1:25:55] just focus real quickly on this
[1:26:00] he comes and he's this man has chosen a
[1:26:03] bride
[1:26:06] and brother branham is going to do the
[1:26:08] marriage
[1:26:10] but before this marriage can take place
[1:26:12] there has to be this preamble to the
[1:26:14] marriage this conversation has to take
[1:26:16] place
[1:26:16] and it has to take place to the point
[1:26:18] that he tells this boy
[1:26:20] listen to what i'm saying i want to talk
[1:26:21] to you you're not paying attention
[1:26:25] he asked this girl are you old enough to
[1:26:27] get married are you
[1:26:28] spiritually mature enough to move into a
[1:26:31] marriage
[1:26:32] do you have your written permission have
[1:26:33] you done everything i've told you to do
[1:26:35] have you repented have you been baptized
[1:26:37] in my name are you
[1:26:38] spiritually mature enough are you old
[1:26:41] enough to be married
[1:26:43] he asked this man the type of our lord
[1:26:46] do you love her
[1:26:47] he answers affirmative he asked her do
[1:26:49] you love him
[1:26:50] she says yes i do he asked the man do
[1:26:54] you have some place to take her
[1:26:57] the lord responds i will go away
[1:27:01] i will come again but i'm going to
[1:27:03] prepare a place for you
[1:27:05] can we see this clearly can we see
[1:27:08] the prophet going through this pattern
[1:27:11] because he knows the pattern that god
[1:27:14] has set
[1:27:16] he says yes i do have a place for her
[1:27:19] i've opened the door up in the heavenly
[1:27:20] rooms
[1:27:22] i've got a box car for her with
[1:27:24] newspaper tacked to the wall
[1:27:26] good enough you've got a place for her
[1:27:33] he says what
[1:27:36] are you going to do for a living for her
[1:27:39] can you feed her
[1:27:41] can you clothe her can our lord feed us
[1:27:46] has he fed us has he clothed us
[1:27:53] what are you going to do sis when it
[1:27:54] gets tough
[1:27:56] what are you going to do little bride
[1:27:58] when it gets tough
[1:28:00] are you going to run back into your own
[1:28:02] understanding from another age
[1:28:04] from another dispensation from your
[1:28:07] genetic makeup
[1:28:08] maybe you have a little bit of a
[1:28:10] intelligence
[1:28:12] just because your brain cells haven't
[1:28:15] broken down completely yet from hybrid
[1:28:17] food maybe you maybe you have a little
[1:28:19] bit of ability to look at things and
[1:28:21] reason them out
[1:28:22] are you going to rely upon that
[1:28:26] what are you going to do little bride
[1:28:28] when it gets tight
[1:28:32] she says i'm just going to stand right
[1:28:34] here i'm just going to stick it out
[1:28:36] i'm just going to stay right with him
[1:28:38] i'm not
[1:28:39] going to fend for myself
[1:28:43] what are you going to do lord what are
[1:28:45] you going to do when looted seeing comes
[1:28:47] and all the floodgates of hell are open
[1:28:50] and hell has
[1:28:51] literally spilled out on the earth
[1:28:56] spilled out onto earth what are you
[1:28:59] going to do
[1:29:00] how are you going to make a living for
[1:29:04] how are you going to clothe her how are
[1:29:05] you going to keep her from
[1:29:09] he that i don't know i don't know but i
[1:29:12] will do all that i can
[1:29:15] i will give my life
[1:29:18] so that i can take care of them two
[1:29:20] thousand years from now
[1:29:25] we will struggle right on
[1:29:28] we will make it somehow
[1:29:31] but he goes through all of this
[1:29:34] and then this is his final statement
[1:29:39] he says i felt little
[1:29:46] i felt little
[1:29:49] why did he feel little
[1:29:54] because he's running them through the
[1:29:55] ringer
[1:29:57] he's running them through the ringer
[1:30:01] he's asking hard questions
[1:30:04] he's running them through the ringer and
[1:30:06] asking them hard questions and
[1:30:08] all along they really did
[1:30:11] love each other and he says
[1:30:14] i felt little he felt bad he felt bad
[1:30:18] for asking them all these questions
[1:30:20] because they before they even walked in
[1:30:24] they really did love each other
[1:30:29] why would he feel bad for asking them
[1:30:32] all these questions
[1:30:36] because before they walked in they
[1:30:39] really did love each other already
[1:30:43] see this is the indication of a true
[1:30:45] ministry
[1:30:47] the ministry's job is to make you fall
[1:30:50] in love with christ
[1:30:52] and once you do that he don't need to
[1:30:55] keep asking you hard questions
[1:30:59] or tearing you down or making sure
[1:31:01] everything's okay
[1:31:04] or what kind of house do you have to
[1:31:08] take her to
[1:31:11] a boxcar has that been inspected
[1:31:17] has child protective services looked at
[1:31:19] that
[1:31:21] that wasn't the point the point of the
[1:31:24] ministry's job
[1:31:25] was to get you in love with christ jesus
[1:31:29] and then any true ministry that would
[1:31:32] keep prying into that
[1:31:36] and discrediting that and making you try
[1:31:40] to doubt that
[1:31:41] and getting you into a works program
[1:31:46] it shows that they're prideful because
[1:31:48] they should feel bad about that
[1:31:50] that's what the prophet did that's what
[1:31:52] he said i'm not making it up
[1:31:54] he said it at the end of all of this
[1:31:57] when he came to a proper understanding
[1:32:00] these two people love each other
[1:32:04] lord i sure feel bad for asking them all
[1:32:06] these questions
[1:32:09] look at the humility look at the
[1:32:12] homeless
[1:32:15] you see
[1:32:20] look remember the big picture
[1:32:24] remember the big picture this is
[1:32:27] choosing of abroad
[1:32:30] this is eliezer standing on the west
[1:32:34] coast
[1:32:36] calling out a bride
[1:32:40] literally and when eliezer
[1:32:44] went and he found rebecca
[1:32:48] and he said this is my intention
[1:32:52] this is representation these are the
[1:32:54] gifts of my master
[1:32:55] take them here's some for your family
[1:33:00] and then he says will you go she says
[1:33:02] i'm going to go
[1:33:03] i will go i will go eliezer
[1:33:08] did not say well that's great
[1:33:11] have you looked at these gifts over here
[1:33:14] i have more gifts
[1:33:19] he did not divert the focus
[1:33:22] back to himself
[1:33:25] when she said i'll go he said let's go
[1:33:30] why because eliezer
[1:33:34] was not going to marry rebecca
[1:33:39] eliezer's job was to get rebecca
[1:33:42] in love with isaac so she would go to
[1:33:44] him
[1:33:45] and when she came to the point that she
[1:33:48] was really
[1:33:48] willing to forsake her own
[1:33:52] way of living her mama and papa
[1:33:56] think spiritually when she got to the
[1:34:00] point
[1:34:01] that she was willing to forsake her own
[1:34:04] reasoning
[1:34:06] and trust solely in him this man that
[1:34:10] she had never
[1:34:11] visibly seen before but she already knew
[1:34:14] when she came to the point that she says
[1:34:17] i will go
[1:34:18] eliezer says let's go
[1:34:24] he never broke out any more gifts
[1:34:34] he never even tried to give any more
[1:34:36] gifts to laban
[1:34:40] when she says i'm willing to go eliezer
[1:34:42] said let's go they got on the camels and
[1:34:44] they left
[1:34:47] it was laban it was the family
[1:34:51] it was their own reasoning it was your
[1:34:53] own reasoning that tried to say
[1:34:55] stick around just a little bit longer
[1:34:59] do you have any more of those bracelets
[1:35:03] those were pretty dynamic when you
[1:35:06] brought them out
[1:35:07] thank spiritually saints
[1:35:11] there wasn't anything wrong with the
[1:35:13] bracelets and the earrings and the
[1:35:15] all the gold that he had wasn't anything
[1:35:18] wrong
[1:35:19] the purpose was to be a representation
[1:35:22] of her husband
[1:35:25] but once she fell in love with the
[1:35:28] husband
[1:35:30] he never tried to sell her any more
[1:35:32] bracelets he never tried to give her any
[1:35:34] more earrings
[1:35:35] he never tried to do anything else
[1:35:38] and that is exactly what brother branham
[1:35:42] was fleshing out he's standing here on
[1:35:45] the west coast
[1:35:46] as eliezer trying to call that
[1:35:49] pentecostal age out
[1:35:51] trying to call them out he comes at the
[1:35:54] very first of the service and he says
[1:35:55] now you know
[1:35:56] my ministry no man can do this only god
[1:35:58] can do this
[1:35:59] what's he doing he's introducing the
[1:36:01] bridegroom no man can do this
[1:36:04] it has to be god
[1:36:10] he doing he's showing the bride the
[1:36:12] bracelets
[1:36:14] he's showing her the earrings he's
[1:36:16] giving gifts to laban
[1:36:19] but what was the purpose so he could
[1:36:22] come to the end of that remember the two
[1:36:24] scriptures he read
[1:36:25] eliezer and the seventh vile angel
[1:36:28] the seventh vile angel is the same angel
[1:36:30] that showed john the city
[1:36:33] the faithful city as a bride
[1:36:36] adorned for her husband the purpose
[1:36:40] wasn't just
[1:36:40] eliezer eliezer was here to give gifts
[1:36:45] to make her fall in love with her
[1:36:46] husband to recognize her husband to get
[1:36:48] on the camel
[1:36:49] and take her to her husband and when she
[1:36:51] got on the campbell he wasn't interested
[1:36:53] in sticking around to show more gifts
[1:36:55] to laban
[1:36:59] he wasn't interested in saying hey
[1:37:01] rebecca well come over here there's one
[1:37:02] box that i forgot i know you're in love
[1:37:04] with isaac i know you want to go but
[1:37:06] i've got something
[1:37:07] i've got something for you
[1:37:13] think spiritually saints when eleazar
[1:37:18] got rebecca in love with isaac he says
[1:37:21] let's go because i want to go back home
[1:37:25] i want to get off the scene
[1:37:29] because i'm not going to marry you
[1:37:30] isaac's going to marry you marry you
[1:37:34] ellie easier was not
[1:37:37] i'm trying to stop but eliezer was
[1:37:40] not wanting to stick around with
[1:37:42] rebecca's family
[1:37:44] he wanted to get back to his own family
[1:37:50] therefore he wasn't interested in
[1:37:52] sticking around to show laban
[1:37:54] what a great ministry he had
[1:37:58] when he was done rebecca's on the camel
[1:38:01] we're going to see
[1:38:02] isaac he was not interested
[1:38:05] in showing himself off regardless of
[1:38:08] what gifts he still had on the camel
[1:38:10] to laban he says i'm out of here
[1:38:13] i'm going back to my family
[1:38:18] that's exactly what eliza did as we
[1:38:20] stand
[1:38:21] tell me that's not what brother branham
[1:38:24] did
[1:38:25] he came he called out a bride
[1:38:29] he introduced that bride to her
[1:38:31] bridegroom and then he said
[1:38:34] i must decrease he must increase
[1:38:39] i probably won't be around much longer
[1:38:41] but these tapes they'll live on
[1:38:45] it's the same pattern saints it's the
[1:38:49] same pattern in such a simple story
[1:38:54] but think think about how many
[1:38:57] scriptures were fulfilled when he was
[1:38:59] standing there behind that pulpit
[1:39:01] preaching that message
[1:39:02] it is mind-boggling
[1:39:05] literally i'm not saying types and
[1:39:07] shadows i mean he's literally
[1:39:09] fleshing out these scriptures
[1:39:16] remember the point of eleazar
[1:39:20] you'll just play something softly
[1:39:21] remember the point of eliezer
[1:39:24] eliezer was there
[1:39:27] to get rebecca for a marriage
[1:39:32] for a marriage he didn't
[1:39:35] find rebecca and then just leave her
[1:39:37] there he
[1:39:39] found rebecca put her through an open
[1:39:41] door
[1:39:43] put her onto a camel and took her
[1:39:46] somewhere
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:49] the point is not to recognize the church
[1:39:51] ages saints
[1:39:53] the point is to recognize the church
[1:39:55] ages so you can recognize the messenger
[1:39:57] so you can get through the open door so
[1:39:58] you can get on the camel
[1:40:00] and go to isaac the point is not the
[1:40:03] relationship
[1:40:07] the point is not just to stay in that
[1:40:10] stage of the relationship
[1:40:12] the point is to get married so that you
[1:40:15] can reproduce
[1:40:17] christ himself again
[1:40:20] anything short of that is rebecca on a
[1:40:23] camel out in the middle of nowhere
[1:40:25] running around with all her bracelets
[1:40:26] and earrings
[1:40:32] the point is the marriage
[1:40:35] and that is exactly what brother random
[1:40:37] came
[1:40:38] in choosing of abraham as the seventh
[1:40:40] mile angel the same angel
[1:40:42] that showed john the city descending out
[1:40:45] of god
[1:40:45] descending from from god out of heaven
[1:40:48] as a bride adorned for her husband
[1:40:51] the same seventh angel
[1:40:54] is the same one that declared me and you
[1:40:57] that revealed me and you to ourselves
[1:41:02] that's what choosing of a bride was all
[1:41:03] about was to reveal you to you
[1:41:08] so that you could be faithful and chosen
[1:41:11] and put your faith in him not fend for
[1:41:14] yourself
[1:41:15] because if you really know you are the
[1:41:17] bride of jesus christ
[1:41:20] why do you need to take care of yourself
[1:41:24] in the natural if you really know who
[1:41:27] your husband is
[1:41:28] and you have faith in him why do you
[1:41:30] need to try to fend for yourself
[1:41:32] in any aspect financially emotionally
[1:41:35] physically
[1:41:36] whatever it's across the board
[1:41:40] we have to put all of our faith in him
[1:41:42] don't
[1:41:43] fend for yourself because the struggles
[1:41:47] are coming
[1:41:48] the struggles are here the struggles are
[1:41:51] coming
[1:41:53] don't run back to mama and papa
[1:41:56] do not run back to your own reasoning do
[1:41:59] not try to fend for yourself
[1:42:03] trust in your husband
[1:42:06] the revealed word
[1:42:09] let's pray together precious lord jesus
[1:42:16] father help us lord
[1:42:21] help us lord i will make the same
[1:42:23] mistake that eve made in the garden
[1:42:26] lord we are so degraded
[1:42:30] in our hybridization that it is just a
[1:42:33] miracle and your supernatural keeping
[1:42:36] power
[1:42:37] that we are even in our right minds lord
[1:42:41] the world has descended into hell
[1:42:45] into pure insanity and chaos
[1:42:48] and it all stems back to one thing
[1:42:52] to one woman tried to make something
[1:42:55] happen
[1:42:56] herself lord let us not be that woman
[1:43:00] let us not make that same mistake and we
[1:43:03] thank you lord
[1:43:04] that you predestinated us not to
[1:43:08] or we would there would be no way around
[1:43:10] that we have
[1:43:11] no capacity to keep ourselves
[1:43:15] but we are so grateful that you have
[1:43:18] predestinated us
[1:43:20] not to make that fall
[1:43:23] and as such you had to restore the
[1:43:26] judges and the counselors
[1:43:27] and the ministry to give us this word
[1:43:31] that you sent us a prophet to reveal
[1:43:34] yourself through
[1:43:35] so that we would not make that same
[1:43:37] fatal mistake
[1:43:38] that we could recognize our husband the
[1:43:41] revealed word
[1:43:42] and that we could come out of a
[1:43:44] laodicean condition
[1:43:45] and that we could enter completely into
[1:43:48] you and just
[1:43:49] rest in you to get into heavenly places
[1:43:52] and
[1:43:52] allow you to fight our battles to allow
[1:43:54] you to feed us to allow you to clothe us
[1:43:57] to allow you to shelter us lord
[1:44:01] father i pray as we would come to the
[1:44:02] close of this service
