[0:36] [Applause]
[0:39] we are candidates for the new deal
[0:41] what is the new deal you just stop
[0:44] everything you end everything and he
[0:46] comes and takes over and it's not you
[0:49] nmo forget about yourself just surrender
[0:51] to him let him come and live in you and
[0:54] let him do what he wants to be done and

[1:02] the other deal of the law lord i know
[1:05] the ten commandments i know the the laws
[1:07] of the torah i know this i know the
[1:10] message i wrote this quote i read this
[1:12] one i know this quote the prophet said
[1:14] is and then i was but he also said it is

[1:26] minds
[1:27] [Laughter]
[1:30] we are now in the new deal
[1:33] the new deal is you stop everything
[1:36] you receive with the word the word has
[1:38] to come and the word has to be very new
[1:40] in its fullness and the word is faith of
[1:43] itself
[1:45] can imagine when the word believes
[1:47] itself
[1:49] when the word believes itself
[1:51] and when the word manifests itself
[1:54] then when the word controls itself and
[1:57] when the word in you moves the way it
[2:00] wants to move when the word shows its
[2:03] glory when the word trusts power and
[2:06] then you are sitting there just saying
[2:08] amen do it lord hallelujah thank you
[2:11] lord thank you jesus it's you now lord
[2:15] me i'm a failure continue lord
