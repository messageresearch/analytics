book of daniel chapter 2. and we'll read verse 31. praise the lord daniel chapter 2 verse 31 thou o king saulst and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was a fine gold his breast in his arms silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou saw was still that a stone was cut out with cut out without hands which smoked the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them into pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken the pieces together and be and become like the chaff of the summer threshing floor and the wind carried them away and that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth amen let's just bow our heads their heavenly father we thank you lord for this reading of the scriptures lord we thank you and we've allowed to read the scriptures lord we're thankful lord more than reading lord we're trusting in you to give us understanding of what we read lord i pray that you would unlock the word to us that you

amen you can be seated praise the lord we had a wonderful time at the wedding yesterday and it's been announced already but it was nice to see you know jonathan and esther mary and and it was it was a good time so we appreciate all those that came out i want to remind everybody that today is communion service so we're going to announce the time at the end of service and our brother benjamin siebel is going to be ministering for us this evening so it'd be wonderful if you all could return for the ministry and for the communion also keep brother kyle in prayer he and his family are having he's having the last service out in fresno california today and they'll be traveling back next week so keep them in prayer and that'll be wonderful we want to take a look if we could open up the powerpoint i want to continue on in the seal series and look at the fourth seal and this is a little bit strange this was surprising to me that in the fourth seal we'd find thyatira because thyatira is the fourth church age and so i wanna i want to just teach on this i'm going to try my best to go slow and just teach and every time i want to go slow and teach i end up going really really fast and i feel like i mess everything up and i feel horrible the rest of the day but i'm determined that i'm going to slow down and we're going to read some scriptures together and look at this because i found this to be absolutely fascinating you know last week i had to i had to call and apologize to sister rebecca wholesale because she was interpreting in french for us some of you might know that the the uh our brothers and sisters the bondo family from africa have been joining us for the last couple of months and they need french interpretation and they came one day they didn't know that we had anybody that spoke french they just came they got our address from friends they showed up at church and they walked in the door and they met one of the deacons and they started to talk and all of a sudden brother emanuel walks in the door and we put the two together and brother manuel started interpreting back in the father's nursery interpreting the services in the french and now we've got the system over the uh over the headphones for them to hear and so that's been going really well i i kept thinking that i would take my time and go slow for brother emmanuel but i never did and and and so he's done a really wonderful job but then last sunday i'm preaching away and i notice that brother emanuel's family is not here but i don't have time to think about it i'm just preaching i just noticed they're gone and i noticed jaraya sitting by himself and and i didn't think about it till the service was over and i'm at home i said oh lord what have i done what have i done to our poor sister but you know what she did a great job so god bless you and i think what a blessing it is and how god puts pieces together to where we where we we don't interpret services in the french normally in a family who needs interpretation comes and we've got two interpreters in our church i just think god just knows what he's doing he knows how to direct his children he knows how to put the pieces together so god bless you thank you so much and i'm sure her mom could be a backup to the backup if we need her to be while she's here praise the lord god's just good to us so we miss having brother emanuel down here on the floor we miss his amens we miss the shout but we he's working in the service of the lord so god bless him up there we should just open up the window there so he can just shout hallelujah so we can all hear it amen so we want to we want to look at the fourth seal i want to do just a little review with a couple excuse me a couple of quotes here first one is in the breach between the seven church age and the seven seals i just want to keep this in our mind i don't ever want to lose this so now when we go to breaking these seals we're going to see it goes plum back in the scriptures all the way back for each one of these seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right there in these seals every mystery of the bible lays in these seals we don't want to forget that we don't want to lose track of that every mystery in the bible lays in these seals and the seals cannot be broke until that time let's look at look a couple things these are refreshers but i want it to stay fresh in your mind and questions and answers from 1964 this is in in august of 1964. the question says have the seven thunders which equal seven mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the seven seals but are yet not known to us as the thunders yet brother brandon says no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was all about all right the seven thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was john knew what it was but he was forbidden to write him he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh church age so that should clear everything up for us that the thunders have been revealed amen that that that was the thunders was the revelation of the seals and so it's it's all clear before us but look at this quote in the latest in church age out of the church age book it says now this messenger of malachi 4 and revelations 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mystery of the seven thunders in revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals does that clear it up that should be crystal clear now look at the next statement so we know we know that malachi 4 revelations 10 7 has already come we know that we know that that seventh church age messenger has been here he's fulfilled these scriptures and he he's come and he's passed off the scene and he says he's going to do two things he's going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and he's going to reveal the mystery of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals now listen what this will do it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers this is really important this was not the first pull and second pull that did nothing to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers that was to attract the attention of the rainbow trout they attacked attention of the children of god showing that god was on the scene but it wasn't the healing ministry it was not the campaigns that did nothing to fulfill malachi 4. the fulfillment of malachi 4 is found in revelations 10 and in revelations 10 when the seventh church age messenger when he reveals the mystery truths the seven thunders the voices of god that were contained in the seven seals when he does that it's those mystery truths the revelation of the entire bible remember these seven seals the the mystery of the entire bible lays in those seven seals the fullness of redemption of the seed of god coming into earth and living their life all the way through and being redeemed and how they would be redeemed and called back where they came from what their purpose is on earth what they're going to afterwards these mystery truths it's these mystery truths of the seals as what literally turns the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers it wasn't god sent a prophet that's not going to do it it wasn't it wasn't brother branham was a mighty man of god that's not doing it it wasn't the healing prophecy it wasn't it wasn't showing the signs it was the sign of the messiah to get your attention to listen to what he was saying but it's the mystery truths being revealed that are literally turning your heart back to the faith of the fathers it's not turning your heart just back to oh i love the fathers and i appreciate paul so much it's turning you back to the faith that was in paul the faith that was in the pentecostal fathers and what is turning you back to that faith it literally it's the literally the revelation contained in the seven thunders that's why to ignore this is to ignore the message there's no way your heart if you if you ignore the seals and you ignore the revelation of the seven thunders you're ignoring the very thing that is supposed to turn your heart back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers hallelujah who can testify to that in your own life saying studying these seals is literally moving me in faith it is literally turning me back to a greater faith than i've ever had before i mean not not just reading through the seals really quick and saying oh that that covered the church ages no but actually seeing the mystery truths that that were in those seals what my brother branham was was bringing out and laying out and revealing the entire bible how many can say that it's literally turning me to a higher faith literally it's not it's not i'm straining it's not i'm groaning it's the word it's the revelation of the word that is literally taking me right back to the faith of the father i have greater faith now than i've ever had in my life what is it greater revelation greater unfolding i'm seeing what was already laying there i'm seeing what's already been given to us but i'm seeing it more clearly and in seeing it more clearly i'm operating in a level higher than i've ever operated in before i say god open my eyes to see all that you have for me these divinely revealed mysteries that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers oh i don't know i don't know about you but i like saying that because it's it's what's been given to us in the seals that are literally turning our hearts back to the pentecostal fathers we know that the the pale horse rides in the fourth seal this is spiritual death it's also natural death but we're looking at spiritual death and it's the incarnate devil the prophet of god says in the four seal oh my notice he gave her a space to repent but she didn't do it he's done it again she won't do it her rejection away her rejection makes a perfect way for satan to come into her and be incarnate that's right incarnate himself right in her because she rejected the word and that's exactly the same thing that the protestant church becomes a harlot is because she rejects the vindicated truth of the word of god and that gives the devil a place to come right in and incarnate himself and he will make an image into the beast when they can consolidate together right yonder now and go on and do just exactly what he said now i want you to notice i want to i'm breaking this down for a reason brother branham starts off talking about the catholic church and what what happened to them and how the devil came right into the church amen and then he talks about the protestants doing the same thing so brother random is establishing a pattern and he's showing the repeat of the pattern in the protestants there's a pattern established in the catholic church and the pattern will repeat in the protestant movement and so we want to catch that and understand that because it's going to help us as we move on so he says whatever the catholic church did amen she rejected the word and it made a perfect way for him to incarnate himself into her and to who the catholic church and the protestant church by her rejection will make her a mental harlot just like her mother the she becomes a harlot by rejecting the vindicated truth of the word and it gives the devil a place to come right in and incarnate himself in her and when he does he'll make an image unto the beast which we know as a system of the world council of churches make an image into the beast when they can consolidate together right yonder now and go on and do just exactly what he said so we see the battle plan we see that satan is working through these four horses it's the same man on each horse these are not four horse riders these are four horses or four powers or four different ways he will deceive the church and it's the same rider riding each horse as he moves down through but we remember his objective was always to get to the fourth horse now you're gonna find the fullness of satan comes in the fourth age and the fourth horse and the fourth beast it's always in the fourth and that's what we're looking at now but god amen god is bringing back and whenever satan has a power riding god has a power to combat it comes in as compromise god sends out the pure word to keep from compromise when he comes in this persecution god sends an anointing of an ox where we can lay down our lives when he sends deception and darkness and keeping the word from the people till they have no understanding he brings godly wisdom as a man amen and these three things together bring us to the eagle so i want to look at daniel again i hope we still have our bibles in daniel let's go back to daniel chapter 2. now i want you to watch this number four this is an important number always watch the fourth as we go on and i want to establish something really quickly here i'll just skip to it in the message as i was with moses so i will be with thee the prophet of god says now last evening we were journeying with the children of israel all the way from egypt until we got into kedish oh what a great lesson what a great thing as we typed the natural church to the spiritual church god dealing with israel in the natural with the church in these days as he's calling out of the gentiles of people for his name he's dealing with them in the spiritual as he dealt with them in the natural just parallel one to the other now this is important to realize that god has laid down a pattern with israel and that's why brother branham would come and preach the third exodus because he's pointing to the first exodus as laying down a shadow and now in the natural church which was israel and now it's going to be completed by the spiritual church so whatever happened was just a shadow of things to come he says god dealing with israel the natural and he deals with the church in the spiritual just parallel one to the other all that god did with them and all that god did for them and all they did in response falls to us as an example and we see so far the word has been carried out exactly the same you got that so when when you want to find out what's going on you look at what has been and the pattern never changes so it's really important to follow that through that god what he's doing to natural church israel god is going to do it says here what he did for what he did with them all that he did for them and what they did in response falls to us as an example and we see so far the word has been carried out exactly the same it's been identical to what has happened i mean even solomon said there is nothing new under the sun all things that are things that have been there's nothing new that is happening friends these things have already happened there's just different places with different names and different people but these things have happened before and they're happening again right here among us and that's what makes these that's what the revelation in these seals ties the whole scriptures together because now you see it's the same spirit brother branham said spirits don't die so these spirits these fallen angels that fell from the battle in heaven they've never died it's not like it's not like they went and they corrupted the the the hebrew church and now they set back and they went on vacation and they're drinking tea and they've got nothing else to do because they fulfilled their purpose they're the same demons that corrupted them in the first exodus are the same demons that's corrupting the children of god in this exodus one was to a natural lineage called israel and one is to a gentile called out people so we find out that they run parallel one parallels the other and we've got to keep this in our minds so that we understand where we're at even the apostle paul when he's speaking of the exodus and those that fall away in first corinthians 10 verse 11 he says now all these things happen unto them for examples they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come so to the people to whom the ends of the world have come all the things that were written in the old testament were for our example in our admonition so that we can look at that and see what happened and we can avoid the same catastrophe so let's look back here in daniel 24 we just read you know nebuchadnezzar had a dream and in this dream he saw this image and and nobody could interpret it he was going to kill all the wise men but daniel interceded and said give me the night and god gave him the interpretation and so we find that that we picked it up here in 24 31 and we read down through and and he's talking about four different stages or four different things in this image the head of gold and it had a breast and arms of silver and it had uh uh what was it that it said it was thighs a belly in his thighs of brass and his legs of iron and his feet part of iron part of clay so there's four four different stages to this this uh image and so he says and i want to pick it up in verse 34 thou saw was till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron clay and break them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broke into pieces together and become like the chaff of the summer threshing floor and the wind carried them away and no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king thou o king or the king of kings for the god of heaven hath given the kingdom power and strength and glory and who wheresoever the children of men dwell and the beast of the field and the fowls of the heaven that he giveth unto thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them over all thou art this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all things shall it break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou saw us the feet and toes part of the potter's clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou saws the iron mixed with the miry clay and as the toes of the feet were part iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and where else thou saws iron mixed with the mighty clay thou shall mingle themselves with the seed of the men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and shall stand forever for as much as thou saw us the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure i love that when a prophet speaks the dream is certain and the interpretation of is sure this is going to happen and nothing will stop this from happening now he's talking about these these four kingdoms and in in the the daniel gives the interpretation that they are four kingdoms amen and we see babylon that was replaced by medo-persia was replaced by greece which was replaced by rome and rome is the fourth kingdom now we see this is all talking about natural israel because in natural israel they the jerusalem was trodden down by four gentile nations amen assyria came and led israel captive but those were the 10 tribes to the north they didn't touch jerusalem jerusalem was trodden down by these four gentile powers and so we know that that that it started with babylon babylon carried them away captive and and they carried out from the treasury of of the temple and all these things out of jerusalem and it came down medo-persia had dominion and then greece had dominion and then rome and rome finally in 70 a.d trampled jerusalem under foot and then tramped him under foot and you're going to see how important this terminology is as we get into the book of revelation and later in daniel that this fourth kingdom will trample under feet because the fourth kingdom is defeat now remember satan can only copy what god does right because there was a prophecy back in genesis 3 amen that the the seed of the woman shall bruise the head amen of the serpent and the serpent shall bruise his heel meaning the serpent's going to be trodden under the feet of jesus christ remember we pick it up and the apostle paul says amen and the god of peace amen shall destroy or bruise the the bruised serpent under your feet shortly and so now the feet of god the the feet of god and flesh is going to trample down the serpent so what is what is the serpent trying to do what is the beast trying to do he's trying to build something that will trample underfoot god's kingdom everything runs on parallel tracks friends whenever you see this you can just see that the devil all he is is a copier of what god does he's just copying what god does now the fourth kingdom is the one we want to pay close attention to because brother bam tells us and we'll read it here in a minute this this natural kingdom turned from a natural kingdom to a spiritual kingdom and that this kingdom goes all the way to the end of the world and to the end of the world system as we know it now it goes all the way to the end and is finally destroyed with the stone that is cut out of the mountain without hands so here we have a stone and and remember the temple of solomon was built with stones and that you are lively stones built into a spiritual household so you know that you are the stones amen that were cut out of the earth that were brought together to make the habitation of god the dwelling place of god but there's a chief cornerstone that's been cut out and that and the cornerstones become the head of the corner amen so he's the formation of the cornerstone he's also the headstone in the pyramid and this is jesus christ only jesus christ wasn't the product of a man and a woman he is a stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands god himself amen produced the embryo and put it amen into the womb of the woman and this stone was not touched by man it did not cut out of the mountain by man's hands like you and i we come through natural birth but jesus came a different way he was the stone that was cut on the mount without hands and this stone is the stone that will strike the image not in the head not in the arms but in the feet because at the end time it's the feet that are in play and it's amazing how the stone hit them at the feet and when it hit the feet the whole image is grounding the powder you know this is not logical when you look at it physically you can't hit it in the feet but the feet all the kingdoms move down and just keep coming out down into the feet and when you destroy the feet you've destroyed the whole thing so the feet is going to be the roman empire and and brother brahma explains it clearly it's split into western and eastern there's two legs and it goes down and mingles into the miry clay and when it mingles into the clay that means it separates the kingdom separates and the iron moves out and mixes in the clay which is people because you're we're made of clay but it said it doesn't ever cleave to the people this kingdom it may look like it's being friendly this roman catholic church like it loves the people but remember it doesn't actually mingle with the clay this iron is just mixed in with the clay but hey it's got its own agenda and it's not for the clay using the clay amen and it separates out and it dominates over all the nations of the earth we're going to read some of that so you can catch that and see that but just remember it's the fourth kingdom and the fourth kingdom goes all the way through until finally it's destroyed by jesus christ in the seventh week of daniel he says now what's happened the head of gold was nebuchadnezzar which he interpreted another king shall come and he be in fear to thee which was darius the medo-persian taking the gentile kingdom over next came and after the medo-persian was what the greeks alexander the great and so forth the grecian took the kingdom over then what took over the greeks the romans and who's ruled the gentile world ever since romans now that was iron notice rome exists to the end because it went to the end of the toes and he's seen mud clay and that's people what we're made out of and iron the strength of rome run in every one of these nations and rome has strength in every nation under heaven and the second seal he says tell me russia don't reign over all we don't reign over all there's only one king that reigns over everything like that nebuchadnezzar's iron running out to every one of them toes and it's rome rome don't do it as a nation it does it as a church so that's what we're looking this fourth kingdom turned amen from from the the the emperors it turned to the popes it turned from the national power of rome into the religious power of the catholic church so so we just want to want to look at a couple of things here don't forget we want to talk about thyatira so we see that these four powers or these four anointings of the antichrist spirit that would come and defile the church ages they run over the entire length of the church ages we know that it comes out as a white horse and moves to the red and this covers the duration of the of the seven church ages or approximately the last 2000 years and it covers that in the in the seventh one or the fourth horse rider is the one there's a one that rides through tribulation and the one that's ultimately stored or destroyed and it's the devil incarnate and a one-man person and a person called the beast and god sends his anointings to combat that and that covers the entire church age but brother graham's going to say something in the fourth seal that's going to be a little tricky so i want you to pay close attention now i want to back up and i want to show you that this is absolutely the truth these four anointings cover the seven church ages and these four godly anointings of the holy ghost they cover the seven church ages so brother branham is going to say something different than that in just a second something different than he's been saying but he's not changing his mind on this he's trying to show us a pattern and whenever the prophet of god does that if you ever read the scripture and read the message and two and two don't equal four just wait there's something laying there that our our little brains can't compute at this time but at the right time under the right conditions when it's needful god will just open your eyes and take the scale away and all of a sudden you'll see it and it'll be perfect so i don't i don't want you to when you hear what's coming next i don't want you to think we mean anything different than this brother branham was clear these four anointings these four horses ride to the seven church ages and these anointings cover that at two but he's gonna change his tone here for a minute because he's trying to teach us something he's trying to show us something and the third seal says now watch we are where we are at tonight the other church age now where come down to the third church age now just exactly on the third church age is just exactly like the third horse got that that's not what he said before right the third horse is the black horse and it doesn't start riding until the fourth to the fourth church age right and it rides on through till the pale horse and in the end of laodicean church age so he's saying something different he's saying now the the third the third age is the third horse and that would make the first age the first horse the second age the second horse or red horse and the third age the black horse he's saying something different than what he said before now the first church age what was it the nicolaitans had a doctrine just the first one all right and then the first thing we know this nicolaith and doctrine it became sanctioned and was right went into action and they crowned this fellow then this spirit antichrist became incarnate and a man and we find out later on he becomes incarnate devil too the demon goes away and the devil comes in and just as the church this kind of antichrist church progresses so has the bride come along with different things through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost just moving right on just like that only they take their revival first and the church is taking it last so they take their revival first the church takes their revival last look what he says next their first three years first three stages of them that went into the dark age the third three stages comes the church out from justification sanctification baptism holy ghost incarnate god made manifest among us here he comes in as the antichrist as the false prophet then the beast then in dark age and the church comes out that dark age justification sanctification baptism holy ghost incarnate word the way now so brother rem says those first three stages first three ages brought them to dark ages and from dark ages the next three stages brings the restoration of the bride incarnate word the way now so we see the first three church ages brings them to the dark age that's why brother ben this third age is that black horse and the last three stages he now he's not talking about the whole church age and the whole foreign things he's showing something that actually happened in history something happened in the first three church ages that brought him to thyatira which is the fourth which is dark age and something happened coming out of the dark age that restored the bride restored the church back again so he's trying to lay down a pattern and here's the pattern that he lays down white horse red horse black horse he said that third age that third age is that third horse anybody hear him say that besides me so i'm not off on the deep end but it's different than what he said before right there's a reason then he said those last three those last three are justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost first three and last three that leaves this one right here in the middle he talked about the first stages he talked about the last three but he didn't talk about this middle that's the dark ages the first three go to dark ages the last three come out of dark ages but that's thyatira amen brother brenham says a lot about thyatira in the fourth seal he says now notice now remember this antichrist himself being the man his bride which is the church was given a space to repent and she did not do it in the church age thyatira remember it see she's given space to repent but she didn't do it where in thyatira so let's go to genesis 2 and look at thyatira and we're going to find why brother branham is showing us this and pointing us to this in the scriptures now i want to stop and explain something just a minute when we see the four kingdoms head of gold breast and arms of silver belly and thighs of brass and legs of iron we see the four kingdoms those are four natural kingdoms that are going to trample down jerusalem but in the fourth kingdom remember everything runs in four in the fourth kingdom in rome under the roman church system then you have four horse riders so within the four you have four so when the when the when it moves from pagan rome to papal rome then you go right back through four stages again so you come down four stages in the fourth stage you go through four stages and it's always four the devil's always coming to his fullness in four all right revelations chapter two verse 18. and unto the angel of the church and thyatirite these things sayeth the son of god who had his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass i know thy works and thy charity and service and faith in thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou suffers that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants and to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast into a bed in them that commit adultery with her into great tribulations except they repent of their deeds and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works so now brother branham comes and he points back to thyatira and when you go back in the church age and you read the admonition to thyatira now you see they've come to jezebel religion this is thyatira is the full power of the catholic church when you actually look at the the years of thyatira 606 to 15 20. i don't remember exactly why this is the peak of the catholic power when the catholic church came to full power and united church and state together because it's the height of the roman catholic empire the roman catholic empire was political amen and then the roman catholic church was religious and they were united together in thyatira and they came to the full power of the catholic church but coming out of that we would come to the reformation and the catholic church as united church and state would never be in the same power it was there it began to weaken and begin to minister so brother branham is showing that what happened to the catholic church is patterned in these first four church ages but then he's showing that the pattern will repeat again but it will repeat in the protestant churches because they're going to come right to their own tire they're going to come right to spiritual death and he comes to jezebel and he ties it together in thyatira and in thyatira he says you i have a problem you suffers that woman jezebel that says she's a prophetess and is not and is teaching fornication and idolatry and all of these things that's exactly what the catholic church was teaching and he says i will take her and cast her into a bed and those that commit fornication with her into great tribulation that's tying us right over to revelation 17 and 18 the judgment of the it's in thyatira it's already prophesied in thyatira that he's going to take this jezebel which is the catholic church and he's going to cast her amen into a bed brother graham said hell and those that committed fornication with her into great tribulation that's the great tribulation and then he comes and he says and i will kill her children what are her children the protestant daughters he's going to take this jezebel and in thyatira she's judged but then he's going to take and he's going to kill her daughters so the pattern repeats friends now see this black horse then after he refused to repent and thyatira changes his ride from a black horse to a pale one death for his last ministry see after he refused to repent where and thyatira changes his ride from black horse to pale one death for his last ministry he's speaking here of the catholic church but the same thing has to repeat in our day so you can look at thyatira and whatever was in thyatira you can expect to see it now oh i hope that we can get to this and make it plain there you are thyatira age the dark age his black horse now turns to death for his last age we know that that the palers actually doesn't ride till the end of laodicea we understand that and brother branham understands that he hasn't forgotten what he's taught us what he's showing us is the pattern of a cycle of death where a church will come out in seeming innocency and begin to just deviate ever so slightly from the word but it'll follow this pattern through white horse then the red horse then it comes to full power and under thy attire it comes to full power and is given a space to repent but she would not repent and now he's he's put judgment upon her and thyatira and that's why you see the catholic church fall and the protestant church rise but the protestant church is going to do exactly exactly to the t what the catholic church did they're going to come out in innocence they're going to come out with the word and then they're going to begin to organize and they're going to take that nicolaitan spirit that started the whole ball rolling in the catholic church and they're going to bring it right in amongst their banks they're going to have schools and they're going to have priests and they're going to put one preacher over top another preacher and they're going to divide themselves into different camps amen they're going to do the same thing by developing their system and they're going to fall into the same exact place that the catholic church fell to that's why the catholic church came amen remember the holy roman empire was a different entity seemingly than the roman catholic church one was religious one was a collection of nation-states bound together under an emperor called the holy roman empire and it was the pope who first crowned the emperor and it was the unification of church and state but the holy roman empire the political union of these nations it fell apart that's why there's prophesied in the scripture that there's going to be an image erected to the beast and what's it going to be it's going to be a collection not of nations but a collection of denominations the world council of churches bringing about a collective force and going to unite it right back to the beast right back to the catholic church and when it does it's going to unify political and spiritual forces back together again what are we coming back to we are coming back to thyatira hallelujah hallelujah but praise god we've got an injection seat we've got our hand on the handle it's called the rapture of the church before too long we're going to see the system building and it's getting closer and closer but before they shut her up he's going to take her up he's going to pull the ejection seat and we're out of here friends but this whole world all of these church systems all these organizations they're going right back as fast as they can to the mother harlot dietary is the dark ages black horse now turns to death for this last ministry see how the church ages blend in with the seals just perfect then we know it's right the holy spirit makes no mistake he gave us a greater vindication the last time when we got the church ages done back there you know see the loving long-suffering of god before he passed judgment upon her he gave her a place to repent and it's in the name of the lord i say this he's give the protestant church the same thing she won't do it these messages shook everywhere and she won't do it brother ram said his message is shook everywhere and she won't do it she won't come back now i want to keep going with this pattern and i want you to see brother van priest a message called the restoration of the bride tree that this bride tree that came out in pentecost was eaten down through how many stages of insects four how many gentile powers to trodden down jerusalem four how many horse riders four it's always going to be for when it tries to destroy the seed another thing i want to mention and i just want you to keep in your mind whatever happens naturally to israel is what's happening spiritually to the church so when you see these four gentile powers and you see that the four gentile powers what are they doing they're trying to take jerusalem they're trying to snuff out jerusalem until finally rome tramples jerusalem completely down and destroys it in 78d what was the purpose coming through these four stages was to destroy jerusalem so coming through these coming through these four horse riders is to do what destroy heavenly jerusalem and story mount zion destroy the bride the whole intent is to destroy and trample underfoot the bride so what happens to israel is what's been happening to the church that's why in thyatira it got ate down to just a stump these these insects ate it down to just a stump but there was a promise of restoration let's look at joel if we turn in the bibles to joel we're going to see four stages again now joel's an interesting prophecy brother branham picks up joel and he teaches the message restoration of the bride tree which he refers to over and over and over again but in that the the literal prophecy in joel is physical to israel and it's spiritual to us the same exact prophecy is literal to them in a spiritual to us see literally the four stages of this insect that ate down it literally happened to israel through babylon medo-persia greece in in rome but spiritually it's happened to the church joel 1 verse 1 the word of the lord came to joel the son of pathwell hear this ye old men and give ear all you inhabitants of the land have this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the palmer worm hath left had the locust eaten and that which the locust hath left at the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm had left had the caterpillar eaten awake you drunkards and weep and howl all you drinkers all you drinkers of the wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth for a nation has come upon my land a strong and without number whose teeth are the teeth of a lion and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion he hath laid my vine waste and barked my fig tree he hath made it clean bare and casted away the branches thereof are made white so here he's talking about this great nation that comes with teeth like a lion and he's barked the vine tree and the vine is always israel israel was the vine that the husbandman planted and he digged about and he put a hedge about and he planted a choice vine and this nation came in and he barked it way do he stripped all the bark away from it and so it would die and that this literally happened to israel but it also literally happened to the church we're standing in a place now where we can look back and we can see the prophecies already been fulfilled and the prophecy is being fulfilled again a third time same prophecy so joel is speaking of natural and spiritual so we see these four in in the english they give them these names palmer worm locust canker worm caterpillar but it's really all locusts these are all locusts and these are different stages of development of the locust and they all eat this down until you get the thyatira until there's nothing left but a stump brother bam said now as he brought forth the first bride tree and the locust and palmer room was eaten down he is restoring the second tree bringing it up from them predestinated roots that cannot die they're standing by the rivers it's living in the waters it wouldn't show itself but it's there anyhow now it's starting notice the same insect as he restores back the same thing by the same way the first when that tree started to come forth out of catholicism was martin luther he preached justification the second angel was john wesley he preached sanctification luther preached justification just shall live by faith wesley preached sanctification second indefinite work of grace and then come the holy ghost just as he built the tree up the first time here he is restoring again in the same manner the second time so let's read joel chapter 2 together let's just go over to joel chapter 2. verse 23 joel 2 and 23 be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month brother brennan picks this up and he tells us the former rain was the teaching rain and the latter rain is the harvest rain that will fall out and brother ram takes this right to his ministry and they say the people are preaching we're in the latter rain he said how can you be in the latter until you've had the former rain and the former rain is a prophet that's supposed to come in this day and and teach the children of israel and when he comes then there'll be a ladder rain poured out and in the ministry there'll be a former and latter reign together poured out and so this prophecy is a prophecy to physical israel that also applies to the bride of jesus christ so let's read it again be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he has given you the former reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and because the former and latter rain is going to come together they were supposed to be rejoicing because the former rain and the latter rain is the teaching or planting rain and the harvest rain and it's showing here that when god restores he's going to restore quickly when he brings back he's going to re bring back quickly he's going to restore and there's going to come a time when when israel is going to come back into the land and quickly he's going to restore that that's going to be the former rain in the in the latter rain falling right together so that they can plant and harvest plant and harvest plant and harvest this is going to get good hopefully in a minute verse 24 and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil when this former ladder rain together all of a sudden you're going to have the seed word all over the place amen in the oil and the wine the holy ghost and the stimulation of revelation amen and the vats are going to be full of the wine and the oil and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm the palmer worm the the the caterpillar the palmer were my great army which i sent among you and you shall eaten plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed so god promised that he would bring back through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and he would restore back all the years that had been eaten it was all coming back now i want you to think of this prophecy as israel and the church running on parallel tracks because the the rome went in in 70 a.d and trodden down jerusalem and jerusalem had never been the same in israel had never been the same from that point on they were dispersed amongst all the nations israel itself turned into a wasteland an utter wasteland and jerusalem fell into arab hands and it was that way for for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years but there come a time and that time was around the second war war amen and it actually started in the first world war in the first world war there was a jew who helped finance the war for for england and in the thank you to that jew and some jews banded together to help finance the war they wanted to know what they could do to thank them and and there was a a a a a crime made or a plea he says if you want to thank us give a place for my people a homeland for the jewish people because friends they were dispersed there was no place for them and there there in world war one there was a decree sign called the belfast declaration and that declaration gave the jews because england was in control at that time of palestine gave them a homeland a place that they could return to but you could see it was just the beginnings coming back no now remember that came i can't remember the year it was 1918 1919 something like that that that was degree but remember there's parallel tracks here the war breaks out and as a thank you they've given a promised land but there's a prophet that's going to be born to the gentiles in 1909 and and though it's going to be a long time from there before we start to see things happening there's also this belfar declaration in world war one taking place in a similar time within a handful of years of one another because god is going to restore all the years that the palmer worm the cankerworm the caterpillar and the locust had eaten up and so you see these parallel tracks and then we come to world war ii and in world war ii we have the holocaust that takes place and and as a thank you or as a not a thank you but as a measure to the jews who suffered so much in world war ii the nations got together and decided to give them a nation and petition them off a piece of land that they could return to and have their own nation and so at the same time they're doing that the same time the prophet of god is getting a commission to begin his ministry to begin his first pool and second pool ministry and you see the two are coming up together what's he re doing he's restoring all he all the years that this palmer worm can't go he's doing it in the natural and he's doing it in the spiritual at the same time oh i just love this and then the prophet begins his is healing campaigns he begins the first full second pool ministry and we come all the way through and he comes up and and in the nation of israel it fights his battles it fights its war and it establishes itself in the homeland as its own nation and and these things are growing up together this is just miraculous to me that these things can be taking place at the exact same time that there's a prophet to the gentiles and he's bringing back the word amen as israel is taking back the land because the land to us is the same as the word to israel and they're taking back their land and what's happening and the scriptures say that the land responds to israel and israel went into a desert in a few years it begins to blossom like a rose because they couldn't they couldn't get anything to happen with this land egypt couldn't do anything with it england couldn't do anything with it the ottoman empire couldn't do anything with it the palestinians couldn't do anything with it for for a couple thousand years it laid desolate and wasted and turned to a desert and they didn't grow anything there they had some bedouins who had passed through and grazed a little bit of of cattle a little bit of goats and sheep and that's all they had they had nothing until the the true seed of god that the lineage that was supposed to be in that land when they started moving back into that land amen then the land became to flourish it began to open up and give its fruits and give its grass and give and now it's a fertile land because the word was laying desolate and the word would only respond to the children of god and it had been eaten down to that all we had was an understanding that there was a messiah and jesus died a couple thousand years ago didn't know where we came from didn't know where we're going didn't know what our purpose was we were scattered amongst the denominations but there come a call that was pulling out of the denominations bringing back into the homeland of people and this word was going to respond in this restoration to who to the people of god and all of a sudden the word the scripture has been laying there it's been desolate it's been trodden over and all of a sudden that one scripture is going to start producing fruits amen and now we move over to this book of the bible and it's going to start producing fruits and ruth has been laying there for thousands of years and nobody knew it was about a gentile bride hallelujah esther had been laying there for thousands of years and nobody knew that it was talking about a gentile bride until until the people start moving back under the restoration restoring back this is the prophecy of joel friends this is in your life and in my life this is the prophecy of joel taking place before our eyes you can read on jewish history and you can see with your eyes what's happening in the natural but hey i want to tell you something if you'll get into the message and talk to someone that's been around here amen since the 60s they'll tell you what's been happening in the supernatural and the spiritual they're running on parallel tracks same thing that trodden down jerusalem rome is the same thing that came through four stages of horse riders and trot down the church but i will restore saith the lord seals come in 1963 preaches the seals god has him prophesy again and he goes around and elaborates and brings so many truths as he preaches after the seals amen and then the prophet passes off the scene but in 1967 israel is in their homeland but they're not in jerusalem but after the seals are preached now something's got to further something's got to move for israel too because the bride's being moved into a different position after the opening of the seals amen it's coming back of mount zion it's coming back a holy jerusalem so now in 1967 the six day war breaks out and in that war israel takes back jerusalem hallelujah the holy city of god comes back the temple of god amen is not built but the land it comes back in 1967 do you see the parallel tracks there was a problem after they got there after they got the land after they got the temple mount after they got the city of david after they got it all back they gave it away for what for political peace still today there's an arab regiment that guards the temple mount and polices the temple mount not israel and we know in god's timepiece some more things have to happen but you see after the opening of the seals they take back jerusalem they come to the temple mount the soldiers stand there as they hoist the star of david up over the temple mount and soldiers heart and soldiers begin to weep and begin to cry and begin to sing begin to dance because why the hope of israel is in jerusalem amen the hope of the jewish people is in jerusalem everything that they they're taught to believe in everything that they were told to do centered around temple worship in jerusalem and here they they got it back but they're political re the leaders to keep peace and keep themselves in favor with the rest of the world they gave back control of most of [Music] jerusalem i wonder if things don't run on parallel tracks come to everything and then compromise a little bit for peace let down the bar a little bit just to have a little bit of peace this is the restoration but in this period of time israel's growing in strength growing in strength they have another war in 1973 and they win that one decisively and they're growing in strength and the bride is growing in strength taking more of the land amen amen cultivating the land pulling out of the land the resources that they need amen and now israel stands today a military powerhouse a wealthy nation an independent woman praise god think about where israel is today israel can fight her own battle she can defend herself she can feed herself she can clothe herself she's got industry amen she's got agriculture she they just found oil in israel and they found natural gas in israel what's happening israel's becoming totally self-sufficient where israel does not need anything from any other nation and anything from anywhere else to survive and the bride of jesus christ is coming and to be an independent woman where she doesn't need any other theological understanding she doesn't need help from anybody else from any other denomination she's come back and she's cultivating her land her word everything she has need of is right here and everything israel needed oil it's in the land gas it's in the land fruits and vegetables it's in the land textiles it's in the land amen meat it's in the land it's all in the land and they're coming back to complete independence and the bride is coming back to complete independence because she's digging around in her land she's irrigating it with the spirit amen she's cultivating all the time in the land and the land now is producing everything that she has need of what is this this is joel's prophecy being fulfilled now we're we're in the former and in the latter falling together this has been going on for just over 50 years look at the thousands and thousands of years that man have been on the planet and look what's happened to israel in just over 50 years if you if you read anything on israel and you it's mind-blowing what has happened there is a people oh my goodness there's a people who whose language had utterly died there's a language of faith in the bride that had utterly died there was a language that had utterly died it was only held together through some documents into the rabbinical order through the priest amen there was a people with no nation no homeland no capital amen they had no organization to unite them together they had they had no system to keep them tied together they were totally dispersed totally on their own without a language without a headquarters without a national home with nothing that now their language has revived so never in the history of the world has an ancient language ever revived first time ever never in the history of world has a dispersed nation occupied for thousands of years by foreigners has it ever come back into the hands of the original owners that's never happened before what you're seeing has never happened before [Applause] i will restore all the years now she's an independent woman israel's totally independent becoming completely self-sufficient why because she's going to be cut off from the rest of the world and she's going to stand on her own and the bride is becoming totally self-sufficient why she was brought back under joel's prophecy to her land and she's been cultivating the land and the land is producing every single thing she needs there's nothing that we need to overcome in this age that doesn't come from our land tell you what friends i'm excited you just watch israel brother brahma said if you want to know what time we're in watch israel watch israel the church and the the church of natural the church spiritual israel and the church are running on these parallel tracks and this prophecy pertains to both we saw them go down into utter ruin through romanism trample them down into nothing and we saw the church get trampled down into nothing through romanism but there's a restoration been taking place and in the in the last time there will be a former latter rain falling together and the last time the prophet of god came and the former and the latter rain fell together and it's falling now friends the the desert is blossoming like a rose now israel israel is one of the main exporters of certain vegetables and fruit to the world israel is now feeding their enemies israel is now sending produce all over the world i mean if you eat a cucumber now it's got a pretty good chance it came from israel they they they're the number one exporter of cucumbers they export all kinds of fruits and vegetables and now the food is coming from the land how many times do you meet people amen and they have a need in their life and you've got some vegetables amen that come out of the word you got some fruit and now what is it now the denominations are eating from your hand now you're feeding amen you're not a desolate woman anymore you know who you are you've got your language restored your identities come back you've moved into your land you've cultivated your soil and not only do you have enough for you now you've got enough to go back and feed those old systems amen if they would just realize where they're getting their food from if the arabs and palestinians would just realize where they're getting their food from but they won't hallelujah if others could just realize where the food's coming from praise god see there was four stages to destruction four kingdoms four horse riders four insects four stages of the same insect all telling the same story brother ramen says notice the same insect that little rascal the same insect that started and killed the tree in the beginning started right back at them lutheran free branches but what it can't kill it it can't kill it because god has done said i will restore the insect started on luther to kill all the lutheran branches it came right over wesley and killed all the wesley branches but the main part of the tree keeps going because there's a prophecy that i will restore so i'll look at this it's laying in the fourth seal just as we wrap up but you see the way brother branham talks in the fourth seal he's showing he's not showing the entire church age he's showing the catholic system it moved through these first church ages and it came to death it came to the judgment of jezebel and thyatira in in revelation chapter 2. we just read that but then the same cycle has to repeat for the protestants so then you see the same cycle starts again it started for lutherans it started for wesleyan to start for pentecost it starts for every system that comes out comes out under the white horse and very quickly moves all the way down so this cycle is a repeating cycle in the church ages once for the catholics next for the protestants and at the end the protestants amen they will build a system an image to the beast and they'll connect it back to the mother amen and then the pope will sit on the throne the protestants are coming right back to thyatira right back to the unifying of church and state the holy roman empire the holy roman church united together when they had full power full control unquestionable authority and now this double cycle is bringing the protestant move under the world council churches bringing about an image to the beast we'll tie it right back to thyatira where there once again be a political and a religious unification and complete and absolute power will be restored to this system i thank god i won't be here see like he gave egypt he gave egypt place to repent what was that last plague was death that's the last plague that's hit the pentecostal church it's spiritual death she's dead that is in the name of the lord she's spiritually dead he gave her place to repent and she rejected it now she's dead she'll never rise again why is this so important for the pentecostals because that was the last stage that was laodicea and now brother branham's not saying there's any hope there's any resurrection he's saying she has already come to the fourth horse she's already come to spiritual death and this thing's going to tie right back into the catholic church but all the bugs that hell can turn loose on her will never stop her no communism catholicism no nothing else will stop it i will restore saith the lord all the man-made roman trees will never hang in there all the graves will never keep it there all the big denominational stones laying at the door will never keep it in there i will restore saith the lord there will be an easter i'll bring forth that same church in its same power same church in its same power i'll bring that bride out just like she was back there with the same signs the same fruit the same thing that they did i'll bring her back again when he says i'll bring her back again what is he talking about he's talking about the pentecostal fathers the first church this restoration brings us right back to this the restoration in israel is going to take it right back to the golden age of solomon when jesus christ sits on the throne but our restoration will take us right back to pentecost hallelujah i've skipped almost all my notes i don't even know if there's anything worth reading now praise god message be not afraid romanism and so forth eat that beautiful bride tree of christ down until it became a stump but god brought it right back out of that stump right up through these lutheran age right up through the wesleyan right up to the pentecostal wage and now it's in the evening light i will restore saith the lord all the years at the cankerworm caterpillar i will restore again that church in her beauty that church in her power when you look at israel and see the conditions she's in now you know israel when they first moved into their land they didn't have any planes they didn't have any guns they had to immediately fight a war and they had nothing to fight a war with so they had to gather up what money they could scrape together and they had to buy whatever armament they could buy and smuggle in and they weren't even allowed to have it before they were declared as a nation because these these countries couldn't sell planes and and and bombs and and guns to a country that wasn't a nation and they weren't a nation yet and so before they had to sneak it in and smuggle it in and they finally got it in and they they bought from this one and they bought from this one and they bought from that and they brought together all that they could piece together with their meager means and all these they got some planes from here some guns from there and they put it together and they defended themselves and they become a nation then when they become a nation they would buy from the us and buy from this and buy from that but now one of israel's main industries is weapons they are one of the main exporters of weaponry in the world why because nobody's going to take israel they've done been there they've been down the road of desolation they've been down the road of ruin they've been down the road of separation into denominations and they're not going back that way they've been under the trampling down of the roman system and they're not going back that way and the bride of christ is not going back either she's been given a sword and a sword has been placed in her hand and she's not piecing together little stones from here and a little rock out of out of methodism and a little rock out of baptism doctrine she's come to where she's been given the king sword it's been placed in her hand and she's been given the faith a strong hand of faith to wield the sword because she's not going back into denominationalism she's not going to be trampled down by rome anymore she's not going to accept any false doctrines she's come back to the word and she's staying in her land and there's nothing going to drive her off of her land it's not going to be disappointment or discouragement or family issues or job problems nothing is going to drive her off of her land she's already been down that road and she's not going again a huge percentage of israel's finances goes to defense they're constant on alert for the enemy constantly wary of the enemy coming in they are literally surrounded by demon forces want to paint a picture for you and if you just be patient with me i've gone a little bit slow today but it's for a reason i want to paint a little bit of a picture brother branham tells us that under the sixth trumpet he says the sixth trumpet is world war ii i mean ever heard him say that sixth trumpet is world war ii and under the sixth trumpet two hundred thousand thousand demons were released i don't have the quotes in front of me you just have to trust me on this and he says it in the feast of trumpets he said where were they released to to that hitler and eichmann group and so you see hitler's army now what is it it's anointed by two hundred thousand thousand demons if you watch if you watch uh the german nazi army in world war ii their technological advancement was staggering their abilities were supernatural the the the rate at which they developed weaponry was supernatural the rate in which they conquered was supernatural i mean it is staggering what happened in just a few years time what was it the seventh the sixth trumpet blew and two hundred thousand thousand demons came and where did they come to the hitler eichmann group they came into germany and what was their whole purpose what was the whole purpose of two hundred thousand thousand demons coming their whole purpose was to stop the seed to kill the jews it made no sense absolutely made no sense for the german army to spend so much time and resources on the holocaust it was ludicrous it caused them to lose the war they said they give so much time and energy to maintaining to building and maintaining concentration camps and sending food and soldiers and trains and transport it was an utter waste of time now you can see the spirit behind it what was the spirit behind it brother branham said it's the same roman spirit that trampled out jerusalem the same roman spirit had moved into nazi germany and in nazi germany 200 000 000 demons were released and anointed anointed the nation to bring about a persecution against the jews to totally and utterly destroy the jews then brother menom starts telling us what happened after the war now remember the church in israel on parallel tracks do we believe that now brother branham said those two hundred thousand thousand demons after the war they didn't go back into the pit where they came out of so where did they go they went into the ecclesiastical ranks and what are they anointing the ecclesiastical ranks for the same exact purpose to stop to trample out holy jerusalem to stop the bride of jesus christ there's two hundred thousand thousand demons brother bam said come against the denomination no to come against the bride and so now israel has to be totally vigilant totally on their guard because of enemies demon spirits all around them trying to penetrate take back their land move them off of their land take back what's been given to them and they're constantly on alert they're constantly digging in the soil developing their resources amen developing their defenses so they can keep these demons at bay why because they know the same demon powers that tried to annihilate them are still there still talking about driving them into the sea still talking about wiping them out but where did those demons go after the war they went to the ecclesiastical realms to what to bring about an attack on the bride so we need to be on constant vigilance because we're surrounded by demon powers subtle demon powers not coming at you with a bazooka or a grenade not running at you with a knife amen but a demon power that will anoint amen somebody to come and just whisper something in your ear or somebody or something to come up on your cell phone or or something to come between you and your wife one of the demons trying to destroy the bride demons that their only purpose is to trample out holy jerusalem and we've got to be constantly on our guard constantly developing our weaponry sharpening the sword and sharpening the sword and char there's no rust gathering on any guns in israel none of their tanks are tarnished but everything's in a state of ready everything they practice they drill amen they they make sure everything's ready everything's as it should be we could be attacked at any time from any direction and brothers and sisters we could be attacked at any time from any direction but that's why we got to keep sharpening the sword amen keep it oiled up with the spirit amen keep ourselves in a state of readiness dig in the land become self-sufficient amen become fed from the land watered from the land clothed from the land and protected by the land why because i will restore all that has been eaten down in israel in the church or on parallel tracks she's an independent woman independent from all the rest she's not looking to anybody for support she doesn't need a headquarters she doesn't need financial support she doesn't need to tell somebody to tell her what to believe or what she's been restored back into the land and everything she needs is coming from the land god bless you saints let's stand musicians if you could come oh so much i'd like to share with you so much more but there's just not time i know today was a lot of teaching a lot of charts and i didn't want to go too far with too much but i want you to see it's that fourth stage that brings death catholic church already went the protestant church is there now and they're going to tie it right back to thyatira the unification of the church and state that's why brother branham brings up thyatira and the fourth seal because the fourth seal is the fourth horse rider the fourth seal is the end of the gentile church the four seals when we go in a rapture and a fourth seal is when the power comes back to the beast and there's a unification of church and state it all comes back in the fourth seal and that's why brother branham points us to thyatira in the fourth shield and shows us jezebel and her children hallelujah how many appreciate these seals brother braham said we could preach every night on these seals and when he first said that i said how how but i'm starting to see that once you catch the pattern it runs through the whole scripture it runs from genesis to revelation because it's the same story over and over and over again and god has revealed it to you god has given it to you and the former rain and the latter rain are falling together and we're restored back to our land and this land only responds to the seed friends for almost 2000 years nobody could get the land of palestine to do anything it turned to rocks and sand and scrub bushes and they couldn't get it to produce and since the fall of pentecost the denominations couldn't get this to produce the life that was at pentecost bring it back to its lush greenness to its bearing fruit but this restoration of the bride tree is supposed to be fruit at the top of the tree again where the sunlight is shining and the restoration is to bring us back to the land and the land is going to produce the same fruit that it produced in the first bride tree it'll produce in this bridegroom we've seen it in the wave chief offering and we're going to see it when the full harvest comes the full grain comes to full harvest of charity god bless you friends let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this day lord we thank you for your word lord it equips us you positionally place us by your word every time now we know where we are lord we can look to your timepiece and see where we are god we know lord that that you are you are the one who restores you promise you'll restore we see you you've done it you see you've brought back the land you've brought it all back and you've given it all back to us lord you've placed it in our hands you've given a full revelation you've brought back perfect faith you've brought it all back to us but we just need to dig in the land lord we just need to trust that it will respond to the bride we need to cultivate lord and dig out springs of water and dig out amen irrigation and plant seeds lord and expect that it will produce what it said you said it will produce lord i pray that you keep building us up lord keep encouraging us lord help us to lay everything aside help us to be vigilant lord help us to be dedicated we love you lord jesus we ask for your blessing to be upon us as we go lord and have a time
