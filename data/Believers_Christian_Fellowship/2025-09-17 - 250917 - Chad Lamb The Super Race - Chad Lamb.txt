Do I have that everlasting joy within? Since he came and he took away my sin. And the moment that he blessed me, he made me fully whole with that everlasting joy in my soul. Amen. God bless you.

Keep you standing for one more song as we get ready for the special. Jill, if you'd come. Therefore, the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come with singing and to Zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head. Oh, therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come with singing unto Zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head. He can obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee awake. Therefore, thou redeemed of Lord shall return. Come with singing unto Zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head. Amen. An everlasting joy will be on their head. You can be seated tonight. This wasn't really a special. I'll confess I kind of drug everybody into this, but brother Sam said he was going to sing with me. So, I figured if if Brother Sam would sing with me, we'd just try this. And uh this this song kind of expresses the the joy in my heart that um kind of set me ringing today and thinking about the city of Zion. I'm just going to stand back here so I feel like I'm singing a special, but it's a special, but some of y'all probably know it. So, we're just going to ask you to sing it when I reach that city. If you'd pull that up on the projectors, number 222. And uh so thankful that the word has drawn us to that place and have have really having a place in that city. And that's really as I was thinking about that, I thought I'm so thankful that this city of Mount Zion that we that many talk about that many think about, it's a place they're going to, but I'm thankful that it's a place that I'm already possessing and beginning to dwell in and learning how to possess it and walk with our king. So, let's just if you know this song, you can sing this with us as we sing it. [Music] On top of Mount Zion is a city [Music] and the earth with its glory is the field. I shall look on its beauty in the morning when I reach that city on a hill. Oh that city on Mount Zion. Oh, a pilgrim, yet I love thee still. I'll not leave thee through the ages. When I reach that city on a hill, I'm invited to come home to that city. For the word says, whosoever will. And I'll come find mession for me waiting when I reach that city on the hill. Oh, that city on Mount Zion. No, a pilgrim yet I love thee. I'll not leave thee through the ages. When I reach that city on a hill, death will never molest me in that city. Never leave me lying cold in jail. And I'll enter to live up there forever. When I reach that city on a hill, oh that city on Mount Zion, go a pilgrim, yet I love thee city. I'll not leave thee through the ages when I reach that city on a hill. So I'll stay here until my Savior calls me, trying daily to perform his will. Then he'll say unto me, well done up yonder. When I reach that city on a hill, oh help us sing it. Oh, that city on Mount Zion. Though a pilot see and I'm not leaving through the agees when I reach that city on the Oh, let's try the first verse together. of Mount Zion is a city and the earth with its glory is a fail. And I shall look on its beauty in the morning when I reach that city on the hill. Oh that city on Mount Zion. Oh, yet I love thee still and I'll not leave the through the aes when I reach that city on a hill. Oh, that city or Mount Zion. Yet I love these still. And I'll not leave through the aes when I reach that city on a hill. Amen. Are you looking forward to reaching that city on the hill? Amen. We're so thankful for that city. Amen. for that calling to get there. Amen. Let's just go to the key of G and sing that. Since I saw my name in the book, you just have to stand with me tonight. Bear with me tonight in my my enthusiasm and my joy. I'm just looking forward to seeing him. I can't imagine what that's going to be like to be able to just fellowship with him. You got a you got a thought and you just want to worship and you can just go worship. How wonderful that's going to be. Amen. Since I saw my name in the book of redemption. Since I saw my name in the book. Oh, I'm in communion with Christ my redeemer. Since I saw my name in the book. Yes. Since I saw my name in the book. Oh, since I saw my name in the book, I in communion with Christ my redeemer since I saw my name in the book. Oh, just over in the glory land there with the mighty host.

Oh bread of heaven. Feed me till I overflow. Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this evening. Let's bow our heads together. Oh, heavenly father, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for the privilege of gathering once again. And God, as we're here, we've sung, Lord, our hearts have opened and sung to you praises, Lord, for you are worthy of all praise. And God, we come to the part of the service, Lord, where we're going to look into your word. And we ask God that you would give us the spirit of revelation Lord. That you would open our understanding, open our eyes, Lord, and that you would help us open our hearts to receive your word. And may it come into us, Lord, and may it abide in us. And may it take root and grow and produce fruit unto yourself, Lord. For God, we want to be the vessels that you can pour yourself into and use in this hour. We ask that you would, Lord, take this vessel of mine under your control. Lord, that you would speak your words of eternal life and that you would bring changes in our life. That you'd bring greater understanding, greater revelation, Lord, and that we would have greater strength by your word to do what you've called us to do in this hour. For God, we're surrendered to you in a greater way. And we ask for your help in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Man, God bless you all. It's so good to be here together. Amen. While you're standing, we're going to ask you to take your Bibles. And I I just want to let you know we've got a special service. They're all special, but this is a exciting service for uh for brother Peter and sister Sharon Art. They're visiting with us again, and they desire to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ at the end of the service. So, God bless you all. We're so excited for them. Amen. God is taking them on a journey and bringing them into more and more light. And as they see the truth revelation of baptism in Jesus' name, they surrender to it and desire desired to identify with him in his name. And so we're very very excited for them. And so we'll do that at the end of the service. Also, they've bought a place here so they can stay here and fellowship with us for weeks at a time. So we appreciate that because we enjoy their fellowship very much. So may God bless them in that whole process. &gt;&gt; Amen. Also, I'd like to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Is Wesley Godfrey into the service? God bless you. It's good to have you guys here. Amen. I looked over when I came out and Wesley was by himself and I wondered what happened already. Not that fast, but Amen. We're happy to have him here. God bless you. And they've got a a reception here uh Saturday. So, everybody's welcome to that. The information is on the bulletin board. So, we're looking forward to spending that time together with them this Saturday. Amen. Also wanted to remind you that there'll be no service next Wednesday. A week from today, we'll be preparing for the retreat and we'll be meeting together Thursday over at the retreat. So, no service next Wednesday. Also, I was notified we had some visitors from Edmonton, Brother Kenny and Sister Peggy Schlay from Brother Eugene Bronze Church, and they're passing through on their winter home to Virginia. Is that you back there? God bless you. It's good to see you. You're very welcome here, and we're glad to have you with us. Amen. God is good. You never know who's going to pass through. Amen. We enjoy it. We love the fellowship and we love when people drop in to see us. I love living at the intersection of 80, 90, and 70 and 30 because we get a lot of people passing through. So, it's quite a blessing. Amen. If you would turn with me to First John chapter 3. 1 John chapter 3. I say I appreciated the impromptu special. It was wonderful. God bless you, brother John, brother Sam. Amen. First John chapter 3 verse one. Behold what manner of love the father bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. &gt;&gt; That is love, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. We read it, but it's actually surreal. It It's I mean, when you just think in human terms, it's beyond the human mind. It's It's I I really wish that the full impact of that could hit me in the reality that it is in. Behold, what manner of love the father bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. Therefore, the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. not will be. &gt;&gt; Now are we the sons of God. And it does not yet appear what we shall be. But we know that when we shall when when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you take your seats. And may God bless his word unto us. Amen. God is so good. Amen. And I'm going to um if we could pull up the slides, Brother Franco, I &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The Super Race. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm still reading out of my little booklet. So, if you have if you have your booklet, uh I can't get away from this little booklet. It's been in my Bible for a couple months now, but uh I've got it on the overhead if you don't have your booklet with you. But if you do have the booklet, we're going to read uh from the first page, paragraph 171-1. And uh I'm going to pull it up on the overhead, but it says, "Here is what I'm trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its own kind, even according to Genesis 1:11. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind. whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so. Whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and then into the fruit. The very same law applies to the church today. Whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed. In these last days, the true bride church, Christ's seed. So the true bride churches of what seed? Christ seed, &gt;&gt; which is the royal seed, seed of Abraham. And that's what she's part of. That's her lineage. the the true bride church, Christ seed, will come to the headstone and she will be the super church. She will be a super race &gt;&gt; as she nears him. Amen. That's what we want to talk about this morning. The quote goes on. It says, "They in the bride will be so much like him. They will even be in his very image. That is in order to be united with him. They will be one. They will be the very manifestation of the word of the living God. Denominations cannot produce this wrong seed. They will produce their creeds and their dogmas mixed with the word. This mongerizing brings forth a hybrid product. Amen. So we got to find we find out that the original seed brings forth the original life. Amen. And brings back the original life. Amen. That was in that bride tree in tree in the beginning. And that's what God's done is brought us back to the original seed, to the original word, to produce the original life in the tree once again. And that's what we're here to do. But I I love this when he said, "She will be the super church." I'm going to highlight that, too, cuz that just sounds good. &gt;&gt; She will be the super church. A super race. And I want to talk about that super race because it it sometimes when we hear terms like this, it it it it it's I mean it's fantastic. These are fantastic things and they're overwhelming to say, but I really want to think about it. I want to absorb it. I want to understand what does it mean to be a super church? What does it mean to be a super race? Amen. Because it's got to be in order to be a super race, it's got to be the God race. It's got to be God's children manifest upon the earth. Amen. and what manner of love that is bestowed upon us the father that he should that we should be called the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living God. Amen. This is what produces a super race is the fact that the word amen the word finds a recipient in this age. the true word, the original word, the full word, the whole word, with the whole thought and mind of God with his purpose and intention for a church to have a bride. Amen. A a a bride that's come out of him that's going to be united with him. Amen. That original word for a church. Amen. Has to find a resting place. It's got to find a recipient in this time. And so when the original seed has come back, there's got to be good ground prepared, a predestinated ground to receive that seed. And when she receives that seed, she will be the very manifestation of the word of the living God. Not because she's super duper in herself, but she's received the original word. And the original word has the original life. And the original life will produce its own life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we talk about a super church, a super race, uh the very manifestation of the word of God, this is not we're not talking about our flesh bodies. We're not talking about ourselves as in this hybrid creature that we are. We're talking about a place for that word to connect to because the word has to come to the word. The word predestinated with the word before the foundation or the word for the age with the word predestinated. And when those two come together, it springs to life. And then that word begins to reproduce itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a people. &gt;&gt; That's why they'll be the very manifestation of the word of the living God. That's why denominations can't produce this. It's not because they're inferior people. &gt;&gt; We we don't we don't look at those who go to other churches and with sincerity and desire to serve God and they we can say they can never produce this. Why can they never produce this? It's not because they're inferior as people. Some of them can. I mean, if we want to start measuring ourselves up on a human level, we would be inferior. many of us in many ways and probably inferior in dedication, inferior, amen, in personal sacrifice. Inferior in many ways, but there's one thing we're not inferior to because we've been given the original word. And the original word is what's superior. That's what's super. &gt;&gt; So to be a super church, Amen. It takes a super word with a super spirit with a super life, the original life to produce a super church. It doesn't take a superhuman being. It takes a super word and a regular common everyday human being. &gt;&gt; Denominations can't produce this not because they're inferior. They can't produce it because they don't have the word. &gt;&gt; It's that simple, friends. It's so simple. Amen. That's why there's no looking down. There's no belittling. There's no begrudging. There's no there's no pride. There's no animosity. Amen. what what manner of love the father's bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god. It's beyond us. It's beyond our thinking. It's beyond anything about us. It's something he predetermined before the foundation. It's something that abides in us. Amen. In our soul, amen. That he placed there a portion of himself to connect with the word for this age to bring forth a super church, a super race, the very manifestation of the word of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad to be a super church that I don't have to be a super person. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad to be a super race. I don't have to become a super person because all that I all that I would do is try harder and fail bigger. Amen. But it's not about me. It's about that word finding a resting place. And the resting place is not because I got wiser and I got smarter and I decided to believe the truth. There's a resting place. Brother Bam said that seed Amen. He went through the parable of the seeds. The seed had to have good ground. He said predestinated ground. God had decided he's going to have a place for this original seed to fall in the last days. And he did it himself. &gt;&gt; So it's not what I've done. Amen. It's only what I believe. It's what he did. Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; So when we say she'll be a super church, she'll be a super race. We can shout amen to the top of our voice and we can realize there's not a thing super about me. I'm I'm probably I you know &gt;&gt; I don't know where I would rank on the grand scale of things, but probably slightly below average, you know, if you took everything. I mean, I don't know. I I might be being generous to myself. I might be I heard one man say one time, he said, "I graduated in the top 10% of the lower half of my grade." So, there's always got to be some way to phrase it to make it sound nice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where we rank as human beings has nothing to do with it. We've got different abilities and different skills and different complex and different hang-ups, different genetic things and all kinds of stuff about us. Amen. But that's not what we're looking at. That's not the super church. The super church is the super word living in a people who have surrendered, who have given their lives to Christ. And Christ has come by the sanctifying power of the blood to wash them so that he can enter himself to make that word live. &gt;&gt; Amen. That what will be the super church, the super race. Praise be to God. I want to look at the church age book here. An excerpt from that in the Leosian church age. He says, "But now he is standing in the midst of the church. As he stands there revealing who he is in the last age, he calls himself the author of the creation of God. If you look at Revelation chapter 3, he says the beginning of the creation of God. And brother Ram tells us that's the author. He's the beginning and the beginner &gt;&gt; of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; This is another creation. This has to do with the church. This is a special designation of himself. He is the creator of that church. The heavenly bridegroom created his own bride. As the spirit of God, he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born. &gt;&gt; I want to repeat that. He created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body. It was not enough for the Holy Spirit to simply give life to a human om supplied by Mary. That would have been sinful mankind reproducing a body. That would not have produced the last Adam. of him it was said, "Lo, a body hast thou father prepared for me." God, not Mary, provided that body. Mary was the human incubator, and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth. It was a God man. He was the son of God. He was of the new creation. Man and God met and joined. He was the first of this new race. He is the head of this new race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What kind of race do you think this is? &gt;&gt; This new race. Could that be a super race? &gt;&gt; If he's the head of that race, I say it is a super race &gt;&gt; because he's the super one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Brother Bam's going to go into a series of scriptures here. So, we pulled these up. And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he goes to 2 Corinthians 5. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things have passed away. Behold, all things are become new. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why this doesn't have anything to do with your flesh. This has to do with something deeper than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't say it has nothing to do with your flesh because it's manifest through your flesh. Your flesh is part of it. Amen. But this this resides deeper than that. Amen. The new birth is deeper than that. Then he goes then he says there you can see that through though man was of the old order or creation now in union with Christ he has become the new creation of God. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in union with Christ Jesus unto good works. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then Ephesians 4:24, "And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now he's talking about the new birth, making us a new creature in Christ Jesus. The new man. Uh then he goes on to say this, this new creation is not the old creation made over or would not be called a new creation. This is exactly what it says. It is new creation. It is another creation distinct from the old one. No longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh. That was how he dealt with Israel. He chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue through the godly Isaac line. But now out of every kindred, tribe, nation, he has purposed a new creation. He is the first of that creation. He was God created in the form of man. Now by his spirit, he is creating many sons unto himself. God the creator creating himself a part of his creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did we catch that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How is God the creator creating himself a part of his creation? He's doing it by his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is creating many sons into himself. This is through new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God the creator creating himself a part of his creation. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. This is the true revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the seventh seal? What is Revelation 10:7? The mystery of God been being finished. Amen. This is the true revelation of God. This was his purpose. Amen. And this purpose took form through election. That is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation of God. His sovereign power brought it to pass. By his own decree, he elected the members of this new creation. He predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will. By his omniscience and omnipotence, he brought it to pass. That's why it'll be a super church. That's what'll be a super race because the super one determined it by &gt;&gt; by his superpower. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the true revelation of God in Christ the mystery of God revealed. says, "Now he sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed." Now, see, he could go back and pick up what these other fellows has left off here and in the last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mystery of the seven seals. See, he is expressing himself. That's his purpose. That's why he died. That's the second fold of the three-fold manifestation. First, to express himself in Christ, then express himself through the church. And that same thing, Christ was the word. And the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them. &gt;&gt; This is this is what it's all about, friends. It's not I mean, this is not about Amen. God God coming down and finding super duper people. And he's making a super race out of super duper people. Amen. What God's coming down is he's finding his good ground. He's finding his predestinated people, the people who can receive the word. And he brings the light of the age and connects with that word and brings that light to life. Amen. And now, amen. That word for this age when it comes to life, it has to have a vessel to work through. When it finds the vessel that will surrender to the word and lay down their life and say, I believe that be it unto me according to your word. Now, the life of the word will come in and manifest that life. And now that Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them. Amen. &gt;&gt; We literally become the word. Why? Because the word when the word says, amen, that the bride will be such and such. And when we receive the word and now the life of that word manifest itself in us, we've become that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the word is living in our day. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Paul says in Galatians 4:19, "My little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you." &gt;&gt; That's what Paul was trying to bring the church to to where Christ is going to be formed in you. That's what all his preaching and teaching was all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we're manifesting in this day. the invisible union. He says the that oh that spiritual union of Christ in his church. Now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh &gt;&gt; manifested, vindicated. How? By simply letting the word flow through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By just simply yielding to it, obeying it, &gt;&gt; surrendering to it, opening our heart to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It it's it's more simple than what we think because it's it's not what we produce because we don't have the power to produce anything. But it's what we surrender to that he comes and produces himself. &gt;&gt; And that's why he's restored the word in our day so that that the true word with the true power of the full word can manifest itself. But it's got to manifest through a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to be one of those people. First John, I'm going to read 1 John chapter 4 says, "Hereby know ye the spirit of God. Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Jesus Christ I I just want to ask is Jesus Christ is come in the flesh or has come in the flesh? &gt;&gt; Present tense. Every spirit that confess that uh I'm sorry. Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God. And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God. And this is that spirit of Antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come. And even now already is it in the world. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them. Because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. How is it that we've overcome? Because greater is he that is in me. &gt;&gt; It didn't say because greater is me. &gt;&gt; But greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not me that's overcoming the world, but it's greater that he that's in me that's overcoming the world and overcoming the Antichrist spirit that's taking over the world and overcoming everything. It's overcoming by what? Greater is he that is in me &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the message, he that is in you, the prophet says, if we if we only could receive this truth, now just a moment. If we only could realize what this scripture mean, he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world. We can't understand that. Yet we say we believe it and we know it's true, but we really don't understand it. Greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world. What is in you that's greater? It's Christ the anointed. &gt;&gt; God that was in Christ is in you. Greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world. Then if he is in you, it's not you anymore living. It's him living in you. See, it's not your thinking what you would think about this. It's what he said about this. See? Amen. &gt;&gt; Then if he's in you, he absolutely would not deny what he said. He couldn't do it. But he would keep what he has said and he is trying to find that person that he can vindicate himself through. And now that doesn't mean he has to do it to everybody. In the time that Moses led the children of Israel, there was one that was Moses. The rest of them just followed the message. See, some of them tried to raise up to impersonate it and God said, "Separate yourself." And just swallowed them up. But he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world. God in you like he was in Jesus Christ because that's all God was. He poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church. See that's God in you. He that's in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want to look at this this statement brother Brandham made. Amen. He starts talking about uh greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. Then he comes and make this statement. He says that doesn't mean he has to do it to everybody. Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; Strange, but I I I want to talk about it. Amen. Can we just talk about it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the time that Moses led the children of Israel, there was one that was Moses. The rest of them just followed the message. &gt;&gt; And I This is just This is just your brother Chad. I'm just sharing with you what I see when I read this. The revelation that strikes me is brother Ben Brandham is not saying that the supernatural won't work in your life. That's not what he's saying. That it's not for you. It's only for one. But what he's saying is we don't have to become Malachi 4. We don't have to become Amen. We don't have to replicate Brother Benham's ministry. Amen. There was one that God raised up to fulfill Malachi 4. Amen. But Malachi 4 came to bring us to a place. Amen. And the rest of us are going to fill that place. Amen. So we don't have to go back and try to replicate Brother Ben. We don't need to get a tent and go touring around. Amen. And do healing lines, friends. God raised up one to vindicate the word for his day to draw the attention to the word to be Malachi 4. Amen. To be to be for the fulfillment of Revelation 10:1-7 to fulfill the seventh angel ministry. Amen. To do all of the things to forrun the second coming. He already came and did that. We don't need to go back and do that. But we need to believe that message. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we need to follow after that message. The rest of them just followed the message. And so, uh, so many times, you know, we look at Brother Benham's life and it's so supernatural and then we look at ourselves. &gt;&gt; Has anybody done that? &gt;&gt; You read the supernatural book and it's like, my goodness. And then you look at yourself. Hey, listen. But but but hey, I've talked to many of you. I've got my own testimony. You have your own testimony. It's not that the supernatural God doesn't work in supernatural ways in your life. Amen. But God does not want us to go try to replicate what we've seen. He did that. He had one in this generation and he already came and he already did what he was supposed to do. But what does that mean for you and I? Amen. That was the sign that actually brother Brandham said the prophet becomes the chief sign of the age. His life becomes the word. He said Jesus Christ was the chief sign. He was the super sign. And that super sign was manifest again in brother Brandham because it wasn't the man discerning the hearts of the people. Amen. Out in the congregation. That was Jesus Christ the super sign. And we received in this age a super sign. &gt;&gt; We had a super sign from a super God, from a super Jesus Christ. Amen. What was he doing? He was trying to call to a super church, to a super race. Amen. Come unto me. Come unto this message. I'm here to deliver something to you. &gt;&gt; So we all don't have to go back and be that. Amen. But that was to get our attention to bring us to where we're supposed to be. Moses came to be the deliverer because there was a prophecy that God told uh Abraham that thy children say so Jordan in a strange land for 400 years but I will bring them out with a mighty hand. Who is the eye? The eye is the superpower. The eye is the super one. The eye has the super sign. But how did the super one come? He came through Moses. &gt;&gt; He told Moses, Moses, hey, I've heard the cry of my people. I've come down to deliver them. Now come. I'm sending you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; And Moses became the super sign to that age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Super sign of what? Super sign of the promised word. Now it's time for deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what did that super sign do? What was the purpose of the super sign? What was the purpose of the supernatural ministry? What was the purpose of the signs that were given to him as vindication? What was the purpose of all of that? The purpose of all that was to fulfill the promise that I will give you this land. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That I will bring Amen. your seed into this land and divide the inheritance into the seed of Abraham. That was the time. It was the time for that promise to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Moses goes and he he does the supernatural. He does the miraculous. He does what? I mean, can you imagine standing there and watching it, friends? &gt;&gt; I can't imagine what it was like to stand by the Red Sea &gt;&gt; and hear the blast of wind and feel it and see the water roll up like a wall. &gt;&gt; Can't imagine what that was like. &gt;&gt; I can't imagine all the other signs and all the other uh uh uh miracles and even the plagues. I can't imagine what that was like. But none of that was for the children of Israel to replicate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was one Moses. &gt;&gt; The rest of them just followed the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was the message? You're leaving this bondage and you're going back to your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To possess it, to live in it. &gt;&gt; God speaks through Moses in the Exodus. He said, "And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord God called unto him out of the mountain, saying, "This shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel." Now, this he's saying this is before the law comes, he brings them out of Egypt and they come to Mount Si and and when he brings them to Mount Si, because that's the commandment. You go get them and bring them back to this mountain to worship. And Moses does. And when he comes back, he he goes up to the mountain to talk to God. And God says, "Now I want you to now that you've brought my people to me on this mountain. I've got a message that I want you to give them." And he says, "Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bear you on eagle's wings, and brought you unto myself. Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people. For all the earth is mine, and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation." These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; I love this because what he tells them is he said, "Go tell them that you're going to be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people. &gt;&gt; You're going to be a kingdom of priest and a holy nation." He said, "I've called you for a purpose and I've called you to be something and I've called you for a position and I've called you to fulfill my word in you." and and he and this is what this is what his commission is for them. This is what he brought the people to himself to be. I want you to be uh if I could say it this way, I want you to be a super nation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've brought you to be the super nation above all nations. A holy nation. A peculiar people assigned to the whole world. My people on display in my land. I want you to be a super nation. A holy nation. A peculiar people. a kingdom of priests. All of you &gt;&gt; listen, they had a position. They didn't need to go back and replicate Moses' position. They had a position. They were to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation and a light on a hill. And they were to move into the promised land and take each one their position. Not to go back and take Moses position, but each one take their position. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the purpose of Moses's ministry was to bring them out so God could identify who they are and God could tell them what he wants to do with them and make them a a a a super nation, a super people and bring them into their land to set up a super kingdom, a super nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For God. &gt;&gt; But when God went to do this, he gave them instructions and he be going to speak to them himself and they could not endure his voice. And and that's when they asked for the law. Brother Rem told us. And they began to fall. Amen. From that great position. &gt;&gt; But uh oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; So Moses Moses was the mighty man of the hour. He had all the gifts and and God had used him &gt;&gt; to go and get his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And bring his people into the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they were going to be the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As they step into the promise and take the promised land. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that was the word. I shall bring your people and they shall possess the land. &gt;&gt; I will divide unto them an inheritance. Amen. To the seed of Abraham. That was the word. And when those people when they let the word flow through them, when they moved into the promised land and and and and listen, God says, "I'll drive out the inhabitants. I'll give you the land. I'll do they weren't supposed to do it of their own power." But then he says, "Now you go possess the land." Amen. And they were to go up and take their position in the promise. And as they took their position and they inhabited the land and they planted vineyards and they ate the corner of the land and they they were established in the place that God had promised Abraham, they were becoming the word made flesh. This was God's word fleshed out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we know that they failed because they failed to keep all of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and uh they they came they came to Kadesh Barnea. They come through the journey and we won't go through all of that, but they come to Kish Barnea and in Kadesh Barnea they send out the spies. The spies go spy out the land and they come back and they say, "Surely it's a good land." &gt;&gt; I mean, what the word says about it is true. Amen. What God said, what Moses told us is true. Amen. But but listen, there's something else that wasn't told us. There's giants in the land and there's walled cities and it's a land that eats up the inhabitants of the people and all these other things. And the people be they begin to rebel against God. They begin to murmur against God and gets Moses and gets Aaron. And they begin to cry out and they they say, "Now Moses, you've brought us here to kill us and let's make a captain and let's go back and what what's going on? What's happening in this scene?" Amen. These people, Amen, they believed Moses. They believed Moses' ministry. They believed the supernatural. They believed all Hey, listen. Every one of these people that are here in Kades Barnea, they believed that when Moses lifted up the rod and spoke, the waters parted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They believed Moses was a prophet of God. They believed that Moses, Amen, brought the plagues. They believed that through the voice of Moses, God delivered. They believed all of that. But the problem is they did not believe Moses's message. Because Moses' message was not, "I'm parting the Red Sea." His message was not, "I'm bringing plagues." His message was, "I'm bringing you into the word. I'm bringing you into your heritage. I'm bringing you into your land." Amen. And now when they go to the land and it looks too hard and looks too difficult and they can't do it. Amen. They're looking at themselves. The unbelief that is in their heart starts to creep up. Amen. And it's not that they disbelieve who Moses is and they disbelieve the miracles of Moses and they disbelieve the supernatural. They disbelieve the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there was two who believed the message. Amen. They believed that what Moses had said about the word was true. That when Moses said, "God, come and told me, now is the time for deliverance. Now is the time to take your inheritance." That God had told our father Abraham, "I will bring your children back into this land." That time is now for the word. And there was only two people in all that camp that actually believed the message &gt;&gt; because the message wasn't go do signs in Egypt. That's not the message. The message wasn't part the Red Sea. That's not the message. The message is you're going back to your inheritance. You're coming back to be a holy nation. You're coming to be all that I already for ordained for you to be. That's the message. And in that message, they couldn't go backwards. And that message they had to go forwards into the land. And in order to fulfill the message and in order to be the word made flesh, they had to go to the portion that was portioned out to them. They had to go take it. They had to possess it. They had to plant. They had to grow. They had to fight out the Canaanites. And they had to be established in their land. And that was becoming the word made flesh. That's what made them message believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was only one Moses, but they had to believe the message. Well, what does it mean to believe the message? It means to move on into the word and become the word and manifest the word and let the word flow through you. &gt;&gt; To come back to being the church that she was at Pentecost, to be established upon the doctrines of the fathers, to come back to everything that Paul said, everything that Peter said, everything that we were taught to be as a church &gt;&gt; with the full life, full manifestation, full gifts, everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; But not back to a one-man ministry. Not back to everything being wrapped up in one man and that one man. No, that's not the message. The message is ye are the sons of God. Now you are the sons of God and he's brought you back to your inheritance, back to your promised land. Now possess your land. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Joshua and Caleb, they saw all that Moses did. &gt;&gt; And how it must have stirred their hearts. This is the time. This is God. &gt;&gt; Everybody else in the camp, they saw that Moses did. How must have stirred their hearts. Say, "This is God. This is the time." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe, listen, when Miam took up the tambourine and the and the daughters of Israel danced on the shore, Amen. because the horse and rider was thrown into the sea, they were all singing the same song and they were all excited about the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz they saw the miraculous and they believed the miraculous and they &gt;&gt; But you know what? God never asked any of them to go bring plagues in Egypt. What God asked them to do was move into the word. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; What made them a super nation was not to go back into Egypt and do what Moses did. What made them a super nation was to go forward into the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. when the 10 spies come back and the 12 but the 10 with an evil report and they say we be not able. &gt;&gt; The land is great and but we be not able to take it. Listen, that was a direct contradiction to the message. &gt;&gt; They had saw the supernatural. They had saw they had saw the miracles. They had saw and they wouldn't deny. Listen friends, I think it's so important to realize not one of them would deny any miracle. They stood there and watched it happen with their own they &gt;&gt; weren't reading in a book, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; or a news article. They were there. &gt;&gt; But they did not believe in the supernatural ability of God to work through them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. They believed in the supernatural ability of God to work through Moses, &gt;&gt; but not the supernatural ability of God to work through them to give them the power to manifest the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which was what? Go take the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb, they saw the same miracles. They were stirred by the same thing. Only when they saw God part the Red Sea and they saw mana fall and they saw and they saw and they saw Amen. They saw they saw something more than what everybody else saw. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Everybody else saw miracles and witnessed miracles and testified miracles and they might have been on record as testifying. They might have wrote their own I was there this date and this is my eyewitness testimony and it might have went in the record with all the other records. Amen. But when they got to Kadesh Barnea, Amen. Their testimony failed. Their eyewitness account failed. It failed because of unbelief. But Joshua and Caleb, they steal the people. And they say, "Listen, have gone before us. We are more than able to take the land. We are more than able." He said, "These these enemies are but bread for us." Listen, what are they talking about? Walled cities, giants in the land. Brother Bam said, "Amen. a wall so thick they could run chariots around them. Amen. They saw all the fortifications and the armies and the armor and the helmet and the spears and ma everything everybody else saw and everybody else saw that and they saw themselves and they knew all that God had done and all that God had said. But when they saw all of that and they saw themselves, they say, "We be not able." But when Joshua and Caleb who were true believers of the message, &gt;&gt; I want you to get this. Not believers of a prophet, believers of the message because they believe the message. They say we are more than able to take it. And I want to tell you, I believe this message and we are more than able to live every word that's in this Bible. Amen. And every promise is ours. And I don't know how I'll do it. I don't know Joshua and Caleb, they didn't have a strategy for taking the land. They didn't have a tactic. They didn't have armorament. They didn't build extra big shields. And they they had no engineering. Amen. All they had was faith in the promise. If God could do that through Moses to bring me here, then God could work through me to take the land because God called me into my position. That's my land. &gt;&gt; That's why after 40 more years, 45 more years, Caleb would come to Joshua and say, "Give me my mountain. That's mine." And he goes, "I'm 85 years old and I'm just as strong at today as I was then for going out, for coming in. And I'll go. If God be with me, I'll take it." Why? He wasn't looking at the strength of his arms. He was looking at his faith in the message. &gt;&gt; Listen, we got a whole pile of people that believe in a prophet. &gt;&gt; But that prophet came to give us a message. And that message was, "You are the sons and daughters of God. You are restored to your inheritance. You're back to what God wanted you to be. You're a vessel he's working in. You're the super church. You're the super race. And whatever hinders you in manifesting the word is bred for you. &gt;&gt; Anything that stops you from living this New Testament is bred for you. You're more than able to take it because this is your inheritance. The word of God. This is your promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now, what has God called us not to go back and replicate a prophetic ministry, but to move forward? What's my land? What's my promise? What am I supposed to do? Well, Joshua, the Holy Ghost, in that day, he said, "Judah, you're over here. Ephraim, you're over here. Now, you guys can help each other take the land, but it's your responsibility to take your land. It's your responsibility to drive the Canaanites out, to kill them all, to possess the land." And now God has called some of us to be mothers and fathers and sons and daughters and and whatever station in life we are. Whatever your gender, what your gender, your job, your age, it doesn't matter. God has placed you there as a son or daughter of God to overcome in this age. &gt;&gt; And to overcome by what? To overcome by the word and the power of the word to live and manifest the word of God wherever your position is. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're a toe, a toenail, a finger, an eye, an eyebrow, an eyelash, it doesn't matter where in the body you are, that's your position. You are part of Christ. And the bride as a whole is the body of Christ. And she is the manifestation of Christ. And you're part of that manifestation. &gt;&gt; And now anything that would hinder you in manifesting the word is bred for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Praise God. &gt;&gt; This is why it's such a fallacy to go back and try to repeat what we saw before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not going to go back to a tent campaign. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go back to a first second pull all over the world. I'm not going to go back to that because all of that came to bring me to the message. And the message came to put me in my position. And my position is to live this word wherever he has planted me to manifest the word every day of my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; To pray for my co-workers, to lay hands on my children, to to manifest the word, to believe, whatever. If it's an obstacle, if it's hindering me and shutting me down and stopping for me from moving forward in the program of God, I'll speak to it and speak against it and push against it and fight that Canaanite off my land because we're more than able to take it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we've had a mighty prophet who did mighty signs and mighty wonders to show a mighty sign. It was a super sign in that age. And the super sign was showing us that he's bringing back a super church, a super race upon the earth. &gt;&gt; And I'm part of it. &gt;&gt; I may only be that I only I may only have this much territory, but I'm more than able to take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now it doesn't matter. Listen now. Now it's not about me having all the gifts. It's not about me having all the manifestations. It's not a oneman thing. Now, and now listen, they went in a many membered body into e into into the promised land. &gt;&gt; And some of them could hurl stones with the right and the left hand. &gt;&gt; Benjamin, &gt;&gt; some of them could do this, and some of them could do that, and some of them could do that. And no longer do I have to have all the gifts working in me, but if I see it working you, I'm excited because that's part of the body. It's working in Christ. All the gifts are working. Amen. All the manifestations are here. The full life of Christ. I don't need it all in me. I just need to do my portion, my land, my territory, what he's given me to do. And if I plant wheat, I plant wheat. And if something comes and stops me from planting wheat, I'm going to fight against it by the word of God and the power that's in me because we're more than able to take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now I don't have to go and do what Zebulun does or what Issacher does or I'm just thankful that they do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful there's somebody in the body with faith. I'm thankful that there's somebody in the body with the word of knowledge. I'm thankful there's somebody in the body with intercessory prayer. I'm thankful for every gift that's in the body because it's all here in Christ. &gt;&gt; But my job is to take my land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what every Israelite was commissioned to do in the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if it requires the supernatural, then I expect the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I've tried and I've done and I've done all I can do and it won't move and I can't get it to budge and whatever it is that's hindering me, I can't get out of my way, then I expect the parting of a Red Sea, the walking on water, the the the the stopping of the sun, or whatever it's going to take because I'm here in my commission, in the message believing that &gt;&gt; I'm more than able. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise. Praise. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Let me see what I can do next. All right. And the super sign he says still remains as Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. The works that I do, if his life is in you, it'll manifest Jesus Christ. Now you all can't be that one. But you can be part of that with your faith. &gt;&gt; All of them couldn't be a Jesus when they was on earth, but they could believe him and accept the message. There was one Moses, one Elijah, one Noah on down always been that. But the rest of them couldn't accept it. And they would have had no ministry unless there had been somebody believe it. Jesus would have had no ministry unless somebody believe it. Paul would have had no ministry unless somebody believe it. And the Holy Ghost has got no ministry by the word today unless somebody is willing to get away from their creed and come back to the word again. No matter how well it's here and how real it's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost has no ministry unless somebody believes it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I want to I want to skip over here to another another scripture. Let's go to Markap 11 verse 20. When Jesus Christ was on earth, he was the God man. &gt;&gt; He was the beginning of the creation of God. He was the super seed. He was the head of the super race. We all believe that. And he says, "In the morning as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots." What fig tree? This is the one that he went over to try to find figs on and there was no figs because it wasn't in season. And he cursed the tree. And Peter calling to remember saith unto him, Master, behold the fig tree which thou curses is withered away. And Jesus answered saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he say shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. It's amazing. Jesus comes and he curses the fig tree and they come back and Peter and them they marvel and Peter makes note. Lord, that's amazing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that that fig tree is all dried up. And Jesus is standing here, the son of God, God in flesh. And he says, "Listen, don't marvel. &gt;&gt; You can do that, too. Listen, Jesus didn't just come &gt;&gt; to be the great one. &gt;&gt; He came to show us what a son of God is. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham didn't just come and sent by God just to be the great one that we all want. He come to showed us what an adopted son of God is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What what the first part of the bride that comes to harvest maturity looks like. He come to show us what the potentials are. He come to show us what it looked like to obey the word. And listen, in that obedience for the word, he didn't first get converted into a perfect man to show us what it's like to be a son of God. Amen. A restored son of God. He was still a human being. He still had complexes. &gt;&gt; He still had a rejection complex. He still got tired. He still got worn out. He still had a nervous breakdown. &gt;&gt; He still lied and had to be corrected. He still was uh had selfish motives and wanted to run away from the ministry and he had to be corrected from by God. And God didn't lift him up there. Amen. To say, "Whoa, look at that suit." No, he came up, showed him says, "Listen, this is the potential. This is what it's like to be a son of God. This is what I'm bringing the church back to." &gt;&gt; And then you say, "Whoa, Jesus. Wow. Look, you you cursed the tree and it's all dried up." And Jesus says, Listen, if you believe, &gt;&gt; if you just believe, listen, Peter, you don't know who you are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm demonstrating to you. Amen. In flesh, God in flesh. But Peter, if you don't doubt in your heart, &gt;&gt; but believe what you ask for. You can say, not only this, but you can say to the mountain, be plucked up and cast into the sea. And brother Benham was was concerned with this scripture right here. Amen. when God come to him to create squirrels. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was meditating on this and contemplating that and he said he never preached on it cuz he didn't understand it and he he's he doesn't he's thinking about it and God comes to him and starts to tell him you can do that and starts to lead him in amen by God's leadership into speaking squirrels into existence and he speaks squirrels into existence and he finds out that this scripture is for the sons of God but the sons of God that are led by the spirit of God and when the spirit of God gives them in their heart Brother Bam said, "Whatever God can lead your soul to believe, you can have it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it takes the leadership of the Holy Ghost to lead your soul to believe it. Not whatever enters your mind, whatever is the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of life, whatever you're trying to produce for some vain glory. No. But whatever God can lead your soul to believe, you can have it by faith. Why? Because you're a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; I want to look at one more. Matthew 14 26. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It is a spirit." And they cried out for fear. But straightway Jesus spoke unto him, saying, "Be of good cheer. It is I. Be not afraid." And Peter answered him and said, "Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water." And he said, "Come." I love this. Listen, Jesus didn't say, "Peter, you know, you need to grow a little bit and you need to have &gt;&gt; Jesus never made the supernatural hard, &gt;&gt; difficult." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He never made it far away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He never made it impossible. Yes. &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water." And he said, "Come." &gt;&gt; He didn't give him any instructions. &gt;&gt; He didn't tell him how to hold his feet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; He said, "Come." &gt;&gt; Because Peter wasn't coming by ability. Peter wasn't coming because of the of the structure of his feet. Peter was going to move out by faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Come." And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid and began to sink, he cried, saying, "Lord, save me?" And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him, "Oh, thou of little faith, wherefore dst thou doubt?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, Peter Peter was uh Peter I don't know what made him say what he said. They were all astonished. They saw Jesus. They thought he was a spirit or a ghost. And he was coming walking on the water. And he said, "It's I. Be not afraid." And Peter said, "Lord, if that's you, Amen. bid me come." And Jesus said, "Come." &gt;&gt; You know what he's saying? &gt;&gt; You can walk on water. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, I I don't want to add to the scripture, but when Jesus said, "Come," &gt;&gt; I mean, I think it's safe to interpret that. &gt;&gt; And we saw like for Jesus, this wasn't a big deal. And Jesus didn't think it was for him only. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He come walking on the water. Of course. Well, he's the virgin born son of God. But he's every bit as much in flesh as Peter was in flesh. His body was affected by gravity the same as Peter's body was affected by gravity. He he ate the same food Peter ate. Amen. He had to sleep like Peter ate. He was just as much flesh. Only he was virgin born flesh as Peter was born flesh. And Jesus had no problem about walking on the water. It wasn't a problem to him because he believed. He had perfect faith. Amen. And when Peter was moved by inspiration and called out to God before he could think, he said, "Lord, if it's you, bend me come." And Jesus says, "Come. &gt;&gt; If I in flesh can walk on water, you in flesh can walk on water because you also are a son of God. You also have a gene of God in you. If you can believe it, you can do it." And when he got there and started walking on the water, Peter was actually walking on the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By what? By faith. What kind of faith? supernatural God-given faith to a sea gene of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he looked around at the situation and the circumstances like the 10 spies did. &gt;&gt; He started looking at the wind and the waves and all the danger that he was in, all of a sudden he began to doubt. And when he began to doubt, what was he doubting? He was doubting the word because the person of the word said come. And if the person of the word said come, then he can come. And there's nothing that can sink him except if he doesn't believe the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; But his faith in the word was what keeping him above the waves. But when he began to doubt the call of God, the commission the word, he began to sing. And Jesus says, "Oh thee of little faith, why did you doubt?" &gt;&gt; That's what affected him in Kadesh Barnea. They saw the giants. They saw the cities &gt;&gt; and they began to doubt the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. But I thank God for a Joshua and a Caleb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They can look at the same thing and say, "But we believe." &gt;&gt; We believe. Listen, they were they were ready to run in. &gt;&gt; Listen, they were ready to run across the Jordan into the promised land without a plan, without armor. They were ready because they believed that God had given them the land. They believed what Moses had told them. They believe it was the word of the Lord. They saw it matched the prophecy. They saw the vindication of God on this prophet's life. And now they saw the wilderness journey, all that God did. And when they got there, they believed the message of the messenger. And they were ready to go. And God preserved them and brought them into the land because they believed. &gt;&gt; I do not I do not just want to be a believer in the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be a believer in the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the message is not God will send a prophet. God sent a prophet to bring the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the message is God wants to unite with you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he wants to live in you and I. &gt;&gt; I love these scriptures because it's it's not hard. But you say, "Brother Chad, well, I mean, I can't do it in myself, &gt;&gt; but whatever God can anoint my soul to believe. &gt;&gt; I can have it. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; I don't know how to make it work. I I don't I don't have a plan already. I I can't I can't tell you how I'll do all of that. And I also can't tell you where I was last. I forgot what slide I'm on. All right, let's go back here. the unveiling of God. He says like he was in Moses. When the word was in Moses, he was God in flesh. When it was in Jesus, it was God in flesh. See, only thing he done was change his mask, not his word, not his nature. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He only changed his form. He changed from Noah to Moses. He changed from Moses to David, from David to Joseph, on down till he come into the fullness of the Godhead bodily see. It's still the same God. Amen. I hope that gets through. See, it's the same God, but he just takes on another veil. See, he puts on another veil. He did it in the reformers. Taking on a veil. Taking on a veil until finally it come down through Lutheran age, down through the other age, then finally it comes out into the complete. &gt;&gt; What's that? That's a bride age. A a people standing on the earth at the end of time that he's living in fully. &gt;&gt; Just before it comes, a prophet arises again. What it does is foreshadows the word shows back here revealing what's been done, what's been left off that the church will will not be without understanding. Then when this fades out then like John said, I must decrease, he must increase. Then all in all comes into him. What is that? Where does allin come? It comes into the complete which is the church. &gt;&gt; He is fully manifested through Luther Wesley Pentecostal age and on down on down he is fully manifested. Now you see he come down just the manifestation God unfolding. See him now notice fulfilled in his promise for this day as they had God unfolding himself all the way down until now he's in a many member bride. That's what he wants for this age. That's the message he says. Now notice now the same as now they rejected identified deity. Do you get it? They will certainly put their name on a church book and say, "I'll try to live by this creed." They'll take an oath by this. But when it comes to accepting deity and expressing back the same kind of gift they had, they did that you are identified by your gift that you give your entire being to it. It identified deity. Then you identify yourself with the deity by giving all you are what you are to deity himself. Now Christ in this day that we that we now live in see he's still identifying himself deity among the people. He's still deity because he is the word. And when we see the word living itself then we know that man can't do that. Let me go forward. It's deity. The word being made manifest by man. And Jesus said himself the son can do nothing in himself. I can't do nothing. I'm a man. Jesus said, "But my father that dwelleth in me, he showeth me all things that himself doeth." Amen. There you are. What is it? Deity be being identified in man. Now the same thing is today that deity the promise word for this day can identify itself in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then can you hold to it? Show that you believe in it. Give it deity. Believe it. believe it service and be ready to die out to yourself and to your own thoughts. &gt;&gt; I want to be ready to die out to give it service to believe it to hold on to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even Even Jesus when he was on earth, he said, "The word I speak is not of myself." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the father in me, he doeth the works. Jesus wasn't even taking credit in his flesh. &gt;&gt; But he said, "It's the life in me that's doing the works." &gt;&gt; And neither can we take any credit in our flesh. But friends, it's the life in us doing the works. &gt;&gt; That's what will be the super race. It'll be God, amen, living in his children, his seeds come to life, himself manifest in the end time. It'll be him in us, not us, but him. And that'll be a super church, &gt;&gt; a super race. That's what the words come to produce. I want to look at this scripture in Acts chapter 3 as we close. Acts chapter 3:9. And all the people saw him walking and praising God. This is when Peter and John went went by the gate beautiful and they they healed the lame man. And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at which had at that which had happened unto him. And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering. And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, "Ye men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we made this man walk &gt;&gt; they had just performed a mighty miracle &gt;&gt; they had just taken a man who had sat there lame from his birth and from childhood and they all knew the man was there and they all knew he was lame even an argument broke out and say well this isn't him but it looks like him &gt;&gt; this is just a look alike that can't be him we've walked past him every they knew he was there and then you You know Peter says gold and silver have we none but such as I have give I unto you in the name of Jesus Christ stand and walk and he stood and he got strength in his legs and ankle bones and went bones and went leaping and running and praising God. Amen. And they were so marvelous what they saw it drew attention amen to Peter and John. And Peter and John say why are you marveling and why look on us as though we by our own strength have done this? We haven't. And they go on to tell them this is by the name of Jesus Christ and faith in his name. &gt;&gt; But where was he doing the works? and Peter who laid hands on the man who spoke to him what flesh did he use? He used Peter's flesh but it wasn't Peter's life. It was Peter's flesh but it was the life of Jesus Christ through Peter. &gt;&gt; That was a super church. &gt;&gt; That was the original church where the original life Amen. through the resurrection of Jesus Christ had come back into the church. And now he's he's looking like like he's like why why are you looking at us? &gt;&gt; As though we by our own strength. And Peter knew what he was. &gt;&gt; Listen, Peter hadn't forgot the forsaking Jesus. He hadn't forgot the cursing. He hadn't forgot the cutting off the servant of the high priest. He hadn't forgot what he was. Amen. But he had been born again by the power of God and received the spirit of God. And now there was another life living inside of him. And that other life was the super life. and the other the super life in him. Amen. Bringing the seed of God in him to life made him part of the super race and part of the super church because the super life was working through him. &gt;&gt; I mean even Paul and Barnabas they go to a place amen and they then there was a miraculous healing and all of a sudden the priest of the false gods amen they start coming to them and they say the gods have come down to us in the form of men. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And they brought oxen and they were going to slay to them. And they called one of them Jupiter and the other one Mercury according to their gods. Amen. Why? Because they knew men can't do this. That has to be God. And they say the gods have come down to us. And they weren't far off the truth. But they had the misunderstanding because there was God men back on the earth again. There was people in the hands of God that God could live in and manifest himself through. And it was a super church. It was a super race. But it wasn't their superpower. It was his superpower. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God has called us in this end time &gt;&gt; to be him. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be him, &gt;&gt; to be a people that he can dwell in, to be vessels he can fill, to be a church that he can pour himself into so that he can be made manifest in a many membered bride body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's he said it'll be a super church. It'll be a super race. How? by letting the word flow through us. &gt;&gt; It's going to take believing in the message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's going to be believing like Joshua and Caleb believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to be believing. Amen. That what the prophet taught us about us was true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, Joshua and Caleb, they knew Moses was a true prophet. And the 10 other spies knew that Moses was a true prophet, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's not about believing about Moses. &gt;&gt; But Joshua and Caleb believed what Moses said about them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that made all the difference in the world. &gt;&gt; And listen friends, we believe God sent a mighty prophet in this age. Many people believe God sent a mighty prophet in this age. Amen. But that doesn't give me overcoming power. What gives me overcoming power is believing what that prophet said about me. &gt;&gt; And believing it's the promise for the hour. It's the word and it's God's will for my life and it's the position he put me in. And it's his power that's going to bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God showed in Egypt when it's time for the word to be fulfilled, there's nothing that'll stop the word of God. &gt;&gt; When it was time for those children to come out of Egypt, there wasn't a Pharaoh. There wasn't an army. There wasn't a bondage. There wasn't anything that would stop that word. And so what did God do? God come on the scene through supernatural sign after supernatural sign to break the power of Egypt and break the power of Pharaoh and to bring the children out. And then when they got hemmed in and stopped by by a big body of water, he just opened the body of water. Amen. When they ran out of food, he sent mana. When the water was bitter, he turned it sweet. Why? Cuz it was time for this word to be fulfilled. And nothing was going to stop God from fulfilling his word. &gt;&gt; And we've had a prophet in this day said, "This is the generation. This is the time. This is when he's going to have a super church, a super race back to the virgin bride that he was at at the beginning to unite with Christ so Christ could reproduce himself in a many membered body. And this is the time." And I tell you friends, anything that stands in the way of that word coming to manifestation has got to move. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. Don't get nervous. Don't run away. Just keep pressing forward. If it's water, it'll part. You'll go over it. You'll go under. You'll go through it. Who knows how we'll go around it. But nothing's going to stop this manifestation in this hour. It's going to be Jesus Christ manifest in her. And nothing's going to stop it. &gt;&gt; And I believe like Joshua and Caleb, listen. I I Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe he's talking about me. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm part of it. I believe anything that hinders my expression of Christ in this hour has got to go. &gt;&gt; If it's a complex, God's got to help me through it. &gt;&gt; If it's some weakness in my body, God's got to help it. If something, God's got to help me through it because I believe he's talking about me. &gt;&gt; And I believe when it's time for me to take my position that I'm more than able &gt;&gt; if God be with me &gt;&gt; cuz he said he would do it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't look unto me &gt;&gt; like I've overcome. &gt;&gt; It was him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And me. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's all stand together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he good? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I love the word so much. So thrilled. Musicians, if you could come, please. Brother Peter and Sister Sharon, if you want to make your way around back, you can go ahead and start back that way. Let's bow our heads together. Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful. Father, God, that you have given us such a word in this hour. God, we recognize by your word, by what your prophet taught us, by what you showed us in the scripture that God, you're looking for a people that will believe your word and surrender themselves to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God, we recognize tonight that we've got to believe but more than your promise of Malachi 4, your promise of a prophet. But we have to believe the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the message has everything to do with us and our position. God, I pray that you would grant an outpouring of your faith. May your spirit come to quicken the word inside of us and make it live. we no longer doubt our position. No longer doubt what you said about us, Lord, but we would believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, I pray God that you would bless everyone who hears this word. God, may the Joshua and the Calebs rise up from within to come from that seed within us, Lord. That we would recognize, God, that this is for me, that this promise is true. And Lord, though it delay, though we go around and the horn again, it's not going to stop. Lord, it's going to be made manifest. Caleb's promised land was delayed 45 years, but it came anyways. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he believed the promise, God, Abraham's promise was fulfilled 25 years later, but it came anyways cuz he believed your word. God, I pray that you'd help us to believe your word. Help us to stand on it with faith like Joshua and Caleb. Help us to lay claim to the promise. Help us to march forward boldly knowing that God, you will remove anything that hinders your expression in our life. God, you're asking us to have faith to go in, have faith to move forward, have faith to push against the boundaries, against the enemies, but you said that you would drive them out and then you told us to possess. So God, as we go by faith and possession, would you come behind us and drive out, Lord? Give us the power to overcome, for we're trusting in you, Lord, that you're going to keep your word and you're going to flow that word right through us. And it's going to be the word made manifest. Not our strength, not our power, but your word manifesting itself through us. We love you. We ask God that you would help us to surrender in a greater way to this word, to believe it, to hold on to it, to serve it, to yield to it, to allow deity room to work inside of us. We love you. We thank you for this word and ask your blessings in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother John, &gt;&gt; we're live. We're living in the evening time. The race is almost through. God has chosen you and me. Still a job to do. The word that's been revealed to us must be prophesied again. And the message must reach everywhere till the last soul has come in. We are the generation. We are the culmination. Final voice that the world will hear. Coming of the Lord is here. Living out the revelation, overcoming sins, temptation. Truth will go to every tongue and nation. We are the chosen generation committed to the calling. Together we stand strong. Lifting up our voices as one. Sing the final song. God has chosen us to conquer in every test we face. And he has seen us through this far and will finish by his grace. [Music] We are the generation. We are the culmination [Music] that the world will hear. The coming of the Lord is near. Living out this revelation. [Music] Overcoming sins temptation. The truth will go to every tongue and nation. We are the chosen generation. Oh, that second verse. We're committed to the calling. Together we stand strong. Lifting up our voices. One. Sing the final song. God has chosen us to conquer every test we face. He has seen us through this far and will finish by his grace. We are the generation. We are &gt;&gt; all nation final voice that the world will hear. Coming of the Lord is here. Living out the revelation. Overcoming sins temptation. Truth will go to every tongue and nation. We are the chosen generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, God bless you all. You can be seated for just a minute. Man, this is exciting day to watch for us, but it's a very exciting day for Sister Sharon and brother Peter. The Lord has taken them on quite a journey of late, but they've they've served the Lord with all their hearts to the best of their understanding for years. But when God came and showed them a little more light, they decided to walk in the light. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so they want to serve God fully according to his word. And when they saw water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, they wanted to obey. So here they are after being Christians for years serving God with their whole heart. God says, "You're my children. I'm going to take you a little higher." And they say, "Lord, we want to go higher." And so it's a thrill to to see them take this step. Sister Sharon, it's a privilege for me to see you come to full obedience to the word of God. And as God's drawing you and the Lord Jesus Christ is pulling you higher, it's exciting to see you fully obey his word to take his name in water baptism. And it's with a great privilege that I now baptize you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Dear dear heavenly father, we thank you so much for this life, for your grace, for your mercy, for your love to draw her, Lord. Though she served you so many years, you said, "Sister, daughter, there's more I have for you." And she said, "There's more I want, Lord." And I pray now, God, that you confirm your promise and bring her all the way into the fullness of light and let your life flow through her and let her express this super race, this super church in this body of flesh. We ask that you would do it for her in Jesus Christ's name according to your promise. Amen. God bless you, sister. Amen. So, here is brother Peter. You want to scoot forward just a little bit to the edge. And and I'm so thankful that we've had a chance to fellowship. If you haven't got a chance to visit with these two, you're in for a treat. Amen. And now that they're going to be part-time citizens of Lima, we all have more opportunities. So, Brother Peter loves the word. absolutely loves I mean he asked some of the most wonderful amazing questions and we have the best fellowship and so he too loves the word of God so much that when he saw the word was and baptism was different he said I want the word &gt;&gt; not what I've had not my tradition but I'll take the word and that's a thrill to my heart to see that there's people who love Jesus Christ that much that'll obey his word &gt;&gt; so so Peter because the Lord has drawn you and opened more of himself to you and you desire to take his name in baptism. It's a privilege for me to baptize you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Oh heavenly father, I lay hands on my brother as the saints of old did. God, praying God that you will bless my brother's obedience. Lord, as you've drawn him by your spirit, I pray you fill him to overflowing and use him as a light wherever he goes. And God, may this that you've poured in him pour out unto others, to his family, his children, and all that's around him. And use him, Lord, like you've promised to use him. May he become a shining light, a bright ember, Lord. And may he go out testifying of your goodness and your grace. Bless my brother, and use him for your glory. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. God bless you, my brother Peter. God bless you all. You can stand. Thank you. [Music] Rivers of living water flowing out through me, making the lame to walk and the blind to see. I know that day is near at hand. Whatever men may say, surrender him your all and you repay. [Music] Elijah went to visit. She hide indeed, asking who gave to eat. She did quickly heed.

And soon those burning gates will open. We'll tread the streets of gold when we all get to heaven. What a day rejoicing that will be. When we all see Jesus, we'll sing and shout the victory. Oh, when we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus. Sing and shout the victory.
