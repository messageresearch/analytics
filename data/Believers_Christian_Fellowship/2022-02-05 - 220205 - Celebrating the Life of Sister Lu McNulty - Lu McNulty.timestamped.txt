[11:00] god bless you and greetings this morning
[11:03] and on behalf of the family and we want
[11:06] to thank you for attending this morning
[11:08] to
[11:09] have a time of memorial and celebration
[11:11] of this wonderful life that has been
[11:13] lived and given to us
[11:16] our sister lou mcnulty
[11:17] was a blessing to all that knew them
[11:19] knew her and to the family
[11:22] and we just want to thank you this
[11:24] morning for being here
[11:27] i
[11:28] want to give my
[11:30] greetings to you all and say god bless
[11:32] you i know that this is a very treasured
[11:35] life that lays here before us
[11:37] and
[11:38] so we just want to take a few moments in
[11:40] the word of the lord this morning to
[11:42] speak to you
[11:44] i'm just speaking to brother jim
[11:46] yesterday about his mother and about the
[11:48] gears of life that she spent here
[11:50] and i said brother jim would to be
[11:52] something that you would have to say
[11:53] about your mom you would like repeated
[11:55] to the congregation this morning
[11:57] and he said brother wayne he said i just
[11:59] i just wanted you and the world to know
[12:02] that my mother
[12:03] was a believer of this end time message
[12:06] she believed this with all of her heart
[12:08] that it was her hope and it was the way
[12:10] we were raised he said she kept us boys
[12:12] in line with it and our family and it
[12:15] was something that she was tied to
[12:17] and you know being able to say that this
[12:19] morning
[12:20] not just because of the profession but
[12:23] because the life she lived she was known
[12:25] as a believer in the heritage and the
[12:28] reputation that was laid was that of a
[12:30] believer
[12:31] so this morning as we gather here
[12:34] at this kind of a time it looks very
[12:36] dark but yet
[12:39] the scriptures say that we sorrow
[12:42] but we do not sorrow as others
[12:45] knowing that there is a hole
[12:47] i'd like to read to you this morning
[12:48] from the book of thessalonians chapter
[12:50] 4.
[12:52] beginning at verse 13
[12:54] apostle paul says i would not have you
[12:57] to be ignorant brethren
[12:59] concerning them which are asleep
[13:03] that you sorrow not even as others which
[13:05] have no hope
[13:07] for we believe that jesus died and rose
[13:09] again
[13:10] even so them which also sleep in jesus
[13:13] will god bring with him
[13:15] for this we say unto you by the word of
[13:17] the lord
[13:18] that we which are alive and remain unto
[13:21] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[13:23] prevent them which are asleep
[13:26] for the lord himself shall descend from
[13:28] heaven with a shout and with the voice
[13:30] of the archangel
[13:31] and with the trump of god
[13:33] the dead and christ shall rise first
[13:36] then we which are alive and remain shall
[13:38] be caught up together with them in the
[13:40] clouds to meet the lord in the air
[13:42] so shall we ever be with the lord
[13:46] wherefore comfort
[13:48] one another with these words
[13:51] i think
[13:52] of the apostle paul writing this to the
[13:55] thessalonians knowing that this would be
[13:57] the comfort to the church this would be
[13:59] the comfort to every believer to know
[14:01] that we have a hope beyond the veil that
[14:04] we now see
[14:06] i look at this generation in this time
[14:09] that we're living
[14:10] and i find that we are a people of
[14:13] limited sight
[14:14] when god gave us the senses of our body
[14:17] and our eyesight was given to us it was
[14:19] only to contact these first three
[14:20] dimensions that we live in
[14:22] of time light and matter
[14:25] so therefore our own sight what we see
[14:27] limits us
[14:29] to what is here this morning
[14:31] but in the generation that we have lived
[14:33] god has given a grace to
[14:36] to send a gift into the earth that we
[14:38] might be able to look beyond the veil
[14:40] with another sight by the sense of faith
[14:43] that we would receive a word of absolute
[14:45] truth concerning what lays beyond the
[14:47] barrier that we now look at called the
[14:49] curtain of time
[14:51] i think of this today as our sister
[14:54] had great faith in what she heard and
[14:56] what she believed her faith was just
[14:59] beyond a confession but it was yet the
[15:01] life that she lived and she lived
[15:03] knowing
[15:04] that there was only just a small curtain
[15:06] between her
[15:07] and everything she knew was true and
[15:09] real
[15:10] i think of this as she was one who
[15:12] received a believer of this end time
[15:15] message having received a prophet in
[15:17] this age
[15:18] knowing that according to scripture that
[15:20] god made a promise at the end of the
[15:22] ages that he would send an eagle a great
[15:25] seer as we would hear it in the book of
[15:27] isaiah it would be called a watchman
[15:30] that would be set upon the tower
[15:32] that could look beyond the realm of what
[15:34] was seen in the immediate
[15:36] this was a prophet of god sent to us
[15:39] brother branham was a tremendous man of
[15:41] god but the gift that he was to this end
[15:44] time church goes beyond the parallel
[15:47] of any of the ministries that god has
[15:49] ever given and because of that gift
[15:51] we have an absolute truth this morning
[15:54] concerning
[15:55] what lays beyond this veil
[15:57] i think of this this morning of this
[15:59] great messenger
[16:01] of how that he would bring to us these
[16:03] truths that he would bring them not just
[16:06] from what he read as i have read to you
[16:08] this morning
[16:09] but yet through the experiences of life
[16:12] through the tragedy of death of his own
[16:14] family
[16:15] brother branham suffering the death of
[16:16] his wife and his daughter
[16:19] had come to a great tragedy of his life
[16:21] but to think the one who would bring the
[16:23] message of what was beyond the curtain
[16:26] with himself experience and look into
[16:28] the to the dark veil of death and to
[16:32] what seemed to be the end of all of his
[16:33] hopes and dreams
[16:36] early one morning getting a call that
[16:37] his wife
[16:39] was laying sick in the hospital nothing
[16:41] the doctors could do tuberculosis taking
[16:44] her life
[16:45] brother branham just that young man
[16:47] running to the hospital 22 year old
[16:49] daughter
[16:50] the scene gets darker as he walks into
[16:52] the halls and his friend dr dare tells
[16:54] him
[16:55] bill she's already gone
[16:57] he walks into the room you remember the
[16:59] sheet was already drawn
[17:01] the darkness was complete looked like
[17:03] the end of all the story
[17:06] but when he began to speak to her
[17:08] he called her name and he said
[17:11] hope
[17:13] see hope was not in the hospital any
[17:15] longer
[17:16] but hope was beyond the veil
[17:19] hope returned from the other side
[17:22] and began to speak to brother branham
[17:24] beyond the grave
[17:25] and said why have you called me back
[17:27] brother brown
[17:28] the thing that you have preached the
[17:30] thing that you called the holy ghost
[17:32] that's what this is bill she said when
[17:35] you called me i was going down a great
[17:37] avenue and it looked oriental with great
[17:39] big birds and trees and the men in white
[17:41] was leading me
[17:42] and you called me back bill
[17:45] you remember when she told him what was
[17:47] there and then she said now whatever you
[17:49] do you raise our children in this way
[17:52] that you call holy roller or the way of
[17:54] the holy ghost this that's beyond bill
[17:57] it's perfect love it is the holy ghost
[18:00] it wasn't this time alone that brother
[18:02] branham would receive hope from the
[18:04] other side
[18:05] but yet remember just a few days later
[18:07] great depression set on him as he began
[18:09] to look at the darkness more than the
[18:11] light
[18:12] and then that time he had the dream and
[18:15] or was carried into another dimension
[18:17] and he met a young ladies he's walking
[18:20] along and he was singing about the wagon
[18:22] and the trail and and he a little young
[18:25] woman walked up and began to talk to him
[18:27] and she called him daddy and brother
[18:30] branham turned and looked at her and
[18:31] said you call me daddy
[18:33] and she said yeah daddy she said i was
[18:36] your little sharon rose when we were on
[18:38] the earth
[18:39] and he thought back of course a little
[18:41] six-month-old girl
[18:43] standing there as a grown woman
[18:45] calling him daddy
[18:48] he looked
[18:49] confused thought confused brother brown
[18:50] said she said to me
[18:53] daddy don't you remember your teaching
[18:55] on immortality
[18:57] it's always been a marvel to me because
[18:59] she was only six months old she would
[19:01] have never understood or heard
[19:03] what he taught on immortality
[19:06] but yet up in heaven they know what
[19:08] william branham teaches on immortality
[19:10] they know it to be the truth
[19:12] because the doctrine that he carries
[19:14] according to immortality is not a
[19:15] doctrine that he read from a book or
[19:17] just got from ideas but it's heaven's
[19:20] truth
[19:21] it's what really happens to a person
[19:23] when they go beyond this veil these
[19:26] experiences stacked up into his life to
[19:28] give him a confidence a truth to preach
[19:31] the power of god and the life eternal
[19:34] life
[19:35] by the realities of jesus christ it's
[19:38] when he was about 50 years old again
[19:40] brother branham carried into a little
[19:41] bit of depression and laying in his bed
[19:44] and the lord began to speak to him press
[19:46] the battle bill press the battle
[19:48] and he said would it help you if you
[19:50] could look beyond the curtain and that
[19:52] famous sermon beyond the curtain of time
[19:54] was given when brother branham put his
[19:56] hands behind his head and was carried
[19:58] beyond the realms into the sixth
[19:59] dimension
[20:00] and there he saw millions of believers
[20:02] running to him
[20:04] at first he thinking they were all
[20:06] branhams and someone said to him said no
[20:08] these are your converts bill
[20:11] these are your converts these are the
[20:12] ones that believed these are the ones
[20:14] and when they began running toward him
[20:16] he said there they were all young people
[20:18] 22 years old in the
[20:20] in the prime of life remember his
[20:22] explanations of it when they began to
[20:25] shout out to him if you had not come we
[20:27] wouldn't be here
[20:29] to think that that message had so
[20:31] convinced them to believe upon the lord
[20:33] that they were in another dimension
[20:35] because of the word which they had heard
[20:39] it was in this place that brother
[20:40] branham would
[20:42] would see
[20:43] that the theophany was a reality it was
[20:46] a real body he said i was wondering what
[20:48] we would be in that celestial
[20:50] but it was there remember that he said
[20:52] they embraced him and hugged him and
[20:54] there he talked with them and he found
[20:56] that it was a real body
[20:59] not just a cloud floating
[21:01] not just up there playing a heart but
[21:03] brother brahm said a real body just like
[21:06] you are this morning that theophany is a
[21:09] real body there's no babies there and
[21:11] there's no old age there and there's no
[21:13] sickness no sorrow but there is a
[21:16] perfect body a body that has been
[21:18] prepared for you according to the lord
[21:20] jesus and the book of john he said
[21:23] that he would go and prepare a place for
[21:25] you and come again to receive you unto
[21:27] himself that there would be a place or a
[21:30] mansion brother brown said of course it
[21:31] meant a body there's a body prepared for
[21:34] you i think this morning of what brother
[21:37] branham said when he heard the voice of
[21:40] him saying that brother branham when you
[21:43] stand and are judged for the words you
[21:45] preached if you are accepted and you
[21:47] will be
[21:48] then we will be received with you
[21:51] and remember he said what paul preached
[21:54] i preached
[21:55] and they all with one voice said we're
[21:57] resting
[21:58] we're resting on that that's the rest of
[22:01] every believer this morning that this
[22:03] message is not something that is a fairy
[22:05] tale or some figment of imagination but
[22:08] it is a reality it is heaven's truth i
[22:11] think of this this morning according to
[22:13] apostle paul he went to that same realm
[22:16] and said that he knew a man that had
[22:18] been caught up there and remember he
[22:20] talks about the translation and what he
[22:22] saw in the third heavens but when
[22:24] apostle paul said saw it he come back
[22:26] and said that he was caught up into
[22:28] paradise he said and it is seeing things
[22:31] that was not lawful to be uttered
[22:34] paul wasn't able to tell you the details
[22:37] of the theophany he wasn't able to tell
[22:39] you the details of what happened in that
[22:41] dimension or what it was but he did
[22:43] write of it a few words when he said in
[22:45] the book of corinthians that if this
[22:47] earthly house of tabernacle were
[22:49] dissolved we have a building of god
[22:52] a house not made with hands eternal in
[22:55] the heavens paul knew that it was there
[22:58] but i think it's amazing he only wrote
[23:00] just a few words concerning it but when
[23:02] brother branham returned from that other
[23:04] land he made a tape
[23:06] and he made sermons and he made books
[23:09] and he published what was beyond the
[23:11] veil
[23:12] because it was the season it was now
[23:14] lawful for these things to be released
[23:15] to the church because there was
[23:17] believers that is on the cusp of the
[23:20] change from one dimension to another
[23:22] i think of this today of god given us
[23:25] such realities and first john john says
[23:28] beloved we are now the sons of god and
[23:30] doth not yet appear what we shall be but
[23:32] we know
[23:33] that when he shall appear we shall be
[23:35] like him for we shall see him as he is
[23:38] when brother adam reads that scripture
[23:40] he said it did not yet appear
[23:42] he said but it's not it's not even been
[23:44] revealed he said but i saw it
[23:48] i was there
[23:49] he went beyond that grave and come back
[23:52] and told us what was beyond the realm
[23:54] and if we are believers this morning we
[23:56] have a hope
[23:57] that is far beyond the hope of just
[23:59] thinking maybe it could be but there's a
[24:01] reality of what lays beyond the veil
[24:04] this is the season that god released the
[24:07] great mystery of the theophany and our
[24:10] sister was a believer she was such a
[24:12] believer that the words of a prophet
[24:15] anchored in her heart and she rested
[24:17] that this would be her guide and this
[24:19] would be her life beyond this region i
[24:22] say this this morning knowing that we
[24:24] are living in a in a generation of of
[24:27] change and we're living in a generation
[24:29] of criticism and agnostics and unbelief
[24:32] but let me assure you one thing this
[24:34] morning there is a reality to the word
[24:36] which we have heard in this generation
[24:37] that's an absolute truth
[24:40] concerning what god has intended for his
[24:42] church
[24:43] it has been released in this season
[24:45] concerning the theophany but isn't it
[24:48] amazing i'm just rehearsing it last
[24:50] night thinking over
[24:52] of the season that we live in this great
[24:54] angel of revelations 10 this brother jim
[24:57] to reveal the dawn to reveal the mystery
[25:00] of what we're looking at here this
[25:01] morning
[25:03] and it was when apostle paul spoke of
[25:05] melchizedek as he did beyond the realm
[25:07] he just spoke a few words
[25:09] and then he said according to this he
[25:11] said
[25:12] this doesn't belong to this age
[25:14] he said but it does belong to them that
[25:16] are of a full age
[25:18] i have many things to say but cannot say
[25:20] them now concerning melchizedek but when
[25:22] brother branham came and spoke of
[25:24] melchizedek
[25:26] he made tapes who is this melchizedek
[25:29] this great king melchizedek he told us
[25:31] the depths of the mystery of melchizedek
[25:34] and it's amazing that the mystery behind
[25:36] melchizedek is that it was the theophany
[25:39] of god in a human flesh
[25:42] that the reality of theophany became a
[25:45] reality in this great end time
[25:48] when this theophany took flesh and met
[25:50] with abraham
[25:52] you remember just shortly before
[25:54] abraham's body changed melchizedek came
[25:56] to him and there was a change
[25:58] it wasn't
[26:00] too many hundreds of years later that
[26:02] that same melchizedek came
[26:05] and was known as jesus christ
[26:07] who was the son of david and the son of
[26:09] abraham the only two men in the bible
[26:11] that spoke of melchizedek and jesus was
[26:14] called their son
[26:16] that melchizedek became jesus christ is
[26:19] true
[26:20] and in the time when this milk hazard it
[26:22] came there was a resurrection
[26:25] but in the last days when melchizedek
[26:27] returns to the church there will be both
[26:30] a body change
[26:32] and a resurrection
[26:33] and we are living in the season when
[26:35] melchizedek has returned in the form of
[26:38] the word to the church of the living god
[26:41] we are not here blind this morning we
[26:43] are not here we are here awaiting our
[26:45] change
[26:46] as apostle paul would say who is it that
[26:49] can change this vile body
[26:51] whether that you fall asleep
[26:54] or whether you're alive you're going to
[26:56] need a change and there's only one thing
[26:58] that can change anyone and that is god
[27:01] the presence of god in job 14 job
[27:03] recorded this when he said if a man dies
[27:06] shall he live again
[27:07] and all the days of my appointed time
[27:10] will i wait till my change comes
[27:13] when when the change came to job he was
[27:15] beyond the veil and he was no more than
[27:17] a teaspoon of ashes laying in a tomb
[27:21] but in matthew 27 when jesus arose job
[27:24] arose with him
[27:25] he arose in a body a real body amen
[27:28] because he said thou shall call and i
[27:31] will answer and thou shall have a desire
[27:33] work of thy hand
[27:35] i i believe this morning as we speak
[27:37] over this
[27:39] matriarch this daughter of god this
[27:41] great believer the gift that god gave
[27:43] this family
[27:45] to hold them into the word of life i
[27:47] believe as we speak over this morning
[27:50] that there will be a morning when time
[27:52] is released for that great resurrection
[27:55] and whatever
[27:56] the grave is it will not be able to hold
[27:59] her
[28:00] whatever
[28:01] that she has found in god will raise her
[28:04] up there will be a roll call and this
[28:06] time it won't be just for resurrection
[28:08] it'll be a resurrection and a body
[28:10] change
[28:11] we are living on the cusp we're living
[28:13] in the moments that before this service
[28:16] is out before this day is finished these
[28:18] loved ones could reappear right among us
[28:20] in this very hour friends this is upon
[28:23] us
[28:24] i i believe with all of my heart that
[28:27] there are people sitting in this room
[28:29] that will never know what a funeral is
[28:31] but they'll be changed in their atoms i
[28:34] believe the moments of the resurrection
[28:35] are around us i believe the presence of
[28:37] god is already filling the earth i
[28:40] believe the angels of the lord are here
[28:42] gathering us getting this thing ready i
[28:44] believe this i believe that christianity
[28:47] is the only truth there is i believe
[28:49] that there is a resurrection power that
[28:51] lays within every believer this morning
[28:54] that has received that great gift of god
[28:56] i happen to believe what our sister
[28:59] believed
[29:00] i believed in resurrection not in
[29:02] replacement i believe that the son
[29:04] testifies
[29:06] of my faith i believe the trees testify
[29:08] of my faith the flowers which are here
[29:11] on this on this morning on this altar
[29:14] they testify of what i believe all
[29:16] nature testifies that there will be a
[29:19] resurrection and nothing shall hold it
[29:21] from coming i believe that this morning
[29:24] i believe the great resurrection is upon
[29:26] us and i'm glad to be able to be a part
[29:28] of it i'm glad to know
[29:30] that the same creator
[29:33] that gave that flower life
[29:35] and gave the tree life
[29:37] is the same one that gave us life
[29:40] and he said he would raise it up again
[29:43] i want to leave you this morning
[29:45] with the comfort of these words
[29:48] this is no longer a mystery
[29:51] our sister is in a land
[29:53] in a theophany body
[29:55] waiting that moment i pray it'd be a
[29:57] comfort to you
[29:59] god bless you this morning if you just
[30:01] bow your hearts
[30:02] heavenly father we thank you today
[30:05] we ask you lord for your blessing upon
[30:08] this family
[30:09] lord upon the friends the great lost
[30:11] that will be known in their lives
[30:14] our sister lord
[30:16] as job said the lord gave
[30:20] and the lord took
[30:22] but lord this morning you gave a mother
[30:25] and a wife
[30:27] you gave lord you gave peace and comfort
[30:29] to a home
[30:31] and father this morning i pray that your
[30:33] word
[30:34] your word would be given this morning to
[30:36] this home to this family
[30:38] may there be words of comfort throughout
[30:41] the days lord whenever they think on
[30:43] these things lord
[30:45] may they be able to grain a comfort from
[30:47] your word
[30:48] now father we commit this into thy
[30:50] faithful hands
[30:52] in the name of jesus christ we pray
[30:55] amen
[30:56] god bless you god bless you family
[30:59] brother ray
[31:00] god bless you brother dawn
[31:03] brother john brother jim family
[31:08] as brother tommy said we go back a long
[31:10] ways
[31:12] i think we
[31:15] our family moved here in 1978
[31:18] i think brother don you moved here in 79
[31:21] or around 79.
[31:24] so
[31:26] we've known each other and
[31:28] walked this
[31:30] avenue of life together many hours i
[31:33] know brother don sister lou and ruth and
[31:36] i
[31:36] spend a lot of time together
[31:39] a lot of memories together
[31:43] you recognize that
[31:46] life is very frail
[31:50] life is very short
[31:52] you know you have young people sitting
[31:54] here this morning that you think life is
[31:56] going to go on forever
[31:59] but the most important thing to do
[32:03] is to have your life prepared
[32:06] this little short span of time has
[32:08] nothing to do
[32:10] or i shouldn't say nothing to do but
[32:11] it's
[32:12] it's so small compared to eternity
[32:17] and so
[32:19] the lord jesus
[32:20] has given us an opportunity
[32:23] while we're here yet in this earth to
[32:25] make a choice
[32:27] and the prophet of god said
[32:30] even the choice
[32:32] that we make
[32:33] can determine our
[32:35] eternal destiny
[32:38] so we thank god for the promise
[32:41] be given on to us brother wayne talked
[32:43] much about the theophany
[32:45] i was thinking this morning
[32:49] the other morning when
[32:50] [Music]
[32:52] sister lou
[32:54] at i think around four o'clock in the
[32:56] morning step through the veil
[32:59] we had a prophet tell us
[33:03] that that theophany came and picked up
[33:05] that redeemed soul
[33:08] and he said if we live to see the coming
[33:10] of the lord and the translation
[33:12] we take this body or this soul
[33:15] and
[33:16] go to our theophany
[33:20] we're so thankful for
[33:23] the promised word of god and i just want
[33:26] to read
[33:27] a scripture in romans
[33:31] chapter eight
[33:33] moreover whom we did it
[33:36] predestinate then he also called
[33:41] and whom he called them he also
[33:43] justified
[33:46] and whom he justified
[33:48] then he also glorified
[33:52] the prophet was telling us once you have
[33:54] to receive the holy ghost
[33:57] in your being
[34:00] that that has a seed
[34:03] the seed has been quickened
[34:05] and that seed within that seed
[34:08] is everything that's needed for this
[34:10] life's journey
[34:13] so in the foreknowledge of god
[34:16] sister lou was in that for knowledge
[34:20] he knew that she would be born in a
[34:22] certain day and he knew
[34:25] her walk of life
[34:27] in other words a believer
[34:29] the plan of that son or daughter of god
[34:32] is all planned out you know we
[34:35] we we think we got it
[34:37] we're running the show but we're not
[34:38] really
[34:39] because almighty god has that believer
[34:42] under control
[34:44] and so
[34:46] because we are in the foreknowledge of
[34:48] god
[34:49] we predestinate it
[34:51] to make it
[34:53] so like we have the foreknowledge of god
[34:54] here we have the destiny here and so in
[34:58] between here the prophet of god said we
[35:00] bypassed our theophany
[35:03] and we were
[35:04] we were here to be tested and tried and
[35:08] and go through life's journey and
[35:11] and making many mistakes but
[35:13] god almighty has our his leadership in
[35:16] our life
[35:18] and so we we see here this morning that
[35:22] uh sister lou had an experience of god i
[35:25] didn't go back with brother dawn and and
[35:27] to see what year it was and whatever but
[35:29] because she was a seed of god
[35:32] she had a sea that could be quickened
[35:34] and so when this great message came over
[35:37] this age
[35:39] amen it it spoke to her heart and drew
[35:42] her into the kingdom of god and gave her
[35:45] a baptism of the holy ghost and gave her
[35:48] a new birth
[35:50] and paul was john
[35:52] john was speaking to us and saying
[35:54] verily verily i say unto you except the
[35:57] man be born again
[35:59] he cannot see the kingdom of god
[36:02] jesus answered he said verily verily
[36:05] i say unto you
[36:07] except the man be born of the water in
[36:09] the spirit
[36:11] he cannot enter
[36:12] into the kingdom of god you know i think
[36:15] that's why
[36:16] many people are
[36:18] sometimes they're trying to believe
[36:21] they're trying to believe but unless
[36:23] the one that's the interpreter of the
[36:25] word leaves within you
[36:28] you'll never be able to believe
[36:30] but when you're a seed of god
[36:32] god knows
[36:34] exactly what you have need of at a
[36:36] certain time and a certain amount of
[36:38] revelation for that certain day to keep
[36:41] you moving forward
[36:43] and there's
[36:44] really no death to a believer
[36:48] you know this flesh
[36:50] this flesh goes
[36:52] down this flesh
[36:55] you know
[36:57] resurrection was
[36:59] spoken all the way from the oldest book
[37:01] in the bible job
[37:03] amen
[37:04] resurrection was spoken all through the
[37:06] prophets
[37:08] resurrection was spoken through jesus
[37:11] for he was the
[37:13] resurrection
[37:15] and then we came we came and paul spoke
[37:18] about the resurrection and timothy spoke
[37:20] about the resurrection different ones
[37:22] spoke about the resurrection
[37:24] and along comes the prophet of god and
[37:26] speaks about the resurrection in a
[37:28] deeper manner that we've ever heard
[37:31] we had the bible for all these years
[37:36] but as the prophet william branham spoke
[37:39] and said that we have a greater witness
[37:43] in this age
[37:45] of the resurrection we have a firmer
[37:47] witness
[37:49] of the resurrection
[37:51] you know
[37:53] the prophet and a couple of brothers
[37:54] were out fishing one day
[37:57] and
[37:59] they caught this fish and he caught this
[38:01] fish and
[38:02] pulled the entos right out of it
[38:05] and it so happened that the spoken word
[38:09] was now in existence
[38:11] and so he said the lord jesus
[38:14] little fishy i give you by the name of
[38:16] jesus christ your life back to you
[38:20] and you know there was all kinds of
[38:22] children and all kinds of cancer
[38:24] cases
[38:25] all kinds of sickness
[38:28] at the same time
[38:30] almighty god was showing
[38:32] that amen
[38:34] he could do whatever he wants to
[38:36] he could raise whoever he wants to he
[38:39] could take whatever life there was and
[38:41] raise it up he was showing
[38:44] that jesus christ
[38:46] is interested in the most insignificant
[38:49] thing
[38:50] in your life
[38:51] and in my life
[38:53] sometimes we think oh you know we don't
[38:55] want to bother them in prayer because it
[38:57] it seems so small you know what he's
[39:00] interested
[39:01] you know he may be going through
[39:03] something right here today you may be
[39:04] sitting here today and you think it's so
[39:06] insignificant and and and you know he's
[39:09] interested in it
[39:11] you know what he's interested in because
[39:12] you're his son and daughter you're his
[39:15] child this morning he's interested in
[39:18] your hurts he's interested in your
[39:20] frustrations
[39:22] he's interested in your emotions
[39:25] i say thanks be to god we serve a living
[39:28] christ that's interested so much in our
[39:31] life's journey that he pre-planted from
[39:33] our birth to our death
[39:36] i say glory to god
[39:40] if we can serve a god like that
[39:42] that we can serve a god
[39:44] amen and when you've got jesus christ in
[39:47] your soul
[39:51] if he says yes
[39:53] it's good enough
[39:55] if he says no
[39:57] that's still good enough
[39:59] if he says wait a while that's still
[40:01] good enough
[40:02] to a believer
[40:06] i was speaking about the book of job
[40:09] i'm going to read in the
[40:12] 20 or the 33rd chapter he said yea
[40:16] his soul
[40:18] draw near unto the grave
[40:21] and his life to the destroyers
[40:25] if there be a messenger with him
[40:27] an interpreter how many ways we had a
[40:29] messenger
[40:30] an interpreter
[40:32] one among a thousand
[40:34] to show unto man his uprightness
[40:39] then he is gracious unto him
[40:42] and saith deliver him
[40:44] from the going down to the pit
[40:46] i have found a ransom or i have found an
[40:50] atonement
[40:52] o praise be to god
[40:56] his flesh shall be fresher than a
[40:59] child's
[41:01] he shall return to the days of his youth
[41:05] i love what brother branham said you
[41:06] know
[41:07] you know almighty god he said took a
[41:09] picture of you
[41:11] before the foundation of the world
[41:16] and that profile
[41:18] can never be disturbed
[41:21] it doesn't make any difference if it's
[41:23] death by
[41:24] whatever manner
[41:26] that profile is always
[41:28] there
[41:29] in heaven
[41:31] so
[41:32] cecilia took a
[41:34] journey in life
[41:37] she was an express word of god for this
[41:40] age
[41:43] you don't have to be a preacher
[41:45] you don't have to be a great prophet
[41:47] he could be a housewife
[41:49] and be the manifestation of jesus christ
[41:53] you know our sister loved the lord with
[41:56] all her heart and all her mind all her
[41:57] soul
[41:59] she was an
[42:00] example of the vindication that this
[42:03] word is true
[42:06] that it's possible
[42:09] it's possible to live a life beyond the
[42:11] flesh
[42:13] it's possible for jesus christ to live
[42:16] in human flesh
[42:18] it's possible to be the bride of jesus
[42:21] christ redeemed by the blood of the lamb
[42:24] i say thanks be to god
[42:27] she's leaving the legacy back to her
[42:30] family to her husband to us as the
[42:33] saints that knew her
[42:37] that she's not here
[42:39] she's in the land beyond the river
[42:42] she's a land where there'll be no more
[42:45] heartaches
[42:46] no more heart attacks
[42:49] no more aching in the flesh
[42:54] but while she was here she was formed
[42:57] into the image of the word
[42:59] she was formed into the character of the
[43:01] word
[43:03] but the brandon said that's all we take
[43:04] with us
[43:06] is our character
[43:09] we're not going to take our jobs we're
[43:11] not going to take our popularity we're
[43:12] not going to take our money
[43:15] we're going to take the christ-like
[43:16] character
[43:18] that's all
[43:20] that we will take
[43:22] with us
[43:34] i think of speaking about the
[43:35] resurrection
[43:38] i've always marveled at this
[43:41] what the prophet of god said that jesus
[43:44] christ
[43:46] had more success
[43:48] in my ministry
[43:50] here in jeffersonville indiana
[43:52] than he had in capernaum
[43:55] how many believers remember that
[43:58] he's not talking about william branham
[44:00] had that success
[44:01] he's talking about jesus christ
[44:04] had that success
[44:07] that there was more
[44:09] supernatural done
[44:12] in the life of brother ranum's ministry
[44:16] than there was
[44:17] [Music]
[44:19] in the land of israel when jesus christ
[44:22] was there
[44:24] we've had a
[44:26] visitation
[44:28] like no other age has ever had
[44:32] i think most of us here this morning
[44:34] are believers
[44:36] and so when we talk about a message
[44:40] i think sometimes they think about the
[44:42] message as something different
[44:44] than the bible
[44:47] but if you really have a revelation of
[44:48] the message it's christ
[44:52] it's not william branham
[44:54] in fact in paul's day it really wasn't
[44:56] paul
[44:57] it was the same jesus christ
[45:00] so we are
[45:02] we as the five full ministry it's not
[45:04] really us
[45:06] but we're speaking the word of god which
[45:08] is jesus christ
[45:10] and so if i quote from the scripture or
[45:12] if i quote from the message it's jesus
[45:14] christ
[45:16] he's a living god he's the same
[45:18] yesterday today and forever
[45:22] you know satan really doesn't have
[45:26] anything to do with the believer's
[45:28] destiny
[45:30] you know
[45:31] you know he thinks he's going to stop
[45:32] you at a certain time and
[45:34] oh he thinks that's the end of you and
[45:37] god raises you up
[45:38] you may come to your deathbed but if it
[45:41] isn't your time just remember if it
[45:43] isn't your time
[45:44] you'll stay here
[45:46] but like the prophet of god said
[45:49] if we're if he's finished with us and if
[45:51] we're finished and he's finished with
[45:53] the purpose of god for our lives why
[45:54] would we want to stay any longer
[45:58] i want to dwell a little bit on that
[45:59] purpose
[46:01] and i just spoke about it last sunday at
[46:03] the church actually
[46:06] but the purpose of god
[46:08] that the lord has for you as a believer
[46:12] there's nothing that can destroy that
[46:17] yay through the yeah i walk through the
[46:19] valley of the shadow of the dead brother
[46:20] venom said now that's not a dark valley
[46:23] that's a shadow and in order to be a
[46:25] shadow there has to be a light
[46:28] right
[46:30] so the purpose of god
[46:34] nothing can defeat
[46:36] that purpose that he has
[46:39] because you you and i have a purpose to
[46:42] fulfill
[46:43] some purpose here on earth
[46:45] we're not here just to be born and die
[46:48] but a believer
[46:50] is the manifestation
[46:52] of the word of god
[46:54] she's nothing but jesus christ living
[46:58] in flesh
[47:01] only the believers of this message can
[47:03] accept that
[47:04] because it sounds like antichrist
[47:07] it sounds like you're putting yourself
[47:09] beyond jesus christ we're not putting
[47:11] ourselves listen
[47:12] they accused jesus
[47:14] he said you're making yourself god
[47:17] he really wasn't making himself god god
[47:20] made him god
[47:23] we're not really making ourselves the
[47:25] bride of jesus christ he said you are
[47:26] the jesus christ the bride of jesus
[47:28] christ
[47:30] oh my
[47:31] there's so much we could speak about
[47:33] this morning
[47:35] and talking about this
[47:36] purpose of god
[47:38] i want to
[47:40] carry on with romans 8
[47:43] what shall we then say to these things
[47:46] if god before us
[47:49] who can be against us
[47:52] he that spared not his own son
[47:55] but delivered them up for us all
[47:58] how shall he not with him also
[48:00] freely give us all things
[48:04] who shall lay anything to the charge
[48:07] of god's elect
[48:09] it is god
[48:11] that justifies
[48:14] who is either condemned
[48:16] it is christ that died
[48:18] he rather
[48:20] that he is risen again
[48:22] who is even at the right hand of god
[48:26] who also
[48:27] make an intercession for us
[48:30] who shall separate us
[48:32] from the love of christ
[48:34] shall tribulation
[48:36] or distress
[48:38] or persecution
[48:40] or famine
[48:42] or nakedness or pearl in other words
[48:45] danger
[48:46] or sword
[48:48] as it is written
[48:50] for thy sake
[48:52] we are killed all the day long
[48:55] we are accounted
[48:56] as sheep for the slaughter
[49:00] nay in all these things
[49:03] we are more than conquerors
[49:06] through him that loved us
[49:08] for i am persuaded
[49:11] that neither death
[49:13] nor life
[49:14] nor angels
[49:16] nor principalities
[49:18] nor powers
[49:20] nor things present
[49:21] nor things to come
[49:24] nor height
[49:25] nor death depth
[49:27] nor any other creature shall be able to
[49:30] separate us from the love of god which
[49:33] is in christ jesus
[49:36] our lord
[49:37] praise be to god
[49:41] i want to read a quote from things that
[49:42] are to be if you just give me
[49:45] the liberty
[49:46] he said the old earthly tabernacle here
[49:49] you know what it is
[49:52] this body is like an old coat that you
[49:54] wear
[49:55] a coat that you once wear
[49:59] but now you have one so much better
[50:02] you don't use it anymore what do you do
[50:05] you hang it in the closet
[50:07] before you got one better
[50:09] you got a better coat
[50:12] it's more up-to-date than the one you
[50:13] used to wear that's worn out what is
[50:15] that garment
[50:17] you are the inside of that there
[50:20] that garment only done
[50:22] bore your image
[50:24] but you don't need it anymore
[50:27] you hung it up
[50:28] it's a rag
[50:31] that's the way this whole body is you're
[50:33] it's bore the image of the heavenly
[50:36] yet it is not you
[50:39] you are inside of that body
[50:42] you the spirit of god is on the inside
[50:45] of that body
[50:46] that's what makes the outside come into
[50:49] subjection
[50:50] because the inside is pulling in see
[50:54] bring it in line with the word of god
[50:56] you're inside yourself your being
[51:00] this body
[51:02] is just an old coat
[51:05] and someday what will you do with it
[51:09] for you was only a garment for a while
[51:12] that is like the earthly garment this
[51:14] body
[51:15] your real body your real self is on the
[51:17] inside of that old coat
[51:20] and now i know he said william brown but
[51:22] i'll say sister lou mcnulty
[51:26] someday it will hang
[51:28] in the earth's hall of memory of you
[51:32] you'll put it out yonder in the grave
[51:34] and
[51:34] somebody will put a tombstone up
[51:37] here lives so and so
[51:41] it'll lay there for a memorial of you
[51:45] the people just seen you in this
[51:47] and what you was
[51:48] your real you
[51:50] was on the inside
[51:52] of that
[51:54] oh my
[52:04] i think brother wayne
[52:06] related to this
[52:08] but in closing out
[52:10] i'll be closing in in a moment
[52:15] but when all of those ran up to the
[52:17] prophet beyond the curtain of time
[52:23] and said my precious brother
[52:27] then he said another
[52:29] woman hugged me and hope turned and
[52:31] hugged the other young woman
[52:35] i said i don't understand this
[52:39] this is something entirely different
[52:42] from our human love
[52:46] and this is what brother branham said
[52:48] [Music]
[52:50] i don't want to go back to that old body
[52:53] on the bed
[52:54] remember he was translated
[52:56] he was taken up
[52:59] then a voice spoke to me
[53:03] this is what you preached
[53:05] that the holy ghost is
[53:11] this
[53:12] is perfect love
[53:15] and nothing
[53:16] can enter here
[53:18] without it
[53:21] i'd say today if you're sitting here
[53:22] without the holy ghost
[53:25] you're missing out on the greatest event
[53:29] that will ever be to mankind
[53:32] is a resurrection
[53:37] just think sister lou lived beyond the
[53:40] promise
[53:42] according to the scripture by 13 years
[53:47] she was given those years for a purpose
[53:53] this is what you
[53:54] preached is the holy ghost
[54:01] brother branham was wondering
[54:04] about in the
[54:06] you know
[54:08] he was saying someday he'll come to you
[54:10] and
[54:11] you're sent for a leader and god will
[54:13] come and when he does he'll judge you
[54:15] according to what you taught them
[54:18] first whether they go in or not
[54:22] we'll go in according to your teaching
[54:26] and that's when he asked will paul
[54:29] have to stand that will peter understand
[54:31] that
[54:35] and the voice said yes
[54:39] and the prophet of god got so happy
[54:42] he said i preached every word they
[54:44] preached
[54:48] i never deviated from it
[54:51] one side to the other
[54:53] were they baptized in the name of jesus
[54:55] christ i did too
[54:56] where they taught the baptism of the
[54:58] holy ghost i did too
[55:00] and then people screamed and said we
[55:02] know that
[55:04] and we know we're going with you someday
[55:06] back to earth
[55:08] jesus will come and you'll be judged
[55:09] according to the word that you preach
[55:11] this
[55:14] and then if you are accepted at that
[55:16] time which you will be
[55:18] then you will present us to him
[55:20] as your trophies
[55:22] of your ministry
[55:29] how many believes the prophet
[55:31] brought us what paul preached
[55:36] how many believes
[55:38] that he brought us what peter preached
[55:45] then don't we have an assurance
[55:48] if we'll stay with this word
[55:53] i think we got a word
[55:57] that's more than mechanics
[56:01] it's more than book learning
[56:05] it's when the dynamic strikes it and it
[56:07] brings a life
[56:10] that's the reality of jesus christ
[56:12] that's the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:15] that's the fire of god that's in your
[56:17] bosom
[56:19] they'll bring you to a living reality
[56:21] that jesus christ rose from the dead
[56:24] and he's alive today
[56:27] and you are the manifestation
[56:29] and sister mcnulty was the manifestation
[56:34] of that word
[56:35] and of that resurrection
[56:38] the mainnaulty family i love you
[56:44] the loved ones that are here
[56:46] we love you
[56:47] we love you all in the name of jesus
[56:49] this morning
[56:51] because you are the family of god
[56:55] excuse me
[56:57] and one day
[56:59] we'll spend eternity together
[57:04] we'll spend eternity together
[57:07] let's pray together lord jesus
[57:13] what a hope we have within us
[57:19] we sorrel not as other sorrow
[57:22] yet we do sorrow
[57:27] i pray in the coming days lord that
[57:29] you'll be with brother dawn and
[57:31] brother jim's family brother john's and
[57:33] all the loved ones sisters brothers

[57:40] then in the coming days it'll become
[57:42] more of a reality to brother don that
[57:46] the home is not exactly like it was
[57:51] but lord
[57:53] you're our comforter
[57:56] you're our peace
[57:59] in the time of storm

[1:00:59] me
[1:01:02] [Music]
[1:01:25] well i didn't trip coming up there so i
[1:01:27] think i might be okay
[1:01:28] just want to say real quick just thanks
[1:01:30] to everyone that
[1:01:32] took time out of their schedule today
[1:01:33] the musicians and
[1:01:35] brother tommy he says we go my earliest
[1:01:37] memory where tommy was he slept on the
[1:01:39] couch a lot so as a little kid but how
[1:01:42] he did that with all the kids
[1:01:43] especially his kids now
[1:01:46] anyways i
[1:01:47] when this was going you know started
[1:01:49] happening it's like ain't no way i'm
[1:01:52] doing anything cause you know i'm just
[1:01:53] gonna sit down there and
[1:01:56] you know be me grumpy
[1:01:59] or grampy i guess but
[1:02:01] anyways my uncle frank had posted
[1:02:03] something on the website and it's like
[1:02:05] wow
[1:02:06] we need to we need to read that because
[1:02:09] he
[1:02:10] talked in the gym and it's like how many
[1:02:11] times that uncle frank was around all of
[1:02:13] us you know
[1:02:15] probably a dozen not even that but
[1:02:18] while he uh a hero really uh
[1:02:21] kind of struck me and then some other
[1:02:23] people had made some comments too that i
[1:02:24] thought you know
[1:02:26] you think you know your mom and dad but
[1:02:28] other people had perspective too so it's
[1:02:30] like
[1:02:32] uh
[1:02:33] anyways before i get all weepy here and
[1:02:36] had everybody sitting there wishing i
[1:02:38] hadn't come up here but uncle frank
[1:02:40] anyways he said
[1:02:42] lula was passionate about everything she
[1:02:43] did or believed
[1:02:45] as a child on grassy creek she was
[1:02:47] willing to enter into all the childhood
[1:02:49] adventures that the short children
[1:02:51] partook of
[1:02:53] and that was not how i remember my mom
[1:02:55] she was not a risk taker so apparently
[1:02:58] when she was younger
[1:02:59] she uh must have been a little bit of
[1:03:01] maybe that's what attracted dad to her
[1:03:03] you know i don't know
[1:03:06] yeah it is a miracle that some of us did
[1:03:08] not end up injured or facing worse
[1:03:11] she and don raised two boys different as
[1:03:14] night and day but all i can so many ways
[1:03:16] and i'm like wow
[1:03:18] he picked that up seeing us six times
[1:03:19] because yeah everybody knows us
[1:03:22] we're a little bit different but
[1:03:24] anyways
[1:03:25] and then
[1:03:26] it always seemed to keep things on an
[1:03:27] even kill and she did that
[1:03:30] you know jim would be up here i'd be
[1:03:32] down here or vice versa but you know
[1:03:34] they managed to keep us
[1:03:36] keep us pretty much in line
[1:03:38] and this is the one that kind of really
[1:03:40] made me laugh she had a ready smile and
[1:03:43] a ready frown if she did not agree with
[1:03:45] the person she was talking to and
[1:03:47] i'm sure my kids were on the receiving
[1:03:49] end of that frown i know i was and of
[1:03:51] course even my my cousins you know
[1:03:55] yeah you didn't want to you know as they
[1:03:57] called her mama you didn't want to get
[1:03:58] on her bad side sometimes but
[1:04:01] anyways and then she and i must have
[1:04:03] inherited that same squinting i'd frown
[1:04:05] from the assing plan so yeah we've seen
[1:04:07] that before too
[1:04:09] i know she'll be missed by all the
[1:04:10] grandchildren great-grandchildren nieces
[1:04:12] and nephews there are still seven short
[1:04:14] siblings to reminisce discuss and
[1:04:17] cherish her memory
[1:04:19] and we pray that
[1:04:20] we pray that we all have made the grade
[1:04:22] with our creator
[1:04:24] and that the ed short family will have a
[1:04:25] great reunion ever heard of in our
[1:04:27] future home
[1:04:29] and then don thank you for being there
[1:04:31] for lou at all times
[1:04:33] i admire your fathering grandfathering
[1:04:35] and humanitarian abilities
[1:04:37] so that summed up dad pretty good too
[1:04:40] so
[1:04:41] anyways
[1:04:43] i had just a couple of people on
[1:04:44] facebook i just was kind of reading
[1:04:46] through those and thought you know it
[1:04:47] was for people
[1:04:48] i'm guilty for uh not taking time and i
[1:04:51] probably should have over the years
[1:04:53] apologize in advance and for what i
[1:04:55] didn't do in the past
[1:04:57] but brother tim pruitt
[1:04:59] he made some comments and he said i will
[1:05:01] always treasure the times that i have
[1:05:03] spent in the home of brother dons and
[1:05:04] sister lou when i was ministering at
[1:05:07] true word tabernacle
[1:05:08] sister lou was a wonderful hostess may
[1:05:10] god give strength and courage for this
[1:05:13] part of life's journey so
[1:05:15] yeah mom and dad they they had quite a
[1:05:17] few
[1:05:18] different ministers in their house and
[1:05:20] their wives and you know mom
[1:05:22] she treated everybody the same pretty
[1:05:24] much
[1:05:25] then uh i don't know if i should
[1:05:27] change the names to protect the innocent
[1:05:29] here but
[1:05:30] um sister tammy i guess i'll call her
[1:05:33] douglas because that's how we met her
[1:05:34] but she's married now it's tammy mills
[1:05:37] john's so sorry for your loss your mom
[1:05:39] was a unique and special lady
[1:05:41] um and i responded to her like you don't
[1:05:43] know the half of that unique
[1:05:46] and then my sister and i were
[1:05:47] remembering my sister and i were
[1:05:49] remembering how kind and friendly she
[1:05:50] always was to the teens
[1:05:52] and she was i know
[1:05:54] thinking back we had uh when we lived on
[1:05:56] mills road our landlord built a pretty
[1:05:58] good sized barn and of course dad ended
[1:06:00] up taking over about half of it and we
[1:06:02] took up the other half but we had lots
[1:06:04] of lots of young people
[1:06:06] over the years and
[1:06:07] she really weren't
[1:06:08] you know she didn't like to have her
[1:06:10] house messed up that was a no-no but
[1:06:13] she may have grumbled and everybody left
[1:06:14] but she let us
[1:06:15] she let us have our friends over and i
[1:06:17] remember hatfields and davises and andes
[1:06:20] and
[1:06:21] pretty much anybody wanting to play
[1:06:22] football on saturdays you know
[1:06:25] they were there at the house afterwards
[1:06:27] then uh another family friend sulein
[1:06:30] shepherd
[1:06:31] uh i will always cherish the quilt your
[1:06:33] mom made for me she is a special lady
[1:06:35] and i love her and yeah the whole quilt
[1:06:36] thing i
[1:06:38] took it for granted growing up our house
[1:06:40] was full of quilts
[1:06:42] and there's i'm not gonna ask for people
[1:06:44] to raise their hands i don't i know they
[1:06:45] kind of become a hot commodity up here
[1:06:46] at one point but
[1:06:48] there was a lot of quilts out there and
[1:06:50] wall hangings and stuff
[1:06:52] so and then another sister i can never
[1:06:54] forget her big smile sister kelly coley
[1:06:57] and then a couple of my daughters i had
[1:06:59] i can't can't say uh do this without
[1:07:02] saying this sister sharon mcgrady this
[1:07:04] is on my daughter melissa i'm sorry for
[1:07:07] your loss you sure what looked like her
