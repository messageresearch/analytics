[0:21] because
[0:23] it's an image and
[0:26] but this is christ this is a depiction a
[0:28] realization this is a sign in the sky of
[0:32] the headship the the christ the headship
[0:35] coming down to unite with his bride this
[0:37] is the sign that god chose to throw in
[0:39] the sky and that sign the prophet would
[0:41] point to and show that this is the sign
[0:43] of the capstone the headship coming to
[0:45] unite with the body how can you recoil
[0:48] at that picture how can you have any
[0:50] reservation against that picture when
[0:52] god chose that sign to show what day and
[0:55] age that we live
[0:58] it's not something we should be ashamed
[1:00] of it's not something that we should
[1:01] recoil from amen

[1:05] not something to avoid this is one of
[1:07] the greatest things that's ever happened
[1:08] in the humanity of mankind amen and god

[1:16] that it was god who displayed it himself
[1:18] it was god who had him collect i don't
[1:20] remember how many dozens and dozens of
[1:22] photographs it was god who had them put
[1:24] it in life magazine amen none of us had
[1:27] it put in life magazine god had it put
[1:29] in light magazine
[1:31] and god had life magazine distributed
[1:34] all over the world amen why would god do
[1:36] that if he didn't want us to hang that
[1:38] picture up and look at that picture and
[1:40] talk about that picture
[1:42] [Music]
[1:44] he's the one who hung in the sky he's
[1:46] the one who had him take a picture he's
[1:48] the one who had a scientist from the
[1:50] university of arizona who happened to be
[1:52] a meteorologist look at it and say that
[1:55] that cloud is impossible
[1:58] you know what he didn't have to be
[1:59] looking up that day he didn't even have
[2:01] to be in arizona he didn't even have to
[2:03] be a meteorologist but god put him there
[2:06] to point to that and say that's not
[2:08] possible
[2:13] at some point
[2:15] you're not doubting man at some point
[2:17] you're doubting god
