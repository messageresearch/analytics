[0:00] And Jesus
[0:03] hold my hand.
[0:05] I need
[0:07] thee every hour.
[0:10] And through

[0:44] There is a friend who walks with me.
[0:49] He leads me safely through the sinking
[0:53] sand. It is the Christ of Calary.
[0:58] And this would be my prayer, dear Lord,
[1:02] each day to help me do the best I can.
[1:08] For I need thy light to guide me day and

[3:47] When I kneel, when I kneel in prayer, I
[3:51] know I'll meet you there. Blessed Jesus,
[3:55] hold my hand.
[3:59] Alas, and did my Savior bleed? And did
[4:05] my sovereign die?
[4:09] Would he devote that sacred head for
[4:15] such a worm as I?
[4:20] At the cross at the cross where I first
[4:23] saw the light and the burdens of my
[4:27] heart rolled away.
[4:30] It was there by faith I received my son.
[4:36] And now I am happy all the day.
[4:41] Was it for crimes that I have done? He
[4:47] groaned upon the tree.
[4:52] Amazing
[4:53] pity, grace unknown, and love beyond
[4:59] decree.
[5:02] Oh, at the cross, at the cross, where I
[5:05] first saw the light and the burdens of
[5:09] my heart rolled away.
[5:12] It was there by faith I received my
[5:17] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[5:23] But drops of grief can never repay the
[5:29] debt of love I hold.
[5:34] Here Lord I give myself
[5:38] away. It is all that I can do.
[5:43] [Music]
[5:44] At the cross, at the cross where I first
[5:48] saw the light and the burdens of my
[5:51] heart rolled away.
[5:55] It was there by faith I received my
[5:59] sight. And now I am happy all day.

[9:31] Well, I didn't realize it till I got
[9:33] here that they were going to sing that
[9:34] song. And I already had that song on my
[9:35] list to sing. So, let's just stand
[9:37] together and we'll sing it in English.
[9:39] Now, we've got the power
[9:44] in the name of Jesus.
[9:48] We've got the power
[9:52] in the name of the Lord.
[9:57] Although Satan rages,
[10:01] we cannot be defeated.
[10:05] We've got the power
[10:09] in the name of the Lord. Verse one,
[10:14] for many years now,
[10:18] Satan's tried to stop us.
[10:22] But the bride of Jesus,
[10:27] she's still alive.
[10:31] Like a mighty army,
[10:35] she keeps maring onward,
[10:39] winning every battle.
[10:44] for the Lord's on her side.
[10:48] We've got the power
[10:52] in the name of Jesus.
[10:56] We've got the power
[11:01] in the name of the Lord.
[11:05] Though Satan rages,

[11:22] and give me your hand.
[11:26] Let's agree together
[11:30] that all of our eneies
[11:34] will crumble at our feet.
[11:39] Whatever we bind on earth shall be bound
[11:45] in heaven
[11:48] in the name of Jesus.
[11:52] Satan will have to flee.
[11:56] We've got the power
[12:01] in the name of Jesus.
[12:05] We've got the power
[12:09] in the name of the Lord.
[12:14] Though Satan rages,

[12:52] we cannot be defeated.
[12:57] We've got the power
[13:01] in the name of the Lord.
[13:06] Well, it's not in trying,
[13:10] but in trusting.
[13:14] Not in running
[13:17] but in resting.
[13:20] [Music]
[13:21] Not in wondering
[13:24] but in pray
[13:28] that we find the strength of the Lord.
[13:35] It's not in trying
[13:38] but in trusting.
[13:42] It's not in running
[13:45] but in resting.

[17:21] mind.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's just bow our heads
[17:26] together and pray.
[17:29] Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus, for gathering
[17:32] us once again.
[17:34] And God, as we've come, Lord, to this
[17:36] service, we come with expectation, Lord,
[17:39] for your prophet told us that we get
[17:41] what we expect, Lord. God, we wanted to
[17:44] come and sing your praises with our
[17:46] brothers and sisters. We wanted to come,
[17:48] Lord, and rejoice in your goodness. We
[17:50] wanted to come and hear your word
[17:52] preached, Lord. We wanted to receive
[17:54] from you another portion for today. And
[17:57] God, we expect that, Lord. And and God,
[18:00] you've promised to feed us this way.
[18:02] You've promised to meet us this way. We
[18:04] come in obedience to your word. And now,
[18:06] Lord, we look to you to come and break
[18:07] the bread of life for us. To feed us as
[18:10] your hungry, waiting sheep, trusting in
[18:12] you, the great shepherd and bishop of
[18:14] our souls, that you'll feed us on the
[18:16] good food, Lord, that'll give us
[18:17] strength and give us life. Have your way
[18:20] with us, Lord. Speak the words you want
[18:22] us to hear. Give us ears to hear and a
[18:23] heart to receive. May we go out of here
[18:26] different than we came in strengthened,
[18:28] Lord, and edified with clear vision,
[18:30] Lord, knowing what it is you're trying
[18:32] to do in our lives. And may we yield to
[18:34] that purpose, Lord. May we yield and
[18:36] surrender to your word. And may your
[18:38] word have a place to work in us. We love
[18:41] you, God. We ask for these things as you
[18:43] take preeminence this evening. In Jesus
[18:46] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[18:49] Amen. God bless you this evening. It's
[18:51] certainly good to be here. Amen. It was
[18:54] good to hear from brother Michael. God
[18:55] bless you. It's good to have you and
[18:57] your wife and your son here with us. He
[18:59] called me a few days ago and let me know
[19:01] that he was going to be coming through.
[19:03] And uh and so it's a real privilege for
[19:05] us to have him visiting with us. He's
[19:07] about as far south as you can possibly
[19:09] go in Texas. Brownsville, way down
[19:11] there. And actually they attend a church
[19:13] in Mexico. They cross the border to go
[19:14] to church and and so it was nice. It was
[19:17] good to hear a song in Spanish, wasn't
[19:18] it? Amen. That's special for us. Amen.
[19:21] So, God bless you all. I was amazed when
[19:24] I told Blake that they were going to
[19:25] have a song and what it was. He goes,
[19:26] "Huh, I already have that on my notes to
[19:28] sing tonight." So, that was an ordained
[19:30] song for tonight. Amen. It was in the
[19:32] mind of God. So, we appreciate having
[19:34] them here. Uh and uh like he said, he's
[19:37] been in Canton for a while, but they're
[19:39] coming back, staying here tonight, and
[19:40] then heading towards home. So, just be
[19:43] praying for them. Amen. We also have
[19:46] another visitor with us, uh Brother
[19:48] Nathaniel from Germany. God bless you.
[19:50] He's back here, this young man here.
[19:52] He's actually going to be here for 6
[19:53] months. He's doing an internship at New
[19:55] Life Scientific. And so, God bless you.
[19:58] Welcome. It's good to have you, but
[19:59] we're going to have a chance to get to
[20:00] know you. So, you're not you're kind of
[20:02] a visitor, but not really a visitor.
[20:04] You're a long-term visitor. Amen. So,
[20:06] his family attends Brother Good Roads,
[20:08] which we certainly know brother Gird
[20:09] really well. And and so, we're happy to
[20:12] have him here with us as well. Man, want
[20:15] to remind you of the wedding coming up
[20:16] this Saturday. keeping in prayer for
[20:18] brother Wesley and sister Anne's
[20:19] wedding. We're excited to see them
[20:21] married and we'll be there. But while
[20:23] we're there, brother Danny Delmundo will
[20:25] be here preaching. So, if you just want
[20:27] to remember him in prayer and and uh
[20:29] we're always excited to have him come
[20:31] by. Uh also this Sunday, our two of our
[20:34] brothers will be traveling out. Brother
[20:36] Jim Swanson will be ministering over at
[20:38] Bible Believers. Uh so remember him in
[20:40] prayer and brother Gabe Smith is going
[20:41] to be traveling down to Logan to
[20:43] minister for brother Jeff Snodgrass. So
[20:45] remember those brothers as well. So it
[20:48] seems to be the way it goes. Sometimes
[20:49] they just they scatter through the
[20:51] winds. But hey, God is good and we we
[20:53] love the Lord. Amen. While we're
[20:55] standing, if you'll take your Bibles and
[20:56] turn with me to Romans, we'll go to
[20:58] Romans chapter 13. Also wanted to let
[21:01] you know that brother Levi Bish sent
[21:03] over a a handful of pendants, little
[21:06] pendants that he had made of the
[21:07] supernatural cloud and he wanted to
[21:09] share them here with the church. So
[21:10] they're out on the welcome desk for
[21:12] anybody who would want one. And we know
[21:14] that he's made the tie tacks for years.
[21:16] A lot of the brothers got the little tie
[21:18] tacks that brother Levi Bishes had made
[21:21] and and so we've enjoyed those. And so
[21:24] the pendants are out there. If you'd
[21:25] like to have one of them, you're welcome
[21:27] to it. And we certainly appreciate him
[21:29] for thinking of us. Amen. It's always
[21:31] been very nice. Amen. Romans 13
[21:36] and 11.
[21:38] Romans 13:11.
[21:42] and that knowing the time that now it is
[21:44] high time to awake out of sleep. For now
[21:47] is our salvation nearer than when we
[21:50] believed. The night is far spent, the
[21:52] day is at hand. Let us therefore cast
[21:54] off the works of darkness and let us put
[21:57] on the armor of light. Amen. God bless
[22:00] you as you take your seats. Amen. We
[22:02] just ask God's blessing uh over the
[22:04] word. We've been for quite some time
[22:07] talking about uh the message from pick
[22:10] up your pen and write. We still got my
[22:12] little booklet in my hand. If you
[22:14] brought it, uh we're not going to go
[22:15] through it like we have been. We
[22:16] finished going through it, but but we
[22:18] will um uh just refer to one section out
[22:21] of it. There was something that came up
[22:23] in spoken words, the original seed,
[22:24] which is the message Brother Brandham
[22:26] was preaching when he got this message
[22:28] from the Holy Spirit that told him to
[22:30] pick up his pen and write. And he shared
[22:32] it uh first in that message. And then,
[22:35] you know, we printed these little
[22:36] booklets and you're welcome to it.
[22:37] Brother Michael, if you guys didn't get
[22:39] one, we've got them in the back there.
[22:40] grab them before you go. It's an excerpt
[22:42] out of uh uh the church age book where
[22:45] he once again uh puts down in the church
[22:48] age book what the what was written there
[22:50] when the angel or when the Holy Spirit
[22:52] told him to pick up his pen and write.
[22:54] And so uh if we could pull up the
[22:56] PowerPoint, Brother Franco, I want to
[22:58] take just out of there the former and
[23:00] latter reign because this came up in
[23:02] spoken orders the original seed. It came
[23:04] up in a quote here and I just want to
[23:06] spend some time talking about it while
[23:08] we're on it. Amen. And I never dreamed
[23:09] we'd be this long in spoken word as the
[23:11] original seed and and big but I'm
[23:14] absolutely loving it. It's a thrill.
[23:16] Sunday was such an exciting thrill to my
[23:18] heart and I appreciate the pull on the
[23:20] word and Amen. When I'm telling you the
[23:23] harder you pull, the more I love what
[23:25] I'm doing. I I have a good time here.
[23:27] Amen. And so just receive the word of
[23:30] God. Amen. Just reach out and grab it
[23:32] and take it. Amen. And the harder you
[23:33] take it and the faster you take it, the
[23:35] more fun I start having. Amen. because
[23:37] then I start learning things while I'm
[23:39] preaching and I like that. That's always
[23:40] the best. Uh so we want to look at
[23:43] former former and latter reign. This is
[23:46] the this is the quote where he mentions
[23:48] it there out of the Peramian church age.
[23:50] Now I want you to be very careful here
[23:52] and see this. God has promised that at
[23:55] the end time Malachi 4 is going to be
[23:57] fulfilled. It has to be for it is a
[23:59] spiritquickened word of God spoken by
[24:02] the prophet Malachi. Jesus referred to
[24:04] it. It is just before Christ comes the
[24:07] second time. By the time Jesus comes,
[24:09] all scripture must be fulfilled. The
[24:11] gentile dispensation will be in its last
[24:13] church age. When this when that
[24:15] messenger of Malachi comes, he will be
[24:17] right with the word. He will take the
[24:20] whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation.
[24:22] He will start at the serpent seed and
[24:24] carry on to the messenger in the latter
[24:26] reign. But he will be rejected by the
[24:29] denominations. So this prophet this this
[24:32] uh fulfillment of Malachi 4 we know is
[24:34] brother Brandham and we know he's a
[24:37] prophet of the age and revelation the
[24:38] fulfillment of revelations 10:7 but he
[24:41] is going to take the whole Bible amen
[24:43] from Genesis to Revelations and he did.
[24:45] Amen.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; And he's going to start with serpent
[24:48] seed and go all the way to the messenger
[24:50] in the latter rain. Amen. So we know
[24:52] that this latter rain has something to
[24:54] do with his ministry because he's the
[24:55] messenger and he's going to carry on to
[24:57] the messenger in the latter rain. So we
[24:59] want to talk about that uh here in uh
[25:02] 1960 uh in this message condemnation by
[25:05] representation. He says and we believe
[25:08] that there is to be a church in the last
[25:10] days that will receive both former and
[25:12] latter reign.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; It'll be scattered throughout the world
[25:15] in this leodyian age. It'll be a church
[25:18] that's called back to the original faith
[25:20] in God. It'll be a church that'll have
[25:22] Jesus Christ walking in it, manifesting
[25:24] himself. The shadow of the king will be
[25:26] in it. Amen. And I don't like to say
[25:29] will, I say is. Amen. The shout of the
[25:31] king is in the in the camp because we've
[25:34] received this. Amen.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we see here again there's
[25:39] going to be a former and a latter reign.
[25:42] Now, uh I'm going to bring I'm going to
[25:44] I'm going to look at quite a few quotes
[25:46] out of spoken word as the original seed.
[25:48] And we've been talking about this
[25:49] message for now for the last few weeks,
[25:52] how it was a pivotal message in brother
[25:53] Bam's message. He comes to this time in
[25:55] 1962 and he knows God's done with the
[25:58] churches. He knows the revival fires are
[26:00] burning down. Everything's slowed down.
[26:02] It's come to a law. His ministry has
[26:04] slowed down and he knows there's
[26:05] something else going to happen. And he's
[26:07] in this in between time and he's trying
[26:09] to sort it all out. And he's going into
[26:11] that and spoken word is the original
[26:13] seed. And he's trying to show us, amen,
[26:15] that the original seed is the spoken
[26:18] word of God. And when you come back to
[26:20] the original, it will reproduce itself.
[26:22] Amen. It'll reproduce exactly what it
[26:24] was intended to produce. So whatever
[26:26] produced the first church, Amen. at the
[26:28] end if we come back to the original
[26:30] word, it'll be just like the church was
[26:32] when it was fresh from Pentecost. And so
[26:35] that's what he's teaching us in this
[26:36] message, spoken word, the original seed.
[26:39] But before this time, brother Ben, if
[26:42] you go all the way back, you can start
[26:44] all the way back in the early 50s.
[26:46] Brother Benham starts saying, "And the l
[26:48] and this is the latter rain. This is the
[26:50] latter rain." And he like everybody else
[26:52] is referring to the Pentecostal revival
[26:54] and the outpouring of the spirit and the
[26:56] gifts that had been restored and even in
[26:58] his ministry and the supernatural and
[27:00] brother Bham saying this is the latter
[27:02] rain and and and so but then he starts
[27:04] changing and you get into 57 58 59 he
[27:08] starts realizing there's got to be a
[27:10] former reign. So then he starts saying
[27:11] now the former rain's got to come into
[27:13] this latter reign but then when he comes
[27:16] to spoken word as the original seed into
[27:17] the seals and beyond he completely
[27:19] changes. Amen. He realizes that wasn't
[27:22] the that wasn't the latter rain cuz you
[27:24] can't have the latter rain till you have
[27:25] the former rain.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; And he starts teaching it. So I want us
[27:28] to understand that cuz when you go back
[27:29] in the message, you may hear those
[27:31] things. But brother Brennham himself is
[27:33] realizing the reality and the gravity of
[27:35] the scriptures and the position he's in
[27:37] as God's unfolding it to him as he's
[27:39] moving into his ministry.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; And he comes to spoken word the original
[27:44] seed and he starts to lay it out. He
[27:46] says,"Now we are hearing so much in so
[27:49] many organizations and everything else
[27:51] talking about we're in the latter rain."
[27:54] Nonsense. No such thing now.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; That's pretty clear.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; But before he said, "This is the latter
[28:02] rain." But now he's going to now be
[28:04] because God has revealed this to him and
[28:06] showed him where he's at in the ministry
[28:08] and what's coming. He realizes we're not
[28:10] in the latter rain. No such thing now.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and this is what he says in
[28:15] the church age book. This age started
[28:18] just after the turn of the 20th century
[28:20] as it was to be the age in which the
[28:22] true church would return to being the
[28:24] bride she was at Pentecost. We know that
[28:26] there must have necessity be a return of
[28:28] dynamic power. The believers sensed this
[28:31] and in their spirits and began crying to
[28:34] God for a new outpouring such as was in
[28:36] the first century. What seemed to be the
[28:39] answer came as many began to speak in
[28:41] tongues and manifest gifts of the
[28:43] spirit. It was then believed that this
[28:45] was indeed the long awaited restoration.
[28:49] It was not for the latter rain can come
[28:53] only after the former rain which is the
[28:55] spring or teaching rain. So I'm going to
[28:58] back up. You know me, I don't like to
[28:59] move too fast. I like to go slow. So,
[29:02] uh, so I backed it up here because it
[29:04] says what seemed to be the answer when
[29:06] the Isuza Street revival broke out and
[29:08] the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the the
[29:10] the baptism of the Holy Ghost came back
[29:12] with the gifts of the spirit, it seemed
[29:14] like the restoration. It seemed like
[29:16] going right back to what the church was
[29:17] at Pentecost, but he said it wasn't.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; It only looked like it, but it wasn't.
[29:23] This was indeed the long awaited
[29:24] restoration. So, I want us to to look at
[29:27] this the long awaited restoration
[29:30] because there's got to come a
[29:31] restoration that the that the true
[29:34] church would return to being the bride
[29:36] that she was at Pentecost. That's what
[29:37] the restoration is going to do. Bring
[29:39] her back to what she was when she was a
[29:41] virgin bride, fresh from the hands of
[29:43] God.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; At Pentecost. And they thought that the
[29:46] the Zuza Street revival, the the the
[29:49] Pentecostal revival was the long awaited
[29:51] restoration, but it wasn't. But look
[29:53] what he says next.
[29:55] The latter rain can only come after the
[29:58] former rain.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; So he's attaching the latter rain to the
[30:01] restoration.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; You see that? We're going to see that as
[30:05] we go. Which is the spring or teaching
[30:07] rain. The latter rain then is the
[30:09] harvest rain.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; So we have a teaching rain and a harvest
[30:13] rain. Amen. And so how could this be the
[30:16] real thing when the teaching reign had
[30:18] not come? The prophet messenger who was
[30:21] sent to teach the people and turn the
[30:23] hearts of the children back to the
[30:24] Pentecostal fathers had not yet come.
[30:27] Thus, what was thought to be the
[30:29] restoration and final quickening at the
[30:30] rapture had not come. And now, brother
[30:33] Benham, when he when he's in in resume
[30:35] of the ages in the church age book, he
[30:36] now can place everything. He now
[30:39] understands. And now he says now it
[30:41] looked like it was a restoration, but it
[30:42] can't. How can the latter rain, which is
[30:44] the restoring rain, how can the latter
[30:46] rain come till the teaching reign came?
[30:48] How can you teaching reign come without
[30:50] the prophet messenger who was sent to
[30:51] teach the people and turn their hearts
[30:53] back?
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; So the teaching reign has to come before
[30:56] the latter rain. This is the scripture
[30:59] that this is coming from where brother's
[31:01] referring to Joel chapter 2 verse 23
[31:05] says be glad then ye children of Zion
[31:07] and rejoice in the Lord your God. For he
[31:09] hath given you the former rain
[31:10] moderately, and he will cause to come
[31:13] down for you the rain, the former rain,
[31:16] and the latter rain in the first month.
[31:18] I want you to see this
[31:21] is going to refer back to this, but he's
[31:23] going to use different terminology.
[31:25] You're going to bring the former rain
[31:26] and the latter rain in the first month.
[31:29] And the floor shall be full of wheat,
[31:31] and the fat shall overflow with wine and
[31:33] oil. And I will restore to you the years
[31:36] that the locust hath eaten, the
[31:37] cankerorm, and the caterpillar and the
[31:40] palmer, my great army, which I sent
[31:42] among you, and ye shall eat in plenty,
[31:44] and be satisfied, and praise the name of
[31:46] the Lord your God, that hath dealt
[31:48] wondrously with you, and my people shall
[31:51] never be ashamed.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; We live in the day of the fulfillment of
[31:54] this prophecy. Amen. He told us that
[31:56] he's going to restore all that was
[31:58] destroyed by an antichrist spirit when
[32:00] it ate down the church. Amen. the bride
[32:03] tree as it was destroyed through these
[32:04] four stages. But he's got a promise of
[32:07] restoration here in Joel chapter 2.
[32:10] Amen. But part of that restoration is a
[32:12] former reign and a latter reign. And in
[32:15] the former and latter reign, he's going
[32:16] to bring a restoration back to all that
[32:20] these insects, the insects of the
[32:21] antichrist have eaten down to the church
[32:24] and bring the church back.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:28] And when he does,
[32:30] ye shall eat in plenty.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Are you eating good?
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we went through the drought
[32:38] of the dry the dryness of the church
[32:40] age. We went through the starvation.
[32:42] Amos said, "Amen. There'll be a drought
[32:44] in the land. Not for food and water.
[32:47] Amen. A famine, but for hearing the word
[32:49] of God, because the word of God had
[32:51] gotten lost. Amen. Had been destroyed
[32:53] through the dark ages. But now under the
[32:54] former latter rain, he's going to
[32:56] restore all that the caterpillar, all
[32:58] that the canker worm, all the locust,
[33:00] all everything that they destroyed is
[33:03] coming back. Amen.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; And you shall eat in plenty and be
[33:06] satisfied. And praise the name of the
[33:08] Lord your God that had dealt wondrously
[33:10] with you. Can you say, "God has dealt
[33:12] wondrously with me." Isn't it doesn't
[33:14] matter what our trials are, the
[33:16] hardships that we face. That's part of
[33:18] the perfection of the bride. That's what
[33:20] God has to do in our lives because God
[33:22] has so swn the word back into us and
[33:25] he's poured out his spirit upon that
[33:26] word to manifest the word. How are you
[33:28] going to manifest that word in an
[33:30] atmosphere of perfection? Every trial,
[33:32] every hardship is only an obstacle that
[33:34] God wants the word inside of you to
[33:36] conquer and overcome and prove that
[33:38] there's been a restoration in this age.
[33:41] That's
[33:41] &gt;&gt; right.
[33:43] Man, we're not looking for easy living.
[33:44] And we're we're looking for the word
[33:46] that has come back to positionally place
[33:48] us and bring us back into our right
[33:50] mind, the correct understanding of who
[33:52] we are with the anointing, the power of
[33:54] God, the Holy Ghost poured out in the
[33:56] bride to make that word live.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; And so I say, God has dealt wondrously
[34:03] with me.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; And we should have nothing to be ashamed
[34:07] about.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[34:11] So when we look at the former rain and
[34:13] latter reign, we're going to look at
[34:16] these definitions.
[34:18] If we pull up this word is for the
[34:21] former reign mo it means teacher and
[34:25] brother uses it as teaching rain.
[34:28] And then when you look up latter rain,
[34:30] this word latter rain means the latter
[34:32] rain, spring rain, the March or April
[34:34] rains which mature the crops of
[34:36] Palestine. But you see where I've got
[34:39] that 3 3953 number in blue because in
[34:43] the concordance it says this word comes
[34:45] from that word. This is the root of the
[34:47] other word. So when we pull up that root
[34:49] word, it means to glean, to gather, to
[34:53] take the aftermate, to take everything.
[34:55] That means that's that's where this word
[34:57] latter rain comes out of the word to
[34:59] glean or to gather. That's why brother
[35:01] Brandham said it's the harvest rain is
[35:03] the gleaning or gathering rain.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; All right. on the same page. Then now in
[35:09] resume again he says now it says God is
[35:11] going to restore. The Lutheran age did
[35:15] not restore the church. It started a
[35:16] reformation. The Wesley age did not
[35:19] restore. The Pentecostal age did not
[35:20] restore. But God has to restore for he
[35:23] cannot deny his word. This is not the
[35:26] resurrection of the church. It is the
[35:28] restoration. God will take the church
[35:30] right back to Pentecost of the
[35:32] beginning. Now notice in verse 25 it
[35:34] tells why we need restoration. The
[35:37] locust, cankerworm, caterpillar and
[35:39] palmer have eaten all but the root and
[35:41] small bit of the stem.
[35:45] Now we are told that these insects are
[35:47] all one and the same in different
[35:50] stages. That's right. They are the
[35:52] antichrist spirit manifested in
[35:54] organization, denomination, and false
[35:56] doctrine through the ages. And that poor
[35:59] little root and stalk is going to be
[36:01] restored. God isn't going to plant a new
[36:04] church, but he's going to bring his
[36:05] original planting back to original seed.
[36:08] Remember, spoken word is the original
[36:10] seed. If it comes back to the original
[36:12] word, it'll produce the same original
[36:14] life.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; His original planting back to original
[36:18] seed. He is doing it as stated in verse
[36:20] 23, by the teaching or former rain. Next
[36:23] will come the harvest rain or
[36:27] what did he say?
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Rapturing faith.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; I I'm highlighting this really nice and
[36:34] thick because I don't want to forget
[36:36] this because there's sometimes brother
[36:38] Ben says things and he ties things
[36:39] together that all of a sudden blow your
[36:41] mind and it comes up later and you start
[36:43] to understand what he's telling us that
[36:45] he calls this latter rain is the harvest
[36:47] rain or rapturing faith.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:53] So, let's keep going. Don't forget that.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; We're going to remember it now.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; The latter rain is the harvest rain or
[36:59] rapturing faith.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. Spoken word is the original seed.
[37:04] We're back now to this message. Someone
[37:06] asked me to repeat that Hebrew word
[37:08] again in Joel the 2 chapter, Joel 2:28,
[37:10] where he speaks of the coming of the
[37:12] former and latter rain. The former is
[37:14] the Hebrew word mo, which means
[37:16] teaching. In other words, it'll be a
[37:18] teaching rain and a harvest rain. Now
[37:21] we've had the teaching rain and we're
[37:23] ready now for the harvest rain. You know
[37:25] the first rain is when you plant the
[37:27] seed that starts your crop growing. Then
[37:29] just before it matures, there comes
[37:31] another crop. That's what they call the
[37:33] harvest rain. We know when it is the
[37:35] spring rains and then the rains about
[37:36] June. It makes your crop. Now the rain
[37:38] we find out was the spirit. So what's
[37:41] the former rain and the latter rain?
[37:43] It's an outpouring of the spirit.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; It's an outpouring of the spirit of God.
[37:47] Amen. So that the seed that's been
[37:49] planted will grow. It needs the water.
[37:51] It needs the moisture. It needs the
[37:53] spirit to grow.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so he begins teaching us now
[38:00] that the the teaching rain. And and and
[38:02] I love how he says we've had the
[38:04] teaching reign right here. Let me go
[38:07] back here. Uh let me find it. We've had
[38:12] the I turned it off.
[38:16] We I am messing everything up.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; We've had the teaching rain.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; We're ready now for the harvest rain.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; But look at when he says this.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; That is so important because we know
[38:34] when he comes to this message, he
[38:35] realizes something's happened, but
[38:38] something's going to happen. He realized
[38:40] something's changing in his ministry. He
[38:42] realized 1962 is this year of change
[38:44] because he comes and preaches spoken
[38:46] word is the original seed. And he says
[38:47] the revival fires are dying down.
[38:49] They're not burning up the country like
[38:51] they used to. My meetings are the worst
[38:53] of all of them. What has caused all of
[38:55] this? He said because there's been a
[38:56] seed planted now we've got to wait and
[38:58] see what comes forth from the planting.
[39:01] And now he's come and tells us at this
[39:03] stage. Amen. He's come through he's come
[39:05] through his his first and second pull.
[39:08] He's come through the revival meetings
[39:09] that have gone all over the world. Amen.
[39:12] Proving that Jesus Christ is the same
[39:13] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[39:15] With supernatural vindication and
[39:17] healings and miracles. And now he comes
[39:19] to the church ages. And he and he starts
[39:21] tying together all the loose ends and
[39:23] bringing back all the truth. He's
[39:25] teaching water baptism in Jesus' name.
[39:27] He's teaching the truth on Godhead. He's
[39:29] teaching all of these things, bringing
[39:30] us back to the original word. And he
[39:33] says, "We've had the teaching reign.
[39:36] We're ready now for the harvest rain.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; And now in 1962 in spoken word was the
[39:41] original seed. He's standing in between
[39:43] these two rains and said this rain is
[39:45] falling but there's another rain to
[39:47] come.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; This is so exciting friends because now
[39:52] we we're standing here amen in 2025 and
[39:55] we can we can say that the harvest rain
[39:57] has come. Amen. We're not standing in
[39:59] between these rains anymore. We're
[40:01] standing here the beneficiaries of the
[40:03] harvest rain that has already fallen.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; He says now here's been three different
[40:12] kinds of seeds planted. A denominational
[40:14] Billy Graham. He was the head planter.
[40:16] Oral Roberts for the Pentecostals.
[40:18] Pentecostal seed has been planted. I'm
[40:19] talking about organization now. Then the
[40:21] word has been planted. Now you'll have
[40:24] to understand folks. I ain't saying this
[40:26] no more unless God tells me. I want you
[40:28] to get this good and clear. Three seeds
[40:30] has been planted. That's the reason the
[40:33] planting it's about over. It's all over.
[40:36] Seeds must be planted before the rain
[40:38] falls.
[40:39] I believe that there is uh I believe
[40:42] that it's near the harvest time. The
[40:44] seeds has been planted. Denominational
[40:46] seeds of the churches such as the
[40:47] evangelicals, the Baptist, the
[40:49] Presbyterian, the Lutheran, and the
[40:51] Pentecostal seeds has been planted into
[40:53] the Pentecostal organization by great
[40:55] men like Oral Roberts, Tommy Hicks,
[40:56] Tommy Osborne, great men of God. See,
[40:59] and I believe that the word of God has
[41:01] been planted unadulterated away from any
[41:03] of these organizations.
[41:05] That's what's the matter. See, what's
[41:08] the matter? Why does he say that's
[41:09] what's the matter? Because the question
[41:12] in the beginning spoke over his original
[41:14] seed is why are the revival fires dying
[41:16] down? What is the revival? The revival
[41:18] was the former rain revival when the
[41:20] spirit was pouring out while the seed
[41:22] was being planted. And and you can type
[41:25] revival with rain. Y
[41:27] &gt;&gt; they're synonymous. And they saying,
[41:29] "Why has the revival fires died down?"
[41:31] He said, "That's what's the matter. The
[41:33] problem is the seeds been sown.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; The seeds been plant the seed plant must
[41:39] have seed water before it can grow. It
[41:41] must have water to fall before the seed
[41:43] that's been planted can grow."
[41:46] Now, listen carefully here. Now, the
[41:48] seed must be planted and then it must
[41:50] have water in order to grow. Now, you
[41:51] say, "Well, brother Brandham, I'm going
[41:53] to express your thought there.
[41:56] We've had the water. So be it. That's
[41:59] correct. You have had the water. What
[42:02] water? Rain.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Revival.
[42:06] You have had the water. You ever plant
[42:08] cabbage or anything or seeds or some
[42:10] other another like that? Usually they
[42:12] got a water there. Just pour a little on
[42:14] them. See? All right. But now wait, what
[42:16] did we have in the planting time? The
[42:19] former rain. That's where he's back
[42:21] showing. Yes, we've had revivals. Yes,
[42:23] we've had an outpouring of the spirit.
[42:25] Yes, we've had water, but it was during
[42:27] the planting time. Amen. Now, we've got
[42:29] to see what comes up. And now, when it
[42:32] comes up, there's got to be a harvest
[42:34] rain, something to bring it to full
[42:36] maturity.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Now, what's the matter now? She is now
[42:42] waiting for the latter rain. That's when
[42:44] she produces her fruits. Oh, praise God.
[42:47] That's when it brings it to full
[42:48] maturity. I hope you get her. Then the
[42:51] kind of seed you had planted in your
[42:53] field will be the kind of crop you will
[42:54] reap because the spoken word is the
[42:56] original seed.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; If the denominations wants more members,
[43:00] that's what they're going to get. That's
[43:02] what they have gotten. The Pentecostals
[43:04] wants more Pentecostals. That's what
[43:06] they're going to get. But the word is
[43:08] going to produce sons and daughters of
[43:10] God. Uh-huh. Right. That's coming, too.
[43:13] Watch. Look at that great latter rain
[43:15] supposeded to be done. How they would
[43:17] run over the wall, leap over, how they'd
[43:19] be an army coming. Oh my goodness.
[43:22] Sometimes like I know this is here. I
[43:25] put it here, but when I see it again, I
[43:27] get so excited because brother Bam said
[43:29] there'd be an army coming. That ties us
[43:31] right back to the dry bones in Ezekiel.
[43:33] Amen. This is going to be an army rising
[43:35] up again.
[43:38] He said, but what they're going to have
[43:40] the denomination is going to bring forth
[43:41] denomination. Pentecostal is going to
[43:43] bring forth Pentecostal, but the word of
[43:45] God is going to bring sons and daughters
[43:47] of God. Amen.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; So now watch, but there was now these
[43:52] all quotes I pulled out of spoken word's
[43:54] original seed. And if you watch the
[43:56] numbers, they're all right in together.
[43:57] I've just pulled pulled pulled little
[43:59] clips, little nuggets out of spoken
[44:01] word, the original seed. Now watch. But
[44:03] there was one which was the word. He was
[44:06] the word. And where did he stay? With
[44:08] the promised one, the elected one. The
[44:11] word stayed with the elected one. And
[44:12] the word of God will stay with the
[44:14] elected one, the royal seed of Abraham.
[44:16] by the promise. He's referring back to
[44:18] Genesis 18 on the plains of memory when
[44:21] God came down in flesh to meet Abraham
[44:24] to confirm the promise to him. And he
[44:26] says, "One which was the word. He was
[44:28] the word. Where did he stay? With the
[44:30] promised one, with the elect."
[44:33] How many came down? There was three of
[44:35] them that came down. Two angels and God
[44:38] himself in flesh. Amen. And one stayed
[44:41] with the elect group, which was the
[44:42] word. And the other two went down to
[44:45] preach. Amen. And brother Bram said
[44:47] preaching the gospel is the blinding
[44:48] light. He went down to blind those in
[44:50] Sodom.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; And he said that was Oral Roberts and
[44:53] Billy Graham. He's still preaching the
[44:55] same thing. He's telling us the same
[44:56] story. But there was one. It was God who
[44:59] had come in a vessel of flesh. And in
[45:01] the plains of memory, he had come to the
[45:03] elect, those who had received the
[45:05] promise. And he came at the time to
[45:07] confirm the promise.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; And the word of God today will stay with
[45:14] the elected one. the royal seed of
[45:16] Abraham by the promise. What kind of
[45:18] works did it do when it was manifested
[45:20] about 800 years later in the form of
[45:23] Jesus Christ? It done the same works.
[45:25] What he say? What works did this what
[45:27] works was just Jehovah Elohim doing in
[45:30] flesh? Amen. When he turned his back to
[45:32] the tent and discern the thoughts of
[45:33] Sarah behind him, he says, listen, I I
[45:36] love this. I I want you to catch this
[45:38] right here.
[45:41] When it was manifest 800 years later in
[45:43] the form of Jesus Christ, it done the
[45:46] same works that that one did there.
[45:48] Amen. That the word did at the gate at
[45:51] Abraham's tent. Set with his back turned
[45:53] to the tent. Today Abraham, his name was
[45:56] Abraham, not Abram. What it always had
[45:59] been what his name he say he's showing
[46:01] us he's working the sign of the Messiah
[46:04] before the Messiah came. Amen. Amen.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; And then the Messiah came as Jesus
[46:10] Christ and did the same thing that had
[46:12] happened to Abraham on the plains of
[46:13] memory. He could discern their thoughts.
[46:15] Amen. But then he would come again at
[46:18] the end of the gentile dispensations in
[46:20] the church ages and he would come into a
[46:21] man of flesh into a prophet of the age.
[46:23] And he would do the same thing in so
[46:25] much that he would turn his back to a
[46:27] crowd of thousands of people and start
[46:29] calling people out so that we would see
[46:31] this is the same life, the same God, the
[46:34] same word that was back confirming the
[46:36] promise to Abraham is confirming the
[46:38] promise to the seed of Abraham.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[46:44] &gt;&gt; praise be to God.
[46:47] But his name was Abraham cuz God met him
[46:50] a few days before that and told him his
[46:52] name was Abra. What's he doing? He knows
[46:54] his name change. He knows who his is.
[46:56] He's giving a proper identification.
[46:59] Said, "Where is thy wife?" Not s a r a
[47:03] but s a r a h. Sarah. Where is thy wife
[47:06] Sarah? Like he didn't know. Said she's
[47:09] in the tent behind you. He said, "I'm
[47:11] going to visit you. I the personal
[47:13] prana. I'm going to visit you according
[47:15] to the time of life." Oh, and you're
[47:17] going to have that baby that you waited
[47:19] on. The latter rain is fix. Whoa. Oh.
[47:23] Oh.
[47:25] The latter rain is fixing the fall.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Where? On the plains of memory in
[47:30] Genesis 18 when he comes in the flesh to
[47:33] confirm the promise and shows the sign
[47:35] of the Messiah and comes to the elect
[47:37] seed at the right time. He says, "Now
[47:40] the harvest rain is fixing the fall.
[47:42] That's why I've come this way to you,
[47:45] Abraham. I'm bringing this seed word
[47:47] that you've held in your heart to full
[47:49] harvest maturity." Amen.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; The latter rain is fixing to fall.
[47:53] You've held that seat in there long
[47:54] enough. Now I'm believing and you're
[47:56] looking for a coming son and he's
[47:58] coming.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; That's the real church today. See that
[48:05] elected seed.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; You've been looking for him and I'm
[48:10] going to send him to you. Amen. What
[48:12] said that? The word.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we've come right back.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Same thing. Amen.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; I love how Brother Bam does this.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; He's not doing it. It's God doing it
[48:25] through him. The man can't do this.
[48:27] Here's a man. He Listen, this is 1962.
[48:30] This is March of 1962. He doesn't know
[48:34] what's going to happen next. We're
[48:36] standing here looking. We're looking
[48:37] backwards at everything that happened
[48:39] after this and said, "Oh man, that was
[48:40] so perfect. That was so good. He laid
[48:42] that right down just in the right time."
[48:44] But there was no way for him to know
[48:46] what was God's going to start doing at
[48:47] the end of the year when he brought six
[48:49] different people to him with dreams. And
[48:51] all the dreams were about his ministry
[48:53] changing and him going out west and
[48:54] capped off by the expansion of his road
[48:57] and the vision that he had had of his
[48:59] gate being uh torn to pieces and the and
[49:01] the commission of God to go west for
[49:03] this and now knowing that he's going
[49:05] west.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; For what?
[49:08] &gt;&gt; For the interpretation of the seven
[49:10] thunders. Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't know it when he sang this. He
[49:14] didn't know what God was going to do and
[49:15] he didn't know what was going to come
[49:16] next. So remarkable, friends.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; We're such a privileged people.
[49:24] He goes on, he says, "This has been
[49:26] about 6 hours. A spoken word, the
[49:28] original seed." He preached it for 6
[49:29] hours.
[49:31] They had a break for lunch.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Don't be nervous.
[49:36] They got a lunch break, but it was six
[49:38] hours with a lunch break in the middle.
[49:40] This has been about 6 hours, right?
[49:42] Close to it. Five and a half, six hours.
[49:44] There is much more could be said, but
[49:46] surely the Holy Spirit by this time has
[49:48] sunk it so deep in you that you know
[49:49] what I'm talking about. We are at the
[49:51] end time. The seeds are sewed now. The
[49:54] latter rain is fixing to come forth.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; He knows that much.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; How, when, where, why, he just knows
[50:02] it's fixing to come forth.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Now, the next day, he preaches a
[50:07] message. Well, I'm not going to get to
[50:09] that yet. I'm going back here to
[50:11] Abraham.
[50:12] Is it okay?
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis 18.
[50:19] We've been through this so many times,
[50:20] but it doesn't matter. We're going
[50:21] through it again.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; This is this is these this is our life.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; This is our identification. This is what
[50:29] we're living through. Amen.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Genesis 18.
[50:40] I want you to catch this. How brother
[50:43] Ben Renham said, "The latter rain is
[50:46] fixing to fall."
[50:48] Now look at what he says in paragraph
[50:50] 308. Said, "I'm going to visit you. I,
[50:53] the personal prana, I'm going to visit
[50:55] you according to the time of life. and
[50:57] you're going to have that baby that you
[50:59] waited on. The latter rain is fixing to
[51:02] fall.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; You've held that seat in there long
[51:06] enough on believing and you're looking
[51:07] for the coming son and he's coming.
[51:10] And then he ties it to the church today
[51:12] looking for the coming of the Lord.
[51:18] But he says, "I'm coming to visit you."
[51:21] I the personal pronoun according to the
[51:24] time of life and you're going to have
[51:25] that baby you waited on the latter rain
[51:28] is fixing to fall
[51:30] when he comes in Genesis 18 let's let's
[51:33] look at verse 9 let's just pick it up in
[51:35] verse 9
[51:39] and they said unto him where is Sarah
[51:41] thy wife and he said behind behold in
[51:44] the tent and he said I will certainly
[51:47] return unto thee according to the time
[51:49] of life And lo, Sarah, thy wife shall
[51:52] have a son. And Sarah heard it in the
[51:54] tent door which was behind him. Now
[51:57] Abraham and Sarah were old and
[51:58] wellstricken in age, and it ceased to be
[52:00] with Sarah after the manner of women.
[52:03] Therefore Sarah laughed within herself,
[52:06] saying, After I am waxed old shall I
[52:08] have pleasure, my lord being old also.
[52:12] And the Lord said unto Abraham,
[52:13] Wherefore did Sarah laugh? Where did she
[52:16] laugh? The Bible said she laughed within
[52:18] herself.
[52:20] It wasn't even audible. She laughed
[52:22] within herself. And the Lord said unto
[52:24] Abraham, "Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
[52:26] saying shall I assurity bear a child
[52:27] which amold?" Is anything too hard for
[52:30] the Lord? At the time appointed, I will
[52:33] return unto thee according to the time
[52:34] of life, and Sarah Sarah shall have a
[52:37] son. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laugh
[52:40] not, for she was afraid. And he said,
[52:42] Nay, but thou did laugh.
[52:46] So here he promises Abraham, Abraham,
[52:50] I'm going to return unto thee according
[52:52] to the time of life and you shall have
[52:54] this child. So he promises this
[52:57] visitation and he promises this return.
[53:00] And and what he's going to do is he's
[53:02] going to turn them back
[53:05] to what? To their youth.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Just like he's going to take the church
[53:11] back to what she was when she came out
[53:13] of Pentecost. Right.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; She's going back to a virgin bride,
[53:18] fresh from the hands of God, washed by
[53:20] the water of the bleeding word, restored
[53:23] back to an unadulterated virgin
[53:25] condition, back to what she was. And
[53:27] what and she was meant to be in the
[53:29] beginning. Abraham and Sarah were turned
[53:32] back young, but God promised them a
[53:34] visitation. And if you look, God never
[53:37] comes to Abraham himself again. But the
[53:40] next visitation is in chapter 21. If you
[53:43] turn with me to chapter 21, the next
[53:45] time God visits, it says this in his
[53:48] visitation.
[53:50] And the Lord, chapter 21, verse one, and
[53:54] the Lord visited Sarah as he had said.
[53:58] When did he say he would visit Sarah?
[54:00] When he looked at Abraham and said, I'll
[54:02] visit thee according to the time of
[54:04] life. Because Sarah was part of Abraham
[54:06] and part of the promise and the
[54:08] fulfillment of the promise was going to
[54:10] come forth through her. Amen. And where
[54:12] is the promise? Amen. The promise is the
[54:14] Christ, but the bride of Jesus Christ is
[54:16] part of Christ. And the fulfillment of
[54:18] the promise is going to come through
[54:20] her.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; And the Lord visited Sarah. The Lord
[54:25] came to her. Why? Because it was the it
[54:28] was time for the latter rain to be
[54:30] poured out.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; As he had said, and the Lord did unto
[54:35] Sarah as he had spoken.
[54:37] Listen.
[54:39] And Sarah conceived. and bear Abraham a
[54:42] son in his old age at the set time of
[54:44] which God had spoken to him. There was
[54:47] something Sarah needed. She needed this
[54:50] visitation. She needed she needed a
[54:52] visitation of the Lord. She needed an
[54:55] outpouring of the spirit. She needed
[54:57] something to give her the ability to
[54:59] conceive. Remember at this point she's
[55:01] already been turned young again because
[55:03] in the chapter before and chapter 19 he
[55:06] goes down to Guerrar. And in Gerrar, the
[55:08] king of Beimilec, he wants this
[55:10] beautiful young woman. Amen. So it shows
[55:12] that she had already been turned young.
[55:14] But after she had been turned back by
[55:16] the by the word, she had been turned
[55:18] back to what she was, she still needed
[55:21] something. She needed
[55:23] &gt;&gt; a visitation.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; And in that visitation, she conceived.
[55:28] If you go with me to Hebrews 11, let's
[55:30] turn over there quickly. Hebrews chapter
[55:33] 11.
[55:34] Let's look at what this visitation
[55:37] did for her.
[55:41] Hebrews chapter 11.
[55:47] Hebrews 11
[55:50] and 11.
[55:52] Through faith also Sarah herself
[55:56] received strength to conceive seed and
[55:58] was delivered of a child when she was
[56:00] past age because she judged him faithful
[56:03] who had promised. Right.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; What gave her the faith to give her the
[56:09] strength to conceive seed? It was in the
[56:11] private visitation in Genesis 21.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; And that and that visitation gave her
[56:19] the faith and the faith gave her the
[56:21] strength to conceive seed because she
[56:22] knew his promise was true.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; I want to go back and look at a slide
[56:27] quickly.
[56:30] Let me see.
[56:34] Let me see if I can find it.
[56:39] Remember when I told you to remember
[56:41] this?
[56:43] &gt;&gt; What is the harvest reign? Rapturing
[56:45] faith.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; We've got to come to a faith. This
[56:48] bride's got to come to a faith. Amen. A
[56:50] faith that'll change the atoms in her
[56:52] body. Amen. What she needs to come to
[56:54] that faith is the harvest rain. She
[56:56] needs a visitation like on the plains of
[56:58] memory, but she needs the visitation
[57:00] that takes place in the little room
[57:01] where the Lord comes to her.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; And gives her the strength to conceive
[57:06] seed.
[57:07] Praise God.
[57:10] Oh, where am I?
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, let's keep
[57:15] going.
[57:17] I've already read this. All right.
[57:21] In the end time sign seed, this he
[57:22] preaches the next night. This is uh
[57:24] 03:19. spoken words seed is 03:18. He
[57:28] says, "But the word of God has been sown
[57:30] also. And when the spirit of God begins
[57:32] to fall, the word of God will live in
[57:34] the people. And that false bride that's
[57:36] committed adultery out there and brought
[57:38] herself into creeds and sold out her
[57:39] birthright will reap what? A
[57:41] confederation of church." That's to be
[57:43] bound and burned like the thorns and
[57:44] thistles. But where the word of God's
[57:46] been swn into the people's heart, it
[57:48] will reap a bride for Christ. As certain
[57:50] as I'm standing here, end time signs.
[57:54] In the Smyrna church age, he says he he
[57:57] that hath an ear, let him hear what the
[57:59] spirit say to the churches of each age.
[58:02] In every age, it was the same cry. Hear
[58:04] what the spirit says. If you are a
[58:06] Christian, you will get back to what the
[58:08] spirit is teaching. That is the word of
[58:10] this age. Every messenger to every age
[58:13] will preach the word. Every fresh and
[58:15] true revival will be because men have
[58:17] gotten back to the word for their age.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the revival? It's the
[58:23] latter rain. And it's the fire that's
[58:24] falling. It's the spirit of God. It's
[58:26] it's the reviving awakening of the
[58:28] bride. What was it? It's because she was
[58:30] tied back to the word.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; And we want that revival. Amen. That
[58:35] revival is in the word. Amen. Every
[58:37] fresh and true revival because men have
[58:39] gotten back to the word for their age.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; The cry of every age is the rebuke. You
[58:47] have left the word of God. Repent and
[58:49] come back to the word. From the first
[58:51] book in the Bible, Genesis, to the last
[58:53] book, Revelation, there is only one
[58:55] reason for God's displeasure, leaving
[58:57] the word. And there is only one remedy
[58:59] to regain his favor. Back to the word.
[59:02] The spoken word is the original seed.
[59:04] Come back to the word and come back to
[59:06] the original life, the original purpose,
[59:08] the original intent.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; The invisible union. And he says, "But
[59:14] watch when the spiritual bride when she
[59:17] begins to have a revival."
[59:21] &gt;&gt; What's the revival? The latter rain.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; When she begins to have a revival, when
[59:26] she begins to come back and line herself
[59:28] up with the word of God, watch then
[59:31] again, you see how that the scriptures
[59:33] at that time there'll be a message sweep
[59:35] out to catch that bride, catch that
[59:37] woman elect. And I tell you, there's
[59:39] been a message that has swept out and
[59:41] swept the world, and it's caught me.
[59:42] Amen. Amen.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; And the first seal.
[59:48] Now, we're going to keep talking. I'm
[59:50] going to I'm going to make a little
[59:51] turn, but hang with me. And you you all
[59:53] know this, but don't don't get lost in
[59:55] details. Hang with me. We're talking
[59:56] about the revival. We're talking about
[59:58] the harvest rain. We're talking about
[1:00:00] rapturing faith.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Are all those things the same thing?
[1:00:04] Absolutely. And in the first, he said,
[1:00:06] "There's coming forth the seven
[1:00:08] mysterious thunders." That's not even
[1:00:10] written at all. He's talking about the
[1:00:12] seven thunders in Revelations 10. When
[1:00:14] when John heard them and he picked up
[1:00:16] his pen to write and he says, "Don't
[1:00:18] write them." He says, "They're not even
[1:00:19] written at all. There's a mystery in
[1:00:21] those seven thunders." And he says,
[1:00:22] "That's right. And I believe that
[1:00:24] through these seven thunders will be
[1:00:26] revealed in the last days in order to
[1:00:28] get the bride together for what?
[1:00:30] Rapturing faith." So that means the
[1:00:32] preaching of these seven thunders, which
[1:00:34] is the preaching of the seals, which is
[1:00:36] the mysteries revealed, has something to
[1:00:38] do with the harvest rain, the latter
[1:00:40] rain. the revival.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; In order to get the bride together for
[1:00:45] rapturing faith because what we got
[1:00:47] right now, we wouldn't be able to do it.
[1:00:50] There's something we've got to step
[1:00:52] farther. We can't have enough faith for
[1:00:54] divine healing. Harley, we've got to
[1:00:55] have enough faith to be changed in a
[1:00:57] moment and be swept up out of this
[1:00:59] earth.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; So, so what's the harvest rain?
[1:01:02] Rapturing faith. What are those seven
[1:01:04] thunders going to do? Amen. It's going
[1:01:06] to get the bride together for what?
[1:01:07] Rapturing faith.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:11] Now you to see in church age out of the
[1:01:13] church age book he says now this
[1:01:14] messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation
[1:01:16] 10:7 is going to do two things. One
[1:01:19] according to Malachi 4 he will turn the
[1:01:20] hearts of the children to the fathers.
[1:01:22] Two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:01:24] seven thunders in Revelations 10 which
[1:01:27] are the revelations contained in the
[1:01:29] seven seals.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; It will be these divinely revealed
[1:01:32] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:01:34] hearts of the children to the
[1:01:35] Pentecostal fathers. Exactly. So,
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Did he do it? He did it.
[1:01:42] Third seal.
[1:01:44] Now, remember, we're in the seals now.
[1:01:46] The seals are unfolding. They've not
[1:01:48] finished unfolding. He's only in the
[1:01:50] third seal. He's not finished preaching
[1:01:52] the mysteries of thunders, he's right in
[1:01:54] the middle of it.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; So, that's what this the that's what's
[1:01:58] the reason today that the revivals that
[1:02:00] we're supposed to have, we have
[1:02:02] denominational revivals. We haven't had
[1:02:05] a real stirring.
[1:02:07] Listen, he's talking about revivals.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; A stirring.
[1:02:14] Said, "No, no, no, no, no, sir. Don't
[1:02:16] think we've got revivals. We haven't."
[1:02:18] Oh, they've got millions and millions
[1:02:20] and millions of church members, but not
[1:02:21] a revival nowhere. No, no. The bride
[1:02:24] hasn't had a revival yet.
[1:02:27] Can I do that?
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; See, there's been no revival there. No
[1:02:34] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:02:37] yet. We're looking for it. It will take
[1:02:40] those seven unknown thunders back there
[1:02:43] to wake her up
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; again
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; cuz she's coming back to what she was.
[1:02:49] It'll take those seven unknown thunders
[1:02:51] back there to wake her up again. He will
[1:02:53] send it. He promised it. Amen.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; So these the revelation of these seven
[1:02:58] thunders, the preaching of the seven
[1:03:00] seals has everything to do with the
[1:03:02] latter rain, harvest time, rapturing
[1:03:04] faith.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Now says Christ is the mystery of God
[1:03:09] revealed. He says notice
[1:03:12] the vindicated word in his body is his
[1:03:14] very victory in the reason of his death.
[1:03:18] See the death not in the spirit when he
[1:03:20] died he only died in the flesh. The
[1:03:21] spirit went to hell and preached to the
[1:03:22] souls in prison. That's right. His flesh
[1:03:24] only died when he raised it up again and
[1:03:27] quickened it. Quicken means made alive.
[1:03:29] His flesh, which is his body, remember
[1:03:31] we had this quote last this past Sunday.
[1:03:34] His flesh, which is his body, and that's
[1:03:36] the word. It's been laying dead for
[1:03:38] years, but it gradually begin to come
[1:03:40] into reformation. And now she's standing
[1:03:43] upon her feet. What? His body, which is
[1:03:46] the word, is her coming back in the
[1:03:49] restoration. Amen. back back in the
[1:03:51] reformation to the restoration
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; and now she's standing upon her feet.
[1:03:57] Now go look where he goes next. Oh, how
[1:03:59] I wish I had time to go back to Ezekiel.
[1:04:01] But guess what, friends? This is
[1:04:02] Wednesday night and we got time to go
[1:04:04] back to Ezekiel. Why don't we go back to
[1:04:06] Ezekiel? Amen.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; I wish I had time to go back in Ezekiel
[1:04:09] and pull out them dry bones and show
[1:04:11] you. He said, "Can these bones live
[1:04:13] again?" He said, "Prophesy."
[1:04:15] So, in order for the bones to live
[1:04:16] again, there has to be prophecy. Amen.
[1:04:19] Someone has to prophesy. How can you pro
[1:04:21] how can how can prophecy come only
[1:04:23] through the prophet? It's the word of
[1:04:24] the Lord. Hear ye dry bones, the word of
[1:04:27] the Lord. And sin you skin came upon
[1:04:30] them and they stood up a mighty army and
[1:04:32] began to march towards Zion. Glory to
[1:04:34] God. That's him. That's him. The
[1:04:37] victory.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Turn with me to Ezekiel 37. I'll pull
[1:04:41] the scripture reference up here. Ezekiel
[1:04:43] 37
[1:04:45] verse one.
[1:04:47] Brother Bren, I'm writing Christ is the
[1:04:49] mystery of God revealed. He goes right
[1:04:50] to Ezekiel, right to the dry bones. And
[1:04:53] he's referring here. He's referring
[1:04:57] to quicken means made alive.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; And his flesh, which is his body, and
[1:05:02] that's the word.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; His flesh, which is his body, and that's
[1:05:12] the word.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; What was Jesus? He was the word made
[1:05:16] flesh. Amen.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; What is his wife supposed to be? The
[1:05:20] word made flesh.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; The original word, the spoken word, the
[1:05:24] original seed. That original word for a
[1:05:26] bride is supposed to come into
[1:05:28] manifestation. And it's supposed to be
[1:05:30] the flesh. The word made flesh again on
[1:05:32] this earth.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; But he says, but it's been laying dead
[1:05:36] for years. What's been laying dead for
[1:05:38] years? It's the word. In what form? His
[1:05:41] body. What body? His bride body.
[1:05:45] But it gradually began to come in the
[1:05:47] reformation and now she's standing on
[1:05:50] her feet.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, now let's go to Ezekiel
[1:05:55] 37 and1 says, "The hand of the Lord was
[1:05:58] upon me and carried me out in the uh in
[1:06:01] the spirit of the Lord and set me down
[1:06:03] in the midst of the valley which was
[1:06:05] full of bones and caused me to pass by
[1:06:08] them round about. And behold, there were
[1:06:10] very many in the open valley, and lo,
[1:06:12] they were very dry." And he said unto
[1:06:15] me," Son of man, can these bones live?
[1:06:17] And I answered, "Oh, oh Lord God, thou
[1:06:20] knowest." Again he said unto me,
[1:06:23] "Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto
[1:06:25] them, Oh ye dry bones, hear the word of
[1:06:28] the Lord. What was it that caused the
[1:06:31] bones to come together?" It was the word
[1:06:33] of the Lord.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the Lord God unto these
[1:06:37] bones, behold, I will cause breath to
[1:06:39] enter unto you, and you shall live.
[1:06:42] Listen.
[1:06:44] And I will lay sin you upon you and will
[1:06:46] bring up flesh upon you and cover you
[1:06:49] with skin and put breath in you and you
[1:06:51] shall live and you shall know that I am
[1:06:53] the Lord. And I prophesied as I was
[1:06:56] commanded and as I prophesied there was
[1:06:58] a noise and behold a shaking and the
[1:07:00] bones came together bone to his bone.
[1:07:03] And when I beheld, lo, the senus and the
[1:07:05] flesh came upon them and the skin
[1:07:07] covered them above but there was no
[1:07:09] breath in them yet. See, listen. He
[1:07:11] began to prophesy and bring back the
[1:07:13] word of the Lord and testify of what God
[1:07:16] was going to do. And he brought it
[1:07:17] through three stages all the way back to
[1:07:19] where she was standing on her feet
[1:07:21] again. But yet, it wasn't a complete
[1:07:23] work. There had to come something. There
[1:07:25] was a former rain, but there had to be a
[1:07:27] latter rain. There was a revival to
[1:07:29] bring the bones together to tie the word
[1:07:31] back together because it's the word
[1:07:33] that's been laying dead. So, he had to
[1:07:34] tie all the word back together in the
[1:07:36] former reign. So there was a prophecy
[1:07:38] and there was a great move and a great
[1:07:40] shaking and it shook the whole world and
[1:07:42] it brought the bride back together to
[1:07:44] the word of God. But something else had
[1:07:46] to happen. There was no breath in there
[1:07:48] yet. They had to come back to the
[1:07:50] fullness of life to complete the
[1:07:51] commission. It didn't didn't finish back
[1:07:54] in the first age.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; So there had to come something else.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:04] Then he said unto me, "Prophesy unto the
[1:08:06] wind."
[1:08:08] Prophesy, son of man, and say to the
[1:08:10] wind, "Thus sayeth the Lord God, uh,
[1:08:13] thus sayeth the Lord God, come from the
[1:08:15] four winds, oh breath, and breathe upon
[1:08:17] these slain that they may live." So I
[1:08:19] prophesied as he commanded me, and the
[1:08:21] breath came into them, and they lived,
[1:08:23] and stood upon their feet, an exceeding
[1:08:26] great army.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; What army is this? Amen. This is the
[1:08:31] same army. This is not a new army. This
[1:08:34] is a restoration of the army. This is a
[1:08:37] turning back to what that army was
[1:08:39] before it fell. And now it's come back.
[1:08:41] And brother Brandham said, "And marching
[1:08:43] to Zion." Amen. Because somewhere along
[1:08:46] the way, the army was defeated. And the
[1:08:48] army fell. And where it fell, it fell
[1:08:51] into ruin and decayed. But under the
[1:08:53] prophecy of the word of the Lord coming
[1:08:54] back under a former reign. He brought
[1:08:57] that army back to its feet by bringing
[1:08:59] the word of the Lord back. But there had
[1:09:01] to come the breath, the spirit, the
[1:09:03] latter reign. It had to be Christ
[1:09:05] himself descending into her to bring the
[1:09:07] army back. Amen. He's not left it up to
[1:09:10] you and I to finish the work that the
[1:09:11] first church aid failed. He came himself
[1:09:14] to be life, to be breath. Breath
[1:09:16] represents life. And he breathed into
[1:09:18] the church his own life. That's what
[1:09:21] when you look at that cloud up there,
[1:09:22] that's the headship of Christ. It was
[1:09:24] Christ. Brother Brenham said, "What is
[1:09:26] that?" It's Christ, the mighty angel.
[1:09:28] Only Christ it can be. And then he tells
[1:09:30] us, "And the seventh angel standing on
[1:09:32] the earth at the time of his coming when
[1:09:34] Christ came back, it had to be when the
[1:09:37] seventh angel was here." That's the
[1:09:38] latter rain.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; That's the harvest rain. That's the
[1:09:42] revival.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; It's the awakening of the bride.
[1:09:48] That's why he goes to Christ the mystery
[1:09:49] of God revealed. If I could just go to
[1:09:51] Ezekiel,
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; if I just had time, I'm so glad we had a
[1:09:55] little more time.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Find out there was two stages to this
[1:10:00] restoration.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; First stage tying together the loose
[1:10:04] ends, but then there had to be breath
[1:10:08] life that come back by a word of
[1:10:11] prophecy.
[1:10:14] Oh friends, like I said before, I feel
[1:10:17] like the most privileged human being on
[1:10:19] the face of this planet.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. Things go right,
[1:10:24] things go wrong. Who cares, friends? We
[1:10:26] know the whole purpose and intent. We
[1:10:28] know the endgame. We don't understand
[1:10:30] what happens in our daily lives.
[1:10:31] Obviously, we have all kinds of mishaps
[1:10:34] and and derailments and detours and
[1:10:36] things that are good and things that are
[1:10:38] bad and things we can't explain. But
[1:10:40] listen, don't worry about all of that.
[1:10:42] That all fits into the program.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; But this is the program.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Got to set our eyes back on things that
[1:10:51] matter.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; So
[1:10:55] they came together bone to bone and sin
[1:10:58] you
[1:11:00] and and sin you and then skin covered
[1:11:03] them and they stood on their feet.
[1:11:06] But there had to come another word of
[1:11:07] prophecy.
[1:11:10] They had to give something to give them
[1:11:13] the faith, something to quicken,
[1:11:15] something to make alive.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And that was a when the it was when the
[1:11:19] prophet, the same prophet who prophesied
[1:11:22] the first time had to have another word
[1:11:24] of prophecy.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Standing in between spoken word is the
[1:11:29] original seed, the former rain, and the
[1:11:31] latter rain.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Knowing the seed's been planted back to
[1:11:35] the original word, waiting to see what
[1:11:37] comes forth. And now in the opening of
[1:11:40] the seals, Amen. Christ has returned to
[1:11:44] his army.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just going to go back. Just bear
[1:11:50] with me because I I I'm just I don't
[1:11:53] know. I just have too much fun.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Remember this quote?
[1:12:00] The word is going to produce sons and
[1:12:01] daughters of God again. Uhhuh. Right.
[1:12:03] That's coming too. What? Look at that
[1:12:04] great latter rain supposed to be done.
[1:12:06] how they would run over the wall, leap
[1:12:08] over the wall. They'll become a mighty
[1:12:09] army. Listen, don't don't expect that
[1:12:12] you're going to take two bounds and jump
[1:12:14] over your neighbor's wall.
[1:12:17] But this is our spiritual condition.
[1:12:19] There is nothing that can hold back the
[1:12:21] bride when she's come together with the
[1:12:23] fullness of the word.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; And they'd be an army coming on. Amen.
[1:12:27] What army? The army that fell is being
[1:12:30] restored.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:34] Oh, praise God.
[1:12:38] Now, in recognizing day, this is now
[1:12:39] we're in 1964,
[1:12:42] I want you to remember that in the third
[1:12:44] seal, he said there's been no revival to
[1:12:46] wake awaken the bride to stir the bride
[1:12:48] yet. But in 1964 July, in recognizing
[1:12:52] day its message, he says everywhere now
[1:12:54] there's no revival.
[1:12:57] Everybody's complaining, ministers
[1:12:58] crying. I was reading one of the
[1:13:00] outstanding papers that's come here to
[1:13:02] the church. A very fine paper. And I
[1:13:04] know the editor and I know the people.
[1:13:07] They're godly people. Very fine. Brother
[1:13:09] and sister Moore of the Herald of His
[1:13:11] Coming. One of the finest papers in the
[1:13:12] field. Herald of His Coming. But they
[1:13:14] hardly will print anything unless it's
[1:13:16] about fast, pray, fast, pray, sound a
[1:13:18] trumpet. How many reads it? You know
[1:13:20] that you see it all the time. Fast pray.
[1:13:22] Fast pray. It's all you hear. Fast and
[1:13:24] pray. We're going to have a great
[1:13:26] breaking of the day. There's a great
[1:13:28] thing going to happen. Oh, you pray,
[1:13:30] pray, pray. We're not too late yet. Why
[1:13:33] do they do that? Why do they do that?
[1:13:35] They want a great awakening. They're
[1:13:38] crying, believing that there will be
[1:13:40] awakening. They're good people. Why is
[1:13:42] it? What have they done? They have not
[1:13:44] recognized the awakening of the bride.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; And the and the third seal, there had
[1:13:50] been no nothing to stir her yet. Nothing
[1:13:52] to wake her up. But here we are. Amen. a
[1:13:54] little over a year later and he says
[1:13:56] there's been there's been an awakening
[1:13:58] of the bride. What was it? It was those
[1:13:59] seven unknown thunders back there that
[1:14:01] wake her up.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; They have rec not recognized the
[1:14:05] awakening of the bride. See, by being
[1:14:07] Christian, they feel the pull of the
[1:14:09] hour, but they haven't recognized what's
[1:14:11] been done. That's what's making them
[1:14:13] feel that way. They know something is
[1:14:15] supposed to happen, but see, they're
[1:14:17] looking for it way off in the future to
[1:14:19] come when it's already when it's already
[1:14:23] happened right by you.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Can I highlight that?
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Don't let this be our mistake. Now,
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; someday something's going to happen
[1:14:34] someday. I'm telling you, it's already
[1:14:36] happened. The latter rain has fallen.
[1:14:37] Christ has come. He's here uniting with
[1:14:39] his bride. Amen. What are we here to do?
[1:14:42] Get all the way into the word. Submit
[1:14:44] and surrender all the way to it. Feed on
[1:14:46] all of it. It's already here. The
[1:14:48] awakening of the bride, the bride's
[1:14:50] revival, the harvest rain, the rapturing
[1:14:52] faith. It's been given to us, friends.
[1:14:54] Let's just absorb it and eat it and
[1:14:56] feast on it and give our whole lives to
[1:14:58] it continually again and again. It
[1:15:00] doesn't mean that there's not going to
[1:15:01] be something God's going to do with the
[1:15:03] bride. There may not. There may be other
[1:15:04] manifestations. I don't know what he's
[1:15:07] going to do and may not do, but I'm not
[1:15:09] looking for a revival. I've seen the
[1:15:11] revival. I've experienced the revival.
[1:15:13] Amen. This the restoration of the word,
[1:15:15] the unveiling of the mystery of God's
[1:15:17] mind was the revival and awakening of
[1:15:19] the bride.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; If we keep looking to the future,
[1:15:22] looking to the future, looking to the
[1:15:24] future, we're missing what God has
[1:15:26] already given to take us into the
[1:15:28] future, to take us beyond the future, to
[1:15:30] where there's no more future. To where
[1:15:32] we do it eternity, where you never say
[1:15:34] future again.
[1:15:35] [Applause]
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:40] Amen. So realize what we have, awaken to
[1:15:44] what's been given to us and enjoy and
[1:15:46] feast on and value and love and submit
[1:15:49] to and surrender to what's already been
[1:15:52] given to us.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to be pointing and
[1:15:57] pointing and pointing and pointing when
[1:16:00] it's already here.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; We're looking for a way off in the
[1:16:04] future to come when it's already
[1:16:05] happened right by you. Feast
[1:16:12] of trumps is the Holy Spirit has been
[1:16:14] bound by these denominational rivers for
[1:16:17] almost 2,000 years
[1:16:20] but is loosed in the evening time.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; By the evening time message.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit back in the church.
[1:16:30] Christ himself revealed in human flesh
[1:16:33] in the evening time. He said it. He
[1:16:36] promised it.
[1:16:38] So, are we looking for another move of
[1:16:40] the Holy Ghost? No. He's already moved,
[1:16:43] friend.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; We're looking for that move to change
[1:16:46] our life. We're looking for that move,
[1:16:48] Amen, to bring us into every other move.
[1:16:50] We're looking for what God has said,
[1:16:51] amen, to have preeminence in us so that
[1:16:54] it could finish the work that he's left
[1:16:55] for this specific time to finish.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; It'll be him doing it, but he's promised
[1:17:00] that he loosed it in the evening time by
[1:17:02] the evening time message. That means
[1:17:04] it's already loosed the Holy Spirit
[1:17:05] back. What is that? That's the reign.
[1:17:08] The rain is what? The spirit falling on
[1:17:09] the people. The Holy Ghost where? Back
[1:17:11] in the church again. Christ himself
[1:17:13] revealed in human flesh in the end time.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; That's the bride's revival. What is the
[1:17:18] bride's revival? It's him.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; He's my revival. Amen. His spirit, his
[1:17:23] life coming into us.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; The bride's revival.
[1:17:28] Amen. I believe he's got more he wants
[1:17:30] to do. But he's going to do it through
[1:17:33] this revival,
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; through this awakening, through this
[1:17:36] bride that he's united with.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; In Hosea 6, he says, "Then shall we know
[1:17:42] if we follow on to know the Lord, his
[1:17:45] going forth is prepared as the morning,
[1:17:47] and he shall come unto us." Will the
[1:17:50] Lord come unto us?
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; How? He shall come unto us as the rain,
[1:17:55] as the latter and former rain unto the
[1:17:57] earth.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. the restoration of the word and
[1:18:00] the restoration of his life.
[1:18:04] The invisible union. He says, "The word
[1:18:07] promises this. It shall come to pass
[1:18:10] before the great and terrible day of the
[1:18:11] Lord shall come. Behold, I will send
[1:18:13] unto you Elijah the prophet, and he
[1:18:15] shall turn the hearts of the children
[1:18:16] back to the fathers. It shall come to
[1:18:19] pass in the last days, I'll pour out my
[1:18:21] spirit from on high. The former and
[1:18:23] latter reign shall come together in the
[1:18:26] last day." Is that what he said all the
[1:18:28] way back in Joel? In the first month.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; That means the same time. Brother Benham
[1:18:33] shows that it's the same time and the
[1:18:35] same season under the same prophetic
[1:18:37] ministry that the former and latter
[1:18:39] reign is going to come together in the
[1:18:41] last days.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; And it has.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; It has.
[1:18:48] And things that are to be. He says, I
[1:18:50] believe that's the same thing we live in
[1:18:52] today. God bearing record of his word by
[1:18:55] vindicating what he said he would do.
[1:18:57] Now we know that this is the day of
[1:18:59] salvation where God is calling men from
[1:19:01] the world from a life of sin into a life
[1:19:03] of service. And in the day that God has
[1:19:05] poured out his spirit from on high,
[1:19:07] great signs and wonders are to accompany
[1:19:09] the ministry of this day when the former
[1:19:12] and latter rain are falling together.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; We got it.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; It's falling together.
[1:19:20] As we know that there is supposed to be
[1:19:22] great signs and wonders which in many
[1:19:24] great denominations this is turned down.
[1:19:29] You know
[1:19:31] this experience of former and latter
[1:19:33] reign it took place in the prophet's
[1:19:36] ministry
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; cuz it fell in the end time. It fell
[1:19:40] through that prophetic ministry. The
[1:19:42] former and latter reign fell together.
[1:19:44] So we can stand here and say this day
[1:19:47] this scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:19:48] eyes,
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; in your ears. It's it's it's already
[1:19:51] done. But listen, we each have our own
[1:19:54] experience of former and latter reign.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Every bride member has an experience of
[1:19:59] former and latter reign because I wasn't
[1:20:01] there in 1962, 63, 60. I came along much
[1:20:06] later in 1999 in the year 2000. But oh,
[1:20:10] praise God. I had a revival when I saw
[1:20:12] the restoration of the word. When I
[1:20:14] realized that what had happened to my
[1:20:16] Bible and what my church was teaching me
[1:20:18] is wrong and what the truth was. I had a
[1:20:20] revival. Amen. But then I got stuck
[1:20:22] between two revivals.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; I realized what the truth was. I
[1:20:27] realized what the word was. I realized
[1:20:29] what the church that happened to the
[1:20:30] church. I realized that there was a
[1:20:31] restoration. Amen. But then what about
[1:20:33] me? Amen. Now all of a sudden I was
[1:20:35] coming back lining up with the word
[1:20:37] baptized right. Understood the nature of
[1:20:39] God. Amen. Understood the church ages
[1:20:40] and all that. But I had to have a latter
[1:20:42] rain experience myself. I had to have
[1:20:45] the breath of God descend upon me. I had
[1:20:47] to realize what the mystery was laying
[1:20:49] under those seals. And the great mystery
[1:20:51] of God under those seals was that I was
[1:20:53] part of that being. I was part of that
[1:20:55] life and his life wanted to express in
[1:20:57] me.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; And talk about a breath, friends. Talk
[1:21:01] about another word of prophecy, another
[1:21:03] boost. Amen. Now she's standing on her
[1:21:06] feet and marching to Zion.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; And this latter former and latter reign.
[1:21:10] Yes, it's history. Yes, it fell in the
[1:21:13] same day. Amen. But it's still available
[1:21:15] to anybody who still needs a revival, an
[1:21:18] awakening. And until all of the bride is
[1:21:20] awakened, you can still have a former
[1:21:22] latter rain experience, friends.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; You young people can have a former
[1:21:26] latter rain experience. Don't get stuck
[1:21:28] between two revivals. It's all dying
[1:21:30] down. It's all getting dry. If you're in
[1:21:32] that place and you believe the word and
[1:21:34] believe what you've been taught and you
[1:21:35] know the restoration of the word, I
[1:21:37] encourage you, keep feeding on the
[1:21:39] message. Keep praying for revelation
[1:21:41] because there's a latter rain that has
[1:21:43] to come next. And if not, you'll just be
[1:21:45] a dead church member standing on your
[1:21:47] feet looking like an army member but
[1:21:49] with no life in you.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; This revival is still available to the
[1:21:54] bride.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad I had my experience. But
[1:21:58] I'm not done with the latter rain yet. I
[1:22:01] love it when he breathes on me fresh. I
[1:22:03] love it when it comes fresh again. When
[1:22:05] I go back to the message of the hour and
[1:22:07] revelation starts pouring in all over
[1:22:09] again, it thrills my soul. I'm not done
[1:22:12] with my latter rain revival
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; because it's through that revival he's
[1:22:18] going to bring me into every promised
[1:22:19] work and every manifestation he wants to
[1:22:21] do. And it's not going to be me doing
[1:22:23] one bit of it because he left his work
[1:22:26] to do in her in this specific time. And
[1:22:28] now he has to do it in and through the
[1:22:30] bride. That's why he's brought his life
[1:22:32] back, his breath back, his spirit back
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; so that he can have a vessel to work in.
[1:22:37] And I just want to be that vessel.
[1:22:40] [Music]
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; I don't want to mess it up by adding my
[1:22:43] own works. I don't know what he wants to
[1:22:44] do next. I don't know how to do what he
[1:22:46] wants to do. I have no capability in my
[1:22:48] flesh to do and in my mind to figure it
[1:22:50] out, but I want him to have preeminence
[1:22:52] because that's the great purpose he's
[1:22:54] looking for in this day, to have
[1:22:55] preeminence in a group of people.
[1:22:58] so that through that revival he can
[1:23:01] bring the final manifestation of his
[1:23:03] life on this earth.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Have it in me, oh God almighty.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Have it in me.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Don't stop between two revivals,
[1:23:12] friends.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Keep pressing on.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; If you find yourself spoken words, the
[1:23:22] original seed,
[1:23:24] something's happened. Something's
[1:23:26] happened. It's happened to me. I believe
[1:23:28] it.
[1:23:30] But yet, it seems to be dying down.
[1:23:35] Amen. Just keep pressing on until
[1:23:36] something else happens.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Until you hear that prophet prophesy
[1:23:42] again to you,
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; until that word of prophecy is to you,
[1:23:46] remember when that prophet was
[1:23:48] prophesying again, he
[1:23:51] he was prophesying through the wind.
[1:23:52] Amen. To come to a place, what place? To
[1:23:55] the army.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. It had a resting place. It had a
[1:23:58] purpose in the prophecy. It had a thing
[1:24:00] it was going to accomplish. And that
[1:24:02] prophecy was going to bring the life,
[1:24:04] the breath, amen, the power, the
[1:24:06] anointing, the Holy Ghost of God into a
[1:24:08] bride.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; And that's for me.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; That's for me personally. Right.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; And the anointed ones at the end time.
[1:24:18] He says, "Now therefore, the rain
[1:24:19] dropping down upon the natural
[1:24:21] vegetation of the earth is a type of the
[1:24:22] spiritual rain which gives eternal life
[1:24:25] dropping down upon the church. For we
[1:24:27] call it the former rain and latter rain.
[1:24:29] It is rain pouring out of God's spirit
[1:24:32] upon his church.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; I love that rain."
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Now look at what he says here in
[1:24:38] questions and answers. And what was the
[1:24:41] last sign that they had before the
[1:24:44] promised son that they had waited on all
[1:24:46] those years come back was God standing
[1:24:48] in the form of a man and could discern
[1:24:50] the thoughts that was in Sarah's heart.
[1:24:52] Sarah being the church representing the
[1:24:54] church. Discern the thoughts that's in
[1:24:56] the church that was even behind him. Is
[1:24:58] that right? You know, brother B's
[1:25:00] referring to his ministry, right?
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; And immediately after that, she changed
[1:25:05] back to a young woman and him a young
[1:25:06] man. And Isaac was brought on the scene,
[1:25:08] the promised son. I believe you're
[1:25:10] seeing the last thing that'll happen to
[1:25:12] the church before the rapture. That's
[1:25:15] exactly I believe it. The rain is over.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Can I highlight that?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Listen, don't think the rain's over for
[1:25:26] you. You're part of the bride.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; You're part of that army in Ezekiel.
[1:25:29] It's for you. But what he's telling you
[1:25:31] is don't look for something else to
[1:25:34] come. It's come.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; That rain has come. It has been
[1:25:38] manifest. It has been preached. It has
[1:25:40] been delivered.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; And he's teaching us. Brother Bam is
[1:25:44] saying, he's not saying there's no more
[1:25:46] awakening of the bride.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Because if he had in 1964, then I'm
[1:25:50] wasting all my time up here, friends.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; But what he's telling you is what was
[1:25:56] supposed to come has come. And now it's
[1:25:57] over. Don't look for another.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:05] says, "As ministers of the gospel, I
[1:26:07] can't see one thing left but the going
[1:26:10] of the bride. Not another reign, not
[1:26:13] another revival,
[1:26:15] but the going away of the bride."
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:26:21] The new birth is Christ is a revelation.
[1:26:24] God has revealed to you this great
[1:26:26] mystery and that's a new birth. Now,
[1:26:28] what are you going to do when you get
[1:26:29] all that grouped together where the
[1:26:31] revelation is perfectly in harmony and
[1:26:33] God expressing it through his word by
[1:26:35] the same actions, the same things that
[1:26:37] he did, making the word manifest? Oh, if
[1:26:39] the church only knew its position, it
[1:26:42] will one day. Then the rapture will go
[1:26:46] when it knows what it is.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Not the rapture will come because the
[1:26:50] rapture comes with a shout.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; The gathering together
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; of the bride through the message. But
[1:26:57] the rapture will go when the church
[1:27:00] knows its position. That's what God's
[1:27:02] constantly trying to get us to see.
[1:27:04] That's the revelation that's coming.
[1:27:05] That's why we're feeding on this word.
[1:27:07] And listen, it's not a new message. It's
[1:27:09] the same message brother Brandon
[1:27:10] preached so many years ago. But listen,
[1:27:12] friends, we weren't seeing everything
[1:27:13] that he was telling us. He was trying to
[1:27:15] get us to see, oh, we saw Malachi 4. We
[1:27:18] saw a prophet. We saw a restored word.
[1:27:20] We saw denominations were wrong. We saw
[1:27:23] Rome was going to rise up and the
[1:27:24] Catholic Church was going to take power.
[1:27:26] But what have we had been missing? We
[1:27:27] missing the bride coming of Christ. We
[1:27:29] missed our position what the church is
[1:27:31] supposed to be in the end time.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; And God is wanting us to see it and
[1:27:35] awakening us to it and revealing it to
[1:27:37] us hour by hour, day by day. And when
[1:27:40] the church, all the church, everybody
[1:27:42] knows its position, then the rapture
[1:27:44] will go.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; How am I going to see it? Don't we need
[1:27:49] another move of the spirit? We've
[1:27:51] already had the move of the spirit that
[1:27:52] reveals it. We need to go back and trust
[1:27:55] it and feed on it and receive it and
[1:27:57] love it and embrace it and everything.
[1:27:59] You can listen to it, friends.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; So, what do I need to do? Why don't you
[1:28:03] play a tape again? Why don't you read a
[1:28:05] book again? Why don't you come with
[1:28:07] enthusiasm full of the word of God
[1:28:09] knowing that this is the bride's
[1:28:10] revival? This is the awakening of the
[1:28:12] bride. What brother Brandham brought.
[1:28:14] Amen. It's not just the opening of the
[1:28:16] seals, but after the opening of the
[1:28:17] seals, he said, "My Bible became a new
[1:28:19] book." Amen. God put peeled back the
[1:28:22] veil even for the prophet. And what he
[1:28:24] started preaching from 63 on was the
[1:28:26] seventh seal, the bride's message. Go
[1:28:28] back and feed on it with everything that
[1:28:31] you got. Friend, don't sit on your hands
[1:28:33] and say, "Well, someday something will
[1:28:35] happen. Someday something will happen."
[1:28:37] It's already happened. Just take it and
[1:28:39] feed on it and become one with it. This
[1:28:42] is the bride revival. This is the
[1:28:44] awakening of the bride. This is Christ
[1:28:46] returning the word returning to his
[1:28:49] bride. Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; This is the invisible union. This is
[1:28:53] Christ coming in bride form.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Don't neglect it. Don't discard it.
[1:28:58] Don't think you're going to just get it
[1:28:59] on Wednesdays and Sundays, but throw
[1:29:01] yourself, immerse yourself into it with
[1:29:03] everything you got because this is it.
[1:29:05] This is the revival.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we wait and think some great
[1:29:10] thing will happen and then a pressure
[1:29:12] will come and then we'll do this and
[1:29:13] we'll do that. Listen, if there's
[1:29:15] anything going to be done, it's going to
[1:29:17] be the outcropping of what's been done,
[1:29:19] what's been given, what's been preached,
[1:29:21] what's been revealed,
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; It'll bring us through. It'll show
[1:29:25] itself. It'll manifest.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Yeah.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; So, the last thing I want to read,
[1:29:38] Proverbs 16:15.
[1:29:41] And the light of the king's countenance
[1:29:43] is life, and his favor is as a cloud of
[1:29:47] the latter rain.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Have you seen the cloud of the latter
[1:29:52] rain?
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Do you got it hanging in your house? Do
[1:29:55] you have it on a card? Have you seen it
[1:29:57] out in the foyer here? I I mean there's
[1:29:59] a little pendant with it out there on
[1:30:01] the on the welcome desk right now. Amen.
[1:30:04] The king's favor is as a cloud of the
[1:30:07] latter rain.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:30:11] Elijah on Mount Carmel showdown when he
[1:30:13] brought him back to the word, he
[1:30:14] restored the original worship. He told
[1:30:16] him, "Would you quit blending your
[1:30:18] religion? If Baal be God, serve him. If
[1:30:20] God be God, serve him. But quit mixing
[1:30:23] this thing together." And he built back
[1:30:24] the 12 original stones and brought back
[1:30:26] the altar. And he brought signs and
[1:30:28] wonders and miracles to vindicate. Amen.
[1:30:30] That what he was telling was the truth
[1:30:31] according to the vision of the Lord. But
[1:30:33] after that, amen, he began to pray for
[1:30:36] what? He began to pray for the rain to
[1:30:38] come. Amen. And he got down with his
[1:30:40] head between his knees and he prayed and
[1:30:42] he sent he sent his servant up to say,
[1:30:44] "Hey, is it do you see anything?" He saw
[1:30:47] nothing. He prayed again. But on the
[1:30:49] seventh time, he went.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in the seventh age, he
[1:30:53] says, "I see a little cloud coming out
[1:30:55] of the sea about the size of a man's
[1:30:57] hand." And he says, "Oh, send for Ahab,
[1:30:59] for I hear an abundance of rain." That
[1:31:03] little cloud didn't bring a little
[1:31:04] drizzle, but that little cloud under the
[1:31:06] Elijah ministry brought in the seventh
[1:31:09] time in the seventh age brought an
[1:31:11] abundance of rain, friend.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; It was the refreshing from the Lord. It
[1:31:16] was the awakening of the bride. It
[1:31:18] brought rapturing faith to us. Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; And it's the king's favor, friends.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; I feel favored. Do you feel favored?
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; I feel thrilled.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; God is so good.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Do you appreciate the former and latter
[1:31:40] reign?
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. Don't look for
[1:31:46] another revival, friends.
[1:31:49] enjoy the one we've got.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Don't look for something else to come.
[1:31:54] Receive what's come
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; and let that life carry us wherever he
[1:31:58] wants to carry us and do with us
[1:32:00] whatever he wants to do with us. For too
[1:32:03] long, we've we've either there's been
[1:32:05] two mistakes that we can easily make.
[1:32:08] Either sitting on sitting on our heels
[1:32:11] thinking, well, when God wants to do
[1:32:12] something, it'll happen and I'm just
[1:32:13] sitting here buying time till something
[1:32:15] happens. or I need to make something
[1:32:18] happen.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Both of those are as wrong as the east
[1:32:22] is from the west. But what I need to do
[1:32:24] is throw myself into what has happened
[1:32:26] and give myself completely to the word
[1:32:28] of God and then let that life do what he
[1:32:31] wants to do.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; It's not sitting doing nothing wasting
[1:32:36] time waiting for God to do something.
[1:32:38] And neither it is me getting to action
[1:32:40] by my own reasoning and my thoughts and
[1:32:42] making something happen.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Right? But me diving into the awakening
[1:32:48] of the bride, enjoying my revival.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; What is he revived? He's revived the
[1:32:55] army that was laying there as dead.
[1:32:56] What's he revived? He's revived the
[1:32:58] church that had died to the church age.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; He's revived me
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; back to what he ordained me to be before
[1:33:05] this foundation of the world as a son or
[1:33:07] daughter of God. He has revived me from
[1:33:09] the deadness of ignorance, from the
[1:33:11] deadness of having my mind blackened and
[1:33:13] alienated from God. And he's brought me
[1:33:15] from death unto life. He has risen me.
[1:33:17] He's awakened me. He has restored me.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love him.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Let's sing a song.
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:32] We've got the power
[1:33:36] in the name of Jesus.
[1:33:41] We've got the power
[1:33:46] in the name of the Lord.
[1:33:51] Though Satan rages,
[1:33:55] we cannot be defeated.
[1:33:59] We've got the power
[1:34:04] in the name of the Lord. One more time.
[1:34:08] We've got the power
[1:34:13] in the name of Jesus.
[1:34:18] We've got the power
[1:34:22] in the name of the Lord.
[1:34:27] Oh, Satan rages.
[1:34:31] We cannot be defeated.
[1:34:36] We've got the power
[1:34:40] in the name of the Lord.
[1:34:45] Amen. God bless you, friends. Aren't you
[1:34:48] happy?
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thrilled? Hey, listen.
[1:34:51] Tomorrow you're going to have problems.
[1:34:53] There's going to be disappointments,
[1:34:55] struggles, things that don't go right.
[1:34:56] And you're not going to understand why.
[1:34:58] You may get frustrated. Your mind get
[1:35:00] may get foggy and you may forget some of
[1:35:02] the things you heard tonight.
[1:35:05] If you live anything like I live, but
[1:35:08] oh, if we could just realize he's
[1:35:10] already awakened in my soul. He's
[1:35:12] already restored me and brought me back.
[1:35:15] Everything is going to work together for
[1:35:17] his good and serve his purpose. I don't
[1:35:19] get the need to get nervous. I don't
[1:35:20] need to be afraid. I don't need to
[1:35:22] panic. Everything's under control.
[1:35:25] Everything's all right. God bless you.
[1:35:28] Before we pray, I just want to say it's
[1:35:30] been good to have brother Michael here.
[1:35:32] And brother Michael shared with me a
[1:35:34] link of his testimony he shared uh up in
[1:35:37] Sheffield, Ohio at Brother Samuel
[1:35:39] Brownings back in July. So if you get a
[1:35:41] chance, go find Brother Samuel
[1:35:42] Browning's website. You should be able
[1:35:44] to find it easily. And go back to July.
[1:35:47] Do you remember the date?
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; July 6.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; July 6th. If you go back to July 6, he
[1:35:52] shares his testimony and God's done
[1:35:54] amazing things for that brother. God
[1:35:56] uses him as a translator and blessed him
[1:35:59] and many things and so it' be
[1:36:01] encouraging for you to for for you to
[1:36:03] hear that. Amen. Also want to greet uh
[1:36:06] Jacqueline's parents. God bless you.
[1:36:08] It's good to have you guys here. I
[1:36:09] failed to greet them on Sunday, but
[1:36:11] they're here. They've been I think
[1:36:12] missing their daughter and
[1:36:13] grandchildren. So, we get the privilege
[1:36:15] of visiting with you. God bless you.
[1:36:18] Amen. It's good to have you. God bless
[1:36:19] you all. Let's bow our heads together
[1:36:21] and pray.
[1:36:23] Dear heavenly father, we're so thankful
[1:36:25] God
[1:36:27] that God, you have rubbed the Isav of
[1:36:30] this message in our eyes.
[1:36:32] God, you've given us eyes to see and
[1:36:34] ears to hear. for you determined it
[1:36:37] before the foundation of the world,
[1:36:40] Lord Jesus. We know there's nothing we
[1:36:41] could have done to save ourselves, to
[1:36:44] awaken ourselves,
[1:36:47] God, but you did it all for us. We're so
[1:36:50] grateful, Lord.
[1:36:52] Lord, I believe your favor is as the
[1:36:54] cloud of the latter rain when you came
[1:36:57] yourself to shower your life upon us to
[1:37:01] bring us into that final stage of growth
[1:37:03] to mature us to complete us Lord for
[1:37:06] that is the purpose of the latter rain
[1:37:08] to take the seed Lord at harvest time
[1:37:12] and to bring that final outpouring
[1:37:15] that'll last all the way to the end. And
[1:37:18] God that is what you have done Lord in
[1:37:20] this age. You've poured yourself into
[1:37:22] us. It's that final portion, all of you.
[1:37:26] And it will last all the way till the
[1:37:29] wheat is gathered into the gardener.
[1:37:32] Lord, we don't have to look for another
[1:37:33] one. You've already sent it, Lord.
[1:37:36] You're already here, present to bring it
[1:37:38] to pass. We love you. We ask your
[1:37:41] blessing to be upon us, Lord Jesus. I
[1:37:45] pray, Father God, that you would, Lord,
[1:37:47] bless your children. If there's any here
[1:37:49] that's between two revivals in their own
[1:37:51] life, may you bring them to that latter
[1:37:53] rain revival, Lord. May you awaken them
[1:37:56] to who they are in you and what their
[1:37:58] purpose is in this life. May you reveal
[1:38:00] yourself to them.
[1:38:03] God, we ask that you would bless each
[1:38:05] one of us as we go from here. Strengthen
[1:38:06] us, use us, anoint us for your purpose.
[1:38:10] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:38:14] Listen friends, as I said in my prayer,
[1:38:18] that latter rain, Brother Bram describes
[1:38:21] it as the harvest rain. When that rain
[1:38:24] falls, it marks the beginning of the
[1:38:26] harvest season. And the harvest season
[1:38:28] will end with all the garner being
[1:38:31] gathered, all the wheat being gathered
[1:38:33] back to the garner. And that rain
[1:38:35] provides the last bit of moisture
[1:38:38] that'll bring the final ripening to the
[1:38:40] full stage of Christ.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. But listen, at harvest time, he
[1:38:46] doesn't send more rain. You don't want
[1:38:48] rain at harvest time because the seed
[1:38:51] has to dry out and the presence of the
[1:38:53] sun. This words has been delivered. So,
[1:38:56] what he's already given us is the
[1:38:58] moisture it takes to bring this ride
[1:39:00] bride to full maturity.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Now, there's been this dry period. No
[1:39:05] prophet, no worldwide work, no turning
[1:39:08] their back and discerning the heart. No,
[1:39:11] he's already done it. And that was the
[1:39:13] harvest rain to bring all the moisture,
[1:39:17] the spirit of God back in us that we
[1:39:19] need to come to full harvest maturity.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Now, in this dry period, since the
[1:39:24] prophet lets the scene, there's
[1:39:25] moisture. Yes, friends, from the latter
[1:39:27] rain.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Go back to the latter rain.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; But it's the it's the thing that brings
[1:39:35] full harvest maturity.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. God bless you
[1:39:41] as we're dismissed. Let's sing another
[1:39:43] song. Well, God has got a bride that's
[1:39:47] marching through this land with praises
[1:39:51] in her mouth and healing in her hand.
[1:39:56] Everlasting joy and gladness in her
[1:40:00] heart. And in this pride, I've got a
[1:40:04] part.
[1:40:06] Well, God has got a bride that's
[1:40:09] marching through this land with praises
[1:40:13] in her mouth and healing in her hand.
[1:40:18] Everlasting joy and gladness in her
[1:40:21] heart. And in this bride, I've got a
[1:40:25] part.
[1:40:28] Well, God has got a bride that's
[1:40:31] marching through this land with praises
[1:40:34] in her mouth,
[1:40:36] healing in her hand,
[1:40:39] everlasting joy and gladness in her
[1:40:43] heart. And in this bride, I've got a
[1:40:47] heart one more time. Well, God has got a
[1:40:51] bride that's marching through this land
[1:40:54] with praises in her mouth and healing in
[1:40:58] her hand.
[1:41:00] Everlasting joy and gladness in her
[1:41:04] heart. In this bride, I've got a part.
[1:41:10] Well, and in this bride I've got a part.

[1:41:25] from the dead dwells in you,
[1:41:29] dwells in you.
[1:41:32] If that same spirit that raised Christ

[1:47:13] that you desire. Higher
[1:47:16] [Applause]
[1:47:18] in my life.
[1:47:20] [Music]
[1:47:23] In my life.
[1:47:28] And work with our hands.
[1:47:32] Speak with our lips.
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:37] See with our eyes
[1:47:41] and walk with our feet.
[1:47:46] Have the preeminence
[1:47:49] that you desire
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:54] in our lives.
[1:47:59] In our lives.
[1:48:04] It was a tiny simple stable
[1:48:09] all beaten
[1:48:11] and worn.
[1:48:14] Hardly the place
[1:48:17] for a king to behold.
[1:48:21] It didn't take something special
[1:48:26] to reveal his majesty.
[1:48:30] So I know if I give him control,
[1:48:35] he'll be born in me.
[1:48:40] Let your word
[1:48:43] be born
[1:48:45] in the manger of my heart.
[1:48:50] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[1:48:58] Live inside this house of clay.
[1:49:03] Mold me by day.
[1:49:07] Let your word be born
[1:49:10] in the manger
[1:49:13] of
[1:49:15] my heart.
[1:49:20] Outwardly I'm nothing.
[1:49:24] Not much to behold.
[1:49:28] Hardly the place
[1:49:32] for his word to unfold.
[1:49:36] But if I'll just yield this vessel,
[1:49:41] let him have his way
[1:49:45] from glory onto glory.
[1:49:49] He'll change me day by day.
[1:49:54] Let your word
[1:49:58] be born
[1:50:00] in the manger of my heart.
[1:50:05] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[1:50:12] Live inside this house of clay
[1:50:17] and mold me day by day.
[1:50:21] that your word be born
[1:50:25] in the manger.
[1:50:30] Heart
[1:50:31] was one. It was a tiny simple sten
[1:50:37] [Music]
[1:50:40] and worn
[1:50:42] hardly a place
[1:50:46] for a king to be born.
[1:50:50] He didn't choose something special
[1:50:54] to reveal his majesty.
[1:50:58] So I know if I give him control,
[1:51:03] he'll be born in me.
[1:51:08] Let your word
[1:51:11] be born
[1:51:13] in the manger of my heart.
[1:51:18] Let it live.
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:23] Let it start
[1:51:26] inside this house of clay.
[1:51:31] Hold me every day.
[1:51:35] Let your word be born
[1:51:39] in the manger
[1:51:41] of my heart outwardly.
[1:51:46] [Music]
[1:51:48] Outwardly I'm nothing,
[1:51:51] not much to behold.
[1:51:56] Hardly the place
[1:51:59] for his word to unfold.
[1:52:04] But if I'll just heal my vessel
[1:52:08] and let him have his way
[1:52:12] from glory unto glory
[1:52:16] and change me day by day.
[1:52:22] Let your word
[1:52:25] be born
[1:52:26] in the manger of my heart.
[1:52:31] Let it live.
[1:52:33] [Music]
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Let it start.
[1:52:39] Live inside this house of clay
[1:52:44] and mold it every day.
[1:52:48] Let your word be born
[1:52:52] in the manger
[1:52:55] of my heart. Let your word,
[1:53:00] let your word
[1:53:02] be born
[1:53:04] in the manger of my heart.
[1:53:09] Let it live in me.
[1:53:13] Let it start.
[1:53:17] Live inside this house of clay
[1:53:21] and hold it every day.
[1:53:26] Let your word be born
[1:53:29] in the manger
[1:53:32] of
[1:53:34] my home.
