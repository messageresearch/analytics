ourselves privileged Lord to be able to gather to Worship You Lord to hear your word preached Lord to have the Revelation you've given us in this hour Lord and we're asking that you would Lord that you would give us a greater Revelation that you would open yourself more to us that we might see more of you this morning and God we're asking that you would take preeminence among us and that you would have your way and that you would speak your words of life and may we all have ears to hear and receive all that you have for us father I yield myself to your hand and ask that you would take this vessel and use it for your purpose God may I get out of the way and allow you freedom to move as you wish God we want that Lord that's what we desire we want to be vessels that you can use and may you use us For Your Glory may you have your way and may you move freely amongst us Lord may you drop Revelation into our hearts planting your seed May It Grow to bear fruit for your kingdom may you be glorified in all we say and do we love you father and we just invite you to take your place at the head of the table that you might come and break the bread of life for us we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you while you're standing let's take our Bibles and turn to the Book of Jeremiah and while you're turning as brother Ben said we want to remember brother Gabe and his family they're up in lurine ministering for brother Nathaniel And um they'll be traveling back this afternoon so we want to remember them also want to say how much I enjoyed the Wednesday evening service with brother Stan I'm so glad that we were able to get acquainted with him and I mean there was more things I wanted to hear I wish he would have stopped and went further in many things but I know he's got a daughter in Ohio and he may have to come back and visit her so I'm going to try to stay dialed in and catch amen The Vibes when he's coming back cuz I would certainly love to have him come back Minister again and have more opportunity for some of us to fellowship with him so we just want to say how much we enjoyed that and it was wonderful also want to welcome our visitors I see some of the Finley family God bless you it's good to have you here and also sister Emily Sanders parents are here so I know there's a drawing power here in those grandbabies but it's good to have you with us amen let's look Jeremiah chapter 1 together if we could turn there uh I'm going to do a part two from last uh Sunday on the genes of his word the genes of his word part two and there was uh some things that I didn't get to express last time there was not enough time and then brother Stan came and he said some things that were just so complimentary and things that were encouraging to me and opened my eyes even further and so I want to come back and express some of those things amen and and uh with the understanding that God's open so let's look at Jeremiah 1 verse4 then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations amen God bless you as you take your seat keep your place here in Jeremiah chapter 1 but we're going to come back to this in just a minute but when we looked at the genes of his word if you'll remember from last Sunday we went to two places in the scripture where Jesus spoke of seed and in one place he talked about how the son of man sowed a seed into the field but the enemy came along and so to seal a seed into the field and when they came up they they found that there was tears there was mixed in with the wheat there was a mixed seed and and he explained The Parables the son of man sowed the seed which are the Saints but the enemy came and he SED tears um among the wheat and at the end time that they would be separated so he made the seed the children of the Kingdom but then in another Parable he he he talked about sewing the seed into the four types uh of soil into the the byway and in the sidewalk and in the and the thorny patches and in the Stony ground and then some into the good ground then he made the good ground the predestinated the elect and he made the seed his word amen and I venture to say that that both pares are different ways of explaining the same thing amen because what are the SE Children of the Kingdom what are the seed of God it's his word you're part of the word and the word is the seed and the seed is in you as part of God's word amen so in in one place the seed is you and another place is the word that falls into you amen but we know that the word comes to the word to Quicken the life the word to manifest the word in the end it's all the word amen and so I want to read the same quote that I read to you last Sunday when we got the title The the subject for our lesson it says he that uh this is out of God's only provided place of worship he had in his heart before the foundation of the world a son because he is a father but it was still in the genes of his word amen and he had created man and he had put him on free moral agency but that man fell but the great sculptor God who made man from the dust of the earth he didn't settle for that he started making man again and he starts talking about the process coming back to uh the Son of God coming back to Jesus Christ but he says it was still in the genes of his word he had a desire for that perfect son that would reflect him and was in the genes of his word amen and so we started talking about genes and genetics a little bit last time and I marveled with you I express my Marvel to you at how brother benam could pick up on things that were going on in the scientific world as they were just beginning to discover things and this whole area of genetics was opening up through the 40s into the 50s but really started making discoveries in the 50s and Beyond and brother B was able to tap that and bring that to a spiritual type that would explain us and it's marel at that amen and and so then from then on from that time on this field of genetics has exploded and it's wonderful that before the prophet left the scene because he started really dealing with the seed Gene of God the gene of God the seed of God in 1965 right before God took him away and left us with this concept so as science would explode this understanding our spiritual understanding would explode as well amen amen and so we're thankful for those things Amen in the message leadership Prophet says you are here because your name was placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before there was even a foundation of the world that's exactly right you're a gene a spiritual Gene out of your heavenly father a part of God's word amen so we know we are part of that word so in the beginning was the word we're part of that amen that's why when that logos came out of God Amen it contained all the attributes of God it was the thought of God expressed as a form of logos and you and I were in that yeah amen because that was the word and we're part of God's word amen and me we're going to look more into that and what part it was here in just a little bit but let's go back to Jeremiah now and look at Jeremiah again Jeremiah 1 verse 4 again then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee amen and before thou comest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nation amen do you think that scripture only applies to Jeremiah I mean the specifics of that I ordained you a prophet to the Nations that may not apply to you but the fact that I knew you before I formed you in the belly I knew you before I formed you in the belly amen a and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations so you mean God knew me before he formed me in the belly before amen my conception God knew me and ordain the work that I would do on this Earth absolutely amen amen because that's part of his Gene that's part of his genetics that's part of the the the thought of God that is going to unfold itself in due season but now I want to read the rest of it because the rest of it becomes to me such a lesson for us it says then said I a lord God behold I cannot speak for I am a child so don't read any further Jeremiah's response to the fact that God says I knew thee before I formed thee in the belly and before thou camest forth I I I ordained you I Sanctified you and ordained you to be a prophet to the Nations Jeremiah's response is Lord I can't do that that's his response oh that's such a healthy response but but God's going to bring a a little bit of a correction to him to correct his understanding and so what he says next is but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child for thou shal go to all that I shall send thee and who whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faes for I am with thee to deliver Thee sayith the Lord then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the Lord said unto me behold I have put my words in thy mouth amen what a lesson amen first he tells Jeremiah hey Jeremiah don't worry about this I've got this I've already ordained you before you were formed in the belly before you came forth I already Sanctified you I already ordained you to be a prophet to the Nations and Jeremiah has a very logical human response Lord there's no way that I can do what you just said and God says don't worry about that don't be afraid and don't say that amen because it's not you it's what I ordained inside of you it's me in you doing the work I will do it I will touch your mouth and I will put my words in your mouth you you don't have to come up with anything amen and this is such a good lesson for us because we've come to the time at the end of time when the veil has been taken off of the book of God off the Bible amen that's been unveiled so that we can see who we are and we realize that God had ordained us in Christ predestinated us in Christ before the foundation of the world and predestinated US unto adoption amen and give us a spirit whereby a spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father knowing who our father is and who we are that we're children and offspring of almighty God but when we look to the flesh we said God I can't live that kind of life I can't do that I'm but a child I'm not capable but God can bring that correction to our thinking and said listen no no no no you're looking at this wrong I'm not expecting you to do anything I'm just expecting you to be the vessel that I work through that what I've ordained will take place and when it comes time I'll equip you you I'll put words in your mouth I'll touch don't I I've already Sanctified I've already DED don't think up what you've got to do or how you're going to do it or conjure up an idea of how to do it that's not for you to do what is for you to do is just believe what I told you and move forward and I will be with you and I will work in you don't be afraid don't be afraid of anybody else don't be afraid to go do what I told you to do cuz I'm going to take care of it man what a good lesson for all of us brother ROM said in things that are to be I read this before but we're going to go through it again now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of God is because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God Amen now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age amen you are expressing God's life in you because you are son or daughter of God and when you can hear that and you can say the same thing that that Jeremiah said I'm but a child I can't express you to this nation well that's that's a normal response but that response actually needed a correction from the Lord it needs corrected there's nothing wrong with understanding how frail or humanity is that's not a problem that's actually a healthy thing it's good to understand that we can't do it and we're not capable and we'll never accomplish it and man's a failure to begin with those things are wonderful to understand amen but that can never be an excuse to stop us from expressing what God's on the inside amen that's no excuse because his power is sufficient his grace is sufficient for us it's not what he's asked us to do it's what he's ordained for us to do so I'm going to read that sentence again now you're expressed after his word has come into you to light up this age you're expressing God's life in you because you're a son or daughter of God therefore you get what I mean you are you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes there his attributes you had to be if you ever if you got eternal life then it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water of the word fell on you it was expressed in a being man let's turn to Acts chapter 9 together Acts chapter n verse 15 Acts chapter 9 verse1 15 but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake so this is the uh God's speaking to ananas ananas was the prophet that God was going to send Amen to pray for uh Paul Saul who would become Paul the Apostle amen was going to pray for him that his eyes would be open and he had objections because of the life that Saul lived because of the persecution but God says no listen you you're misunderstanding the whole picture you're not seeing this right you're seeing a man who's persecuting the church and Hauling them to prison and has letters from the high priest you're seeing a persecutor of the church but I see amen something else I see beyond the flesh I see what's underneath the flesh you're seeing a persecutor of the church I'm seeing a chosen vessel he said go go thy way for he is a chosen vessel to me to Bear my name before Gentiles and kings and children of Israel amen God listen God never picked Saul because Saul was doing a good job so God said you're doing a good job I'll pick you he was doing a h a horrible job he was persecuting the very thing that he was ordained to uphold he was against the very thing he was going to travel the world proclaiming so you think Paul could have any confidence in his flesh his flesh had led him the wrong way in the and with the Gospel of Jesus Christ he was against it attacking it attacking the people who carried the carried the message of the hour amen but God knew that he ordained him for a different purpose and in due time when the time was right God would come down and call him out and express to him what his purpose really is amen and then Paul would have to die to everything he ever thought before and live to this what God had told him and I could I could I probably I I bet Paul could come up with a whole list of reasons why he couldn't do it God you you chose the wrong guy you shouldn't pick me I've been a persecutor of the church I've done this I've said that I've done this hey it doesn't change anything cuz God ordained it before the foundation of the world so let's go look at the uh Galatians chapter 1 Galatians chapter 1 Galatians chapter 1:1 15 Paul the Apostle again here speaking he says in Galatians 1:15 but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his Grace so who separated Paul from his mother's womb it was God and after God has separated from his mother womb brought him on Earth at the appointed time amen Paul had lived such a life that eventually led him to persecuting of the church but God it was God who separated from his mother's womb God ordained the time that he would come on the earth and begin to express but then God also knew the time he would call him yeah amen and so he he he list both here he said but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that I might preach him among the Heathen immediately I confer not with flesh and blood and he talks about going to the Wilderness of Arabia but I love this statement I'm going to read it again I want to emphasize it but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me so what was God's purpose in Paul to reveal his son in him amen that's what God called him by his grace for that was God's purpose in Paul to reveal his son which is Christ in Paul that's what God wanted Paul to do amen let's go over to chapter 2 now verse 20 Galatians 2 and 20 I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so Paul is not even claiming to live by his own faith it's not his faith yeah because his faith had him persecuting the church right but now the life that he lives because he's died and been resurrected in Christ Jesus the life that he lives now he lives by the faith of the Son of God this is God's Own Faith this is the faith of Jesus Christ himself that's in Paul amen after Paul's conversion and his new birth he's now not living amen he's not living on the outside man he's living by the faith of the Son of God and the faith of the Son of God is expressing the Son of God because God wanted uh his son to be revealed in Paul amen so he put the faith of the Son of God in Paul to express the son of God amen so you see it wasn't Paul outer man Paul it was the gene of God that God had ordained for this expression and God supplied everything Paul would need to express what God ordained Paul to express man it's really important in the message communion brother Brenham makes this statement he's talking about as he lived life there was something in him that would stir at different times in life and he's talking about that seed that was there inside of him and he says what was it he said there was another William brandham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things it was working so it was something that he would have a pull to things or couldn't do things other kids would do and he says that was that Gene of God in him there it was always in him he said and so he says what was it he said there was another William brandham now listen I don't think it was a replica of the outer man on the inner man because the outer man was the one that came wrong it was born wrong it was born in sin it was shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and it became uh The Vessel of the Tabernacle of William brandom but I think what he's telling us is there's not another one of these down in there but there's the original version of this down in there the original one the life that God wanted to express there's another William brandom down on the inside and oh I like to think that there's another Chad Lamb down on the inside but I don't want it to be a replica of the outside man I don't want that one I want the one that was in his mind originally that he intended to be expressed that's the one that I hopes down on the inside the original one the one that he wanted to express through from the very beginning that part of his word that he designated to be me that's the other one that's down on the inside in the message Shalom he says but really frankly we have never seen each other did you know that we have never seen one another you hear something speaking out of my body here that impersonates whatever is on the inside so then when we talk to each other we're really not talking to the body it's the spirit inside but the body is the thing that identifies the spirit that's on the inside and therefore when we speak to each other quick we can understand right away whether we are Christians or not because there's a fellowship in the spirit that we talk from you see that it vibrates to one another that whether we are Christians or not therefore we have never seen each other I love that you know why I love that amen because you have never really seen me you have never really seen what makes up me what is the the the genuine me that God intended to be me which was a portion of himself that he was his word that he wanted expressed in a certain time period amen that he wanted to be me that is me and you've never really seen me yeah that Thrills me because you may have seen me do all kinds of bad things in the past amen but now I can say you never saw me brother Chad I saw you steal and I saw you lie and I saw you do this and I saw you do that and I could say praise God you've never actually really seen me you've seen an expression amen that came through this body and that old expression was from an old life but that old life died and now it's resurrected in the newness of life that original life and now that is expressing through this shell but it's something else what is it another William brandham down on the inside an invisible union he says how did you come to do this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent Eve it's not it's no fault of your own by your natural birth you come after Eve he committed adultery uh who committed adultery that's the reason you was born an adulterous you're a sinner to begin with that's right you was deceived into it you had it ain't your fault you never did it because the little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world when God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life oh I'm so thankful for that friends we were born wrong we were born Amen in sin we come through hybridization in this outer man which is our our human Spirit which is the spirit of the world in this flesh body and it and we came wrong with the wrong expression but down inside was a little portion of God that in due time he would send the washing of the water the word and the baptism of the Holy Ghost would Quicken that thing to life and that he said he said that little germ that was in you was to be you originally in God's original plan that you would get a body that wasn't hybrid that you would be born amen and and and brother Stan was expressing this on Wednesday night if we would have come according to the perfect will of God Amen we wouldn't have come through hybridization we would have come what would he have done he would have gathered however he did it I'm not saying how he would have done it I don't know amen all I know is what he did I don't know how he would have but he would have gathered these elements of the earth together amen and placed that life inside and that life would have expressed through these elements but it wouldn't come it wouldn't come with a fallen nature with a fallen spirit with the spirit of the earth it would have the right Spirit and the right expression from the very beginning and there would have been no struggle inside of me to express God Amen it would have been natural it would have been the life that was meant to be me would have been put in the right vessel with the right spirit and would have expressed God yeah but now we came the wrong way and so we have this outer man to contend with and the problem is we start looking in the mirror and start thinking that you know this is who I am oh but I want to look in the mirror of the word and find out who I really am so that gives me courage to express what God wants me to express yes sir let's go to 1 John 4:4 1 John chapter 4 this is what we ended with last time this scripture we I don't know if it was the last one but it was towards the end 1 John 44 you are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world remember we started talking about brother talked about your flesh and how we're hybrid born and come the wrong way and that flesh with its senses is the evil one that's where the world is working in our flesh but greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world and that's what we're depending on that Gene of God that wants to express and so what did God place inside of us in our soul that he would Quicken to life one day it was a portion of himself it was a portion of himself and that portion of himself amen through the baptism of the Holy Ghost came alive or came into expression amen and began to grow and express what he wanted us to express and and brother Brenham makes this statement and show us the father said uh a woman said who did he pray to In The Garden of Gethsemane on the street meet on a street meeting one time I said I want to ask you something you testify you had the Holy Ghost where is it at what do you pray to it's on the inside of you of course well we have the spirit with measure he had it without measure we are Sons and Daughters of God by measure like take a spoonful of water out of the ocean and he's the whole ocean but the same chemicals that's in the spoon is in the whole ocean right it's quantity but the same quality therefore Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever God in us amen and the message is is I be not afraid he says now if I went to the ocean and took like this little gift that he gives me if I went to the ocean and took a spoonful out of the ocean that's about in comparison this little gift here is just like a spoonful of water out of the oce and he's the whole ocean but did you know if you examine that little spot that you got in you and that little spot I got in me the same chemicals is in the Spoonful that's in the whole ocean that's wonderful that's why God is all in all but Jesus Christ was the fullness of the godhead bod he was that whole ocean of the word of the fullness of God expressed in one man right but where was I in that expression I was there brother B said because I'm part of that word so when all the ocean yeah when all the ocean amen that represents God Amen was bottled up and confined in Jesus Christ where was I I was there yeah and then when God wants to express me he'll take a little teaspoon out of that ocean amen that's why none of us can be the full expression of Jesus Christ we can't be Jesus Christ but we are part of that life and we're a portion of that and a small portion and however small the portion and however tiny you get the portion brother B said all the chemicals that's in the whole ocean is in you just a smaller quantity yeah oh praise God this is so so wonderful the reason it's so wonderful is because brother B starts talking about the SE Gene of God that's on the inside and when we look at this this whole concept of genes and the understanding of genes and genetics and DNA and all the things that were discovered Amen in the in this last century Amen in the last less than the last 100 years all that's been expressed and all that's been understood we begin to understand that what brother Brenham said is exactly the truth exactly the truth because uh well let's turn to First Corinthians and then I'll explain what's on my mind 1 Corinthians chapter 12 1 Corinthians 12: 18 but now hath God set in set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him for if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members but yet but one body let's go to verse 2 7 says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular so brother B told us that that uh all that God was he poured into Christ Jesus Christ and he was bottled and confined in that vessel Jesus Christ but all that Christ was he poured where into the church so that full life that full ocean comes into his body that's on Earth yeah but that body that's on his Earth is broken to individual members so that we are members of that body but we can't claim to be the entire body we're just a member of that body amen amen and this is what becomes really interesting in the in the study of genetics is that every cell in your body I say most every cell so we're just speaking in general terms there are cells in your body that are a little different but in general terms most every cell in your body contains a full strand of DNA amen that means everything that makes you what you are is in every single cell of your body yeah your DNA is the complete blueprint and instructions in code of your entire life amen what your blood type is is in your DNA your hair color is in your DNA amen the color of eyes in your DNA amen your skin tone in your DNA everything about your life is in your DNA you you are an expression of your DNA everything we see is an expression of your Gene your genetics your DNA but every cell every for the most part every cell in your body has the same DNA that means the little cell that's in my eye has the same DNA as the little cell that's in my toenail yeah it's in the root of my toenail same cell our same DNA right so so no part can call Another Part greater or lesser because every part has everything that's in your body is in that part yeah all the same information is not lacking anything it has everything everything that's in a brain cell is everything that's in a liver cell yeah amen the difference is there's only a certain segment of that amen there's a certain segment of that that's activated amen for for gene replication to make proteins to make whatever it's supposed to be doing so a liver cell is not supposed to be making brain cells a liver cell is supposed to be making liver cells and then liver enzymes and things that help you break down toxins in your body amen and it's got that function to do and God placed that cell in the body to serve a certain portion and that cell has everything a brain cell has but because of its position God only unlocks a certain portion of that DNA and because of its position that DNA will only replicate what's open yeah or what it's designated for so that that that same cell I mean that DNA that's in a liver cell could make a brain cell could make part of your nervous system it could make whatever whatever is needing body it could make it but because of the position it's in and its location determines what part of that information will be expressed right so what's in you what's in you amen what's in you is the very Mind Of God what's in you is you say well just a portion just a teaspoon what's in the teaspoon everything that's in the ocean is in the teaspoon right but because of its position and there's also genes that are activated by certain other factors so there's there's outside factors that affect uh uh that affect uh genetics so your body is sitting here your body is reacting to the environment all the time it's reacting it's constantly moving it's constantly working amen if all of a sudden we crank up the temperature and we get the heat really soaring in here your body is going to begin to sweat what makes your body sweat amen it's genes and the DNA amen it's acting on a certain condition and the condition condition the condition requires a response of genetics that's in a certain portion of your body goes into action to what save your body amen so there's different ways in which amen the gene is expressed in your life it's expressed amen by the position that it's in and it's expressed by the conditions that are around it amen you know what that means everything that's in any other part of the body is in you yeah everything that's in any other part of the body is in you amen that means the full potential for everything is inside of you the full potential for the full life of God the full power everything that was expressed amen is in you and God can express it anytime he wants amen amen it's not that we have to get something else from God it's already in you if if just a small portion of God is in you then everything that's in God is in that small portion and God can express anything he wants through you but there's certain positions that he's placed each one of us in and he's placed Us in that position in the body and as he put that in that position it unlocks a certain portion of Christ to be expressed in you amen expressed as a man expressed as a woman expressed as a husband expressed as a father expressed as a Young Man expressed as an old man expressed in whatever whatever position you hold there's a certain part part of that DNA that's open for expression amen amen so that's why we don't need to worry about what somebody else is doing over in some other part of the body worry about what the hands are doing or what the foot is doing because there's no way that we can be in competition with one another nor is it necessary that we all do the same thing it's certainly not necessary that we have the same gift it's certainly not necessary that we have the same position because I don't want every member in my body doing the same thing right I want certain parts of my body working all the time constantly replicating making new blood cells amen making white blood cells amen making uh nerve uh uh more more nerves in my body for my neurological system constantly refreshing the cells in my lungs and in my liver I want that doing all the time amen but the portion of the gene that decided to make my ears I only want it to work for a certain period of time and I want it to stop cuz I don't want my de ears dragging the ground as I walk along yeah but the same the same DNA that triggered my body when I was in the womb of my mother to start forming ears and as I grow amen grew my ears amen but decided they're long enough stop amen what was it that was programmed into the DNA and it happened without me thinking about it amen it happened without me directing it it was already programmed on the inside of the DNA and where it fell in the season it fell and deter mined what would be expressed yeah amen amen you know the same the same uh Gene the same gene of God that you have in you now is the same quality of the gene of God that Luther had in him praise God Amen but the season Lutheran dictated how far Luther would grow amen and the whole Lutheran age they were growing in response to the conditions around them amen and they grew in response to the season that they were in amen you plant a wheat plant in in the ground that seed has the full life everything that will ever be in that wheat is in that seed amen and you put it in the ground amen and it takes a certain condition for it to germinate amen and to begin to rot and Decay and to bring forth life and until the condition's right it just lays there and lays there and lays there and lays there but when the signals are all right amen something inside of that seed starts to move yeah amen it starts to replicate and it starts to deteriorate it starts to change things and then it comes and pokes out of the ground with a little bit of life amen and there's a certain season amen that it that it does that in amen so that it can grow at the right pace for the right season yeah amen and that's what God has done with his church yeah that's why when when the Resurrection comes and we all amen we all find ourselves in the marriage supper of the Lamb amen we're not going to be better than lutherans right amen we're not going to be better than the Luther age or the Wesley age or any other age or the Dark Age Saints amen everybody expressed what they were supposed to express in the season they were supposed to express it and they could not express anything else because if you express the wrong thing in the wrong season you'll kill the whole plant yeah amen if it germinates it comes forth before the warmth is there amen and there's another Frost the whole thing dies again it's got to be the right season the right expression and the right season and it's all baked into the DNA and it's responding to the conditions that are around it amen what moved Luther was the conditions all around him the conditions that were around him began to to move on him and God ordained it all because there was something inside of Martin Luther to be expressed and so God was changing the conditions because it now time for that seed to pop back out of the ground and bring forth that little Sprout of life and it happened in the Lutheran age cuz that was the season for it but it couldn't happen in the Hot August Sun it would have burned up and it would have never finished growing it had to come forth in the springtime and then little by little it began to come up because it was the life of God being expressed that's why there are brothers and sisters and they're not diminished in any way from you and I they can't be because they could only express the part of God that was meet and due season yeah amen and God would change the light the level of word to bring forth more growth cuz God was in control of opening the word amen shining the light and God in each season amen he would bring more light to bring more growth because it was already in the seed he would bring revelation of the word and that revelation of the word would bring a response from the inside and the Believers would grow by that Revelation and they would grow through the Lutheran age through the Wesley to the Pentecostal age and now to this age and what are we doing we're only responding to the condition of the age but what life is responding listen it's not your natural life it's not your natural life that's responding it's his life on the inside that's why oh I just I want to change if I could if I could just I wish I could just change the way I think amen I wish I wish so bad I could reprogram myself because you realize we think wrong so wrong about circumstances and situations and our body and our mind give us wrong signals all the time but the revelation of this hour come to lift us out of this condition to begin to teach us and show us amen the way we should respond to things because when things begin to happen and conditions begin to change around us amen then there's something on the inside that can respond to those conditions there's something that's naturally there like I I I gave for instance the example if we turn up the heat your body will begin to sweat that's a mechanism of protection for the body you don't have to think about it it just does all of a sudden you realize I'm sweating and I never thought about sweating it just happens how did it happen it was a response to the condition amen what did go what God God allows certain conditions in our life and we get so worried sometimes about how we'll handle this and how we'll handle that but the reality is there's something on the inside already programmed to handle the condition and God wouldn't allow the condition unless he knew it was time for another expression and we get so frustrated with the condition and we don't know what to do about the condition and we don't know what to do about the trial and why is it so hard and you don't realize that God's orchestrating everything everything's ordained of God Amen we get into the Hot August son of the wheat plant and all of a sudden it's baking everything everything's dying everything's drying out and there's no more greenness and I say why is it so hot and why is there no rain and why don't we because the seed needs to express the life of again and the life is moving into the seed God is the conditions around us are here to do what bring out that life but it's not something that comes from our brains this is the problem and this is what I I I was so uh touched and encouraged and learned so much much with brother Stan and the way he was expressing that the enemy is here this is death the carnal mind is death but the spiritual mind is life and so God has placed in us what we need to overcome in this life it's already in us he's already quickened it to life it's already there amen and it's got the it's got all the information in it amen whatever we read about in the Bible whatever's been expressed in the Bible is in you every Miracle everything everything that created that Miracle everything that created the faith it's in you but it can only be expressed in a certain season certain time under God's expression when we talk about members of the body uh we go back to this idea that every cell in your body has the same DNA amen so the the DNA in in in uh uh I actually it was it was funny I was looking up trying to understand this and make sure I understood it right I was watching a little little kids video so anyways to understand science things I watch the kids videos I don't watch the lectures on University I go and find the one for like the fifth graders and if I don't understand I go to the third graders but anyways I was somewhere in elementary school DNA and I was and I was looking at this and they were saying it was just amazing how simple it is amen but you've got cells in your eye amen that will create the the the mucus that surrounds your eye or the pigment in your eye or the uh uh optic nerve in your eye and all these things are created by cells cells are producing this and producing the proteins that create all this and they're doing it all the time but then you got you got cells in your stomach that are producing hydrochloric acid to to break down your food all right but the cell in your stomach could make eye Pig cuz it has the information it's the same DNA but because it's in your stomach it only unlock that portion to make that if it's if it's in the certain portion of your stomach to make the acid that breaks down your food but what if the cell in your eye that makes the mucus that covers your eye decided to make hydrochloric acid that wouldn't be comfortable that's what they said on the fifth grade science thing in fact it was a cartoon character with flames in his eyes and I got it I understood that but that's why we shouldn't strive to be everything and replicate every gift and try I want to be like this brother I want to be like that brother we shouldn't want to do that amen we should just want to be what God made us to be and trust that God will bring out of us what he's ordained to bring out of us because what he had for Paul is not what he had for Peter and what he had for Peter was not what he had for John he had a different work for them all to do and they had to stay in their place and just do just live that portion of God that was in them although everything that was in Paul was in John and everything was in John was in Peter and everything that was in Peter was in Mary and everything that was in in Paul who was writing out the text amen that would become the Bible that all the Believers would read everything that was in Paul is in me amen I'm not deficient amen you're not deficient none of us are def deficient in God if you're a child of God a c genene of God you're not deficient in God and that means no matter what position you hold amen you're there to express wherever he placed you will bring an expression if God Amen if God gave you children then there's something inside of you that will Express father because he's a father and if he gave you the children then there's something locked inside of you that in that position amen if we'll just trust it amen and not go with all the psychology and all the mental things and all the ideas that been traditional if we'll just trust God there's a portion of God that wants to be expressed as father and if he puts you in that position there's something in you that'll make you a good father problem is we try to replicate somebody else and we try to replicate some idea or some amen but it's already in you God's given you a gift amen he's already placed in you amen that gift and how to operate operate that we shouldn't want somebody else's gift amen we should only want to be what God's called us to be because if I try if God made me to create hydrochloric acid but I want to jump in the eyeball and right you see it's so simple but there can be such a rest if we would just allow this to be true yeah amen and stop questioning everything and why am I not and why why is this one and why and just let God do what he wants with us amen and just relax and trust that there's something in Greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world and I was thinking you think about a a mother who's in her home raising her children brother Brenham said that Mom is the Fifth Gospel and she said mom is a pastor to her children is that right well you know what the gene for pastor is in her yeah right amen just as much as the gene is in me for pastor that gift is in me that portion of God calling me to this gift the same thing is in a mother now she may not be called to stand behind the pull pit but whatever that is that's in me amen that gives me the ability to understand what's needed or to shepher to flock that same thing's in mom if she's in her position that same information's there right it can give her the answers and give her the leadership and give her the direction for these little this little flock the same thing in a father cuz he's called to be high priest of his home amen so what's what's inside of him he's got the same potential as the one who stands and preaches behind the pull pit to lead his family he may not have the same gift it may not have the same expression but that portion of God is in him and if he's got to lead and answer questions it's in him so no matter where you are in the body you've got the full DNA you got the full DNA it's all there it's either going to express according to your position or it'll begin to express according to the condition amen and it'll be doing both your body's doing both yeah right now certain things in your body are expressing because of its position and certain things in your body are expressing because of the condition there are certain things that only go into action when things change when you get a virus or you get a bacterial infection then certain parts of your body go into action and they may lay there inactive in between sicknesses which is a good thing amen but it's there it's there it's waiting and you can say well you know immune system I haven't seen much out of you lately are you still part of the body or what what have you done for me lately I don't want that part to be overactive I only want it to move when it's called on to move amen amen you know every gift is in you every gift is in you there may be one that you're called to express or more than one the spirit divided severly as will but they're all in you as part of the gene of God and God can express it any time he want remember brother Benham said a gift of Prophecy can fall on somebody one time and God will never use them again that doesn't make them a prophet or hold the office of a prophet but God can use anybody it can fall once they can prophesy or have tongues and interpretation and never again their whole life who orchestrated that God Amen so the potential listen I I hope we can understand as we walk through this life the potential is already in me if I have the life of God in Me if I've been born again if I'm a ceg genene of God then the potential is in me in everything that I will face in this life the potential to overcome is already inside of me brother Brandon made this statement in 1961 he says he said if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out there and go live a private life on it you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you got power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you you could speak a world into existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's a law of Faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours so I want to ask you a question is there enough power in you to speak another world into existence and go live a private life on it there has to be our brother B was wrong so is there enough power in you to see a vision is there enough power in you to prophesy is there enough power in you to speak in Tong is there enough power in you to lay hands on the sick am yes it's there but it's controlled by a law there's an activator Gene that'll activate that part of the genetics and in your genetics there's things called activator genes amen there's something that triggers a certain part of your DNA to replicate to go into motion to do a certain job and there's certain conditions that that have to line up and when they line up it activates this part of this Gene and that Gene begins to replicate and whatever that function is in your body begins to function Hey listen what's the activator Gene for us it's Faith whatever God can give you to believe in your soul you can have yeah amen amen that's why sometimes you can be you can be witnessing to somebody or talking to a brother or sister amen and somebody asks a question and all of a sudden you give an answer right out of the word of God that absolutely blows you away and after you've done set it it amen it's almost like you want to clap your hands over your mouth and said where did that come from what was that that was the knowledge the word of knowledge that come from God Almighty amen that was the gift of wisdom Amen to take the word and apply to the situation and that may not be your gift but in that situation God had a vessel he can use and everything that's in every other vessel is in you right so why can't he do it in you he can do it when the need is there God Can Make It manifest in you amen or there's times that you'll talk to somebody and they'll be telling you a trial or a situation or something and you'll speak a word and you don't even have a clue what you said but you'll say something like it's finished brother it's going to be over now and you walk away and say why did I say it like that why did I say that and later you hear the testimony it was exactly the way you said it guess what you can't replicate that your brain can't replicate that you can't manufacture that you can't make that happen on your own that that's God inside of you and God there's enough there there's there's enough God in you to speak a world into existence even if it's a spoonful of God right CU all the chemicals that were in the ocean are in you every gift is available to you all the fruits of the spirit all the uh all the stature of a perfect man it's all in you Amen brother Ram starts talking statue of a perfect man add to your faith virtue and virtue patience and God is going all the way up and and and the way he's saying it it's like you need to add to and add to and and then you start thinking how am I going to add to and how am I going to conjure this up but he gets to one section and he says it's either statute of a perfect man or Blasphemous names he's talking of the same subject he says you don't add nothing it adds to you amen we read this last time where he says you don't have to worry if you're a dove you don't have to worry about about feathers the feathers will take care of itself cuz he's talking about a crow putting Dove feathers in or putting peacock feathers in trying to be something that's not you don't have to be anything that you're not you only need to be what God has ordained you to be and any time at any time under any circumstance God can activate another part of his DNA and you can speak a word of knowledge a Word of Wisdom a gift can manifest and it may only be one time in your whole life but it will manifest right sometimes we get confused and be like what was that and want to replicate that you can't replicate it friends you can't manufacture it it's gone so he says this law that controls this expression says you know you got enough power in you to create another world but that that power is controlled by a law and that law is Faith and he says so whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours and remember he's not saying whatever he leads your mind to believe whatever he can lead your soul to believe a genuine Revelation in the soul amen is is the faith and we know because Romans 10 tells us that faith comes by hearing and by hearing the word of God amen amen question is so what can I do just sit around and do nothing and wait no I can't manufacture anything but what I can do is keep hearing the word keep feeding on the word you know every cell in my body is taking ingredients that I put in my body and doing work with it making it come to manifestation it's taking the food I eat and breaking it down into different substances and taking those substances and making my body and doing the functions and the work that I need to do amen may God be doing that in me as I feed on the word and give it good food good material to work with and that it begins to express because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God I need to be hearing the word of God Amen so that faith can begin to operate how many times have you while you've been sitting in a sermon or listening to brother brandham or reading a book or reading your Bible and all of a sudden you're reading or you're listening and all of a sudden the answer comes bang like that amen just comes like that and you know that's the answer you know it's over with and you know the solution is there why because God faith cometh by hearing and faith is what apprehended that power that's in you is controlled by a law of Faith amen and Faith cometh by hearing the word of God Amen brother B says uh in Christ is the mystery God revealed now notice god making itself no not we're not supposed to make coners to Christianity by a government but by the revelation Christ in you as God was in Christ as God was in Christ Christ in you so what is it that's supposed to convert others Christ in you not a government not an order but Christ in you the life goes from one to the other when what God did in Christ Christ does in you what signs did God in Christ Christ does in you oh isn't that beautiful oh my I like that Jesus said at that day that's this day at that day when this Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the father and the father in me I in you and you in me when the Revelation is made manifest at that day you shall know that I and the father are one I am in the father and the father is in me then when the Revelation comes forth then it's I in you and you in me there you are let's go to John 14 pick up a scripture that's related to this John 14:9 now Jesus in John 14:9 Jesus saith unto him have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me Phillip he that has seen me ha seen the father and how sayest thou showest the father believest now that not believest not not thou that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works in all the works that Jesus did Jesus never took credit unto himself he said it was the father that dwell in him amen and the works that he did was an expression of the father in him remember when Stan uh brother Stan on Wednesday night was talking about Jesus Jesus at the pool of Bethesda who had healing power had a gift of healing had all the gifts in in in him and and could heal multitudes I mean there was times that that every sick person they brought to him he healed them all yeah and he walks into the pool of Bethesda where there's up to thousands there that all needed healing they were all seeking healing and here he was amen the Healer himself and and he has to walk through the crowds to get to one why because because because Jesus Christ the man it wasn't him it was God in him it was the father that did the works and the father wanted to heal that one yeah and not anybody else see it's not us it's not us we're not the ones doing the works if we're doing the works we're using a different set of genes yeah right and I don't want to use those set of jeans I want it to be the genes of God working through me so there not the work works that I do it's the works that he does in me and through me that it's not me but it's Christ because I didn't know what to do and I didn't know how to do and I didn't know the right way to do it listen I I I I tell you friends that's the way it comes down to is where we get to where we don't trust ourselves we don't trust the genetics in our own flesh the only thing we can trust is greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world and he knows how to do it and he knows what needs done and he's going to be the one that has to do it Amen brother M says in the invisible Union and so and so were you sons of God and Daughters of God before there even was a Moon Star molecule you were Sons and Daughters of God for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before you don't know nothing about it neither did you did you know when you was in your Earthly father but you are manifested too in His image and the image of God you are made and you are manifested for the glory and fellowship of God and therefore as sure as your Gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual Gene had to be in God because you're an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world right no way around it that's right and now we notice that life being in you God's life being in you from the foundation of the world so that expression is not me it's him in me and go to Ephesians chapter 2 with me Ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves is the gift of God not of works that any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus un good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so God has already ordained The Works that you and I will do and it's already in the spiritual genetics of our soul and God knows how to activate it at the right time and and we don't need to worry about it it's already there he says in the book of Hebrews The Works were finished from before the foundation of the world so at no time is God being surprised that we get into a situation and all of a sudden it seems like we get into a pickle and we don't know our way out and all of a sudden God's surprised what he was going to do to solve the problem was finished before the foundation of the world yeah God already knows what he's going to do through you he already knows how he's going to do it he already knows what's in you to accomplish the deed amen we just need to get out of the way and let him do it please God help me in in the message Abraham and his seat after him from 19 61 he says now if he's infinite by his for knowledge he knew who would come to him and who would not come to him he knew who would be saved and who would not be saved that would certainly clear up Romans 88:9 for you if there's any question about God whether he calls his children by election or not for there's Paul speaking of Esau and Jacob before either child was born not even knowing what was right or wrong God said I love I love Jacob and hate Esau before either child had a way to even make a choice but God knew from the beginning what Esau was he know what Jacob was and God know in the beginning what you were and what you are not so therefore we cannot be nothing but if we cannot be like somebody else let's just be what God made us that's all we can do anything other from that would be hypocrisy we'd be a hypocrite so we do not want to be that it'd be better to be an Infidel than be a hypocrite let's be just what we are and all these things has to operate together to make the great wheels of God go on and not one thing is going wrong I'll guarantee you that everything everything has to work together every role that you play and every role that I play and every work that he's ordained us to and every position that we fill in the body of Christ it all has to work together and there can't be one cell less than another cell because it all has a portion of God right how could you say how could we think the Spoonful of God in you is inferior to the Spoonful of God in Me How can you think that the Spoonful Of God that God put in you is inferior to the spoonful he put in somebody else when every Spoonful contains the same chemicals and the same life and the same attributes but I don't have the same gifts listen all the gifts are in you amen they're there because it's part of God he can express it anytime he wants and if he doesn't want to express it why would we want to express what he doesn't want to express why would we desire a certain gift or a certain expression when that's not what he wants to express in our lives that shows that we only want to do something for self yes we want a certain gift or a certain expression and we become dissatisfied with the expression he gives us and we want a different expression because something about this expression we deem more valuable or more in the public eye or would get us more y praise all a sudden it shows the fallacy of the human mind and say you know what all I want to be is what he's called me to be I don't want to be anything more I don't want to I want to want to come up my own ideas I just want to be comfortable being a son or daughter of God I've told you this before you cannot create a better title than son or daughter of God there's not one thing that can Trump that title the greatest thing that you will ever be called in your life is a son or daughter of God Amen you can say well the greatest thing is to be a preacher the greatest thing to be a missionary the greatest thing is to be a prophet no the greatest thing to be is a son or daughter of God yeah right oh praise God that's that's the thing that gives me the most Joy is that I'm a Son of God that's the thing that gives me the most security is I'm a Son of God if he can strip me of all gifts tomorrow and I never preach again still a Son of God that's the greatest title amen that God could ever give me that's the greatest Revelation that he could ever put in my heart whether I ever operate a gift or never operate a gift or I ever do what anybody else does it doesn't matter because I'm still a Son of God and everything is in me that's in anybody else praise God brother man said in the in the message things that are to be he said May that little germ of life that that Gene of God that we just talked of the attribute that came down from God and has been manifested here to honor and glorify God Amen move the world from that he saying move the world away from that attribute don't cover it up with your flesh or worldly things but let that Express he says in perfect strength by Perfect witness how many listened to that this week after brother Stan recommended it it was a good recommendation went and listen to it as well and I enjoyed it he said this is what brother B says in that message I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William brandham he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that he's out of the way then God can come over and do things William brandom knows nothing about that's when God can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we canot praise God man that's you know the greatest enemy I got is not William Brandon the greatest enemy I got is Chad Lam this carnal mind in this flesh trying to do things trying to figure things out trying to solve my own problems and every time I do that I make a mess I say but God's Place something in me that can overcome every challenge that I face for greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world I think what we need to do is trust that life and trust that it's there amen and if we trust it I think it'll bring us more peace and if we can just relax the key to operating any gift is relaxed the whole Christian Life is based on rest that we know who we are we know God has it under control and everything I have need of is already in me brother B said every if you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost everything you have need of for life's journey is in you then and can express any time any obstacle you come to the Overcomers inside you amen every obstacle you come against the Overcomer is already in you amen and and God is able to overcome everything as he works through you and then when he does it when we have no idea what to do and we are are are are on the outside worried and nervous and don't know how to fix the problem and have no solution and God comes along supernaturally and does something then who gets all the credit you say I was lost I had no idea I was just as uh befuddled as anybody else was but God came on the scene amen and and we can't be afraid to move forward in this life because God's ordained us to the walk that we have in look at look at Jeremiah Jeremiah he told Jeremiah I knew you before I formed you before you came forth I Sanctified you and ordained you a prophet to the Nations and Jeremiah said well that's just too much I can't do it but he says don't be afraid of their faces and no don't think like that you go on and I'll put words in your mouth yeah whatever God's called you to do friends you can do it amen not because you the outside man can do it but because he's ordained it and if he's ordained it he'll Supply every need amen when you need a word of give you a word when you need healing you'll get healing when you need an answer he'll give you an answer amen you may not have it ahead of time amen Jeremiah may be going in to say something he may he may have to go down Amen to the elders and not know what he's saying till he gets there amen but when he needs to say it it'll be in his mouth yeah amen there's many times amen as we operate in what God's called us to do even operating and preaching there's many times I have absolutely no clue how to express what's on the inside of me no idea what I'm going to say or how I'm going to say it amen and there's been times I've been in the back ringing my hand saying God I do not want to go out there because in my mind nothing correlates nothing adds up there's no way I can express what I'm feeling and I don't know how to put it together and there's so many times I'll walk out here and all of a sudden under the pool of the people God takes over and it just click click click click click moves down the line and the most amazed person in the church is me that's why sometimes you have no no idea I'm having an absolute Jubilee sometimes and you don't know why the reason is I didn't know these things till now and I didn't know how these two pieces fit together until just now amen because sometimes you got to have the courage to move forward in what he's called you to do trusting that if he's in it it'll work that I don't have a preconceived idea I don't know yeah I study I study all the time I study to show myself approved a Workman that needeth not be ashamed I do what my I'm supposed to do I do what I believe God wants me to do but it doesn't matter you can study your brains out and you still have no idea sometimes what to do how to answer it what it means there have been things that I've I've put down in my notse a scripture or a quote and and there there happened several times I'll be in the back preparing say I don't know how that that doesn't fit into anything I'm going to say it's completely contrary I'm just going to get rid of it and I said I better not I'm going to delete it Go Go twice to delete it I move it around on the page it doesn't fit here doesn't fit there amen and I'll come to the pulpit and when I read that scripture bang the Revelation comes and I know exactly how it fits why it's not me it's not my brain it's not my mind amen it's a position that I hold in God Amen there's God on the inside who can bring what he needs at the right time and if God doesn't for a gift to preaching he'll do it for every one of us answers to questions witnessing uh uh uh Family Matters anything that you have need of God knows we can't be afraid to move forward and trust God you ever tried to meet somebody to witness to them because somebody wants to know more about what you believe and you're going to meet for coffee have you ever done that and you prepared everything you were going to say in your mind but Hadad you had days you meditating you had scriptures and you had all this in your mind and then you go and nothing you prepared for is the question they ask and they ask something that you have no idea how to answer has that ever happened to you all your preparations are laid waste I think it'd be so much better for us to show up and say I have no idea what to say hey what's on your mind we'll see what God will do because I didn't come here to give you my mind or my understanding I came here as an attribute of God a vessel for God to speak through and if he wants to speak to you will if he doesn't I can't control it anyways I'm not here to convince I'm not here to persuade I'm not here to use intellect to make you a believer I'm only here as a vessel that God can use to speak the word to you and if he does great and if he doesn't great yeah it's not my job listen it's not for us to use our brains and use our willpower and use all these things to get so much done for the kingdom he just wants vessels if you listen to if you listen to the message this week uh uh perfect strength and perfect weakness or by Perfect weakness you realize brother B said what he wants is emptied out vessels yeah he went to the he went to the story that Jesus told of the of the of the woman uh who whose husband was dead and she was in debt and that that her sons were going to be sold and he says what do you have in your house just a little oil and he says go borrow vessels and get empty vessels don't get full vessels or parts get empty vessels and he'll pour out and fill up the vessel he said what God needs now is not full vessels or half full he doesn't need you with all your talents and abilities what he needs is an empty vessel that he can pour himself in God help me to be an empty vessel he says in Christ is identified the same in all generations says now what is this it's a gift a gift isn't something that like a stick or a sword you cut with it cut with and things a gift is a way to get yourself out of the way you just have to get I have to get myself out of the way then the Holy Spirit takes over it isn't what you take and do something with it's a gift to get yourself out of the way then God uses you God help me to learn how to get myself out of the way and the message it is the rising of the sun Prophet says no you don't say well I hope I make it you've already made it not I will make it I've already made it I never made it he made it it for me not me him well brother bam I don't care what they say there he made it for me that's all I want all I'm caring about I just I just want to see him manifested how can you do it call him down no he's in you he's in you well then Lord if I can get myself out of the way you can manifest how can you do it because you're ordained to do so do you remember uh this past Wednesday when Stan was preaching and he was talking about praying for sister so and so and calling to a God who far away to come and do something else that you know that imagery so resonates because so many times we call on God and it feels like God's so far away especially when we get into trouble we get into difficult circumstances and places that we don't know how to solve our problems or answer the questions or it looks like we're in some sort of peril and tragedy's going to strike if God doesn't do something and we begin to call out to a god that's a million miles away because in our human emotions that's where he feels to us to be he feels to be a million miles away it feels like we're going to have to yell louder to get his attention because obviously he's not in this scene because this scene is horrific but the truth is he's still in you he's still in you he's not a million miles away he's not absent he's not he's in you he's he's he's right there the solution to the problem is right there the answer to the need is right there the genes of God the power of God the solution is right there what does he need he needs us to get out of the way and say God I'm trusting completely in you come and do what only you can do what are we going to do we want to see God manifested what are we going to do Cal him down no he's in you I want to walk to life with confidence that greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world I I want to live the way he's called us to live and I believe that's what he's calling for a bride who's intimately aware of who's inside of her and who the real Overcomer is and who the real bride is it's not this outside Guy this is the one that gets me in trouble it's the attribute of God that's down on the inside that he designated to be expressed in this way and in this hour and how am I going what what portion do I want to express well I can come up with a whole list of things that I think I should be expressing but God's actually knows what I'm supposed to express Amen in the message it is the rising of the sun I want to end with this quote in him we become part of him the Easter the revealed Secret Of God like it was then of life after death we are are now alive who were once dead in sin and trespasses the true Easter seal has broke death from around me and I'm alive the Easter seal at the beginning broke the Seal of the Roman seal the Easter seal that he was sealed up when they when they crucified Jesus Christ they put him behind the stone they closed him in the Tomb and they put a seal on it brother R it was a Roman seal and he ends up calling it the Easter seal it broke Amen on Easter morning and Christ was was resurrected and he was he was found to be alive amen but he's showing us that we have an Easter seal that we died but Christ resurrected inside of us and he says the Easter seal that he was sealed up and man when they died was gone but he broke the seal and revealed the secret and now God by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives amen many of you know the rest of theot but I'm pausing for a reason I want to read this beginning again and now God by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives so when he breaks the seal from around us what is revealed when he breaks the seal around sealing up my life what's the seal the seal is the veil that keeps me from understanding the reality it's this thing that hides God from me and hides the true understanding and true Revelation that's the seal but now the seal is broke from around our lives and what do we see when the seal is broke from around our lives and Christ is revealed as he lives in us for now we are quickened with him what did this breaking of the seals do it revealed where Christ wanted to be revealed he wanted to be revealed in Bride form and now the life that we live I'm dead I want to be dead I want to be more dead than I am I want to get this guy this enemy out of the way and I want to die to this thinking I want to be more dead than I've ever done before amen because why because I realize amen the seal that was broke is to reveal Christ the resurrected Jesus Christ where is he in me inside of me not another place not far away he's right here to do what to express himself if I can just get out of the way and die to my thinking I can let him Express himself and then the question is what are the limitations then what are the limitations I can't do that I can't do this well the truth is you can't you can't do anything I can't overcome I can't you can't do anything but the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God and if I have the Son of God the faith of the Son of God then I've got enough faith for any need not my faith his faith a gift of faith that he's given to me to operate any part of the word I can believe it and if he can move my soul to believe it then I can have it even as much as creating a whole another world Amen surely enough to overcome the obstacles that we face not by intellect but by genuine faith and now God by his grace has decided to reveal his son in US amen I'm so thankful to be part of that how can we replicate we can't what can we do nothing but just get out of the way and move the world away and let Christ Express amen amen in what form in your form yeah with what gift whatever he wants in what position wherever he's placed you right don't overthink it friends don't over complicate it just Express where you are every seed every seed every flower should bloom in the ground that's planted and wherever you are Express Christ he's going to express whereever don't wait well when I move or when I this or someday I'll be and then no no no that's not how it works he's in you now and he wants to express himself where you are and where you are and where he's placed you will cause a certain portion of his life to be manifest and then the conditions that come around you that change over time and in different pressures and different things it will unlock another portion of Christ to be expressed amen how many of you have testimonies of super Supernatural things that happen in your life am God's given you Supernatural dreams word of knowledge somebody will say something to you to answer something Supernatural happened and you know it was God come on the scene I'd like to just prope to you that most every time and I don't know each one of you and you may be able to correct me on this but most every time those most Supernatural happenings came at some of the most desperate times in your life when you needed God and nothing but God would work and when your own mind couldn't come up with a solution and you were Beyond yourself to solve any problems and what did you find when you come to the end of yourself he was more than enough and he has the answer oh let me come to the end of myself when I wake up in the morning before I get my feet on the floor let me come to the end of myself let me come to that same place where I don't have the answer I don't have the solution I don't know what to do and I have no power but then give me the courage to put my feet on the ground and move forward because he ordained me to live in this life and he ordained me to manifest him in this life and he is going to express himself in me and all I need to do is move forward with confidence that when it's time he'll touch my mouth and put words in my mouth that he'll activate something inside of me by faith and and whatever is needed amen will happen whether it's a spoken word whether it's a prayer whether it's a word of knowledge a Word of Wisdom laying hands on somebody whatever it is the potential is already in me amen I need to move forward confident that it's already in Me Not Afraid but I need to know that it's in me it's not this outside man man God bless you let's just stand I'm just going to stop there for now I want you to leave with this understanding from the the thing of genetics that we understand is every cell in your body contains everything that is you amen everything that is you is in every cell and everything that is in God is in every one of his children amen the potential where is the potential it's in my soul where is God dwelling in me where do I have to go in a time of trouble what place what location he's in me how loud do I have to scream to get his attention how how long do I have to pray before he finally shows up to answer see it's not like that friends there's got to be a confidence that says he called me he ordained me he's with me and everything I have need of is in me and all I got to do is trust in him and I just want to say all the potential is in every one of you the potential for every manifestation it's in you you you're not going to work it by your own will you're not going to say well if it's in me then I call for this and I call for that you can go ahead and try that but that's not going to work but just the confidence to know that he's never going to put me in a jam that there's not something in me that'll overcome he's never going to send me in a trial that there's not something in me that will overcome because he's ordained it before the foundation of the world it's him not me there's nothing that he's asked me to do that I have to do all I have to do is trust him and move forward he'll do it am I just got to have confidence in him and musicians if you'll come brother Ben if you'll come let's just bow our heads together dear Lord Jesus we thank you we thank you God for the understanding that you've unlock to us in this generation God we know Lord that this is the hour that you want to have a full expression of yourself in Bride form but God we know that we're not capable Lord we're not able we in our Humanity Lord we don't have within our flesh and our human Spirit what it takes but God we know that you have already supplied God you've placed a portion of yourself a seed Gene within our soul before the foundation of the world and in it Lord is the the expression that you desire God I pray that you'd help us Lord to get away from our own thinking to surrender our own ideas and our own Ambitions Lord and our own thoughts even about ourselves may we just rest in the fact that you know all things God I want to I want to move the world away from that life you placed inside of me I want to get my own thinking surrendered to you God as your Prophet called for empty vessels Lord I Want To Be An Empty vessel and I want to pour out Lord I want to pour out this morning and I realize that I'm too self-sufficient Lord Lord too often I'm trying to solve all my own problems God that's just part of the human Frailty I find myself in God I want to pour that out at your feet and I want to ask that you would take this vessel and do things with it that we've never even thought of that you would bring things out of us that we've never dreamed of that we've never imagined that we never knew were possible that we could lay down our life so that you could live your life through us I pray you would do Lord what your Prophet said you would do with a surrendered vessel and that your strength would may be made perfect in our weakness for God what you TR taught us in this generation is that you're here that you're present that you've poured out your fullness Lord into your body on this Earth and to your bride and that you have the power to express it through these vessels of clay and we're trusting in that Lord that no matter what we Face In the Future No Matter What comes down the Pik no matter what happens next that greater is you that is in us than anything that's in the world we have confidence in you may you train us and teach us how to live the life you've called us to live I pray that you bless your people that you would take us from here today and may we go Lord with confidence and with rest and with trust that you've already provided everything we have need of it's already a provision in your mind you already have finished the works from before the foundation of the world you're only asking us to trust you to take your hand to walk and to let you lead and to let you move and let you be all in all Lord I love you I ask that you take this vessel of mine take these vessels here may you accomplish your purpose in our life I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you brother Ben only to be what he wants me to be every morning moment of every [Music] day oh yielded completely to Jesus alone every step of this P way more and just to be claim in the part hand ready to do what his word come only to be one he want me to be every moment [Music] of [Music] day amen you know we have no idea what the future holds but we know some things that the prophet said and the question is when we move into whatever a squeeze is and whatever it looks like and whatever a tightening up is and whatever ever uh a politically backed religious organized persecution I have no idea I can speculate well you can speculate but it'll probably happen in ways that we never dreamed but how are we going to get through that what should we be doing now what what does your mind conjure up you know dig bunkers and hide food and that's the human way of thinking guard my resources in case they lock my bank account and but listen that's not what God wants us to do God wants us to have confidence no matter what we face it's come because he's got an expression he wants to express there was a a message I didn't look up the quote I didn't think to till just now it come to my mind but a message brother Benjamin seol preached some time ago about uh Joseph when Joseph was going through his trials he had gotten a vision you know of he was going to be exalted to a position and his brothers going to Bow then he got sold into slavery and then he got sent down to prison and all that happened to him and I didn't find the quote but I'm just going by memory where brother Benjamin told us that when something happened that was bad or or challenging Joseph would say God what part of the vision are you wanting to express now you remember that I may have the words a little wrong but what part of the vision are you wanting to express now I said oh what a perspective amen what a perspective when we hit life's trials and difficulties if we could just say God what part of your nature are you trying to express now not what I think should be expressed I sometimes I think the lion should come on the scene when God wants the lamb I think the lion should be there when God wants a sacrificial Ox yeah amen I think it should be the eagle who screams out amen from from Revelation and calls but maybe God wants an ox expression maybe a lion maybe the man maybe instead of me determining what should be respons maybe we should just say God what part of your life do you want to express today why is all this happening he said say why is all this happening to me God don't you know what's happening to me well of course he knows what's happening to you of course he knows where you're at and of course he knows the circumstances and situations instead of looking at it why God why all of this what's going wrong why not just say God what is it you're trying to accomplish today here I am an empty vessel do through me what you want to do with this circumstance because God brought a condition so that the genes on the inside would have an expression part of his nature part of his life it may be absolutely amazing and Supernatural and blow you away it may be as simple as submitting yourself and allowing your flesh to be destroyed both of those are expressions of the Life of Christ to speak a word to speak to the storm or to surrender to the beating it's not us to decide which portion it's him if we could just say like Joseph said what part of the vision what part of the word are you trying to express to me now God help me to stay tuned in and not interject my own thinking but just let you express through me and Friends there's a reality to this that God will do in you what he wants to do if we'll just get our own thinking out of the way what gives us problems is our mind but there's already a solution on the inside the genes are already there to overcome oh let the circumstance bring expression because that's the purpose anyways say oh God let me have Joseph's attitude not I was wrong my vision was wrong I thought I was bride I thought I was a Son of God I must have been wrong no what God what is that you're trying to express now have your expression here amen let's sing this song again again God bless you only to be one he wants me to be every moment of [Music] day yield it completely do you Jesus alone every step of this P way oh just to be claim in the part hands ready to do what his word come only to be one he wants me to be every moment of every day oh let's sing it again oh oh yes only to be one he wants me to be every moment of every day oh yield it completely to Jesus alone every step of this bu [Laughter] way oh just to be claim in the part hand ready to do what is worth come only to be one he wants me to be every moment of every [Music] F Well I want God's way to be my way as I Journey here below for there is no other Highway that a child of God should go home and though the road be Steep and rough if he leads me to enough I want God's way to be my way every oh I want God's way now for I want God way to be my way as I Journey here [Music] below for there is no other Highway than a child of God should go and those who R me keep be up if he leads me Des I want God's way to be my way every day
