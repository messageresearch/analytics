TRANSCRIPT
========================================
put on the whole armor of God. They may be able to stand against the ws of the devil because we're not wrestling with flesh and blood. He's saying, "Listen, I'm leaving you with this. You're headed for a spiritual battle. You're going to fight every day of your life to inherit the fullness of this promise." &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you've stepped into the millennium yet. There's still fighting. There's still war going on. There's still things to conquer. There's still places to overcome in our own lives. Amen. There's still promises that we want to see manifest amongst us in our own lives. Amen. But in order to do that, you're going to have to take on the mentality of a warrior and not get lazy cuz that's what happened to Israel. Israel stopped fighting and started farming. Amen. They stopped fighting and moved to the pleasures of their inheritance and stopped pressing for the fullness of the inheritance. &gt;&gt; So what does it denote? He leaves him with these instructions. Get your armor on. Put your shoes on, strap your belt on, get your sword in your head, and be praying all the time. Amen. Because this is not a physical thing. That's not a physical inheritance. It's a spiritual inheritance. It's a promise that he's given us. And what is the bride? She's the New Testament. That's all. So, whatever is in this New Testament is for us. Every promise is given to us by the Holy Ghost, by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, his blood purchased for us. everything his his his life returned to us to give us the power to possess all. Amen. Let's keep moving forward. Be a soldier. Don't be lazy. Don't start settling down and establishing ourselves and making wine and having feast. Let's keep moving forward and let let's move until we get the fullness of the inheritance in our possession. &gt;&gt; And what's the fullness of the inheritance? A new body. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to be happy till I get a new body. Why? Cuz it's my promise for this age. And I'm not going to stop pressing. I'm not going to start taking my inheritance and living in my inheritance. Amen. and staying separated from the world and staying consecrated to God and loving him above all and keeping my mind and my heart and my body focused on him and keep myself under preparation of battle all the time because this inheritance in order to fully possess it is going to require a fight. &gt;&gt; But praise God, he equipped us for the fight. Remember, Ephesians parallels Joshua. And Joshua says, "Go take the land. You fight. I'll be with you. &gt;&gt; I'll fight for you. I'll drive them out. You go fight." &gt;&gt; It wasn't sitting back on their heels twiddling their thumbs while God drove them out. No. God says, "I'll fight for you when you're fighting. &gt;&gt; I'll drive them out when you're driving them out." Amen. And God will do the same thing for you and I, friends. When we're pushing against the devil, he'll push the devil out of the way. Amen. When we're taking the sword of the spirit with a strong hand of faith and driving through the heart of the enemy, he'll get behind us by the power of the Holy Ghost and push that sword forward. But we got to put on the full armor and be a warrior in this battle because Ephesians parallels Joshua.
