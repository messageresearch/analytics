[3:40] minute and then we'll stand and pray
[3:41] together
[3:43] i just wanted to let you know that i
[3:46] received word today that brother tim
[3:48] pruitt's wife sister karen
[3:50] passed away this morning
[3:53] and so i know that such a tragic loss
[3:57] for the church there for the family and
[3:59] for brother tim i'd just like to bring
[4:01] that to your attention and i'd like to
[4:02] pray together as an assembly
[4:04] for their assembly for the pruitt family
[4:06] and for brother tim pruitt especially
[4:09] because i can only imagine what they're
[4:10] going through right now and the struggle
[4:12] that they're going through and i also
[4:14] wanted to let you know that
[4:15] this past monday brother tommy ernst
[4:18] passed away of covid
[4:20] and some of you might remember brother
[4:22] tommy he's preached here before
[4:24] he's been around for a long time he was
[4:26] out in wichita kansas
[4:28] been out there for quite a while but
[4:30] he's left his wife
[4:31] and children behind so there's a lot of
[4:34] difficult things going on right now
[4:37] i think they're planning on having the
[4:38] funeral for
[4:41] brother karen on our sister karen on
[4:43] sunday
[4:44] i don't know about brother tommy ernst
[4:46] but i know this saturday also will be
[4:47] the funeral
[4:48] for brother stephen francis so there's a
[4:51] lot happening a lot of difficult things
[4:53] going on
[4:54] and there's a it looks like a weakening
[4:56] overall but never forget that god's
[4:59] strength is made perfect in weakness
[5:01] and when i am weak then am i strong
[5:06] these are the times for faith to rise to
[5:08] the occasion
[5:09] we know that in happy valley now they're
[5:11] having a real tragedy with a covert
[5:13] outbreak
[5:14] i've heard somewhere as of a hundred or
[5:16] more people had coveted and 11 are in
[5:18] the hospital
[5:20] if i've got those numbers right so the
[5:22] bride around the world
[5:23] needs to stick together and pray for one
[5:26] another
[5:27] now more than ever and pray that lord
[5:29] will just
[5:30] confirm his word in our lives and that
[5:33] god will lift up each one and strengthen
[5:35] each one
[5:35] who's going through difficult times amen
[5:38] i remember brother branham said
[5:40] you've got to crush a rose to get the
[5:42] fragrance out of it
[5:44] and it seems like now is a squeezing
[5:46] crushing pressuring time
[5:48] for many all around but may the
[5:51] fragrance of the holy
[5:52] ghost be a sweet savor to his nostrils
[5:55] may we conduct ourselves as children
[5:57] amidst all of these trials
[5:59] so i'd like to stand together and pray
[6:01] together
[6:02] as an assembly for these needs someone

[7:57] have a funeral coming up this saturday a
[7:59] memorial service for brother stephen
[8:01] be with them and help them and comfort
[8:03] them in this time
[8:05] and lord so many more who maybe the
[8:07] names we don't know and we haven't heard
[8:10] but god we're just praying for every
[8:11] family that's lost a loved one for every
[8:13] church that's lost
[8:15] one of their members lord that you would
[8:17] come and that you would provide comfort
[8:19] peace let your love envelop them and let
[8:22] them know that all is well
[8:24] and everything's okay and that you're in
[8:26] control
[8:27] and that all these things will work
[8:29] together for your good
[8:30] we love you father we ask god as we take
[8:33] this word
[8:34] your precious word this evening and read
[8:36] it i pray that you would break the bread
[8:37] of life
[8:38] give us eyes to sea and ears to hear for
[8:41] we who remain on this earth of your seed
[8:44] we want to boldly proclaim this message
[8:46] to the last breath that we have in our
[8:48] bodies
[8:49] we want to stand for this word despite
[8:51] what's going on around us lord
[8:52] despite difficulties and weaknesses and
[8:55] tragedies
[8:56] lord your word yet remains true and our
[8:59] faith is just as anchored as it ever was
[9:01] we pray god that you'd be glorified in
[9:04] the preaching of your word and you'd be
[9:05] magnified
[9:06] and may always say and do bring glory
[9:08] into your name
[9:10] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[9:14] and while you're standing let's take a
[9:15] look in ephesians chapter six
[9:19] and we'll start there and i want to
[9:21] continue on with a thought that came
[9:23] out of sunday's thought we were
[9:25] preaching on reconciling heaven and
[9:27] earth
[9:28] and i'd like to take for a title for a
[9:30] subject tonight
[9:31] moving the heavenlies from earth moving
[9:34] the heavenlies from earth
[9:36] and if we could look at ephesians
[9:39] chapter 6
[9:40] and begin reading at verse 10
[9:46] finally my brethren be strong in the
[9:48] lord and in the power of his might
[9:51] put on the whole armor of god that you
[9:52] may be able to stand against the wiles
[9:54] of the devil
[9:55] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[9:57] blood but against principalities against
[9:59] powers
[10:00] against the rulers of the darkness of
[10:02] this world against spiritual wickedness
[10:04] in high places and we remind you that
[10:08] that word high
[10:09] is interpreted elsewhere in the bible as
[10:11] heavenly or heavens
[10:13] or heavenlies so this is spiritual
[10:15] wickedness
[10:16] in heavenly places this is not talking
[10:19] about government heads in washington dc
[10:22] and that's not what this is talking
[10:23] about i mean this isn't the high places
[10:25] it's talking about
[10:26] it's actually we're at warfare we're at
[10:28] a spiritual battle
[10:29] warring against principalities and
[10:31] powers in the heavenlies
[10:35] in high places verse 13 wherefore take
[10:38] unto you the whole armor of god that you
[10:39] may be able to withstand
[10:41] in the evil day and having done all to
[10:44] having done all to stand stand therefore
[10:46] having your loins girt about with the
[10:48] truth
[10:48] and having on the breastplate of
[10:50] righteousness and your feet shod with
[10:52] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[10:55] above all taking the shield of faith
[10:56] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[10:58] all the fiery darts of the wicked
[11:00] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[11:02] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[11:04] god
[11:05] praying always with all prayer and
[11:07] supplication in the spirit
[11:09] and watching there unto with all
[11:11] perseverance
[11:12] and supplication for all saints
[11:15] amen may god bless the reading of his
[11:17] word as you're seated
[11:19] keep your place here i just want to pull
[11:21] out and highlight a few things here
[11:23] when we go through this we see brother
[11:25] venom told us he said if we look at the
[11:28] weapons of our warfare and all the armor
[11:30] that's given to the believer
[11:32] he said there's not one thing that's
[11:34] physical
[11:35] because this is not a physical battle
[11:37] we're not in
[11:38] involved in physical warfare or a
[11:40] physical battle amen this is spiritual
[11:43] we're not fighting things we see
[11:45] but we are fighting against forces and
[11:47] things that we don't see
[11:48] we're fighting against principalities
[11:50] and powers in
[11:52] heavenly places so the the battle
[11:55] armament were given and the weapons were
[11:57] given
[11:57] are spiritual so we have to understand
[12:01] where we're at and when we go to a
[12:03] natural battle on the earth we've
[12:05] already missed what's going on amen
[12:07] we're
[12:08] being deceived and we're being duped in
[12:09] some carnal thing that we're
[12:11] fighting or sorting out amen we've we've
[12:14] already fallen prey we've already fallen
[12:16] into the trap we've already taken the
[12:18] devil's bait
[12:19] but we must always look beyond the
[12:20] natural and look at the spirit that's
[12:22] behind it
[12:22] and we need to fight that spirit with
[12:24] the sword of the spirit which is the
[12:26] word of god
[12:27] now if you look at this armor that's
[12:29] been given to us
[12:31] he says here taken to you in verse 13
[12:33] the whole armor of god that you may be
[12:35] able to withstand in the evil day
[12:37] and having done all to stand stand there
[12:39] for having your
[12:40] loins gert about with truth so when we
[12:43] look at this we're going to look at
[12:44] these pieces of armor
[12:45] and we find that traditionally when we
[12:47] look through this it looks like there's
[12:48] 6 but we know
[12:49] 6 is man's number but seven is the
[12:52] number of completion
[12:53] so there's a seventh weapon that's given
[12:55] a seventh piece of armament
[12:58] and we wanna look at that and that's the
[12:59] one i wanna focus on today
[13:01] so first there's the loins gird about
[13:03] with truth that's one breastplate of
[13:05] righteousness 2
[13:06] feet shot with the preparation of the
[13:07] gospel piece 3
[13:09] the shield of faith that's four amen the
[13:12] helmet of salvation that's five
[13:14] the sword of the spirit which is the
[13:15] word of god six so where's the seventh
[13:18] is in verse 18
[13:19] praying always with all prayer and
[13:21] supplication
[13:22] in the spirit amen this isn't just
[13:25] repeating words this isn't a prayer book
[13:27] this isn't a five minutes i've got to do
[13:29] this before i eat my meal
[13:31] but this is praying with all
[13:33] supplication
[13:34] in the spirit amen this is another
[13:36] weapon that we have
[13:38] and watching there unto with all
[13:40] perseverance
[13:41] and supplication for all saints we're
[13:44] supposed to be supplicating or
[13:45] interceding
[13:46] for all saints this is part of what
[13:49] we're here for and part of what we're
[13:50] here to do
[13:51] so prayer amen is an important part of
[13:54] what we do
[13:56] let's turn to matthew chapter 9 and look
[13:59] at a couple more scriptures
[14:02] i do not intend to go very fast i want
[14:04] to take time and look at these
[14:06] scriptures so
[14:07] we'll just move along and take it as a
[14:09] bible study
[14:10] this evening matthew chapter 9 verse 35.
[14:14] now when i say bible study it doesn't
[14:15] mean you're not supposed to say amen
[14:18] amen this we want an amending bible
[14:22] study amen
[14:23] matthew chapter 9 verse 35.
[14:30] and jesus went about all the cities and
[14:32] villages teaching in their synagogues
[14:34] and preaching the gospel
[14:35] of the kingdom and healing every
[14:37] sickness and every disease among the
[14:39] people
[14:40] but when he saw the multitudes he was
[14:42] moved with compassion on them
[14:44] because they fainted and were scattered
[14:45] abroad as sheep having no shepherd
[14:48] then saith he unto his disciples the
[14:50] harvest truly is plenteous
[14:51] but the laborers are few pray ye
[14:54] therefore the lord of the harvest that
[14:55] he will send forth laborers
[14:58] into the harvest brother brahm discusses
[15:00] the scripture and we
[15:01] quoted this quote la sunday but i want
[15:03] to read it again
[15:04] from the message the new minister my new
[15:06] ministry says
[15:07] now you say well if he knows it then why
[15:10] are you preaching
[15:12] that's part of god's program preaching
[15:14] is his program
[15:15] when he looked upon the apostles he
[15:16] looked upon the harvest he said the
[15:18] harvest is right
[15:19] and the laborers are few pray the lord
[15:21] of the harvest that he will send
[15:23] laborers into his harvest
[15:25] how many remembers that well why would
[15:27] they have to pray
[15:28] to the lord of the harvest to send
[15:30] laborers into the harvest
[15:31] if the lord of the harvest was standing
[15:33] there knowing it would be done
[15:35] why god has so arranged it that now
[15:38] listen to this god has so arranged it
[15:40] that his program
[15:41] cannot move without you and i
[15:45] lock into that friends he told his
[15:47] disciples
[15:48] he's standing there and he's talking
[15:49] about multitudes and the sickness and
[15:51] the need
[15:52] amen of the people and he says and he
[15:54] looks over them with compassion and he
[15:56] says to us
[15:56] who his disciples now here he is the
[15:58] lord of the harvest
[16:00] looking out and noticing amen with
[16:02] compassion the need of the people
[16:04] and he says to the disciples pray to the
[16:06] lord of the harvest that he'll send
[16:08] laborers into the harvest
[16:09] and brother branham said he was the lord
[16:11] of the harvest he was the one who saw
[16:13] the condition and knew they needed it
[16:15] amen but why did he tell them to pray
[16:18] because god has so arranged it that he
[16:20] cannot do anything without you and i
[16:22] god has put himself on partnership with
[16:24] man and he needs these disciples to pray
[16:27] to him
[16:28] so that he can move and send laborers
[16:29] into the into the field
[16:32] and we think you know god's going to do
[16:34] everything god's got everything under
[16:35] control and god's going to do everything
[16:37] we miss the program of god when we go
[16:40] that way we miss the fact
[16:41] that god has so set his program he says
[16:44] it this way
[16:45] amen back in this quote god is so
[16:47] arranged that his program
[16:49] cannot move without you and i it's his
[16:52] program
[16:53] it's his plan it's by predestination
[16:55] it's by foreign knowledge
[16:57] he knows what will happen but he had to
[16:59] get us here
[17:00] amen and he's got to get us here with
[17:02] free moral agency but with a nature and
[17:04] a character
[17:05] in us that will take that word and see
[17:07] the situation
[17:08] and speak and pray the word in this
[17:10] situation
[17:11] and god can move on that prayer because
[17:14] it's according to the word and it's by
[17:15] faith
[17:17] he has to have somebody on the earth
[17:20] that that will see
[17:21] amen that will catch inspiration that
[17:23] can pray in the spirit by faith
[17:25] and pray the word so that he can begin
[17:28] to put the word into motion
[17:30] so we get the we get to sometimes
[17:33] you know we act like we're little
[17:35] toddlers and toddlers you know
[17:37] you know just expect mom and dad to do
[17:39] everything they'll pour the cereal
[17:40] they'll pour the milk they'll hand you
[17:42] the spoon they'll even sometimes stick
[17:43] it in your mouth and take the napkin and
[17:45] wipe it off
[17:46] but god wants us to mature because he's
[17:48] put us on partnership with him
[17:50] and he wants us to get to a place where
[17:52] we begin to act like he would act on
[17:54] this earth
[17:54] and by being on this earth and acting
[17:56] the way he would act
[17:58] and fulfilling the word and praying amen
[18:01] and calling out to god to move in
[18:02] situations
[18:03] amen it activates the heavenly realm and
[18:06] the heavenly realm gets into action
[18:08] according to the word
[18:09] and puts the word into action
[18:14] see the other is extreme calvinism and
[18:16] brother venom was against extreme
[18:18] calvinism
[18:19] where everything's all planned out
[18:20] there's no need in preaching you don't
[18:22] need to do missionary work
[18:23] everything that's going to be saved is
[18:24] going to be saved and they took a truth
[18:26] and they went too far on a truth
[18:29] and armenianism did the same thing but
[18:31] brother branham was able to bring them
[18:32] together
[18:33] and say yes god has a plan god has
[18:35] foreign knowledge
[18:36] and in his foreknowledge he's called an
[18:38] earthly vessel and that earthly vessel
[18:40] amen is going to be on
[18:42] earth at the right time to see the right
[18:44] thing to have the right faith
[18:46] to catch the right inspiration to speak
[18:48] the right words
[18:49] amen so that predestinated plan of god
[18:51] will go into action
[18:53] because he's got children on the earth
[18:55] amen that represent
[18:56] him and have caught his mind and when
[18:59] they catch his mind
[19:00] they begin to call out in prayer and in
[19:02] supplication
[19:03] amen and god says that's just what i've
[19:06] been waiting for
[19:09] puts him into motion
[19:12] if not we sit back and become so
[19:15] complacent and
[19:16] and we have situations and when you say
[19:18] well if god wants it this way that's the
[19:20] way it's going to be
[19:21] maybe god doesn't want it that way maybe
[19:23] god's trying to put a little pressure on
[19:25] us
[19:25] so that we'll take the word and stand up
[19:27] and say god this is not according to
[19:28] your word
[19:29] but you've laid a promise in this word
[19:31] and i'm praying god that you'll bring
[19:33] that promise to pass
[19:34] maybe that's what he's waiting for and
[19:36] we're sitting here waiting
[19:38] oh god you know you know all things if
[19:40] you want me to be happy you'll make me
[19:41] happy
[19:44] if you want me to be healed i'll be
[19:45] healed if you want me no
[19:47] he's wanting you to say god you told me
[19:49] you would heal me lord
[19:50] and there's an affliction upon me and
[19:52] i'm calling out to you
[19:53] to keep your word in my body god there's
[19:56] this situation
[19:58] amen in the church there's a situation
[20:00] in the world amen we need you to move on
[20:02] this situation so that we can keep going
[20:04] forward in the word
[20:07] and god says that's just what i was
[20:08] waiting for
[20:10] i was waiting amen for one of my agents
[20:13] i was waiting amen for one of my
[20:15] partners
[20:17] to call me on the scene
[20:22] amen
[20:26] he says i'll finish this quote so
[20:28] arrange it that his program cannot move
[20:30] without you and i
[20:30] and as long as we're not doing what god
[20:32] leads us to do we are
[20:34] paralyzing his program but when the
[20:36] church moves by the anointing of the
[20:38] holy ghost
[20:38] then we are in god's will doing his
[20:42] program
[20:46] i want to look i've quoted this it's
[20:47] been quoted brother kyle read it so
[20:49] several weeks ago i've quoted it several
[20:52] times
[20:53] and this uh this uh uh
[20:56] tongues and interpretation that came uh
[20:59] from danny henry over brother branham
[21:01] and i just want to read
[21:02] it and i want you to just catch it we've
[21:03] been talking about it quite a bit but
[21:05] i just i really want to read it and this
[21:07] is out of the message birth pains
[21:10] and he's referring to this he said i
[21:12] would like to read this note
[21:13] this is the original note of one of them
[21:16] and it was from this man that was
[21:17] interpreted
[21:18] i may not be able to call his name just
[21:20] right ladue victor ledoux he's a
[21:22] full-blooded frenchman now
[21:23] here's the message now this is uh danny
[21:27] henry went and wrapped his arms around
[21:28] brother branham and said brother branham
[21:29] if that's not
[21:30] sacrilegious that could be the the 22nd
[21:32] or 23rd chapter of revelations whatever
[21:34] he said there
[21:35] and then he began to speak in french
[21:37] amen and then there was three people
[21:39] there that gave the interpretation one
[21:40] was victor ledoux
[21:41] one was a woman from new orleans who
[21:44] knew french and one was an interpreter
[21:46] for the united nations and they all
[21:47] wrote down their notes they all brought
[21:48] them together and they all matched
[21:50] exactly
[21:51] and this is what was said because thou
[21:54] has chosen the narrow path
[21:56] the harder way thou has walked of your
[21:59] own choosing
[22:00] thou has picked the correct and precise
[22:02] decision
[22:04] and it is my way and listen
[22:07] my brother branham had to make a
[22:09] decision he had to make a choice
[22:11] and he chose to go the narrow path he
[22:13] chose to go the harder way
[22:15] amen but it was the predestinated will
[22:18] of god that god by
[22:20] foreknowledge knew that he would take
[22:21] this will but god never forced him to
[22:24] take this
[22:24] god put him on free moral agency because
[22:27] god's got a partnership with man
[22:28] and he needed that prophet to make this
[22:31] choice
[22:33] i'm telling you he needed that prophet
[22:35] to make this church
[22:36] there's a battle going on that started
[22:38] way way way back before there was a
[22:40] molecule
[22:40] or speck of stardust or an atom or
[22:43] anything before there was anything there
[22:45] was war that broke out in sin that began
[22:47] in heaven with the rebellion of lucifer
[22:49] and that war has spilled down into this
[22:51] realm amen
[22:53] and somehow with that battle in place
[22:56] god is still
[22:56] operating by his law he is still
[22:58] operating by his rules
[23:00] god will not break his own rules to
[23:02] defeat lucifer
[23:05] god has integrity god is a god of
[23:07] justice and a god of truth
[23:09] amen and if he drew lines he will always
[23:11] color within the lines
[23:14] do you understand you're not going to
[23:16] make god unjust and you're going to
[23:18] make god lose his integrity so god has
[23:21] set up laws and god has set up
[23:23] a plan and i'm speaking things that i
[23:26] don't fully comprehend but things that i
[23:28] understand in the spirit
[23:29] that there's a way that god operates and
[23:31] god cannot violate his own law
[23:33] and one of god's laws is free moral
[23:35] agency and he cannot
[23:36] violate the law of free moral agency
[23:40] or free choice so he cannot make you do
[23:42] something
[23:43] amen and somehow there's rules of
[23:45] engagement
[23:47] i know this this may sound crazy but
[23:50] it's just the way it is friends
[23:51] there's spiritual rules of engagement in
[23:53] this battle amen
[23:54] and the battle place is now the the the
[23:57] mutual meeting ground
[23:58] how do you know there's rules of
[23:59] engagement because brother venom told us
[24:01] in the greatest battle ever fought
[24:02] these two forces got together and they
[24:04] had to decide on where the meeting
[24:06] ground was going to be where they fought
[24:08] so they they had some rules
[24:12] they made a decision amen they chose
[24:14] together
[24:15] amen where the meeting place would be
[24:18] for these two forces to test their
[24:19] strength
[24:20] and that would be in the mind of man
[24:21] amen and you wonder why you're having
[24:23] mental battles
[24:24] it's explainable amen it goes all the
[24:26] way back to the war that was in heaven
[24:31] and because they've decided where
[24:33] they're going to face off and test their
[24:35] strength
[24:37] amen the battle is over the word of god
[24:40] lucifer is trying to defeat the word of
[24:42] god
[24:44] so he's he's attacking and fighting and
[24:47] tearing down the word
[24:48] it's a battle between lucifer and the
[24:50] word
[24:53] and there's certain rules though there's
[24:55] a rule for uh brother i said there's
[24:57] an unwritten rule of free choosing free
[24:59] moral agency
[25:01] you have a right to make your choice and
[25:03] god will not violate that
[25:05] because somehow if he violates that he's
[25:07] no longer playing by the rules
[25:11] so when god sent a prophet here
[25:14] brother braham said i could go sit on
[25:17] the bank of the river and fish every day
[25:18] of my life and still be saved
[25:20] he knew who he was he knew he was a
[25:22] child of god and he wasn't going to be
[25:23] lost
[25:24] but yet the program of god wouldn't move
[25:26] forward if he went and sat on the bank
[25:28] of the river and fished the rest of his
[25:29] life
[25:31] and you say well he could have done it
[25:32] he said he could have done it so he
[25:34] could have done it
[25:34] but he didn't do it so you can say well
[25:36] what if he would have done it would he
[25:37] raise up no he would have never raised
[25:39] anybody else up there's one
[25:40] predestinated vessel
[25:42] that's why when moses left his
[25:44] commission amen and he tried to save the
[25:47] the uh tried to save the israelites and
[25:49] killed one egyptian and run off to the
[25:51] wilderness
[25:51] god couldn't say well i'm done with him
[25:53] i'll get the next willing vessel
[25:55] no he was a predestinated vessel he
[25:58] couldn't get anybody
[25:59] else but he had to get that man to align
[26:01] with his will
[26:03] amen that's why when god would go and
[26:05] beat all of moses out of moses amen
[26:07] he would give him a hot tempered wife
[26:09] what was he doing he was trying to get
[26:10] him in condition where the free choice
[26:12] will match god's choice
[26:16] put him on the backside of the desert
[26:18] amen away from i mean you know how moses
[26:21] grew up
[26:21] and the way moses grew up compared to
[26:23] what moses went to
[26:25] an exile what is it god is trying to
[26:27] humble him god's going to abase him amen
[26:30] amen then he gives him a hot tempered
[26:32] wife
[26:34] i'm so glad the prophet said things like
[26:36] that
[26:38] what was he trying to do he was molding
[26:40] that character
[26:41] so when he got when he got moses all
[26:44] beat down
[26:45] and moses humbled amen now he's going to
[26:47] come to him in a burning bush
[26:49] now listen god can't make moses
[26:52] do anything moses has to choose
[26:57] by free moral agency but god's finally
[27:00] got him to a place
[27:02] where moses has no confidence in himself
[27:04] amen he's totally beat down
[27:06] god comes to him in a burning bush and
[27:08] god knows exactly how to get our
[27:10] attention
[27:12] and he brings him up and he begins to
[27:14] give him a commission
[27:15] and now he's done such a good job of
[27:18] beating all of moses out of moses
[27:20] moses says i can't do it god send
[27:22] somebody else and he begins to argue
[27:23] with god until god becomes
[27:25] angry with him god did a good job
[27:31] but he could never force moses
[27:34] if you look at the argument between god
[27:36] and moses
[27:38] god never god says i'm sending you now
[27:40] go down he says no i can't do it
[27:42] he says i can't speak he says well i'll
[27:44] give you aaron your brother to be your
[27:45] prophet okay he'll speak for you
[27:47] and this and making excuses and god is
[27:50] working with moses
[27:53] because he's got to get moses to make
[27:56] the choice
[27:58] moses has to go of his own choosing
[28:03] but when moses goes
[28:06] it is god's way and it is god's choice
[28:12] it was the way god saw in his mind
[28:14] before the foundation of the world amen
[28:16] but it still had to be
[28:18] by free choice he couldn't be forced
[28:20] into it although it was already god's
[28:22] plan
[28:22] but god would put a seed down inside of
[28:24] him with a certain nature
[28:26] that could respond to certain things and
[28:28] god knows how to get that seed to
[28:30] respond
[28:33] and so as that seed would begin to
[28:34] respond amen moses would now make his
[28:37] choice and he would say i'll go and so
[28:40] then he goes
[28:42] and now back to this quote thou
[28:45] has chosen the narrow path the harder
[28:47] way that was walked of your own choosing
[28:50] you didn't go fish on the bank of the
[28:54] river the rest of your life
[28:55] enjoying your salvation amen but you
[28:58] made a choice
[28:59] to go the narrow path you made a choice
[29:01] to go the harder way
[29:02] and he says you you have and thou has
[29:06] walked of your own choosing
[29:09] amen this is super critical friends
[29:12] because we always we god gives us a
[29:14] choice amen
[29:16] we have a choice to make and we can go
[29:18] the narrow way
[29:19] or we can try to take the easy way amen
[29:21] and man is
[29:22] always trying to take the easy way and
[29:24] they want to serve god in this message
[29:26] the easy way
[29:28] and it's not going to work amen it
[29:31] absolutely won't work
[29:33] god will let you stumble stub your toe
[29:36] bust your nose
[29:37] amen your life fall to peace all kinds
[29:39] of stuff will go wrong
[29:40] until you finally of your own choosing
[29:42] decide to go the narrow way
[29:44] the harder path and if you go that way
[29:48] you'll goal of your own choosing
[29:51] not by force
[29:56] thou has walked of your own choosing
[29:59] thou
[29:59] has picked the correct and precise
[30:02] decision and it is
[30:05] my way now listen
[30:09] thou has picked yes the correct
[30:12] you picked
[30:15] did brother branham pick or did god pick
[30:19] i mean which came first brother
[30:21] branham's choice or god's foreknowledge
[30:24] it was god's foreknowledge but it was
[30:26] brother bam's choice
[30:28] the two have to come together word has
[30:31] to come to word
[30:32] life has to come to life two omnipotents
[30:34] have to meet
[30:36] two these two aspects of the word of god
[30:39] amen the foreknowledge
[30:40] the word amen the four known word of god
[30:44] and the manifested word of god have to
[30:46] come to the same place
[30:47] and when they come to the same place it
[30:49] moves god's program down the road
[30:51] but when they're out of kilter the
[30:53] program's not moving amen
[30:55] when the word from before the foundation
[30:57] of the world amen in the
[30:58] and the manifested word in this day are
[31:00] not lined up the program's not going
[31:02] anywhere
[31:03] but when they start to line up together
[31:05] then the program moves down the road
[31:08] and it's up to us to make the choice to
[31:10] choose the word amen
[31:14] he says you pick the correct and precise
[31:16] decision
[31:17] and it is my way so if it's god's way
[31:20] it's not a new way it's not a way that
[31:23] adjusted to brother branham's way
[31:24] if he says it is my way it was his way
[31:27] before there was a speck of stardust
[31:33] now listen what comes next because
[31:37] of this momentous decision
[31:41] because of your choice
[31:45] think about this friends because
[31:48] of your choice
[31:52] because of this momentous decision a
[31:55] huge portion of heaven awaits thee
[31:58] what a glorious decision now has made
[32:02] this in itself what the decision
[32:05] the choice then is in itself is that
[32:08] which will give
[32:10] and may come to pass the tremendous
[32:12] victory and love divine
[32:14] our brother says divine love the
[32:16] capstone ministry the capstone
[32:18] revelation
[32:19] the capping of it all amen now will come
[32:22] amen
[32:23] it will bring to pass listen he said it
[32:25] will
[32:26] this in itself your decision is what
[32:28] will give
[32:31] what will give to the people the
[32:33] capstone
[32:34] divine love and will may come to pass
[32:39] the capstone divine love the tremendous
[32:43] victory
[32:44] in love divine what was that
[32:47] that was god's program from before the
[32:49] foundation of the world at the end time
[32:51] amen to call his bride into the
[32:53] tremendous victory of divine love
[32:55] and ministry she would know his love she
[32:57] would know his mind
[32:58] she would know the thoughts he had of
[33:00] her before the foundation of the world
[33:02] what brought this in the past what gave
[33:04] it and brought it to come to pass this
[33:06] great victory
[33:07] what was it it was the decision of a man
[33:09] with a seventh grade education
[33:11] born amen in kentucky it was the
[33:13] decision of this human being
[33:15] that brought all of this to pass
[33:20] you see it wasn't just his makeup in his
[33:23] mind
[33:24] a decision he made that god had to
[33:26] adjust to
[33:27] no it was a decision that was aligned
[33:30] with the foreknowledge the predestinated
[33:32] plan of god and when those two things
[33:34] come together
[33:35] the programmed of god moved on there was
[33:37] a man
[33:38] on earth amen who would get amen because
[33:41] of an
[33:42] attribute seed of god placed in him that
[33:44] had certain characteristics that had to
[33:46] be expressed
[33:47] amen when the revelation of the word
[33:49] came along and he was faced with certain
[33:51] challenges
[33:52] amen he was pressed into certain
[33:54] conditions
[33:55] he was moved into certain places where
[33:57] he would have to make choices
[34:00] is that right and when he was pressed
[34:03] into that
[34:04] there was something on the inside that
[34:07] could catch inspiration of the spirit
[34:09] and could make the choice according to
[34:10] the revelation of the word
[34:14] and when he made that joys he was
[34:17] aligning with the predestinated will of
[34:19] god
[34:22] and then the program would advance god
[34:26] had this in his mind before the
[34:27] foundation of the world but he had to
[34:29] have
[34:30] that man make the choice or god's
[34:33] program was stalled
[34:36] the program of the capstone the program
[34:40] of all these things it was all stalled
[34:43] and you know
[34:44] and you wonder why brother brenham
[34:45] suffered so much and you wonder why
[34:47] he lost hope and he lost uh sharon rose
[34:51] amen it was because when he went to
[34:52] mitchell walk and he come in contact
[34:54] with the pentecostals
[34:55] amen he found something amen it
[34:58] triggered something on that seed on the
[34:59] inside it was beginning to come alive
[35:01] because that's what he was born for
[35:03] amen but his mother-in-law talked him
[35:05] out of it so he made a decision not to
[35:08] go
[35:09] like moses made a decision to run away
[35:12] from his brother brother brother made
[35:13] the decision not to go
[35:14] amen so what did god do amen god allowed
[35:17] the circumstances of life
[35:19] amen to come down and bring such a
[35:21] pressure such a squeeze
[35:23] amen such a difficulty in his life that
[35:26] the next time
[35:27] that he's presented with the opportunity
[35:28] he makes a different decision and this
[35:30] decision is aligned with the word
[35:35] amen we've if you've got to serve god
[35:38] for any length of time
[35:40] you have blown it a time or two
[35:43] you made horrible decisions and horrible
[35:45] mistakes and some that you're probably
[35:47] still
[35:47] paying for today amen but you can look
[35:50] back on that and say
[35:51] thank god because it's moved me to a
[35:53] position where i want to take the narrow
[35:55] way
[35:56] i want to go the harder way there was a
[35:58] time i wanted an easier way
[35:59] but i found what lead that path of an
[36:02] easier way
[36:03] leads to such grieving such heartache
[36:05] such difficulty
[36:06] that that god allowed me to go there of
[36:08] my own choosing he allowed me to reap
[36:10] that that fruit of that choice
[36:13] and i say thank you god for allowing me
[36:16] to reap the fruit of that decision
[36:18] because i'm coming to another one amen
[36:20] and these are momentous decisions
[36:22] friends these are momentous occasions
[36:24] because this is the end time brine and
[36:26] she's got to take this full word and put
[36:28] it on display
[36:29] we're coming to momentous decisions
[36:34] and we have to make the choice to go the
[36:36] narrow path
[36:38] the harder way
[36:41] it's a way of separation rejection
[36:46] misunderstanding difficulty
[36:50] not to mention what everybody outside
[36:52] the message thinks
[36:58] it's not an easy path
[37:03] but when brother brandon made his choice
[37:07] this in itself
[37:11] your choice is that which will give
[37:15] and may come to pass to tremendous
[37:18] victory
[37:19] in love divine say thank
[37:22] you god for a prophet of god a man that
[37:26] would go under such pressure and such
[37:28] strain and such heartache but he would
[37:30] make that decision because i'm reaping
[37:32] the benefit of his choice
[37:35] and i say may god allow somebody else to
[37:37] reap the benefit of our choices friends
[37:40] as we choose the narrow path the harder
[37:42] way
[37:44] let's go to genesis 18.
[37:56] genesis 18
[38:02] verse 20.
[38:07] and the lord said because the cry of
[38:09] sodom and gomorrah is great and because
[38:10] their sin is very grievous
[38:12] i will go down now and see whether they
[38:14] have done all together according to the
[38:16] cry of it
[38:16] which just come unto me and if not i
[38:19] will know
[38:20] this is such a strange scripture to me
[38:24] because doesn't god already know
[38:27] but somebody's crying out against sodom
[38:31] and when somebody began to cry out
[38:32] against sodom and who knows how many and
[38:35] nunos in what way
[38:36] but there was a cry against sodom and
[38:38] that cry against sodom
[38:40] brought god down to investigate the cry
[38:44] what if nobody was crying amen it was
[38:46] the cry
[38:47] that put him in action it was the cry
[38:50] that brought him down
[38:51] it was the cry against sodom amen there
[38:53] was a cry
[38:54] on earth somebody was crying against the
[38:56] condition and it was moving the
[38:58] heavenlies into action
[38:59] and god was coming down to investigate
[39:04] let's go to exodus chapter 3.
[39:13] the problem is we don't know who we are
[39:17] the problem is spiritual amnesia keeps
[39:19] trying to creep in and the only thing
[39:20] that will drive it out is the word of
[39:22] god
[39:22] and it's purity amen and we've got to
[39:24] stay constantly immersed in this word or
[39:26] that spiritual amnesia and that
[39:28] laodicean condition
[39:29] keeps bringing cataracts and cataracts
[39:31] and cataracts but amen there's a surgeon
[39:33] here
[39:34] dr jesus can take the word and cut the
[39:36] cataracts away
[39:37] so we can see in the word who we really
[39:39] are what we're here for amen that our
[39:41] purpose on this earth
[39:43] is not just the carnal things amen god
[39:45] is wanting to express
[39:46] himself through the carnal things we're
[39:48] not going to stop working and living in
[39:50] homes and driving cars
[39:51] and having a phone we're not going to
[39:53] stop any of that but god's going to
[39:55] express through
[39:56] all of that and if you don't know if we
[39:59] if we forget who we are
[40:01] amen we drop down out of the heavenly
[40:03] realm and we start just focusing on the
[40:06] carnal
[40:06] and we start focusing on work and car
[40:08] and house and
[40:10] and it's a total consummation of our
[40:13] whole all of our thoughts
[40:14] and all of our time and all of our
[40:16] energies amen
[40:18] and that's not what god wants god wants
[40:20] us to break free from amnesia and say
[40:22] i'm a son of god driving this car i'm a
[40:24] son of god working in this place
[40:26] i'm a son of god living on this
[40:27] neighborhood
[40:29] we're not americans amen we're sons and
[40:31] daughters of god
[40:33] living in america so we've got to stop
[40:36] acting like americans or acting like
[40:38] canadians or acting like whatever
[40:40] we are we're going to stop acting like
[40:42] whatever position we are
[40:43] mechanics amen or our engineers or
[40:46] whatever
[40:46] we got to stop acting like that we got
[40:48] to start acting like christians that are
[40:49] engineers and christians
[40:51] amen that are mechanics and christians
[40:53] that live on this neighborhood
[40:56] and not lose sight of what we're here so
[40:58] that we make choices to go the narrow
[41:00] path
[41:01] the harder way every time we're faced
[41:03] with the choice
[41:07] because god god has a partnership with
[41:11] man
[41:12] and his partnership with man is not men
[41:15] who've passed on before
[41:17] his partnership with man is men and
[41:19] women who are alive now
[41:21] he was on partnership with him then but
[41:23] they've already fulfilled their
[41:25] their parts but he's in partnership with
[41:28] men and women who are on earth today
[41:34] exodus 3 verse 7
[41:38] and the lord said i have surely seen the
[41:40] affliction of my people
[41:42] which are in egypt and have heard their
[41:43] cry by reason of their taskmasters
[41:46] for i know their sorrows and i am come
[41:48] down to deliver them out of the hand of
[41:50] the egyptians
[41:51] and to bring them out of the land into a
[41:53] good land and
[41:54] large into a land flowing with milk and
[41:56] honey unto the place of the canaanites
[41:59] and the hittites and the amorites and
[42:00] the
[42:01] perizzites and the hivites and the
[42:02] jebusites now therefore
[42:06] behold the cry of the children of israel
[42:09] has come unto me
[42:11] and i have also seen the oppression
[42:12] where with the egyptians oppressed them
[42:14] come now therefore and i will send thee
[42:16] into pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[42:18] forth my people the children of israel
[42:20] out of egypt what did god
[42:23] indicate was the reason he was coming
[42:25] down amen it was the cry of the people
[42:28] you said but he already prophesied to
[42:30] abraham this is exactly what was going
[42:32] to happen
[42:33] amen and there was there was also a
[42:34] witness of abraham or moses he was born
[42:36] a proper child to be a deliverer there
[42:38] was a witness at his birth
[42:40] amen there was a witness to abraham amen
[42:42] you're right on the timeline
[42:43] god you have to do this i mean just go
[42:45] and do it now he was waiting for
[42:47] something amen
[42:49] because moses showed up a few years
[42:50] earlier and the people weren't ready in
[42:52] the condition amen
[42:53] they weren't ready to choose the narrow
[42:55] path the harder way
[42:57] they rejected moses and moses ran away
[43:00] moses wasn't ready and the people
[43:02] weren't ready
[43:03] but god showed up on his timeline
[43:06] 400 years he showed up on the timeline
[43:09] according to prophecy
[43:10] amen but but the people he was in
[43:12] partnership weren't ready to make the
[43:14] right choice
[43:16] so god sent moses to the wilderness
[43:20] to a hot tempered wife into the back
[43:22] side of the desert
[43:24] and he left the people in bondage and
[43:26] increased their bondage
[43:30] and when god just cranked down the
[43:31] scrooge just one more turn
[43:35] all the sudden the hearts of the people
[43:37] began to cry for the prophecy
[43:40] they begin to cry out unto the lord
[43:42] until finally
[43:43] he comes in a burning bush amen he comes
[43:46] as the logos the pillar of fire to meet
[43:48] his prophet
[43:48] amen it's time this is the man god saw
[43:52] it by foreknowledge
[43:53] everything's kicking just according to
[43:55] his timepiece
[43:56] but when he comes down he doesn't say i
[43:58] decided today's the day and now you're
[44:00] going
[44:00] he said i have heard the cry of my
[44:02] people amen i've got a people down there
[44:05] that have cried unto heaven and they've
[44:06] got heaven activated to go into motion
[44:08] and i've come down and i'm sending you
[44:15] see when that battle moved from heaven
[44:17] to earth
[44:19] according to what we see in the
[44:20] scriptures the battle moved from heaven
[44:23] to earth
[44:24] amen and there's still a battle in
[44:26] heaven but it has
[44:27] everything to do with what's going on in
[44:29] earth
[44:33] it's still we we wore not against flesh
[44:35] and blood not against carnal things
[44:37] we're we're at war against
[44:38] principalities and powers in heavenly
[44:39] places so we're fighting in heavenly
[44:41] places
[44:42] so there's on earth there's something
[44:44] that's happening on earth
[44:45] but the battle is supernatural spiritual
[44:49] so i do like this and i point like this
[44:50] so you know what i'm talking about but
[44:52] really it's all right here amen
[44:54] heaven's not far away it's all right
[44:56] here just moving at a faster speed
[44:58] amen those dimensions are all right here
[45:00] they're moving amongst us amen
[45:02] amen brother basically god is here the
[45:04] angels are here the devils are here
[45:08] so you know i say this and i do this
[45:10] that's a poor representation i don't
[45:11] know
[45:11] how to show it's all like this
[45:16] it's all around us friends we're
[45:18] immersed in the battle
[45:19] amen but these two opposing forces amen
[45:22] the war moved from heaven
[45:23] and now it's in you amen and the
[45:25] battleground is in you
[45:27] and it's all based on the decisions that
[45:29] you and i make
[45:37] i've heard the cry of my people
[45:42] the cry of the children of israel what
[45:43] is cry prayers supplications
[45:48] i've heard the prayers of my people and
[45:50] i've come down to deliver them
[45:52] why because they were praying in time
[45:56] with the prophecy
[45:59] but the prophecy had been spoken the
[46:01] prophecy was laying there the
[46:02] foreknowledge of god had already went
[46:04] forth in the mind of god
[46:05] and now it was a spoken word on earth
[46:07] spoken amen to abraham
[46:09] now these things are moving along amen
[46:12] moving along
[46:13] but there has to be something to
[46:14] activate them into the earthly realm
[46:16] there has to be something that activates
[46:18] them to move down and get emotion
[46:19] and what's going to activate them is
[46:21] when he hears the cry of his people
[46:24] now the people are ready moses is ready
[46:26] amen the people are crying out
[46:28] oh god bring us deliverance oh god
[46:30] deliver your people
[46:31] and now this foreign knowledge of god
[46:34] and this spoken word prophecy are moving
[46:35] along and when the people begin to cry
[46:37] god says now it's time amen i've heard
[46:39] the cry of my people
[46:41] they have activated me to move the
[46:43] prophecy forward
[46:48] praise be to god friends
[46:53] say god forgive me for being a lazy
[46:55] christian
[46:57] this whole plan of redemption has
[47:00] everything to do with you and i
[47:03] as long as he can get one of god's
[47:05] subjects to let down the bar on the word
[47:07] then satan's gotten victory over the
[47:08] word how much of the word does he have
[47:11] to have victory over
[47:12] to keep us in these bodies
[47:15] how much of the word does he have to
[47:17] have victory over so they were still
[47:19] continuing the battle but there's got to
[47:22] be a people that says lord
[47:24] i want to be in tune with the prophecy i
[47:26] want to be in tune with the word
[47:27] i want to make my choice to choose the
[47:29] word at every junction amen
[47:32] in every conversation and everywhere my
[47:34] eyes land i want to choose to take the
[47:36] word
[47:36] at every junction in every situation and
[47:38] under every circumstance
[47:41] because i realize it's critical god it's
[47:43] absolutely critical
[47:45] yes sir
[47:48] brother brim says well the scripture
[47:53] i believe someplace says that the devils
[47:54] tremble when the weakest of saints get
[47:56] to their knees
[47:58] what a power and the privilege has been
[48:01] given to the church of the living god
[48:03] when you fall to your knees in prayer
[48:05] even the devils tremble
[48:07] to the weakest of them think of it
[48:11] when you as a creature
[48:15] from this earth but now been born again
[48:19] by the spirit of god a redeemed son or
[48:21] daughter of god
[48:23] when they look and see that earthly
[48:26] vessel
[48:27] dropped to its knees and bow its head
[48:30] the devils begin to tremble
[48:32] because what's happening is in your
[48:33] prayer if you can pray in the spirit
[48:37] and you can catch the mind of god on the
[48:38] word and you can begin to supplicate and
[48:41] pray unto god according to his word
[48:43] amen you are getting ready to activate
[48:45] voices in heaven
[48:47] you're getting ready to move the word
[48:49] into action amen
[48:51] move the spirit of god into action
[48:53] because that's what
[48:54] he's always seen down through time when
[48:57] the people begin to pray
[48:58] amen god said when my people amen who
[49:01] call by my
[49:02] name will humble themselves and pray
[49:04] i'll hear from heaven and answer them
[49:08] i mean god didn't just come down and say
[49:09] i'm going to do this and do this and do
[49:10] this and do this and do this and do that
[49:12] no somebody had to pray amen somebody
[49:15] had to be on
[49:16] earth as an agent amen calling out for
[49:18] the word
[49:19] calling out for the time of deliverance
[49:21] calling out for something
[49:22] so that god can move according to the
[49:28] rules
[49:30] let's look at genesis chapter 20.
[49:38] oh i just love the word of god
[49:44] i meant all by it but it's also such a
[49:47] heavy burden
[49:48] to realize all of this is hinging
[49:51] upon the redeemed seed of god
[49:56] genesis 20 verse 6.
[50:01] and god said to him in a dream this is
[50:03] abimelech now
[50:04] god said to him in a dream yeah i know
[50:07] that thou
[50:07] did this in the integrity of thy heart
[50:09] for i also withheld thee from sinning
[50:11] against me therefore suffered i.d not to
[50:13] touch her
[50:15] he had taken sarah because now sarah was
[50:17] turned back young and she was beautiful
[50:19] he had taken sarah to be one of his
[50:20] wives and before he could touch her god
[50:22] comes to him a dream
[50:24] and he says god you know the integrity
[50:25] of my heart i didn't know they said that
[50:27] was her brother
[50:28] amen and he says i know that's what he
[50:30] tells him i know the integrity of your
[50:31] heart that's why i suffered you not to
[50:32] touch her.
[50:33] now listen now therefore restore the
[50:36] manna's wife
[50:37] for he is a prophet and he shall pray
[50:39] for thee and thou shalt live
[50:41] and if thou restore her not know thou
[50:44] that that know thou that thou shalt
[50:47] surely die
[50:48] thou and all that are thine
[50:53] god is speaking to abimelech
[50:58] god almighty god is speaking to
[51:00] abimelech in a dream
[51:03] and he's warning abimelech not to take
[51:05] that woman and he said because of the
[51:07] integrity of your heart i
[51:08] spared you but
[51:11] god god could not release abimelech
[51:18] until abraham prayed
[51:21] you think god can do anything that he
[51:23] wants to do amen that god can just come
[51:25] down to a bearing like and say
[51:26] i hold you guiltless i understand the
[51:28] integrity of your heart you go on you're
[51:29] free
[51:30] he's having a conversation with god in a
[51:32] dream and god is telling him
[51:34] exactly what's going on but god himself
[51:36] cannot say you're free
[51:37] god has an agent on the earth and that
[51:39] agent has to intercede for abimelech and
[51:42] when abraham intercedes for a billion
[51:43] beam election
[51:44] god honors abraham's prayer and then he
[51:47] releases abimelech
[51:50] why i said we don't know who we are we
[51:51] are the royal seed amen we're the seed
[51:53] of abraham
[51:54] they mean the same thing is now on earth
[51:57] in the seed of abraham
[52:02] god has so worked his program that he
[52:05] cannot move without you and i
[52:06] thank you he's got abraham on the earth
[52:09] amen one of his chosen amen he's a
[52:11] prophet and he and he's talking to
[52:13] abimelech and saying
[52:14] you know i understand but you you know
[52:17] for me to release you you're going to
[52:19] have to get this man to pray for you
[52:22] that doesn't make sense oh it makes
[52:25] sense you just don't understand what the
[52:26] carnal mind how that makes sense but it
[52:28] makes perfect sense
[52:29] because god is still playing by the
[52:31] rules
[52:35] even if i can't tell you what all the
[52:37] rules are i know he's playing by the
[52:38] rules
[52:39] let's go to verse 17. so abraham prayed
[52:42] unto god and god
[52:44] healed to be malec and his wife and his
[52:46] maidservants
[52:47] and their and they bear children for the
[52:49] lord had fast closed up all the wombs of
[52:52] the house of abimelech
[52:53] because of sarah abraham's wife so god
[52:56] before he speaks to be
[52:57] like god had already closed their wounds
[52:59] and shut down any reproduction amen and
[53:02] now he's sitting here in this condition
[53:03] and god warns him of sarah tells him not
[53:06] to take her but
[53:07] god won't reverse what he put on him and
[53:09] he won't release him
[53:11] until one of god's agents on the earth
[53:13] prays to god and intercedes on behalf of
[53:16] and when he prays for a bema like god
[53:19] releases him and opens the wombs
[53:22] oh the word of god is showing us
[53:23] something friends let's see it
[53:25] amen it's not about well god will take
[53:27] care of that and god will do whatever he
[53:28] wants and whatever's supposed to happen
[53:30] will happen
[53:30] no god needs agents on the earth to
[53:32] begin to pray and say god forgive my
[53:34] brother amen for what he did
[53:36] let him go free god forgive my sister
[53:38] god forgive my neighbor
[53:40] amen i don't want anybody to be judged
[53:42] on account of me i want them to go free
[53:44] i want to intercede on their behalf
[53:46] [Music]
[53:47] it's not just trivial it's not just
[53:49] words there's power behind it if god
[53:52] moves you in your heart you say god amen
[53:55] my brother he's making a bad decision
[53:57] and i'm worried about god i'm asking
[53:58] that you stop him i'm asking that you
[54:00] send the agent of the holy ghost after
[54:02] to turn him around you can't just say
[54:04] well if he's doing wrong god will
[54:06] god will get a hold of him something
[54:07] will work out
[54:09] amen no we got to realize who we are
[54:13] say god help my brother help my sister
[54:15] move in this situation
[54:20] forgive those that have wronged me is
[54:22] that what the bible tells us to do
[54:25] forgive those that have done you wrong
[54:27] not hold on to bitterness
[54:29] and hatred and anger and hope that
[54:30] someday god will get them
[54:32] amen that's not what we're on this earth
[54:34] for amen we're here amen to intercede
[54:37] and
[54:37] to forgive those that have evilly
[54:39] mistreated us and used us wrong
[54:41] and and spoken evil against us we're
[54:43] supposed to according to the
[54:44] commandments of the word
[54:45] forgive them and if you don't forgive
[54:48] them
[54:49] the question is can god
[54:55] if you refuse as an agent on the earth
[54:57] if you refuse to forgive them
[54:59] cam god that's a good question
[55:04] i'm not going to give you the answer i'm
[55:07] not going to play god
[55:08] i'm sure you can do different things in
[55:09] different circumstances but i know one
[55:11] thing
[55:12] if i can forgive them amen and release
[55:15] any claim that i have against them
[55:17] and let them go free then it's
[55:18] completely up to god and i have nothing
[55:20] to do with it now
[55:22] and i can say god don't hold them
[55:25] accountable on account of me
[55:26] i free them and i let them go if you
[55:29] judge them judge them for something else
[55:30] but not for what they did to me
[55:32] because i release them from that and i
[55:34] let them go free
[55:36] because i don't want any blood on my
[55:39] hands amen
[55:40] because i was bitter and angry and
[55:42] wanted somebody to get punished
[55:45] you think that sounds great but when
[55:46] you're sitting at the white throne
[55:48] judgment you're watching the horrors
[55:49] that are taking place
[55:50] you won't think it's a good idea on that
[55:52] day
[55:56] say god don't hold them accountable let
[55:58] them go free
[55:59] god forgives them
[56:05] we have to know who we are amen
[56:10] brother branham says in 1953 now along
[56:15] this journey
[56:16] he's promised to supply everything that
[56:18] we have need of
[56:19] whatsoever you will ask the father in my
[56:21] name that will i do whatsoever things
[56:23] mark 11 24 whatsoever things you desire
[56:25] when you pray believe you receive it
[56:27] and you shall have it now he gave us the
[56:29] strongest weapon that there is in the
[56:31] world and that's prayer
[56:34] prayer is what changes things i'm
[56:36] reading this if you've read the message
[56:37] you know brother ben gives about four
[56:39] things that are the strongest weapon in
[56:40] the world
[56:42] prayer love a commitment or a commitment
[56:45] to god
[56:46] and the holy ghost so i'm not picking
[56:50] one or the other i'm just telling you
[56:51] what he said
[56:53] god gave us the strongest weapon there
[56:54] is in all the world and that's
[56:56] prayer prayer is what changes things
[56:59] remember that's the last piece of armor
[57:01] that we have
[57:03] it's prayer prayer is what changes
[57:06] things the christian doesn't realize
[57:08] what a force he has when he kneels on
[57:10] his knees before almighty god
[57:12] in the name of jesus christ he doesn't
[57:14] realize what power that is
[57:17] if the people could only realize that
[57:19] what is given right
[57:20] unto them anything that you ask for will
[57:22] be given if you can appropriate the
[57:24] faith to believe it
[57:25] for god's word is true
[57:29] we don't know what a power that god has
[57:31] given to his children
[57:33] that power is in prayer and it's the
[57:36] very
[57:37] thing that looks like the the weakest
[57:42] most ineffective thing you can do
[57:45] you've got troubles in your home you've
[57:47] got stresses
[57:49] at work you've got financial issues
[57:52] you've got
[57:52] uh oh you can have a myriad of issues
[57:56] and you should probably go fix this and
[57:58] fix that and talk to this person and
[58:00] talk to that one and talk to the boss
[58:01] and talk to the son and
[58:02] talk to the daughter and but the thing
[58:06] that seems to be the most ineffective
[58:08] is to turn around at your chair and get
[58:10] on your knees and slam your head right
[58:12] into the
[58:12] to the cushion of the couch or the chair
[58:14] and begin to cry out to god
[58:16] and you're like that's not doing
[58:17] anything no that's doing everything amen
[58:20] because if i run around and try to
[58:22] straighten something up all i'm going to
[58:23] do is make a messy situation messier
[58:25] but it's time for me to turn around and
[58:27] get on my knees and say there's nothing
[58:29] i can do god i need you amen
[58:31] if i'm going to talk to somebody you got
[58:32] to put the words in my mouth amen
[58:34] you got to make the circumstances work
[58:36] out i can't do it god i can't do it but
[58:39] you can and you've promised to be with
[58:41] me amen you've promised to undertake for
[58:43] me
[58:43] you promised to be with me to the end of
[58:45] the world whether so ever i go and i'm
[58:47] asking you to give me inspiration to
[58:50] handle this situation
[58:52] the way up is down amen it's not running
[58:55] around and fixing and showing off our
[58:56] brilliance and our intelligence
[58:58] and our communication skills and our
[58:59] ability to fix amen what we need to do
[59:02] is turn around and get on our knees and
[59:03] say god
[59:04] amen i'm coming to you because of your
[59:06] word and your word says i can come to
[59:08] you and i need help with this situation
[59:12] does that mean that the car is going to
[59:14] fix itself no
[59:16] well maybe you might go and turn the key
[59:19] and it's off and it's all soft
[59:20] or it might be god dropping inspiration
[59:22] in your mind you know exactly what to do
[59:25] instead of changing out five thousand
[59:26] dollars worth of parts you could change
[59:28] out five hundred dollars
[59:30] i've done both i like the second better
[59:35] or somebody stops by your house
[59:39] and they had that problem with that same
[59:40] model
[59:43] boy you were brilliant weren't you you
[59:46] you didn't do anything
[59:47] you just trusted god he's got an agent
[59:49] on the earth there's a power in prayer
[59:51] we need to start supplicating for our
[59:53] needs and for the needs of others
[59:55] and crying out for god to fulfill his
[59:57] word
[59:59] so that he's the mighty one among us
[1:00:01] amen
[1:00:04] he says in 1961 the message jesus christ
[1:00:06] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:00:09] says when we have that there's nothing
[1:00:11] will separate us
[1:00:12] there's nothing can divide us as long as
[1:00:14] we love one another
[1:00:15] i've been a minister for 31 years and
[1:00:17] i've seen all kinds of gifts
[1:00:19] i've seen god do great things but the
[1:00:21] greatest thing i ever seen in my life
[1:00:23] was love
[1:00:26] it's the most powerful for force that
[1:00:28] stops anything there is his love
[1:00:30] love that moved the mighty god god so
[1:00:32] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:00:33] begotten son
[1:00:34] love is the great keynote and the thing
[1:00:38] we leave
[1:00:38] out it's something that's eternal i read
[1:00:41] that on the heels of the other one so
[1:00:42] you realize
[1:00:43] the most powerful weapon is prayer but
[1:00:45] the most powerful weapon is love
[1:00:49] the most powerful weapon is a committal
[1:00:51] to god
[1:00:53] and the most powerful weapon is the holy
[1:00:55] ghost well i want to say
[1:00:56] during prayer all of these weapons come
[1:00:58] together as one amen
[1:01:00] when you get on your knees and begin to
[1:01:01] pray and the love of god and the love of
[1:01:04] his word and the love of the brethren
[1:01:05] begins to move you into supplication
[1:01:07] and to prayer and intercession for one
[1:01:09] another it's the love by the spirit of
[1:01:11] god
[1:01:12] and then you're committing it to god and
[1:01:13] getting up and trusting that god's going
[1:01:15] to take care of it
[1:01:16] everything god said brother bram said
[1:01:18] was the most powerful weapon all
[1:01:19] align themselves when you're on your
[1:01:21] knees praying out to god
[1:01:24] prayer is the most powerful weapon when
[1:01:25] i committed to god in love
[1:01:28] by the holy ghost
[1:01:31] praise be to god if we could just get in
[1:01:35] the spirit
[1:01:35] and pray the word and believe the word
[1:01:38] and supplicate
[1:01:39] amen we're going to see god move in
[1:01:41] mighty ways we have seen it
[1:01:43] we'll continue to see it
[1:01:46] oh praise god i want to go to daniel 9.
[1:01:57] there's always more word than there's
[1:01:58] time because the word's eternal
[1:02:01] time is temporary i'm looking forward to
[1:02:03] it going away
[1:02:06] daniel chapter 9 and we'll start at
[1:02:10] verse 1.
[1:02:15] in the first year of darius the son of
[1:02:16] azaris the seed of the medes
[1:02:19] which was made king over the realm of
[1:02:21] the chaldeans in the first year of his
[1:02:23] reign i daniel understood by books the
[1:02:25] number of the years
[1:02:26] where the word of the lord came to
[1:02:27] jeremiah the prophet that he would
[1:02:29] accomplish 70 years in the desolation of
[1:02:31] jerusalem
[1:02:33] and i set my face unto the lord god to
[1:02:35] seek by prayer
[1:02:37] and supplications with fastings and
[1:02:39] sackcloth
[1:02:40] and ashes daniel
[1:02:43] is looking at prophecy and he's looking
[1:02:47] at the time for the fulfillment of
[1:02:48] prophecy
[1:02:50] and daniel doesn't say well
[1:02:53] looks like god's going to take care of
[1:02:54] this
[1:02:56] daniel gets on his face with fastings
[1:03:00] with prayer with ashes and supplications
[1:03:03] he abases himself
[1:03:04] and begins to pray and say god this is
[1:03:06] what i see in your word is this time
[1:03:08] will you bring this to pass at this time
[1:03:10] and he begins to pray
[1:03:12] with fastings and sackcloth and ashes
[1:03:16] let's drop down to verse 20
[1:03:23] and while i was speaking and praying and
[1:03:26] confessing my sins in the sin of my
[1:03:28] people
[1:03:28] israel and presenting my supplications
[1:03:31] before the lord
[1:03:32] my god for the holy mountain of my god
[1:03:34] yea while i was speaking in prayer
[1:03:37] even the man gabriel whom i have seen in
[1:03:39] the vision at the beginning
[1:03:40] being caused to fly swiftly touched me
[1:03:43] about the time of the evening oblation
[1:03:45] and he informed me and talked with me
[1:03:47] and said o daniel i am now come forth to
[1:03:49] give thee skill
[1:03:51] and understanding at the beginning of
[1:03:53] thy supplications the commandment came
[1:03:55] forth and i came to show thee for thou
[1:03:57] art greatly beloved therefore understand
[1:04:00] the matter
[1:04:01] and consider the vision seventy weeks
[1:04:03] are determined upon my people
[1:04:05] and upon the holy city to finish the
[1:04:07] transgression
[1:04:08] to make an end of sin to make
[1:04:10] reconciliation for iniquity
[1:04:12] to bring an everlasting righteousness
[1:04:14] and to seal up the vision and prophecy
[1:04:16] and anoint the most holy daniel was
[1:04:19] praying over a prophecy jeremiah had
[1:04:22] given of
[1:04:22] 70 years of desolation and he saw by the
[1:04:25] books that it was time for completion
[1:04:27] he could see by reading by an intellect
[1:04:30] that were coming into this time
[1:04:31] but he needed a revelation he needed an
[1:04:34] understanding
[1:04:34] amen and god listen god never
[1:04:38] set forth gabriel until daniel prayed
[1:04:44] you know i've heard people before
[1:04:46] they're walking through this message
[1:04:48] amen and they say well i'm waiting for
[1:04:50] god to give me a revelation
[1:04:51] the truth is they don't want to see
[1:04:54] because if they see they're responsible
[1:04:56] for what they see
[1:04:57] and because they see it will require a
[1:04:59] change in their life and that change
[1:05:00] will bring rejection it'll bring
[1:05:02] hardship and bring difficulty
[1:05:03] so the real issue is by saying i'm
[1:05:05] waiting for a revelation i mean what
[1:05:07] they're really saying is
[1:05:08] i'm sticking my head in the ground like
[1:05:09] an ostrich because i don't want to see
[1:05:12] because i don't want to be responsible
[1:05:13] for what i see but when daniel wanted to
[1:05:15] see
[1:05:16] daniel got serious with god when he
[1:05:18] wanted to know what was the truth
[1:05:20] on this prophecy he went to prayer with
[1:05:22] fastings and sackcloth and ashes and he
[1:05:25] got serious with god
[1:05:26] and god never sent a revelation to
[1:05:28] daniel till daniel got serious about
[1:05:30] seeing a revelation
[1:05:32] when daniel wanted to know the word of
[1:05:34] god in the time of god
[1:05:35] and daniel got serious enough to go to
[1:05:37] fasting and prayer
[1:05:38] with sackcloth and ashes amen god sent
[1:05:40] gabriel and gabriel come and said
[1:05:42] and when you begin to pray is when i
[1:05:45] came
[1:05:46] not before but when you begin to pray is
[1:05:49] when i came
[1:05:50] god was waiting for you so i could get
[1:05:53] here to give you this revelation
[1:05:58] well what if he didn't pray if he didn't
[1:05:59] pray gabriel would have probably come
[1:06:01] because of 70 years and it had to happen
[1:06:04] i hate the what if games god did it the
[1:06:07] way it is is the way it is
[1:06:11] he was waiting for daniel gabriel
[1:06:15] was not dispatched till daniel prayed
[1:06:18] and look at the way daniel prayed and
[1:06:20] when daniel prayed
[1:06:22] god sent an angel to him to bring a
[1:06:24] revelation of the prophecy
[1:06:26] out of the word and that revelation amen
[1:06:29] was a mighty powerful revelation
[1:06:32] let's go to chapter 10.
[1:06:37] in the third year of cyrus king of
[1:06:39] persia a thing was revealed unto daniel
[1:06:41] whose name was called
[1:06:43] delta shazar and the thing was true but
[1:06:45] the time appointed was long and the
[1:06:47] under
[1:06:47] and he understood the thing and had
[1:06:49] understanding of the vision
[1:06:51] in those days i daniel was mourning
[1:06:53] three full weeks
[1:06:54] i ate no pleasant bread neither came
[1:06:56] flesh nor wine in my mouth neither did i
[1:06:58] anoint myself at all
[1:07:00] until three whole weeks were fulfilled
[1:07:02] and in the four and twentieth day of the
[1:07:04] first month as i was by the side of the
[1:07:05] great river which is
[1:07:07] head of hell then i lifted up mine eyes
[1:07:10] and looked and behold
[1:07:11] a certain man clothed in linen whose
[1:07:12] loins were girded with fine gold of
[1:07:14] youfus his body also was like barrel on
[1:07:17] his faces and the appearance of a
[1:07:19] lightning and his eyes as the lamps of
[1:07:20] fire
[1:07:21] and his arms and his feet like in color
[1:07:23] to polished brass
[1:07:24] and the voice of his words like the
[1:07:26] voice of a multitude
[1:07:29] let's go to verse 10 and behold a hand
[1:07:32] touched me
[1:07:33] which set me upon my knees and upon the
[1:07:35] palms of my hands
[1:07:37] and he said unto me oh daniel man
[1:07:38] greatly beloved
[1:07:40] understand the words that i speak unto
[1:07:42] thee and stand upright for unto thee
[1:07:44] am i now sin and when he had spoken this
[1:07:47] word unto me
[1:07:48] i stood trembling then said the unto me
[1:07:50] fear not daniel for from the first day
[1:07:53] that thou did set thine heart to
[1:07:55] understand and to chasten thyself before
[1:07:57] thy god
[1:07:58] thy words were heard and i am come for
[1:08:01] thy words twenty-one days he fasted and
[1:08:06] prayed and ate no pleasant bread
[1:08:08] no wine and no meat for 21 days amen
[1:08:11] and the angel was dispensed dispatched
[1:08:14] on day one
[1:08:15] but for 21 days daniel was serious
[1:08:18] about wanting understanding
[1:08:22] he goes on to say i came for thy words
[1:08:26] 13 but the prince of the kingdom of
[1:08:28] persia
[1:08:29] withstood me one in 20 days below
[1:08:32] michael one of the chief princes came to
[1:08:34] help me
[1:08:35] and i remain there with the kings of
[1:08:36] persia now i am come to make thee
[1:08:38] understand what shall befall thy people
[1:08:40] in the latter days
[1:08:43] for yet the vision is for many days
[1:08:47] so so daniel begins to pray
[1:08:50] i want you to pay close attention to
[1:08:52] this daniel was seeking understanding
[1:08:56] and he's mourning 21 days he's in a
[1:08:59] state of desperation
[1:09:00] for 21 days fasting
[1:09:04] and and in this 21 days he's serious
[1:09:07] and at the beginning when he begins to
[1:09:10] pray
[1:09:11] another angel is dispatched to come to
[1:09:13] him it may still be gabriel or another
[1:09:15] one the bible doesn't tell us the name
[1:09:16] of this one but
[1:09:17] but there's another angel dispatch to
[1:09:19] come and give him revelation
[1:09:22] and as he comes to give him revelation
[1:09:24] listen there's
[1:09:25] war that breaks out in the heavenly
[1:09:27] realm all around daniel because daniel
[1:09:30] is part of the kingdom of persia
[1:09:32] and as he's there there's a power over
[1:09:34] persia a demonic power a devil over
[1:09:37] persia
[1:09:38] and as gabriel comes to move in amen
[1:09:41] to to give this mess or who whatever
[1:09:44] this angel is
[1:09:45] comes to give this message to daniel
[1:09:47] amen the
[1:09:48] the prince of persia begins to withstand
[1:09:51] them amen
[1:09:51] and he's got to go back and get michael
[1:09:53] and michael's got to come
[1:09:55] and you say what in the world is going
[1:09:56] on what are they fighting over
[1:09:58] they're fighting because one of god's
[1:10:00] agents on the arch started praying
[1:10:02] and when he started praying look what
[1:10:04] happened all around persia
[1:10:07] you talk about forces that are moving
[1:10:09] mighty powerful forces that are moving
[1:10:12] this angel of the lord coming to bring a
[1:10:13] revelation
[1:10:14] michael the great prince coming in amen
[1:10:16] to open up a way for him to get through
[1:10:19] this isn't trivial this isn't tiny this
[1:10:21] isn't some little thing that's happening
[1:10:23] amen the whole heavens are moving amen
[1:10:25] the powers of heaven are beginning to
[1:10:27] shake and move because daniel wants to
[1:10:29] know what's going to happen at the end
[1:10:30] time
[1:10:33] what do you think is happening now at
[1:10:35] this end time revelation that's coming
[1:10:36] to god's seat do you think the heavens
[1:10:38] aren't shaking
[1:10:39] do you think there's not battles going
[1:10:40] on all over the place friends
[1:10:42] we've got to break the amnesia and open
[1:10:44] our spiritual eyes and see
[1:10:46] that the whole warfare is raging over
[1:10:48] this revelation in the end time
[1:10:51] because there's a people that say i want
[1:10:52] the word amen i want to break amnesia i
[1:10:54] want to know the truth i want to know
[1:10:56] you god
[1:10:58] i want to come back to my position i
[1:11:00] want to come back to where i fell from
[1:11:02] i want to come back to the right thing
[1:11:06] and you think that kind of end time
[1:11:08] bride god has hard purpose
[1:11:12] was to have a bride of his own choosing
[1:11:14] and you think when that bride is moving
[1:11:16] up in the revelation and praying for
[1:11:18] revelation amen and getting serious with
[1:11:20] god about the word
[1:11:21] you don't think there's anything
[1:11:22] happening amen for 21 days
[1:11:25] daniel didn't think anything was
[1:11:26] happening but it didn't matter what he
[1:11:28] could see
[1:11:28] what he couldn't see was a lot of action
[1:11:33] and we think sometimes we're moving
[1:11:35] along as the bride having a service
[1:11:36] having another service
[1:11:38] reading a book listening to a tape
[1:11:39] praying for god to open our eyes to give
[1:11:41] us revelation to help me understand what
[1:11:43] the prophet said here
[1:11:44] oh if you just get serious about that i
[1:11:47] guarantee there's something going on all
[1:11:49] around you
[1:11:50] that you can't see
[1:11:54] moving forces opening doors
[1:11:59] you say i want more revelation get
[1:12:01] serious about more revelation
[1:12:02] and god will send forces mighty angels
[1:12:05] to penetrate the darkness to open up a
[1:12:07] path
[1:12:08] so that an angel of the lord can come
[1:12:09] and bring you a revelation
[1:12:12] yes sir hey ben
[1:12:16] this isn't small stuff friends
[1:12:19] we think we're just going through the
[1:12:20] motions you know realize heaven is
[1:12:22] shaking as you're going through the
[1:12:24] motions
[1:12:26] battles are breaking out angels are
[1:12:28] facing off
[1:12:29] forces are being driven back doors of
[1:12:32] revelation are being opened
[1:12:35] shafts of light are moving into dark
[1:12:37] areas what is happening
[1:12:39] amen there's somebody getting serious
[1:12:41] about the word there's somebody praying
[1:12:43] for their eyes to be open there's
[1:12:44] somebody who will be so
[1:12:46] serious that they'll skip a few meals
[1:12:47] and say god i want more of you
[1:12:50] i want to see you more clearly
[1:12:53] and the heavenly realms burst into
[1:12:55] action
[1:12:57] why what moved this angel to the lord
[1:13:00] what moved michael
[1:13:01] what caused all this is because one of
[1:13:03] god's agents on the earth got serious
[1:13:06] about mourning and supplicating and
[1:13:08] wanting to see the word
[1:13:11] daniel chapter 10 verse 20.
[1:13:19] then he said knowest thou therefore i
[1:13:21] come unto thee
[1:13:22] and now will i return to fight with the
[1:13:25] prince of persia
[1:13:26] and when i am gone forth lo the prince
[1:13:28] of greece shall come
[1:13:32] now listen this
[1:13:35] angel was not in motion was not moving
[1:13:38] amen into persia until daniel prayed
[1:13:42] but when daniel began to pray he began
[1:13:44] to move
[1:13:45] warfare broke out battles were erupting
[1:13:48] over
[1:13:48] over the air in persia
[1:13:52] michael was called forces were facing
[1:13:54] off
[1:13:55] a way was made for this angel to come
[1:13:57] and after he come and delivered the
[1:13:59] message to daniel
[1:14:00] he said now i'm going to go back and
[1:14:02] fight with the king of persia
[1:14:04] because daniel you started a sequence of
[1:14:07] events
[1:14:09] you started this motion in the heavens
[1:14:11] from
[1:14:12] earth from from just skipping meals and
[1:14:14] not eating pleasant bread and wearing
[1:14:16] sackcloth and mourning
[1:14:17] and and grieving in your heart for the
[1:14:19] word and desiring because of that
[1:14:21] you set forces in the motion you set
[1:14:24] things into action
[1:14:25] prophecy is now coming to fulfillment
[1:14:27] amen he wasn't in persia amen this angel
[1:14:30] wasn't in persia
[1:14:31] he wasn't fighting with the prince of
[1:14:32] persia until daniel prayed but when
[1:14:34] daniel prayed he moves
[1:14:35] he brings the message now he goes back
[1:14:37] to fight with the king of persia
[1:14:39] because the king of greece is coming in
[1:14:41] to displace the king of persia
[1:14:43] now the spiritual battle is going to
[1:14:45] reflect on earth and it's going to be a
[1:14:47] toppling of an
[1:14:48] empire and bringing in another new
[1:14:50] empire with alexander the great
[1:14:52] what moved that into motion daniel
[1:14:55] prayed
[1:14:56] when daniel prayed the persian empire
[1:14:59] began to fall amen
[1:15:00] that was the beginning of the fall he
[1:15:02] says in the next chapter there'll be
[1:15:03] three more kings and then they'll be the
[1:15:05] fourth king
[1:15:05] and then alexander the great is going to
[1:15:07] move it and topple it what started all
[1:15:09] of that
[1:15:10] fall of this mighty powerful kingdom of
[1:15:12] the persians
[1:15:13] amen it was daniel seeking revelation
[1:15:16] daniel wanting to know god
[1:15:24] bombs are coming to america because
[1:15:27] there's a people who want to know god
[1:15:29] a people who want to know this
[1:15:31] revelation moving forces friends
[1:15:33] forces of change what do you think is
[1:15:35] happening all over the earth
[1:15:37] why do you think chaos is breaking out
[1:15:39] in every nation
[1:15:40] in economies and politics amen in the in
[1:15:43] the weather
[1:15:44] amen it all has to do with god's people
[1:15:46] praying for revelation
[1:15:48] it's moving forces all over the earth
[1:15:50] and bringing prophecy to be fulfilled
[1:15:53] brother branham couldn't do it all
[1:15:55] himself he did his part amen and when he
[1:15:57] was here doing his part he was told to
[1:15:59] pick up a rock and throw it in the air
[1:16:01] he did
[1:16:01] it started a whirlwind amen it blasted
[1:16:04] the rocks out
[1:16:04] there at sunset mountain then went up
[1:16:06] and caused an earthquake amen in alaska
[1:16:09] why there was an agent of god on earth
[1:16:11] that would do
[1:16:12] something that would start forces of
[1:16:14] moving
[1:16:15] he said it was the beginning of
[1:16:16] judgments amen but brother branham
[1:16:18] couldn't do it all
[1:16:20] amen now there's agents of god on the
[1:16:22] earth now that are moving heavenly
[1:16:24] forces in motion
[1:16:25] moving prophecy down the road and if we
[1:16:28] don't get lined up with the word
[1:16:30] we're going to halt the progress of
[1:16:32] prophecy
[1:16:34] but when by amen the spirit of god we
[1:16:37] begin to line our choices with the word
[1:16:40] and choose the word and choose the word
[1:16:42] amen prophecy keeps moving down the path
[1:16:44] and when you're reading in your
[1:16:46] newspaper friends
[1:16:48] what is it what's that news feed coming
[1:16:50] on your phone
[1:16:51] disaster here disaster there disaster
[1:16:53] there because there's daniels on the
[1:16:55] earth amen
[1:16:56] there's sons and daughters that are
[1:16:58] saying god i want your word
[1:17:00] and nothing else amen show me this word
[1:17:03] so i can live it
[1:17:04] reveal it to me live it through me oh
[1:17:06] god
[1:17:09] don't let this world be a mystery to you
[1:17:11] we've had a prophet in this day
[1:17:12] they opened the word of god to us so we
[1:17:14] can look in this bible so we can
[1:17:16] understand what's going on around us
[1:17:18] don't let this be a mystery to you it's
[1:17:20] a mystery to the rest of the world but
[1:17:22] we understand clearly what's happening
[1:17:25] the earth is in birth pains amen and the
[1:17:28] contractions are getting more intense
[1:17:29] and closer together
[1:17:30] why because the earth desires to bring
[1:17:34] forth a bright new world for a
[1:17:35] millennium
[1:17:36] the earth is groaning in travail for the
[1:17:39] manifestations of the sons of god
[1:17:41] in the millennial reign this earth is
[1:17:43] watching the progress of the word
[1:17:45] and the progress of the bride and her
[1:17:47] birth pains are matching amen
[1:17:49] because it can't birth a millennium till
[1:17:51] you have a rapture
[1:17:52] you can't have a rapture until the earth
[1:17:54] is ready to birth the millennium
[1:17:55] so these things are moving on parallel
[1:17:57] tracks and what you're seeing in the
[1:17:59] earth is showing there's a people on
[1:18:01] this earth that's crying out to god for
[1:18:03] the word
[1:18:04] [Applause]
[1:18:06] it's not a mystery it's prophecy it's
[1:18:09] not a mystery
[1:18:10] it's the bible alive today
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:16] i said god help me help me
[1:18:20] to make this word my meat to make this
[1:18:23] word my portion
[1:18:24] to make this word my love to make it my
[1:18:26] life to make it everything
[1:18:29] because that's what moves heaven gets it
[1:18:32] in motion
[1:18:43] let's turn to mark 11. i just want to
[1:18:45] read a couple more scriptures before we
[1:18:46] leave
[1:18:48] mark 11.
[1:19:01] in verse 22.
[1:19:08] mark 11 and verse 22
[1:19:12] and jesus answered saith unto him have
[1:19:15] faith in god
[1:19:16] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[1:19:18] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[1:19:20] removed
[1:19:21] and be cast into the sea and shall not
[1:19:24] doubt his heart but shall believe that
[1:19:26] those things which he saith shall come
[1:19:27] to pass
[1:19:29] he shall have whatsoever he saith there
[1:19:32] where therefore i say unto you
[1:19:34] whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:19:36] pray believe that you receive them
[1:19:38] and you shall have them here's what
[1:19:40] brother branham says in the message door
[1:19:42] to the heart
[1:19:44] so may the words that i spoke the other
[1:19:46] night be true
[1:19:47] after i'm gone cripples will get up and
[1:19:49] walk blind will see
[1:19:50] diseases they'll find out that they're
[1:19:52] well for we ask those things and the
[1:19:54] lord would
[1:19:55] with all my heart i believe them and
[1:19:58] they have to
[1:19:59] but everyone's talking about after he
[1:20:00] leaves the campaign and after he leaves
[1:20:02] the city things will
[1:20:03] keep manifesting thou said in thy word
[1:20:07] if thou
[1:20:07] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:20:09] doubt in your heart but believe
[1:20:11] that what you have said is being done
[1:20:13] then you can have what you said
[1:20:15] being done this mountain be moved maybe
[1:20:18] just one little grain of sand dropped
[1:20:20] when we said when we said for it to move
[1:20:24] but it's on its way maybe tomorrow a
[1:20:26] spoonful will drop
[1:20:27] but it's still on its way it's never
[1:20:29] noticeable
[1:20:30] tons may fall and still not noticeable
[1:20:32] but one day it shall be flat because we
[1:20:35] have said it
[1:20:35] jesus gave the promise the crippled man
[1:20:38] may not even be able to move his foot
[1:20:40] but he's on the road out he has believed
[1:20:43] it the sick may not feel any different
[1:20:44] but we've said it lord it's your word
[1:20:47] you'll honor it it will not return to
[1:20:49] you void it'll accomplish
[1:20:50] that which it was purposed for
[1:20:54] even if you speak to the mountain speak
[1:20:56] the word and
[1:20:57] take the word of god and believe it amen
[1:20:59] you may not see any change like daniel
[1:21:01] when he began to pray for 21 days
[1:21:03] nothing 21 days nothing amen but
[1:21:07] but something was moving the moment he
[1:21:09] started praying
[1:21:11] and we've got to pray with faith in this
[1:21:13] word and faith in who we are
[1:21:15] and what god has revealed to us and stop
[1:21:18] looking around for results and believe
[1:21:22] that the unseen forces are already going
[1:21:24] to work to bring this word to pass
[1:21:27] that's the commitment that we commit
[1:21:28] unto god believing that he'll keep his
[1:21:30] word
[1:21:31] i'm not going to start believing when i
[1:21:33] start seeing i'm going to believe amen
[1:21:35] because i'm a believer
[1:21:36] amen because it's in my heart to believe
[1:21:38] this word and when i pray with faith
[1:21:41] and love and committed to god men the
[1:21:43] spirit
[1:21:44] i believe that something moved even if i
[1:21:46] didn't see it some angel went
[1:21:48] somewhere some force is resisting
[1:21:50] there's something working out somewhere
[1:21:54] and it may just be a grain of sand
[1:21:56] rolled off the back side of that
[1:21:57] mountain but it was a start and that
[1:21:59] grain will catch more and begin to move
[1:22:01] and begin to move until the whole thing
[1:22:03] comes flat
[1:22:04] daniel for 21 day praise 21 days and
[1:22:07] it's not like the condition changed for
[1:22:09] 21 days
[1:22:11] it's not like i could say a reduction in
[1:22:13] symptoms here and maybe i feel a little
[1:22:15] better here
[1:22:16] nothing changed for 21 days
[1:22:19] except he probably got weaker
[1:22:25] but something moved the day he prayed
[1:22:28] something went into motion the moment
[1:22:30] amen he got serious
[1:22:33] brother branham said referring to daniel
[1:22:38] he said now what happened here's what
[1:22:40] happened if god speaks anything god is
[1:22:42] under obligation to take care of what he
[1:22:44] says
[1:22:45] god can't come to your rescue just every
[1:22:47] minute
[1:22:48] the angel lord can't get to you at every
[1:22:51] and he stops and change the subject
[1:22:52] said you remember daniel prayed and i
[1:22:55] believe there
[1:22:56] 21 days wasn't that right 21 days before
[1:22:59] the angel could get to him
[1:23:01] he said i was withstood by the prince
[1:23:03] out there the medes persian but
[1:23:04] but he got to him i heard you but i
[1:23:07] couldn't get to you
[1:23:08] brother branham's saying the angel lord
[1:23:10] can't get to you just that minute amen
[1:23:12] but he's on his way believe that he's on
[1:23:15] his way because you took god at his word
[1:23:17] and god's not going to change his word
[1:23:19] god's not going to fail to fulfill his
[1:23:21] word
[1:23:22] amen but brother bam tells us so many
[1:23:24] times what happens as you get prayed for
[1:23:26] and there's a there's
[1:23:28] there's a sense of i'm healed there's a
[1:23:30] deliverance there's a good feeling
[1:23:32] amen but then that spirit realm that
[1:23:35] unseen realm
[1:23:36] is cast out the life of that disease is
[1:23:38] cast away
[1:23:39] only it's unseen you didn't see it
[1:23:43] but something powerful happened the
[1:23:45] cancer life
[1:23:46] that whatever life it was was cast out
[1:23:50] he said now your body has to deal with
[1:23:53] all of these
[1:23:54] germs or tissue or whatever is left over
[1:23:56] from this life
[1:23:58] and he says many times you get sicker
[1:24:01] and when you get sicker
[1:24:03] amen the devil brings it down your mind
[1:24:05] you begin to doubt your healing
[1:24:06] and then you begin to say something like
[1:24:08] well i thought it worked
[1:24:10] i thought i was healed but i still have
[1:24:14] and when you confess i still have that
[1:24:17] spirit comes right back into that life
[1:24:19] and you got it and you think nothing
[1:24:21] happened something powerful happened the
[1:24:23] moment you took god at his word
[1:24:25] and in prayer with faith amen but it was
[1:24:28] your negative confession that brought it
[1:24:30] back
[1:24:32] you see and then somehow we begin to
[1:24:34] lose confidence in god's words over
[1:24:36] things like that
[1:24:37] and there was no problem with god's word
[1:24:39] there was no problem with the prayer
[1:24:41] god began to act immediately amen but
[1:24:43] you've got to trust
[1:24:44] god and let god work amen and believe
[1:24:47] that it will work
[1:24:49] daniel didn't stop praying until he got
[1:24:51] his answer
[1:24:54] 21 days he didn't pray for 10 and say
[1:24:57] well i guess god doesn't want to tell me
[1:24:59] there was something stirring in him he
[1:25:01] had to have the answers
[1:25:04] there's something stirring in you you've
[1:25:05] got to have deliverance you've got to
[1:25:07] have the answers you've got to see this
[1:25:09] word come to pass
[1:25:10] then stick with it friends because
[1:25:12] something's moving somewhere
[1:25:13] you just can't see it you may not be
[1:25:15] able to feel it with these senses but
[1:25:17] something's moving somewhere
[1:25:21] because there's an agent of god taking
[1:25:24] god at his word
[1:25:28] james 4. i just want to lay this in here
[1:25:33] james chapter 4 this is a very important
[1:25:38] principle
[1:25:45] james chapter 4 and verse
[1:25:49] 1. for whence comes wars and fightings
[1:25:53] among you come they not hints of your
[1:25:55] of your lust that war in your members
[1:25:59] what's the problem i want i want
[1:26:02] i want i want it's warring in your
[1:26:04] members and causing problems in the
[1:26:06] church
[1:26:08] you lust and have not you kill and
[1:26:10] desire to have and cannot obtain
[1:26:12] you fight in war yet you have not
[1:26:14] because you ask not
[1:26:17] you have not because you ask not you ask
[1:26:20] and receive not
[1:26:21] because you ask amiss that you may
[1:26:23] consume it upon your lusts
[1:26:27] see he's telling us the man tells us
[1:26:29] what's your motive and objective
[1:26:31] amen do you want the word do you want
[1:26:33] god's word
[1:26:34] amen daniel didn't get down to pray and
[1:26:36] say if i can get this revelation i can
[1:26:39] preach better than all the other
[1:26:40] preachers
[1:26:42] if i get this then i'll have followers
[1:26:45] and i can
[1:26:46] i can show how much i know that wasn't
[1:26:48] daniel's motive
[1:26:49] daniel just wanted to know amen daniel
[1:26:52] had a hunger for the restoration
[1:26:53] daniel wanted to go back to the right
[1:26:55] condition in jerusalem
[1:26:57] daniel wanted these things to come to
[1:26:58] pass he wanted to know them
[1:27:01] his only motive was to know god's word
[1:27:04] and when we can check our motives and
[1:27:06] know that our only motive is to please
[1:27:07] god
[1:27:08] our only motive is to serve god our only
[1:27:10] motive is
[1:27:11] as they intercede for our brothers and
[1:27:13] sisters our only motive is to keep the
[1:27:14] program of god moving forward
[1:27:16] amen then you can pray with confidence
[1:27:18] it's not because i want to be something
[1:27:20] or have something or do something or go
[1:27:21] somewhere
[1:27:22] i want god to be god and i want his
[1:27:25] program to move on this planet
[1:27:30] he said he says first you see your
[1:27:34] motives and objectives have to be right
[1:27:36] you have to have reasons for this god
[1:27:38] don't give you those things just because
[1:27:40] you ask and you cannot ask in faith
[1:27:42] unless there's a real objective to them
[1:27:44] to be in the will of god see if you want
[1:27:46] to be well what do you want to be well
[1:27:48] for
[1:27:49] see if you want to be healed what's the
[1:27:51] reason you want to be healed
[1:27:53] what are you telling god what do you
[1:27:54] want to do with your life when you get
[1:27:56] healed
[1:27:57] see there's got to be you've got to have
[1:28:00] a mode of an objective
[1:28:01] and they have to be right according to
[1:28:03] the will of god
[1:28:04] and and then when faith is revealed to
[1:28:07] you and god by his sovereign grace
[1:28:09] places that faith in there
[1:28:10] then it's over what's the reason
[1:28:14] amen can you find a godly reason for
[1:28:16] what you're asking for
[1:28:17] god this is your word amen and i need
[1:28:19] your word it's time for your word
[1:28:21] god i'm sick in my body and you've
[1:28:23] called me to be a father and a husband
[1:28:25] amen and i need to provide for my wife
[1:28:27] and my children
[1:28:28] according to your word heal me lord so
[1:28:30] that i can fulfill your word
[1:28:32] heal me so i can testify of your healing
[1:28:35] power
[1:28:35] or heal me lord i'm a mother and i can't
[1:28:38] care for my children but you've called
[1:28:40] me to be a mother it's my calling in
[1:28:41] life
[1:28:42] heal me so i can get up and take care of
[1:28:44] my kids
[1:28:45] what's the motive is it just so we don't
[1:28:47] feel bad
[1:28:49] or can we say i want your program to
[1:28:51] keep moving and in this condition i
[1:28:53] can't keep moving lord
[1:28:55] i want to serve you better and i need
[1:28:57] this so i can serve you better i need
[1:28:59] freedom in my mind i need freedom in my
[1:29:01] body i need
[1:29:02] these things i need you to take care of
[1:29:04] these things so i can keep moving in
[1:29:06] this program
[1:29:08] i need you going and i want to keep
[1:29:11] serving you
[1:29:16] praise god amen i got way more notes
[1:29:20] than we got time
[1:29:22] but i want you to know that no matter
[1:29:25] what you see
[1:29:27] if you come to god according to god's
[1:29:30] provided way
[1:29:31] god will keep his word don't
[1:29:34] doubt it don't question it don't go back
[1:29:36] on it
[1:29:37] don't back down don't be positive one
[1:29:39] day negative the next day
[1:29:40] you're destroying everything amen
[1:29:42] because he's a high priest of your
[1:29:43] profession
[1:29:45] so you've got to keep confessing the
[1:29:47] word and know that something's moving if
[1:29:50] i don't feel something see anything
[1:29:52] it doesn't matter something's moving i
[1:29:54] know by faith that i come to god with
[1:29:56] the right motive
[1:29:57] i know that this is his word and i know
[1:29:59] that i'm his child and i have no reason
[1:30:02] to doubt that he's going to move in this
[1:30:03] situation and i'm going to commit it to
[1:30:05] god
[1:30:06] and i'm going to stay right here until
[1:30:08] he brings it to pass
[1:30:11] don't flounder don't wander amen don't
[1:30:13] allow your mind to get tossed to and fro
[1:30:16] but anchor it in the word of god and
[1:30:19] don't move
[1:30:21] because when an agent of god begins to
[1:30:23] take the word of god
[1:30:24] and speak the word of god in prayer and
[1:30:26] ask god to move on his word
[1:30:28] things are happening all around
[1:30:31] the heavens have burst into action
[1:30:34] because you're not at war with anything
[1:30:36] natural
[1:30:38] you're at war with principalities and
[1:30:40] powers
[1:30:42] in heavenly places
[1:30:45] let's turn to matthew 17.
[1:30:53] now there's something i want to bring to
[1:30:54] your attention here at the end of the
[1:30:56] service and
[1:30:57] i want us as an assembly to be praying
[1:30:59] for something very specific
[1:31:02] it's been on my heart for quite a little
[1:31:04] while i've been praying and meditating
[1:31:07] about what to do and which way to
[1:31:10] approach this but god has led me down
[1:31:12] this path
[1:31:14] and i don't know how many of you know
[1:31:15] but our brother daniel aaron is
[1:31:17] suffering
[1:31:18] tremendously with mental illness
[1:31:22] with all kinds of tormenting thoughts
[1:31:25] and and it's hard to understand when you
[1:31:28] see somebody who's struggling like that
[1:31:29] because they're healthy on the outside
[1:31:31] their body's healthy
[1:31:33] they you can you can see them they can
[1:31:35] walk around they can talk
[1:31:36] but when you can't control your own
[1:31:38] thoughts and you're tormented by
[1:31:41] thoughts and you can't break free from
[1:31:42] that
[1:31:43] and you're mentally exhausted all the
[1:31:44] time my brother daniel is mentally
[1:31:46] exhausted
[1:31:47] all the time and he's fighting just to
[1:31:50] keep a positive confession
[1:31:52] and he's exhausted from fighting just to
[1:31:54] say
[1:31:55] what the word says and speak a positive
[1:31:57] confession
[1:31:58] and our brother is tormented tormented
[1:32:00] so that he keeps struggling with
[1:32:02] thoughts that come into his mind
[1:32:04] that to be dead would be better to be
[1:32:06] alive that's how much
[1:32:08] mental torment he's under and unless you
[1:32:10] really know somebody's gone through that
[1:32:12] you can't understand it you can't
[1:32:13] comprehend it
[1:32:14] he can't just change his thinking he
[1:32:16] can't control his thinking
[1:32:19] but he needs brothers and sisters who
[1:32:21] know this word
[1:32:23] and i want to read a scripture that god
[1:32:24] laid on my heart and and
[1:32:26] and i want to end by just wrapping
[1:32:28] everything up into this
[1:32:30] if we'll look at matthew 17 verse 14
[1:32:32] together
[1:32:38] and when they were come to the multitude
[1:32:40] they came to him a certain man kneeling
[1:32:42] down to him and saying
[1:32:44] lord have mercy on my son for he is a
[1:32:46] lunatic
[1:32:47] and sore vexed for often times he
[1:32:49] falleth into the fire and often into the
[1:32:51] water
[1:32:52] and i brought him to the disciples and
[1:32:54] they could not cure him
[1:32:56] brother branham said he had an epileptic
[1:32:58] spirit
[1:32:59] that was on the child then jesus
[1:33:02] answered and said
[1:33:03] oh faithful and perverse generation how
[1:33:05] long shall i be with you
[1:33:07] how long shall i suffer you bring him
[1:33:08] hither to me and jesus rebuked the devil
[1:33:11] when he departed out of him
[1:33:12] and the child was cured from that very
[1:33:14] hour then came to the disciples to jesus
[1:33:17] apart and said
[1:33:18] why could not we cast him out now listen
[1:33:20] i want you to think here with me for a
[1:33:22] minute
[1:33:23] the disciples had already been
[1:33:24] commissioned by jesus to cast out devils
[1:33:26] they had been casting out devils this is
[1:33:29] why they asked the question
[1:33:30] they were surprised when they couldn't
[1:33:32] get this devil to go
[1:33:34] it wasn't like they were not you know
[1:33:36] it's not like it never worked
[1:33:39] the disciples have been praying and
[1:33:40] they've been they've been seeing mighty
[1:33:42] miracles and tremendous things take
[1:33:44] place
[1:33:44] and they prayed for this boy believing
[1:33:47] that he would be healed like everybody
[1:33:48] else was here
[1:33:49] and when it couldn't happen they took
[1:33:51] him to jesus jesus cast
[1:33:53] them out but but when they looked at
[1:33:55] jesus they said jesus
[1:33:56] why couldn't we cast them out so you can
[1:33:59] see this is a legitimate question
[1:34:01] why didn't it work this time
[1:34:05] and jesus said unto them because of your
[1:34:09] unbelief for verily i say unto you if
[1:34:11] you have faith as the grain of a mustard
[1:34:12] seed you shall say unto this mountain
[1:34:14] remove hence yonder place and it shall
[1:34:16] be removed and nothing shall be
[1:34:18] impossible unto you
[1:34:20] how be it how be it
[1:34:23] this kind goeth not out but by prayer
[1:34:26] and fasting
[1:34:28] let's turn over to mark 9.
[1:34:38] mark chapter 9 verse 28.
[1:34:47] this is the same story in mark and when
[1:34:49] he was coming to the house his disciples
[1:34:51] asked him privately
[1:34:52] why could not we cast him out and he
[1:34:55] said unto them
[1:34:56] this kind can come forth by nothing
[1:34:59] but by prayer and fasting
[1:35:03] see jesus gave some interesting insight
[1:35:06] into the demonic world
[1:35:08] the disciples had already been
[1:35:10] commissioned by jesus to cast out devils
[1:35:12] and heal
[1:35:12] all manner of sickness and and they had
[1:35:15] gone about doing what god said and they
[1:35:17] cast out devils here cast out devils
[1:35:19] there
[1:35:19] and healed the sick here and they were
[1:35:21] doing that but they come to one
[1:35:23] that they couldn't and they asked jesus
[1:35:25] why and he says
[1:35:26] this devil doesn't act like the other
[1:35:29] devils
[1:35:29] this one doesn't go out but by prayer
[1:35:31] and fasting
[1:35:33] and also in our small thinking in our
[1:35:35] small minds we were like the disciples
[1:35:37] thinking well you know you pray the
[1:35:39] prayer of it this one's healed prayer
[1:35:40] the prayer of faith this one's healed
[1:35:41] but jesus is letting them in given some
[1:35:44] insight into something saying listen
[1:35:46] there are some devils that have a
[1:35:48] stronger tighter hold than other devils
[1:35:52] because we know that we're dealing with
[1:35:55] layers of devils with different powers
[1:35:57] and different characteristics
[1:35:59] even brother brennaman demonology if you
[1:36:01] read the book demonology
[1:36:02] he begins to describe devils he says
[1:36:04] that one has it looks like a tortoise
[1:36:06] with fat legs this one's a big hairy bat
[1:36:08] this one's this showing that devils have
[1:36:11] different characteristics
[1:36:13] they're not all the same because the
[1:36:15] heavenly realm is a reflection of the
[1:36:17] earthly realm
[1:36:18] and not everything is on the same power
[1:36:20] not every
[1:36:21] country every nation not every person
[1:36:23] has the same gifts the same powers the
[1:36:25] same talents the same abilities
[1:36:27] and the demonic world operates somewhat
[1:36:30] like that
[1:36:32] there's different characteristics and
[1:36:34] there are some devils
[1:36:35] that have such a tight hold and so
[1:36:38] deeply entrenched
[1:36:39] amen that the prayer that would cast out
[1:36:41] this and the prayer that would cast out
[1:36:43] this
[1:36:43] when they come the same way the diet you
[1:36:45] know the disciples didn't sin
[1:36:47] in between the last person they healed
[1:36:49] and this this boy
[1:36:51] the disciples didn't lose their faith
[1:36:54] between the last person they healed and
[1:36:56] this boy
[1:36:57] the disciples were being taught a lesson
[1:37:00] hey
[1:37:01] you don't deal with every devil the same
[1:37:03] way some come not out by prayer and
[1:37:05] fasting
[1:37:06] and this scripture has been on my mind
[1:37:08] and i've been dealing with this
[1:37:10] i even spoke to the deacons about it in
[1:37:12] our last deacon meeting and i didn't
[1:37:13] know which way to go but god had been
[1:37:15] dealing with me in this
[1:37:16] and begin to tie this scripture to my
[1:37:19] brother daniel
[1:37:21] and say some demons go not out but by
[1:37:25] prayer and fasting
[1:37:27] and so i want to encourage
[1:37:31] whoever wants to let's as a body of
[1:37:34] believers pray and fast for our brother
[1:37:36] daniel
[1:37:39] he's not in a position where you can say
[1:37:42] stop having bad thoughts he can't stop
[1:37:44] having those thoughts
[1:37:46] he's not in a position where you can say
[1:37:47] would just just do this and just do that
[1:37:49] don't go give daniel any advice none of
[1:37:51] your advice is going to work that's not
[1:37:53] what he needs what he needs is
[1:37:54] deliverance
[1:37:56] and if somebody brought an infant to us
[1:37:58] you wouldn't look at this infant said if
[1:38:00] you just believed you'd be well
[1:38:01] you would believe for the infant if one
[1:38:04] of our brothers was laying unconscious
[1:38:06] in the icu right now
[1:38:08] amen and he was totally incapacity you
[1:38:10] wouldn't walk up next to him and say
[1:38:11] if you would just believe just believe
[1:38:13] and you'll be free no you have to
[1:38:15] believe for them
[1:38:17] you as the brother you have to exercise
[1:38:20] your faith in belief for the one who
[1:38:21] can't believe for themselves
[1:38:23] brother branham often times in the
[1:38:24] prayer line would have a woman that
[1:38:25] would come along
[1:38:26] and in one case he had a woman come with
[1:38:28] an alcoholic husband amen and brother
[1:38:30] branham says will you believe
[1:38:31] for your husband he says if you'll
[1:38:35] believe for your husband
[1:38:36] amen he'll be free and he'll get over
[1:38:38] that
[1:38:40] you couldn't ask the alcoholic husband
[1:38:42] to believe for himself the wife was
[1:38:43] going to believe for the husband
[1:38:45] and there's situations that we have to
[1:38:47] believe for one another
[1:38:48] and then we would not we wouldn't have a
[1:38:50] question if somebody was incapacitated
[1:38:53] amen but in many ways because of the
[1:38:55] torment in brother daniel's mind
[1:38:57] he's in such a state many times and he
[1:38:59] needs us to believe
[1:39:00] for him he's believing i've had long
[1:39:04] talks with him he's believing he's
[1:39:05] making a positive confession
[1:39:07] he know he's going to get better someday
[1:39:09] somehow amen but
[1:39:10] he he cannot control what's going on in
[1:39:13] his body and in his mind
[1:39:14] and he needs brothers and sisters and
[1:39:17] and besides this
[1:39:18] when jesus said some go out not by
[1:39:21] prayer and fasting
[1:39:22] he wasn't talking about the epileptic
[1:39:24] child praying and fasting
[1:39:27] he was talking about the one that was
[1:39:28] doing the praying
[1:39:31] he wasn't saying if that child would
[1:39:33] have prayed and fasted
[1:39:34] no but christ was always in a state of
[1:39:36] prayer and fasting and faith to believe
[1:39:38] for all things so when they brought the
[1:39:40] child to him he could cast them out
[1:39:41] amen but but the disciples he said
[1:39:43] because of your unbelief and if you look
[1:39:45] in the margin your bible
[1:39:46] says small faith because of your small
[1:39:50] faith
[1:39:50] amen you have to come to a higher level
[1:39:53] amen and this one comes not out but by
[1:39:55] prayer and fasting
[1:39:57] and he wasn't admonishing the boy or his
[1:40:01] dad
[1:40:02] but the one doing the praying to pray
[1:40:05] and fast and so i just had it in my
[1:40:09] heart
[1:40:09] to bring this to the church because
[1:40:12] we're a body
[1:40:14] we are a unit that god has put together
[1:40:18] and when one suffers we all suffer one
[1:40:21] rejoices
[1:40:22] we all rejoice we have to have the same
[1:40:24] care
[1:40:25] one of another and there's one member of
[1:40:27] this body who's suffering terribly bad
[1:40:30] horribly bad and he needs the rest of
[1:40:33] the body to come into action
[1:40:36] and i don't know the answer i don't i
[1:40:38] can't say
[1:40:39] thus it the lord god told me this or god
[1:40:41] told me that
[1:40:42] but if there's some that go out not by
[1:40:44] prayer and fasting
[1:40:45] i don't know which ones there are he
[1:40:48] didn't live and leave us a list let's
[1:40:50] say well epilepsy is only by prayer and
[1:40:51] fasting and this one's only by this
[1:40:53] and this one's by this method here i
[1:40:54] don't always know the method
[1:40:56] but i know if there's some that go out
[1:40:57] by prayer and fasting i'm willing to
[1:40:59] pray and fast to see if this is one of
[1:41:01] those that go out by praying and fasting
[1:41:03] because i know there's certain devils
[1:41:05] that require praying
[1:41:07] and fasting and so i would just
[1:41:10] encourage you i'm not asking the whole
[1:41:11] church because there's no point in doing
[1:41:13] this if you don't have faith for it or
[1:41:14] if you don't feel moved or inspired to
[1:41:16] do it but
[1:41:17] i'm preaching tonight amen you feel an
[1:41:19] inspiration in your heart
[1:41:21] and you want to pray and fast with
[1:41:22] brother daniel i say pray and fast let's
[1:41:24] pray and fast as a body for him whoever
[1:41:26] catches inspiration
[1:41:28] let's intercede on behalf of our brother
[1:41:30] we need to believe
[1:41:31] for him and ask god to cast this devil
[1:41:35] over him
[1:41:35] and heal him heal his mind heal his body
[1:41:38] chemistry
[1:41:39] and guard him against any other attacks
[1:41:44] because the word works friends the word
[1:41:46] will not fail
[1:41:48] the word absolutely will work
[1:41:51] and i see something in the word that
[1:41:52] god's drawn my attention to
[1:41:54] and i'm going to go after that word
[1:41:56] because god's drawn my attention to it
[1:41:59] i'd also like to say we have prayer time
[1:42:01] every saturday
[1:42:02] here in the sanctuary saturday from 3 to
[1:42:05] 10.
[1:42:06] and this saturday i'd like to dedicate
[1:42:08] to prayer for daniel
[1:42:10] we can pray for anything else we want to
[1:42:12] pray for too and not everybody has to
[1:42:13] come
[1:42:14] but if you can make it if you can be
[1:42:15] here to pray between three and ten
[1:42:18] any time you can come in pray for as
[1:42:20] long as you like come and go we're not
[1:42:21] having any
[1:42:22] specific meeting time it's open for that
[1:42:25] entire duration for people to slip and
[1:42:27] pray
[1:42:27] and leave as they need to but i'd like
[1:42:30] this saturday
[1:42:32] if we could be praying together for
[1:42:34] daniel pray the whole time up till then
[1:42:36] but saturday especially this prayer time
[1:42:39] if we could if you're inspired to if
[1:42:41] you're able to
[1:42:43] make it a time of prayer and fasting for
[1:42:46] daniel
[1:42:48] because i know this word works and i'm
[1:42:50] not giving up on it
[1:42:52] i'm not turning my back on it and i'm
[1:42:55] also not saying
[1:42:56] but whatever god wants will happen no
[1:42:58] i'm his agent on this earth
[1:42:59] and my brother needs a deliverance and
[1:43:01] i'm going to i'm going to go to
[1:43:03] sackcloth and ashes and prayer and
[1:43:05] fasting and say god my brother needs a
[1:43:07] deliverance right now
[1:43:09] he's tormented by devils he's tormented
[1:43:12] in his mind
[1:43:12] but he needs us to believe for him and
[1:43:14] god i'm believing for my brother daniel
[1:43:16] and i'm trusting you to set him free
[1:43:18] according to your word
[1:43:19] and we're applying all the word we know
[1:43:21] and even this word that you've drawn our
[1:43:22] attention to i'm applying that
[1:43:24] word too because i'm not giving up on
[1:43:27] the word and i'm not going to stop till
[1:43:29] i see the manifestation
[1:43:31] of the healing power of god in my
[1:43:33] brother's life because
[1:43:34] that's god's will what's his will his
[1:43:37] will
[1:43:38] is his word and brother bam said it's
[1:43:39] his will to heal you
[1:43:42] and i want to pray that until i see
[1:43:45] deliverance let's look at
[1:43:49] just two more scriptures and then we'll
[1:43:52] go
[1:43:53] acts chapter 12.
[1:44:02] god lay things in the scriptures for us
[1:44:05] and they'll lay there for years
[1:44:07] but they're laying there for the time
[1:44:09] you need it
[1:44:11] in acts chapter 12 verse 5
[1:44:15] says peter therefore was kept in prison
[1:44:20] but prayer was made without ceasing of
[1:44:23] the church unto god
[1:44:24] for him i don't know how many times that
[1:44:27] i've read this scripture
[1:44:29] and i always read it as the angel of the
[1:44:31] lord going
[1:44:32] and releasing peter out of prison but i
[1:44:35] missed the prerequisite statement
[1:44:38] i got to the miracle and the miracle was
[1:44:40] like oh
[1:44:41] the angel lord come in and his bands
[1:44:43] fell off of him
[1:44:44] all the soldiers were asleep the inner
[1:44:46] prison door opened the outer prison door
[1:44:48] he walked right out of jail but i missed
[1:44:51] the preceding statement
[1:44:55] he says the effort was
[1:44:59] peter therefore was kept in prison but
[1:45:01] prayer was made
[1:45:03] without ceasing of the church unto god
[1:45:06] for him what moved the angel of the lord
[1:45:10] friends
[1:45:10] what put the angel lord in action what
[1:45:12] sent the angel of the lord down to that
[1:45:14] prison cell
[1:45:15] the church was praying without ceasing
[1:45:17] for peter
[1:45:18] god put that there for a reason
[1:45:23] and when herod would have brought him
[1:45:25] forth the same night
[1:45:26] for him and found him not he examined
[1:45:29] the keepers and commanded
[1:45:30] that they should be put to death and he
[1:45:33] went down to judah to caesarea in their
[1:45:35] abode
[1:45:36] well i'm in a wrong spot sorry and herod
[1:45:39] would have brought him forth the same
[1:45:41] night
[1:45:41] peter was sleeping between two soldiers
[1:45:43] bound with two chains
[1:45:44] and the keepers before the door kept the
[1:45:46] prison and behold the angel of the lord
[1:45:48] came upon him and a light shining in the
[1:45:50] prison
[1:45:50] and he smote peter on the side and
[1:45:52] raised him up saying a rise up quickly
[1:45:55] and his chains fell off of him off from
[1:45:57] his hands
[1:45:58] and the angel said unto him gird thyself
[1:46:00] and bind on thy sandals
[1:46:02] and so he did and he saith unto him cast
[1:46:04] thy garments about thee and follow me
[1:46:07] and he went out and followed him and
[1:46:08] wists not that it was true which was
[1:46:10] done by the angel
[1:46:11] but thought he saw a vision when they
[1:46:14] were past
[1:46:15] when they were past the first and second
[1:46:17] ward they came into the
[1:46:18] iron gate that leadeth into the city
[1:46:20] which opened to them of his own accord
[1:46:23] and they went out and passed on through
[1:46:25] one street and forth with the angel
[1:46:26] departed from him
[1:46:28] and when peter was come to himself he
[1:46:29] said now i know of a surety that the
[1:46:31] lord has sent his angel
[1:46:33] and has delivered me out of the hand of
[1:46:34] herod and from all the expectations of
[1:46:37] the people the jews
[1:46:38] and when he had considered the thing he
[1:46:40] came to the house of mary the mother of
[1:46:42] john whose surname was mark
[1:46:43] where many were gathered together
[1:46:45] praying amen
[1:46:47] they were still praying amen the church
[1:46:50] was praying without ceasing for peter
[1:46:52] the prayers of the church move the angel
[1:46:55] of the lord and the action
[1:46:56] he goes down and they keep praying as
[1:46:58] the chains fall off they keep praying as
[1:47:00] the inner prison doors open they keep
[1:47:02] praying
[1:47:02] as the outer gate opens they pray all
[1:47:04] the way till peter himself
[1:47:06] knocks on the door they didn't give up
[1:47:08] to what they were praying for coming to
[1:47:10] fruition
[1:47:12] i say praise god let's pray and let's
[1:47:16] believe
[1:47:16] let's commit to god with all love
[1:47:19] praying in the spirit
[1:47:20] amen committing it to god knowing that
[1:47:22] god will keep his word
[1:47:24] amen let's turn to the book of james the
[1:47:27] last scripture i want to read
[1:47:29] you musicians you can make your way up
[1:47:33] james chapter 5.
[1:47:40] james chapter 5 verse 16
[1:47:47] it says confess your faults one to
[1:47:49] another and pray
[1:47:51] one for another that you may be
[1:47:54] healed the effectual fervent prayer
[1:47:58] of a righteous man availeth much
[1:48:03] james admonishes us to confess our
[1:48:05] faults to one another
[1:48:06] and pray for one another that we may
[1:48:10] be healed
[1:48:13] how many believe god's word how many
[1:48:16] beliefs have we committed to god with
[1:48:18] love and faith
[1:48:19] that god will keep his word we don't
[1:48:22] always have
[1:48:23] answers we don't sometimes we're like
[1:48:24] the disciples why lord this and why
[1:48:27] lord that we don't always know but but i
[1:48:30] know the word is true and i know the
[1:48:31] word will work
[1:48:34] and god has as has given a little
[1:48:36] inspiration in this scripture
[1:48:39] that some go out not by prayer and
[1:48:40] fasting there are some
[1:48:43] there are some stubborn devils there are
[1:48:44] some entrenched devils there are some
[1:48:46] difficult devils
[1:48:48] some devils are weak some devils are
[1:48:50] strong
[1:48:52] is that true yes there's a whole
[1:48:54] hierarchy
[1:48:56] i don't know i don't know the strength
[1:48:59] level of the devil we're facing
[1:49:01] but i know the power of the word i know
[1:49:04] the power of god to keep his word
[1:49:06] and it doesn't matter what strength
[1:49:08] level of devil we're facing
[1:49:09] and if it requires fair prayer and
[1:49:11] fasting so be it we'll pray and fast but
[1:49:13] this devil's going to go it has to go
[1:49:16] because the word of god says so
[1:49:19] i believe i believe
[1:49:23] and i'm going to put my faith in action
[1:49:24] and pray
[1:49:26] i'm going to expect a testimony
[1:49:29] we pray and maybe one little grain of
[1:49:31] sand falls it doesn't matter
[1:49:33] 21 days maybe you see no change it
[1:49:34] doesn't matter because the angel of the
[1:49:36] lord is dispatched at the prayer amen
[1:49:38] things begin to move in the heavenly
[1:49:40] realms i like to imagine that that
[1:49:42] devil that's entrenched that that mental
[1:49:44] illness devil that's tormenting and
[1:49:46] strength
[1:49:46] i just can imagine that he gets buffeted
[1:49:49] and buffeted and buffeted and he loses
[1:49:51] one finger amen and he keeps getting hit
[1:49:53] by the church and prayer and fasting he
[1:49:54] loses another finger amen and he loses
[1:49:57] another
[1:49:57] and he's got a little pinky hold amen
[1:49:59] but we don't give up and keep praying
[1:50:01] until finally he's gone and he can't
[1:50:03] hold on anymore
[1:50:04] why because the people of god believed
[1:50:06] god and acted like agents on the earth
[1:50:09] amen to put the heavens and the motion
[1:50:11] to begin to bring the word of god to
[1:50:13] pass
[1:50:15] i believe it that way i believe
[1:50:18] it's got to go you know
[1:50:22] the elijah went to prayer amen when it
[1:50:24] was time for it to begin to rain
[1:50:26] he prayed and he looked no rain prayed
[1:50:28] and he looked in the rain
[1:50:30] prayed and he looked he didn't stop
[1:50:32] until he saw the cloud
[1:50:34] brother branham went to pray amen he
[1:50:37] went to to
[1:50:38] pray for that little girl and i don't
[1:50:39] even remember her name my brother
[1:50:41] went in to pray and she didn't get
[1:50:42] healed amen and he come back later and
[1:50:44] checked on her and everything was the
[1:50:45] way it was
[1:50:46] early on in his ministry finally he went
[1:50:48] to the woods and when he went to the
[1:50:49] woods
[1:50:50] and got down and got serious and the
[1:50:52] dinner belt was ringing and he ignored
[1:50:53] the dinner bell
[1:50:54] stickers at his knees and all kinds of
[1:50:56] stuff he had to push through
[1:50:57] to pray when he finally pushed through
[1:50:59] in prayer god showed him a vision when
[1:51:01] he showed the vision he got up and he
[1:51:02] ran to the house and it was exactly like
[1:51:04] god told him and she was delivered
[1:51:06] praise the lord why didn't it happen the
[1:51:09] first time he marched
[1:51:10] i don't know why did it have to go
[1:51:11] through all that i have no idea
[1:51:13] but the point is brother branham knew
[1:51:15] that girl was going to be healed and he
[1:51:16] stuck with it until she was healed
[1:51:21] i know by faith my brother's gonna go
[1:51:23] free and i'm willing to stick with it
[1:51:24] till he goes free
[1:51:26] i know he's gonna be delivered because
[1:51:27] god's word is true it's real it's
[1:51:30] powerful
[1:51:30] it's going to manifest this is the time
[1:51:33] this is the age for the full
[1:51:34] manifestation of the full word of god
[1:51:37] and i'm willing to stick with it until
[1:51:39] it comes to pass
[1:51:41] and i want to encourage as many of you
[1:51:43] who feel led to do so
[1:51:44] to do the same when we're praying for
[1:51:47] our brother and praying for his family
[1:51:49] for strength
[1:51:50] his parents are all so tired it's been a
[1:51:52] long hard battle for them too
[1:51:54] pray for them for strength and wisdom
[1:51:58] and then pray for the rest of the saints
[1:51:59] around the world because it's a
[1:52:01] troubling time it's a difficult time
[1:52:04] for assemblies in tennessee and
[1:52:06] assemblies in louisiana
[1:52:08] and wichita kansas it's a difficult time
[1:52:11] overseas
[1:52:13] but we're supposed to pray for one
[1:52:14] another we're supposed to
[1:52:17] uphold one another and pray for one
[1:52:18] another and believe
[1:52:21] that when we pray things move
[1:52:24] don't just pray and get up and say well
[1:52:27] we'll see what happens
[1:52:28] don't see what happens know what's going
[1:52:30] to happen i don't know how it'll happen
[1:52:31] but it'll happen
[1:52:32] because when i prayed something moved
[1:52:34] because i prayed according to the word
[1:52:36] with the right motive and the right
[1:52:38] objective with love in my heart for the
[1:52:40] brethren
[1:52:41] something will move
[1:52:44] god let's all stand
[1:52:53] i'm even willing to say
[1:52:56] i believe helped out my unbelief
[1:53:00] i'm even willing to get on my knees and
[1:53:02] say god i believe for brother daniel
[1:53:04] help
[1:53:04] my unbelief because he's got to go free
[1:53:10] whatever it takes i'm willing to confess
[1:53:12] my faults one to another
[1:53:14] and pray for each other that'll be
[1:53:16] healed whatever it takes i'm sticking
[1:53:18] with it till the word comes to pass
[1:53:21] because it's got to come to pass
[1:53:25] don't don't ever let the devil
[1:53:28] dupe you into thinking well i'm just
[1:53:31] this or i'm just that
[1:53:33] no you're just an offspring of god
[1:53:34] that's all
[1:53:36] but i'm only this and i'm only that and
[1:53:38] i'm only that you're just an offspring
[1:53:40] of god you're one of god's children
[1:53:42] that probably isn't much right to be a
[1:53:45] child of god is everything to be
[1:53:47] offspring of god
[1:53:48] amen to be part of god with god's nature
[1:53:50] in life and you is everything friends
[1:53:52] it doesn't matter if you have a title a
[1:53:54] position money or house
[1:53:55] amen you are an eternal being amen
[1:53:58] predestinated see gene of god amen when
[1:54:00] you pray by
[1:54:02] faith in the word of god things in the
[1:54:04] heavenly realms begin to move because of
[1:54:06] who you are
[1:54:07] it has nothing to do with an earthly
[1:54:08] position i'm not a pastor i'm not a
[1:54:10] deacon i'm not of this i'm not
[1:54:12] it doesn't matter if you're 10 years old
[1:54:14] amen if you've got faith in the word of
[1:54:16] god and will pray with faith
[1:54:17] things will begin to move don't
[1:54:20] discount who you are don't discount this
[1:54:23] word don't discount what god has brought
[1:54:25] us tonight
[1:54:25] let's band ourselves together and let's
[1:54:28] together
[1:54:28] fight this devil until he loses his hold
[1:54:33] let's pray for one another let's love
[1:54:36] one another
[1:54:38] when you get down on your knees to pray
[1:54:40] for daniel let love project
[1:54:43] because that's our brother we were
[1:54:46] together in the mind of god before the
[1:54:48] foundation of the world
[1:54:49] and we're going back together and he's
[1:54:50] tormented and he's being crippled and
[1:54:52] limited
[1:54:53] in his ability to express in this life
[1:54:55] and i know god's going to set him free
[1:54:57] because there's gifts that are bound up
[1:54:58] in that young man
[1:54:59] that have to come and the devil's
[1:55:01] attacking him so hard because those
[1:55:03] things will be such a threat to his
[1:55:04] kingdom
[1:55:07] and i'm not going to stand by and watch
[1:55:09] them get pummeled and pummeled in public
[1:55:11] but i'm
[1:55:11] entering the fight stand with my brother
[1:55:16] man that he'll lose his grip and my
[1:55:20] brother will go free
[1:55:23] man will you pray with me let's bow our
[1:55:25] heads
