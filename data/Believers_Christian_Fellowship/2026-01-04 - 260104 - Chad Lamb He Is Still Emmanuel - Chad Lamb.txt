[music] Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads together this morning. Lord Jesus, [music] we thank you, Father, for bringing us together once again. For, Father, it's your drawing power that brings [music] us to yourself. We're so thankful, Lord, that you have called and we have responded. And Lord, we want you to have your way amongst us now, Lord, [music] as we've sung the song, may it become a living reality. May you come on the scene, Lord, and may you have your way in each of our lives. May you use the the the word, Lord, to direct us, to shape us, Lord, to to carve the stone out into the shape that you predestinated us for us to be in, Lord, that you might magnify yourself and be glorified in this [music] place today and be glorified and magnified in our lives, Lord, as we [music] leave this place. We love you. We ask, God, that you would take this vessel of mine under your control and may you use it for your glory as I [music] surrender to your hand. And may you give us all ears to hear and a heart to perceive all that you have for us to this this day. [music] For God, we feel privileged to be here, to hear your word preach, to sing the songs of Zion. God, we thank you that we ask you would take preeminence among us, Lord, and have [music] your way. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. It's good to be here. Amen. I I trust 2026 has been treating you good so far. And if it hasn't, don't tell me. I just want to hear good news. Amen. Let's just stay positive. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's good to be together this Sunday, the first Sunday of 2026. Amen. I just um want to remind you that there will be no communion or feet washing today. We usually do it the first Sunday of the month, but because of the watch night service on Wednesday, we have communion and so there won't be today. And I just want to say how much I enjoyed the watch night service. That was such a blessing. I enjoyed, you know, everybody's contribution, the songs, the rejoicing, the testimonies. It was quite a blessing. Amen. So, we thank God for that. Also, I appreciate sister Susan, your testimony. That was a real blessing. And uh thank you, brother Gabe, for sharing that testimony, brother Wooley. It's so encouraging to see that he's the same yesterday, today. And for we believe it, but every time it manifests, it thrills our souls. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, God is good. And while we're standing, if you could turn with me to the book of Isaiah, and we'll go to Isaiah chapter 7. Amen. It's good to see Brother Randy and Sister Anna Lungsford with us. And thank you for the song, Sister Anna. We appreciate it very much. It's always good to have you visiting. Amen. We have a few other visitors here. We have the Take family visiting. Sister Melody, Sister Beth, and Brother Michael back here. God bless you. It's good to have you here with us. Amen. And many of you will know Brother Chris T who's ministered several times. These are his siblings here. I'm sorry you have to be known by association, but but we love brother Chris, so I'm it's good for us. Amen. Uh but sister Melody has felt led of the Lord to move here. She's moved to Lima. She's moving this uh tomorrow, I believe, and uh going to be joining the assembly and fellowship. So, we want to welcome her as well. So, God bless you very much. Amen. Praise the Lord. God is good. Any other visitors we have, we're glad you're with us. Amen. And hope that you feel very welcome. and just rejoice in the Lord with us. Amen. Isaiah 7:14. I'm going to go back to uh the service I preached uh uh I think it was before Christmas, but I don't remember now. And I started with this scripture. And so I'm I'm going to continue on with that thought. Says in uh Isaiah 7:14, "Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. And behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel. Now, if you could turn with me to the book of Matthew and Matthew chapter 1. Matthew chapter 1 and verse 19 verse 18 sorry verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph Joseph, thou son of David. Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife. For that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost, and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emanuel which being interpreted is God with us. Amen. God bless you as you take your seats. Amen. May the Lord's blessing be upon us as we look into his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Without his blessing, we just are reading. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we need his blessing and we need the divine revelation from the father. Amen. To to open to us the scriptures and to open our understanding to understand the scriptures. Now that service previously that I'm referring to a couple services back, amen. I preached on the subject Emmanuel and how God was with us and he took on a form of flesh and became our brother. And it was God, amen, making his own body to live and reflecting himself in human flesh. And he was God with us. Amen. And so it was a blessing to me the thought and I appreciated it. And at that time I had some more that I wanted to minister on that, but uh I I was going to maybe bring it Sunday, but then by before we got to Sunday, the subject of the bitter waters made sweet was burning me up and I couldn't. I had to preach that. And then we come to watch night and I had a different thought for watch night. But then after watch night, all of a sudden the inspiration came back and I'm going to go back. So if we could pull up the PowerPoint, uh if we could bring that up. I want to preach on he is still Emanuel. &gt;&gt; He is still Emanuel. Amen. And we want to look at things related to the day and age that we're living in. Amen. Because that's the revelation of the hour that that gives us life. It's the revelation of the hour, Amen, that gives us instruction. It's the revelation of the hour, Amen, that quickens the seed on the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. It It's amazing to me how brother Brandon began to teach us this concept, Amen. Amen. And he began to share with us, amen, that it's the light of the age, amen, that quickens the seed. It's the water for that age, amen, that's made to quicken the seed for that age. And and and praise God, God sent us a prophet in this day to fulfill to fulfill the scriptures, to fulfill the prophecy. Amen. that he would peel back the scriptures and bring a revelation of the word, a light, a bright and shining light because there was going to be seed on the earth at that time that needed a certain water of the word and a certain dispensational light so that they could come to life and that was you and I. &gt;&gt; And God would make sure the light was here and the water was here when you and I were here. Amen. Because that was what was necessary to bring us to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we I [laughter] absolutely love the message of the hour. It is Christ. &gt;&gt; It is life. Listen, it's not books and tapes. It's not print on paper. It's not recorded sermons. It is none other than Jesus Christ speaking love secrets to his spouse, to his bride, to his wife. It's him unveiling himself to her. And listen, this message isn't for everybody. Amen. And we don't say that arrogantly. We don't say that in condemnation because if it's not for everybody, it's the other people's, you know, it's not for them. and they don't have eyes to see and ears to hear. That's okay. &gt;&gt; That's all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a plan for those individuals as well. God has a way, amen, for them also. There can be salvation. Amen. Because God is so good. Because the blood of Jesus Christ purchased all creation. And he's the Lord of Lords and King of Kings. When he sits on the throne, he can give life to who he wants and allow entrance into the kingdom to whosoever he will because he now is the ruler and owner. Amen. and dispenser of all life. He can at the white throne judgment pardon and grant mercy and he will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for that. Amen. So God has a way. Amen. For the peoples of the earth. If they can respect God's people, THEY RESPECT GOD'S WAY and respect God's word. God has a way. &gt;&gt; But the message of the hour, Amen, is for the elect bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she has ears to hear. Amen. And it's the very thing that gives her life. It's the very thing that gives her vision. It's the very thing that sets her feet on the right path. AMEN. AND WITHOUT THAT, we're wandering in the wilderness. It takes the message and nothing but the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And so, I'm thankful for it. I'm thankful God gave it to us. &gt;&gt; It is Christ to me. &gt;&gt; It's not another way of believing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's the only way of believing. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And I don't mean that derogatory because I I just I hope I just explained myself. But for the elect, it's the only way of believing. It's the path to life. It's the truth. It's the way. It's Jesus Christ in our day unveiling himself to us. &gt;&gt; So I love it with a love that's beyond human. I I have a passion for with a passion that's beyond me. &gt;&gt; Man, it's [clears throat] gone. &gt;&gt; And so I want to look at this subject of he is still Emanuel. And I just pray that God will just anoint Amen. bring an anointing to anoint the gift that's in me so I can get out of the way so that he can minister because I'll tell you right now, I've got too much material and too many quotes and too many scripture, too many things. Amen. But praise God, I don't know. I have still not figured out how to do this. All I know how to do is come and stand here. Amen. With what God's laid on my heart and trust that God will work through the body to pull on the gift and his spirit will bring the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're dependent upon each other today. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Colossians 2:9, he says, "For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, that was in Jesus Christ, God had poured himself, amen, in a full measure, his full life, and he was the fullness of the Godhead in one body, &gt;&gt; the body of Jesus Christ." But in testimony upon the sea, the prophet says, "All that God was, he poured into Christ. He was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And all that Christ was, he poured into his church. That day you'll know that I'm in the Father, the Father in me, I in you, and you in me. See, it's God. It was God above us. It was God with us and God in us. See what I mean? There it is. The same God. And brother Bam talks about this in many, many places. And he said in the in the days of the Old Testament when Israel, Amen, was moving and progressing in their journey, amen, he was God above them. He was the pillar of fire. He He was uh the cloud by day and the fire by night. He was the shakina of glory that went in behind the veil. It was God above them. Amen. But when he came and became Jesus Christ, it was God with us. A brethren, a a God in flesh like we are in flesh. It was God with us. Amen. But then the dispensation after that became God in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I know my title is God is still Emanuel, which means God with us. But I hope you'll just bear with me and we'll get to that in just a minute. He is in us, but he's in us and with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's what he said in Matthew 28. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing, baptizing them in the name of Father and Son and Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, &gt;&gt; even into the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's promised to still be with his disciples. He was departing. Amen. But he was going to come again. And he said, "I am with you always." He is still God with us. &gt;&gt; Even to the end of the world. How is that God with us? He's in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 13:5, he says, "Let your conversation be without covetness, and be content with such things as you have, for he saith, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." &gt;&gt; Let's turn to John 14 together and read this scripture together. I'm going to move quickly through this first section of scriptures and quotes and and it's laying again a foundation and bringing us all to the same page, the same thinking so I can move to the next step. And we look at John 14:1 18 says, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; I love that. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come. Who's speaking? Jesus Christ. I will come to you. Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, but ye see me because I live, ye shall live also. At that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Brother Bam said, making them all one. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he takes this scripture and uses it many times when he said, "All that God was, he poured into Christ. And all that Christ was, he poured into the church." Now, let's skip down to verse 23. Jesus answered and said unto him, "If a man loved me, he will keep my words, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him." Who's the we? The father and the son. Amen. He said we. There's a fullness that's coming back again. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's look at this in the in the quotes and in the scriptures. Notice then [clears throat and cough] then we become part of him as you are the veil that veils him. You are part of him as long as Christ is in you as Christ was of God. Because God was in him made him God. And as Christ is in you the hope of glory. You become part of Christ. He that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also see. You become part of Christ as long as Christ is hid in you. Then it's veiled to the unbeliever. But you know he's in you. You are templing Christ that's behind the veil the skin. Then be behind because of this veil the veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever. So where is he? Amen. He went into the people. He went into the believer and he's behind the veil. What veil? Human flesh veil. But it's God. It's the same one that said, "I will not leave you comfortless, but I will come to you." Amen. My father, if you keep my words, my father will love you and and we will come into you. &gt;&gt; And make our abode with you. Amen. You'll be the dwelling place. Amen. For the life of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever. He says uh in 1 Corinthians, "Know you not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Colossians 1 says, "Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I think we're seeing the picture. Where is the temple? Where is the veil? Where is the tabernacle? Where is his tent? Amen. Where is he hiding? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in you. &gt;&gt; That's the mystery among the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother B says, "Now God over us, God with us, now God in us. All that God was, he poured into Christ. All that Christ was, he poured into the church. At that day, you'll know that I'm in the Father, the Father in me, I in you and you in me." So it's been God all along. You see his same works. The church is ordained to carry on the work with the same spirit. So it's the same life, the same spirit, the same God. Amen. That was in Christ. The same Christ that's now in us. Amen. Continuing on his work because he's veiled behind human flesh. &gt;&gt; He was veiled behind the flesh of Jesus Christ. But now he's veiled behind the flesh of a many membered body. &gt;&gt; Keep looking at this. God was bottled and confined in one man, Jesus Christ, but now he's bottled and confined in the whole universal church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So where is he? &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what brother Bam is saying. GOD WHEN HE GOD POURED HIMSELF into Christ. Amen. He poured his whole life into Christ. And now God was bottled and confined. Amen. In one man, Jesus Christ. And now, brother Benham's telling us, amen, that that same life has been poured out once again and come into THE CHURCH. AND NOW HE'S BOTTLED AND confined in the whole universal church of the living God. So it's not you that has all of Christ, BUT ALL OF CHRIST HAS COME BACK INTO A BODY. &gt;&gt; Not me as an individual. I don't have it all. AMEN. BUT GOD HAS A BODY that he has POURED HIS LIFE INTO in this end time &gt;&gt; AND IT'S ON EARTH. Praise God. Ephesians chapter 1, he says, "Which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him on his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come. and he hath put all things under his feet, and give him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all. I broke this down before, but I'm going to break it down again today because brother Brandham is a scriptural prophet. There's nothing that he's saying that doesn't come from the Bible. When he said, "All that God was, he poured into Christ." Amen. That's in the scripture. He was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And when he says all that Christ was, he poured into the church, that's also a scriptural statement. Even though he's not quoting verbatim the scripture, he's quoting the scripture. &gt;&gt; CUZ HE'S A SCRIPTURAL PROPHET. EVERY CONCEPT HE TEACHES, every doctrine HE TEACHES IS THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand's not making stuff up. AMEN. HE'S JUST EXPRESSING HIS REVELATION OF THE word and the WAY THAT HE EXPRESSES IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; So he made he gave him Christ to be head over all things to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is his body. What's his body? The church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fullness. &gt;&gt; What's the fullness of him that filth all in all? The fullness is the body, &gt;&gt; which is the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is where brother Brandham gets his teaching. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; FROM PAUL. HE SAID WHEN HE WENT BEYOND THE CURTAIN OF TIME, HE TAUGHT WHAT PAUL TAUGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's exactly where this comes from. Amen. This isn't this isn't new to the message. Amen. This has been in Christianom from the very beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what God wanted at the very beginning. THIS IS WHY, AMEN. HE SENT THE Holy Ghost in THE BEGINNING. THAT'S WHY THERE WAS A DAY OF PENTECOST. THAT'S WHY HE SHED HIS BLOOD. THIS IS WHAT HE'S ALWAYS WANTED TO DO. THIS has been his plan since before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a new concept. &gt;&gt; He says, "What's his purpose now? Express himself as a son." See, and now that in him might dwell the fullness of the Godhead bodily, I'll give I've got Colossians laying here right before me. See that? All through the scripture, that's what God's purpose was. Then through this life of his son, his cross, the blood says here of his cross, that he might reconcile to himself a body, a bride which is Eve, the second Eve. So he came and through the shedding of his blood, HE RECONCILED BACK A BODY, AMEN, A BRIDE, AMEN, so that he could get he could cross over, amen, the sin barrier and move into his people because there had to be an atonement made for sin, a price paid for the washing away of sin so that he could bridge the gap and come back into fellowship in humanity. &gt;&gt; And and Christ is the mystery again. He says, "Now see the whole three-fold purpose. See, to express himself. So, I want you to get this. The whole three-fold purpose is to EXPRESS HIMSELF. GOD'S EXPRESSING HIMSELF. GOD'S DISPLAYING his attributes. God's bringing himself into manifestation to be seen, to become tangible, to be understood. And he did it with a three-fold purpose. His original plan was in Eden. And he showed there what his masterpiece was, a masterpiece family, a man and a a son of God and his bride ruling over the earth. And he gave us the snapshot, the picture. And then Satan came in and ruined it. And it fell. The masterpiece fell into ruin. But he began again rebuilding the masterpiece. And to do it, he's got to bring back the last Adam. He did that in Christ Jesus. But the masterpiece isn't finished till it's a masterpiece family. &gt;&gt; So from Christ came the elements, the the the life and the blood, the word, and the life. Amen. To build a bride. And at the end time, at the end of the seven dispensations of the church age, HE'S BRINGING THEM BACK INTO unity again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We realize that this is what God was pouring himself out into the church on the day of Pentecost when the logos came into the room as a rushing mighty wind and the pillar of fire broke up, amen, into 120 licks of fire, amen, and he went into the people and and the and the visible display was the fire over their heads. They began to speak in tongues. They spilled out of the upper room. Amen. And what were they doing when they come out? They were telling people, "This is that." Amen. Peter was saying, "This is that WHICH WHICH THE PROPHET JOEL SAID, THIS IS THE HOUR. This is the dispensation. This is the time we've been waiting for." &gt;&gt; They were given a life. Amen. The life of Christ to boldly proclaim the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they were given the revelation of the truth. But that was a that was a a a Jewish dispensation. Everybody in the upper room were Jews. But God wanted a gentile bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he began to move, Amen. from the Jews, from from this new birth experience into this and to his the quickening power of sons and daughters of God being brought to life by the power of of the Holy Ghost. He began to move out and branch out and in Antioch and in different places he began to branch out to the Gentiles until finally he sent Paul and Barnabas. Amen. And Paul went out with a commission to be a light unto the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; And when he gets to a place where the Jews now are rejecting the gospel, he says it was expedient that it should first be preached unto you. Amen. But seeing that you count yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. Because from before the foundation of the world, he was going to take a bride from the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; HE SHOWED IT IN TYPES AND SHADOWS all through the Old Testament. But he's going to take a bride from the Gentiles. So all of this has to transpire. So he begins TO CALL A BRIDE OUT OF THE GENTILES. AMEN. And Paul is THE MESSENGER, THE APOSTLE TO THE GENTILES. He is the light to the Gentiles. He's there bringing the truth, amen, of of grace to the Gentiles and they're being called out and they're coming. AMEN. BUT BEFORE HE could come to the marriage, amen, she had already fallen away by moving away from the teachings and uh doctrines of the apostles and started taking men's ideas and mixing it in. And she was already a fallen woman before he ever got to her. &gt;&gt; And that started, Amen. the church ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did he know it was going to happen? Yes, &gt;&gt; because he had a seven sealed book from before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; that contained the whole mystery of it. &gt;&gt; But it didn't change his mind. It didn't stop what he wanted. He still wanted a gentile bride. And he wanted her to come back to that full measure of his life like he had poured out at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; And that's why he sent a prophet. And that's why he opened the seals. And that's why he's done what he's done is so that he can get his life back into his gentile bride in fullness. &gt;&gt; Brother Rem said they had a dip in the spirit in Luther's day. They had a dip in the spirit in Wesley's day. They had a dip in Pentecost. But that's not what he wants. He wants to pour himself out again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into a body to have preeminence. And what's he doing? Expressing himself. Now the world is lost. Now he has to express himself in a man to become a savior through the reconciliation of blood from the cross. Now he had to become that to die in order to save and to bring himself back into the church to have preeminence in his church. So he did that so he could get back into people back into that fellowship and that way he could express himself. Amen. Brother goes on to say, "All that God was, he poured into Christ because he emptied himself and poured it into Christ. And Christ was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. All that Jehovah was, he poured into Christ. And all that Christ was, he poured into the church. Not into one individual, but into the entire body. There we come together in unity, we have power." &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what I want to talk about here for just a minute. He poured it not not into the individual, &gt;&gt; but into the entire body, &gt;&gt; that means you and I don't have a corner on all of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Neither's one person or one family or one assembly of believers. Amen. It's a universal. The entire body, he's poured himself out into that. And praise God. That's why we can't run off into isolation and just say, "I've got it and I'm going to do it and just me and my household, we're going to sit at home and we're we're going to do this and amen." Listen, you can't you can't get his fullness that way. You need your brothers and sisters because God's given us a portion, a measure, and we need one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we He's He's poured HIMSELF OUT IN FULLNESS. ABSOLUTELY. We come to the day where the the seals have been removed. The barrier IS GONE. HE'S BACK AND FULLNESS BACK IN his church. Amen. But it's the entire body. And that's WHY WE CAN'T CUT PORTIONS off and cut fellowship out and refuse to have fellowship with people and all of these other things. Hey, listen. We can't HAVE THAT ATTITUDE BECAUSE I NEED CHRIST. I WANT ALL OF CHRIST. And Emanuel is still here. AMEN. HE'S HERE. GOD WITH US. AMEN. This is why I can say God is still with us because GOD IS IN US. BUT HE'S IN ME AND HE'S UNLOCKED A PORTION OF THAT LIFE TO ME. BUT IF I WANT FULLNESS OF EMANUEL, I NEED YOU, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; And you and you and you and YOU BECAUSE HE'S HERE. HE'S STILL WITH US. HE'S IN A MANY membered body. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHERE EVERY JOINT IS BROUGHT TOGETHER TO SUPPLY FOR the effectual working together OF ITSELF IN LOVE. AMEN. SO WE'RE ALL BUILT UP INTO UNITY AND COME INTO THE fullness of THE STATURE OF CHRIST. THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE TO EXPRESS HIM. BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO EXPRESS ALL OF HIM. AND I'M not going to express ALL OF HIM. I WILL EXPRESS AN ATTRIBUTE OF HIM, A PORTION of him, what he designated for me. BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US TO EXPRESS HIM. &gt;&gt; SO, we need one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need one another. And it's amazing how the devil gets in and makes the very thing we need for the full expression of Christ sometimes the hardest thing to deal with. Because if you're going to deal with human beings, you're going to deal with issues. &gt;&gt; Does anybody believe that? &gt;&gt; Well, not the children of God. There'll be no issues. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You should be a pastor for a month. Brother Benham said, "We all have a sticky, cocka nature." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's going to bother us till we get out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes your sticky cocka burner nature poked me. &gt;&gt; And if you poke me, I want to run away and hide so I don't get poked again. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever felt that way? &gt;&gt; Of course. &gt;&gt; Because if you're dealing with human beings that are still in a hybrid flesh, there's issues. with one another, &gt;&gt; forgiving one another, being patient with one. Why did Paul tell us all of that if we've already come into perfection? &gt;&gt; Why do we have to forebear one another? Why do we have to be patient? Why do we have to patiently love one another? Why do we need brotherly love? &gt;&gt; We should just come into agape love and it's all perfect. Listen, we're still human beings and we've got to put up with one another and bear with one another. Why? Because it's a many membered body, not a single many membered body. I am not fine by myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz he didn't give me all of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He only gave me a portion. &gt;&gt; But he's still Emanuel. &gt;&gt; He's still with us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; when you're fellowshipping with a brother and you're you're sharing the word with one another, what kind of communion is that? &gt;&gt; And who are you really communing with? What life is trapped inside that brother or sister? Who who who is it? What is it that I'm enjoying so much? Maybe it's him &gt;&gt; in you and in him and in her. Amen. Coming together to fellowship to manifest the life of Christ. So he didn't pour the whole thing out in just me. He didn't pour the whole thing out in just us, &gt;&gt; but he poured it out in the church, the bride. Universal. Brother Beam says, "All of us know that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself. Now we know that Christ Jesus, the fullness of the Godhead bodily, dwells in him. But to us, we have the spirit by measure given to each one to profit with all." Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So you have He's given to us the spirit by measure to profit with all. &gt;&gt; Amen. That means he didn't give you the spirit by measure to profit you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He gave you the spirit by measure to profit everybody else. &gt;&gt; But the measure he gave them is to profit you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I think God designed it this way because he wants to manifest in a body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, but say for instance, if I went out here to the ocean and took a spoonful of water out of the ocean, you'd never miss it. See, but I could take that spoonful of water to the laboratory and it's got the same chemicals in that the entire ocean's got. It's just not as much of it. Well, when when we think of the spirit of Christ that we have in us, it's just a spoonful to what was in him, we had all he had all of it in him and and that God was poor. All that God was poured into Christ. All that Christ was, he poured into the church. So, Brother Bon says, "Go get you a little spoonful of the ocean. What you got is the ocean. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you got all of the you got all of the the properties, the possibilities, the potential of the ocean, but you've only got it in a small measure. &gt;&gt; That's what happens when we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. We've got the life of Christ, but he's given us a portion, and that portion is for a purpose to unlock an attribute that's already in the seed that he wants to express. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. But it doesn't mean that the whole ocean's not available. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And just because I have a spoonful, I don't have to make do with just a spoonful because God has poured the whole ocean out. Amen. And the whole ocean was poured into Christ. Amen. But all that Christ was WAS POURED WHERE? BACK into a many member body. The ocean is still available. The fullness is still here. Amen. Christ in full measure is still available. Amen. And it's in my brother. It's my sister. The portion that I need might be in you. Remember to one is given the gift of knowledge, another wisdom, another faith, another healing, another tongues, ANOTHER INTERPRETATIONS. WHY? HE THE SPIRIT DIVIDE SEVERALLY AS he will. Amen. So that we have a mutual dependency on one another because God wants to be expressed IN BRIDE FORM IN a many member body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND IT TAKES A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WHERE I HAVE TO benefit you and you have to benefit me. And sometimes the BENEFIT IS IRON SHARPENING IRON. &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says we should provoke one another to love and good works. &gt;&gt; Provoke means to go or to poke. &gt;&gt; LIKE WHEN AN OX IS PLOWING, you know, and he's, you know, he gets lazy, he stops, there's a little poker there on a stick and they'll poke him right behind the leg just to keep him moving. WE ALWAYS VIEW, I ALWAYS VIEW, HAVE ALWAYS have viewed, always view that provoking one another to love and good works would be something where, you know, a brother would come to you and say, "Oh man, you're doing a good job. We love you." You know, just keep at it, Brother Chad, and blah blah blah blah blah. You're the sweetest thing, nicest thing, handsomest thing, best thing. That encourages me. [laughter] But it may not just be the sweetness that provokes me to love and good works. But it might even be an irritation. It might even be a hurt. It might be something else that keeps me moving forward because I need more of Christ. Amen. I'm not going to overcome this without more of him, without more of his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God has given us a portion and that portion is real and that portion is powerful and that portion is Christ. &gt;&gt; But he hasn't given me the whole load. So I need you, you need me, we need one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Ephesians, he says, "Now therefore, you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God, and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom all the building fitly framed together growth into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit." I love this. I just I get so excited. Ye are builded together &gt;&gt; for a habitation of God. &gt;&gt; Not singular. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Together. &gt;&gt; You are the temple of the Holy Ghost. As an individual, you're the temple of the Holy Ghost. But when we talk about all of the Holy Ghost, now we're a building built together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Living stones built into a living tabernacle, a holy habitation for God to dwell in. &gt;&gt; That's us. He says in Ephesians 5, "For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones." We, and the Bible says somewhere else, we are members in particular. That means you're a particular member. You're not the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So you who thought you were great, God has a way of bringing us all into equity. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; In one way, yes, and another way, no. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; What's great is that God dwells in you. That's fantastic. &gt;&gt; But but where the where the need comes in is he's not poured all of himself into you, only a portion of himself into you. But if you want all of him, you need the rest of the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I think it's good he did it that way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it teaches us a lot of things that we need to know. &gt;&gt; And it brings us into the right attitude towards God, a right attitude towards our brother and sister, a right attitude towards ourselves. because we still have this need. Amen. Brother Beam says, "His church is himself revealed." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you see it? And expressed by the word itself that he is God. Oh, I love this. His church is himself expressed. &gt;&gt; Each member is a member of that expression or part of that expression. But it's the total the the sum total together that is him being expressed. &gt;&gt; I'm part of that expression because I'm a member of that body &gt;&gt; and and in some ways the whole expression is reflecting through me because it's reflecting through every member. &gt;&gt; But to get the full picture takes the whole body. &gt;&gt; There are things of Christ of of God's attributes that I cannot express because he put me in the form of male. So I can't express the feminine nature. &gt;&gt; I can't express motherhood. I can't express uh chastity. I can't express some of these things. I cannot express. Amen. Because God put me in a certain form and a certain position in a certain place. And he put inside of me a certain portion of himself and attribute. Amen. and and and and and you remember when Daniel White was preaching at the retreat and he says the Holy Ghost is limited by the vessel in which he's expressing through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I don't may not have worded that just right, but I hope you know what I mean. His expression is limited. So God is not going to express motherhood through me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Even though the Holy Ghost can express El Shadai, the nature of God, the breasted one, he's not going to do it through me, because the Holy Ghost expression in me is limited by the tabernacle he chooses to dwell in. &gt;&gt; He made me male, not female. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. So, God positioned us and placed us and equipped us and put a portion of himself to express that portion for the benefit of everybody else. Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And everybody else has something to benefit me. And so God God called us to depend on one another, &gt;&gt; to love one another, to edify one another. And that's what he's called us to do. &gt;&gt; That's the expression now of Christ in a many membered body. Christ in bride form. That's the expression he wishes to express himself in. Now, &gt;&gt; if that's the expression that he's choosing to express himself in, a many membered bride, where do you think the devil will place the attack? &gt;&gt; On fellowship with a many membered bride. &gt;&gt; That's where he'll train his guns because that's the way he wants to express himself now. So he'll divide fellowship and he'll pull peel people out of fellowship and he'll cause people to go home and listen to tapes by themselves and all kinds of tactics he'll use. Amen. Because that's now the expression of Christ, not in one man. Amen. We had it. We saw it again in a glimpse in brother Brandham because he was a son of man revealing the son of man. It was the revelation of Jesus Christ in that man. And Christ was revealing himself, his ministry in one man. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he demonstrated all the signs of the Messiah. He's demonstrated the prophetic gifts. He demonstrated all of it. &gt;&gt; But that's not what he's doing now. Amen. Now, what did he do? He did that in order to unite the headship with the body, the bridegroom with the bride, so that now Christ can come into bride form and be expressed and a many membered bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not about me just doing what works for me and me having the expression and me being Christ and I'm this and I'm that and I'm that. That's not the expression now. Not what I am is not the expression. It's what we are is the expression. &gt;&gt; And I need to be careful of that revelation that I don't get too caught up in myself and I become the fullness and I become this and my idea becomes the trump card to everything else. That's not the expression now. The expression now is we &gt;&gt; many membered body and I'm just a part of that body and I want to be a contributing part of that body but I also want to receive from other contributing parts of that body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's what makes us healthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we just need to understand the devil's tactics. He's always attacking where God is expressing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Always. &gt;&gt; And he always will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we shouldn't get surprised &gt;&gt; when he does that. &gt;&gt; And Christ is the mystery of God revealed. It says it depends on where you're born from. If you're born of the word of God, God's word has the preeminence in his church. That's what he died for. That's his purpose. That he might be able to achieve to have his preeminence working in his church. Let the word of God shine forth first, no matter what anything else looks like. So, what am I supposed to do as a part of this body? Amen. Let the I'm sorry. I do not like crossing out words. That makes me that makes me cringe. Let the word of God shine forth first. What am I supposed to do? Let the word shine out of my life. What's my contributing part? What what am I supposed to do? Just let the word live in me. Whatever the word says about me, whatever part I can fulfill, whichever way the word can shape me and guide me and change my conduct, change my speech, change my actions, let everything match his word and then I'll be doing what he's asked me to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to make it too complicated. Amen. So now all of that's a foundation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hey, praise God. &gt;&gt; We did it quickly. Amen. You guys were wonderful. Now, there's something else I want to share. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what's been on my heart. &gt;&gt; Says in Zechariah 14:7, "But it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord, not day nor night, but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light." &gt;&gt; Amen. This brother Bam takes and he begins to use this and lay this scripture over the church ages and begin to show us that when man moved away from the pure teaching of the apostles, Amen, and of Christ, they they began to mix in their own uh thinking into it and it became an obscure an obscure day where the light he said they had just enough light to get saved by. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just enough light to know that he was a healer. Just enough light for sanctification, but not the full light. And he and he attaches this to the church ages so that we'll understand. Amen. How the church ages were coming through partial light. Partial light. But it says, "But it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light." He said, "The sun that rose in the east is the same sun that sets in the west. And now when the and when the sun begins to dip out of those cloudy skies, it begins to shine in the fullness of of its brightness as it shone the first time." &gt;&gt; Amen. What God intended for his church to be, it's going to be. What he wanted, what he did at the day of Pentecost, what he started in the book of Acts is what he is having now. &gt;&gt; Cuz he promised he would. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the evening time, it shall be light. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says this is the evening time. The end time, the end time message. And it's to do what? It's to reproduce Jesus Christ in bride form. &gt;&gt; And you're a part and I'm a part. And all of us are here to shine that light in our lives. What is the light? The revelation of the word. How do I shine it in my life? By surrendering to the word and living the word. Amen. By not living in compromise. By not taking my own own ideas. By not mixing the word, amen, with my own thoughts. But just coming back to the pure word that's been delivered us to us through a prophetic ministry and surrendering to it and SAYING, "IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, THAT'S WHAT I WANT." AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And we begin to shine the light in the evening time. Amen. And in the Smyrna church age, he says, "In the Ephesians age and in this age and in every age, we contemplate, we will see that this is true. And in the last age, which is our age, we will find the blackout of the word, the complete apostasy ending in the great tribulation." So, brother Bam tells us that when we get to the Leodysian church age, there's going to be a complete blackout of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what is light? The word. When it's blacked out, it becomes darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the last age, there'll be a complete blackout of the word. The complete apostasy ending in the great tribulation. &gt;&gt; That's where Leodysia is heading. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Complete blackout. Brother Brandham even looked in one place. He says, you know, I could see no light past 1977. It was all darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he looked into the church, Amen. When he looked into the church in the Leodysian church age, it went into complete apostasy. And God verified this. Amen. At the at the end of uh I think it was the end of 1964. Amen. When he showed, Amen. an eclipse of the moon in the sky and put it in the papers across the nation, there was only six pictures. There wasn't a seven. And he showed that it typed Amen. The same image that he drew on the blackboard when he preached, Amen. the the seven church ages. The same image that was reflected by the pillar of fire on the back wall of BRANDHAM TABERNACLE. BUT NOW when he comes to 1964, HE SHOWS THAT NOW IT'S DIFFERENT. HE SAID, "I SHOWED YOU SEVEN with a little sliver of light. It reflected back on the back wall. BUT WHEN GOD showed it in the heavens, there was no seventh picture BECAUSE IT WAS ALL BLACK. Completely black. No more light in the denominations." &gt;&gt; Amen. BUT I THOUGHT ZACHCHARIAH said it would be light in the evening time. It is light in the evening time. IT'S THE ABSOLUTE APOSTASY FOR DENOMINATIONAL SYSTEMS. APOSTASY FOR CHURCH SYSTEMS. AMEN. BUT FOR THE TRUE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, IT IS THE RISING OF THE SUN. IT IS THE DAWN OF A NEW DAY. IT IS THE LIGHT IN THE EVENING TIME. It depends ON WHICH SIDE OF THE EQUATION YOU'RE ON WHETHER IT'S LIGHT OR DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I FEEL SO PRIVILEGED, so blessed, SO THANKFUL BY GOD TO HAVE EYES TO SEE and ears to hear. Amen. And in no way does it make me feel superior to another fellow human being. Listen, there's other human beings that I like better than I like me. There's others that are nicer and more congenial. Amen. Have better attitude than I have. AMEN. BUT THEY CAN'T SEE THE TRUTH. BUT I THANK GOD NO MATTER HOW REPROBATE I'VE been in the past and all my fo v foibless AND ALL MY COMPLEXES, I STILL SEE THE LIGHT. AMEN. FOR ME, IT'S THE RISING OF THE SUN. IT'S NOT APOSTASY. IT'S NOT DARKNESS. IT'S NOT CONFUSION. BUT IT'S ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND LIGHT. I KNOW WHERE I'M WALKING. I KNOW WHERE I CAME FROM. I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. BECAUSE WHEN THE LIGHT COMES UP, YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU'RE STILL SITTING IN CONFUSION, COME TO THE MESSAGE AND LET GOD OPEN YOUR EYES. CUZ IT'S THE LIGHT THAT SHOWS YOU WHERE YOU ARE, WHO YOU ARE, WHERE YOU CAME FROM, WHERE YOU'RE GOING. IT'S THIS LIGHT THAT REVEALS THE PATH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THE CHURCH IS CONFUSION. &gt;&gt; The systems of man are confusion. The message is the light of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the story brother Benham told of the man who went fishing. He went fishing with an old fisherman and they got off the coast and they GOT INTO A DENSE FOG AND THEY COULDN'T SEE the lighthouse anymore. They couldn't hear the fog horn. They got out there and and the the young man who was just going along with the old fisherman. He got nervous. He got scared. started standing up and saying, "WE'RE WE'RE BEING TOWED OUT. WE'RE GOING OUT TO SEA. WE'RE GOING OUT TO SEA." AMEN. AND HE WAS ALL nervous and scared that they were going to be lost. &gt;&gt; But the old fisherman said, "Sit down, son. &gt;&gt; Let's just wait till the sun comes out &gt;&gt; and lift this fog. Then we'll see where we're at." &gt;&gt; Not running all over trying to figure this out and figure this out and figure that out and find a path and rowing the wrong direction. All just wait until THE SUN COMES UP. WAIT TILL GOD TAKES THE SCALES OFF OF YOUR EYES. WAIT TILL THIS MESSAGE becomes a living reality to you and you can see with the light of the age and then you'll KNOW WHERE YOU'RE AT AND YOU'LL KNOW WHERE TO GO AND YOU'LL KNOW WHAT DIRECTION TO ROW IN. &gt;&gt; Until then, WE'RE JUST WANDERING ABOUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE best thing to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Live the best life we can. Do what we thought was right. Find out most of what we did was wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's come to the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; Man, the Eliseian church has gone into complete apostasy. There's no light there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no life there. There's no Christ there. &gt;&gt; I know it hurts people's feelings, but it doesn't mean they won't be saved. I'm not saying there's no hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The white throne judgment shows us that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But Christ poured himself into his bride &gt;&gt; in fullness. That's where his life is. That's where Emanuel is. &gt;&gt; That's where he's living and dwelling and moving. And that's where he's doing his work. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the Leodysian church age in Revelation 3, it says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and will suck with him and he with me. Brother Bam comes to the scripture and he says, this is the only church age of the seven church ages where you find Jesus Christ outside the church &gt;&gt; because they pushed the word out. &gt;&gt; And when you push the word out, you pushed the light out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You pushed the life out &gt;&gt; when you pushed the word out. And he came in the Leodysian church age through a prophetic ministry as the light, as the life, the son of man ministry, the Messiah, the word, the anointed word for our day. And it was rejected, &gt;&gt; wholesale, rejected by denominations and by the Christianom because it wasn't for everyone. &gt;&gt; It was only for a specific group of people &gt;&gt; and it was for those who were predestinated to believe. predestinated to receive &gt;&gt; and that's who he came for. And I'm so glad I can say he came for me. &gt;&gt; I was lost in darkness. I had no idea what was right, what was wrong, what should be done, what shouldn't be done. &gt;&gt; But this message was the rising of the sun for me. &gt;&gt; It was the lifting of the fog for me. It showed me where I was and where I came from. And I realized how far away I was trying to serve God, trying to serve through the traditions of my grandfather and my father. And I found out where I really was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his word began to expose my condition, but it also began to point me to the path &gt;&gt; back to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Me says this in the feast of trumpets. He said, "The church world rejects Christ and he's put on the outside." And the same trumpet, the same seal rather, when it was open to show Jesus on the outside of the church trying to get back in. At the same time, the trumpet sounds for the Jews. And the Jews recognize the atonement. Glory, hallelujah. Oh my. The Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2,000 years. But it is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message. The Holy Spirit back in the church again. Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time. He said it. He promised it. &gt;&gt; All that God was, he poured into Christ. All that Christ is, he's poured into the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That got bound by denominational rivers and that limited the expression and the freedom of the Holy Ghost because the word was bound and the word was pushed out of the church. But at the opening of the seals, at the end time message, Amen. the Holy Ghost was loosed. Amen. Loosed meaning, Amen. Whatever was hindering, whatever was binding, whatever it kept him out, whatever these denominational rivers were that acted like a barrier for the full life of Christ, it's been removed by the message of the hour. And what was it? Wrong understanding, WRONG TEACHING, FALSE DOCTRINE, the wrong idea of the teaching of Paul. But when God came back and restored the word and brought us out of man's ideas and brought us out of denominational ideas and brought us back to the original truth, it removed the barrier. &gt;&gt; Amen. And at the opening of the seals, the revelation of who the church is and what the church and two vines and what it's all been about and who the real bride is and who's not. Amen. The veil lifted, the mist is gone, the barrier is gone, and the Holy Ghost is back &gt;&gt; in the church again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like it was in the book of Acts in the beginning. Amen. There it went into Jews. As it moved to Gentiles, when it moved into Gentiles, then it went into it went into a fallen condition. And it took seven church ages, amen, to rebuild that body, to bring it back to the second Eve, to the bride of Jesus Christ, to bring us to an invisible union. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But just like the first time when Pentecost fell and Christ returned to the church, only the predestinated saw it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And only they received it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was just a small group of Jews at the beginning. Then it began to grow and then it dispersed and it was always in the minority. Amen. And when when Christ Jesus, the son of man, when he came in his prophetic ministry in flesh 2,000 years ago, he was the son of man. And he came to fulfill the scriptures, the prophecies that were told of him. And when he came the church world in that day, the old traditional teaching of the Jewish fathers, they rejected him. And when they rejected him at Calvary, when his blood was shed, he purchased a way to come back into his people. Amen. And on the day of Pentecost, he entered into the remnant, &gt;&gt; the few that could believe. &gt;&gt; Then he go, we go through a cycle of church ages through the Gentile dispensation, not the Jewish dispensation. And that was the end of the Jewish dispensation. The end of that was a wholesale rejection of Jesus Christ, the son of man, and Christ now pouring himself out into only those who would receive him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then it moves to the Gentiles and they follow the same path as the Jews. If you look through the Old Testament, there was revivals and failings and there was there was all through the Old Testament is the same thing we see in the New Testament through the seven church ages. Amen. They would have a godly judge. There would be a revival. There'd be a kicking out of the Philistines only for two or three generations later to come right back into bondage and into idolatry and to all the curses. &gt;&gt; And it was a cycle that continued just like the church ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it culminated in the son of man coming, God coming in flesh. Amen. And then pouring himself out and just to the remnant who would receive him. But then in the New Testament, it follows the same pattern the Gentiles did. Amen. What the Jews did. They started their systems and they divided themselves and added their own understanding. Amen. And it come all the way through a cycle of revival and death and revival and death until it comes to the end time. And what do we have at the end time? We have the son of man again. The same thing the Jews received. The same thing THE SAMARITANS RECEIVED. NOW WE RECEIVED IT. And how did we receive it? We received it IN A PROPHETIC MINISTRY. A son of man revealing the son of man. the same the son of man that revealed himself to the Jews and to the Samaritans. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now he came and did the same thing he did then. &gt;&gt; Amen. He told him how many husbands they had. I mean he told them where they were at. AMEN. WHEN PHILIP CALLED THEM AND TOLD THEM WHO THEIR FATHER WAS. TOLD THEM ALL OF THESE THINGS. THE SAME SIGNS THAT HE DID. The messianic sign, the sign of the son of man was performed this day to prove that Christ is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham said, "My ministry is to prove that he is here." To declare that he is here. &gt;&gt; Who's here? The son of man. The prophetic ministry of Jesus Christ. Amen. The same one that was there. &gt;&gt; Only he never presented himself to the Gentiles yet. &gt;&gt; He presented himself to the Jews and to the Samaritans and they rejected him. &gt;&gt; But now at the end of time, the same son of man presents himself to the Gentiles. And what do they do? The same thing the Jews and the Samaritans did. &gt;&gt; They rejected him. Only a remnant believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what happened to that remnant that believed? The same thing that happened on the day of Pentecost after he was rejected after the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Remember brother Brandon preached indictment. You're crucifying Aresh the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the seals are open and the barrier comes down, the full measure of Christ comes back into the church again. And that's where we're at, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in a many membered body, &gt;&gt; growing us, perfecting us, expressing himself through a many membered bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Spirit, look at this word, back in the church again. been bound for nearly 2,000 years. But now in the evening time, the evening light, the rising of the sun, Christ back in the church again. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I can't claim &gt;&gt; that it's all in me. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's back in the church again. &gt;&gt; He's in you and me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're together shining this light. Brother Benham comes to this scripture here. I love it. Isaiah 60. It says, "Arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee." &gt;&gt; Brother Ram preaches this. Amen. as the rising of the sun &gt;&gt; preaches this in shalom. Good morning. Amen. The light is come. Amen. Thy light is come. So arise and shine. What is our commandment? To shine. &gt;&gt; What is the commandment for the church? Amen. That has been in the day that's neither been day or dark. It's neither night nor day. Amen. But whether it's had a cloudy day, a gloomy day. Amen. But but at at the rising of the sun, when the veil is taken off, when the sun comes out and the fog is lifted, he's telling you to arise &gt;&gt; and shine. &gt;&gt; That's what we're SUPPOSED TO DO. ARISE AND SHINE. WELL, HOW DO I SHINE, BROTHER CHAD? BROTHER BRENHAM ALREADY TOLD us by living the word first. Amen. By giving him preeminence, by whatever THAT WORD HAS TAUGHT US TO DO. JUST DO IT. Just live it. Just surrender to it and shine the light of Christ. Give him your life and let the spirit of God come in and live his life, his manifestations, his works. The same works THAT HE DID BEFORE. HE'S NOT CHANGING HIS WORKS. HE'S DOING THE same work. Only now he's not doing it in one man. He's spreading it across the whole body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people. I believe this is the Leodysian church age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Complete apostasy, total darkness. &gt;&gt; But the Lord shall arise upon thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his glory shall be seen upon thee. &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to do? We're supposed to be reflecting the light of this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're supposed to shine because his glory is shining on us. His light is shining on us. And we're supposed to shine back that same light. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, this is the this is this is the main part I wanted to get to. And we're going to wrap up with the main part. So, don't think we're only halfway done. We're beyond halfway done. That should make you feel good. I just did that to make you feel good. I don't know where we're at, but that's where I believe we're at. [laughter] I'm being as honest as I know how, but Matthew 5:13, "Ye are the salt of the earth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ye are the salt of the earth. But if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? It is henceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trotten underfoot of men. Ye are the light of the world. This is interesting to me. &gt;&gt; Ye are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought Jesus was the light of the world. &gt;&gt; He is. &gt;&gt; And ye are the light of the world. It all depends on whose life is in you. &gt;&gt; If his life is in you, arise and shine, for the glory of the Lord is risen upon you. &gt;&gt; Ye are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. Turn with me to 2 Kings chapter 2 Kings chapter 2 verse 19. Uh 2 2 Kings 2:19. And the men of the city said unto Elisha, "Behold, I pray thee, the situation of the city is pleasant as my lord seeth, but the water is not and the ground barren." And he said, "Bring me a new cruise and put salt therein." And they brought it into him. And he went forth into the spring of the waters and cast the salt in there and said, "Thus sayeth the Lord, I have healed these waters. There shall not be from thence any more death or barren land. So the waters were healed into this day according to the saying of Elisha which he spake. So they came to a water that was not Amen. And brother Brandon makes this statement. He says he says we got a beautiful city here set on the hill and the views are pretty and it's a fine place for school and so forth as Elijah had has built but the water here is bitter. Remember our talk on the bitter water made sweet? &gt;&gt; Everybody said the water here is bitter and they needed some uh new spring and of course they were changing and they had to have a new fountain opened up. And so you can't put new wine in old bottles. It burst them, you know. And I think today is a day also that we need a new charge of water. We need a cruise of salt, a new cruise of salt in which there has never been anything in before. And God usually does that. rise up some little person out of somewhere that knows nothing and throws a cruise of salt into some old ecclesiastical waters. Where do you think God did that in his day? &gt;&gt; Usually rise up some little person out of somewhere and knows nothing. &gt;&gt; He's referring to his own ministry. &gt;&gt; Throws a cruise of salt into some old ecclesiastical waters. Amen. Old denominational waters. Amen. To bring forth the sweetness of the water once again. &gt;&gt; Oh man, I love this. And the first thing you know, it's all become sweet again. Another revival, the Holy Ghost of falling on everybody and going everywhere. That's what we need tonight. That's what we need again is another dash of salt. Don't you think so? To sweeten up the water. Remember, he took a brand new cruise there wherein there had nothing uh had been nothing and put salt in it. Now, salt is savor if it contacts, but it's got to contact first. It's got to make contact. Then he goes on to say, "We would pray Lord that you would pardon all of our transgressions, would lead us into the paths of light and life and make us Lord so salty that others would long to be Christians and whom we contact. We know that salt is a savior, a saver and it if it contacts and father we pray that you will make us the strength of the salt and may we be so desirous to contact the outside world that's dying that it might be a saver to them." &gt;&gt; Amen. When when Elisha, amen, came to this place, amen, the the sons of the prophets were gathered and they they said, "Hey, the water here is not and the land is barren." And brother Bam said, "The water was bitter." And what he did is he took some salt. He took a new cruise salt and he throw that salt, amen, into the water. Amen. And all of a sudden, it healed the waters and it healed the land and it healed everything. Amen. And brother Random even typed that with himself that God will take somebody from nowhere and throw a cru of salt into the old ecclesiastical waters. Amen. He was the prophetic ministry of Elijah in this day. Amen. That was throwing salt into the waters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "Ye are the salt of the earth." Amen. Ye are THE SALT. PRAISE GOD. THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU THAT'S here for healing. That's here for savor. Amen. That's here to make contact. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bham said, "Let's make contact." AMEN. WHAT? WHAT? WHAT is this new cruise full of salt? Hey, listen. THERE'S A NEW CHURCH RISING UP. AMEN. IT'S NOT THE OLD denominational church, but it's a bride that's been made virgin ALL OVER AGAIN. SHE'S MADE FRESH AND CLEAN AND NEW LIKE THE ORIGINAL BY WHAT? BY THE WASHING OF THE WATER OF THE WORD, BY THE POWER THAT HAS BEEN unleashed in this message TO PURGE US FROM ALL THE FILTH OF DENOMINATIONAL SPIRITS AND BRING US BACK TO AN original virgin condition. Amen. And that cruise IS FULL OF SALT. IT'S GOT LIFE. LISTEN, THE SALT IS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE ONE that heals the waters. He's the one that heals the barren land. HE'S THE HEALER. AMEN. BUT WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS CHRIST IN THIS DAY? HE'S IN A MANY MEMBERED BODY. WHERE IS THE SALT? IT'S IN THE VIRGIN BRIDE. IT'S CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN CHRIST LOOKED AT PETER AND JAMES and Andrew and and and all of them and he SAYS, "YOU'RE THE SALT." I DON'T THINK HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THEIR FLESH. AMEN. I THINK HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE LIFE THAT WAS IN THEM AND HIS LIFE THAT WOULD COME TO THEM. THEY HAD SOMETHING TO OFFER. THEY HAD A LIFE-GIVING RESOURCE. THEY HAD SOMETHING TO TAKE THE BITTERNESS of the WATERS OF THIS LIFE AND MAKE OUR LIFE SWEET. &gt;&gt; But if IT WAS GOOD FOR THEM, WHAT ABOUT FOR YOU AND I? WHEN HE SAYS, "YOU ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH." I DON'T THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT MY FLESH. &gt;&gt; I was the ONE BORN, AMEN, THROUGH SEXUAL DESIRE. I COME THROUGH THE SAME HYBRID CONDITION EVERY OTHER human came by. AMEN. BUT DOWN INSIDE MY SOUL IS A PORTION OF HIMSELF. AND HE BROUGHT A SPIRIT IN THIS DAY TO QUICKEN THAT PORTION OF HIMSELF. AND I BELIEVE THAT HE IS THE SALT. BUT HE IS LIVING IN YOU AND I. &gt;&gt; And he has no problem saying you're the salt. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't think HE'S TALKING ABOUT FLESH. I DON'T THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT HYBRIDIZATION. I DON'T THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT COCKA BURN NATURE. I THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE KNOWS IS INSIDE YOU. AMEN. IS THE SALT. THERE'S SOMETHING HERE. BROTHER BAM SAID, "AND the salt HAS TO MAKE CONTACT. IT'S HERE for a reason. IT'S HERE FOR LIFE. IT'S HERE FOR PRESERVATION. IT'S HERE TO turn the bittersweet. It's here to heal the barren land. &gt;&gt; And why IS THE BRIDE HERE? THAT'S WHY SHE'S HERE, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; God has thrown his salt into the earth. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Because when you remove the bride from this earth, what do you have? &gt;&gt; Tribulation. &gt;&gt; The only thing stemming the tide of tribulation and holding back the antichrist spirit is the presence of God's bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She is the salt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. She is preservation. &gt;&gt; She is preserving life, keeping the door open, creating the opportunities. &gt;&gt; It's the very presence of Christ. Listen, &gt;&gt; don't don't start thinking that I think I'm salt. I ain't no salt. &gt;&gt; Christ is salt. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But I've come into a union with Christ and he's alive in me. &gt;&gt; So our job is to carry the salt. &gt;&gt; Amen. For who? For everyone else. &gt;&gt; For whosoever will. For the whole world. Amen. Listen. [clears throat] Sometimes Saul gets put in situations it doesn't want to be in. &gt;&gt; Gets dropped in casserles and stews and and bitter waters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The salt was never added for the benefit of the salt. The salt was added for the benefit of whatever salt's added to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're the salt that God is putting in a recipe somewhere &gt;&gt; and you're not there for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're the salt in your workplace. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're the salt in your family. Maybe you're the salt. Amen. To your neighbors in your neighborhood. Maybe you're the salt. And God's not putting his salt in the place that's most pleasant for the salt. He's putting the salt in the place that's most needful for the salt. &gt;&gt; A dead spring of bitter water in a barren land. Well, let's just throw the salt there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. WHEN CHRIST THREW HIS SALT OF HIS word inside of me. Amen. I was a dried up well with bitter waters and a barren land. AND I WAS NOT producing the fruit of THE SPIRIT. I WAS NOT GIVING back to him the fruit. It was a barren land. But he knew it was good land. It just needed healed. So what did HE DO? HE SENT A CRUISE OF SALT MY WAY AND A BROTHER WHO HAD THE WORD. AND HE THROW SOME SALT INSIDE OF MY OLD SPRING. AND HE HEALED THE WATERS. HE HEALED IT. AND NOW THE BARREN LAND BEGAN TO PRODUCE THE LIFE OF CHRIST, THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. AMEN. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR, FRIENDS. FOR PRESERVATION, FOR LIFE. AMEN. THERE'S A THERE'S TONS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL REJECT. THOSE WHO will who will sign their own death warrant by rejecting JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HERE FOR. I'M HERE FOR LIFE. I'M HERE FOR PRESERVATION. I'M HERE TO CARRY CHRIST AROUND THIS WORLD FOR whosoever will. &gt;&gt; And if he puts you in an old bitter well, if he puts YOU IN A WORKPLACE, A FAMILY SITUATION, a relationship, A CO-ORKER, WHATEVER, WHEREVER HE PLACES YOU, AMEN. HE'S GOT THE RIGHT TO THROW THE SALT WHEREVER HE WANTS the healing to take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can be rejected. It can be cast out. That's fine. But where it's received, there'll be healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes on to say in John 8, "Then spake Jesus." I'm going to repeat this uh scripture. Oh no, not this one. I'm going to repeat the next one. Sorry. Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world. He that follows me shall not walk in darkness but shall but shall have the light of life. &gt;&gt; He didn't say listen. He says I am the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So who's the light of the world? Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall walk in the light. No, that's true, but that's not what he said. &gt;&gt; But shall have &gt;&gt; the light of life. &gt;&gt; Not just walk in it, but have it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's why Peter could say at the gate called beautiful to the lame man, Amen. Gold and silver have I none, but such as I have. &gt;&gt; He had something in him that could bring life, that could heal that old dried up well, that barren land. He had a life inside of him. him and he had a promise. He had the word and he had the anointing of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And he says, "Such as I have, I give unto you. In the name of Jesus Christ, rise up and walk." &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Listen, that wasn't just written. Amen. For 2,000 years ago, just for Peter. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. You have something. There's something in you. He's given you the light of life. &gt;&gt; I want to repeat this scripture that I just read. Matthew 5, ye are the salt of the earth, but if the salt have lost his savior, wherewith shall it be salted? Listen, you're the salt of the earth, but but listen, if you don't live the life of Christ, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHO ELSE WILL? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; If you DON'T LIVE THIS MESSAGE, who's going to live it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen that there there's only a limited number of people on the planet that have ears to ear hear and eyes to see &gt;&gt; and you hear and you see. If you WON'T BE SALTY, WHO WILL? [screaming] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WON'T BECOME A SAVIOR, IF YOU WON'T BECOME LIFE INTO THIS WORLD, WHO IS IT GOING TO COME THROUGH? WHO ELSE IS GOING TO DO IT? WE KNOW THAT THE CHURCH SYSTEMS HAS WENT INTO ABSOLUTE APOSTASY. THERE'S NO LIGHT THERE. THERE'S NO LIGHT THERE. IF THERE'S GOING TO BE LIGHT, IF THERE'S GOING TO BE LIFE, IT'S GOING TO COME THROUGH HIS BODY. &gt;&gt; If life is going to come, what's it going to come from? &gt;&gt; IF THE WATER OF LIFE IS GOING TO SPRING FORTH, AMEN, IT'S GOING TO COME. IF WE'LL DRINK THE WATER OF LIFE, AMEN. WE'LL BECOME A LIVING WELL, AMEN, FLOWING OUT WATERS INTO ETERNAL LIFE. WHERE IS THAT WELL GOING TO BE? WHERE ELSE WILL YOU FIND IT? YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO FIND IT IN THE BRIDE OF Jesus Christ and the elect predestinated bride for this day. SHE'S WHERE THE WATER'S FLOWING. SHE'S WHERE THE LIGHT IS SHINING. SHE'S WHERE THE SALT is &gt;&gt; because he predestinated it that way. He called for it that way. &gt;&gt; And if we won't do it, who will? &gt;&gt; If the salt has lost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted? Listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we don't have lifegiving power, where else outside the message are we going to be resulted? &gt;&gt; Where else outside of this word are we going to get life? Where we going to be revived? Where are we going to get light? WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GET WATER? WHERE where's it going to come from? Yeah. &gt;&gt; It is henceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and be trodden underf foot of men. Now he says ye &gt;&gt; are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought he said he was the light of the world &gt;&gt; and I say amen. &gt;&gt; And he said ye are the light of the world and I say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's the same thing as salt. The salt is Christ. The light is Christ. Listen, the light is not Chad Lamb born of my MOM AND DAD. THAT'S not it. Amen. But God predestinates something to be manifest inside that tabernacle. And that something he wants to manifest as a part of himself. And he provided his own life in this day. And the word for for which me to emulate. AND NOW THAT BECOMES LIGHT. THAT BECOMES SALT. THAT BECOMES THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST ON DISPLAY. THAT BECOMES GOD EXPRESSING HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; And I CAN ONLY DO A PART. BUT YOU'VE GOT A PART AND EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD THAT'S THE BRIDE OF CHRIST HAS A PART AND TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY they expressing the full life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; AND IF IT'S NOT THERE, I ASK YOU, WHERE ELSE IS IT? &gt;&gt; Where else will you find it? If it's not in this message, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; WHERE WILL YOU GET LIGHT? WHERE WILL YOU GET WATER? WHERE WILL YOU GET SALT? WHERE WILL YOU GET IT OUTSIDE THE LIGHT OF THE AGE? THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO, I think we have a responsibility to let our light shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let this gospel shine. Amen. The light is not here to be overcome by darkness. &gt;&gt; The light here is to push back the darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that wherever you go, darkness is abaded. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And listen, don't don't get some comic book superhero idea of this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we get so confused in the simplicity of the life of Christ and an average run-of-the-mill everyday human being, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we get some super notions of some uh uh uh comic book and I don't even know kids know what comic book is, but I don't know what else to call it. Some &gt;&gt; whatever these things you go into Walmart and you see these superhero people and they they can do whatever they can do. I don't know. Shoot fireballs out of their hand. [laughter] Well, that would be great. When somebody wants the Holy Ghost, I'll shoot a fireball out of my hand. &gt;&gt; That's not it, friends. That's not the light we shine. That's not it. It's living the word. The simplicity of a man respecting his wife, a wife honoring her husband, children obeying their parents. Amen. The simplicity of a sister looking like a feminine Christian woman. Amen. A brother. Amen. Comfortable in masculinity. This this picture of the message painted for us of what a man is and what a woman is. WHAT IS THAT? SHINING LIGHT. AMEN. Testifying of God's goodness, sharing of the healing of God. Amen. Just living your life, BUT LIVING YOUR LIFE FOR CHRIST, LIVING YOUR LIFE in the word, surrendered completely to the word, AND CONFESSING THE WORD. THAT'S shining the light. &gt;&gt; DON'T DON'T EVER END A DAY AND SAY, "I DIDN'T do anything today." your very existence on earth, the way you carry yourself, your demeanor, the way you clothe yourself, the way you treat other human beings, it can be an expression of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because that's what the WORD CAME TO DO. CHANGE US. AMEN. from just a run-of-the-mill HUMAN BEING INTO A LIGHT a lightgiving resource, a life-giving resource, a a carrier of the life of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in whatever form you're in, in whatever position you're in, in whatever station life God's placed you, and wherever he takes you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true. &gt;&gt; So, don't compare with another brother. That brother witnessed to 15 people. He had the whole airplane on their knees. Well, that was wonderful. I thank God that he did that. BUT MAYBE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RIDE in an airplane. And maybe you don't get that privilege, but it doesn't MEAN YOU'RE NOT SALT and you're not light AND YOU'RE NOT HERE FOR LIFE. &gt;&gt; TO EVERYONE YOU COME IN CONTACT WITH, TO EVERYWHERE YOU GO, LET THE LIGHT PUSH BACK THE DARKNESS. YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN A WOMAN DRESSES LIKE A WOMAN, LOOKS like a lady, and carries a feminine nature about her. IT'S PUSHING BACK ALL KINDS OF LEODYSIAN DARKNESS EVERYWHERE SHE GOES. She doesn't have to stand up and preach on a soapbox. SHE'S PREACHING EVERY STEP SHE TAKES WHEN SHE KEEPS HERSELF in her feminine appeal and her character OF A CHRISTIAN LADY. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT SHE IS. &gt;&gt; THERE'S BEEN A FEW TIMES IN MY LIFE I'VE HAD PEOPLE COME UP to me and say, "You're a Christian, aren't you?" &gt;&gt; A few times &gt;&gt; when I've been by myself, &gt;&gt; but there's been dozens of times when I'm with my wife and my girls, they say, "What church do you go to?" &gt;&gt; IT'S A GIVEN. YOU'RE SERVING CHRIST. AN ABSOLUTE GIVEN. THEY JUST KNOW IT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T ASK, "ARE YOU A CHRISTIAN?" THEY SAY, "WHAT CHURCH DO you go to?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We're here to live a life surrender to the word and let the light shine. &gt;&gt; For what? &gt;&gt; For life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the moment you remove the bride from this earth, &gt;&gt; there is no hope for the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only hope is through two wi two two witnesses, two prophets that are going to the 144,000. And of all the preaching and of all the signs and all the miracles they do, only 144,000 will believe them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They will do signs and wonders like was done in the Exodus journey like Moses did. Amen. before Pharaoh thousands of years ago. Same kind of signs with the same kind of power. And no matter what they do, only 144,000 will believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nobody else in the world. And no Gentiles. &gt;&gt; The only hope for the Gentiles is the fact that the bride is still here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ye are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ye are the salt of the earth. Don't diminish your life because you never traveled to Africa to preach. &gt;&gt; Don't become subbride. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Don't ever do that, friends. &gt;&gt; Because you're light in your life. If you've got Christ living in you, you are salt and you are light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every day, everywhere, in every circumstance. Don't let the devil diminish that in our minds because that's what Christ said we were. And if he said it, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says in John 12, Jesus said unto them, "Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come upon you. For he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whether he goeth. While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light." &gt;&gt; Amen. Ye are the light of the world. When the rapture culminates in the change of the body, we're gone. The light will have left the world for the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; So I say, God, make me a lighthouse. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; God, help me not to be under a bushel &gt;&gt; or under a bed, &gt;&gt; but help me to live a life that shines your light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The areas of compromise in my life, Lord, take them out. &gt;&gt; The places that I know that I'm not fully surrendered, help me, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help me to shine that light. Help me to cleanse my lens. Let me not get all carboned up and smoked up, but Lord, send your Holy Ghost today to do a cleansing of my lamp. &gt;&gt; May my lamp be trimmed and clear &gt;&gt; because where else is there going to be light? &gt;&gt; Where else is the light going to shine? &gt;&gt; There's darkness on the earth and gross darkness upon the people. &gt;&gt; Can anybody testify that that's the age we live in? &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a darkness on the earth and gross darkness. But brother Brandham said the light pushes back the darkness. &gt;&gt; That's why when you come in contact with certain people, they change their demeanor. &gt;&gt; Some for the better, some for the worse, but they always change. &gt;&gt; Because they're coming in contact with light and life and saw and there's a reaction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Learn to trust it. Learn to believe in it. Learn to go to work and say, "Lord, let me let me go as a lamp burning your light in this place today. &gt;&gt; Let me contact people. Let me shine light." You can't make people come to the light, but you can shine the light. And when you come in contact with somebody, the reason they react to your light into your life, sometimes it's just pushing back the darkness a little bit from their life because the light pushes back the darkness. &gt;&gt; And you come in contact with some people and then all of a sudden they begin to say the oddest things to you. I used to go to church when I was a little boy. &gt;&gt; It's like, why did they say that to me? &gt;&gt; Because the light of the life of Christ is pushing the darkness off of their life. &gt;&gt; And they're starting to see clearly for the first time in who knows how long. They're starting to think about God. Consider God. Consider what you've got. And they know there's a difference. Listen, don't don't lose the value of what God has given to us and who we are. AND THERE'S LIGHT AND THERE'S LIFE AND THERE'S A CRUISE OF SALT AND IT'S ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE'S STILL EMANUEL. HE'S STILL GOD WITH US. AMEN. FOR US, HE'S IN US. AMEN. BUT FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD, HE'S WITH US. AMEN. HE'S HERE ON THE EARTH IN A MANY MEMBERED BRIDE. &gt;&gt; THEY CAN STILL TOUCH THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT. THEY CAN STILL APPROACH UNTO HIM. WHY? BECAUSE HIS BODY IS STILL HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He says this. He says, "For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord. Walk as children of the light." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, don't be ashamed of this message. Don't be ashamed of this gospel. Don't be ashamed of the standard. Don't be ashamed &gt;&gt; of the word. &gt;&gt; If somebody says, "Why do you do that?" Say, "The word says &gt;&gt; WHY?" BECAUSE THAT'S LIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Brother Bam says this in Christ is the mystery. says, ' And when the world word moves on down into the body, from the head, what is it? The same word. Nothing can be added or taken from it. So the same word moves from the head as the day comes close. Down into the body, down into the body, vindicating that they are one. They are husband and wife. They are flesh of his flesh, word of his word, life of his life, spirit of his spirit. See? Amen. How do you know it? Bears the same record, same fruit, same word. See, manifest Christ. Same life, same God, same spirit, same word, same book. Amen. Same signs. Hey, listen. Don't be afraid to pray for your co-workers &gt;&gt; cuz it's the same life. We want to do the same work. Amen. DON'T BE AFRAID TO SAY, "I'M GOING TO PRAY FOR you and let's see what God will do for you." Amen. And let some light shine in their life. LET SOME SALT TOUCH their old water. &gt;&gt; Amen. Same signs. things that I do shall you also. Oh, hallelujah. My notice the vindicated word in his body is his victory and the reason of his death. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? Amen. He wants to live his life in the full power of his life in you. &gt;&gt; Whatever he did, he wants to do IN HIS BODY. AMEN. IT DOESN'T MEAN ONE PERSON will do everything, but it means the body will HAVE THE FULL LIFE OF Jesus Christ because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And if you've got that teaspoon out of the ocean, that means the full potential of the life of Christ IS IN YOU. WHATEVER HE CALLS FOR CAN COME FORTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; If it's walking on water, if it's speaking TO A STORM, WHATEVER IT IS, IT CAN COME FORTH because it's the same life. &gt;&gt; So shine light, live life, don't be afraid to intercede because that we're kings and priests. &gt;&gt; We are kings AND PRIESTS UNTO GOD. WHAT IS A PRIEST? AN INTERCESSOR. WHO ARE WE GOING TO INTERCEDE FOR? AMEN. THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD TRAPPED IN DARKNESS THAT NEEDS INTERCESSION. THERE'S PEOPLE WE KNOW EVERY DAY. THEY NEED SOMEBODY TO stand in the gap AND SAY, "OH, GOD, THEY'RE TRAPPED IN IGNORANCE. THEY'RE STUCK IN DARKNESS. They don't know WHAT THEY'RE DOING. WOULD YOU PLEASE HEAL them and deliver them and open their eyes?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's do the work of intercession. Friends, let's realize that Christ is here. &gt;&gt; He's here in his bride universal. And this quote, I want to read this next quote to you. I love it. We're we're coming down to the close. We're almost done. But I want to read this. Brother Bam starts talking about the old Dutchman who went to work after he went to revival and got saved and he couldn't pronounce all his words just right. And but he got saved and they made fun of him at work. And this is what he said. He said, "You must have went down to that bunch of nuts." He said, "Yes." Said, "Glory to God." said, "Thank God for the nuts." He said, "You know, you take an automobile coming down the road and you take all the nuts out of it, you ain't got nothing but a bunch of yunk." [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. But what the little Dutchman was just about right. &gt;&gt; Take all the nuts out. The nuts is what holds it together. And I think that what holds the church together sometimes and holds civilization together. &gt;&gt; What's going to happen to this world when you take all the nuts out? &gt;&gt; It's going to fall apart. &gt;&gt; The antichrist becism will sweep in. A tribulation will fall in so fast and the whole world will change dynamically overnight. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you took the nuts out. what was holding civilization together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, you're not just another lump of flesh walking on this earth. &gt;&gt; You are a son or daughter of almighty God. &gt;&gt; You may be in your birth average or below average. You may be in natural abilities. You may be in the top 10% of the lower third. It's nice if you say it that way because at least you say top 10%. Sounds better and intelligence and in charisma and in memory and and all the things that Listen, don't look at those things. &gt;&gt; You arise. [snorts] Rise up from the dead denomination. Rise up from the old dry bones of Ezekiel. You rise up and shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. because your light has come and he is your light. &gt;&gt; He is your bridegroom. He is your husband and the glory of the Lord is shining on you. &gt;&gt; Arise and shine for his light has come and is shining upon you. Amen. And the glory of the Lord shall be seen on you. &gt;&gt; Go forward every day knowing who you are. God does not want us to live a defeated life. And it doesn't mean, like I said, it doesn't mean Marvel comic superhero going through and demolishing. No, that's not it. Amen. We defeat the devil by not giving in to the devil. Amen. We make him run away by ignoring him. &gt;&gt; Not by screaming at him and yelling at him. Just don't pay any attention to anything he says and KEEP LIVING THE WORD. THAT destroys the devilise. &gt;&gt; Just keep manifesting the word. Keep declaring the word. LET IT BE ON YOU. Let it shine from you. Amen. Let it be in your lips. Let it be in your actions. Let it be in your home. Let it be all over you. And anything that hinders any darkness, ANY COMPROMISE, KILL THAT THING. SAY, "GOD, HELP ME TO KILL THE compromise that's IN MY LIFE." BECAUSE I'VE GOT A JOB TO DO ON THIS EARTH. I'VE GOT SALT TO GIVE. I GOT CONTACT TO MAKE. I GOT LIGHT TO SHINE. &gt;&gt; And the devil wants to diminish your light. And he wants to remove your salt from the equation. Because when you come on the SCENE WITH THE POWER THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU, WITH the word that's been given to you, you have the word and the spirit TO BACK IT UP TO CHANGE the circumstances. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In every situation if the spirit of God moves on you to do so. &gt;&gt; So what would the devil want you to do? Doubt who you are. Get stuck in compromise. Be afraid to speak because I've already spoken so many wrong things they won't believe me now. &gt;&gt; Ruin my testimony at work. Ruin my testimony at school. That's what he's trying to do, friends. &gt;&gt; Because he can't stop the light. It pushes back the darkness. &gt;&gt; How do we live this magnificent life of the bride of Jesus Christ? Surrender to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just let the word flow in us. &gt;&gt; And the areas that we're struggling with and the places that are hard for us and the things that we fell in, just cry out to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to stop making excuses and say, "Well, that's just me and this and that my the I see these other brothers doing. If they can do it, I can." Listen, let's stop making excuses and just say, "God, I believe this is hindering your expression. Would you come and take it out of me, Lord, in my humanity and what I got from mom and dad or whatever it is I've done or said, I've got these trappings all around me. God, would you come and remove them from me? I want to shine the light. I want to be the salt. I want to do something for your kingdom. Because if you don't, who will? &gt;&gt; Who's going to do it? &gt;&gt; There's one place where his life is dwelling. There's one place that he's bottled and confined. &gt;&gt; And where is he bottled and confined today? He bottled himself and confined himself in his bride. &gt;&gt; In an invisible union with Christ. &gt;&gt; Let's shine for him. Brother Brandham says this. Notice like the sculpture, he hides with a mask over it. That's what God has done to this age. It's been hid. All these things has been hid and it's supposed to be revealed in this age. Now, the Bible says that will be revealed in the latter times. It's like a sculptor keeping his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it. And there it is. All that's what the Bible has been. It has been a work of God that's been covered up. And it's been hid since the foundation of the world. And it's sevenfold mystery. And God promised in this day at the age of this Leodysian church, he'll take the mask off the whole thing. And we could see it. He did that at the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a glorious thing. God and Morphe. That means God in a form. Masked in the pillar of fire. God and Morphe and a man called Jesus. God and Morphe in his church. &gt;&gt; He's still Emanuel. That's right. And God is still here. He's on the earth because whatever was binding, the Holy Ghost has been loosed by the evening time message and his life is poured back into the church again. What was a portion, what was a dip, now is fullness. &gt;&gt; God above us, God with us, God in us, the condescending of God. I want to read one more scripture together as the musicians come. Matthew 10 40-42, he that receiveth you receiveth me. Why? Because his life is in you. &gt;&gt; Because you're his representative on earth. Because the light is shining in you. Because you're a member of his body. &gt;&gt; Ye are the salt of the earth. Ye are the light of the world. He that receiveth you receiveth me. And he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. And he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. Even if somebody anybody offers as much as a cup of cold water to one of the little littlest in the kingdom of God, even those who just a disciple, not a prophet, not but just a disciple, that one who offers to drink to that lowly one in Christ, he shall in no wise lose his reward. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you realize the impact that our life can have if we shine for Christ? If we just be who he's meant for us to be, be the body of Christ in the world. Amen. Moving into the darkness. Listen, we don't have to be afraid of the darkness. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Why fear what runs from light? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The world's getting darker. Absolutely. It's prophesied it will. IT'S THE BLACKEST IT'S EVER BEEN. ABSOLUTELY. IT'S SATAN'S EDEN. ABSOLUTELY. For sure. WHY SHOULD THAT SCARE ANY OF US? &gt;&gt; Brother Benham said, "If you go into a dark room and YOU LIGHT ONE LITTLE LIGHT, AMEN. THAT LITTLE LIGHT WILL LIGHT THE WHOLE WORLD. It begins to move the darkness away from the light. It pushes it away. Amen. You can say, "WELL, ALL I'VE GOT IS ONE LITTLE LIGHT." WELL, THAT ONE LITTLE LIGHT WILL PUSH AWAY DARKNESS WHEREVER YOU GO. &gt;&gt; Everywhere you move, the darkness runs away from that little light. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF DARKNESS. We don't have to be afraid of the evil OF THIS WORLD. WHY? Because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO TAKE LIGHT INTO THE DARK WORLD. WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO LIVE THE LIFE. WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO MANIFEST CHRIST. WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO GO TO WHERE SALT SOMETIMES DOESN'T WANT TO GO. &gt;&gt; And God might sprinkle you into a horrible workplace. &gt;&gt; SAY, "GOD, WHY AM I HERE? DON'T FORGET YOUR SALT." MAYBE HE WANTED TO PUT A LITTLE PRESERVING SAVING SALT IN THE SITUATION TO see if somebody could be saved &gt;&gt; or even offer you a cup of cold water. &gt;&gt; DON'T GET DISCOURAGED. GOD MIGHT DROP YOU IN THE MIDST of the darkest of the darkest places and situations and you think, "THIS IS HORRIBLE. MY SUPERVISOR IS EVIL. AMEN. EVERYONE around me is doing evil and he drops you in the middle and you know by you know you know by the will of God that's where you're SUPPOSED TO BE. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED. YOUR LIGHT WILL PUSH AWAY THE DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE THERE. LISTEN. WHERE IS THE BRIDE COMING TO HER? H HER BRIGHTEST LIGHT. WHERE IS SHE SHINING THE BRIGHTEST? THE GENTILE BRIDE HAS EVER SHINE. SHE'S SHINING THE BRIGHTEST IN LEODYSIA WHICH IS THE DARKEST. WHY WOULD HE PUT HIS WHY WOULD HE PUT HIS FULL MANIFESTATION in bride FORM AT THE END WHEN IT'S THE WORST? THAT'S the point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He Elisha put the salt in the bad spring &gt;&gt; and made it good. &gt;&gt; He didn't put it in the good spring. &gt;&gt; He put it in the bad spring and made it sweet. God can put us in all kinds of bad situations, but let him make it sweet. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I want to stop crying. Woe is me. &gt;&gt; Why am I here? &gt;&gt; Why is this happening? Has anybody else said that? &gt;&gt; As if God didn't know. &gt;&gt; As if he made a mistake. You say things like, "Why am I here? And why is this happening to me? And why and I don't understand." Listen, it's okay not to understand. And it's okay to question. It's okay to be heartbroken. But listen, don't forget that the footsteps of the righteous are order to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you're not here, AMEN, JUST TO SIT IN A convent somewhere or come to fellowship and enjoy one another and get in each other's light and feel THE WARM GLOW. THAT'S NOT OUR ONLY PURPOSE. THAT'S PART OF OUR purpose and we thank God FOR IT. BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE OUT OUT WHERE SALT'S NEEDED AND WHERE LIGHT is needed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we don't come into communal living. THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T START A COMMUNE. And that's why brother Brown didn't tell us sell everything you own and move OUT HERE. NO, YOU GO TO YOUR WORKPLACES, GO TO your family functions, go to all of these places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And be salt and light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if they call you a nut, &gt;&gt; and if they call you a religious nut, &gt;&gt; say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; You don't know if this nut was gone, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The whole world would fall apart. &gt;&gt; You might be the nut that's holding your family together. You might be the nut that's holding your workplace together. &gt;&gt; There might be blessings coming to your co-workers and to your place of employment just because you're there. &gt;&gt; Everywhere Joseph went, he prospered &gt;&gt; in Piper's house and in prison to the right. Why? Because there was a blessing attached to his life. &gt;&gt; Is there a blessing attached to our life? I believe so. Let's move forward and not fear the darkness and not get upset at the situations and not lose heart when salt gets thrown into a bad situation. This is a pot of [snorts] yucky food. &gt;&gt; Let's add some salt and see if we can make it a little bit better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let God do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand. &gt;&gt; Let's recognize that God's still here. You know, sometimes I need a good dose of God. &gt;&gt; And that's why I need you. &gt;&gt; There's times my life needs a little salt and sometimes I need you. &gt;&gt; I need a little bit of light on my situation. Your fellowship helps me and our fellowship together helps one another. And I thank God we can recognize Emanuel's still here. &gt;&gt; Amen. He promised to be with us always and he'll never leave us and forsake us and that he will not leave us comfortless but come to us and I believe it friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. Let's just pray. Lord, we thank you for your word. And God, may it be more than the preaching of a sermon, &gt;&gt; but God, may it be a realization that strikes us deeper than it ever has before. May we realize, Lord, we're not here, Lord, just to trudge through life and barely make it, get to the other side, Lord, exhausted, exasperated by life. That's not why you put us here, Lord. You put us here and you raised your light to shine on us and you told us to arise and shine. God, you want to express yourself. And in this dispensation of time, you've chosen to express yourself in bride form in a many membered body. And God, we believe we're members of that body. And we want you to have a greater expression in us than ever before. God, use us as salt. Use us as light. Help us, God, to be set on a lampstand on a hill so that the light will shine. [music] And Father, forgive us for compromises we've made. Forgive us for bad attitudes that we've had towards other people, co-workers, other humans that are trapped in darkness. But God, may we realize that we never walk alone, but wherever we go, your light is shining. God, that we're a vessel carrying your salt. Lord, may we may we recognize that you're in us. You're with us into the end of the world, the end of this age. And God, there's no other nuts. There's no other salt. There's no other light. There's no other place for hope to be found. God, help us to stay engaged and stay loving. God, help us to shine light wherever we go. And may we give our lives to you Aresh day by day. Use us for your glory. May the reality of these things be ever before our eyes. We love you and we ask for your blessing over all that we say and do. May we go from here, Lord, realizing what we are in this world. And may it make us humble and reflecting and careful and circumspect [music] about the way we walk in this life. We love you. We ask that you would bless these words. May they produce life. May they bring life. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Man, Bridge, I've got a river of life flowing out from me. [music] It makes a lane [singing] to walk and life to [music] see.
