[0:00] it's good to be together again and may
[0:03] the lord bless us
[0:05] as we look into his word amen let's take
[0:07] our bibles and
[0:08] turn to daniel chapter 12 together
[0:11] i want to start on the revelation of the
[0:15] seven seals
[0:16] we go ahead and bring that first slide
[0:17] up that's all right brother franco
[0:20] and uh i just want to take our time and
[0:22] look at this i don't want to rush
[0:23] through it
[0:24] and i i really want to dig in and see
[0:27] what's here and i'm going to read some
[0:28] quotes through that
[0:29] will explain to you why i really want to
[0:31] spend some time here on the seals
[0:33] if you've been a message believer for
[0:34] any length of time at all you've heard
[0:36] the term seals right
[0:37] and you've probably heard it over and
[0:39] over and over again and we just want to
[0:41] make sure we take the time not to breeze
[0:43] over that like as if we
[0:45] already understand everything there is
[0:47] understand about that
[0:48] because that was the greatest thing that
[0:50] ever happened in the ministry of brother
[0:51] benham
[0:52] he's pointing to it he's referring to it
[0:54] he's talking about it even for the rest
[0:55] of his ministry
[0:57] so the revelation of the seven seals was
[0:59] a major thing it wasn't
[1:01] just one-week services that he moved on
[1:03] it was much more than that to the
[1:05] prophet of god
[1:06] it should be much more than that to us
[1:08] we just pray that god would reveal it to
[1:10] us
[1:10] the way he wants to and let's look
[1:13] together in revelations chapter 12 verse
[1:15] 8 while you're yet standing
[1:19] verse 8 says and i heard but i
[1:21] understood not
[1:23] and then said i o my lord what shall be
[1:25] the end of these things
[1:27] and he said go thy way daniel for the
[1:29] words are closed up
[1:30] and sealed till the time of the end
[1:34] so daniel wanted to know he heard but he
[1:36] didn't understand and
[1:37] he wanted to know the interpretation of
[1:39] these things and
[1:41] and he says go thy way daniel for the
[1:43] words are sealed up till the time of the
[1:45] end
[1:46] have we come to the time of the end
[1:49] we've come to the time when the words
[1:50] are no longer sealed up
[1:53] it says many shall many shall be
[1:55] purified and made white
[1:57] and tried but the wicked shall do
[1:59] wickedly and none of the wicked shall
[2:02] understand
[2:03] but the wise shall understand hallelujah
[2:09] brother branham told us that daniel saw
[2:11] this opening of the seven seals
[2:13] amen and here he's here he's asking you
[2:15] know for more information he says no
[2:17] it's sealed up till the time of the end
[2:19] but he's telling us at the time of the
[2:21] end
[2:22] many shall be purified and made white
[2:25] and tried so at this time when these
[2:27] things are unveiled it has
[2:29] an ability to purify amen and make
[2:32] white and and he says the wicked shall
[2:36] not understand
[2:37] but the wise shall understand that's why
[2:41] we don't say i don't understand those
[2:42] seals they don't mean anything to me
[2:44] boy we need to pray for revelation and
[2:46] say if it was important to your prophet
[2:48] it was important to you that you would
[2:50] bring a prophet on the scene
[2:51] and you would build an entire worldwide
[2:53] ministry just so you could open the
[2:55] seals
[2:56] i don't want to say i don't understand
[2:58] it i don't care i don't need to
[2:59] understand it
[3:00] you said the wise will understand and
[3:02] i'm saying lord give me revelation so
[3:05] that i can be one of those wise
[3:07] to understand what you want me to
[3:09] understand
[3:10] amen let's just bow our heads and ask
[3:13] the lord to bless his word
[3:15] dear heavenly father we thank you god
[3:17] that we could be here today
[3:19] lord we pray that you would just open
[3:21] the words to us lord
[3:23] we can open a bible we can read black
[3:26] ink on white paper lord but without a
[3:28] revelation from you it will do us no
[3:30] good
[3:31] nor we've come to the time lord where
[3:33] you've opened these things and you want
[3:35] us to understand
[3:36] i just pray that you bring us a spirit
[3:38] of revelation lord that we might see you
[3:40] as you
[3:40] are we might see lord what you want us
[3:42] to see
[3:43] and god that we might be made pure and
[3:45] white and rapture ready lord
[3:47] by these revelations we ask that you
[3:49] would do this for us in the precious
[3:51] name of our lord jesus christ
[3:53] amen you can take your seats let's turn
[3:56] to the book of revelations
[3:59] revelations chapter 10 this passage in
[4:02] daniel 12 when revelations chapter 10
[4:05] go right together the same thing
[4:08] hallelujah it's one thing that that the
[4:10] prophet of god has done for us by
[4:12] revelation is
[4:13] he has connected the bible and he's made
[4:16] it one book he hasn't
[4:17] it's not 66 books it's one book amen
[4:21] and and it's just amazing once you see
[4:23] the theme running through the whole
[4:25] bible and that's really where we want to
[4:26] get into
[4:27] this this morning revelations chapter 10
[4:30] verse 1
[4:31] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[4:33] from heaven clothed with a cloud
[4:35] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[4:37] face was as it were the sun and his feet
[4:39] as pillars of fire
[4:41] and he had in his hand a little book
[4:42] open and he set his right foot upon the
[4:45] sea and his left foot upon the earth
[4:47] and cried with a loud voice is when a
[4:48] lion roareth and when he had cried seven
[4:51] thunders uttered their voices
[4:53] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[4:54] their voices i was about to write
[4:56] and i heard a voice from heaven saying
[4:58] unto me seal up those things which the
[5:00] seven thunders uttered
[5:01] and write them not so we're seeing the
[5:04] same thing that
[5:05] daniel went through is now what john is
[5:07] going through
[5:09] verse 5 and the angel which i saw stand
[5:12] upon the sea and upon the earth lifted
[5:13] up his hand to heaven
[5:15] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[5:17] ever who created heaven and the things
[5:18] that therein
[5:19] are and the earth and the things that
[5:21] therein are and the sea
[5:23] and the things which are therein that
[5:24] there should be time no longer
[5:27] but in the days of the voice of the
[5:28] seventh angel when he shall begin the
[5:30] sound the mystery of god should be
[5:32] finished
[5:33] as he hath declared to his servants the
[5:35] prophets
[5:37] hallelujah i can't i can't read that
[5:39] without being happy
[5:42] i cannot read that passage of scripture
[5:44] without being thrilled that the mystery
[5:45] of god
[5:46] is finished amen as he hath declared to
[5:49] his servants
[5:50] the prophets you see right here
[5:54] we understand that that there is an
[5:57] opening of this sealed book and i'll go
[6:00] to the next slide
[6:02] this is the way brother branham
[6:04] describes this or at least as best
[6:06] as i can understand from the message
[6:08] that there's one rolled up and sealed on
[6:10] the end and another one wrapped around
[6:11] that
[6:12] and and we see that when john looks in
[6:15] in revelations
[6:17] chapter 6 chapter 5 he sees the lamb
[6:19] take the book in chapter 6
[6:21] he sees him tear open the seals but when
[6:23] he opens the seals there he opens it in
[6:26] symbol form
[6:27] so the mystery comes out from god and
[6:29] after it comes out from god
[6:31] it's manifest in a symbol of white horse
[6:34] and red horse and all of that
[6:35] but what the symbol means the
[6:37] interpretation of the symbols
[6:39] wasn't given at that time so what we see
[6:41] is the book is
[6:43] unsealed in revelations chapter 5.
[6:45] that's why in revelations chapter 10
[6:48] he comes down with an open book and and
[6:50] and then seven thunder's utter and
[6:52] brother brahm tells us the seven
[6:54] thunders are the interpretation of the
[6:57] seals
[6:58] of the symbols those are they're
[7:00] revealing what the symbols mean
[7:02] amen but then john heard that john knew
[7:05] what the thunders were he knew
[7:07] what the revelation of the symbols were
[7:09] but he was told not to write it
[7:11] now he's told before write everything
[7:12] that you see
[7:14] all right you're in the vision write
[7:15] everything that you see but he comes to
[7:17] this is write it not
[7:18] why because it must be sealed till the
[7:20] time of the end amen
[7:22] until the the voice of the seventh angel
[7:24] then
[7:25] the mystery of god could be finished so
[7:27] something else had to happen
[7:29] so we find out now we have a sealed book
[7:31] coming from god
[7:33] the lamb takes it and unseals it in
[7:35] symbol form
[7:36] the thunders roar and reveal the symbols
[7:39] and then the book is sealed up again
[7:40] that's why brother branham says it was
[7:42] sealed on the inside
[7:44] and on the back side two sets of seals
[7:46] because you see two sets of seals
[7:48] see a set of seals broken in revelations
[7:50] chapter six
[7:51] and you see a set of seals you see it
[7:53] sealed again
[7:54] in revelations chapter 10 until we come
[7:57] to the revelation of the seven seals in
[7:59] 1963
[8:00] and then you hear the seven thunders
[8:03] which is the opening of those second set
[8:07] of seals
[8:08] we got that so many times we read the
[8:10] message that could be so confusing
[8:12] i mean you know what's confusing and
[8:14] i'll just i'll say it this way i may
[8:16] have said this before
[8:17] is what's confusing about the message
[8:19] what's confusing about
[8:21] all prophecy is you're not seeing what
[8:23] the prophet seeing
[8:25] if you were seeing what the prophet
[8:26] seeing you would understand exactly what
[8:28] he's saying
[8:30] and this is true when you read in in
[8:33] i think it's mayhem i can't remember
[8:35] exactly where it is in the old testament
[8:37] he starts talking about
[8:38] these chariots and they have lights and
[8:40] they're jostling about
[8:42] and going to and fro and it's really
[8:44] difficult to make out what he's
[8:46] referring to
[8:47] these lights and they're jostling about
[8:49] in the way and
[8:50] oh i don't understand what he's saying
[8:52] until brother branham says what the
[8:54] prophet
[8:54] saw was a vision of the outer drive of
[8:57] chicago
[9:00] now the minute you can see what he's
[9:02] seeing you know
[9:03] what lights on a highway on the outer
[9:05] drive in chicago would look at at night
[9:06] on a busy highway
[9:08] you could see the chariots with lights
[9:10] jostling about in the way
[9:11] and all of a sudden clear as a bell i
[9:13] know what nah's talking about
[9:16] you see and that's what's so difficult
[9:18] until you can see what the prophet's
[9:20] seeing
[9:20] he's telling you as accurately as he can
[9:22] tell you what he sees
[9:24] but until god can give you a revelation
[9:26] so you can see what he sees
[9:28] it's all mystery and darkness and it
[9:30] looks like it looks like he's
[9:31] contradicting statements
[9:33] and they're not they're just different
[9:34] pieces of information about the same
[9:36] thing
[9:37] so he says those two sets of seals he
[9:39] talks about the seals on the inside and
[9:41] the back
[9:41] side there's not 14 seals it's seven
[9:44] seals but it was broken symbol form
[9:46] amen then it was revealed to john but
[9:49] john was told
[9:50] not to write to seal the thunders which
[9:52] is the revelation of the
[9:53] symbols and then the last breaking of
[9:56] the seals
[9:57] in 1963 the seven thunders was to break
[10:00] those seals and reveal
[10:02] the details or the interpretation of the
[10:05] symbols
[10:07] when you see what the prophet sees it's
[10:09] a piece of cake
[10:10] now when he said that that second set of
[10:12] seals piece of cake
[10:15] but before it's like what there's is
[10:16] there seven or fourteen
[10:18] and it's only ever been seven same
[10:21] things over and over
[10:23] it's just amazing so brother branham
[10:26] gets into the
[10:27] to the seven seals here and we're gonna
[10:30] read some quotes and and talk about some
[10:32] things
[10:34] he says the breach between the seven
[10:36] church ages and the seven seals
[10:38] it's thus saith the lord i'll read it to
[10:41] you out of the book the sounding of the
[10:42] seventh angels message
[10:44] the mystery of god should be finished
[10:46] that's been declared by his holy
[10:48] prophets
[10:48] that's the prophets who wrote the word
[10:51] at the sounding of the seven church age
[10:52] the last church age all
[10:54] the loose ends through these church ages
[10:56] have been probed at will be wound up
[10:58] together
[10:58] and when the seals are broken the
[11:00] mystery is revealed down comes the angel
[11:02] the messenger christ
[11:04] setting his foot upon the land and upon
[11:06] the sea with a rainbow over his head
[11:08] now remember this seventh angel is on
[11:10] earth at the time of his coming
[11:13] i love that quote i just that just
[11:16] settles you right down and put you right
[11:18] in position
[11:19] amen it's so good so we want to look at
[11:22] these seals
[11:23] for just a minute and and i want to take
[11:26] a a uh
[11:28] take my time i'm trying very very
[11:30] desperately to take my time
[11:32] we've got plenty of time we've got
[11:33] plenty of services we can take a month
[11:36] on this if we need to
[11:37] and so i i just appreciate you being
[11:39] patient with me i just want to make sure
[11:42] that we we step through this together he
[11:45] says in the breach
[11:46] the whole thing together makes the book
[11:48] and it's sealed with seven seals and
[11:50] being it's on the back side is because
[11:51] it's wound up
[11:52] the seal mystery is on the inside and
[11:54] only says the white horse writer the
[11:56] black horse rider and what more on the
[11:58] outside
[11:58] but the mystery of the whole book is in
[12:00] them seals from
[12:02] genesis to revelations
[12:05] a complete plan of the redemption is
[12:07] revealed in the seven seals
[12:09] now this is an interesting statement
[12:11] because if you take the seven seals
[12:13] the information that comes forth is the
[12:15] white horse rider
[12:16] and the lion anointing and the red horse
[12:18] rider and the ox
[12:20] and brother brenham lays that he takes
[12:22] those those
[12:23] horse riders and he lays it right over
[12:24] the church ages
[12:27] all right and he goes through the church
[12:28] ages and and then he goes to souls that
[12:31] are under the altar of referring to the
[12:32] jews from the time
[12:34] of christ onward and then he goes into
[12:36] the sixth steal
[12:37] which goes to the two witnesses the
[12:39] seventh trumpet and the
[12:41] calling out of the 144 thousand so if
[12:43] you look at that
[12:45] it would look to you like the seals
[12:47] cover the time
[12:49] from matthew mark luke and john until
[12:51] revelations
[12:52] but he's saying these seals are the
[12:55] complete
[12:56] plan of redemption is revealing these
[12:58] seals it's from genesis
[13:00] to revelations so these seals
[13:03] have the mystery of the entire bible
[13:07] not just the new testament church not
[13:09] just the experience of the new testament
[13:11] believers
[13:12] but there's a there's a plan of
[13:13] redemption there's something that's
[13:15] locked in these seals
[13:17] that when it's revealed will reveal the
[13:19] entire plan of redemption
[13:21] from genesis to revelations
[13:24] hallelujah that'll pop your pee brain it
[13:27] pops mine
[13:29] because i've been looking so much at
[13:31] details i got the details okay this
[13:33] horse rider he wrote in this period and
[13:35] this horse rider he wrote in this period
[13:37] and this is what he did
[13:38] and and i was just looking at the
[13:40] information within the seals
[13:42] and i wasn't backing up to get the big
[13:44] picture of what it was all about
[13:46] and that's what i hope we get to i hope
[13:48] we can get to the big picture
[13:51] he says again now we go to breaking
[13:54] these seals you're going to see it's
[13:55] plumbed back in the scripture
[13:57] all the way back for each one of these
[14:01] seals the whole thing
[14:02] together the whole mystery lays right
[14:03] here in these seals
[14:05] every mystery of the bible lays in these
[14:07] seals
[14:09] now if you take that with the
[14:11] understanding of just the information
[14:13] that's locked into the seals as far as
[14:15] when the horse riders rode and the
[14:16] anointing when you do that
[14:18] how can every mystery of the bible be in
[14:21] those seals
[14:22] if he's talking about something that
[14:23] happened just to the gentile church
[14:27] it's got to be showing more than just
[14:29] what happened to the gentile church
[14:32] every mystery of the bible lays in these
[14:33] seals and the seals cannot be broken
[14:35] till that time
[14:38] brother branham says here in souls that
[14:41] are in prison now
[14:42] but one day he rose from there come
[14:45] forth
[14:46] there was the book at it was still in
[14:47] the abstract owner god almighty
[14:49] and john looked around and he wept
[14:51] because there was no man even worthy to
[14:53] look on the book and especially
[14:55] open the seals to reveal what the hidden
[14:57] mystery was
[14:58] the mysteries was in the seven seals
[15:01] when these seven seals was opened that
[15:02] opened up the entire
[15:05] bible are we catching the theme
[15:08] it didn't unlock the history of the new
[15:10] testament church it didn't reveal
[15:12] what the devil was doing to the gentile
[15:14] church it unlocked
[15:16] amen it opened up the entire
[15:20] bible the seven seals it was sealed with
[15:23] seven mysteries and in these seven
[15:25] seals held the entire mystery of it
[15:28] so we understand now that god has had a
[15:31] book of redemption and this book of
[15:33] redemption
[15:34] had the record of the redeeming of the
[15:36] entire seed of christ the whole
[15:38] the whole seedline of god was in this
[15:40] and he said this book was written before
[15:42] the foundation of the world he said the
[15:44] bible was written
[15:45] and he said the bible and the book of
[15:46] redemption are the same thing and this
[15:48] was written before the foundation of the
[15:50] world
[15:51] amen it wasn't written when isaiah began
[15:53] to pen and
[15:54] ezekiel began to pen and matthew and
[15:56] mark and luke and john when they began
[15:58] to write it
[15:58] that's not when the bible was written
[16:03] that was when the bible was transcribed
[16:06] but the bible was written in the mind of
[16:09] god before the foundation of the world
[16:11] the book of redemption was written and
[16:13] sealed
[16:14] amen in god's mind before the foundation
[16:17] of the world
[16:17] and that means if you're part of the
[16:19] book of redemption if you can find
[16:21] yourself in the bible
[16:22] then that was recorded in heaven before
[16:25] the foundation of the world
[16:26] before there was dust or stars or even
[16:29] space or time
[16:30] or anything else that materialized that
[16:32] way before that you were already sealed
[16:35] under those seven seals and that means
[16:37] nothing will unseal you
[16:39] from that book of redemption
[16:43] hallelujah the revelation of the seven
[16:46] seals
[16:47] it's here to awaken us up the strip
[16:50] spiritually amnesia away from us
[16:52] so we can recognize who we are where we
[16:54] came from
[16:55] what we're doing where we're going what
[16:57] is the whole purpose amen
[17:00] hallelujah that's what the that's what
[17:01] the ministry of brother brahm came to do
[17:04] came to wake us out of spiritual amnesia
[17:06] came to pull the scales back off of our
[17:09] eyes
[17:09] so that we could see a bigger picture
[17:11] than just i was born in 1970 something
[17:14] and i lived this many years and i
[17:16] married so and so and had this many
[17:17] children
[17:18] if that's all that we can see we've got
[17:20] to take the blinders off
[17:21] because there's a lot more to you than
[17:23] that there's a lot more to your purpose
[17:26] here than that purpose
[17:27] we've got to find out what is in the
[17:29] mind of god
[17:30] and he has given it he's unlocked the
[17:32] mystery of god
[17:34] it is finished it is unveiled and now we
[17:37] have to receive it by revelation
[17:40] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[17:46] now just so we can read here what
[17:49] brother branham says about each of these
[17:51] seals
[17:52] now if you notice when he gets into the
[17:54] sales i mentioned this before but when
[17:56] he goes to mention
[17:58] the the information or the details like
[18:00] the white horse rider
[18:01] it's the antichrist spirit it begins to
[18:03] ride through a saying and becomes a
[18:05] doctrine of the nicolaitans and the
[18:07] first church age
[18:08] he starts to lay that out when he lays
[18:10] that out and explains all of that
[18:12] he can do that in usually about 10 or 15
[18:15] minutes
[18:16] if everybody understands what i'm saying
[18:18] he can give you
[18:19] that lump of information of what this is
[18:22] and where it was in the church age
[18:24] and what it did he can give you that
[18:26] information in just a few minutes
[18:28] but listen to what he says here in the
[18:31] first seal
[18:32] did you get to study in jeremiah how he
[18:34] wrote that many of you taking it down
[18:36] last night how them seals were wrote and
[18:37] placed away
[18:38] for keeping until he returned after the
[18:40] 70 years of captivity
[18:42] we ministered on that several weeks ago
[18:45] and talked about the open and closed
[18:47] book of jeremiah
[18:48] but anyways he goes on to say he was to
[18:50] return back and claimed his possession
[18:53] and i certainly like to study it there's
[18:55] no way to
[18:56] express it all because it's an eternal
[18:57] word it's an eternal book
[18:59] and therefore we just have to kindly hit
[19:01] the high places
[19:03] and today in studying i've written down
[19:05] many scriptures so you can study it
[19:06] and also in the tapes we'll reveal much
[19:09] of it as you study it
[19:11] he goes on in the second seal and he
[19:12] says now then if amos says in the other
[19:15] scriptures that go with it
[19:17] if you remember on this we're just
[19:18] striking the highlights of it
[19:22] when i get in that room there and that
[19:24] anointing comes in
[19:25] if i could write down what all goes on
[19:28] i'd be here for three months on one of
[19:30] the seals
[19:34] hallelujah i can tell you right now
[19:37] i can't spend three months on one of the
[19:38] seals we need a greater revelation
[19:41] we need god to open our eyes if the
[19:43] prophet of god said if i would write
[19:45] down everything that goes with it when
[19:46] the anointing comes
[19:47] and i see it when he unfolds it amen and
[19:50] i see it he goes if i'd write it all
[19:52] down i could spend three months on each
[19:54] seal
[19:56] i said god we need more there's
[19:58] something else in the seals for us
[20:00] there's more for us lorne
[20:03] hallelujah i'd be here for three months
[20:06] on one of the seals so i just strike the
[20:08] places
[20:09] and let it out just what it would seem
[20:11] to be that wouldn't choke the people
[20:14] but yet not enough to hurt them
[20:18] but just so that believing it would it
[20:20] seasoned the thing you know what i mean
[20:22] so here he's telling you that each one
[20:24] of these seals has a
[20:26] massive amount of information with it
[20:28] and i'm just sprinkling out just a
[20:30] little bit
[20:30] and just hitting the high places oh
[20:34] i'm excited that means there's more
[20:36] there's more revelation there's more
[20:38] word
[20:38] this is the mystery of the entire bible
[20:40] this is the whole book from revelation
[20:42] genesis to revelation all sealed up in
[20:44] these seven seals
[20:45] it's got to be more than what i can
[20:47] explain in 30 minutes
[20:49] it's got to be more than what i can
[20:51] share with somebody in a simplistic way
[20:53] and say well is this white and red and
[20:55] it's got to be more than that there's
[20:57] something more to this amen
[20:59] hallelujah i love that
[21:04] he says and god doesn't call man to
[21:06] judgment without first warning him
[21:08] he said it's hard if you don't you have
[21:11] to depend on the holy spirit because
[21:12] this bible is wrote in riddles
[21:15] you just can't sit down and read it like
[21:17] a newspaper
[21:18] it's hid that's exactly what jesus said
[21:21] he said it's hid
[21:22] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[21:24] and it's revealed
[21:26] amen it's hidden and it's revealed it's
[21:28] not
[21:29] learned amen it's not through much study
[21:31] it's hidden
[21:32] and it's revealed and it's hidden from
[21:35] the wise and fruit
[21:36] and revealed it unto the babes what
[21:38] babes the seed line of christ
[21:41] that's who it's revealed to
[21:44] yes sir he said so so you can't sit down
[21:48] and read it like a newspaper it's hid
[21:51] and i would say you can't sit down and
[21:53] read the book of the revelation of the
[21:54] seven seals like you read a newspaper
[21:57] you can't get off of it the information
[21:59] like you get out of a newspaper
[22:01] there's got to it's hid amen the word of
[22:04] god is
[22:04] hid and it's revealed praise the lord
[22:08] i think that's so amazing because
[22:10] brother branham came and he was a word
[22:12] prophet you can't make him anything but
[22:14] a word
[22:15] prophet and a word prophet speaks like a
[22:17] word prophet
[22:18] and if you go back and you read all of
[22:20] the word prophets
[22:21] those word prophets were speaking things
[22:24] they would be laying down a prophecy and
[22:26] they would be jumping
[22:27] thousands of years in their sentences
[22:30] and you're reading and you think all of
[22:32] this has to happen at this period of
[22:34] time or all has to happen to here and
[22:36] they'll be speaking about a specific
[22:37] period of time
[22:38] and they'll throw right inside of that
[22:40] prophecy a prophecy pertaining to
[22:42] something 2000 years later
[22:45] because that's how a word prophet speaks
[22:48] because the bible is written in
[22:49] mysteries
[22:50] the bible is written in riddles you
[22:51] can't just read it like a newspaper
[22:53] that's why seminaries in schools and in
[22:56] bible schools and bible classes is never
[22:58] going to do a thing
[22:59] to get you to understand god amen it
[23:02] comes by revelation and the revelation
[23:04] is to the babes
[23:06] hallelujah praise the lord
[23:10] so he goes on to say you can't sit down
[23:13] and read it like a newspaper it's hid
[23:14] yes sir
[23:15] how would you ever justify god when he
[23:17] told moses up there
[23:18] now don't you make any engrave an image
[23:21] it's a commandment don't you make
[23:22] anything like heaven
[23:24] any angel or anything else don't make
[23:26] any engraven images
[23:28] and yet on the same day told them to
[23:29] mold two angels out of brass and put
[23:31] them right at the mercy seat where
[23:33] mercy's at
[23:33] see he had him up on the mountain mount
[23:36] sinai and he gives him the ten
[23:38] commandments and he tells them not to
[23:39] make any graven image
[23:40] no graven image of anything that's made
[23:42] on earth no graven image of anything
[23:44] that's made in heaven
[23:45] don't make a graven image and then he
[23:47] tells them to make a graven image
[23:50] hallelujah hallelujah you can't read the
[23:54] bible like you read a newspaper
[23:57] see he says see you have to know god
[24:00] and his nature before you can understand
[24:03] his word
[24:06] he has the key to that word himself he's
[24:09] the only one can handle it and open it
[24:12] and so he's the one that has to reveal
[24:14] it
[24:15] and so now what we find out is is
[24:18] brother branham is
[24:22] is very clear you have to know god
[24:25] and his nature before you can understand
[24:28] his word who better to understand the
[24:32] nature of god
[24:34] than the expressed attributes of god
[24:37] who can better comprehend god and
[24:39] understand god
[24:41] than those that came out from god
[24:44] they they're the only ones on this earth
[24:46] that can receive revelation and
[24:48] understand the nature of god
[24:50] because at one time they were in god
[24:53] they're
[24:53] part of god amen there's an eternal
[24:56] sieging of god down inside of your soul
[24:58] if you're a child of god
[24:59] that came from god it's the word and
[25:01] when the word comes it connects to the
[25:03] word
[25:05] not to your mind not to your brain not
[25:08] to your
[25:08] understanding but it's the word
[25:10] connecting to the word
[25:12] that eternal coming to the eternal amen
[25:15] and it quickens that seed to life amen
[25:19] now those are the ones amen
[25:22] that that that could understand
[25:26] his nature if you didn't come from god
[25:30] how will you overstand his nature
[25:34] hallelujah god is good brothers and
[25:36] sisters
[25:38] that's why when somebody come up to
[25:39] brother brown and say brother ma'am you
[25:41] just don't know your bible very well
[25:45] he said that may be right but i know the
[25:47] author awfully well
[25:49] and i'd say which would you rather know
[25:51] which would you rather know the ink
[25:53] splotches on paper
[25:55] amen there's a lot of people who
[25:57] memorize the ink splotches on paper
[25:59] and have no idea who god is who christ
[26:02] is they think jesus christ was only the
[26:04] man that walked the sea of galilee and
[26:05] they don't know he's the word
[26:07] they don't recognize him today when he's
[26:09] being made manifest when he's here among
[26:11] us in the revelation of the word
[26:12] they have no idea who he is they don't
[26:14] know his nature they don't know him but
[26:16] they've memorized whole chapters out of
[26:18] the bible
[26:19] they've read the bible multiple times
[26:21] they know the greek they may be able to
[26:22] read it in the original
[26:24] manuscripts but it doesn't mean anything
[26:26] unless you know his nature
[26:28] and if you don't know his nature you
[26:29] won't know him and the best way to know
[26:31] his nature is to have his nature
[26:35] hallelujah i would i would rather know
[26:38] him
[26:39] amen than know about him
[26:43] amen you can quote me dates and
[26:47] dispensations and and have everything
[26:50] neatly tucked together but i would
[26:51] rather
[26:52] know him than know about him
[26:55] but all the children of god want both
[26:57] they want to know him
[26:58] and they're hungry to know all about him
[27:01] that's why we want to know because
[27:03] we love him hallelujah
[27:08] praise the lord i get excited
[27:13] so we find that the seals have been
[27:16] opened
[27:18] now nobody can open the seals but the
[27:21] lamb himself
[27:23] nobody you can't brother branham
[27:26] couldn't
[27:27] nobody could it had to be the lamb and
[27:30] the seals are broken
[27:31] and they were preached and the
[27:32] revelation was given out but you still
[27:35] have to have the lamb to break the seals
[27:38] he still has to give revelation of his
[27:40] word
[27:41] amen praise god
[27:45] i want to look at two vines
[27:51] now this may seem like a diversion from
[27:53] the seals but it's not
[27:55] this is the this is a fundamental
[27:57] principle that will help you understand
[27:59] the seals
[28:01] have to understand that there's two
[28:03] vines there's satan
[28:06] and then there's christ hallelujah
[28:11] the latest in church age out of the
[28:13] church age book he said this is the end
[28:14] time both the true false
[28:16] true and false vine are coming into
[28:18] maturity but before the wheat matures
[28:20] those ripe and tares must be bound for
[28:22] the burning they're
[28:23] all joining the world council of
[28:24] churches that is the binding
[28:26] soon the garnering of the wheat will
[28:28] come but right now the two spirits are
[28:29] at work
[28:30] in two vines he didn't say there were
[28:33] four five six spirits on the earth
[28:35] two didn't say there were five or six
[28:37] vines two
[28:39] two spirits two vines amen praise the
[28:42] lord
[28:43] we're gonna get into some fun stuff
[28:46] it says that day on calvary and sin did
[28:49] not start on earth sin
[28:50] started in heaven lucifer the devil was
[28:53] a condemned creature for his
[28:54] disobedience before he ever struck the
[28:56] earth
[28:58] sin began in heaven where god put the
[29:00] angels and so forth upon the same bases
[29:02] he put human beings on
[29:04] knowledge the tree of knowledge the tree
[29:06] of life and the tree of knowledge
[29:07] where man could take his choice and when
[29:09] lucifer was given the preeminence to
[29:11] make his choice he wanted something
[29:12] better than god had
[29:14] that started the trouble so you can't
[29:17] say sin began at the garden of eden
[29:19] sin began in heaven amen when lucifer
[29:23] rebelled against god and disobeyed the
[29:25] word of god
[29:26] that's where it began that's where your
[29:28] other vine begins
[29:31] so there's two vines but the two vines
[29:33] begin right there
[29:34] and then the two vines spill down upon
[29:37] earth
[29:38] and then you're watching this whole
[29:39] bible is the record of two vines
[29:43] so if you read this it's a record of two
[29:46] vines
[29:46] and that's what the seals does is begins
[29:49] to explain to you the nature of two
[29:51] vines
[29:52] and the tactics of two vines and the way
[29:54] two vines operate
[29:55] and you begin to see what started in
[29:58] heaven is passing all the way from
[30:00] genesis unto revelations where finally
[30:03] one of those vines is cut off and
[30:06] destroyed
[30:08] it's not the true vine it's not the
[30:11] eternal vine
[30:12] it's another vine that's cut off
[30:15] but brother ram says this and the sea
[30:17] does not air with the shock notice
[30:19] see how close it looks matthew
[30:35] now now we've got to be very very
[30:38] careful here in our minds
[30:40] and see that this is a principle that's
[30:42] laid down and this principle is not
[30:43] going to change
[30:44] it is so deceptive that it would deceive
[30:47] the very elective possible
[30:48] and in brother branham's day he's
[30:50] pointing to the pentecostal church
[30:52] the pentecostal church and and it's got
[30:55] all the manifestations gifts of the
[30:56] spirit
[30:57] they're doing all of these things and
[30:58] you've got to be careful but brother
[31:00] branham said
[31:01] they said in another hundred years if
[31:03] time goes on the pentecostal church will
[31:05] be farther away than the catholic church
[31:07] is
[31:09] and we've been 50 years since that time
[31:11] just over 50 years since he made those
[31:13] statements
[31:13] amen and so it cannot be that the
[31:15] pentecostal church is going to deceive
[31:17] the bride
[31:20] why because they're on their road to
[31:22] becoming as bad as the catholic church
[31:24] amen
[31:25] they've gone down further there must be
[31:27] a closer deception than the pentecostal
[31:29] church
[31:30] because the elect is not going to be
[31:32] deceived by the denominational system
[31:34] amen
[31:36] hallelujah god is good
[31:43] i want to read a couple scriptures if
[31:45] you can turn with me
[31:48] let's go to isaiah 59
[31:51] no i'm sorry that's not the one i want
[31:56] ezekiel 28. let's go to ezekiel first
[32:09] ezekiel 28 verse 11.
[32:16] this is going to be a perfect example of
[32:17] how a word prophet speaks
[32:21] and and we'll get to see here firsthand
[32:24] ezekiel chapter 28 verse 11.
[32:28] moreover the word of the lord came unto
[32:30] me saying son of man take up a
[32:32] lamentation upon the king of
[32:33] tyrus and send him thus saith the lord
[32:36] god
[32:37] thou sealest up the son full of wisdom
[32:39] and perfect in beauty
[32:40] thou has been in eden the garden of god
[32:43] so here
[32:44] he begins to speak and he there's an
[32:46] earthly king
[32:47] that he's going to speak to and he says
[32:50] he says take a lamentation against the
[32:52] king of tyrus
[32:53] and he starts talking about lucifer
[32:55] who's been in eden
[32:57] why because what is the anointing
[32:59] working in that king it's the same
[33:00] anointing
[33:01] he's not addressing the king he's a
[33:02] joint addressing the anointing in the
[33:04] king
[33:06] hallelujah son of man take up a
[33:10] lamentation upon the king of tyrus and
[33:12] send him thou saith the lord god
[33:14] thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom
[33:18] and perfect in beauty we're talking
[33:21] about lucifer
[33:24] he's not ugly he's not a horned creature
[33:28] with a forked tail
[33:29] and dressed in red that's not lucifer
[33:32] lucifer was an angel he's a covering
[33:34] cherubim we're going to read a
[33:36] description of him
[33:37] and you're going to be mesmerized now
[33:38] you can see why john when he looked at
[33:40] the false church
[33:41] that had been built by lucifer when he
[33:44] looked at it he was awestruck
[33:47] he was astonished because it was so
[33:50] beautiful when you look at that false
[33:52] church decked in jewels and gold
[33:54] and and precious stones and all of these
[33:57] things it's a beautiful sight to behold
[33:59] and when he looked at the woman that was
[34:00] riding the scarlet cutter beast
[34:02] amen he was mesmerized by what he saw he
[34:04] was astonished
[34:05] at what he saw amen until the angel woke
[34:08] him up
[34:10] he said thou see us to some and perfect
[34:13] in beauty
[34:14] perfect in beauty i think that means
[34:16] perfect in beauty
[34:20] it's beautiful he was he is beautiful
[34:24] thou has been in eden the garden of god
[34:27] every precious stone was thy covering
[34:29] the sardis topaz
[34:31] the diamond the barrel the onyx the
[34:33] jasper the sapphire the emerald
[34:35] the carbuncle and gold the workmanship
[34:37] of thy
[34:38] tablets and of thy pipes was prepared in
[34:40] thee in the day that thou was created
[34:42] thou art the anointed cherub that
[34:44] covereth and i have set thee so
[34:47] thou wasted upon the holy mountain of
[34:49] god thou hast walked up and down the
[34:51] midst of the stones of fire
[34:53] thou was perfect in thy ways from the
[34:55] day that thou was created
[34:56] to iniquity was found in thy and in thee
[34:59] by the multitude of thy merchandise they
[35:01] have filled the midst of thee with the
[35:03] violence
[35:04] and thou has sinned therefore i will
[35:05] cast this profane out of the mountain of
[35:07] god
[35:08] and i will destroy thee o covering
[35:10] cherub from the midst of the stones
[35:12] of fire thine heart was lifted up
[35:14] because of thy beauty
[35:16] thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[35:18] of brightness
[35:19] i will cast thee to the ground i will
[35:21] lay thee before kings
[35:22] that they may behold thee that thou hast
[35:25] defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude
[35:27] of thine iniquities
[35:28] by the iniquity of thy traffic there
[35:31] therefore
[35:31] will i bring forth a fire from the midst
[35:33] of thee it shall devour thee and i will
[35:36] bring thee to ashes upon the earth and
[35:37] the sight of all them that behold thee
[35:40] and they that now they they that know
[35:43] thee among the people shall be
[35:44] astonished at thee
[35:45] thou shalt be a terror and never shalt
[35:48] thou be
[35:48] anymore hallelujah he was created so he
[35:52] can be destroyed
[35:54] but we find out he was full of wisdom
[35:58] perfect in beauty all these precious
[36:00] stones were in him
[36:02] and he walked on the mountain of god
[36:04] amidst the fire of stones
[36:05] amen this is this is this is an amazing
[36:09] being if you would see him you would be
[36:11] astonished
[36:12] you'd be mesmerized you would be
[36:15] transfixed
[36:16] if you saw this creature amen not a
[36:19] hideous creature
[36:20] laying in a ditch half drunk and on
[36:22] drugs and in the house of prostitution
[36:25] that's not him amen that's not the image
[36:28] of lucifer that's not the image of the
[36:29] devil
[36:30] that's the that's the false image people
[36:32] would like to paint trying to get you to
[36:34] think that the devil is in the house of
[36:35] prostitution
[36:36] the devil is not in the house of
[36:38] prostitution we'll find out where he is
[36:40] here in a moment
[36:42] let's go to isaiah 14.
[36:53] isaiah 14
[37:00] verse 12 14-12
[37:04] how art thou fallen from heaven o
[37:05] lucifer's son of the morning
[37:07] how art thou cut down to ground which
[37:09] did weaken the nations
[37:11] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[37:12] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[37:14] throne above the stars of god
[37:16] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[37:18] congregation and the sides of the north
[37:20] i will ascend above the height of the
[37:22] clouds i will be like
[37:23] the most high yet thou shalt be brought
[37:26] down to hell
[37:27] to the sides of the pit so we find out
[37:30] where his desire is
[37:32] his desire is not to be amongst the sin
[37:34] and the muck of the world
[37:36] his desire is to sit in the congregation
[37:39] of the lord
[37:41] his desire is to rise above the stars of
[37:44] god
[37:45] he wants to he wants to rule over the
[37:47] seed of abraham
[37:49] he wants to be in the congregation of
[37:51] the lord on the sides of the north and
[37:53] that's where the lord said he would put
[37:54] his throne
[37:55] so what he's trying to do he's trying to
[37:56] take god's place
[37:59] god's not in the house of prostitution
[38:02] god is not down in the gutter drunk and
[38:04] on drugs
[38:04] that's not god wherever god is that's
[38:07] where satan's trying to be
[38:09] where god has established his kingdom
[38:11] where god has established his throne
[38:13] where god is dwelling in the midst of
[38:14] that
[38:15] that's the place lucifer's trying to
[38:17] take
[38:19] don't be deceived and look around at the
[38:21] sin and muck of the world
[38:22] that's just human nature in a hybrid
[38:24] condition allowed to go its own way with
[38:26] no restraints
[38:27] but lucifer is not working there lucifer
[38:30] is working wherever god is working
[38:32] that's where lucifer's trying to get in
[38:35] that's what the scriptures is telling us
[38:37] amen
[38:39] we we deceive ourselves and we become
[38:41] deceived
[38:42] with sunday school stories and images
[38:44] and coloring book details
[38:46] of the devil and all the evil things and
[38:48] all of that stuff
[38:49] oh my goodness that that's not where
[38:51] he's working that's not where he's
[38:53] spending his time
[38:54] that's not where he's giving his effort
[38:56] once he's deceived the people away from
[38:57] the word of god
[38:58] they'll run their own course amen
[39:02] under a hybrid condition in a fallen
[39:04] world he doesn't need to keep working on
[39:06] them to get them all the way into the
[39:07] house of prostitution all the way in
[39:09] all he's got to do is break them off the
[39:11] word and they'll go and they'll go
[39:12] according to their nature some will
[39:14] become drunkards some will become
[39:15] womanizers
[39:16] some will go after business and wealth
[39:18] some will be corrupt in politics
[39:20] they'll just go their own way all he's
[39:22] got to do is break them from the word
[39:24] and so what is he trying to do he's
[39:26] trying to take the place of god
[39:28] and break them off the word amen
[39:31] hallelujah let's go to revelations
[39:34] chapter 12.
[39:51] revelations chapter 12.
[39:56] verse 7 and there was war in heaven
[39:59] michael and his angels fought against
[40:01] the dragon and the dragon fought
[40:03] and his angels and prevailed not neither
[40:05] was their place found any more in heaven
[40:08] and the great dragon was cast out that
[40:09] old serpent called the devil and satan
[40:11] which deceiveth the whole world
[40:13] he was cast out into the earth and his
[40:15] angels were cast out
[40:17] with him so we find out he waged war in
[40:20] heaven
[40:21] amen he did not want to be cast out of
[40:24] heaven
[40:26] he wasn't itching to get away from
[40:28] heaven
[40:29] he wanted to rule over heaven
[40:32] he wanted to rule over the sons of god
[40:35] he wanted to be
[40:36] the king over all the creation he wanted
[40:39] to be
[40:40] in god's place amen that's why he become
[40:43] the vicar of christ because he wants to
[40:45] be in christ
[40:46] place that's why he became the
[40:48] antichrist spirit because
[40:50] anti is against or in place of
[40:54] end time means for anti or anti means
[40:57] for
[40:57] so it's like if i give you something in
[40:59] exchange for something
[41:01] so if i want to sell you this for a
[41:02] dollar you give me a dollar
[41:05] for this and your dollar
[41:08] becomes anti-controller
[41:12] got it it's a replacement it's in place
[41:15] of
[41:16] and that's what lucifer is trying to do
[41:18] he's trying to become in place
[41:20] of oh hallelujah
[41:24] it's so much closer than we've ever
[41:26] thought
[41:27] not over there and over there and over
[41:29] there but if you want to find out where
[41:31] the antichrist spirit is trying to work
[41:33] you look in the mirror because christ is
[41:36] sitting on the throne
[41:37] and who wants to sit on that throne none
[41:39] other but lucifer
[41:41] christ has come to the throne of my
[41:42] heart and lucifer wants to sit there
[41:44] he wants to beat him to it he wants to
[41:46] push him off of it amen
[41:48] but praise god i've been sealed with a
[41:50] seal that won't be broke until the day
[41:52] of my redemption
[41:54] hallelujah oh god is
[41:57] wonderful let's read a
[42:03] couple quotes here in the fourth seal
[42:08] prophet of god said what what is this
[42:09] all coming to now we've just about 12 14
[42:12] minutes here i guess
[42:13] look what this is all coming to what is
[42:15] it it's going right
[42:17] back the way it did it started in heaven
[42:19] it's coming to the end time battle
[42:23] amen there's nothing new under the sun
[42:26] there's nothing happened that hasn't
[42:28] happened before amen this battle started
[42:31] in heaven
[42:32] it spilled out into the earth and now
[42:34] we're coming right
[42:35] back to the battle again you see it in
[42:38] revelations 19
[42:39] when christ comes on his white horse and
[42:42] in the heavens are open he saws him on a
[42:43] white horse and his name is faithful and
[42:45] true
[42:46] and all we know all the description and
[42:47] it says in the armies of heaven followed
[42:49] after him what are they doing they're
[42:51] coming down to destroy him in the battle
[42:52] of armageddon
[42:54] because michael defeated him in heaven
[42:57] cast him out of earth and now he's
[42:59] coming with the redeemed saints back
[43:01] to have a final battle with him here's
[43:04] what the prophet says
[43:07] the first thing in heaven was a battle
[43:10] lucifer was kicked out and come to the
[43:12] earth then he polluted eden
[43:15] then he'd been polluting ever since and
[43:17] now the battle in heaven
[43:18] it's coming to the battle on earth and
[43:21] it's to be finished on earth at the time
[43:23] in a battle called armageddon now anyone
[43:26] knows that the battle started in heaven
[43:28] and so they kicked them out michael and
[43:30] his angels overthrowed them just run out
[43:32] and when they did dropped right down
[43:34] into eden and here started the battle
[43:36] down here
[43:37] god had his children all fortified up in
[43:39] his word
[43:40] and eve stuck her neck out said i
[43:42] believe you're right maybe
[43:43] and there it went it's been ever since
[43:48] so now what you're seeing is the pattern
[43:51] remember when i said you find the
[43:52] pattern the pattern repeats
[43:55] and so now we find out that something
[43:57] goes awry in heaven and there's war
[43:59] and the devil and his angels they fight
[44:01] against michael and his angels
[44:03] and he's cast out and he comes down the
[44:06] false vine
[44:07] drops down into eden before the vulspine
[44:09] comes there's only one vine
[44:11] god wanted one vine he wanted an earth
[44:14] and inhabited by sons and daughters of
[44:15] god
[44:16] he desired one vine but now the second
[44:19] vine that's cast out of heaven comes
[44:20] down to earth two vines start in heaven
[44:23] two vines work through and what you're
[44:25] reading when you pick up your bible
[44:26] is you're writing a book of war
[44:30] the entire book is a record of this war
[44:32] that started in heaven spilled into eden
[44:35] and will wind up
[44:36] finally in the battle of golgan magog
[44:39] and you read it from genesis the
[44:41] revelations this is a war this is a
[44:43] battle
[44:44] this is a fight between two forces one
[44:46] of them is
[44:47] the false vine one of them is the true
[44:49] vine but you find where the false vine
[44:51] went
[44:52] the false vine came down and he didn't
[44:54] want to he didn't want to
[44:55] uh uh indwell the animals he didn't want
[44:58] to take over
[44:59] the serpent life what he wanted to do is
[45:01] he wanted to inject himself
[45:03] in the woman he wanted to put himself in
[45:06] the church
[45:07] he wanted to become material like god
[45:09] was wanting to become material
[45:10] and now satan can't create all he can do
[45:13] is pervert but he realizes what's going
[45:15] to take place
[45:16] god wants to become materialized upon
[45:18] the earth he wants to be
[45:20] a family of sons and daughters
[45:22] attributes of god
[45:23] dwelling on this earth but what is
[45:25] lucifer trying to do
[45:26] the same thing god's trying to do
[45:29] only he does it in a perverted way and
[45:32] bypasses the word amen
[45:33] so he comes down and deceives the woman
[45:36] why didn't he just deceive the serpents
[45:39] why did he start a serpent race of
[45:41] people why didn't he take over
[45:43] and become the lord over the serpents
[45:45] and wage war that's not what he wants
[45:47] he doesn't want the second place he
[45:49] doesn't want the next best thing
[45:51] he's trying to go where god's trying to
[45:53] go he's trying to dethrone god
[45:57] now where is god thrown today
[46:00] where is his dwelling place where is he
[46:02] trying to bring multiplication of
[46:04] himself at
[46:05] it's in the true vine in the true church
[46:07] where so where is lucifer working
[46:09] he's not working in the denominational
[46:11] systems he's got them bound up
[46:13] they're under their own mind they're
[46:15] going their own way he's
[46:16] trying he's trying to replicate himself
[46:20] again he's trying to do whatever god is
[46:23] doing
[46:27] hallelujah the seals is a whole lot more
[46:31] than just what happened way back there
[46:33] the seals is about what's happening
[46:35] today
[46:36] brother branham said when that white
[46:37] horse rider wrote amen we know that the
[46:40] rider changed horses
[46:42] back in the early church he changed from
[46:43] a white horse to a red horse
[46:45] but he said that horse rides all the way
[46:47] to eternity
[46:49] and everyone now the second horse rides
[46:51] he rides so you don't think that he's
[46:53] now
[46:54] only on the black horse or now only on
[46:56] the pale horse
[46:57] amen that he changes horses yes as he
[47:00] moves through his progression
[47:01] but those anointings is still here
[47:04] they don't change they're still here
[47:11] amen first thing in battle
[47:14] in heaven was a battle hallelujah
[47:18] i love it
[47:21] god if you find the pattern pattern
[47:24] repeats right
[47:26] so he god he said god had his children
[47:28] fortified behind the word
[47:31] what do you think they were fortified in
[47:33] heaven with
[47:35] the word
[47:38] lucifer whatever he did here is what he
[47:41] did before
[47:43] what he's doing now is what he's always
[47:44] done he's not doing anything different
[47:46] it's the same thing
[47:47] over and over and over again he deceived
[47:51] a third of the angels they were deceived
[47:54] they had the word they were living in
[47:56] the heavenly realms
[47:57] but a third of them were deceived by
[47:59] believing his lie
[48:00] and they so believed it that they would
[48:03] fight against
[48:04] michael and against the other angels
[48:06] whatever deception that was
[48:08] they fully believed it a hundred percent
[48:11] they believed it
[48:12] and what came and deceived them they
[48:14] lived in a helmet heavenly realm
[48:15] they lived in perfection amen they lived
[48:18] in an atmosphere
[48:19] of the word praise the lord
[48:23] what kind of deception a hideous
[48:25] creature with crooked teeth and
[48:27] and horns coming out of his head would
[48:29] have never touched those angels
[48:31] they lived in a realm of the word amen
[48:34] they lived in the word made
[48:35] material no sin had entered in yet what
[48:38] was it
[48:39] it had to be something so close
[48:43] so close that would deceive them in that
[48:47] realm
[48:49] hallelujah he says in christ
[48:54] is the mystery of god revealed now in
[48:57] the last days lucifer is doing the same
[48:59] thing can you see it
[49:01] the devil doing the same thing building
[49:03] up a hybrid church a hybrid by hybrid
[49:05] members hybrid by knowledge instead of
[49:06] the word
[49:07] by intellectual men instead of born
[49:09] again men building an intellectual
[49:11] kingdom that will outshine christ's
[49:13] little bitty flock
[49:14] what is it that he did he did that
[49:17] what is it that did that fallen angels
[49:21] the bible said it was fallen angels who
[49:23] listened to lucifer instead of christ
[49:25] who they once belonged to is that right
[49:28] now listen close fallen angels what kind
[49:31] of angels luther wesley catholic
[49:33] pentecostals who kept not their first
[49:35] estate like the angels did
[49:36] and has fell into them into
[49:38] organizations like lucifer's main hold
[49:40] at nicea
[49:41] and what have they done organized the
[49:43] great ecumenical association of
[49:45] ministers to make an image unto the
[49:47] beast
[49:47] as the bible said and building a
[49:49] christian economy
[49:50] that will close the doors of this church
[49:52] and others like it
[49:53] see lucifer at his work i'm trying to
[49:56] bring you the threefold revelation or
[49:58] mystery of god
[50:00] so you find out i'm gonna read a little
[50:02] bit more in this quote
[50:03] but lucifer is always trying to take
[50:06] god's place
[50:07] always trying to deceive the stars of
[50:10] heaven amen the sons of god
[50:13] he's always trying and when he can't do
[50:15] it through his tactics
[50:16] his next tactic is to destroy them
[50:20] so if he can't deceive them he'll kill
[50:23] them
[50:25] hallelujah and you think that old
[50:27] spirit's dead
[50:28] it's still alive friends if he can't
[50:32] deceive them
[50:33] when they no longer can be deceived when
[50:35] they can't be tricked
[50:36] when he can't rule and reign in their
[50:38] life without them even knowing him
[50:40] do you think the false church knows that
[50:41] it's lucifer who's on the throne
[50:43] they have no idea they think they're
[50:45] worshiping god just like cain
[50:47] cain thought that he was worshiping god
[50:49] and none of his worship was received by
[50:50] god
[50:51] he had a worship that was totally in
[50:53] vain amen the denomination system has a
[50:55] worship that's totally in vain because
[50:56] they've left the word
[50:58] they if you leave one part of the word
[51:00] you leave all of the word
[51:01] when eve left one part of the word she
[51:03] left all of the word
[51:05] and they've left the word they've left
[51:07] it in allowing women preachers they've
[51:08] left it in allowing homosexuals they've
[51:10] left it in various ways they've left it
[51:12] in women cutting their hair
[51:15] they've left it in men's smoking and
[51:16] drinking and gambling they've left it in
[51:18] every way that you can imagine
[51:20] they have left the word amen so now now
[51:24] that he's trying to get the true church
[51:27] to leave the word he's trying to bring
[51:29] deception and when he can't do that
[51:32] he kills them it's been a pretty steady
[51:35] pattern all through
[51:36] the bible if you read it so now what did
[51:39] they do
[51:40] sold out to reasonings of wisdom and
[51:42] education like eve did
[51:44] fallen angels did wesley was a man of
[51:46] god but what followed him
[51:47] fallen angels got into it what was the
[51:49] angels first
[51:50] creative beings of god but fell for
[51:53] lucifer's wisdom
[51:55] fell for lucifer's wisdom and you see
[51:57] what they become
[51:58] fallen angels and organizations from men
[52:01] of god who has sent
[52:02] went forth to establish truths in the
[52:04] earth before the truth could go on and
[52:06] proclamate and get get onto the real
[52:09] revelation of christ
[52:10] fallen angels come in and took it over
[52:12] and made denominations out of him
[52:15] that's the reason the revelation of the
[52:16] seven seal mystery had to be unfolded
[52:20] do you get the reason of the seven seals
[52:22] being unfolded
[52:23] is because there's a pattern the pattern
[52:26] is god brings the word through a
[52:28] messenger
[52:29] amen after that satan comes right
[52:31] wherever god is remember he's not
[52:32] working somewhere else
[52:34] right wherever god is that's where he
[52:35] comes and fallen angels get in
[52:38] and turn him into denomination amen and
[52:40] it happened every age
[52:41] pattern follow the pattern over and over
[52:43] what happened in eden
[52:45] happened in israel what happened in
[52:46] israel happened in the early church
[52:48] and it happened all the way through same
[52:50] pattern never changes
[52:52] but now he's going to do something
[52:53] different amen he's going to bring back
[52:55] a restoration of the full word
[52:56] and he's going to sew open the seals so
[52:59] that this pattern
[53:00] will not repeat
[53:03] because there's going to be a people on
[53:05] the earth that finally have the final
[53:07] victory over lucifer
[53:09] and it's going to be by revelation of
[53:11] the mystery of the entire word
[53:13] they're going to understand about the
[53:14] battle in heaven the origination of the
[53:16] two vines
[53:17] two vines from genesis to revelation all
[53:20] the way to the false vine is destroyed
[53:22] and the battle of gog and magog never to
[53:24] be resurrected again
[53:27] there's going to be a people on earth
[53:28] who understand that that see his tactics
[53:31] know how he works they're going to
[53:32] withstand his every effort to overcome
[53:34] them
[53:37] amen and he's going to be so mad at them
[53:39] he's going to try to kill them
[53:42] but before he shuts her up she'll be
[53:44] taken up
[53:46] hallelujah hallelujah that's
[53:49] why he unfolded the mystery of the seven
[53:52] seals
[53:52] and so that there could be victory in
[53:54] this battle they did it because this is
[53:56] war
[53:57] this is two vines battling it out
[53:59] through time amen
[54:01] that's the reason he unfolded the
[54:02] mysteries is because of the battle
[54:06] because of the war in heaven is the
[54:09] reason why
[54:10] he unveiled the seven seal mystery
[54:14] oh praise god has there ever been a
[54:17] people on the face of the earth that's
[54:19] had the bible just exposed like we have
[54:22] we understand you grab any scripture and
[54:24] you enter there and once you enter there
[54:26] you can go anywhere in the scriptures
[54:28] from there
[54:29] why because it's one book it's talking
[54:31] about one thing amen
[54:33] it's the battle in heaven that spilled
[54:34] onto the earth that battle is being
[54:36] played out
[54:37] all the way till the false vine is
[54:39] finally defeated
[54:40] and what's going to defeat that false
[54:42] vine it's going to take those mystery
[54:44] truths and the seven seals that's going
[54:46] to give her
[54:46] an understanding of where she's at she's
[54:49] going to resist the devil
[54:50] she's not gonna he's not gonna have any
[54:52] way to stop her because if lucifer would
[54:54] have kept going or if
[54:56] if luther would have kept going he'd be
[54:58] here
[54:59] if wesley would have kept going he'd be
[55:01] here why the word continually unfolds
[55:03] under the anointing of the holy ghost
[55:05] and if they would have stayed on they
[55:06] would have went all the way to rapturing
[55:08] faith
[55:09] but what stopped them from coming to
[55:11] rapturing faith was the deception of the
[55:13] false vine
[55:16] so what's he trying to do now he's
[55:18] trying to stop you from going
[55:20] to rapturing faith because when you come
[55:23] to rapturing faith
[55:24] he's finished
[55:30] because this is war this is a battle
[55:34] this is not this is we're not playing
[55:36] games this is not playing church
[55:38] this is not about pretending that we're
[55:40] believers amen this is not by saying i'm
[55:42] a believer i go to a good church i'm
[55:43] going to be okay
[55:44] and i trust if i do everything right
[55:46] i'll come up and god will be thankful
[55:48] that i lived holy for him and believed
[55:49] his message
[55:50] and he's going to let me come into the
[55:51] kingdom there's nothing to do with that
[55:54] it's about war it's about war that
[55:56] started in heaven
[55:57] war came down to earth and where now we
[56:00] are soldiers enlisted in that
[56:02] battle if you read the bible the whole
[56:04] bible is talking about warfare
[56:08] even the new testament put you on the
[56:10] whole
[56:11] armor of god be thou
[56:14] a good soldier hallelujah
[56:18] this is not we're not playing church
[56:21] friends
[56:22] we're here to defeat the devil and god
[56:25] called you to come to this age
[56:27] to be in the body that you're in to be
[56:29] placed where you're at so that you can
[56:31] defeat him in every one of his the
[56:32] tactics
[56:33] you can overcome him until you can come
[56:35] to the place where
[56:36] every part of that church should have
[56:38] come to pentecost when it first came out
[56:40] if it would have stayed on it was
[56:41] supposed to defeat the devil and come to
[56:43] rapturing
[56:44] faith but something slipped in and sent
[56:46] it down the wrong path
[56:48] amen through the restoration they were
[56:50] supposed to do the same thing
[56:51] they were supposed to come up hold on to
[56:53] the word till it unveiled unveiled
[56:54] unveiled all the way down through till
[56:56] they come to rapturing faith but
[56:58] something crept in and deviated them off
[57:00] of that path
[57:02] but there's a prophecy that says this
[57:05] bride
[57:06] won't fall she can't be deceived
[57:11] why because he's unfolded the seven seal
[57:14] mystery
[57:14] he's took the veil off of the whole
[57:16] story and now we can see
[57:18] and i trust by the grace of god as we go
[57:20] through this our eyes will become more
[57:23] and more and more open till the devil
[57:25] has no more room to work in our lives
[57:27] but he'll be utterly completely defeated
[57:30] and we will be the people that does not
[57:31] get deviated from the truth we do not
[57:34] get sidetracked from what god has called
[57:35] us to
[57:36] but we stay true to the word and the
[57:37] word only and we don't deviate on one
[57:40] word
[57:43] until we go to a body change and then
[57:46] he's angry
[57:48] because when that when that new
[57:49] testament church resurrects and raptures
[57:52] he knows he's done that's what he's
[57:55] trying to stop
[57:57] he's trying to stop that at all cost
[58:01] he's trying to stop it in you every day
[58:05] he's trying to stop it in me every hour
[58:07] of every day
[58:08] he's trying to stop you from coming to
[58:10] rapturing faith
[58:13] but he don't stand a chance because
[58:14] there's a prophecy
[58:15] [Music]
[58:17] she will not be deceived
[58:21] she will not fall eve fell the hebrew
[58:24] church
[58:24] fell the the new testament church fell
[58:27] but this one
[58:28] won't fall she's predestinated
[58:32] not to fall why
[58:36] because the mystery of god is finished
[58:38] because he's opened the seals he's
[58:40] revealed the mystery
[58:41] of the entire book
[58:45] hallelujah we're not going to be
[58:48] deceived
[58:50] amen don't think it's because
[58:54] one big thing is because you're extra
[58:55] special or extra smart
[58:58] it's because of the word
[59:01] eve was indestructible behind the word
[59:06] she stepped from behind the word and you
[59:08] see how gullible she was
[59:10] how easily deceived how quickly she fell
[59:14] and how utterly she was fallen it's the
[59:17] difference between the word
[59:19] and not the word your strength doesn't
[59:22] come
[59:22] amen from might nor power but by the
[59:25] spirit and the spirit in the word is the
[59:27] self-same person
[59:29] hallelujah that's why the word brings
[59:31] the spirit to produce the word
[59:34] this is not legalism this is not half to
[59:37] this is receiving the revealed word by
[59:39] revelation
[59:40] and that word is spirit and it is life
[59:43] and it lives its own life it overcomes
[59:46] on its own but it's got to be received
[59:48] as truth it's got to be accepted
[59:50] and we've got to surrender to it
[59:51] completely
[59:55] he says again in christ is the mystery
[59:56] of god revealed and here is lucifer at
[59:59] his job again today and remember
[1:00:01] the antichrist is not communism the
[1:00:03] antichrist is so close like the real
[1:00:05] thing
[1:00:06] till of the deceived the very elective
[1:00:08] possible
[1:00:09] jesus said matthew 24 the elect if it
[1:00:11] was possible lucifer again
[1:00:13] lucifer again is breaking god's unity in
[1:00:16] man
[1:00:16] he's limiting the word of by his
[1:00:19] limiting the word of god
[1:00:20] to reasonings
[1:00:24] let's read that again lucifer again
[1:00:28] is breaking god's unity in man by his
[1:00:31] limiting the word of god to his
[1:00:33] reasonings
[1:00:35] what he thinks that's right and what he
[1:00:37] thinks
[1:00:38] he breaks the word of god
[1:00:42] hallelujah friends
[1:00:46] that's how he's breaking the unity with
[1:00:50] god and man
[1:00:51] so what brings unity with god and man
[1:00:54] it's the word
[1:00:56] and he breaks it by reasonings
[1:01:00] hallelujah
[1:01:07] brother branham says in the church age
[1:01:09] book
[1:01:11] in the chapter of the revelation of
[1:01:12] jesus christ he says now remember this
[1:01:15] christ in the true church is a
[1:01:17] continuation of the book of acts
[1:01:20] now listen to this really close but the
[1:01:23] book of revelation
[1:01:25] shows how that the antichrist spirit
[1:01:27] would come into the church and defile it
[1:01:29] making it lukewarm formal powerless it
[1:01:32] exposes satan
[1:01:34] revealing his works so what does the
[1:01:36] book of revelation do
[1:01:38] it exposes satan and reveals his works
[1:01:42] hallelujah that's what the book of
[1:01:44] revelation does it exposes satan and
[1:01:46] reveals his works
[1:01:48] and then in parentheses it says
[1:01:51] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:01:53] and the discrediting of god's word
[1:01:58] right down to the time he has cast into
[1:02:01] the lake of fire
[1:02:03] so is he still doing the same thing yep
[1:02:05] he hasn't been cast in the lake of fire
[1:02:07] yet
[1:02:07] so what is what is satan's works
[1:02:12] like we said before satan's works is not
[1:02:14] the bar room
[1:02:15] it is not the drug house it is not the
[1:02:18] the casinos that is
[1:02:20] not satan's works
[1:02:24] satan's works are the attempted
[1:02:26] destruction of god's people
[1:02:28] and the discrediting of god's word
[1:02:31] you want to know where the devil's
[1:02:32] working that's his works that's all of
[1:02:35] his works
[1:02:35] that's a hundred percent of his works
[1:02:37] and that's always going to be his works
[1:02:40] he is attempting the destruction of
[1:02:41] god's people and the discrediting of
[1:02:43] god's word
[1:02:44] that's what he's always done and that's
[1:02:46] what he always will do
[1:02:48] he's not doing anything else friends
[1:02:51] don't get caught up
[1:02:52] in in the in the fairy tales about the
[1:02:54] devil and lucifer and all of that
[1:02:56] he's beautiful he's full of wisdom he
[1:02:59] was a worshipping cherub
[1:03:00] he was he was a mighty mighty mighty
[1:03:02] angel
[1:03:04] and you think you can go toe-to-toe with
[1:03:05] him with reasoning the angels in heaven
[1:03:08] couldn't go toe-to-toe with him in
[1:03:09] reasoning
[1:03:10] when they lived in a glory unlike any
[1:03:12] that we've ever known they lived in a
[1:03:13] dimension that's far beyond this one in
[1:03:16] a world amen
[1:03:17] that was in perfection by the word of
[1:03:19] god
[1:03:20] how in the world do we think that we
[1:03:22] stand any match for him whatsoever
[1:03:25] it doesn't really matter what we think
[1:03:26] or what we know or any of this what
[1:03:28] matters is the word the word
[1:03:30] will always defeat him the word has
[1:03:31] always defeated him and the word always
[1:03:33] shall defeat him
[1:03:34] regardless of what we think about the
[1:03:37] word it's the word
[1:03:38] that's why he says the bride is going to
[1:03:40] have the word amen
[1:03:42] only the word not the word plus anything
[1:03:46] else
[1:03:46] but the word hallelujah
[1:03:51] right down to the time he's cast in lake
[1:03:53] of fire he hates that
[1:03:56] he cannot stand it he knows that the
[1:03:59] people get the true revelation of the
[1:04:00] true church and what she is
[1:04:02] and what she stands for and that she can
[1:04:05] do the greater works
[1:04:06] she will be an invincible army
[1:04:11] now get this he's saying the book of
[1:04:15] revelation
[1:04:16] exposes satan and his works
[1:04:21] so that book of revelation when the
[1:04:24] seals are peeled back
[1:04:26] and we begin to understand what's it
[1:04:28] revealing
[1:04:29] it's revealing his works it's revealing
[1:04:33] the way the way he works
[1:04:36] the way he attempts the destruction of
[1:04:39] god's people and the discrediting of
[1:04:41] god's word
[1:04:42] it's in the book of revelation the book
[1:04:44] of revelation
[1:04:45] reveals and exposes him
[1:04:49] hallelujah
[1:04:52] she will be an invincible army
[1:04:56] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:04:58] spirits within the framework of the
[1:05:00] christian church
[1:05:01] and by god's spirit discern and
[1:05:03] withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:05:05] satan will be powerless before her
[1:05:09] she will do what eve couldn't do because
[1:05:12] eve all she had to do was stand on the
[1:05:14] word that was given to her the revealed
[1:05:16] word for her
[1:05:16] hour and if she would stood with the
[1:05:18] revealed word for her hour
[1:05:19] satan would have never got to her and
[1:05:21] she would have never fallen and now all
[1:05:23] we have to do is stay with the revealed
[1:05:24] word for our hour
[1:05:26] and if we stay with the revealer for our
[1:05:28] hour there's no way satan can touch you
[1:05:30] you'll never be defeated and you'll
[1:05:32] never fall
[1:05:36] she will be he will sorry
[1:05:41] satan will be powerless before her
[1:05:45] why because when he come to eve as long
[1:05:48] as
[1:05:48] eve would stick with the word there was
[1:05:51] nothing he could do
[1:05:54] he could try and he could begin to talk
[1:05:56] to her again
[1:05:57] and reason with her but if she would
[1:05:59] just say what she had been heard what
[1:06:01] she had heard what she would say would
[1:06:02] have been told to her
[1:06:04] if she would just say that and nothing
[1:06:07] else there's nothing else he could do
[1:06:08] he'll walk away he could come back a
[1:06:10] week later he could try it again
[1:06:12] but if she just says what was told to
[1:06:14] her
[1:06:16] he can't do anything he can't do
[1:06:18] anything until she's
[1:06:19] willing to deviate on the word that was
[1:06:22] given to her
[1:06:23] and when she's willing to deviate on the
[1:06:25] word that was given to her
[1:06:27] then he could destroy her deceive her
[1:06:30] beguile her hallelujah
[1:06:35] i don't know about you but that makes me
[1:06:36] want to listen to the message
[1:06:39] that makes me want to pick up my bible
[1:06:42] and say god
[1:06:43] you're the author i know you
[1:06:47] i know your nature i have your nature
[1:06:49] would you
[1:06:50] open this book to me lord let me see you
[1:06:53] in the pages of this bible
[1:06:55] let me know how to defeat my enemy oh
[1:06:58] praise the lord
[1:07:04] satan will be powers before he will be
[1:07:06] as definitely thwarted today
[1:07:08] as when christ withstood his every
[1:07:10] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:07:11] desert
[1:07:12] yes satan hates revelation but we love
[1:07:16] it
[1:07:17] with true revelation in our lives the
[1:07:18] gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:07:21] us but we will prevail over
[1:07:24] them hallelujah
[1:07:27] we got to quit looking in the mirror we
[1:07:29] got to quit trusting in our senses
[1:07:31] we got to quit all of this stuff and
[1:07:32] come back to faith in the word
[1:07:34] we believe it it's the word whatever it
[1:07:37] says it looks impossible
[1:07:38] it's still true it looks like it doesn't
[1:07:41] even fit it looks like
[1:07:42] it looks like it might even be wrong i
[1:07:44] believe it
[1:07:46] i don't understand it i don't have to
[1:07:48] understand it i believe it
[1:07:49] amen because faith always produces the
[1:07:53] word
[1:07:54] just taking the word and believing it
[1:07:56] not reasoning it not questioning it not
[1:07:58] trying to figure it out
[1:07:59] not reading a hundred different
[1:08:00] commentaries from the false vine
[1:08:03] you realize there's two vines two
[1:08:04] spirits
[1:08:05] [Music]
[1:08:07] two vines two spirits we have to
[1:08:10] understand that
[1:08:11] two vines two spirits and the one
[1:08:16] is the tree of good and evil
[1:08:21] and the other is the tree of life
[1:08:27] let's look at these vines
[1:08:31] you have lucifer and michael
[1:08:36] the tree of good and evil the knowledge
[1:08:38] of good and evil the tree of life
[1:08:43] you've cain and abel
[1:08:48] you have balaam and moses
[1:08:53] you have judas in jesus
[1:08:58] praise the lord these two vines were
[1:09:02] always so close
[1:09:05] judas and jesus were like that
[1:09:09] you have to recognize that judas
[1:09:13] was there through all the healing
[1:09:15] campaigns
[1:09:17] judas was shouting and singing just as
[1:09:19] loud as any other disciples shouted and
[1:09:21] saying
[1:09:23] judas was there amen judas himself
[1:09:27] cast out devils they came back from the
[1:09:31] expedition god cinema and they came back
[1:09:34] and he said
[1:09:35] and they said all of them said that they
[1:09:37] rejoiced because the devils were subject
[1:09:39] to them
[1:09:41] he said rejoice not that the devils are
[1:09:43] subject to you but rather that your
[1:09:44] names are written in heaven
[1:09:45] so judas even had his name recorded in
[1:09:47] heaven
[1:09:50] judas was a good disciple not a bad
[1:09:52] disciple
[1:09:54] a good disciple he was so good
[1:09:57] that in the last supper when jesus began
[1:10:00] to tell them
[1:10:01] that one among you is going to is going
[1:10:04] to deceive me they're going to sell me
[1:10:05] out one of you is going to betray me
[1:10:09] none of the disciples guessed judas
[1:10:12] not one of them guest judas they had all
[1:10:16] lived so close to the lord they ought to
[1:10:18] all live such a life
[1:10:19] but by the time they got here that the
[1:10:22] the the
[1:10:22] thousands had left them the hundreds had
[1:10:25] left them
[1:10:27] the 70 had left them and only the real
[1:10:30] believers were left
[1:10:32] and they're sitting in an upper room
[1:10:34] after having gone through so much
[1:10:36] judas walked so far in the word he could
[1:10:38] perform miracles he could cast out
[1:10:40] devils he could say amen to every word
[1:10:42] that jesus preached he could be right
[1:10:44] with him he slept with him talked with
[1:10:45] him ate with him
[1:10:46] fellowship with the disciples withstood
[1:10:48] persecution withstood trials
[1:10:50] amen was there when they wanted the
[1:10:52] stone jesus was there when the 70 walked
[1:10:54] away and he stayed
[1:10:58] so good was judas so close
[1:11:04] that when he said one will betray me
[1:11:07] nobody looked over at judas
[1:11:11] they all said is it i they couldn't
[1:11:14] think of anybody left in this room
[1:11:17] after all we've been through after all
[1:11:19] that's happened
[1:11:21] which one of us is it me lord
[1:11:24] that was the question that's how close
[1:11:27] this vine comes
[1:11:30] cain and abel come from the same womb
[1:11:35] they were raised as twin brothers under
[1:11:37] the same parents
[1:11:39] experiencing all the same things walking
[1:11:41] together
[1:11:42] but when it came time to take the
[1:11:44] revelation of the word
[1:11:45] they showed their colors amen
[1:11:50] so brother benham said about about judas
[1:11:53] when it came
[1:11:54] time amen when it came time to show his
[1:11:56] true colors and go up
[1:11:57] into the upper room to receive the holy
[1:11:59] ghost he showed his true colors
[1:12:01] he could come so far but couldn't go all
[1:12:03] the way
[1:12:05] we have to recognize that this
[1:12:06] antichrist spirit you're gonna say it's
[1:12:08] out there and out there and out there
[1:12:10] but he wants to be right here his desire
[1:12:14] is to be right here that antichrist
[1:12:17] spirit is coming after me and coming
[1:12:19] after you
[1:12:20] every day every single day
[1:12:23] but we have a secret the seals are open
[1:12:28] we can see him in all of his tactics
[1:12:31] here's what brother brahm said in the
[1:12:32] second seal
[1:12:34] now satan raises those up watch the
[1:12:36] shrewdness of this fellow that we're
[1:12:37] talking about
[1:12:39] satan he says in in the first year i'm
[1:12:41] going to jump to another quote he says
[1:12:42] in the first seal
[1:12:43] the antichrist is a smooth fella just
[1:12:46] watch how smooth he is
[1:12:47] he's smart yes sir just takes the holy
[1:12:50] spirit
[1:12:51] only thing can outdo him
[1:12:54] it's the only thing that can outdo him
[1:12:56] is the holy spirit
[1:12:58] and the second seal he says watch the
[1:13:00] shrewdness of this fellow
[1:13:01] that we're talking about here satan
[1:13:04] where we're
[1:13:04] unfolding him right here
[1:13:07] just stripping him down by the
[1:13:09] scriptures and letting you see who he is
[1:13:13] he's right in the seals in the second
[1:13:15] seal he said look at the shrewdness of
[1:13:16] this fella
[1:13:17] where we're unfolding him right here
[1:13:20] just stripping him down by the
[1:13:21] scriptures and letting you see
[1:13:23] who he is hallelujah
[1:13:26] we've got a secret friends we've seen
[1:13:30] the unfolding the stripping down and i
[1:13:32] just say
[1:13:33] if that prophet could take one of those
[1:13:35] seals and go for three months
[1:13:37] i'm saying god if this is the this is
[1:13:40] stripping down lucifer amen
[1:13:41] if this is the unfolding of the seal so
[1:13:43] that we won't repeat the same mistake
[1:13:45] so that the same pattern will be broken
[1:13:47] in this last bride
[1:13:48] she will stand she will not be deceived
[1:13:50] she will not fall she
[1:13:52] will not give up her birthrights if that
[1:13:54] is all because of the opening of the
[1:13:56] seals i say god open the seals more
[1:13:58] and more and more and more to me that i
[1:14:01] can see my position that i can find out
[1:14:04] that this isn't this isn't what i
[1:14:05] thought it was
[1:14:06] this is war this is this is a battle
[1:14:08] between christ and lucifer
[1:14:10] and i'm in the battle i'm part of the
[1:14:12] battle i'm a soldier amen
[1:14:15] and paul says no shall soldier entangle
[1:14:17] himself with the affairs of this life
[1:14:19] that he might be a good soldier and i'm
[1:14:21] saying oh that's me
[1:14:22] that's my position why am i still
[1:14:25] entangling myself with the affairs of
[1:14:26] this life
[1:14:27] i'm a soldier in this army i'm part of
[1:14:30] this battle
[1:14:31] and i've already been given the battle
[1:14:33] plan of lucifer
[1:14:34] and so now i know his secrets
[1:14:38] hallelujah oh praise god lord help us
[1:14:43] help us to see it lord help us to see it
[1:14:50] brother says in the unveiling of god in
[1:14:54] 1964
[1:14:56] he said he said the reformer's taken on
[1:14:59] a veil
[1:15:00] until finally it come down through the
[1:15:02] lutheran age down through the other age
[1:15:04] when finally it come out and complete
[1:15:06] just before it comes a prophet arises
[1:15:08] again what it does
[1:15:09] it foreshadows the word showing back
[1:15:11] here revealing
[1:15:12] what's been done and what's been left
[1:15:15] off
[1:15:16] that the church will be not without
[1:15:18] understanding
[1:15:21] he's he's come down here at the end a
[1:15:24] prophet arises on the scene
[1:15:26] amen to to show back here and reveal
[1:15:28] what's been done
[1:15:30] and what's been left off that the church
[1:15:32] will not be without understanding
[1:15:35] god has given it to us friends and i'm
[1:15:38] excited about it
[1:15:41] praise the lord i'm going to go through
[1:15:43] just a couple of these
[1:15:45] and i'm not going to get in i'm not
[1:15:46] going to get into these because we don't
[1:15:48] have time
[1:15:49] we're going to minister on these for the
[1:15:50] next few weeks you'll be praying about
[1:15:52] this
[1:15:52] and bring your rev bring your seals book
[1:15:54] when you come
[1:15:55] this is the black one bring your seals
[1:15:57] book when you come and we might just
[1:15:59] read passages right out of the seals
[1:16:00] book
[1:16:01] so you can mark it you can take it home
[1:16:03] and you can have it so bring your seals
[1:16:05] book and i'll call
[1:16:06] out the paragraph references when we get
[1:16:08] there
[1:16:09] so we see that this what we see in the
[1:16:11] first four seals
[1:16:12] is what we're going to spend some time
[1:16:14] talking about next week is these first
[1:16:16] four seals is a battle plan
[1:16:19] it's a battle plan of satan and it's a
[1:16:21] counter-attack
[1:16:22] or a counter-operative operation by the
[1:16:25] by christ himself
[1:16:26] so we find out that first comes a white
[1:16:28] horse we're not going to get into the
[1:16:30] white horse but brother brahm tells us
[1:16:31] it's the antichrist riding out in the
[1:16:33] first age
[1:16:34] and he begins to describe what he does
[1:16:36] and how he does it
[1:16:38] but he tells us that that
[1:16:42] in between these and now if you will
[1:16:43] take now revelations 10 1 to 7
[1:16:46] i've been referring to remember in the
[1:16:47] last messenger's age what has to happen
[1:16:50] all of the mysteries of god would be
[1:16:51] revealed
[1:16:52] the eagle amen now you see the four
[1:16:54] beasts that rode that was perfectly
[1:16:56] right
[1:16:56] you believe that and now here's each age
[1:16:59] or each power that rode behind it
[1:17:01] and there is the scripture that shows
[1:17:03] what the enemy's writer did
[1:17:05] that's been revealed in these seals and
[1:17:07] also it's been revealed now
[1:17:08] that each beast power that god sent out
[1:17:10] to combat it
[1:17:11] hits exactly on the dot up to the eagle
[1:17:15] time
[1:17:16] look at the terminology brother branham
[1:17:17] uses the writer comes out
[1:17:19] but the beast power that god sent out to
[1:17:21] combat it
[1:17:23] amen he says in isaiah 59 19
[1:17:27] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:17:28] flood the spirit of god shall lift up a
[1:17:30] standard against him
[1:17:32] so when we find out when these horse
[1:17:34] riders come down through you of white
[1:17:36] red
[1:17:36] black and and pale there's something
[1:17:39] sent to combat it
[1:17:41] there's something when the enemy comes
[1:17:42] in god raises up a standard and he does
[1:17:44] it through lion
[1:17:46] ox man and eagle and so we want to spend
[1:17:49] some time
[1:17:49] understanding what all that means not
[1:17:52] what it meant back in the church ages
[1:17:53] but what it means for me today
[1:17:56] how can i take this and overcome the
[1:17:58] devil today
[1:18:01] the fifth seal he says now as antichrist
[1:18:03] went forth on his beast of ministry
[1:18:05] there god sent forth a beast to combat
[1:18:07] it now watch and every time the beast
[1:18:10] rode on his horse the antichrist wrote
[1:18:11] on his horse on his beast
[1:18:13] to announce his ministry god sent his
[1:18:14] beast also in his own mask
[1:18:16] to announce his combat to it now the
[1:18:20] scripture says when the enemy comes in
[1:18:21] like a flood the spirit of god raises a
[1:18:23] standard against it and so when the
[1:18:24] enemy went out as an antichrist
[1:18:26] god sent a certain type of power out to
[1:18:28] meet him and then when he went out again
[1:18:30] as a red horse
[1:18:31] another color another power another
[1:18:33] ministry god sent another one after him
[1:18:35] to combat it
[1:18:36] to hold his church sent the third one
[1:18:40] again god sent his third beast to come
[1:18:42] and announce it he sent the fourth one
[1:18:44] so we see the reason that these beasts
[1:18:45] comes it's not just interesting all this
[1:18:47] is a lion that's neat and an ox
[1:18:49] what is he doing he's raising a standard
[1:18:51] against the antichrist
[1:18:53] antichrist is coming in a certain way
[1:18:55] with a certain method with a certain
[1:18:57] approach on a certain power
[1:18:58] and there's another power that's coming
[1:19:00] from the throne of god because where do
[1:19:02] these four beasts come from
[1:19:03] these four beasts are the guards of the
[1:19:05] ark they're guards of the word
[1:19:07] amen they're guard they surround the
[1:19:08] shekinah glory of god they're around
[1:19:10] about the throne of god
[1:19:12] and these four beasts these anointings
[1:19:14] are coming from the throne of god to
[1:19:15] hold the church up
[1:19:16] to raise a standard against the
[1:19:18] antichrist spirit
[1:19:21] god has not left us to do this on his
[1:19:22] own on our own but he sent an anointing
[1:19:25] hallelujah an anointing from the throne
[1:19:28] of god
[1:19:29] so that we know that the lion was in the
[1:19:31] first age
[1:19:32] and it was sent to combat the white
[1:19:34] horse rider
[1:19:37] then we have a red horse rider and you
[1:19:40] can
[1:19:41] you can read that we'll read that next
[1:19:43] week
[1:19:45] and the ox comes to combat that now it's
[1:19:48] interesting
[1:19:49] it's interesting and i want you to start
[1:19:51] thinking on this and we're really going
[1:19:52] to dive into it next week
[1:19:55] when when the antichrist changes tactics
[1:19:58] and comes with a different beast
[1:20:00] christ changes tactics and comes with a
[1:20:02] different beast
[1:20:04] so that he's not still trying to defeat
[1:20:08] the red horse with the lion but he's
[1:20:11] coming to combat the red horse
[1:20:13] with the ox that's very interesting
[1:20:17] that when when when lucifer would move
[1:20:20] on and when he would change
[1:20:22] amen god would change
[1:20:25] i mean god's not changing but he's
[1:20:26] coming with a different anointing
[1:20:29] to combat a different power
[1:20:32] hallelujah what is this it's the battle
[1:20:36] plan
[1:20:38] it's the war he uses this weapon
[1:20:41] god's got this weapon he brings a tank
[1:20:44] god's got a tank he brings a ship god's
[1:20:47] got a ship
[1:20:49] god has a way to overcome every one
[1:20:52] of lucifer's tactics every power that
[1:20:55] he'll ride in your life
[1:20:56] every tactic or approach that he takes
[1:20:58] in your life god
[1:20:59] already has an anointing that will
[1:21:01] defeat him that will combat him that
[1:21:03] will hold the church that will stop him
[1:21:04] in your life
[1:21:05] all we have to do is realize what is his
[1:21:07] tactics what is he doing how is he
[1:21:09] working and then i can judge my life
[1:21:11] and i can find out what it is i need
[1:21:13] from god to fight the devil
[1:21:16] you don't always need the lion you don't
[1:21:18] always need the ox you don't always need
[1:21:20] you need
[1:21:20] whatever god can send from his throne to
[1:21:22] fight the devil
[1:21:24] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:21:29] then he comes on a black horse
[1:21:32] amen representing the dark ages and
[1:21:35] famine
[1:21:37] and then he combats that with a man this
[1:21:40] is an interesting one and we'll get into
[1:21:41] it more later but
[1:21:43] you know we're taught so much to rely on
[1:21:46] revelation and not
[1:21:47] intellectual understanding of the
[1:21:49] message
[1:21:50] but yet he uses a man anointing because
[1:21:53] a man he says is cunning and shrewd and
[1:21:55] sharp and he used
[1:21:57] he used that mind to defeat and he's not
[1:21:59] talking about
[1:22:00] what man has conjured up himself he's to
[1:22:03] use a man anointing to show
[1:22:05] that there's an intelligence in the word
[1:22:07] there is a revelation by the word
[1:22:09] that exposes all the trickery of the
[1:22:11] devil that there's actually
[1:22:13] a word intelligence there's a word
[1:22:16] intellect there's a word
[1:22:18] reasoning not a human reasoning not a
[1:22:21] human intellect
[1:22:22] but from the word and he types it with
[1:22:24] the man anointing and it brings
[1:22:26] spiritual
[1:22:26] and scriptural understanding and that's
[1:22:29] how they defeated and they came out of
[1:22:30] the dark ages
[1:22:32] riding against the fighting against the
[1:22:33] black horse how did they come out of
[1:22:35] that
[1:22:35] they came out of that with scriptural
[1:22:38] understanding
[1:22:40] revelation on the word amen that's what
[1:22:43] brought it back
[1:22:47] then we find out it's the pale horse
[1:22:49] which is death
[1:22:53] which is combated by the eagle
[1:22:57] somehow whenever you say ego just makes
[1:22:59] you feel good
[1:23:01] eagle yeah i don't know what it is
[1:23:04] it's the anointing that's upon us church
[1:23:08] it's what god has given us to fight back
[1:23:10] in our age when you say
[1:23:11] eagle you just know it eagle eagle
[1:23:15] he calls his children eaglets in this
[1:23:17] age because the ego can fly away
[1:23:20] in one of these days these eagles are
[1:23:23] going to fly away
[1:23:26] this is the battle plan we notice that
[1:23:29] these
[1:23:29] are not four horse riders even though we
[1:23:32] accidentally say that many times
[1:23:34] but it's one rider on four horses
[1:23:37] that's why it's the battle plan because
[1:23:39] lucifer comes in
[1:23:41] and he comes in the antichrist spirit
[1:23:43] riding on a white horse
[1:23:44] but his intention is never to stay on
[1:23:46] the white horse
[1:23:49] right he already has a goal in mind he
[1:23:51] already has a place that he wants to get
[1:23:53] to
[1:23:54] this is his plan of attack
[1:23:57] this is why when the seals unfolded it
[1:23:59] this is why he's been stripped down
[1:24:01] this is why the bride's not going to be
[1:24:02] deceived because this is his plan and
[1:24:04] method of attack
[1:24:05] he doesn't want to stay on the white
[1:24:06] horse he wants to move to the red horse
[1:24:09] but he doesn't want to ride on the red
[1:24:11] horse forever he wants to move to the
[1:24:13] black horse
[1:24:14] and after he's accomplished what he
[1:24:15] needs to accomplish in the black horse
[1:24:17] his
[1:24:17] ultimate goal has always been to move to
[1:24:19] the powerhouse
[1:24:22] and that's the way that's the battle
[1:24:24] plan of lucifer
[1:24:25] but god has a counteractive plan
[1:24:28] that'll stop him in in the defeat him
[1:24:31] the bride
[1:24:32] has a method to defeat the devil god's
[1:24:35] not stopping
[1:24:36] lucifer he's letting him ride on
[1:24:41] something happened in heaven we don't
[1:24:44] understand what it was
[1:24:45] exactly there was war something went on
[1:24:49] up there
[1:24:50] and it spilled down onto the earth and
[1:24:53] for whatever reason
[1:24:54] we don't really know why god didn't
[1:24:57] destroy lucifer when he rebelled in
[1:24:58] heaven
[1:25:01] why you can ask yourself why isn't he
[1:25:03] god can he do anything he wants
[1:25:05] i mean if i was god and he deceived a
[1:25:08] third of the angels and rebelled against
[1:25:09] me
[1:25:09] i would just smoke him and he'd be done
[1:25:13] but god works by his own laws by his own
[1:25:15] design by his own will
[1:25:17] and god has a purpose in everything he's
[1:25:19] doing and he operates according to his
[1:25:21] own word
[1:25:22] and and somehow either god couldn't or
[1:25:25] he wouldn't
[1:25:26] or he shouldn't or i don't know why but
[1:25:29] he didn't destroy lucifer
[1:25:31] when lucifer fell and now it come down
[1:25:34] to earth and the battle broke out on
[1:25:36] earth again
[1:25:37] but we find there is coming a time when
[1:25:40] god is able
[1:25:42] willing whatever he is going to
[1:25:44] ultimately destroy this false vine
[1:25:46] permanently and for whatever reason god
[1:25:50] is operating this way either by his
[1:25:52] perfect word his will
[1:25:53] for his own justice and righteousness i
[1:25:55] don't understand why
[1:25:57] but god has limited to this realm he has
[1:26:00] made it come down to this earth
[1:26:01] and all of this has to come come to pass
[1:26:04] so that he is
[1:26:05] able to be righteous and to be holy and
[1:26:07] to completely destroy
[1:26:09] lucifer if that's the plan
[1:26:14] then you and i are instrumental in the
[1:26:16] destruction of lucifer
[1:26:19] he couldn't do it then or he wouldn't do
[1:26:21] it then or for whatever reason it didn't
[1:26:23] happen then
[1:26:25] but it's going to happen now
[1:26:30] and we're soldiers in this battle god
[1:26:33] shows us in revelation
[1:26:34] 19 the raptured saints come back robed
[1:26:37] and
[1:26:37] robed in white robes riding on horses
[1:26:40] they come back to fight the battle
[1:26:42] why because they're the ones who've been
[1:26:43] fighting the battle
[1:26:45] we fight the battle here on earth amen
[1:26:47] we go on a
[1:26:48] resurrection and a rapture we come back
[1:26:51] in revelation 19
[1:26:52] and we go to the battle of armageddon
[1:26:54] with our lord
[1:26:56] something something is depending
[1:27:00] on you and i the will of god
[1:27:04] the plan of god the righteousness of god
[1:27:06] the holiness of god
[1:27:08] it has everything to do with you and i
[1:27:10] defeating the antichrist
[1:27:12] every day it has everything to do with
[1:27:16] you and i
[1:27:17] because we've come to the full measure
[1:27:19] of the word we've come to the full
[1:27:21] stature of the bride
[1:27:22] we've come to mount zion showdown
[1:27:25] friends
[1:27:26] we've come to a critical place and we're
[1:27:29] a critical people
[1:27:32] there's no more covering for ignorance
[1:27:34] there's no more
[1:27:35] god winking his eye at the ignorance of
[1:27:36] the people that's not this day anymore
[1:27:38] we've come to full restoration of the
[1:27:40] word we've come to a full unveiling
[1:27:42] of the mysteries that are in this bible
[1:27:44] we understand now that there was war in
[1:27:46] heaven
[1:27:46] we understand now that the false vine
[1:27:48] will be terminated
[1:27:50] at the end of the book of revelations
[1:27:52] and we know that we have a position in
[1:27:54] the body of christ
[1:27:55] that we are part of the army of the lord
[1:27:57] and we know that we have something to do
[1:27:59] in this battle
[1:28:02] i tell you what that makes me that makes
[1:28:04] getting up in the morning a whole lot
[1:28:05] easier
[1:28:07] that once i realize that i'm part of
[1:28:10] this
[1:28:10] that this is hinging on my success it's
[1:28:13] hinging on me
[1:28:14] and i realize that the seals unfold the
[1:28:16] whole mystery and the seals
[1:28:17] unlock the mystery of lucifer and show
[1:28:19] me how to defeat him
[1:28:20] all of a sudden i've been reading my
[1:28:22] seal book around the clock
[1:28:25] why because i'm part of this war i'm in
[1:28:28] this army
[1:28:29] i'm in the final stages of the final
[1:28:32] battle that's going to absolutely
[1:28:34] destroy him
[1:28:36] i want to be a good soldier not one
[1:28:38] that's entangled himself with the
[1:28:40] affairs of this life
[1:28:41] but i want to be one that's focused
[1:28:43] singularly focused on the battle
[1:28:45] singularly focused on the battle plan
[1:28:47] one that's going to be overcoming by the
[1:28:49] word amen
[1:28:50] praise the lord i i'm not
[1:28:54] interested anymore in what's going to
[1:28:56] happen to me
[1:28:58] i know what's going to happen to me amen
[1:29:01] i'm going in a rapture
[1:29:03] what happens between then and now i
[1:29:06] don't know
[1:29:07] but i'm going in a rapture i'm part of
[1:29:10] that army
[1:29:11] i'm a soldier i mean i've been given the
[1:29:14] full battle armor
[1:29:15] i have the sword of the word i'm here to
[1:29:18] defeat
[1:29:18] the devil i am here amen i am here
[1:29:22] to finish off the bride age i am here
[1:29:25] to be the full measure the coming to the
[1:29:28] head
[1:29:29] of the bride
[1:29:32] i am not here to be defeated i am not
[1:29:34] here to repeat the mistakes of luther
[1:29:36] and wesley
[1:29:37] and pentecost i am here to go all the
[1:29:40] way to the finish line
[1:29:41] i am here to utterly defeat the
[1:29:44] antichrist
[1:29:46] which is the devil now tell me i'll lose
[1:29:49] my job i don't care
[1:29:52] now tell me that we're going to take
[1:29:53] your life i don't care
[1:29:55] because i know my purpose on this planet
[1:29:57] now i know i came from god i know the
[1:30:00] war
[1:30:00] started in heaven i know it's been going
[1:30:02] on for thousands and thousands of years
[1:30:03] and i know it's going to end and i know
[1:30:05] i have something to do with bringing it
[1:30:06] to an
[1:30:07] end now all of a sudden it doesn't
[1:30:09] matter to me what's happening in this
[1:30:11] life
[1:30:11] whether i have money or don't have money
[1:30:13] whether i'm sick or healthier it doesn't
[1:30:15] matter to me anymore
[1:30:16] because now i know what my purpose is
[1:30:18] i'm not afraid now
[1:30:20] of not having retirement i'm not afraid
[1:30:22] now of not having a good job
[1:30:23] i'm not afraid now of what will happen
[1:30:25] to my children there's no fear because i
[1:30:27] know my position
[1:30:28] i know my purpose i know where i came
[1:30:30] from and i know why god has me here
[1:30:32] and i know why he's unlocked the seals
[1:30:34] and i know why he sent the messenger
[1:30:36] and i know why i'm standing here in 2017
[1:30:41] hallelujah it's because i'm part
[1:30:45] of the armies of heaven
[1:30:48] and i've come down to this earth
[1:30:52] to make my choice so brother brenham
[1:30:55] said
[1:30:56] you've come down to be tried and tested
[1:30:58] and to make your choice
[1:31:00] and somehow in making my choice
[1:31:05] you know god can't be defeated his
[1:31:08] attributes can't be lost
[1:31:10] but somehow god chose to do it this way
[1:31:14] where i would come down with no
[1:31:16] recollection of being with the father
[1:31:18] before
[1:31:19] no understanding of that other dimension
[1:31:22] just an attribute
[1:31:25] fallen into fallen humanity fallen
[1:31:28] flesh fallen spirit to where i have
[1:31:30] spiritual amnesia
[1:31:32] don't know where i came from and god
[1:31:34] chose to do it this way
[1:31:37] because the attribute which is a portion
[1:31:40] of the original the word is
[1:31:43] all that's needed to overcome the devil
[1:31:47] not your memory of your heavenly realm
[1:31:50] not your knowledge of being with the
[1:31:51] father before
[1:31:52] but what you needed was the word and the
[1:31:54] word would awaken you to all of that
[1:31:57] and start bringing back your position
[1:32:00] i was in the mind of god
[1:32:04] i was i was in the book before the
[1:32:06] foundation of the world
[1:32:07] what's happening the word is awakening
[1:32:09] the word
[1:32:10] the word is stirring the word and we're
[1:32:12] coming back
[1:32:14] out of spiritual amnesia recognizing
[1:32:17] what our purpose is on this planet
[1:32:20] it's not what i thought it was but it
[1:32:23] takes away all the anxiety about life
[1:32:26] and it brings it right back to one
[1:32:28] purpose
[1:32:30] my purpose is to defeat
[1:32:33] the devil and i've been given everything
[1:32:37] in the
[1:32:37] revelation of the word to defeat him by
[1:32:41] how many is going to fight let's all
[1:32:44] stand together
[1:32:47] god bless you my friends there's no
[1:32:50] people on the planet i'd rather be
[1:32:51] fighting with
[1:32:53] amen it's so exciting to know
[1:32:57] he's deceived generation after
[1:32:59] generation after generation
[1:33:02] those that stood and were the remnant
[1:33:04] bride that came through each church age
[1:33:06] they didn't even fully understand what
[1:33:08] was going on around them
[1:33:09] they didn't even fully comprehend what
[1:33:11] the battle was all about
[1:33:12] and who was in and who was out and what
[1:33:14] was happening to them
[1:33:16] but it's not so today because we've come
[1:33:20] down to the finish line and he's
[1:33:23] revealed it to us
[1:33:25] and now not only do we know who we are
[1:33:28] where we came from where we're going but
[1:33:31] now
[1:33:32] we know our enemy brother venom said
[1:33:35] when you're going to fight somebody
[1:33:37] you need to study them study how they
[1:33:40] fight
[1:33:41] how they take a lick how they punch
[1:33:44] what are their weak spots what are their
[1:33:46] strengths
[1:33:47] and that's what the seals have done
[1:33:49] friends it showed us
[1:33:51] the fighting tactics of lucifer and
[1:33:53] showed us what anointing from the throne
[1:33:55] were fighting
[1:33:57] i'm so excited to get into it if you'll
[1:33:59] just be praying with me
[1:34:00] next sunday we'll go a little bit
[1:34:02] farther and we'll just go and keep going
[1:34:04] and keep going as god reveals if we want
[1:34:07] to if god wants to take a month on each
[1:34:09] seals
[1:34:09] i say let's take a month brother bram
[1:34:11] said he could take three months i hope
[1:34:13] we take three months
[1:34:15] but i know there's more there for us to
[1:34:18] overcome with
[1:34:20] hallelujah god bless you if musicians
[1:34:22] want to come
[1:34:24] brother jim if you'd like to come let's
[1:34:27] just bow our heads and pray
[1:34:29] dear heavenly father we thank you lord

[1:35:48] how much more our heavenly father should
[1:35:50] give to those that ask
[1:35:51] and father i'm asking that you would
[1:35:53] give us that portion that brother venom
