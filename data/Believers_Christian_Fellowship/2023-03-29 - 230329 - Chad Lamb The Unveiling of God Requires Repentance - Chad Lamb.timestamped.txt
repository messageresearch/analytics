[15:51] before may we see it grow in US Lord and
[15:54] may there be a greater manifestation in
[15:56] our lives than we've ever had before
[15:57] while we're looking to you and for your
[16:00] leadership in all things we pray you
[16:02] would provide it for us tonight tonight
[16:04] Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[16:08] amen may God bless you while we're
[16:11] standing let's turn to the book of Acts
[16:12] if you don't mind
[16:15] and
[16:16] and I'd like to take for a subject the
[16:18] unveiling of the word requires
[16:20] repentance
[16:21] kind of a lengthy title the unveiling of
[16:24] the word requires repentance and this is
[16:27] something that came to me as I was uh I
[16:30] was I was actually I Was preparing for
[16:31] the water baptism message and something
[16:33] out of the book of Acts just struck me
[16:36] in a different way out of Acts 2 38 and
[16:38] I want to share that with you and it
[16:39] just began to open up for me and so I'm
[16:42] really excited to share it with you this
[16:43] evening so let's look at Acts chapter 2
[16:46] verse 14. we know this is the day of
[16:48] Pentecost this is when the baptism of
[16:50] the Holy Ghost strikes the church amen
[16:52] and they spill into the street and and
[16:54] all those that were gathered for the
[16:56] Feast of Pentecost they were dwelling in
[16:58] Jerusalem and they began to hear them
[17:00] speak in their own language in multiple
[17:02] languages are mentioned there and it's a
[17:04] great sign and to the Jews but they they
[17:06] misunderstand they don't understand what
[17:08] this sign is so Peter stands up to
[17:11] preach the first message that was ever
[17:13] preached for a New Testament Church and
[17:15] this is what he says in verse 14.
[17:17] but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted
[17:20] up his voice and said unto them ye men
[17:22] of Judea and all ye that dwell at
[17:24] Jerusalem be this known unto you and
[17:27] hearken to my words for these are not
[17:29] drunk as you suppose seeing it is but
[17:31] the third hour of the day but this is
[17:33] that which was spoken by the prophet
[17:35] Joel and it shall come to pass in the
[17:38] last day saith God I will pour out my
[17:40] spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and
[17:42] your daughters shall prophesy and your
[17:43] young men shall see visions and your old
[17:46] men shall dream dreams amen God bless
[17:48] you as you take your seeds
[17:50] so the very first thing that happens
[17:52] when Peter full of the Holy Ghost amen
[17:55] stands up he stands up to address the
[17:58] crowd that is confused about the sign
[18:00] they're seeing and the first thing he
[18:02] begins to do is tie prophecy to Modern
[18:06] events amen so so Peter is preaching
[18:09] modern events made clear by prophecy
[18:12] so he says this is not what you suppose
[18:14] this is not what you're thinking this is
[18:16] what the prophet Joel spoke about this
[18:19] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[18:21] ears
[18:22] praise God so that's what he's doing and
[18:25] it's amazing that that's what the Holy
[18:27] Ghost would lead them to amen and and
[18:29] one of the one of the errors in uh the
[18:32] Pentecostal movement which brother
[18:33] Branham said they thought they had
[18:35] received the long-awaited uh Holy Ghost
[18:37] the return of the Holy Ghost but it
[18:39] really was the outpouring of the gifts
[18:40] amen because the Holy Ghost comes with
[18:43] the latter rain which was the message
[18:45] that was preached to us at the opening
[18:46] of the seals amen and the Holy Ghost
[18:48] comes and when he comes he does the same
[18:50] thing the Holy Ghost empowers a church
[18:52] to say this is that amen this is the
[18:55] Fulfillment of scripture amen
[18:57] so this is what Peter is doing on this
[19:00] great inaugural day of the church and
[19:02] then we'll skip down to verse 22. I just
[19:04] want to highlight a few portions here in
[19:07] Acts 2 22 he says ye men of Israel hear
[19:09] these words Jesus of Nazareth a man
[19:12] approved of God among you by Miracles
[19:13] and wonders and signs which God did by
[19:16] him in the midst of you as you
[19:17] yourselves also know
[19:19] him being delivered by the determinate
[19:21] counsel and foreknowledge of God you
[19:23] have taken by Wicked hands have
[19:25] crucified and slain whom God hath raised
[19:28] up having loosed the Pains of death
[19:29] because it was not possible that he
[19:31] should be holding of it for David
[19:33] speaketh concerning him now he's saying
[19:35] amen now you know Jesus Christ you know
[19:38] what happened amen because you men who
[19:40] are gathered here now you were gathered
[19:42] here under the Feast of unleavened bread
[19:44] amen because Moses had laid down a law
[19:47] that that all the males of Israel needed
[19:49] to present themselves to the Lord in
[19:52] Jerusalem at his Tabernacle or now the
[19:54] temple three times in a year amen in the
[19:57] Feast of Passover the Feast of
[19:58] unleavened bread and that's when Jesus
[20:00] was crucified and then now at the Feast
[20:03] of Weeks or the Feast of Pentecost
[20:04] Pentecost means we it means 50 means
[20:07] it's the Feast of Weeks seven weeks 50
[20:09] days and then the Feast of Tabernacles
[20:12] so here now he's speaking through the
[20:14] crowd that was that was most likely
[20:16] would have been gathered amen under the
[20:19] Feast of 11 bread the Passover
[20:21] and he's speaking of Jesus Christ whom
[20:24] you know the Miracles the things that
[20:25] were done whom you know amen that he was
[20:28] crucified and raised again on the third
[20:29] day and we Are Witnesses and it was not
[20:32] possible that he should lay in the grave
[20:34] why because David said I will not suffer
[20:36] my Holy One to see corruption amen
[20:38] what's he doing he's taking modern
[20:40] events and tying it right back to the
[20:42] prophecy and he's once again saying this
[20:45] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[20:47] ears
[20:49] what a message Peter is preaching he's
[20:52] bringing the he's bringing the Jews up
[20:55] to date with prophecy
[20:57] all the things that had been fulfilled
[20:59] was taking place that day and had taken
[21:02] place at the crucifixion and
[21:03] resurrection of Christ he's tying it all
[21:05] together with the Old Testament
[21:07] prophecies
[21:08] and then we we come over here he keeps
[21:12] talking about David and what David's
[21:14] prophecy what David said and Jesus
[21:15] fulfilling that and we come over here to
[21:18] verse 36.
[21:21] he says therefore let all the house of
[21:23] Israel know assuredly that God hath made
[21:26] that same Jesus whom you crucified both
[21:29] Lord and Christ
[21:31] now when they heard this they were
[21:34] pricked in their heart and said unto
[21:35] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[21:37] men and Brethren what shall we do
[21:40] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[21:43] baptized every one of you in the name of
[21:44] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[21:46] and you shall receive the gift of the
[21:49] Holy Ghost
[21:50] so this is the scripture uh Acts 2 38
[21:54] that you know is so fundamental to the
[21:56] teaching of water baptism and this is
[21:58] what I was spending some time meditating
[22:00] on when we preached on that last Friday
[22:02] but when I when I began to meditate on
[22:05] it it began to open and I begin to
[22:08] realize the crowd that Peter was
[22:10] speaking to because Peter was speaking
[22:12] to Devout Jews
[22:14] he was speaking to the the the the the
[22:17] chosen nation of God the people of God
[22:20] who had the word of God who were to be
[22:22] the Oracles of God to hold the word and
[22:24] show it forth and they were gathering
[22:27] together an obedience to the word that
[22:29] they had received
[22:31] and so these were religious Jews that
[22:34] had come together for the Feast of Weeks
[22:36] or Pentecost amen and they were coming
[22:38] to offer offerings of the Lord and to
[22:41] Worship the Lord and the place where the
[22:42] Lord told them to worship these were
[22:45] god-loving God-fearing Jews amen these
[22:48] were people who wanted to serve God
[22:51] and I think it's amazing that Peter says
[22:54] repent
[22:56] and be baptized
[22:59] he wasn't speaking to prostitutes
[23:01] gamblers he wasn't speaking to Liars he
[23:03] wasn't speaking to Chief he wasn't
[23:05] speaking when we think of repent and be
[23:08] baptized in Jesus name we're often
[23:10] thinking of the Harlot the the the the
[23:12] the liar amen the violent man the the
[23:15] the the the the promiscuous woman we're
[23:18] thinking of all of these things and of
[23:19] course anyone in that condition must
[23:21] repent also but when I looked at who he
[23:24] was speaking to amen and what then I
[23:27] began to ask myself what is repentance
[23:29] really amen because for us it's always
[23:32] turning from sins turning from Bad Deeds
[23:35] stop doing horrible things and be sorry
[23:37] for the horrible things you did but in
[23:39] this day I believe Peter was pointing to
[23:42] something else when he said repent
[23:46] so so
[23:49] uh I I pulled up the word here in the in
[23:52] the concordance and we're going to look
[23:53] at this the word repent
[23:55] so the title again is the unveiling of
[23:58] the word requires repentance so what was
[24:01] Peter doing in that day he was unveiling
[24:03] the word
[24:05] and the unveiling of the word required
[24:07] repentance
[24:08] so when he was preaching modern events
[24:11] made clear by prophecy when he's
[24:13] preaching the message for his hour amen
[24:15] he he was telling them these things that
[24:17] you've seen and heard and all these
[24:19] events that have taken place today and
[24:21] have taken place they're all prophecy
[24:23] being fulfilled Peter is preaching the
[24:25] message of the hour
[24:27] and he's unveiling the prophecies that
[24:30] we're laying in the Old Testament and
[24:32] he's peeling the veil off of them and
[24:33] saying this is that and this is that
[24:36] this is what David was talking about
[24:38] when he said I'll not suffer my Holy One
[24:40] to see corruption that's what David
[24:41] meant when David says I mean they said
[24:44] the Lord on his right hand amen now we
[24:47] see Jesus Christ ascended on high at the
[24:49] right hand of the father this is what
[24:50] David was talking about amen when you
[24:52] see amen this this tongues when you hear
[24:55] us all speaking in your own tongues this
[24:57] is what Joel was speaking about
[24:59] so in the unveiling of the word when
[25:02] they ask when when their hearts were
[25:04] pricked at the preaching of the word
[25:06] amen they asked what shall we do and the
[25:08] first thing he said was repent
[25:12] I don't think they needed to stop
[25:14] smoking
[25:16] stop drinking stop committing adultery
[25:21] they were coming to worship
[25:23] these were worshipers of Jehovah they
[25:26] were very religious and they were devout
[25:28] doing their Duty under the law of Moses
[25:32] they were bringing sacrifices and
[25:34] offerings to the Lord
[25:37] so when we look at this scripture this
[25:40] is a scripture that we just read we look
[25:42] at the word repent in the Concordance
[25:45] and this word repent is a combination of
[25:47] two you can see there in that second
[25:50] line under the definition of a
[25:51] combination of the word three three two
[25:53] six that's just a reference to a Greek
[25:55] word and three five three nine it's a
[25:57] combination of these two roots
[25:59] it's it's interpreted repent 34 times
[26:02] and it means to change one's mind
[26:07] to repent to change one's mind for
[26:09] better heartily to amend with abhorrence
[26:11] of one's past sins so the real the real
[26:15] basic definition of repentance is a
[26:18] change of mind
[26:19] [Music]
[26:21] that's why he looked at these religious
[26:23] Jews and says you know what Jesus was
[26:25] and you know what happened to him and
[26:27] this is all the prophecy being fulfilled
[26:29] now you need to repent you need to
[26:31] change your mind about what you think
[26:33] you know about the law and about Moses
[26:36] and about the prophecy and about the day
[26:38] and age you live in you need to repent
[26:40] and you need to accept this that I'm
[26:42] preaching to you which is the word
[26:45] that was their repentance not to stop
[26:48] swearing
[26:50] but to have a change of mind
[26:53] now
[26:54] we look at this next slide I highlighted
[26:56] there in yellow that were three five
[26:58] three nine like I said there's two words
[27:00] that come together to make this Greek
[27:02] word the first word three three two six
[27:04] is a word that's translated after 88
[27:08] times so it's after this after two days
[27:12] after this event so it's just it's it's
[27:14] a word that means after something
[27:16] happens afterwards
[27:18] but this word 3539 means to understand
[27:21] to perceive to consider to think that's
[27:24] how it's translated the definition to
[27:26] perceive with the mind to understand to
[27:28] have understanding to think upon heed
[27:31] Ponder consider
[27:33] so what does it mean to repent
[27:35] it means to have a different thought
[27:39] a different understanding a different
[27:41] way of thinking to think differently
[27:43] after this
[27:45] praise God brother Bennett said the key
[27:48] to the door but I believe that Peter
[27:50] said repent first water don't remit sins
[27:52] the Church of Christ preaches it that
[27:54] way but I believe that repentance Godly
[27:56] sorrow repent means turn around go back
[27:58] you missed the mark start over again you
[28:02] missed something you need to understand
[28:04] something better
[28:06] you've missed something there's
[28:08] something you don't understand now I
[28:10] don't I don't want you to get me wrong I
[28:12] mean I'm not saying if they're your
[28:14] smoking drinking swearing committing
[28:15] adultery that you don't need to repent
[28:17] from those but a change of mind to
[28:19] understand the word for your day will
[28:21] change your thinking to where you no
[28:23] longer want to do those things
[28:25] so of course everybody knows that if
[28:28] they're going to come to the Lord they
[28:29] have to stop smoking stop drinking stop
[28:31] swearing stop you know for Jim the
[28:34] general population knows that you you
[28:36] need to have somewhat of a holy
[28:38] Sanctified life in whatever definition
[28:40] that is to come to the Lord but what
[28:42] good would it do you to stop smoking
[28:44] stop drinking stop running around stop
[28:46] all these things and never know Christ
[28:51] never know that Jesus Christ that's here
[28:54] today amen you can be reformed and you
[28:56] can stop all the bad activities of life
[28:59] and still be lost and go to hell
[29:02] so repentance is not stopping bad
[29:05] activities repentance is a change of
[29:07] mind
[29:08] a new understanding amen these these
[29:12] Jews on the day of Pentecost they were
[29:15] hearing amen they were hearing the word
[29:17] preached the veil was taken off the word
[29:19] the message for their hours being
[29:21] priests and under that preaching their
[29:23] heart was pricked their brain wasn't
[29:25] pricked their heart was pricked
[29:27] there is something in them and 3 000 men
[29:30] were able to come to baptism in Jesus
[29:33] Christ's name amen and now this begins
[29:35] so it makes baptism in Jesus name so
[29:39] fundamental so clear amen that you first
[29:42] first you must have a change of
[29:45] understanding that's why Oneness
[29:47] Pentecostal baptism won't work
[29:50] even if they baptize in Jesus name
[29:52] because it's the wrong Revelation amen
[29:55] it's the wrong understanding of who
[29:57] Jesus is amen but under the message of
[30:00] the hour the right interpretation and
[30:02] understanding of who Jesus is has been
[30:05] unveiled in this day and that's why in
[30:07] this day with the right word has come
[30:10] the right baptism the baptism has been
[30:13] restored with the right teaching
[30:16] so now I'm in the importance of water
[30:18] baptism just went through the roof for
[30:20] me
[30:21] because I began to understand that it
[30:23] has to do with a change of mind a change
[30:27] of understanding
[30:29] when we come to the message we could
[30:31] have went to a a pilgrim Holiness Church
[30:34] and and got as many morals
[30:37] we could have went to a conservative
[30:39] old-fashioned Baptist and got just as
[30:41] much moral teaching we could have went
[30:43] to a a good old-fashioned UPC
[30:47] Pentecostal church and got just as much
[30:49] instruction and how to dress
[30:52] but it would have done us absolutely no
[30:54] good to understand Christ today
[30:59] so it wasn't it wasn't the the the
[31:03] changing of behavior that was our
[31:05] repentance our that all came with
[31:07] repentance
[31:09] but the real repentance that came in
[31:11] this day is a change in understanding
[31:14] from a denominational view of Jesus
[31:16] Christ to the reality of the word
[31:21] so so praise be to God this changes this
[31:26] this understanding this this little
[31:28] meditation on this one scripture we've
[31:30] quoted so many times changes so many
[31:32] things for me that's why that's why so
[31:35] many times you see somebody who will
[31:38] they'll reform but not repent they don't
[31:40] really change their thinking about the
[31:43] word they hold on to certain things and
[31:45] certain understandings and certain ideas
[31:47] amen and they may even accept water
[31:49] baptism in Jesus name but unless they
[31:51] drop all their old ideas and come to the
[31:54] word for their day amen it's not going
[31:57] to have the effect and that's why amen
[32:00] you can baptize in Jesus name in Jesus
[32:02] name in Jesus name and there's no
[32:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost because the
[32:06] prerequisite is repentance amen a change
[32:10] in understanding then taking his name in
[32:12] baptism with the right understanding
[32:14] guarantees the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:17] it's not the phraseology amen it's the
[32:19] revelation
[32:20] [Music]
[32:24] and boy that just takes the mystery out
[32:26] of that scripture doesn't it
[32:31] so if you'll repent
[32:33] like they did that day when Peter
[32:35] preached
[32:36] and came to the word for their hour and
[32:37] how to change his mind a change of
[32:39] understanding to understand the word for
[32:42] their day and under that they took Jesus
[32:44] name and baptism according to the
[32:46] scriptures then there was a promise that
[32:49] they shall receive the gift of the Holy
[32:51] Ghost
[32:53] amen
[32:56] praise God
[32:58] I say God is so good
[33:03] Acts chapter 17 let's look at this
[33:06] scripture together if we could turn to
[33:07] Acts chapter 17.
[33:15] Acts chapter 17
[33:19] .
[33:25] and verse 22.
[33:29] we'll read this together acts 17 verse
[33:32] 22 then Paul stood in the midst of Mars
[33:34] Hill and said you men of Athens I
[33:37] perceive that in all things you are too
[33:39] superstitious
[33:40] for as I passed by and beheld your
[33:42] devotions I found an altar with this
[33:44] inscription to the unknown God
[33:47] whom therefore you ignorantly worship
[33:49] Him declare I unto you
[33:52] what is Paul about to do he's about to
[33:54] unveil the word for their day
[33:56] they knew that there was an unknown God
[33:59] he's here to declare the unknown God to
[34:02] them
[34:03] verse 24 God that made the world and all
[34:06] things there and seeing that he is Lord
[34:08] of Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in
[34:09] temples made with hands
[34:11] neither is worshiped with men's hands as
[34:13] though he needed anything seeing he
[34:15] giveth to all life and breath and all
[34:18] things and hath made of one blood all
[34:20] nations of men for to dwell on all the
[34:22] face of the Earth and that determined
[34:24] the times before appointed and the
[34:27] bounds of their habitation that they
[34:29] should seek the Lord of Happily they
[34:31] might feel after him and find him though
[34:33] he be not far from every one of us
[34:36] for in him we live and move and have our
[34:39] being a certain also of our own poets
[34:41] have said for we are also his offspring
[34:44] so there's much then as we are The
[34:46] Offspring of God we ought not to think
[34:48] that the godhead is likened to gold or
[34:50] silver or stone Graven by Art and man's
[34:53] devices and the times of this ignorance
[34:56] God winked at but now commandeth all men
[34:59] everywhere to repent
[35:03] what's Paul talking about
[35:05] repent from what
[35:08] smoking drinking no repent from your
[35:11] wrong understanding of the godhead
[35:14] amen you thought that you could fashion
[35:16] Fashions of stone of silver of gold of
[35:20] idols and them and worship him through
[35:21] temples made with hand and through Idols
[35:23] amen and God winked at this temporarily
[35:26] but now the truth the unknown God I am
[35:29] now declaring to you and now God winked
[35:32] at that temporarily but now he's calling
[35:35] you to repent from your wrong
[35:37] understanding of God
[35:41] and come to the Declaration that Paul is
[35:45] declaring come to the God Amen who is
[35:48] declaring himself whom you called
[35:50] unknown who you build a an idol to who
[35:53] you build a temple to and worship in
[35:55] your ignorance now Paul's here to take
[35:57] away your ignorance now to repent is to
[36:00] change your mind about how you thought
[36:02] you should worship God and come to the
[36:04] true worship of God
[36:09] that was Paul's call to repentance
[36:12] he didn't say anything about sinful
[36:14] activity
[36:15] he didn't say anything about bad
[36:17] lifestyles
[36:20] it was about wrong worship
[36:22] a wrong understanding
[36:25] and the true revelation of God
[36:28] boy I don't know about you but my whole
[36:31] understanding of repentance is different
[36:35] We Don't Preach Reformation
[36:38] We Don't Preach amen we're not here just
[36:41] to clean up people's lives we're here to
[36:42] introduce people to a living God
[36:45] we're not here just to make people obey
[36:47] rules we're not here just make people
[36:49] look good and have Good Conduct and have
[36:51] good families we are here to introduce a
[36:53] living breathing Jesus Christ who's
[36:55] alive today and revealed in his word
[36:57] we're here to present him to the people
[36:59] so that they can repent from whatever
[37:01] understanding they had of Jesus Christ
[37:03] before and come to this revelation
[37:06] that's the word that we present that's
[37:08] our call to repentance repent from your
[37:11] misunderstanding repent from your
[37:12] traditional ideas repent repent repent
[37:15] and come to Christ
[37:18] what about my smoking drinking but
[37:20] brother Branham didn't worry about
[37:21] people who were addicted to cigarettes
[37:23] he introduced them to Christ knowing
[37:25] that that would take care of the
[37:26] cigarettes
[37:30] amen
[37:33] praise be to God
[37:35] we're not back in the days of
[37:37] sanctification we've come through that
[37:39] but the Holy Ghost still brings
[37:41] sanctification
[37:43] amen the the Holy Ghost that's here
[37:46] still brings a Sanctified life it still
[37:48] Wills a work of sanctification it's one
[37:50] of the works of Grace has never went
[37:51] away but we're not in the age where we
[37:53] stop at sanctification we're here Amen
[37:56] to present the unknown God we're here to
[37:59] present the Misunderstood Jesus Christ
[38:01] so that now in the opening of the seals
[38:03] he can be understood and the great
[38:05] mystery that was in God's mind which
[38:07] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[38:09] now that Christ is being represented to
[38:12] the people and now we're calling them to
[38:14] repent
[38:15] but do I have to quit smoking don't
[38:17] worry about quit smoking come to the
[38:19] word amen come to Christ be joined with
[38:22] the Living God Amen the real Jesus
[38:25] Christ not an idea not an old hangover
[38:28] tradition but the god of today come to
[38:30] him and see what happens to your
[38:32] addictions
[38:35] amen
[38:37] praise be to God
[38:41] I want to look at this scripture here in
[38:43] John 16. this is Jesus speaking to his
[38:46] disciples he said nevertheless I tell
[38:48] you the truth it is expedient for you
[38:50] that I go away
[38:52] for if I go not away the comforter will
[38:54] not come unto you which is the Holy
[38:56] Ghost which is the spirit of Truth
[38:58] but if I depart I will send him unto you
[39:00] and when he has come now brother Jesus
[39:03] said later I will come to you so when he
[39:05] says he he's meaning me
[39:07] in another form
[39:10] and another dispensation but he but when
[39:13] he has come he will reprove the world of
[39:16] sin and of righteousness and of Judgment
[39:19] of sin because they believe not on me
[39:24] the the Holy Ghost is going to reprove
[39:26] the world of sin because they didn't
[39:28] believe on Jesus Christ not because they
[39:31] had a committed adultery
[39:34] not because they lied not because they
[39:37] cheated their neighbor that the Holy
[39:39] Ghost was going to reprove the world of
[39:40] sin because they didn't believe on Jesus
[39:44] Christ
[39:45] the word the anointed word for the day
[39:48] and the Holy Ghost has always been
[39:50] reproving the world for not believing
[39:52] the present tense Jesus Christ
[39:54] whether it was in the restoration amen
[39:57] of the truth of justification or
[40:00] sanctification under Wesley or the gifts
[40:02] of the Spirit under the baptism Holy
[40:04] Ghost every age the Holy Ghost has been
[40:06] reproving the world of sin because they
[40:08] didn't believe the present tense Jesus
[40:10] Christ
[40:13] praise God
[40:15] I love the word
[40:19] brother bam says now look sin is not
[40:21] lying
[40:23] I'm so glad the prophet said this
[40:25] sin is not lying stealing drinking
[40:28] committing adultery that's not sin
[40:30] that's the attributes of unbelief the
[40:33] only sin there is is unbelief the only
[40:37] righteousness there is is faith
[40:41] so you cannot obtain righteousness by
[40:43] Good Deeds that's not righteousness
[40:45] that's filthy rags amen but true
[40:48] righteousness is the righteousness of
[40:50] God so the only sin there is is unbelief
[40:53] the only righteousness there is is by
[40:55] faith faith and unbelief that's the only
[40:57] two sources it comes from the Bible says
[40:59] he that believeth not is condemned
[41:01] already
[41:02] all right if you'll turn with me uh to
[41:05] Philippians let's turn to Philippians
[41:07] chapter 3.
[41:17] Philippians chapter 3. and verse 9 the
[41:21] Apostle Paul says
[41:23] and be found in him not having my own
[41:25] righteousness which is of the law
[41:28] so Paul's own righteousness was keeping
[41:31] law
[41:32] so his obedience to the law was his
[41:35] righteousness
[41:37] but that's not when he wants to be found
[41:39] in him with his own righteousness but
[41:41] that which is through Faith of Christ
[41:43] the righteousness which is of god by
[41:46] faith
[41:48] oh praise God Paul did not want the
[41:51] righteousness of law keeping
[41:53] he didn't want to be found in him with
[41:56] that kind of righteousness but he wanted
[41:57] to be found in another kind of
[41:59] righteousness that came by faith in
[42:01] Christ Jesus which is the righteousness
[42:04] of God by faith
[42:06] the righteousness of god is perfect
[42:08] righteousness
[42:10] okay
[42:12] this is the righteousness of God not
[42:15] towards God the rights of God how did he
[42:18] get the righteousness of God not by rule
[42:21] keeping
[42:22] but by faith in Christ
[42:27] so the only sin we believe the prophet
[42:30] right
[42:32] amen I I allow you all kinds of
[42:35] allowance to disbelieve me
[42:38] but we believe what the prophet of this
[42:40] age brought amen and when it matches so
[42:42] perfectly to the scriptures now we can
[42:45] see in depths that we've never seen
[42:47] before simple basic truth
[42:51] this is what became so fun when I
[42:53] started going through water baptism
[42:54] again simple basic repent
[43:00] blew up
[43:01] simple basic be baptized in Jesus name
[43:04] it goes deeper and deeper and deeper and
[43:08] deeper
[43:10] so now
[43:14] there's no
[43:16] no the sin is not lying
[43:22] but the distance you can have sins those
[43:25] are wrong Deeds yeah there's no problem
[43:26] with that but the real Sin is unbelief
[43:31] so the real issue we have to deal with
[43:34] is unbelief
[43:35] when unbelief is dealt with amen then
[43:39] there's a promise of the Holy Ghost that
[43:42] will make the word live
[43:45] the real issue is unbelief and we want
[43:47] to have the righteousness that comes by
[43:49] faith not the righteousness that comes
[43:52] by Deeds
[43:55] praise God
[43:57] amen God is so good
[44:00] let's go to Matthew 19. and look at this
[44:05] in Matthew chapter 19.
[44:15] Matthew 19 and verse 16.
[44:24] and behold one came unto him and said
[44:27] good Master what good things shall I do
[44:29] that I have that I may have eternal life
[44:33] look what he wants he wants
[44:36] righteousness that is of the law
[44:38] and he wants to earn eternal life by
[44:41] doing good deeds
[44:45] verse 17 and he said unto him why call
[44:48] us down me good there is none good but
[44:50] one that is God but if that will enter
[44:52] into eternal life keep the Commandments
[44:54] now this statement is interesting in
[44:55] verse 17. why call us thou me good there
[44:57] is none good but one brother Branham
[44:59] alludes to the fact that that Jesus is
[45:02] testing his Revelation do you know who I
[45:04] am
[45:04] [Music]
[45:06] do you know are you catching the
[45:08] Revelation he why because if he caught
[45:11] the Revelation he would repent amen and
[45:15] he would be saved
[45:17] [Music]
[45:19] why call us down me good there is none
[45:21] good but one that is God but if thou
[45:23] will enter into life keep the
[45:25] Commandments now now we know that
[45:30] there'll be more who enter into life
[45:31] than just the elect
[45:33] than just the bride because of the white
[45:35] Throne judgment there'll be many that
[45:37] enter into life and they're all entering
[45:39] into life on the same basis every one of
[45:42] them it's the it's how they treated
[45:44] Christ the word
[45:46] that's the same basis for every one of
[45:49] them so now he's saying just keep the
[45:52] Commandments if you want to enter into
[45:53] life keep the commandments so there is a
[45:56] way remember at the white Throne
[45:57] judgment when the books were open amen
[46:00] when the book was open and the books
[46:02] were open and they were all judged out
[46:05] of the books according to their deeds
[46:09] according to what they did with the word
[46:11] whether it was in flesh or whether it
[46:14] was a portion of the written word they
[46:15] received well however they treated
[46:17] Christ amen is written in the book of
[46:19] Deeds
[46:21] and that's where they're rewarded from
[46:23] and can enter into life
[46:27] so now there's a couple things going on
[46:28] in this passage
[46:30] but if that will enter into life keep
[46:32] the Commandments
[46:34] he says unto him which
[46:36] Jesus said thou shall do no murder thou
[46:39] shall not commit adultery Thou shalt not
[46:41] steal Thou shalt not bear false witness
[46:43] honor thy father and thy mother and thou
[46:45] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[46:48] the young man saith unto him all these
[46:50] things have I kept from my youth up what
[46:53] lack I yet
[46:56] what do I need to repent of
[47:01] he wasn't this would be it the parents
[47:03] he wasn't lying about his neighbors he
[47:06] was keeping all the Commandments What
[47:09] did this young man need to do to have
[47:12] eternal life
[47:14] it wasn't to go and do good deeds he
[47:16] could enter into life
[47:18] but to be bride
[47:20] need something else
[47:22] the young men say unto him all these
[47:25] things have I kept from my youth of what
[47:26] lack I am Jesus saith unto him if thou
[47:29] Wilt be perfect
[47:30] go and sell what thou has and give to
[47:33] the poor and thou shalt treasure in
[47:35] heaven and come and follow me
[47:37] but when the young man heard that saying
[47:39] he went away sorrowful for he had great
[47:41] possessions
[47:43] so now we realize Jesus opening
[47:45] statement why call us thou me good The
[47:48] Man by his own conduct proved that he
[47:50] never caught the revelation
[47:52] he didn't know who was standing before
[47:53] him because he could turn his back on
[47:57] God he could turn us back on God and
[47:59] flesh the word made flesh and he could
[48:01] walk away from the word for his day
[48:03] because he he could not value this more
[48:06] than he valued his possessions
[48:09] that man we find later in hell
[48:14] but he didn't need to repent of bad
[48:16] conduct
[48:18] he didn't need to repent of not keeping
[48:20] Commandments we found him later in hell
[48:22] because he rejected the Living Word and
[48:25] turned his back on Jesus Christ and
[48:27] chose the things of the world more than
[48:29] the word of God
[48:34] so
[48:37] when when he tells Jesus I've done all
[48:40] this what like I yet Jesus didn't say no
[48:42] remember Tuesday you said this and no
[48:44] this man was a he was keeping the
[48:47] Commandments
[48:49] but the problem was no Revelation
[48:52] nothing pricked in his heart nothing
[48:54] come to life and the presence of the
[48:57] Living Word nothing sparked amen nothing
[48:59] caused him to bow at his feet nothing
[49:01] caused him to drop his Nets
[49:04] something moved on Peter the fisherman
[49:06] amen when he says come follow me he
[49:08] dropped his net something stirred within
[49:11] him he didn't need logical explanation
[49:13] he said come follow me and he dropped
[49:15] his Nets he says the same thing to the
[49:17] Rich Young Ruler so your possessions
[49:19] come follow me and he couldn't drop his
[49:21] possessions to have the word
[49:24] so he was lost there was no repentance
[49:27] for him
[49:29] amen
[49:31] so this whole concept of repentance we
[49:35] don't want to carry with us a
[49:36] denominational understanding of
[49:38] repentance
[49:41] an old understanding we want a Bible
[49:43] Understanding
[49:46] amen there's two prophecies in the Old
[49:50] Testament speaking of the Gathering end
[49:52] of Israel again and the end times and
[49:55] I'm just going to read them quickly to
[49:56] you one is Zechariah 12 10 says I will
[50:00] pour upon the House of David and upon
[50:01] the habitants of Jerusalem the spirit of
[50:03] Grace and of supplications and they
[50:05] shall look upon me whom they have
[50:07] pierced and they shall mourn for him as
[50:09] one mourneth for the only son and shall
[50:11] be in bitterness for him as one that is
[50:13] in bitterness for his firstborn
[50:15] and then down in Chapter 13 Verse 6 is
[50:19] that in one shall say unto him what are
[50:20] these wounds in thy hands then he shall
[50:22] answer those those with which I was
[50:25] wounded in the house of my friends
[50:28] so we know this is speaking of the
[50:30] revelation of Christ to the 144 000 Jews
[50:33] and the end time under the ministry of
[50:35] Moses and Elijah amen and brother Graham
[50:38] says this and recognizing your day and
[50:40] its message
[50:41] now they have been scattered blinded
[50:43] gathered and are far into the third day
[50:45] so the Jews under the Jews they were
[50:47] scattered
[50:49] blinded and now they've been gathered
[50:52] and under the ministry of two Prophets
[50:54] The Veil is going to be taken off the
[50:56] word their blindness is going to be
[50:58] removed
[51:00] amen
[51:02] you see they were scattered from
[51:04] Palestine throughout the world they were
[51:05] blinded to reject the Messiah and now
[51:08] they have been gathered in their
[51:09] Homeland ready for the trumpets to
[51:11] recognize the atonement
[51:13] as the Bible said when they receive it
[51:15] and find him with nail scars after the
[51:16] church is taken then they say where did
[51:19] you get those scars he said in the house
[51:20] of my friends and he said they would
[51:22] separate each family and who cry and
[51:24] weep for days like a family that lost
[51:26] their only son remember the Feast of
[51:29] trumpets was to do that to wheat mourn
[51:31] for the killed sacrifice they had
[51:33] rejected it the the the the seventh
[51:36] trumpet introduces Christ to them amen
[51:39] and moving them to the Feast of
[51:40] atonement which they realize that the
[51:42] atonement was already made and they
[51:44] rejected it and it's a feast of mourning
[51:46] and of weeping over what they missed
[51:52] and in The Sixth Seal the prophet says
[51:55] the preachers them to prophets speaking
[51:57] Moses and Elijah they preached like John
[52:00] the Baptist the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[52:02] hand repent Israel repent repent from
[52:04] your sins and your unbelief and turn
[52:06] back to God so the message of Moses and
[52:09] Elijah is like the message of John the
[52:11] Baptist repent repent from one brother
[52:14] Branham said these are real Orthodox
[52:16] Jews
[52:18] the real religious serving God according
[52:22] to the Commandments that they had
[52:23] received they were religious they were
[52:26] worshipful they were clean living amen
[52:28] the call to repentance is not a call to
[52:31] clean up their life it's a call to
[52:33] repent for missing the Messiah
[52:36] and listen friends the 144 000 that will
[52:39] be at their end time not one of them
[52:41] cried out on that day at the Passover
[52:44] feast crucify him crucified it was their
[52:47] ancestors that done it amen but because
[52:49] God deals with the nation of Israel as a
[52:51] nation amen they're mourning for what
[52:53] their ancestors did and they recognized
[52:56] we missed it that was the word we missed
[52:58] the word and walked away from the word
[53:00] and all of this that's happened to us is
[53:02] our fault and they repent what do they
[53:04] do they have a change of mind they're
[53:06] understanding opens the darkness and
[53:08] blindness that was open has peeled back
[53:10] the word is unveiled amen now all the
[53:13] modern events for them are made clear by
[53:15] prophecy
[53:17] under two Prophets
[53:19] and they come to a true repentance and
[53:22] Israel is saved in a day
[53:25] they didn't have to stop their sinful
[53:28] activity they they had to change from a
[53:31] wrong understanding under blindness and
[53:34] come into the correct revelation of
[53:36] Jesus Christ
[53:39] this is Bible repentance
[53:42] with that go sorrow for your wrongdoings
[53:45] with that goes everything you did
[53:46] against the word
[53:49] which is Christ
[53:51] and you're sorry for everything you've
[53:53] done against the word
[53:55] adulteries against the word defiling
[53:58] your temple is against the word dividing
[54:00] your body all of those things are
[54:01] against of course you're remorseful for
[54:03] other things that are against the word
[54:05] amen but the thing that you repent of
[54:07] the most is not receiving and believing
[54:10] the word in due time amen and rejecting
[54:13] and walking away and trampling over the
[54:15] word Jesus Christ
[54:19] our repentance is a change of
[54:22] understanding a change of mind
[54:25] this is why you see so many
[54:29] times people go to the water to get
[54:31] baptized without the right change of
[54:35] mind
[54:36] they struggle and struggle and struggle
[54:38] and struggle and struggle where they
[54:39] have the baptism Legos when the baptism
[54:41] Legos is promised
[54:43] promised
[54:46] I say first have a change of mind
[54:49] come to the revelation of this hour come
[54:52] to the truth unveiled do I have to
[54:54] understand it all you don't have to
[54:55] understand it all what you have to
[54:57] recognize is this is absolutely nothing
[54:58] but the truth this is God this is God's
[55:01] way and this is the only way
[55:03] [Music]
[55:04] amen amen we still don't understand it
[55:07] all friends we can't wait for that to
[55:09] get baptized in his name we have to know
[55:11] enough to understand that this is Christ
[55:13] this is his word this is the truth
[55:16] and I want to be identified with the
[55:19] correct word by taking the correct name
[55:22] in water baptism and show that I belong
[55:24] to Jesus Christ not the Jesus Christ of
[55:27] the lutherans not the Jesus Christ is
[55:29] the Wesley is not the Jesus Christ amen
[55:31] of the one is Pentecostals but the Jesus
[55:33] Christ of the word that's been unveiled
[55:35] in this day the Lord Jesus Christ the
[55:38] word made manifest in my day that's the
[55:40] one I want to be identified with
[55:45] remember you can be marrying and joining
[55:48] to the wrong concept
[55:54] and I wonder how effective that is
[55:57] but when we go into the Waters of
[55:59] baptism we want to die to our own thing
[56:00] and die to ourself and come forth in
[56:03] Christ but we have to know who Christ is
[56:05] and where to find him and where Christ
[56:07] is in our day and if we're baptized in
[56:09] the wrong concept are we baptized unto
[56:11] Jesus Christ just because the name was
[56:14] used
[56:16] or must we be joined to a person wants
[56:19] to be baptized and United with the
[56:22] person of the word in this hour
[56:25] like I said we don't have to understand
[56:26] it all we have to know that we have to
[56:28] know enough to know that this is him
[56:30] that this is truth
[56:34] praise God
[56:38] amen
[56:41] both of them says in the Sixth Seal just
[56:44] exactly like them reformers could not
[56:47] understand this word
[56:49] I want you to focus on that statement
[56:54] them reformers could not understand
[56:57] this word
[56:59] because that was the spirit of the man
[57:00] sent to them it's the eagle age that
[57:03] gets the word and the revelation
[57:06] so listen the man-age anointing which
[57:09] goes all the way through the Pentecostal
[57:11] Revival up into the ministry of the
[57:14] Prophet The Eagle anointing
[57:16] which points us to Revelation 10 1-7
[57:21] all the way through that man anointing
[57:23] they could not get the word
[57:27] I want that to lock in
[57:30] they could not get the word
[57:32] but under the eagle age they get the
[57:36] word and the revelation
[57:40] this is really important
[57:42] we have to understand this because it
[57:43] has everything to do with repentance
[57:45] because repentance is a change of mind
[57:48] to what mind the mind of Christ
[57:52] so the mind of Christ has been revealed
[57:55] on this day under the eagle age when the
[57:57] word has been revealed has been opened
[58:00] and revealed and now we can repent
[58:03] of the wrong understanding and come to
[58:06] the right understanding
[58:08] becomes super important
[58:12] now it goes on to say now see if you can
[58:15] get back here under these seals then you
[58:17] can ever get when they're open you can
[58:19] see exactly what God isn't doing what he
[58:21] has done what he's going to do here it
[58:24] is exactly and that's the reason men
[58:26] acts that way because that's the spirit
[58:29] that's predicted for that age to be on
[58:31] them they couldn't do nothing else
[58:34] so we can't be upset with the reformers
[58:37] they were under a man-age anointing to
[58:39] be reformers they did exactly what they
[58:42] were supposed to do
[58:43] but they couldn't get this word
[58:46] because they could only operate under
[58:47] the anointing they were under
[58:49] so there's no fault in them we don't
[58:51] we're not upset at them amen for the
[58:53] things that they didn't see I mean they
[58:55] could only do what they were anointed to
[58:57] do
[58:58] but that's not our anointing
[59:01] [Music]
[59:04] it says in the physio I'm bouncing back
[59:06] and forth between the fifth and The
[59:07] Sixth Seal as he describes this God
[59:09] sends a certain Spirit among them that's
[59:11] the only thing that they can work by is
[59:13] the spirit that works among them now
[59:15] we'll prove to you by the history of the
[59:17] church and by the opening of the seals
[59:18] and the powers that let loose and watch
[59:21] exactly the church responded to the
[59:23] anointing and they couldn't do nothing
[59:24] else now the first was that lie on that
[59:27] Roar that pure unadulterated word the
[59:30] second and thigh attire was the ox and
[59:32] it was a burden a beast of burden and it
[59:34] was also a sacrificial Beast he's
[59:37] showing now through the church ages the
[59:39] the the anointings that have been at the
[59:41] opening of the seals it shows the
[59:42] anointing upon each one and then that
[59:44] anointing is the only thing they could
[59:46] operate by
[59:49] notice after it went in the Dark Age of
[59:52] the tribulation what was it
[59:55] I don't want to miss my spot after it
[59:57] was in the Dark Age of the tribulation
[59:59] what was it there was nothing they could
[1:00:01] do Rome owned had the religious power
[1:00:03] and had the political power wasn't
[1:00:05] nothing they could do but just labor to
[1:00:07] stay alive and give themselves for
[1:00:10] sacrifice it was an ox that's all they
[1:00:13] could do that's the kind of spirit they
[1:00:15] had the spirit of God the ox
[1:00:18] so the ox anointing was part of the
[1:00:20] spirit of God it was a manifestation of
[1:00:22] the Holy Ghost
[1:00:26] Then There came the reformers the head
[1:00:28] of a man shrewd wise Martin Luther John
[1:00:31] Wesley and so forth Calvin Finney knocks
[1:00:33] the rest of them here they came forth
[1:00:35] and when they did they were reformers
[1:00:37] they came forth reforming bringing the
[1:00:40] people out I want you to show that the
[1:00:42] work of the man age was a work of
[1:00:45] reformation it was the Protestant
[1:00:48] movement to bring the people out of
[1:00:50] Catholicism
[1:00:52] so there had to be a certain anointing
[1:00:55] to break the Yoke of Catholicism coming
[1:00:57] out of the thyatyrian church age because
[1:00:59] they had all the power wrapped up amen
[1:01:02] so God would anoint men with wisdom the
[1:01:04] wisdom of God and they would begin to
[1:01:07] translate in the Bible into languages
[1:01:09] that could be read instead of keeping it
[1:01:11] from the people away from the people now
[1:01:13] they were giving it to the people and
[1:01:15] they were giving the word back to the
[1:01:17] people and showing the false teaching of
[1:01:20] the Catholic church was breaking the
[1:01:22] power of the Catholic church and setting
[1:01:24] the people free
[1:01:26] all right
[1:01:29] praise God
[1:01:31] the physio again he says now notice the
[1:01:33] Beast the third Beast now was the
[1:01:35] cunningness of a man and he represented
[1:01:38] the reformers that went forth from the
[1:01:40] idol of pagan now jumped down to
[1:01:41] paragraph 178 notice idolatry brought
[1:01:44] the man Beast went forth with the power
[1:01:46] of God by wisdom that God gave him and
[1:01:49] brought the church from idolatry back to
[1:01:51] God
[1:01:52] that was the anointing of the man age
[1:01:55] and that was what the man age was
[1:01:57] supposed to do break the power of
[1:02:00] idolatry the Catholic church and bring
[1:02:01] them out of that system and then God
[1:02:04] would use their cunningness Amendment
[1:02:06] and and all of a sudden there would be
[1:02:08] in this age all kinds of inventions and
[1:02:10] printing press and and works of
[1:02:12] translation taking place and and a great
[1:02:15] uh a great move to get the word out to
[1:02:18] get the Bibles out to people amen and
[1:02:20] they did this and with the cunningness
[1:02:22] that they had the ability to debate and
[1:02:24] to write they would write books and
[1:02:26] distribute books and distribute material
[1:02:27] showing the fallacy of the church
[1:02:31] that's true
[1:02:33] but I think that anointing lingered a
[1:02:35] little bit long
[1:02:37] because they kept coming out and coming
[1:02:39] out and coming out and coming out and
[1:02:40] coming out until we have how many
[1:02:42] denominations now
[1:02:44] because that anointing remained and they
[1:02:47] were there Amen to use their intellect
[1:02:49] and wisdom to find fault and remove the
[1:02:51] people and they kept finding fault and
[1:02:53] removing the people that's why I don't
[1:02:54] think we should have a manage anointing
[1:02:56] in this message
[1:02:58] Define fault and pull people aside and
[1:03:00] start another church and start another
[1:03:02] movement that should have died in the
[1:03:04] Reformation
[1:03:05] but I'm afraid that Spirits moved over
[1:03:09] people operating under the wrong
[1:03:11] anointing
[1:03:14] so they use their wisdom to find a
[1:03:16] problem in the doctor finally knew
[1:03:17] something and they analyze and all of a
[1:03:19] sudden they they get a little group of
[1:03:21] people pulled off to the side and they
[1:03:23] break the power of the local church and
[1:03:25] pull people out that's protestantism
[1:03:28] friends we're beyond that
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:35] praise God at least we should be beyond
[1:03:37] that the bride must be because there's a
[1:03:40] different anointing on this Edge
[1:03:44] praise be to God
[1:03:49] so now that was the three anointings the
[1:03:53] lion the ox the man now in the fifth
[1:03:55] year I'm going to read it from you it's
[1:03:56] a lengthy one
[1:03:58] from the fifth seal he says now notice
[1:04:00] now the fourth Beast that was sent
[1:04:02] fourth to combat the Antichrist and the
[1:04:04] last Beast are you ready the last Beast
[1:04:06] that was sent forth or the last power to
[1:04:08] combat the Antichrist who was against
[1:04:10] the teaching of God the Antichrist was
[1:04:13] an eagle
[1:04:15] the fourth living Beast was an eagle now
[1:04:18] you just studied the ages study the
[1:04:19] scriptures it's an eagle and in the
[1:04:21] Bible the last age was an eagle age and
[1:04:23] God Likens the eagle To His prophets now
[1:04:26] watch the last stage the eagle age a
[1:04:28] revealer of the true word what's the
[1:04:31] eagle age it's a prophetic age ego is
[1:04:34] typed with Prophet amen and it's a
[1:04:36] revealer of the true word which is what
[1:04:40] the man age could not do
[1:04:43] right
[1:04:45] before God moves into action like he did
[1:04:47] in the days of Noah he sent forth an
[1:04:49] eagle
[1:04:50] when he brought Israel on Pharaoh's Army
[1:04:52] was ready to go he sent an eagle every
[1:04:54] time he sends an eagle at the last end
[1:04:56] of it and here he sends an eagle again
[1:04:58] that's exactly with the word so how can
[1:05:01] you make it anything else he sends an
[1:05:03] eagle why a revealer of the truth that's
[1:05:06] been Fallen all through the age so how
[1:05:08] in the world could the ox or the the man
[1:05:11] or whatever Beast was riding how could
[1:05:13] it ever be revealed until the Eagles
[1:05:15] come
[1:05:16] we know this but I just want to
[1:05:18] reinforce it the the true revelation of
[1:05:20] the Bible could never come until the
[1:05:22] eagle anointing
[1:05:25] they had their place they were Godly
[1:05:28] sent beasts just the same as anybody
[1:05:29] else was the lion that was the original
[1:05:31] there's where the Antichrist come up in
[1:05:33] combat then he raised up another Power
[1:05:35] he sent a power to meet it then he
[1:05:37] raised up another power and he sent
[1:05:38] another power to meet him and then at
[1:05:40] the last power he brings down the eagle
[1:05:43] to restore the children back to the
[1:05:44] original Faith again of the fathers the
[1:05:47] eagle age then did you notice there's no
[1:05:49] more beast that's all of it
[1:05:52] that's the end now if you will take now
[1:05:55] Revelations 10 1-7 he's going to attach
[1:05:58] its right to Revelation 10 1-7
[1:06:01] remember in the last messenger's age
[1:06:04] what was to happen all the mysteries of
[1:06:07] God would be revealed the eagle
[1:06:12] praise God
[1:06:14] I want to look at this next quote from
[1:06:16] thirst
[1:06:16] everyone says we always say today people
[1:06:19] try to say we compare we've got to
[1:06:21] compare Bible leaf with Bible leaf
[1:06:24] scripture with scripture that isn't the
[1:06:27] truth
[1:06:29] I'm glad brother Branham said it not me
[1:06:31] because you'd be scratching our head
[1:06:35] listen
[1:06:36] if I believe with my belief scripture
[1:06:38] with scripture that isn't the truth no
[1:06:40] it isn't the truth this Greek word means
[1:06:42] this and this means that the Greeks
[1:06:44] themselves way back in the Nicene
[1:06:46] Council and them writers back in there
[1:06:48] they had different forms one believed
[1:06:50] this way this Greek scholar meant this
[1:06:52] and the other one said this one minute
[1:06:53] this way and they fussed over it we
[1:06:56] don't need interpretation of Greek
[1:06:58] Scholars or Greek words to know him is
[1:07:01] life the person Christ himself not
[1:07:04] comparing when he says not comparing he
[1:07:06] means not comparing scripture with
[1:07:08] scripture
[1:07:10] it's a revelation that God built his
[1:07:12] church upon and it won't and if if we
[1:07:15] don't if we don't build upon that same
[1:07:17] church the Bible said Abel by faith and
[1:07:20] faith is a divine revelation see faith
[1:07:22] is a divine revelation all right the
[1:07:24] this whole thing is built upon the
[1:07:27] Revelation then and unless this is
[1:07:29] revealed to you Jesus said I thank thee
[1:07:31] father that thou has hid these things
[1:07:33] from the wise of this world and revealed
[1:07:35] it to babes such as we'll learn
[1:07:39] oh I really like this quote
[1:07:43] I really like this because we are not to
[1:07:47] use what we learned in the man age to
[1:07:50] understand the Bible
[1:07:53] sounds so odd
[1:07:55] but I want you to realize
[1:07:58] every piece of written material that you
[1:08:03] find in a Bible bookstore was written
[1:08:05] under the manage anointing and the man
[1:08:07] age cannot get this word or the correct
[1:08:10] revelation of the Bible
[1:08:16] you cannot walk into a Bible bookstore
[1:08:19] and find the correct interpretation of
[1:08:22] the word
[1:08:23] now many men they got some things right
[1:08:26] they weren't all wrong they did it's not
[1:08:28] like everything they said was an error
[1:08:30] God was bringing truth up and restoring
[1:08:32] truth but they couldn't get the full
[1:08:34] word amen they couldn't get the word or
[1:08:36] the Revelation the man age anointing was
[1:08:39] not anointed for that work they were
[1:08:41] anointed to break the Yoke of
[1:08:43] Catholicism and pull the people out
[1:08:46] that's what they were anointed for amen
[1:08:48] they were not anointed to get the true
[1:08:50] revelation of the whole book
[1:08:54] so I don't believe that you're going to
[1:08:56] go in there and I I won't walk into the
[1:08:58] Bible bookstore and say every word and
[1:08:59] here's a lie
[1:09:01] because there's some Bibles in there
[1:09:04] but the point is that anointing is not
[1:09:08] the anointing we rely on to get the
[1:09:10] revelation of the word
[1:09:12] that is not the anointing we turn to
[1:09:14] that is not the source for us every
[1:09:17] Bible school every single Bible school
[1:09:21] is under the manage anointing
[1:09:25] there's not one Bible school that's not
[1:09:27] under the management
[1:09:28] right
[1:09:29] there is no Bible curriculum
[1:09:33] are you hearing me
[1:09:36] there is no Bible curriculum that is not
[1:09:40] under the manage anointing
[1:09:42] because the ox didn't come up with it
[1:09:44] the manage did
[1:09:47] but the manage could not come the manage
[1:09:50] could not understand this word
[1:09:53] they could translate it from one
[1:09:55] language to another
[1:09:57] they could understand what the original
[1:09:59] Greek was and get the word that is as
[1:10:01] close to that meaning as possible and
[1:10:04] they could understand by the the surface
[1:10:06] reading of the Bible what the Bible was
[1:10:09] telling us on the surface amen but we
[1:10:11] know that they didn't understand it
[1:10:13] because they couldn't even get water
[1:10:14] baptism in Jesus name right which
[1:10:17] doesn't take a revelation it just takes
[1:10:19] reading the Bible
[1:10:22] so the mayonnaise anointing cannot see
[1:10:24] the word
[1:10:27] only the eagle anointing can
[1:10:29] that's why we must be operating Under
[1:10:32] The Eagle anointing amen and we must be
[1:10:35] careful over where we get our
[1:10:37] information
[1:10:39] because the man age could not get this
[1:10:41] word
[1:10:42] period so you're not going to find a
[1:10:44] Bible curriculum that has the right
[1:10:46] interpretation of the word it doesn't
[1:10:47] exist it's under the manage anointing
[1:10:49] you're not going to find a bible school
[1:10:50] that is under the right anointing it
[1:10:52] doesn't exist it's under the manage
[1:10:54] anointing and we are not in the man age
[1:10:57] this is the eagle age
[1:10:59] that's why God sent a prophet to us with
[1:11:02] the son of man Ministry working in his
[1:11:04] lives Amen to give us the perfect
[1:11:06] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:11:07] Vindication and that's why God sent a
[1:11:10] man with a seventh grade education who
[1:11:12] would stand in the pulpit and and get
[1:11:14] his words wrong and mispronounce and use
[1:11:16] the wrong word in the wrong place and
[1:11:17] get it wrong and try to fix it next time
[1:11:19] he comes to the pulpit and this is the
[1:11:21] man who is not able to stay on his nose
[1:11:23] this is the man who doesn't know always
[1:11:25] know how to read the words out of the
[1:11:26] Bible and he has somebody stand up Jack
[1:11:28] Moore read it for him used to have his
[1:11:30] fiance read it for him amen and then he
[1:11:32] says I I can't explain it I don't have
[1:11:34] uh he goes I don't have education enough
[1:11:37] to preach he goes I can't explain it to
[1:11:40] you but I know what I'm talking about
[1:11:42] [Music]
[1:11:43] why would God use that because it's
[1:11:46] coming back to the basis of Revelation
[1:11:48] not education amen man wanted it
[1:11:52] education under a man-age anointing but
[1:11:54] this age is not education this age is
[1:11:57] revelation that's why when the prophet
[1:12:00] preaches he'll drop something here he
[1:12:02] goes in all kinds of stories and all
[1:12:04] kinds of Parables and he moves all the
[1:12:06] way around then he hits it the next
[1:12:08] Sunday or that evening or later in the
[1:12:10] service amen and you don't catch it when
[1:12:12] you read it the first time you don't
[1:12:13] catch it when you when you listen to it
[1:12:15] the first time but all of a sudden
[1:12:17] you're driving down the road or you're
[1:12:18] sitting and reading and all of a sudden
[1:12:20] it's like a lightning bolt hit you in
[1:12:21] the head and says aha that's it that's
[1:12:24] what he meant
[1:12:26] because we're not under a man-age
[1:12:28] anointing
[1:12:30] an eagle anointed
[1:12:33] supposed to be by revelation
[1:12:38] praise God
[1:12:40] so I think it behooves us
[1:12:42] to go to the right source for all of our
[1:12:44] information
[1:12:47] I think all of our information
[1:12:50] should come from the Bible and the
[1:12:52] message
[1:12:54] because what is the message it is the
[1:12:56] correct interpretation of the Bible
[1:13:00] under a prophetic Ministry
[1:13:05] so
[1:13:07] I I think it behooves us
[1:13:09] to not operate under a manage anointing
[1:13:12] to not allow those things to creep in
[1:13:15] keep them at Bay
[1:13:17] and stay with the eagle anointing the
[1:13:20] eagle of our age
[1:13:23] it's very important
[1:13:26] brother random goes to tell us
[1:13:29] that there's time for a former and a lot
[1:13:32] of rain there's a teaching rain there's
[1:13:34] also a harvest rain a former and a
[1:13:36] ladder and brother Branham brings both
[1:13:38] the former and the latter rain
[1:13:40] he restores the correct teaching that
[1:13:42] was lost through the church ages and he
[1:13:44] brings the latter rain which was the
[1:13:46] Revelation that was sealed in the book
[1:13:51] and if we want the true understanding of
[1:13:54] the Bible we have to get the latter rain
[1:13:57] we have to get the opening of the seals
[1:14:00] he says and recognize your day's message
[1:14:02] he said the Bible
[1:14:03] God God is not this is just not someone
[1:14:06] trying to press something into you but
[1:14:08] to reveal to you the very spiritual
[1:14:10] application of this hour
[1:14:12] and then the next message that opened up
[1:14:14] the Seven Seals which undone all the
[1:14:17] hidden mysteries of the Bible the
[1:14:19] doctrines and so forth
[1:14:21] where do you get the correct Doctrine
[1:14:23] where do you get the doctrine just means
[1:14:24] teaching where do you get the correct
[1:14:25] teaching it opened up under the seals
[1:14:28] the seals was the evidence that the
[1:14:29] teaching was right
[1:14:32] he says but since the opening of those
[1:14:34] Seven Seals of them Angels just beyond
[1:14:37] the mountain Yonder this has become a
[1:14:40] new book
[1:14:42] it's the things that's been hid is being
[1:14:45] revealed as God promised in Revelation
[1:14:47] 10 he would do it
[1:14:50] so brother Branham says after the
[1:14:53] opening of the seals after them angels
[1:14:55] and all that experience happened and you
[1:14:56] come and preach to see us he said this
[1:14:58] has become a new book
[1:15:02] even brother Branham
[1:15:05] amen was working back under a mayonnaise
[1:15:07] anointing when he was reaching out to
[1:15:09] the Pentecostals
[1:15:11] and even his understanding of many
[1:15:15] things changed
[1:15:17] is that right
[1:15:18] and even he didn't even know what the
[1:15:20] seals were
[1:15:22] until the Angels Came to him one by one
[1:15:24] every day and gave him the revelation of
[1:15:26] that he didn't know he didn't get that
[1:15:29] from the man age this was something that
[1:15:31] was beyond the man-aid this was the
[1:15:33] inter correct interpretation of the
[1:15:34] great mystery of the Bible and it came
[1:15:36] at the opening of the seals
[1:15:38] so even brother Branham he says this
[1:15:41] became a new book
[1:15:43] it even read different for him
[1:15:46] it should definitely read different for
[1:15:48] us
[1:15:49] under the full opening of the word we
[1:15:52] can't go back and read scriptures the
[1:15:54] same way we read them before
[1:15:58] amen there's many scriptures
[1:16:01] I could never read again
[1:16:03] go back and read Genesis I mean I read
[1:16:05] them again but I can't read them with
[1:16:06] the same understanding
[1:16:08] go back and read Genesis when they ate
[1:16:11] of the fruit of the tree and where does
[1:16:12] your mind go
[1:16:15] amen when they made themselves coverings
[1:16:17] of fig leaves and and hid from the Lord
[1:16:19] where does your mind go amen now when
[1:16:21] you see the story of Esther where does
[1:16:22] your mind go when you think about Ruth
[1:16:24] cleaning in the field and Ruth laying at
[1:16:25] boaz's feet and Boaz doing the Kinsmen
[1:16:27] Redeemer work and coming back and sowing
[1:16:29] in her a mysterious sea the hidden
[1:16:32] mysterious seventh portion of seed
[1:16:35] where do we get that from by the
[1:16:37] revelation of the open book amen that's
[1:16:40] where those things come from
[1:16:43] you don't get it from a surface reading
[1:16:45] and understanding the Greek words
[1:16:49] it's the hidden Mystery that's been
[1:16:51] hidden in the book amen remember and
[1:16:53] Junior Jackson's dream there was a great
[1:16:55] pyramid of stone there and brother
[1:16:56] Branham there was there was writing all
[1:16:58] around the stone and he was walking
[1:16:59] around this Great Pyramid and he was
[1:17:01] interpreting all the writing on the
[1:17:03] outside amen that's when the prophet was
[1:17:06] tying together the Loose Ends all the
[1:17:08] doctors of the seven Church ages but
[1:17:10] after he had finished interpreting all
[1:17:11] the writing on the outside amen there
[1:17:14] was something inside this rock in this
[1:17:16] pyramid that no light had ever shined on
[1:17:19] before amen so he raised his hand in the
[1:17:22] air he got a sharp instrument peeled the
[1:17:24] top off said there was White Rock with
[1:17:26] nothing written on it
[1:17:28] what is he talking about he's talking
[1:17:30] about Revelations 10 1-7 where the seven
[1:17:33] Thunders were never written in the Bible
[1:17:36] they're all through the Bible but what
[1:17:38] the seven Thunders uttered was not
[1:17:40] written Thunder one said this thunder
[1:17:42] two said that it's a revelation a White
[1:17:45] Rock that's inside the Bible amen that's
[1:17:48] never had light shined on before
[1:17:51] no man-age anointing could ever tell you
[1:17:53] what those Thunders uttered
[1:17:56] it was going to take a prophet who can
[1:17:59] get it from God himself and bring it and
[1:18:02] no amount of teaching will get you to
[1:18:04] believe that we can get you to
[1:18:05] intellectually agree with it we can get
[1:18:07] you to pass the message test on it but
[1:18:09] there's going to take something
[1:18:10] Supernatural to drop that into your
[1:18:13] heart to actually believe that there was
[1:18:15] a mystery in this whole Bible a white
[1:18:18] stone laying in the midst of this
[1:18:20] throughout from Genesis to Revelation
[1:18:22] that nobody understood no Bible teacher
[1:18:25] no Bible school until one little Prophet
[1:18:27] with a seventh grade education come and
[1:18:30] in the little room the angel comes to
[1:18:32] him day by day and tells him what John
[1:18:34] heard but could not write
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:39] you can say you agree with that but the
[1:18:41] time is coming when the squeeze will
[1:18:42] come down we'll find out whether we
[1:18:44] believe that or not
[1:18:45] because it can only be received by
[1:18:48] Revelation not by education
[1:18:51] we can repeat it back
[1:18:53] but you go and try to sell that to a
[1:18:55] theologian
[1:18:58] he wants to know what what verse was
[1:19:00] that where did it say that just exactly
[1:19:02] like that
[1:19:07] for us we see it everywhere
[1:19:10] it's all through the Bible
[1:19:13] this great mystery of the seventh seal
[1:19:15] it was always there
[1:19:17] it was Adam
[1:19:19] and his wife
[1:19:21] it was Boaz and Ruth
[1:19:24] it was King Isaiah and Esther it's been
[1:19:27] there the whole time
[1:19:29] but we didn't see it
[1:19:32] until the end time
[1:19:34] it took the Eagle's anointing
[1:19:37] to give us the I salve
[1:19:40] in the last age to open our eyes and
[1:19:44] move us from denominational man age
[1:19:47] anointing into an ego Vision where we
[1:19:51] could fly high and see remember you can
[1:19:54] only operate under the anointing that
[1:19:56] God has put in your age and this is not
[1:19:58] the Pentecostal age this is the bride
[1:20:00] Age and what is the bright age anointing
[1:20:02] it is the eagle anointing
[1:20:04] what does the eagle do the eagle flies
[1:20:07] high and can see afar off and see clear
[1:20:09] and the higher it goes the clearer it
[1:20:12] sees
[1:20:14] amen so there was a great prophet Eagle
[1:20:16] in our day amen who who was the
[1:20:19] revelation of the son of man through his
[1:20:21] flesh a son of man revealing the son of
[1:20:23] man amen and he brought the correct
[1:20:25] interpretation of the word amen and now
[1:20:28] all the little eaglets by Revelation are
[1:20:30] flying high and they're seeing the open
[1:20:33] book they're seeing what was veiled in
[1:20:36] the veiled book all along
[1:20:39] how by revelation
[1:20:42] at the opening of The Seven Seals this
[1:20:45] has become a new book
[1:20:47] nothing a theologian could touch nothing
[1:20:51] anybody under the man age could touch
[1:20:54] and still today under a managed
[1:20:56] anointing you can't see it
[1:21:01] and souls that are in prison now he says
[1:21:03] but one day he rose from there came
[1:21:04] forth where was the book at it was still
[1:21:07] in the abstract owner God Almighty and
[1:21:09] John looked around and he wept because
[1:21:10] there was no man even worthy to look on
[1:21:12] the book and especially open the seals
[1:21:15] to reveal what the hidden Mystery was
[1:21:19] the Mysteries was in the Seven Seals
[1:21:21] when these Seven Seals was opened that
[1:21:23] opened up the entire Bible
[1:21:28] you mean to tell me that this Bible was
[1:21:30] closed
[1:21:31] closed a locked and sealed
[1:21:36] with Seven Seals
[1:21:39] no matter how many volumes were printed
[1:21:42] it was closed
[1:21:43] no matter how too many translations
[1:21:45] there were made it was closed no matter
[1:21:47] how many commentaries they made on the
[1:21:50] Bible it was closed
[1:21:52] you could have a volume of commentaries
[1:21:55] on the book of Romans and the
[1:21:57] commentaries are way longer than the
[1:21:59] book of Romans
[1:22:00] you can go to a good man age under a
[1:22:02] manage anointing and he's got a volume
[1:22:04] on the book of Romans and the Book of
[1:22:07] Romans is only this big in your Bible
[1:22:08] and his commentary on the book of Romans
[1:22:10] is this big
[1:22:14] and he was reading from a closed book
[1:22:21] when the book is open what should the
[1:22:23] commentary look like then
[1:22:25] if he can talk that much about a closed
[1:22:28] book what can we see in an open book how
[1:22:31] one scripture can open and go from
[1:22:33] Genesis to Revelation and it can open
[1:22:35] again and open again and open again
[1:22:38] because the book is not closed but the
[1:22:40] seals have been taken off and now the
[1:22:43] book is open and we can read like no
[1:22:45] Theologian has ever read before in his
[1:22:47] lives
[1:22:48] [Music]
[1:22:49] amen so we don't condemn these men they
[1:22:53] did what they were anointed to do they
[1:22:54] were called of God and anointed and they
[1:22:56] were under that anointing and we say
[1:22:58] praise God and bless them but they could
[1:23:00] never see what you and I can see because
[1:23:02] we've been given Eagle Vision
[1:23:04] in this end time
[1:23:09] and the next morning at 10 o'clock
[1:23:10] sitting in there in my room about 10
[1:23:12] o'clock the angel Lord came down he said
[1:23:14] go to Tucson
[1:23:16] you'll be Northeast of Tucson and there
[1:23:17] will come seven angels in a cluster that
[1:23:19] will shake the whole Earth around you
[1:23:20] and said it'll be told you from there
[1:23:23] and how many remembers that is way
[1:23:26] before it happened there is men sitting
[1:23:28] right here in the building tonight with
[1:23:30] standing right there when it happened
[1:23:32] and said the Seven Seals of the Hidden
[1:23:34] Mysteries of the entire Bible will be
[1:23:37] opened and fulfill Revelations 10 that
[1:23:39] in the seventh Angel's message these
[1:23:42] things should come to pass this day this
[1:23:45] scripture is fulfilled before your eyes
[1:23:49] and I say repent
[1:23:54] repent from whatever we believe before
[1:23:57] and come to this repent from whatever
[1:23:59] understanding we had before and come to
[1:24:01] this repent from the nominational
[1:24:03] thinking traditional understanding
[1:24:05] repent and keep repenting I've been
[1:24:07] repenting since I came through this
[1:24:09] message
[1:24:09] [Music]
[1:24:11] and I believe I probably got some more
[1:24:13] repenting to do not because I plan on
[1:24:15] taking up smoking and not because I plan
[1:24:17] on doing evil things but because this
[1:24:19] book is open and the more I look into an
[1:24:21] open book under an eagle anointing the
[1:24:24] more I recognize my understanding was
[1:24:26] wrong I I was under a traditional
[1:24:28] thinking under my upbringing as a boy
[1:24:30] and every time I come in contact with
[1:24:32] this I must repent and have a change of
[1:24:34] mind
[1:24:36] yes
[1:24:38] the bride that repented but she's been
[1:24:40] repenting for 60 years
[1:24:44] amen
[1:24:46] stay with the word as it's been revealed
[1:24:49] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:24:54] before your eyes this day this scripture
[1:24:58] is fulfilled I say repent
[1:25:01] praise be to God it's such a treasure
[1:25:04] friends
[1:25:05] it's such a joy
[1:25:07] we know how to repent
[1:25:10] [Music]
[1:25:12] how many repentance messages are
[1:25:14] preached throughout the United States in
[1:25:15] the world how many altar calls how many
[1:25:17] people are called to give their heart to
[1:25:19] the Lord Jesus and they know Jesus being
[1:25:21] presented
[1:25:23] not the present tense Jesus
[1:25:27] a historical Jesus is being presented
[1:25:29] but not the Jesus of today not the Jesus
[1:25:32] that's present
[1:25:35] how many people are called to repent and
[1:25:38] told that if you quit smoking quit
[1:25:40] drinking do this and come to church
[1:25:41] that's not the repentance that the
[1:25:44] Bible's talking about you have to turn
[1:25:46] from your thinking you have to turn from
[1:25:48] your tradition just like those Jews at
[1:25:51] the day of Pentecost had to turn from
[1:25:53] their understanding of the law of Moses
[1:25:55] and come to the revealing of the law of
[1:25:57] Moses
[1:25:58] the law of Moses made manifest
[1:26:02] and that's the same repentance this
[1:26:04] world needs now to turn from church
[1:26:06] thinking and come into the true
[1:26:08] understanding of Christ
[1:26:11] to turn from from church to nominational
[1:26:14] understanding of repentance
[1:26:17] to come to the one the Mighty God who
[1:26:19] has been unveiled before us
[1:26:21] how through a prophetic
[1:26:24] Ministry
[1:26:27] it wasn't brother Branham standing there
[1:26:29] with his back to the crowd that was
[1:26:30] Jesus Christ in America
[1:26:37] amen
[1:26:39] it isn't Seminary teaching and education
[1:26:42] that keeps opening the word to you and I
[1:26:44] it's the spirit of Christ
[1:26:46] the spirit of truth that would lead you
[1:26:48] into all truth
[1:26:50] that's the anointing that's here
[1:26:53] as he was promised to give us if we
[1:26:56] repent and be baptized in his name he
[1:26:58] would give us the spirit of truth that
[1:27:00] would lead us into all truth
[1:27:02] and I say he's here
[1:27:06] according to the promised word
[1:27:12] praise be to God let's turn to
[1:27:14] Revelation chapter 3.
[1:27:16] finished with the scripture
[1:27:21] and maybe a quote
[1:27:24] Revelation chapter 3
[1:27:27] verse 14.
[1:27:29] the laodicean church age
[1:27:34] and unto the angel of the Church of the
[1:27:36] laodiceans write these things say at the
[1:27:38] amen the faithful and true witness the
[1:27:41] beginning of the creation of God I Know
[1:27:43] Thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[1:27:45] hot I would that were cold or hot so
[1:27:47] then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[1:27:49] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[1:27:51] out of my mouth
[1:27:52] because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:27:55] increased with goods and have need of
[1:27:57] nothing and knowest not thou are
[1:27:59] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:28:03] blind and naked
[1:28:06] he is not speaking to Bootleggers
[1:28:10] alcoholics drug addicts he is speaking
[1:28:14] to the church
[1:28:18] people who are trying to live holy
[1:28:20] people trying to walk a Christian walk
[1:28:22] that's who he's speaking to
[1:28:25] their condition is not sinful by
[1:28:29] unrighteous Deeds their action is sinful
[1:28:32] because they think they're right but
[1:28:34] they're wrong
[1:28:38] they're disbelieving the word for the
[1:28:41] hour
[1:28:42] because they think that they're fine and
[1:28:43] they don't need it
[1:28:45] so they're in sin they're wretched
[1:28:47] miserable blind and naked they have no
[1:28:51] covering they have no eyes to see they
[1:28:53] have no true wealth they are wretched
[1:28:56] miserable poor blind and naked
[1:29:00] he says in verse 18 I counsel thee to
[1:29:02] buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[1:29:04] thou mayest be rich and white raiment
[1:29:06] the thou Mays be clothed and that the
[1:29:07] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:29:09] anoint thy lies with I said that thou
[1:29:11] mayest see as many as I love I rebuke
[1:29:14] and chasten be zealous therefore and
[1:29:17] repent
[1:29:21] repent from what
[1:29:23] repent from your religious blindness
[1:29:28] repent from no covering of the word
[1:29:31] repent from holding your gray piece of
[1:29:34] paper before you like a hula skirt
[1:29:38] repent repent from a laodicean condition
[1:29:41] where we think we're right in church but
[1:29:44] we're wrong because we haven't received
[1:29:46] the true word the true interpretation of
[1:29:48] the Bible repent and to call in the
[1:29:50] laodicean church ages be zealous
[1:29:52] therefore and repent as many as I love I
[1:29:55] rebuke and I chase him and he's saying
[1:29:58] I'm correcting you and I'm teaching you
[1:30:00] amen be zealous therefore and repent
[1:30:04] repent where where do you repent in the
[1:30:06] laodicean church age do you repent of
[1:30:08] smoking no you repent of the wrong
[1:30:10] understanding and come to the revelation
[1:30:13] of this message
[1:30:14] that's the repentance in laodicea
[1:30:18] come to him the person of the word
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:22] and the full revelation
[1:30:24] so he says be zealous therefore and
[1:30:26] repent
[1:30:28] behold I stand at the door and knock
[1:30:30] say I'm not in the church anymore
[1:30:35] I am outside
[1:30:37] be zealous and repent I'm not there
[1:30:41] come to me
[1:30:42] [Music]
[1:30:43] leave your condition buy of meat gold
[1:30:46] white Raymond I save
[1:30:49] repent
[1:30:50] and laodicea repent
[1:30:54] repent of what gaming all night from no
[1:30:58] repent from the wrong understanding of
[1:31:02] who Christ is
[1:31:04] and have a change of mind and come to
[1:31:08] the open book
[1:31:10] to the unveiled Christ
[1:31:13] to the Christ the mystery of God that's
[1:31:16] revealed
[1:31:18] come to him repent and come to him
[1:31:21] amen
[1:31:24] brother Branham says
[1:31:27] in The Invisible Union of the bride of
[1:31:28] Christ
[1:31:29] the apostles then them who set forth the
[1:31:32] Bible here come Luther out in
[1:31:34] Reformation his word that his church his
[1:31:37] word
[1:31:38] his church won't work today Wesley's
[1:31:40] won't Pentecost won't it won't it worked
[1:31:43] in their day
[1:31:44] but it's another day
[1:31:47] this is the opening of The Seven Seals I
[1:31:50] know it sounds strange to you but God
[1:31:52] has Vindicated it so perfectly
[1:31:56] this is a different day friends
[1:31:58] this isn't day this isn't the day for
[1:32:01] the man age anointing
[1:32:02] this is the day for the eagle anointing
[1:32:05] if we want to repent and please God then
[1:32:08] we must come
[1:32:10] to the perfect interpretation of the
[1:32:12] word with Divine vindication
[1:32:15] we must come to the one that's been
[1:32:17] unveiled amen Christ has been unveiled
[1:32:20] the book has been opened we have what
[1:32:23] they never had
[1:32:24] in the church ages
[1:32:26] now we have him
[1:32:28] open to us we can repent like nobody has
[1:32:33] ever been able to repent before
[1:32:37] and in laodicea he says be zealous
[1:32:40] therefore and repent we should be
[1:32:42] zealous to repent because we can repent
[1:32:44] like nobody else
[1:32:47] amen God bless you let's all stand
[1:32:49] musicians if you can make your way up
[1:32:51] please brother Ben as well
[1:32:54] amen
[1:32:58] I believe
[1:33:00] that this Eagle anointing is the only
[1:33:02] way to understand the word
[1:33:05] you know in every age under every
[1:33:07] anointing there was a messenger for that
[1:33:10] age and that messenger was operating
[1:33:11] under a certain anointing and he under
[1:33:13] that anointing would bring a word for
[1:33:15] that age in that day but that the
[1:33:17] messenger wasn't the only one preaching
[1:33:20] in that day amen there was always a
[1:33:22] five-fold Ministry
[1:33:23] is that right and that faithful Ministry
[1:33:26] to be a true faithful Ministry for their
[1:33:28] day must be operating under the same
[1:33:30] anointing as that messenger
[1:33:33] and under the messenger amen and then
[1:33:36] this day we have to be under our
[1:33:37] messenger and under our messenger we
[1:33:39] become the final voice to the final age
[1:33:41] amen and our messenger was William
[1:33:43] Branham he was amen the prophet of the
[1:33:46] age of the seventh angel amen but today
[1:33:49] there's a five-fold ministry that's
[1:33:51] preaching and that five-fold Ministry
[1:33:53] cannot be operating under a man-age
[1:33:55] anointing we can't be bringing
[1:33:58] mayonnaise Doctrine and reading our
[1:33:59] Bible with man-age study helps
[1:34:05] the fivefold ministry today must be
[1:34:07] operating under the same anointing as
[1:34:09] the messenger of the age because that's
[1:34:11] the anointing for the age so the fiful
[1:34:13] ministry must operate by an eagle
[1:34:17] anointing and preach from an open book
[1:34:19] and not from the closed book of the
[1:34:22] reformers
[1:34:23] no matter how nice their material is
[1:34:25] written and know Muhammad how nice they
[1:34:27] put it together amen the book wasn't
[1:34:29] open there it's open here
[1:34:34] so we must be preaching we must be
[1:34:37] operating under the right anointing
[1:34:42] I don't want to preach from a closed
[1:34:44] book
[1:34:46] I want to preach from an openness
[1:34:49] say God help us to stay open help keep
[1:34:52] our channels as ministers that keep our
[1:34:54] channels as Believers as a church keep
[1:34:56] our channels open to the right spirit
[1:34:59] and close to all other voices
[1:35:03] and operate under the eagle anointing
[1:35:06] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[1:35:09] dear Lord Jesus we recognize Lord that
[1:35:11] we need you
[1:35:13] in this hour that we live Lord
[1:35:16] God you have sent us such a great gift
[1:35:19] such a great voice such a great word
[1:35:22] God everything we have need of to
[1:35:24] overcome you have given to us
[1:35:27] Lord your Prophet said that what we have
[1:35:30] before when he comes to the preaching of
[1:35:31] the seals he said what we've got now is
[1:35:33] not enough
[1:35:34] it wouldn't get the Rapture done there's
[1:35:37] something in those seven Thunders
[1:35:39] that'll bring the faith for rapturing
[1:35:40] Grace
[1:35:42] God we recognize that there's no other
[1:35:45] place that this bride is going to get in
[1:35:48] position outside of this Eagle anointing
[1:35:50] and outside of this interpretation of
[1:35:52] the word
[1:35:54] help us God to stay in the presence of
[1:35:56] the son
[1:35:57] bake all the greenness out of us and and
[1:36:00] Lord let us operate under this anointing
[1:36:02] Lord open our eyes to see and help us to
[1:36:05] be zealous to repent as you continually
[1:36:07] reveal yourself to us
[1:36:10] God we love you we thank you for what
[1:36:12] you're doing in this day we thank you
[1:36:14] for allowing us to be here and giving us
[1:36:16] isaf so that we can see
[1:36:19] Lord our hearts burn within us as you
[1:36:22] speak to us day by day
[1:36:24] as you open to us the scriptures and
[1:36:26] open our understanding to understand the
[1:36:28] scriptures God we love this Eagle
[1:36:31] anointing that you've sent in this hour
[1:36:34] on May operate through us may we be free
[1:36:37] channels for that operation
[1:36:40] we love you Lord forgive us for our
[1:36:43] unbelief forgive us for our
[1:36:44] misunderstandings forgive us for holding
[1:36:46] on to tradition
[1:36:48] help us to turn loose of it all Lord
[1:36:51] and receive this message in his fullness
[1:36:54] we love you God we ask for your blessing
[1:36:57] now as we go
[1:36:58] use us Lord in this end time
[1:37:01] day by day may we shine the right light
[1:37:03] live the right life that all that's
[1:37:06] preached and all that's taught and all
[1:37:08] we see would manifest into a life
