[4:25] amen that's our heart's desire isn't it
[4:28] the little life that we have to just
[4:29] give it back to him so he can receive
[4:31] the glory of which he is do with it god
[4:33] bless you all now you may be seated for
[4:35] just a moment
[4:36] i have to talk a little bit so i don't
[4:38] get so nervous
[4:40] i uh
[4:41] happy to be back here and do demon an
[4:43] honor and a privilege hey buddy how are
[4:45] you man god bless you good to see you
[4:47] and uh always deem it an honor and a
[4:49] privilege that
[4:50] god gives me these little opportunities
[4:52] to say a few things
[4:53] to help you and to maybe strengthen you
[4:55] it's a i was telling brother john no
[4:57] matter how many times i think the older
[4:59] i'm getting the more nervous i get every
[5:00] time i come out here and i thought it
[5:02] was supposed to be the opposite way
[5:03] around
[5:04] i thought the more times you do
[5:05] something you're supposed to get more
[5:06] comfortable with it but it just doesn't
[5:08] seem to be the case with me so i
[5:10] but i think he created it in such a way
[5:12] that he always wanted a wife that was
[5:14] totally dependent upon him that she
[5:16] never grew confident in her own
[5:17] abilities but she always felt so
[5:19] inadequate to ever do anything good for
[5:21] him so then she constantly is reaching
[5:23] out for his hand saying lord grab it
[5:25] quickly because i don't know how to pat
[5:27] i don't know how to go down this path
[5:29] again right brother emmanuel just the
[5:31] way it goes as we get older we just we
[5:33] just realize we need him every day of
[5:35] every hour
[5:37] so um
[5:38] i uh wow again i sound pretty good again
[5:42] uh kind of deep um so i uh i
[5:45] i came back with a little color in me so
[5:48] i was told i wow you look alive so i
[5:50] wonder what i looked like before
[5:53] pretty rough apparently
[5:55] so we did go down to florida there for a
[5:57] couple weeks took my grandpa there at
[5:58] the passing of my grandma
[6:00] we needed to get him into a new
[6:02] environment for a little bit see some
[6:04] sunshine and go for some bike riding so
[6:06] we took him down there for a couple
[6:08] weeks and
[6:09] enjoyed the sun and you know enjoyed uh
[6:12] i thought i was feeling sorry for myself
[6:13] one day i had went out drink my coffee
[6:15] hoping to you know get some sunshine and
[6:17] walk down it's like 54 degrees and wind
[6:19] blowing i had to go back inside get my
[6:21] coat go back out looked at the weather
[6:23] it's only going to be a high of 65
[6:25] feeling sorry for myself until i looked
[6:28] back home
[6:29] and it was negative 10 degrees
[6:31] and i realized i'm not going to garner
[6:33] any sympathy from anybody back home if i
[6:35] tell them i'm suffering down here in
[6:36] florida
[6:38] so but uh but we we felt bad for you
[6:41] i'll be honest i
[6:42] sound bad but we were happy to go a
[6:45] little bit and but more importantly we
[6:47] are happy to come home the kids were
[6:48] missing everybody we were missing
[6:50] everybody still no place like home and
[6:52] it ain't because of the geography i'll
[6:54] tell you that for sure
[6:56] it's you all people
[6:58] so i just appreciate that i did hear
[6:59] from brother chad they're having a good
[7:00] time and uh so i just i hope you it's
[7:04] okay with you i'm just gonna really be
[7:05] myself tonight i have a little thought
[7:07] just a real simple thing that i've been
[7:08] chewing on god won't let me go anywhere
[7:10] else i even prayed asking lord maybe
[7:13] maybe there's a little more you could
[7:14] give me i could go a little bit more
[7:16] but what else can i do i always want to
[7:18] be faithful to just say what he leads me
[7:20] to say i i'd feel uh i'd feel like i
[7:22] would be doing you a disservice if i
[7:24] just didn't say what i felt anointed to
[7:25] say it may be short but i believe it's
[7:28] what you want me to say and i'd rather
[7:30] be found doing that than putting
[7:32] together a masterpiece of 10 000 words
[7:34] that i just wasn't sure about
[7:36] and uh so if that's okay we'll just go
[7:39] right to this to the word tonight you
[7:41] may stand with me for a second and grab
[7:43] your bibles please turn to romans 8
[7:46] 28.
[7:48] romans 8 28
[7:51] thank you musicians appreciate it
[7:58] very familiar scripture verse but i
[8:00] think it's good sometimes to go over
[8:02] these old familiar scripture verses
[8:05] they have something in them that can
[8:07] always give us encouragement and
[8:08] strength
[8:10] and we know that all things work
[8:11] together for good to them that love god
[8:15] to them who are the called according to
[8:18] his purpose
[8:20] for whom he did for know he also did
[8:23] predestinate to be conformed to the
[8:26] image of his son
[8:27] that he might be the firstborn among
[8:29] many brethren
[8:31] moreover
[8:32] whom he did predestinate them he also
[8:35] called and whom he called them he also
[8:38] justified and whom he justified them he
[8:41] also glorified
[8:44] what shall we say of these things if god
[8:46] before us who can be against us
[8:49] amen will you bow your heads
[8:52] most gracious heavenly father we come
[8:54] before you again this evening with
[8:56] grateful hearts father and lord you

[9:14] still provided away and you foreordained
[9:16] and you paved away that we would still
[9:18] be conformed into the image of your son
[9:20] you made it all work together for good

[10:13] you may be seated
[10:17] so
[10:18] well
[10:19] i uh
[10:20] i caught inspiration in florida again as
[10:22] you know i can't go anywhere without
[10:24] seeing inspiration in something and uh
[10:26] so i i
[10:28] asked the god if maybe that would be the
[10:30] the thing and and i can't seem to get
[10:32] away from it so i just would like to
[10:34] bring this little inspiration that i had
[10:36] when i saw something down in florida and
[10:38] i'm kind of one that i'm always watching
[10:39] things and i'm always looking for things
[10:41] not to try to make not try to be over
[10:43] spiritual i'm not trying to be that way
[10:45] but sometimes i notice something
[10:46] something will grab me or grip me and
[10:48] then it kind of gears my mind in a
[10:50] certain direction and i can't help it
[10:52] i'm going that way whether i like it or
[10:54] not
[10:55] so i uh i had
[10:57] went for a walk with my daughter and we
[10:59] were looking for some seashells and i
[11:00] shared this with some of the youth and i
[11:01] apologize but there is a little bit
[11:03] bonus here than what i had shared at the
[11:05] youth i had uh went with a walk with my
[11:07] eliana she liked to go looking for
[11:09] seashells on the seashore obviously say
[11:11] that 10 times and
[11:14] while we were walking through there i uh
[11:17] it was a sanibel island they're kind of
[11:19] known for seashells and i we were
[11:21] walking through there and i i picked up
[11:23] a seashell and i found a good one i was
[11:25] in the water and you know there's most
[11:27] of all of them are smashed to pieces
[11:29] but i had saw one kind of caught my eye
[11:30] in the water there and i kind of went
[11:32] out in the water and i grabbed that
[11:33] seashell still perfectly intact
[11:35] beautiful colorful thing and i picked it
[11:38] up and and just as i picked it up i was
[11:40] holding it in my hand i looked down at
[11:41] all the other smashed seashells beside
[11:43] me
[11:44] and just the thought passed me by if i
[11:46] wouldn't have picked you up you'd be
[11:47] like the rest of them
[11:49] and just as soon as i thought that
[11:50] thought and i and the secondary thought
[11:53] came and so would you
[11:56] and it yeah you know and so when those
[11:59] things happen and it's that quick and
[12:00] i'm not thinking about it it does
[12:02] something to you
[12:03] and the reality of it is that we that
[12:06] seashell would have been exactly like
[12:08] these other seashells smashed to pieces
[12:11] if it had not been for my hand to come
[12:13] and pick it up and redeem it from the
[12:14] destruction that was impending upon it
[12:17] and the reality of it is there's not a
[12:18] one of us that can glory in and of
[12:20] ourselves if any anything good in our
[12:22] sides it was the mighty hand of god that
[12:24] redeemed you in the hour of destruction
[12:26] and pulled you at just the right time
[12:28] and that is one thing i don't ever want
[12:30] to forget no matter how i go throughout
[12:31] this life it was still the redeeming
[12:33] grace of god that came down and picked
[12:35] me up and
[12:36] rescued me in my time of destruction and
[12:39] there's not a one of us especially the
[12:41] older that would be amongst us that have
[12:42] walked with the lord and had seen the
[12:43] hand of god redeem you so many times
[12:45] before what would you have done if that
[12:48] hand would not have picked you up you
[12:50] would be like every other seashell upon
[12:52] that seashore smashed to pieces left to
[12:55] your own devices in your own lust
[12:57] totally and utterly destroyed
[13:00] completely destroyed but i'm so glad he
[13:02] intervened on my behalf i was so glad
[13:05] that he purposed within himself i'm
[13:08] redeeming you for a purpose
[13:11] i have a purpose in what i'm doing and
[13:13] i've got you right in the palm of my
[13:15] hand to fulfill a purpose i had for your
[13:17] life
[13:18] and i pondered on that for a few days i
[13:21] didn't say anything i just those
[13:23] thoughts come and you just you just
[13:24] think about it
[13:26] and i was sitting there thinking i
[13:27] looked up out
[13:28] after that and i began to realize you
[13:30] know the the difference here is every
[13:32] one of these seashells they have been
[13:34] caught by a storm a wave you know and
[13:38] they weren't anchored to anything there
[13:39] was nothing in them that could withstand
[13:41] um not it wasn't like they were the
[13:43] boats of the sea that had a power within
[13:44] them that could overcome there was
[13:46] nothing there there was just the they
[13:48] were open to the elements of the sea and
[13:50] so they were headed for doom and each
[13:52] and every one of us were
[13:54] and so many times i stop and i think
[13:56] about you know we're not here to gather
[13:58] around a message just to say hey we're a
[14:00] bride wonderful no we're a bride that's
[14:03] that means we have a purpose
[14:04] the brightest has a purpose she's not to
[14:06] just be able to say everybody hey sorry
[14:08] about your luck you're not the bride i
[14:10] am that's not the purpose of the bride
[14:12] that's not the attitude of the bride
[14:14] that's not the nature of the bride the
[14:16] bride is the bride because he she was
[14:18] called to reproduce the life of christ
[14:20] upon this earth he was looking for a
[14:23] certain kind of woman
[14:24] and i'm just so happy to be in that
[14:26] position because i recognize the great
[14:28] purpose that he had for my life now i
[14:31] can purposely live my life according to
[14:33] that purpose
[14:34] and i have that title for tonight you
[14:36] write it down if you want to his purpose
[14:38] now defines mine
[14:41] and so many times we forget the divine
[14:43] purpose by which we're on this life and
[14:45] all you have to do is remember what
[14:47] divine purpose he redeemed you for
[14:49] and then you can refocus your life back
[14:51] in order to that you can be the great
[14:54] purpose of which he redeemed you for
[14:56] and i had asked my daughter the other
[14:58] night i said uh honey what is your
[15:00] purpose
[15:01] i like to challenge my daughter you know
[15:03] it's like oh that's a tough one but i
[15:05] said honey what's your purpose in life
[15:07] and she said to be the reflection of
[15:09] christ i said good i said what did you
[15:11] do today to see to it that that that is
[15:13] accomplished
[15:17] so it's so easy for us sometimes to just
[15:19] say hey god has a great purpose he's got
[15:20] an objective for our lives now we can
[15:22] sit back relax and do nothing about it
[15:26] that's not true
[15:27] that's not right
[15:29] god has a great purpose and he just so
[15:30] happened he put something in you to
[15:32] actually reflect that divine purpose in
[15:34] a constant pursuit for him the person of
[15:37] the word to see him reflected in your
[15:39] life i told my other little daughter i
[15:41] said go up to the mirror i said what is
[15:43] that mirror telling you and she says
[15:44] it's it's showing me me i said exactly
[15:47] right amir is there to reflect amir and
[15:50] my life is here to reflect his life and
[15:52] you know what if i see some blemish and
[15:53] some blot that isn't perfectly
[15:55] reflecting the life that is supposed to
[15:57] be there i got a job to do don't i
[15:59] i've got something to clean up i've got
[16:01] something to take before the lord i have
[16:03] something to persevere in prayer about i
[16:04] have something to stay in the word and
[16:06] be washed by so that i can adequately
[16:08] reflect him in the purpose of his desire
[16:10] which was to be reflected upon this
[16:12] earth to bring him back into view again
[16:15] the seventh seal brought him back to
[16:16] earth and the mystery of the bride is
[16:19] the mystery of christ he's being
[16:20] unveiled revealed in her
[16:24] amen don't be quiet on me then i'll get
[16:26] really nervous
[16:27] [Laughter]
[16:29] so so you know in this re in this
[16:31] reality i realize i have a divine
[16:33] purpose and that divine purpose has to
[16:34] drive me to do something
[16:36] you know any man brother balaam said any
[16:38] man that was worth anything in the bible
[16:40] had to persevere with a purpose that he
[16:42] was going to achieve something for god
[16:44] any man through history had to persevere
[16:47] and say purpose within himself and say
[16:49] i'm going to do this thomas edison with
[16:51] the light bulb he said i know
[16:53] electricity is there and i am going to
[16:55] capture it and bring it into a light
[16:58] george washington brother banham says he
[16:59] was going to cross the delaware he was
[17:01] going to fight and he persevered and
[17:03] went through and even went through i
[17:04] think he was shot three times but it
[17:06] didn't stop him in his pursuit but so
[17:08] many times we see that
[17:10] the cares of life and the issues of life
[17:12] and the situations of life and oh this
[17:15] one does this and this one does that and
[17:17] this one you know rejected this truth
[17:20] and this one rejected this truth and
[17:21] they call me a fanatic here and what
[17:23] does it do it begins to hinder you what
[17:25] does hinder you
[17:26] why does it hinder you what is that to
[17:28] thee follow thou me
[17:30] if you have a personal revelation of
[17:31] jesus christ and this word is jesus
[17:33] christ then you are adequately
[17:35] sufficiently um
[17:37] inspired by what you have seen to keep
[17:40] pressing towards that mark
[17:42] right that's what we do there's a
[17:44] perseverance in the bride of jesus
[17:46] christ she doesn't let every wind and
[17:48] wave and everything that comes her way
[17:50] to batter her and bash her and and
[17:52] destroy her no i've already been
[17:54] redeemed i've been picked up
[17:57] he's already got and showed me his
[18:00] purpose for my life
[18:01] and so therefore because i know that
[18:03] purpose i keep walking
[18:05] i'd like to read you some scriptures and
[18:06] i hope this is okay i just want to
[18:08] identify for you the purpose of your
[18:11] life
[18:12] because it's defined in his purpose
[18:14] philippians 3 13 if you would like to
[18:17] turn to it you may or write it down
[18:20] it says brethren i count not myself to
[18:22] have apprehended but this one thing i do
[18:24] for getting those things which are
[18:26] behind
[18:27] i am reaching forth unto those things
[18:30] which are before
[18:31] i press toward the mark of the prize of
[18:34] the high calling of god in christ jesus
[18:39] it looks to me like we never stop in our
[18:41] pursuit
[18:42] it looks to me like there has to be a
[18:43] bit of a ruggedness inside of the
[18:45] believer that he doesn't let anything
[18:47] just push him off to the side and
[18:48] discourage him and make him get down and
[18:50] say well forget about it well you know
[18:53] i'm just going to go and relax and if
[18:54] god wants to do something great through
[18:56] me he'll just do it
[18:57] it just doesn't sound right does it it
[19:00] doesn't sound to me like a perseverant
[19:02] christian it sounds like david you well
[19:05] god yeah i know you anointed me to be
[19:06] king and i guess if you're going to get
[19:07] me there you'll have to do a lot of
[19:08] things through me no david was
[19:10] perseverant in what he did
[19:12] david knew that he had a purpose for his
[19:14] life because god revealed his purpose
[19:16] for him therefore when he came in
[19:17] contact with an obstacle
[19:19] he just cut it down
[19:21] he just took god's word and he cut it
[19:23] down
[19:24] tell me any of the bible characters or
[19:26] any of the great
[19:28] heroes of faith throughout the bible
[19:30] that didn't have to persevere and stand
[19:32] on god's word and just believe god and
[19:34] press towards the mark of the high
[19:36] calling in christ jesus tell me one of
[19:38] them tell me one of them that could sit
[19:40] by and just let life happen
[19:42] they didn't have to do anything they
[19:44] could just float on by and brother
[19:46] branham tells a story of this and i
[19:48] picked it up and
[19:49] he tells about a bum that comes to his
[19:51] house one day
[19:52] you might know the story he says the old
[19:54] bum came to his house asking for a
[19:55] sandwich he made him a dinner sat down
[19:57] for a moment he said i knew he was a
[19:59] traveler i said where'd you come from he
[20:01] said nowhere
[20:02] he said where are you going he said
[20:04] nowhere
[20:05] he said it struck him here's a man with
[20:08] no ambition in his life
[20:10] he doesn't know where he came from and
[20:11] he doesn't know where he's going
[20:13] bride do you know where you came from
[20:16] if you know where you came from you know
[20:17] where you're going
[20:19] so therefore you can live your life with
[20:20] a purpose and not be distracted or
[20:22] dismayed when everything doesn't quite
[20:23] go the way you think it is because let
[20:25] me remind you all things work together
[20:26] for the good to them that love god who
[20:28] are the called according to your purpose
[20:31] no i'm so glad it was his purpose
[20:34] i had nothing in me that i could redeem
[20:36] myself to put myself in a position that
[20:38] i could reflect the life of jesus christ
[20:41] he had to purpose within himself to do
[20:42] that i can't do that
[20:45] and brother branham tells about this man
[20:47] he says now that is the attitude of
[20:49] people
[20:50] this bum he said that's the attitude of
[20:52] this of people
[20:53] just what i call i would call them
[20:55] drifters i'd call them floaters people
[20:57] that want to join a church that's just
[21:00] about the same i've often thought about
[21:02] floating a driftwood a driftwood it just
[21:04] hangs around in any kind of trash that's
[21:07] just the way a lot of floaters are in
[21:09] the church and everywhere now you take
[21:11] the stream like a stream of life and
[21:13] plenty of driftwood hanging up in every
[21:15] trash pile and yet the boat comes along
[21:17] made out of the exact same wood but if
[21:20] you notice the wood is made and it's
[21:21] shaped by the master who has built the
[21:24] boat not only it is shaped out of but it
[21:26] is guided by the master and it is pushed
[21:29] by a power and we're all made out of the
[21:31] same stuff but it depends on what your
[21:34] ambitions
[21:35] are
[21:36] the exact same piece of wood but
[21:38] submitted into the hands of the master
[21:40] can cut through every wave every
[21:43] circumstance
[21:44] every difficulty every doubt every
[21:47] skepticism it does not matter because
[21:50] it's been submitted in the hands of the
[21:51] master and crafted to crest every wave
[21:55] such the same thing but you see there
[21:57] was a purpose in it he said you have to
[21:59] have some purpose you have to have the
[22:01] ambition to be taken by god and cut to
[22:04] pieces in shape to be used of him to
[22:06] fulfill his will
[22:08] you've got to have it in you there's
[22:10] just got to be something there that's
[22:12] what because i i've had i've hired
[22:13] people and times gone past they come to
[22:15] work for me
[22:16] and they don't last very long if they
[22:18] don't have ambition i don't care how
[22:19] smart they are i've had some very smart
[22:22] gentlemen that worked for me for for in
[22:24] times gone past that we've let go
[22:26] because they just did not have any drive
[22:28] i said any day give me a man that
[22:31] doesn't know it all but he's got an
[22:32] earnest desire to perform and work hard
[22:35] and please the boss i can work with that
[22:37] man i wonder if god doesn't think the
[22:39] same way sometimes he's not so
[22:41] interested in all you know but he sure
[22:43] knows that man has the desire to serve
[22:45] me he's doing everything he can every
[22:47] day he's pursuing me he's constantly i
[22:49] fail but lord i'm getting back up i want
[22:51] to do it again you see there's something
[22:53] there's an ambition in that man i can
[22:55] work with that as a boss and i think god
[22:57] can work with that as a bride not a man
[23:00] that can sit back and say i've got it
[23:01] all figured out i don't have to prove i
[23:02] don't have to uh pursue him with an
[23:05] earnest desire any longer i don't think
[23:08] that's god's desire i think god has
[23:10] always created you in such a way you
[23:12] will always need him and you always want
[23:14] to need him what kind of husband would
[23:17] want a wife that has no desire to ever
[23:19] hold his hand has no desire to ever ask
[23:22] for help has no desire she's an
[23:23] independent woman she doesn't need him
[23:24] around
[23:26] no husband wants that kind of a wife
[23:28] neither does her heavenly father he just
[23:30] doesn't want that kind of a wife and her
[23:32] bride
[23:33] so we have to have an earnest desire and
[23:35] earnest perseverance in us to see to it
[23:37] that we are molded and shaped into that
[23:39] image that he can use
[23:41] brother branham says in persecution he
[23:42] says now all christians must be
[23:44] perseverant they must be persevered and
[23:47] the only way that they're able to do
[23:49] this is you have to have faith in what
[23:51] you're trying to do and if you have no
[23:54] faith you're just jumping at you can't
[23:56] be persevering and when you really know
[23:59] that this is the truth then there is
[24:00] nothing that is going to stop you you
[24:03] are really perseverant then
[24:06] man of all ages that has ever been able
[24:09] to do anything and had faith in what
[24:11] they're trying to do were perseverant
[24:15] so now i'm going to let the german come
[24:16] out in me a little bit i'll be a little
[24:17] bit militant if you hadn't note i have
[24:19] blonde hair and blue eyes i have a
[24:20] portion of military germanness in me
[24:23] the reality of it is you're supposed to
[24:25] be persevering you're supposed to have
[24:28] an ambition you're supposed to want to
[24:30] see yourself molded and shaped and
[24:32] created into his image you're not
[24:34] supposed to be a passive i would say a
[24:36] passive christian in the sense if god
[24:38] wants to use me for something god wants
[24:40] to bless me with something god wants to
[24:41] heal my body what was in it that woman
[24:44] that said if i touched the hem of his
[24:45] garment what was in the woman who said
[24:48] hey it's not me to give the children
[24:50] spread to dogs what was in that woman
[24:52] brother branham says that was a
[24:54] different kind of a woman see he was
[24:55] trying to throw her off but you could
[24:57] not throw off this elect of god she was
[24:59] perseverant she would take god at his
[25:01] word and believe no matter what the
[25:03] obstacle comes his way do you think god
[25:06] could actually allow some winds and
[25:07] waves and skepticism and falling away to
[25:10] happen all around us just to see i
[25:12] wonder if they'll keep coming i wonder
[25:14] if they'll keep coming i wonder if i can
[25:16] throw them off with this i wonder if i
[25:18] can throw them off with that but nothing
[25:19] seems to throw off this bride she just
[25:21] keeps coming she just keeps believing
[25:24] she just keeps trusting day in and day
[25:26] out that the word that she's feeding on
[25:27] is going to cut her and mold her and
[25:29] shape her to be the vessel by which he
[25:31] can come and express himself through
[25:33] he's going to shape us so that he can
[25:35] live in us he's going to cut me and he's
[25:37] going to cut you with life circumstances
[25:39] and situations and we're not going to
[25:40] say no lord don't do it we're going to
[25:42] say yes lord if that's what you need
[25:44] then all things do work together for the
[25:45] good to them that love the lord that are
[25:47] called by your purpose
[25:49] there's nothing to be worried about
[25:51] there's nothing to be dismayed it's
[25:52] working all for his good and for his
[25:55] glory
[25:57] so brother brown tells another story
[25:58] about a man who wants to be perseverant
[26:00] not once is
[26:02] says and i can't remember the man's um
[26:04] the pastor he said god told him to go to
[26:06] a city and hold a revival
[26:08] remember this and he's going to hold a
[26:10] revival in a certain city and the evil i
[26:12] guess rough man of the city said you're
[26:14] not having a revival in my city and he
[26:16] went down and he went to the man and he
[26:18] says hey if you're going to have a
[26:19] revival you have to get through me and
[26:20] he said the man was just washing windows
[26:22] washing windows
[26:23] and he says now oh i have to get through
[26:25] you he said yeah you'll have to get
[26:27] through me he said no problem let me
[26:28] finish the windows he got down finished
[26:30] the windows and beat the tar out of the
[26:31] man
[26:32] picked him back up shook his hand he
[26:33] said the man got saved that night he
[26:35] said there was not going to be anything
[26:36] that standed in his way because god had
[26:39] revealed to him what his purpose was and
[26:41] his purpose was to fill god fulfill
[26:43] god's purpose and it just so happened
[26:45] that god had allowed for a certain man
[26:47] to be in that city to really test the
[26:49] fortitude of the purpose and the faith
[26:51] that this man had i wonder if sometimes
[26:54] he does that actually i don't want her i
[26:55] know he doesn't
[26:57] i know he does it i know he lets the
[26:59] scounders of life come into our life to
[27:01] really challenge your revelation you
[27:02] really think you're the bride you really
[27:04] think you're the expression of his will
[27:06] you really think you're the mystery of
[27:07] his revelation in this hour sure you do
[27:10] and you know what
[27:11] you just wash the windows get down beat
[27:13] the tar out of that devil and you keep
[27:14] on going
[27:16] you don't stop you cast down every
[27:18] thought and imagination that exalts
[27:20] itself amongst the above the will and
[27:22] word of god right anything that would
[27:24] try to hinder you you just cost it away
[27:26] doesn't matter what it is believers
[27:28] believe guys
[27:29] believers believe we don't just believe
[27:32] we're reading fairy tales and fables of
[27:34] the bible we believe that this gods this
[27:36] is god's revealed word to us to quicken
[27:39] us to make us alive to raise us up what
[27:41] a resurrection that was and what a
[27:43] resurrection that this is i'm being
[27:45] quickened and made alive by the power of
[27:47] almighty god who came down reached me
[27:50] out of the the soon-to-be destruction
[27:52] revealed the arm of the lord to me
[27:54] revealed his will and his purpose for my
[27:56] life and so now i know how to live and i
[27:58] know that anything that gets in the way
[28:00] of that divine purpose i got to deal
[28:02] with it
[28:03] i have to deal with it we as individuals
[28:05] have to deal with things
[28:07] because you have to constantly look is
[28:09] what i'm doing today this week this
[28:11] month furthering the purpose of god's
[28:13] will for my life
[28:15] maybe we shouldn't take it that far am i
[28:16] doing this hour
[28:18] what i am doing this hour is it for
[28:20] furthering the purpose of god for my
[28:21] life
[28:22] so see german military come on now guys
[28:27] sometimes it's good to uh encourage and
[28:29] sometimes it's it's a buckle up soldier
[28:32] it's time to get going got a purpose to
[28:33] do we got a job to do let's go right
[28:37] that's okay
[28:39] i told you a little different tonight i
[28:41] can't do anything that i i can't be
[28:42] nothing that i hate congressman i shall
[28:45] and the absolute he says listen i want
[28:47] to tell you something he had a purpose
[28:50] in saving me and he had a purpose in
[28:52] saving you and i am determined that by
[28:55] his will i will do it i will not add
[28:57] anything nor take anything away from it
[29:00] this revelation
[29:01] 22 19. if you want to put that down
[29:05] whosoever take away i am determined i am
[29:07] fixing to leave the church and you know
[29:09] that i am determined just to remain with
[29:12] this gospel as long as i live by the
[29:14] help of god remember here is grace
[29:17] there were millions dying in sin when he
[29:19] saved me
[29:21] who was i that he should save me
[29:24] he had a purpose in saving me and i am
[29:27] determined to carry out that purpose i
[29:29] don't care what my end may be
[29:32] maybe
[29:33] pretty soon but whatever i'm still
[29:36] anchored and it's never changed
[29:38] amen so just as brother branham had to
[29:41] come to the realization that there was
[29:43] many many many there that were maybe
[29:45] better and more qualified to be saved
[29:47] so were there many many many better than
[29:49] you but god pre-predetermined and chose
[29:52] you from before the foundation of the
[29:54] world
[29:54] what an honor everybody what a privilege
[29:57] i don't think we should take so lightly
[29:59] i know i have too many times i've taken
[30:01] it lightly the cares of this life and
[30:03] the the busyness of this life and the
[30:05] situations of this life can sometimes
[30:07] cloud your vision make you forget the
[30:09] great honor that you have in his
[30:11] choosing i mean how honored was esther
[30:13] to be the one to be chosen to sit by his
[30:16] side how honored she must have felt how
[30:18] honored you must feel
[30:20] you're not just i hope you're just not
[30:21] here to just hey i got to do my
[30:23] religious duty and i got to keep church
[30:25] and i don't want anybody to think odd
[30:26] about me if i don't show up at church my
[30:28] goodness friend that's that's not why we
[30:30] live we come to church to feed on his
[30:32] word we come to church to be judged we
[30:34] come to church to be quickened by the
[30:36] same quickening power that rose up
[30:38] christ from the dead we came to have
[30:39] that same anointing to anoint us to
[30:41] empower us to lead us to guide us i
[30:44] still believe in the holy ghost
[30:45] leadership in the body i still believe
[30:47] that a man
[30:48] moves speaks acts as he's led of the
[30:51] spirit of god any i don't believe that
[30:54] we are to become an intellectual group
[30:55] of individuals that could understand the
[30:57] bible and all of its intricacies i
[30:59] believe we are anointed of the holy
[31:00] spirit of god and by that word we don't
[31:03] deviate from that word because he leads
[31:05] us and guides us by that truth
[31:07] i believe it's the same holy ghost and
[31:08] he gave us the word to anchor us to
[31:10] guide us and steer the ship accordingly
[31:13] but i still believe in holy ghost
[31:14] leadership
[31:15] i don't believe we ever get away from
[31:18] holy ghost leadership in our lives and
[31:20] i'm determined more than ever before to
[31:22] see to it that that dove has the
[31:23] preeminence that he desires
[31:27] do you
[31:29] brother branham says in the per
[31:31] pergameon now the purpose of the bride
[31:34] you all know the purpose of the bride
[31:35] but i just want to bring it back before
[31:36] you in case you forgot
[31:39] the first son adam was the spoken word
[31:41] of god he was given a bride to reproduce
[31:44] himself that is why the bride was given
[31:46] him to reproduce himself to produce
[31:49] another son of god but she fell she fell
[31:51] by hybridization
[31:52] she caused him to die the second son
[31:55] jesus also a spoken word of god was
[31:57] given a bride like as was adam but
[32:00] before he could marry her she had fallen
[32:02] she like adam's wife was put to the test
[32:04] whether she would believe the word of
[32:06] god and live or doubt the word of god
[32:08] and die she doubted she left the word
[32:10] she died but from a little group of the
[32:13] true seed of the word god will present
[32:15] christ with a beloved bride she is a
[32:17] virgin of his word she is a virgin
[32:19] because she knows no man made creeds or
[32:22] dogmas
[32:23] by and through the members of the bride
[32:25] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[32:27] of god
[32:28] to be made manifested in the virgin the
[32:32] members of the bride will love him and
[32:34] they will have his potentials
[32:37] for he is their head and all power
[32:40] belongs to him and they are subject to
[32:42] him as members of our bodies are subject
[32:45] to our own heads
[32:47] does that do to you when you say when i
[32:48] say to you the very potentials of god is
[32:51] within you
[32:52] every potential everything that you saw
[32:54] in him he's poured in you in that day
[32:57] you shall know that i am in the father
[32:58] the father is in me i am in you and you
[33:00] are in me if ye shall say unto this
[33:02] mountain
[33:04] so many times we hear those things and
[33:05] we forget you know when when jesus came
[33:07] out onto the water he had the twofold
[33:09] purpose when he came one was to ex
[33:11] display and express to himself or to
[33:13] them his disciples that here is the son
[33:15] of god who overcame the waves of the sea
[33:18] but it wasn't just to express that he
[33:20] was god what he was hoping for them to
[33:22] see was what was in them
[33:25] it wasn't just so that they could see
[33:26] the god that was before them but they
[33:28] were he was wanting them to awaken to
[33:30] the god that was within them he said oh
[33:32] you have little faith
[33:34] why why did you doubt why did you
[33:36] disbelieve why did you let the winds and
[33:39] the waves and the cares of life overcome
[33:40] you did you not know that greater is he
[33:43] that is in you than he that is in the
[33:44] world did you not know this did you not
[33:47] know that my purpose in coming was not
[33:49] to just display my great strength but to
[33:51] show you that what is in me i have now
[33:53] put in you
[33:55] this is the purpose and will of god this
[33:57] was the becoming god this was god
[33:59] becoming man becoming flesh coming down
[34:02] from a thought to a word to a life
[34:06] and he just so happens to have a bride
[34:08] that believes that
[34:10] it just has a bride that believes that
[34:12] she doesn't have to do anything more
[34:14] than just believe that she stands on
[34:16] that she doesn't know doesn't matter
[34:18] what anything would come against her in
[34:20] doubting it she believes it
[34:22] she just believes it
[34:24] it's interesting no it's not interesting
[34:26] it's wonderful
[34:28] it's wonderful i'm so glad he purposed
[34:31] in himself to bring me to that point
[34:34] now i want to show you a purposeful wash
[34:37] woman
[34:37] now sometimes and i have as well all of
[34:40] us we look at our life we look at the
[34:42] situations of our life we may have
[34:43] regrets we may have difficulties in
[34:45] understanding why did god bring me to
[34:46] this position why did god let me
[34:48] experience this situation why am i in
[34:51] this state
[34:52] why why isn't it a different situation
[34:54] why couldn't you put me here why
[34:55] couldn't you put me there what if i told
[34:57] you god has a divine purpose in making
[34:59] you and and molding you and placing you
[35:01] just where he has you
[35:04] would you say amen to it
[35:06] okay i want to show you of a purposeful
[35:08] wash woman
[35:10] look at the white moody's conversion
[35:12] many of those you see just one little
[35:14] old
[35:14] one old woman a little old wash woman
[35:18] with a message in her heart that she
[35:19] wanted to do something for god she
[35:21] rented an old liver stable a livery
[35:23] stable and got a minister to come down
[35:25] there and preach and nobody but a little
[35:28] boy with hair hanging down his neck and
[35:30] his daddy's suspenders on went down
[35:31] there knelt down at the otter it was
[35:33] dwight moody sent a half a million souls
[35:36] to jesus christ that woman had something
[35:39] to do she was there for a purpose and
[35:42] she had she was made a wash woman for
[35:45] that purpose
[35:48] you know what if she wasn't a wash woman
[35:50] what if she was a mother and she had 15
[35:53] children
[35:54] i wonder if she would have had the time
[35:55] and the burden to do something for god
[35:58] and to get a little stable or something
[36:00] follow the leadership of the lord to do
[36:02] something for god see god had to make
[36:04] her a wash woman
[36:05] brother bam says don't despise where god
[36:07] has you but serve your purpose
[36:10] there's coming a great victory one of
[36:12] these days where the battle is over
[36:15] i think sometimes we spend too much time
[36:17] complaining about the place that god has
[36:19] us
[36:19] we should just thank god for where he
[36:21] has us and actually look for him to use
[36:23] us in the place that he's placed us to
[36:24] fulfill his purpose
[36:27] too much time complaining too many times
[36:29] being frustrated with why things are the
[36:31] way they are rather than a thankfulness
[36:34] and a gratefulness that god has placed
[36:36] you in a position with the revelation
[36:38] that you have that you can glorify him
[36:40] in whatever state you find yourself in
[36:42] that's a real honor that's a real
[36:44] blessed person that can glorify god in
[36:46] whatever state they find themselves
[36:48] their content
[36:50] in the easter seal
[36:52] jesus was so full of the quickening
[36:54] power he said if you destroy this temple
[36:56] that took you 40 years to build i'll
[36:58] raise it up in three days
[37:00] well why could jesus say that i want to
[37:03] ask you why could jesus say a thing like
[37:05] that
[37:06] he knew that he he knew what he was
[37:09] amen i wish i could make that stick he
[37:12] knew who he was he knew it every word
[37:15] that god had written in there of him he
[37:18] was here to fulfill it he knew he was
[37:20] the one that david spoke of
[37:23] do you know you're the ones the bible
[37:25] speaks of

[38:37] eat the crumbs that fall off the table
[38:39] that don't sound like the same that
[38:41] don't ring the same to me there's a
[38:43] perseverance there's a boldness in the
[38:45] bride of jesus christ to see to it that
[38:47] every promise in the book
[38:49] it's mine you don't want it that's fine
[38:51] let your unbelief keep it from you but
[38:53] by god's grace may he raise the faith
[38:55] that's in my heart to take every promise
[38:56] that he promised peace healing joy
[38:59] satisfaction i don't care what it is
[39:01] whatever promise that that bible has
[39:03] declared is for the believer it's mine

[39:10] than able to solve that problem too
[39:12] but i have to believe him i have to call
[39:14] jesus on the scene i have to awaken him
[39:18] and not sit there and complain about it
[39:20] can you imagine do you see why god had
[39:22] to rebuke moses and say why are you
[39:24] crying unto me speak the word and move
[39:26] forward everything you had needed for
[39:28] this earth journey i gave it to you stop
[39:31] crying all the time realize what's in
[39:32] your hand and walk
[39:34] but you have to speak it
[39:36] you have to take the word put it on your
[39:37] lips speak the word and move forward
[39:43] sorry too much german
[39:47] uh
[39:48] where am i at you okay
[39:51] everybody's okay okay sorry now i got
[39:53] figure out where i'm at again
[39:56] psalms
[39:57] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[39:59] the counts of the ungodly okay
[40:02] and standeth in the way of the sinners
[40:04] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[40:06] but his delight is in the law of the
[40:07] lord and in his law doth he meditate day
[40:09] and night and he shall be like a tree
[40:12] that's planted by the rivers of water
[40:13] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[40:15] season his leaf also shall not wither
[40:18] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[40:21] i want to draw your attention to the
[40:22] first verse that stopped me yesterday
[40:24] when i was looking at it says blessed is
[40:26] the man that walketh not in the counts
[40:28] of the ungodly
[40:30] next step he goes from walking to now
[40:32] he's standing with sinners
[40:35] next step he is now sitting in the seat
[40:37] of the scornful
[40:39] you stand you you you walk with ungodly
[40:42] things you walk with things that aren't
[40:44] pleasing to god you walk with things
[40:45] that aren't um acceptable in his sight
[40:49] before long you'll be standing in the
[40:50] presence of sinners and before long
[40:52] after that you'll be sitting in the
[40:54] skeet of the scornful you know what
[40:55] scornful is arrogant and pridefulness
[40:57] you go look it up you begin to become so
[41:00] arrogant and prideful that nobody is
[41:03] right nobody is good nobody's as good as
[41:05] you
[41:06] you become an arrogant scornful
[41:08] individual and it all started because
[41:10] you began to walk with doubt
[41:12] you began to walk with that doubt and
[41:13] then you began to entertain that doubt
[41:15] and then you begin to settle in your
[41:16] scornfulness and your bad attitude and
[41:18] your arrogant nature
[41:20] but blessed is he now you won't do this
[41:23] if you do this
[41:24] but blessed is he whose delight is in
[41:26] the law of the lord where he doth
[41:28] meditate day and night
[41:30] he shall be like that tree that's
[41:31] planted by rivers of water
[41:34] and he shall bring forth his fruit and
[41:36] season and his leaf also shall not
[41:38] wither and whatsoever he do shall
[41:40] prosper let's contrast this with jude
[41:42] jude 1.
[41:43] if you want to turn to it jude 1 verse
[41:46] 11.
[41:50] jude 1 verse 11.
[41:55] now i showed you the one side
[41:57] those that meditate upon the law of god
[41:59] day and night
[42:00] they're like that tree planted by rivers
[42:02] of water they bring forth the fruit in
[42:04] his season they're able to reproduce the
[42:06] life of christ
[42:09] jude 1 11 says woe unto them for they
[42:12] have gone the way of cain and they have
[42:13] ran greedily after the way of balaam for
[42:16] reward and they have perished in the
[42:17] gang saints of korah
[42:19] these are spots in your feast of charity
[42:22] when they feast with you feeding
[42:23] themselves without fear
[42:25] clouds they are without water
[42:28] carried a bout of winds
[42:30] trees whose fruit is withered
[42:33] without fruit twice dead and plucked up
[42:36] from the roots
[42:37] waging waves of the sea foaming out
[42:40] their own shame
[42:41] wandering stars to whom is reserved the
[42:44] blackness and darkness forever brother
[42:46] branham said about these wandering stars
[42:48] he says oh there are those people that
[42:50] say oh i wonder if god will keep his
[42:52] word here i wonder if god can keep his
[42:54] word here you know they came out a mixed
[42:56] multitude they came out of mixed
[42:58] multitude that believed the prophet of
[43:00] god but in the wilderness journey their
[43:02] real attribute of their unbelief began
[43:03] to manifest i wonder if god can deliver
[43:06] us here i wonder if god can bring me
[43:08] through this
[43:09] i wonder about that
[43:11] brother braham said don't wonder believe
[43:13] god's word
[43:14] just be fixed we're not wandering stars
[43:17] we're fixed we're fixed in his hand we
[43:19] believe what he says you'll keep it
[43:21] you'll not doubt it
[43:23] we be not like ephesians says 4 says
[43:26] till we all come to the unity of faith
[43:28] and the knowledge of his son
[43:30] and to the knowledge of the son of god
[43:31] unto the perfect man and to the measure
[43:34] of the stature of the fullness of christ
[43:36] that we henceforth be no more children
[43:38] tossed to and fro carried about with
[43:41] every wind
[43:43] oh just lost it every wind of doctrine
[43:45] by the slight of men in the cunning
[43:47] craftiness by whereby they lay and wait
[43:50] to deceive us or to deceive sorry
[43:53] so as we grow up and we mature we don't
[43:55] let every little situation little every
[43:57] problem every difficulty and everything
[43:59] we see over here and everything that see
[44:00] over there to persua to uh to to knock
[44:02] us off course
[44:04] we have a purpose
[44:05] i'm to be conformed into the image of
[44:07] his dear son
[44:08] at the end of the day what does it
[44:10] matter if this one's doing this and this
[44:12] one's doing this and that one's doing
[44:14] that and this one's saying it this way
[44:16] what does it matter everybody what is
[44:18] that to thee
[44:19] follow thou me
[44:20] what does it mean what does it matter
[44:22] why do you let that hinder you why do
[44:23] you let that discourage you what does it
[44:25] matter
[44:26] do you not have a revelation that god
[44:27] has chosen you to perfect you and to
[44:30] express himself in you
[44:32] if he does you just keep headed towards
[44:34] that vision you just keep walking it day
[44:36] in and day out every day exam in your
[44:38] life seeing is what i'm doing today
[44:41] helping him to fulfill his great desire
[44:43] that's why i said his def his desire his
[44:45] purpose defines mine you got to remember
[44:48] what was his divine purpose for your
[44:50] life
[44:51] your divine purpose was so you would be
[44:53] a vessel that he could reflect himself
[44:54] back to this earth
[44:56] with no smudges no blemishes
[44:59] no your little personality thing here
[45:02] your little pet thing here in the way to
[45:04] mess up the image nope everything go on
[45:07] every year i desires gone your will gone
[45:11] your uh your once gone
[45:13] just what he wanted
[45:15] okay you wanted to make me a wash woman
[45:17] okay wanted to make me and place me in
[45:19] this situation okay no problem that's
[45:22] just where i'll be and that's where i
[45:23] hope i'll express christ in his fullness
[45:25] and in his word right replanted me
[45:28] amen
[45:29] amen
[45:30] so
[45:32] where am i now
[45:34] brother braham says in the power of
[45:36] decision if a man ever once anchors his
[45:38] heart against the heart of calvary every
[45:40] devil and hell will never shake him from
[45:42] it
[45:43] notice for he cannot stand for he that
[45:46] cannot stand chastisement is an
[45:47] illegitimate child he claims god to be
[45:50] his father when he's not he's just
[45:52] always tossed about by every wind of
[45:55] doctrine and he's not stable and don't
[45:58] know where you're going you're double
[46:00] minded lots of times you're double
[46:02] tongued and don't know where you're
[46:04] standing and what you're talking about
[46:08] then
[46:08] a man that's been born of the spirit of
[46:10] god knows exactly where he's at that's
[46:13] right
[46:14] nothing phases him because something
[46:16] inside of him has already witnessed that
[46:19] somebody is on the is
[46:21] somebody outside irknow it
[46:24] witnessed somebody outside the cloud
[46:26] yonder his faith sees it so obviously a
[46:29] man that has got a revelation of god has
[46:32] a firm foundation and a good grip on him
[46:34] remember brother chad talked about the
[46:35] eagle had an eagle grip that could lock
[46:38] down on something it's just something
[46:40] about eagles when they come in contact
[46:42] with the word they lock a hold and they
[46:43] don't let go
[46:45] nothing can shake them off of it when
[46:47] you came to christ nothing can let go
[46:49] there's something on the inside of you a
[46:51] perseverance and a strength to take a
[46:53] hold of god's word and it just keeps
[46:55] going through it doesn't stop
[46:59] and so i was thinking about this and can
[47:01] you imagine if i had
[47:03] if let's say like
[47:06] brother shay's not here so i pick on
[47:07] brother shea but the shay's not here but
[47:09] if he would him if i if i was his boss
[47:12] in superior and i hired him to obviously
[47:14] be a highway patrolman and navigate the
[47:15] streets and he was
[47:18] his duty was to see to it that everybody
[47:20] abided by the law on the roads and every
[47:22] day i drove by and i saw him at dunkin
[47:24] donuts
[47:25] in the morning that'd be all right but
[47:27] if i saw him there every day
[47:29] of every hour i would say
[47:31] he is not serving the purpose by which i
[47:33] hired him for
[47:35] i would say this man has got his own
[47:36] desire and it is certainly not to
[47:38] fulfill the desire of the highway patrol
[47:41] it is to fulfill his own desire and eat
[47:43] donuts
[47:45] once a day is okay
[47:46] 12 times a day not so much
[47:49] but you see
[47:51] now that's just in the natural realm
[47:53] but then if i asked you what did you
[47:55] what were you doing today
[47:57] bride of jesus christ
[47:59] what were you pursuing this week bride
[48:02] what was your will this month bride
[48:05] what did you do
[48:07] were you about the father's business
[48:10] were you just letting god try to
[48:13] were you not making any effort to be
[48:15] molded and shaped into his image
[48:17] do you not persevere do you not make an
[48:20] effort
[48:22] it's a simple question i know it's a
[48:23] simple answer
[48:25] oh bye it's a simple answer but i wonder
[48:28] how diligent we are to keep the simple
[48:29] answer
[48:31] are we staying washed by the washing of
[48:32] the word do we come to church faithfully
[48:36] do we participate in all that we can do
[48:38] we pray without ceasing do we seek god's
[48:41] will for the decisions that we make in
[48:43] our life or do we just go fast
[48:45] quick
[48:48] it's way too quiet
[48:50] way way too quiet
[48:53] i'm asking the question because i don't
[48:54] ask it if you ask it of me as well
[48:57] something i have to look in the mirror i
[48:58] have to look at my decisions and
[49:00] the day the day every day that i'm
[49:03] living and saying
[49:05] is what i am doing living with a purpose
[49:07] that he intended for me to live by
[49:11] that's a question so many times i think
[49:13] we want to hear something new we want a
[49:15] new mystery we want to to have a new
[49:16] revelation you know
[49:18] peter said i come sometimes and i stir
[49:20] you up into remembrance though you
[49:22] already be established in present truth
[49:24] i'm still going to stir you up in
[49:25] remembrance to remember and remind you
[49:28] of the purpose by which god called you
[49:30] elected you
[49:33] molded you
[49:34] sometimes it's not a question of present
[49:36] tense truth we believe the prophet of
[49:38] god we believe this message of the hours
[49:40] calling out a bride we believe in the
[49:41] coming of the lord we know he was here
[49:43] at the he was uh when the seventh angel
[49:45] was on earth he came at that time we
[49:47] know that these aren't questions but
[49:49] sometimes the rubber meets the road and
[49:50] i have to ask a question
[49:52] i have to ask the question of myself
[49:55] and then i ask the question of myself
[49:56] then i post it to you because i preach
[49:58] what i live
[50:01] the purpose of god's will for your life
[50:04] was that you could be in the image of
[50:05] his very own son
[50:08] now that wasn't just a fictitious idea
[50:11] or just some you know just some fairy
[50:13] tale no that's actually the purpose of
[50:15] god
[50:16] to bring into view again almighty god
[50:19] in earthen vessels
[50:21] a little mystery that he had hid
[50:23] but then now he has to look at the
[50:25] situation and say
[50:26] now the people that i have chosen i
[50:28] wonder how bad they want to see that
[50:29] come into pass
[50:31] i wonder what they're willing to give up
[50:33] i wonder if they're willing to give up
[50:34] an idea
[50:35] a desire
[50:36] a job
[50:38] a
[50:39] friendship
[50:40] something
[50:42] but you find out whatever it's worth you
[50:43] is the price you're willing to pay for
[50:45] it i went through that once before
[50:47] if it's worth of something great to you
[50:48] you'll pay a great price for it if it's
[50:50] not you won't
[50:52] if christ's purpose for your life is of
[50:53] a great value to you you will go to
[50:55] great lengths to see it come to pass
[50:58] if it is not you won't
[51:01] it's not a question of i'm not trying to
[51:03] question your your spirituality i'm not
[51:05] trying to take away from you anything
[51:07] that god's done for you i'm not doing
[51:08] that i'm trying to stir you up
[51:10] i'm trying to stir you up in remembrance
[51:13] i'm trying to say hey don't forget
[51:15] almighty god did went to great lengths
[51:17] to redeem you he didn't have to
[51:20] he didn't have to do a thing for you and
[51:22] believe me there was probably 10 million
[51:24] other people way better than you i know
[51:25] there was for me but i remember thinking
[51:27] wow you actually did this for me you
[51:29] actually called me redeem me for this
[51:31] purpose this great purpose that you've
[51:33] had hidden in the back part of your mind
[51:35] you did that for me
[51:36] why i don't know but do i believe it i
[51:39] do
[51:40] i do
[51:41] and because i know and i believe that
[51:43] that great purpose that god purposed and
[51:44] saved me for is is something that was
[51:47] for me
[51:48] then it it it demands a level of respect
[51:51] and time and energy on my behalf to see
[51:54] to it that it comes to pass
[51:56] that i
[51:57] i cast down every thought and
[51:59] imagination
[52:00] i don't let anything take me or draw me
[52:02] away every sin that easily besets me i
[52:05] deal with it if i see something in the
[52:07] mirror that is smudging the image i take
[52:09] it to god and say lord help me i gotta
[52:11] get that off
[52:13] my home isn't reflecting you right my
[52:14] attitude doesn't reflect you right my
[52:17] speech my desires
[52:19] it doesn't look like christ again it
[52:21] looks like a man just a normal man
[52:23] trying to live his life do his own will
[52:26] it's a question just a question
[52:28] maybe it's only for one person and
[52:30] everybody else is a-okay i'm trusting
[52:32] that that is the case
[52:35] brother branham said in the easter seal
[52:38] oh no i'm sorry my computer went the
[52:40] wrong way let's see here
[52:49] the bible says in james 1 3
[52:52] knowing this
[52:54] that the trying of your faith worketh
[52:55] patience
[52:57] but let patience have her perfect work
[52:59] that you may be perfect and entire
[53:01] wanting nothing
[53:03] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[53:05] god that giveth to all men liberally and
[53:08] abradeth not and it shall be given him
[53:11] but let him ask in faith nothing
[53:13] wavering for he that wavereth is like
[53:16] the wave of a seed driven with the wind
[53:19] and tossed
[53:20] let not that man think that he will
[53:22] receive anything of the lord for a
[53:24] double-minded man is unstable in all of
[53:27] his ways
[53:28] so i cannot pursue my will and his will
[53:30] at the same time
[53:32] i'll be unstable in all my ways
[53:34] i have to put one purpose before me and
[53:36] i have to make sure that i block
[53:39] everything else that tries to stop that
[53:41] to see that come to pass i have
[53:44] something i've got to do
[53:46] every father in a home knows this
[53:47] situation you don't just sit back and
[53:49] and trust that everything in your home
[53:51] goes all right every father has to stand
[53:53] up and be a man take control of his home
[53:55] and say this isn't according to god's
[53:56] will
[53:58] this this situation how we handled this
[54:00] with the children that wasn't according
[54:01] to god's will i have to take control of
[54:03] my own home with my own children and if
[54:05] anything goes wrong in my own home guess
[54:06] whose fault it was mine
[54:08] so a father has a responsibility to his
[54:10] wife and to his children to see to it
[54:12] that his home is reflecting christ the
[54:13] way christ would want it to be reflected
[54:15] right
[54:16] a young man would have to live his life
[54:19] he knows how to has to be able to
[54:20] control his life and control his desires
[54:22] in such a way that if god looked into
[54:24] the secrets of his life he could say
[54:25] this is a young man that's reflecting me
[54:27] the way i want to be reflected
[54:29] you can look to a wife and say hey
[54:30] here's an unbelieving husband but this
[54:32] wife is so purposed in her heart to see
[54:34] christ reflected in her that now she
[54:36] handles her husband in the right way
[54:38] though he may not be serving god it
[54:39] doesn't matter you're serving god
[54:42] the wife serves god the wife reflects
[54:43] christ the way god christ wants to
[54:45] reflect regardless of the husband's
[54:46] situation
[54:48] you know she has to purpose in herself
[54:49] to do that
[54:51] you see what i'm saying nobody's off the
[54:52] hook
[54:54] everybody has a place to play everybody
[54:56] has uh everybody's a wash woman
[54:58] somewhere with a purposeful wash woman
[55:00] somewhere
[55:01] god has a custom-made circumstance and
[55:04] situation that he just so placed you in
[55:06] to see the glory of god manifested in
[55:08] you maybe you're the only one that can
[55:10] do it
[55:10] maybe you're the only one that could
[55:12] really reflect christ in the situation
[55:14] you find yourself in to the the way he
[55:16] would want it to be reflected it could
[55:18] be a great blessing for you
[55:20] and not a cursing
[55:23] um
[55:25] amen
[55:27] i have to start saying things to get
[55:28] responses at this point you love the
[55:30] lord
[55:32] and i've seen some ministers do so it's
[55:34] funny
[55:35] uh
[55:37] i loved it brother nestor used to amen
[55:38] himself you know amen
[55:41] i think it encouraged him hear somebody
[55:43] um
[55:45] brother braham says again here in
[55:47] perseverance he says men of all ages
[55:50] that have faith in what they're trying
[55:51] to achieve has has been men of
[55:53] perseverance
[55:54] no man can be perseverant unless first
[55:57] he knows what he's trying to achieve
[55:59] and you must first know what you're
[56:00] trying to achieve and then have faith in
[56:02] what you're going and have faith in what
[56:04] you're going to get
[56:06] what that you're going to get what
[56:08] you're trying for and that makes you
[56:10] perseverant something that you know is
[56:13] real
[56:14] faith is based that way faith is not
[56:16] based upon a myth or upon something like
[56:18] that will that just say well we'll go do
[56:21] this or do that on the words of some man
[56:24] no faith takes its eternal resting place
[56:26] upon the word of god upon god's word
[56:29] that is the bible
[56:30] i so love it brother branham had made
[56:32] the comment you know when he talks about
[56:33] the old violin he said it was mocked out
[56:36] ridiculed scoffed
[56:38] he said but it was like a violin he said
[56:41] but in the hands of the master he could
[56:42] play a tune like nobody else could play
[56:45] he said now and you have to be honest
[56:47] now in this final day god had so sent a
[56:49] man ordained of himself ordained of god
[56:52] that could pick up the old dusty bible
[56:54] and make it come to life again for each
[56:57] and every one of us
[56:58] and i so love that about it because now
[57:00] when i go to the word i can see it in
[57:02] its full richness of of what he meant
[57:04] when he said it it's no longer pushed
[57:07] aside by man's ideas and creeds it's now
[57:09] brought to life it can live it can
[57:11] express itself in you and in me now
[57:14] where it couldn't do that it was too
[57:15] bound up but now it's been made free and
[57:18] set free and the beauty of that music
[57:20] can play and now the beauty of that
[57:22] music can be echoed
[57:24] in me i just love that about it i really
[57:27] do love that
[57:30] so sometimes these obstacles we look at
[57:32] they're not as difficult as we think if
[57:34] we look at the right things
[57:36] you know joshua and caleb when they came
[57:38] out of the wilderness it looked to like
[57:40] everybody else that that was a pretty
[57:41] big situation there were some pretty big
[57:44] obstacles in the way
[57:46] it looked like the majority of these
[57:49] uh
[57:51] giants that were in the land were just
[57:52] too much for israel
[57:54] but that wasn't what joshua and caleb
[57:56] said
[57:57] the bible bible says that there was a
[57:59] different spirit in them
[58:01] and we know that it was the spirit of
[58:03] christ here was the elect so much so
[58:05] that here you have joshua type of the
[58:07] holy ghost and you have caleb echoing
[58:09] the word of god
[58:10] you have caleb saying the exact same
[58:12] thing joshua's saying i believe the
[58:14] bride says the exact same thing that the
[58:16] word is saying i believe she just keeps
[58:18] echoing what he said we're more than
[58:20] able we're more than able greater is he
[58:22] that's in me than he that's in the world
[58:24] i don't care what the obstacle is i
[58:25] don't care what the situation and look
[58:27] at caleb 40 years later i'm i'm stronger
[58:30] now than i was 40 years ago i don't
[58:32] believe for one second he was looking at
[58:34] his flabby arms i think with everything
[58:36] in me he was more confident that the one
[58:38] who made the promise was going to keep
[58:40] the promise
[58:41] i believe with the bride as time goes on
[58:43] she doesn't get weaker she says it's
[58:44] going to be even more sweeter when we
[58:46] fully take that land
[58:48] the one who brought me out is the one
[58:49] who takes me in
[58:51] he had purposed in himself to do it and
[58:53] he will do it
[58:54] he will bring me into that great image
[58:56] that he had for ordained me to come into
[58:58] he took a snapshot of you and he's taken
[59:00] me to that image
[59:05] brother ma'am says in the token
[59:07] and now watch as we see the great end
[59:10] time signs on this earth that he has
[59:12] promised how much more it's warning us
[59:14] that the time is at hand quit your
[59:16] unbelieving and come together
[59:19] we should love each other and believe
[59:21] and separate ourselves from the world
[59:24] it looks like he gave us a lot of things
[59:26] we have to do
[59:27] love each other
[59:29] believe
[59:31] and separate yourself from the world
[59:35] notice they were not to just come
[59:37] together and talk about the message
[59:40] they were to get into it
[59:43] get under the blood
[59:45] not come and say you know moses told us
[59:47] the messenger he said he told us that we
[59:49] should we should have blood but what do
[59:51] you think about it boys that wasn't it
[59:54] get a lamb and kill it
[59:56] and get the blood up there see that had
[59:58] something to do with it
[1:00:01] we can come and sit and agree with the
[1:00:04] word and everything else but don't have
[1:00:07] to
[1:00:08] then don't have that token what good
[1:00:10] will it do you
[1:00:11] no good you've got to get beneath it
[1:00:14] he was not responsible for anyone out
[1:00:17] from under that blood he is not
[1:00:20] responsible for anybody today who's out
[1:00:23] from under that token
[1:00:26] you got something to do it got something
[1:00:29] to do faith is the victory brother
[1:00:30] branham says daniel when he was taken
[1:00:32] down into babylon though he was going
[1:00:34] away from his home he was going to have
[1:00:37] to be a slave in another nation amongst
[1:00:39] another people but daniel had purposed
[1:00:41] within his heart that no matter what
[1:00:43] they ever did to him he wasn't going to
[1:00:45] defile himself with the babylonian sin i
[1:00:48] wonder have bride have you purposed
[1:00:50] within yourself that no matter what
[1:00:52] condition laodicea finds yourself to
[1:00:54] bring you into you're not going to
[1:00:56] defile yourself with the sins of
[1:00:58] laodicea
[1:00:59] i wonder if there is such a
[1:01:00] determination like there wasn't daniel
[1:01:02] that no matter what comes my way i have
[1:01:05] purpose within myself i will not defy
[1:01:08] the tabernacle of the living god
[1:01:11] with the cares and the loves and the
[1:01:13] pleasures of this life
[1:01:17] oh if we had more gallant men like that
[1:01:21] what would that would purpose that in
[1:01:23] their heart that if i am a christian i'm
[1:01:26] going to go find out every divine
[1:01:29] promise that belongs to me and claim it
[1:01:32] amen
[1:01:34] everything that's there it's mine
[1:01:38] i told you it was just a short simple
[1:01:40] thought
[1:01:42] but i want to also tell you this brother
[1:01:44] branham says in beyond the curtain of
[1:01:46] time
[1:01:47] i want to close with this thought
[1:01:48] musicians you can come
[1:01:51] he said i heard a voice that was saying
[1:01:53] you're just now starting you've got to
[1:01:55] keep pressing press the battle keep
[1:01:57] pressing
[1:01:58] as i lay there and was pondering on
[1:02:00] these words i thought
[1:02:01] i just imagined that voice again the
[1:02:04] voice said press the battle keep going
[1:02:07] keep going
[1:02:09] i thought that i had possibly spoken
[1:02:11] those words out of myself i placed my
[1:02:14] hands or my i placed my lips between my
[1:02:17] teeth and i held my hand up over my
[1:02:20] mouth and i listened and the voice said
[1:02:22] again
[1:02:22] just keep pressing if you only knew what
[1:02:27] what it is at the end of the road
[1:02:31] sometimes you just have to hear a voice
[1:02:33] that says keep going
[1:02:36] don't stop don't be dismayed don't be
[1:02:39] discouraged
[1:02:40] keep pressing keep going if you only
[1:02:43] knew what will awaited you just ahead
[1:02:46] it's going to be so wonderful i have not
[1:02:49] seen an ear hath not heard neither has
[1:02:51] it entered into the heart what god has
[1:02:53] in stores for them that love him
[1:02:55] you may stand
[1:02:58] i hope that's okay
[1:03:00] i tonight
[1:03:00] i again i told you i cannot do anything
[1:03:04] more than what i feel inspired to do
[1:03:06] and i don't know who it's for and maybe
[1:03:08] it was just for me
[1:03:10] and so uh but maybe not me and brother
[1:03:12] bob
[1:03:14] me and brother bob so many times we let
[1:03:16] too many things distract us and get us
[1:03:18] dismayed
[1:03:20] i think we have to go back sometimes and
[1:03:21] remember i'll be like peter i want to
[1:03:23] stir you up go back and remember the
[1:03:26] purpose that he went to to save you go
[1:03:28] back and remember what great purpose he
[1:03:31] had saved you for
[1:03:33] he wanted to see you he knew that you
[1:03:35] had within you the potentials to submit
[1:03:37] your will to his
[1:03:39] that's a pretty phenomenal potential
[1:03:42] a submission you could submit your will
[1:03:44] to his will
[1:03:46] not so much i think he was looking for
[1:03:47] great abilities i don't think so i think
[1:03:50] he was looking for a humble group of
[1:03:51] people that would submit their will to
[1:03:52] his
[1:03:53] that would say they're incapable unable
[1:03:56] not educated enough not smart enough
[1:03:59] can't figure it out
[1:04:00] but i'm willing father god for you to
[1:04:02] display your attributes in me however
[1:04:04] you see fit
[1:04:06] wow now i feel qualified
[1:04:09] we all may feel qualified when we can
[1:04:11] look at it from that perspective he was
[1:04:13] never looking for human ability he was
[1:04:15] looking for submission
[1:04:17] he was looking for that kind of a wife
[1:04:19] if you'll just bow your heads
[1:04:22] heavenly father
[1:04:24] lord we sure appreciate you we
[1:04:26] appreciate your word i appreciate it so
[1:04:28] very much
[1:04:30] father i just pray that you would take
[1:04:31] the things that i said i pray lord i
[1:04:33] said it the right way i pray i said it
[1:04:35] just in the way that would be a help to
[1:04:37] your people that was my only desire and
[1:04:39] purpose tonight
[1:04:40] lord to just get out of the way say
[1:04:42] something here this wednesday night to
[1:04:44] encourage
[1:04:45] your most precious people that you love
[1:04:47] and went to such great lengths to redeem
[1:04:50] father i'm so thankful that i was one
[1:04:52] that you picked up i think we all are
[1:04:55] you didn't have to but you did
[1:04:57] and so father god we just ask that you
[1:04:59] would help us each and every day may we
[1:05:01] examine our lives
[1:05:03] may we look at the things that we're
[1:05:04] doing the things we're pursuing
[1:05:06] may we see if it if it's matching your
[1:05:09] purpose and what you wanted for us the
[1:05:10] father
[1:05:12] sometimes we we get too busy
[1:05:15] we don't stop long enough to consider it
[1:05:18] and father that was my desire tonight
[1:05:19] was just slow us down for a moment cause
[1:05:22] us to reflect and look back
[1:05:25] cause us to examine our lives real
[1:05:27] quietly closely
[1:05:28] and see lord
[1:05:30] what are we doing why are we doing what
[1:05:32] we're doing
[1:05:35] so father i i pray that you would just
[1:05:38] work on every heart mind included
[1:05:41] lord you know every situation and you
[1:05:44] know us better than we know ourselves

[1:05:48] know your word will always
[1:05:50] never return into your void it always

[1:06:23] many sins our many mistakes
[1:06:26] our many times that we

[1:10:34] have a great opportunity we're in the
[1:10:35] atmosphere of believers we can sit down
[1:10:38] quietly reflect on our lives and see if
[1:10:40] maybe we haven't kind of clouded the
[1:10:42] vision of god for our lives in our lives
[1:10:45] maybe you just sit for a moment
[1:10:47] you can pray sit in your chair you can
[1:10:49] leave if you have to but maybe take some
[1:10:52] time and just re-examine for a moment
