[3:15] look into ruth this evening by the grace
[3:18] of god
[3:19] also i'd like to announce while you're
[3:20] turning there that next wednesday a week
[3:22] from today
[3:23] we're going to have brother vernon
[3:25] manahan from the philippines will be
[3:27] here ministering for us
[3:28] so there was a little confusion he was
[3:30] supposed to be here that's the original
[3:31] date he was scheduled
[3:33] then last week he told me that he's
[3:34] going to come early and be here sunday
[3:36] so i scheduled him for sunday then he
[3:38] told me this morning he can't make it
[3:39] sunday so he's back to wednesday so
[3:42] we're back to the original plan so if
[3:44] there's something on the announcement
[3:45] sheet that's confusing
[3:46] that's the reason why so to be a week
[3:48] from today brother vernon
[3:49] brother vernon we've worked with for
[3:51] years he's kind of taken over the work
[3:53] in cambodia for brother nestor
[3:55] he was in the video that we showed last
[3:57] month so it'd be nice to hear from him
[4:00] and then also we should be in prayer
[4:02] this saturday for brother nathan and
[4:04] sister natalie they get married so we're
[4:06] all happy and excited for them
[4:07] so keep them in your prayers and then
[4:09] it's an exciting time
[4:11] praise the lord all right let's take a
[4:13] look at matthew chapter 13
[4:16] verse 16 matthew 13 and 16.
[4:22] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[4:24] in your ears for they hear
[4:26] for verily i say unto you that many
[4:28] prophets and righteous men have desired
[4:30] to see those things which you see
[4:32] and have not seen them and to hear those
[4:34] things which you hear
[4:36] and have not heard them amen can you say
[4:39] amen
[4:41] amen i'm happy to be hearing and to be
[4:43] seeing what we're hearing and seeing
[4:45] and i just want more amen every time we
[4:47] come back it's
[4:48] i'm thankful lord for what you did but
[4:50] i'm here for more amen
[4:51] praise god let's just bow our heads dear
[4:53] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[4:55] this word
[4:56] lord we thank you for the opportunity to
[4:58] come and hear it again lorne
[5:00] we haven't come here lord leaning on the
[5:02] arm of flesh or to look at human
[5:04] instrumentality but
[5:05] we've come in obedience to your word to
[5:07] gather ourselves together and
[5:09] we rely lord on your word when you said
[5:11] by the foolishness of preaching you
[5:13] chose to save souls and
[5:15] now we're trusting that you will do lord
[5:17] what you've promised to do
[5:19] we pray to anoint the words that will be
[5:21] spoken tonight take control of this
[5:23] vessel
[5:24] that you would speak your words of
[5:25] eternal life right and sow it right into
[5:27] our hearts lord
[5:28] that we might grow thereby and be what
[5:30] you've ordained for us to be in this age
[5:33] we give you our we give you glory and
[5:34] honor lord and ask that you would take
[5:36] preeminence
[5:37] in jesus christ's name we pray amen you
[5:40] can be seated
[5:42] thank you thank you let's turn to
[5:44] matthew chapter one
[5:47] back just a few pages and we're very
[5:50] very familiar now with this passage of
[5:52] scripture
[5:53] i just think it's it's just amazing
[5:56] how much can come out of a few
[5:58] scriptures amen
[6:00] it's got it's gotten to be very exciting
[6:01] for me and and i never planned on it
[6:03] going this far
[6:04] and going this deep and i realize as we
[6:07] move on that
[6:08] we've gone through tamar and we've gone
[6:09] through rahab and now we're looking at
[6:10] ruth
[6:11] and you know we've missed stuff you know
[6:12] we've skipped over stuff but that's just
[6:14] the way it's going to be you know
[6:16] we'll go back if the lord allows time to
[6:18] continue as it is now we'll go back and
[6:20] we'll see more
[6:21] but we can only we can only preach as as
[6:23] god reveals
[6:25] so we look here in chapter one verse one
[6:28] the book of the generation of jesus
[6:30] christ the son of david the son of
[6:31] abraham
[6:32] abraham begot isaac and isaac begot
[6:34] jacob and jacob begot judas and his
[6:36] brethren
[6:37] and judas begot pharas and zerah of
[6:40] tamar and pharas begot ezram and ezram
[6:43] begat abraham
[6:44] and they ran begotta meena dab and
[6:45] aminadab begot niacin
[6:49] and solomon begot boaz of rahab amen
[6:52] that's woman number two and boazby got
[6:55] obed of ruth
[6:57] and that's woman number three that's the
[6:59] one we're looking at out of these four
[7:00] women
[7:01] that are clustered here in the beginning
[7:02] of matthew
[7:04] let's turn back to the book of ruth
[7:06] chapter one
[7:09] we'll begin looking there keep your
[7:11] bibles handy we're going to stay in the
[7:13] book of ruth and
[7:14] read quite a bit today brother branham
[7:17] says in the message
[7:18] revelation chapter 5 from 1961 she said
[7:21] now i want to begin
[7:22] right here now today on ruth and boaz
[7:25] now there is
[7:26] four stations or four junctions in ruth
[7:28] and boaz
[7:29] the first is ruth deciding and that's
[7:31] what we talked about sunday was ruth
[7:32] deciding
[7:33] and we didn't get past that one that was
[7:35] just as far as we got
[7:37] if you look through the book of ruth
[7:39] it's broken down really clearly in the
[7:41] four chapters and the first chapter
[7:43] covers deciding
[7:44] second chapter covers serving the third
[7:46] is resting
[7:47] and the fourth is rewarded and so it's
[7:49] kind of neatly divided in the book of
[7:51] ruth
[7:52] so there's four stations or four
[7:53] junctions in ruth and boaz
[7:55] the first is ruth deciding man ruth
[7:58] first she had to decide whether she was
[7:59] going to go into this land or not
[8:01] with naomi she had to make a decision
[8:04] then after she got there the next thing
[8:06] she had to do was serve
[8:07] in the field of boaz out there
[8:09] barefooted gleaning behind the reaper
[8:11] serving then after she had found grace
[8:13] and bow as a sign
[8:14] then she had to wait till boaz done the
[8:16] kinsmen redeemership to take back
[8:18] all naomi lost in order to bring in ruth
[8:21] to moabite
[8:22] and then the next stage is ruth rewarded
[8:24] now watch
[8:25] ruth deciding perfectly oh if anybody
[8:28] say that the bible wasn't inspired
[8:30] there's something wrong with them
[8:32] every word of it's inspired every word
[8:34] of it fits
[8:35] right together just like a dovetail on a
[8:37] plank it goes perfectly together like
[8:40] cogs on a mighty wheel turning just time
[8:42] to the millionths of a second just
[8:44] exactly right amen and the more god
[8:47] peels back and the more we see we see
[8:49] how exact
[8:50] the bible is the exact in words and in
[8:53] phrases and the way things are lined
[8:56] and there's always strange things going
[8:58] on in the bible that when you first
[8:59] glance over it doesn't make any sense
[9:01] it's seeming like things
[9:02] were out of order or things are not
[9:04] recorded correctly or
[9:06] or things are phrased or worded in a
[9:08] funny or strange way
[9:10] and when you go back and when god peels
[9:11] it open it's exactly the way it's
[9:14] supposed to be
[9:15] so whenever we hit into these odd things
[9:17] we should stop and say there's something
[9:19] there
[9:20] amen i don't know what it is but there's
[9:22] something odd about this passage
[9:24] and it's not just odd for the sake of
[9:26] being odd it's odd to draw our attention
[9:28] because
[9:28] god is revealing himself he's hidden and
[9:30] revealed in simplicity
[9:32] and everything that he's ever going to
[9:34] teach his bride is laying right
[9:36] here in this book everything that he's
[9:38] going to do
[9:39] everything that we need to know is
[9:41] laying here amen but it wasn't for
[9:43] previous ages to know
[9:45] so he had to hide it in plain sight
[9:48] so he wrote it in a way that you could
[9:50] read it and read it and miss it and read
[9:52] it and miss it
[9:54] but when when he would just turn the
[9:56] dial in our understanding just a little
[9:58] bit
[9:59] amen and clear that vision just a little
[10:01] bit and focus the binoculars just a
[10:03] little more
[10:04] all of a sudden it clears up and we
[10:05] understand what's been laying there
[10:07] and it's been laying there the whole
[10:09] time and you don't
[10:10] have i've said this many times but we
[10:12] don't have to revise the bible
[10:15] we don't have to then argue you know
[10:18] over all of these things we just take it
[10:20] as it is
[10:20] and god has a way of unfolding and
[10:22] unfolding and unfolding
[10:24] so it's been exciting very exciting
[10:27] so he says there's four junctions in
[10:29] here we've been through the number four
[10:30] quite a bit
[10:31] there's these four women clustered in
[10:33] these first six verses of matthew
[10:35] tamar rahab ruth and bathsheba
[10:38] and then there's four stages of
[10:40] restoration four stages of the grain
[10:43] four anointings through the church ages
[10:45] we've been through all of these we even
[10:46] went through the four stages
[10:48] of elisha following elijah amen from
[10:51] from gilgal to bethel bethel to jericho
[10:54] jericho to jordan
[10:55] and once they crossed jordan amen now
[10:58] elijah's taken away
[10:59] but the ministry that was in elijah and
[11:01] the mantle was on elijah now falls on
[11:03] elisha
[11:04] and now coming back acro out of the veil
[11:07] through the veil into the holy of holies
[11:09] goes elijah and elisha
[11:10] but coming out is just elisha just the
[11:13] bride
[11:14] with the same ministry that was on
[11:15] crisis on her
[11:18] and now she's got the double portion and
[11:20] she's got
[11:21] the the mantle and she's got the
[11:23] ministry and now when you
[11:24] you cross over now they cross back over
[11:26] jordan and not they elisha crosses over
[11:29] jordan and he comes back to jericho
[11:31] and the 50 prophets meet him and say hey
[11:33] we've got 50 strong men we can go and
[11:35] find elijah
[11:36] he's saying you're wasting your time
[11:38] because that ministry is right here
[11:41] that anointing is right here you're
[11:43] wasting your time and they said no we
[11:44] want elijah and they run off for three
[11:46] days looking for elijah
[11:47] and they come back but he tells them no
[11:50] and they ask again
[11:51] and he says fine do whatever you want
[11:53] but you're not going to find anything
[11:54] amen
[11:55] so when they come back from looking for
[11:57] elijah after three days they say hey we
[11:59] couldn't find him
[12:00] he said that's what i told you from the
[12:02] beginning you're not going to find him
[12:04] amen what you're looking for
[12:05] is now in another form
[12:09] isn't the bible beautiful
[12:12] amen so now we know there was four
[12:15] stages to the wheat plant to be restored
[12:17] it was the the stalk the tassel the
[12:20] shuck
[12:21] and the wheat so we're going to follow
[12:23] this through ruth which is the
[12:24] restoration of the church
[12:25] let's look at ruth chapter 1 verse 1.
[12:31] now it came to pass in the days when the
[12:33] judges ruled that there was a famine in
[12:35] the land and a certain man of bethlehem
[12:37] judah went to sojourn
[12:39] in the country of moab he and his wife
[12:41] and his two sons
[12:43] and the name of the man was elimelech in
[12:45] the name of the wife naomi in the name
[12:47] of his two sons
[12:48] melon and chileon ephrathites of
[12:51] bethlehem judah
[12:53] and they came into the country of moab
[12:54] and continued there
[12:56] and the lima like naomi's husband died
[12:58] and she was left in her two sons
[13:00] and they took them wives of the women of
[13:02] moab the name of the one was
[13:04] orpah in the name of the other ruth and
[13:06] they dwelt there about 10 years
[13:08] and maelon and chilean died also both of
[13:10] them and the woman was left of two
[13:12] her two sons and her husband so now we
[13:16] find that
[13:17] alimolec we talked about this sunday he
[13:19] leaves the promised land
[13:21] and a jew is never to leave his
[13:23] inheritance he's never to leave his
[13:25] position
[13:26] but now because of famine they leave the
[13:29] position
[13:29] and we talked about god bringing
[13:32] hardship amen in order to test
[13:34] our resolve and to test our faith amen
[13:37] that's why brother ben said sometimes
[13:38] you pray
[13:39] and after you pray you get worse
[13:42] and he said you should testify that's a
[13:44] sure sign that you got your healing
[13:46] but many times that getting worse is
[13:47] just a test to see if we really believe
[13:50] or not because if we believe
[13:51] our faith is not based on symptoms our
[13:53] faith is based on the word
[13:55] so whether we get better meaning or
[13:57] where to get worse that doesn't change
[13:59] the promise in the word
[14:00] that by his stripes we are healed so
[14:03] when you get
[14:03] worse that's the time to say praise god
[14:06] i'm healed
[14:07] because i'm not basing on how i feel in
[14:10] my body
[14:11] amen if i feel better then i've got
[14:13] faith if i feel worse i don't have faith
[14:14] it's not based on feelings revelation
[14:17] goes beyond
[14:18] feelings i've got faith in the word of
[14:20] god that his word won't fail
[14:22] and so now god will allow famine to
[14:25] strike
[14:27] no no not me this isn't a prosperity
[14:30] gospel amen this is the real true gospel
[14:32] this is a real true bible it's not
[14:35] always going to be prosperous
[14:36] you're not always going to be healthy
[14:38] amen you're not always going to have
[14:40] everything going for you
[14:41] amen because god is testing proving
[14:44] his children what's he looking for
[14:47] he's looking for a reflection of what he
[14:50] is
[14:52] hallelujah amen so now
[14:55] elimalek left and he goes and he leaves
[14:58] the promised land and goes into the
[14:59] denominations
[15:00] amen and there we're not wearing naomi's
[15:04] there
[15:04] then alimolec dies melin dies chilion
[15:08] dies
[15:08] and now she's gone through the the first
[15:11] three
[15:12] church ages and now she finds herself in
[15:14] the dark ages
[15:16] so we'll look at that in just a second
[15:19] but brother branham says in the message
[15:20] to kinsmen redeemer
[15:22] 1960 he says now this story starts out
[15:25] something on that manner
[15:26] as a lovable sweet woman her name was
[15:29] naomi which means pleasant alimonleck
[15:31] was her husband means worship pleasant
[15:34] worship was her family
[15:36] so you can see that everything started
[15:38] off fine when they first come together
[15:40] they were in the inheritance they were
[15:42] in the promised land she's pleasant
[15:44] her husband's worship we have pleasant
[15:46] worship that's how the family starts
[15:48] but some trouble comes along somewhere
[15:51] as trouble strikes
[15:52] and you begin to find out as brother
[15:54] brethren goes to say
[15:56] he says pleasant worship was her family
[15:58] they had a son
[15:59] maelon one one that means sickness and
[16:02] chile on the other meant weary gloomy
[16:04] sadness
[16:04] there was the family so you can see
[16:07] something has happened from the time
[16:08] these two come together in pleasant
[16:10] worship
[16:11] until now they're daming their children
[16:13] sickness
[16:14] and weary some amen so the their
[16:17] condition
[16:18] changed and now they're confessing the
[16:20] conditions around
[16:22] them and not confessing the promise that
[16:24] was given to abraham
[16:26] we're going to be very careful what our
[16:28] confession is
[16:31] and brother bam goes on to say and they
[16:33] came and they came a famine in the land
[16:35] of israel and the first mistake a jew
[16:37] ever makes is leave that land god gave
[16:40] them that land when abraham was given
[16:42] that land god told him not to leave that
[16:44] land
[16:44] and he made a mistake when he went down
[16:46] to gerar got in trouble
[16:48] a jew is never to leave palestine that's
[16:51] his lotted place
[16:53] amen and the church is never to leave
[16:55] the word that's her lotta place
[16:57] and that's what happened in the first
[16:58] church age she left the word
[17:00] and started taking man's ideas for a
[17:03] better understanding or something more
[17:05] reasonable or logical or easy to
[17:07] understand
[17:08] and she left her land and went down into
[17:11] moab
[17:13] brother brown typing moab here in the
[17:15] exodus journey
[17:16] in 1964 he preaches a message called god
[17:19] identifying himself by his
[17:20] characteristics
[17:22] and he's talking in the exodus journey
[17:23] he says on his road leading israel out
[17:26] to the promised land
[17:27] he came in contact with his brother his
[17:29] denominational brother
[17:31] moab now moab by no means were heathens
[17:36] that was lot's daughter's children one
[17:38] of their children
[17:40] had sprung moab now up there i want you
[17:42] to notice these two nations in contrast
[17:44] here was egypt a little scattered about
[17:47] no nation to go to no
[17:48] executives or no king or nothing or any
[17:50] dignitaries among them
[17:52] just a people on the road to a promised
[17:54] land and here they had to go through the
[17:56] land of moab
[17:57] it was right in the line of promise and
[17:59] moab also
[18:00] was a believers in jehovah and they had
[18:03] a prophet and israel had a prophet
[18:05] both of them had prophets so here
[18:08] they're believers in
[18:09] jehovah their their their cousins
[18:12] amen to the israelites amen they're not
[18:16] far off they're not wild heathens
[18:19] they're something similar to the
[18:22] israelites
[18:24] but their their brother vamp calls them
[18:26] the denominational group they got the
[18:28] denominational system
[18:30] and that's not where israel was supposed
[18:32] to go amen israel gets in trouble
[18:34] amen by allowing balaam to tempt them
[18:37] into mixing the worship between the two
[18:40] which they were supposed to be separated
[18:42] and here a few generations later
[18:44] elimelech because the promises are not
[18:47] coming to pass like he thinks they
[18:49] should come in the past
[18:50] is willing to leave the word and go back
[18:53] into denominational ideas and he's
[18:56] looking for bread
[18:57] and he's in the house of god's bread
[18:59] he's dwelling in bethlehem the house of
[19:01] god's bread
[19:02] and sometimes in the house of god's
[19:04] bread you can have famine in your life
[19:08] how is it possible we're the bride god
[19:11] loves me or the elect chosen how can
[19:13] this be going on
[19:14] the same reason it happened to israel is
[19:16] the same reason it happens to the bride
[19:19] to test her to prove that she will not
[19:22] fall like he fell this one's going to be
[19:25] tested she's going to be proven and she
[19:27] will overcome
[19:28] by keeping every word
[19:32] amen so they slip down to moab to the
[19:35] denominational group
[19:37] they never should have been there but
[19:40] but coming
[19:40] out now when they go to return there's
[19:43] going to be
[19:44] there's going to be four stages of
[19:45] restoration through justification
[19:47] sanctification
[19:48] the baptism of the holy ghost which is
[19:50] really the restoration of the gifts
[19:52] and then the holy ghost itself and so
[19:55] when naomi comes out
[19:57] now we find two vines are coming out
[20:00] orpah
[20:01] and ruth orpa is a make-believer
[20:04] but ruth is the real believer orpah
[20:07] thinks she wants to go back to the land
[20:11] she says we'll go she's going she's
[20:13] determined to go
[20:14] but when when naomi begins to explain to
[20:17] her the hardship and the trial and the
[20:19] sacrifice
[20:20] she says no i think i'll go back to the
[20:22] denominations
[20:24] but ruth didn't care she went on
[20:27] so we find now let's skip down to verse
[20:31] 18. it says after naomi tries two times
[20:35] to send ruth back
[20:37] and ruth refuses in verse 18 she says
[20:39] when she saw that she was steadfastly
[20:41] minded to go with her
[20:43] then she left speaking unto her so they
[20:46] too went until they came to bethlehem
[20:48] and it came to pass when they were come
[20:49] to bethlehem that all the city was moved
[20:52] about them and they said
[20:53] is this naomi and she said unto them
[20:56] call me not naomi call me
[20:58] mara which means bitter for the almighty
[21:01] hath dealt very
[21:02] bitterly with me i went out full and the
[21:04] lord hath brought me home again
[21:06] empty why then call you me naomi which
[21:09] means pleasant
[21:10] seeing the lord hath testified against
[21:12] me and the almighty hath afflicted me
[21:15] she's she's in thyatira right now she's
[21:18] in the dark ages she has nothing she's
[21:20] lost
[21:20] everything she went out full and she
[21:22] comes back empty
[21:24] but now there's going to be a
[21:26] restoration there's going to be the word
[21:28] coming forth
[21:28] she's coming back because she's heard
[21:31] there's bread in bethlehem
[21:32] she's heard about luther's revival she's
[21:35] heard that there's something that's
[21:36] going to bring me out of the dark ages
[21:38] and i can find bread amen she didn't
[21:41] find it in the denominations
[21:44] what she found was a loss of everything
[21:47] i went out full and the lord hath
[21:49] brought me home again
[21:50] empty verse 22 so naomi returned and
[21:54] ruth the moabite as her daughter-in-law
[21:56] with her
[21:56] which returned out of the country of
[21:58] moab and they came to bethlehem in the
[22:00] beginning
[22:01] of harvest praise the lord
[22:08] now now we talked about ruth deciding
[22:11] and
[22:12] that was chapter one now we're going to
[22:13] go into chapter two with his roots
[22:15] serving
[22:16] ruth serving the stage of sanctification
[22:19] and let's look at verse one and naomi
[22:21] had a kinsmen of her husbands
[22:23] a mighty man of wealth of the family of
[22:25] elimelech
[22:26] and his name was boaz and ruth the
[22:29] moabite has said unto naomi let me now
[22:31] go to the field and glean ears of corn
[22:34] after him and whose side i shall find
[22:36] grace and she said unto her go my
[22:38] daughter
[22:39] and she went and came and gleaned in the
[22:41] field after the reapers and her hap
[22:44] was to light on a part of the field
[22:46] belonging unto boaz
[22:47] who was of the kindred of elimalek now
[22:50] limalek happens to be the family that
[22:52] she's out of
[22:53] and she finds herself in boaz's field
[22:55] and this word
[22:56] hap means accident or chance
[23:00] fortune or fate amen so now
[23:04] they come they return back into the land
[23:06] and now they have nothing but
[23:08] but now ruth is going to go out and
[23:11] glean in the fields as somebody who's
[23:13] poor
[23:14] and in poverty she's going to go out and
[23:16] glean they have no inheritance they have
[23:18] no fields
[23:18] they have no income they have nothing
[23:20] but all she can do
[23:22] is is is take advantage of a of
[23:25] something in the law that allows the
[23:27] poor to glean behind the reapers in a
[23:29] field
[23:29] and so now according to the law she's
[23:31] going to go down there and get what bits
[23:33] and morsels she can get
[23:34] so that they can survive but it just
[23:37] happens by chance
[23:39] that she winds up and boaz's field and
[23:41] boaz is a type of christ
[23:43] amen and do you think that things happen
[23:45] by chance in the scriptures
[23:46] or was she ordained to find this field
[23:49] amen she didn't know she was ordained
[23:52] she woke up that morning to go out and
[23:54] find something that they might eat to
[23:55] live
[23:56] but she her footsteps were ordered by
[23:58] the lord amen
[24:00] and no doubt she had to make some sort
[24:02] of choice that morning
[24:03] to go out the door and go right or left
[24:05] to walk so far and stop at a certain
[24:07] place
[24:07] and no matter what circumstances moved
[24:09] her something
[24:10] moved her to a certain spot to a certain
[24:13] place where she would come to a certain
[24:15] field
[24:15] and in that field would be owned by boaz
[24:18] and that's the place
[24:20] where she would hat to light upon by
[24:23] chance
[24:24] because when you look at when you look
[24:25] at our stories those of us who are here
[24:27] that
[24:28] weren't raised in the message but just
[24:29] have come from outside
[24:31] amen there's just some happenstance some
[24:34] chance we just happened to meet somebody
[24:36] who had some odd beliefs and we were
[24:38] just curious enough to listen to a tape
[24:41] or read a book amen that wasn't by
[24:43] happenstance there was no accident there
[24:45] was no chance
[24:46] the footsteps of the righteous order of
[24:48] the lord god was going to make sure that
[24:50] you got into boaz's field
[24:52] to start gleaning out of the right field
[24:56] amen praise be to god it was her hat to
[25:00] light on the part of the field belonging
[25:02] to boaz it was your hap just to find
[25:07] amen to find the field
[25:10] of the kinsman redeemer of christ
[25:13] there's all kinds of fields out there
[25:15] but there's one that belongs to the
[25:17] kinsmen redeemer
[25:19] that's where the seed is
[25:23] verse four and behold boaz came from
[25:26] bethlehem and said unto the reapers
[25:28] the lord be with you and they answered
[25:31] him the lord blessed thee
[25:32] then said boaz into a servant that was
[25:35] said over the reapers whose damsel
[25:37] is this and the servant that was said
[25:39] over the reapers answered and said
[25:41] it is the moabitess damsel that came
[25:43] back with naomi
[25:44] out of the country of moab and she said
[25:47] i pray you
[25:48] let me glean and gather after the
[25:50] reapers among the sheaves
[25:51] so she came and hath continued even from
[25:53] the morning until now
[25:55] that she tarried a little in the house
[25:57] then said boaz unto ruth hearst thou not
[26:00] my daughter
[26:01] go not to glean in another field neither
[26:04] go from hence
[26:05] but abide here fast by my maidens let
[26:08] thine eyes be on the field that they do
[26:09] reap and go thou
[26:10] after them have i not charged the young
[26:13] men that they should not touch thee
[26:15] and when thou art a thirst go into the
[26:16] vessels and drink of that which the
[26:18] young men have drawn
[26:20] then she fell on her face and bowed
[26:22] herself to the ground and said unto him
[26:23] why have i found grace in thy
[26:25] eyes that thou should have take
[26:27] knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger
[26:30] amen and boaz answered and said unto her
[26:34] it hath fully been shown at me all that
[26:37] thou hast done
[26:38] unto thy mother-in-law since the death
[26:41] of thine husband
[26:42] and how thou has left thy father and thy
[26:44] mother in the land of thy nativity
[26:46] and are coming to a people who thou
[26:48] knewest not
[26:50] heretofore how does he know all that
[26:54] because this is christ she's not just in
[26:57] any field
[26:57] but he knows that you've left everything
[27:00] he knows that you gave up on the system
[27:02] you gave up on your father's belief your
[27:04] mother's belief
[27:05] you gave up on everything and you come
[27:07] here and he knows
[27:08] all about it amen she thinks she's
[27:10] pitiful
[27:11] she thinks nobody's going to take
[27:12] knowledge of her but here boaz the
[27:14] kinsmen redeemer
[27:16] already knows all about her life
[27:19] hallelujah
[27:20] you walk into church the first time you
[27:22] think nobody knows me i'm nobody
[27:24] but you've happened to the field of boaz
[27:26] and he knows all about your life and he
[27:28] can tell you
[27:29] everything about you where you've been
[27:30] and where you've come from and what
[27:32] sacrifices you've made to be there
[27:36] amen he says the lord recompensed thy
[27:39] work
[27:40] and a full reward be given thee of the
[27:42] lord god of israel
[27:43] under whose wings thou art come to trust
[27:47] and she said let me find favor in thy
[27:49] sight my lord for thou hast comforted me
[27:53] and for that thou has spoken friendly
[27:55] into thine handmaid though i be
[27:57] not like unto one of thine handmaids
[27:59] this is interesting the way she talks
[28:02] because she says you've been good to me
[28:03] though i'm a stranger
[28:05] and you've talked friendly to me as your
[28:07] handmaid though not like one of your
[28:09] handmaids
[28:10] now you have to find out boaz here is an
[28:12] unmarried man
[28:14] and there's handmaids all around amen
[28:17] and there's women all around
[28:18] why is boaz an unmarried man
[28:22] and now this woman is saying i'm a
[28:25] stranger
[28:25] and i'm not like the other maids hmm
[28:29] maybe that's what boaz is looking for
[28:32] maybe that's what boaz has been waiting
[28:34] all his life for amen
[28:35] for the stranger amen for the gentile
[28:38] woman to come along
[28:39] who's not who's a stranger in the land
[28:42] and not like the other maids
[28:45] hallelujah and look at what he says it's
[28:48] almost as if a prophecy goes forth
[28:50] in verse 12 he says the lord recompensed
[28:52] thy work and a full
[28:54] reward be given thee
[28:57] i wonder what she's thinking when he
[28:59] says that i wonder if she's thinking
[29:01] i'll get lots of barley i wonder if
[29:05] she's thinking
[29:06] god will be good to me and i'll be able
[29:08] to glean really well and i'll be able to
[29:09] pound out what i've gleaned
[29:11] and thresh it out i'll have plenty of
[29:13] bread for me and naomi
[29:15] no no doubt her mind cannot fathom
[29:17] what's actually being spoken to her
[29:19] a full reward come to you the lord
[29:21] recommends to you a full reward amen
[29:24] not a partial reward in her wildest
[29:26] dreams she's only thinking
[29:28] partial partial partial enough bread for
[29:30] tomorrow and if i'm lucky maybe i can
[29:32] get two days worth while i'm in the
[29:33] field
[29:33] maybe i can get something to sustain me
[29:35] maybe i can go to church and get
[29:37] something for just to
[29:38] make my journey just a little bit more
[29:39] prosperous or when i
[29:41] need a deliverance in my body and
[29:43] healing maybe i'll go and i'll get what
[29:44] i need
[29:45] amen boaz is looking beyond tomorrow
[29:48] beyond the next day
[29:49] he's looking for a full reward
[29:54] and sometimes we have the mindset of
[29:56] ruth and we're gleaning just for today
[29:58] and
[29:58] trying to get another little bit just to
[30:01] pass us by
[30:02] until we can get back to church or god
[30:04] does something else for us
[30:05] amen we're not realizing we've come to
[30:07] the full reward amen
[30:09] not we haven't come to the time where
[30:11] i'm going to beat out a little threshing
[30:13] that i get by my own hands
[30:15] then i'm going to work it out and try to
[30:17] grab something just to keep me going a
[30:19] little longer but we've come to a full
[30:21] reward and by the time we get to the end
[30:23] of the story
[30:24] we find out that ruth is not amen
[30:26] gathering among the reapers anymore
[30:28] she's not picking up little bits that
[30:30] are left behind but
[30:32] now she is joint heir of the field
[30:37] and boaz is laying down lord recompenses
[30:40] the a full reward
[30:42] and she cannot even imagine what a full
[30:44] reward
[30:45] is i have not seen nor ear heard all
[30:49] that the lord
[30:50] has in store for us amen but it's time
[30:53] that we don't
[30:54] think like ruth thought in this stage
[30:57] that we come a little
[30:58] further down the road and we realize
[31:00] we've come to a full reward
[31:04] hallelujah i'm a stranger
[31:07] and not like your handmaids perfect
[31:11] amen perfect that's what i want
[31:16] brother branham says in the waters of
[31:18] separation now back to ruth just a
[31:20] moment and look at it
[31:22] when boaz seen her he fell in love with
[31:23] her and he commanded her not to leave
[31:25] that field but to stay
[31:26] right there and glean fastly that's what
[31:29] god does to every believer that once
[31:31] comes to christ
[31:32] stay with him don't be carried about
[31:34] with every wind of doctrine
[31:35] stay right with christ and brother man
[31:38] said this message
[31:40] is christ and this field is the message
[31:43] it's the word
[31:44] for this age amen and we've seen people
[31:47] so many times
[31:48] amen they're unstable in all their ways
[31:51] amen because they're working through the
[31:52] stages they meant justification make the
[31:54] decision
[31:55] now working it out but when they get to
[31:57] this stage sometimes they get a little
[31:59] discouraged
[32:00] they meant about how much wheat there or
[32:02] how much barley they're able to thresh
[32:03] out
[32:04] and they try it somewhere else and try
[32:06] it somewhere else and try this and go
[32:08] back
[32:08] amen when what you got to do is when you
[32:10] come to the message when you come to the
[32:12] field
[32:13] stay put stay right here and glean right
[32:17] here amen
[32:18] read your bible grab a message book
[32:20] listen to another tape
[32:21] quit dabbling in other fields quit
[32:24] fooling around with the denominational
[32:25] stuff
[32:26] quit getting the books off the shelf at
[32:28] the bible book story man
[32:30] stay in this field
[32:31] [Applause]
[32:34] sometimes we become double minded by
[32:36] looking at too many sources
[32:39] and a double-minded man is unstable in
[32:41] all
[32:42] of his ways and we're taking the
[32:45] denominational mind and approach towards
[32:47] stuff
[32:47] and the message approach sometimes we
[32:49] just got to cut it all off and stay in
[32:51] this
[32:51] field amen until my condition and my
[32:55] position changes
[32:57] hey man he never told her how long to
[32:59] stay in the field he says you stay in
[33:01] the field
[33:04] well what am i going to do don't worry
[33:06] about what you're going to do stay in
[33:07] the field
[33:09] happens within the barley season don't
[33:11] worry about that do what boaz said stay
[33:13] in this field
[33:15] follow these reapers amen stay with
[33:17] these maidens and don't leave it
[33:19] i mean what happens when we go into
[33:20] wheat harvest stay here
[33:22] reap in this field what happens at the
[33:24] end of the week harvest don't ask that
[33:26] question
[33:27] you stay here because the one who told
[33:29] you to reap here
[33:31] is the one who will take care of what
[33:33] happens after the harvest
[33:36] amen we ask too many questions amen
[33:38] sometimes we want all the answers before
[33:40] we move forward
[33:41] but god doesn't give us all the answers
[33:43] before we move forward he says
[33:45] move and i'll explain it as we go
[33:48] amen sometimes we're afraid to move out
[33:51] in the things of god
[33:52] because we don't know what's going to
[33:53] happen next amen but we're not going to
[33:55] be told what happens next
[33:57] we have to move by faith because boaz
[33:59] said move
[34:01] bo i said stay here amen and she's to
[34:03] follow the reapers
[34:07] so if the reapers move she's got to move
[34:11] it doesn't matter if she still thinks
[34:13] there's good stuff
[34:14] laying back in that field that she can
[34:16] get he said you stay
[34:17] fast by these manes and you follow these
[34:19] reapers
[34:23] hallelujah praise be to god
[34:28] so she stays in the field we go to verse
[34:31] 14
[34:32] and boa said unto her at meal time
[34:35] come thou hither and eat of the bread
[34:39] and dip thy morsel in the vinegar
[34:42] i love this
[34:46] at meal time she says
[34:49] you make sure you come to church
[34:53] because that's meal time all day long
[34:57] you stress it out you
[34:58] you go behind the reapers and you're
[35:00] picking what's being dropped but at meal
[35:02] time i want you to come to the table
[35:06] and listen to what he says boa said
[35:08] under at meal time come down hither and
[35:10] eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in
[35:11] the vinegar
[35:12] and she sat beside the reapers and he
[35:15] reached her
[35:16] parched corn and she did eat and was
[35:20] sufficed
[35:20] and left now she is working in the word
[35:25] amen and she's grabbing bits and she's
[35:26] grabbing pieces of the word
[35:28] and then she's taking it back and she's
[35:30] sustaining off of that
[35:31] but boaz is saying something's going to
[35:33] happen different
[35:34] at meal time in between meal times
[35:38] you're reading your bible
[35:39] amen you're reading the message amen
[35:41] you're trying to glean and grab what
[35:43] bits you can grab
[35:44] and take it back and chew on it amen and
[35:47] make bread out of it
[35:48] but at meal time something different is
[35:50] going to happen
[35:51] at meal time you're going to sit with
[35:52] the reapers amen
[35:54] and boaz christ himself is going to hand
[35:57] you
[35:57] parched corn amen not corn that you dug
[36:00] out not corn that you used to rest
[36:02] but corn that somebody else dug out
[36:04] somebody else dressed and somebody else
[36:06] cooked amen and boaz is handing you
[36:09] threshed out
[36:10] picked up threshed out ground down and
[36:13] parched roasted corn and he's handing it
[36:16] to you
[36:17] and she took it of his hand and then as
[36:19] she did eat
[36:20] and she was sufficed
[36:23] hallelujah amen
[36:27] even in the story of ruth you can't skip
[36:29] church
[36:32] because we know that there's a
[36:33] supernatural element taking place amen
[36:36] it's not the man in the pulpit if
[36:38] there's a gift laying there and that man
[36:39] can get himself out of the way
[36:41] and we can look beyond the veil we can
[36:43] see it's boaz here at meal time
[36:45] reaching out parched corn amen
[36:48] giving something to suffice and sustain
[36:51] you
[36:51] in your labors in your work as you grind
[36:54] it out every day
[36:55] meal time boaz is saying here's some
[36:57] parched corn
[36:59] i fixed it i prepared it i cooked it you
[37:01] didn't do anything for it
[37:05] hallelujah who doesn't want to miss meal
[37:07] time
[37:09] hey amen oh i just love it
[37:15] handed her parts corn she did eat and
[37:17] was sufficed and left
[37:18] and when she was risen up to glean boaz
[37:21] commanded his young men
[37:22] saying let her glean even among the
[37:24] sheaves and reproach her not
[37:27] and let fall also some of the handfuls
[37:29] of purpose for her
[37:30] and leave them that she may glean them
[37:32] and rebuke her not
[37:34] i looked up this word purpose and it was
[37:36] very interesting
[37:38] this word purpose means to draw out or
[37:40] to spoil
[37:41] or to plunder or to take spoil
[37:46] and so what is he telling the reapers i
[37:48] want you to leave i want you to drop
[37:50] a spoil
[37:54] i want you to drop a plunder for her
[37:58] and she's going to come along and then
[38:00] like somebody who's come across
[38:01] treasure and here's not she's picking up
[38:04] little
[38:04] little stalks with a little bit left
[38:06] over that fell behind and every once in
[38:08] a while she comes into a handful
[38:10] it's a spoil for her amen it's a plunder
[38:13] amen no doubt she's super excited
[38:16] because now to get this much would have
[38:18] taken her an
[38:19] hour picking and picking and picking but
[38:21] every once in a while amen the reapers
[38:23] are told by boaz
[38:24] on purpose amen drop a purposeful a
[38:28] spoil
[38:29] amen a plunderful
[38:32] brother benham says then in the kinsman
[38:35] redeemer then
[38:36] he went to the young men he said now
[38:38] she's gleaning for life
[38:40] what are we gleaning for life
[38:44] this is our bread this is our life this
[38:46] is what sustains us
[38:47] this is the seed that gives us life
[38:50] which is the word
[38:51] she's gleaning for life now i want you
[38:53] reapers you angels in other words
[38:55] that's what they are said i want you
[38:57] angels you reapers every once in a while
[38:59] to drop a handful on purpose
[39:01] oh my don't let it all be so tiresome
[39:03] for her but every once in a while let
[39:05] her hear a good message
[39:06] let a good power of the holy spirit
[39:08] cover over her once in a while
[39:10] to let her know that i'm still there do
[39:12] some kind of a healing amongst her show
[39:14] some kind of a sign or a wonder
[39:15] that she'll know that i'm in her midst
[39:17] that's it
[39:19] aren't you glad in your journey that
[39:21] sometimes there's a purpose
[39:22] purposeful left left for you that
[39:24] they've dropped something on purpose and
[39:26] you come across it and
[39:27] are encouraged and sustained and excited
[39:31] amen amen brother bam also in 1957
[39:36] and the message questions and answers on
[39:37] the hebrews he says something else about
[39:39] these angels
[39:41] said the outside of you is one man the
[39:43] inside of you is another man
[39:44] so the inside of you is the supernatural
[39:46] the outside of you is the physical
[39:49] in this being if you are spirit led by
[39:51] god you become a messenger of god
[39:53] or an angel god's messenger god's
[39:57] angel is the very same word can't
[39:59] separate it god's messenger or god's
[40:01] angel
[40:02] so sometimes you become the messenger
[40:05] the spirit of god of your spirit let you
[40:07] become the messenger
[40:08] and sometimes you're the one leaving
[40:10] handfuls of purpose behind
[40:12] amen while somebody's working their way
[40:15] through
[40:15] trying to figure out where they are and
[40:18] how they're going to live and what
[40:19] what this message is and as they're
[40:21] gleaned through sometimes you're the one
[40:22] who leaves a handful of purpose
[40:25] hallelujah
[40:28] let's go on to verse 17.
[40:33] so she gleaned in the field until even
[40:35] and beat out that
[40:36] that she had gleaned and it was about an
[40:38] ifa of barley
[40:40] and she took it up and went into the
[40:41] city and her mother-in-law saw what she
[40:43] had gleaned
[40:44] and she brought forth and gave to her
[40:46] that she had reserved after she was
[40:48] sufficed
[40:49] and her mother-in-law said unto her
[40:50] where hast thou glean today
[40:52] and where wrought us down blessed be he
[40:55] that did take knowledge of thee
[40:57] so the mother-in-law could tell there's
[40:58] a bunch there
[41:01] where did you go where were you how did
[41:04] you get this much word
[41:06] what have you been reading where have
[41:08] you been going to church what have you
[41:09] been listening to
[41:11] where have you gathered in one day amen
[41:14] what's taking the churches a lifetime to
[41:16] come up with
[41:18] how to where have you been reaping where
[41:21] have you been gathering
[41:23] all this word amen
[41:30] and she said blessed be he that did take
[41:32] knowledge of thee
[41:33] and she showed her mother-in-law with
[41:35] whom she had wrought and she said the
[41:37] man's name with whom i wrought today
[41:39] is boaz and naomi said unto her
[41:41] daughter-in-law
[41:42] blessed be he of the lord who hath not
[41:45] left off his kindness to the living
[41:47] and to the dead and naomi said unto her
[41:49] the man is near of canon to us
[41:51] one of our next kinsmen hallelujah
[41:54] and ruth the moabite said he said unto
[41:57] me also thou shalt keep fast by my young
[41:59] men
[42:00] until they have ended all my harvest and
[42:02] naomi said unto ruth her daughter-in-law
[42:04] it is good my daughter that thou go out
[42:07] with his maidens that they meet thee not
[42:09] in any other field
[42:10] so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz
[42:13] to glean
[42:14] unto the end of barley harvest and of
[42:17] wheat harvest
[42:18] and dwelt with her mother-in-law so she
[42:21] was told to stay there her mother-in-law
[42:23] encouraged her to stay right there
[42:24] don't let them find you anywhere else
[42:28] you stay right here if you can get that
[42:30] much
[42:31] word amen from where you went to church
[42:33] today you stay right there
[42:35] in that field if you can gather in that
[42:38] message you can get this
[42:39] much life-sustaining word amen in one
[42:42] day of gathering
[42:43] don't you go anywhere else that's the
[42:44] field of the near kinsman you stay right
[42:46] there
[42:48] and it says she stayed fast by the
[42:49] maidens verse 23
[42:52] until the end of the barley harvest and
[42:54] of the wheat harvest
[42:55] now this is amazing because when you
[42:57] first read through this i
[42:58] i would just think that this all takes
[43:00] place in barley harvest
[43:01] but it doesn't amen they show up at the
[43:04] beginning of barley harvest
[43:05] and it runs all the way through till the
[43:08] end of the wheat harvest
[43:09] according to verse 23. and this is
[43:11] really important when you look at the
[43:13] feast of the lord
[43:14] because when you come to barley harvest
[43:16] i mean that's when you're coming into
[43:17] the first
[43:18] feast of the lord and the first one is
[43:20] passover
[43:21] after passover the next feast is the
[43:23] feast of unleavened bread
[43:25] and the next one after that amen is the
[43:27] feast of first fruits
[43:28] where they go to the field and they
[43:30] gather the first part of the field to
[43:32] come to harvest maturity
[43:33] and they lift it up and they wave it
[43:35] before the lord before the congregation
[43:38] and that first fruit is barley
[43:41] it's the barley harvest so jesus
[43:44] died at the beginning of barley harvest
[43:47] then they went into
[43:48] then they went into uh the feast of
[43:50] unleavened bread and jesus resurrected
[43:53] on the day after
[43:54] sabbath he resurrected at the feast of
[43:56] first fruits
[43:57] when the barley came up it's a sign of
[43:59] resurrection
[44:00] but then the wheat harvest
[44:03] is concluding about pentecost
[44:07] so the barley harvest is the first three
[44:10] feast
[44:10] but the fourth feast fourth feast
[44:13] number four is the feast of pentecost or
[44:16] the
[44:17] pentecost means fifty or in the old
[44:19] testament it's called the feast of
[44:21] weeks 50 days if you count
[44:25] from from the day after passover if you
[44:28] go
[44:29] seven sabbath seven weeks you have 49
[44:32] days
[44:32] and the day after is pentecost 50 days
[44:36] so they call it the feast of weeks
[44:40] so from barley harvest the beginning of
[44:42] barley harvest
[44:43] to the end of wheat harvest is seven
[44:46] weeks or the seven church ages
[44:51] so here for seven weeks
[44:57] why was ruth gleaning for seven weeks
[45:00] so that we can come back later and look
[45:02] at this and say there's the church
[45:04] ages right there she's gleaning for
[45:06] seven weeks from the first of the barley
[45:08] harvest till the end of wheat harvest
[45:10] until the feast of pentecost
[45:13] hallelujah that is amazing to me
[45:21] in verse three now we've come
[45:25] to the end of the wheat harvest so now
[45:29] we're in the seventh church age and
[45:31] we're going to move in
[45:33] to ruth resting amen
[45:36] a type of the baptism of the holy ghost
[45:40] and in verse verse 1 chapter 3 verse 1
[45:42] says then naomi her mother-in-law
[45:44] said unto her my daughter shall i not
[45:47] seek rest for thee
[45:49] that it may be well with thee and now is
[45:52] not boaz of our kindred with whose
[45:54] maidens thou wast
[45:55] behold he went on with barley tonight in
[45:58] the threshing floor
[45:59] wash thyself therefore and anoint thee
[46:02] and put thy raiment upon thee and get
[46:04] thee down to the floor
[46:06] but make not thyself known unto the man
[46:09] until he shall have done eating and
[46:10] drinking
[46:11] and it shall be when he lieth down that
[46:13] thou shalt mark the place where he shall
[46:15] lie
[46:16] thou shalt go in and uncover his feet
[46:18] and lay thee down
[46:19] and he will tell thee what thou shalt do
[46:22] and she said unto her
[46:23] all that thou sayest unto me i will do
[46:26] and she went down into the floor
[46:28] and did according to all that her
[46:29] mother-in-law obeyed her and when boaz
[46:31] had eaten and drunk and his heart was
[46:33] merry
[46:34] he went to lie down at the end of the
[46:35] heap of corn and she came
[46:37] softly and uncovered his feet and laid
[46:39] her down
[46:41] and it came to pass at midnight that the
[46:43] man was afraid
[46:44] and turned himself and behold a woman
[46:47] lay at his feet
[46:48] and he said who art thou and she
[46:49] answered i am ruth thine handmaid
[46:51] spread therefore thy skirt over thine
[46:54] handmaid for thou art a near
[46:56] kinsmen and he said blessed be thou of
[46:58] the lord my daughter
[46:59] for thou has shown more kindness in the
[47:01] latter end
[47:02] than at the beginning and so much as
[47:04] thou followest not
[47:06] young men whether poor or rich and now
[47:08] my daughter fear not
[47:10] i will do to thee all that thou
[47:12] requirest for all the city of my people
[47:14] doth know that thou
[47:15] art a virtuous woman
[47:19] so her mother tells her to go down he's
[47:21] winnowing barley
[47:23] and so the window barley is is on the
[47:26] threshing floor when they've beat it and
[47:27] they've rolled the stones over it or had
[47:29] the oxen trample it whatever
[47:30] amen now the shaft is breaking apart
[47:32] from the wheat and they do it in the
[47:34] evening when the winds are blowing
[47:36] and they begin to toss it with a
[47:37] winnowing fork in the air and the wind
[47:39] blows the chaff and the dust and the
[47:41] dirt away
[47:42] and the seed falls back so now it's a
[47:44] time
[47:45] amen when he's when he's gathering all
[47:46] the seed and then he's gathering all the
[47:48] wheat together
[47:50] and now she's going to meet him where
[47:52] the word is
[47:54] she's going down to the threshing floor
[47:57] and she's going to
[47:57] she's going to meet boaz
[48:01] amen on the threshing floor and where is
[48:04] he laying down
[48:05] he's laying down by the heap of corn
[48:08] where do you find boaz where the full
[48:10] word is
[48:12] when the full harvest is taken and the
[48:14] full harvest amen of the word
[48:16] has come back amen been winnowed out and
[48:19] come back it's laying as a heap on the
[48:21] threshing floor
[48:22] that's where boaz is if you want to find
[48:24] boaz where's the heap of corn you'll
[48:26] find boaz
[48:27] where's all the word gathered together
[48:29] that's where boaz is
[48:32] amen and naomi knew where boaz would be
[48:34] not in the house
[48:35] not not up resting he's going to be
[48:37] where the word is where the harvest of
[48:39] the word is that's where he's at
[48:42] amen she goes down she uncovers his feet
[48:46] and she lays down on his feet
[48:47] like a servant and he startled
[48:52] midnight startled
[48:55] he sees a woman he says who art thou i'm
[48:57] ruth thy handmaid
[48:58] cover me with thy skirt that's the same
[49:02] word that was used earlier in chapter 2
[49:05] and we look at it in 2
[49:08] verses 12 when he says the lord
[49:11] recompensed thy work and a full
[49:12] reward be given thee of the lord god of
[49:14] israel under whose wings
[49:18] thou art come to trust that's the same
[49:20] word a skirt down here when she says
[49:22] cover me with your skirt
[49:23] she's saying cover me with your wings
[49:25] cover over me and protect me
[49:27] amen cover me and he says
[49:30] he takes his skirt and he throws it over
[49:32] her saying you've come
[49:34] under my protection now he makes a
[49:37] promise unto her
[49:38] and look at what he says in verse 10
[49:42] blessed be thou of the lord my daughter
[49:44] for thou has showed more kindness in the
[49:46] latter end
[49:47] than at the beginning kindness to who
[49:51] kindness to boaz where did she show
[49:54] kindness to boaz
[49:57] it's not kindness to boaz it's kindness
[49:59] to naomi
[50:02] amen thou showed more kindness in the
[50:04] latter end
[50:05] than in the beginning insomnia says
[50:07] they'll follow us not young men whether
[50:09] poor or rich
[50:10] she's not after a handsome man
[50:14] she's not after a young man she's not
[50:17] after something that makes her
[50:19] feel good she's looking for redemption
[50:22] this is what boaz realizes when she
[50:24] comes to the threshing floor she's not
[50:26] looking for an illicit relationship
[50:28] because he said
[50:28] all the city knows that thou art a
[50:30] virtuous woman
[50:32] he's not questioning whether or not
[50:34] she's virtuous or righteous that's
[50:35] without question
[50:36] that's already been proved she's laying
[50:38] down in humility
[50:40] and she's giving herself to boaz
[50:43] not for lust not for benefits not for
[50:46] what she gets out of deal
[50:48] but she's looking for redemption amen
[50:51] and her whole motivation is redemption
[50:53] amen because the bride's motivation is
[50:56] redemption
[50:57] she's not here for the benefit she's not
[50:59] here for the program
[51:00] she's here because there's something
[51:02] moving her to this word
[51:03] to this christ it's the whole plan of
[51:05] redemption
[51:06] is now hinged on this woman and the
[51:09] whole plan of redemption is now hinged
[51:11] on the bride
[51:13] there's something motivating you on a
[51:15] cold day to get in a cold car
[51:17] and drive to church why because you want
[51:19] the parched corn that boaz is going to
[51:21] give you
[51:22] amen because there's something moving
[51:24] you amen someday you said
[51:26] i'm giving myself to this boaz amen he's
[51:29] been feeding me they've been dropping
[51:30] handfuls of purpose
[51:31] he's given me parched corn but now
[51:34] there's something
[51:34] moving me to give more than my time in
[51:37] the field
[51:38] more than the gleaning i'm going to give
[51:40] all of myself to him now
[51:43] she throws herself at his feet as a
[51:45] servant
[51:47] says cover me and he knows what she's
[51:49] asking
[51:50] and he knows she's giving she is giving
[51:53] herself to him
[51:55] she's giving up her life and her rights
[51:58] to anything else and she's giving it to
[52:00] boaz
[52:02] why because of redemption
[52:06] he said your kindness is greater in the
[52:08] latter than it was in the beginning
[52:11] your motive is pure your desire
[52:14] is righteous what you want is it doesn't
[52:17] come
[52:18] from a human being it's not a human
[52:19] desire it's god's desire
[52:23] you have to remember ruth was married
[52:26] before
[52:29] and she was married before she was out
[52:32] of the land
[52:33] but outside the land she could not
[52:35] conceive
[52:37] she was a married woman married to a man
[52:40] but there's no baby
[52:42] amen so so naomi has nothing for her
[52:45] redemption amen
[52:46] she's left with nothing amen but now all
[52:49] of redemption
[52:51] the whole plan is resting on ruth orpas
[52:53] already turned back
[52:54] ruth was married to the firstborn now
[52:56] it's all resting on ruth
[52:58] and whether you like it or not the
[52:59] entire redemption plan of god is resting
[53:02] on you and i
[53:03] the whole works amen he says you're
[53:05] waiting on god he said god's waiting on
[53:07] you
[53:10] amen boaz brother man said fell in love
[53:13] with her
[53:13] in the beginning when he first saw her
[53:16] in the field
[53:17] boaz would have married her boys would
[53:19] have taken her she was boaz's choice
[53:21] from the beginning amen and he went
[53:23] ahead and he was
[53:24] protecting her and covering her before
[53:26] she realized it he told the young men
[53:28] don't touch her
[53:30] he told the reapers drop handfuls of
[53:32] purpose for her
[53:34] he told her come and drink sit in the
[53:36] shade come and sit at the meal
[53:38] he's already covered her he's already
[53:40] taken care of her his desire is already
[53:42] to her
[53:43] he's waiting for her to realize
[53:45] [Music]
[53:46] he's waiting for her to catch a
[53:48] revelation god has watched over you
[53:50] every day of your life amen
[53:52] he's made sure the young men don't touch
[53:54] you he made sure they dropped handfuls
[53:55] of purpose
[53:56] he's given you water to drink and food
[53:57] to eat he's watched over you
[53:59] every day of your life and he loved you
[54:01] when he first saw you in the field
[54:04] but he's waiting for us to realize this
[54:07] is the kinsmen redeemer this is the plan
[54:09] of redemption and i'm going to give
[54:11] myself to it
[54:12] [Applause]
[54:14] oh hallelujah thank you god i say god
[54:17] let me lay myself down at the feet of
[54:19] christ
[54:20] and say i'm your servant
[54:25] you didn't follow after young men she
[54:28] wasn't looking for a husband and babies
[54:30] for her own satisfaction
[54:33] she wasn't looking for a handsome young
[54:34] man amen to spend the rest of her life
[54:37] with and some fairy tale story
[54:39] that's not her motivation here on the
[54:41] threshing floor her motivation
[54:43] now amen she's laying herself
[54:46] on the threshing floor
[54:50] she's been threshed out and she's
[54:52] proving that she's seed
[54:57] who is it at midnight that's laying in
[54:59] the threshing floor
[55:01] the original seed christ and his bride
[55:04] laying on the threshing floor at
[55:07] midnight
[55:08] with what all the word heaped around
[55:10] them amen
[55:12] where are we at when we came to him it
[55:14] was christ and his bride
[55:15] laying on the threshing floor the
[55:17] original seed laying there with the word
[55:19] heaped all around them
[55:21] when at the end of wheat harvest
[55:25] amen at the end of the church ages
[55:28] oh do you love this word once you see
[55:31] the message you can't see anything else
[55:33] once your eyes are open then you see it
[55:35] here and here and here and here
[55:38] praise god
[55:42] brother branham said in waters of
[55:45] separation from 1955
[55:47] and when he laid down ruth noticed this
[55:49] not ashamed to dispose herself to this
[55:52] man
[55:52] as a real troop born again church
[55:54] tonight is not ashamed to dispose
[55:56] herself to the holy ghost call of god
[55:58] went right down into the barn with this
[56:00] man give him trust
[56:01] every man that comes to christ must
[56:03] forsake everything on both sides and put
[56:05] his full faith
[56:06] in the lord jesus christ no matter what
[56:08] your mother says what your daddy says
[56:10] what this says or mama says or what
[56:12] anybody says trust christ
[56:14] don't be afraid she walked in and when
[56:16] he found out she'd give that trust
[56:18] he throwed his robe over her you you
[56:20] won't have to tell you what that means
[56:22] the holy ghost of course to cover with
[56:24] his own robe
[56:26] so he covered her over and she was now
[56:28] covered
[56:31] in verse 12 it says and now
[56:34] he says it is true that i am thy near
[56:36] kinsman
[56:37] howbeit there is a kinsmen nearer than i
[56:41] tarry this night and it shall be in the
[56:43] morning that if he will perform unto
[56:45] thee the part of a kinsmen
[56:47] well let him do the kinsmen part but if
[56:50] he will not do the part of a kinsmen to
[56:52] thee
[56:52] then will i do the part of a kinsman to
[56:54] thee as the lord liveth
[56:56] lie down until the morning
[57:00] brother brim said in the message kidsmen
[57:02] redeemer now quickly
[57:04] let's get down to the end of it now we
[57:06] find now the next morning when she woke
[57:08] up she was happy waiting
[57:09] and the man came he went down he had
[57:12] another kinsman
[57:13] that really had option on the woman
[57:14] first have i got time to get to that
[57:17] well just a minute we'll get part of it
[57:18] anyhow
[57:19] the next one in the parable that had an
[57:21] option on you was the devil
[57:23] because you'd sinned and the first you
[57:24] belonged to him because you were his
[57:27] property for you were born in sin
[57:28] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[57:30] speaking lies
[57:31] and he could not redeem it see he could
[57:33] not redeem it so christ came and was
[57:36] made man to take away our sins to redeem
[57:38] us
[57:38] do you see it and the other man couldn't
[57:40] do it the devil couldn't do it
[57:43] couldn't die for sins because he was the
[57:45] very perverter that made sin
[57:47] see he could not he'd mar his
[57:49] inheritance the other fellow
[57:50] and satan would mar his because he is a
[57:53] devil
[57:54] let's skip down to chapter four verse
[57:57] one
[57:58] we'll come back and pick this up but
[57:59] let's read down here
[58:01] then went boaz up to the gate and he sat
[58:03] down there and behold the kinsmen of
[58:06] whom boaz spake came by and to whom he
[58:08] said
[58:09] ho such a one turn aside sit down here
[58:12] and he turned aside and sat down
[58:14] and he took ten men of the elders of the
[58:16] city and said sit you down here
[58:18] and they sat down and he said unto the
[58:21] kinsmen naomi that has come again out of
[58:23] the country of moab
[58:24] selleth a parcel of land which was our
[58:26] brother elimalex
[58:28] and i thought to advertise thee saying
[58:30] buy it before the inhabitants and before
[58:32] the elders and my people if thou wilt
[58:34] redeem it
[58:35] redeem it but if thou will not redeem it
[58:37] then tell me
[58:38] that i may know for there is none to
[58:40] redeem it beside thee
[58:41] and i am after thee and he said i will
[58:43] redeem it
[58:44] so now the first kinsman the near king
[58:46] said i'll redeem it
[58:48] then said boaz here's the catch
[58:51] then said boaz what day thou buyest the
[58:54] field of the hand of naomi thou
[58:56] must buy it also of ruth the moabitess
[58:58] the wife of the dead to raise up the
[59:00] name of the dead upon his inheritance.
[59:04] and the kinsman said i cannot redeem it
[59:06] for myself lest i mar
[59:07] my own inheritance redeem down my right
[59:10] to thyself for i cannot redeem it
[59:12] now this was the manner and former time
[59:14] in israel concerning redeeming and
[59:16] concerning changing
[59:17] for to confirm all things a man plucked
[59:19] off a shoe and gave it to his neighbor
[59:21] and this was a testimony in israel
[59:23] therefore the kinsmen said unto boaz buy
[59:25] it for thee
[59:26] so he drew off his shoe so now he goes
[59:29] to the nearer kinsmen and brother
[59:30] branham said there was another near
[59:31] kinsman that had option on you first and
[59:33] that was the devil because you were born
[59:35] wrong
[59:36] you were born in sin you didn't come the
[59:38] way you were originally supposed to come
[59:40] but you come through hybridization amen
[59:42] and now because you're born wrong
[59:44] now the devil's got an option on you but
[59:46] the devil can't redeem you for two
[59:48] reasons
[59:50] one he's not righteous and can't live a
[59:52] pure life so he can't pay the price
[59:54] but two he'll mar his inheritance
[59:57] because until the bride comes into
[59:59] redemption he can sit
[1:00:01] as a squatter on the land and satan's
[1:00:05] eden
[1:00:05] amen and he can sit there until somebody
[1:00:08] can take the redemption right
[1:00:10] somebody can realize amen that the title
[1:00:13] book has been returned back
[1:00:15] amen and i've got title deed rights to
[1:00:17] this inheritance to this word
[1:00:19] and he sits there as though he owns the
[1:00:22] whole world
[1:00:23] running every kingdom in every nation
[1:00:28] he doesn't want to see you come into
[1:00:30] position
[1:00:32] because he'll mar his inheritance
[1:00:38] i'm ready for his inheritance to get
[1:00:40] marred how about you because boaz has
[1:00:42] already went to the gates boaz has
[1:00:44] already come back and boaz has already
[1:00:46] told us the redemption price is paid
[1:00:48] and now amen we're going to take back
[1:00:50] our rights which is going to kick the
[1:00:52] devil off of his
[1:00:56] so let's go let's go back
[1:01:06] let's go back to chapter 3.
[1:01:14] amen chapter 3 verse 14.
[1:01:19] and she lay at his feet until morning
[1:01:21] and she rose up before one could know
[1:01:23] another and he said let it not be known
[1:01:25] that a woman came into the floor
[1:01:27] also he said bring the veil that thou
[1:01:29] hast upon thee and
[1:01:31] hold it and when she held it he measured
[1:01:33] six measures of barley and laid it on
[1:01:35] her
[1:01:35] and she went into the city amen
[1:01:38] and so now before anybody can recognize
[1:01:41] what's going on on the threshing floor
[1:01:43] there's going to be a secret that's
[1:01:45] taking place here
[1:01:47] before anybody that can recognize what's
[1:01:49] happening i want you to leave but before
[1:01:51] you leave
[1:01:52] i'm going to give you a token i'm going
[1:01:53] to measure out to you six
[1:01:55] measures of this word
[1:01:59] oh hallelujah take off your veil
[1:02:03] you're the secret before anybody can
[1:02:07] tell
[1:02:08] where i'm placing my secret before they
[1:02:10] can discern one from another
[1:02:12] take off your veil and in your veil i'm
[1:02:14] gonna put the six measures
[1:02:18] hallelujah amen praise god
[1:02:22] and amen and he measured six measures of
[1:02:26] barley and laid it on her and
[1:02:27] she went into the city and when she come
[1:02:29] to her mother-in-law she said who art
[1:02:31] thou my daughter and she told her all
[1:02:33] that the man had done
[1:02:34] to her and she said these six measures
[1:02:36] of barley gave him me
[1:02:37] for he said to me go not empty unto thy
[1:02:39] mother-in-law
[1:02:40] then said she sit still my daughter
[1:02:42] until thou know how the matter will
[1:02:45] fall for the man will not be in rest
[1:02:48] until he have finished a thing this day
[1:02:51] so when she saw the six measures of
[1:02:52] barley amen she knew
[1:02:54] amen this is a token you just sit still
[1:02:57] and see what happens amen
[1:02:58] you see what happens because he's
[1:03:00] already given you this revelation
[1:03:02] of the six seals he's already showed you
[1:03:04] what the six seals are
[1:03:06] amen and he showed it in white horse red
[1:03:08] horse black horse
[1:03:09] amen and she could take back those six
[1:03:12] seals and she could show them
[1:03:13] and they could pick them up and they
[1:03:14] could touch them and they could hold
[1:03:16] them but
[1:03:16] six is an incomplete number
[1:03:19] so there's got to be a seventh measure
[1:03:22] somewhere
[1:03:24] amen because seven is god's number of
[1:03:26] completion six is an incomplete number
[1:03:28] so he gives six and when you go through
[1:03:30] in revelations chapter six you go
[1:03:32] through six seals amen but there's no
[1:03:34] seventh tier you get over to revelation
[1:03:35] chapter eight
[1:03:36] when you get to the seventh seal it
[1:03:38] doesn't tell you anything there's
[1:03:39] nothing to hold on to nothing to touch
[1:03:41] nothing to investigate nothing to roll
[1:03:44] around under your microscope
[1:03:45] it says there was silence in heaven for
[1:03:47] half an hour
[1:03:48] for about the space of half an hour you
[1:03:50] don't have anything to dissect you don't
[1:03:52] have anything to poke at
[1:03:53] nothing to prod at because there's a
[1:03:55] mystery amen the seventh measure is a
[1:03:58] mystery measure
[1:04:00] she's got the six amen and now she can
[1:04:03] investigate the six and look at the six
[1:04:05] but where's the seventh
[1:04:08] oh hallelujah so just rest
[1:04:12] if you've got the sixth the seventh is
[1:04:14] on its way amen
[1:04:15] [Laughter]
[1:04:17] praise be to god
[1:04:21] praise be to god
[1:04:29] amen now brother branham says in
[1:04:32] revelation chapter 5 part 2 in 1961
[1:04:36] he said in what next thing ruth was ruth
[1:04:38] was rewarded
[1:04:40] that's what the church did it entered
[1:04:42] into justification under luther
[1:04:43] then it went into sanctification under
[1:04:45] wesley went into the baptism of the holy
[1:04:48] ghost
[1:04:48] in this last days and now resting with
[1:04:51] the earnest of our inheritance
[1:04:52] that we know that something happened in
[1:04:55] us we've passed from death into life
[1:04:57] and waiting groaning with nature for
[1:04:59] that time when we will receive an
[1:05:01] immortal life and immortal fullness our
[1:05:03] bodies will be redeemed
[1:05:04] everything's redeemed and we're just
[1:05:05] waiting for him to return back from the
[1:05:07] gate
[1:05:08] amen then what ruth was rewarded
[1:05:11] that's when we'll be rewarded that's
[1:05:14] what this seven sealed book is going to
[1:05:16] open up to us
[1:05:18] brother venom is here in 1961 and he's
[1:05:21] looking forward
[1:05:21] he's wanting to preach the seals wanting
[1:05:23] the priest to seals and he says now
[1:05:25] ruth is rewarded that's when we'll be
[1:05:28] rewarded
[1:05:29] that's what this seven sealed book is
[1:05:31] going to open
[1:05:32] up to us what when she's rewarded
[1:05:36] and how she's rewarded what is these
[1:05:39] things
[1:05:40] they're mysteries they're not wrote in
[1:05:41] the word they have to be revealed by the
[1:05:43] holy spirit
[1:05:44] but if you'll notice actually they are
[1:05:46] revealed all down through the scriptures
[1:05:48] but they've been hid from the people all
[1:05:51] the way back before the seals
[1:05:53] he's recognizing that it's all down
[1:05:55] through the scriptures but it's been hid
[1:05:58] amen so what brother ben was talking
[1:06:00] about he's talking about the seven
[1:06:01] thunders he says because they're not
[1:06:02] even road
[1:06:03] amen those those seals in revelation
[1:06:06] chapter 5
[1:06:07] when they were broken amen there was a
[1:06:08] symbol that went forth and that was
[1:06:10] written down in the word
[1:06:11] white horse red horse black horse pale
[1:06:13] wars it was written down
[1:06:15] but when the seven thunders uttered he
[1:06:17] said write it not something that's not
[1:06:19] even written
[1:06:19] what is that it's the revelation of the
[1:06:21] seven seals
[1:06:22] not even written but it's been all down
[1:06:24] through scripture but hid
[1:06:28] but the seven seals is going to open
[1:06:30] this up amen what seven seals
[1:06:33] the seven seals on the seven thunders
[1:06:35] what was told not to write
[1:06:37] that part that was spoken by christ but
[1:06:39] john heard it but john was told not to
[1:06:41] write it
[1:06:41] amen that seven sealed book is going to
[1:06:44] open it up to us and tell us
[1:06:46] now hallelujah
[1:06:54] now let's go to chapter 4 verse 9.
[1:07:00] now boaz is at the gates with the elders
[1:07:04] this is chapter 5 of revelation
[1:07:08] at the gate the gate is the judgment
[1:07:11] seat of every city
[1:07:12] so boaz is at the judgment seat with the
[1:07:15] elders
[1:07:16] and what is he doing at the judgment
[1:07:19] seat with the elders
[1:07:20] he's working out redemption of the bride
[1:07:24] what's he doing in revelations chapter 5
[1:07:26] with all the elders that
[1:07:28] are there at the judgment seat he's
[1:07:30] working out redemption of the bride
[1:07:34] hallelujah verse 9 and boaz said unto
[1:07:38] the elders
[1:07:40] and unto all the people you are
[1:07:41] witnesses this day that i have bought
[1:07:44] all that was a lima lex and all that was
[1:07:46] chileons and
[1:07:47] melons and at the hand of naomi moreover
[1:07:50] ruth the moabite as the wife of baylon
[1:07:52] have i purchased to be my wife
[1:07:54] to raise up the name of the dead upon
[1:07:56] his inheritance that the name of the
[1:07:58] dead be not cut off from among his
[1:07:59] brother and from the gate of this place
[1:08:02] ye are witnesses this day and all the
[1:08:05] people that were in the gate
[1:08:07] and the elders said we are witnesses the
[1:08:10] lord make the woman that is come unto
[1:08:12] thine house like rachel and like leah
[1:08:14] which two did build the house of israel
[1:08:16] and do thou worthily in ephrataf
[1:08:19] ephrata and be famous in bethlehem and
[1:08:22] let that
[1:08:22] let thy house be like the house of
[1:08:24] pharas whom tamar
[1:08:27] bear unto judah of the seed which the
[1:08:29] lord shall give thee
[1:08:30] of this young woman amen
[1:08:33] so boaz took ruth and she was his wife
[1:08:37] and when he went into her the lord gave
[1:08:39] her conception
[1:08:41] and she bear a son now remember this is
[1:08:45] the woman who was married before who
[1:08:47] never conceived
[1:08:49] she was down in the systems and she was
[1:08:51] married before but there was no
[1:08:53] conception no conception
[1:08:54] but now she moves back into the land she
[1:08:57] labors through the land
[1:08:58] she goes through three stages of grace
[1:09:00] but in the fourth stage of grace she's
[1:09:02] going to be rewarded
[1:09:04] what is her reward what is her reward
[1:09:08] not six measures of barley that's not
[1:09:11] her reward
[1:09:12] the revelation of the six seals is not
[1:09:14] her relord what is her reward
[1:09:17] it's that mystery seven
[1:09:21] amen who's the seventh seal it's the one
[1:09:25] dishing out the six the mystery
[1:09:28] is in the christ dishing out the six
[1:09:30] measures i'll give you this
[1:09:32] and i'll give you this and i'll give you
[1:09:33] this and she walks away with six
[1:09:35] measures
[1:09:35] where's the seventh he's the seventh
[1:09:39] and where does she get the seventh
[1:09:41] measure amen
[1:09:42] it's after he's worked it out in the
[1:09:44] gates amen and he's come back after he's
[1:09:47] worked out redemption
[1:09:48] and he goes and he takes the woman and
[1:09:50] to himself in an invisible union
[1:09:52] amen and then he sows the seventh
[1:09:55] measure of seed
[1:09:56] into the woman into the womb of the
[1:09:59] woman
[1:09:59] and the woman conceives on the seventh
[1:10:02] measure of seed
[1:10:03] not the seed that you can touch not the
[1:10:05] seed that you can roll around in your
[1:10:07] hand
[1:10:07] but the seed that nobody can see that
[1:10:09] nobody knows about that's not spoken
[1:10:11] the third pool when you get to this
[1:10:13] don't explain it
[1:10:14] why because it takes place back in the
[1:10:16] holy of holies
[1:10:18] back in the private chamber with just
[1:10:20] the bridegroom
[1:10:21] and the bride is where the seventh seal
[1:10:23] is revealed
[1:10:24] in her and she couldn't conceive and
[1:10:28] couldn't conceive and couldn't conceive
[1:10:30] but now she's got six measures saying
[1:10:32] hey the seventh is on its way
[1:10:34] amen and after he works it out at the
[1:10:36] city gate he comes himself
[1:10:38] and he takes her himself and he sows the
[1:10:41] mystery
[1:10:42] seventh seed not something you can
[1:10:46] measure not something you can weigh
[1:10:48] not something you could put under a
[1:10:49] microscope
[1:10:53] it's the unseen mystery
[1:10:56] and where is it it's alive inside ruth
[1:11:01] it's not dead seed the seed comes in and
[1:11:04] finds a bedding ground
[1:11:06] the seed comes to a seed that's already
[1:11:08] laying there
[1:11:09] the word comes through the word that's
[1:11:11] already laying there life comes to life
[1:11:13] and it springs to life and now where's
[1:11:16] the seventh measure
[1:11:17] the seventh measure is inside
[1:11:20] ruth and it's alive
[1:11:22] [Applause]
[1:11:24] hallelujah once you see the seals you
[1:11:27] see it all
[1:11:28] brother brahman said when those seals
[1:11:30] were opened it unlocked the mystery of
[1:11:32] the entire
[1:11:33] bible
[1:11:38] hallelujah
[1:11:40] be to god
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:48] brother branham says
[1:11:52] in revelation chapter 5 part 2 from 1961
[1:11:56] as soon as he advertised who was worthy
[1:11:58] this is revelations 5.
[1:12:00] who is worthy he was advertising the
[1:12:02] coming of the kinsmen redeemer
[1:12:04] and here he stood a lamb and what did he
[1:12:06] do walked over to the throne where the
[1:12:08] spirit of god was at
[1:12:09] and took the book out of the right hand
[1:12:11] of him that sets up on the throne
[1:12:13] and all the elders fell down and said
[1:12:14] thou art worthy because thou was slain
[1:12:16] see
[1:12:17] and then he became his book or at least
[1:12:19] the book of redemption
[1:12:21] or listen to this how brother brennan
[1:12:22] words this i want you to catch this
[1:12:24] or the book of intercession in the
[1:12:27] church age was finished

[1:12:32] book that he's taken out of the hand and
[1:12:34] sits on the throne
[1:12:35] and he says the book of intercession in
[1:12:37] the church age was finished
[1:12:40] why because we've come to the end of
[1:12:41] wheat harvest we've come to the end of
[1:12:43] the feast of weeks
[1:12:44] amen now we're coming to the fourth
[1:12:45] stage amen outside the church ages in
[1:12:48] the bright age when the bride unites
[1:12:50] with christ
[1:12:51] amen as she receives the revelation of
[1:12:53] the seventh seal which is he
[1:12:54] himself
[1:12:58] at the book of intercession in the
[1:13:00] church age was finished now he becomes
[1:13:02] the redeemer listen carefully
[1:13:05] now the revealing of how he did it is
[1:13:07] going to be in those seven seals
[1:13:09] what is the seven seals the revealing of
[1:13:11] how he's done it through the church ages
[1:13:13] he comes to the end of the church age
[1:13:14] and he looks back and shows how he's
[1:13:16] been redeeming all the way through
[1:13:19] hallelujah now we notice like when the
[1:13:22] book of the mediator
[1:13:23] work of him was done got that
[1:13:27] the book of the mediator work of him was
[1:13:29] done the work was finished
[1:13:31] now in the first three chapters of the
[1:13:32] church finished but now redemption
[1:13:35] redemption is to be revealed what is it
[1:13:38] when he took this book now try to put on
[1:13:40] your deep
[1:13:41] thinking because we if we ever get to
[1:13:43] those seven nights you're going to to
[1:13:45] get it
[1:13:46] now now notice redemption immediately
[1:13:49] after his intercession was done for the
[1:13:51] church
[1:13:52] then he reveals himself as the kinsman
[1:13:55] redeemer
[1:13:57] when does he reveal himself as the
[1:13:58] kinsmen redeemer immediately
[1:14:01] after his intercession was done for the
[1:14:03] church
[1:14:05] he's not done interceding for you and me
[1:14:07] for the bride when he's done interceding
[1:14:09] for the sins of
[1:14:10] ignorance through the church ages when
[1:14:11] he comes to reveal the full mystery
[1:14:14] now he's not interceding for the church
[1:14:16] anymore when that's
[1:14:17] done he comes and reveals himself as
[1:14:19] kinsmen redeemer
[1:14:21] and as he revealed himself to you as
[1:14:22] kinsmen redeemer
[1:14:24] then where does that put us he's worked
[1:14:26] it out at the city gates he's been
[1:14:28] before the judgment seat and the outers
[1:14:30] he's paid the price
[1:14:31] now he's come to take his bride to
[1:14:33] himself just put in
[1:14:35] to her the mystery of the seventh sowing
[1:14:38] of the seed
[1:14:38] and now it's alive in her
[1:14:43] amen what's in her the king line
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:14:49] amen the prince of the house of judah
[1:14:52] the coming king
[1:14:53] is in her
[1:14:57] amen where where did boaz come from
[1:15:02] boaz came from the union of rahab and
[1:15:04] solomon
[1:15:05] what rahab was the harlot couldn't
[1:15:07] conceive couldn't conceive
[1:15:09] living in adultery living in
[1:15:11] prostitution
[1:15:12] no conception no baby until she comes
[1:15:14] into the land amen
[1:15:15] when she comes when she leaves the
[1:15:17] denomination she meets up with solomon
[1:15:19] who's the prince of the house of judah
[1:15:21] then there's a conception out of her
[1:15:23] comes the kinsmen redeemer boaz
[1:15:26] who does ruth happen to meet the
[1:15:28] kinseman redeemer boaz
[1:15:30] ruth was married outside the land
[1:15:32] couldn't conceive amen
[1:15:34] because she has a predestinated womb for
[1:15:36] a predestinated time for a predestinated
[1:15:38] seed
[1:15:40] that's why you couldn't settle down in
[1:15:41] baptism methodist and catholic that's
[1:15:43] why you had to move out of those things
[1:15:45] and there could be no conception there
[1:15:47] there might have been a mental
[1:15:48] conception but no soul conception
[1:15:51] because you had to come to the appointed
[1:15:53] place because it's not for you to have
[1:15:55] six measures it's for you to have the
[1:15:57] seventh measure
[1:16:00] and the seventh measure is sown in the
[1:16:02] secret place nobody was watching
[1:16:08] nobody could see my brother brandon
[1:16:10] preaches the seven seals
[1:16:12] six seals details details
[1:16:15] who's included what this symbol means
[1:16:17] scriptures
[1:16:18] detail explanation of why horse red
[1:16:20] horse black horse
[1:16:21] explanation of souls on the altar
[1:16:23] explanation of tribulation
[1:16:25] detailed explanation he gets to the
[1:16:27] seventh seal and he just starts
[1:16:28] reviewing the sixth seal
[1:16:31] he just starts telling you everything
[1:16:32] you've already learned and then after he
[1:16:34] tells you everything you already learned
[1:16:35] he starts to break into the seventh
[1:16:36] century he says now i feel to stop
[1:16:39] right here
[1:16:42] and then what does he start doing he
[1:16:43] starts saying remember the vision
[1:16:45] remember the dream
[1:16:46] remember the sword in the hand remember
[1:16:47] sabino cannon remember sir is what time
[1:16:49] it is
[1:16:49] he can't tell you what's taking place
[1:16:51] behind the veil
[1:16:53] that's for the bride in him alone
[1:16:57] boaz and ruth alone
[1:17:00] know what the seventh sowing of seed is
[1:17:05] know where it's at right praise be to
[1:17:08] god
[1:17:12] let's go on verse 13 again
[1:17:17] so boaz took ruth and she was his wife
[1:17:19] and when he went into her the lord gave
[1:17:21] her conception
[1:17:22] she bear a son
[1:17:25] man that didn't take long
[1:17:28] it didn't take years she had already
[1:17:32] worked through three stages of grace but
[1:17:34] when she comes to this one
[1:17:35] there's a conception right away he's
[1:17:37] already worked it out
[1:17:38] he's come to take her now look
[1:17:42] from that point on
[1:17:45] ruth is never mentioned again in this
[1:17:47] book
[1:17:49] boaz is never mentioned again in this
[1:17:51] book
[1:17:53] something happens
[1:17:57] verse 14 and the women the women
[1:18:00] said unto naomi blessed be the lord
[1:18:03] which hath not left thee this day
[1:18:04] without a kinsmen
[1:18:06] that his name may be famous in israel
[1:18:08] they're not talking about boaz
[1:18:11] they're talking about another kinsmen
[1:18:16] and he shall be unto thee a restore of
[1:18:18] thy life and a nourisher of thine old
[1:18:19] age
[1:18:20] for thy daughter-in-law which loveth
[1:18:21] thee which is better to thee than
[1:18:23] seven sons hath borne him
[1:18:27] why is ruth the gentile bride better to
[1:18:30] naomi than seven sons
[1:18:32] because naomi has been without the son
[1:18:35] for seven church ages
[1:18:38] but at the end of seven church ages ruth
[1:18:41] when she unites with boaz is going to
[1:18:43] conceive on the word
[1:18:44] and she's going to bring forth christ
[1:18:46] again amen and that christ when she
[1:18:49] leaves is going to be turned over to the
[1:18:51] jews
[1:18:51] who's going to be a restorer of her life
[1:18:53] and a nourisher of her old age
[1:18:56] and that's why this woman is going to be
[1:18:58] better to her than what she lacked for
[1:19:00] seven church ages
[1:19:05] amen verse 16 and naomi took the child
[1:19:09] and laid it in her bosom and became
[1:19:10] nurse to it
[1:19:12] that word nurse if you look it up in the
[1:19:14] concordance means
[1:19:15] foster parent
[1:19:19] where's ruth ruth is gone
[1:19:23] ruth took a body change and got right on
[1:19:26] out of here
[1:19:26] and now this redeemer that came forth
[1:19:30] out of ruth
[1:19:31] is given over to naomi and naomi becomes
[1:19:34] the foster parent becomes the nurse for
[1:19:36] it
[1:19:36] because ruth is not on the scene anymore
[1:19:40] now it goes back to the jews
[1:19:44] brother branham said in the revelation
[1:19:46] of jesus christ 1960
[1:19:48] now when is the gospel returning to the
[1:19:50] jews when the day of the gentile is
[1:19:51] finished the gospel is ready to go to
[1:19:53] the jews
[1:19:54] oh i could if i could just foretell you
[1:19:57] a little something that's fixing to
[1:19:58] happen right here see right in this day
[1:20:00] you see it's fixing to happen we get it
[1:20:03] in the church
[1:20:04] age and this great thing is fixing to
[1:20:05] happen we'll carry over to revelation
[1:20:07] 11 and pick up those two prophets elijah
[1:20:10] and the moses returning back again for
[1:20:12] the jews
[1:20:13] we're ready for it everything is setting
[1:20:15] in order just ready
[1:20:16] this gentile message this gentile
[1:20:19] message
[1:20:21] as the jews brought it to the gentiles
[1:20:23] the gentiles will take it right back to
[1:20:25] the jews again
[1:20:26] and the rapture will come so what
[1:20:29] happened
[1:20:31] he worked it out in the city gate
[1:20:33] redemption he come down to claim what he
[1:20:36] has redeemed
[1:20:37] what is he claiming he's claiming the
[1:20:38] gentile bride
[1:20:40] he goes into the secret chamber and the
[1:20:43] secret of the seventh seal is unveiled
[1:20:45] in her and now the life of boaz is
[1:20:49] living inside of her
[1:20:51] and she produces and what does she
[1:20:53] produce
[1:20:55] a kinsmen redeemer
[1:20:58] she brings forth christ again and it's
[1:21:01] turned over to naomi and naomi becomes
[1:21:04] the nurse
[1:21:04] at the foster parent and who where's
[1:21:07] ruth
[1:21:08] there's no more need to mention of ruth
[1:21:10] now ruth has turned
[1:21:12] the gospel back over to the gentiles
[1:21:16] and she's off the scene see this is the
[1:21:19] same thing that happened to rachel
[1:21:20] rachel was the preferred wife of jacob
[1:21:23] jacob wanted rachel but he had
[1:21:25] to take leah first through a trick and
[1:21:27] he had to work us seven years and he got
[1:21:28] leah
[1:21:29] which is the old testament typing amen
[1:21:32] the jews
[1:21:33] but what he wanted was rachel so he had
[1:21:36] to promise
[1:21:37] to work seven more church ages for
[1:21:39] rachel so he takes rachel
[1:21:41] and at the end of seven church ages
[1:21:43] rachel brings forth a baby and that baby
[1:21:44] is joseph
[1:21:45] which brother branham said is a type of
[1:21:47] perfection which is the type of christ
[1:21:50] and after she brings forth joseph now
[1:21:52] the seven years are completed
[1:21:54] amen and then there's more things that
[1:21:55] happen but then they begin to move back
[1:21:57] into the land
[1:21:58] and as they come back into the land now
[1:22:00] it's time for rachel to bring
[1:22:02] forth again when they get in the land
[1:22:06] rachel brings forth benjamin
[1:22:09] and who's benjamin brother bam said
[1:22:11] benjamin types to 144 000 jews
[1:22:15] now rachel's a type of the gentile bride
[1:22:17] she's already brought forth christ at
[1:22:18] the end of the church ages but now she's
[1:22:20] going to bring forth benjamin 144
[1:22:22] 000 and how does she bring forth
[1:22:24] benjamin she brings forth benjamin
[1:22:26] in her death as he's coming
[1:22:31] she's leaving
[1:22:34] as the gospel is going to the 144 000
[1:22:37] the bride is leaving the earth
[1:22:39] she leaves when benjamin comes and ruth
[1:22:42] is no longer in the story when obed
[1:22:45] comes the kinsmen redeemer comes from
[1:22:47] her
[1:22:47] and goes back to naomi the story
[1:22:51] is perfect
[1:22:54] now let's go to verse 17 and finish this
[1:22:59] and the women her neighbors gave it a
[1:23:01] name saying
[1:23:02] there is a son born to naomi i thought
[1:23:05] it was born to ruth
[1:23:08] ruth brought it forth to give it back to
[1:23:10] naomi
[1:23:12] there is a son born in naomi and they
[1:23:14] called his name obed
[1:23:16] he is the father of jesse and the father
[1:23:18] of david
[1:23:19] obed means servant or service
[1:23:23] he is the father of jesse the father of
[1:23:25] david now look
[1:23:26] verse 18. now these are the generations
[1:23:30] of pharas
[1:23:31] how did pharaohs get here tamar
[1:23:35] these are the generations of pharas
[1:23:37] pharas begat hezron
[1:23:38] hezron begot ram ram began amina dab
[1:23:41] amin and that began
[1:23:42] naeson neishon begot solomon
[1:23:45] solomon begot boaz where did boaz come
[1:23:48] from
[1:23:48] rahab and boaz begot obed where did obed
[1:23:53] come from
[1:23:54] ruth
[1:23:57] and obed begot jesse and jesse begot
[1:24:00] david
[1:24:02] without gentile women the line of judah
[1:24:05] would be dead
[1:24:07] there'd be no redemption back in the
[1:24:09] land for naomi
[1:24:10] redemption is tied to the gentile woman
[1:24:16] they end with a little genealogy in the
[1:24:18] book of ruth and the little genealogy
[1:24:20] is explaining the gentile women's
[1:24:23] contribution
[1:24:24] to the line of judah all the way to king
[1:24:27] david
[1:24:29] praise be to god amen let's all stand
[1:24:34] if we haven't been convinced that the
[1:24:35] word is perfect then we've missed
[1:24:36] something
[1:24:37] amen this word is
[1:24:40] perfect musicians if you want to make
[1:24:42] your way up to the gym if you could come
[1:24:46] i just tell your friends it's exciting
[1:24:50] many prophets and righteous men have
[1:24:51] longed to see what your eyes see
[1:24:53] and to hear what your ears hear and i
[1:24:55] just want to say thank you lord i don't
[1:24:58] want to be ungrateful but i want to be
[1:24:59] grateful that i can open my
[1:25:01] bible and i begin to read my bible and
[1:25:03] it's not dry and it's not crusty and
[1:25:05] it's not lifeless
[1:25:06] and it wasn't written for 4 000 years
[1:25:08] ago but i can open my bible
[1:25:09] and i can say yep that's talking about
[1:25:11] me and that's talking about me
[1:25:13] and that's talking about me
[1:25:17] praise be to god you want to know
[1:25:20] you want to know how to take somebody's
[1:25:23] attention off of the world
[1:25:27] show them their position in christ show
[1:25:30] them the revealing of the word
[1:25:31] amen when you recognize your position in
[1:25:34] christ as the bride of jesus christ and
[1:25:36] all of redemption is hinged on you
[1:25:38] who cares who wins the super bowl
[1:25:41] who cares amen who cares about this and
[1:25:44] who cares about that
[1:25:45] all of a sudden it begins to lose its
[1:25:47] attraction
[1:25:48] because there's something else that
[1:25:50] you're attracted to and the attraction
[1:25:51] to this
[1:25:52] is greater than the attraction to the
[1:25:53] world
[1:25:55] now you can beat somebody up and say if
[1:25:57] you watch that old super bowl you're
[1:25:58] going to hell
[1:25:59] forget about it amen you can't take the
[1:26:02] desire for something out of somebody's
[1:26:03] heart
[1:26:04] all you can do is show them amen where
[1:26:06] the heap of corn is
[1:26:07] and where boaz is laying and say there's
[1:26:09] the full heap of word
[1:26:10] and there's the lord of the harvest and
[1:26:12] he's right there and if you want him
[1:26:14] you've got to give yourself to him and
[1:26:16] go down and lay yourself at his feet
[1:26:17] and if somebody gets interested amen and
[1:26:20] they go lay at this feed
[1:26:21] they're not going to care who wins this
[1:26:23] and who does that and what's happening
[1:26:25] in politics what's happening around the
[1:26:29] world
[1:26:29] amen we watch the news because we want
[1:26:31] to see the prophecy fulfilled
[1:26:33] but we're not tied to anything it's not
[1:26:35] an attraction anymore
[1:26:36] this has become my attraction my life my
[1:26:39] identification
[1:26:40] this is my genealogy
[1:26:43] and how how could we not be attracted to
[1:26:46] it and love it with all of our hearts
[1:26:48] the bride is the seed is
[1:26:52] so there's no point in a bunch of extra
[1:26:55] rules
[1:26:57] what's the point amen
[1:27:00] i'm just going to show you where boaz
[1:27:03] has been telling his reapers to drop
[1:27:05] handfuls of purpose
[1:27:07] and if you can't get excited about
[1:27:08] handfuls of purpose then there's nothing
[1:27:10] i can do for you
[1:27:14] if you can't get excited about walking
[1:27:17] up on a whole pile full of grain
[1:27:20] then there's not a thing in the world
[1:27:21] that i can do for you
[1:27:24] if you can't get excited about knowing
[1:27:28] where boaz is laying and that if you
[1:27:31] give yourself to him he'll accept you
[1:27:34] there's not a thing a preacher a
[1:27:35] minister a counselor can do for you
[1:27:39] but if something in you looks at that
[1:27:40] and says that's what i want
[1:27:44] then just pick up the handfuls of
[1:27:45] purpose
[1:27:47] go to thresh in a mountain go to eating
[1:27:49] them come to church and come to meal
[1:27:51] time and let him hand you parched corn
[1:27:54] keep getting nourished keep getting
