[0:07] for more than just brother branham
[0:12] well you know i mean just science
[0:14] evolved and technology come on and now
[0:16] we have cameras and it's just it's just
[0:18] happenstance that we got a picture of it
[0:20] no it's absolutely perfect in the will
[0:22] of god
[0:24] that now this phenomenon this attraction
[0:26] on the mountain is not something that
[0:27] takes place privately on the back side
[0:29] of the desert nobody else can see it but
[0:31] now not only did somebody take pictures
[0:34] they took hundreds of pictures
[0:36] and not only did a few people notice
[0:37] that everybody noticed it it created
[0:40] quite a stir there was articles in the
[0:41] paper about it now there was a scientist
[0:44] who studied atmospheric meteorology and
[0:47] he stands outside and looks at it
[0:50] and he puts an ad in the paper calling
[0:52] for pictures to come together so he can
[0:54] analyze this and he begins to describe
[0:56] it and it makes such a roar it's so
[0:58] unusual that life magazine
[1:04] not vanity fair
[1:06] because this isn't vanity
[1:09] not time because this is eternity amen
[1:12] it's life magazine friends life magazine
[1:16] god is not dull amen god is not weak god
[1:18] is not hoping something works out and
[1:20] somebody gets it right but this is in
[1:22] life magazine because this is life
[1:24] coming down
[1:26] this is this is the giver of life this
[1:29] is eternal life breaking forth this is
[1:31] the opening of the seventh seal the end
[1:33] of time seal to bring us into a rapture
[1:36] to bring us back to the right kind of
[1:38] life
[1:39] and this doesn't happen amen so and just
[1:42] somebody says well this is what i saw we
[1:44] have to hear it and repeat it and read
[1:45] it read it in the book god gave it to
[1:47] you and put it in your hand and he
[1:49] showed you an attraction on the mountain
[1:50] and i think god is sitting here watching
[1:52] to see what you do with the attraction
[1:54] on the mountain
[1:56] this is a different day amen this isn't
[1:58] this isn't just for that one man that
[2:00] one man when he got caught into that
[2:02] constellation he represented the entire
[2:04] church
[2:05] [Applause]
[2:07] the prophet of god was representing you
[2:09] and i amen he was getting caught up in a
[2:12] rapture he was meeting the lord in the
[2:14] air
[2:15] i hope you can see that
[2:18] because who was up there he said it's
[2:20] our lord up there he turned to the right
[2:22] said it's our lord up there where did he
[2:24] go he went up there where did he go he
[2:27] met him in the air
[2:32] and brother brennan said all the way
[2:33] back in 1961 when he was preaching
[2:35] revelation chapter four he was referring
[2:37] to john in chapter four getting caught
[2:39] up and he said in the vision one man can
[2:41] represent the entire church
[2:44] and every event a man this time get
[2:46] caught up in this constellation and come
[2:48] out as the mystery that was in that
[2:50] constellation
[2:52] the seventh seal
