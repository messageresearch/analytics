========================================

Hey, listen. This is why um so many modern modern this modern teaching in the modern age throughout Christianity is God looks at my heart. It doesn't matter what I do. &gt;&gt; Everybody heard the extreme grace preaching that has become very popular in Leodysia because it suits the Leodysian nature. &gt;&gt; My rights, people's rights, right? and and and uh so now this extreme grace says God looks at my heart doesn't matter what I do. Well, there's there's a a a a measure of truth to what they're saying that God saved me uh separate completely separate from my works &gt;&gt; because when he saved me, I wasn't even born yet. Amen. And then, Amen. He was watching over me and securing me while I was doing all the wrong works. And he didn't save me cuz I started doing right works. He came and found me. Amen. When I was still doing the wrong works. &gt;&gt; So, so God from Paul's perspective, from the heavenly perspective, God is looking at he's looking for somebody who believe his word. Amen. And he recognized his faith and then he sealed his faith with circumcision. God is looking for faith and he'll seal that faith with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for God, that's enough. You're sealed to the day of redemption. Faith was what? Faith was what acquired it. Faith was what triggered it. Faith was what apprehended it. Amen. And God imputed unto us righteousness the same way. Amen. But yet God wants his word made manifest on this earth. God wants his word to live in every age. He wants his word to be demonstrated in every age. Amen. So there's got to be a testimony to every age that the word is true. And that testimony is our works. And that's what man sees. &gt;&gt; And that's why works perfects faith &gt;&gt; because it accomplishes exactly what God sent us on this earth to do &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world. Listen friends, God sent us here to do works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he never intended works to be the basis of our salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he's got something for us to do. And that something for us to do is to live his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To display his nature to be a manifestation of Jesus Christ on the earth in a many membered body. That's what he wants us to do. That's why when we say we have faith and don't have works, it's dead because it's not accomplishing what God wanted it to accomplish. But when faith is wrought together with works, not just doing something because somebody said it, but the actual works of God that's anointed by faith, those works, amen, are perfecting faith and accomplishing God's purpose on the earth.
