[12:46] he's at church what two or three days
[12:47] later
[12:48] praise god well it's good to see you
[12:50] brother god bless you
[12:51] i also wanted to say that brother rich
[12:54] and sister charity carbon
[12:55] are in the visit they're not here this
[12:57] morning they're down
[12:58] he's preaching for brother mike sievert
[13:01] today
[13:02] but he'll be ministering for us on
[13:03] wednesday so we look forward to having
[13:05] him do that
[13:06] for us and it's been a little while he's
[13:08] visited quite a bit and hasn't had
[13:09] opportunity because his schedule's
[13:11] always busy
[13:12] so we made plans three or four weeks ago
[13:15] so by the grace of god
[13:16] he'll be here on wednesday also want to
[13:19] ask you to pray for my family
[13:21] my grandmother passed away on thursday
[13:23] evening
[13:24] this past week and we'll be going down
[13:27] back down home
[13:28] on wednesday for the funeral and on
[13:30] thursday
[13:31] for the graveside service and burial
[13:34] so i just want to ask you to pray for us
[13:36] as we travel and it was the grace of god
[13:38] that she passed away
[13:40] you know this is my mom's mother and she
[13:42] had been praying that she would be able
[13:43] to pass away
[13:44] peacefully in her home and god granted
[13:46] her request and that's exactly what
[13:48] happened
[13:48] she was peaceful she was sleeping and
[13:51] then all of a sudden with no struggle
[13:53] she just stopped breathing and that was
[13:55] an answer to our prayer she was 89 years
[13:57] old she'd have been 90 if she would have
[13:59] lived to june 6.
[14:00] so she had a full life and we thank god
[14:02] for his mercy i also want to thank you
[14:05] personally the sisters here and the ones
[14:07] who would encourage mom along the way
[14:09] the last
[14:10] several months were really difficult
[14:11] taking care of grandma
[14:13] my aunt and my mother did that and
[14:15] several of you made a big difference and
[14:16] you know who you are and i want to say
[14:18] thank you and god bless you
[14:19] and just keep our family in prayer as we
[14:22] travel down there
[14:24] and while we're standing let's take our
[14:25] bibles and turn to genesis chapter 1.
[14:37] genesis chapter 1 and
[14:40] verse 26.
[14:45] these verses are so familiar that we
[14:47] read over them again
[14:48] and again and again but they're also so
[14:51] rich
[14:51] that they keep giving us more and more
[14:53] meaning because the word of god is
[14:55] eternal
[14:56] genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said
[14:59] let us make man in our image
[15:01] after our likeness and let them have
[15:03] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[15:05] over the fowl of the air and over the
[15:06] cattle
[15:07] and over all the earth and over every
[15:09] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[15:10] earth
[15:11] and so god created man in his own image
[15:13] and the image of god created he him
[15:16] male and female created he them
[15:19] and god blessed them and god said unto
[15:21] them be fruitful and multiply and
[15:23] replenish the earth and subdue it
[15:25] and have dominion over the fish of the
[15:27] sea and over the fowl of the air
[15:28] and over every living thing that moveth
[15:31] upon the earth
[15:32] man let's just bow our heads and ask the
[15:34] lord's blessing
[15:35] lord jesus we come to you god and ask
[15:39] that you would come and break the bread
[15:40] of life for us this morning
[15:42] lord we can through the gift of literacy
[15:45] be able to read this word
[15:47] but only you can give us the
[15:48] understanding mom
[15:50] lord i pray that you would come and that
[15:52] you would
[15:53] bring your word to past lord that you
[15:55] would minister through these lips
[15:57] your eternal words the lord may always
[15:59] say and all we do be pleasing to you
[16:00] father
[16:01] may you instruct us as your children in
[16:03] this hour that we're upon the earth
[16:05] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[16:08] you can all be seated let's turn to
[16:12] genesis chapter 2 verse 18.
[16:16] genesis 2 18 says and the lord god said
[16:18] it is not good that man should be alone
[16:21] i will make him a help meet for him and
[16:25] we we know this we're very very familiar
[16:27] with these things but
[16:28] when he said i will make him a help meet
[16:30] for him this word help me
[16:31] literally means a helper just literally
[16:35] a helper
[16:36] and that's the about the simplest of the
[16:38] translation you can get
[16:40] and so let's turn over to genesis
[16:41] chapter 5.
[16:46] this is chapter 5 verse 1
[16:51] this is the book of the generations of
[16:53] adam and the day that god created man
[16:55] and the likeness of god made he him
[16:58] male and female created he them and
[17:00] blessed them
[17:01] and called their name adam in the day
[17:04] when they were created
[17:06] so we find that god
[17:09] god from the beginning has declared the
[17:11] end god has declared his very heart
[17:13] purpose from the very beginning
[17:15] in the book of genesis and when god was
[17:17] creating as we've so often said he
[17:19] wasn't just
[17:20] doing something for fun something
[17:22] trivial something just
[17:24] but he was actually declaring his whole
[17:26] plan from the very beginning
[17:28] what his whole desire was and his whole
[17:30] desire
[17:31] was to have his expression himself
[17:33] expressed as male and female
[17:35] united together upon the earth that was
[17:37] god's plan
[17:38] amen and he showed it he foreshadowed it
[17:41] in in his son
[17:42] adam and his son's wife amen and they
[17:44] come together and god had created him
[17:46] male and female
[17:48] so within adam was both the male and the
[17:50] female as one in adam
[17:53] but god looked down and he said it's not
[17:55] good that man should dwell along
[17:57] i will make a help meet or a helper for
[17:59] him amen so
[18:01] he took he took and he brought up all
[18:03] manner of
[18:04] uh of beast and all manner of these
[18:06] things out of the earth and
[18:07] none of them was found a suitable help
[18:09] me a helper for
[18:11] adam because the only one that would be
[18:13] suitable would be one that was like him
[18:16] so we know this story been through it uh
[18:18] dozens and dozens of times you probably
[18:19] know what i'm going to say for the next
[18:21] three or four minutes
[18:23] you could probably say it but it's a
[18:25] great foundation that we've always got
[18:27] to go back to amen because this is the
[18:29] foundation he laid in the bible
[18:32] so it's a foundational truth that's
[18:34] going to always be true
[18:36] and anything contrary to it will be
[18:38] false
[18:39] so this is why it's so important so
[18:42] the only suitable help would be would be
[18:45] one like him
[18:46] and that one that was like him was part
[18:48] of him was with him was in him
[18:50] so god would separate the masculine and
[18:52] feminist spirit
[18:53] pull the feminist spirit out take a rib
[18:55] and from the rib
[18:56] fashion a woman another vessel and in
[18:59] that other vessel
[19:00] that came from the original vessel he
[19:02] would put the spirit that came
[19:04] from the original spirit and he would
[19:06] call that expression
[19:07] woman and he would call the other one
[19:10] male or man
[19:11] man and woman male and female god's the
[19:14] one who gave these terms
[19:17] amen that's why when the when the world
[19:19] wants to
[19:20] wants to change the meaning of these
[19:22] terms amen and change the purpose of the
[19:24] terminology
[19:25] are not even used amen any gender
[19:27] terminology at all
[19:28] they're denying the very god who has
[19:30] created them
[19:31] because god's the one who made the
[19:33] designation it's god's work from the
[19:35] very beginning
[19:36] and so now god god is what's he doing
[19:39] he's expressing himself
[19:41] he's expressing his desire he's
[19:43] expressing his plan
[19:44] amen and he forms the woman and he
[19:46] brings them back together to be one amen
[19:50] and as in as as one now he calls their
[19:54] name
[19:54] adam signifying that they are the same
[19:57] they are
[19:58] adam but they are adam expressed in male
[20:01] and adam expressed in female
[20:04] so we clear on that the deathsmith makes
[20:06] up adam adam expressed in male
[20:08] and adam expressed in female and i'm
[20:11] going to preach by the grace of god
[20:13] tonight
[20:13] on the message the dominating female
[20:16] spirit
[20:17] and the reason that i i take that uh
[20:19] subject
[20:20] that title is good it doesn't sound like
[20:22] a very nice title for one
[20:25] you know instantly it's like oh boy this
[20:27] is going to be fun
[20:28] but the reason i take that is as not pat
[20:31] this past
[20:32] wednesday when we preached on tithe and
[20:33] offering but the first time we preached
[20:35] on honoring god
[20:36] i mean when i got done with that service
[20:38] we had preached that service that
[20:39] wednesday night
[20:40] and i think brother ben came up to sing
[20:42] and he started the first song and as he
[20:44] started the first song
[20:45] a thought entered my mind i took out my
[20:47] pen and i wrote down
[20:48] dominating female spirit and that's why
[20:52] we're preaching this today
[20:54] because there's something that there's
[20:56] something about the dominating female
[20:58] spirit that does not honor god
[21:01] amen it's contrary to god's way
[21:04] into god's makeup so that's why that's
[21:06] where this came from and that's why
[21:08] we're preaching on this now
[21:10] i want to read to you out of the
[21:11] thyatiran church age from the church age
[21:14] book
[21:15] it says it is most it is most worthy of
[21:18] note that the very name
[21:19] thyatira means dominating female
[21:22] thus this age is characterized by a
[21:25] dominant force a force that ruthlessly
[21:27] evades
[21:28] all conquers all and despotically
[21:30] controls
[21:31] now a dominating female is the greatest
[21:34] curse
[21:34] in the world now this is a huge
[21:37] statement to make
[21:38] a dominating female is the greatest
[21:40] curse in the world
[21:42] and this comes out of the church age
[21:43] book and so now you find out why
[21:46] you know for me i always when i see
[21:48] these statements these statements are
[21:50] are so emphatic they're so
[21:52] matter-of-fact and they're they're so
[21:54] powerful
[21:55] that i always ask myself why why why
[21:58] what is the greatest curse you know i
[21:59] believe it because the prophet of god
[22:01] said it
[22:01] but i always want to know the why behind
[22:03] the why behind the why
[22:05] because it always goes back to the very
[22:07] nature and essence of god in the very
[22:08] plan of god
[22:10] and i found for me the answers truly are
[22:12] in genesis
[22:14] god initiated i mean everything started
[22:17] in genesis all the seeds were planted in
[22:19] genesis
[22:20] they come to fruition in revelation it
[22:21] begins in genesis it winds up in
[22:23] revelation
[22:24] is that true and so we go back to
[22:26] genesis and find out
[22:29] this dominating female spirit and he
[22:31] says now the dominating female spirit is
[22:33] the greatest
[22:33] curse in the world and i would say one
[22:36] off the bat
[22:37] obviously is because it's contrary to
[22:40] what god did in the original
[22:43] and we'll get to that more in a moment
[22:46] then he goes and he says the wisest man
[22:48] the world ever saw was solomon
[22:50] and he said and he's going to begin to
[22:52] quote out of ecclesiastics 7
[22:54] and verse 25 it says i applied my heart
[22:57] to know and to search and to seek out
[22:59] wisdom
[23:00] and the reason of things and to know the
[23:01] wickedness of folly even of foolishness
[23:03] and madness
[23:05] and i find more bitter than death the
[23:07] woman
[23:11] now sisters were not talking about you
[23:14] brother brahm said that so i can say
[23:17] that
[23:18] but i want you to catch one and
[23:21] i died i didn't i i didn't title this
[23:24] because it didn't come to me
[23:25] the dominating female it came to me the
[23:27] dominating female
[23:29] spirit because the dominating female
[23:32] spirit can be on a man
[23:37] they understand so we're not just
[23:39] talking about women so
[23:41] you can relax women breathe easy we're
[23:44] talking about the dominating female
[23:46] spirit because that spirit can be on a
[23:49] man it can be on a woman it can be on an
[23:51] organization it can be on
[23:52] all kinds of things but it's a spirit
[23:55] and that spirit
[23:56] he said that now the dominating female
[23:58] is the greatest curse in the world and
[23:59] there's a spirit that brings a
[24:01] dominating female
[24:03] he said now this is solomon in
[24:04] ecclesiastics i find more bitter than
[24:07] death
[24:07] the woman whose hardest snares and nets
[24:10] and her hands as bands
[24:12] whose who who so pleases god shall
[24:14] escape from her
[24:15] but the sinner shall be taken by her
[24:18] behold this i have
[24:19] i have found saith the preacher counting
[24:21] one by one
[24:22] to find out the account which yet my
[24:24] soul seeketh but i find not
[24:26] one man amongst a thousand have i found
[24:30] but a woman among all those have i not
[24:32] found
[24:34] he's saying he's talking about uh and
[24:36] righteousness the right kind of woman
[24:38] the right kind of man
[24:39] he said i've counted one by one to get
[24:40] the account and one out of a thousand
[24:43] men i found but not one in a thousand
[24:45] women
[24:46] and like i said again relax
[24:50] it's okay because
[24:53] god is showing how rare the right kind
[24:57] of woman is
[24:59] extremely rare in this world the right
[25:02] kind of woman amen and those who will
[25:04] express the nature of the right kind of
[25:06] woman
[25:07] is extremely rare solomon counting one
[25:11] by one
[25:11] out of a thousand couldn't find one amen
[25:14] because it was the
[25:15] wrong expression whenever he came to
[25:17] that amen but when god
[25:18] originated his design he originated the
[25:21] correct expression and he wanted to stay
[25:23] that way
[25:24] but when the expression changed amen it
[25:26] brought chaos
[25:29] amen and then he quotes paul
[25:33] he says i suffer not a woman to teach or
[25:35] to serp authority
[25:36] and i'd like to go to that scripture if
[25:38] you will with me to first timothy
[25:48] if we can go to first timothy
[25:58] first timothy chapter 1
[26:02] and verse 2.
[26:05] no i'm sorry first timothy chapter 2
[26:09] and we'll begin at verse 11. paul is
[26:12] giving instruction for conduct in the
[26:14] church and he says let women learn in
[26:15] silence
[26:16] with all subjection but i suffer not a
[26:18] woman to teach
[26:19] nor to usurp authority over the man but
[26:22] to be in silence
[26:23] for adam was first formed then eve so
[26:26] he's starting now
[26:28] with the reason the reason behind the
[26:30] reason
[26:31] right now he's saying let the women
[26:33] learn in
[26:34] in in subjection learning signs with all
[26:36] subjection
[26:37] amen but i suffered not a woman to teach
[26:39] in order to serve authority over the man
[26:40] but to be in silence
[26:42] for adam was first formed then eve so
[26:44] first thing off the bat
[26:45] adam came first then the woman
[26:48] and adam was not deceived but the woman
[26:51] being deceived
[26:52] was in the transgression so now he's
[26:54] saying because
[26:55] now the woman can has to learn in
[26:57] science and all subjection and not to
[26:59] assert authority over a man
[27:00] because adam was first formed then even
[27:03] adam was not deceived in the
[27:05] transgression
[27:06] but the woman was deceived and so now
[27:08] because of that
[27:09] god has now placed the woman underneath
[27:12] the man
[27:13] in headship because of this fall in the
[27:16] garden of eden
[27:18] so i want to go back and and continue
[27:20] reading now that we laid that down
[27:23] he we're still in the third time church
[27:24] age from the church age book
[27:26] he said from the garden of eden onward
[27:28] one woman
[27:29] has constantly and successfully tried to
[27:31] take control over the man so he's saying
[27:34] from the garden of eden and onward
[27:36] the woman this spirit has constantly and
[27:39] successfully tried to take control
[27:41] over the man and right today
[27:45] it's a woman world with the goddess of
[27:46] america being a naked female
[27:48] as the female idol falling out of the
[27:50] skies remember her arms were iron bars
[27:53] characterized the first or ephesian age
[27:56] so
[27:56] her power has grown until she has gained
[27:58] absolute authority
[28:00] such authority beings usurped by her
[28:03] iron disposition
[28:04] now he's beginning to talk about the
[28:06] church and now he's going to go right
[28:07] into the catholic church
[28:08] because this is dominating female spirit
[28:10] is the spirit of the catholic church
[28:12] and the false churches and that's why
[28:15] this is a big deal but you always want
[28:17] to look at the why
[28:18] behind the why amen so
[28:21] i'm going to keep reading here now a
[28:23] woman is not meant to have an iron
[28:25] disposition
[28:26] she is according to the holy scripture
[28:28] to be submissive to the male
[28:30] that is commanded of her a woman who is
[28:33] truly female all female
[28:35] will be of that disposition now that's
[28:38] why
[28:39] brother ben said it's a woman's world
[28:40] but i would say if you fast forward to
[28:42] the day we're in
[28:43] it's a woman's world on steroids amen
[28:47] because he was seeing women take
[28:49] domination he was seeing woman
[28:51] moving to realms that they traditionally
[28:53] did not hold in positions and places
[28:55] that would traditionally be said that
[28:57] wasn't for them it wasn't their place
[28:59] and he was seeing that and saying this
[29:00] is a woman's world america is a worship
[29:02] of women
[29:03] amen but but now we've got to the place
[29:06] where
[29:07] everything is being run by women
[29:11] they're they're advancing in political
[29:13] realms they're advancing in
[29:14] civil realms and workplaces to become
[29:16] bosses and ceos
[29:18] and all of these things and and take
[29:20] these positions that god never intended
[29:22] for the female spirit to take
[29:25] now that doesn't mean they're not
[29:26] qualified it doesn't mean they're not
[29:28] good at it doesn't mean they're not
[29:29] smart enough
[29:30] brother bannon was talking about women
[29:31] preachers one time and he says they can
[29:33] really preach do a better job than me
[29:37] but it's not the place god wants the
[29:39] woman amen that's not where he placed
[29:41] her
[29:41] that's not where he wants her and so
[29:43] being contrary to the very design
[29:46] and will and purpose of god amen makes
[29:48] it antichrist
[29:52] and you say it in modern culture and
[29:54] people look at you funny
[29:55] but but it's not it's not because amen
[29:58] that it's not because somebody doesn't
[30:00] want a woman to rise
[30:02] amen and have accomplishment and become
[30:04] a boss or a leader or any
[30:06] it's not because somebody wants to hold
[30:07] back the woman or somebody wants a woman
[30:10] woman than fear
[30:10] to man and brother bam said in many ways
[30:13] especially spiritually
[30:14] amen they're they're superior to men
[30:17] is what he says something along those
[30:19] lines they can catch things more quickly
[30:21] i think is what he said
[30:23] so it's it's not that it's because this
[30:26] is the way god designed it and this is
[30:27] the way god wants it and when we go
[30:29] contrary to what god wants and what god
[30:31] designed
[30:32] then it brings death not life
[30:36] so now we see powerful women ruling our
[30:38] nation
[30:40] it's just a sign of what's going on in
[30:42] the churches
[30:44] we have a woman vice president and the
[30:45] speaker of the house is a woman
[30:47] and all of these women rising in power
[30:51] all over the place it's not a good thing
[30:53] amen it's bringing
[30:54] death and destruction and chaos and it's
[30:57] not because they're not intelligent it's
[30:59] not because they're not
[31:00] they're not good enough it's not because
[31:02] they don't do a good job
[31:04] it's because that's not what god
[31:06] intended the female to be for
[31:09] that's the problem
[31:13] so i'm going to read this this last
[31:18] sentence that i this last two sentences
[31:19] i read
[31:20] now a woman is not meant to have an iron
[31:23] disposition
[31:24] well that rule out rules out all the
[31:26] women politicians
[31:30] she is according to the holy scripture
[31:32] to be submissive to the male
[31:34] that is commanded of her woman who truly
[31:37] who is truly female all female will be
[31:39] of that disposition
[31:40] not a doormat no real man makes a wife a
[31:43] doormat
[31:45] and i'll tell you why because you can't
[31:47] find one in a thousand
[31:49] that's why and brother benham said if
[31:51] you find that one
[31:52] you can't find one in a thousand if you
[31:54] find one she's a real jewel a real queen
[31:56] to you
[31:57] because she's rare and we've got a lot
[31:59] of rare
[32:00] jewels sitting in this church tonight
[32:02] amen and the men and
[32:03] the the children that are around them
[32:05] can say amen that's nothing but the
[32:07] truth and solomon had it right
[32:09] you can't hardly find one but i found a
[32:11] collection of them
[32:13] that jesus christ himself has collected
[32:15] out of the world
[32:16] so this is not anything against the
[32:18] woman the woman in her right place is
[32:20] one of the most glorious things that can
[32:21] display the very
[32:23] heart of god
[32:26] amen so i'm going to keep reading
[32:29] not a doormat no real man makes a wife a
[32:31] doormat but she will want to be under
[32:33] authority and not rule over the mail
[32:35] for he is the head of the house if she
[32:37] breaks that image that god made for her
[32:40] she is perverted
[32:42] any male that lets the woman take
[32:44] authority has also broken that image and
[32:46] he
[32:46] is perverted
[32:50] so praise be to god it goes both ways
[32:55] but he said if she's of the right nature
[32:57] of the right spirit
[32:59] she'll want to be under headship
[33:03] and if she breaks that image gone made
[33:05] of her she's perverted
[33:06] well who is it that perverts the image
[33:09] of god
[33:10] who is it that perverts the will and
[33:12] plan of god amen
[33:13] satan is the perverter of the word amen
[33:16] that's why brother ben said satan is her
[33:18] designer
[33:20] he's fashioned her to be perverted and a
[33:23] man
[33:24] that will let the woman take authority
[33:26] has also broken that image
[33:28] and he is perverted
[33:32] that is why a woman cannot wear that
[33:34] which pertain it to a man
[33:35] or cut her hair now when you want to get
[33:39] to the why behind the why behind the why
[33:41] this is the reason why god designated
[33:44] that woman to be under the headship of
[33:45] the male and that is why she cannot wear
[33:47] clothes that pertain to a male or cut
[33:49] her hair
[33:51] we can make it all kinds of other things
[33:53] and argue and fuss about
[33:54] the way it looks and more feminine and
[33:56] and ladylike and all of that but the
[33:58] real reason is because god wanted her
[34:00] under headship and she's not allowed to
[34:02] cut her hair she must have a sign that
[34:04] she's
[34:04] under authority and then she cannot
[34:06] dress like the one she's under
[34:08] god wanted a designation and a
[34:10] distinction between the two
[34:12] he wanted a male expression and he
[34:13] wanted a female expression
[34:15] and that's what he wanted
[34:19] it's not you know the the the you know
[34:22] so many times if your children go to
[34:24] college you know they're going to get
[34:25] bombarded by
[34:26] social norms created by men who were the
[34:28] ruling authority blah blah blah blah
[34:30] blah
[34:31] no it was a carry over some men who
[34:33] really had fundamental faith in what the
[34:35] bible said
[34:36] and we're trying to keep it going in
[34:37] society
[34:40] but it's been perverted now to what was
[34:42] good is now called evil and what is evil
[34:44] is now called good
[34:49] she's not to wear garments that pertain
[34:51] to a male or cut her hair
[34:52] when she does she is intruding into the
[34:55] male domain
[34:56] taking authority and perverting herself
[34:59] and when a woman evades the pulpit which
[35:01] is it is commanded she must not do she
[35:04] shows
[35:04] what spirit she is of being a dominating
[35:07] female is antichrist and the seeds of
[35:10] the roman catholic church are
[35:12] in her though she may deny this ever so
[35:15] vehemently
[35:19] praise god that's nothing but the truth
[35:24] so i'm going to repeat it again so we
[35:25] don't lose it being a dominating female
[35:28] is antichrist so just
[35:31] let's just nail that down and call it
[35:32] for what it is being a dominating female
[35:35] is antichrist because it's anti-word
[35:39] because it's not in the word so it's
[35:41] antichrist because it's anti-word
[35:44] so being a dominating female is
[35:46] antichrist and the seeds of the roman
[35:48] catholic church are
[35:49] in her though she may deny this ever so
[35:52] vehemently
[35:53] you see a dominating female you say the
[35:56] seeds of the catholic church are in you
[35:57] and say i'm not
[35:58] catholic i'm protestant no you're the
[36:00] same spirit the dominating female spirit
[36:02] that has moved the catholic church to it
[36:04] is is now working in you
[36:12] but when it comes to the word let god be
[36:14] true in every man's word a lie
[36:16] amen let us go back to the beginning in
[36:20] the original physical creation as we
[36:22] know it today
[36:23] god made everything in pairs male and
[36:25] female there were two chickens rooster
[36:27] and hen there were two cattle
[36:28] the cow and the bull amen
[36:32] that is so simple i don't know why that
[36:34] has become so complicated but it is so
[36:36] simple
[36:37] that in the original creation god made a
[36:40] rooster and a hen
[36:42] a cow and a bowl a male and a female
[36:46] because that's what god wants amen and
[36:48] to change
[36:49] any of that structure is to change amen
[36:52] what god wanted is to become antichrist
[36:54] and anti-god
[36:57] praise god keep reading
[37:00] there were two cattle the cow on the
[37:02] bull and right down the line but when it
[37:03] come to man there was only one
[37:05] they were not a pair adam had been made
[37:07] in the image of god he was a son of god
[37:09] and as a son of god he could not be
[37:12] tempted and fall
[37:13] that would be impossible so god took a
[37:15] byproduct of man to cause the fall
[37:17] woman never stepped fresh from the hand
[37:19] of god as a true product of god she was
[37:21] a
[37:22] she was produced from man and when god
[37:24] caused her to be brought forth from man
[37:26] she was vastly different from the other
[37:28] females
[37:29] he had created she was able to be
[37:31] seduced
[37:32] no other female in creation can be
[37:33] immoral but the human female be
[37:36] may be touched in almost any time and
[37:39] that weakness in her allowed satan to
[37:41] seduce her
[37:42] by the way of the serpent and has
[37:43] brought the woman to a very peculiar
[37:46] position before god
[37:47] and his word now i want you to catch
[37:50] this
[37:51] and listen i i'm i'm talking about
[37:53] spirits amen
[37:54] those spirits are reflected in male and
[37:56] female that's right brothers and sisters
[37:58] but they're reflected in
[37:59] other things as well brother memory told
[38:02] us they reflected in the catholic church
[38:04] and the protestant churches but let's
[38:06] read this
[38:08] she's in a very peculiar position before
[38:10] god in his word
[38:12] she is the type of all things vulgar
[38:14] fowl and lotham on the one hand
[38:16] and on the other hand she's the type of
[38:18] all things clean and beautiful
[38:19] and holy as the receptacle of the spirit
[38:22] and blessings of god
[38:24] on the one hand she is called the
[38:25] who is drunk with the wine of her
[38:26] fornications
[38:27] on the other she is called the bride of
[38:29] christ
[38:31] amen talk about two drastically
[38:34] different uses for the same
[38:36] vessel it depends on whether we stay
[38:40] with god's word
[38:40] or we leave god's word which one will
[38:43] reflect
[38:44] so she's in a peculiar position on one
[38:47] hand she is called mystery babylon the
[38:49] abomination before god
[38:50] on the other hand she is called new
[38:52] jerusalem our mother
[38:53] on the one hand she is so foul and
[38:55] wicked and lewd that she is summarily
[38:57] cast into the lake of fire
[38:58] as the only fit place for her and on the
[39:01] other hand she is exalted to heaven
[39:03] sharing the very throne of god as the
[39:05] only place befitting such a queen
[39:08] praise be to god which side do you want
[39:10] to be on
[39:12] and in this thyatiran church age she is
[39:14] a dominating female
[39:16] she is a mystery babylon she is the
[39:18] great she is
[39:20] jezebel the false prophetess why because
[39:22] the true female
[39:23] submissive to god christ is her head she
[39:26] has no word but his
[39:27] no thought but his no leadership but his
[39:31] but what about this church she has cast
[39:34] out the word destroyed the bibles and
[39:35] worthy essays of the godly
[39:37] she has slain those who would preach the
[39:39] truth she has taken over kings
[39:40] princes nations countries armies and
[39:43] insist that she is the true
[39:45] body of christ and that her popes are
[39:47] the vicars of christ
[39:49] she is entirely seduced by the devil
[39:52] until she in turn has become the seducer
[39:55] of others
[39:58] she doesn't know she's the great
[40:05] she is the bride of satan and has
[40:07] produced his bastard child
[40:09] religions boy there's some strong
[40:12] language there
[40:14] and i'm glad i can just read the prophet
[40:17] because he says it very straight
[40:20] he's describing the catholic church but
[40:22] but the church is reflected in the women
[40:24] amen the
[40:25] the condition of the nations reflected
[40:27] in the women of the nation condition of
[40:28] a church is reflected in the women of
[40:30] the church
[40:30] amen that's just the way it goes the
[40:32] condition of a family is reflected in
[40:33] the women in the family
[40:35] that's the way it works so god is
[40:38] showing
[40:39] the condition of the catholic church
[40:42] so i want to go to revelation 18
[40:46] and look at revelation 18 for a minute
[40:51] revelation 17 begins to show this image
[40:54] of this
[40:55] riding upon the beast and then it
[40:58] begins to claim
[40:59] her destruction in verse 18 or chapter
[41:02] 18.
[41:03] but i want to pick up 18 verse 4. now
[41:05] remember
[41:06] brother branham told us she is entirely
[41:08] seduced
[41:09] by the devil until she in turn has
[41:11] become the seducer of others
[41:14] eve when eve left the word brother bam
[41:17] said when she left the word she left her
[41:18] mate
[41:20] and when she left the word amen she left
[41:22] the word because she was seduced she
[41:24] didn't leave the word because she wanted
[41:26] to leave the word
[41:27] she left the word because she was
[41:29] seduced
[41:30] she thought she was doing right this is
[41:32] what the prophet explains what she
[41:33] thought she was doing right
[41:34] that's why she took it to adam amen
[41:36] because she thought it was right
[41:38] and this great she thought she was
[41:41] right and thinks that she's right
[41:43] she is totally seduced by the devil and
[41:45] being so she becomes the seducer of
[41:47] others
[41:49] let's read this in verse 4.
[41:54] i heard another voice from heaven saying
[41:56] come out of her my people that you be
[41:58] not partakers of her sins
[41:59] and that you receive none of her plagues
[42:01] for her sins have reached them to heaven
[42:03] and
[42:03] and god has remembered her iniquities
[42:06] reward her
[42:06] even as she rewarded you and double
[42:09] under her double according to her works
[42:11] in the cup which she had filled filled
[42:13] to her double
[42:15] how much she hath glorified herself and
[42:17] lived deliciously
[42:19] so much torment and sorrow give her for
[42:21] she saith in her heart
[42:22] i sit a queen and am no widow and shall
[42:25] see
[42:26] no sorrow what she says in her heart is
[42:30] what she believes to be true
[42:33] and this this woman this false church
[42:36] amen she's she's described to be so
[42:39] wicked and so
[42:40] vile amen and that she's drunk of the
[42:42] wine of her fornication the kings have
[42:44] drunk of the wine of her fornication she
[42:46] is the great
[42:47] i mean she has harlot daughters she is
[42:49] so filthy and so
[42:50] vile in the description that god gives
[42:52] us in his bible
[42:53] but in her heart she says
[42:57] she has glorified herself and lived
[42:59] deliciously so much torment and sorrow
[43:01] give her
[43:01] for she saith in her heart i sit a queen
[43:04] and am no widow
[43:05] and shall see no sorrow she thinks she's
[43:09] the queen of heaven
[43:10] she thinks she's not a widow but she's
[43:12] married to christ
[43:13] and that she will see no sorrow because
[43:14] christ will take care of her
[43:19] how did she get to this place
[43:22] how did she get to this place where she
[43:24] can be so vile and so
[43:26] lose them with such horrible describing
[43:28] words descriptive words that would
[43:30] describe her condition
[43:31] but in her heart amen she believes that
[43:34] she is a queen and no widow and shall
[43:36] see no sorrow
[43:39] she was seduced she is seduced
[43:42] she's thoroughly desedused she thinks
[43:44] she's doing right
[43:45] she thought she was doing right with her
[43:47] decrees and her
[43:48] and her laws and her dogmas and her
[43:50] popes and her priests and
[43:51] and the and the killing everything that
[43:53] comes against it she thought she was
[43:54] doing the work of god all along
[43:57] but she was only glorifying herself she
[44:00] was seduced she was doing the work of
[44:01] the devil
[44:04] i want to turn to revelation chapter two
[44:07] brother branham is in the thyatira
[44:09] church age so i'm going to pick up the
[44:10] thyatira church age here in chapter 2.
[44:13] and he he begins to tell us that
[44:16] the thyatira he gives the definition of
[44:18] thyatira
[44:19] as dominating female and he says that's
[44:21] what she is in this age as the
[44:23] dominating female
[44:24] and we know thyatira expresses the dark
[44:26] ages when the catholic church came to
[44:28] its full power
[44:29] and began such a bitter persecution
[44:31] against the church and
[44:32] almost snuffed out the entire truth
[44:35] but god had preserved a remnant and so
[44:38] she's at the height of her power
[44:40] she's at the height of her authority
[44:44] in her glory in thyatira and he says she
[44:48] is jezebel
[44:49] and so i want to pick this up in
[44:50] revelation chapter 2 verse 18.
[44:54] and unto the angel the church and
[44:56] thyatirite these things saith the son of
[44:58] god
[44:58] who had his eyes like unto a flame of
[45:00] fire and his feet are like fine brass
[45:02] i know thy works and thy charity and
[45:04] service and faith and thy patience
[45:07] and thy works and the last to be more
[45:09] than the first
[45:10] notwithstanding i have a few things
[45:11] against me because thou has suffered
[45:13] that woman jezebel
[45:14] which calleth herself a prophetess to
[45:16] teach and to seduce my
[45:18] servants to commit fornication to eat
[45:20] things
[45:21] sacrifice into idols i gave her space to
[45:24] repent of her fornication and she
[45:25] repented not behold i will cast her into
[45:28] a bed in them that commit adultery with
[45:30] her
[45:31] unto great tribulation except they
[45:33] repent of their deeds
[45:35] so brother branham in reading the
[45:37] thythine church age shows that it's a
[45:38] dominating female
[45:40] and right here in the description of
[45:42] thyatira in the church ages in
[45:44] revelation chapter 2 he begins to
[45:46] describe
[45:47] a jezebel spirit that had come into the
[45:50] church and he had somewhat against them
[45:51] because they allowed that jezebel
[45:54] and so i want to go back and look at
[45:56] jezebel so turn with me to first kings
[45:58] and i just want to take a couple places
[46:00] real quickly and look at jezebel
[46:02] because i want to look at this spirit
[46:04] that's upon jezebel
[46:11] first kings
[46:16] 19.
[46:17] [Music]
[46:24] first kings 19 i'm going to read verse
[46:26] 1.
[46:29] and ahab told jezebel all elijah had
[46:31] done and says after the mount carmel
[46:33] showdown and he had taken in slain 400
[46:36] of the priest of baal and ab told
[46:38] jezebel all that elijah had done
[46:40] and with all how he had slain all the
[46:42] prophets with the sword
[46:43] and then jezebel sent a messenger unto
[46:45] elijah saying so
[46:46] let the gods do to me and more also if i
[46:49] make not thy life as the life of one of
[46:51] them by tomorrow
[46:53] about this time see i want to look at
[46:56] the jezebel spirit
[46:57] and i don't even care about the person
[46:58] jezebel i want to look at the jezebel
[47:00] spirit
[47:01] that had invaded the church and then
[47:03] began to take control of the church
[47:04] and in this jezebel spirit she had her
[47:06] own religion
[47:08] she had brought in the worship of baal
[47:09] mingled it with with the worship of
[47:11] jehovah they were
[47:12] they were they were now worshiping both
[47:14] and elijah comes down and brother
[47:16] branham said
[47:17] elijah was her pastor said she didn't
[47:20] accept it but elijah was her pastor
[47:21] nonetheless
[47:22] so her pastor comes down amen and
[47:24] corrects that thing
[47:26] and what does jezebel want to do she
[47:27] wants to kill the pastor
[47:30] or the prophet brother branham or
[47:32] whoever says it amen what is that that's
[47:34] a rebellious jezebel spirit amen because
[47:36] the spirit of the woman is submissive
[47:39] submissive to the word she's not
[47:41] submissive she wasn't submissive to the
[47:43] word of god
[47:44] she wasn't even submissive to ahab and
[47:46] ahab he was perverted too because he
[47:48] just let her spat off the mouth and
[47:49] never corrected her for that
[47:53] i mean he had just seen the supernatural
[47:55] he knew that what happened had taken
[47:56] place
[47:57] he saw fire come down and lick up all
[47:59] the water and the stones and the
[48:00] sacrifice and all
[48:01] and he would still let her say something
[48:03] like that
[48:04] he was just as perverted as she was
[48:08] now let's go over uh chapter 21 first
[48:11] kings 21.
[48:14] this is when uh ahab wants to nabos ben
[48:17] vineyard and nabath will not give up the
[48:20] lord's inheritance he will not give up
[48:21] his portion of the
[48:23] inheritance of the lord for ahab so ahab
[48:26] is really upset he comes in pouting and
[48:28] whining
[48:29] in in chapter 21 verse 5 we pick up
[48:32] here the reading but jezebel his wife
[48:35] came to him and said unto him
[48:37] why is thy spirit so sad that thou eat
[48:40] is no bread
[48:41] and he said unto her because i spake
[48:43] unto naboth the jezreelite
[48:45] and said unto him give me thy vineyard
[48:47] for money or else if it please thee i
[48:49] will give thee another vineyard for it
[48:51] and he answered i will not give thee my
[48:53] vineyard and jezebel's wife said unto
[48:55] him
[48:56] thust thou now govern the kingdom of
[48:58] israel arise and eat bread
[48:59] and let thine heart be merry i will give
[49:02] thee the vineyard of naboth to
[49:04] jezreelite
[49:06] this is a spirit you know
[49:09] you don't even have to be a churchgoer
[49:11] to know that jezebel's bad
[49:14] right the name jezebel has become such a
[49:17] connotation of a wicked and a lewd and
[49:19] an evil woman
[49:20] amen it's so permeated even our culture
[49:23] that if you call somebody at jezebel you
[49:25] know that's not a compliment
[49:28] and so jezebel here is now taking a
[49:30] position that's not hers
[49:31] she's taking authority now she's going
[49:33] to take the leadership over the man
[49:35] she's going to take the leadership over
[49:37] the king because he's too weak to do it
[49:39] so she's going to step up to the plate
[49:42] and so many times you we find out that
[49:45] that that is so many times what has
[49:46] caused women to move beyond
[49:48] where they're supposed to go is because
[49:49] there was a perverted man who wouldn't
[49:51] take his position
[49:52] amen and a woman felt the need to take
[49:54] to take just to get something done to do
[49:56] something about this
[49:57] but when she made that step even though
[49:59] the man was failing
[50:00] she began to fail it's better to let the
[50:03] whole thing fall apart than to leave
[50:05] your position
[50:07] stay where god put you amen it's better
[50:10] to let the thing go into ruin than to
[50:11] step out of bounds of your position
[50:15] so he was perverted she says do you not
[50:18] govern israel
[50:20] like don't you even know how to handle
[50:22] this let me show you
[50:24] i will give you the vineyard and naboth
[50:27] she's now
[50:28] usurping authority
[50:33] let me continue reading here
[50:36] verse 7 and jezebel's wife said unto him
[50:39] dost thou now govern the kingdom of
[50:40] israel arise and eat bread and let thine
[50:42] heart be merry
[50:43] i will give thee the vineyard of nabath
[50:45] the jezreelite
[50:46] so she wrote letters in ahab's name and
[50:48] sealed them with his seal
[50:50] so she begins to use his name
[50:57] she begins to use his name
[51:00] she's usurping authority she has no
[51:02] right to that ahab's not doing it but
[51:04] she's beginning she's being
[51:06] dinning to take his place this isn't her
[51:08] place but she's taking
[51:09] her his place his name his authority his
[51:12] seal
[51:12] amen and she's going to go and do what
[51:14] he can't do
[51:19] this is dangerous
[51:22] see she i'm going to start back in verse
[51:26] 8 she wrote letters and naham's name and
[51:27] sealed them with his seal
[51:29] and sent the letters into the elders
[51:30] into the nobles that were in his city
[51:32] dwelling with naboth and she wrote in
[51:34] the letter saying proclaim a fast and
[51:36] set nabath on high among the people
[51:38] and set two men sons of below before him
[51:40] to bear witness against him saying
[51:42] thou this blasphemed god and the king
[51:45] and then carry
[51:46] him out and stone him that he may die
[51:49] and the men of this
[51:50] city even the elders and the nobles who
[51:52] were the inhabitants in his city
[51:53] did as jezebel had sent unto them and as
[51:56] it was written in the letters
[51:58] which she had sent unto them
[52:01] she was the one who got it done because
[52:04] ahab couldn't get it done
[52:07] and the whole thing was wicked to begin
[52:09] with
[52:10] i just wanted to read those so you can
[52:11] see the very nature of jezebel
[52:13] and what it is that was so loathsome in
[52:15] the eyes of god he would even use that
[52:18] name over in thyatira to describe the
[52:20] condition of the thyatiran church and
[52:22] what was going on
[52:23] amen it was a it was a hated thing in
[52:25] the eyes of god and it was despised
[52:27] amongst the nation of israel and and
[52:30] brother bam says in questions and
[52:31] answers on genesis he said then
[52:33] god taken from his side a piece of him a
[52:35] rib going back to adam and the woman
[52:37] and made a woman now where did he get
[52:39] the spirit woman
[52:41] genesis 1 26 he said let us make man in
[52:44] our image after our own likeness
[52:47] created he them male male and female man
[52:50] male and female
[52:51] he made the burly spirit for the man he
[52:53] made the tender little delicate feminist
[52:55] spirit for the woman
[52:57] and when you see a woman acting like a
[52:58] man she's got out of her place you see
[53:01] in the beginning see all right she's
[53:03] supposed to i think it's a shame that
[53:05] women has lost their dainty feminist
[53:07] place
[53:07] it's a disgrace i tell you it is
[53:11] in the message you must be born again
[53:12] 1958 he said therefore
[53:14] when a man a woman tries to act like a
[53:16] man dressed like a man talk like a man
[53:18] she's out of her place
[53:19] a woman is finished feminist sweet
[53:22] loving not
[53:22] big and carrying on and acting like a
[53:24] man well she's not supposed to be
[53:27] and when she does that her life is
[53:29] perverted
[53:30] she's sweet loving kind where adam is
[53:32] more the burly type
[53:34] for he was the man the masculine type
[53:36] the woman was feminist
[53:37] but it's the same spirit for he took her
[53:39] from adam
[53:41] now now think about this
[53:45] god when he's going to make man he's
[53:47] going to make the male and female
[53:48] and within the man was male and female
[53:51] but he said it's not good
[53:53] i'm going to help make him a help me
[53:55] he's going to have a helper and that
[53:56] helper was going to come out of him so
[53:58] he's going to take a
[53:58] and he's going to take a portion of the
[54:00] spirit that's in adam and he's going to
[54:02] pull it out and he's going to make the
[54:03] woman
[54:04] and he's going to unite the two back
[54:05] together and say these two are one this
[54:08] is adam
[54:10] but when god was going to make a help
[54:12] for adam he did not make a clone of adam
[54:17] this is what we need to catch it was not
[54:19] a clone of adam
[54:21] god already had this expression within
[54:24] this pressure was male and female
[54:25] but what did he want he wanted another
[54:27] expression of adam the same atom the
[54:30] same spirit
[54:31] but this expression was not a clone
[54:33] expression
[54:34] this was a female expression so it was
[54:37] the same
[54:38] spirit the same thing the same atom
[54:41] in male and in female and this is what
[54:44] god wanted
[54:46] he did not he didn't not want a clone he
[54:48] did not want adam male and male 1
[54:53] he did not to want the woman to act like
[54:55] the male or the male to act like the
[54:57] woman
[54:58] he made a difference and a distinction
[55:00] because in order to help the male
[55:02] he brought out the female spirit and the
[55:04] female spirit is to help the male
[55:06] and together they make up one unit
[55:10] this is god's plan anything contrary to
[55:12] this plan is perverted
[55:17] in the message oneness
[55:21] he said if you'll notice how that eve
[55:23] was united with adam she became part of
[55:25] him
[55:27] did you notice in genesis 1 27 he
[55:29] created man male and female created he
[55:30] them
[55:31] now both male and female when it come to
[55:33] being in the spirit of feminist and
[55:35] masculine
[55:35] then god took from his side a rib did
[55:38] you notice the body part was a byproduct
[55:40] but not the spirit the body part of the
[55:42] woman was a byproduct
[55:43] after the creation had been finished god
[55:45] took from the side of adam a rib made a
[55:47] woman
[55:48] but not the spirit the spirit was part
[55:49] of adam for he was both male and female
[55:52] spiritually speaking both masculine and
[55:54] feminist
[55:55] so it wasn't a different spirit it was
[55:57] the same spirit that's why she was
[56:01] is that right she was adam
[56:04] but she was not a clone of adam
[56:08] she was adam because she was the same
[56:10] spirit that was
[56:11] in adam now expressed in a female
[56:14] expression
[56:15] and that was the female expression of
[56:17] adam and there was also a male
[56:18] expression of adam
[56:19] and when these two came together it was
[56:22] adam
[56:25] so god in his plan the one that he
[56:28] wanted to help
[56:29] amen was not a clone not an identical
[56:33] twin
[56:36] it was a female because god wanted these
[56:39] two things to express his own nature
[56:43] in his own plan that's why for the woman
[56:46] to get out of place is perverted
[56:48] and for the man to get out of place is
[56:49] perverted because we never can have
[56:51] the true image of god unless we have it
[56:53] reflected in male and female
[56:58] so i want to look at lucifer for a
[57:01] minute
[57:02] if we go to isaiah 14 with me
[57:06] i want to read a couple passages of
[57:09] scripture and then some things that
[57:10] brother branham said
[57:14] isaiah 14.
[57:26] isaiah 14 and 12
[57:30] how art thou fallen from heaven and
[57:32] lucifer's son of the morning
[57:34] howarth thou cut down to the ground
[57:36] which did weaken the nations
[57:38] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[57:40] ascend into heaven
[57:42] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[57:44] of god i will sit also upon the mount of
[57:46] congregation
[57:47] in the sides of the north i will ascend
[57:49] above the height of the clouds i will be
[57:51] like
[57:52] the most high. now remember when we read
[57:56] in revelation 18 this church has exalted
[58:00] herself
[58:02] and she says in her heart i am a queen
[58:04] and no widow i will see no sorrow
[58:07] because she is the bride of the devil
[58:09] and the devil said
[58:10] i will i will and he exalted i will be
[58:13] exalted above the stars i will be like
[58:15] the most high
[58:15] i will be i will be i will be amen and
[58:18] what is lucifer doing
[58:19] he is getting out of position
[58:23] is that right let's go over to ezekiel
[58:27] 28.
[58:33] ezekiel 28.
[58:47] ezekiel 28 and verse 11.
[58:50] moreover the word of the lord came unto
[58:52] me saying son of man take up a
[58:54] lamentation upon the king of tyrus
[58:56] and say unto them thus saith the lord
[58:58] god thou sealest up the son
[59:00] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
[59:02] thou has been in eden the garden of god
[59:04] every precious stone was thy covering
[59:06] the sardis topaz the diamond the barrel
[59:08] the onyx the jasper
[59:09] the sapphire the emerald the carbuncle
[59:12] and gold
[59:12] the workmanship of thy tabernacle thy
[59:14] pipes was prepared in thee in the day
[59:16] that that was created thou art the
[59:18] anointed cherub that covereth and i have
[59:20] set thee so
[59:22] so god had given him a position i would
[59:24] say that was a good position
[59:27] that was been upon the holy mountain of
[59:29] god thou has walked up and down in the
[59:31] midst of the stones of fire
[59:32] that was perfect in thy ways from the
[59:34] day that thou was created
[59:36] to iniquity was found in thee by the
[59:39] multitude
[59:40] of thy merchandise they have filled the
[59:42] midst of thee with violence
[59:43] and thou has sinned therefore i will
[59:45] cast thee as profane out of the mountain
[59:46] of god
[59:47] and i will destroy the o covering cherub
[59:49] from the midst of the stones of fire
[59:52] thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[59:53] beauty thou has corrupted
[59:55] thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i
[59:57] will cast it to the ground i will lay
[59:59] thee before kings that they may behold
[1:00:01] thee
[1:00:02] thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the
[1:00:04] multitude of thine iniquity
[1:00:05] by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore
[1:00:07] will i bring forth a fire from the midst
[1:00:09] of thee
[1:00:10] it shall devour thee and i will bring
[1:00:12] thee to ashes upon the earth
[1:00:14] in the sight of all them that behold
[1:00:15] thee all they that know thee among the
[1:00:18] people shall be astonished at thee
[1:00:21] thou shalt be a terror and never shalt
[1:00:23] thou be
[1:00:24] any more brother him says in the seal of
[1:00:28] antichrist from 55 he says the
[1:00:29] right-hand man of almighty god was
[1:00:31] lucifer
[1:00:33] the son of the morning the the first god
[1:00:35] granted him almost co-workers with him
[1:00:37] he was co-worker partly equal with him
[1:00:39] only satan could not create
[1:00:42] so now you know like we're always
[1:00:45] looking at the why behind the why behind
[1:00:47] the why
[1:00:48] but really what happened in eden was a
[1:00:50] reflection of what had happened in
[1:00:52] heaven
[1:00:54] because god he had created lucifer and
[1:00:57] lucifer
[1:00:58] was his right-hand man lucifer was to be
[1:01:01] his helper his
[1:01:02] his his co-worker brother banham said
[1:01:05] and he set him as a covering chair right
[1:01:07] next to him
[1:01:10] and that's a good position but lucifer
[1:01:13] wasn't satisfied with his position
[1:01:16] he wanted to take god's position
[1:01:19] he wanted to be like the most high god
[1:01:21] amen
[1:01:22] and so now he begins to move out of the
[1:01:24] god-given position that god gave him
[1:01:26] a man and he wants to be like god
[1:01:29] brother ben says in the in the message
[1:01:31] of marriage and divorce he said now
[1:01:32] it was then man was made to rule over
[1:01:34] the woman by god's word she was no more
[1:01:36] co-equal with him
[1:01:38] she was co-equal in nature you know but
[1:01:40] when she
[1:01:41] broke god's word god made made a man to
[1:01:44] be a ruler over her
[1:01:45] genesis 3 16 if you want to put it down
[1:01:48] she was no more equal with the man she
[1:01:50] was the breaker of god's word
[1:01:52] don't you see she the church down here
[1:01:55] the breaker of god's word
[1:01:56] that throwed her completely out of
[1:01:58] continuity and that's what the church
[1:02:00] has done and throwed spiritual death
[1:02:02] upon the whole thing
[1:02:03] now you'll understand why i hammer at
[1:02:05] these things like i do
[1:02:06] it's truth this is the bible facts
[1:02:08] notice
[1:02:09] why did she do such a thing as this how
[1:02:11] could that lovely beautiful perfect
[1:02:13] woman
[1:02:14] notice why did she do such a thing being
[1:02:16] in that high order
[1:02:18] she was right with man co-equal with him
[1:02:20] but we all know now
[1:02:21] that she lost her co-equalness with man
[1:02:23] when she sinned
[1:02:24] and god said man will be your ruler from
[1:02:27] here out
[1:02:28] now that's the scripture if you want to
[1:02:30] we could read it i'm giving you the
[1:02:31] scripture so save time for this big
[1:02:33] hookup across the country that you might
[1:02:35] read it yourself
[1:02:36] notice the reason she did that how did
[1:02:38] satan ever get to her
[1:02:39] now listen the way he says did you know
[1:02:42] satan was co-equal with god
[1:02:44] one day he's talking about what was
[1:02:46] happening in the garden
[1:02:48] and she was co-equal with the man only
[1:02:50] she was the female he was the male
[1:02:52] amen and and she she broke that
[1:02:56] continuity by leaving the word and now
[1:02:58] she was put subject underneath the man
[1:03:00] but he says now notice the reason she
[1:03:03] did that how did satan ever get to her
[1:03:05] did you know satan was co-equal with god
[1:03:07] one day sure was
[1:03:09] all but a creator he was everything
[1:03:11] stood at the right hand of god in the
[1:03:13] heavens the great leading cherubim
[1:03:16] what happened he was a helper to god he
[1:03:19] was a co-worker with god is that what
[1:03:20] the brother brahm says
[1:03:23] but he left his position he left the
[1:03:25] word and he wanted the
[1:03:26] he wanted to be be like god amen he
[1:03:29] wanted to take god's position
[1:03:31] and it brought an absolute chaos in ruin
[1:03:34] in heaven
[1:03:35] and then it come down to earth and the
[1:03:37] war that started in heaven amen come
[1:03:39] down to the garden of eden and spilled
[1:03:41] out in man amen she was
[1:03:43] made amen she was made the helper the
[1:03:45] help meet of adam the man
[1:03:47] she was part of him the same spirit of
[1:03:49] him in the expression of female
[1:03:51] they were together co-equal partners in
[1:03:54] dominion over the earth
[1:03:55] amen but but she was reaching for
[1:03:58] something more than what was given to
[1:04:00] her
[1:04:01] amen and brought ruin to the whole thing
[1:04:05] who did it the helper who did it in
[1:04:07] heaven the helper
[1:04:08] who did it on earth the helper that's
[1:04:11] why when i talk about
[1:04:12] a dominating female spirit i'm not just
[1:04:14] talking about men and women i'm talking
[1:04:15] about a spirit
[1:04:17] that is not satisfied being the helper
[1:04:20] being the reflection
[1:04:21] being the feminine amen but wants to be
[1:04:23] like the one she was taken out of wants
[1:04:25] to be like the one who created her
[1:04:27] wants to be more than her position and
[1:04:30] that's what happens in men in the world
[1:04:32] when the woman is not satisfying her
[1:04:34] position or a man's not satisfied in
[1:04:35] their position
[1:04:36] it brings chaos in families it brings
[1:04:38] chaos and culture it brings
[1:04:40] chaos in our nation because people are
[1:04:42] not
[1:04:43] happy amen that's why they want to
[1:04:44] self-identify their own gender they're
[1:04:46] not
[1:04:47] they don't want what god wanted they
[1:04:49] want what they want
[1:04:54] i can't think of anything uh i can think
[1:04:57] of many things i guess but
[1:04:59] one of the most uh shameful things
[1:05:03] is to deny the very god who created you
[1:05:05] and gives you life
[1:05:09] and treat yourself like your god
[1:05:12] i can determine my gender since when
[1:05:17] i can determine my sexual preference
[1:05:19] since when
[1:05:22] it's not right it's a rebuke in the face
[1:05:25] of god
[1:05:28] he goes on to say in the god of this
[1:05:30] evil age
[1:05:31] notice what he will do his thoughts he
[1:05:35] thought god dwelt in worldly beauty
[1:05:37] he did that in heaven sin never began in
[1:05:39] the garden of eden it began in heaven
[1:05:40] when lucifer the son of the morning
[1:05:42] exalted himself in beauty and wanted a
[1:05:43] more beautiful kingdom
[1:05:45] than that of michael and he thought that
[1:05:47] god dwelt in beauty
[1:05:49] see lucifer was deceived himself
[1:05:52] the woman was deceived and the catholic
[1:05:54] church is deceived and the protestant
[1:05:56] church is sade
[1:05:57] deceived they're deceived but they're
[1:05:59] reaching beyond the bounds god gave them
[1:06:01] and trying to take something
[1:06:02] a position that god didn't put them in
[1:06:04] and they were deceived thinking it was
[1:06:05] good thinking he was right
[1:06:06] and god dwelt in beauty
[1:06:10] 1959 questions and answers now let's
[1:06:12] turn to the new testament to luke 10 18
[1:06:14] just a minute and see that jesus said
[1:06:16] in the book of luke you that have your
[1:06:18] bibles now that's trying to get on those
[1:06:20] questions luke 10 18.
[1:06:22] and he said unto them jesus speaking i
[1:06:24] beheld satan as lightning falling from
[1:06:25] heaven
[1:06:26] see satan was the original archangel of
[1:06:28] god he once dwelt in the heaven he once
[1:06:30] was the great person in the heavens
[1:06:32] outside of god
[1:06:33] he was god's right hand man to
[1:06:35] fellowship and he got puffed up in his
[1:06:37] heart
[1:06:39] 1959 questions and answers says now as i
[1:06:42] just got
[1:06:42] to basing up to this that lucifer in
[1:06:45] heaven
[1:06:46] tried to exalt himself even be just a
[1:06:48] little higher
[1:06:49] than his boss
[1:06:54] you know i said there's a dominating
[1:06:56] female spirit that spirit can show up
[1:06:58] all over the place
[1:06:59] but you find sometimes even in the
[1:07:01] workplace that shows up
[1:07:03] and unions are guilty of this
[1:07:06] unions become the dominating female
[1:07:08] spirit because they want to dictate to
[1:07:10] the boss
[1:07:11] what you can and can't do and what we
[1:07:12] will and won't do
[1:07:15] remember the bible calls the one paying
[1:07:17] the money the master and the one doing
[1:07:19] the work the servant
[1:07:21] that's the bible the one paying the
[1:07:24] money
[1:07:24] for work is the master and the one
[1:07:26] receiving money for work
[1:07:28] is the servant in the scriptures but see
[1:07:31] that spirit invades everything
[1:07:32] and it comes into politics it comes into
[1:07:34] schools now teachers have no more
[1:07:36] authority the kids have more rights in
[1:07:38] school than a teacher does
[1:07:41] and the principle amen and the school
[1:07:43] board and the parents all take up for
[1:07:45] the kids
[1:07:47] not the poor teachers because it's the
[1:07:50] spirit that's evaded our culture
[1:07:52] and permeated everything when they band
[1:07:55] together for a union and say we won't do
[1:07:57] this and we won't do that
[1:07:58] you know i i'm glad that i never was in
[1:08:01] management at a union shop because i
[1:08:02] wouldn't have lasted very long
[1:08:05] because i said where do you get that
[1:08:06] paycheck and where does that money come
[1:08:08] from
[1:08:11] see it's a rebellion against authority
[1:08:15] but that's the age that we live in so
[1:08:18] lucifer in heaven
[1:08:19] he was he was a co-worker with god he
[1:08:21] was a helper to god
[1:08:22] he was a covering cherub amen he was
[1:08:25] brother ben said he was the great one in
[1:08:27] heaven besides god
[1:08:28] amen but he wasn't satisfied with the
[1:08:30] position he wanted something more
[1:08:32] and when he wanted something more he
[1:08:33] brought he broke the continuity of god
[1:08:37] and he ruined what was going on in
[1:08:39] heaven
[1:08:40] and eve when she she was given a
[1:08:42] position amen but
[1:08:44] but when she was by seduction it wasn't
[1:08:46] by it wasn't by
[1:08:48] a desire to be wrong it was a desire to
[1:08:49] be right but she was seduced
[1:08:51] and then she was seduced when she began
[1:08:53] to act independently of the male
[1:08:57] the devil came along and and he began to
[1:09:00] talk to her and say
[1:09:01] you know uh uh uh uh is it
[1:09:04] did god say yea hath god said you shall
[1:09:07] not eat of every tree and she says yay
[1:09:08] he said we shall uh uh not eat of the
[1:09:11] eat of all the trees but of this tree we
[1:09:13] shall not even touch it
[1:09:14] and and he begins to seduce her he
[1:09:16] begins to speak to her amen and then
[1:09:18] without the male just the female
[1:09:20] expression of adam
[1:09:21] amen independent from the male see god
[1:09:24] wanted them together to be one but now
[1:09:26] she's here working independent of the
[1:09:28] male
[1:09:30] and when she's independent of the male
[1:09:32] she begins to listen to the serpent
[1:09:34] and he begins to say you know god does
[1:09:37] know that when you eat this you'll be
[1:09:38] like god's knowing good and evil
[1:09:41] now she had a position and she had a
[1:09:43] place but when he began to entice her
[1:09:46] with something more she was seduced and
[1:09:49] enticed by
[1:09:50] wanting to reach for something more than
[1:09:52] what she had
[1:09:54] and she was not with the male she was
[1:09:57] separate from the male
[1:09:58] and she begins to have this conversation
[1:10:01] and she begins to reason
[1:10:02] without the influence of the male
[1:10:07] how do you think the catholic church got
[1:10:08] off in the beginning amen she was
[1:10:10] seduced with something and began to
[1:10:12] reason without the influence of the male
[1:10:15] independent from the mail the devil
[1:10:17] comes along this is what he always does
[1:10:20] i mean even the devil in heaven he
[1:10:21] begins to deceive angels
[1:10:23] i don't know what story he told them or
[1:10:25] what he was talking to them but if those
[1:10:26] angels would have went
[1:10:27] back and asked god amen they might have
[1:10:29] got a different story
[1:10:33] so now she she now in her own wisdom in
[1:10:37] her own brightness
[1:10:38] you see it's a repeat of the same story
[1:10:40] that's in heaven
[1:10:41] in her own wisdom and her own reasoning
[1:10:44] she begins with her own eyes to look at
[1:10:46] the tree
[1:10:46] and begins to make judgments based off
[1:10:48] the tree all by
[1:10:50] herself she saw that it was good
[1:10:54] pleasant to the eyes a tree to be
[1:10:58] desired to make one wise
[1:10:59] and a tree that was good for food she
[1:11:02] is independent of the male by herself
[1:11:06] judging this tree and she is
[1:11:12] totally completely deceived
[1:11:19] and this is where she
[1:11:23] has something now she wants to give to
[1:11:26] adam
[1:11:28] now she's the one with something to give
[1:11:31] to adam
[1:11:33] instead of adam taking her through the
[1:11:34] garden and saying this
[1:11:36] is how this happened and this is what
[1:11:37] father god told me and this is what i
[1:11:39] named this and what i named that
[1:11:40] now she's got something she can give
[1:11:43] adam
[1:11:46] and it brought death it brought death
[1:11:51] she was supposed to be united they were
[1:11:54] supposed to be one
[1:11:56] and if they had faced that trial
[1:11:57] together it would have been a different
[1:11:59] story
[1:12:01] let's read out of the pergament church
[1:12:03] age from the church age book he says
[1:12:05] this is when he was told to pick up your
[1:12:06] pen and and pick up your pen and write
[1:12:08] so he's just picking up his pen and he's
[1:12:10] writing he said from a little group of
[1:12:12] the true seed of the word
[1:12:13] god will present christ with a beloved
[1:12:15] bride she is a virgin of his word
[1:12:17] she is virgin because she knows no man
[1:12:19] made creeds or dogmas
[1:12:21] by and through the members of the bride
[1:12:22] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[1:12:24] of god to be made manifest
[1:12:26] in the virgin so now we know that god
[1:12:29] has a manifestation he wants to manifest
[1:12:31] part of the word
[1:12:32] that part pertains to the virgin so this
[1:12:35] is a
[1:12:36] a woman expression a female expression
[1:12:39] the word of promise came to the virgin
[1:12:40] mary but the word of promise was he
[1:12:42] himself
[1:12:43] to be made manifest god was made
[1:12:45] manifest he himself acted at that time
[1:12:48] and fulfilled his own word of promise in
[1:12:50] the virgin
[1:12:51] it was an angel that had brought her the
[1:12:52] message but the angel's message was the
[1:12:54] word of god isaiah 9
[1:12:56] 6. he fulfilled at that time all that
[1:12:59] was written of him because she accepted
[1:13:01] his word to her
[1:13:02] the members of the virgin bride will
[1:13:04] love him and they will have his
[1:13:06] potentials for he is their head
[1:13:08] for he is their head and all power
[1:13:10] belongs to him
[1:13:11] they are subject to him as the members
[1:13:13] of our body are subject to our heads
[1:13:16] now he's showing the relationship
[1:13:18] between christ the husband the
[1:13:19] bridegroom and the bride
[1:13:20] he's showing this relationship now she
[1:13:23] is a further expression of christ amen
[1:13:26] and she is uh the expression of the
[1:13:29] virgin and all that would be done in the
[1:13:30] virgin will be done in her
[1:13:32] they they the members of the virgin
[1:13:35] bride will love him
[1:13:36] they will have his potentials for he is
[1:13:38] their head
[1:13:39] and all power belongs to him they are
[1:13:42] subject to him as the members of our
[1:13:43] bodies are subject to our heads notice
[1:13:46] the harmony of the father and the son
[1:13:47] jesus never did
[1:13:48] anything until it was first showed him
[1:13:50] by the father
[1:13:52] catch this harmony catch what he's
[1:13:54] telling us
[1:13:55] jesus never acted independent of the
[1:13:58] father
[1:14:01] john john 5 19 this harmony is now to
[1:14:06] exist between the groom
[1:14:07] and his bride so the harmony between
[1:14:11] jesus and the father is the same harmony
[1:14:13] that exists between the groom and the
[1:14:15] bride
[1:14:16] amen jesus never did anything on his own
[1:14:19] he said i only do that which the father
[1:14:21] shows me
[1:14:22] jesus who was god was emmanuel was god
[1:14:25] made flesh
[1:14:26] he never worked independently of his
[1:14:29] father
[1:14:29] amen he worked in harmony with his
[1:14:31] father because if he worked
[1:14:33] independently he would have went
[1:14:34] off amen but he stayed true to god
[1:14:38] and he straight to his expression i want
[1:14:40] to get to that in a minute
[1:14:44] and this harmony is now to exist between
[1:14:46] the groom and his bride
[1:14:47] he shows her his word of life she
[1:14:49] receives it she never doubts it
[1:14:51] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:14:52] death
[1:14:53] for if the seed be planted the water
[1:14:55] will raise it up again
[1:14:56] here is the secret of this the word is
[1:14:58] in the bride as it was in mary
[1:15:01] the bride has the mind of christ for she
[1:15:03] knows what he wants done with the word
[1:15:04] she performs the command of the word in
[1:15:06] his name for she has thus saith the lord
[1:15:09] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:15:11] it comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:15:13] planted
[1:15:13] and watered it comes to full harvest
[1:15:16] serving its purpose
[1:15:18] those in the bride do only his will no
[1:15:20] one can make them do otherwise
[1:15:22] she will not be like eve
[1:15:26] she will not be like the catholic church
[1:15:28] she will not be like the churches
[1:15:30] because christ our headship is come amen
[1:15:32] and she will not do anything without the
[1:15:34] headship of christ which is the word
[1:15:36] and the word has been restored in this
[1:15:38] day through a prophet and she will not
[1:15:40] move outside of that headship amen to
[1:15:43] declare her own thing
[1:15:46] praise be to god he says now
[1:15:51] those in the bride do only as well no
[1:15:53] one can make them do otherwise
[1:15:55] they have thus saith the lord or they
[1:15:57] keep still they know that it has to be
[1:15:59] god in them doing the works fulfilling
[1:16:01] his own word
[1:16:02] it has to be who doing what
[1:16:05] it has to be who doing what it has to be
[1:16:08] him amen
[1:16:09] they know that it has to be god in them
[1:16:11] doing the works
[1:16:12] fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:16:15] complete all his work while in his
[1:16:16] earthly ministry so now
[1:16:17] he works in and through the bride
[1:16:21] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:16:23] for him to do certain things that he
[1:16:25] must now do
[1:16:26] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:16:27] bride that work which he left for this
[1:16:29] specific time
[1:16:32] praise be to god he's showing the
[1:16:36] position
[1:16:36] of the bride in this day amen is the
[1:16:39] position of the virgin
[1:16:40] and the headship will come the word will
[1:16:42] come and it has to be
[1:16:43] him working through her amen it's not
[1:16:46] her works because mary could not produce
[1:16:48] anything mary was mary was the
[1:16:51] fulfillment of the word she was the
[1:16:53] manifestation of the written word
[1:16:55] because isaiah had prophesied a virgin
[1:16:57] shall conceive and here comes mary
[1:16:59] and mary is the fulfillment of that word
[1:17:02] but mary has no
[1:17:03] power to bring that word to pass
[1:17:07] amen she cannot make it happen although
[1:17:10] she's ordained amen she's the one god
[1:17:12] has chosen
[1:17:12] she's the ordained vessel that god is
[1:17:14] going to produce his word through
[1:17:16] she is the virgin she is the woman she
[1:17:19] is the expression amen to express that
[1:17:21] part of that word amen but she cannot do
[1:17:23] it independently of the male
[1:17:27] she cannot leave the mouth she cannot go
[1:17:29] off on her own amen she has to wait
[1:17:31] until the male comes to her and when he
[1:17:33] comes to her through an angel messenger
[1:17:35] he tells her the time and the word
[1:17:37] and she accepts it and when she accepts
[1:17:39] it he comes and performs his word in her
[1:17:45] see eve got ahead of god's program amen
[1:17:48] amen
[1:17:48] eve she she wanted to do right she
[1:17:51] wanted but she went
[1:17:52] independently of the male trying to do
[1:17:54] right amen she was supposed to be united
[1:17:57] with her adam
[1:17:59] amen and every church that has failed
[1:18:02] has venture off
[1:18:03] independently of a male and when she
[1:18:04] becomes independent she seduced
[1:18:06] not none none of these churches fell
[1:18:08] because they wanted to become bad
[1:18:10] churches amen the catholic church didn't
[1:18:11] fail
[1:18:12] because it wanted to become a bad church
[1:18:13] it was seduced but when it left the
[1:18:15] headship of the male
[1:18:16] amen now they begin to use their own
[1:18:19] reasoning now
[1:18:20] she's separated and independent from the
[1:18:22] male
[1:18:23] and now she's making her choices based
[1:18:25] off reasoning and eyesight and intellect
[1:18:29] and deception comes in and chaos comes
[1:18:31] in behind it
[1:18:32] that's why a dominating female is a
[1:18:35] curse the greatest curse in the world
[1:18:38] because she's supposed to be submissive
[1:18:40] because the church is supposed to be
[1:18:41] submissive to her headship which is
[1:18:43] christ
[1:18:44] which is the word so the expression
[1:18:47] that god wanted in mary the expression
[1:18:50] that he was looking for
[1:18:52] was not somebody who could go and do
[1:18:54] something
[1:18:55] that's not what he wanted in mary the
[1:18:57] expression that he wanted in the virgin
[1:18:59] is somebody that he could come to and
[1:19:01] work in and work through
[1:19:02] somebody who would accept his word
[1:19:04] believe it and say be it unto me
[1:19:06] according to thy word
[1:19:07] he was looking for submission he was
[1:19:09] looking for surrender
[1:19:10] he wasn't looking for mary's ability
[1:19:13] because mary had no ability and today
[1:19:16] he's not looking for his bride to do
[1:19:17] anything that he's promised to do he's
[1:19:19] looking for a bride that will say
[1:19:21] that's nothing but the truth and i
[1:19:22] surrender to it
[1:19:24] because they know it has to be him in
[1:19:27] them doing the works
[1:19:29] he didn't complete them in his earthly
[1:19:30] journey he left them now to do in and
[1:19:32] through the bride
[1:19:33] but it has to be him doing them not her
[1:19:35] doing them the only thing she can do is
[1:19:37] surrender to him and when she surrenders
[1:19:39] to him it'll be him doing it
[1:19:44] every church failed when they thought
[1:19:46] they had to do something
[1:19:51] every time i failed is when i thought i
[1:19:53] had to do something
[1:19:57] in the invisible union of the bride of
[1:19:59] christ said but you remember
[1:20:01] when it went down and the grain began to
[1:20:03] ripen that you find before that grain
[1:20:05] can ripen
[1:20:06] everything in that stalk has to be dead
[1:20:08] hallelujah
[1:20:09] can't you see where we're standing life
[1:20:11] is in the grain again
[1:20:12] what is it just exactly the same grain
[1:20:16] that went into the ground
[1:20:17] the same jesus in bride form
[1:20:21] this is what i want to emphasize on the
[1:20:23] same jesus
[1:20:25] in what kind of expression
[1:20:28] it's the same jesus in bride form
[1:20:32] same power same church same thing
[1:20:36] same word same word sucked up through
[1:20:38] these and came out here
[1:20:39] and came to the head here now remember
[1:20:42] we go all the way back to the garden of
[1:20:43] eden
[1:20:44] when god wanted to create a helper for
[1:20:46] adam and we wanted to further his
[1:20:48] program
[1:20:49] and further reveal himself amen he would
[1:20:51] bring out of adam
[1:20:52] the female the feminist spirit amen and
[1:20:55] he would bring them back together and
[1:20:56] unite them as one and this was god's
[1:20:58] program
[1:20:58] but remember i said he didn't make a
[1:21:00] clone
[1:21:02] she was adam she was the same thing adam
[1:21:05] was
[1:21:06] she was flesh of his flesh and bone of
[1:21:07] his bone but she
[1:21:09] looked different
[1:21:12] anatomically she looked different
[1:21:14] because god
[1:21:15] wanted her to portray another revelation
[1:21:18] another manifestation of what
[1:21:20] adam is does that make sense
[1:21:25] adam and him was male and female amen
[1:21:28] and he
[1:21:28] he looked the part of male but he was
[1:21:30] male and female as one but god when he
[1:21:32] brought
[1:21:32] out the female did not create a clone
[1:21:36] did not create a picture match amen he
[1:21:39] gave the expression he wanted to this
[1:21:41] portion of the spirit that he pulled out
[1:21:43] and that expression was female
[1:21:44] amen in the day we live in it's jesus
[1:21:47] christ amen
[1:21:48] it's christ christ is here but what form
[1:21:51] is he
[1:21:51] in he's here in the form of his bride
[1:21:54] the feminine expression of christ
[1:21:58] and what is the characteristics of the
[1:22:00] feminine expression
[1:22:01] dainty sweet kind loving
[1:22:04] submissive honoring amen yielding
[1:22:08] reverent submissive to her husband
[1:22:14] 1965 i've heard but now i see
[1:22:18] now everybody knows that we have a
[1:22:19] promise of the church condition in the
[1:22:21] last day
[1:22:22] the church in its present condition can
[1:22:23] never fulfill the commandment of god
[1:22:25] the great commission can never call the
[1:22:27] bride out which one would do it the
[1:22:29] pentecostals
[1:22:30] i should say not none of the rest of
[1:22:32] them that's that's
[1:22:33] the shock that's on the wheat that come
[1:22:35] out look just exactly like the wheat
[1:22:37] but there was no wheat to it it opens up
[1:22:39] but the grain comes out of that
[1:22:41] they organize they kill themselves
[1:22:43] that's where they die
[1:22:44] their stalks but the wheat has come up
[1:22:47] through there and now it's begin to form
[1:22:50] in the bride form so it's the same life
[1:22:53] that was in jesus christ
[1:22:55] only it was in the bridegroom form now
[1:22:57] that same life has come
[1:22:58] up as an expression in the bride form
[1:23:03] the corner wheat that fell on the ground
[1:23:05] through the dark ages it had to die
[1:23:07] he says in things that are to be in 1965
[1:23:10] now if we are those attributes of god we
[1:23:12] cannot live by creeds
[1:23:13] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[1:23:15] must live by the word
[1:23:17] because the bride is part of the
[1:23:18] bridegroom
[1:23:20] like any wife is part of her husband
[1:23:22] therefore we must be the word bride
[1:23:24] in what is the word bride the
[1:23:26] manifestation of this
[1:23:28] hour the bride not a creator or a name
[1:23:30] denomination
[1:23:31] but a living oracle of god a living
[1:23:33] attribute of god
[1:23:34] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:23:37] of god
[1:23:38] and the formation of the bride that's to
[1:23:40] be expressed in this
[1:23:42] hour that we're now living what is
[1:23:45] what what is the manifestation i'll go
[1:23:48] backwards what is the manifestation of
[1:23:49] this hour
[1:23:50] the word bride the word bride what is
[1:23:53] she
[1:23:54] she what is the word bride amen the
[1:23:56] manifestation of this hour the bride
[1:23:58] not creed not the nomination but a
[1:24:01] living oracle of god
[1:24:02] a living attribute of god displaying to
[1:24:05] the world
[1:24:06] amen god wants to display this to the
[1:24:08] world
[1:24:10] this is an expression god wants to
[1:24:12] express
[1:24:13] to the world he wants to display to the
[1:24:15] world
[1:24:16] the attributes of god in the formation
[1:24:19] of the bride
[1:24:19] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:24:21] we're now living
[1:24:24] oh i think that's so important i think
[1:24:27] it's so important because
[1:24:29] because if we're not careful amen we try
[1:24:32] to go back and replicate another
[1:24:34] expression
[1:24:34] but that's not the expression for this
[1:24:36] hour the expression for this hour is
[1:24:38] christ in bride form amen
[1:24:41] there was a male and female expressed in
[1:24:43] adam but there come an
[1:24:44] hour there come a time then he wanted
[1:24:46] adam expressed in female form in bride
[1:24:49] form
[1:24:50] so he pulled he laid adam down pulled a
[1:24:52] rib out took part of his spirit
[1:24:54] amen he created the woman because he
[1:24:56] wanted that expression in that
[1:24:58] hour amen and then the crowning act of
[1:25:00] creation is when he brought those two
[1:25:02] together to be unified as one
[1:25:04] but when they come together to be one
[1:25:06] amen that didn't mean
[1:25:08] that the woman amen would ever change to
[1:25:11] the male
[1:25:11] or the male would ever change to the
[1:25:13] woman but you had an expression of male
[1:25:15] and an expression of female and those
[1:25:17] two together make the image
[1:25:20] and god has done the same thing down
[1:25:22] through time amen he has brought up
[1:25:24] his first son failed
[1:25:28] his first created son upon the earth
[1:25:30] failed adam failed amen adam failed to
[1:25:33] keep the word
[1:25:34] that what brother bim said and he was
[1:25:36] only expressing christ to go out with
[1:25:38] his wife amen to save his wife
[1:25:40] but he failed so god started rebuilding
[1:25:43] the image amen because what he had built
[1:25:44] the first time was his masterpiece
[1:25:46] was his great work was the great thing
[1:25:48] that was holding in his mind
[1:25:51] and that masterpiece was ruined amen
[1:25:54] because the woman acted independently of
[1:25:56] the man
[1:25:57] and was seduced but god goes to bring it
[1:26:01] back
[1:26:01] amen and where the male had felt fallen
[1:26:03] god was going to bring back a male that
[1:26:05] wouldn't fall
[1:26:08] is that true where the male had fallen
[1:26:11] now he goes to work through the apostles
[1:26:13] to the patriarchs the apostles and the
[1:26:14] prophets
[1:26:15] and he begins to build back what's he
[1:26:16] doing he's bringing back a son of god on
[1:26:19] the earth that won't fall
[1:26:22] and he come to jesus christ the perfect
[1:26:24] expression of that son
[1:26:25] amen and when he come as an expression
[1:26:27] of that son he was the expression of the
[1:26:30] son
[1:26:31] that's why when he was here the bible
[1:26:34] tells us he was immanuel
[1:26:36] god with us is that right he said my
[1:26:39] father and i are one
[1:26:40] amen he knew that it was god in him and
[1:26:42] brother man said all that god was
[1:26:44] he poured into christ what was it it was
[1:26:47] god
[1:26:47] in the form of a son is that right
[1:26:50] do we believe that it was god in the
[1:26:52] form of his son in the form of jesus
[1:26:54] christ
[1:26:55] it was god expressing through the sun
[1:26:57] but that sun
[1:26:58] would would express the sun
[1:27:02] he would not express the father
[1:27:06] he would pray to the father
[1:27:09] you understand that i hope you
[1:27:10] understand what i'm saying he
[1:27:12] he was he was here for a specific
[1:27:14] purpose and then that purpose was to
[1:27:16] express
[1:27:16] the sun the sun that would have dominion
[1:27:18] on the earth the sun that would not fall
[1:27:20] from the word amen the perfect son it
[1:27:23] was god in him
[1:27:24] amen but his expression his expression
[1:27:27] was not the expression of father
[1:27:29] the expression at that time was the
[1:27:30] expression of son
[1:27:33] that's why he said i only do that which
[1:27:34] the father shows me i'm in total
[1:27:36] submission to the father
[1:27:37] amen i don't do the works it's the
[1:27:39] father in me that do it amen what's he
[1:27:41] doing
[1:27:41] he he he is the father in flesh but he's
[1:27:44] expressing sun
[1:27:45] everything he says express sun the way
[1:27:47] he acts expressed sun
[1:27:49] everything about him is expressing sun
[1:27:53] and in that expression of sun he's got
[1:27:55] to be the good son because adam fell
[1:27:58] from that place
[1:27:58] so now he's got to restore back that
[1:28:00] sonship and in order to do it he's got
[1:28:03] to be the faithful son that always obeys
[1:28:05] the father
[1:28:08] amen that's why he would say
[1:28:11] i pray to the father that's why you'd be
[1:28:15] in the garden of gethsemane
[1:28:17] saying father let this cup pass from me
[1:28:22] but i thought he was god in flesh why
[1:28:23] didn't you speak and speak and speak
[1:28:25] he was expressing son and he was totally
[1:28:27] submissive to the will of the father
[1:28:30] he could not take the expression of
[1:28:32] father
[1:28:33] because it was time for the
[1:28:34] manifestation of son
[1:28:38] do we understand that i'm sure i'm doing
[1:28:41] a lousy job of expressing it but i pray
[1:28:43] the holy ghost quickens it to you
[1:28:47] and so now out of that expression of sun
[1:28:51] there's male and female in there but
[1:28:54] he wants the son to have a bride amen
[1:28:58] god wants an expression of female
[1:29:01] that's what he did in the beginning
[1:29:02] that's what fell that's what he's doing
[1:29:04] again he wants an expression of female
[1:29:07] so in order to have an expression of
[1:29:09] female he takes
[1:29:11] amen the spirit from the son amen and
[1:29:13] now he's bringing about the female which
[1:29:15] is the church
[1:29:18] and that church is to be the expression
[1:29:21] of
[1:29:22] female the virgin to the word
[1:29:25] all that was promised of the virgin
[1:29:28] shall be manifest in her
[1:29:29] amen supposed to be jesus christ in the
[1:29:32] formation of the bride
[1:29:33] the expression of bride the expression
[1:29:35] of wife
[1:29:38] he was faithful inspiration of son amen
[1:29:41] but now it's her time to be it's who is
[1:29:44] it
[1:29:44] it's jesus christ in the form of the
[1:29:47] bride
[1:29:48] is it god it's god it's the attributes
[1:29:51] of god
[1:29:51] every attribute of god is a part of god
[1:29:53] but god has
[1:29:54] attributes for expressions in certain
[1:29:56] times and certain seasons
[1:29:58] in certain ways amen and it's all god
[1:30:00] amen but the attributes god wants
[1:30:02] display today
[1:30:03] are the attributes of wife the
[1:30:05] attributes of bride
[1:30:06] the attributes of submission to headship
[1:30:09] meekness and quietness and gentleness
[1:30:15] praise be to god and when that
[1:30:18] expression
[1:30:20] begins to act independent of the
[1:30:22] headship of the word
[1:30:23] amen it's going to happen what's what's
[1:30:25] always happened will happen again
[1:30:27] amen god tried to have this bride all
[1:30:29] the way back when he brought
[1:30:31] israel out of egypt he was bringing them
[1:30:33] as a bride to him to mary
[1:30:35] on mount sinai but they fell by
[1:30:37] disbelieving the word by leaving the
[1:30:39] word
[1:30:40] amen and he could not marry that one she
[1:30:43] failed to be the right
[1:30:44] expression of bride and could not come
[1:30:46] into the union
[1:30:47] then he started over again in the first
[1:30:49] church of the church of pentecost
[1:30:51] and that church of pentecost amen they
[1:30:53] moved away from their headship
[1:30:55] and began independently in their form of
[1:30:58] bride
[1:30:58] begin to make their own decisions and
[1:31:00] take their own headship
[1:31:03] and when they did she was no longer
[1:31:05] suitable for the expression of bride
[1:31:07] amen and she was put away is that what
[1:31:10] brother brown tells us
[1:31:12] but he's prophesied and promised that in
[1:31:14] the end time there will be a bride
[1:31:16] without spot or wrinkle
[1:31:17] there will be a union there will be a
[1:31:19] bride who will not take her own headship
[1:31:21] will not get out of her role will not
[1:31:23] reach for another position
[1:31:25] but she will be submissive and meek and
[1:31:27] mild and
[1:31:28] totally surrendered to the headship of
[1:31:30] christ
[1:31:32] and that was the one he's been looking
[1:31:34] for all the way back as he's restoring
[1:31:36] amen the masterpiece amen there was
[1:31:38] never a church that could come to that
[1:31:40] place they would always amen
[1:31:41] under seduction they would begin to move
[1:31:43] independently of headship
[1:31:46] and look at things and make decisions on
[1:31:48] who can be a priest and who can't be a
[1:31:50] priest and
[1:31:51] who can what what do we decide on this
[1:31:55] doctrine what do we decide on that
[1:31:56] doctrine
[1:32:00] because that's not the expression he's
[1:32:02] looking for
[1:32:04] he's not looking for an independent
[1:32:06] woman
[1:32:09] brother bam said the bride is an
[1:32:10] independent independent from all others
[1:32:12] and not
[1:32:12] independent from him
[1:32:16] she's independent from every other
[1:32:17] system she's independent from every
[1:32:19] other man
[1:32:19] she's independent from every other idea
[1:32:21] but she is completely
[1:32:23] totally dependent and surrendered to her
[1:32:24] husband
[1:32:26] that's the expression he's looking for
[1:32:28] in this hour
[1:32:30] lucifer failed eve failed
[1:32:34] israel failed the church of pentecost
[1:32:36] failed but this bride won't fall
[1:32:39] she won't fail she's predestinated not
[1:32:41] to
[1:32:43] but what's it going to take it's going
[1:32:45] to take a complete surrender
[1:32:47] a meek mild submissive nature
[1:32:53] let's go to john chapter 15.
[1:33:03] in verse 4.
[1:33:10] john chapter 15 verse 4
[1:33:13] abide in me and i in you as the branch
[1:33:17] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[1:33:18] abide in the vine
[1:33:20] no more can ye except you abide in me
[1:33:23] that's just saying the same thing
[1:33:26] i'm the vine i'm the male you're the
[1:33:28] female
[1:33:30] i'm the vine you're the branches
[1:33:34] three verse four again abide in me and i
[1:33:36] in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[1:33:38] of its uh
[1:33:38] itself except it abide in the vine no
[1:33:41] more can you except you abide in me
[1:33:43] i am the vine you are the branches he
[1:33:45] that abideth in me and i in him the same
[1:33:47] bringeth forth
[1:33:48] much fruit for without me you can do
[1:33:52] nothing
[1:33:56] how will you ever bring forth life
[1:33:58] without the mail
[1:34:01] and you're not the expression of the
[1:34:03] male you're the expression of the female
[1:34:06] so you're totally dependent on the male
[1:34:09] to bring forth life
[1:34:10] because the hebrew globe and the life
[1:34:11] the blood is with the male
[1:34:14] that's why we're dependent on the word
[1:34:17] that's why the word came in the days
[1:34:18] as our headship that's why we're totally
[1:34:20] submissive and dependent to that word
[1:34:22] because
[1:34:22] life is coming to that word because
[1:34:24] jesus says without me you can do nothing
[1:34:26] what do you mean i can do nothing i'm an
[1:34:28] attribute of god
[1:34:31] you understand what i'm saying i'm an
[1:34:32] attribute of god i'm part of god
[1:34:35] amen a part of elohim that's true
[1:34:39] so was jesus christ jesus christ was
[1:34:42] part of elohim he's part of god
[1:34:44] he was god made flesh he was immanuel
[1:34:47] god with us
[1:34:48] and in that expression he would do
[1:34:49] nothing outside of what the father told
[1:34:52] him because his expression was son
[1:34:54] he stayed in what god put him and
[1:34:56] expressed what god told him to express
[1:34:59] is that right let's keep reading
[1:35:04] oh let's keep reading here
[1:35:07] i want to read verse 5 again i am the
[1:35:08] vine you are the branches he that abide
[1:35:10] in me and i
[1:35:11] in him the same bringeth forth much
[1:35:13] fruit for without me you can do nothing
[1:35:15] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[1:35:18] forth as a branch
[1:35:19] and is withered and men gather them and
[1:35:21] cast them into the fire
[1:35:22] and they are burned
[1:35:26] if you separate from the vine you bring
[1:35:28] no life
[1:35:30] if the female separates from the male
[1:35:32] she brings no life
[1:35:34] amen if you these churches who separated
[1:35:36] from the vine from the mail
[1:35:38] they brought no life they were cut off
[1:35:40] and cast into the fire
[1:35:42] but this bride won't be that way let's
[1:35:45] go to john chapter 5.
[1:35:55] john chapter 5 verse 30.
[1:35:59] this is jesus christ now before i read
[1:36:01] this don't look down look up look up
[1:36:02] look up you're going to ruin my surprise
[1:36:07] jesus was emmanuel
[1:36:10] we know that the scripture tells us he
[1:36:12] was he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:36:15] in flesh he was all that god was
[1:36:19] reporting to christ we know
[1:36:20] all of these things but he was given a
[1:36:23] certain
[1:36:24] expression for a certain hour and he was
[1:36:26] going to stay true
[1:36:27] although it was the fullness of god in
[1:36:29] him he was only going to express
[1:36:30] that portion that god gave to him he was
[1:36:32] only going to do what the father shows
[1:36:33] him
[1:36:34] and now he comes down to verse 30 he
[1:36:37] said i can of mine
[1:36:38] own self do nothing
[1:36:42] listen friends what an example for us
[1:36:44] amen yes we are the bride yes it is
[1:36:46] jesus christ yes you are the word but
[1:36:48] you cannot act
[1:36:50] independently of the male amen you
[1:36:52] cannot go off on your own you cannot
[1:36:54] make up your own way you can't go by
[1:36:55] your own feelings you can't
[1:36:57] you have to stay tied to the male
[1:36:59] because your expression
[1:37:00] is not male your expression is female
[1:37:04] this is the hour for total surrender
[1:37:06] total submission and then total patience
[1:37:08] and waiting on god
[1:37:10] because without him we can do nothing
[1:37:12] he's the vine we're the branches
[1:37:13] amen the vine the the vine has come back
[1:37:16] amen the word has come back
[1:37:18] the male has come back to produce life
[1:37:21] but i cannot act independent of that god
[1:37:24] has taken the two and put them back
[1:37:25] together to reproduce the son of man
[1:37:27] again
[1:37:28] but i can't do it without him i in
[1:37:31] myself though
[1:37:32] in me down in my soul is a portion of
[1:37:34] god himself
[1:37:35] i cannot do it independently of the rest
[1:37:38] of the portion of god
[1:37:40] god has set it up to where these
[1:37:42] expressions must now come together to
[1:37:44] bring forth life
[1:37:46] the female expression independent of the
[1:37:48] male will bring death amen like it did
[1:37:50] in the garden
[1:37:51] amen and the male must have the female
[1:37:54] expression to bring forth life
[1:37:56] because that's the way god set it up
[1:37:58] amen god amen wanted a male expression
[1:38:00] and a female expression and here in the
[1:38:02] end time because there was a prophet
[1:38:03] here to unite the two
[1:38:05] the two have come together to produce
[1:38:07] life amen to be fruit on the vine again
[1:38:09] to be the very life of jesus christ on
[1:38:12] display
[1:38:12] in the formation of the bride
[1:38:16] but we have to stay true to our position
[1:38:19] just like
[1:38:20] just as much as jesus stayed true to his
[1:38:22] position
[1:38:25] let's keep read this again verse 30. i
[1:38:27] can't of mine own self do nothing
[1:38:29] as i hear i judge and my judgment is
[1:38:32] just because i seek not my own will
[1:38:34] but the will of the father which has
[1:38:36] sent me
[1:38:38] jesus was the fullness of the godhead
[1:38:41] bodily
[1:38:43] and he would do not do anything without
[1:38:44] the instruction of the father
[1:38:48] that's why he was the perfect expression
[1:38:51] of the son
[1:38:53] because he was the faithful son who
[1:38:54] would not leave the instructions of the
[1:38:56] father
[1:38:58] all the other ones failed he was typed
[1:39:01] in moses
[1:39:02] moses failed he was typed in david david
[1:39:04] failed
[1:39:05] is that what brother graham tells us he
[1:39:07] was typed out in moses and moses
[1:39:09] was the meekest man on earth and god had
[1:39:11] called him and but
[1:39:12] all of a sudden moses got frustrated and
[1:39:15] moses brother
[1:39:16] the scripture says he exalted himself
[1:39:18] and he said shall i
[1:39:20] fetch water shall i
[1:39:23] he was putting himself in the place of
[1:39:25] god he was speaking as god
[1:39:27] amen and god spoke through him and when
[1:39:30] he spoke the words of god
[1:39:31] it was the same as god speaking but he
[1:39:33] was in total submission to god
[1:39:35] when he spoke fleas and lies and frogs
[1:39:37] and all of that but now he comes to
[1:39:39] where he
[1:39:40] supposed amen he's supposed to speak to
[1:39:42] the rock amen and he smites it he takes
[1:39:44] his
[1:39:44] own action and when he takes his
[1:39:48] own action now he's punished and he's
[1:39:51] not permitted to go into
[1:39:53] why because he got out of the bounds of
[1:39:54] his expression
[1:39:58] when when god told him to speak he spoke
[1:40:00] it was the same as god speaking
[1:40:02] the creative power came out of the lips
[1:40:05] of a human being because god told him to
[1:40:06] do it
[1:40:07] but when he took it upon himself in
[1:40:08] anger and said shall i
[1:40:10] fetch water for you and your rebellions
[1:40:12] and stiffneck people and he struck the
[1:40:14] rock
[1:40:14] amen because he was a gift and because
[1:40:17] he was a prophet
[1:40:17] guess what came flowing out of that rock
[1:40:21] water but he himself was wrong
[1:40:25] because he left his position god didn't
[1:40:29] tell him to do that
[1:40:30] he took it upon himself to do that
[1:40:33] david was an expression of christ but he
[1:40:36] didn't stay true to the perfect son
[1:40:39] because he despised god and his sin with
[1:40:41] bathsheba
[1:40:43] all of these expressions of the sun the
[1:40:46] adam's expression
[1:40:47] amen abraham was expression no as an
[1:40:50] expression but he he was drunk and
[1:40:52] uncovered in his tent
[1:40:54] all these expressions failed why they
[1:40:57] failed by leaving the the realm god
[1:41:00] called them in and taking their own
[1:41:01] action for their own desire
[1:41:04] but jesus christ comes and he's the
[1:41:06] perfect son
[1:41:07] and he's god expressing himself his son
[1:41:09] and in that expression of son
[1:41:11] he'll never take his own will he'll
[1:41:14] never
[1:41:15] take his own desire he'll never move
[1:41:17] away
[1:41:18] from the instructions from the father
[1:41:20] showing what a perfect son
[1:41:22] is even till he come to the garden of
[1:41:25] gethsemane
[1:41:26] and he begins to cry and then he begins
[1:41:28] to agonize and he begins to sweat as it
[1:41:30] were great drops of blood
[1:41:32] this is jesus christ in his humanity
[1:41:34] brother branham said he was 100 god
[1:41:36] and 100 man and i do not know how to
[1:41:39] figure that out
[1:41:40] all i can say is amen and hearing as
[1:41:43] humanity as a son
[1:41:44] he's crying out to a father listen he is
[1:41:47] still emanuel
[1:41:48] it's still god in him he is still the
[1:41:50] word made flesh he is still the fullness
[1:41:52] of the godhead
[1:41:53] and he's crying out and he's saying
[1:41:55] father please
[1:41:56] let this cup pass from me he's not
[1:41:59] taking his own
[1:42:00] he's not saying well i'm the son of god
[1:42:05] the fact that he was the son of god put
[1:42:07] him in submission to the father
[1:42:10] and he's not making demands or commands
[1:42:12] he's asking the father
[1:42:15] can this cup pass from me
[1:42:19] he asks the second time can this cup
[1:42:22] pass from me
[1:42:24] and he asked the third time can this cup
[1:42:27] pass from me
[1:42:28] and he says nevertheless not my will
[1:42:31] but thy will be done he fulfilled the
[1:42:35] perfect expression
[1:42:37] of son the relationship between the son
[1:42:42] and the father was expressed and now in
[1:42:44] this hour the relationship between the
[1:42:46] bride and the bridegroom
[1:42:47] is to be expressed she's not to take her
[1:42:50] own way
[1:42:51] or to take her own mind or come up with
[1:42:53] her own ideas
[1:42:55] but the headship has already come
[1:42:58] and she is submitted to that headship
[1:43:04] you know let's turn to acts chapter 3.
[1:43:12] peter and all of those on the day of
[1:43:14] pentecost
[1:43:16] they received the baptism of the holy
[1:43:18] ghost the seed within them was quick in
[1:43:19] the life
[1:43:20] they had the very life of jesus christ
[1:43:22] on the inside is that true
[1:43:25] they all that god had promised all they
[1:43:26] got to prophesy was now
[1:43:28] in them they were the expression
[1:43:31] of jesus christ it was jesus christ
[1:43:33] moving and working through them
[1:43:35] amen they were the the attributes of god
[1:43:38] on display in that day
[1:43:41] and they come in chapter 3 verse 11
[1:43:44] says and as the lame man which was
[1:43:46] healed held peter and john
[1:43:48] all the people ran together unto them in
[1:43:49] the porch that is called solomon's
[1:43:52] greatly wondering and when peter saw it
[1:43:54] he answered unto the people
[1:43:56] ye men of israel why marvel you at this
[1:43:59] or
[1:43:59] why look you so earnestly on us as
[1:44:01] though by our power our holiness
[1:44:03] we have made this man walk paul
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:10] paul and are not paul peter and john i
[1:44:13] didn't think it felt right
[1:44:16] we're walking along the saw lay men
[1:44:18] there was something in them there was a
[1:44:19] power
[1:44:20] in them amen to heal this man amen and
[1:44:23] they were quickened to life they were
[1:44:25] living attributes of god amen
[1:44:27] part of the family sons of god quickened
[1:44:30] the life
[1:44:30] and now they they they under inspiration
[1:44:33] or however it came to them they speak to
[1:44:35] this man
[1:44:36] he gets up and he starts walking and
[1:44:38] they begin to marvel
[1:44:41] and i want to i want to read it here in
[1:44:43] verse 9 again and all the people saw him
[1:44:44] walking and praising god
[1:44:46] and they knew that it was he which sat
[1:44:47] for alms at the beautiful gate
[1:44:49] of the temple and they were filled with
[1:44:51] wonder and amazement at that which he
[1:44:53] had happened unto him
[1:44:54] and as the lame man which was healed
[1:44:56] held peter and john
[1:44:57] all the people ran together into them in
[1:44:59] the porch that is called solomon's
[1:45:00] greatly wondering and when peter saw it
[1:45:03] he answered unto them say unto the
[1:45:05] people ye men of israel why
[1:45:07] marvel you at this or why look you so
[1:45:09] earnestly on us
[1:45:11] as though we made this man to walk
[1:45:14] the god of abraham and of isaac and of
[1:45:17] jacob the god of our fathers hath
[1:45:19] glorified his son jesus
[1:45:20] which he delivered up and then up and
[1:45:23] denied him in the presence of pilate
[1:45:25] when he was determined to let him go but
[1:45:28] ye denied the holy one and the just
[1:45:30] and desired a murderer to be granted to
[1:45:33] you
[1:45:33] and killed the prince of life whom god
[1:45:36] hath raised from the dead
[1:45:37] whereof we are witnesses and his name
[1:45:40] through faith in his name
[1:45:41] hath made this man strong whom you see
[1:45:44] in
[1:45:45] and know yea the faith which is by him
[1:45:48] hath given him this perfect soundness in
[1:45:50] the presence
[1:45:51] of you all peter and john
[1:45:55] had a perfect opportunity to receive
[1:45:58] glory and honor and praise
[1:46:01] they were there as living oracles of god
[1:46:04] they were there
[1:46:05] amen with the very life of jesus christ
[1:46:07] quickened on the inside of them
[1:46:09] they were there with a power that was
[1:46:11] supernatural and in that supernatural
[1:46:13] power
[1:46:14] amen they they spoke to a man he
[1:46:16] believed
[1:46:17] he raised up and they began to wander
[1:46:19] and say well i wonder as if we did this
[1:46:20] ourselves we didn't do this
[1:46:23] it was jesus christ the bride what was
[1:46:27] the bride doing
[1:46:28] the bride was bringing glory to her
[1:46:29] headship
[1:46:31] the one who was really doing the work
[1:46:33] they know that it has to be in
[1:46:35] them him in them doing the works
[1:46:38] we know is not going to say well i'm the
[1:46:41] bride i can't i'm the bride i can
[1:46:43] yeah i'm the bride because he made me
[1:46:44] bride not because i want to be bride
[1:46:47] i'm not bribed by merit i'm not bribed
[1:46:49] by conduct i'm not bride amen by works
[1:46:52] because mary was not the virgin by any
[1:46:54] power she had to do anything
[1:46:56] she was virgin by predestination she was
[1:46:58] the chosen woman
[1:46:59] by god's choice and all she could do was
[1:47:02] surrender and god did everything else
[1:47:05] and so mary doesn't get the credit for
[1:47:08] the birth of jesus christ god does
[1:47:11] amen these two men did not get the
[1:47:13] credit amen though they were bribed
[1:47:15] though they were they were united with
[1:47:17] christ though christ was living in
[1:47:19] they didn't get credit christ did
[1:47:22] because they knew it wasn't them amen
[1:47:24] just a few days before
[1:47:25] amen peter was dying and running away he
[1:47:28] knew it wasn't him he knew it was god in
[1:47:30] him
[1:47:30] and he was willing to give credit and
[1:47:32] not take any credit to himself
[1:47:36] was god in him
[1:47:39] john chapter 7
[1:47:42] look back at jesus again
[1:47:59] john 7 and 16.
[1:48:06] jesus answered them and said my doctrine
[1:48:08] is not mine
[1:48:10] but his that sent me
[1:48:13] jesus didn't even teach he didn't even
[1:48:15] take credit for what he taught
[1:48:19] he gave credit to the father why
[1:48:22] because he was the expression of the son
[1:48:25] and he couldn't teach anything that the
[1:48:28] father didn't tell him to teach you see
[1:48:32] he was under his headship under his
[1:48:34] father
[1:48:36] and the bride in this day is going to be
[1:48:38] under her headship under the word
[1:48:40] jesus christ
[1:48:43] see jesus had no problem
[1:48:47] surrendering to the father and he had no
[1:48:49] problem declaring that he was
[1:48:50] surrendering to the father
[1:48:51] was he god yes he was god then why is he
[1:48:54] surrendering to the father
[1:48:55] because this is his attribute this is
[1:48:58] his expression
[1:48:59] this is his time of expression this is
[1:49:01] what the god called for in an expression
[1:49:03] so in that expression he stayed true to
[1:49:05] that expression
[1:49:07] well now god has called for expression
[1:49:09] of bride
[1:49:11] and that bride is is not going to go
[1:49:13] back and try to take credit for herself
[1:49:15] or replicate and say i've done and i
[1:49:17] she knows she's done nothing it has to
[1:49:19] be him
[1:49:20] i have no life i have no fruit i have
[1:49:22] nothing amen i'm the branch he's the
[1:49:24] vine
[1:49:25] amen he's the one he's the one who
[1:49:27] called me he's the one who placed me
[1:49:29] he's the one who's positioned me now
[1:49:31] it's him it's not me and i want to stay
[1:49:32] subject to him
[1:49:33] i don't ever ever want to work
[1:49:35] independent of the vine
[1:49:38] because that's what caused failure every
[1:49:40] time
[1:49:42] brother branham said in the message
[1:49:44] influence
[1:49:47] you know the reason i'm saying this is
[1:49:48] because when you hear you're the bride
[1:49:50] you're the bride you're the bride you're
[1:49:51] the bride so much
[1:49:52] you can begin to make it can become
[1:49:54] carnal
[1:49:56] and it can come to a place where now all
[1:49:58] of a sudden we feel like
[1:50:00] i can i can i can i can
[1:50:04] and the real reality comes back to the
[1:50:06] fact is without him i can't
[1:50:07] without him i can't without him i can
[1:50:10] without him i can
[1:50:11] but he can he can he can he can
[1:50:15] is the bride the chosen vessel yes amen
[1:50:18] is she the tabernacle of deity for this
[1:50:19] day yes
[1:50:20] is she the one who has the word of life
[1:50:22] in this hour absolutely is she the
[1:50:24] tabernacle or jesus christ it's
[1:50:25] tabernacle
[1:50:26] yes is it the fullness of christ born in
[1:50:27] her absolutely
[1:50:29] but it's not her it's him in her
[1:50:33] you know in israel it got to the place
[1:50:35] where it was god
[1:50:36] in the temple amen and they so
[1:50:38] reverenced and respected the temple
[1:50:40] because of god in the temple
[1:50:41] but it shifted somewhere along in their
[1:50:43] minds where they begin to honor and
[1:50:45] respect the temple
[1:50:47] not the life that was in the temple and
[1:50:50] the evidence becomes so true when jesus
[1:50:52] christ is standing here because now the
[1:50:53] shekinah glory that was in that temple
[1:50:55] was now in another temple and they so
[1:50:57] loved the temple not the life that when
[1:50:59] the life came in another temple
[1:51:01] they hated the temple and hated the life
[1:51:05] so deity is tabernacled in flesh on
[1:51:08] earth today
[1:51:09] absolutely it's jesus christ in bright
[1:51:11] form amen but that bright form is just a
[1:51:14] tabernacle that he's dwelling in and
[1:51:15] he's expressing bride
[1:51:17] through that vessel through that
[1:51:19] tabernacle
[1:51:20] and we don't want to exalt the vessel
[1:51:22] until the vessel starts to act like
[1:51:24] moses
[1:51:25] and say shall i fetch
[1:51:32] but she's supposed to be submissive and
[1:51:34] timid
[1:51:35] and meek and say lord what should we do
[1:51:40] lord what would you have me do lord what
[1:51:42] does your word say show me in your word
[1:51:44] what to do
[1:51:44] because you're my headship
[1:51:48] brother branham says in the message
[1:51:50] influence
[1:51:52] now notice secondly with two wings they
[1:51:54] covered their feet
[1:51:55] what did that mean humility before god
[1:51:57] in his presence
[1:51:59] he's talking about the the seraphim amen
[1:52:02] that are around the throne of god he
[1:52:03] said holy never
[1:52:05] sinned but with two wings they're in
[1:52:08] action two wings they cover their face
[1:52:11] amen and two wings they cover their feet
[1:52:13] in humility
[1:52:16] he says like moses at the burning bush
[1:52:19] took off his shoes
[1:52:20] when he heard him say i am that i am.
[1:52:23] paul on his road to damascus he fell on
[1:52:25] his face john
[1:52:26] when he saw the spirit of god above
[1:52:28] jesus he said i have need to be baptized
[1:52:30] to thee and why cometh down unto me
[1:52:32] here is a good example always be
[1:52:34] conscious of your littleness
[1:52:36] not your bigness oh
[1:52:40] if you want to see an expression of
[1:52:41] bride in this day take that to heart
[1:52:43] amen don't get puffed up don't get
[1:52:45] elevated yes we preach about the bride
[1:52:47] because that is the word for this hour
[1:52:49] that is the manifestation of jesus
[1:52:50] christ in this hour but we
[1:52:52] as vessels amen that god has chosen to
[1:52:54] be the bride
[1:52:55] our expression is not
[1:52:58] sun not bride
[1:53:01] groom our expression is bride
[1:53:05] and we have to stay true to the bride so
[1:53:07] the sun can be expressed through the
[1:53:09] bride
[1:53:11] because it's him expressed in bright
[1:53:14] form and i want him to be expressed
[1:53:17] properly in this day
[1:53:24] he said always be conscious of your
[1:53:25] littleness not your bigness
[1:53:28] today we americans so much that we try
[1:53:30] to think we're big somebody
[1:53:32] we belong to something big some big
[1:53:34] organization some big great something
[1:53:36] oh great big big is is all we see
[1:53:41] but first john 4 4 says year of god
[1:53:44] little children have overcome them
[1:53:45] because
[1:53:47] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:53:49] that is in the world
[1:53:51] it's still him and me amen it's still
[1:53:53] him
[1:53:54] he's the object of our adoration he's
[1:53:56] the object of our love
[1:53:57] and he's the one that we're submissive
[1:53:59] to
[1:54:02] romans 16 20 said in the god of peace
[1:54:04] shall bruce satan under your feet
[1:54:05] shortly who will do what
[1:54:11] where will satan be bruised under the
[1:54:13] feet of the bride
[1:54:15] will the bride do it no will it be done
[1:54:18] through the bride
[1:54:19] yes will it look like the bride does it
[1:54:23] yes but it'll be him and her
[1:54:26] finishing the work that he left for this
[1:54:28] hour and she will be
[1:54:30] totally submissive to him with a meek
[1:54:33] gentle quiet spirit she'll never tell
[1:54:35] him what to do
[1:54:36] she'll be told what to do by him
[1:54:43] i want to read this quote out of
[1:54:44] anointed ones at the end time
[1:54:48] now i want you to know this is sure and
[1:54:51] and you that listen to this tape
[1:54:53] you might have thought today that i was
[1:54:54] trying to say that about myself being
[1:54:56] that i was packing this message
[1:54:58] i have no more to do with it than
[1:54:59] nothing
[1:55:03] i say that's the right attitude are you
[1:55:06] the bride
[1:55:07] well because he chose me to be i didn't
[1:55:10] work my way up to it i didn't earn it
[1:55:12] it's by his grace and his grace alone
[1:55:14] and i'm so thankful he called me to be
[1:55:16] his bride
[1:55:17] i love him so much for his choice i love
[1:55:19] him so much for his plan
[1:55:21] it's not me i can't be arrogant about it
[1:55:23] i can't be extra bold i can't be
[1:55:25] harsh i just say thank you lord
[1:55:29] i can't go up to somebody say don't you
[1:55:30] know i'm the bride
[1:55:33] that's not feminine expression
[1:55:39] this feminine expression is he told me
[1:55:42] talk to him he's my husband
[1:55:48] i have no more to do with it than
[1:55:49] nothing no more than just a voice and my
[1:55:51] voice against my better judgment
[1:55:53] i wanted to be a trapper but it's the
[1:55:55] will of my father that i declared to do
[1:55:57] and determined to do
[1:55:58] i wasn't the one that appeared down on
[1:56:00] the river i was only standing there when
[1:56:02] he appeared
[1:56:03] i'm not the one that performs these
[1:56:05] things and foretells these things that
[1:56:06] happens as perfect
[1:56:07] perfect they are i'm only one that's
[1:56:10] near when he does it
[1:56:12] i was only a voice that he used to say
[1:56:14] it
[1:56:15] it was it wasn't what i knew it wasn't
[1:56:18] i let me repeat that again because this
[1:56:21] is good
[1:56:22] i'm i'm only i'm only one that's near
[1:56:26] when he doesn't
[1:56:27] i was only a voice that he used to say
[1:56:29] it it wasn't what i knew
[1:56:31] it's what i just surrendered myself to
[1:56:33] that he spoke through
[1:56:35] it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel
[1:56:38] oh no
[1:56:39] it was the manifestation of the son of
[1:56:41] man it wasn't the angel his message
[1:56:43] it was the mystery that god unfolded
[1:56:46] it's not a man
[1:56:47] it's god the angel was not the son of
[1:56:51] man
[1:56:51] he was the messenger from the son of man
[1:56:54] the son of man is christ
[1:56:55] he's the one that you're feeding on
[1:56:57] you're not feeding on a man a man his
[1:56:59] words will fail but you're feeding on
[1:57:01] the unfailing body word
[1:57:03] of the son of man
[1:57:09] it wasn't me it wasn't me
[1:57:13] who believed the message it was him and
[1:57:14] me
[1:57:16] it wasn't me who even had the heart to
[1:57:18] surrender i had a rebellious nature
[1:57:20] before god
[1:57:20] got a hold of me but he quickened
[1:57:21] something to me it's him and me that
[1:57:23] surrenders back to him
[1:57:25] it was god and the son that was
[1:57:27] reflecting back to the father
[1:57:29] and playing the part of sign amen now
[1:57:31] it's christ in the bride
[1:57:32] that is playing the part of the bride
[1:57:33] the bride the wife the godly wife the
[1:57:36] faithful wife the one who will not go
[1:57:38] independent and go out on her own and
[1:57:40] fall like the previous ones did
[1:57:42] but she will stay united to her headship
[1:57:44] united to the male
[1:57:45] which is the word and then together amen
[1:57:48] they will be united and bring forth
[1:57:50] life because it's the vine and the
[1:57:51] branches connected again
[1:57:55] and if god does anything
[1:57:58] it wasn't because i took a
[1:58:00] self-proclaimed title as bride
[1:58:03] if god does anything through me it's
[1:58:04] because he determined for the foundation
[1:58:06] that's what he was going to do
[1:58:08] and the only part that i had in it was
[1:58:10] to just surrender and get out of his way
[1:58:13] and let him do it and for that
[1:58:18] i will worship him for eternity
[1:58:22] he will always be the object of my
[1:58:24] worship and my adoration and my
[1:58:26] affection
[1:58:28] but aren't i god too there's a part of
[1:58:30] god in me
[1:58:31] yes a portion but this
[1:58:34] portion worships the father
[1:58:39] this portion that's bride will worship
[1:58:42] the bridegroom
[1:58:44] because that's the way god wants it
[1:58:49] let's read revelations 4 the last
[1:58:52] scripture that we read
[1:59:00] revelations chapter 4
[1:59:03] verse 8.
[1:59:09] and the four beasts had each of them six
[1:59:11] wings about him
[1:59:12] they were full of eyes within they were
[1:59:15] full of eyes within and they rest not
[1:59:17] day and night saying holy
[1:59:18] holy holy lord god almighty which was
[1:59:21] and is and is to come when those beasts
[1:59:24] give glory and honor and thanks to him
[1:59:26] that sat on the throne
[1:59:27] who lived forever and ever the four and
[1:59:29] twenty elders fall down before him that
[1:59:32] sat on the throne
[1:59:33] and worshiped him that liveth forever
[1:59:35] and ever and cast their crowns before
[1:59:37] the throne
[1:59:38] saying thou art worthy o lord to receive
[1:59:40] glory
[1:59:41] and honor and power for thou has created
[1:59:44] all things
[1:59:44] and for thy pleasure they are and were
[1:59:48] created brother ben said i don't want a
[1:59:51] crown and i don't want a robe
[1:59:53] i just want to look at him for thousands
[1:59:55] of years for eternity
[1:59:56] i want to look upon his face and love
[1:59:58] him amen
[2:00:00] there's no self-inflated ideas there's
[2:00:03] no independence from him
[2:00:05] there's no i'm this therefore i can do
[2:00:07] that but there's just god i need thee
[2:00:09] every hour i need thee you've got a
[2:00:12] mighty work that you want done in this
[2:00:14] hour there's something amazing that you
[2:00:16] want to portray
[2:00:16] there's something powerful you want to
[2:00:18] display and you want to display yourself
[2:00:20] in the form of the bride
[2:00:21] and i believe you've called me to be an
[2:00:23] expression of that bride
[2:00:24] but god without you i can do nothing i
[2:00:27] need you lord
[2:00:28] to come and do the works in and through
[2:00:29] me
[2:00:31] i'm a failure to begin with
[2:00:35] but all i can do is surrender to him in
[2:00:37] meekness and humility
[2:00:39] and say god if you're going to do a
[2:00:41] mighty work it's going to be you
[2:00:43] independent of me all i can do is say be
[2:00:46] it unto me
[2:00:48] according to your word
[2:00:51] we can't reverence him enough brother
[2:00:52] ben said you can't humble yourself
[2:00:54] enough
[2:00:55] you can't reverence enough reverence him
[2:00:58] enough
[2:00:59] it has to be him doing the work
[2:01:04] the prophet of god he would demonstrate
[2:01:06] manifestations like
[2:01:08] this world has not seen since the time
[2:01:09] of jesus christ
[2:01:12] but if you ever watch deep call it to
[2:01:14] the deep the man will be standing there
[2:01:17] now listen if i had all the
[2:01:19] manifestations and gifts and
[2:01:21] demonstrations of power that was in him
[2:01:23] i don't know what i would be like
[2:01:25] it would probably ruin me but god
[2:01:28] knew who he could trust
[2:01:31] and the prophet of god would stand there
[2:01:34] amen and
[2:01:35] he would stand there and and i believe
[2:01:38] it's the the
[2:01:39] deep caller to the deep video and he
[2:01:42] calls the prayer line
[2:01:43] there's thousands of people in this in
[2:01:45] this uh
[2:01:46] auditorium he has uh advertised healing
[2:01:50] campaigns and
[2:01:51] done all of those things and he's
[2:01:52] sitting here on the line amen
[2:01:55] promising healing talking about divine
[2:01:57] healing amen there's a testimony of the
[2:01:59] works that were done before
[2:02:00] and he's standing here calling a prayer
[2:02:02] line and he starts to hem haul around
[2:02:05] now you know and this and you know that
[2:02:08] and this is the patient let's get a line
[2:02:10] and and then all of a sudden he stops he
[2:02:12] said now you know i'm waiting on
[2:02:16] something
[2:02:18] no temptation to work it up to protect
[2:02:21] his ego to protect his image
[2:02:23] he would say before on tape now i have
[2:02:25] no guarantee that'll come
[2:02:29] what would he do manufacture something
[2:02:31] or walk off the stage
[2:02:34] others have manufactured to save their
[2:02:37] reputation
[2:02:39] to work up the crowd pump them up have a
[2:02:41] have a big mass prayer
[2:02:43] amen and move on but brother branham is
[2:02:45] standing there so meek
[2:02:46] knowing it's not him it's what god told
[2:02:48] him
[2:02:50] it's not him it's the word of the lord
[2:02:51] it's not him it's the word of god and
[2:02:53] then he just gave the word of god and
[2:02:55] he's been commissioned by an angel
[2:02:57] and he's standing here under his
[2:02:58] commission and he's saying now you know
[2:02:59] i'm waiting for something
[2:03:02] no i'm just waiting for the angel now
[2:03:03] many of you have seen him you've seen
[2:03:05] his picture
[2:03:06] taken and i'm not getting the words
[2:03:08] exactly right but you've watched it you
[2:03:09] know
[2:03:11] totally totally giving all credit to god
[2:03:18] he himself amen was a subject of god a
[2:03:22] subject of jesus christ
[2:03:24] a son that was in obedience was he a
[2:03:26] manifestation of god yes was it god
[2:03:28] working through that man
[2:03:29] yes was it a son of man revealing the
[2:03:31] son of man yes but he is an individual
[2:03:33] attribute of god
[2:03:34] is in submission to the father in total
[2:03:36] surrender to him
[2:03:37] acting the part of a son saying now if
[2:03:40] you don't come there's nothing i can do
[2:03:46] it wasn't his reputation he had so
[2:03:49] separated himself from the work of god
[2:03:52] that he knew it would have to be god and
[2:03:53] not him
[2:03:54] he if it didn't work for him he wasn't
[2:03:56] going to be a failure because he was
[2:03:58] already the failure
[2:04:03] all of a sudden he says he's here
[2:04:08] and everything changed the sermon was
[2:04:12] spotless
[2:04:13] it was powerful the healings were
[2:04:15] manifested right on the stage
[2:04:18] what was it that was a man who would not
[2:04:20] get out of his position
[2:04:22] that was a man who did what god told him
[2:04:24] to do the way god told him to do it and
[2:04:26] stayed humble and submissive and
[2:04:28] reverent to his father to his lord
[2:04:32] so i want to be the same thing take all
[2:04:35] desire for self-protection away lord
[2:04:37] take all desire to prove something or to
[2:04:39] manifest something
[2:04:40] i don't have to prove i'm bride it's not
[2:04:43] the the the the obligation to prove
[2:04:47] there's a bride on the earth is not my
[2:04:48] obligation it's his obligation because
[2:04:50] he sent a prophet to tell us to be a
[2:04:52] bride here in this hour
[2:04:53] and that bride would be the
[2:04:54] manifestation of jesus christ and bright
[2:04:56] form
[2:04:56] it's not my responsibility to prove
[2:04:58] anything i don't want to feel any
[2:05:00] any any responsibility for proving
[2:05:02] because i'll get pushed into air
[2:05:04] trying to make something happen when all
[2:05:06] he's asking me to do is be like the
[2:05:08] virgin so all that was promised to the
[2:05:09] virgin can happen through me
[2:05:13] and say lord i i can't do that i haven't
[2:05:16] even been with a man
[2:05:18] he said no it'll be the holy ghost okay
[2:05:20] be it unto me according to your word
[2:05:23] just do it lord i can't do it you can
[2:05:27] in this hour he's looking for the female
[2:05:31] to be expressed
[2:05:33] the last atom is expressed in male
[2:05:37] and in female that a female expression
[2:05:40] is jesus christ it's him
[2:05:42] it's him but you have to know what
[2:05:45] expression of him it's been god
[2:05:49] god and noah god god and moses god and
[2:05:51] david god
[2:05:53] but what expression for what hour what
[2:05:56] attribute on display
[2:05:57] what portion of the nature of god does
[2:05:59] he want displayed
[2:06:01] and what does he want displayed in this
[2:06:02] hour he wants to meek
[2:06:04] sweet gentle reverent submissive
[2:06:08] woman and i said god that's what i want
[2:06:12] to be
[2:06:14] make me that old god i'm raising my hand
[2:06:17] to say i can't
[2:06:18] do it myself lord but it's what i want
[2:06:20] it's the hour for it and i want to
[2:06:22] surrender myself and say lord
[2:06:24] come and do all that you've promised to
[2:06:26] do in this
[2:06:27] hour through this vessel because i can't
[2:06:30] do it myself
[2:06:31] you are the vine you've called me to be
[2:06:33] the branch let me stay connected to you
[2:06:35] because if i'm not there'll be no fruit
[2:06:38] and if there's no fruit i'll be cast
[2:06:39] away paul the apostle was the prophet of
[2:06:43] the age amen
[2:06:44] manifestations and demonstrations and
[2:06:46] revelations were coming off of him
[2:06:48] and mighty power is that true
[2:06:51] and he said i keep under my body and
[2:06:54] bring it into subjection
[2:06:55] lest when i have preached to others i
[2:06:57] should be a cast away
[2:07:00] you would think he would be so secure
[2:07:01] and say well i'm the prophet of the age
[2:07:03] and i'm this and i'm that but look at
[2:07:04] the nature of brother branham amen there
[2:07:06] wasn't a man that i
[2:07:07] ever saw with my eyes i heard with my
[2:07:09] ears had more
[2:07:10] power working in their life than that
[2:07:12] man but he was so humble and submissive
[2:07:14] and reverent
[2:07:17] the apostle paul had revelations and
[2:07:20] manifestations and power demonstrated
[2:07:22] from him
[2:07:23] but he would still say even with all of
[2:07:25] that i still must bring
[2:07:27] myself and my body subject to him
[2:07:31] lest when i've preached to others i
[2:07:32] should be a cast away
[2:07:34] you would think he had nothing to worry
[2:07:36] about but he recognized his littleness
[2:07:39] and his need for god say god help me
[2:07:42] never to forget my littleness
[2:07:44] and my need for you it doesn't change
[2:07:47] the fact that i know
[2:07:48] i'm his bride i know it
[2:07:52] i know this is the hour for the
[2:07:53] manifestation of the bride
[2:07:55] but yet without him i can do nothing
[2:07:59] it's all him not me but it's him
[2:08:03] through me amen let's all stand
[2:08:12] we were thinking on wednesday we were
[2:08:14] preaching about tithes musicians of you
[2:08:16] come
[2:08:20] we were preaching on tithes
[2:08:23] and we we marveled
[2:08:26] i'd like to sing that song like you
[2:08:27] alone are worthy
[2:08:30] that we're preaching on tithe and we
[2:08:32] were learning how a hundred percent of
[2:08:34] it comes from god
[2:08:36] is that right it all comes from god i'm
[2:08:38] god asking you to return 10
[2:08:40] not of yours but what are he giving you
[2:08:42] of his
[2:08:43] and if he if you give him back that 10
[2:08:46] and
[2:08:47] and offerings that he will bless the
[2:08:49] rest of it
[2:08:51] supernaturally powerfully it was all his
[2:08:53] to begin with
[2:08:55] but if you just obey him he'll bless it
[2:08:58] then i was thinking of the the
[2:09:01] the uh judgment of rewards
[2:09:05] when you stand before the lord and
[2:09:07] you're judged for the deeds done in the
[2:09:08] body and he gives out rewards
[2:09:10] you think what did i do anyways
[2:09:14] i mean i give you back a tithe but you
