lord we love you may you be honored and may you be pleased in all we do this morning in jesus christ's name we pray amen man god bless you while we're standing let's turn to the book of daniel please daniel chapter 2. i want to welcome everybody who's visiting we have a few visitors this morning we say god bless you it's good to have you amongst us there's one visitor in particular special to me and my family my mom was able to make it today so mom's here sister debbie made it up so amen we won't even talk to her until everybody gets to greet her and then we'll take her home and visit with her so you guys can have her in the foyer and we'll take her home and invisible amen god bless you i also want to let you know i just heard this morning from brother moses cherie b moses and mercy and their children are safely back in u.s soil they made it through they're in chicago and they got late last night in chicago they stayed in the hotel they're streaming this morning and they plan to drive home this afternoon so just be praying for them to have a safe drive home and that they can get well rested when they get home this afternoon or evening amen amen i enjoyed the special this morning sister rachel god bless you thank you for that amen let's look at daniel chapter 2 verse 34. thou saw us till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broke into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floor and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth amen you may be seated as we ask the lord to bless the reading of his word stay in daniel 2 because we'll keep tr reading but i'd like to title this this morning the smiting stone is the capping stone and so we spoke a couple sundays back on the stumbling stone is the foundation stone amen so the same stone that causes stumbling is also the same stone that is a sure foundation that keeps you from stumbling amen and this is the way it is with christ because christ is the word made manifest and for some he becomes a stumbling stone the manifested word for the day is what they begin to trip over and fall and it causes the fall amen to stumbling and the tripping but for others amen the manifested word for their day becomes a sure foundation they stand upon to keep them from stumbling so it's it's amazing how this works through the scriptures it's the same manifestation it's the same word it's the same lovely lord jesus christ but it depends on your approach to him amen it depends on who you are and your attitude and your approach to him when he's manifest in the day and age that we live depends on whether to him he's a to you he is a stumbling stone or to you he is a sure foundation your support your anchor your tie amen your your surety against stumbling is christ the manifested word but for some he is the the thing that they're stumbling over so so that's the that's the stone that's the revelation christ excuse me jesus christ is the revelation of god he's the mystery of god revealed he is the stone he is the great revelation of the whole bible the stone the revelation of the entire bible is jesus christ so we we talked about the the stumbling stone is the foundation stone but today i'd like to preach on the smiting stone is the capping stone so you have a foundation stone a sure cornerstone but you also have a capping stone or a headstone and the smiting stone is the capping stone so the very stone that came to cap off his church to seal and secure the bride and finish his bride the headship coming to the body the very thing that completes his bride is also the very thing that destroys all gentile systems in all gentile powers and everything of the word everything of the world that is not of the word is destroyed under this capping stone but some it's a smiting stone for others it's a capping stone so we see here in in daniel chapter 2 verse 34 and thou saw was still that a stone was cut out of the uh cannot without hands which smote the image that's why i call it a smiting stone it is the stone that smote the image upon his feet and we understand that that a rock and a stone in the scriptures is a revelation amen and so there's a there's a revelation coming forth the revelation of jesus christ amen which is the book of revelation the book of revelation starts off the revelation of jesus christ so the book of revelation is not a it's not a doctrine that we study or teachings that all that's included amen but the book of revelation is the capstone it is the headstone it's the capping off of the entire bible and that capping stone is the revelation of jesus christ it's defined right in revelation chapter one so that's the capstone amen but the capstone is also the foundation stone which is what the revelation of jesus christ because brother bam tells us this entire bible is the revelation of jesus christ if you don't find christ in every line he said go back and read it again for you missed something for the entire bible is the revelation of jesus christ so it's all him so he is the smiting stone that is cut out without hands amen would smote the image upon his feet i also want to talk about that cut out without hands for a moment that means there's no human instrumentality involved amen this this revelation that was cut out it didn't come amen even when it comes in the manifestation of flesh it didn't come by the will and the man a man and a woman coming together to create a baby this revelation when it come into flesh of jesus christ was cut out of the stone without hands nobody did this god himself did this and when the revelation came in our day at the end time it wasn't theologians it wasn't doctors of divinity it wasn't a creed or a dogma of a church system no man had anything to do with this christ himself come amen and he come as an angel amen to that prophet every day and gave him the revelation of the seven seals which was the revelation of christ which was the stone cut out of the mountain without hands brother bannon said i had nothing more to do with it than nothing amen i didn't even know these things myself i would have got it wrong if he hadn't come today so this revelation amen that was jesus christ was the was the manifestation of the invisible god god manifest in flesh that was cut out of the mountain without hands and in the end time the capping stone that comes the great revelation of christ is also cut out of the mountain without hands this bible is beautiful friends you know this bible was written for our day the whole thing then it doesn't mean that it didn't have purpose and didn't serve purpose in the day in which prophecies were coming forth and moses he served a purpose in no way he said the purpose of abraham we know that it's always serving a purpose in the day that it's in but the real purpose of this bible amen is to bring us to our day so that we can see christ unveiled in this word in our day in every story in every character amen in everything that's going on it's revealing the great manifestation of jesus christ that was not going to be revealed until the end time so this bible was written for our day because there had to be patterns laid down in the old testament there had to be there had to be stories if you call them stories manifestations through the life of god's children that would depict christ amen you can see christ in joseph you can see christ in moses amen you can see christ amen and all of these characters you can see christ and moses amen because moses come at a time amen when when when there was a promise of a proper child being born amen in the the political leader of that day was going to kill all the babies to get rid of this prophecy well that foreshadowed the coming of christ in the days of herod so you can see christ and moses you can see christ amen and joseph i mean joseph was rejected by his brethren amen he was he was put into prison come out of the prison to the right hand of pharaoh amen signifying the path that jesus christ would take to the throne so these men had to tell the story in their lives amen so that that could be written in the bible so that when we come to the end of time a prophet of god could come back when the revelation of the mystery of god came in our day he could go back and say see it here see it here see it here see it here showing that this bible was written for our day that's why when you look in the bible you see christ everywhere and you see christ and a bride you see you see male and female you see christ and his bride you see the prophet of the age you see and all of these characters you see the end time scene being said and the end time events taking place it is amazing without this revelation you cannot know your bible now i don't say that in a way to offend because you can know greek and you can study the bible you can know the text and you can you can understand the dates and the history and the timelines and you can know the bible but i don't mean that kind of knowing the bible because there's a surface effect of the bible and understanding but there's a deeper understanding of the bible and that deeper understanding is the revelation of christ and you cannot know that without this message you can know the kings that came in order in solomon and when he built the temple and the date and timeline and when jesus was christ was born and what happened to him in his earthly mind you can know all of those things amen but all of those things were displaying a mystery a thought that god had in the back part of his mind from before the foundation of the world and it's that mystery that you cannot get without this message so when i say you cannot know your bible you cannot know the purpose of this bible being here in your day without knowing the message so we see that this stone in daniel 2 that was cut out of the mountain without hands it smote the image in its feet because this image is a type of gentile power gentile world domination from the time of babylon and the head of gold down to the medes and persians the chest and arms of silver down into the greek empire amen with the loins of brass and it moves into the roman empire and the roman empire splits into two legs because we know that roman empire split into two eastern and western and then it begins the iron of that begins to mingle with clay amen begins to mingle into the humanity and into the nations because rome the the political power of rome was broken amen but the spiritual power of rome continues on to today so the political power moved to a spiritual power pagan rome became papal rome and still goes and that intermingled and moved all the way into the feet and out into the feet into the toes when the mountain was come out cut out of the mountain without hands it smote it in the feet because the day that the stone was cut out of the mountain the manifestation of all gentile power spiritual and political was in the feet so it smites it in the present day manifestation of that image which is in the feet showing you when the stone would be revealed the smiting stone would be when you get down to the feet praise god i'm not even planning on preaching this but but brother bannon let's just read i want to read a little bit here uh verse 35 again then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broken to pieces it smites it in the feet but when it hits the feet it breaks the entire image it didn't have to go hit the head and hit the chest and hit it didn't have to all it did was have to hit the feet because all that was in the head moved down into the chest moved down moved down and now is manifest in the feet amen so all has to do is hit it in the present manifestation and it destroys the entire image amen and it be it broke the pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floor and the wind carried them away and no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth a great mountain that filled the entire earth amen this is not a natural mountain this is a kingdom rising up amen and it is a spiritual kingdom that will become a spiritual and natural kingdom in the millennium that will cover the entire world and it is the kingdom of christ so let's go on let's go on down it begins to speak of the different kings it begins to explain the head amen down to the arms and to the to the loins but let's go down to verse 40 when it speaks of the fourth kingdom which is the roman kingdom and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all these these shall it break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potter's clay part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou souls the iron mixed with miry clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is is not mixed with clay in verse 24 and in the days of these kings i want you to take note of that in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to another people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou saw was that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that at break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain in the interpretation thereof sure so when brother branham comes and he begins to explain this image that was in the dream he comes down to the feet and when he gets to the feet it's their special attention drawn to the toes in verse 42 and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be so it's working its way all the way to the toes that's as far as you can go you go from the head all the way down you make the bend at the ankles and you shoot out and as far as you can go is the toes and it's bringing attention to the toes and whereas those saws the irons mixed with my reclay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men and they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed so the days of these kings brother branham gives us the interpretation of this and he points to post-world war ii and in post world war ii when the eastern powers and the western powers come together they were going to come together amen to try to come up with some sort of peace accord and arms agreement and when they did amen there was five nations represented on the west amen with the united states and five nations represented with the eastern countries amen what became later the eastern bloc amen and those five and five were split east and west just like the old roman kingdom was split east and west and those those nations are represented in the toast five and five but brother branham said there was two great toes in that meeting two big toes amen and they they were russia and america represented by eisenhower the president of russia and our of america and and also uh uh the leader of russia was khrushchev and he said khrushchev and eisenhower means clay in iron eisenhower iron khrushchev clay and brother branham took this prophecy and brought it into his day and he said look he said look at those five and five east and west look at the two big toes and the prophecy says it tells us in the days of these kings in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom what kingdom the kingdom of christ amen and he is here the smiting stone is cut out of the mountain the smiting stone has struck this image you say but russia still stands america still stands he'll take care of the natural amen but this is represented in spiritual and unnatural i mean because the power of rome amen moved down spiritually and mingled into every nation through the power of catholicism and mingled into every denomination amen it's been a hold it's got the it's got the iron still mixed in at the strength of the old roman system to hold and to bind and to overpower and to rule over and how is it ruling the spiritual world through the denominations and in the days of those kings amen there was a stone cut out of the mountain that struck that thing at the feet and broke that image for the children of god and scattered it like the chaff in the wind of the summer threshing floor and that thing has no more power on the children of god it has been destroyed by a prophetic message in the end time we're no longer held by denominational ideas we're no longer bound by wondering which one's right and which is correct is he three or is he one do you baptizing titles do you baptize in his name amen what does it mean to be born again we're not stuck in systems and bound and chained down and limited anymore because in the days of these kings there was a kingdom that is established upon this earth in the lives and hearts of the bride of jesus christ and it has broke the power of that system you say well the catholic church still stands my it doesn't stand for me it doesn't stand against me and it has no power to bind me remember the the dream brother branham has in the dream or the vision one i can't remember which it was but he sees people amen they're behind great big bars they're in prison amen and he sees brother borders and brother borders he said come out of there brother borders and brother borders is chained up his head's down and he says i just can't grasp it brother man i just can't grasp it and it was the message that he couldn't grasp he had denominational ideas and he looked at those people and people were moaning and butting their heads against the walls amen and he looked at those bars and he wanted the people to go free but he had no power to free them and there was a in the dream or the vision whichever one it was there was a woman standing next to him which was a neighbor of his and she said brother branham he says you misunderstood these people and they've misunderstood you these aren't bad people these are good people what kind of people were they they were church people stuck in denominations behind the bars just couldn't grasp it just couldn't see just couldn't break free of the denominational teaching and a voice come and said to him set him free and he said i looked at my little arms and i looked at those great big inch thick bars or however many inches he said he said i had no power to free him there's nothing i could do and and the voice came again says free these people and he says house of hell house of hell give way in the name of jesus christ and he said the rumbling and the shaking amen what was it a great earthquake that began to shake the earth amen and the walls came down the chains fell off and the people started going free amen that isn't a neat story that's a literal happening in our day friends amen the word of god came through the voice of that prophet messenger and he was screaming house of hell give way in the name of jesus christ the thing that has plagued god's people all down through time is misunderstanding god through misinterpretation of the word mislocation of the word amen misplacing the word of god has bound the people and kept them separated from the life of god but god in the end time he broke all of that amen there was a revelation a stone cut out of the mountain without hand that destroyed that image amen and i believe with all my heart there will be a physical destroying of the physical remnants of that kingdom and the physical kingdom of the lord jesus christ shall be a mountain that fills the whole earth i believe that with all my heart but i believe it's happening now i believe that kingdom is filling the earth now as the message goes to every corner to every nation to every tongue there is a mountain a kingdom that is being established upon the earth now and that kingdom will never be destroyed praise be to god i haven't got very far these things thrill my heart like nothing else in the world thrills me there's not a ball game an event an accomplishment there's not anything in this world that thrills me like seeing the word made manifest when god's promise comes into manifestation to free his people from the bondage that satan had him and they're now free to be everything that god called them to be that is the most exciting thing that i've ever experienced in my life and all i want is more of it i want more freedom amen i want to be more like christ i want more of the promises in my life i want more manifestations of christ taking place in this flesh i want more freedom but praise be to god so the smiling stone is the capping stone if we review just a couple scriptures here in ephesians chapter 2 verse 19 it says now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the buildings fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of god through the spirit so this this building is to be the temple of god it's on the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone but all that building is fitly framed together means it all must fit the foundation in the cornerstone it's not haphazardly slapped together but it must be fitly joined together means you have to fit to the apostles prophets in the in jesus christ being the chief cornerstone you have to fit the pattern you can't just say i'm i'm part of this building and a stone out of place it must all be fitly joined together it must match the pattern that was laid down and that pattern is is the word of god made manifest first peter chapter 2 verse 6 wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded amen so so the prophecy is saying he's laying in and zion a chief cornerstone or the or the uh uh the the cornerstone and he says he's elect he's precious and he and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded so if you believe on him you're not going to be confused you're not going to be confounded because you're founded on him because you believe in him until you therefore which believe he is precious is he precious to you to you that believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same as made the head of the corner this is an interesting scripture he says now to you that believe he's precious so if you believe he's precious but to those who are disobedient the stone was to which the builders disallowed the same has made the head of the corner so somehow if you believe he's precious but if you disbelieve that same stone that was rejected is going to be made the head of the corner the cornerstone will become the head of the corner and the way this scripture reads that's a bad thing for the disobedience he said do you believe he's precious but you don't believe that stone will become the head of the corner and that will be bad for you the the same the same has made the head of the corner and the stone of stumbling in a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed so this stumbling stone a rock of offense amen is only a stumbling stone on a rock of offense to those that are disobedient amen but to you who believe he's precious so do you believe he's precious he's never a stumbling stone he's not a rock of offense he's precious but to those who disobey he's a stumbling stone and a rock of offense and when he becomes the headstone there's something that's not good for the disobedient him becoming for him to become the head of the corner oh let's look at here luke chapter 20. verse 17 and he beheld them and said what is this then that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder this grind them to powder is a reference all the way back to daniel chapter 2 that we just read this same stone that was the the chief cornerstone is going to become the head of the corner amen and it's the same stone the same jesus christ the revelation of god amen the cornerstone will become the headstone and whoever falls upon this stone will be broken but on whomever this fault the stone falls amen he will be it will grind him to powder so the the option of staying whole when coming in contact with this stone is impossible let's just settle that right now the option of never changing the option of staying forever the way you are when you come in contact with the stone that is an impossibility because only one of two things are going to happen when you come up to this stone amen as a chief cornerstone if you fall down upon that stone you will be broken and after you are broken you can be fashioned amen into his image and you can be fitly placed into that building and be part of the habitation of god but if you do not fall upon that cornerstone and are broken when the headstone comes the headstone will fall upon you amen and it will grind you to powder that is different than broken broken can be mended ground to powder is destroyed so there's two options with this stone there's not a third option there's no other way around this there's no detour there's no divergent amen this steam stone which is the revelation of god the mystery of god revealed is jesus christ this stone which is the manifested word amen it will either break you so you can be conformed into his image or it will destroy you and i say god break me god let me fall upon this word and be broken amen and break me and make me in your very image amen amen i'm going to try to do something here on this thingy here amen if we look at the pyramid if we look at the pyramid the pyramid is uncapped unfinished and then the capstone is actually the completion of the pyramid so the pyramids never finished without the capstone amen but if you look the capstone is the image of the entire pyramid so when you see the capstone you know what the whole pyramid looks like amen so the whole pyramid amen the capstone is the image of the entire pyramid but the pyramid is never finished without the capstone so when the capstone comes down and place itself on the pyramid the pyramid now comes into the image of the capstone the pyramid is never fully in the image of the capstone until the capstone rests upon it when the capstone rests upon it now the now the pyramid is in the image of the capstone now they look the same this is what brother brahm taught us about the end of the church ages and so in the beginning there's a foundation laid here of the apostles and prophets jesus christ being the chief cornerstone so when you have the chief cornerstone when the cornerstone is laid the cornerstone sets the dimensions for the rest of this building the rest of this building builds off the cornerstone without the cornerstone you have no idea how to build the building amen because the cornerstone sets this angle all right it sets the angle on both sides amen so the the the dimensions in the cornerstone are setting the angle of the pyramid and the angle of the pyramid is always building up to the capstone so if you don't build on the cornerstone when it's time for the capstone the capstone will not fit to the building and so the building without the cornerstone can never be capped so it can never come into the image of the capstone and it can never fully reflect the cornerstone because the reflection of the cornerstone is laid in the angles of the cornerstone and as the cornerstone builds and completes it's made manifest by the capstone the capstone is the omega the cornerstone is the alpha so the alpha and omega is jesus christ the alpha laid down the pattern to bring you to the omega ministry so the alpha ministry without that image of god in flesh you would not know what it is like to see god in flesh that was the image of a son of god that was a perfect son of god this is what god's goal was this is his desire amen to be manifest in flesh so he comes into the flesh as a sign he becomes a man he becomes the son the manifested god in flesh which is the cornerstone to show you what it looks like to have god in flesh and without that image you have no idea what the target is that's why we have so many denominations and they've built so many structures i'm speaking spiritually and those structures have nothing listen until brother bantam come along and straighten it out for us amen we were all still thinking of a cube and it was the prophet of god amen it was the prophet of god who could catch the mind of god who could look at the cornerstone ministry and understand that this is not building a cube this is building a pyramid you think of that just in the natural he's able to look at the future home in the dimensions of the future home and by revelation he's going to be able to tell us the actual dimensions of the future home amen how can he do that by revelation but without that revelation you don't even properly understand the cornerstone because if you think the cornerstone was building to a cube shows you don't even have the right revelation of the cornerstone and when the capstone comes as a pyramid to sit on a cube it has no place to rest so denominations i i listen i'm just speaking in type i'm not don't try to make this a natural fade denominations are building cubes cubes cubes of all different shapes and sizes and the capstone can never rest upon a denomination it can only rest on the top of a pyramid that has got its dimensions off of christ the word and as that word is unfolded generation by generation it's coming more and more into the image and it's looking more and more like christ brother talked about the wheat plant it doesn't look like the wheat when it first comes up in luther and wesley but as it moves into pentecost it looks more like the original grain but it's still not the original yet so you come all the way up to the uncapped pyramid it looks like a pyramid it looks more like the cornerstone it looks more like the capsule but not yet quite it cannot resemble the cornerstone it cannot it cannot be the image of what the cornerstone was pointing to until the capstone comes and when the capstone comes it vindicates what the cornerstone was pointing to the alpha and the omega come together to make the hole so praise god amen this is the body the bride this is the headship the headstone says christ head bridegroom it's amazing that the bridegroom is perfect the bridegroom is perfect it's a perfect pyramid but the bride can never become perfect until the headship comes down and when the headship unites with the body then it becomes perfect in the image of the headstone and now the body and the head are the same brother banham taught us we find in the scriptures and everything he was pointing to always is pointing to the same thing the same mystery the same headship the same everything uh if i could say this this is christ the head this is the body this here what is the word this here is the word this here is the complete revelation of the whole thing that's a quote brother brown said christ's life in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing what life his capstone life coming to you makes you the complete revelation this is the message and this is what brother bran was trying to teach us and all the types and all the scriptures and everything that's what he was trying to get us to to understand amen let's let's go on here to this next quote in the message there's a man here that can turn on the light he says may there come forth this great issue of this rock that's cut out of the mountain without hands it'll crush these gentile kingdoms to the ground all these kingdoms spiritual kingdoms and natural kingdoms you catch that so brother branham is not looking for this rock that's cut on the mount with hands just to do the work of destroying russia america you name it but he's also destroying the spiritual kingdoms because these two have their two counterparts parts they're spiritual and natural to this thing so amen so that rock that's cut out of the mountain without hands it'll crush these gentile kingdoms to the ground all these kingdoms spiritual kingdoms and natural kingdoms and the rock will cover the whole earth it'll be a purified affair those who those who that rock crushes will be ground under powder those who fall upon that rock shall have a solid foundation amen this message did not come to destroy you but i say it this way this message came to break you but it is a voluntary breaking sometimes you see people they just don't progress in the message they don't progress in the word and you wonder sometimes why but but so many times we we want god to break us is that true we do i want god to break me all the time but the scripture says all who fall upon that stone there there's a sense of voluntary action and falling upon the stone amen i want to be broken i want to be changed i don't want to go on the way i am anymore i tell you there's a stone here amen there is a stone available and that is jesus christ himself that you by your own will you can throw yourself upon that stone and be broken and let him put you back together the way he wants you put back together but don't wait for the stone to fall on you because when the stone falls on you it's a grinding to powder it's a destruction we want god to do it god to do it god to do it and the truth is there's nothing we can do ourselves we can't fix ourselves we can't make ourselves better we can't make ourselves into the image of christ we absolutely need him to do that but there's one thing i can do and i can say that is nothing but the truth and i'm going to lay myself right here on this word and say god you've got to do the rest there's nothing else i can do but i willingly surrender to the truth of this word and i say this is the foundation stone this is where i want to be planted this is what i want to be built upon not anymore my idea or even my desires amen i don't even want my own desires amen we we have natural desires fleshly desires lust of the flesh and we want them gone but you can't even make them gone but you can get to the point where you don't even want them anymore they're still there your body wants it your body has cravings but you yourself don't even want it anymore that's when it's time to go fall upon the stone amen and be broken upon this revelation of this word be broken upon that word and say god you've got to fit me into your temple you've got a lot of shaving off to do but god you're the only one who can do it but if we keep walking around the stone analyzing judging and maybe right i'm not so sure i i i'm not i'm not a hundred percent confident there's coming a day when everybody will be 100 confident that that's the stone but for most it'll be too late but we've got a golden opportunity right now to fall upon the stone and say god establish me in your word and mold me into your likeness amen sometimes the fact that we can do nothing lends to inactivity it lends to the fact because we cannot make the change we don't do anything but that's not the gospel we cannot make the changes we cannot bring about change in our life we cannot restructure ourselves we cannot even get rid of our own wrong desires but one thing we can do is we can surrender to this word we can acknowledge it's right and surrender to it and claim it right and believe it and give ourselves holy to it with all that's in us we can do that and then he can do above and beyond more than we can ask or think so because we can't do it we don't do anything that's not right either we must surrender to the word amen so these natural and spiritual kingdoms are being destroyed by this rock let's go to zechariah chapter 4 and read together here in zechariah zechariah chapter 4 verse 1. and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that has awakened out of the sleep and said unto me what see us thou and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by and one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and i said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of god unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become acclaimed and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting's crying grace grace unto it remember zerubbabel is bringing the headstone with shoutings of grace grace unto it they're shouting to the headstone grace grace unto it amen so this is a headstone that brings grace verse 8 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying the the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hand shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and see the plummet in the hand as aruba with those seven they are the eyes of the lord which run to and fro through the whole earth those are the seven spirits of god that were in the seven messengers of the church ages and they are with zerubbabel when zerubbabel lays the foundation and finishes this temple brother has some interesting things to say about this and the message of grace we are all acquainted with this scripture that reads the that reads the bible we know that this was during the time of preparation of the restoration of the temple and it's interesting to note what temple was being restored it was solomon's temple the temple that god had given instruction through david david had the instructions for the temple but he wasn't allowed to build it his son had to build it and so this temple that is being rebuilt is the temple that was destroyed in its solomon's temple so i want to take another look over here if we can i hit the button but did it work i'm trying to do this all by myself and brother shimbo shamed me by coming up here and using our technology better than i do and i preach here every week so i've been ashamed of myself since then but solomon built it built a temple we know that moses was given the instructions for the tabernacle and the tabernacle and the temple are spilt in two totally different constructions they're not they they're roughly the same in an outer court in a holy place and a holy of holies they have roughly the same kind of things but there's many many things about these two constructions that are very different in in moses temple there was one one altar one laver one lamp stand one table one altar of incense there was one one one one one and that that tabernacle was very much depicting christ jesus christ but solomon's temple is a mini-membered body solomon's temple is made out of hewn stone stones that are cut and shaped amen off-site and brought and fit perfectly in the place and these stones were not all the same shape they were multitudes of different shaped stones that were all placed together and they re they represent the bride the body of jesus christ the living stones built into a spiritual temple this is what the new testament is referring back to is this temple and you as lively stones that means living stones are built into a spiritual temple so solomon had this and we know that the number 10 in many ways is tied to the church we know there's there's ten virgins five wise five foolish we know that when eliezer went to fetch rebecca he took ten camels when he gave her uh two bracelets she was given two bracelets amen and they totaled ten shekels they were five and five so so we we see this number ten it's it's super interesting even in the day of pentecost after jesus christ ascended they had to wait 10 days so this 10 shows up all the time in the church i don't don't ask me any more questions now i don't fully understand it but 10 is an amazing number in the bible and it's many times separated five and five five wise five voltage even the ten commandments were written on how many tables of stone two so you can surmise how many on wound up on each table ten ten commandments which was the covenant that he made it was amen the ten commandments were a marriage covenant that he made to israel and that marriage covenant showed on two tables five and five so this theme runs through the entire bible so you have five wise and five foolish amen then in solomon's temple it's it's many stones all right so let me come down here many stones representing individuals there's ten laborers five on one side five on the other there's ten lamp stands five on one side five on the other there's 10 tables now i'm not going to go and explain all this because i don't know what it means i'm just pointing it out because it's super it's showing there's something unique about this temple that's different than the tabernacle and the number that's associated with the church keeps showing up in solomon's temple all the time and it's what's referred to by the new testament uh uh writers when they're referring back to living stones a habitation of god you as stones fit together it's referring to the temple but i want to look at who built it solomon needs means peace so the prince of peace built this built this temple he is also the son of david the son of david and he's also son of god so was there anybody else that was the prince of peace the son of david and the son of god that built a temple solomon is a type of jesus christ and jesus christ built a spiritual temple and you and i are stones in that spiritual temple so now in zechariah we know solomon's temple amen was destroyed by babylon babylon came in and babylon is a type of the false church it's a type of the catholic system which becomes the mother of the great the mother of harlots and it and it types the denominational systems so solomon's temple amen that was instructed constructed by solomon who's a type of jesus christ all of this great imagery that temple was destroyed by babylon does this sound familiar because god's great temple that that he filled jesus christ filled on the day of pentecost amen there were many stones amen and he filled that temple he filled that temple on the day of pentecost amen but it fell into ruin because babylon destroyed it but now zechariah is speaking of a group that's coming out of babylon going back to jerusalem and now zerubbabel is the governor the great prince that is now in charge of rebuilding this temple again not a new temple solomon's temple rebuilt that's important to note that it's it's not a new temple it's new in the fact that the first was destroyed but it's built in the same place it's a rebuilding of the temple so let's get back to what brother branham was saying here we're all acquainted with the scriptures that reads the bible you know that this is during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple so not a new temple a restoration of solomon's temple and zerubbabel was a great prince among the people who had laid the foundation of the building now you i want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointed anointing jacket this morning as we think so brother benham told us amen don't take this for face value he's saying i want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning all right let's go on because we've got to think spiritually now this morning as we think and this great prince had determined to rebuild the house of the lord and then when he did he had laid the foundation stone and as we read on farther we find out that god said zerubbabel has laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring forth the headstone i want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone he shall bring forth the headstone and we know the scripture says that jesus is the chief cornerstone and he's also the headstone now if we will think for a few minutes the seventh church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit so who is the rubable typing amen he's typing the seventh angel the seventh church aged messenger coming out of babylon who will rebuild the original temple again amen it's a restoration amen it's the restoration of all things not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord not by organization not by denomination but by the holy spirit god will bring forth the church in the last days so you see why brother ben said put on your spiritual anointing jacket because the whole bible was written for our day zerubbabel the prince with joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone he had laid the foundation he took the people back to the foundation in type so it says zerubbabel the prince with joshua joshua has the same meaning as jesus joshua of the old testament it means jesus and the new even even in the new testament when they're referring to joshua's ministry they call him jesus because those two names have the same meaning so zerubbabel the prince with joshua he's not doing it himself he's doing it with joshua which was the high priest and i asked you brother branham wasn't doing this himself he was the prince that god was using the seventh angel but there was one that was with him and that was the high priest joshua jesus was with zerubbabel in our day they were working together to rebuild the temple praise be to god this bible after the opening of the seventh seal this bible has become a new book the word was written for our day now i want to take a look at solomon's temple if you go with me back to second chronicles i want to look at a few scriptures here and then we'll move on second chronicles chapter 5. i referred to this wednesday and something brother stephen schimbot said to me and i went back and i and i found it second corinthians chapter 5 and verse 11. second chronicles take me for what i mean not for what i say second chronicles chapter 5 verse 11 this is solomon in the building of the temple and you've got it built now come the day of dedication when they bring the ark in second chronicles 5 and 11. and when they bring the ark in it's a type of the word coming into its place and when the word comes into its place always something wonderful happens uh second corinthians 5 11 and it came to pass when the priests were coming out of the holy place because they just put the ark down for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by course also the levites which were the singers all of them asap of hermann judith and with with with their sons and their brethren being arrayed in white linen having symbols and sultries and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them 120 priests sounding with the trumpet so the only number that's given here there's other people doing other things the only number that's given they don't number the priest they don't number the singers the only number they give is the number of those who are sounding the trumpet and the ones who are sounding the trumpet are 120. this is what uh um brother shimbo mentioned to me the number 120 and i went back and i found it here i thought it was interesting it's not the total number of priests but it's the number of those that are sounding the trumpet trumpeting priests and so then 120 priests sounded with trumpets it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord i want you to catch these words amen when they were as one to make one sound to be heard and praising and thanking the lord and then they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praised the lord saying for he is good and his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled with the cloud even the house of the lord so that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of god this is a this is a foreshadow of the day of pentecost amen i think it's interesting the way it's written let's go to the book of acts now let's turn to acts chapter 1. all of this matters and it all means something acts chapter 1 verse 13. this is the inauguration or i would say the anointing of the new temple the the temple that is going to be now in the believers where god the shekinah glory of god is going to live within these veiled walls in within these living stones and this is the inauguration this is going to be the the anointing day amen is very much like solomon after he put the word into place amen the things that happened there but let's look here verse 13 and when they were come in they went up into an upper room and their abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon zealots and judas the brother of james these all continue with one according prayer and supplication with the women and mary and the mother of jesus with his and with his brethren and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of names together were about 120. now it's interesting it says about 120 it doesn't mean that it was necessarily 120 it could have been 121 it could have been 119 but there was an important number so it didn't worry i didn't worry about whether it was 119 121 122. that number had to be laid in there there were 120 because we've got 120 new trumpeters who are going to trumpet a new message amen this number 120 is interesting because when god was going to destroy the world in the flood he comes down and gives man 120 days to complete before destruction comes said my spirit shall not always strive for man for his thoughts are wicked and it'll be 120 days and so noah preached 120 days and at the end of 120 days they went into the ark of safety and destruction came also moses was 120 years old when he died so he died moses who was the lawgiver who brought him to the border to the border line but could not take them across he came because the law could never take you all the way in so he came he was born of the liver from the time the deliverer was born until he died was 120 years and after 120 years then they could move into the promised land so this number 120 is super interesting because it's passing from the law into the promises moses dies they cross jordan in the 120th year from the birth of the deliverer all of this symbology is so important the bible doesn't throw out numbers and throw out things just to throw them out and we may not fully be able to comprehend the full depth and meaning of that but we can start to see there's something there amen there's something that he's doing he wants us to see 120. he's taking us right back to the only number of priests that were given there was priests doing this and priests doing that but none of them were numbered only 120 trumpeting priests and now we come to the day of dedication the anointing is going to fall to anoint a new temple and that new temple is going to be the believers on the day of pentecost and when it falls there's about 120. they're moving from law to grace moving from the law of moses into what moses was pointing to the grace of god beginning to move into the promised land it's always taking place then brother branham says in the message dedication of a building to the lord he's preaching a dedication of a church he said when israel had finally made one place that they could all dwell in come to a place and meet god under the fellowship of the blood then they begin to sing with joy he's referring back to solomon's temple they began to play the harp they praised god with such one accord until it sounded like one voice of singing he's referring right back to the scriptures we just read in second chronicles then solomon stood to pray and to make the dedication to the lord and when he did that remember the ark had already been brought in under the wings of the cherubim and set back in the holy place but when the people dedicated not the church not the building but when the people got with one accord and prayed with one accord and sang with one accord and everything is of one accord then the holy spirit in the form of pillar of fire moved into the building and settled upon the place and there was so much glory in that building until the priest could not minister anymore let's look at acts chapter 2 verse 1. now how many days were they waiting from the time jesus ascended until this day 10 days because there's a number associated with the church and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting this is this is going right back to the dedication of solomon's temple when the anointing came to end it says they were all with one accord exactly like they were playing all with one voice in the day of solomon's dedication and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty went and it filled all the house where they were they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance praise god what did they do they went bursting amen brother bannon said out of the upper room into the street amen and could not even speak their language anymore amen they were so under the anointing they couldn't minister in the usual way now they were trumpeting in a new way so this shows that there was an anointing that came for the new temple are you with me the newt the what solomon was pointing to solomon even says in ii chronicles if you go back and read it when solomon's dedication prayer he speaks to god and he says god i have built this as a habitation for you to dwell in for ever forever but that temple was destroyed then when it was rebuilt then that was destroyed and herod's temple was built over it then that was destroyed and then the next temple that they built for the millennium will be ezekiel's temple and it doesn't exactly match the dimensions of solomon's temple but solomon said i've built this for you forever so is he talking about that structure or is he talking about the one it's pointing to the structure was to be a forever habitation of god almighty a dwelling place a house for god to dwell in forever it wasn't those stones it was these stones it was the stones that were anointed amen as the habitation the dwelling place of the shekinah glory of god on the day of pentecost that temple was anointed on that day praise god brother baby says in the six-fold purpose of gabriel's visit to daniel he said now when zerubbabel dedicated his temple after it was rebuilt it was not anointed again catch this it was not anointed again because it was already been anointed and been tore down or it was just instructed again and destruction had come to it and had been instructed again and put up so there was no anointing of it anymore when it was one time anointed that carried on through and it goes on to this very time when zerubbabel finished that temple he didn't have to anoint it again it was already anointed but when the temple was finished the presence of god came back because he had already anointed that to be the temple amen in our day when zerubbabel had finished and put the capstone on amen the presence of god came back into his temple because he already anointed that in these people that believe my word shall be the temple my dwelling place the house of the shekinah glory of god didn't need a new anointing amen just needed to rebuild what had been tore down by babylonian religion and when it come back into place and the capstone came on and the word was restored and the ark was back in its place then the presence of god came back and filled the temple again but if it was showing it didn't need another anointing amen they'll come another anointing because moses when moses tabernacle was completed the pillar of fire came and it was anointed when solomon's temple was erected amen and completed amen the pillar of fire came down and filled the house with a cloud of smoke amen and anointed it and it carried all the way through the next anointing will be in the millennium under the millennial temple when christ and his bride return together and jesus christ goes to the holy of holies and anoints the most holy place showing that the tabernacle was anointed the temple was anointed then the the place for the bride and the bridegroom will be anointed and then we know that jesus christ was anointed on the river we know that the bride anointing came on the day of pentecost but in the millennial reign there's another one coming when they return together [Music] so when was this temple when was this temple anointed on the day of pentecost and it continued all the way through although the spirit would become bound by my denominational rivers it would be limited by false teaching it was still the same spirit that was moving the true bride through in every age it was still the same anointing that was giving revelation to the church age messengers and carrying it out amen through the true ministries in that day and the true believer it was still the same anointing that fell at pentecost that was moving the church all the way through the church ages but it had to come back to a full measure again in the end time praise god now i want to look at another picture here because we know that brother branham says when you put your when you put your spiritual anointing jacket on he wants to show you that the seventh angel was working in the ministry of zerubbabel to rebuild that temple that had been destroyed by babylon and what temple was destroyed by babylon the one that was anointed on the day of pentecost babylonian religious systems had destroyed that original temple amen and had fallen to ruin but there was coming a time when that temple was going to be rebuilt again under the ministry of zerubbabel with joshua the high priest and zerubbabel will lay the foundation of it and he would bring the headstone but i just want to show you this picture this is brother branham laying the cornerstone to branham tabernacle i think it's a blessing that we have this picture because i want to i want to show you a pattern brother branham does things in the life of a prophet the life of that prophet becomes a ver it begins to speak the very word he begins to flesh out the very word for his day and the very actions of the word begin to manifest in his life and here we have brother barry talks about this so many times laying the cornerstone when i laid the cornerstone he even put a prophecy of a vision he had in that cornerstone when he laid the cornerstone we're going to talk about that but i'm so thankful we have a picture of this because we know the ministry of zerubbabel must lay the foundation stone and bring the headstone and here comes a picture of the prophet of god laying a cornerstone i say thank you god this is symbolic and we know that this is just an earthly building that tabernacle is not but it means something spiritually he says now i want to read some scriptures before we have a dedication of prayer what message is this god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same this is the beginning of the seals brother branham now has gone out west he got caught up in a constellation of seven angels and that clown and we told him to come back east for the opening of the seven seals now he comes back this is the set of meetings when there's going to be the opening of the seven seals he's already been caught up into the headship he's already been caught up into the constellation of angels into the capstone now he's coming back amen what's he doing he's going to be bringing the headstone in through the opening of the seals but what happens to the branham tabernacle just before the seals are preached amen there's a reconstruction project that takes place they they expand it amen they expand the tabernacle even so much they couldn't use it amen and sometimes for some meetings so there's a reconstruction expanding amen a remodeling you could say a reconstruction of the branham tabernacle and now when the when the restructuring rebuilding the remodeling is completed now he comes to this service amen which is the first service in the week that he's preaching the seals after he's got caught into the constellation of angels out in arizona and come back to preach the opening of the seals and he says now i want to read some scriptures before we have the dedication prayer and then it's just a rededication because the real dedication happened 30 years ago there's a pattern being laid out by the very life of the prophet showing that we're coming to the rededication the headstone is coming but this temple that's been destroyed it was already dedicated it was already anointed on the day of pentecost further on he says now i think it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of god to be so grateful to god that that this will not just be a beautiful building that will come to you but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristics of jesus christ and every person that comes in may it be a consecrated place for our lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people i trust it will always be a house of god of beauty now he's not talking about the physical now he's talking about the spiritual church now in the dedication service of the original cornerstone being laid a great vision came and it's wrote in the cornerstone the morning i dedicated it so brother man was talking about the laying of the cornerstone as the the original dedication and there was a prophecy that was laid in that cornerstone and he said you might have wondered a few minutes ago he's the same quote why i was so long coming out my first duty as i come into the new church i married a young man and woman standing listen friends nobody can put this stuff together nobody can make this up amen my first duty is coming into the new church it wasn't a new church it was a reconstructed church that had already been dedicated 30 years ago when they laid the foundation stone and without a prophecy in the foundation and now he comes into the new church for they're having a rededication because it was already dedicated amen and the completion of the church and he said my first duty in the new church is i married a young man and woman standing in the office may it be a type that i'll be a loyal minister to christ to get a bride ready for the ceremonies of that day every step this man took was anointed was directed of god amen it was laying down a picture to us so we'd see the scriptures we'd see his life we would see the supernatural we'd see it all and god made this so obvious that you have to intentionally be blind to miss it [Applause] that you say oh well that was circumstances yeah that about 10 000 others odd circumstances [Applause] you can look at somebody's life and they can try to make something spiritual in their life i've heard people do it over and over and over again and you can say i could have or couldn't have been and maybe it was and maybe somebody over spiritualized something but when it happens tens of thousands of times eventually you throw your hands in the air and say that man's life is under an anointing and god is directing his very footsteps the words are coming out of his mouth the sermons that he's preaching the order of events in his life is all taking place for a reason so that we would have no excuse that god would so reveal himself to his bride that we would see it in the manifestation of the supernatural we would see it in the very construction of the life of the prophet we would see it in the manifestation of the word amen that there's that god is vindicating vindicating vindicating vindicating oh praise of god he says and now let us do as we did at the beginning maybe at the day of pentecost now let us do as we did at the beginning we started at the first dedication of church i was just a young man maybe 21 22 years old when we laid the cornerstone it was before i was even married and i was always wanted to see a place correctly in order for god to worship with his people and we can only do that not by a pretty building but by a consecrated life is the only way we can do it this is something that brother branham preached in the end the very end of 1962 after the visions came those six dreams and then the vision amen that he was going to go out west and god had showed him amen those constellations uh he saw the consolation little birds the constellation of bigger birds and then the angels come in his room a week before this about eight days before this happened and he comes to the church to explain it and tell him why he's going out west because the six dreams capped by the vision is all sending him out west and he goes if this year doesn't settle he said i'm going out west i'm going to try there if i don't go there i'm going to go here i'm going to go there he wants god he knows god's calling him out west he knows there's a revelation coming but he doesn't know how so if this year doesn't settle it the next year without water or food i'll walk out into the desert and i'll wait till he calls me i can't go on like this you've got to get desperate you've got to get to a place where you want to know what's the will of god and how can you do the will you you don't know the will i'm pragging because of that vision background what you did see going around as a missionary in evangelism until that call come remember the first one when we laid the cornerstone now he's pointing back to the cornerstone do the work of an evangelist he said didn't say you was an evangelist but do the work of one perhaps until the time come for something else another change of work might be something different i don't know the prophecy in the cornerstone was do the work of an evangelist and brother bannon says not that i was an evangelist but do the work of the vengeance maybe until something other come so there's a prophecy in the cornerstone that is pointing to the coming of the headstone you catch that even physically in branham tabernacle there's a prophecy laying in the cornerstone that is pointing to the coming of the headstone here he says in 1963 questions and answers on the seals he's preaching this saturday morning or sunday morning on the week that he preaches the seals he says now if you watch when i laid the cornerstone under the tabernacle he said do the work of an evangelist and now the hour's coming when the work is separated there's something else taking place now i did the work of an evangelist pointing to this time but when we come to this time something else is taking place what is it it's the work of a prophet now not the work of an event it's the work of a prophet so let's go to first kings chapter 18 and look at this first kings chapter 18. first kings chapter 18 and i'm going to begin at verse 30. and this is elijah in the showdown of mount carmel and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down so the first thing elijah did in the mount carmel showdown is he went back and repaired the altar of the lord that had been broken down because he's got to build back the worship he's got to bring back the church because the elijah in this day has to do the same thing first he's got to rebuild the altar rebuild the proper way of worship and so verse 31 and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the son of jacob whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name so elijah in this day is is preaching to the israelites and the israelites are known by the number 12 12 is their completion it's all of their tribes it's the entire nation so he takes 12 stones and brings the altar back together amen but the elijah in our day doesn't take 12 stones he takes seven because he's preaching to a gentile church and the number of completion for the gentile church is seven seven ages so he rebuilds he goes back and rebuilds the altar of seven church ages amen praise be to god and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill full four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice so in the evening time because now brother branham says we're moving from doing the work of evangelist to something else now we know it's the prophetic ministry it's the elijah ministry he said in the evening sacrament is the evening time that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word elijah didn't do anything on his own what he did was according to the word of the lord hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and thou has turned their heart back what was the ministry of elijah to do to turn the hearts of the fathers back to the children or by the heart to the children back to the fathers and he said lord let it be known that thou has turned their heart oh i love the language of the bible amen i love when the seals come off of the book and it becomes a new book and you can see exactly what brother branham did in this day is exactly what was done before elijah had to do this in this day so that we would come to our day and recognize the prophet and what he's doing in our day for this bible was written for our day god has laid this ministry and god has laid amen this end time all through the scriptures friends amen he turned their heart back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not one of them escape and they took the took them and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon and slew them there so what happened in elijah's ministry elijah rebuilt the old altar the old worship amen he brought him back to the original when he brought him back to the original now it's time he you could say this way he laid the foundation and called for the fire to come because he rebuilt the he rebuilt the altar but under his ministry it wasn't just the rebuilding the altar it was also the coming of the fire that would consume it all so in his ministry he rebuilt and the fire fell because in brother branham's ministry he rebuilt and the fire of the holy ghost fell so now and then he says let it be known that you did this that you're going to turn their hearts back again and the fire fell and it was the destruction of the prophets of baal it came elijah's ministry also under his ministry was the destruction of the prophets of baal because under this capstone ministry it's the destruction of the religious systems of the day he says let not one of them escape and under this capstone ministry there is not one denomination that can escape you can say well the mennonites are pretty good and well that one's not too bad i'm telling you under this elijah ministry there is not one denomination that will escape they have all taken the thoughts of man they have all compromised on the word every man that comes up with anything has amen the nature of man comes into anything that man makes amen and it will not take the whole word so god has had to destroy all systems of man and bring back his word and this word is the vessel of destruction that is destroyed and smitten all the kingdoms of the religious kingdoms of this world amen and rose into a mighty mountain that is now filling the earth it is the ministry of christ the capstone praise be the god so that's why brother banham i love that picture of him laying the cornerstone because of that quote about zerubbabel but i also love this picture the coming of the headstone the capping of the pyramid the capstone the headship coming down to the body because the ruble bull has laid the foundation he's rebuilt he built back the church and we know that the church had been built over seven church ages we understand that but there was all kinds of things mixed in with it and you couldn't see it clearly but under this ministry he came back and he showed it he took everything else out of the way and showed you the proper order of the seven church ages and the truth through each one and the movement of god through each one and he built it back so that you could see it but he wasn't just going to build it back under his ministry there was going to be a capping of it and the capstone came the man says like the pyramid come up through luther wesley pentecost and then the capping of the stone he says and that's exactly when the church in the word has to be one like jesus and god was one just exactly god has god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and so will christ have to be in the church the anointing of the word to make everything fulfilled and that's the capstone what is it christ in his church that's the capstone that comes upon the last church age i want you to catch what he said god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and so will christ have to be in the church the anointed of the word to make everything fulfilled and that's the capstone christ in the church is the capstone and that's the capstone that comes upon the last church age not the laodicea now it's a calling out of that a bride out of a church a church out of a church and otherwise just like he called a nation out of a nation in egypt we see this picture brother branham goes to this quote i'll go to this quote next but i like the black and white picture it may be hard to see on the screen i don't know how easy it is but when you when you get this picture at home you can begin to see in the shadows you can see jesus's forehead you can see the two eyes the nose and brother brown keeps referencing his black beard you see his black beard and and this is what he says about this picture he says well if you'll turn the picture like this and look you can probably see it from the audience he had this this voice come to him one day and he's looking at this picture of this cloud you know somebody's giving him the picture and the picture says turn it right or the voice says turn it right he said i'm looking at it right like this is the way it was taken he said he said i thought maybe he meant to the right so he turned it to the right and there it was he said i could see the face of christ in the cloud looked like hoffman's head of christ and now he's telling the audience if you'll turn the picture like this and look you can probably see it from the audience it's christ see his eyes looking here just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and earth why because that smiting stone is the judgment stone it is the stone that passes judgment on the kingdoms of this world both spiritual and physical and first it destroys the spiritual and it will destroy the physical the judge of all the earth can you see his eyes his nose his mouth the congregation says amen just turn the picture this the way that they had it this away the way it's supposed to be praise god can you see it he's he is supreme judge there is none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a vindication that this message is the truth this is the truth it is true i make him making him not a third person but the only person madam said that capping stone that come down that was the completion that was the headship that was the word that was the fullness coming down to unite with the body with the church amen and those two together make it the capsule in the capstone ministry and brother banham took that picture one day and was told directed by the spirit to turn it to the right and there he saw the very face of christ wigged in the white wings of those angels showing that he was the supreme judge that he was coming down now as a judge amen is he coming now as a judge and you say oh that's a bad thing no that's a good thing because i'll come back to this picture here this stone here is the judging stone because when that stone comes if it doesn't fit on the top of that pyramid then you did not build according to the foundation in the chief cornerstone you've got the word off somewhere and that stone won't fit so when that stone comes it is the judging stone and wherever the word is not constructed right it'll destroy it it'll tear out false concepts false notions false doctrines it'll grind them to powder but where it does find a fit it judges the fit see so many times we say we don't we don't want the judgment of god but you know what if god is judging me righteous i want the judgment of god because you have to in order to be found guilty or innocent in order to be found righteous or unrighteous you have to have somebody who will judge somebody has got to judge whether you're righteous or unrighteous whether you're a son of god or not a son of god somebody has to pass the judgment and who's going to pass the judgment jesus christ himself amen the headstone has come down in judgment amen whoever fell upon this cornerstone will be built into the image of christ and he can cap off their life amen but whoever this stone when it becomes the head of the corner falls upon it'll grind them to powder and the headstone is the judging stone is the proving stone proving that when brother branham rebuilt this church amen when he rebuilt this order when he put the seven stones of the seven church ages back together and said this was the first church eighth messenger this was the second this was the third this is how long they lasted this is what they taught this is what the true teaching was here's all the loose ends if they would have got here if they would have kept preaching they would have been here here's the complete picture amen what is the vindication that that prophet was right amen it is that cloud in the sky coming down is the vindication that that prophet was right [Music] and you wonder why somebody wants amen to discredit that clown of course they want to discredit that cloud amen but that clown brother bam said is the vindication that this message is the truth amen brother banham says he says there is none other but him and that is perfect i'm going in the yellow highlighted that is a perfect identification again a vindication that this message is the truth how do you know because the judge came and when the judge came he vindicated that prophet's message and the judge himself has put his seal of approval on the message of brother branham and how dare anybody take away from that message how dare anybody diminish what he taught or take away from what he taught god himself came down and vindicated it with the capstone he says can you see his head his eyes his nose his mouth you know you can take this picture and if you get it you know in the right shade and print it on good paper you can really see it even more distinctly and you can show it to somebody and you can get them to see yeah i see that there's eyes there's a black beard i see that but they could see that and still not see it because you've got to see who has come the judge the white wig one has come and when he come he judged this message to be the truth and when he judged this message to be the truth he judged all other to be wrong we do not preach a message that everybody's okay and everybody this and that no we preached a message that this is the ark of safety this is the vindicated word this is the place that he's come and sealed and vindicated that this is the truth and when that judge come down and said this is right he said all other denominational systems is wrong come to the truth come to the capping stone brother madam said and the other day standing there turned the picture to the right and there is jesus as he was in the seven church ages the white wig on showing supreme deity he's alpha omega he's the first the last he is the supreme judge of all eternity standing there confirm the message of the hour and there shall be light about the evening time brother branham was not afraid that the judge had come and he was happy that the judge had come and i said god make me happy that the judge has come amen i don't want to fight against that i don't want to push against that i don't want to fear the judge i say i'm falling on the judgment stone amen i'm falling on the cornerstone break out of me everything that won't pass the judgment form into your image so that you can cap me and judge me your child judge me righteousness by the faith that you've given me amen not righteous by deeds will never make righteousness by deed you probably can't get through a day doing it right not enough that god would judge you righteous for your deeds but he doesn't judge you righteous for your deeds he judges righteously for your faith and your faith dictates your deeds brother man goes on to say oh brother listen what time are we living in what's the age what's the hour that we're in it's not time for these things that are it's it's not time for these things that we're talking about that's past judgment is on hand now you can see it breaking you remember the rock up of the mountain that's when he threw the rock in the air started to roar and went on struck alaska and there was a giant earthquake that hit that's what he's referring to he says judgment hour hey friends judgments upon the earth judgment has come judgment has stricken the stone that was cut out of the mount without hands has come and has smote the image in his feet in the days of these kings it has happened amen it is history it's happened it's happening to individuals right now [Applause] the judge the supreme judge of all heaven and earth is here amen the judge of all eternity is here the supreme deity of jesus christ is here and he's come as a judge and brother branham was not afraid of that judge [Music] because that judge was standing to vindicate his message i said god mold me in your word that i'm not afraid of the judge how can you not be afraid of the judge brother chad this is the judge of all heavens and earth listen it's not because i can look at myself and say i've got it right i'll stand before that judge because if i look in the mirror the natural mirror look at the natural man i'll always be afraid to stand before that judge but i'm not looking at the natural mirror i'm looking at the mirror of the word and what he said what he said about me and what he said in this day and the faith that he's given me to believe it amen and i know it's the truth and i know it applies to me as unworthy as i am and undeserving as i am and incapable i am of living it right every day it doesn't matter something in me still says it's the truth i know it's the truth i believe it to be the truth and i believe i'm part of it on my worst day i'm still part of it i shouldn't be amen but i am amen it doesn't make sense to the carnal mind but i'm not thinking with the carnal mind something in me says oh god i've fallen on the rock of this word and i believe every bit of it to be true even the parts i failed on i still believe it's true mold me in your image take away my fear of the judge because all the judge has come to do is to cap off my faith amen and to show that i am a son of god capping it off by this great revelation that's come at the end time that christ has come to unite with a bride the shekinah glory of god is back in the restored temple again amen the judgment is on on hand now you can see it breaking you remember the rock up on the mountain judgment hour you remember the revelation or the vision of the bride just keep her in step don't let her get out of step that word has come through a prophet and the prophet in the in the vision was yelling get back in line get back in line what is it it's the voice of the messenger constantly trying to keep us in step with the word amen we're constantly coming to that prophet and how many of you can say he's constantly yelling in my ear get back in line every day i hear a message i hear i mean i listen to the tape i read a book i come to service i can hear that voice screaming get back in line get back in line why the judge is here you're passing the review stand he's looking for a bride and the prophet of the hour and the prophet of god brought the word of the hour that will keep us in line so that we can pass the review stand not by our merits not by our deeds but our faith in this word and our obedience to this word gives us the right to stay in line by the voice of that messenger keeping us in line so that we can pass that review stand amen what do you do without this word you have no place to go how do you stand the judgment of this hour without this message there's no place to go we've got to fall upon this stone or this stone will fall upon us brother the bible says now the word the word of god will judge every person this word that's been preached here this morning it's being preached down here at wall street preached over here at the christian church down excuse me down at the presbyterian church wherever the word is being preached it becomes the judgment so when you preach the full word the full judgment is present men are judged by the word of god and here's one good thing to know that either our judgment goes before us or it will follow after us but you won't escape it i say god let me fall on the stone so that my judgment goes before me but not coming after when the stone falls on me and the message the contest brother bannon is preaching this is the last message he preaches in 1962 and we know when he comes into 1963 he's coming into the seals he preaches the evening after he preached serves as this the time in the morning so this is his new year's eve message and he comes to the contest and he says make us fit servants forgive our past bless our future guide us o lord god with thy mighty hand jehovah bless these ministers here bless all the laity all the visitors be thou with us lord we are your servants and we give ourselves holy to you for 1963 that the power of your spirit might have more preeminences in our life and in our being help us forgive help us god forgive us and help us we pray raise up mighty men raise up mighty warriors of the faith open this year lord that hidden manna that rock beneath the rock amen was 1963 going to be the year that he opened the rock beneath the rock yes because in sydney jackson's dream there was a rock and on the outside of the rock there was an interpretation of the word that he was going but he grabbed something out of the air a sharp object and tore the top off of that mountain and there was a white rock underneath that never light shined on before unwritten word the revelation of the seven thunders which was the seals and here brother bran was preaching the last message in 1962 and he's saying lord open this year lord that hidden manna did god answer his prayer yes that rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of god what was the revelation of the seven thunders for so that we could see the program of god so that we wouldn't be blind so that we wouldn't misunderstand so that we can see what god's been trying to do along the program of god amen that he had a program in his mind before the foundation of the world but that we might see the rock under the rock so that we might catch the program of god and see our place fit into the program so that we might have faith and we might be able to stand in the day of judgment and how will you be able to stand in the day of judgment knowing that as he is i am in this world this is how love is perfected he says that we might see the program of god cap off the pyramids of our life put the capstone jesus christ upon each and every one of us may his great magnificent holy blessing be upon us all may the fire of the holy ghost come upon us may the power of the resurrection be manifested god how we thank you tonight we are yours we give ourselves fully to you lord when brother ben was talking in 1962 coming to 1963 he knows what what he's going out west for he knows the vision he's seen he knows what the dreams are pointing to and even he's referencing the dream of junior jackson he says show us the hidden manna the rock beneath the rock that we might know the program of god but in all of that he's not saying give us understanding give us bible truths what is he saying he said cap off our lives let it be to each individual that this word will be the judging stone the capping stone the completion of our spiritual life that we will unite with jesus christ and his life will be manifest through each one of us may the capstone jesus christ put the capstone jesus christ upon each and every one of us he says the lutherans under justification the fee raised it like that wesley under sanctification the pentecost under the arms the works and the deeds and so forth had to be calvinist or be armenian and had to be legalists but now we come to the head the capstone grace grace the capstone cried the headstone crying what grace grace passed from death and creed into a living word of a living god god's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off something to make it alive and seated now in heavenly places in present tense already alive and subject to every promise in the word then what then what does that you being part of god's gene a part of the word other men are part of god's word seated together manifest the entire body of christ because there's no leaven among you you mean we'll have we're coming to perfection with no sin he's not saying you won't make mistakes and you personally yourself may not sin but he's saying there's no leaven among you he's kicked out all the false teachings of the denominations all the leaven that leavened the love he told his disciples beware of the leaven of the of the pharisees and be aware of the leaven of the herodians and beware of the leaven of the sadducees and they thought he was talking about bread and he was talking about a spiritual leaven that corrupted and the word of god has come the judges come with the word to push the leaven out of us so we'd no longer be doubting how to be saved how to be baptized what is the baptism the holy ghost how many gods are there amen which church to go to all of that has been pushed out and we're here to manifest the entire body of christ and that is the end jesus has come as the great headstone to cap off our lives the alpha and the mega amen the anointing fell at pentecost amen but it was bound by denominational rivers but is loosed in the evening time the holy ghost back in the church again the headstone has come amen so that the presence of god can come back to the church in full measure once again this is the restoration of the temple of god it is the workers ruble he laid the foundation he brought the headstone with joshua the high priest and i say how many can stay with me go on cap my life with jesus christ i don't want this word we can say the church's cat praise god the church is capped and what was the capping of the church it was the adoption of the church as a bride she had come to full maturity and to adoption to marriage time that was for the whole church but what about you as an individual you're an individual part of this but the individual comes and falls upon the cornerstone the individual is built into a lively stone into a habitation of god and the individual is capped off in an adoption to be whatever christ is in this earth he is in me it's not just the church it's you i said lord i'm falling upon your stone i'm falling on your word molding me make me match that word so the dimensions come out right in my life make me fall on this cornerstone and shatter me lord amen so you can put the right dimensions back together so that i could be formed to fit into your program not my program your program word by word shaped me shave me down chisel me out as you would shape a stone and fit me into place and cap off my life with your life that you might have a vessel you can have preeminence in and you might have a living stone that you can live through i say now that whatever brother brandon was praying for 1963 i'm praying for 20 22. cap off our lives put the capstone of jesus christ on everyone so that we would be the very image of christ let the proving stone prove our life let the proving stone prove that we fell on the stone [Music] and that we've accepted the word that we believe the word and let us not fear the judging stone anymore but let the judging stone of this word prove that i'm a believer in that word let it not be your judging stone into condemnation but let it be your judging stone unto righteousness saying whatever that is i believe with all of my heart not something i work myself up to but something that's coming from within that i believe when brother ben says turn it to the right can you see his face can you see his head his eyes you see his nose can you see his beard something in you does not just need to see the shadows in a picture of a cloud but you see him that comes from within and you recognize this is the one that i want to cap my life this message is what i want to be identified as this is who i want to be one with this message i'm done with my ideas i'm done with man's ideas i'm finished questioning whether the message is right or not i've seen enough to stop questioning and to throw myself down on the stone of the word and say god break me break doubts away from me break confusion away from me break all those other things that i've heard to break it all away from me i am convinced this is true and i'm done questioning and i'm ready to be broken god i'm falling upon your stone put me back together the way i was supposed to be when i was in your thought before the foundation of the world build me up into your image and cap me with your very life and live through me i'm done living for myself i recognize this message is true and that judgment stone i want to come and judge me but when you come and judge me you've put something down inside of me that you're going to find that there's a son and daughter of god here judge me your son judge me your daughter o great god of heaven amen god bless you saints let's all stand the musicians will come and brother john if you'll come i can't imagine how we can be a more privileged people i can't imagine how in any way that we could have it better than we have it now and i i'm not looking at our earthly situations we may have afflictions and things that torment our flesh we may be dealing with thorns in our flesh in difficult circumstances that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about the stone that's come and said house of hell give way in the name of the lord jesus christ and there was a great earthquake that shook the whole earth under this angel's ministry and under that earthquake all the bars came down and all the walls came open and everybody who wanted to could go free i said i thank god that that voice has knocked the bars out from in front of me and i could come out of the confusion like brother borders was and i can't i just can't grasp it brother but i just can't grasp it you know what i was there one day i had heard them i just couldn't grasp it i just couldn't grasp it oh but there was a voice that shook the bars down and shook the walls down there was a capstone that came amen in it and it verified that this message is the truth and all of a sudden my eyes came open and i can grasp it i can grasp it i can grasp it amen not intellectually but by faith i can see do you see his eyes do you see his nose do you see his mouth do you see his beard i'm not talking about the picture i'm talking about his presence he's here now the high priest is present he's united with his bride can you see his eyes can you see his nose do you see his mouth can you see his black beard oh how blessed we are what a people we should wake up every morning say thank you god i'm alive in this end time we're not here to hate our lives we're not here to live in a drudgery we're here to say god you want to accomplish something in your in this day and you want to use this vessel i'm here lord cap off my life and use me for your glory i'm here for the final showdown i'm here for the final manifestation i'm here to show that there is a capstone a judge that has come to judge everything outside the word is false and everything that's in the word is true and that capstone of this message the opening of the seals it has judged me a son of god how can you be so confident brother chad i can't help it i believe it my confidence doesn't come from ability my confidence doesn't come from any natural thing it's not an arrogance it's not a confidence that comes from being able to accomplish anything this confidence comes because i know there's something in me that's more than the natural me it's the true me that when i hear that word i say it is the truth i know it is the truth i can have a storm going on in here but that down here always says that's the truth i can have absolute confusion and deception going on up here but there's always been something down here when the road gets rough and things get tight and you get back into the corner there's always been something in here says that ain't nothing but the truth when you see things like a prophet turning and laying a cornerstone down it was just a piece of rock and just a building that building will crumble one day and be blown up and be nothing but i saw more than just a man laying a cornerstone i saw the shadow of what was taking place spiritually and i can say thank you lord for eyes to see let's just bow our heads and pray and i encourage you if you never have you have an opportunity this morning to throw yourself down on this rock nobody doesn't need to be a show nothing no public show we're not looking for any of that god knows our hearts it doesn't matter how long we've lived in the message amen there's people who've been raised we can be raised anything we could be taught to accept it but it's not about learning it's not about knowledge it's not about tradition but if you're here and you've seen it on heard it all but there's something in you says i've got to fall on that rock i'd invite you just to pray out to the lord and say lord i'm coming i'm throwing myself upon the rock of your word god i'm put together wrong i'm misshaped i miss everything but if i throw myself on that rock and i'm broken you can take the broken pieces and put them back together the correct way i tell your friends god has had a plan a picture in his mind of you before the foundation of the world and all he's waiting for you to do is throw yourself upon the rock give up your ideas and give up your wants and come to the word and surrender completely to the word and throw yourself upon that cornerstone and he will take the pieces off of that stone and put them together the way he saw them before the foundation of the world he's the master craftsman he's the only one who can i invite you whether you're young or old male or female married or single whatever station of life you're in does not matter to me but if you find yourself afraid of the judging stone afraid of the headstone i would invite you to start by falling on the cornerstone the foundation of jesus christ and his salvation and his grace is blood that will cleanse you this message that he's sitting this hour to wash a bride by i pray that you fall upon that and ask him to put you back together and raise you up to a vessel that he can cap with his very life that he will live through you and do through you all that he intends to do in this world their heavenly father i pray god that you would go to hearts right now that you would move through aisles and down rows and through seats and i pray that you would do a work that no human being can do because there's nobody that can stir a heart only you can a human hand can never reach deep enough to bring a soul to an awakening you're the only one who can but i pray god that you would do it lord that you would do it in this place and do it to all who would listen that you by your own hand would reach down that you would move away all the darkness lord and that you would shine the light of your word down into the depths of a soul and bring a seed to life lord i see that you planted before the foundation of the world i pray you'd bring somebody to a desire to cast themselves upon this stone to be broken up lord so that they'll no longer be what they were but they'll submit themselves to your hand to be whatever you make them from here on and i pray that you'd make them trophies of your grace members of your bride part of your great temple in this day that you're living and dwelling in that you might shine the light of the gospel through their lives grant it lord grant it this coming year
