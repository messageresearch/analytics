[3:44] service is just for you i've been
[3:46] looking forward to it as you can see
[3:48] it's a little different than usual
[3:50] so today we're going to stretch church
[3:52] order just a little bit there's no
[3:54] deacons in here are there you have to
[3:56] forgive me if
[3:57] we're going to stretch church order just
[3:58] a little bit because we're going to have
[3:59] a good time together how many wants to
[4:02] learn something about god and about his
[4:03] word today amen that's what i want to do
[4:05] to you amen let's uh i'm going to read a
[4:08] scripture and then we'll pray and then
[4:09] you can be seated but i'm going to read
[4:10] out of mark chapter 10
[4:13] verse 13 to 16
[4:16] it says and they brought young children
[4:17] to him that he should touch them
[4:20] and his disciples rebuked those that
[4:22] brought them but when jesus saw it he
[4:24] was much displeased and said unto them
[4:27] suffer the little children to come unto
[4:28] me and forbid them not
[4:30] for if such is the kingdom of god
[4:32] verily i say unto you whosoever shall
[4:35] not receive the kingdom of god as a
[4:37] little child he shall not enter therein
[4:40] and he took them up in his arms and put
[4:43] his hands upon them and blessed them
[4:46] let's bow our heads and pray together
[4:48] lord jesus we thank you for the
[4:50] privilege of being together for this
[4:52] kid's service
[4:53] and lord we ask all that you would take
[4:55] the central place among us
[4:57] may i always say and do lord glorify
[4:59] your name
[5:01] and bring
[5:02] all your truths in a reality form to
[5:04] these kids
[5:05] may they be able to see you and know you
[5:07] better at the end of this service
[5:09] lord i pray that you would work in their
[5:10] hearts and in their lives from the time
[5:12] they're young so that they would always
[5:14] love you and always serve you and always
[5:16] know you and lord we just pray that you
[5:19] would take the preeminence among us in
[5:21] jesus christ's name we pray
[5:23] amen
[5:24] you can be seated
[5:27] if
[5:28] brother franco if you can pull up the
[5:29] powerpoint for me
[5:32] amen
[5:34] we haven't had a kid service for a
[5:36] couple of years
[5:37] how many of you that are sitting in the
[5:38] front two rows remember the last kid
[5:40] service remember being here in the kids
[5:42] series before remember wonderful and a
[5:44] lot of them got old and got shoved to
[5:46] the back so i see a lot of them back
[5:48] there that used to be sitting down here
[5:50] and now they're part of the youth group
[5:51] how many how many of you are 12 that are
[5:53] sitting up front i mean you guys are 12
[5:56] 1 2 3.
[5:57] wow so we're gonna lose you next year
[6:00] well
[6:01] praise the lord we're glad you're here
[6:03] this time you'll get too old and you'll
[6:05] get shoved to the back again
[6:07] so there's some benefits in coming to
[6:09] the kids service and being 12 or under
[6:11] as you get the good seats and when it
[6:13] comes to snack time you get to go first
[6:15] you're first in line for ice cream so
[6:17] don't be too too big of a hurry to get
[6:19] older okay
[6:20] because you lose some of those
[6:21] privileges
[6:22] so it's good
[6:24] all right we're going to do things a
[6:25] little bit different this is not the
[6:27] traditional kind of service this is a
[6:29] kids service so we actually have fun
[6:31] because kids know how to fun adults they
[6:33] forgot how
[6:35] how many are sure your parents forgot
[6:36] how to have fun
[6:38] exactly
[6:39] but not me i remember
[6:42] so
[6:43] we're gonna we're gonna talk about a
[6:44] subject of who is your guide who is your
[6:47] leader in life who is your leader and
[6:49] for that i'm going to start off with an
[6:51] object lesson now if you see did you
[6:54] guys see all this tape on the floor
[6:57] somebody has messed up our church
[7:00] somebody's guilty
[7:02] and i'm not telling you who it was
[7:05] but if you see little lines painted on
[7:07] the floor and directional arrows you can
[7:09] get the idea there's a little obstacle
[7:11] course set up up here and in this
[7:13] obstacle course you begin here
[7:16] you have to travel this direction it's
[7:18] really complicated so pay close
[7:20] attention really really hard you have to
[7:22] walk all the way over here
[7:24] when you get over here you got to go
[7:26] back to the back side of this
[7:28] and we have two different color cups
[7:30] we have two green and two silver
[7:33] you have to stack the two green ones
[7:34] together and stack the two silver ones
[7:36] together and put them back on the table
[7:39] then you have to walk this way you can't
[7:41] cross that line you can't go out of the
[7:43] boundaries you can't hit the chairs you
[7:46] can't hit this you've got to walk right
[7:47] down the middle of this when you get
[7:49] here you've got to follow the arrows get
[7:51] up on this
[7:52] this is the most dangerous part of the
[7:54] whole thing
[7:55] are you paying close attention
[7:57] you got to walk across here
[7:59] when you get here you come off follow
[8:02] the arrows go back here
[8:04] then we have three cups here
[8:06] two red cups and a gold cub you gotta
[8:08] stack the red cups together
[8:10] take the gold cup
[8:12] bring it over here
[8:14] and you've got to set
[8:16] this gold cup right on the square right
[8:18] there
[8:20] and you can't take all day to do it like
[8:21] we've got to get this done we're going
[8:23] to see who can do it quickly
[8:25] so is there anybody thinks that they can
[8:27] manage my obstacle course
[8:29] who thinks they can do it raise your
[8:30] hand put it way up don't be shy do you
[8:33] think you can you think you can run my
[8:34] obstacle course
[8:36] okay
[8:38] raise your hand who wants to run the
[8:39] obstacle course
[8:41] all right we'll let the girls go first
[8:43] which one of you girls really really
[8:44] really really want to do
[8:46] oh okay natalie come on you can do it
[8:48] first all right stand right here all
[8:50] right so you know what to do
[8:53] it was pretty complicated but you think
[8:54] you got it right
[8:56] okay but there's one caveat you have to
[8:58] do it blindfolded
[9:03] so
[9:04] if you put on my blindfold
[9:09] okay can you see anything
[9:12] you can't see anything
[9:14] are you sure
[9:16] are you blind
[9:20] you can see
[9:21] can you see this okay
[9:23] all right i'm going to get you in
[9:24] position okay i want to get you all
[9:26] lined up
[9:27] to make sure
[9:28] that you're going the right direction
[9:30] because we don't want you to go the
[9:32] wrong way
[9:36] okay
[9:37] now i want you to see how quickly you
[9:39] can do the obstacle course
[10:25] okay
[10:47] yeah you're doing good
[10:49] wonderful yeah excellent
[10:52] beautiful
[10:55] we don't have all day the ice cream is
[10:56] going to melt
[11:00] good job all right excellent
[11:04] okay
[11:05] see if we can keep going
[11:10] oh oh oh careful that's out of bounds
[11:13] we'll let you keep going
[11:16] oh careful
[11:22] well yep we keep going out of bounds
[11:31] okay okay okay okay this isn't working
[11:34] all right take the blindfold off
[11:36] see where you're at
[11:38] you were doing good you did excellent
[11:40] let me have this go ahead and sit down
[11:42] now
[11:43] she did pretty good i mean for being
[11:45] blind she did very very well
[11:47] she got all the way over here without
[11:49] going out of bounds i was very impressed
[11:50] who was impressed
[11:52] i was very impressed
[11:54] but we got the cups stacked wrong
[11:57] so you did excellent but we're gonna
[11:59] have to try this again
[12:01] now we're gonna let several different
[12:03] people have a try
[12:07] all right
[12:08] we never made it over here but there's
[12:10] some things i want to talk about because
[12:11] there's a lesson in all this it's not
[12:13] just
[12:15] getting blindfolded and walking around
[12:16] the sanctuary but we know that that when
[12:20] it comes to our life and what god has
[12:22] for us the future and what we're
[12:23] supposed to be doing with our lives
[12:25] as you grow up you guys don't know none
[12:27] of you know yet what you're going to be
[12:29] when you get older
[12:30] nobody knows what job you're going to do
[12:32] you don't know if you'll get married or
[12:34] not married if you have a family or not
[12:35] where you'll live whether you be in a
[12:37] house or an apartment what kind of car
[12:39] you'll drive what kind of job you have
[12:41] how much school you'll do there's a lot
[12:43] of things we don't know in life so when
[12:44] it comes to the future we're blind
[12:47] does anybody have the future figured out
[12:49] already
[12:50] nope i don't either i have no idea when
[12:52] it comes to what is going to happen
[12:53] tomorrow i'm just as blind as you are
[12:56] none of us know
[12:57] but is there anybody that knows tomorrow
[12:59] does anybody know that somebody who
[13:01] knows everything that will happen
[13:02] tomorrow yes tell us
[13:04] god he knows everything can god see unto
[13:07] tomorrow
[13:09] absolutely he can see him to tomorrow
[13:11] and so because he can see unto tomorrow
[13:13] we can trust him to lead us the right
[13:15] way
[13:16] now god is good to us in that he gives
[13:19] us leaders in our life is the power
[13:21] point up yes
[13:22] he gives us leaders in our life
[13:25] and brother branham made this statement
[13:27] he said in the message leadership he
[13:29] said now the first step you probably
[13:30] ever take in your life speaking of
[13:32] leadership is probably the hands of some
[13:35] kind old mother
[13:37] but that was the hand that held you to
[13:39] make your first step
[13:41] so when you were all little bitty babies
[13:44] and you may not even remember when you
[13:45] were a little bitty baby but you might
[13:47] had a brother or sister or somebody when
[13:49] you went to take your first step
[13:51] somebody was there to help you because
[13:53] you weren't born knowing how to walk
[13:55] is anybody born knowing how to walk
[13:57] no i don't think so you had to learn how
[13:59] to walk and somebody would help you walk
[14:02] and help you and that was usually mother
[14:04] brother branham said usually it's mom
[14:05] because dad's usually at work when it
[14:07] happens and comes home and mom begins to
[14:09] tell him all the exciting news of the
[14:11] day that baby took their first step by
[14:13] themselves so his mom and god gives us a
[14:16] mom to help us and then we have a dad
[14:20] who begins to teach us things amen how
[14:22] many i'm not going to talk to you girls
[14:24] but how many of you guys had a dad who
[14:26] taught you how to tie a tie
[14:28] all right and teaches you how to do yard
[14:30] work and teaches you things we've got
[14:33] leaders in our life we have a mom and we
[14:34] have a dad and god has given them to us
[14:37] to lead us
[14:39] and god our brother made this statement
[14:41] he says
[14:42] we have to be led
[14:45] he said you know god likened us to sheep
[14:47] that means god called us in the bible he
[14:49] calls us his sheep
[14:51] and did you know a sheep can't lead
[14:53] itself he'll wander away and stray away
[14:56] and he just can't lead himself and he
[14:58] has to have somebody to lead him and
[15:00] sometimes the shepherd is
[15:02] is supposed to lead the sheep now that
[15:04] was back in the days of the lord jesus
[15:06] he was the good shepherd that led the
[15:08] sheep
[15:09] so the bible describes us as sheep and
[15:12] little sheep have a tendency to get lost
[15:14] and lose their way they need a shepherd
[15:17] because they can't find their own way
[15:19] they don't know how to get back to where
[15:21] they came from they don't know how to
[15:22] get to the good pasture they don't know
[15:24] how to get back to the barn they get
[15:26] lost so god provided them a shepherd
[15:29] somebody to lead them
[15:30] so i'm going to try this again we're
[15:32] going to look for a volunteer from the
[15:34] boys who thinks that they can do
[15:36] so carter you think you can do this all
[15:38] right come on up
[15:41] we may have to tighten this a bit
[15:43] i don't want any peaking
[15:46] all right
[15:48] now
[15:49] pop that on there
[15:52] good job you're like a champ
[15:56] can you see anything
[15:57] nothing all right you stand right here
[15:59] cause i don't want you to get lost
[16:00] you're like a little sheep that can't
[16:02] find its way stand right there no moving
[16:05] you're gonna get lost
[16:07] no don't move
[16:09] all right we saw natalie she tried she
[16:11] did a good job
[16:13] but she just couldn't see
[16:15] so it would have been helpful if
[16:17] somebody would have guided you wouldn't
[16:18] then
[16:19] so which one of you guys wants to be a
[16:21] guide
[16:23] you want to be a guy all right come on
[16:25] up you can be a guide
[16:26] now do you know the course you know
[16:28] which direction to go and you know
[16:29] what's supposed to do go over there and
[16:31] stack the cups
[16:32] come over here go up the step go around
[16:35] stack the red cups together and bring
[16:36] the gold cup put up here you know that
[16:38] you can do that so you can guide him all
[16:41] right
[16:41] now turn around and you go in front carl
[16:44] you put your hand on his shoulder and
[16:45] he's going to be your guide all right
[16:47] you can do this
[16:49] okay are you sure
[16:51] all right
[16:53] wait a second we're not done
[16:55] you have to be blindfolded too
[17:05] all right
[17:06] you go ahead and put your oh let's
[17:07] tighten this up
[17:09] let's put your blindfold on

[17:18] to go not to confuse you or anything i'm
[17:20] just going to get you in a different
[17:22] spot
[17:24] okay i think that's about right all
[17:26] right hold still right there
[17:28] are you ready to be his guide
[17:31] can you do it
[17:32] all right you can do it don't worry

[17:48] gotta get in front no just turn around
[17:50] all right you turn around
[17:52] okay you got it mapped out
[17:55] all right guide our little lamb to
[17:57] safety
[17:58] all right go ahead
[18:02] there you go good job
[18:12] we're never going to get to the ice
[18:13] cream
[18:18] it's going to take a while
[18:23] there you go all right good you got her

[19:01] oh good job oh wait a second
[19:04] yeah there you go okay
[19:07] much better
[19:14] carter what's happened to your guide
[19:17] do you feel like you're going the right
[19:18] way
[19:20] no
[19:21] all right okay
[19:23] all right you got it for sure this time
[19:26] excellent
[19:28] it's like perfect oh oh oh oh
[19:31] all right let's take our blindfolds off
[19:36] wow
[19:37] what happened to your guide
[19:40] i don't know all right you can go sit
[19:42] down
[19:48] there's a scripture that describes this
[19:51] jesus said
[19:53] can the blind lead the blind
[19:56] shall they not both fall into a ditch
[19:59] this isn't exactly a ditch but we almost
[20:01] had both of them in the ditch
[20:03] so carter was our little lost lamb and
[20:04] he needed a shepherd
[20:06] but you need a shepherd who can see
[20:08] don't you right and you can't be a
[20:10] shepherd if you can't see right it's
[20:12] impossible you don't know where to go
[20:14] the blind can't lead the blind in order
[20:17] to be led you need somebody who can see
[20:19] somebody who can see where they're going
[20:21] knows where they're supposed to be go
[20:23] going knows what's going to happen so we
[20:25] found out that we can't make it on our
[20:27] own because we're blind all of us are
[20:29] blind in some ways we don't know what
[20:31] we're supposed to do next we don't know
[20:32] what tomorrow will hold we don't know
[20:35] what the future in our life holds only
[20:36] god knows so when it comes to those
[20:39] things we need somebody to lead us we're
[20:41] like a little lamb we're like this
[20:43] little lamb stuck in the weeds and don't
[20:44] know which way to turn don't know how to
[20:47] find our way back home
[20:48] but god is here to lead us back home
[20:53] and so
[20:54] we found out
[20:55] that we can't make it on our own

[24:17] yeah yeah that's good
[24:22] [Music]
[24:26] [Applause]
[24:28] keep going
[24:29] [Music]
[24:30] turn to the
[24:33] [Music]
[24:36] you can't have donovan doing all the
[24:37] work
[24:40] good job
[24:41] [Applause]
[24:44] there you go all right excellent all
[24:46] right keep going beautiful
[24:50] all right
[24:51] [Applause]
[24:52] turn around who said turn around
[24:58] all right all right time out time out
[25:01] dawson take those poured glasses off
[25:05] were you confused
[25:07] was any of their instructions confusing
[25:09] yes exactly you can go back to your seat
[25:12] now you guys are miserable helpers
[25:16] except for donovan if i ever get
[25:17] blindfolded i'm going to ask him to lead
[25:19] me
[25:20] and guide me
[25:23] the next lesson we learn
[25:25] is if you're going to have somebody
[25:26] guide you you need somebody who can see
[25:29] but you can't have everybody guide you
[25:31] there's too many voices and too many
[25:33] voices dawson was too many voices
[25:35] confusing
[25:36] yeah some said left some said turn
[25:38] around sends them go ahead sends i'm
[25:41] back to the left like it was too much
[25:43] wasn't it
[25:44] everybody had an idea everybody could
[25:47] see could you all see yeah you can all
[25:49] see you all knew what he was supposed to
[25:50] do but there was too many voices and
[25:53] sometimes when we as sheep we need to be
[25:56] led
[25:57] now we found out when we're blind you
[25:59] can't do it by yourself how many agree
[26:01] you can't do it by yourself when you
[26:02] can't see you need a guide
[26:04] but then we learned that your guide
[26:06] can't be as blind as you are you need a
[26:08] guide who can see is that true
[26:11] all right
[26:12] you need a guide who can see
[26:14] but everybody thinks they can see and
[26:18] they think they know what you should be
[26:19] doing and there's too many voices in too
[26:22] many voices end up confusing and you go
[26:24] the wrong way
[26:26] dawson went the wrong way and then he
[26:27] went somewhere the right way then he
[26:29] went somewhere the wrong way and
[26:30] listening to too many voices he got some
[26:32] of it right and some of it wrong
[26:34] is that right
[26:35] he got the cup separated but he got him
[26:37] stacked wrong he got the silver
[26:40] and the green mixed up and so
[26:43] i'm sure
[26:44] after a lot of pain and suffering
[26:47] and lots of trials and redos and dues
[26:50] against and all those other things he
[26:52] might eventually got this course done
[26:54] but it would have been confusion it'd
[26:56] have been difficult and the poor guy
[26:58] would have been stressed out he wouldn't
[26:59] even be able to eat his ice cream
[27:02] so we need a guide we must have a guide
[27:05] but we need a guide who can see
[27:07] and we don't need to listen to every
[27:09] voice that's talking to us we need one
[27:11] voice
[27:13] jesus said in john 10 27 he says my
[27:15] sheep hear my voice
[27:17] and i know them and they follow me
[27:21] and the psalms 23rd
[27:24] in psalms 23 says the lord is my
[27:27] shepherd
[27:28] so who's your shepherd who's your leader
[27:31] it's the lord jesus christ he's your
[27:34] leader
[27:34] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[27:37] he maketh me to lie down in green
[27:39] pastures he leadeth me beside the still
[27:41] waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth
[27:44] me in the paths of righteousness for his
[27:47] name's sake yea though i walk through
[27:49] the valley of the shadow of death i will
[27:52] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[27:55] rod and thy staff they comfort me
[27:59] amen
[28:00] so though the shepherd would lead to the
[28:03] valley of the shadow of death
[28:05] that's a tricky place going down into
[28:08] the valley with the shadow of death
[28:11] amen
[28:12] it says the sheep won't be afraid
[28:14] because they know that the shepherd's
[28:16] with them and wherever that shepherd
[28:18] would lead them they wouldn't be afraid
[28:20] they wouldn't be scared they would know
[28:22] they were safe because the shepherd
[28:23] would never lead him somewhere that was
[28:26] that was dangerous that they wouldn't
[28:27] get hurt he was trying to take them to a
[28:29] better pasture to some place better to
[28:31] eat some place that was more safe and
[28:34] and they could grow better in another
[28:36] pasture and so we need a shepherd
[28:40] we must have a shepherd
[28:42] we must be led we must be led by the
[28:45] lord
[28:46] john 16 which i think it's interesting
[28:49] that uh brother ben read this scripture
[28:51] or something very similar to it this
[28:53] morning
[28:54] said in john chapter 16 i have yet many
[28:57] things to say unto you
[28:59] but you cannot bear them now
[29:01] how be it when he the spirit of truth is
[29:03] come he will guide you into all truth
[29:06] for you shall not speak of himself but
[29:08] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[29:10] speak and he will show you things to
[29:12] come
[29:14] so
[29:15] who did jesus say would be our guide
[29:18] yes
[29:19] the lord and he's coming in the form of
[29:21] his holy spirit and the holy spirit is
[29:24] to be our guide and the holy spirit is
[29:26] the spirit of jesus christ it's jesus
[29:28] christ but not jesus christ standing
[29:31] here amen as the man who was nailed to
[29:34] the cross but jesus christ the spirit of
[29:36] god he comes
[29:38] and we hear him does anybody know how we
[29:41] hear jesus our guide
[29:43] yes doth through your heart that's a
[29:46] perfect answer we don't necessarily him
[29:48] with our ears although the the word of
[29:50] god comes to our ears but we hear this
[29:54] guide through our heart amen there's an
[29:56] internal voice where god leads us and he
[29:58] directs us amen what are some other ways
[30:01] we hear the voice of god how does it get
[30:03] to our heart does anybody have any idea
[30:06] of any other way we can hear the voice
[30:08] of god yes derek
[30:11] through prayer
[30:12] that's a good one anybody have any other
[30:14] ideas
[30:16] is there anything you can read that'll
[30:18] help you hear the voice of god yes your
[30:20] bible when you read your bible you can
[30:23] hear the voice of god is there anything
[30:25] you can listen to where you can hear the
[30:26] voice of god
[30:27] yes boaz
[30:29] the message you can listen to the
[30:30] message and you can hear the voice of
[30:32] god
[30:33] is there anything else
[30:34] you can listen to
[30:38] yep you can listen to audio bible yes
[30:41] yes see i love that that's what i was
[30:42] waiting for listen to the preacher
[30:48] good job boys
[30:50] but all of these are ways in which we
[30:52] can hear the voice of god because god he
[30:55] used the prophet to speak to us in the
[30:56] age he allowed men to write the word
[30:58] which is the word of god and god can
[31:00] speak to us through his word he can
[31:02] speak to us amen through the preaching
[31:04] through the ministry through the message
[31:06] when we read the message books and
[31:07] listen to the message he can speak to
[31:09] you through your parents as they do
[31:10] devotions and and they do bible lessons
[31:13] with you and read your bible stories
[31:14] through your sunday school teachers as
[31:16] they share with you the word of god
[31:18] anybody that's giving you the word of
[31:21] god is sharing with you the voice of god
[31:24] if it's the true word of god in any way
[31:26] that the true word of god comes it's one
[31:29] of the ways that god can speak to you
[31:31] and it's not just your ears your ears
[31:33] catch the words but it does something in
[31:36] the heart and then the lord begins to
[31:37] lead us and guide us by the heart
[31:40] something in the heart has to know what
[31:41] you heard is true
[31:43] something in your heart has to know that
[31:45] what that brother or sister just said to
[31:47] me is the truth what that minister just
[31:49] said is true what i heard on that tape
[31:51] is true and it's for me and that's how
[31:54] the lord begins to lead us that's how
[31:56] the lord begins to guide us
[31:58] amen
[32:00] like for instance has anybody heard the
[32:02] bible verse that says thou shalt not
[32:04] steal
[32:06] all right is that the word of god
[32:08] so that's the voice of the lord
[32:10] and how do we hear that voice of the
[32:12] lord i mean none of you guys have
[32:14] probably ever been tempted to take
[32:16] something that you shouldn't take but
[32:17] when i was little i was tempted to take
[32:19] something that i shouldn't take and
[32:22] there was
[32:22] i'm shameful to say it was more than one
[32:24] time
[32:26] and when i would reach out to take that
[32:28] thing and i knew it wasn't belonged to
[32:30] me it might have been something that was
[32:32] my brother's it might have been a toy he
[32:33] was playing with and i knew he wasn't
[32:35] done and i was going to take it and use
[32:37] it or it might have been a piece of
[32:38] candy that he had and i may have ate
[32:40] mine and i wanted his but if i would
[32:42] reach out to take that and something
[32:44] inside would remember thou shall not
[32:46] steal
[32:49] what was that that was speaking to me
[32:51] yes tell us
[32:53] it was the bible which is the voice of
[32:55] god which is the spirit of god speaking
[32:58] in your heart saying
[32:59] don't take it
[33:00] don't do wrong don't disobey the word
[33:03] and so it doesn't matter whether you're
[33:06] young or old you can have ears in your
[33:09] heart to hear what the lord is saying
[33:11] and what the lord is leading he's to be
[33:14] our guide
[33:16] okay i need one more volunteer
[33:19] all right boys you can come on up

[41:00] brother branham tells us a story of the
[41:02] rich young ruler and i'm going to read
[41:04] just one more passage of scripture about
[41:06] the rich young ruler
[41:07] it says and when he was gone forth into
[41:09] the way there came one running and
[41:11] kneeled down to him and asked him good
[41:13] master
[41:14] what shall i do that i may inherit
[41:16] eternal life
[41:18] and jesus said unto him why call us thou
[41:19] me good there is none good but one that
[41:22] is god
[41:23] thou knowest the commandments do not
[41:25] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[41:27] do not bear false witness defraud not
[41:30] honor thy father and mother and he
[41:33] answered and sent to him master all
[41:34] these have i observed from my youth
[41:37] then jesus beholding him
[41:39] loved him jesus loved this man
[41:42] behold him and loved him and he said
[41:44] unto him one thing thou lackest
[41:47] go thy way so whatsoever thou hast and
[41:50] give to the poor and thou shalt treasure
[41:52] in heaven and come
[41:54] take up the cross
[41:56] and follow me
[41:58] does anybody remember the story of the
[42:00] rich young ruler
[42:02] what did he do next
[42:04] can one of you tell me what he did next
[42:06] after jesus told him to sell everything
[42:08] and come follow yes to us
[42:10] he didn't do it did he he said he walked
[42:12] away sad because he had a lot of riches
[42:16] but he stood in front of jesus and jesus
[42:19] gave him an invitation
[42:21] jesus said sell everything you have
[42:24] and you'll have treasures in heaven i
[42:26] want to ask you ladies a question
[42:28] which do you think is better treasures
[42:30] on earth or treasures in heaven
[42:32] yes
[42:34] treasures in heaven
[42:36] who would want to keep treasures on
[42:37] earth when you can have treasures in
[42:39] heaven so here this rich young ruler he
[42:41] had a lot of treasures but god jesus
[42:43] christ said if you'll just sell those
[42:46] which you can't keep forever anyways
[42:49] if you sell those you can have the ones
[42:51] that you can keep forever treasures in
[42:53] heaven
[42:55] i would have done it in an instant i'd
[42:57] have sold everything to have the
[42:58] treasures in heaven
[43:00] and then he said give all your treasures
[43:03] to the poor
[43:04] and then he says take up your cross
[43:07] and follow me
[43:08] now if jesus looked at you
[43:11] and he says follow me
[43:13] how many of you would turn around and
[43:14] walk away
[43:16] no but this young man did jesus was
[43:19] standing there and said sell all that
[43:22] take up your cross
[43:23] and follow me
[43:25] and he walked away sad because he had
[43:27] riches and he had this was the chance of
[43:30] a lifetime
[43:32] to have jesus christ standing there
[43:34] saying you can have treasures in heaven
[43:37] which will you have forever
[43:39] you can have eternal life and all you
[43:41] have to do is follow me who doesn't want
[43:43] to follow him anyways
[43:45] and this young man chose to go his own
[43:47] way and we know that when he died he
[43:50] went to hell and he was lost
[43:53] and what a sad place to be when jesus
[43:55] was standing there in the flesh and he
[43:57] could have followed him
[43:59] but i want to tell you that today
[44:02] jesus is asking you the same thing
[44:05] he's asking you to give up everything in
[44:07] the world and if you give up everything
[44:09] in the world he'll give you everything
[44:10] in heaven
[44:12] and if you'll give up your own way
[44:14] and you'll you'll choose to
[44:17] to take up your cross that means to give
[44:19] up your life
[44:20] you can follow him
[44:22] and i say what a good opportunity that
[44:25] you have today that you don't have to go
[44:27] your own way you don't have to be led by
[44:29] other blind people you don't have to be
[44:31] led by all the voices in the world but
[44:34] there is a shepherd here today amen the
[44:36] spirit of god is available the holy
[44:38] spirit which is the spirit of jesus
[44:40] christ here to lead and guide each one
[44:43] of us
[44:44] who will allow him to do so
[44:46] and if you want a good shepherd and you
[44:47] want a good leader in your life you can
[44:50] have one
[44:51] all you have to do is forget your way
[44:54] and go his way
[44:56] brother branham said in the message
[44:58] leadership
[44:59] he said but now who leads you
[45:02] that's the question now
[45:05] now we're all led by something tonight
[45:07] we have to be we're led
[45:09] and what brother branham was telling us
[45:12] is we're all led
[45:14] by something we're led by our own ideas
[45:17] we're led by the ideas of friends we're
[45:19] led by their voice we're all led by
[45:21] something who's leading you now and i
[45:24] just say jesus is here he'll lead you
[45:27] if you'll follow his voice
[45:31] this is the rich young ruler
[45:33] jesus is telling him if you'll just sell
[45:36] and give to the poor
[45:37] i'll give you treasures in heaven and
[45:39] you can follow me
[45:40] and this young man walked away from the
[45:42] greatest opportunity anybody ever had
[45:47] but you know
[45:48] i don't want to be like this rich young
[45:50] ruler
[45:51] he was rich he had all kinds of big
[45:52] houses and a big farm and he got so rich
[45:55] one day he said soul take your rest live
[45:58] easy you've got more than enough
[46:00] and and the bible says thou fool your
[46:03] soul be required of you this day and he
[46:05] died
[46:07] and he had nothing in heaven he had no
[46:09] treasure in heaven and he had not
[46:10] followed jesus when it come time for him
[46:13] to die he had nothing he was empty
[46:16] i don't want to be like this man
[46:19] i want to be like one of these sheep
[46:22] i want to follow the good shepherd
[46:24] i want to follow the voice of the lord
[46:26] and i want to be led by him
[46:28] i don't want to have to find my own way
[46:30] because i'm blind to my own way
[46:32] i don't want another blind person to
[46:34] lead me because we'll both fall in the
[46:36] ditch
[46:37] i don't want all the voices in the world
[46:38] to lead me everybody's got an idea and
[46:41] they're going to confuse you you're
[46:42] going to get confused do i go right do i
[46:44] go left do i turn around do i stop do i
[46:46] go forward
[46:47] but there's one voice i want to hear and
[46:49] that's the voice of our shepherd the
[46:51] voice of the lord speaking through his
[46:53] word
[46:54] and i want that spirit to speak into my
[46:56] heart
[46:57] and lead me
[46:59] blake if you can come forward i'd like

[50:02] trouble
[50:03] there were times that i followed all the
[50:05] voices and i got wayward
[50:08] but any time that i listened to that
[50:10] voice

[50:13] in my heart he always led me the right
[50:15] way
