with us a couple weeks ago and I can tell you I've been thinking about it since then and looking forward to this day because what he started the seed that he planted in me has been ruminating and rolling over and over so I'm excited to see what else the lord has laid on his heart and I've come to receive from my Lord something he has for me tonight amen something he from his mind that he wants to share with me something he wants to speak about him and I and our relationship together and who I really am and and and help me break out of Amnesia and come to terms with who he who he called me

start right into the service and I was asked to sing but my heart's not in singing right now it's in trying to deliver what God has laid on my heart so you understand thank you let us turn in our scripture to Song of Solomon again it's been a I guess it's been just one week or two weeks been two weeks everything's brand new tonight I know uh song of Solon the 2 chapter same scripture I rode read and wrote down some thoughts about the Clift of the rock verse 14 chapter 2 oh my Dove Thou Art In The Cliffs Of The Rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and their countenance is comely now I want you to turn if you would to Exodus the 33rd chapter Exodus 33 verse 17 and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou has spoken for thou has found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name isn't that wonderful amen he knows Us by name yes and he said I beseech thee show me thy glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will Pro proclaim the name of the Lord before you thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy on whom I will show Mercy amen and he said verse 20 thou c not see my face for there shall no man see my face and live amen and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my Glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen let us pray father this evening never ever do justice to the precious word that we have laying before us but with these lips of clay may you come and anoint what's already been written May the spirit of Revelation come and impart the words the true meaning of the words to Every Soul we pray that's hungering for more of you may you bless your word to our hearts may we go from this place knowing that the god of Heaven has come not just in a natural temporal way that we think when we come to church I guess the Lord was there but Lord rather a deep seated knowing in our souls that whatever we have need of it was meant by you we need your help Lord tonight we ask your blessing now in jesus' name amen God bless you you may take your seats I've got a lot of scriptures tonight and I want to get to them as quickly as I can I'd like you to turn to Isaiah 53 Isaiah 53 thank the Lord and we're going to start reading at verse three we all know who this is referring to don't we amen he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted what a deep weighty scripture that is smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are are healed thank the Lord for that scripture we can go on I'd like to pick up verse n he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death that's referring to Joseph of armea that used his own tomb that he Bible says hewed out himself and place the savior in that tomb I didn't realize until I studied that when a person is crucified back in those days they were only 2 or three feet off of the ground and most generally they least leave them until they die for several days until the animals and the birds pick their flesh clean their bones I didn't realize that I thought they were all put into a tomb but they weren't what a horrible way of dying what a horrible thing and I was thinking of that that event there and how much our savior suffered for my sins sir the prophet told us that we were in him before the foundation of the world so everything that God was he poured into Christ and we were in him also so we were actually crucified on that cross with him we don't remember we don't expect to ever feel that but there is by faith a moment in our spiritual journey that we need to identify with that probably more than you ever have in your life and tonight I hope we can touch an area that you'll say that was me I was there I'd like to maybe I don't know if it's up on the screen doesn't have to be but I'd like to change a little bit on the title this evening not just the Cliff of the rock but hidden in the wounds of Christ and because the wounds had occurred by the father allowing it to happen which we'll read in one of the messages here it was a very traumatic thing for any believer that saw that God allowed his son to be put through such a horrible death but and we we read in Isaiah it said but it pleased verse 10 the Lord to bruise him and he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand that doesn't look like something that you would be pleased about but it pleased the Lord do you know why cuz you were in his thinking I was in his thinking and he couldn't release you from that until our savior suffered and died on that cross whether we understand it or not perhaps tonight we'll look at it a little bit different but hidden hidden in the wounds of Christ I like if you would to turn to First Corinthians 10 1 Corinthians 10 I'm going to take my time tonight even though it's a Wednesday night you forgive me I I hope to let you out I won't promise anything but I'll do my best there was too much on the plate last time so I'm not going to let that happen again God you understand don't youen 1 Corinthians 10 and verse one starting with moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and all and did all eat the same spiritual meat eat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ amen and the verse five but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness I'm going to turn over to Exodus if we could we're going to go back and forth here but Exodus and it'll be chapter 17 and we'll begin reading for the sake of time I'd like to read the whole several verses but we'll just pick it up at verse 4 Exodus 17:4 and Moses cried un to the Lord saying what shall I do unto these people they be almost ready to Stone me and the Lord said unto Moses go on before the people and take with thee of the Elders of Israel and thy rod wherewith thou smot the river take in thine hand and go behold I will stand before thee thereupon The Rock in horb and thou shalt Smite The Rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of the Elders of Israel now let's go to Hebrews the 6th chapter Hebrews 6 we'll pick up the thought here in verse four Hebrews 6 verse4 for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame may God add his Blessing to the reading of the word there's a scripture in the Old Testament that talks about the ym in the thumb how many are aware that that was the some say it was the breastplate the ephod on the priest and and had little linen Pockets where the 12 Stones of of different varieties were placed because when there was a prophecy or a Propet or somebody with a saying it was brought before that ephod or yman Thum and if it was true and God honored it the lights would flash how many remember that brother Braham said today it's the word so the word has to flash from one side to the other any Doctrine could come up any person could say anything they want but when it's the yman thumb and which is the Holy Ghost word of God for this hour it's got to flash but in order to Flash the stones weren't just in the earth it had to be mined out by men they had to take from the pressure of the whatever happened earthquakes whatever and they got in there and found these Stones they still weren't ready for the yman the thumb them until they were polished and did you know that the scripture talks about jewels a jewel is a stone that might be beautiful but it's only beautiful when it's polished and the polishing of the stone has to be done by careful Artisans that know exactly how to polish it so that it will reflect the light of the Y th and this precious word of God has to be preached by those that are anointed by the Holy Ghost so that when it goes forth there's a flashing of lights that you and I know that's nothing but the Holy Ghost and that's the way we live today is believing not only the prophet's message here but everything that's said there along with how the how the Holy Spirit has revealed it to the ministers so they're vital because they're the ones that take the sword of the spirit and trim the stones of Revelation I'm going to get into something here and but all of them have to be polished in order to reflect the light and the same stones in the Old Testament that were on the ephod or breastplate of the priest also are the same stones that are in the 21st chapter of the Book of Revelation where the wall of the foundation is the same 12 Stones but you may know or you may not know I'm just giving a little history here that every one of those stones that was in the Y and the thumm had a name written on it it was the 12 tribes of Israel so when the priest would go into the Hol place he was carrying the names to remind not remind God so much but remind himself and what he went in there to pray for and that is the people the Israelis the Jewish people and because he was the priest he could offer up sacrifices and praise for those 12 tribes now those same Stones according to the scripture are in the foundation wall of the New Jerusalem which is let me show you the bride the Lamb's wife amen so you're actually not only being reflected but you're actually proving that your name is in those stones so whatever Jesus did and called you by being crucified and and smitten you were there in him when that happened and you can't be released until the pain you're never going to be uh a living an epistle known and read of all men until you have absolutely taken your position which is in Christ and now you're manifest with a name and that name is in the city all those stones represent the Bride of Jesus Christ let John said let me show you the bride the Lamb's wife and all of those stones were right there again from the Old Testament all the way to the New Testament now I want to I want to go into something that I didn't touch on very much last time but that word cleft is quite an interesting word it can be a division it can be a a cutting it can be a a cataclysmic event and uh when we just read what what God said I'll just put you in the Clift of the rock that's an impression or depression in the Rock but a lot of cliffs and like I mentioned before I've been in the mountains I've hunted and climbed mountains and when you get to a cliff you got to be careful because usually goes down to a V and if you're going down too tight and you're not watching you're going to get stuck in that so the Clift of The Rock and doesn't necessarily have to be a clevice or crevice all the way down it just needs to be a place of depressed area where God can come and meet with his child so what I'm talking about tonight is there is a place for every believer because the fact that it was spoken in the book of Exodus and that Clift became became such an important part of that whole story where the Clift was put in there because that is exactly where God was going to meet his people you are not here to try to prove you're somebody special you are here because God orchestrated your time in the word to be present in in in this day and he alone he is the only one that can place you in the Rock of Ages that Clift of the rock is so vital and important that without that Cliff there wouldn't even be anything for a Believer because brother Bram said and I'm going to read it here in a moment in the Masterpiece when God smote his son he did it because he knew there had to be something that would come out from his son and that would be the Bride of Jesus Christ so he was obligated by his word to send more than just a an example through a death on a cross but more than that an actual life to somebody that's going to come in 2024 there's no time frame with God he's he's in eternity from past to present and for forever and ever and ever but he saw you in Jesus Christ now let me let me just ask you some questions here I thought this would be probably the way it's kind of a little teaching service tonight and it's hard to see up here I don't know if it's me or just the glare but I I can't see my Bible so so I got to hold it up here and they said well you can switch I have no idea what to turn on or turn off so we'll just leave it alone forgive me but uh all right the lights I I don't think it'll do any good because there's such glare there I'm going to ask some questions now I had to write these questions down what causes a Clift either an earthquake or some great event why did God use it why did he use the Cliff of the rock to hide Us in him is the injury and the safety of that Cliff one of the same and listen to what I'm I'm getting to here is the injury which is a Clift because when Moses took that rod and and struck that rock there was a cliff brother Bram said it left a Clift that Clift now was that only the injury of the rock or did it also type safety do we enter the cliff by our own will what does the Clift of suffering offer to us it actually offers a release from our guilt and unbelief do we find sustenance in the rock yes honey water and safety is there suffering in the Cliff of the Rock I'm going to have you turn to First Peter first Peter and 1 Peter 3 1 Peter 3 Verse 18 for Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit that is now let's just go over to verse 19 wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful Creator in other words what Peter is saying here you're going to suffer for his name's sake there is no way that the bride is not going to suffer because the Bible says you are going to suffer so you can plan on having things to suffer but I want to show you from the scripture that the things that we suffer our Lord went through it Paul went through it all of it is what by suffering we will earn a crown and we will reign with him now in Romans 8:19 or 88 I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and Hebrews 2 nine for the suffering of death and so forth verse 10 perfect through sufferings and verse 18 He himself has suffered being tempted so all of this is proving that in that in that Cliff there's going to be suffering I want to read some things that that I hope will get us started on some things that I I have on my heart now when last time I was referring to brother bram's message on the Masterpiece and how the great sculpture Michelangelo worked on that remember now Michelangelo he physically suffered doing all the that chipping that he he did and it it became such a experience for him that he was he was emotional over it because as he saw that Vision being played out in his work the closer it got to where he thought this is exactly what I saw in my mind and he was he got more excited and when the word becomes real to you and you get excited what the word is doing and the preacher actually says something that quickens it to you you get excited there's an excitement there what is it it's inspiration and and Michelangelo had to have the inspiration brother B said it was the inspiration that caused him to strike that image it wasn't because he had to or was told to the inspired word in his mind in His image of that Michelangelo's image of Moses he had to strike it so that's what God did and I'll read it here in a moment but we have to remember now inspiration is what changes things inspiration is what what caused Moses to strike that rock and when he struck the rock the first time it left a brother BR said it left a divot or a area that what was now what I just want to back up a minute watch now when Moses image was hit by Michelangelo that piece that flew off of his right knee he didn't try to glue that back on he didn't want to take the mechanical uh whatever he could and put it back on it was a result of the inspiration that caused it and when God put his word in your life and it became such a part of you he wasn't going to say well I'll just go ahead and find another piece and and patch that brother patch that sister up he didn't do that brother bradam said the same the same thing that he took out of Eve out of out of I'm sorry out of Adam became Eve and you can't replace it it's the same even though it's different it's still the same it's the same God and the word is the same no matter where it comes from no matter who it applies to it's all the same God doesn't changed his mind about his word because it's accurate and right to the point and it fits every situation but sometimes as believers we think that shouldn't happen to us why is God allowing that pain and suffering it's because he knows exactly what you and I need we cannot understand all the workings of God all we have to do is remember we must follow what the word said even though it causes suffering amen you see where I probably I'm going here I want to say this here the marble that Michelangelo started with was probably brother BR said maybe three or four foot piece of marble but it wasn't just the Moses image he was also displaying The Ten Commandments that Moses was holding so Michelangelo actually saw the importance of the of the man Moses holding the law of God and remember the scripture says every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus is Lord so where did he strike the image on the knee and what was the word speak so whenever God does something he has to say something according to his word so the knee actually would have to bow if it was a real person but it was it was just a statue but it was showing that God was speaking through that Michelangelo that artist and I I I was just thinking of the fact that the prophet saw that and actually had a message over that nobody else that I've ever heard has ever preached on Michelangelo and the Moses it was the prophet that saw that and how he typed it to Jesus Christ and the father striking his own son and so because of that it it it's a lot more precious to me now let me just read what I've probably gone through this four or five times and I every time I do I see something different but let me just read what he said what brother brandham said in this message he said his own image was reflected in his work God and Christ were one as in as much until he put his own Spirit into him and the image and the Builder became one his Masterpiece now he said Moses was in the work of St Angelo or Michelangelo rather was a sculpture work that was dead because he had been made out of stone but here the master builder when he got his handiwork perfected he stepped into it so the Creator actually became the one that possessed the very image of Christ so there was nothing in in that uh situation that caused anything other than what God's will was so he in other words he absolutely had his own image being manifest in that son of his and I want to say that Michelangelo had a son and that was Moses in that rock he was producing what was in his mind so it was actually a son of Michelangelo just just stay with me for a minute and because he was a son he was a created being from the very thoughts of Michelangelo that's what our heavenly father did he had a thought of you and of me back before the foundation of the world and he had to display it and created through his son there isn't a person on the earth but what can say my image my life if they would be a believer would say God orchestrated what I am where I am and who I am because I was in him before the foundation world if you are a Believer amen right that's exactly right so his Michelangelo's love for his son caused him Joy because in his vision of Moses he had the word which was held by Moses but what I didn't mention the last time was that he got friendly with a priest of the Vatican and this priest was a preacher every weekend he would go out and preach at these little groups and he invited Michelangelo to come to his his home or whatever it was the parish there and so Michelangelo stayed with that priest and the priest was in the Valle VA of course and knew and of course they had one of the original uh interpretations of the scripture the Vatican did and so he learned everything about and that's what I believe caused him to do Moses because he knew Moses had the law and this is back back in the 14th hund the 14th uh 14th century and so here we've got this man called Michelangelo being tutored by this priest that's preaching the gospel in through the Catholic but that's all right and and it was affecting Michelangelo to where he had a vision based on what this man was saying with the Old Testament whatever now here we've got this this going on and and brother Bram I'm going to pick it up in a minute he said he saw he he said he when he struck the image the spirit of Moses had to be released because in his mind in Michelangelo's mind he knew that was truth and it was actually an image that he had in his mind so he had to strike it he had to say speak because it was his manifestation of what he already had and if you don't say speak nothing will happen so he believed so much that this thing had to come to pass and and actually be a living entity that he had to holler to speak it wasn't that he brother Bri said that was the inspiration it struck him so much that he had to say speak and the prophet took that over to us in in our day and let me read what the prophet said here and I want to get I'm not into my message yet but I want to lay this Foundation here a little bit first just bear with me and now in order for this to speak he is the word and for the word to speak he must come into the image and then for the image to speak it's got to be smitten he comes into the image and then in order to speak the perfect Redeemer all the types of the Old Testament met in him all of them and he said therefore it's a match piece remember we talked about the and the piece of paper he tore in half and you couldn't ever uh match it because it was one piece cut in half brother Bram said that's exactly what it was it had to be the exact image that he saw in his mind and he says everything will work together for good and he called it a dirty a dirty piece of paper paper because it wasn't the paper that got washed it was the Garment and the Garment came dirty that was us we were s we actually caused the the smitten rock it was our unbelief now it was type I know it was in the type of the Old Testament but Moses actually did it because of unbelief he was told don't strike it just speak to it but he went against what the word said speak and he didn't make the promised land because of that so how are we going to get by if we don't do exactly what the word said we change one thing or do another thing God forgave him he was by Grace he was forgiven but he still didn't see the Promise Land because he disobeyed what God has said that's why I read in Corinthians about we crucify him again by what by not obeying the word so that cleft is because he didn't obey the word he used a force of anger and and and whatever else that caused that to happen now listen to what he said here I just trust the Lord will help us to get into the the Crux of this whole thing here now the smiting of C Christ the smiting of Christ was for a cause that he might take from him one to be a family the bride he might take him a bride so when his Masterpiece was perfected then he had to Smite it to take from him not another piece not another creation but of the same creation so it had to be part of him flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone he didn't add another one to it he actually took you from him you are so specialise God sir but the the thing is when when God was pleasing to to bruise him and and take him and and cause all that pain he did it because he knew that you were in the picture I was in the picture and he can't take something else but what his own son was don't you see that the bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh is because when Adam and Eve were together they were of the same it was Adam's name Eve didn't even have a name yet it was Adam because she came from him and you this evening have come from the very crucifixion yourself help us Lord but there's going to be suffering involved in it suffering I want to read some things from now just wait a minute he said here's a beautiful story that comes to my mind when Moses took that rock or that Rod rather and smokee The Rock and The Rock was Christ Jesus is that right The Rock was Christ and he put a cliff in the side of that rock when Israel got hungry from that injury now when Israel got hungry I'm just going to say you're Israel tonight whatever you have need of you're Israel tonight when Israel got hungry what' they do they went and to the Rock and there was bees did you know that the honey of bees could be spread over a horrible wound and no infection will come as a result of it prise God the Indians did that when they were working out and whatever running and hunting and whatever and one of them got injured they just found a beehive with a honey and they spread the honey in there and then sold them up and the Honey won't let anything contrary and did you also know I'm going to go this before I get get going that the blood of a lamb has got natural bodies in it that'll actually negate the effect of a poisonous Serpent and fact the blood of the Lamb is an antidote for that so when you go to a hospital and you you get bit by a snake and you got this it's a antitype that kills that poison and because it's the blood of the Lamb they don't use a lot of other creatures but the blood of the Lamb is got such a make that they could actually use that to to satisfy the need of killing that Venom that the snake has put in you that's the Lamb's blood Satan is sure tried to do his stinging and biting and whatever but there's a blood of the Lamb that was shed on Calvary that every one of us can come under that that precious blood and Satan cannot get anywhere with us because we have been proven by God himself that the blood of the Lamb is all healing am amen amen so they went to the Rock to get the water they went to the Rock to get honey they went to the Rock to have safety I want to just read this that brother bradam said he said The Rock was the driest place and he said all the critics would say you know we've we've checked it down there in the in the in the little uh Oasis and the little spots down in the in the valley and in the stream beds and that's where the water had to go and brother B said they went and searched it all out the driest place in the whole area was this rock up here it had no way did it have any kind of moisture in it at all in fact it was the driest place in the world but that's how God works and so he he caused the water now remember Paul said the rock that followed them them and Peter and all the disciples we'll get into it probably if we have time the rock that follow them now I don't know how that happened I don't know the rock that followed them I don't know if it was a spiritual Rock Only but I'll tell you one thing it provided water and this is the rock that we follow amen and that what follows us it isn't just that we follow a message the message follows us there's going to be a produc something produced in in the believer's life that because we follow that no it's because God follows us and he's there a present help in time of trouble Hallelujah we and there I'm thinking about blind barus you know there he was blind and he starts to holler but he had one desire he wanted the Rock and it wasn't until he got the rock to stop and listen a little bit that he got his his healing his eyes were blind but now because of the rock he received his healing that that's water folks that's a water from the Rock and it isn't just a natural water it's a spiritual water hallelujah it's a spiritual water this is something that kind of surprised me brother brandham said I think this morning in the ministry uh I think that would be good for me to say this to show you what effect the ministry has on different places of the world and he said the American people you Brethren are the hardest Feld there is anywhere now I've been overseas and for the most part they're pretty accepting of of um I can't say of just us in the message but wherever we went they were more accepting it doesn't mean now that we've got churches in the message but before we did in denomination there wasn't that many back in the 50s and 60s there was the prophet but he was thrown out of a lot of areas and wasn't allowed to even come and preach but and brother brandham said this he said you Brethren are in the hardest field there is anywhere I've been in Africa India and throw on and brother um or practically the world over and I've never seen a field so hard to battle as here in America this needs a missionaries worse than anywhere I've ever seen in all my life for an educated Heathen is harder to de deal with than an uneducated Heathen listen to these words Heathen is an unbeliever and you have that and you've got a battle here the missionary may have a lot of stuff to contend with malaria Amia and so forth but he don't have the demon Spirits I mean those demons that's got into culture minded men you talk about something hard to deal with and what's he saying their worse than the hot and tots and uneducated and and sinners over there over overseas but listen what he says recently I had breakfast with a bunch of ministers and I say this with respect brethen I would have rather had breakfast with a bunch of witch doctors that sounds horrible than these men I would have had a better reception think of this now I've had I had had a more and agree greeing spirit with a bunch of wit doctors many times than I would with a bunch of ministers such a horrible thing God Deliver Us from such we are so intellectual everything is moved away from the spirit it's the word it's the word it's the word now listen to what he's saying here sure I believe in the word but if the spirit don't agree with the word then you got something mixed up somewhere that's hard well brother brother Jim we're in the message we're around it still applies in the message if it's all word and they keep saying word but there's no demonstration in the spirit and power so nothing gets done they just keep giving the word the spirit's the only thing that gives life I'm going to say that again the spirit is the only thing that gives life when God quickens his word to a soul I don't care if it's for Divine Healing or salvation or whatever once that happen that that's who for sees anything anybody can talk about because the Baptists talk about the word all the time but they you give them the word test they don't want that why did Brother Brown do that because I see that creeping into the message not here but creeping in the message where if they can intellectualize or spend a lot of time and talk about something talking about it isn't being in it when you're in the word you are part of it and you express what God has done inside you that's not talking about something that's not talking about faith that's living there's Faith inside of you to receive what God has put in our path today now listen to what brother Bram said on on this and I'm going to try to get in my message not long ago there was an Infidel that passed through the lands making infidels out of supposedly to be Christians he was so educated till the ministers was afraid to attack him and then he went to Europe and on his road back he got broke down he went out into the West to make him a rest Place one day while he walked out from his Camp oh he swelled himself out because he was an Infidel he began to look down there come that whispering of the wind down through the pines and he began to look up he looked at those rocks hanging in the mountain and he said oh rocks who put you in the mountains have I been wrong about the chronology of this world all of a sudden God began to speak the Bible said if they hold their peace the rocks will cry out God in his Universe speaking from the rock well that Infidel knelt down by the side of a tree and said oh God have mercy on my soul there you are their pastors were afraid to attack him but God could let the rock speak out because God's in his Universe speaking to his people we think we've got it all figured out but God can just take an Infidel and by just showing him the Rock and the question is how did that ever come to be God can save a person just by his word just by an example Hallelujah yes and he said he said one time they wanted to drink brother BR said and they went to the Rock and they want to get something to eat they went to the Rock and the bees had made the honey there now I'm going to go into a a thought here and I want you to bear with me just a moment here when the scripture in John 1 in the beginning was the word you know what that word word means in the beginning was the logos and you know what let's turn this I want you to see something here and we'll go into my my thought John the Gospel of John say Amen when youen when you're there John 1 on I'm sorry well well verse one John 1 St John 1 I'm sorry in the beginning was the word now that word is logos it means a thought or a concept or the expression or utterance of that thought in other words before it could become a spoken word it had to be a thought first so it wasn't God it was the word or logos which was the thoughts of God and then that attribute and thought of God when it's expressed became the word we call it this Bible but like brother Chad said the word w d is not w d in every language it's our English Lang language so it what it is is a uh connection of alphabetical letters w o r d but it's way deeper than that that's just describing in our vernacular or our way of saying it that it was the word but it's the actual thought of God it's a very it's a very thought so when God had a thought about Christ or thought about um the the word the image it had to be expressed because he thought it before it was expressed in other words you are a thought expressed today that's right you are here as a thought expressed so don't don't get worried about whether or not you're doing this or right or whatever God had placed you here because in his Old Kingdom in his whole uh attributes and all of his thoughts and everything you were for ordained to be here amen now let me let me go with a thought here the thought of this logos which is the thought or concept or expression once that is expressed that's part of what God is so when he sent his word to heal them it wasn't just a w r d it was a thought but until the individual picks up that same Revelation and thought he won't even get his healing because it's God expressing himself in word form but not just as w d but his very nature it's very love and that's what Calvary was all about Calvary was more than just a cross on a hill somewhere it was a very image of God In A Man Called Jesus Christ and it had to be done because you were in him before the foundation of the world I want to show you something here folks that we were in him but we had to suffer so because the the word the word which is the logos was uttered and Jesus Christ became a a fulfillment or a image of that word being fulfilled that everything that occurred on Calvary was for a specific reason so it's God Alone with his attributes but now he's expressed himself through a flesh bone body called Jesus Christ that was his son because God is a spirit they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and the truth God isn't whenever he took on that form by that went past uh Moses that wasn't necessarily what God looks like he could could have been MDC it could have been anything he formed because he could do anything but we we as Believers we want to see God but we're not going to necessarily see him we'll see him in action in The Bride that's how we see God or the action in us when God reveals something in our souls that's the god of Heaven operating in someone that's why the prophets were so vital in the scriptures because they were actually speaking the very thoughts of God and you can't have the thoughts of God just come and then dissipate and fall by the roadside and no don't accomplish anything it's God's word coming to pass by the prophets now there there's a substance in that there's a substance in that and I want to get to the to the Clift again I want to go back to that Clift again so when when Moses struck that rock the first time and water came forth the second time he was told to speak to the Rock and because he didn't speak to the Rock he smoked The Rock he didn't get to go to the promised land but God's mercy and grace extended it because it wasn't very long that he was on the mount Transfiguration so wherever Satan wanted to find out where his body was it wasn't going to be possible because when God does a good burial or whatever he he doesn't let anybody know where it is and that's that's why the book of Jude like I mentioned you know Michael he wanted to know the devil didn't want him to keep it quiet he wanted to know where Moses was buried and he he never did find out did he no he didn't but there's two strikings two striking but I want you to notice something it was a believer that struck him wasn't a stranger Moses was a Believer he had just had thus sayi the Lord speak to the Rock and he struck the rock so a Believer is responsible for the crucifixion stay with me just for a little bit so we don't think we've done anything wrong but our sins and iniquities is what caused Calvary do you believe that it's because of us he would never have it never would have been a an experience we had anything to say about it we would never let him go to the Cross Peter said that and I was just thinking the other day you know that cross that wood whether was made out of gopher wood or whatever wood it was or Sycamore or whatever God knew when that little seed in the ground produce a little leaf that was the cross that Jesus was hung on it had to mature but he also knew there was 153 fishes that when the boys got out of their fishing it was all counted so everything means something to God yeah so why did the Bible why did they say oh there was 13 because little numbers are important to God I had a man that that uh I sold my when I sold my little camp trailer I wanted to go in and talk and I said uh we were talking he said I'm a changed man I said oh that's wonderful yeah he said I just got saved I said you did yeah but he said uh of course you know how denomination consider save so I said well that's fine so uh what's favorite scripture do you have oh he said I love all the word except for one thing I can't I can't understand why these names in the Old Testament are so hard to pronounce and I said okay he said so I just don't even read them I said okay and I told my pastor they're just hard to too hard to pronounce so I don't even read them and he looked at me and he said what if your name was in the Bible and nobody wanted to pronounce your name he said you know brother Jim that changed me I just realized everybody and every name is important I said it is even though if we don't understand it all it's still important to God Amen that's right so it was a believer that struck him but I want to take that thought just for a few moments and run it through the scripture when it pleased the Lord Lord to bruise him there had to be a an end I was thinking about lost and found you as little kids we remember you you heard the story when the boots were in the back room and they put it on no that's not mine and they went back and forth they took it on they put it on and then finally he said but my mom made me wear them it's because they didn't know who the boots long belong to and so the lost and found their the poor teacher of those little kids he she's trying to figure out who the boots belong to well it's the same thing with in the scriptures there's lost and there's found there is a uh necessary application of that and it's also in the Bible where we have the the results of um trying to think of that what they call the uh oh dear I didn't write it down but it's uh cause and effect so when you have the cause of something there's an effect to it so the cause of Christ is to bring out a bride for him the effect the cause of him dying on the cross was to produce something which was the effect which was the absolute bride of Jesus Christ but it took a cause something had to die something had to be bruised in in order for you the effect to come out out because God there's always a cause and effect to everything and brother BR said you know you have to know your motive and objective so God had a motive and an objective to have Moses strike that rock now it wasn't in the time of this of the crucifixion but it typed it and so as we look at the the the Clift of the rock the Clift had to be absolutely part of that whole scenario of the Cross and the and the sufferings and everything because you were the one that had to be caught in that cliff and let me just say something here if you are in the Clift of the rock the cleft of the rock is vital for the Salvation of not just you but you see you're responsible for more than just your being in Christ you brother I I have the quotes here brother BR said you could affect the destiny of a lot of people if you don't see the word just right am and because we often times hurry things up and don't really understand the the the revelation of the word we we get out of sink we get out of place and it causes somebody else to maybe fail and that will bring my next quote up and I want to share something with you there's what they call a stone cutter Moses was a Heuer you know what Huer means hewed out a rock and it take someone that has the ability to Hue out a rock and that Joseph that took Christ's body and hewed out that that grave for him that no man had ever laid in before he was a Huer or a what a stone cutter and so because the stone was rejected and we can go to Zechariah 4 we can go in the rest what Peter said that that stone was rejected because it was made to fit in a particular place and you are made to fit in a particular place that's why you had to be in the Cliff of the rock it doesn't sound like that there's very much but you had to be in the Clift of the rock that's why the cliff was made Christ was on the cross but he was smitten why because you had to come forth from him the Cliff of the rock is for you and you alone now there's where we want to get get into our message tonight that Clift of the rock is oh help us Lord is the hiding place where he let you become washed in the blood of the Lamb why was he wounded why was he forsaken it's for you amen so you actually caused the wounds yes but you actually came and were covered by that blood that caused the womb so you took part in both things you were not only part of it when he was crucified but you are actually that's your only help is the bleeding word in your life and remember brother Bram said the blood doesn't save Faith saves you but the blood keeps you and so if we we say well brother Jim I I I don't know anything about a cliff of the rock orever you were already there if you Wen in him and the reason you were already there is because he had you in his mind before the foundation of the world you don't remember being on the cross but you were there because in the body you are right now you think oh that was not a a thing I remember it all it doesn't matter if you remember it's what the Bible said and in the Cliff of the rock is where the wounds the blood of Jesus Christ cleansed you you are absolutely clean every day by the blood and that was the blood of the lamb but because you are in him you are part of that lamb that's right so the blood of the Lamb is the wounds that Christ was given because of your unbelief so the unbelief caused the crucifixion I'm going to prove something here to you what brother brother brandham said here and I just want to I'm trying to find it quickly here here it is now when he came to Jerusalem they said make him hold the peace make them hold their peace and if they hold their peace the rocks will be medely cry out the Chief Cornerstone went coming rolling down the stones something to take place and the Rocks were crying out when the same lamb provided for B deus's eyes he provided for you 1900 and something years ago as he climbed golgatha and offered himself all bruised and hacked together listen friend Abel went out into his herd and got the lamb and killed it that became the sacrifice you better catch this Abel died on the same rock that his lamb died on are you willing tonight to die out to yourself are you willing to die out to all your thoughts just lay on the rock with your lamb and die out say oh God have mercy when I think of men and women who think of Pride young men and women who give their lives over to to Terrible Things thinking that their job and all their Prestige of their neighborhood is good oh why don't you do this crawl up Calvary Yonder tonight Hallelujah let your own life be hacked out and die Yonder on the cross with him and throw your arms around the Rock of Ages cleft for me Isn't that beautiful because if you don't you're not going to be cleansed by the blood I'm going to ask you a question none of us have ever seen the Blood Brother BR said you'll never see the blood that was was shed so it's by faith that you claim the blood but if we're not willing to die and and go back into that Cliff of The Rock and be saturated with the blood of the Lamb how in the world are we going to be saved when you are saved you realize your your insufficiency your mistakes what you've done wrong and you say God please forgive me but you've got to step back into that Cliff of the rock where Christ is so you could be bathed in his blood and released from the sin that you committed that actually caused him and the reason I'm saying this is because there's something that happened with my little granddaughter you know brother brandham and I've got a lot of quotes here brother Bram said that Rod was a rod of Correction and so daddies and mommies have to have that in their home in order to correct whatever is wrong and sometimes this little spoiled Spirit gets in and the kids oh I know that's hard but I'm a grandpa I don't know 12 13 times sometimes we have to say things we don't like to say right parents right you don't have to agree but it is the truth and so I'm taking care of my little one precious little I think she was probably seven maybe seven years old and always whining and I went to her brother and I said why why does your sister whine I don't know Grandpa she just wants attention I said that's exactly what church members do they whine because they need attention and so I said honey I said come on Grandpa wants to talk to you a minute and you know she's whimpering and whatever and I said said if there's something wrong just tell Grandpa but don't just spend the day you're you're upsetting everybody and you're not accomplishing a thing and your brothers doesn't care for it that much you probably know where I'm going to go and so she just started in good and I said I'm going to just warn you my children know one of my children are here you know I only speak one time and I said uh grandpa is just telling you right now stop doing that and of course if you were never made to mind it's just it doesn't mean a thing so I said the next time you do it I'll have to correct you it didn't mean anything so she did it again and I took her over and I applied the the rod of Moses and I got to tell you something it's hard for me to keep crying when I did that that little girl crawled up in my arms and wouldn't leave why because she saw that Grandpa loved her so much she couldn't figure all this out but all of a sudden the pain that she suffered she realized isn't it strange that I loved her and she every from then on every time she saw me she threw her arms around I don't know if she ever did to anybody else but she did to Grandpa because I applied the word and that is exactly what it is on the cliff when God applies the word in your life you want to crawl right up to him and put your arms around him brother Brown said crawl up to him today and ask him to help you then the other the other little thought I want to give this evening I'm not going to take you all the way to 9:00 cuz I want to read something you know the quote my kids would get up of a morning and everyone gets up in the morning gets on my lap Rebecca a little older than Sarah and so Rebecca got up first and she run in and jumped across my leg and her legs hanging down cuz she's bigger and she put her arms around me and began to hug me and just then the smaller girl little Sarah she looked and Rebecca turned to Sarah and said Sarah I've got all of daddy there's none left for you and the little fellow the little girl puckered up to her lip to cry and I motioned to her and I put my other leg out and she come up and jumped on my other knee and I put her her arms around her and she turned those big brown eyes and looked over to Rebecca and said Rebecca you may have all of daddy but Daddy's got all of me so that's the way brother Brown said it is brother you may have all Theology and all but I want Christ to have all of me everything that I am every fiber and every bit I want him to hold me how that God does his great marvelous work he holds on because why you are with him in the Clift of the rock it wasn't just for him it was for you and it was for me without the Clift of the rock we wouldn't be here tonight Hallelujah can I read something that means a lot to me and maybe this will help you a little bit we've heard it mentioned many times we need to die to self but you know that can just be a phrase we we have to when we we die we have to do more than just say the words and act like it we actually dying is not happiness there's a sacrifice in dying it's painful you want things in your life to be better you want the church to be better more understanding and God bless your pastor to preach the things that will change lives you got to die to yourself because your own image becomes so important that you can't think of anything but yourself listen to these words written anonymously years ago when you are forgotten or neglected and you don't don't hurt with the insult but instead your heart is happy that is dying to self when your advice is disregarded your opinions ridiculed and you refuse to let anger rise in your heart and take it all in patiently loving silence that is dying to self when you're loving and and patiently bearing disorder irregularity tardiness annoyance and endure it as Jesus endured it all that's dying to self when you never care to refer to yourself in conversation or record your own good works or itch for praise after a great accomplishment when you can truly love to be unknown that is dying to self when you can see your brother or sister prosper and can honestly Rejoice with him and feel no Envy even though your needs are great that is dying to self when you are content with any food any offering any rment any climate or any society that is dying to self when you can take correction when you can humbly submit inwardly as well as outwardly with no Rebellion or resentment rising up within your heart that is dying to self this was written several years ago are you dead yet I asked this question are we all dead yet or are we hanging on to something pretty sobering isn't it have you crawled up into the cliff and have you been baed in the blood of the lamb and is it just washed you clean as white as snow or are we holding on to well but I'm important I'm something you know there was a I read a book a while many years ago feelings buried alive never die think of that feelings it's against the law to bury something that's alive but feelings buried alive they never die cuz sooner or later somebody's going to go dig them back back up again and you're going to say well I I I I just I have a hard time with that person or that thing we need to die to ourselves and bury the dead feelings and don't go back and dig them up I don't I know if this is for anybody this morning or this evening but it's for me we've got to die to self folks self dying self death and that's what happens when we go back to the Cliff of the Rock in Calvary and we say Lord Jesus forgive me you know it's a it's a pretty sobering thing when you think of we caused his crucifiction because of unbelief did you know that's what caused the cross and and and God had to had to please himself by causing the death of his son just so we could come out of him and and and actually live the whole message not just talking about it not just listening to it but living it out did you love him tonight let's stand brother Bram said the blood keeps you clean from sin because it makes a sacrifice are you willing to sacrifice your own thoughts to him tonight everything that you thought you were a lot of wonderful wonderful truths have been delivered from this Pulpit here and everybody has an opinion how it should or shouldn't apply to them but you know what brother Bram said you talk about a Revival of the Holy Ghost if we could all just understand what true death is die to ourselves crawl up into Calvary tonight say Lord forgive me I need to have another touch from you I need to have the blood cleanse my so soul and my thoughts so that I can be a True Believer father as we bow our heads in prayer tonight these broken up thoughts Lord is still your word and we love your word Lord and if it applies to us thank you Lord we take correction from it if it doesn't and Lord we just pray one for another that your will will be done for the steps of a righteous man or woman are ordered of the Lord we thank you for your truth Lord we thank you for Calvary even though was done so long ago we still recognize as your Prophet said we need to crawl up into it again and be cleansed by your blood help us we pray in this dark hour when the world is grasping for whatever truth or or whatever they can find Lord to help soften the blow of of there's no Christianity left there's nothing there at all so they're they're wondering and there's there's nothing from the purpose of the church that help and so Lord we just ask you we need we need your power your presence your help and we need to be cleansed by your blood it isn't just a one-time thing it's over and over and over because the blood keeps us so I ask your blessing on this little group of people here tonight Lord and our pastor brother Chad May you equip him with the words of eternal life that can be spoken because it's important that we speak and go forward help us we pray now in jesus' name amen amen if you'll come musicians oh you're here what can we sing go ahead he was wounded for our transgressions and he was Bru for our [Music] iniquity and surely he bore our sorrows and by his stri we Army seeing it once more he was wounded for all transgression he was bruised for our [Music] in Sur he he bore our sorrow and [Music] by are can we raise our hand say Lord you were wounded for our [Music] transgression you were bruised for my inqu Sur you Lord my sorrows and by your strip are he I was in Africa some years [Music] ago watching the different species and different types of Planes game they call them there's a gazel and those that would run in groups and the ones that impressed me the most was the zebras because God gave him the ability to interact act with one another to where the Predators the Lions and cheetas they couldn't pick out that vulnerable one because all the stripes mixed together when they'd run so when the little fo of the zebras gets lost sometimes 10,000 zebras are running across the serengetti when they get lost it wouldn't matter if they cried out because all the little ones would be crying then do you know how they recognize their mom they were born and immediately after they're born she presses them up to her side until the stripes become imprinted on their little mind Hallelujah and that's what it needs to be tonight those stripes at Calvary needs to be imprinted on our lives that's how we know whether it's our heavenly father or not that's why they don't get lost is because they're imprinted imprint of the Holy Ghost on the believer amen God bless you and he was wounded for our [Music] transgression and he was bruised for our iniquity [Music] and surely he bore our sorrow and by his stri we are heal amen and the Clift of the rock hidden in the wounds of Christ so astounding to me was when our brother Jim began to point out that what brother Brenham taught us he was smitten he was a perfect Masterpiece and he so pleased God that it pleased God to Smite him amen and the smiting of Christ came out the ingredients for the bride she was in him but brother benam told us that the Masterpiece has to be returned to his side and we all knew that we heard that but what was so profound to me is how do I get back to his side what's the path back first recognizing that it was my sins that caused his smiting that it was my unbelief and my fault so the path back to his side is a path of recognition that I caused those wounds and it's repentance and humility and surrender that brings me back to the wounds that cleanse me the ones I cause are the ones that cleanse me but the only way to connect back to the cleansing power is through humility and surrender and repentance and recognizing I'm the one who put it there but that's flowing for me oh what a paradox friend it's an absolute Paradox but it struck me with so so profound it's so deep amen that it's it it's it's something for us to take away tonight yes I came from him yes I was him he was smitten so the bride could be released but she's got to be reconnected and where's where's her hidden Place back in the Cliff of the The Rock back where she came from back where he was smitten how does she get back by recognizing it's my sins that put him there it's my fault that he was wounded and if we can humbl ourselves and repent and recognize it's me then we can be brought right back to his side and cleansed from all unbelief what a what a wonderful thing the Lord Has Done amen amen I don't know about you but I want to climb up the calvary climb back to where I came from recognizing it was my fault if I can recognize it was my fault amen he can wash me white as snow and then we can remain by his side forever United with him cleansed forever amen God is good to us and we just want to say thanks to our brother Jim for yielding himself and we just appreciate a veteran who still would press the battle amen still take the sword of the word and press it drive it to the heart of the enemy amen and I appreciate that it's encouraging to me to see our brother staying in the pull pit and delivering the word amen God bless you all let's bow our heads and just thank the Lord for his word Lord Jesus I thank you for this word that you've given God May the full impact of what you trying to deliver to us may it hit us Lord may we recognize what a wonderful thing you've done for us Lord how you had a plan Lord that that through it all you would reconcile us back to yourself we would come back to that smitten Rock we'd find Safety and Security in your wounds in the place that was smitten it was our fault that it happened but Lord you've made a crevice that we might come back to to be cleansed and be saved and be safe forever more help us Lord each one to find our way back to the Cliff of the rock back where there's honey back where there's water back where there's sustenance back where there's safety back where there's cleansing Lord help us to come back through humility and surrender and repentance may we be forever United with you never to leave that Clift again we love you Lord we thank you for what you've showed us today May the impact of it change our lives and may we forever stay close to you Lord never to stray away again may we never move an unbelief that CS the wounds in the first place but may we be washed away may all the unbelief be washed out of our heart and may you find within us faith faith that pleases you and faith that that makes your word live inside of us so that you can be displayed through us oh we love you we ask that you bless our brother Jim Lord that you would strengthen him and bless him for his surrender to you and for his many years of service may you just pour blessings upon him and bless all of us as we go home Lord May the things that we've heard tonight not fade out of our minds when we walk out of the sanctuary but may we Ponder them Lord and think about them and think about your great Plan of Redemption we love you father we ask that you would bless your children and keep them safe on the roads going home may you use us Lord as instruments to display your word in this world in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all brother John greater than all my sin is the blood that still cleanses me is the grace that still sets me free to praise him I know that at the blood of I'm walking in new of life I cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the lamb and greater than all my sin is the blood that still cleanses he is the grace that still sets me free to praise him oh I know that
