[10:07] started and looked at one another we

[10:22] being with him when he was witnessing
[10:24] which was pretty much any time you're
[10:25] with brother john
[10:27] so he was always sharing the word and it
[10:29] was just part of him and that gift that
[10:31] was in his life he could just talk to

[20:27] good to see you all
[20:29] it certainly sounds like a celebration
[20:31] of life so far
[20:32] we appreciate god for that while we're
[20:34] standing let's just take our bibles and
[20:36] turn to a scripture and then we'll let
[20:38] everybody be seated if you have your
[20:39] bibles i'll read it here out of second
[20:42] timothy chapter 4
[20:44] verse 6.
[20:47] for i am now ready to be offered in the
[20:49] time of my departures at hand
[20:52] i have fought a good fight
[20:54] i have finished my course
[20:56] i have kept the faith
[20:58] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[20:59] crown of righteousness which the lord
[21:01] the righteous judge shall give me at
[21:03] that day and not to me only but unto all
[21:06] them also
[21:07] that love his appearing
[21:10] amen our brother loved his appearing
[21:13] i praise god for that and i thank god
[21:15] that he finished his course
[21:18] and that he kept the faith
[21:20] and now it's our turn
[21:21] to finish our course and to keep the
[21:23] faith
[21:24] what an example that the brother set
[21:26] before us
[21:27] and i want to talk about that and preach
[21:29] the word a little bit and then
[21:32] just remember his life but let's pray
[21:33] before we're seated
[21:35] lord jesus we thank you for the
[21:37] privilege of gathering together
[21:39] of remembering lord the light that you
[21:41] shine through a life here on earth
[21:43] through our brother john and all that
[21:44] you did lord through him and
[21:46] each one of us in some way or another
[21:48] were able to
[21:49] be affected by his life to spend some
[21:52] time on this earth in this dimension
[21:54] together
[21:55] and for that we're grateful lord and we
[21:57] want to say thank you for the privilege
[21:59] lord for we consider it a privilege
[22:01] and lord you've chose to take our
[22:03] brother home and for that we're thankful
[22:05] lord we rejoice in his reward and we ask
[22:08] lord that you would help us today as we
[22:10] look at your word in honor of our
[22:12] brother
[22:13] god that you would bless the breaking of
[22:15] bread lord that you would break it by
[22:16] your own hand
[22:18] that you would feed us the sheep that
[22:19] remain
[22:20] to keep strength lord in our bodies that
[22:22] we might serve you to continue on
[22:25] carrying that light that our brother
[22:26] carried we ask for your blessing and all
[22:28] things we say and do in jesus christ's
[22:30] name we pray amen you can all be seated
[22:36] it's good to see you all
[22:38] not everybody had the opportunity or
[22:40] actually very few had the opportunity to
[22:41] be at the funeral because of the uh
[22:43] restrictions and the circumstances so
[22:46] this is an opportunity for those that
[22:48] worshipped with brother john and
[22:49] fellowship with him to be able to gather
[22:51] together to remember his life and
[22:54] brother josh said we want we want some
[22:56] preaching because that's what brother
[22:57] john loved
[22:58] he loved the preaching of the word and i
[23:00] remember you know i think of him often
[23:02] still and he sat right back here in the
[23:05] back and
[23:06] he would he would he'd be nodding away
[23:08] the brother he would nod raise his hands
[23:10] every once in a while but when it really
[23:12] was good he would pump that fist
[23:15] oh that's what i looked for you know
[23:17] when he would do like that i was like
[23:19] praise god amen we said something we're
[23:21] saying
[23:23] and so i i missed that i missed out
[23:25] about the brother and brother john
[23:27] absolutely loved the word of god
[23:29] amen it wasn't his pastime it was his
[23:32] life
[23:33] amen it wasn't to him about church
[23:36] attendance he came to church because
[23:38] that's what believers do
[23:40] but the word was his whole life amen
[23:43] once he once once god had got a hold of
[23:46] him and directed him and he found christ
[23:48] for our day he never let loose amen
[23:52] well i just
[23:53] appreciated that about the brother and
[23:56] you know there were some things i shared
[23:57] with the funeral i'd like to share again
[23:58] today for all those who remember him but
[24:01] but he would challenge me in the word
[24:04] and he would challenge me in all kinds
[24:05] of things
[24:08] but you know i knew that that brother
[24:10] john put the word above everything else
[24:12] and if you were close to him you knew he
[24:14] put the word above everything else even
[24:16] above family and above relationships he
[24:18] put the word first
[24:19] and that's what i loved about him i knew
[24:21] that if i ever left the word he'd walk
[24:23] out the doors of this church and not
[24:24] come back
[24:26] and i loved that about him
[24:28] and i knew that he put the word first
[24:30] and and i liked it and so
[24:32] i enjoyed our fellowship he loved the
[24:34] fellowship brother john loved to sit and
[24:37] talk about the word
[24:39] amen he loved to talk about the things
[24:40] god were doing the things he was seeing
[24:42] modern events
[24:44] current events and prophecy being
[24:46] fulfilled he loved all of those things
[24:48] and i would i would meet him after
[24:49] church he'd be waiting for me out one of
[24:51] these doors and he would catch me and
[24:53] he'd be standing there he goes did you
[24:54] did you watch the news yesterday i said
[24:56] no i didn't watch the news yesterday did
[24:58] you hear what the pope said no i didn't
[25:00] hear so he would fill me in and then
[25:01] he'd go to the message and he'd go to
[25:03] prophecy and i say praise the lord
[25:05] brother he goes what do you think i said
[25:07] i don't know i just heard it i mean give
[25:09] me
[25:11] give me a minute to process amen but but
[25:15] that's what he was always looking for
[25:16] was the word to be fulfilled he was
[25:18] watching all the time for the things
[25:20] that were promised in this end time to
[25:22] manifest themselves
[25:23] and he was a tremendous brother and like
[25:26] was said before he was a tremendous
[25:28] witnesser
[25:30] he he could talk to anybody and to
[25:33] everybody and i've shared this story
[25:35] with a few people but i'd like to share
[25:36] it again i i was talking to brother john
[25:39] one day and he was just telling me he
[25:41] had these little hitchhiker cards this
[25:43] thing that the lord had inspired him to
[25:45] write and he made a track out of it he
[25:47] had little cards he would pass that all
[25:48] the time and he was telling me that he
[25:50] was at the gas station and he was
[25:52] pumping gas and somebody pulled in to
[25:54] the gas pump you know on the other side
[25:56] of the one he was at and he struck up a
[25:58] conversation i think it was a man or a
[26:00] lady i don't remember now and he started
[26:02] talking to them started talking about
[26:04] the lord he gave him a hitchhiker card
[26:06] he witnessed to them uh convinced them
[26:09] to give their heart back to the lord i
[26:10] think it was he got their name and their
[26:12] phone number so he could call and follow
[26:14] up with them and they finally finished
[26:16] 20 or 30 minutes later and he drove away
[26:19] i thought man the brother is good
[26:23] so like the next week i think it was
[26:25] sometime i'm pumping gas
[26:27] and somebody pulls up and the pump
[26:29] across from me and they get out there
[26:30] pumping gas and i remember the story and
[26:32] i and i looked over at them i looked
[26:34] over the person they looked at me and i
[26:35] kind of nodded and they kind of nod and
[26:37] they turned to pump gas and i was
[26:39] thinking about what brother john did and
[26:40] i thought never mind it doesn't work for
[26:42] me
[26:45] i just kept pumping gas never said a
[26:47] word and got in my truck and left
[26:50] if you've got the gift you have the gift
[26:52] if you don't have the gift you can't
[26:53] manufacture the gift
[26:56] he had it brother
[26:57] and he was a witnessing machine and god
[26:59] used him mightily for that amen just to
[27:02] encourage people along their walk to
[27:04] take him another step higher amen to
[27:06] encourage them in the ways of the lord
[27:08] he would pray with people he would pray
[27:10] for people he wouldn't even invite
[27:12] people to church he would just share
[27:14] sometimes just a scripture and encourage
[27:16] somebody to do better
[27:18] whatever he could do he did
[27:20] however far he could take he took
[27:22] and then and he wasn't worried about the
[27:24] rest he left that to god
[27:26] but i i appreciate that so he was
[27:29] definitely a challenge to me
[27:31] god didn't give us the same gift and i
[27:34] tried to emulate and i failed
[27:37] but i just pray god will help me
[27:39] when he wants to use me amen
[27:42] i'd like to take a look at matthew 13
[27:44] and i'll just read it
[27:46] here there's a couple scriptures i want
[27:47] to look at
[27:49] matthew 13 and 44
[27:51] it says again the kingdom of heaven is
[27:53] like unto a treasure hidden a field
[27:56] the which when a man hath found he
[27:58] hideth and for joy thereof goeth and
[28:00] selleth all that he hath and buyeth that
[28:03] field
[28:05] again the kingdom of heaven is likened
[28:06] to a merchant man seeking goodly pearls
[28:09] who when he had found one pearl of great
[28:11] price went and sold all that he had
[28:14] and bought it
[28:16] this to me
[28:18] is a reflection of our brother's life
[28:21] for when he found christ in his day he
[28:23] found the message of the hour that was
[28:26] it for him
[28:27] everything else was given up and you
[28:29] know brother john may not have had to
[28:31] physically go sell property or go get
[28:34] money out of the bank and buy a piece of
[28:36] ground or sell everything for a physical
[28:38] pearl that's not what the lord is
[28:39] talking about but when he found the
[28:42] treasure when he found the thing that he
[28:43] valued the most what he had been looking
[28:45] for all his life when he found it that
[28:48] was it amen nothing else mattered he had
[28:51] to have it if it meant selling out to
[28:53] everything else he sold out everything
[28:54] else because he had to have
[28:56] this i remember you know talking to him
[28:59] and talking to our brother gene petrie
[29:01] you know brother gene needed some
[29:03] bulldozer work done and he got a name of
[29:05] a of an individual who would do some
[29:07] work for him on his farm and that name
[29:10] was john matthews i believe it was in
[29:13] the 70s if i'm not wrong sometime along
[29:15] then and
[29:16] and john come out to do some bulldozer
[29:18] work on brother gene petrie's farm and
[29:21] and he was moving some trees and cutting
[29:22] some lanes and
[29:24] and brother gene has a way of just
[29:26] asking questions
[29:28] if you've ever been asked a question by
[29:30] brother gene he has a way of asking a
[29:31] question
[29:32] and he'll ask a question that'll totally
[29:34] pop your mind and open to a thing you've
[29:36] never thought of before
[29:39] about the word and about the lord and he
[29:41] began to ask questions and and they
[29:43] started this dialogue and in the
[29:45] dialogue
[29:46] he would begin john would begin to share
[29:48] things out of scripture and pretty soon
[29:50] john couldn't take it anymore he had to
[29:51] know how do you get all this where does
[29:53] it come from how do you know this
[29:55] and he just shared with him that god had
[29:57] sent a prophet in the end time and there
[29:59] was a message and that message was
[30:01] christ
[30:02] and when he found that that had been the
[30:05] thing he was looking for all his life he
[30:08] may not have been able to put it into
[30:10] words he may not have been able to
[30:12] verbalize what his desire was of his
[30:14] heart all his life what the tug was what
[30:16] the draw was he may not have been able
[30:17] to explain i'm looking for christ in my
[30:20] day i'm looking for the manifestation of
[30:21] the word today but there was something
[30:23] in him that was longing searching and
[30:25] and he he wasn't satisfied with one
[30:27] church he i think he tried them all
[30:30] is that right
[30:32] i think he tried several so
[30:34] he he couldn't find what it was he was
[30:36] looking for so he tried one for a while
[30:38] and he would try another and he would
[30:40] try another but during these
[30:42] conversations with brother gene all of a
[30:44] sudden something began to stir and he
[30:46] was pointed towards christ amen and when
[30:48] when he saw what it was
[30:50] that was the treasure hidden in the
[30:52] field for our brother john that was the
[30:54] pearl of great price that he was looking
[30:56] for and he was willing to give
[30:58] everything up
[30:59] and now when we look back and reflect on
[31:01] the life of our brother john we're not
[31:03] sitting here talking about
[31:05] accommodations that he received for
[31:07] merits of honor and a public service
[31:09] we're not talking about accomplishments
[31:11] he made in a in a civil job or the
[31:14] amount of money he earned when we all
[31:16] talk about brother john there's one
[31:18] thing that stands out the thing he loved
[31:20] most was this word
[31:22] everything he else he did was on the
[31:24] side this was the main thing
[31:26] he worked he had to work he had to
[31:28] support himself he had to have a job
[31:30] you know he did things he had interest
[31:32] in life he had family and he loved them
[31:34] dearly he had things that he were
[31:36] interested in things that he enjoyed but
[31:38] we all know what was the main attraction
[31:40] for brother john
[31:42] and the main attraction was the word
[31:44] and i said let that be an example to us
[31:47] if there was ever anybody we saw sell
[31:50] everything and with joy not sell
[31:52] everything and be like oh i just can't
[31:54] go there no i can't do this i have to
[31:57] no way when he come into the truth when
[32:00] he recognized amen that the word had
[32:02] been restored to the church amen there
[32:04] was nothing else he wanted in comparison
[32:06] for this everything else in the exchange
[32:08] rate of value everything else was less
[32:10] value than this
[32:12] so in the exchange rate of value you
[32:15] know when there's an exchange rate of
[32:16] something it's what you're willing to
[32:17] pay for it so you're willing to part
[32:19] with money to have an item so if you go
[32:21] to a garage sale and you say this item
[32:24] is worth this much to me i'm willing to
[32:26] pay this to have that item it's an
[32:28] exchange rate of value
[32:31] and somebody else might not give what
[32:32] you would give for it or you may not
[32:34] give what somebody else would give for
[32:35] it but there's an exchange rate of value
[32:37] but when brother john come in contact
[32:39] with christ for our day the exchange
[32:41] rate of value was so superior he would
[32:44] give everything to have this
[32:47] he would give work he would give
[32:49] relationships he would give friendships
[32:51] he would give up everything for christ
[32:56] i said let that be
[32:57] our example amen
[33:00] i i i hope
[33:02] that i don't come to the end of my life
[33:05] and everybody tried to conjure up some
[33:07] earthly accomplishments to talk about at
[33:09] my funeral
[33:11] well he he worked at a certain certain
[33:13] job for so many years and he left behind
[33:15] such such amount of money and he got you
[33:18] know i would hate it if they were
[33:20] standing at my funeral saying he had
[33:22] perfect attendance
[33:26] you know
[33:27] he outsold everybody else he was the top
[33:30] salesman three years in a row well
[33:32] that's fine thank god for that that's a
[33:34] blessing but that's not what i want at
[33:35] my funeral i want to be known for
[33:38] selling out for the word amen i want to
[33:40] be known for giving everything the
[33:42] exchange rate of christ in my life that
[33:44] everybody knows what the value of the
[33:46] word was for me
[33:48] that everybody knows that he was willing
[33:49] to exchange friendships he was willing
[33:52] to exchange relationships he was really
[33:54] to exchange jobs he was willing to
[33:55] exchange everything for the value of
[33:58] christ
[34:00] that was the pearl of great price
[34:04] luke 17
[34:07] jesus is going to say something that
[34:08] could be astonishing luke 17 verse 20
[34:11] says and when he was demanded of the
[34:13] pharisees when the kingdom of god should
[34:15] come he answered them and said the
[34:17] kingdom of god cometh not with
[34:18] observation
[34:20] neither
[34:21] shall they say lo here or lo there for
[34:24] behold the kingdom of god
[34:26] is within you
[34:29] before
[34:31] he said when the kingdom of heaven is
[34:33] like a treasure hidden in the field that
[34:35] when a man finds it he hides and goes
[34:37] and sells all he had to buy the field to
[34:38] have the treasure when he finds the the
[34:41] the kingdom of heaven is like a pearl
[34:43] hidden in a field so he's talking about
[34:45] this same kingdom and this kingdom is
[34:47] it's like a treasure hit in the field
[34:49] it's like a pearl but he comes here to
[34:51] luke he says the kingdom of heaven is
[34:54] within you
[34:55] so this thing
[34:57] oh praise god
[34:59] what brother john matthews realized is
[35:01] the thing that he'd been looking for all
[35:02] his life was in him
[35:07] he was looking for god and not realizing
[35:09] he was carrying an attribute of god
[35:10] around this earth
[35:12] that way down in the soul there was
[35:14] something laying there waiting to be
[35:16] struck with light and be struck with
[35:18] water amen to come to a birth to come
[35:20] into manifestation and he didn't realize
[35:23] the thing he was looking for amen the
[35:25] field it was hidden was him
[35:28] amen the pearl of great price was down
[35:30] in his soul and he didn't know it it was
[35:32] buried over by the dirt of the earth it
[35:34] was buried over by amen by corruption
[35:37] and by a corruptable spirit but
[35:39] a spirit of the earth a carnal spirit it
[35:42] was buried it was there but the real
[35:44] treasure he found amen was that there
[35:46] was something that god had planted in
[35:48] him before the foundation of the world
[35:49] and only god knew how to wake it up amen
[35:52] only god knew how to make it active and
[35:54] he would have to take this part of the
[35:56] word that's predestinated for this hour
[35:58] and he would have to match it with a
[36:00] word that was ordained for this hour and
[36:02] when the word for this hour matched a
[36:04] seed for this hour and the two came
[36:06] together there was a new birth and it
[36:08] sprung to life
[36:10] and we all saw that there was a change
[36:12] that there was a new birth you could
[36:13] tell this is a manifested son of god
[36:18] he paid the the price of exchange he
[36:21] gave it all for the word
[36:23] matthew 18 verse 3 says verily i say
[36:26] unto you except you be converted and
[36:28] become as little children
[36:30] you shall not enter into the kingdom of
[36:32] heaven
[36:33] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[36:35] as a little child the same is greatest
[36:37] in the kingdom of heaven in order
[36:41] order for this the entrance into this
[36:44] kingdom
[36:45] we must be converted
[36:47] and become like a little child
[36:49] we must become like a child of the
[36:51] kingdom one that will just believe his
[36:53] father's word
[36:56] one that will just take for face value
[36:58] what father says
[37:00] like a child that will believe amen
[37:04] not have to reason a child doesn't have
[37:06] to reason a child believes
[37:08] a child doesn't have to know all the
[37:10] science behind something they just know
[37:12] a father says it it's true
[37:15] and we must be converted and become as a
[37:17] little child and you know brother john
[37:20] was able he had been through so many
[37:23] different realms of theology
[37:25] so many different flavors of
[37:27] christianity
[37:29] amen but when he when he came to this
[37:32] one that would awaken amen the kingdom
[37:34] within him the one that would that would
[37:36] that would bring him into his rightful
[37:38] position the one that would reveal to
[37:40] him the treasure that he's been looking
[37:41] for all of his life he had to become
[37:43] like a child so simple that he could
[37:45] believe it in a simple way
[37:48] so simple that he could believe a simple
[37:49] message and believe the scriptures just
[37:51] as they're written amen
[37:54] he would have to be converted and he'd
[37:56] have to be able to forget all of his
[37:58] theology
[38:00] and forget all of his training and of
[38:02] all of his former understanding
[38:04] but he'd have to be converted and come
[38:06] back to being a child of the kingdom one
[38:07] that would just believe what the father
[38:09] says
[38:11] in the smyrnan church age the prophet of
[38:13] god says the son of god can go a long
[38:15] time before he recognizes that he is a
[38:17] son
[38:18] in fact a lot of true christians are
[38:20] like the story of the baby eagle that
[38:22] was hatched out under a hand you know
[38:24] that eagle is a type of the true
[38:25] believer well a farmer took an egg from
[38:27] an eagle's nest and he placed it under a
[38:29] hen in due time all the eggs under the
[38:31] hen hatched out the baby chicks got
[38:34] along fine with the mother hen but the
[38:36] little eagle could not figure out the
[38:37] clucking and scratching for food in the
[38:39] manure pile he managed to make a living
[38:42] but he was pretty confused about it all
[38:44] but one day from way up in the air the
[38:46] mother eagle that had laid the egg spied
[38:48] that little egg on the ground she
[38:50] swooped down with tremendous speed and
[38:52] screamed at the top of her voice for him
[38:54] to fly up to meet her he had never heard
[38:57] an eagle cry but when he heard that
[38:59] first scream something in him stirred he
[39:01] longed to launch out toward it
[39:04] but he was afraid to try again that
[39:07] mother screamed for him to arise in the
[39:08] wind and follow her he screamed back
[39:10] that he was afraid once more she cried
[39:12] out screamed that he tried beating his
[39:14] wings he hurled himself into the air and
[39:17] answered the cry of his mother he soared
[39:19] off into the blue skies
[39:21] you see he always was an eagle he acted
[39:24] like a chicken for a little while but he
[39:26] could not be satisfied
[39:29] but when he heard the call of the great
[39:30] eagle he came to his own place and once
[39:33] a true son of god hears the cry of the
[39:35] spirit by the word he too will realize
[39:38] who he is and run to the great prophet
[39:40] eagle and be with him forever seated in
[39:43] heavenly places in
[39:45] christ
[39:46] jesus
[39:49] how many believe brother john heard an
[39:50] eagle scream
[39:54] and he heard that eagle scream and
[39:56] he had never heard it just that way
[39:59] before
[40:00] he had heard bible verses read
[40:04] had heard sermons but they never heard
[40:07] that certain sound amen that certain
[40:11] sound through the word that certain
[40:13] sound through the scripture remember
[40:14] when he heard that certain sound amen
[40:17] there was a reason the analogy that the
[40:19] prophet's using is an eagle in the
[40:21] chicken yard amen they're all birds but
[40:23] this bird is different than the other
[40:25] birds he's a misfit to the birds and all
[40:27] he knows to do because of what he was
[40:29] hatched under was the emulate to act
[40:31] like what he sees amen but they're
[40:33] coming day that he hears something he's
[40:35] never heard before but when he hears it
[40:38] although the other chickens run away in
[40:40] terror there's one little chicken down
[40:42] there that didn't know he really wasn't
[40:43] a chicken
[40:45] but he heard something that sounded good
[40:48] to him
[40:49] it didn't sound good to anybody else but
[40:51] it sounded good to him and when it
[40:53] sounded it
[40:54] somehow in an odd way though he had
[40:57] never heard it before it sounded
[40:58] familiar
[41:00] isn't that amazing there was something
[41:03] there's a screen that screamed out but
[41:05] there was an echo inside of him somehow
[41:08] he knew that whatever that was i am amen
[41:11] that scream is inside of me that flying
[41:14] thing is in me
[41:16] it's all here i didn't know it before
[41:18] but it's like i always knew it but i
[41:19] know i didn't know it but i know it.
[41:22] amen because when a child of god hears
[41:25] the word amen that come from god where
[41:28] did the child of god come from come from
[41:30] god where did the word come from it come
[41:31] from god
[41:33] they are the same thing a child of god
[41:36] is the word amen when the word comes to
[41:38] the word when they unite they recognize
[41:41] one another
[41:42] [Music]
[41:44] so a child of god come from god
[41:47] the word of god come from god
[41:49] so when the word of god comes to a child
[41:51] of god now i'm not talking about a word
[41:54] of god that's been polluted and diced up
[41:56] and pulled apart and theologically
[41:58] trained and all the meanings gone out of
[42:00] it but when the real word of god amen
[42:03] and all of its power and the originality
[42:05] with which he brought it amen with the
[42:07] original thought and tint with the word
[42:09] when that comes to the ears of a child
[42:11] of god amen is the eagle screaming and
[42:13] something inside of him says what is
[42:16] that
[42:18] i have never heard the gospel that way
[42:20] before i have never shared the
[42:22] scriptures that way before
[42:25] amen
[42:28] then a child of god says
[42:31] that
[42:32] is who i am
[42:35] i still may be far away from where that
[42:37] is but that's who i am
[42:40] and the eagle scream kept drawing and
[42:42] drawing until the ego had enough courage
[42:44] to start flapping the wings and start
[42:46] lifting off the earth and and we know
[42:48] the first landing place was the post and
[42:50] the chicken yard but that wasn't high
[42:52] enough yet kept flapping and before too
[42:54] long the eagle was flying in the same
[42:56] realm that the eagle scream came from
[42:59] because that's where it was ordained to
[43:01] be
[43:02] in the book of jeremiah god is speaking
[43:04] to jeremiah the prophet in chapter one
[43:06] he says then the word of the lord came
[43:08] unto me saying before i formed thee in
[43:10] the belly i knew thee and before thou
[43:12] cometh forth out of the womb i
[43:14] sanctified thee and i ordained thee a
[43:17] prophet unto the nations
[43:19] so before
[43:21] before i formed thee in the belly i knew
[43:24] thee that's amazing
[43:27] god had four knowledge and he's sharing
[43:30] with jeremiah jeremiah has a commission
[43:33] and the commission on earth is difficult
[43:34] for jeremiah to perform so for god in
[43:37] order to get jeremiah in position and
[43:39] get jeremiah to do what jeremiah needs
[43:40] to do god is going to have to break a
[43:43] seal of understanding to jeremiah and
[43:45] open up his understanding to a higher
[43:47] level and say listen jeremiah before you
[43:50] were formed in the belly i knew you
[43:54] and before you come us forth from the
[43:56] womb i sanctified thee and ordained thee
[43:59] a prophet unto the nations
[44:02] what did jeremiah have to do with that
[44:04] he had nothing to do with that that was
[44:06] god's will that was god's purpose for
[44:08] his life
[44:09] so in order for jeremiah to go and be
[44:11] the voice of the lord in that day to cry
[44:13] against all the evils in jerusalem to be
[44:16] the one who's bringing the word for his
[44:18] day god had to open up a level of
[44:20] understanding that would give jeremiah
[44:22] the courage to take his god-given
[44:24] position
[44:26] and god has done the same thing for us
[44:28] in this day he has peeled back a seal of
[44:30] understanding so that we can see that
[44:32] before i was formed in the belly he knew
[44:35] me before i came forth he sanctified and
[44:38] ordained me amen to do what i'm doing
[44:40] today
[44:42] he ordained our brother john our brother
[44:44] john didn't wake up one day and said i'm
[44:46] going to be the best witness or the
[44:47] message has ever seen it was already in
[44:50] him god foresaw it before the foundation
[44:52] of the world but god opened a seal of
[44:54] understanding so that brother john could
[44:56] step into the role that god had ordained
[44:58] him to be in
[44:59] he brought him the message to take him
[45:01] back so he could understand i come from
[45:03] the mind of god god thought of me and he
[45:06] foresaw me and he knew me here and it
[45:08] gave him the courage to move forward and
[45:10] be what he was ordained to be
[45:14] it was god's calling it was god's wish
[45:16] it was god's desire
[45:18] what we saw in the life of our brother
[45:20] john is what god foresaw
[45:23] it wasn't john's desire to be the way he
[45:26] was
[45:28] he was the way he was by design
[45:32] that's why
[45:33] brother john could strike up a
[45:34] conversation with somebody in the
[45:36] opposite gas pump
[45:38] have them weeping and praying
[45:41] at the bumper of their vehicle
[45:44] and i look over there and nothing i
[45:46] can't get my feet to move i can't get my
[45:48] mouth open
[45:52] amen
[45:54] he was what he was by the will of god
[45:57] by the purpose that god had purposed for
[45:58] him and we are the same
[46:03] i'd like to look at a story out of luke
[46:05] chapter seven
[46:07] if i can luke chapter seven we know the
[46:10] story really well but i'd like to
[46:12] like to look at it
[46:13] together in this context
[46:18] luke 7 and 36 and one of the pharisees
[46:21] desired him that he would eat with him
[46:24] and he went into the pharisees house and
[46:26] sat down to meet and behold a woman in
[46:28] the city which was a sinner when she
[46:30] knew that jesus sat at meat in the
[46:32] pharisees house
[46:34] brought an alabaster box of ointment
[46:36] and stood at his feet behind him weeping
[46:38] and began to wash his feet with tears
[46:41] and then wiped them with the hairs of
[46:42] her head and kissed his feet and
[46:44] anointed him with the ointment
[46:46] now when the pharisees which had bitten
[46:48] him saw it he spake within himself
[46:50] saying this man if he were a prophet
[46:53] would have known who and what manner of
[46:55] woman this is that toucheth him for she
[46:57] is a sinner
[46:59] and jesus answered and said unto him
[47:01] simon i have somewhat to say unto thee
[47:04] and he said master say on
[47:06] so there was a certain creditor which
[47:08] had two debtors the one which owed five
[47:11] thousand pence and the other fifty
[47:13] when they had nothing to pay he frankly
[47:15] forgave them both
[47:16] tell me therefore which of them will
[47:18] love him most
[47:19] simon answered and said i suppose that
[47:21] he to whom he forgave most and he said
[47:24] unto him thou has rightly judged
[47:27] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[47:29] simon
[47:30] seest thou this woman
[47:32] i entered into thine house thou gaves me
[47:35] no water for thy feet
[47:37] but she had washed my feet with her
[47:39] tears
[47:40] and wiped them with the hairs of her
[47:41] head thou gave me no kiss but this woman
[47:44] since the time i came in hath not ceased
[47:47] to kiss my feet
[47:48] my head with oil thou does not anoint
[47:50] but this woman hath anointed my feet
[47:52] with ointment
[47:54] wherefore i say unto thee her sins which
[47:56] are many are forgiven
[47:59] for she loved much but to whom little is
[48:02] forgiven the same loveth little
[48:04] and he said unto her thy sins are
[48:07] forgiven
[48:10] i don't remember her asking
[48:12] him to forgive her sins
[48:15] but jesus knew what she had need of
[48:18] and when she recognized christ in her
[48:20] day
[48:22] and she gave everything to him
[48:26] jesus turned to the woman who hadn't
[48:28] asked yet
[48:29] and said thy sins are all forgiven
[48:33] she recognized what the pharisee missed
[48:36] she caught the mystery the secret of who
[48:39] this was sitting at this table
[48:42] when simon gave him no welcome
[48:45] what was jesus he was the word made
[48:47] flesh
[48:48] he was the anointed word of god for that
[48:50] day
[48:52] and he was in their presence and they
[48:54] missed it
[48:56] and the pharisee who should have known
[48:58] didn't know
[48:59] and the pharisee who is now judging and
[49:02] becoming critical and and jesus now is
[49:05] teaching a valuable lesson this woman
[49:08] because there was something in her could
[49:10] recognize the value of this man
[49:13] the importance of this man simon didn't
[49:16] recognize it and simon showed him a
[49:18] great disservice and a dishonor by not
[49:21] welcoming him with a kiss by not
[49:22] anointing him and not washing his feet
[49:24] he did not bid him welcome he invited
[49:26] him but didn't bid him welcome jesus
[49:29] come according to the invitation but
[49:31] simon didn't honor he didn't value this
[49:34] one who had come
[49:37] but this woman though she was a sinner
[49:39] she put great value on the one that was
[49:42] sitting at simon's table and she bust
[49:45] her way in and took a amen she took a an
[49:48] alabaster box full of ointment another
[49:51] scripture says very precious amen of
[49:53] much worth and she breaks it amen and
[49:56] what she was doing is she was giving all
[49:58] that she had amen to this one that was
[50:00] sitting at the table that was
[50:02] unrecognized by the masses but there was
[50:04] a little sinner woman who had caught the
[50:06] value of this person
[50:08] because this is the word of god made
[50:11] manifest this is god in our day
[50:15] and she took the most valuable things
[50:17] she had and she ran in there in front of
[50:20] everybody who would scorn her and
[50:21] ridicule they all knew she was a sinner
[50:25] and she ran in there because the value
[50:27] of the person who was present was worth
[50:29] the ridicule and scorn and judgment and
[50:32] critical attitudes and critical
[50:34] statements it was worth her breaking the
[50:36] alabaster box and listen friends she
[50:39] didn't open the alabaster box and get a
[50:40] little out and sprinkle it on his feet
[50:42] there was no going back there was no
[50:44] reserve she didn't even tip it over to
[50:46] give a little pour out of the corner she
[50:48] broke the alabaster box this was a point
[50:51] of no return she could not recollect
[50:53] this valuable ointment
[50:56] but she saw the exchange rate as more
[50:58] than worth it amen this one sitting here
[51:01] is well worth more worthy than this box
[51:04] of ointment is
[51:06] and she took the most valuable things
[51:08] she had she took everything and she
[51:10] threw it down and broke it at his feet
[51:12] anointed his feet kissed his feet wept
[51:15] and washed his feet with her tears and
[51:17] wiped him with her hair and when she did
[51:19] this to the word made manifest in her
[51:21] day the word in her day said your sins
[51:23] are forgiven
[51:28] the next verse says and they that sat at
[51:31] me with him begin to say within
[51:32] themselves who is this that forgive us
[51:34] sins
[51:37] and he said to the woman
[51:38] thy faith
[51:40] has saved thee
[51:41] go in peace
[51:44] she didn't say anything
[51:47] we have no record she said anything
[51:50] she couldn't have expressed her faith in
[51:52] words
[51:54] she expressed her faith in action
[51:57] she gave everything
[51:59] for this one sitting at the table
[52:02] i said god help us
[52:06] help us
[52:08] how many times in our lives have we
[52:10] tried to dip a little bit out of our box
[52:12] our alabaster box
[52:15] that we recognize this is a valuable
[52:16] person we recognize this as christ at
[52:18] our midst but i want to dip just i you
[52:21] know i don't want to go all the way
[52:25] i'll dip out of my louder bastard
[52:26] because that's good it's the same
[52:28] ointment it's precious ointment
[52:31] or how many times we do a little more
[52:33] maybe pour out of the corner just a
[52:35] little just tip it up and we'll give him
[52:36] a little more maybe than the next person
[52:38] gave
[52:41] but this woman gave everything
[52:44] she broke her alabaster box when she
[52:46] left there she was going to have none of
[52:49] that ointment
[52:50] she was going to have nothing all that
[52:52] she had saved for
[52:54] all that she was hoping would be her
[52:56] redemption and get her out of this life
[52:58] of sin that she was in she had all saved
[53:00] it up amen and all the money that she
[53:02] had and everything she saved that was
[53:03] going to be her own redemption out of
[53:05] her life of sin she gave it amen and
[53:07] sold out to buy the ointment in the
[53:10] alabaster box and then she took that
[53:12] which was her whole hope for redemption
[53:15] everything that she could do herself to
[53:17] free her from a life of sin she took
[53:19] that and she broke it at his feet there
[53:21] was no other option there was no plan b
[53:23] there was no going back it was all or
[53:25] nothing
[53:28] she broke it all
[53:30] and gave it all to him
[53:32] and what did she walk away from
[53:33] she walked away with more than anybody
[53:36] else could have ever given her
[53:38] she left the scene so much better off
[53:41] than simon the pharisee
[53:44] better often the high priest amen in
[53:46] jerusalem at the temple better off amen
[53:49] than the wealthiest among them in the
[53:50] temple amen she left there better often
[53:53] them all because all her sins were
[53:55] forgiven
[53:57] praise god
[54:00] paul said one time philippians he said
[54:03] though i might also have confidence in
[54:05] the flesh if any other man thinketh that
[54:07] he hath aware of he might trust in the
[54:09] flesh i more
[54:11] circumcised the eighth day of the stock
[54:12] of israel of the tribe of benjamin a
[54:15] hebrew of the hebrews as touching the
[54:17] law of pharisee concerning zeal
[54:19] persecuting the church touching the
[54:21] righteousness which is in the law
[54:22] blameless
[54:23] but what things were gained to me those
[54:25] i counted loss for christ
[54:28] yea doubtless and i count all things but
[54:29] lost for the excellency of the knowledge
[54:31] of christ jesus my lord for whom i have
[54:34] suffered the loss of all things and do
[54:36] count them but dung that i might win
[54:39] christ
[54:40] and being found in him not having my own
[54:42] righteousness which is of the law but
[54:44] that which is through the faith of
[54:46] christ the righteousness which is of god
[54:50] by faith
[54:52] oh
[54:53] paul found what that woman found
[54:57] paul found what our brother john found
[55:00] or maybe john found what paul found who
[55:02] came first
[55:05] but what he found
[55:07] in the
[55:08] exchange of value when he would value it
[55:12] paul the apostle who had everything
[55:14] going for him
[55:16] he had
[55:17] a reputation among the elders and the
[55:20] chief priests
[55:22] he had the best schooling that there was
[55:25] in the school of gamalio
[55:28] he had a reputation where they would
[55:29] trust him and they would give him
[55:31] letters that he could go into damascus
[55:33] to bring christians and and bound into
[55:36] prison and return him to jerusalem
[55:38] he was
[55:39] he had everything that he wanted going
[55:42] for him
[55:44] but when he met the pillar of fire
[55:46] on the road to damascus
[55:48] he actually found the thing that he
[55:50] really wanted
[55:51] he was zealous over the religion of his
[55:53] fathers because he didn't know anything
[55:55] else amen but he was zealous because he
[55:57] wanted god he was zealous because he
[55:59] wanted to be he wanted to be found of
[56:01] god in the faith he wanted to please god
[56:03] he wanted to find god and he was doing
[56:05] everything that he knew how to do but
[56:06] when he met the pillar of fire he
[56:08] finally found the thing that he was
[56:10] actually looking for
[56:12] and the thing the only thing that would
[56:14] actually survive
[56:15] supply
[56:16] amen would actually
[56:18] be sufficient for meeting the need that
[56:19] was within him for what he was actually
[56:21] looking for was in that pillar of fire
[56:23] and when he met the pillar of fire what
[56:25] was it it was jesus christ
[56:27] but not jesus christ amen the body that
[56:30] the nail pierced hands he had returned
[56:32] back to the pillar of fire he was now in
[56:34] the form of spirit and he was speaking
[56:36] to him and who was it it was none other
[56:38] than jesus christ
[56:41] and jesus said why do you persecute me
[56:44] now you know and the apostle paul didn't
[56:46] see a physical outline of a person he
[56:48] saw a light
[56:50] and that light said why do you persecute
[56:52] me and we have no record that that the
[56:54] apostle paul ever did anything to the
[56:57] physical body of jesus christ before the
[56:59] crucifixion
[57:00] [Music]
[57:02] but we know that when he persecuted the
[57:04] church
[57:07] because by the baptism of the holy ghost
[57:09] at pentecost the church had become the
[57:11] body
[57:12] of jesus christ
[57:14] and when he persecuted the church paul
[57:17] didn't recognize
[57:19] who was in these people
[57:22] he didn't recognize amen i'm zealous to
[57:25] stop the people but what they have is
[57:27] what i need what they have is what i
[57:29] want
[57:31] so god in his grace and mercy he stops
[57:34] him by a pillar of fire and he tells him
[57:36] why are you persecuting me
[57:39] he was persecuting the church
[57:42] which is him
[57:44] his tabernacle
[57:46] his dwelling place
[57:50] see
[57:52] we know
[57:53] by the scriptures
[57:55] that christ has been moving through the
[57:57] entire bible
[57:59] age by age dispensation by dispensation
[58:03] the scriptures tell us that pharaoh he
[58:05] refused to be called the the son of
[58:08] pharaoh's daughter amen forsaking the
[58:10] riches of egypt for the reproach of
[58:12] christ
[58:14] so that means christ was there in
[58:16] moses's day
[58:18] he could bear the reproach of christ
[58:21] we know also hebrews tells us amen that
[58:24] they did all drink from that spiritual
[58:25] rock and that rock was
[58:28] christ so in the wilderness there was
[58:30] christ
[58:32] so that means through this whole bible
[58:35] as the word is coming into manifestation
[58:38] what was in god's mind as it becomes
[58:40] materialized and in manifestation it's
[58:42] christ it's christ there it's christ
[58:44] here it's christ here it's christ here
[58:47] and everybody is receiving salvation
[58:50] based off how they deal with christ
[58:54] when when they drank from that spiritual
[58:56] rock that rock was christ amen what was
[58:58] it doing it was providing salvation for
[59:00] them they were going to die amen from
[59:02] dehydration but god christ was smitten
[59:05] and christ opened up and christ gave the
[59:08] water of life and they drank and they
[59:09] survived
[59:11] so in every age and every dispensation
[59:14] there was christ because christ is the
[59:15] anointed word the word may manifest for
[59:17] your day
[59:19] that's what paul met
[59:21] he met jesus christ
[59:23] not the one not in the same form the
[59:26] same one but not the same form
[59:29] now he was persecuting christ how was he
[59:32] persecuting christ when he was
[59:33] persecuting his body
[59:36] because now christ was in this
[59:37] manifestation of the church
[59:44] amen that's why the bible
[59:48] tells us in hebrews 13 8
[59:51] if you look at brother john's hat in the
[59:52] picture there
[59:53] he wore that hat everywhere
[59:56] he had that hat made as a witnessing
[59:57] tool
[59:58] that has started a lot of discussions
[1:00:01] and that is hebrews 13 8
[1:00:04] jesus christ the same
[1:00:07] yesterday
[1:00:09] today
[1:00:10] and forever
[1:00:12] it's the same jesus christ
[1:00:14] it may not be in the same form but it's
[1:00:16] the same jesus christ
[1:00:18] and he would use it as a witnessing tool
[1:00:20] to show that the christ is there is the
[1:00:23] christ the tear
[1:00:25] the christ that's always been is the
[1:00:27] christ that's here is the christ that
[1:00:29] will be forever jesus christ the same
[1:00:31] yesterday today and forever and brother
[1:00:34] john was trying to introduce people to
[1:00:36] that living jesus christ
[1:00:40] where was he he was in john
[1:00:45] where was that hebrews 13 8 where was it
[1:00:48] it was in the man wearing the hat
[1:00:51] the man wearing the hat was declaring
[1:00:53] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:00:55] today and forever well where is he look
[1:00:57] under the hat amen if you look under the
[1:00:59] hat you'll find the dwelling place of
[1:01:01] that same hebrews 13 8 jesus christ
[1:01:04] for now he's dwelling in a body of
[1:01:06] believers amen he's dwelling in his
[1:01:08] bride upon the earth
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:15] people didn't know what they came in
[1:01:16] contact with
[1:01:19] it wasn't john the man that you could
[1:01:21] touch and shake his hand
[1:01:23] it was what was in john
[1:01:25] it was the life of christ that was in
[1:01:27] him that came to unite with that word
[1:01:29] that laid in there and sprung it to life
[1:01:31] and now was living out through brother
[1:01:33] john that was a portion of the spirit of
[1:01:36] god the portion of christ was walking
[1:01:38] around in our brother and people would
[1:01:40] come in contact with him and they didn't
[1:01:41] really know who they were coming in
[1:01:43] contact with
[1:01:46] because had they known they wouldn't
[1:01:48] have broken any alabaster boxes at
[1:01:51] john's feet
[1:01:52] but they would have broke it for the
[1:01:54] life that was in him for christ that was
[1:01:56] anointing this man to speak to them he
[1:01:58] would point them to christ and they
[1:01:59] would turn to christ and if they would
[1:02:01] recognize who this was and what
[1:02:03] manifestation we were under and where
[1:02:05] christ was and what this word was that
[1:02:07] john was giving them they would turn to
[1:02:08] christ and they would break their
[1:02:09] alabaster box and give him everything
[1:02:12] they had
[1:02:16] he had some that would
[1:02:19] and some that wouldn't
[1:02:21] here's one that would
[1:02:24] amen
[1:02:26] oh thank god for the life of a believer
[1:02:35] first corinthians 12 7 says but the
[1:02:37] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[1:02:39] every man to profit with all
[1:02:42] for the one is given by the spirit the
[1:02:44] word of wisdom to another the word of
[1:02:46] knowledge by the same spirit to another
[1:02:48] faith by the same spirit to another
[1:02:49] gifts of healing by the same spirit to
[1:02:52] another the working of miracles to
[1:02:54] another prophecy to another discerning
[1:02:55] of spirits to another diverse kinds of
[1:02:58] tongues to another the interpretation of
[1:02:59] tongues
[1:03:00] but all these worketh that one and
[1:03:02] self-same spirit dividing to every man
[1:03:05] severally as he will
[1:03:06] for as the body is one now he's starting
[1:03:09] to type this spiritual body of christ
[1:03:11] with your physical body
[1:03:13] for as the body is one and half many
[1:03:16] members
[1:03:17] all the members of that one body being
[1:03:19] many are one
[1:03:21] so also is
[1:03:23] christ
[1:03:26] he didn't say christ is like that he
[1:03:28] said that's what christ is
[1:03:30] he is
[1:03:31] a many-membered body
[1:03:34] all these members together amen are
[1:03:37] containing and holding the life of
[1:03:38] christ
[1:03:40] amen his life is on the earth
[1:03:44] in the vessels that he has chosen to
[1:03:46] walk in
[1:03:48] and each of these members have gifts and
[1:03:50] they differ severally as they will we've
[1:03:52] already shared with you brother john's
[1:03:54] gift and how i can't match his gift i
[1:03:56] can't even come close to matching his
[1:03:57] gift
[1:03:59] but his gift couldn't match my gift and
[1:04:01] i couldn't take his place and he
[1:04:02] couldn't take my place
[1:04:04] and i can't take your place and you
[1:04:06] can't take my place but oh praise god if
[1:04:08] brother john was here amen he would
[1:04:10] support my place and i support his place
[1:04:13] if he was here today he would back there
[1:04:14] and once or twice already he would have
[1:04:15] done that
[1:04:18] and that'd been the same as saying
[1:04:20] sickem boy and i would have went a
[1:04:21] little bit harder amen
[1:04:24] because we all have a part to play and
[1:04:26] we always want to encourage each other
[1:04:27] in our part to play and value one
[1:04:29] another
[1:04:30] and the part that we play
[1:04:35] colossians 1 26 says even the mystery
[1:04:37] which has been hid from ages and from
[1:04:39] generations
[1:04:41] those are the mystery that was paul was
[1:04:42] now beginning to preach that was hid in
[1:04:45] the old testament
[1:04:46] but he was going to begin speaking this
[1:04:48] mystery
[1:04:50] but now is made manifest to his saints
[1:04:52] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:04:54] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:04:56] among the gentiles which is
[1:04:58] christ in you
[1:05:00] the hope of glory
[1:05:02] that's the mystery
[1:05:03] that's why i could say what was under
[1:05:06] that hat
[1:05:07] the fulfillment of that hat
[1:05:09] what was under that hat a living portion
[1:05:12] of scripture that scripture living out
[1:05:14] under the hat
[1:05:17] oh how many how many simon's missed it
[1:05:21] how many sinners caught it
[1:05:24] praise god
[1:05:27] brother branham says in the message
[1:05:28] things that are to be
[1:05:30] now the only way that you can be a son
[1:05:32] or daughter of god because you
[1:05:34] have to have eternal life and there's
[1:05:35] only one form of eternal life and that's
[1:05:37] god's life
[1:05:38] only one form of eternal life that was
[1:05:41] god
[1:05:42] there to be a son of god you had to be
[1:05:44] in him always
[1:05:46] the gene of your life spiritual life
[1:05:48] tonight was in god the father before
[1:05:50] there was even a molecule and you are
[1:05:52] nothing but the manifestation of the
[1:05:54] gene of the life that was in god as a
[1:05:57] son of god
[1:05:58] now you're expressed after his word has
[1:06:00] come in you
[1:06:01] to light up this age
[1:06:04] what are you expressed for
[1:06:05] after this word is coming to you you're
[1:06:07] expressed to light up this age you're to
[1:06:09] be the light in this age
[1:06:12] jesus when he was here on earth he says
[1:06:14] i am the light of the world then he
[1:06:16] looks at his disciples says you are the
[1:06:17] light of the world
[1:06:18] so who's the light of the world
[1:06:20] he is
[1:06:22] well where is he when you find out where
[1:06:24] he is then you'll find out where the
[1:06:25] light is
[1:06:29] now you're expressed after his word is
[1:06:30] coming you to light up this age you are
[1:06:32] expressing god's life in you because you
[1:06:34] are a son or daughter of god therefore
[1:06:36] you get what i mean
[1:06:38] see you are now made you're sitting in
[1:06:40] this church tonight because your duty is
[1:06:42] to express god to this nation and this
[1:06:45] people in this neighborhood where you
[1:06:47] associate where wherever you are god
[1:06:49] knew that you would be here because you
[1:06:51] have to be one of his genes or his
[1:06:53] attributes you had to be if you ever if
[1:06:55] you've got eternal life then it always
[1:06:57] was eternal life and god before there
[1:06:59] was a foundation of the world knew that
[1:07:01] you would be here and when the word or
[1:07:03] the water the washing of the water of
[1:07:05] the word fell upon you it was expressed
[1:07:07] in a being now you have fellowship with
[1:07:09] your father god just as you have with
[1:07:11] your earthly father you are citizens of
[1:07:13] the king not citizens but you are
[1:07:15] children sons and daughters of the
[1:07:16] living god if it be that eternal life
[1:07:19] dwells in you
[1:07:21] our duty
[1:07:23] is to express god
[1:07:25] to this nation this community where we
[1:07:27] live to be the light to shine the light
[1:07:30] the way our brother john shine the light
[1:07:32] we may not all shine it the same way but
[1:07:34] it's our duty to shine
[1:07:37] you know there was a bright and shining
[1:07:39] light that was coming through our
[1:07:40] brother and we enjoyed it and god's
[1:07:42] decided to take that light back home
[1:07:44] amen but there's going to be no lacking
[1:07:46] in the body there's going to be light
[1:07:48] shining in this body and god's not going
[1:07:49] to have a lack of a witness on this
[1:07:51] earth somebody else is going to have to
[1:07:53] fill that
[1:07:54] role the question is who will it be amen
[1:07:58] because there's no lack in the body
[1:08:00] every joint supplyeth if god chose to
[1:08:03] take brother john home it's because he
[1:08:05] ran his course
[1:08:06] he kept the faith he finished the work
[1:08:08] that god purposed for him to do but that
[1:08:10] job is not now going to go unfulfilled
[1:08:12] that job is going to fall on somebody
[1:08:14] else
[1:08:15] so who is it amen it's a good question
[1:08:19] only time will tell
[1:08:20] it won't be the person that says oh me
[1:08:22] me me i'll do what john did you can't
[1:08:25] unless you were born for it
[1:08:28] but the one that was born the one that
[1:08:29] was ordained amen is the one that can be
[1:08:32] anointed and the one that can be
[1:08:33] anointed it can be inspired can go forth
[1:08:35] and do as our brother den
[1:08:37] because the spirit divided severally as
[1:08:39] he will
[1:08:41] i'd like to share with you a story just
[1:08:43] as we close
[1:08:44] on a story that brother john told me
[1:08:48] and i may get some of the details messed
[1:08:50] up because you know i mess up details
[1:08:52] sometimes
[1:08:53] but the point of the story is profound
[1:08:55] to me
[1:08:56] and i wish that i had heard it again
[1:08:59] but you know how it is when somebody's
[1:09:01] sharing something with you never
[1:09:02] realized this could be the last time
[1:09:03] they ever tell me that
[1:09:05] that's the way it was with brother john
[1:09:06] but he had told me this story twice
[1:09:10] and it happened the fulfillment of it
[1:09:12] happened just about a year one to two
[1:09:14] years ago but it started many years
[1:09:16] before that
[1:09:17] and he and his wife sister wilma were in
[1:09:19] a store they were shopping
[1:09:22] and i've tried before the name the store
[1:09:23] but there's no point naming it because i
[1:09:25] can't remember
[1:09:26] but they were shopping in a store
[1:09:28] and you know
[1:09:30] as odd as it seems he would run into
[1:09:33] somebody and start a conversation
[1:09:36] and so he in his shopping cart and wilma
[1:09:39] and this other man they began a
[1:09:41] conversation and brother john said it
[1:09:43] started something like this
[1:09:45] hello how are you oh i'm fine how are
[1:09:47] you the world is sure crazy isn't it
[1:09:50] yes it is it must be the end times and
[1:09:52] brother john said end times
[1:09:54] what do you know about the end times
[1:09:56] and then he went on and on he started
[1:09:58] sharing about end time prophecy and end
[1:10:00] time revelation and they talked for some
[1:10:02] time and brother john said i asked the
[1:10:04] man his name and he says my name is
[1:10:06] nicodemus
[1:10:08] so he had a name that john was not going
[1:10:09] to forget
[1:10:10] he said my name is nicodemus
[1:10:13] and he says i'm here with my wife she's
[1:10:15] in another part of the store and they
[1:10:16] talked and he asked for john's name
[1:10:20] and no he didn't ask for john i'm sorry
[1:10:22] he didn't know john's name john asked
[1:10:23] him his name nicodemus and asked him
[1:10:25] where he worked and he said i work at a
[1:10:27] machine shop in a certain place outside
[1:10:29] of town here and john roughly knew where
[1:10:31] what area he was talking about and and
[1:10:33] he said that his name was nicodemus he
[1:10:35] said he never asked me my name and i
[1:10:36] never told him where i lived i didn't
[1:10:37] tell you anything about me i just had
[1:10:39] that much information from him we were
[1:10:40] talking about the end times
[1:10:42] he said that was it we ended the
[1:10:44] conversation he left he said as far as
[1:10:47] john remembered they just took their
[1:10:49] time going over
[1:10:50] did whatever they were doing went to
[1:10:52] checkout checked out and left
[1:10:54] and that was all he remembered of the
[1:10:55] story
[1:10:57] later he would come to find out
[1:10:59] that that man was so excited about what
[1:11:02] he was hearing and so impressed that he
[1:11:04] went to go find his wife because he
[1:11:05] wanted his wife to meet john and wilma
[1:11:08] so he went and got his wife and they
[1:11:09] come back looking for him and they could
[1:11:11] not find him he said i walked all down
[1:11:13] the aisles i walked by the checkout and
[1:11:15] i said i could not find you you were
[1:11:17] gone
[1:11:19] john didn't know this he didn't know the
[1:11:20] man looked all over for him couldn't
[1:11:22] find him and and and then the man's mind
[1:11:24] nicodemus is mine it was odd
[1:11:27] so john and wilma they go on and do what
[1:11:29] they're going to do and they and they
[1:11:31] they go on about life and that was that
[1:11:32] was it
[1:11:33] and it was many years later i don't
[1:11:35] remember the number of years but many
[1:11:36] years later after sister wilma had
[1:11:39] already passed away
[1:11:40] about one to two years ago
[1:11:42] john has a dream in the morning just
[1:11:45] before he wakes up
[1:11:47] and in the dream he walks into a machine
[1:11:50] shop he sees the machine shop he walks
[1:11:52] in the door and he asked to see
[1:11:54] nicodemus and nicodemus comes to him and
[1:11:57] nicodemus looks at him and says who are
[1:11:58] you and he says i'm john the revelator
[1:12:02] that was the part john didn't like
[1:12:04] telling
[1:12:05] before he told me that he goes now
[1:12:06] listen brother chad i'm just going to
[1:12:08] tell you what i saw in the dream i'm not
[1:12:10] making anything of it so he's a little
[1:12:12] bit bashful about that part
[1:12:14] i'm john the revelator
[1:12:16] and said then he woke up
[1:12:18] he woke up
[1:12:20] and he says
[1:12:21] i didn't know what to do
[1:12:23] so all i knew to do was try to find the
[1:12:25] machine shop
[1:12:26] so he gets out of bed he gets dressed
[1:12:27] and he drives over he said i roughly
[1:12:29] knew what area was talking about and and
[1:12:31] what on this road outside of this town
[1:12:34] he says i drove straight to the machine
[1:12:36] shop like i knew exactly where it was
[1:12:40] and i pulled him and i got out and i and
[1:12:42] i walked in
[1:12:44] and said when i walked in
[1:12:46] uh there was a young man
[1:12:48] at the at the table or the desk there he
[1:12:51] said i didn't realize it but it was
[1:12:52] nicodemus's son and nicodemus and his
[1:12:54] brother owned the machine shop he didn't
[1:12:55] know any of that at that time
[1:12:57] he says
[1:12:58] can i speak with a nicodemus does he
[1:13:00] work here and he says yes so the young
[1:13:01] man went to get him and when nicodemus
[1:13:03] walked through that door brother john
[1:13:05] says brother chad it was like he saw a
[1:13:07] ghost he just stared at me
[1:13:09] and he said who are you and brother john
[1:13:12] said i'm john the
[1:13:13] [Laughter]
[1:13:16] revelator he said i didn't know what
[1:13:18] else to do but just exactly what i saw
[1:13:24] and so he said i'm here to talk to you
[1:13:26] and share with you about the message
[1:13:28] and he said that man said listen i've
[1:13:30] got to tell you something
[1:13:33] he said
[1:13:34] last night or the night before last i
[1:13:36] can't remember which one it was
[1:13:38] i had a bible study at my church and in
[1:13:40] my bible study at the church i come to
[1:13:41] the scripture that talked about
[1:13:43] entertaining angels unawares
[1:13:46] and i told that group that isaiah and
[1:13:48] the bible say i told him all about that
[1:13:50] meeting you and what you were telling me
[1:13:51] about end time revelations and
[1:13:53] prophecies and how i went to get my wife
[1:13:55] and come and get you and you had
[1:13:56] vanished and i told them i believed you
[1:13:58] were an angel of the lord
[1:14:00] and that i entertained an angel unaware
[1:14:03] he wasn't really far from the truth
[1:14:06] because an angel is a messenger
[1:14:10] and that's why he was so stunned when
[1:14:12] the next morning or the morning after
[1:14:14] john comes walking in his door and says
[1:14:15] i'm john the revelator
[1:14:18] so they sat down there for hours they
[1:14:20] bought them lunch they had lunch
[1:14:21] together he said his wife he told him he
[1:14:23] went got his wife told his wife his wife
[1:14:25] come in she was stunned she was
[1:14:26] surprised and he got to sit and explain
[1:14:29] to them the message and share it with
[1:14:30] them
[1:14:31] had a good time and then they left and
[1:14:32] that was a year or two ago we don't know
[1:14:34] what's come of that
[1:14:36] but i just share that to show what kind
[1:14:38] of life our brother john lived and what
[1:14:41] gift was in him amen god knew just who
[1:14:44] to sin to that machine shot
[1:14:46] god knew whatever five or eight years it
[1:14:48] was before just who to have walked
[1:14:51] through the grocery store because he
[1:14:52] would actually talk to that man
[1:14:55] like if i was walking to him god would
[1:14:56] have to say talk to him
[1:15:00] but he knew john would just do it
[1:15:03] he he orchestrated his life amen he
[1:15:06] ordered it and john fulfilled the order
[1:15:08] of the lord i believe with all my heart
[1:15:10] he did what god had him on this earth to
[1:15:11] do
[1:15:14] there's a
[1:15:16] saying when i was a boy there was a
[1:15:18] preacher he was quite an elderly
[1:15:19] preacher by the time i was coming up but
[1:15:21] he's one of my grandpa's contemporaries
[1:15:23] his name is cash ambergee
[1:15:26] and he was a revival preacher and
[1:15:27] brother branham mentions him
[1:15:29] before on tape a couple times they
[1:15:31] preached together in new york meetings
[1:15:33] but when i was a boy they would every
[1:15:36] time cash would come by and visit the
[1:15:37] church they would always ask him to
[1:15:39] testify which that was the pentecostal
[1:15:41] way hey brother testify and he would
[1:15:42] stand up in his seat i remember it and i
[1:15:45] remember i was scared of him
[1:15:47] because he had a little leather wrap
[1:15:48] around his thumb because he only had a
[1:15:50] stub of a thumb
[1:15:51] because he was in a snake handling
[1:15:53] church in pentecost and he got bit by
[1:15:55] big jim and he lost the tip of his thumb
[1:15:58] so i remember as a boy being scared to
[1:16:01] death of cash amber because i know that
[1:16:02] he had poison in his thumb
[1:16:04] when i was a little bitty kid but this
[1:16:06] is who cash was and he quit believing in
[1:16:09] snake handling after that
[1:16:11] but anyways
[1:16:12] so he had this little leather wrap on
[1:16:14] his hand and he was quite elderly at
[1:16:15] this time and so i remember him well as
[1:16:18] a boy i was there one time and they say
[1:16:19] cash you want to testify and he stood up
[1:16:22] and he threw his hand in the air he says
[1:16:23] there's but one life and it soon will
[1:16:26] pass and only what's done for christ
[1:16:29] will last
[1:16:31] as he got older that would be the only
[1:16:33] thing he would say when they asked him
[1:16:35] to testify there's one but one life and
[1:16:37] it soon will pass and only what's done
[1:16:40] for christ will last
[1:16:43] what do we remember most about brother
[1:16:45] john
[1:16:46] that which was done for christ
[1:16:48] that part which will last
[1:16:51] what about us
[1:16:53] time continues
[1:16:55] we're allowed to go another decade two
[1:16:57] decades four decades five decades
[1:16:59] however long this continues on
[1:17:02] what will be said will there be a
[1:17:04] celebration of life for us and what will
[1:17:05] be celebrated in our life
[1:17:08] will it be celebrated
[1:17:11] that we sold all about the field that
[1:17:12] had the treasure
[1:17:14] will it be celebrated about us that we
[1:17:16] found the pearl of great price and we
[1:17:18] saw all of everything we had
[1:17:21] reputation and everything to have this
[1:17:24] will it be said of us
[1:17:26] that the thing that he did most and
[1:17:28] mattered most not his sideline gig not
[1:17:31] what he did on the side go to church
[1:17:33] yeah he was this this and this andy went
[1:17:35] to this church
[1:17:36] i don't want that to be said about me i
[1:17:39] want it to be said he was a christian
[1:17:41] man who lived for god and he had this
[1:17:42] job
[1:17:44] that's the order it should come in
[1:17:47] he was a first it should be he served
[1:17:49] god with all of his might he was
[1:17:50] wonderful to his family as a husband and
[1:17:52] a father and he went to this church
[1:17:56] i would love it to be in that order
[1:17:58] that's the order it should be in friends
[1:18:01] i believe that's the order it was in for
[1:18:02] our brother john
[1:18:04] and i thank god that i can preach this
[1:18:05] celebration of life amen with a clear
[1:18:08] conscience and say that matches our
[1:18:09] brother's life
[1:18:11] it's a wonderful thing
[1:18:13] prophet of god said friend death does
[1:18:15] not change a man
[1:18:17] it just changes your dwelling place
[1:18:22] so what do you think brother john did
[1:18:23] when he got to the sixth dimension
[1:18:26] he started fellowshipping of course we
[1:18:28] know exactly what he did because death
[1:18:31] does not change your death only changes
[1:18:33] your dwelling place
[1:18:35] and he probably i don't know i don't
[1:18:37] know what it's like there exactly i
[1:18:39] don't know what you feel like or what
[1:18:40] you understand or don't understand but i
[1:18:42] can imagine when he crossed to the sixth
[1:18:44] dimension and he was reunited with wilma
[1:18:46] he probably said tell me everything
[1:18:47] you've learned since you've been in here
[1:18:51] what have we been missing amen what's
[1:18:53] the other pieces what do you know
[1:18:55] what's happening next
[1:18:58] because death doesn't change you
[1:19:00] it only changes your dwelling place
[1:19:03] this is the only opportunity we have
[1:19:06] to give all to christ in this dimension
[1:19:08] in our bodies like this
[1:19:10] and i say let john's life be an
[1:19:12] inspiration to each of us
[1:19:14] let's break the alabaster box
[1:19:17] stop dipping portions out but let's just
[1:19:19] go ahead and
[1:19:20] break it
[1:19:22] and give it all
[1:19:24] let's quit trying to work a deal
[1:19:27] to hold the pearl and the other valuable
[1:19:29] things
[1:19:31] let's quit trying to get a lease
[1:19:33] on the land that has the treasure hidden
[1:19:35] inside
[1:19:37] but let's just sell everything and buy
[1:19:39] it
[1:19:40] let's just get everything else up for
[1:19:41] this pearl let's just break down the
[1:19:42] bastard box let's just give everything
[1:19:46] and if we can be inspired today by the
[1:19:48] life of our brother just to give them
[1:19:50] all then i'll say our brother will be
[1:19:52] happy
[1:19:53] that his celebration of life convinced
[1:19:55] us to go ahead and give them all
[1:19:58] and make a total surrender
[1:20:00] and god bless you friends we love you
[1:20:03] we're all here because we love the lord
[1:20:05] and we love brother john
[1:20:07] and may his memory amen be a pleasant
[1:20:09] one and a happy one
[1:20:11] for us all
[1:20:12] brother john if you can come we'll sing
[1:20:14] another song as we're dismissed
[1:20:17] ask the musicians to come with him
[1:20:20] let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:20:23] lord jesus we thank you
[1:20:26] for the great privilege of being able to
[1:20:27] gather in this place today
[1:20:30] to be able to look at your word and say
[1:20:32] how wonderful it is lord and how much we
[1:20:35] love you
[1:20:36] we watched how much our brother loved
[1:20:38] you and how much he gave us all for this
[1:20:40] word
[1:20:41] and it inspires us lord to want to be
[1:20:43] the same
[1:20:45] i want to give you all lord
[1:20:47] let me walk forward from this day on not
[1:20:49] holding any portion back but let me give
[1:20:51] you everything
[1:20:52] and let the primary thing in my life and
[1:20:54] the life of everyone who's here
[1:20:56] be to give you all and to worship you
[1:20:59] alone
[1:21:00] may everything else in our life be
[1:21:02] counted as though it were done in
[1:21:03] comparison
[1:21:04] to christ
[1:21:06] lord i pray that you would bless the
[1:21:08] family
[1:21:09] they've already had time to mourn at the
[1:21:11] loss of our brother they'll continue to
[1:21:14] do so
[1:21:15] but may their memories be happy ones
[1:21:18] may there be some
[1:21:19] a thought of thanksgiving in their heart
[1:21:21] as they remember lord what there was to
[1:21:23] celebrate about in our brother's life
[1:21:26] and how assured they can be of his
[1:21:28] resting place
[1:21:29] of his life continuing on in the sixth
[1:21:32] dimension
[1:21:33] god i pray that you would just continue
[1:21:35] to bless them and comfort them
[1:21:38] all of us who have lost a friend lord
[1:21:41] lost a member of a congregation and part
[1:21:44] of the body of christ at large
[1:21:46] god you make sure that we have no
[1:21:48] lacking
[1:21:49] for somebody else will step in lord and
[1:21:51] do the job you've ordained them to do
