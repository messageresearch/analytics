TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Some folks are building hopes down here and planning ahead. So busy with their fortunes, they forgot what Jesus said about the wars and earthquakes and the victories budding. But there's a group of people getting ready to leave. Ready to leave in the twinkling of an eye. Making investments in that bank up in the sky. Happy preparations, not a reason to grieve. Are you in that number getting ready to leave? Oh, sinner, what's the reason for your needless delay? While you're hesitating, Christ could come most any day. The spirit's calling. Make your way to Calvary and get in that number. Getting ready to leave. Ready to leave in between of an eye. Making investments in that bank up in the sky. Happy preparations. Not a reason to grieve. Are you in that number? Getting ready to leave. Oh, some folks are building hopes down here and planning ahead.

And then feel good to love the Lord and then feel the Holy Spirit bounce back and love you, too. What a blessed people we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed beyond measure. And we don't want to be like that hog sitting underneath the tree with the apples hitting him on top of the head day after day and he fails to look up and see the blessings that's fallen upon him. &gt;&gt; We want to give him the praise that he's due, the glory that he's due for he truly is worthy this morning. So just greet you in the name of the Lord and um happy to see everyone out this morning and uh just want to greet the visitors here and say God's blessings be upon you. Uh we got brother Benad from uh uh Omaha, Nebraska, his wife and two children. God bless you. And then uh pastor uh brother Ezra uh from India. God bless you too, brother. and brother Ilia his parents is here as well. So anybody else that may be visiting you your family now. So God bless you and uh God bless each one and we just want uh pastor to have a restful time and uh come back refreshed. So just pray God's blessings be upon him. Um if we can we'll just get right into the word of God this morning. I I would like to um read uh Hebrews chapter 4 and uh something I just got a little something on my heart. Trust it'll be a help to you. Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12. For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing a sunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marorrow, and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is manifest in his sight. But all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. And then I'd like to read in Revelation 1 verse 5 and and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth. unto him that loved us and washed us. And brother Brandham says that word washed means loosed. He loosed us from our sins in his own blood. And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. I'd like to speak to you this morning by the help of the Lord on Touched Part 4. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, truly we love you today and just grateful to be called by your holy name, the name that's above every name. And we want you to feel welcome here this morning, Lord. We sung songs of worship and and we want our hearts to have a melody of worship in it that's welcoming to you. We want our spirits to welcome you, Lord, here that you would have the place of honor, the seat of honor in our hearts that you could minister to our needs. For truly we are a needy people. Lord, I I am a but a mortal and I I don't know what your children need this morning. I I just know what's been ringing in my heart all week. And so I I pray that you'd just help me to deliver what I I feel you've given me. And I pray that my brothers and sisters would reach into the bread basket and and receive their portion that's for them. We just ask your blessings upon each one, Lord. And just asking for brother Chad and the family to have a time of rest and refreshment, enjoy one another's company. And pray that you just uh bring him back safely, Lord. and asking that as we as gathered here as believers this morning that you would bless and refresh us as well with your presence and that you would receive Lord uh our thoughts, our hearts, all that we are. We yield to you and ask for you to have your way and we ask all these things to be so in Jesus holy name. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. Um, so I I um I um I just um I feel that um I know maybe four parts may may seem a little long, but sometimes you just can't get away from things. And uh so I trust that uh this is the mind of the Lord. Um, but I I do believe that we we live in a a uh a hard world and and uh you know as as we read there in um in uh Revelations uh and we read in Hebrews that he's the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. But I I wanted to read to you in Revelations that um ye are kings and priests &gt;&gt; and God hath made you kings and priests. And so uh you uh you are a priest this morning. And so you are an intercessor. &gt;&gt; And so if if he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities, then I believe that we ought to have that same touch as believers. But uh something that I I I shared with you a service or two ago that uh brother Brandham said when he was talking about Christ in the first coming uh that uh Zachcharias when he was in the temple he was he was doing his godly duty. He was in the temple. Uh but when the angel Gabriel came to him, he didn't believe the word the message that was spoken to him. Even though he had he he was keeping all the eyes dotted and the tees crossed, but but when the message came directly to him, he was calloused. and and and the the the the the fearful thing is that at the first coming of the Lord, the calluses was on the priesthood and and and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and and but I I I read Revelations cuz I wanted it to take it a step further because you can see that quote and go, "Oh, brother Gabe better watch out." And you you you can read that quote and go, "Oh, brother Chad better watch out." Right? Brother Ben better be careful. But but ye are kings and priests. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so don't don't put it just on the ministry here. &gt;&gt; But you have a ministry. &gt;&gt; And and so the point is is the min that the the calluses was on the priesthood. And so that priesthood couldn't feel the touch like it was supposed to feel. &gt;&gt; And and we live in a in a in a hard world. We live in a callous time. We live in a critical time. We live in an indifferent hour. We live in a time where it's all about me, myself, and I. &gt;&gt; And and we live in a selfish, selfc centered world. That's all about me. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And and because of that, it's it's easy for us all to fall susceptible to those calluses that come upon the body. And and so I I I believe that that there's a reason why God would tell us in Ephesians the 4th chapter, grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption, cuz you can grieve him. &gt;&gt; Don't mean you lost your seal, but you can grieve him. &gt;&gt; He says, "Let all bitterness Well, wait a minute. I thought we were sealed, &gt;&gt; right? Lord, &gt;&gt; let all bitterness and wrath, wrath &gt;&gt; and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice. And be ye kind one to another, &gt;&gt; tender. Well, wait a minute, brother Gabe. I'm sealed by the Holy Spirit. Well, keep reading &gt;&gt; cuz you can grieve him. And so God is telling us that we got to be mindful of these things. &gt;&gt; We got to be tenderhearted. &gt;&gt; Don't be so too tough. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because remember, that's the hour that we live in, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Where where it's it's it's harsh. It's critical. It's cutting. And and if we ain't careful, we can lose the tenderness of our touch. Because remember when when brother Brandham was was in his, you know, the the the in 1963 when those seals were revealed and and and the the book was loosed right to him and then he gave it out to the people. To me, that was one of his greatest darkest hours because it was when it was when if you remember in standing in the gap, he said he had lost a feeling for the people &gt;&gt; because they wouldn't receive his message. And so at at at the revealing of the book of of the lamb's book uh the book of redemption when the open when the book would become opened his greatest problem was that he lost a feeling &gt;&gt; for the people because of rejection and if and if he is uh to me I believe he's a pattern for us and so when that open book is being reveed reveed to us. Could we not be susceptible to that same situation? Do you think it was a coincidence that it happened that way? I I don't think so. Because when when we have this precious word, rejection will come. And it's and it must needs be that offenses would come. &gt;&gt; But it's how do we handle them when those offenses come? see to be tenderhearted. It also tells us in the book of Colossians chapter 3, it says, now I want you to notice it tells you to put something on. How many is the elect of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Put on therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloved, boughs of mercies. Now, that boughs of mercies speaks of inward affection and tender mercies. And so, if you're the elect of God, why would God tell you to put that on? Cuz when he's saying, "Put it on," he's talking about like a jacket. &gt;&gt; Put it on. &gt;&gt; So, in other words, you don't come with it equipped. You got to put it on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay, look, you know, okay, listen. You know, people, you know, people kill me. They want to argue where the mercy seat is. It's in the bride. It's not in the bride. Don't argue. Show me where it's at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If if if the mercy seat is in your heart, &gt;&gt; well, let me see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if if if you're going to argue with me, I don't care if you got the right quote or not. &gt;&gt; I want to see mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you are a mercy, then it ought to be on display. &gt;&gt; I ought to see it in your life. I ought to see it on the job. &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Gabe, but you know, well, we got No. Well, you can only show mercy here. &gt;&gt; You can't show it out there. &gt;&gt; How are they going to receive mercy unless mercy shown? Amen. &gt;&gt; I got three or four amens on that and I got a couple all rights. &gt;&gt; See? See? See where we're at? Be because it's it's it's this harsh, cold, indifferent. I'm too busy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and when that happens, we lose our touch. &gt;&gt; Because if you're if you're a king and a priest, what is a priest? A priest is a servant. &gt;&gt; See, we want to be the bride. And it's like, no, the bride is a servant &gt;&gt; to Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? And how do we serve Christ? By serving one another. And it's not just serving us one another. Because how do you know that that that tatted up thugged out &gt;&gt; uh uh uh uh uh gangster on your job &gt;&gt; is not part of the elect lady. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you can humble yourself in such a way &gt;&gt; that you can shine light on their path &gt;&gt; that that that when it was darkness like as in Egypt, they will see a go and see light in your dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Right? When when Pharaoh's heart was was hardened, &gt;&gt; the Bible says that there was light in Gan &gt;&gt; when when it was so dark when it was so dark, so black that it could be felt. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the children go. Every time one of those plagues fell, it hardened them. &gt;&gt; Look at look at Daniel and Nebuchadnezzar's dream. It went from a gold to the to the silver and right brass and iron. Brother Brandham said, "If you watch each one of those kingdoms, those metals got harder and harder." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it came all the way down to the 10 toes and it was iron and clay. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Romanism and Protestantism. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it got harder the closer it got to that stone coming down and crushing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the hour that we live in. &gt;&gt; Iron. &gt;&gt; But we are called to be gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, brother Brennham says, "I see over here on my left a little, even some little children. You know what?" Brother Brandham sees a child children. He goes, "The scripture speaks of little children leading them in Isaiah the chimp chapter. their hearts not been pulled through so much of the world. &gt;&gt; Till they're young and tender. &gt;&gt; They love God. Listen, little ones. They love God and God loves them. &gt;&gt; And watch. And he can talk to them. We've seen so many disappointments and things. It's hard for our hearts. You know, we we live we live where I don't have my phone. Uh but that we live in in a in an hour where you could you know you if you have a news feed there's things that come across that that shouldn't &gt;&gt; and you're innocent. But remember when you look at those things you're pulling your heart through them. &gt;&gt; And what it does is it hardens you. If the prophet would say these true love stories and things, he says, he says, "And many times we pull it through old true story magazines and stuff of the world that should never have been there. It's callous." It God will take every callous off of you. You You think about because we have this phone and there's these live feeds and and everything's so interconnected. If you ain't careful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All those things become common to you and it become and it numbs you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Look, you ain't got to watch television and Netflix and whatever. You just look at the news constantly and be consumed with that. &gt;&gt; And you'll see so much death to it just becomes another number. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hollywood has so made it to where they made it now. They they way back when when I was a little boy. You remember uh Indiana Jones? Remember that? Remember that? It's okay. You ain't backslid. Go ahead. You Come on. You're like, I don't know what to do. Somebody may see me. All right, brother Brock. You go ahead, brother. Yeah. Amen, brother. Be brave, brother. Be lead the lead the charge, brother. Yeah. But you remember there's a part in Indiana Jones when Indiana, you know, you know, the music and and Indiana's running through the through the city and, you know, got the whip and and there's this uh, you know, chic tap guy. He pulls out this great big sword. Look, you already laughing. You know where I'm going. Great big old sword. He pulls out some ninja stuff and in the end it like this he just picks it up and goes bam. &gt;&gt; And you know what? Just like you just did, you laughed to death. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You laughed at death. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what the enemy does. &gt;&gt; He makes you laugh at death. And when you laugh at death, I'm I'm not condemning you cuz I laugh too. I &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you. &gt;&gt; That's how the enemy works. &gt;&gt; He just got you to laugh at death. &gt;&gt; And you know what it does? It desensitizes you. &gt;&gt; It callouses you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To where to where death doesn't matter anymore. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Just just look look just like homosexuality. What did they do way back in the 70s? They would have men dress up like women and they would make a joke out of it &gt;&gt; so that we would laugh at it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And what it did is it numbed us &gt;&gt; to where it no longer affects us. &gt;&gt; See, Satan is so slick in how he works. &gt;&gt; He's so smooth in how he works. And and and and if we ain't careful, then then we lose the tenderness. Amen. &gt;&gt; We lose the touch to where it doesn't affect us like it should to when death happen. You say, "Oh, brother Gabe, that's just a movie." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a reason why the prophet of God said, "Women don't blush anymore." &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Men Men are so callous. I want to ask you, brothers, when's the last time you hugged your child? And you say, "Brother Gabe, my I don't care." Stop using your family as an excuse. &gt;&gt; Stop using your childhood as an excuse. I got somebody really close to me. When I was just a little boy, that person told me, "Listen, I was I was abused as a child, but that does not give me an excuse to be abuse somebody else. And when I was just a little boy, that always stuck and rang in my heart because I've heard many times people say, "Well, I was abused and that's why I did it." &gt;&gt; But but when that person so close to me told me to, it was just like some it was like, "Yeah, just because of your past, your past does not predict your future." [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can use those things as an excuse &gt;&gt; and we can say, "I'm going to die die out today." Well, what about dying out to your past so it doesn't affect your present day? &gt;&gt; Listen, our our children need to feel the touch of a daddy. &gt;&gt; Our children, you you say you say, "I'm not built that way. I was abused as a child. I was molested." Whatever it may be, that does not mean you can't overcome now. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have a harder road to go, but if you don't overcome, &gt;&gt; all you're going to do is pass that hurt on to your family. &gt;&gt; It may not be in the form of that abuse, but there'll be a void in their life because of it. &gt;&gt; Because you never dealt with it, &gt;&gt; and you say you you can be an oldtimer and say, "Brother Gabe, my children is fully grown." And when you say that, it cuts me to the heart. But listen, I I'll tell you this. You know what you can do? You can pull that grown child under your arms and you can say, "I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, too many times we as parents, we think, "Well, they're my children." If if if you can't look in your rolodex of life and not see where you apologize profusely to your children, you've got too much pride in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think you're the man of the house and you're missing the mark. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. You think you're the man of the house and you're missing the mark, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because because those are not your children. Those are God's children. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the moment we take treat them as secondass citizens, we are absolutely flat dead wrong. I don't care how much of the open book you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right, friends. We can get so caught up where we think that they're not important. Listen, when I go over to that Sunday school, I fear and tremble just the same as I am right here at this pull pit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care Sunday school or no school. Anytime I handle the fire of God, I see those tender hearts and it makes my heart tremble. I don't care video camera or not, God's watching. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those hearts of those children are tender. &gt;&gt; And when we see that tenderness, it ought to make our hearts see, but our hearts become so calloused because life is rough. But we can also we can look at them with a tender heart oursel and go listen there's a better way. &gt;&gt; See we can look at our past and we let it predict our future. How how many wants a tender heart? &gt;&gt; Amen. How how many listen how many wants to feel the touch of God? &gt;&gt; We we have to be tender to his touch. And and how do we know we're tender to his touch is because we're tended to the touch of others. If if if we ain't careful, brother Brandham, he tells us, look, when when we when we are so consumed with social media that the first thing we do is we is we connect with social media before we connect with God. &gt;&gt; Something is wrong. are your priorities, my priorities is out of whack. &gt;&gt; And and and if you ain't listen because remember here here's a here's a fearful thing. A fearful thing is brother Brandham says Jesus wants to bless you. He wants the first place and we give him the last place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. You know, we sing the song preeminence. And that seems like a great big huge message word, you know, but you know what preeminence means? First place. That's all preeminence means. You little ones, don't let that word scare you. It means first place. &gt;&gt; Right? When you're in a race and you won first place, you have preeminence. &gt;&gt; You have preeminence over the race. And brother Brennham says he wants first place and we give him the last place. Oh yes, we got time for everything else. &gt;&gt; But you see him just a few minutes before you jump in bed, maybe at a night once a week and say, "Dear God, bless me and my brother and father and mother and Mr. Jones and amen." And go to bed last place. But he this is this is this is the this is I this makes me tremble. This makes me say let's close the service and let's fill the altar. &gt;&gt; Right. Like like if you don't want if you don't feel a pull to the altar, something's wrong. &gt;&gt; Unless you can honestly from the depths of your heart say, "No, brother Gabe, he's first place. Is he or is the phone first place when you get up? &gt;&gt; Is your news feed first place? Is marketplace your first place? &gt;&gt; Well, brother Gabe, I'm just checking on my I didn't ask you. it it who's first because we don't listen and if we'd be honest if any probably the best one here is he's like a close second. &gt;&gt; I mean he says he says last place but he never turns you down. He's good to you anyhow. That's what makes him real to me. &gt;&gt; See, God wants to spend time with us. When when we when we we we talk about, you know, the the uh the five love languages, then all the brothers brothers cringe, right? Then we go. Here we go. Brother Gabe getting carnal. Oh, no. No. I got quotes. I got quotes. I'm got quotes, brother. &gt;&gt; We going to be We going to keep it in the message and keep it scriptural, &gt;&gt; right? But remember, we ain't all built the same. &gt;&gt; And and you may not be naturally affectionate, but this is why you have to know your family because you may have three children and all uh you may have five and all four of them ain't affectionate, but there's one that is, &gt;&gt; right? And you have to cater to that one differently &gt;&gt; than you do the other four. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't, then there will be a void in that child's life. &gt;&gt; You brothers, look, when we provide, we get so caught up in a good home and a good job and right &gt;&gt; cuz we're naturally providers. &gt;&gt; But there's more than just providing a roof over their head. That's right. We have to provide for them physically, &gt;&gt; but we also have to provide for them mentally, &gt;&gt; in other words, we have to equip equip them because remember, they're homeschooled. So, they don't get out into the public system like the rest of the children. So, you have to you have to teach them some street smarts in the home. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. When when I was a when I was back in the day, I was probably in 20s, late 20s. I worked at a car a car dealership and there was a young kid. He got hired in and uh he was uh he was homeschooled his whole life. And I heard his story. He he uh he had a fenced in backyard and that's all he could go was in the fenced in backyard. And he was raised by like his grandma, homeschooled. And when he had turned 18, I watched him at the at the dealership just flip out because he was 18 and he had no understanding. &gt;&gt; And he and here he was totally no social skills, no no no uh street smarts, no concept of of reality. And and it was sad because he was smoking Marbell cigarettes and drinking Rockstar energy drinks and he looked like a walking billboard. And I felt sorry for him. Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Because that grandma just just smothered him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Instead of instructing you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; See, there's more to it than just protection. Cuz we can protection and shelter and smother and then when they turn 18, they have a no clue about life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We have to provide for them mentally. Amen. &gt;&gt; That means we got to talk about uh uh things that maybe make us uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; But listen, I would rather little little I got to them before Satan did or their classmates. &gt;&gt; And and you know what? Uh they they're blessing now cuz they're like, "Here he goes. [Laughter] Right. But listen, the reason why I did it is because I I knew when they was little, I wanted to break the ground then. &gt;&gt; I was breaking up the follow ground then. Cuz I knew once they turned teenage, it was already going to be difficult. &gt;&gt; But I planted seeds when they was babies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I kept watering over and over. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I heard brother I was to say the other day in preaching he was talking about that thing. You know I ain't saying it but y'all know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; He was talking about it. He said how many of of you parents uh uh you and young he said talk to your mom and dad talked to you about it and not nar one hand went up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thought my is that really surely that's not how message people are. How are how is your children going to have healthy relationships &gt;&gt; unless they have an understanding from mom and dad? &gt;&gt; Come on friends. &gt;&gt; You had to provide for them mentally, physically, spiritually. emotionally, &gt;&gt; but the physically is not a roof over the head. When when you study when you study human nature, and brother Brandham said it's one of the greatest subjects is the study of human nature. When you study how the effects of a of of of a um a a a um if you study the effects of of the hug that a mama or daddy gives to their parent to their children, it is absolutely phenomenal. When you start studying, you would think something so simple as a hug. But if you love on your children when they're early in age, there's studies that that they had looked at when they they they studied a group of of children and the mothers, how they was not affectionate, kind of affectionate, overly affectionate and and and then they they they set the markers when they were babies. They they come back to them 30 years later. And those and those and those children that had overly affectionate parents, they were vastly more grounded and settled, firm and confident, not not hostile. I mean it &gt;&gt; and you would think what? Yeah, because remember from Genesis to Revelation the whole thing was God wanted to touch. God wanted to feel. And listen, we live in a world now where everybody's on edge because they don't want to get called by the police by a mistouch, right? &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; But that can affect dad. &gt;&gt; And because of that, because we can let that fear, &gt;&gt; come on, friends. But but we ought not to let that scarecrow keep us from loving &gt;&gt; our children. And listen, Dad, if you had if if you had a a parents that weren't affectionate, you have to recognize that. And then you have to then you have to go, "Wait a minute. But how am I interacting with my children?" And you say, "Brother Gabe, but I feel funny." Well, do it anyhow. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what you need to die out too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that funny feeling, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about no weird doctrine, but what I'm telling you is the children need to feel that security. &gt;&gt; That love. Listen, you you sisters, you know why you're so insecure? If you if you trace it back, it's probably because daddy never told you you was beautiful. &gt;&gt; And listen, Dad, if you got children, if you got s, if you got daughters, you got to constantly reassure them of how beautiful they are. &gt;&gt; Not lay the law down about lint. No, you got to tell them they're beautiful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got was that one and a half amens. &gt;&gt; I I Come on, brothers. &gt;&gt; You You You got to You listen. If you don't give them love, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Hold on. Hold fast. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. We'll we'll let the prophet speak then and we'll see if you say amen to that one and see if you say amen to them. Let's see what he says and see here. Uh oh my. He says what brought a juvenile delinquency was parent delinquency. the parent failing to take care of the children. You remember a few years ago when my boy was born that had been about I think about 19 now and remember the doctor told my wife said just let that kid squall said it ain't going to hurt him and if grandma come comes along to pick him up keep her hands off of him said he ought to be career broke at 6 months now you know better than that sound like a a talk of a witch doctor instead of a real doctor &gt;&gt; and then you know what It hashed out. It hashed out a bunch of neurotics, a bunch of gangsters. &gt;&gt; Listen, God gave you that baby to love. I don't care how bad you spoil it, love it anyhow, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What did Brother Brandham have as a daddy? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A daddy that called him &gt;&gt; cuz he wouldn't take a drink. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's the love he had. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But did he pass it on to Billy Paul and Joseph and Rebecca and Sarah? No. When he's tired and wore out and and a little pit and pad of feet, what's he do? But comes up on the knee. What's he do? He said, "That's enough." &gt;&gt; No. He throws out the other knee, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He says, He says, "God gave you that baby to love. I don't care how bad you spoil. Love it anyhow." That's right. love it. If you don't love it now, it'll go up in a cold home and indifferent and it'll seek love somewhere &gt;&gt; else or something. It'll make an outlet for somewhere. It see &gt;&gt; look when I got into the when I I just be on I &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Sometimes I just hate that camera cuz I'm fairy to how people's going to interpret what I say and it makes me nervous, &gt;&gt; but but uh I don't mean that in a bad way, but &gt;&gt; uh uh so you know when I was when I was when when I was uh when I was uh little I I I I my daddy was so heavy-handed and and when I was at Mama's, it was free-for-all and I lived in this indifferent world of of of such extremes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I I always knew the message was right. But but I I wish my daddy would have told me, "Listen, son, your mama's an unbeliever, and I know that you're you got all kind of influences." And I remember one day I remember one day daddy picked me up and and I and uh I got in the back of his truck and and and uh I was he was me and him was like that, you know, and he was on the driver's side and I was on the driver's side hump of the tire of the wheel bed, the back of the bed. That's back in the day when you could ride in the back of a truck. &gt;&gt; Y'all remember that, right? That was that wasn't, you know, parent delinquency. That was just way it was back then. Yeah. Y'all remember them days? Yeah. But anyways, I'm in the back. Yeah. Dad there and he's looking at me in the mirror and I was I think Yeah. And uh I looked down and I had a KISS t-shirt on. You kissed the rock and roll heavy metal. And when I looked down and saw that I said, "Uhoh." And I looked at him and I'm like, "Oh man, I forgot to take it off." See, but I was betw twix two worlds. &gt;&gt; And I wish my daddy would have I wish he wouldn't have been cuz when I went into them alcohol and drugs and gangs and thugging and trying to be a gangster. The the reason why is because I just wanted to fit in somewhere. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I just wanted to connect with somebody. I wanted somebody to love me for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And too many times we as parents, we fail to realize our children do not come to this world born again. &gt;&gt; And you have to give them space for grace. Come on. &gt;&gt; But too many times we're trying to be the Partridge family &gt;&gt; and more we're more we're more worried about our persona amongst the believers. &gt;&gt; And so we're trying to dress up our children and we're trying to make them I'll come right down here with I ain't scared of you. I'll come right down here with you. &gt;&gt; We're we're trying to make them something that they're not. &gt;&gt; We're trying to put on some kind of art. It's like putting de uh crow uh dove feathers in a crow. trying to make them act a certain way and be a certain way. Let them live. &gt;&gt; Let them be what they are. &gt;&gt; Let them be free. &gt;&gt; Listen, when my when my children was little babies, I told them, listen, I I can't make I can't make your choice for you. All I can tell you to do is listen, just please respect my convictions of this home. &gt;&gt; And I always gave them the freedom and the liberty. I never pressed it upon them because God never pressed it upon me. He didn't take away my choice. Why would I take away theirs? &gt;&gt; Why would I take away theirs for a ministry? I don't care about a ministry. I care about them souls. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And because I was worried about that, God gave them the desire of their hearts because I didn't stuff it down their throat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise. &gt;&gt; It made it real. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It made it personal for them. &gt;&gt; Cuz it wasn't anything daddy did. &gt;&gt; Daddy can go by the way grade tomorrow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, they'll still be standing &gt;&gt; because it wasn't daddy that did anything. If anything, daddy kept apologizing for all of his nonsense. Amen. But I had enough humility to say, "I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; And some of us brothers are so proud. We think we're somebody and we are nobody. &gt;&gt; We ought to have enough humility to say, "I messed up. I should be the man of the house, and I'm not." But instead, we lack pride and arrogancy in our headship. &gt;&gt; And all we do is we hinder. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And our children don't get the touch that they need. &gt;&gt; You young brothers, hear me well. Don't hear me. Hear the Holy Spirit. Well, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; You older ones, listen. Pull them aside and say, "Listen, do you say I know, brother Gabe, I messed up." Do you know how far I sorry, I'm sorry, will go? &gt;&gt; Our children do not need to see perfect perfection. Our children need to see our mistakes and our frailties &gt;&gt; and they they need to see us rise and try again. &gt;&gt; Our children need to see us dust ourselves off and say, "I'm sorry. I messed up." &gt;&gt; That's what they need to see. When they see that, then this gospel becomes reality. It becomes reality &gt;&gt; to them &gt;&gt; because they realize, "Dad me messed up." And look at him. &gt;&gt; He's still standing. &gt;&gt; Well, then I can mess up, too. &gt;&gt; I can dust myself off. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I can keep on going. &gt;&gt; Our children need to see our frailty. &gt;&gt; Listen, brother, Dad, listen. If you've never cried in front of your family, shame on you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz how are they going to be able to cry in front of theirs? &gt;&gt; How are they going to know how to handle brokenness? &gt;&gt; How are they going to know how to handle depression? Don't put it on the ministry. I You're the priest. You We always want to be the high priest of the home when it benefits us. Oh yeah. Now let's be the high priest of the home. Now oh now we don't want to be the high priest. Now we want to put on brother Chad back in office. No no no you. No you won't be the high priest. Let's be the high priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Don't just cherry pick when you want to be high priest. &gt;&gt; Be high priest 24/7 &gt;&gt; 7 days a week. Good time and bad time. Baby blue skies and white puffy clouds. And when the lightning's flashing and the thunder's rolling, &gt;&gt; that's when you're going to be a high priest. &gt;&gt; When everything's falling apart and they look to daddy and daddy's got a tear rolling down his eyes, but then they says, "So, honey, God's going to get us through it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, that's that's what the Lord did. &gt;&gt; That's what our prophet did. Amen. &gt;&gt; That our prophet never never hid anything from us. &gt;&gt; Listen, if this is the hour of the open book, are you not the open book? &gt;&gt; Then does that mean how can you be a closed book and an open book at the same time? &gt;&gt; If you're open, if you're this you right Matthew where the books was open, right? You ma book of John that was his gospel with his interpretation what he saw Jesus. What about your book? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Right. Listen, it don't do no good for brother Brandham to to to see that revelation in a little room. And think about this. When brother Brandham was revealing those those seven seals, he got the revelation where? Behind the pull pit? No. &gt;&gt; He got the revelation where? He said, "I'll meet you in there." &gt;&gt; He got the revelation in this little room. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was going to make a terrible mistake and then that angel came &gt;&gt; and he said the mysterious part of the week has been them angels. It's not been a man, it's been the angels. &gt;&gt; So when brother Brandham got the revelation, it was separate from here. &gt;&gt; He just shared &gt;&gt; what he got in the hidden place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; But remember remember the vision when of the the third pool in the tent vision when brother Benham and that voice was talking to him. There was people going in and out of remember I'll meet you there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there was already people going in and out. So where are we going to get the revelation? Here or there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what was the revelation? It unloosed the the mystery of his life, &gt;&gt; right? By the way, the disclaimer, listen, uh there there's a family up north, brother Nathaniel's, and uh uh they they come see us, you know, uh sister Kayla, brother Juan, them and Big Poppy, and and uh uh sometimes we get to fellowship, you know, and I always get the PowerPoint out. I got to get my slides and PowerPoint at home, you know. I break out the PowerPoint, you know, and I every time I talk to sister Kayla, I said, "Kayla," I said, "Listen now, if I say anything contrary to your pastor, you set that aside and follow your pastor because he's ordained God to lead you through." She got so tired of hearing me say that, she said, "Brother Gabe, you need to make a slide for that." So, I did. I gota So listen I I just so you know anytime I bring something I start talking it makes me nervous because brother Chad I I we pretty tight but I only been here a few short times. So if I ever say anything contrary just always know my heart. If I know if I preach I would never preach anything different than what our pastor believes and preaches here. &gt;&gt; If there's something he and I disagree on I go into office. &gt;&gt; I ain't trying to You understand what I'm saying? So the integrity of my heart, I would never do that cuz that's so in discord and God hates that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. So anyway, anyway, so so uh just to me it just seems it just seems so real that that brother Brandon when he would get that revelation, it it was it unlocked a mystery in his life. He said the thing that he wondered his whole life, right? So if those people was going in and out of that room and getting healed, wouldn't it do the same for them? &gt;&gt; So it ought to do the same for us. &gt;&gt; But we have to go into that hidden place with God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and brother Brandham tells us, he says, he says it'll make an outlight somewhere. Mother, take that baby. Give it fellowship and love. Now make it a part of you, which it is, and act like it. Hug it and kiss it and love it. Don't be too cold with with things of the world. God gave you that as a treasure. Raise it right. Amen. Our children need to feel. Listen, Dad. Your boys need to feel your touch. Are y'all brothers too scared to say amen to that one? Huh? Some of the fondest memories of my life is my dad loving on me. The fondest memories of my life is him sleeping and I sleeping back to back. Him putting me to bed as a little boy and my back to his. It gave me such peace and assurance when he would give me a kiss. I knew that he loved me. And some of you brothers are so bound up that you can't do it. And that's why our children suffer. That's why you That's why there's that void when they become teenage. It's cuz you don't pour in when they're little. See, when they when my children was little, I was building. And this ain't to say I I hope this don't sound like uh look at like super dad. I'm not saying it like that. But I'm just saying we can get so caught up in life, right? We can get caught up in in our careers that we lose sight of those quality times of just being present with them. &gt;&gt; Like they don't they don't need they don't need a family devotion. They need your devotion. Right. &gt;&gt; They don't need a chapter. They need your chapter. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I know that. I know that that rubs you the wrong way, but please take it in what way I'm saying it. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about doing away from family devotions, right? But you know some of the some of the things that we can we can think about and just we can be it can become a machine. &gt;&gt; Some of the greatest quality times we've had is not with a Bible open but it's just with an open heart. &gt;&gt; It's just me opening up to them and them opening up to me. Me talking to them and them talking back. Because whenever we can just sit down and not just break out the family altar book and read our chapter and verse for the day. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz we're mechanical. &gt;&gt; We did our checklist. And and the whole point is we miss touching our family. I'm not saying this in arrogancy. I'm saying this from an honest heart. When God called me back in the ministry, I told him I'd say whatever he put on my heart. I don't care if it cost me in my ministry, I'll say it. Cuz I'm interested in seeing deliverance in the souls of God's people. &gt;&gt; I know what God has done for me. And I want the same thing to be done for you. &gt;&gt; I want these little ones to have more than what I have. &gt;&gt; I want to see them little ones step on top of me and keep on climbing. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to see. If if we when when when we learn when you look at just when you think about the touch of a of a of children and parents, you know, it it it affects you. You you young brothers, please, I said it once, but I'll say it again. And I know there's lots of you young brothers going maybe, getting ready to have babies. Baby's on the way. Always be mindful of that zero to seven, eight years old because that's the time you'll check out and you need to be checked in, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because men are naturally geared to I'll I'll take care of it when they get older. &gt;&gt; But but the building blocks is when they're babies, &gt;&gt; when you're establishing it. And you know what? That's the hardest time because that's when you got to work overtime. &gt;&gt; But that means you ain't going to get eight hours sleep. That means you're not going to get me time. &gt;&gt; You're going to get 5 hours of sleep time and you're going to get three hours of family time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the barn's going to have to wait. I got one right. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. it it listen look I want the unfailing of realities of God. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. And I don't care what it takes. &gt;&gt; I don't care how hard it is. I don't care who I got to repent to. I don't care who I got to gravel to. If I offended somebody and I got to gravel to get their forgiveness, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; That's fine. that what they require as long as they can be happy and I can try to find peace with them. &gt;&gt; You say you would do that? Yeah. Abs. &gt;&gt; God knows my heart. &gt;&gt; I've I've done it. I I've I've I've repented sometimes and I apologize one time and a brother said, "Brother, you did it wrong cuz you said I apologize." I know. That's what I said. Wow. I said, 'Well, I said, 'Well, how how do you want me to say it? I mean, I didn't say, 'Well, that's all you're going to get out of me, buddy. That's not much of an apology. See, some people you can't cuz they don't want to receive &gt;&gt; forgiveness, &gt;&gt; right? It's just judgment. &gt;&gt; But you you tell me whatever I got to do. Like brother Bam said, if I need to push a penny with my nose down the road, whatever, whatever I got to do, you tell me what I got to do. &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that, why? Cuz that prophet wanted to touch the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if and if we want to be that, I want to be when I listen to that prophet, I hear sincerity of sincerity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That man is not preaching a sermon so he can fill three hours and pump his chest and that he preached three hours. He's trying to share the burden and labor of his heart. &gt;&gt; And when I hear that, I say, "God, that's what I want." &gt;&gt; That's Lord, let me please someday, someday get there. But it's going to take it's going to take humility, brothers. Because I know there's some of you because you're so tight tonight today. Some of you need to repent and it may take more time. It may be a part five if brother Chad would grace me with another time behind a bullpit &gt;&gt; and we'll do her &gt;&gt; cuz I care about your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all I'm worried about. &gt;&gt; But we got to be honest with ourselves. And a lot of times because we have so much baggage and we've made so many mistakes, it's so much easier to just blame everybody else. But remember, you're the one, you're the man of the house. And that means you have to be accountable. And that means you have to go and say, "I was wrong &gt;&gt; and I'm sorry. What can I do to try and make it up? You know, if you come with that kind of humility, I guarantee that the Holy Spirit will honor your sincerity. &gt;&gt; You don't have to write out a big sermonet, but if the sincerity of your heart is right, God can reach down in that other heart. and restore &gt;&gt; cuz that's what he is. This is the hour of restoration. That's the hour that he works. if we'll humble ourselves. &gt;&gt; But because we have a perfect message, a lot of times we think we're supposed to be perfect and we fail to realize that it it's not. It's an imperfect people &gt;&gt; that possesses a perfect message. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; See, when when we when we when we have these hard times that come, you know, the Bible says, "For thou desireest not sacrifice, else would I give it. Thou delightest not in burnt offerings. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart. Oh God, thou will not despise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's when who wants to receive anything broken? &gt;&gt; Anybody ever get a package from Amazon broken and go, "Oh, praise God. anybody. Oh man, it's broke just like I wanted it. That's great. Yeah, no need for a return. But when you receive something broken immediately, what is it? You're right. I pick. But what does God do? What does God want? &gt;&gt; See, we we we always come to church to be put together, you know, family. You notice we all got sage green on. Right. Cuz we cuz we always want to be perfect, right? Listen, you brothers and you brothers, you probably, you know, when Susan and I first got married, I didn't have the revelation to match. And she didn't want to match and I'd be like, "No, I ain't matching you. See all these brothers, you know, families be matching." I be like, "That's cheesy." You know, I was too cool. I'm too cool. I till I have my babies. Then my babies come along and they look they, brother Gabe, they look just like you. Oh, they do. Yeah. I'm pretty cute as a 2-year-old. Right. And then as soon as they because it's your family, you want to match. Right. You young brothers, you need to humble yourselves. You'll get there, brother. You'll get there. Right. Mama. Mama match. dress your neck like, "Oh man, we got to match." You'll catch it, brother. Once them little ones come, they But you know, God sees us when we're imperfect. And when we come in our brokenness, what are the sacrifices of God? It's not burnt offerings. It was a perfect burnt offering, remember? Right. &gt;&gt; So, he they it wasn't a perfect burnt offering. burnt offerings and sacrifices. That's not what he wanted. &gt;&gt; That was just a a shadow of Christ. &gt;&gt; So, but we want to bring our per right the perfect family. Everybody matching all right cord to cut. &gt;&gt; Everybody in the right kind of blues look like we just like we getting ready to go to Olan Mills after service. [Laughter] Some of you young ones don't know nothing about no meals, do you? Have grandpa tell you later on. The olden mills in the corner, the signature, right? But that's not what God wants. &gt;&gt; God's not wanting an old mills family. &gt;&gt; God don't want us to come perfect, &gt;&gt; a perfect sacrifice, picture perfect, Facebook family. Let me get on the fishy phase now. Get them sidetracked, right? But what does God want? God desires a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart. When we bring our what God wants is our brokenness, that's what he wants to receive. It's when we can humble ourselves in our brokenness &gt;&gt; and say, "God, my family is broke." &gt;&gt; You know, brothers, it's a hard thing to say, "My family's broke." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And a lot of times, because remember, brothers, we're built to suffer in silence. &gt;&gt; That's what we do. We suffer in silence because we don't want to humble ourselves and so we kick the can down the road. But what God wants is he wants the broken family because that's why we would need a savior. See, we want to come. We want to come the day we get saved and baptized and all of a sudden, no, no, no, no. There's still brokenness in our lives. And there's broken things that we may not realize for decades, &gt;&gt; but then God will shine it to us. And then that's our opportunity to humble ourselves and say, "God, something is broken in my family, and I don't know how to fix it." But that's why we're here. If we knew how to fix it, we wouldn't have to come here. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about the ministry. I'm talking about the Holy Spirit. This is how God uses &gt;&gt; this is what God uses to minister to his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is broken menise &gt;&gt; if if we can humble ourselves. You know, Brother Brenham tells us this. He says, "3,000 years ago, a man could meet God almost anywhere. It was a common thing for a man to meet God." It's not a common thing for man to meet God. If a man talks about it, he's considered a crazy person, somebody that's lost their mind. It's so uncommon to them in the case of Abraham in his camp. Why? It was almost everyday occasion that Abraham met God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hold on. Watch what the prophet interprets the word for us. &gt;&gt; He talked to him not only but when he when he went down to Ger to sojourn, we find out down there that God was in the camp of Amalecch, a Philistine. &gt;&gt; God was in the camp of the Philistines. &gt;&gt; Yep. It was a very common thing. They lived in the camp of his presence. Today they live in their own &gt;&gt; look at this message in the camps. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You you pick you pick whatever your flavor is. There's a camp for you. &gt;&gt; If if you lean if you lean back this stiff starts you no emotion because of your childhood. There's a camp for you. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you lean fanatical and you want to shout and you got a hallelujah and there's a camp for you. &gt;&gt; If if you love the worldly music and the booglyy woogly, there's a camp for you. &gt;&gt; If you're stiff, tight, starchy, and uptight, and you don't want to move, there's a camp for you. and just search the internet, the interwebs, and there's plenty of them for you. &gt;&gt; But there's only one camp. &gt;&gt; That's the mystical body of Jesus Christ. And if Aimilec look cuz remember God came to Aimilec in a dream and he says you're just as good as a dead man. &gt;&gt; And Aimilec said, "God, you know the integrity of my heart." And God said, "That's exactly why I come to you in a dream." &gt;&gt; If if if you look at that, if you look at that in the scriptures, you know God came himself. If you type in the word, if you click on that word God, it mean Elohim came to him. &gt;&gt; Elohim came to Aimilec. He didn't send Michael. He didn't seal Gabriel. He came himself. &gt;&gt; The self-existent one came to AMC and said, "You're just as good as a dead man." &gt;&gt; And AMC said, "Yeah." &gt;&gt; And he said, "The man that lied to you &gt;&gt; and deceived you, &gt;&gt; I want you to go to him and have him pray for you." &gt;&gt; And then I'm not only going to heal you, I'm going to heal your land. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; you say that's unfair. Hey, you talk to God about it. I &gt;&gt; Hey. Hey. &gt;&gt; I'm just to be glad. I'm just thankful to be on the winning side. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's so many time There's so many times I think, God, I should have been I should have been uh &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the grace of God that we're where we're at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, so many times I go down the highway and I think how many people is just &gt;&gt; just drugged out of their mind, whizzing by me. &gt;&gt; It's the grace of God, friends, that we make it through the day. &gt;&gt; You know, life is so short. It ain't but just a vapor. &gt;&gt; One minute we're here and the next minute we're gone. &gt;&gt; What are we going to do with our next moment? &gt;&gt; Are we going to reason away what's been spoken this morning? Are we going to surrender to it and say, "God, I need help." &gt;&gt; Brother Bam tells us, he says, he says, "How about Elijah sitting up on the top of the mountain?" The Lord told him, "Get up here, Elijah. I'll stay with you. I want some f want some fellowship. Listen, I'll stay there with you. Want some fellowship? God likes to fellowship with his people. &gt;&gt; You know, you know, we talked about the love language, right? &gt;&gt; Well, as but what I what I was I try to let me just try to get to real quick what what's been on my heart been ringing in my heart cuz I've been thinking a lot about the love languages. You know, we talk about the acts of services, right? receiving gifts and words of affirmation and you know all those different things of speaking a love language to our significant others to our families and to my shame it come to my heart just started ringing in my heart echoing in my heart over and over this week what about God's love language &gt;&gt; cuz remember he'll take whatever place you give Yes. &gt;&gt; You give him fourth place, he'll take it. You think about that. The creator of heaven and earth, his creation will say, um, I only have time for you to have fifth place. And he'll go, I'll take it. &gt;&gt; The creator &gt;&gt; Yeah. takes fifth place to his creation and says, "Okay, &gt;&gt; if that's what you'll give me, I'll take it." &gt;&gt; How could we not serve a God like that? &gt;&gt; How could we not want find Go try that find that with Muhammad? Go try to find that with Allah. Go try to find that with Buddha. You think Buddha's going to take fifth place? But the only true God &gt;&gt; that created this universe &gt;&gt; when we when we in our selfishness and indifference &gt;&gt; gave it for decades gave him fifth place, sixth place, 10th place, &gt;&gt; he never turns it down. &gt;&gt; Young people, listen. You say, "Brother Gabe, I got so many things ahead of you." Listen, if all you had time was third place, don't discredit that because he took it. &gt;&gt; Just be honest with yourself and say, "God, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; I had so many other things ahead of you." And be honest with yourself and say, "God, I you you don't God, you don't have the preeminence in my life. I have enough sliced time sliced out for Wednesdays and Sundays to put on my tie and my shirt and my church clothes and shake the hands. Anybody? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be honest enough and say, "God, I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; Because Satan will say, "No, you you gave him. He don't want fifth place." No. the God that you serve, he took your fifth fifth place. &gt;&gt; And he said, "If that's all you can give me, I'll take it." See, if you look at God like that, because remember, sister, if you have if you had a daddy that never loved you, never showed you the the the affection and the love that you that you needed, and so you're always uh uh uh insecure about your looks, and you're always worried about this looks and my hair and this and well, listen, there's probably a pretty good chance the reason why you are that way is because daddy never gave you the reassurance. insurance that you needed as a baby. I remember when my children was little, a sister told me, I won't say her name, she's here in Lima, and she told me, she said, "Every time my daddy would tell me I was beautiful or he loved me, I I just" and when she told me, she was just radiant. And when she said that, I took that and I put it in my front pocket &gt;&gt; because I realized sisters need that reassurance. They need it. And brothers, if your wife is so worried about that and she spends two hours in the bathroom and you think, &gt;&gt; stop because it may be deeper than what you think. So you got to look deeper sometimes and stop being so crit superficially critical. But in order to do that, you got to be able to touch your wife and go to the heart and realize why does she tick the way that she ticks. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And when you understand why she ticks the way that she ticks, then you got to tick according to that tick to counteract that tick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To make it start ticking the right kind of way, &gt;&gt; right? And it's going to take a lot of your ticks &gt;&gt; to change her tick &gt;&gt; to put her tick in the right tick so you can tick with her tick. &gt;&gt; And then you be tick- tocking together. And I'm not talking about the internet. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But it but it's going to take us understanding one another of why they are built the way that they are built. And sister, if you have those insecurities, then you got to understand, wait a minute, it's deeper. You are not superficial. &gt;&gt; You are a wounded spirit. &gt;&gt; You thought you was being carnal and and all about your looks and you're being vain. No. No. You're a broken little girl on the inside. &gt;&gt; Y'all you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, &gt;&gt; you got to look at those things and go, you but G, I don't I know you don't want to and that's fine. Then somebody's going to come around and preach the same exact same thing cuz eventually you're going to have to look at it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God wants you perfectly whole. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And sometimes in order to get perfectly whole, we got to get our hands dirty, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to we got to get to the heart of the matter of why we are beating the way that we are beating. Why we are responding? Why are we overreacting? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If we're always overreacting, there's something wrong. And it's not that situation that's making you overreact. &gt;&gt; If you would search it, it's something deeper. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's this thing down here that's buried that you have not want to pay attention to. That's the thing that needs to be addressed. And if you address that thing right there, then the overreaction will start to fade away. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking. You know, I'll tell you. You know, I I'll tell you this. These little ones. Go ahead. Go ahead. Try to try. Let me see you flex on one of them. See what happens. I got to be very careful. I got to be very careful because I have such a heart for children. But the reason, one of the reasons why I have such a heart for children is because my innocence was taken from me for such an early age. And because of that, because I had the things uh uh uh I didn't have that proper childhood, when I see these little ones and that innocence, there's there's a little 8-year-old boy that raises up and go, "Wait a minute, now he's a 350 lb 51y old boy and now he can do something about it." &gt;&gt; And because of that, I can overreact. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; But see, I know my frailty. M &gt;&gt; I've dealt with it. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; It's still there. &gt;&gt; Remember, brother Bram talked about uh when he had the nervous tension, remember he saw it the Lord and brother and God said, "It won't bother you no more." And brother Bram says, "I know it's there, but it don't bother me anymore." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He could have just as good to take it away, but he didn't. He says, "So so now I know it's there, but I just walk with it. Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; See, sometimes, friends, we're wanting this spotless personality that's going to be perfection. we're going to be like a sevenfooter and no, if it's it's our brokenness, but it's when we see our frailties and I can see that little 8-year-old boy raised up when there's some children or something happens that you know uh a couple uh couple weeks ago, Mina, she Mina is a volunteer in at the at the horse farm with these uh she works with the uh handicapped children and and one of the handicapped children uh grabbed her glasses and threw it down and and then uh uh they didn't want to tell dad about that one. I thought her hands were pretty good. They was like, "Um, Dad, um dad said, "Don't be touching my children now." Yeah, man. Polar bear come out real quick. But I handle it like a professional. I said, &gt;&gt; "Praise the Lord, brother. Exactly right." I said, "Hallelujah. God still moves in the heart of his people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; See, because I know it's there, &gt;&gt; but you have to understand your frailty. And you have to be okay with who you are as a broken individual. &gt;&gt; And I can share it openly because I know God gave me the ability to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? The message done something for me, friends. I have an understanding of of the that's why I love studying human nature and how human beings think. It's more than a quote to me of what brother Brandham said. I'm glad he said it because to me when I hear that message that's what rings true cuz I want to understand why I tick the way that I tick. Why am I the way that I am? Right? Don't you want to do that? I I I love this message. I to me something about it, brother. It's it's gave me freedom. It's given me liberty. And I I I just I love it. Let me can we just try to close on this? So, so when we think about this love language, you know, it what does God want? You know, so many times we look at God as how he's going to serve us, &gt;&gt; but God has love languages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He, you know, he wants to spend quality time. Brother Brham says it's like he's become an impersonal God. No, no, no. He wants to spend time. He wants to fellowship with you. Brother Brandham says, he says, "God likes to fellowship with his people, but we won't stand still long enough for him to fellowship with. &gt;&gt; So it's not him." &gt;&gt; It's us. &gt;&gt; He says, "We're so busy skipping about from place to place and so much." He says, "Sit still, Elijah. I wanted three years and six months of fellowship." We can't have in three minutes hardly. Three years and 6 months of constant fellowship. Oh, I love that. Don't worry about the cooking. We'll have that already fixed up. The crows is going to feed you and everything is going to be all right. I just want some fellowship. Again, brother Brandham says God loves to fellowship with his creature. And he goes on, it was in God in it when when Adam and Eve fell, he did not come down with a rod of judgment, but he came searching Adam. Adam, where art thou? You know, he also wants quality time. He wants to spend time with us. Brother Brandham says prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you're in the presence of God and you're moving in the deep depth of deepest of sincerity. Watch what he says. First you say a little worship. Now watch what's he what's remember Lord teach us how to pray &gt;&gt; and so listen brother Brandham picks that up and he goes first you say a little words of affirmation &gt;&gt; oh the almighty Lord Jehovah the self-existent one &gt;&gt; you are the creator. &gt;&gt; You are the almighty. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? You're bragging on him. [Applause] &gt;&gt; See, that's what prayer is. First, you say a little worship. What are you doing? You're speaking his love language. Like, like you sisters, what do you do? What do you do whenever, like brother Bram said, just a few pats? Brother Bram said, just a few pats. He It says the same thing, friends. Watch. Brother Bam says, he says, uh, God gave a man a wife to comfort him, to touch him. And anybody knows that a good wife, there's bound to be a good wife. A man could be upset in his business and walk of life and can come home no matter what. Doctor, it's that way with me. When I come overseas somewhere, I'm nervous, upset, lost sleep. I hear crying. I see little hungry children on the street crying going on. It just kills me. But then when I come home, if wife will sit down on the arm of the chair, look, physical touch and put her arm around me and just say words of affirmation. Oh, Bill, I understand it, you know, and just a few little pets from the wife means so much. The same thing a husband to a wife, that's the way God wanted it to be. Look what he also said. He says he says it it's it is a sweet uh man's life is sweeter than than to come home and he's tired and wearing a little bucket in his hand for work all day plowing or whatever it may be and walking home. Have a lovely wife to meet him at the door. Sit down on his lap a minute. Brush his brow a little. Kiss him on the cheek. Put her arm around him. Say, "Dear, I know you're tired. You've worked so hard." and give him consolation and that he knows that that arm is around him is absolutely his. &gt;&gt; That arm ain't been around another man. &gt;&gt; Never is it around any other man or any other desire. And the kiss that's on his cheek is a from a real pure heart that he just loves him alone. It makes him I know makes him you stick your chest out and say, "Well, I'm not so tired after all. See, that's it. It does something to you. &gt;&gt; See, just a few pat sis. But, brother, you got to It's It's all give and take. Or are we going to just feel the coldness of Lady Osia? Are we going to feel the iron from that Roman toe? Are we going to feel the coldness of Lady Osia? Are we going to have a heart that's tender? I'm not I'm Listen, don't I'm not talking about skinny jeans and a little silly vest tied on tight. I'm not I'm not talking about that. I'm I'm talking about masculine. But masculine is not no feeling. Our children need to feel true love. &gt;&gt; How does a child feel? You know, you know when when a child from zero to 5 like 90% of its brain is is totally formed as like about 5 years old. And there's things that are set in that child that will be there its whole life. And if you don't pour in, then you're going to miss the opportunity. You say, "Brother Gabe, I'm not built that way." Well, well, can we can we die out to oursel today, &gt;&gt; brother? Do you mean more to you &gt;&gt; or does your family mean more to you? See, we look at dying out to oursel as overcoming some kind of addiction or whatever, but this is what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about dying out to your childhood. Break the cycle. So, so you grew up in a cold, indifferent family. Are you going to use that as an excuse? Are you going to take what the prophet says? Are you going to take what the word says? Are you going to be tenderhearted and go, "Wait a minute, that applies to even burly men." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That applies to every one of you. &gt;&gt; Because you say, "Well, I got all boys." Oh, well, okay. Well, listen. What happens when all your boys have all girls? You see, &gt;&gt; then you didn't impart to your boys. And then you're going to see your boys like the little ones is going to be like hugging a wall and dad's going to go here. And then you are going to look and you're gonna go, I missed it. I missed it. And and maybe you did. Maybe you messed up. But I would encourage you, Dad. I'd encourage you to go back to your children one by one, one by one, and say, "I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; You know, the message I heard today, it convicted me. &gt;&gt; And if you from your heart say, "I didn't touch you in the right way. I was too aggressive with you." You know, I've apologized to my children so many times. So many times I they they they kind of smile like here he goes. But I do it anyways cuz on that day I don't want no problems when I get there. &gt;&gt; I want to say I'm sorry. I messed up. Dads are supposed to be this way and I was this way. God's word says this and I acted this way in front of you and I'm sorry and and if we as brothers as as dads and husbands if we don't go to if we don't have that kind of humility to be able to go to our families what good is the gospel? You tell me. Or we can apologize to our coworker. Well, that's because our job. We can apologize to the brother in the church. Well, that's because he's related to that family. But what about our children? What about the disappointments? What about the disappointment that we've been to them? Are we going to have the humility and say, "God, uh, I'm sorry, Lord. Help me. Help me, God, to try to make amends. Could we stand together? And I know I know this was maybe a little different service, totally different than what I thought, but I trust that something was said to be a help to you. But brother Brandham says he says like Abraham and Sarah had been married for many years. musicians if you had come. She was infertile and she couldn't raise a child and it looked like then he would have got some young woman that was fertile that could have brought forth this child. But God likes to display his grace. God likes to take something that isn't nothing and make something out of it. For he's creator. That's why he took you and I. We were nothing that he might make his children out of us out of his own out of us who were wretched and miserable, lost and blind and unloly to make us his lovely children. It's God's purpose to do so. In all of our mistakes, in all of our loneliness, mind and spirit, you play something maybe quiet me. In all of our loneliness, [Music] I put that diamond there for a purpose. Cuz you know, sometimes we go through life and we just think we're a lump of coal and no value to us. And you know the only difference between those, they got the same makeup. [Music] One just was elected. One was predetermined. that when the pressures and strains of life, all of that coal, that coal, right, that piece of coal that's right beside that diamond was under the same pressure. Wasn't like it was a piece of coal 5 miles away and one over here. And but however that happened, there was a predestinated, predetermined moment where that diamond, that lump of coal would have transforming power and it would spark And the fire would ignite in that lump of coal and it'd be transformed into a diamond. And you know that diamond can dance and shout and run the aisles and say, "I'm a diamond. I'm no longer a lump of coal." But you know what? There's still more work to be done. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's fire inside that diamond that needs to be unlocked. But you know what happens? It's going to take a wise master builder, &gt;&gt; the chief jeweler, &gt;&gt; to look at that diamond and flip it this way and flip it that way and go, you know what? I see this particular. It needs to be cut here and honed here and because it can look inside and see the fire inside that needs unlocked. Amen. But it's got to be honed and chiseled and sliced and diced. And it may be this big, but there's a whole lot of imperfections that that jeweler looks at and sees and goes, "Nope, that's got to go." &gt;&gt; And that great big diamond can end up being a little itty bitty teensy thing. But the reason why is because it was just that little itty bitty teensy piece that was perfection of perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so all of the they call them inclusions. All of you sisters know what I mean like amen. Right. All them inclusions had to because you want that perfect diamond. You want that fire to sparkle when he puts it on the hand. [Music] See, everything's got to be cut off. And I hope I hope you let the Lord cut some things off for you this morning because God's got a purpose in it. He He's He's not here to destroy us. He's here to love us. He's here to nurture us and make us his own. If we'll get on the potter's wheel, if we'll listen to his voice and hear his touch, can we do it this morning? Brother Brandham says, he says, "Listen, brother, you're never saved by any sign. You're never saved by any sensation. You are saved when you met God's condition of his word. And nothing else are you saved by." You say, "Brother Gabe, I the way you're saying is cutting me and I don't feel saved. Praise God. &gt;&gt; It's not by feelings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, you say, "Brother Gabe, you preaching on touch and feel." That's exactly right. But I'm not talking about this. I'm talking about those tenderhearted, inward yearning boughs of mercy because your feelings is going to you'll have you'll be on a mountaintop one day and a valley the next. And brother Benham tells us, he says, "You're saved because you met God's conditions." He says, "That's right. God's word is made a way. You're not saved because you feel like you're saved. I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved. Cuz a lot of times I don't feel that way." &gt;&gt; Malachi 4. Yeah. And you young ones need to understand that cuz there's going to be valleys. There's going to be pitfalls. There's going to be backslidings. There's going to be downsittings. There's going to be uprisings. But through it all, you have to rest in the fact that you met God's requirements. You felt the prick of your heart. You heeded to it. You was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin. and you received the gift of the Holy Ghost cuz the promise was unto you &gt;&gt; and you accepted it and you said, "Amen. That's mine." &gt;&gt; And that puts you in the battle. &gt;&gt; That puts you on the forefront where every devil in hell, the devils ain't hanging out in the barrooms. They're sitting right outside those doors. They're trying to walk the aisles trying to get you to entertain a thought. All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "But I'm saved because God gave up the promise and I met God's conditions and upon God's holy word, I can defeat Satan seven days in a week and as many nights cuz it's God's word." Brother, sister, I don't say these things to be a smart alec. I say these things cuz I love you. I say these things cuz I want the unfailing realities in my life. There's something in this word that there there's something in this word that is that has touched my life in a way that I could never touch myself. [Music] And I want so bad to to see the joy of the Lord on each and every one of your faces. [Music] I don't want to see you downtrodden. I don't want to have to go down there and squeeze a amen out of you. I want that amen to come freely. &gt;&gt; I want you to say amen. Not because I said come on, please. I want you to say amen. Cuz you got the victory. &gt;&gt; Cuz the king is in the camp. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you're not Aimilec, but you're Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're seed of Abraham. And you're walking like you are seed of Abraham. Look, if you made wrongs, make them right. Get it under the blood. Humble yourself and watch God transform in ways that you never expected. Listen, young person, you struggling with lust. You know, you know, you know what? You know what Satan does? Satan will keep you bound because you won't confess it. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, husband, you struggling with lust. Go to your wife and confess it and see what happens. I promise you. I'm telling you, that's what I did. I had to humble myself. I had to humble myself and say, "Babe, I got a problem." And when I did, it unlocked something in me. Cuz Satan will make you shamed, and it'll make you hide under it. And you'll just be a Pharisee. You just be a Pharisee, a stuffed shirt, put on artificial put on. When in reality, all you got to do is humble yourself &gt;&gt; cuz he's faithful and just to forgive. if you'll confess. Right? Remember remember that sister? She said, "I I didn't do I didn't do no wrong." He said, "Listen," she said, "I confessed that to God." Brother Bram said, "You didn't sin against God. You sinned against your husband." &gt;&gt; And so, she had to go back. And when she went back to her husband and confessed, it unlocked something in both of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, it's when we struggle with something and we're so ashamed because we've been in this thing 30, 40, 50, 60 years. How? Put whatever name on it you want, whatever number. &gt;&gt; And we think we ought to be farther along down the road than what we really are. And what it is is we got too much pride. &gt;&gt; We don't want to humble ourselves and say, "I'm a failure." But that's exactly remember cuz the sacrifices of God or a broken and contrite heart, a spirit. It's when we can humble ourselves and say, "God," go to our family, go to our wife and say, "Listen, I messed up. I'm wrong. I betrayed you. I betrayed this gospel and I'm so sorry, brother. When you do that, the Holy Spirit steps in because that's remember he's a gentleman. He can only go so far because part of it lays in you. And we can blame everybody in the congregation, in a home, and parent. We listen, don't blame mom and dad. You're a grown man now. You got to put up. You got to put up. But if you if I'm telling you when you confess it brings liberty. It brings freedom. When we do something wrong or we wrong somebody. What what's in our mind? If I go I can't go tell he's going to do it. I can't go do it. But then when I humble myself and like look brother Sam I'm sorry. He's like brother Sam's like oh yeah brother Gabe no problem. I'm like, "Oh, okay. Thank you." Because in my mind, because what did Satan do? He worked something up and he made he made something that really wasn't there. &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing whenever we wrong somebody or we do. You break Listen, brothers. I'm telling you, listen. There's too many souls here. Lust is rampant in Lady Oia. And what Satan does is it keeps people bound because they won't confess. But if you confess, it'll lock something in you. It'll give you freedom and liberty like you never had because the Satan will have no place to hold you. Because whom he whom God has set free is free indeed. You That's why you're so bound up. You watch somebody that's bound up with lust and pornography and things, the first thing they do is they draw away and they isolate themselves. You know why? Cuz they don't want to touch. Because of shame, they draw away themselves and they say, "I'm I'm a failure. I'm miserable." But if you'll just just heed my words, it's not my words, it's God's words. If you'll confess he's faithful and just to forgive. And that forgiveness unlocks liberty, it unlocks freedom. And I'd encourage you this morning, friends, cuz brother Brandham says it'll defeat Satan anywhere. Seven days a week and as many nights. I don't want six days and nights and of victory. &gt;&gt; I want seven, &gt;&gt; right? How many want seven days and seven nights of victory? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. And as we bow our heads, [Music] I'd encourage you, friend, my brother, my sister, if the waters is troubled like it was that day at the pool of Bethesda. And that man missed his opportunity. But you know there would come a time when a savior, a lonely man would walk through all those hundreds, maybe thousands of people cuz that man would have a predestinated moment that he'd hear from the master. And I'd encourage you this morning, brother, sister, if your waters has been troubled, would you maybe raise a hand, kneel at your seat, come to the altar? I I I don't I don't know what your need is. Is there a need to go to the al altar? Absolutely not. You God will meet you right there. That's that's just old Methodist tradition. But maybe you need to humble yourself and come to the altar. Maybe it's more than just the Methodist tradition. To you, it's something you got to do publicly. I don't know. Maybe you got to surrender at your seat and just say, "God, I whatever it is, I however the Holy Spirit is dealing with your heart, just don't push him away." when the Lord is talking to you, not brother Gab's voice, but that voice that's talking to you in your heart right now, that instance or that situation that's coming back over your mind. And that's the thing you need to deal with. It's not what Brother Gabe's saying, but it's what the Holy Spirit, it's it's that still small voice on the inside of you. Brother, sister, would you surrender to it today? In the quietness of this moment, would you would you just raise a hand? Would you bow your heart before him and say, "God, I I'm truly in need of you. [Music] Dad, could you humble yourself? Maybe grab your wife's hands and give it an extra squeeze and maybe squeezing in that Morris code of I love you. [Music] Sister dear, could you squeeze his hand and squeeze it two times and say, "I love you." [Music] Whatever your love language is, could you could you just talk to one another? And above all, could you talk to him? Let's each one talk to him. Heavenly Father, truly we are grateful. Well Lord, we were weward ones one day, lost and indifferent and undone. But you came by our way, Lord. [Music] You took us from amongst the sheep coat and you gave us a name like great men. And we're so thankful to be called by your holy name. Lord, in a world that's so indifferent and cold and dark, help us each one, each soul here to be a beacon of light. [Music] Lord, we want to be shining when you return. When you come back, you'll be looking for faith and we want it to be right here. [Music] I pray in Jesus name, Lord, for my brothers and sisters, the needs that's upon them, the cry of their heart. Lord, would you bring deliverance as only you can? Lord, would you restore men broken hearts, men broken lives? God, help us each one, Lord, to look past this world and help us yield our lives to you so that we could be your hands, that we could be your feet, that we could be your voice, that we could be that cry in the midnight hour, [Music] that Lord, that we would make time for you, that we As we are mindful of our love language to our family, might we be mindful of our love language to you? Giving you words of affirmation, Lord. Giving our gifts to you. Acts of service, Lord, that when we do something, no matter what it is, we do it as unto the Lord, even to the littlest of things. [Music] Lord that we as the scripture says kiss the son. Might we give you a kiss. You're the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. Help us go to those places where we share our infirmities with thee so that you may be touched. God, help us each one to get out of of our comfort zone [Music] and be your hands, be your eyes, be your ears, and above all be your heart. Lord, help us each one to be tenderhearted, tender to your touch, like we could be like the disciples of old, that the least little nod, we'd know what you wanted and we'd do exactly what you wanted. Let us be that sensitive, that sincere. That's my prayer for each one. We love you and we praise you. We commit all these things into your hands and we ask these things to be so in Jesus lovely name. Amen. Let's sing it together. Quiet and me. Let peaceful waterers flow. Anybody need prayer? Learn to be still, oh my soul. and let me my Jesus drawing near. [Music] Oh touch me Lord and quiet me.
