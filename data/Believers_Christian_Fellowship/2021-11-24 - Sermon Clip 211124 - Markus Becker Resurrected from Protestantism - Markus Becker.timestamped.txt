[0:00] the brothers of joseph
[0:03] when they met joseph and joseph was
[0:05] revealing himself to them
[0:08] they came to their father
[0:11] his father did not know that he was
[0:13] living
[0:14] so his father took the garment as a
[0:17] little
[0:18] relict
[0:20] from joseph with the blood
[0:22] and the father said no he's dead i have
[0:25] his blood
[0:27] i have his i have his his garment which
[0:29] is bloody the brother said forget about
[0:32] the bloody garment he's here
[0:35] father said oh no i have his blood and
[0:37] whatever what he did two thousand years
[0:39] that's true but the brother that's fine
[0:41] but he is here the changing of
[0:43] dispensation
[0:45] amen
[0:46] so
[0:47] real teaching is more than just i
[0:49] understand or i'm better real teaching
[0:52] changes our vision
[0:56] and there's good people in the state to
[0:57] be good people but as long as they don't
[0:59] understand what happened on sunset
[1:01] mountain there will be still mourning we
[1:03] don't have and we wish brother branham
[1:05] would come back we wish that god would
[1:07] do something and we wish to do and we
[1:09] don't have we are blind we are miserable
[1:11] we are loud he's here and no wonder and
[1:13] we we have covered we have all these
[1:15] things and the other group said hey he's
[1:17] here
[1:18] amen they had this back to the church
[1:21] i mean he's taking care he's in control
[1:24] yeah but what about your cove and
[1:26] whatever what cove god allowed all those
[1:28] things if it comes from a laboratory or
[1:31] it comes from an m no matter my father
[1:33] allowed it so it's here
[1:35] can you say amen
[1:36] so both people are good mary and marta
[1:38] are good people but one sees it the
[1:40] other one needs a little bit more time
[1:44] she will come
[1:46] but
[1:47] yet she is still in her now remember
[1:49] this
[1:51] god has his individual ways with us
[1:55] so when jesus came back
[1:57] uh and he was meeting his brothers his
[1:59] disciple on that on on that ship
[2:02] there was a certain time that only john
[2:05] knew who was standing there
[2:08] everybody else at this is a ghost and
[2:10] he's a stranger and he calls for didn't
[2:13] you didn't you didn't you fish anything
[2:15] and one said what what a strange person
[2:18] is this and john said the bible says the
[2:20] one who loved him
[2:22] recognized him
[2:24] john was for some time the only one in
[2:27] the boat who said this is him
[2:30] i see him the other said i see him
[2:33] and brother raymond said the more you
[2:35] love him
[2:36] the more he will reveal himself to you
[2:39] it's a question of love not of
[2:41] understanding
