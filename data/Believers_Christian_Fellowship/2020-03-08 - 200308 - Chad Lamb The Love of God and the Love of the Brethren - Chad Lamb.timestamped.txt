[11:12] we had known about it a few days ago and
[11:15] i thank god for his grace his abundant
[11:18] grace and i thank god he gives us
[11:19] examples to look to
[11:21] a man of what grace can do man let's
[11:24] read this scripture here in matthew 22
[11:27] let's start at verse 34.
[11:34] but when the pharisees had heard that he
[11:36] had put the sadducees to silence
[11:38] they were gathered together then one of
[11:40] them which was a lawyer asked him a
[11:42] question tempting him and saying master
[11:44] which is the great commandment in the
[11:47] law
[11:48] jesus said unto him thou shalt love the
[11:50] lord thy god with all thy heart
[11:52] with all thy soul with all thy mind this
[11:55] is the first and great commandment
[11:58] and the second is like unto like unto it
[12:00] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[12:02] on these two commandments hang all the
[12:04] law and the prophets
[12:07] let's just bow our heads and pray their
[12:09] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[12:11] your word
[12:12] we pray god now as we could just yield
[12:14] ourselves into your hand
[12:16] we're asking lord that you would come
[12:17] down and do what man
[12:19] can't do lord that you would come down
[12:21] and take over an earthen vessel and
[12:23] human lips
[12:25] but you yourself by the power of your
[12:26] holy spirit would speak eternal words
[12:29] lord that would go into the hearts of
[12:30] your people lord
[12:32] that you would bring out fruit lord
[12:34] that's there that you would bring us
[12:35] into a greater manifestation of your
[12:37] life
[12:38] in this hour lord we pray you have
[12:39] preeminence among us
[12:41] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[12:44] you know i'll be seated for he's gone
[12:49] amen i just wanted to thank those who
[12:51] were able to make it out the last two

[14:10] but brother john is going to take that
[14:12] service for us so we look forward to
[14:14] that say god bless you
[14:17] i also want to say i enjoyed the song
[14:18] special this morning it really touched
[14:20] me
[14:21] it's where god is leading me when things
[14:23] like that happen
[14:24] and you see the continuity it just is a
[14:26] blessing to me
[14:28] and so i appreciate it god's been
[14:30] dealing with me heavy in those things
[14:32] and so i want to share some of those
[14:33] things today i want to
[14:35] if i take a title i'd like to take a
[14:37] title of the love of god
[14:39] and the love of the brethren the love of
[14:41] god
[14:42] and the love of the brethren and we know
[14:45] that love is the capstone
[14:47] we've we've you know worked your way
[14:49] through the church ages and
[14:50] into the statue of a perfect man but
[14:52] when it comes time to cap it all off
[14:54] it's divine love it's this charity
[14:57] it's love and it's love in such a
[14:59] different way than we consider love
[15:02] that sometimes when we start to talk
[15:04] about it because it's been so
[15:05] misused the term love and even in
[15:08] christian circles it's been so abused
[15:11] that it's almost always referred to in
[15:13] the emotional way
[15:15] like love that feels good and i have a
[15:17] tingling sensation and there's a
[15:18] sweetness in my heart
[15:20] amen those are the effects of love amen
[15:23] but
[15:23] love this kind of love is not based on
[15:25] emotion
[15:27] it's not because this love doesn't
[15:29] change with the emotions
[15:31] and so it's a different kind of love
[15:33] this capstone love and
[15:34] when we go to start talking about it i
[15:36] know for a while just because the way
[15:38] it's been presented in the past
[15:40] through a denominational way and in my
[15:42] upbringing and even before years in the
[15:43] message
[15:44] the way it was presented it would i
[15:46] would kind of recoil from talking about
[15:48] love
[15:48] because it almost was this kind of sappy
[15:51] sweet
[15:52] you know you have to be i don't know
[15:55] just
[15:55] some old doting grandpa to have this
[15:57] kind of love but that's not this kind of
[15:59] love
[16:00] this love can be firm this love can be
[16:02] hard this love can be honest
[16:04] but this love is also a reconciling love
[16:06] it's also
[16:07] a brotherly it's it's a it's even higher
[16:10] than brotherly love but it's the love
[16:11] that
[16:12] gives us strength for brotherly love so
[16:15] so
[16:15] when we talk about this i want to look
[16:17] at two aspects of this same love
[16:19] the love of god and the love of the
[16:21] brethren and if we can go back and look
[16:23] at this scripture again together
[16:26] i want to draw something out of this and
[16:28] let's skip down to verse
[16:31] 36 matthew 22 and
[16:35] master which is the great commandment in
[16:37] the law
[16:38] so they asked him what was the great
[16:40] commandment so they wanted to know one
[16:43] thing
[16:44] but jesus told them two things because
[16:47] jesus not just answered their question
[16:49] but he used the question as an
[16:51] open door to teach a greater lesson
[16:53] because they just wanted to know the
[16:55] great commandment but jesus wanted them
[16:56] to know something else
[16:58] so this is important he said master
[17:01] which is the great commandment in the
[17:02] law
[17:03] jesus said unto them thou shalt love the
[17:05] lord thy god with all thy heart
[17:07] with all thy soul with all thy mind this
[17:10] is the first
[17:11] and great commandment so praise god we
[17:14] know what the great commandment
[17:16] of the word is is to love the lord
[17:19] to love the lord thy god with all thy
[17:22] heart with
[17:23] all thy soul with all thy mind
[17:26] this is the first and great commandment
[17:28] and the second is like unto it this is
[17:30] where he's adding a bonus to their
[17:32] question
[17:34] this is so it's super important when we
[17:36] recognize jesus is doing this
[17:38] it means this is really really important
[17:40] he's not just answering their question
[17:42] but there's something else he wants them
[17:43] to get
[17:45] and he says the second is like unto it
[17:48] so it's it's like the first one
[17:52] and the second is like unto it thou
[17:53] shalt love thy neighbor
[17:55] as thyself
[17:58] on these two commandments hang all the
[18:01] law
[18:01] and the prophets so
[18:04] the entire old testament all the law all
[18:08] the prophets are hanging on two
[18:09] commandments
[18:10] one is the love the lord thy god with
[18:12] all thy heart i'm going to read it
[18:14] because i'll get it wrong
[18:15] all thy heart with all my soul with all
[18:17] thy mind and the second
[18:19] is like to it love thy neighbor as
[18:22] thy self
[18:25] wow that's a lot harder than it sounds
[18:28] at first like that can be a memory verse
[18:30] you learned in sunday school
[18:31] but when it comes to life application
[18:33] and living that out
[18:34] that is much more difficult than it
[18:36] sounds at first
[18:37] because you have to love your neighbor
[18:39] neighbor as yourself
[18:43] praise god so that means you don't do
[18:44] anything to your neighbor you wouldn't
[18:45] do to yourself
[18:47] you don't think any foster your neighbor
[18:49] you know until you would do for yourself
[18:51] or the way you want them to do for you
[18:54] let's i'm just going to refer
[18:57] to the law i want you to stay here in
[18:58] the new testament because we're going to
[18:59] go to the book of mark
[19:00] but that this is taken out of the
[19:02] scriptures in leviticus 19 out of the
[19:04] law
[19:05] leviticus 19 18 says thou shalt not
[19:08] avenge nor bear any grudge
[19:10] against the children of thy people but
[19:12] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[19:14] i am the lord. so that's where this is
[19:17] drawn from
[19:18] but but it's amazing that the language
[19:20] he's using thou shalt not avenge
[19:22] nor bear any grudge against the children
[19:24] of thy people
[19:26] and and you know let's let's just make
[19:28] this personal to us
[19:29] amen sometimes there's people that hurt
[19:32] us in our families and in churches and
[19:34] and all around amen and they're the
[19:36] people of god
[19:38] and it says do not avenge when we say
[19:40] well i would never avenge
[19:42] or hold a grudge
[19:46] [Applause]
[19:47] so this i mean to me the scripture is
[19:50] getting
[19:51] so tight on me now lately it's the way i
[19:54] look at the word
[19:55] the word is really it used to be that
[19:58] the word was so exciting that i could
[20:00] understand the word
[20:01] like it was so exciting like i see the
[20:03] truth i understand that doctrine i see
[20:06] serpent seed i when i see the oneness i
[20:08] really see it
[20:09] i see it and i understand it and there's
[20:12] something resonates in my heart and that
[20:13] was the exciting part of the word
[20:15] and we've been in that cycle me myself
[20:17] i've been in that cycle for a while
[20:19] where it's growing
[20:20] and growing in revelation and the
[20:21] revelations are so thrilling to my heart
[20:24] but then all of a sudden comes the life
[20:26] application of the word
[20:28] because god does not want theologians
[20:32] the message didn't come to make
[20:33] theologians god's not
[20:35] after our theology amen he wants a life
[20:39] so revelation should bring a life there
[20:42] should be a life that comes
[20:43] with the revelation of the word and it's
[20:45] so exciting
[20:47] amen and that's why you know this has
[20:49] been on my heart for a while
[20:50] and when brother aaron comes and
[20:51] preaches what he did i felt like this is
[20:53] just a continuation of that same thought
[20:55] that that that it's just god is looking
[20:58] for
[20:59] a manifestation of the word not just a
[21:02] knowledge of the word
[21:04] but we have to have a knowledge of the
[21:05] word and we want to know it
[21:07] and we enjoy knowing it and we enjoy
[21:09] revelation
[21:10] but revelation must translate into the
[21:13] literal life of jesus christ
[21:15] in a body and that we've come to the
[21:19] hour where it's no longer acceptable not
[21:21] to have the manifestation
[21:23] it's no longer acceptable to have a
[21:25] doctrine and have no life
[21:26] it's not going to work anymore this is
[21:28] the age of maturity
[21:30] amen and god wants a fully mature bride
[21:32] he's
[21:33] tired of playing with us in childish
[21:35] ways
[21:36] he's tired i mean he's no longer amen is
[21:39] he dealing with us as children
[21:40] we've had 50 some years to grow up in
[21:42] the message and he's not going to allow
[21:44] it any longer
[21:45] amen and he's going to tighten up and
[21:47] make sure we
[21:48] act like adults
[21:53] amen no fussing no fighting no
[21:56] bickering no avenging no holding a
[21:59] grudge against the brother
[22:00] amen we we're going to actually live
[22:03] like jesus christ it's going to happen
[22:04] there will be a bride on this earth that
[22:07] is the very reflection of his nature and
[22:09] his life
[22:11] will she have the revelation the word
[22:13] absolutely she will know this word
[22:14] she will know it forward and backwards
[22:16] but more than that she'll have the
[22:18] capacity to display it
[22:20] through a lived life every day
[22:23] that is the element that god is calling
[22:26] for
[22:26] that is what he's trying to draw out of
[22:28] his bride and he's put the word in and
[22:30] put the word in
[22:31] and put the word in and what does he
[22:33] want to get out he wants to get the life
[22:35] out to whom much is given
[22:39] much is required i was
[22:42] talking to a brother the other day and i
[22:44] mentioned this to a couple of brothers
[22:45] just something
[22:46] a word picture that i've had in my mind
[22:48] something the lord's been dealing with
[22:50] with me on and it's the fact that
[22:53] god's word is like granite
[22:56] because granite is one of the hardest
[22:58] substances
[22:59] on earth it's a stone it's a rock
[23:03] like the rock of revelation stone but
[23:06] i've been looking at granite
[23:08] and granite is so unchanging it doesn't
[23:11] change with temperature it doesn't
[23:12] change with time
[23:13] and so they'll make if you look at a uh
[23:16] in a laboratory or in a machine shop
[23:19] that's making precision tooling
[23:21] a tool and dive shop they have a slab of
[23:23] granite and they lay their parts and
[23:25] they measure their measuring tool
[23:26] off of that because granite doesn't
[23:29] change
[23:31] and god's word doesn't change
[23:34] and it's hard i'm telling you
[23:38] god's word is hard brother branham said
[23:40] you know god's not like a doting old
[23:42] grandpa
[23:43] just let you do anything you want that's
[23:44] the truth god's word is hard
[23:46] it does not flex for you
[23:50] it doesn't matter who you are his word
[23:53] will not flex for you
[23:56] and this this stone that we're talking
[23:58] about is the stone that was cut out of
[24:00] the mountain without hands
[24:02] and then in the scripture then that
[24:03] stone falls on the image of the beast
[24:05] which is man's idea mixed religion man
[24:08] mixing his ideas with god's word
[24:10] that's what this image represents and he
[24:12] smashes it in the feet
[24:14] and grinds it into powder and blows it
[24:16] like the chaff in the wind
[24:18] a total destruction because the word
[24:21] smites it but there are those
[24:24] who will fall on this stone
[24:28] and be broken so whenever you come in
[24:31] contact
[24:32] with the word you will break
[24:35] it'll either break you or you'll be
[24:38] broken on it
[24:39] it'll either be involuntary or voluntary
[24:42] but you're going to be broken by this
[24:44] word
[24:45] it'll break your ideas it'll break your
[24:48] concepts
[24:48] it'll break i mean it'll break your
[24:50] flawed character it'll break your
[24:52] complexes
[24:53] this word will break you
[24:57] and i said god i want to voluntarily
[25:00] throw
[25:01] myself on the stone and be broken so
[25:03] that you can put me together the way you
[25:05] want me by your word
[25:07] because he's not going to flex the word
[25:10] to make it more accommodating to us
[25:12] because somehow he's a doting old
[25:14] grandpa that doesn't want us to suffer
[25:16] no suffering is part of the games if you
[25:18] suffer with him you'll reign with him
[25:20] he's never tried to avoid suffering for
[25:22] us
[25:23] that's never been part of god's plan to
[25:25] bypass suffering
[25:26] amen part of his plan is that you'll go
[25:28] right through suffering so you can be
[25:30] molded so you and i can be molded into
[25:34] the character of christ
[25:35] so when we come in contact we just
[25:38] recognize
[25:39] now that this word will
[25:42] not change
[25:47] this whole world is going to change
[25:50] to match god's word
[25:53] we get the first taste of it in the
[25:54] millennium when christ rules with a rod
[25:56] of iron
[25:58] but the perfect taste comes in the new
[25:59] heavens and new earth when everything's
[26:01] refashioned according to his design
[26:04] so this everything that we know is going
[26:06] to be broken
[26:08] by this word amen that's why we come in
[26:11] contact with it and
[26:12] and we we sometimes think that
[26:15] that it's going to work out all right
[26:17] and just because judgment's delayed
[26:19] doesn't mean judgment's not coming
[26:22] just because he hasn't spanked us yet
[26:24] doesn't mean he's not spanking us
[26:28] praise god but the children of god want
[26:31] it
[26:32] they're such a weird group of people
[26:34] they're so strange to the common
[26:35] thinking
[26:36] because they said thy rod and my staff
[26:38] they comfort me
[26:40] i'm comfort in knowing that you will
[26:42] break off of me
[26:43] anything that's not like you and it may
[26:45] not be comfortable i may not enjoy the
[26:47] process but it's the desire of my heart
[26:50] to be like him
[26:51] the desire of my heart is to be pleasing
[26:53] to him so his rod and his staff
[26:55] they comfort me
[26:58] let's turn over here and look at mark
[27:00] 12.
[27:03] we're going to pick up the same thing in
[27:05] scripture but i want to look at the
[27:06] terminology here
[27:14] same thing the answer asked a question
[27:17] and in mark chapter 12
[27:19] verse 29 jesus is going to
[27:23] answer the question
[27:26] and jesus answered him the first of all
[27:28] the commandments is hero israel the lord
[27:30] our god is one lord
[27:32] and thou shalt love the lord thy god
[27:34] with all thy heart
[27:35] by thy soul with all thy mind with all
[27:38] thy strength
[27:39] this is the first commandment and the
[27:41] second is like
[27:42] namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor
[27:45] as thyself
[27:46] there is none other commandment greater
[27:49] than these
[27:52] wow jesus said it so we believe it
[27:56] there is none other commandment greater
[27:59] than these
[28:00] so if i'm going to live the word i must
[28:04] start
[28:04] with number one and number two
[28:09] you realize this is more important than
[28:12] not cutting your hair
[28:15] this is more important this is these
[28:18] these there's
[28:18] no greater commandments than these two
[28:22] that doesn't mean we you know until i
[28:24] get these right i might as well
[28:25] trim my hair that's not what we mean you
[28:28] know that's not what i mean
[28:29] but we can put the wrong emphasis and we
[28:31] put importance on the wrong things
[28:33] and make some things more important than
[28:35] other things but when jesus tells us
[28:37] there is none greater commandments than
[28:39] these two commandments that you love the
[28:41] lord thy god with all your heart with
[28:43] all your mind with all your soul with
[28:44] all your strength and that you love your
[28:46] neighbor
[28:47] as yourself and he said there's all the
[28:49] law and the prophets rest on this
[28:51] and there's no greater commandments than
[28:53] these
[28:55] hallelujah praise god
[28:59] there's this this word love that's used
[29:02] here i've we've talked about this many
[29:04] times this is not new to you but i just
[29:05] want to bring it in the context that
[29:07] we're in now
[29:08] this word love not being an emotional uh
[29:11] type of thing
[29:13] there's a section in the in the
[29:15] concordance
[29:16] that there's a a greek scholar who talks
[29:19] about this word
[29:20] agape it matches the same thing brother
[29:23] branham taught us but i want to use this
[29:25] here for the wording that he has says
[29:27] the verb
[29:28] agapen is the love of intelligence
[29:31] reason
[29:31] and comprehension coupled with the
[29:34] corresponding purpose
[29:36] i just i've read that to you before but
[29:38] it means so much to me
[29:40] this is based off revelation and
[29:42] understanding the word
[29:44] this is a love that's based on knowing
[29:46] who you are knowing who god is and
[29:48] knowing what he's trying to do
[29:50] right it's not fickle and tossed around
[29:53] by somebody said this and i'm hurt
[29:55] no they were nice to me and now i love
[29:56] them and it's not that kind
[29:58] it's not that at all it's so much higher
[30:00] than that because it's based off
[30:02] understanding god and understanding
[30:04] god's word
[30:05] now gives me the capacity to love the
[30:07] way god can love
[30:10] it says i'm going to read it again the
[30:12] verb agapen
[30:13] is the love of intelligence reason and
[30:16] comprehension
[30:17] coupled with the corresponding purpose
[30:19] in this its content is vastly outranks
[30:22] the other type of love
[30:23] infilian expresses the love of mere
[30:26] personal affection or liking
[30:28] including even the passions where the
[30:30] context requires
[30:31] and no intelligence or high purpose is
[30:33] involved
[30:35] this content places the verb on a
[30:38] on a low level it could never be said of
[30:40] god that hephilii
[30:42] or what brother man calls philio love
[30:44] the sinful world
[30:45] as far as phillian is concerned he could
[30:48] only abominate the foul
[30:50] world jesus never asked us to love our
[30:52] enemies in the sense of filian
[30:53] he never himself loved his enemies in
[30:55] that way but agape and
[30:57] yes with this love did god love the
[30:59] world and we can love our enemies
[31:01] comprehending all that is wrong
[31:04] sanctifying the world
[31:05] converting our enemies amen
[31:09] praise god that's it that's all i want
[31:11] to read in that
[31:12] so so the whole point here is that
[31:15] there's a higher level of
[31:16] understanding that gives us the capacity
[31:19] to love like god loves
[31:20] because we understand like like
[31:24] when you look out and and jesus looked
[31:26] out over the crowd
[31:28] and he had compassion on them they had
[31:31] been doing things
[31:32] that were wrong and no doubt believing
[31:34] things that were wrong
[31:35] but he had compassion on them because
[31:37] they were scattered like a sheep with no
[31:39] shepherd
[31:40] like he understood why they're in the
[31:42] condition they're in
[31:44] like when we begin to see the world and
[31:46] the churches and the condition they're
[31:47] in
[31:48] i mean there's a higher level of
[31:50] understanding where we say i understand
[31:52] why they're in the condition they're in
[31:54] because i understand the condition i was
[31:56] previously in
[31:57] and i can imagine the condition i would
[31:59] be in without the grace of god and
[32:01] without the knowledge of his word
[32:02] so it lifts me up into a place where
[32:05] you're not
[32:06] arrogant you're not condescending not
[32:08] pointing an angry finger
[32:10] but actually have a love and say oh god
[32:13] they just don't know they just
[32:16] can't know they're just totally stuck in
[32:19] absolute darkness
[32:20] absolute blindness the god of this evil
[32:22] age is blind to their eyes
[32:23] oh god now there's a compassion that
[32:27] comes
[32:28] because i could see me there if it
[32:30] wasn't for god
[32:33] now that is in no ways excusing behavior
[32:37] it's wrong it's sinful it has to be
[32:39] judged
[32:40] and it will be judged so there's no way
[32:42] in which this love bypasses judgment
[32:46] there's no way in which it says you know
[32:49] god i don't want you to no any longer be
[32:51] just but it's saying oh
[32:52] god if you could open their eyes if they
[32:55] could see
[32:56] if they could repent if they just knew
[32:58] what i knew they wouldn't live like they
[33:00] lived
[33:01] if they just knew if they just had what
[33:04] you pushed in my heart
[33:05] in their heart they wouldn't do what
[33:07] they're doing see it's a whole different
[33:09] level of love
[33:13] hallelujah it's not the doting old
[33:17] grandfather kind of love
[33:20] but it's a it's a love of understanding
[33:23] it's a higher order
[33:25] let's look at romans 13 together
[33:34] romans chapter 13 we heard what jesus
[33:37] said
[33:37] and we'll pick up here what the apostle
[33:39] paul says
[33:47] romans 13 7.
[33:52] render therefore to all their dues
[33:54] tribute to whom tribute is due custom to
[33:56] whom custom
[33:57] fear to whom fear honor to whom honor
[34:00] owe no man anything but to love one
[34:02] another
[34:03] for he that loveth another hath
[34:04] fulfilled the law
[34:06] for this thou shalt not commit adultery
[34:09] thou shall not kill thou shalt not steal
[34:11] thou shalt not bear false witness thou
[34:13] shall not covet and if there be
[34:15] any other commandment it is briefly
[34:17] comprehended in this saying
[34:19] namely thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[34:21] thyself
[34:23] love worketh no ill to his neighbor
[34:25] therefore love is the fulfilling
[34:27] of the law why because if you love your
[34:31] neighbors you loved yourself you
[34:32] wouldn't commit adultery with his wife
[34:34] you wouldn't steal from him you wouldn't
[34:36] kill him see it's all fulfilled in this
[34:38] love god with all your heart with all
[34:41] your soul with all your strength with
[34:43] all your might
[34:44] and love your neighbor as yourself and
[34:47] then god doesn't have to give you a
[34:48] bunch of rules
[34:52] that pure genuine love of god
[34:55] in your heart for those two things takes
[34:57] care of all of it because you wouldn't
[34:59] do your brother wrong with that kind of
[35:00] love
[35:01] you wouldn't do your neighbor wrong with
[35:03] that kind of love
[35:05] amen let's go to first john
[35:13] first john chapter 4.
[35:23] first john chapter 4 and verse 19
[35:27] we love him because he first loved us
[35:31] so saying i love him
[35:34] is only a reflection of the revelation
[35:37] that he loved you first
[35:40] like the ability to love him is only
[35:42] because he had the ability to love you
[35:44] first
[35:46] so that's why when we come to true
[35:48] revelation on the word
[35:50] there is no room for pride and arrogance
[35:54] none whatsoever because true revelation
[35:55] will not bring that
[35:57] will not bring pride will not bring any
[35:59] arrogance because you realize
[36:01] my love to him is only in response to
[36:04] his love to me
[36:05] had he not first loved me i would have
[36:07] no capacity within myself to love him
[36:10] so my love for him and my ability to
[36:12] hear his word and my desire to live his
[36:14] word
[36:14] has nothing to do with me being a good
[36:16] person so i can get
[36:18] no credit for it therefore i can have no
[36:20] arrogance about it i i can't
[36:22] there's nothing that i can claim that i
[36:25] did myself
[36:27] because that arrogant powerful attitude
[36:29] comes with somebody
[36:30] who thinks that they've arrived because
[36:32] they're good or they made a good
[36:33] decision or
[36:34] i'm it wasn't a good choice i made when
[36:36] i decided to serve jesus
[36:39] you know you could never decide that you
[36:41] could never even choose that if he
[36:43] hadn't chose you first
[36:45] you can never have the love that you
[36:46] have for him if he hadn't loved you
[36:47] first
[36:48] we love him because he first loved us
[36:50] and we got to keep these things right in
[36:52] our mind
[36:53] amen we love him because he first loved
[36:56] us
[36:57] verse 20 if a man say i love god and
[36:59] hateth his brother
[37:00] he is a liar for he
[37:03] now now listen i we're gonna we're gonna
[37:06] look at this scripture
[37:08] but you can say i don't hate my brother
[37:11] hates a strong word i just don't like
[37:13] them
[37:13] [Applause]
[37:17] i i just i just don't i just
[37:21] i just don't like him
[37:23] [Music]
[37:24] but look at what he says next for he
[37:27] that
[37:28] loveth not his brother
[37:31] you're not allowed to land somewhere in
[37:34] between
[37:36] the scriptures placing us either one
[37:38] side or the other
[37:40] not giving us room to work in between
[37:44] love and hate verse 20 if a man
[37:48] say i love god and hated this brother he
[37:49] is a liar
[37:51] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[37:52] he hath seen how can he love god whom he
[37:55] hath not seen
[37:58] so he's not saying dislike dislikes not
[38:01] doesn't fit here because
[38:04] brother because let me finish verse 21
[38:07] and then we'll make this comment
[38:08] in this commandment have we from him
[38:10] that he that he who loveth god loveth
[38:13] his brother also
[38:14] so god now is equating your love for
[38:17] your brother with your love for him
[38:18] so if i say i don't hate my brother but
[38:20] i dislike him
[38:23] how does that relate to god
[38:26] because where is god he abides in his
[38:29] people
[38:31] if that's your brother within him is an
[38:33] attribute of god
[38:35] a portion of god a peace of god and if i
[38:38] dislike that
[38:40] how do i feel towards god see it's john
[38:43] who's drawing the equal sign amen it's
[38:46] it's
[38:46] john who's saying and in this
[38:49] commandment have we from him that he
[38:51] he who loveth god love his brother also
[38:54] it's a commandment amen and if it's a
[38:56] commandment
[38:57] then that means if it's a commandment
[38:59] that god's given us and something that
[39:01] god told us to do
[39:02] then he must supply the capacity to do
[39:05] it
[39:06] because this this is not something that
[39:09] you can just do
[39:10] all by yourself it takes the very love
[39:13] of god in your heart to do these
[39:15] because some of us have been wronged in
[39:17] very serious ways
[39:18] some have been wronged in church
[39:19] settings and some have been wronged in
[39:21] family settings
[39:22] and we've gone through some wrong things
[39:24] and you can't say anything else but
[39:26] they're wrong
[39:27] it was wrong it wasn't right what
[39:29] happened somebody took advantage of me
[39:31] abused me
[39:32] manipulated me exposed me or talked evil
[39:35] of me whatever it was
[39:36] hey but don't forget the fact you've
[39:38] done some of those things too
[39:43] amen it's easy or you have sometimes
[39:46] people all they want to do is talk about
[39:48] the hurt
[39:49] all right i was hurt this way and i was
[39:51] hurt that way and i was hurt this way
[39:53] and you know what i want to say to them
[39:54] sometimes is okay we're going to talk
[39:56] about that
[39:56] won't you give equal time to the hurt
[39:58] you've caused
[40:00] if you enjoy talking about who hurt you
[40:02] so much give
[40:03] equal time to those those that you've
[40:06] heard
[40:07] and let's have an honest discussion
[40:10] because sometimes we use these things
[40:12] that i was hurt this way and i was hurt
[40:14] that way
[40:14] and it's we use it as justification to
[40:17] have resentment
[40:19] and bitterness and we wouldn't ever say
[40:21] that but that's exactly what's happening
[40:24] we're using it as a justification for
[40:25] our conduct we know i'm hurt
[40:27] and the reason i can't enter in and the
[40:29] reason i can't worship god and the
[40:30] reason i don't give him all is because
[40:31] i've been hurt
[40:32] and the reason i'm struggling is because
[40:33] i've been hurt my goodness you've never
[40:35] been hurt more than jesus christ was
[40:37] hurt
[40:39] you've never been hurt more than the
[40:40] apostle paul's been heard you've never
[40:42] been hurt more than the disciples were
[40:43] hurt in the first age
[40:45] amen there's there's a point that we've
[40:46] got to come to and we've got to grow up
[40:48] and say if anything ever happened to me
[40:50] god allowed it for my good
[40:53] and i'm not going to let the devil turn
[40:55] that into a pity party
[40:56] where i sit around and nurse a herd just
[40:59] to justify
[41:00] my lack of commitment to him
[41:05] why don't you go to church i've been
[41:06] hurt at churches
[41:07] [Music]
[41:08] the apostle paul was hurt in almost
[41:10] every church he went in
[41:12] but every time he went to the next city
[41:14] he went to the he went to church
[41:16] i mean he went to the synagogue one day
[41:18] and he starts preaching the message he's
[41:20] gone
[41:21] they take him out they stone him leaving
[41:22] for dead he gets up
[41:24] he goes to the next city and preaches
[41:26] the same sermon he just got stoned for
[41:29] why because he loved the brethren
[41:34] it would have been easy for the apostle
[41:36] paul amen you talk about
[41:37] wounds he had physical wounds
[41:41] not just emotional wounds he had him
[41:43] inside
[41:44] and outside scars both ways
[41:48] so it takes away the excuse
[41:51] to nurse a hurt and justification for
[41:54] living a halfway life
[41:58] i don't live a sanctified life i don't
[41:59] live a consecrated life i'm not fully
[42:01] obedient to the word
[42:02] and anytime you talk to somebody about
[42:03] well you know i've been hurt
[42:07] i don't doubt that and i don't doubt
[42:10] that the hurt was a real hurt
[42:12] and that it actually caused pain and
[42:15] that there was real
[42:16] suffering that went with that but let
[42:18] the suffering produce what it's supposed
[42:20] to produce
[42:21] it's not supposed to withdraw you from
[42:23] the body it's not supposed to pull you
[42:25] away from your passion and love for the
[42:27] word
[42:27] or your consecrated life to jesus christ
[42:30] that wasn't the purpose of that hurt
[42:32] because god allowed and if god allowed
[42:34] it it was to move you higher
[42:36] in the kingdom of god and plan of god
[42:38] not to push you down
[42:39] but we're letting the devil keep us down
[42:45] we've gotta we've got to have the right
[42:48] attitude about these things
[42:52] and if god told me to love my brother
[42:55] the same way that i love god
[42:58] then he's got to supply the capacity
[43:02] because in my human flesh i am void
[43:06] i find myself void of the ability i mean
[43:09] especially with somebody who's really
[43:11] done you wrong
[43:12] you find yourself on empty when it comes
[43:14] to trying to love that brother trying to
[43:16] love that sister trying to love that
[43:18] family member
[43:19] all of a sudden you find that i just
[43:20] don't have a capacity to do it
[43:22] but if it's in the word i can ask for it
[43:27] if it's there in the scripture and it's
[43:29] a commandment i can get down to pray
[43:31] but you know what i have to do when i
[43:33] get down to pray i've got to be real
[43:35] with god
[43:36] i've got to be genuine in my attempt i
[43:38] can't be half-hearted
[43:40] i can't give lip service to an idea but
[43:42] i've got to
[43:43] mean it from my heart and i got to say
[43:45] god i'm having trouble forgiving this
[43:48] brother
[43:48] i'm having trouble getting past this
[43:50] hurt but your word
[43:52] says that i've got to love them the same
[43:54] as i love you
[43:55] and i'm asking you now to heal this in
[43:58] my broken heart
[43:59] and give me the ability to love the way
[44:01] you love
[44:02] why because it's in the word and
[44:04] anything in the word you can ask for and
[44:06] you can have faith that he'll do it
[44:10] and sometimes the devil's tricked us
[44:12] into nursing a wound so
[44:14] long that we get so comfortable nursing
[44:17] the womb
[44:19] and we like the attention we get
[44:24] from others because others will show
[44:26] compassion
[44:29] because you're dealing with people who
[44:30] have love they'll show real compassion
[44:32] and real concern
[44:35] and sometimes we enjoy the compassion
[44:37] and concern so much
[44:40] that we're not willing to get over it
[44:42] because there's a fear
[44:44] on the inside of losing this contact
[44:46] with compassion
[44:47] and love
[44:51] humans are so weak
[44:54] the human mind and the human emotion
[44:56] drop is so
[44:58] weak we'll nurse a hurt
[45:02] just because when we talk about it
[45:04] somebody shows us love
[45:06] and compassion and feeling and we we
[45:09] want that
[45:10] so bad that we're willing to hold on to
[45:13] something
[45:14] to get the compassion and it's all
[45:17] human human love human compassion human
[45:21] hurt
[45:23] if we would just be willing to drop that
[45:25] thing
[45:26] and receive the love of god it would
[45:29] actually be the bomb and gilead that
[45:30] would heal our broken heart
[45:33] and deliver us even from the need for
[45:35] human compassion
[45:36] even from the need to somebody to pet me
[45:39] and stroke me and tell me it's going to
[45:40] be all right
[45:41] but i get to a place where i say it's
[45:43] not all right because you tell me it's
[45:44] all right it's all right because it's
[45:45] really all right
[45:47] and it's not all right for 10 minutes
[45:49] while you talk to me but tomorrow it
[45:50] hurts again
[45:51] no there's something that god has done
[45:53] that makes it all right today
[45:54] and all right tomorrow and all right the
[45:56] next day and a year from now it'll still
[45:58] be okay
[45:58] because there's a bomb in gilead there's
[46:00] a healing for the spirit realm
[46:04] when jesus came and they handed him the
[46:06] scroll and he opened it up and he began
[46:08] to read from the scroll
[46:11] he said he's here to bind up the
[46:13] brokenhearted
[46:19] part of jesus ministry is to bind up the
[46:21] brokenhearted
[46:23] and set at liberty those that are
[46:26] captive
[46:28] he wasn't talking about heart disease
[46:33] it wasn't hypertension he's talking
[46:36] about
[46:36] your broken heart your emotional realm
[46:41] he's here to bind up the brokenhearted
[46:44] quit going to people to try to get a fix
[46:49] for what he already said he's here to
[46:51] fix
[46:54] it's not wrong to talk to somebody but
[46:56] when we talk to somebody and talk to
[46:58] somebody and talk to somebody and talk
[46:59] to somebody and talk to somebody
[47:01] and years later nothing really has
[47:03] changed
[47:05] it's time to go talk to the one person
[47:07] who can bring a change
[47:11] god i need a permanent change in my
[47:13] heart
[47:14] because i find the way i am now i i have
[47:17] a hard time loving that but i have a
[47:18] hard time
[47:19] shaking their hand i have a hard time
[47:21] hugging their neck i have a hard time
[47:23] having
[47:23] i have a hard time wishing for their
[47:25] benefit and for blessings in their life
[47:30] sometimes we say we forgive somebody and
[47:32] we say you know everything's all right
[47:34] but every time something negative
[47:36] happens in their life you kind of have a
[47:37] little
[47:38] bit of yeah well they had it coming
[47:42] instead of a grieving oh god why is this
[47:45] hitting my brother why is this hitting
[47:46] my sister why is this hit their family
[47:48] oh god deliver them from that no there's
[47:50] a little bit of satisfaction
[47:52] in their suffering because they made you
[47:54] suffer and you're kind of happy that
[47:56] they're suffering
[47:57] and you would never take that and put
[47:59] that on we wouldn't put that on our lips
[48:00] but that's exactly what's happening down
[48:02] in the emotional realm
[48:04] of us weak needy broken
[48:07] failed human beings
[48:12] but god can god can do something
[48:14] different amen
[48:16] to where when we see somebody else
[48:18] suffer no matter how bad they made
[48:20] us suffer we can say oh god help my
[48:22] brother
[48:23] help my sister i i don't want them to
[48:26] hurt
[48:26] and i don't want them to have trouble
[48:30] i'm telling you we can get to that place
[48:33] why because it's in the word amen and
[48:36] this is the day for the fulfillment
[48:38] the full display of the full word do you
[48:40] believe that we're living in the hour
[48:42] the full display of the full word
[48:43] amen to actually be christ-like
[48:47] not as lip service but as an actual
[48:49] reality and if that's the hour we live
[48:51] in it that's what we believe
[48:52] this also must be on display
[48:59] go to galatians chapter 5.
[49:11] i've said before my favorite kind of
[49:13] preaching that i love more than anything
[49:15] is breaking down the message getting
[49:18] into the seals feast of trump is the
[49:20] timeline brother bennett's ministry
[49:22] i enjoy that so much i like hearing it
[49:24] preach i like preaching it i like
[49:25] talking about it
[49:27] but what good is it if we can't love the
[49:30] brethren
[49:33] you see what i mean those are my
[49:35] favorite subjects i can preach them
[49:37] all day long discuss them all day long
[49:40] but what good
[49:41] is it if it doesn't translate into a
[49:43] life
[49:44] [Music]
[49:48] galatians 5 13
[49:52] for brethren you have been called unto
[49:54] liberty only use not liberty for an
[49:56] occasion to the flesh but by love
[49:58] serve one another for all the laws
[50:01] fulfilled in one word even this
[50:03] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[50:06] but if you bite and devour one another
[50:08] take heed that you be not consumed
[50:11] one another
[50:15] praise god that's the truth
[50:19] we're not to be biting at one another
[50:22] and i'm not just talking about just in
[50:24] our homes that's true
[50:26] in our church but i mean the bride
[50:28] universal
[50:30] not just in this church but the bride
[50:31] around the world there's no place for
[50:33] this
[50:35] biting because if we won't stand for who
[50:38] each other who else is going to stand
[50:39] for us
[50:41] we're coming to a place where nobody
[50:43] else in the world is going to stand
[50:46] we might as well stand for one another
[50:48] and learn to love one another
[50:50] no matter what even if we disagree this
[50:52] agreement's not a problem
[50:56] amen strife is a problem disagreement's
[50:58] not a problem you can disagree with no
[50:59] strife
[51:02] like brother branham said he goes i like
[51:04] cherry pie you like apple
[51:07] well that doesn't cause strife you don't
[51:09] get in a big knock down drag out fight
[51:11] and
[51:12] break fellowship because you disagree
[51:14] and then brother brahm's using such a
[51:15] light things as a thing but he's trying
[51:17] to show
[51:17] amen we should have that same attitude
[51:19] even if it's about doctrinal things
[51:22] even if it's about serious things things
[51:24] that are very deep in our heart
[51:25] and things that we believe to be
[51:26] essential and crucial to know in this
[51:29] day
[51:29] i can still disagree i should be able to
[51:32] i say this way
[51:32] disagree with the brother on that point
[51:34] and still be able to shake his hand and
[51:36] hug his neck and tell him i love him
[51:38] if not there's something wrong with me
[51:40] [Applause]
[51:42] and it better and it it should cause me
[51:45] to question my doctrine
[51:46] because if my doctrine can't produce
[51:48] that life but my doctrine produces
[51:50] strife and anger and animosity
[51:52] then something might be wrong with my
[51:54] doctrine
[51:57] they understand we've got to be real
[51:59] we've got to be genuine
[52:01] we've got this is going to be a real
[52:03] christianity
[52:04] this is not going to be a pretend kind
[52:06] of a thing
[52:06] [Applause]
[52:08] we can't pretend this if we've got
[52:12] feelings of ought towards this and
[52:13] feelings a lot toward that we've got to
[52:15] get to the altar somewhere and we've got
[52:16] to pray and say god you've got to change
[52:18] me
[52:19] [Applause]
[52:20] you've got to change me lord
[52:26] praise god it's the truth
[52:32] these things are going to go
[52:35] i mean they're going to go it's going to
[52:38] go away
[52:39] in the bride these things are going to
[52:40] vanish
[52:43] how can you say that chad because it's
[52:44] in the word and she's going to be a word
[52:47] bride fully living the word
[52:48] these things are going to go away and if
[52:52] we know they're going to go away and we
[52:53] can see it in the word
[52:54] let's start getting in the rhythm of the
[52:56] word let's start getting in the beat
[52:57] amen there's a changing in the beat amen
[53:00] now we see it building
[53:01] and we see it coming let's get into the
[53:03] rhythm of it and say god
[53:04] i need this greater manifestation god i
[53:07] need you to purify my heart
[53:08] god i need you to heal me i need you to
[53:11] give me the right response
[53:12] i need you to take this out of me i need
[53:14] you to put this into me
[53:17] if it's in the word we can ask for it
[53:20] let's go to first corinthians
[53:26] chapter 5 verse 4.
[53:32] and when i when i preach this it's a
[53:35] taking home kind of a thing
[53:37] this is no pitchfork message because
[53:40] where everyone guilty of this
[53:43] because we're in human flesh and we're
[53:47] so susceptible to this where
[53:48] everyone guilty of it and we everyone
[53:51] need to take heart and hear this
[53:54] and apply it first corinthians 5 and 4.
[54:00] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[54:02] when you are gathered together in my
[54:04] spirit with the power of our lord jesus
[54:05] christ
[54:06] to deliver such a one unto satan for the
[54:08] destruction of the flesh that the spirit
[54:10] may be saved
[54:11] in the day of the lord jesus for your
[54:13] glory is not good know you not that a
[54:15] little leaven
[54:16] leaveneth the whole lump so we know that
[54:19] this is a
[54:20] case of fornication in the church and
[54:23] they've let it go he says you let it go
[54:25] because of your pride
[54:26] and the apostle paul is telling them how
[54:28] to judge this matter that they should
[54:29] judge it
[54:30] that they should deal with it that they
[54:31] should bring a correction and
[54:33] that they should disfellowship the
[54:35] brother
[54:37] what is this the love of god
[54:40] this is the love of god but let's turn
[54:42] to second corinthians chapter two
[54:50] second corinthians chapter 2
[54:55] verse 5.
[54:58] he's referring to the same case but if
[55:01] any have caused grief he has not grieved
[55:02] me but in part
[55:04] that i may not overcharge you all
[55:06] sufficient to such a man
[55:07] is this punishment which was inflicted
[55:09] of many so that contrary-wise you ought
[55:11] rather to forgive him
[55:13] and comfort him lest perhaps such a one
[55:15] should be swallowed up with over much
[55:17] sorrow
[55:18] wherefore i beseech you that you would
[55:20] confirm your love
[55:22] toward him for to this end also did i
[55:25] write that i might know the proof of you
[55:27] whether you be obedient in all things
[55:30] they were obedient in judgment where
[55:32] we're going to be obedient
[55:34] in restoration i want to see if you'll
[55:37] be obedient in all things
[55:39] and he's saying restore such a one so
[55:41] that they're not overcome with grief
[55:43] restore such a one and restore him
[55:45] quickly this is what paul is writing
[55:47] so the apostle paul now he tells you
[55:50] this is
[55:51] not according to the word this is not
[55:53] right it has to be dealt with it has to
[55:54] be judged and you have to put him out
[55:56] from among you
[55:58] deliver him to the destruction unto
[56:00] satan for the destruction of the flesh
[56:01] that the soul might be saved
[56:02] what is that that's the love of god but
[56:05] when the man repented
[56:07] now he says restore your love to them
[56:09] confirm your love to him forgive him and
[56:11] restore him
[56:12] what is that the love of god express to
[56:14] the brethren that's why
[56:16] tithe is the love of god and the love of
[56:17] the brethren it's the same
[56:19] love amen for the same entity but this
[56:21] is the first commandment love the lord
[56:23] thy god with all thy heart with all thy
[56:25] soul with all thy mind
[56:27] and the second is like it love thy
[56:28] neighbor as thyself amen sometimes
[56:31] we have individuals and those of us
[56:33] those of us tend to lean one way or the
[56:35] other
[56:36] we have all kinds of personality types
[56:38] here and we go one way
[56:39] some of us are really good at calling
[56:41] out the wrong and standing for the word
[56:44] there's nothing wrong with that right we
[56:45] must take a stand for the word
[56:47] if it's wrong it's wrong if it must be
[56:50] dealt with it must be dealt with if it
[56:51] needs judged it needs judge
[56:53] we are supposed to stand on the word
[56:55] that's our love for god and his word we
[56:57] love
[56:57] god's word more than our relationship
[56:59] with another person
[57:02] that we will stand on the word and i
[57:04] will i will stand with god on the word
[57:06] more than i try to preserve a human
[57:08] relationship
[57:09] that's the love of god some of us are
[57:12] good at that
[57:13] others of us are really good at the
[57:16] reconciling and forgiving part
[57:18] you know they didn't mean to and if you
[57:20] knew the circumstances that they were in
[57:22] and you knew all of that that's also the
[57:24] love of god
[57:27] but you can take either side to error
[57:31] if we're always passing somebody over
[57:33] they do wrong you have but you know
[57:34] their family situation yeah but you know
[57:36] do you know but you know but you know
[57:39] all of a sudden you put
[57:40] that relationship with that person and
[57:43] your human love for that person
[57:44] above the word of god and that is wrong
[57:48] but also to take a stance on the word of
[57:51] god with not fulfilling the word of god
[57:53] and loving
[57:54] a brother is also not right
[57:58] but i say god matures till we can come
[58:00] right in the middle
[58:01] to where i can stand on the word
[58:03] regardless of anything else and wrong is
[58:05] wrong and right is right and we can
[58:06] judge wrong and right
[58:08] but that i can stand with my brother as
[58:10] an advocate
[58:11] just as soon as we've made the judgment
[58:13] that i can go
[58:14] right to the altar and say god now
[58:16] forgive my brother now help them let
[58:17] them be reconciled
[58:18] god you know they didn't mean to do it
[58:20] god you know their family
[58:22] god you
[58:22] [Music]
[58:25] put me right in the middle god put me
[58:27] right in the place where
[58:29] you are because this is how jesus christ
[58:31] acted amen he could look at the
[58:33] pharisees and call him
[58:34] whited sepulchers and he could hang on
[58:36] the cross and say father forgive them
[58:37] they don't know what they're doing
[58:39] and if the bride of jesus christ is
[58:41] going to live the life of jesus christ
[58:42] she's going to be
[58:43] right in between these she will be able
[58:45] to judge by the word and she will
[58:47] not let down on the word for nobody
[58:51] but she will never abandon a brother in
[58:54] need
[58:55] she will never forsake a brother who
[58:57] needs reconciled and needs love
[59:00] what a place to be and what a high
[59:02] calling
[59:04] the apostle paul is showing judge smite
[59:09] reconcile and restore that's
[59:12] all the love of god look through the old
[59:15] testament how many times does he judge
[59:16] and smite
[59:17] then restore and reconcile
[59:20] over and over and over again
[59:24] this is what god does for his children
[59:26] they get wrong
[59:27] he brings the judgment he chastises him
[59:29] uses the rod of man or the rod of famine
[59:31] or
[59:32] plague chastises them then he comes
[59:35] right along
[59:35] and he heals their land and he heals
[59:37] them and he restores them and brings a
[59:39] prophet to them and brings
[59:40] the word back and that cycle repeats
[59:44] and repeats and repeats both sides are
[59:48] the love of god
[59:53] let's go to galatians chapter 6.
[1:00:06] in verse 1.
[1:00:10] galatians 6 and 1. brethren if a man be
[1:00:13] overtaken in a fault ye which are
[1:00:15] spiritual restore such a one
[1:00:17] in the spirit of meekness considering
[1:00:19] thyself lest thou
[1:00:21] also be tempted bear ye one another's
[1:00:24] burns and so fulfill the law of christ
[1:00:29] you know there's a time
[1:00:32] when your judgment is correct what that
[1:00:36] brother did
[1:00:36] is wrong that's wrong and you're
[1:00:39] absolutely right
[1:00:41] and sometimes you're not wrong if you
[1:00:42] need to go and tell them but you know
[1:00:44] you don't always need to be the one that
[1:00:45] goes and tells them
[1:00:48] only if the situation involves you only
[1:00:50] if god's led you to only if you're the
[1:00:52] one who needs to say it
[1:00:55] but you know that that brother is wrong
[1:00:59] my question is knowing that he's wrong
[1:01:01] wrong by the word
[1:01:04] that should put us as an advocate to the
[1:01:08] father
[1:01:10] because he's wrong but i've been wrong
[1:01:17] like he ought to know better
[1:01:20] but i ought to know better
[1:01:25] that's what he says considering thine
[1:01:26] own self
[1:01:29] right this is the way to advocate
[1:01:32] it says if any man be overtaken in a
[1:01:35] fault ye which are spiritual
[1:01:38] restore such a one in the spirit of
[1:01:39] meekness considering thyself lest
[1:01:42] they'll also be tempted
[1:01:45] so if i look at the situation
[1:01:49] with compassion brother brahma said
[1:01:50] don't judge him until you've walked a
[1:01:51] mile in his shoes
[1:01:54] and if we really get over the offense
[1:01:58] sometimes we just need to get over the
[1:01:59] offense
[1:02:01] and just see it the way god sees it i
[1:02:03] mean have you been more offended than
[1:02:05] god
[1:02:10] sometimes we just need to get over the
[1:02:11] offense and really look at what's going
[1:02:13] on in my brother's life and why
[1:02:16] and then consider ourselves and say you
[1:02:17] know what if i've been where he'd been
[1:02:19] and done what he's done
[1:02:20] had done to me what's been done then i'm
[1:02:22] i could see myself doing the same thing
[1:02:24] he's doing it
[1:02:27] and then i quit standing up here
[1:02:30] pointing at my brother
[1:02:31] you need to get this right you need to
[1:02:32] make this right you need to do this
[1:02:34] right well you know what
[1:02:35] you can say that's wrong when you
[1:02:37] shouldn't have done that that's the
[1:02:38] truth
[1:02:40] but then you can come down
[1:02:43] and you can put your arm around your
[1:02:44] brother and say lord i'm on my brother's
[1:02:47] side
[1:02:48] i'm on his team and i'm asking you to
[1:02:51] forgive him
[1:02:53] and i'm asking you to heal him with the
[1:02:54] hurts that led him to this and i'm
[1:02:55] asking you to change the situations that
[1:02:57] caused him to do this
[1:02:58] and i want you to know i'm on his side
[1:03:03] guess what you're not going to lose your
[1:03:04] sonship over that
[1:03:06] you're not saying he's right you're
[1:03:08] saying he's wrong you're not giving a
[1:03:10] pass for misconduct you're just saying
[1:03:12] god
[1:03:12] i want you to open his eyes and i want
[1:03:14] you to forgive him and i want you to do
[1:03:16] this or that
[1:03:16] you know the prophets would pray amen
[1:03:19] there would be intercession all the time
[1:03:22] and if god still needed to judge he
[1:03:23] would still judge even though they were
[1:03:25] praying
[1:03:25] but they were still interceding and i'd
[1:03:28] rather be interceding playing the part
[1:03:30] of christ
[1:03:30] and let god do whatever he's got to do
[1:03:32] rather than trying to condemn this
[1:03:34] brother and ask god to pass extra
[1:03:35] judgment
[1:03:40] because what if somebody did that for
[1:03:42] you and your mistake
[1:03:45] god's going to judge god's going to
[1:03:47] chastise josh is going to correct i
[1:03:48] don't have to worry about that it's sure
[1:03:50] but i can sure get down next to my
[1:03:52] brother and say god i'm on his side and
[1:03:53] i'm
[1:03:54] asking you to forgive him and open his
[1:03:56] eyes and bring a change to this
[1:03:58] situation
[1:04:00] somebody's got to intercede somebody's
[1:04:03] got to stand in the gap
[1:04:04] somebody's got to be an advocate we
[1:04:07] can't just
[1:04:08] kick people out and you know come back
[1:04:10] when you deal with your issue
[1:04:17] there's got to be some real maturity
[1:04:19] coming
[1:04:21] to the bride it's such a fine line
[1:04:23] because you can never condone the
[1:04:25] actions
[1:04:26] and you can never say well it's all
[1:04:27] right no it's wrong and you have to fix
[1:04:30] it
[1:04:31] and you have to make it right and this
[1:04:33] will never be acceptable
[1:04:36] but i'm going to pray for you and i'm
[1:04:39] going to stand in the gap for you and
[1:04:40] pray that god gives you the capacity to
[1:04:42] repent
[1:04:43] and that god will open your eyes so
[1:04:45] you'll see
[1:04:47] it's different let's go to the book of
[1:04:52] exodus
[1:05:01] exodus 32.
[1:05:11] exodus 32 and i'm going to begin reading
[1:05:14] at 17.
[1:05:21] moses was up on the mountain receiving
[1:05:24] the ten commandments
[1:05:25] and these first two tables of stone were
[1:05:27] written on front and back
[1:05:29] and these were two stones that god had
[1:05:31] made himself and written with his own
[1:05:32] finger
[1:05:34] and these were precious and he gave him
[1:05:37] his word and
[1:05:38] then he told moses get down the people
[1:05:40] of sin
[1:05:42] and i'm going to get rid of him and
[1:05:43] moses stood in the gap and said god
[1:05:45] don't do it
[1:05:46] what will the enemy say don't do it lord
[1:05:49] so now he's
[1:05:50] coming down in this part of the story
[1:05:52] he's coming down off the mountain
[1:05:54] and they begin to hear the noise in the
[1:05:55] camp verse 17 and when joshua heard the
[1:05:58] noise of the people as they shouted
[1:06:00] he said unto moses there is a noise of
[1:06:01] war in the camp
[1:06:03] he said is not the voice of them that
[1:06:05] shout for mastery neither is it the
[1:06:06] voice of them that cry for being
[1:06:08] overcome
[1:06:09] but the noise of them that sing do i
[1:06:11] hear
[1:06:13] and i come to pat and it came to pass as
[1:06:15] soon as he come nigh into the cam
[1:06:17] that he saw the calf and the dancing and
[1:06:19] moses anger was waxed hot and he cast
[1:06:22] the tables of
[1:06:23] out of his hands and break them beneath
[1:06:24] the mount and he took the calf which he
[1:06:27] had made and burn it in the fire and
[1:06:29] ground it into powder
[1:06:30] and straw it upon the water and made the
[1:06:32] children of israel drink of it
[1:06:33] and moses said unto aaron what did this
[1:06:35] people and today that thou
[1:06:37] has brought so great a sin upon them
[1:06:40] let's move down to verse 26
[1:06:44] and moses stood in the gate of the camp
[1:06:45] and said who is on the lord's side let
[1:06:47] him come unto me
[1:06:48] and all the sons of levi gathered
[1:06:50] themselves together unto him
[1:06:52] and he said unto them thus saith the
[1:06:54] lord god of israel put every man and
[1:06:55] sword by his side
[1:06:57] and go in and out from the gate to gate
[1:06:58] throughout the camp and slay every man
[1:07:00] his brother
[1:07:01] and every man's companion every man his
[1:07:04] neighbor
[1:07:04] and the children of levi did according
[1:07:06] to the word of moses and their fellow
[1:07:08] the people that day about three thousand
[1:07:09] men
[1:07:10] for moses said it from for moses had
[1:07:13] said consecrate yourselves today to the
[1:07:15] lord even every man upon his son and
[1:07:17] upon his brother
[1:07:18] that he may bestow upon you a blessing
[1:07:20] this day
[1:07:21] it came to pass on tomorrow that moses
[1:07:23] said unto the people you have sinned a
[1:07:25] great sin
[1:07:26] and now i will go up into the lord per
[1:07:27] adventure i shall make an atonement for
[1:07:29] your sin
[1:07:30] and moses returned unto the lord and
[1:07:32] said oh this people have sinned a great
[1:07:34] sin and i have made
[1:07:35] and have made them gods of gold yet now
[1:07:38] if thou wilt forgive their sin
[1:07:40] and if not blot me i pray thee out of
[1:07:43] thy book which thou has written
[1:07:45] the lord said to moses whoever hath
[1:07:47] sinned against me him will i blot out of
[1:07:49] my book
[1:07:52] we look at this and the reason i read
[1:07:54] this is because i want to show
[1:07:55] two sides to the ministry of moses
[1:07:59] when moses come down off the mountain
[1:08:01] saw what had happened
[1:08:03] in his anger he passed a judgment
[1:08:06] and his judgment was a righteous
[1:08:08] judgment
[1:08:10] moses threw down the tables of stone
[1:08:14] took the golden calf burn it grounded
[1:08:15] the powder threw it on the water
[1:08:17] and made them drink it then he called
[1:08:20] for whoever's on the lord's side and the
[1:08:21] levites gathered together took their
[1:08:23] sword and went and killed
[1:08:24] three thousand of their brethren that
[1:08:27] was the judgment of god and moses was
[1:08:29] there executing the judgment of god
[1:08:31] amen he was representing god
[1:08:34] but the next day after he says this is
[1:08:38] wrong you've done wrong you drink this
[1:08:40] you die
[1:08:41] the next day he goes to the mountain to
[1:08:44] make an atonement for their sins
[1:08:45] and he throws himself in the gap and
[1:08:47] said god and
[1:08:48] save the forgive their sin and if not
[1:08:51] blot my
[1:08:52] name out of the book he's willing
[1:08:55] friends this is this is serious he's not
[1:08:58] just saying
[1:08:59] god forgive them horrible people they
[1:09:00] should have never done that he's
[1:09:02] throwing himself in the mix he's putting
[1:09:05] himself with his brethren
[1:09:06] and he's saying if you're gonna don't
[1:09:08] forgive them blot me out lord
[1:09:10] don't don't take them unless you take me
[1:09:14] and basically saying over my dead body
[1:09:18] in a way he said god don't do it to him
[1:09:21] don't do it to him
[1:09:22] if you can't forgive them blot my name
[1:09:24] out and god says
[1:09:25] i'll blot who i'll block i'm not
[1:09:27] blotting yours just because you asked me
[1:09:29] to
[1:09:29] but there was nothing wrong with moses
[1:09:31] request
[1:09:33] brother branham said that always puzzle
[1:09:35] me i'm moses could have a different idea
[1:09:37] and he said i saw it was the it was the
[1:09:38] spirit of christ
[1:09:40] in moses that was interceding
[1:09:44] you see there's two sides to the nature
[1:09:47] of god
[1:09:48] there's judgment and mercy
[1:09:52] moses there he shows both sides
[1:09:57] judgment which was right on in line
[1:10:01] spot on with what should have happened
[1:10:04] but he doesn't
[1:10:04] keep judging and keep judging and keep
[1:10:07] judging
[1:10:08] and keep condemning and keep talking
[1:10:10] about how bad they were the very
[1:10:12] next day after judgment was met he goes
[1:10:14] to the mountain to make an atonement
[1:10:16] and throws himself before god and stands
[1:10:18] in front of the people
[1:10:19] and says if forgive their sin if not
[1:10:21] blot my name out
[1:10:22] and he's shielding the people from god
[1:10:27] an atonement means a covering he said
[1:10:29] i'm gonna go see if i can make a
[1:10:30] covering for your sins
[1:10:32] and moses was wanting to become the
[1:10:34] covering
[1:10:38] can't we do the same thing can't we say
[1:10:41] god this is my brother
[1:10:44] you know you realize we can no longer
[1:10:48] take the attitude if you believe
[1:10:49] you won't believe what i want you do
[1:10:52] your thing onto our thing just leave me
[1:10:53] alone
[1:10:57] my body's not changing until his changes
[1:11:04] you know it doesn't matter i can't just
[1:11:05] say well you can do what you want i'll
[1:11:07] go do what i want we'll just go separate
[1:11:08] ways and not
[1:11:09] not fellowship with each other never not
[1:11:11] even like each other and everything will
[1:11:12] be fine
[1:11:13] if he's part of the body and i'm part of
[1:11:15] the body that ain't going to work
[1:11:19] because i'm not getting a change till he
[1:11:21] gets a change and my atoms and his atoms
[1:11:23] will change at the same time
[1:11:25] and i need him just as much as he needs
[1:11:27] me
[1:11:31] you see these divisions aren't going to
[1:11:33] work it doesn't work in the body of
[1:11:35] christ
[1:11:36] we've got to have the right attitude
[1:11:37] towards stuff you can't force anything
[1:11:39] like you can't
[1:11:40] force a reconciliation you can't force a
[1:11:42] harmony you can't force a unity but you
[1:11:45] sure don't have to work against it
[1:11:48] and you can certainly pray for it
[1:11:52] like we don't we don't have to you you
[1:11:54] can't force anybody to change their idea
[1:11:56] you can't force anybody to do anything
[1:11:58] but my when we recognize that this isn't
[1:12:00] going to work we can get down in an
[1:12:02] earnest prayer and say god something has
[1:12:04] to change here
[1:12:05] you've got to do something we've got to
[1:12:07] we've got to have
[1:12:09] the enemy withdrawn from our camp so
[1:12:11] that we can
[1:12:12] fellowship and love one another as
[1:12:14] brothers
[1:12:16] not force an agreement
[1:12:19] that's ecumenicism or say we disagree
[1:12:22] with that but we'll still have
[1:12:23] no i if i disagree i'll tell you i
[1:12:25] disagree and there's things i can't go
[1:12:27] along with there's certain things i
[1:12:28] can't go along with i'll tell you i
[1:12:30] can't go along with it but i still love
[1:12:31] you you're my brother and i expect to
[1:12:32] see you in the millennium
[1:12:36] you see it's the attitude you can't
[1:12:38] force it neither should you
[1:12:40] drop the word amen in order to have the
[1:12:42] fellowship
[1:12:43] no sir but you've got to have the right
[1:12:46] attitude about it
[1:12:50] how much has god revealed to us in the
[1:12:52] last few years
[1:12:53] changing our paradigm lifting us higher
[1:12:55] uh higher and higher and higher
[1:12:57] and now's not the time amen to draw
[1:13:00] lines and separate it over that
[1:13:02] because the next move higher might move
[1:13:04] us right into a
[1:13:05] different understanding than where we
[1:13:07] are now
[1:13:08] and if we go ahead and determine this is
[1:13:11] in and this is out and this is right and
[1:13:13] this is wrong
[1:13:13] when god's not finished growing up the
[1:13:16] bride yet
[1:13:17] then we're gonna we're gonna force
[1:13:18] ourselves into a position that becomes
[1:13:20] uncomfortable as revelation comes
[1:13:24] it's better just to say i love my
[1:13:26] brothers god's working it all out
[1:13:28] amen we're all gonna wind up in the same
[1:13:29] place at the same time i don't know how
[1:13:31] to work
[1:13:32] i'm not changing my convictions and i'm
[1:13:34] not compromising on my convictions but
[1:13:36] i'm not
[1:13:37] ruling anybody in around and i'm not
[1:13:39] calling you anything but my brother
[1:13:42] you see it's the right attitude the
[1:13:44] attitude matters so much to god
[1:13:48] brother beam said god will let something
[1:13:50] happen just to see what you'll do about
[1:13:51] it
[1:13:54] he'll let something negative something
[1:13:55] terrible just to see what you'll do
[1:13:57] about it
[1:13:59] can you take the nature of jesus christ
[1:14:01] in that situation
[1:14:02] are we going to go back to a human
[1:14:04] nature
[1:14:07] praise god
[1:14:11] let's look at psalms 106.
[1:14:23] psalms 106.
[1:14:30] verse 23
[1:14:36] psalms 106 23 therefore he said that
[1:14:39] he would destroy them had not moses his
[1:14:41] chosen stood before him
[1:14:43] in the breach to turn away his wrath
[1:14:45] unless teachers should destroy them
[1:14:48] this was up on the mount the first time
[1:14:50] when he said the people have sinned and
[1:14:51] i wiped them off and started with you
[1:14:53] and moses threw himself down and said
[1:14:54] don't do it
[1:14:56] but listen he said
[1:14:59] he would destroy them had not moses has
[1:15:03] chosen stood before him in the breach
[1:15:08] god needed moses
[1:15:13] god needed moses to stand in the breach
[1:15:17] he had to have moses stand in the breach
[1:15:20] because
[1:15:20] god had to pull this this nation out
[1:15:23] according to his word he had to deliver
[1:15:25] them and take him to the promised land
[1:15:27] to keep his word he had to have a moses
[1:15:32] who would take the spirit of christ upon
[1:15:34] himself and stand in the gap for the
[1:15:36] people and stand in the breach what was
[1:15:38] it
[1:15:38] it was god and judgment and it was god
[1:15:40] and intercession
[1:15:42] it was god bringing judgment and it was
[1:15:44] god and moses
[1:15:45] standing in the place of intercession
[1:15:47] standing in the breach because
[1:15:49] god is playing out this drama he's got
[1:15:51] to be the righteous judge
[1:15:52] and he's got to be able to show mercy
[1:15:54] because somebody stands in the gap
[1:15:56] he would have destroyed them had not
[1:15:58] moses stood in the breach
[1:16:02] do you think god might still need
[1:16:04] somebody to stand in the breach
[1:16:06] do you realize the bride is standing in
[1:16:07] the breach for the whole world
[1:16:09] if the bride was gone this whole world
[1:16:11] would enter into a cycle of destruction
[1:16:13] that will bring it uttered ruin and
[1:16:15] destruction to bring about the
[1:16:17] millennium what's holding it back the
[1:16:19] presence of the bride
[1:16:20] right now the bride is standing in the
[1:16:22] breach
[1:16:24] judgment cycle started amen christ has
[1:16:26] been rejected the indictment has been
[1:16:28] given the trial has been preached amen
[1:16:30] there's nothing to hold back the
[1:16:32] judgment
[1:16:32] we see it cycling but it can't unlock in
[1:16:35] full fury
[1:16:36] until the bride is gone amen you're here
[1:16:39] standing in the gap
[1:16:40] amen so that there's still an
[1:16:42] opportunity for somebody to be saved
[1:16:46] and if we can do that for the entire
[1:16:48] planet what about for our brothers and
[1:16:50] sisters
[1:16:51] what about for that one who's done
[1:16:53] something wrong and it's really wrong
[1:16:54] can we not advocate with them for the
[1:16:56] father
[1:16:58] you know if we if we if we've failed if
[1:17:00] we've done something wrong we have an
[1:17:01] advocate for with
[1:17:02] the father which is jesus christ what is
[1:17:04] an advocate
[1:17:05] one who's called alongside to stand next
[1:17:07] to you
[1:17:09] hallelujah can we do that for our
[1:17:11] brothers and sisters can we come
[1:17:13] alongside and pray and stand next to
[1:17:15] and say god i'm not against him i'm on
[1:17:17] the same team thereon
[1:17:18] and i'm asking you forgive us
[1:17:23] can you say it that way can you say not
[1:17:25] god for can you say
[1:17:27] god now that i'm standing i've joined
[1:17:29] myself to this brother in prayer
[1:17:31] can you forgive us can you turn
[1:17:34] our hearts can you open our eyes
[1:17:37] i'm telling you that's the kind of
[1:17:39] prayer that's going to get somewhere
[1:17:40] with god
[1:17:40] and maybe some of the problems we see in
[1:17:42] contention and strife is because there's
[1:17:44] not enough people standing in the gap
[1:17:46] maybe he's waiting for the christ in the
[1:17:49] bride
[1:17:49] to stand in the gap for brothers and
[1:17:51] sisters to bring reconciliation
[1:17:54] to stop just judgment criticizing hey
[1:17:57] saying something's wrong is fine it's
[1:17:59] wrong
[1:17:59] say it's wrong but can we take the other
[1:18:02] side too
[1:18:05] can we stay in the righteous judgment
[1:18:07] and have the spirit of christ
[1:18:09] an intercession
[1:18:12] if we stay on one side of the other
[1:18:14] we're wrong
[1:18:15] but christ was in the middle
[1:18:22] brother in preaching standing in the gap
[1:18:26] he talked about he had done what moses
[1:18:29] did when moses was rejected back in
[1:18:31] egypt and he ran out into the wilderness
[1:18:33] he he was rejected so he went out there
[1:18:35] to nurses hurt
[1:18:40] he thought his people he thought they
[1:18:41] should have received him
[1:18:43] as a deliverer so he went out there for
[1:18:45] 40 years he nursed his hurt
[1:18:49] until when god finally come down and
[1:18:51] says you are the deliverer
[1:18:53] and you're the one to go he didn't want
[1:18:55] to go
[1:18:57] you think about this he raises up to
[1:19:00] he's 40 years old
[1:19:01] and he's mighty in word and indeed
[1:19:05] that's what the scripture says he was a
[1:19:07] mighty man
[1:19:09] he goes to deliver them because he knows
[1:19:10] that's his role
[1:19:12] and they reject him as a deliverer so he
[1:19:15] he's ready to step into the role
[1:19:17] he's ready to deliver his brother he's
[1:19:19] got compassion on them he's ready to do
[1:19:21] all but they reject him so he runs out
[1:19:23] and he nurses his hurt so long
[1:19:26] that when god comes down in a mighty
[1:19:28] manifestation as a pillar of fire and
[1:19:30] speaks to him audibly
[1:19:31] and god says now you're the one to go
[1:19:33] down he says i don't want to go
[1:19:35] i can't do it i'm not able
[1:19:38] moses didn't want to go he had long
[1:19:41] forgot his suffering brethren
[1:19:44] he had lost the love and compassion for
[1:19:47] his brethren
[1:19:49] brahm comes along and he says this
[1:19:53] brother was typing it with himself they
[1:19:55] rejected his message and he got hurt
[1:19:58] and he started nursing his hurt and he
[1:20:01] wanted to run to the wilderness
[1:20:03] to become a guide to trap his wife into
[1:20:06] a lifestyle she didn't want
[1:20:08] i mean he's willing look what he's
[1:20:09] willing to do because what's he going to
[1:20:11] do
[1:20:12] go nurse his hurt
[1:20:16] i'm so glad we had an honest prophet
[1:20:18] that could tell the truth
[1:20:21] it helps me so much
[1:20:24] but god spoke to him said if you do that
[1:20:26] your wife will leave you you'll be a bum
[1:20:32] why because that's not what he was
[1:20:34] called to do
[1:20:36] the brother man says it this way and
[1:20:38] standing in the gap in this message
[1:20:39] where he explains all this
[1:20:41] he said surely if this in itself is a
[1:20:43] tremendous thing that will bring to pass
[1:20:46] and make come to pass a tremendous
[1:20:47] victory in the love divine
[1:20:49] he's talking about danny henry when he
[1:20:51] ran up to him at a
[1:20:52] at a businessman's meeting i believe it
[1:20:54] was and he wrapped his arms around him
[1:20:55] and spoke in french and prophesied
[1:20:59] and become an interpreter three
[1:21:00] interpreters come and interpret it and
[1:21:02] brother branham
[1:21:02] had just read that before we get in this
[1:21:04] part of standing in the gap and it says
[1:21:06] you've chosen the narrow way the harder
[1:21:08] way
[1:21:10] you did it of your own choosing
[1:21:14] this is my way this is the precise way
[1:21:18] this is my way he gets down there he
[1:21:20] says this
[1:21:21] in itself will bring to pass the great
[1:21:23] to tremendous victory
[1:21:24] and the love divine your choice
[1:21:28] will bring to past the great victory in
[1:21:31] divine love
[1:21:32] so he's referring to that he says it'll
[1:21:35] make come to pass a tremendous victory
[1:21:37] in the love divine
[1:21:38] and that's the verb before the adverb
[1:21:39] then it's divine love which is god
[1:21:42] divine love is god
[1:21:45] the capstone is god
[1:21:49] and it takes the love of god to dash out
[1:21:52] there on the front line and stand in the
[1:21:54] gap for the people
[1:21:57] why because you get rejected
[1:22:01] you get criticized you get misjudged and
[1:22:05] misrepresented
[1:22:06] that's what brother bannon is looking at
[1:22:10] that's why it takes the love of god
[1:22:13] you can't do this by yourself if you're
[1:22:16] going to stand in the gap for your
[1:22:17] brother and if you're going to
[1:22:18] proclaim the truth amen and stand in the
[1:22:20] gap you're you're going to be
[1:22:22] rejected you're going to be criticized
[1:22:25] your motives will be challenged
[1:22:26] amen everything about what you do will
[1:22:29] be challenged will be put in question
[1:22:33] but it takes the love of god to run out
[1:22:36] on the front lines and stand in the gap
[1:22:37] for god's people
[1:22:39] and are we going to sit in a foxhole and
[1:22:41] nurse our wounds are we going to dash
[1:22:43] out to the front line
[1:22:44] because there's a tremendous victory
[1:22:45] coming in divine love
[1:22:48] and can i have the love of god enough
[1:22:50] amen to still stand for the truth and
[1:22:52] speak the truth and stand in the gap and
[1:22:54] love my brother regardless of the
[1:22:56] criticism
[1:22:57] regardless of the misjudgment regardless
[1:23:00] of the hurtful statements
[1:23:04] and not be hurt back at them
[1:23:07] and not become offended and break off
[1:23:10] fellowship
[1:23:12] no stand on the front line
[1:23:15] and let what come come but have a higher
[1:23:18] love that says
[1:23:19] god they just don't understand
[1:23:23] it's not it's brother branham was
[1:23:25] preaching one time and he says
[1:23:27] he's praying and the prayer he says oh
[1:23:29] and they hate us then he corrects
[1:23:31] himself he says it's not us they hate
[1:23:32] lord it's you that they hate
[1:23:35] it's your word are we so
[1:23:38] confident of the word of god that we can
[1:23:40] say it's not me
[1:23:42] i'm not going to take offense because
[1:23:45] it's not me
[1:23:46] if it's your word it's your word but god
[1:23:48] i'm praying
[1:23:50] that you open the eyes of my brother i'm
[1:23:53] praying that you open all of our eyes
[1:23:55] we haven't all arrived i'm praying god
[1:23:58] that you help
[1:23:59] me see help me see my failures
[1:24:03] i can see my brothers help me see mine
[1:24:06] can we stand alongside and advocate and
[1:24:08] say lord my brother said this and it did
[1:24:10] this and i'm asking you to forgive him
[1:24:11] for my sake
[1:24:13] can you do that who is better
[1:24:17] to stand in the gap than the one that's
[1:24:19] been the most offended
[1:24:22] say god do this for my sake and help us
[1:24:24] lord to have a better understanding
[1:24:26] help me to have a better understanding
[1:24:31] because guess what we've not arrived
[1:24:34] our course is not finished we've not
[1:24:36] finished our race and we can always
[1:24:38] stand alongside and say god
[1:24:39] us help us bring us higher
[1:24:43] help us see more clearly
[1:24:46] i've said this many times before if you
[1:24:48] have a standoff
[1:24:50] and you have a doctrinal standoff two
[1:24:51] good brothers love the lord love one
[1:24:53] another
[1:24:53] and they just can't seem to mesh the
[1:24:55] odds are they're both not seeing it
[1:24:58] as they should that's the odd the odds
[1:25:01] are
[1:25:02] neither he nor he or she nor she is
[1:25:04] seeing it exactly like you should
[1:25:06] when both of us see it exactly like god
[1:25:08] sees it there'll be no contention
[1:25:11] so don't get so dogmatic
[1:25:15] and say this is it and against this hey
[1:25:18] maybe you don't see it like you should
[1:25:20] yet
[1:25:22] maybe we don't see it exactly like we
[1:25:25] should maybe we don't see it exactly
[1:25:26] like we ought to
[1:25:27] because we know nothing as we ought to
[1:25:29] know it
[1:25:31] take heed and now think as thou stand
[1:25:33] lest thou fall
[1:25:35] because we don't none of us see it as we
[1:25:37] ought to because
[1:25:38] after we all see it as we ought to my
[1:25:40] atoms are going to change
[1:25:41] so if i realize there's some things i
[1:25:43] still see it not i don't see as i ought
[1:25:45] to
[1:25:46] then how can i condemn my brother
[1:25:47] because he can't see what i see maybe
[1:25:49] i don't see it like i ought to when i
[1:25:51] see it like i ought to what he's saying
[1:25:53] and what i'm saying will fit right
[1:25:54] together like that
[1:25:55] [Applause]
[1:25:58] there's no reason to fight god can
[1:26:00] defend his own word he doesn't
[1:26:01] need me to do it i don't need to defend
[1:26:04] his word
[1:26:04] and i don't need to declare what's
[1:26:06] exactly right exactly wrong i just take
[1:26:08] what he shows me and i believe it
[1:26:09] and i stand on it and i preach it and
[1:26:12] when you share it and you believe it
[1:26:14] amen don't change what you believe stand
[1:26:16] on it believe it it's your conviction
[1:26:17] it's your revelation
[1:26:19] but just remember in a point of
[1:26:22] contention or questioning
[1:26:23] maybe we don't see it as we ought to yet
[1:26:27] maybe there's more to see that'll bring
[1:26:30] a greater clarity
[1:26:31] that'll bring a greater harmony
[1:26:36] why it's the attitude it's the attitude
[1:26:40] that matters
[1:26:41] you want to have the right attitude
[1:26:44] let's look at matthew 23.
[1:27:00] matthew 23 and verse 23
[1:27:08] woe unto you scribes pharisees
[1:27:10] hypocrites
[1:27:12] if you pay tithe of minton anderson come
[1:27:14] and
[1:27:15] have omitted the weightier matters of
[1:27:16] the law judgment mercy faith these ought
[1:27:19] you to have done and not to leave the
[1:27:20] other undone
[1:27:22] you blind guides which strain at a gnat
[1:27:24] and swallow a camel
[1:27:25] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:27:27] hypocrites for you make clean the
[1:27:29] outside of the cup and of the
[1:27:30] platter but within they are full of
[1:27:33] extortion in the excess
[1:27:35] thou blind pharisee cleanse first that
[1:27:37] which is within the cup
[1:27:38] and platter that the outside the outside
[1:27:42] of them may be clean also
[1:27:43] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:27:45] hypocrites for you are alike unto whited
[1:27:47] sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful
[1:27:49] outward but
[1:27:50] are within full of dead men's bones and
[1:27:52] of all uncleanness
[1:27:54] even so you also outwardly appear
[1:27:56] righteous unto men
[1:27:57] but within you are full of hypocrisy and
[1:28:00] iniquity
[1:28:03] can jesus lay down a judgment
[1:28:06] can jesus tell the truth
[1:28:11] let's turn over to luke 23
[1:28:22] luke 23
[1:28:26] and i want to look at verse 32.
[1:28:32] this is jesus being crucified so there
[1:28:35] were also two other male factors
[1:28:37] led with him to be put to death when
[1:28:39] they were come to the place which is
[1:28:41] called calvary there
[1:28:42] they crucified him and the male factor
[1:28:45] is one on the right hand and the other
[1:28:46] on the left
[1:28:47] then jesus said then said jesus father
[1:28:49] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:28:51] do
[1:28:53] and they parted his raiment and cast
[1:28:54] lots and the people stood
[1:28:57] beholding and the rulers also with them
[1:28:59] derided him saying
[1:29:00] he saved others let him save himself if
[1:29:03] he be christ
[1:29:04] the chosen of god jesus is nailed to the
[1:29:08] cross
[1:29:09] after gone through some of the most
[1:29:11] horrendous torture and most offensive
[1:29:14] things that can happen to a human being
[1:29:16] mocked and ridiculed made fun of falsely
[1:29:19] accused
[1:29:20] beaten stripped naked nailed to a cross
[1:29:24] you have never been that offended in
[1:29:26] your life
[1:29:29] i can safely say you you and i have
[1:29:31] never been that offended in our lives
[1:29:34] and he's looking out at the very people
[1:29:37] who were crying crucify him
[1:29:40] crucify him and the rulers were with the
[1:29:43] people because the next verse says
[1:29:45] that the rulers were with the people
[1:29:48] and he still says father forgive them
[1:29:52] they don't know what they're doing
[1:29:55] what kind of love is this agape love
[1:29:58] capstone love
[1:29:59] the love of understanding of
[1:30:01] intelligence of reason
[1:30:03] and decision where he's flying higher
[1:30:05] than everybody else in the crowd
[1:30:07] and he understands the word that's being
[1:30:09] fulfilled he understands the necessity
[1:30:11] for a judas a necessity for those who
[1:30:14] would cry out for his blood
[1:30:15] a necessity for romans who would nail
[1:30:17] him to the cross he could see that this
[1:30:19] is the plan of god
[1:30:20] and necessary for the furthering of the
[1:30:22] kingdom of god and he could look and say
[1:30:24] father
[1:30:25] forgive them they don't know what
[1:30:27] they're doing
[1:30:30] oh can we do the same thing with
[1:30:32] revelation can we look at those around
[1:30:35] us
[1:30:35] amen who criticize what we do or
[1:30:37] chastise us or are
[1:30:38] misjudged and can say father forgive
[1:30:41] them they don't know what they're doing
[1:30:42] and half the time i don't know what i'm
[1:30:43] doing forgive us father
[1:30:46] forgive us bring us into a better spot
[1:30:48] bring us into a better condition
[1:30:51] can we take that approach
[1:30:55] can we have the very life of jesus
[1:30:57] christ living on the inside
[1:31:01] and we realize god needed
[1:31:04] moses to stand in the gap
[1:31:07] so the scripture says psalms 106. he
[1:31:10] would have destroyed them had not moses
[1:31:15] but jesus is here and there's priests
[1:31:18] there
[1:31:19] there's people there they've called for
[1:31:22] his blood
[1:31:24] they've conspired against him they've
[1:31:25] been angry at him
[1:31:27] he said father forgive them
[1:31:30] my question to you is what would have
[1:31:33] happened to that generation
[1:31:35] had he not said that
[1:31:42] you know power of life and death is in
[1:31:44] the
[1:31:45] tongue and the son of god
[1:31:48] is an attribute of god is an expression
[1:31:51] of god
[1:31:53] it matters what we say
[1:31:59] he was there talking to the disciples
[1:32:02] and he looked out among the people and
[1:32:03] had compassion for them
[1:32:05] he said pray to the lord of the harvest
[1:32:07] that will send laborers into the harvest
[1:32:09] brother brahm takes his whole story and
[1:32:10] he says he was the lord of the harvest
[1:32:12] he's the one who told him they need
[1:32:14] why did they have to pray he said
[1:32:16] because god has so fixed this program he
[1:32:18] cannot do anything without you and i
[1:32:21] and we need to ask
[1:32:24] if we need to ask for laborers how about
[1:32:28] asking for forgiveness for a brother how
[1:32:30] about asking god
[1:32:31] to open his eyes how about asking god to
[1:32:33] change the circumstances how about
[1:32:34] asking god to reconcile this situation
[1:32:37] how about using our the power of life
[1:32:39] and death
[1:32:40] and our sonship and use it for things
[1:32:42] that christ was doing
[1:32:44] amen remember when elisha
[1:32:48] and the she bears i mean when he was
[1:32:50] offended amen he had the power because
[1:32:52] of his position
[1:32:53] to call for she bears and they came and
[1:32:55] they killed
[1:32:57] it really happened because of his
[1:32:58] position
[1:33:00] because brother branham said that wasn't
[1:33:02] the spirit of christ
[1:33:03] it wasn't the spirit of christ but god
[1:33:06] honored his position
[1:33:07] and because of his position he honored
[1:33:09] his word
[1:33:11] so when he brought brings brother
[1:33:13] branham to the same position amen
[1:33:15] there's a couple being a distraction
[1:33:16] making love on the front seat amen and
[1:33:19] and
[1:33:20] brother brennan was already told there's
[1:33:21] going to be a trap for you his test is
[1:33:23] coming
[1:33:24] and he comes down and he sees the people
[1:33:26] in the front row and they're a
[1:33:27] distraction and he asks them to stop and
[1:33:29] they won't stop
[1:33:31] and he says they're in your hands
[1:33:33] whatever you
[1:33:35] this is the test
[1:33:39] said i forgive you do you realize if he
[1:33:42] hadn't forgave them god wouldn't have
[1:33:44] forgave them
[1:33:45] if he would have said you're dead what
[1:33:47] would have happened to those people in
[1:33:49] the front row
[1:33:50] they would have died but there was a
[1:33:53] prophet of god
[1:33:54] showing us what it's like to be under
[1:33:56] control and have the spirit of christ
[1:33:57] and he says i forgive you
[1:34:02] why can't we catch that friends why is
[1:34:04] it we always wanted we're wrong don't
[1:34:06] want something wrong to happen to you
[1:34:07] there's got to be a meat judgment and
[1:34:09] why can't we just
[1:34:10] forget all of the judgments say god
[1:34:11] don't judge them on my behalf because i
[1:34:13] want them to go free
[1:34:15] i want them to be forgiven i want them
[1:34:17] to go free you're sovereign you do what
[1:34:19] you have to do but not
[1:34:20] for me don't do it for me don't judge
[1:34:22] them on my account don't judge them for
[1:34:24] my benefit don't judge them because it's
[1:34:26] my desire
[1:34:26] my desires they go scot-free
[1:34:30] why why can you say that brother tell me
[1:34:32] they do such wrong because i've done
[1:34:34] wrong and i've got the capacity to do
[1:34:35] wrong again
[1:34:36] and i want somebody who've i've wronged
[1:34:38] to say the same thing about me
[1:34:39] because if they're a son of god their
[1:34:41] words carry weight with god
[1:34:43] and i want them to say god let brother
[1:34:45] chad go
[1:34:46] let him go free let my brother go free
[1:34:49] he's offended me but let him go free
[1:34:51] and i'll do the same for you and you do
[1:34:53] the same for me and let's
[1:34:54] use our sonship to build the body of
[1:34:56] christ not tear it down it
[1:35:00] matters what we say jesus said forgive
[1:35:04] them
[1:35:08] elijah's wrong attitude still brought a
[1:35:12] result
[1:35:15] and brother branham's right attitude
[1:35:16] brought a result
[1:35:19] don't think you can say and do things
[1:35:20] wrong and god will just smudge it over
[1:35:22] no
[1:35:22] you're a son or daughter of god with the
[1:35:24] power of life and death in your tongue
[1:35:26] you you think wrong and speak wrong
[1:35:28] you're going to get wrong
[1:35:29] and you're wrong might hurt somebody
[1:35:31] else terribly bad
[1:35:36] we can all say amen because we're every
[1:35:38] single one of us guilty
[1:35:41] but that in the past is not going to
[1:35:43] work in the future
[1:35:45] he's got to get to the bride to the same
[1:35:47] spot where they can do like brother

[1:36:11] going to climb higher
[1:36:15] still too much self self preservation
[1:36:19] self love still too much self
[1:36:23] let's go to acts chapter 7. act chapter
[1:36:38] 7 verse 51
[1:36:46] they take stephen deacon in the church
[1:36:48] who is doing many signs and wonders
[1:36:50] marvelous works
[1:36:51] contesting with them they could not they
[1:36:53] could not overthrow his wisdom
[1:36:57] so they conspired against him and
[1:36:58] arrested him brings him in for
[1:37:01] questioning
[1:37:01] and he preaches a sermon on the whole
[1:37:04] bible
[1:37:07] i think the word was open to him he was
[1:37:10] reading from the open book
[1:37:13] he preached the whole sermon and he
[1:37:14] comes down to the end
[1:37:16] and this is what he says here at the end
[1:37:18] verse 51
[1:37:19] you stiff-necked and uncircumcised and
[1:37:21] hardened ears
[1:37:22] you do always resist the holy ghost as
[1:37:24] your fathers did so do you
[1:37:26] which of the prophets have not your
[1:37:28] fathers persecuted and they
[1:37:30] they have slain them which showed before
[1:37:32] of the coming of the just one
[1:37:34] and you have been now the betrayers and
[1:37:36] murderers
[1:37:37] who have received the law by the
[1:37:39] disposition of angels and have not kept
[1:37:41] it
[1:37:42] when they heard these things they were
[1:37:43] cut to the heart and they gnashed on him
[1:37:45] with their teeth
[1:37:47] now think about this he just
[1:37:51] preached to them a whole sermon about
[1:37:52] the bible bringing them right up to date
[1:37:55] and he says you stiff-necked and
[1:37:57] uncircumcised
[1:37:59] you do always resist the holy ghost as
[1:38:01] your father's dead
[1:38:03] your your father's in the they killed
[1:38:04] the prophets you're doing the same thing
[1:38:07] i mean i would say he passed an accurate
[1:38:09] judgment
[1:38:11] and he pulled no punches and he told the
[1:38:13] truth
[1:38:14] would you agree that was straight up
[1:38:18] there's some people that have been
[1:38:19] sitting there that day with the attitude
[1:38:21] get him get him get him get him get him
[1:38:22] get him get him
[1:38:26] he had to say what he had to say
[1:38:29] but what he says next is probably the
[1:38:31] most important statement that he makes
[1:38:37] look at what he says next
[1:38:40] when they heard these things they were
[1:38:42] cut to the heart and they gnashed
[1:38:44] them with their teeth but he being full
[1:38:46] of the holy ghost looked up steadfastly
[1:38:47] into heaven and saw the glory of god and
[1:38:49] jesus standing on the right hand of god
[1:38:51] and he said behold i see the heavens
[1:38:53] open and the son of man standing on the
[1:38:55] right hand of god
[1:38:57] what a revelation what an experience
[1:39:00] what a spiritual experience what does
[1:39:03] this revelation and spiritual experience
[1:39:05] produce
[1:39:08] then they cried out with a loud voice
[1:39:09] and stopped their ears and ran upon him
[1:39:11] with one accord
[1:39:12] and cast him out of the city and stoned
[1:39:14] him and the witnesses laid down their
[1:39:16] clothes at a young man's speed whose
[1:39:17] name was
[1:39:18] saul who would become the apostle paul
[1:39:21] and they stoned stephen calling upon god
[1:39:23] and laying and saying lord receive my
[1:39:25] spirit
[1:39:26] and he kneeled down and cried with a
[1:39:28] loud voice lord
[1:39:30] lay not this sin to their charge and
[1:39:32] when he had said this he fell asleep
[1:39:36] this tremendous revelation of the open
[1:39:38] work where he can preach to them a
[1:39:39] sermon
[1:39:40] compact into a sermon their journey
[1:39:43] through the entire bible
[1:39:45] and then he can accurately judge their
[1:39:47] current spiritual condition
[1:39:49] and infuriate them to the point they
[1:39:51] want to kill him but at that point god
[1:39:53] opens his eyes gives him a revelation
[1:39:55] and
[1:39:55] he can see heavens open and the sun
[1:39:57] sitting on the right hand of the father
[1:39:58] what a tremendous revelation it didn't
[1:40:01] make him arrogant
[1:40:03] didn't puff him up and didn't give him
[1:40:05] the ability to escape persecution
[1:40:10] they took him out and began to stone him
[1:40:13] he's calling upon the
[1:40:15] name of the lord saying lord receive my
[1:40:17] spirit
[1:40:19] as they're stoning him he's kneeling
[1:40:20] down drop to his knees
[1:40:23] and listen to what he says
[1:40:27] and cried with a loud voice
[1:40:31] lay not the sin to their charge
[1:40:34] you realize he didn't have to cry with a
[1:40:37] loud voice for god to hear him
[1:40:40] who did stephen want to hear this
[1:40:47] he didn't need to scream for god to hear
[1:40:51] he said it to god for the benefit of
[1:40:54] those who would hear it
[1:40:56] and those were the people who were
[1:40:57] stoning him
[1:41:04] who was there that day
[1:41:07] the apostle paul when he was still saul
[1:41:09] unconverted
[1:41:11] remember the sons of god are part of god
[1:41:15] and what they say matters
[1:41:18] and when he says god lay not this sin to
[1:41:21] their charge
[1:41:22] we know at least one man there that day
[1:41:25] needed to be released from guilt
[1:41:27] there was at least one that had to be he
[1:41:30] had to forgive that one and remove guilt
[1:41:32] and ask
[1:41:33] god please god please god you did i
[1:41:36] don't know that stephen knew who was
[1:41:37] there
[1:41:38] but he knew there might be one there
[1:41:39] that's the son of god and for the sake
[1:41:41] of one
[1:41:42] i'll say god forgive them all forgive do
[1:41:45] what they've done to me is wrong this is
[1:41:47] not right i've not done anything wrong
[1:41:48] but
[1:41:49] don't charge them for this said god i
[1:41:52] let them go free
[1:41:53] don't judge them on my account because
[1:41:55] there was one there that was going to
[1:41:57] meet a pillar of fire and become the
[1:41:59] apostle to the eighth
[1:42:00] amen good prophet to the age and he
[1:42:02] needed stephen to release him from guilt
[1:42:05] [Applause]
[1:42:07] said paul consented to stephen's death
[1:42:09] and when brother brahma said what paul
[1:42:11] saw the way that stephen died
[1:42:13] amen it had affected him and it bothered
[1:42:15] him all the way through
[1:42:17] and the way he saw stephen died led to
[1:42:19] his conversion amen and after that
[1:42:21] it gave him the desire to die a martyr
[1:42:23] because of what he saw in stephen's
[1:42:25] death
[1:42:27] praise god amen stephen with a loud
[1:42:30] voice
[1:42:30] why because somebody's got to know that
[1:42:33] i forgive them
[1:42:34] amen they need to hear it i release them
[1:42:36] god
[1:42:37] lay not the sin to their charge
[1:42:41] hallelujah what do we do what power do
[1:42:44] we hold in our hands with unforgiveness
[1:42:48] what do we stop up in the kingdom of god
[1:42:50] what do we slow down
[1:42:51] what do we prevent by having the wrong
[1:42:53] attitude with unforgiveness
[1:42:55] and not releasing our brothers and
[1:42:56] sisters who've hurt us
[1:42:58] [Applause]
[1:43:00] amen we want to get out of here
[1:43:04] we want to see the full word on full
[1:43:06] display
[1:43:07] we want to see everything that he said
[1:43:09] happen we want to see every
[1:43:10] manifestation he said to be there
[1:43:12] we want the whole word on whole display
[1:43:14] and we want to move to the marriage
[1:43:15] supper
[1:43:16] and back here to millennium amen and
[1:43:18] that's not going to happen if we're
[1:43:19] stopping up the works with unforgiveness
[1:43:22] and wrong attitude
[1:43:23] but we've got to advocate for one
[1:43:25] another
[1:43:27] i've wronged some of you before
[1:43:28] unintentionally even
[1:43:30] you've wronged me unintentionally but
[1:43:32] i'm saying i forgive you will you
[1:43:34] forgive me
[1:43:36] can we come together and say lord
[1:43:38] forgive him
[1:43:39] this one did this lord forgive him for
[1:43:41] my sake this one did this
[1:43:42] forgive him for my sake this one did
[1:43:44] this forgive him for my sake can we come
[1:43:46] to that place where we genuinely forgive
[1:43:50] and if we're struggling with that can we
[1:43:52] say god i'm
[1:43:53] desperately in need of something from
[1:43:55] you because from my heart i'm not able
[1:43:57] to let this go
[1:43:58] but this isn't right i'm wrong
[1:44:06] had people tell me before i just can't
[1:44:07] get over it
[1:44:12] no you can't by yourself
[1:44:16] but don't stay in that condition don't
[1:44:18] be happy about that condition
[1:44:20] if i got to the place where something
[1:44:22] was eating me up with bitterness and i
[1:44:24] just couldn't get over it
[1:44:25] i'd be fasting and praying and asking
[1:44:27] god to remove that thing from me
[1:44:29] god take it right out of my heart lord
[1:44:32] it's hindering your whole program
[1:44:36] it's affecting somebody else it's
[1:44:38] affecting us
[1:44:40] we've got to take a different approach
[1:44:46] matthew chapter 5.
[1:44:59] matthew chapter 5 verse 10
[1:45:08] blessed are they which are persecuted
[1:45:10] for righteousness sake
[1:45:11] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:45:14] blessed are you when men shall revile
[1:45:16] you and persecute you and shall say all
[1:45:17] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:45:19] my sake
[1:45:20] rejoice and be exceeding glad
[1:45:24] he just took away your excuse to be
[1:45:28] upset want to read that again
[1:45:31] if you've ever felt persecuted by family
[1:45:33] persecuted by other people in the church
[1:45:35] persecuted by those outside
[1:45:37] work co-workers if you've ever felt
[1:45:38] persecuted and got hurt over that
[1:45:41] you took the wrong response because he
[1:45:43] said you're supposed to rejoice
[1:45:48] read verse 11 blessed are you when men
[1:45:50] shall revile you and persecute you and
[1:45:51] shall say all manner of evil against you
[1:45:53] falsely for my sake
[1:45:55] rejoice and be exceeding glad
[1:45:58] for great is your reward in heaven for
[1:46:00] so persecuted they the prophets which
[1:46:02] were before you
[1:46:05] hallelujah if you've been rejected for
[1:46:08] what you believe if you've been
[1:46:09] persecuted for
[1:46:10] if you've been misunderstood and mocked
[1:46:12] and laughed at
[1:46:13] hallelujah your reward is great in
[1:46:15] heaven
[1:46:16] if it came from a close friend if it
[1:46:18] came from a family member if it came
[1:46:19] from somebody in church
[1:46:21] praise be to god this is what the
[1:46:23] disciples did when they were beaten and
[1:46:25] released they went back to the company
[1:46:27] and they began to rejoice that they were
[1:46:28] able to suffer for his namesake
[1:46:30] they did exactly what he told them to do
[1:46:33] they had a rejoicing testifying meeting
[1:46:36] and they were singing and praising god
[1:46:37] because they were found worthy
[1:46:39] amen to suffer for his namesake
[1:46:42] not time to sit back and nurse with how
[1:46:45] could they say that and they did no
[1:46:46] right to do that
[1:46:47] it was even against the law what they
[1:46:49] did to me
[1:46:54] what gave the disciples such power to
[1:46:56] overcome because they recognized this
[1:46:58] amen for the glory that lay ahead he
[1:47:00] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:47:02] we got to set our eyes above this carnal
[1:47:04] world above the carnal things
[1:47:06] and look at what's coming down the road
[1:47:08] hey you know friends there's a
[1:47:10] millennium coming where jesus christ
[1:47:11] will rule with a rod of iron where there
[1:47:13] will be absolute peace upon the earth
[1:47:15] for a thousand years
[1:47:16] and you get to rule in that government
[1:47:19] everything you love will be there amen
[1:47:21] everything you love about creation will
[1:47:23] be there
[1:47:23] everything you love about god's world
[1:47:25] will be there
[1:47:29] sometimes we just got to look a little
[1:47:30] further than what's happening here
[1:47:34] and rejoice
[1:47:51] let's go to ephesians chapter four
[1:48:03] sometimes what we need
[1:48:05] is not a change in our circumstances
[1:48:08] what we need is an adjustment in our
[1:48:09] attitude
[1:48:13] but we're always looking for the change
[1:48:14] in our circumstances to adjust our
[1:48:16] attitude
[1:48:20] well when this changes then i'll be
[1:48:22] happy
[1:48:23] when i don't have to deal with this no
[1:48:25] more then i'll be free
[1:48:27] no god's looking for you to be happy now
[1:48:30] to rejoice
[1:48:30] now to celebrate his word now
[1:48:34] ephesians 4 29 let no corrupt
[1:48:38] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:48:40] but that which is good to the use of
[1:48:44] edifying
[1:48:46] that kind of kills criticism
[1:48:49] kills criticism of brothers and sisters
[1:48:53] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[1:48:55] of your mouth but that which is good to
[1:48:56] the use of edifying
[1:48:58] that it may minister grace unto the
[1:49:00] hearers
[1:49:03] verse 30 and grieve not the holy spirit
[1:49:04] of god whereby you are sealed unto the
[1:49:06] day of redemption
[1:49:07] let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[1:49:09] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[1:49:11] from you with all malice
[1:49:13] and be kind one to another tenderhearted
[1:49:15] forgiving one another
[1:49:17] even as god for christ's sake hath
[1:49:19] forgiven you
[1:49:22] forgive one another as god
[1:49:26] for christ's sake has forgiven you
[1:49:32] god for christ's sake because christ
[1:49:35] asked him to forgive us
[1:49:37] because he's the advocate with the
[1:49:38] father because
[1:49:40] he's in the place of intercession he's
[1:49:42] the one who said father forgive them so
[1:49:44] he forgave you for christ's sake
[1:49:47] he said you ought to forgive one another
[1:49:49] the same way
[1:49:53] can i come alongside my brother and i
[1:49:54] said god forgive them for me
[1:49:58] can you do that can we get to the place
[1:50:01] we say father forgive them for my sake
[1:50:04] i was the one who was offended forgive
[1:50:06] them for my sake
[1:50:08] i'm the one who's hurt but i'm not hurt
[1:50:09] no more you heal me forgive them from my
[1:50:11] sin
[1:50:12] amen praise me they're gone
[1:50:18] brother branham and shalom we we went
[1:50:20] over this this past wednesday but i like
[1:50:21] this quote and pulled it out
[1:50:23] so remember see i have watched when i
[1:50:25] seen them people just completely
[1:50:26] arrogantly walking away
[1:50:28] i think i've tried to express it this
[1:50:30] morning it's gross darkness upon them
[1:50:32] see brother branham is understanding why
[1:50:36] he's not just looking at the offense of
[1:50:37] them leaving him and rejecting him and
[1:50:40] leaving the word
[1:50:41] but he's looking at the reason why
[1:50:44] gross darkness upon them they can't help
[1:50:45] it i forgive them see for not listening
[1:50:53] and seeing the thing that god has done
[1:50:55] still they don't do it
[1:50:56] i still pray god forgive them and i mean
[1:50:59] it from my heart
[1:51:01] i don't say because my master said it
[1:51:03] but i want to feel it in my heart first
[1:51:05] that
[1:51:06] i really do i don't isolate myself from
[1:51:09] people i don't want to do that because
[1:51:10] i have a message for them salvation i
[1:51:12] have to go out among them
[1:51:15] we can pull up and pull away from church
[1:51:18] and pull away from work and pull away
[1:51:19] from talking to anybody out there
[1:51:20] because we've been so rejected
[1:51:22] but we've got a message of salvation
[1:51:25] and the devil wants us with hurts to
[1:51:27] pull back and shut down and
[1:51:28] well i'm not going to tell anybody else
[1:51:29] about every time i do i get my fingers
[1:51:31] smacked
[1:51:33] well get your finger smacked again and
[1:51:34] rejoice greatly because you have a
[1:51:36] reward in heaven
[1:51:39] every time you get wrapped on the
[1:51:40] knuckles say praise god another reward
[1:51:42] in heaven
[1:51:45] you have to have the right approach the
[1:51:46] right attitude the scriptural
[1:51:48] approach scriptural attitude
[1:51:53] and what i love is when he says
[1:51:57] they can't help it
[1:52:00] see the revelation where revelation
[1:52:02] brought brother branham
[1:52:03] he saw it was denominational darkness on
[1:52:06] his brothers out there in the full
[1:52:07] gospel businessmen association
[1:52:09] they were rejecting him and he could say
[1:52:10] it's the gross darkness that's upon the
[1:52:12] whole earth
[1:52:12] they can't help it i forgive them
[1:52:18] sometimes you see somebody that they
[1:52:20] just they're always irritating everybody
[1:52:22] around them
[1:52:24] they have an irritating spirit and
[1:52:26] attitude and they're constantly causing
[1:52:28] problems
[1:52:30] saying something hateful saying
[1:52:31] something this and saying something that
[1:52:34] but if you only knew why
[1:52:39] why nobody wakes up in the morning says
[1:52:41] i want to be crabby and indifferent and
[1:52:42] make
[1:52:43] everybody hate me today
[1:52:46] there's a reason why nobody wakes up in
[1:52:49] the morning and says i'm going to stick
[1:52:51] it
[1:52:51] with a sarcastic comment to everybody
[1:52:53] who talks to me
[1:52:55] nobody wakes up and wants to be that way
[1:52:59] why something has happened
[1:53:02] something has wounded hurt done
[1:53:04] something to hurt them
[1:53:06] you know what they need they need an
[1:53:08] advocate
[1:53:09] they need somebody to intercede on their
[1:53:11] behalf they need somebody to stand along
[1:53:12] beside and say god
[1:53:14] i know my brother don't want to be like
[1:53:16] that i know my sister don't mean those
[1:53:18] hurtful things
[1:53:20] god would you help her i don't know why
[1:53:22] lord i don't understand why she's
[1:53:24] hurting i don't understand why he's like
[1:53:25] that
[1:53:26] but would you lord for my sake would you
[1:53:28] help them open their eyes
[1:53:30] put a love in my heart for them can we
[1:53:33] pray that way
[1:53:34] i think if we start praying that way
[1:53:35] we're going to see some things change
[1:53:38] i think if we really really really take
[1:53:40] god at his word
[1:53:41] we're going to see some things begin to
[1:53:43] move
[1:53:47] brother brother says i have to mean it
[1:53:49] from my heart
[1:53:51] i don't say it just because the bible
[1:53:52] says it i don't say it just because
[1:53:53] brother chad said it sunday
[1:53:56] it's got to be a reality we're not
[1:53:59] looking for any more put on fake
[1:54:00] religion
[1:54:01] you know incantations words that don't
[1:54:04] mean anything
[1:54:05] we're looking for the reality to hit
[1:54:06] home the reality to hit my heart lord
[1:54:09] help me from my heart forgive my brother
[1:54:12] and god there's something plugging me up
[1:54:14] lord wash me out
[1:54:15] pour your oil in me do something in me
[1:54:18] to help me love that brother
[1:54:21] as myself in the token brother bam said
[1:54:24] oh take this solemnly
[1:54:26] we should love one another oh my we
[1:54:28] should be so in love
[1:54:30] don't never speak evil against one
[1:54:32] another if somebody makes a mistake pray
[1:54:34] for him right quick
[1:54:35] we are together in this with god
[1:54:39] god's in this too why
[1:54:43] you say you're waiting for the
[1:54:44] resurrection he said the resurrection is
[1:54:46] waiting on you
[1:54:48] god can do nothing without man
[1:54:51] god you and me and god are in this
[1:54:53] together
[1:54:58] we've got to get this right friends we
[1:55:01] are
[1:55:01] together in this with god we are
[1:55:03] brothers and sisters oh live godly
[1:55:05] live like daughters of god live like
[1:55:07] sons of god live sweet
[1:55:08] kind humble let no evil come in your
[1:55:11] mind and your thinking just dismiss it
[1:55:13] if it knocks on the door take it away
[1:55:15] just say just show your token just keep
[1:55:17] walking i'm under the blood
[1:55:20] so in that negative thought you've got
[1:55:21] to dismiss that negative thought about a
[1:55:23] brother or sister
[1:55:24] we've got to purge it out and just love
[1:55:27] one another
[1:55:28] i tell you god's going to test us
[1:55:33] god especially now that i preached it
[1:55:36] i'm sorry i just want to say right now
[1:55:38] i'm sorry
[1:55:40] god put it on my heart i have a
[1:55:41] responsibility preached he tells me but
[1:55:42] i'm sorry
[1:55:43] you will find that you will be tested in
[1:55:46] this
[1:55:47] probably this week
[1:55:50] but god wants to reinforce the lesson
[1:55:53] god wants us to know what we're supposed
[1:55:55] to do
[1:55:57] i just want to take a minute and talk
[1:55:59] about an issue we've got because we've
[1:56:01] got a lot of people shifting between
[1:56:03] churches in the area right now
[1:56:05] but if we don't take the right attitude
[1:56:07] towards it we're going to be really
[1:56:08] wrong with god and he will chastise us
[1:56:13] you know it's always hurtful when
[1:56:16] somebody leaves one assembly and goes to
[1:56:17] another
[1:56:19] it's always hurtful it's always
[1:56:20] difficult it's difficult for the people
[1:56:22] who are leaving it's difficult for the
[1:56:23] assembly
[1:56:23] it's difficult for everybody
[1:56:27] but we've got to let god move his
[1:56:28] children wherever he wants to
[1:56:30] we got to let god be in charge and we
[1:56:33] got to realize we've got to take the
[1:56:35] right attitude towards this
[1:56:36] because these aren't our favorite bald
[1:56:40] teams
[1:56:42] this isn't ohio state versus michigan
[1:56:45] this isn't a political move democrats
[1:56:47] and republicans
[1:56:49] we got to be really careful about our
[1:56:50] attitude somebody coming to the church
[1:56:53] doesn't equal success and somebody
[1:56:54] leaving doesn't equal failure
[1:56:57] [Applause]
[1:56:58] we've got to change our attitude let the
[1:57:00] children of god be led by the spirit of
[1:57:02] god
[1:57:04] and be happy for that whatever god has
[1:57:06] to do god has to do
[1:57:08] but there's a there's a human nature
[1:57:10] that wants to say
[1:57:11] if they leave amen it's because we're
[1:57:13] wrong but we're not wrong we're right so
[1:57:15] i got to prove her right
[1:57:17] you don't have anything to prove god has
[1:57:20] a sheep and god knows where he wants his
[1:57:22] sheep amen it's one
[1:57:23] army we're all on the same
[1:57:27] side but one may get moved from this
[1:57:30] platoon to that platoon
[1:57:32] it's the same army fighting the same
[1:57:34] battle
[1:57:35] against the same enemy for the same
[1:57:37] standards
[1:57:38] for the same word so don't take a wrong
[1:57:42] attitude that's going to bring
[1:57:43] judgment that's going to stop the
[1:57:46] blessings of god
[1:57:47] let's keep the right attitude let god be
[1:57:49] god and let god sort everything out and
[1:57:51] if somebody if god's going to move
[1:57:53] somebody say god bless them
[1:57:54] help them amen maybe there's something
[1:57:56] in their diet that they need for a
[1:57:57] particular time
[1:57:58] that they'll get somewhere else let god
[1:58:00] feed a sheep
[1:58:02] let god be the great shepherd but don't
[1:58:04] criticize and condemn
[1:58:06] you don't ever have to pull somebody
[1:58:07] down to make yourself go higher
[1:58:10] that's a sign of insecurity and don't
[1:58:13] ever pull somebody down to your level so
[1:58:15] you feel okay living at your level
[1:58:20] we see somebody living at a higher level
[1:58:22] higher level revelation higher standard
[1:58:24] all we want to do is pull them down so
[1:58:25] that we can be okay and not be
[1:58:27] challenged to rise higher
[1:58:28] don't do that and don't push somebody
[1:58:31] down so that you feel like you're higher
[1:58:32] you're not higher
[1:58:36] let god do what god wants to do and just
[1:58:39] be happy
[1:58:43] you know i've heard statements
[1:58:44] statements have come back to me that
[1:58:46] people have stayed you know when
[1:58:47] somebody's going to leave they tried to
[1:58:48] show the fault in another church where
[1:58:50] they're going
[1:58:52] that's a horrible way to get somebody to
[1:58:54] stay if the words that being preached is
[1:58:57] not meeting the need
[1:58:58] then you're criticizing another assembly
[1:59:01] is the wrong motivation to get somebody
[1:59:03] to stay
[1:59:05] it'll never work
[1:59:08] don't ever ever ever ever speak
[1:59:11] critically
[1:59:12] never don't ever be judgmental don't
[1:59:16] ever be critical you just be loving and
[1:59:17] be sweet and be kind
[1:59:20] because if god is put on somebody's
[1:59:21] heart to move there's a reason
[1:59:24] and if that's what god told them to do
[1:59:26] that's what we want them to do
[1:59:28] and if god has told somebody to come
[1:59:30] it's the same way
[1:59:33] we understand amen
[1:59:36] but to say no don't go there do you know
[1:59:39] this this and this
[1:59:40] what in the world how
[1:59:43] so you're going to get somebody to stay
[1:59:45] because they're afraid of where god's
[1:59:46] led them to go
[1:59:47] you're creating fear to hold somebody
[1:59:50] don't ever do that never never never do
[1:59:53] that
[1:59:54] the only reason somebody should stay is
[1:59:55] because god told them to stay
[1:59:57] and this is the place where god's
[1:59:58] feeding them if god wants to feed them
[2:00:01] somebody
[2:00:01] else let them go be fed somewhere else
[2:00:06] it's the word that holds the people not
[2:00:09] because well no they're wrong they're
[2:00:11] wrong they're wrong
[2:00:12] they're wrong they're wrong we're the
[2:00:13] only ones right so stay here
[2:00:16] i want nobody to stay here for that
[2:00:18] reason
[2:00:19] i can tell you right now if that's your
[2:00:21] motivation that's the wrong motivation
[2:00:23] you got to be planted where god wants
[2:00:25] you planted to feed from where god wants
[2:00:26] you to feed
[2:00:27] in the pasture where god wants you to
[2:00:29] eat
[2:00:31] and if god ever decides to move you then
[2:00:33] move
[2:00:35] follow the leading of the lord
[2:00:38] don't start that critical negative
[2:00:42] how how how can you vote for a democrat
[2:00:51] you know why i say that because it shows
[2:00:53] it's political in nature
[2:00:56] this side versus that side this idea
[2:00:58] versus that idea it's political and
[2:01:00] politics has nothing to do with the
[2:01:02] christian church
[2:01:05] we've got to be real these are real
[2:01:07] things this is where we live
[2:01:09] we've got to be real about it and take a
[2:01:10] real approach
[2:01:12] we can act like it's not happening but
[2:01:13] it's happening so let's just be real
[2:01:16] about it and let's be christians about
[2:01:17] it and let's have brotherly love
[2:01:19] that's i mean not even capstone just
[2:01:21] brotherly kindness
[2:01:24] that's not even to the capstone yet
[2:01:27] right yes and if you hear you know they
[2:01:30] said this and this one over there said
[2:01:32] this
[2:01:32] just say ah they didn't mean it that way
[2:01:36] can you do that you say that's my
[2:01:39] brother and you must have misunderstood
[2:01:40] they didn't mean it that way
[2:01:42] why can't we just believe for the
[2:01:44] positive instead of always jumping to
[2:01:45] the negative conclusion
[2:01:47] why can't we just assume something's out
[2:01:49] of context
[2:01:51] you'd be so much happier somebody tells
[2:01:54] you something say oh he didn't mean it
[2:01:56] that way
[2:01:57] and then you're happy you can go on and
[2:02:00] be happy
[2:02:00] i like being happy who doesn't want to
[2:02:02] be happy just be happy
[2:02:05] hey man don't get don't let your blood
[2:02:08] pressure go up
[2:02:08] one drop because somebody went or
[2:02:12] somebody came or somebody said made a
[2:02:14] statement
[2:02:14] don't let it change you a drop you stay
[2:02:17] tied into where christ
[2:02:18] is where god's led you where you know
[2:02:21] you belong you stay tied in and let god
[2:02:23] keep lifting you higher
[2:02:25] we need to have a mature approach
[2:02:29] mother brandon said in questions and
[2:02:30] answers 1964.
[2:02:32] august 23rd so now also here i want to
[2:02:36] bring this out
[2:02:38] i don't think my brother's here tonight
[2:02:39] but somebody made fun of somebody
[2:02:41] leaving the tabernacle and went down to
[2:02:42] brother junior jackson's for a church
[2:02:45] so they went down amongst the dead birds
[2:02:47] aren't you ashamed to make a remark like
[2:02:49] that
[2:02:52] this is somebody who left brother
[2:02:53] branham's church
[2:02:57] and left brother branham's church what
[2:03:00] would you think if you were there and
[2:03:01] they left brother branham's church
[2:03:04] and you knew he was the prophet of the
[2:03:05] age to go somewhere else
[2:03:07] i mean you you can't blame him for
[2:03:10] having a thought
[2:03:15] and if brother branham had people leave
[2:03:17] his church
[2:03:20] it wasn't a sign that he had failed in
[2:03:22] the ministry
[2:03:23] it wasn't a sign that his church wasn't
[2:03:25] right
[2:03:27] listen to how brother venom handles this
[2:03:28] situation
[2:03:33] aren't you ashamed to make a remark like
[2:03:34] that ever who you are if you're my kid
[2:03:36] here in christ i'm ashamed of you
[2:03:41] so all of a sudden you're offended for
[2:03:43] the prophet's sake
[2:03:45] how can you leave this church and go
[2:03:47] down there and now the prophet says i'm
[2:03:49] ashamed of you
[2:03:51] oh i thought i was sticking up for you i
[2:03:53] didn't realize you didn't want me to do
[2:03:55] this
[2:03:56] i didn't realize you'd be ashamed as me
[2:03:58] i'm ashamed of you
[2:03:59] don't do a thing like that junior
[2:04:01] jackson is my brother don ruttle is my
[2:04:03] brother
[2:04:05] see this was going on in brother
[2:04:06] branham's time
[2:04:08] don't be discouraged by it just love the
[2:04:10] lord
[2:04:12] just you know what any time you hear
[2:04:15] some criticism
[2:04:17] about yourself or what you believe take
[2:04:20] it to the lord in prayer and say god is
[2:04:21] there any truth in what they said
[2:04:27] i mean that's scary but if there's some
[2:04:30] truth to it wouldn't you want to make
[2:04:31] things right wouldn't you want to know
[2:04:33] so if you hear some criticism about
[2:04:35] yourself or about something you believe
[2:04:37] in
[2:04:38] hey don't be afraid take it to the lord
[2:04:40] and say lord
[2:04:41] is there any truth to what they said and
[2:04:43] if you find out there's a segment of
[2:04:44] truth then repent
[2:04:46] say god i'm sorry for that attitude i'm
[2:04:48] sorry i said it that way i'm sorry i
[2:04:49] made him feel that way
[2:04:51] what's so wrong with being real it's
[2:04:54] almost like we want to live in the
[2:04:56] in in the image of everything perfect
[2:04:59] instead of getting down to the reality
[2:05:00] of where god wants us
[2:05:01] he wants us to be real if somebody says
[2:05:04] something against you is critical amen
[2:05:06] if there's truth to it say
[2:05:07] hey that part's true i'm sorry i didn't
[2:05:09] i didn't mean to do that i didn't
[2:05:10] recognize i'm sorry
[2:05:12] if you're not sure go to prayer and say
[2:05:14] god tell me am i wrong
[2:05:17] praise be to god let's be real i mean
[2:05:21] if the bride can't be honest who can
[2:05:25] there's no there's nobody else on the
[2:05:27] planet that should be able to be as
[2:05:28] honest as the bride because she should
[2:05:29] be
[2:05:30] secure with who she is in christ totally
[2:05:33] secure
[2:05:34] totally honest and saying you know maybe
[2:05:36] there's truth to it
[2:05:39] so if you come to me and say brother
[2:05:41] chad so-and-so said we're all like this
[2:05:43] i said maybe there's truth to it
[2:05:47] then you'll be ashamed of me
[2:05:51] let's have the all i want more than
[2:05:52] anything is be a real christian
[2:05:55] more than anything in my whole life is i
[2:05:57] want christ
[2:05:58] to be preeminent inside of me i don't
[2:06:02] want my own thoughts
[2:06:03] my own desires to rule i want christ to
[2:06:05] rule this
[2:06:06] tabernacle more than anything
[2:06:09] more than anything i want to be right
[2:06:11] with him
[2:06:14] now he goes the next week so this is
[2:06:17] what he said in questions and answers
[2:06:18] on august 23rd on august 30th the next
[2:06:22] sunday
[2:06:22] he's doing another questions and answers
[2:06:25] here's the question that's wrote in we
[2:06:28] are called
[2:06:29] now here's the question the other day we
[2:06:31] are called unclean birds because we go
[2:06:32] to junior jackson's church
[2:06:34] sometimes because we're in the he don't
[2:06:37] comply with new church rules here at the
[2:06:39] church
[2:06:39] are we out of the perfect will of god to
[2:06:41] attend
[2:06:42] here at times the question is we've been
[2:06:45] we've been called unclean birds that we
[2:06:49] said
[2:06:49] unclean birds by people in brandon
[2:06:52] tabernacle
[2:06:53] for going down to junior jackson's
[2:06:56] because junior jackson doesn't agree
[2:06:58] with the new rules brother brandon made
[2:07:00] for his church
[2:07:00] that's what all this was about when
[2:07:02] brother branham decided to put the gifts
[2:07:04] in the little room
[2:07:05] and bring him to maturity junior jackson
[2:07:07] thought that they should just
[2:07:08] operate openly and all the people in the
[2:07:10] church disagreed went to junior
[2:07:11] jackson's church
[2:07:13] that's what this whole issue is about
[2:07:15] it's about church order
[2:07:16] but it's not about doctrine it's
[2:07:19] not about it's just about church it's a
[2:07:21] matter of church order which every
[2:07:23] sovereign church has a right to have
[2:07:24] their own church order
[2:07:30] we are called unclean birds because we
[2:07:31] go to junior jackson's church sometimes
[2:07:34] because he don't comply with the new
[2:07:36] church rules out here are we out of the
[2:07:37] perfect will of god to attend here at
[2:07:39] times
[2:07:40] now is it wrong for us to visit here
[2:07:43] like because now we have to be separated
[2:07:49] oh i'm glad we've got 1200 tapes
[2:07:53] and that brother branham was honest
[2:07:56] he said no sir i believe junior jackson
[2:07:58] to be a man of god i've already
[2:08:00] explained it i believe
[2:08:01] now we don't agree upon the order of the
[2:08:03] church brother branham
[2:08:05] from the pulpit now junior jackson we
[2:08:07] don't agree
[2:08:08] on the order of the church that's not a
[2:08:11] stumbling point
[2:08:13] that's not a thing to separate
[2:08:14] fellowship over
[2:08:17] we don't agree upon the order of the
[2:08:18] church now i believe that junior
[2:08:20] why how many knows junior jackson why we
[2:08:23] know that man is a godly man he believes
[2:08:25] this message is the same as i do
[2:08:27] and he believes these things frankly
[2:08:29] junior and i are just buddies
[2:08:30] just like the rest of these men jt and
[2:08:32] brother ruttle and brother jackson and
[2:08:34] brother beeler and all these brothers
[2:08:35] here all of us
[2:08:36] we're together now we don't might not
[2:08:38] see just eye to eye alike
[2:08:40] but we believe the same message and we
[2:08:42] stick together
[2:08:45] hallelujah what a great idea why don't
[2:08:48] we just have this idea
[2:08:49] and let god lead way he wants to lead
[2:08:52] let's stay where god wants us to stay
[2:08:54] let's obey what he tells us to do and
[2:08:56] let's just love everybody and be happy
[2:08:58] i don't have to agree and i don't have
[2:08:59] to pretend i agree
[2:09:02] but disagreeing doesn't mean that
[2:09:04] they're not my brother and we can't have
[2:09:05] fellowship
[2:09:07] do we understand that
[2:09:10] there's such insecurity in human beings
[2:09:12] we feel like if we disagree
[2:09:14] on one thing we disagree on all things
[2:09:15] we have to stay separated from one
[2:09:16] another and
[2:09:17] now i have to make a decision
[2:09:22] now they're either bright or they're not
[2:09:24] bright and i'm going to have to decide
[2:09:25] because they don't believe like me
[2:09:26] they must not be my brother because then
[2:09:29] if they're not my brother i don't have
[2:09:30] to apply all the things brother brethren
[2:09:31] said about a brother and all the
[2:09:32] scripture said about a brother
[2:09:34] you have to forgive them you have to
[2:09:36] reconcile you have to have fellowship
[2:09:37] with them
[2:09:38] so now in order to bypass all the
[2:09:40] uncomfortable things brother branham
[2:09:42] said
[2:09:42] i've got to make this person not a
[2:09:44] brother because they don't believe the
[2:09:45] message
[2:09:46] they're not really a bride
[2:09:49] i don't want to be in your position on
[2:09:51] judgment day
[2:09:53] because if you called one of god's elect
[2:09:55] not elect
[2:09:56] you're in big trouble
[2:10:00] based off your opinion
[2:10:06] amen they call you a brother call them a
[2:10:10] brother
[2:10:12] they're a brother brother branham called
[2:10:14] people brothers that are shocking
[2:10:18] knowing what was in their life knowing
[2:10:19] the sin knowing what they believed
[2:10:22] and he still called them brother because
[2:10:23] they called him a brother and considered
[2:10:25] themselves christians
[2:10:30] call him brother don't start trying to
[2:10:32] determine just say
[2:10:34] we just don't agree on this
[2:10:37] was it a major i think it's major do you
[2:10:39] think it's important yeah i think it's
[2:10:40] important
[2:10:41] do you think it's important that the
[2:10:42] bride agrees on this i think it's
[2:10:43] important the bride agrees on this
[2:10:45] well then they must not be right no no
[2:10:46] no no no because just as soon as you do
[2:10:49] that
[2:10:49] then you can make me not bride too
[2:10:52] if it works one way it works the other
[2:10:56] unless you're the one who ultimately
[2:10:57] determines who's in and who's out
[2:11:04] we're not burning incense at your feet
[2:11:08] right
[2:11:12] we've got to quit the strife
[2:11:15] and the mountain it's all based off
[2:11:17] insecurity
[2:11:21] it's a hundred percent based on
[2:11:22] insecurity because if you're
[2:11:24] secure in christ and you're secure and
[2:11:25] what you believe it's okay do you think
[2:11:27] this is a major issue yeah some of these
[2:11:29] things are major
[2:11:30] what do we do about it nothing just keep
[2:11:33] walking the path god told you to walk
[2:11:35] and what you might find out is why when
[2:11:37] you get to the point of a body change
[2:11:38] you
[2:11:38] end up on the same road either you move
[2:11:42] that way or they move this way or you
[2:11:43] both move through the mill something
[2:11:45] will happen
[2:11:46] god's not going to lose his bride and
[2:11:47] she's going to have the revelation of
[2:11:49] the word
[2:11:52] just be careful with the attitude
[2:11:59] praise god
[2:12:03] let's go to first corinthians 13.
[2:12:15] first corinthians 13 and 1.
[2:12:21] though i speak with the tongue of men
[2:12:23] and of angels and have not charity
[2:12:25] i become a sounding brass or a tinkling
[2:12:27] symbol
[2:12:28] charity here is agape love that we've
[2:12:30] been talking about
[2:12:32] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[2:12:33] and understand all mysteries
[2:12:35] and all knowledge and though i have all
[2:12:37] faith so that i can remove mountains
[2:12:39] and have not charity i am
[2:12:43] nothing
[2:12:46] what's the greatest commandment love the
[2:12:49] lord thy god
[2:12:50] with all thy heart thought thy soul with
[2:12:53] all thy might
[2:12:55] and the second is like to the first love
[2:12:58] thy neighbor as thyself
[2:12:59] on these two commandments hang all of
[2:13:01] the law and all the prophets
[2:13:04] and mark he says there is none greater
[2:13:07] commandment
[2:13:08] than these if i have not love
[2:13:12] i am nothing
[2:13:17] brother brahm says in the message humble
[2:13:19] thyself just think if gifts is so great
[2:13:22] what we call power and paul said though
[2:13:24] i have faith that i can move a mountain
[2:13:25] and
[2:13:26] have not charity i am nothing think of
[2:13:27] them and though we say well i understand
[2:13:29] i wish i know the bible
[2:13:31] though i understand all the mysteries of
[2:13:32] god see and still though i could do it
[2:13:34] and have not charity i am nothing i
[2:13:37] ain't got nowhere yet see the main thing
[2:13:39] is love
[2:13:40] and humble yourself with it now surely
[2:13:43] after all
[2:13:44] these years on the field and around the
[2:13:45] world and seeing different people i
[2:13:47] ought to know a little bit about the
[2:13:48] gate to enter in that
[2:13:50] and if you want to get somewhere with
[2:13:51] god never let an arrogant spirit ever
[2:13:53] come around you
[2:13:56] don't let no malice come in no matter
[2:13:58] what anybody does if they are wrong
[2:13:59] don't you never build a complex against
[2:14:01] that person see
[2:14:02] you be sweet and kind remember god loved
[2:14:05] you when you were in sin
[2:14:07] and if the spirit of god is in you
[2:14:08] you'll love the other person when he's
[2:14:10] in wrong
[2:14:10] see just pray for them and love one
[2:14:12] another
[2:14:13] above everything love god and love one
[2:14:16] another and be humble with god and
[2:14:17] around one another
[2:14:18] and god will bless us and it's hard
[2:14:20] telling what he will do
[2:14:22] usually when a church begins to get in
[2:14:23] numbers and get get to getting a little
[2:14:26] bigger or something like that then they
[2:14:27] get away from that real thing
[2:14:29] the real thing which is love
[2:14:33] brother mayor says in the great
[2:14:34] commission 1958
[2:14:38] let me just give you if i found grace in
[2:14:40] your sight through god you take my word
[2:14:42] for this brethren
[2:14:43] if you want to be a blessing and get a
[2:14:45] blessing when a man has done you wrong
[2:14:48] and he is absolutely justly i mean he
[2:14:50] has done you
[2:14:51] wrong and you know that he's done you
[2:14:53] wrong
[2:14:54] this is as bad as it gets so let's just
[2:14:57] paint the picture
[2:14:58] this is the worst of the worst he's done
[2:15:00] you wrong and you know he's done you
[2:15:02] wrong it was intentional on purpose and
[2:15:04] both of you know it
[2:15:06] it's not a misunderstanding this is not
[2:15:08] a you know he might have meant that not
[2:15:10] no
[2:15:10] this is everybody knows he did it he
[2:15:13] meant it
[2:15:14] you know it he knows it that's the most
[2:15:17] offensive
[2:15:19] here's what he says i mean he's done you
[2:15:22] wrong and you know that he's done you
[2:15:23] wrong
[2:15:24] he's done you evil don't mention that
[2:15:27] you take him to prayer before god and
[2:15:30] don't
[2:15:31] take it in a way of just selfish and say
[2:15:32] well i'm supposed to do this but stand
[2:15:34] with your shoulder to his shoulder
[2:15:38] and stand in the presence of god our
[2:15:40] father way a prayer should be made in
[2:15:42] the presence of god say father
[2:15:43] here's my brother and he's justly he
[2:15:46] deserves punishment because he's done me
[2:15:48] evil
[2:15:48] and i don't see why he did it then let
[2:15:51] god go to talking to you
[2:15:53] and you'll see maybe what that man's
[2:15:55] been through the devil has twisted him
[2:15:56] up somewhere and caused him to do that
[2:15:58] though he's absolutely wrong before you
[2:16:00] leave the throne of god you'll be
[2:16:02] feeling
[2:16:02] sorry for that man you'll be
[2:16:04] sympathizing with that brother
[2:16:06] and when you get back down here to earth
[2:16:08] again
[2:16:11] i love that statement
[2:16:14] where do you have to go to change your
[2:16:16] mind and attitude
[2:16:17] you got to leave the carnal things and
[2:16:19] enter into the heavenlies
[2:16:21] when you get back to where to earth
[2:16:23] again you'll go over that brother and
[2:16:25] shake his hand because you know what
[2:16:27] he's been through
[2:16:28] you can't stand with a mortal in the
[2:16:30] presence of god and condemn
[2:16:31] anybody i don't believe no sir even if
[2:16:34] he's a rank
[2:16:35] sinner even you're walking through them
[2:16:39] through the store and somebody's got
[2:16:41] tattoo sleeves all over them and dressed
[2:16:43] in morally and big holes in their ears
[2:16:45] you take that person and stand with them
[2:16:47] in the presence of god
[2:16:48] and you will not condemn that person for
[2:16:50] what they've done to their body
[2:16:52] you'll realize that's the manifestation
[2:16:54] of an evil spirit that came in through a
[2:16:56] wound somewhere
[2:16:58] and when god shows you that whole
[2:17:00] picture you'll say oh god
[2:17:02] you spared me this road thank you god
[2:17:04] but i pray that you'd help them in this
[2:17:06] condition
[2:17:07] you can't stand before god and condemn
[2:17:08] anybody even a rank sinner
[2:17:14] praise be to god what does god want he
[2:17:17] wants you to act like jesus christ
[2:17:21] to be able to tell the truth bring
[2:17:22] righteous judgment and
[2:17:24] stand on the word no matter what and
[2:17:26] then act as an intercessor
[2:17:28] and say god help him bless him
[2:17:33] further on the quote and what about a
[2:17:34] brother that has made a mistake
[2:17:36] though i say he's wrong sometimes he's
[2:17:38] accused wrong when he's not wrong but if
[2:17:40] he is wrong
[2:17:41] well if we will take him to the throne
[2:17:43] of god and stand there shoulder to
[2:17:45] shoulder with our brother
[2:17:46] knowing he's immortal and maybe his
[2:17:48] destination rest upon our attitude
[2:17:50] towards him
[2:17:56] there's some people whose names are not
[2:17:57] written in the lamb's book of life
[2:18:00] their destination isn't dependent on
[2:18:01] your attitude
[2:18:03] but there are those who will be given
[2:18:07] entrance into eternal life
[2:18:09] that will be able to be in the new
[2:18:11] heavens and new earth
[2:18:13] and maybe their destination depends on
[2:18:15] your attitude
[2:18:19] maybe they're among us maybe not every
[2:18:22] single person who attends our church is
[2:18:24] in the lamb's book of life
[2:18:28] but maybe they can be given entrance
[2:18:31] at the white throne judgment and maybe
[2:18:34] our attitude towards them will determine
[2:18:36] their eternal destination
[2:18:41] we've got to be careful friends you know
[2:18:43] what we're going to need to do
[2:18:45] die to self the same theme of the whole
[2:18:49] scripture
[2:18:50] die
[2:18:54] if we take him to the throne of god and
[2:18:55] stand there shoulder to shoulder with
[2:18:56] our brother knowing he's immortal maybe
[2:18:58] his destination rests upon our attitude
[2:19:00] towards him
[2:19:01] when we come back from the throne of god
[2:19:03] we'll realize that we're everyone guilty
[2:19:05] and we
[2:19:06] all need help one from another and the
[2:19:08] best way to do it
[2:19:10] is to pray
[2:19:16] questions and answers 1961.
[2:19:19] now we're all going to make mistakes
[2:19:21] just remember
[2:19:23] how many will confess that's true we're
[2:19:25] all going to make mistakes you think
[2:19:26] your day of mistakes are over
[2:19:28] no sir and some of your mistakes might
[2:19:31] be to offend or hurt somebody that's
[2:19:32] sitting next to you near you
[2:19:35] and you're going to need them to forgive
[2:19:36] you so you might as well start forgiving
[2:19:39] them
[2:19:40] right off the bat now we are all going
[2:19:43] to make mistakes just remember and when
[2:19:45] you're looking at one another don't look
[2:19:46] at the other person's mistake
[2:19:48] see don't do that because remember you
[2:19:50] make mistakes too but look to christ
[2:19:52] who's guiding this person
[2:19:54] and if they need some help then you pray
[2:19:55] for them and that's the way we get along
[2:19:58] pray and remember
[2:19:59] when you are praying for somebody else
[2:20:00] in that kind of a fix god will honor and
[2:20:02] heal
[2:20:03] you when you're praying for somebody
[2:20:04] else
[2:20:10] do you realize how powerful this is
[2:20:12] you're taking the part of christ
[2:20:14] and god so honors that that intercession
[2:20:17] that being an advocate and advocating
[2:20:18] for a brother he so honors that that
[2:20:20] while you're in the middle of praying
[2:20:22] for somebody else
[2:20:23] god will heal your body
[2:20:26] praise be to god sometimes what we need
[2:20:29] to do is just die to ourselves forget
[2:20:31] our problems and start interceding for
[2:20:32] one another
[2:20:34] we all have to come higher friends every
[2:20:36] one of us have to come up higher
[2:20:38] the whole body of christ has got to move
[2:20:40] up higher and higher and higher
[2:20:42] we've got to stand in the gap for one
[2:20:43] another we got to stand in the gap for
[2:20:45] the one that irritates you
[2:20:48] stand in the gap for them until you can
[2:20:50] love them through that irritation
[2:20:51] so you can see there's a heart laying
[2:20:53] down in there and i love that brother
[2:20:57] i love that sister we got to stand for
[2:20:59] one another
[2:21:00] who else is going to stand for us if we
[2:21:02] don't stand for one another who's going
[2:21:03] to advocate for the bride if the bride
[2:21:05] doesn't advocate for one another
[2:21:08] nobody else on this earth is going to do
[2:21:10] it
[2:21:13] remember when you're praying for
[2:21:14] somebody else in that kind of a fix
[2:21:16] god will honor and heal you when you're
[2:21:19] praying for somebody else
[2:21:20] that's right that's what christianity is
[2:21:22] based upon to help one another
[2:21:24] do for another one another be kind to
[2:21:26] one another
[2:21:27] understanding to one another
[2:21:31] hallelujah you know what this is real
[2:21:34] christianity
[2:21:36] the real deal not when everybody comes
[2:21:39] to church
[2:21:40] for a 20-minute sermon we all say god
[2:21:41] loves you we love each other and we go
[2:21:43] out
[2:21:44] but when you stomp on your neighbor's
[2:21:46] toe
[2:21:48] and he says i forgive you for that and
[2:21:51] you say thank you i didn't mean to i'm
[2:21:52] sorry
[2:21:56] the real christianity when hurts
[2:22:00] difficulties and all kinds of statements
[2:22:03] are made
[2:22:05] and you can take it and say god forgive
[2:22:07] them for my sake
[2:22:09] i know they didn't mean i know they
[2:22:10] wouldn't have done if they understood
[2:22:12] the whole situation they wouldn't have
[2:22:13] said that
[2:22:14] if they really understood they wouldn't
[2:22:16] have made that kind of judgment they
[2:22:17] wouldn't have made that kind of
[2:22:18] statement
[2:22:19] god i forgive them and i ask you to
[2:22:21] forgive them too
[2:22:23] can we do that
[2:22:26] let's turn to ezekiel we're going to
[2:22:28] finish with this
[2:22:29] scripture in ezekiel if the musicians
[2:22:31] and brother jim would like to come
[2:22:38] let's go to ezekiel 22.
[2:22:50] the apostle paul said beware when you
[2:22:52] bite and devour one another lest you be
[2:22:54] consumed one of another
[2:22:56] we're here to build up the body of
[2:22:58] christ not tear it down
[2:23:00] not to bite devour to be consumed one of
[2:23:04] another
[2:23:05] but we're here to bless to encourage
[2:23:08] to establish to build up the body of
[2:23:10] christ
[2:23:12] let's look at ezekiel chapter 22 verse
[2:23:14] 29
[2:23:17] the people of the land have used
[2:23:19] depression and exercise robbery and have
[2:23:21] vexed the poor
[2:23:22] and needy yay they have oppressed a
[2:23:24] stranger wrongfully
[2:23:25] so you see here they're in error is that
[2:23:28] right
[2:23:29] they're in there let's look at what
[2:23:30] they've done they've used oppression
[2:23:33] exercised robbery vexed the poor in the
[2:23:36] needy
[2:23:36] they've oppressed the stranger
[2:23:38] wrongfully they
[2:23:40] are wrong
[2:23:43] verse 30 and i sought for a man among
[2:23:45] them that should make up the hedge
[2:23:47] and stand in the gap before me for the
[2:23:49] land that i should not destroy it
[2:23:51] but i found none therefore have i poured
[2:23:54] out
[2:23:54] my indignation upon them i have consumed
[2:23:57] them with the fire of my wrath
[2:23:58] their own way have i recompensed upon
[2:24:01] their heads
[2:24:02] saith the lord god
[2:24:05] they were guilty they had done wrong
[2:24:09] god did not just want to pour out his
[2:24:11] wrath but before he poured out his wrath
[2:24:14] and judgment he was looking for a man
[2:24:17] that would make up the hedge i looked
[2:24:20] for a man
[2:24:22] to make up the hedge i looked god was
[2:24:24] looking for a man to stand in the gap
[2:24:26] but he found none and when he found none
[2:24:29] he poured out the judgment
[2:24:34] i said god i pray that you don't have to
[2:24:37] be looking for a man
[2:24:39] but let me be the man my brother's wrong
[2:24:42] let me stand god teach me how to stand
[2:24:45] in the gap
[2:24:46] teach me how to make up the hedge teach
[2:24:48] me how to come alongside a brother and
[2:24:50] say god forgive them
[2:24:52] they don't know what they're doing
[2:24:55] god is looking he needed moses
[2:24:59] he would have destroyed them had not
[2:25:00] moses he needed moses
[2:25:03] in ezekiel's day he was needing a man he
[2:25:06] was needing somebody he would make up
[2:25:07] the hedge and stand in the gap and
[2:25:08] because there was none there
[2:25:10] he had no choice but to pour out the
[2:25:11] wrath and i'm telling you today he needs
[2:25:14] somebody to stand in the gap
[2:25:16] he needs somebody to stand in the gap
[2:25:18] for their brother and sister need
[2:25:19] somebody to stand in the gap for this
[2:25:21] dark and dying world he needs somebody
[2:25:23] to stand in the gap
[2:25:24] because he's a righteous judge he's a
[2:25:26] righteous god and if something is
[2:25:28] if something's wrong he's got to judge
[2:25:30] it unless he can find somebody that'll
[2:25:32] stand in the gap
[2:25:35] i don't want to be an old cantankerous
[2:25:38] selfish spirit that says you do me wrong
[2:25:40] god's going to get you god's going to
[2:25:42] give you and when it happens that's
[2:25:43] because
[2:25:43] you know that's got to go away
[2:25:48] every time somebody sees something say
[2:25:50] oh god help my brother help my sister
[2:25:52] something goes wrong say god forgive him
[2:25:53] i forgive him i ask you to forgive him
[2:25:57] amen that's the kind of life i want to
[2:26:00] live
[2:26:01] that's the kind of christianity that's
[2:26:02] real that's the kind of bride jesus
[2:26:04] christ is looking for
[2:26:06] and i say god help us all pour out your
[2:26:10] spirit upon us pour the balm in us and
[2:26:12] heal us lord
[2:26:14] bind up the brokenhearted set the
[2:26:17] captives
[2:26:18] free that we can be what you've called
[2:26:20] us to be in this hour
[2:26:22] that we can do what you've asked us to
[2:26:24] do
[2:26:25] how many want to go free let's all stand
[2:26:37] the apostle paul says
[2:26:42] he said i would
[2:26:46] i would be a
[2:26:49] castaway from christ
[2:26:54] for my brethren to be saved
[2:26:57] do you realize what he's saying
[2:27:01] i would he said if he could do it he
[2:27:03] would be willing
[2:27:05] to be a cast away from christ
[2:27:09] so that his kinsmen the jews could be
[2:27:14] saved
[2:27:16] moses said blot my name out
[2:27:19] forgive them and if not blot my name out
[2:27:23] i don't think moses was kidding
[2:27:28] and when paul says i would be a castaway
[2:27:31] that my brethren my kinsfolk would be
[2:27:33] saved
[2:27:35] he wasn't kidding
[2:27:39] who had more revelation than moses and
[2:27:42] paul
[2:27:44] what did their revelation do what kind
[2:27:46] of position did that revelation put them
[2:27:48] in
[2:27:48] that revelation did not make them
[2:27:50] arrogant condescending
[2:27:52] critical judgmental that revelation
[2:27:55] caused them to stand in the gap
[2:27:56] to the point of losing their selves
[2:28:00] to save others what kind of revelation
[2:28:02] did jesus christ have
[2:28:06] enough revelation to lose himself to
[2:28:08] stand in the gap for others
[2:28:11] to give of himself i tell you friends
[2:28:13] when i look at what paul says and i look
[2:28:15] at what
[2:28:15] moses said i can tell you right now i'm
[2:28:17] not where i'm supposed to be
[2:28:20] i have not arrived to that place i am
[2:28:22] not where i'm supposed to be in the
[2:28:24] scriptures
[2:28:24] but i want to be i want god to break me
[2:28:28] down and get me to the point where i can
[2:28:30] from
[2:28:30] my heart say lord if you have to lose me
[2:28:33] to save
[2:28:34] others lose me to save them because
[2:28:36] that's a heart of christ god's sovereign
[2:28:40] if his name's in the book the names in
[2:28:42] the book but moses meant it
[2:28:44] paul a minute i want to be able to mean
[2:28:47] it
[2:28:48] i want to be able to give our life so
[2:28:50] somebody else can be saved
[2:28:52] give up on the hurt give up on the
[2:28:54] offense for somebody else to say
[2:28:56] and i want to mean it from the bottom of
[2:28:58] my heart
[2:29:00] i think there's room for us to grow do
[2:29:02] you believe there's room to grow
[2:29:04] i believe there's room for us to grow
[2:29:07] let's just bow our heads
[2:29:09] dear lord jesus we thank you god
[2:29:13] we thank you father lord for your word
[2:29:16] god how hard your word is how unflexible

[2:34:55] more than anything else in my life i
[2:34:58] want to be what you want me to be
[2:35:00] and if that can become the desire of our
[2:35:02] heart the first commandment

[2:35:08] with all my mind and the second love thy

[2:35:22] if we can have that desire i believe god
[2:35:24] will meet us
[2:35:25] i believe he'll empower us i believe his

[2:35:53] as you can and the one who's hurt you
[2:35:54] the most say the nicest things about it
[2:35:57] until we can break ourselves of this
[2:35:59] habit
[2:36:00] but the member said if you have a habit
[2:36:01] doing something do the opposite
[2:36:04] so if somebody's hurt you and they've
[2:36:05] hurt you bad and you can't be anything
[2:36:07] but critical then you start saying every
[2:36:09] nice thing you can say about that
[2:36:10] individual until that thing's broken
[2:36:13] until you actually start to see some
[2:36:14] good qualities and they're not a bad
[2:36:16] person
[2:36:17] praise god amen god bless you we'll let
[2:36:20] you be dismissed let's sing that song i
[2:36:22] give my mind
