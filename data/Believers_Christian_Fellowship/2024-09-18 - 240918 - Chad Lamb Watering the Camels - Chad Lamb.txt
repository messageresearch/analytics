vessel Lord under your control as I yield myself to your hand may you speak to us Lord we love you we give you the preeminence that you deserve now may you take your preeminence in this place we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you all it's certainly good to be here thank God for the privilege every time that he gives me a chance to serve him in whatever capacity it is even if it's just coming to church to show whose side I'm on in what I believe it's still a privilege amen so I thank God for that if you want to take your Bibles while we're standing and go to Genesis 24 together I want to welcome back brother Benjamin and Brother Kyle it's good to have you guys back in the service we always miss your amens when you're gone so now you got to pull double duty you've missed the service so it's good to have you back amen and uh also wanted to remind you that tomorrow night I'll be having the church age book Bible study we kind of get out of sequence once in a while but we're going to have it tomorrow and I'm really excited about tomorrow tomorrow cuz we're going to go into the book of life so I'm looking forward to that one so if you can make it it'd be nice uh before I read Genesis 24 I just want to give a disclaimer amen I'm I'm preaching on the heels of brother Emanuel he opened the door and I couldn't get away from the inspiration he came last Wednesday and preached out of Genesis 24 but what was amazing to me when I was sitting in my seat is I was actually in the in earlier part of the day preparing for the wedding on Friday because I was going to Sister Annie's wedding out in Holmes County and I was meditating on Genesis 24 and eleazer in the bridegroom uh the bride call from the eleazer ministry so when he came and started preaching on Genesis 24 I said well that's my confirmation praise God and so he opened some things that I got really excited about and I've been meditating on I'm going to share those with you uh tonight but then I go to the wedding on Friday morning and Friday morning they start the wedding not in a traditional way they don't walk down the aisle Levi doesn't take Annie what they do is they start by having a brother come up and read a huge portion out of Genesis 24 and then they acted out the whole scene they went they had a well amen and Annie was waiting by the well and her husband Chris was sent by his father so Chris you know wasn't eleazer he was both he was eleazer and ISAC he was sent to fetch a bride and instead of camels they had ponies so he and the groomsman come up with ponies and she gave them drink and watered the ponies and and the whole dialogue took place and I said well just praise God Amen so I it was my turn you know after they finished as soon as they finished and Levi agreed to let them go now and they went and sat down and I come right to the pull pit and I said I don't even need to read my scripture they already been read and so it was exciting so even though brother Manuel opened the door and then Friday I just can't get away with it so we're going to go back to Genesis 24 and let's look at uh uh verse 10 now it says and the servant Genesis 24:10 and the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master when were in his hand and he arose and went to Mesopotamia into the city of nahor and he made his camels to kneel down without the City by The Well of water at the time of the evening even the time that the women go out to draw water brother Brenham draws attention to so many points here but uh but even the fact that it was the evening time because this is an evening time message it's an evening time when elazer finds the bride for the promised son though it's speaking of our time verse 12 and he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham behold I Stand Here by The Well of water and the daughters of the men of the city came out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou Hast appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master man may God bless you as you take your seats may God bless us as we look into his word amen so for the subject tonight I'd like to take watering the camels uh and so we we'll just build on this thought and we know that eleazer amen is a type of the end time servant to M time ministry that brother brandom fulfilled perfectly and and he wanted that to be you know the Fulfillment of his ministry when he was seeking what his ministry should be God directed him to this scripture so that he would know this is his purpose and part of his ministry was to fetch a bride for Isaac and so he was so faithful in doing that and it's amazing he come to The Well of water amen at the evening time and when the maidens come out to fetch water and when women come out to fetch water and and he has a prayer and we find out later uh I I think somewhere in the uh verse 43 or 44 when he begins to recount this tale Amen to her family he says before I had done praying in my heart yes amen he didn't say anything out loud this was a price private prayer between him and God and I'll know the right woman amen if she picks up this silent mystery amen when I ask her for a drink of water if she says I'll give you drink and also I'll Water your camels then that's the one that you choose amen so brother Bram teaches all of this and he goes into that in great detail but let's go back to verse 15 and read here in verse 15 says and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold Rebecca came out who was born to Bethel son of milka the wife of nahor Abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder it's important to note here who this is uh like Emanuel was brother Emanuel was telling us last Wednesday amen uh this this eleazer couldn't just get a woman from anywhere she couldn't he couldn't get a Canaanite he couldn't get a perizzite he couldn't get a hivite he couldn't get a hittite he couldn't get anybody that was nearby but he had to go back to the original bloodline had to be the original Family the original bloodline and he went back and it just so happened that this Maiden who came when he prayed amen was part of the same family she was a granddaughter of Abraham's brother so she was part of the original life prise God the original bloodline and she came with her picture on her shoulder uh and I want you to catch this imagery this picture on her shoulder and the picture wasn't in her hand but the picture was on her shoulder and so I I'm I'm G to give a bit of speculation so this is Brother Chad's speculation I don't think it was an itty bitty picture like this but it was big enough that she had it up on her shoulder because it would probably been easier to carry than a bigger jug so we're not talking about a tiny picture here and he says and the servant ran to meet her and said let me I pray thee drink a little water of thy pcture and she said drink my Lord and she hasted uh I'm sorry sorry I want to go back sorry go back to verse 16 the beginning of verse 16 at the end of 15 she comes with her pitcher on her shoulder and the damel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up now look at the language she went down to the well filled her picture and came up because in that arid region back then many of the wells were actually steps leading down to a well that was sunk into the ground where they could find water and they would they didn't have you know the the the wiow and the and the rope and they lowered it down that way no they walked down into the well amen they filled their picture and they walked back up to the top amen if you go and look you can find ancient Wells and they've done some Escavating they found Wells like that and that's many times the way they were and this is the language that's used here amen it gives us that kind of imagery that she came with a picture on her shoulder amen and she went down to the well and filled her picture and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said let me I pray thee drink a little water of thy piture and she said drink my Lord and she hasted and let down her piture upon her hand and gave him a drink and when she had done giving him drink she said I will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking and she hasted and emptied her piture into the trough and ran again into the well to draw water and Drew for all his camels and the man wandered at her and held his peace to wit whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of half a shekele weight and two bracelets for her hand of 10 shekels weight of gold and said whose daughter art thou tell me I pray thee is there room in thy father's house for us to Lodge in and she said unto him I am the daughter of Bethel the son of milka which she bore unto nahor and she said moreover unto him we have both straw and prender enough and room to Lodge and the man bowed down his head and worshiped the Lord and he said blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham who ha not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth I being in the way the Lord led me to the house of my Master's Brethren so he found the destination and God had led him there by the angel of the Lord and and God had supernaturally provided amen the the witness that this is the woman but but the language here is so important and I want to catch it and and look at what it is that this woman did because it's actually an amazing feat what she did and and brother brandham tells us in desperations he said now Eleazar being a spiritual man knowed what it meant the right kind of woman had to be that man's wife and how could he choose it the hour of his desperation when he arrived at the city he prayed and said Lord God that's the thing when you get desperate go to praying Lord God let the first maid that comes forth and Waters the camel and gives me to drink be that he prayed in the hour of his desperation Rebecca the beautiful maid came watered the camel and he said don't delay me in my way she had to come to a time of decision whether she would go she was a type of the Bride would she go and marry a man who she has never seen now that's a great thing never even seen him yet she had only heard his by his servant that's a type of the Bride you've never seen Christ but you hear by his servants what he is and you'll sell out everything leave your homes everything else it takes to go find him now notice she made the decision a type of the Bride left her denominational home seat to go amen so brother B types this all out and shows us that this is elaser amen fetching a bride and and she had to come to the time of decision and that's actually what brother Emanuel was preaching on when he was talking about amen the the seed bride will be willing amen of her own choosing not coerced and not persuaded and not no fear tactics and no no church formalism that pushed her into a no but she was willing amen and she was willing but she was she was testified of Amen by the spirit of God because she could catch the mystery and act it out without anybody having to tell her and she went down into the well and came up to the man he asked for a drink she dropped a picture on her hand amen so that he could have a drink and then she said I'll Water the camels also but I I want you to look at what she said she said Verse 18 said drink my Lord and she hasted and let down her piter upon her hand and gave him drink and when she had done giving him drink she said I will draw water for the camels also until they have done drinking this is going to be important yes she said I will give them water until they're done drinking and the man steps back and watches now his prayer is the woman that Waters the camels Also let her be the one amen and and I don't know about you but I I just know my nature I probably would have been so excited when she got that first when she got that first picture of water and put it in the trough IA ran and said you're it this is but no he's watching he's watching because as brother Emanuel said the bride has to fulfill all the word amen and now he's he's watching she said till they have all drunk until they drink all and so the man's just watching Praise god let's read it verse 19 and when she had done giving him drink she said I will draw water for the camels also until they have done drinking and she hasted and emptied her picture into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water and Drew for all his camels how many camels did he have 10 Drew for all of his camels and the man wondered at her wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not he already knew she's watering the camels but he's got to wait and see if she'll go all the way and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking so the camels were done drinking she didn't decide to stop watering them she watered them till they were done drinking you've got that she didn't decide when enough was enough she didn't decide when she was too tired to keep going she watered them till they were done drinking and she and uh verse 22 and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring and a half shekele weight that's when the man begins to Adorn her and shower her and and claim her amen because now he knew this is the one he should I mean to me he knew when she first offered to water the camels but he steps back and watches and makes sure that this one will water all the camels amen I started thinking about this and I had heard heard somebody one time say that that camels drink a lot of water so I went to look it up to find out and I looked it up and it says camels can drink large amounts of water Qui quickly up to 32 gallons in a single drinking session I mean that's with one dip into the water suck up 32 gallons then it says they can also drink 53 gallons of water in 3 minutes 3 minutes 53 gallons do you know how much is in a jug of milk one gallon they can drink 53 jugs of water and 3 minutes in one session of drinking when they drop their head once to drink they can suck in 32 gallons of water now I don't know how thirsty these camels were I don't know amen the man had set him down by the well and never said he watered him before they were on a journey if these were thirsty camels they were drinking somewhere between 30 and 50 gallons of water a piece and how many were there 10 and what did that woman have to do to water 10 gam camels let's just say they took half that says they had 25 gallons I like using conservative numbers that's 250 gallons of water that they and how fast could they drink them they can drink 53 gallons in 3 minutes it's hopeless every time she fills the trough gone fills the trough gone fills the trough this woman was working and how did she get the water she went down into the well and came up how much did her picture hold maybe two gallons I don't know maybe it could hold three gallons maybe it h one gallon maybe it held four gallons how many trips did she make per camel prise God how how much listen when this man said listen when he said let her that gives me a drink and Waters the camels also he's looking for somebody that'll go all the way somebody that'll sell out somebody that can serve somebody that can give up their time and their effort and their energy for someone else amen camels can drink so much water they can survive up to 15 days without water that's just a bonus that's for the kids so you do the math and I would estimate my estimation somewhere between 250 and 500 gallons of water this woman went down into a well scooped up walked back up one picture at a time and poured it out into the trough and the man sat back and did not offer off to help her and he had servants with him who didn't offer to help her where has shivalry gone this was something she had to do to prove what was inside of her it just so happened she was of the right seedline brother bam starts to talk about this act and he speaks of it several times through the message so I'm just going to pull out a couple but in 1953 there's a message called earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he said look the very animal that she was watering the animal represents a beast of course a beast of burden which means a power in the Bible remember explains this all the time a white horse is a power and a red horse is a power and the Beast that rise out of the sea is a power and so he's he's referring this to the it's a power and the Very animal that she was watering was the very animal that packed her to see her bride is that right and what is watering the very power that we're watering now with praises and Thanksgiving and glory and power and might is the very Holy Spirit that'll pack us by uh pack us up to see Jesus someday he said the very camels she was watering amen what she was serving was the very power that was going to carry her to Isaac amen amen and and what and what what I want to look at is the way she served how did she serve it wasn't half-hearted it wasn't half effort it wasn't the minimum that she can do amen when she committed to watering the camels she committed to a Monumental task of watering the camels and she didn't stop till all the camels had done drinking amen it wasn't tempted to say okay okay okay move out of the way you've had enough you've had 20 gallons next camel she watered all the camels am until they were all done drinking my goodness this is a type of the Bride amen so what kind of character must the bride have what has to be inside of her and listen Rebecca did it not because somebody told her to she did it because something inside her told her to do it and so the very power that we are watering now with praises and Thanksgiving and glory and power and might is the very Holy Spirit that'll pack us up to see Jesus someday so he's watering it by praises and by worship and by glory and by surrender and by adoration and they're watering this this power which is the Holy Spirit and this is what he says in in in 1953 and he uses this very similar terminology all the way up till he gets the seals but when he gets the seals he changes terminology and we're going to we're going to look at that he says now in questions and answers uh from 1964 he says and Rebecca had to make the choice cuz he said she is the maid let her make the choice and as soon as it was made to her quickly her mind was made up she said I'll go and she mounted up the the camel and went to meet look the very camel she watered was the camel that packed her to her bridegroom and all of her success and the Very camel the very power that beast in the Bible presents power and the Very power that will give that will give water and pray that we give water and praise to water life praise to the word is the very thing that packs us into glory land to meet the bridegroom what is it we're watering the word amen what is it we're giving praise and glory and honor and worship to the word what is it that's going to pack us to our bridegroom the word amen and how did she water the word amen what effort did she do what extent did she go to how much was she willing and how far was she willing to go to water to word until all the word was done drinking this is the character amen that Eleazar was looking for this is what he asked for this is why he didn't help her he didn't send his men to help her amen she needed to prove what was inside of her this is what brother Emanuel it struck me when he was here last Wednesday he was saying amen you're you're not going to have to be puru persuaded you must repent you must repent amen but the bride's going to go all the way with the word when she sees the word she'll water all the word how does she water the word with her worship and her praise and her glory and her surrender she's worshiping the very power that's going to carry her all the way to her bridegroom and so how do we worship amen we don't worship half-heartedly we don't surrender and praise and worship the word with half of our hearts amen we've got to give everything to it that's the character he's looking for that's the nature of the Bride that was the only only one that would work for Isaac the promised son you think when you think about it look when I just stop and think about the request Eleazar made he's looking for a virgin a maiden a young woman not a Burly man not somebody strong and powerful he's making this request of a virgin amen a maid a young unmarried woman and what he asked is that she moves do you know listen do you know that water is approximately 8 lb per gallon 8 lb per gallon now I can't do that math in my head right now some of you can but that that's 800 lb every 100 gallons right please somebody help me 800 lb every 100 gallons and the camels in my estimation probably had at least 250 gallons to 500 gallons so you're looking at 1600 and half and 2000 2,000 lb of water a minimum she moved for those camels how did she move 2,000 lb of water with the pitcher that was on her shoulder by going down in the well and coming up and emptying into the trough I'm telling you the bride is going to be a special woman she's not going to be the denominational type she's not going to be a half-hearted Christian giving half her effort half her time half her mind half her energy half her resources that's not the kind that Christ is looking for amen there's got to be something in her that says I'll Water the camels nobody has to make me amen and I'm not going to do the bare minimum I'm going all the way praise God so now the very power brother man said that we give water and praise to what is it watering it's giving praise and worship and honor and Glory he says the very power that we give water and praise to water life praise to the word is the very thing that packs us into glory to meet the bridegroom what should the bride's attitude towards the word be in the fifth seal brother Ram says now he's in the seals and he's in the fifth seal says it also represents holy power to a beast did you know that notice Rebecca when the servant of Abraham Eleazar when he come to get Rebecca he mounted her up on a camel the very camel she watered and she rode this camel to meet her unseen bridegroom the very thing she watered was the thing that took her to her future home and husband and it's the same thing today the very thing that the church is watering that is the seed the seed of the word it's the very word that becomes alive and Carries us to our unseen bridegroom what's the very thing we're watering the seed what seed the seed of the word and as we're watering that word with our glory and our praise and our worship and our surrender amen that very word is coming to life and will carry us to our bridegroom so what is it we're watering what is the camels we're watering it's the word that's been giv to us in this hour amen it's the it's our it's our bridegroom amen the revealed word our husband this message that's been given to us this message is not the mind of a man this message is not the collection of Doctrine this message is Jesus Christ present today manifesting himself for real standing here saying this is me that's what the message is it's not 1200 tapes it's not books it's not a series of doctrines it is the person of Jesus Christ coming to reveal himself to his bride that's the word that we're worshiping that's the word that's packing us to him amen and that's why no church is going to do it it's going to take the word that's going to carry us not a church not a group not anything else it's going to be the word that carries us and the very thing that we have to water is the very thing that c carries us along the way it's the very power that we ride on brother bham says in the message Satan's Eden I heard brother Neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why didn't I preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't I do this it's amazing even brother Brenham and his own congregation was criticized for why he preached some things and didn't preach others and he didn't preach enough on this and he preached too much on that if it happened to the prophet it'll probably happen to us all he says now I heard brother Neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why didn't I preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't I do this here it is the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of fleshly evidence but it's a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age right watch the holy GH watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so much in demonstration but in action what it does according to the word what is the Holy Ghost it's the power it's the action that makes the word live it's the manifestation of the word it's the power that that that energizes and quickens the word and makes the word manifest itself in our lives Amen brother benam said over and over what was that power that she was watering it was the Holy Ghost then he says what was that power she was watering it was the word because the word is Christ amen the word is him the life of the word is the Life of Christ the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Christ and there's a life in this word and the life in this word amen as we serve it that's the power that is carrying us along praise God amen amen amen not a not a stale stagnant word that you can just read on paper and say that's the word that's not the word those are words not just a teaching that you can recite back that's that not necessarily the word that can be words but that's not the word the word is a person amen the word is Christ the word is God himself the life of God in the word amen and when you get that word you get the life amen we can have words we can recite words we can be trained to rep peep back correct Doctrine we can line up certain biblical teachings amen and you can have that as as word like word we understand in the English language amen but that doesn't mean you've yet had the person of the word because the person of the word is the life of that word that comes in and makes all that word life living life packing us carrying us moving us manifesting itself along the way amen you can't tell me that you can have the word and not have the spirit because the word is Christ you can have words you can have technical words but if you get the word you have Christ he's the life of the word he's the word that's been restored he's our bridegroom the revealed word he's our husband he's the one who's returned in this hour amen he's the one we're uniting with amen I'd like to turn the page just for a minute and go to 2 Samuel and go to another story Al together 2 Samuel 23 2 Samuel uh let's go to chapter 23 I'm going to read from verse 14 and David was then in the hold and the Garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem and David longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of The Well of Bethlehem which is by the gate and the three Mighty Men break through the host of the Philistines and Drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the Lord Brother Benham talks about this story extensively in the message why little Bethlehem from 1963 it it be good for you to listen to it because it's so fantastic the way brother B I'm going to read several quotes from that message amen if I read a quote and don't reference this it's probably from why little Bethlehem but David desired a drink and David wanted a drink see David wanted to be watered and who was David David was the Manifest word for his day he was anointed to be king for his day he was the Fulfillment of a prophecy he was a man that God had chosen after his own heart he was anointed to be the word for his day amen and he longed to be watered he wanted to have a drink but not any drink will do he didn't want any of the waters no doubt in the cave they were in the ho no doubt they had Waters and jugs and Waters and barrels amen but he wanted a certain he was thirsty for a certain kind of water he wanted the water from the well at Bethlehem he had a certain taste that could only be satisfied this water here and this warm water in this jug and this water in that City and town it won't do anything for me but the water that I'm really craving that I want to be watered by is the water Bethlehem amen the problem was Bethlehem was garrisoned about by a Garrison of Philistines it was treacherous to get to that water it was nearly impossible to get to that water but that's the water he wanted not the easy water in The Jug not just giving Eleazar a drink but the camels a drink not the easy one but the hard oneise God amen amen am said he who gives me a drink is not just serving the prophet and say I believe you're eleazer and I'll I'll give you a drink and and I'll give you respect and honor but not just elazer but the whole mess of word that he brought has to be watered too because that's the power that's carrying us home Eleazar is it carrying us home he's leading but the power is the word and now David the anointed word for his day he longs to be watered by a cool drink of fresh water from where from Bethlehem where did David come from where was David's origin where did David come from on this Earth he came from Bethlehem what kind of water did he want he wanted water from home he wanted original water he wanted water from his birthplace that's the water he wanted my goodness and brother Brenham says now the name bethlehem's means the house of God's bread now how fitting that is to Jesus the bread of eternal life Christ is the bread of life we all believe that don't we how fitting Bethlehem there and the bread center of the world was the bread Center of eternal life that's why the king had to be born there he said Bethlehem lived in a wheat rich country and it was the bread Center of of that nation of Israel amen because amen the bread of life was going to come from Bethlehem amen that's why David had to be born there because there was going to be a son of David that was going to sit on the throne amen and so David had to be born in Bethlehem the house of God's bread where is Jesus going to be born in Bethlehem the house of God's bread and brother Bram said eternal life bread turn with me to John chapter 6 John chapter 6 verse 48 John chapter 6: 48 says I am that bread of life where did he come from Bethlehem what is he the bread of life where did the bread of life come from where did the wheat come from from the wheat Center where did the bread come from the bread of life came from Bethlehem amen said I am that bread of life your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die what kind of bread is that eternal life bread you eat this bread you'll not die even the Mana that fell from heaven in the days of of The Exodus when they ate that they still died but this is eternal life bread that came from Heaven that come through Bethlehem that was now available and he said if you eat this bread you'll not die I am the living bread which cometh down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world what is the bread his flesh what is his flesh the word was made flesh what is his flesh the manifested word for the day the Living Word the manifested word that was the Flesh and he said my My Flesh I give to you is the bread of life praise God let's go down to verse 53 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him we have to eat his flesh yes remember this is the saying that confused so many and caused so many to walk out because all they saw was the natural amen they didn't realize amen when he come to the communion he said he took the bread of the communion he said this is my body which is broken For You Take and Eat amen he's showing amen that the word was made flesh and the word is what you eat the bread of life is the word amen made manifest in your day that is the bread of life amen back in why little Bethlehem brother BR said these types they can come no other way but by the word that's the only place he could be born is by that Bethlehem that's why it had to be that little humble Place why Bethlehem he had to come from Bethlehem because Bethlehem is the house of God's bread because he was the bread that came down from heaven his flesh was meat his flesh was bread we had to eat his flesh what was his flesh the word made manifest in his day the word fleshed out in his day again he says I challenge some man some Warrior who loves Jesus Christ that knows that these things has got to be fulfilled today Brethren come stand by my side and pull that word of God what do you mean by pull the word of God cuz what is the sword is the sword of the spirit which is the word of God so pull that word of God forget those dried sisters and stagnant denominations you're living in pull the fresh word of God let's give Jesus a good drink of fresh Pentecost hostile water that's his desire today Hey listen uh I want you to pay attention to this quote I don't want to go too fast because I'm already getting way ahead of myself amen but he's saying pull the word we got to cut our way we going to cut our way through all of these things to get back to where back to the original Source back to the original life-giving stream of Life Water of Life well of Living Water we got to go back to the birthplace back to the original and where was Jesus born from he was born from the word he was the word made manifest he was the prophecies Made Alive he was the word standing there amen where do you have to go back to you got to go back to the word to get this water back to the original source of life he said pull that fresh word of God let's give Jesus Jesus wants a drink he wants to be watered David wanted to be watered what was David the word made manifest in his day he wanted to be watered watered Jesus wants to be watered he wants a drink let's give Jesus a good drink of fresh Pentecostal water he's going to describe what Pentecostal water is because it's not Pentecostalism it's not this modern day he's going all the way back to the beginning let's give Jesus a good drink of fresh Pentecostal water that's his desire today back to original Pentecost back to the word that's the drink that he wants that's the Pentecost that he wants that's the experience he's looking for that's the life of the word he wants back to when the word became alive in a people back to when the Holy Ghost came in and quickened the prophecy in a people and Christ the spirit of the word came to life and they became the Manifest word for their day let's go back that's the drink that he's looking for back to Pentecost back to the word said it's prophesied we'll do so in Malachi the 4th chapter return the faith of the children back to the fathers again who would stand this morning man let's go to John chapter 4 just skip over just a couple chapters to the beginning of John chapter 4 John chapter 4:7 we all know this portion of scripture we probably haven't memorized as the woman at the well in Samaria but in verse 7 it says there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus say unto her give me to drink he wants a drink he wants to be watered he wants a drink and the woman says but how can you ask me a Samaritan how can we mix this up and how can we get a drink and Jesus has an answer he's looking for a drink but he's looking for a different drink than what she's thinking he says give me to drink so he starts the dialogue let's go down to verse 13 and Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water he's pointing at Jacob's Well whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life oh praise God Jesus is saying he's come to a well once again he's come to a well when he's at the well he comes to a predestined at seed he's there waiting for a predestinated seed when she comes to that predestinated seed the manifested word says give me a drink I want a drink will you give me a drink why cuz Eleazar said I want a drink amen cuz David said I want to drink and Jesus stands and says I want a drink and she says how this isn't customary how can I do it and he said you if you knew who were speaking to you you would ask me of a drink and I'd give you Waters that you thirst no more and she said how are you going to do this the D is deep you have nothing to draw with and he says now then is when we get into this and he says whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst again what is this water amen this is the water of life amen this is the water the original water the Water of Life the water of the word the water that you'll never thirst again because Jesus was the Fountain of eternal life he was the well that she needed to drink from he was the original he was the word he was from from the beginning he was the logos made flesh he was the Fountain of Living Waters and he said if you come and drink through if you fight your way through your own understanding you fight your way through your own condition if you move your way beyond what you're thinking and your condition your Samaritan ways and you come and drink of this water you'll never thirst again cuz it's lifegiving Eternal water from the original Source but she had to move past her traditional thinking she had to move past her religion of the day and she had to recognize who was there he said who whosoever drink of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him am a well of water springing up into everlasting life verse 23 when she finally comes to the realization of who the this is she says but the hour cometh and now is she asked the question where are we going to worship and how are we going to worship God and this is his answer the hour cometh verse 23 and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him what's he saying the father wants a drink amen he wants to be refreshed how are you going to refresh him the only thing that will refresh him is when you come with spirit and Truth he wants to he wants to be worshiped the father's seeking those that will worship Him how do you water how does she water the camels it was in praise and in worship and glory and surrender and admiration that's worship and the father seeking such to worship Him in spirit and Truth he wants a drink but any water is not going to do he wants to be watered he said God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen elazer wanted a drink David wanted a drink Jesus wanted a drink the father wants a drink prise God this is what brother brenham's breaking into in this message why little Bethlehem said when David wanted a drink all they wanted to do was give him a drink amen all that they desired to do was to serve him in the way he wanted back in the message why little Bethlehem he says oh you Bethlehem dwellers Hallelujah I call for men Warriors who's not afraid I don't care if there's 800 standing on one side and 10,000 on the other I want Warriors who will come with me and cut a hole through this line of unbelieving Philistines the World Council has got garrisoned around the word of God trying to make it Creeds and feed the people there's a well there's a fountain open in the House of David Bethlehem for sin and uncleanness brothers sin is unbelief in the word brother bam goes right back to a prophecy that's in Zechariah and he quotes that prophecy in Zechariah and the prophecy in Zechariah 131 says in that day there shall be a fountain open to the House of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and cleanness there was a fountain open and brother Brenham said there's a fountain open today in this age a fountain to wash us from sin and uncleanness and sin is unbelief unbelief in what unbelief in the word how do we get an unbelief in the word by denominational systems and Creed and dogmas but there's a fountain available where back in Bethlehem back in the house of God's bread back in the birthplace of Christ the word where is it it's in the word amen amen but to get there you got to cut through Creeds and you got to cut through traditions and you got to cut through your own selfish desires you got to cut through the garrisons that are garrisoned around this well and you've got to sacrifice your own life amen to cut your way in not not not to serve yourself but to serve the word made flesh for today they were serving the king they weren't in there drinking that water for themselves they cut their way through to get him a drink he desired a cool drink he wanted to be refreshed he was looking for somebody to Worship in spirit and in truth God Almighty there's a fountain open in the House of David for sin and uncleanness I'm telling you there's a fountain open today yes amen there's been Christ has been here today to tell us I want to drink but I want to drink by the Well from from where I came from amen from my birthplace from my origin from the house of God's bread where the seed is that's what I that's the water that I'm hungry for that's the water that'll quench my thirst that water that's springing up from the Fountain of everlasting life outside the Gate of Bethlehem where do you have to go to get this water back to Bethlehem back to the birthplace back to the origin it's the only water that will quench his thirst David didn't ask anybody to go get him a drink he did the same thing Eleazar did he never he never asked would somebody please go get me a drink would somebody all he did was make his desire known all he did was say oh oh that I could drink of the Waters of of of the well by the gate of Bethlehem that's all he did but there had to be somebody to catch the unspoken part there had to be somebody to catch somebody had to catch the mystery somebody had to understand what is he asking for what does he want and somebody has to say oh well it's too hard to get to oh well I don't think that I it's too challenging it'll cost me too much there's danger for me there's danger for my family and what if I'm deceived and what if I get caught in a trap and what if I don't make it back but there was somebody there that said if you the word made manifest wants a drink then I'm going to get you a drink if I have to Hazard my life I will get you a drink if I have to cut through Philistines I will get you a drink is there somebody today that'll give him a drink he wants to be watered who's going to water who's going to catch the mystery he wants somebody to go all the way further down in the in this same quote he says who Warrior that can see the Millennium coming he's speaking to the Warriors amen what what Warrior can see this great Holy Spirit come in the form of Jesus Christ the literal Body of Christ to take over again stand with me stand by me let's cut a hole through this denominational Creed let's get in there he's crying for a good fresh drink of Pentecostal Water original Pentecost not a bunch of carrying on screaming hollering here I mean a genuine Holy Spirit baptism that produces the life of Jesus Christ back into the person what is the drink that he wants listen he's not asking you Amen to go dip a literal Cup in something or come to him and hand him a message book what he wants is the original Pentecostal Waters where somebody cuts their way through tradition and everything and comes to the life of the word and the life of the word comes in them and that's the drink that he wants he wants to drink the life from you he wants to be refreshed by you worshiping in spirit and in truth listen we get so many wrong ideas about worship we think worship is only singing worship means to bow down and surrender in humiliation amen what is he looking for somebody amen that'll worship Him in spirit into truth somebody that'll sacrifice their life that'll go all the way that'll bow down and give up their life and sacrifice themselves to give him what he desires it wasn't what the three wanted it's what God wanted it's what David wanted it's what Christ wants and there's a people on Earth that have caught it they've caught it amen there's some that just caught oh David is wanting a drink there's no way he wants us to dress this way we've got to go to church twice a week we've got to those are people who look beyond all of that and said he's not asking he's not he's not asking me to go do this what he's telling me is he wants a drink of cool water he wants the word made flesh alive flowing out of me Jesus come to the woman at the well and said give me a drink she had nothing to give him that to satisfy his thirst until first she cut her way through to the living well that was standing there and when she drank of the Fountain of Living Water the word made manifest in her day all of a sudden it was springing up in her a well of Living Water now she could give him a drink amen now she could water him now she could satisfy his thirst that's what he's hungering for today friends he wants somebody that'll live this word that'll sell out that'll surrender their lives that'll take all the word and give the spirit control and say take me take me not holding back not halfway watering not doing the job partially and saying that's good enough you can do that if you want that's fine there's no problem nobody's asking you nobody listen nobody's asking you nobody's asking you to follow all the rules you can break them all no nobody's asking you nobody's chasing you down peeping through your window making sure you don't wear the wrong clothes at home and listen to the wrong music nobody's asking Christ is just saying who's going to water the camels Christ is just saying oh I'd like to drink of that original water that they had back at Pentecost amen and he he's just he didn't say you have to do this and you have all he's saying is I want that original water back in Bethlehem from the word and the fountain is open and there it is amen and he didn't say go get it he didn't say you three you do this and you do take your sword no they took it upon themselves and said if that's what you want that's what I want you to have praise be to God Jesus comes to the great feast on the last day of the feast you know what the feast is the great day of the last Feast it's the seventh Feast the lead Dean Church age you know what he did on the great day of the feast the great day of the feast brother Bram said is the Eighth Day at the end of the denominational ages at the end of the Pentecostal age he comes he comes on the scene and he stands and said if is anybody thirsty let him come unto me and drink there's a fountain open in the House of David for Bethlehem dwellers you can come back to the original wellow and get a drink and then he goes on to say if any man thirst let him come to me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living waterall this he spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive amen so he says if anybody's thirsty come to me and drink you know to get there we we got to cut through all kinds of stuff we're going to have to take the word and we're going to have to cut through our own fear our own Traditions our own self-preservation our own religious understanding we're going to have to cut through our past and the way we were raised as kids and the complexes we have amen why because he's looking for somebody that will surrender their life and sacrifice their life to get that drink Lord to get to that well but when you get to that well now out of you shall flow rivers of Living Water what is it now you have the drink that he wants he wants the water from the original well where do you get that water when you drink of that water when you cut through and get it you become the well and out of you flows rivers of Living Water and now you can satisfy the thirsting of Our Lord amen because God the father is looking for those to worship him in spirit and in truth praise be to God brother benam says stand you Gallant man who seen David standing y Yonder Jesus Christ a fugitive from his own church where do we find him in the leoan church age a fugitive in his own church outside knocking that's where David was amen he was the king he was anointed the king called of the Prophet to be a king and he called of God to be a king and anointed the prophet he was the king but he was the rejected King amen Jesus Christ came in this end time through a prophetic Ministry and he is the king he is MDC he is the Lord Of Glory and he is the rejected King put on the outside of the church but we must go to him beyond the camp fight our way outside the walls Hazard and risk the safety to go to him praise God says Gallant man who sees David standing

of Living Water and then I become a well of Living Water amen and we're watering the power that's taking us there brother B said why little Bethlehem he said there shall come forth a ruler out of Bethlehem that shall rule over my people the Holy Spirit today rules over the people and the Holy Spirit is the word it's the living word for our day and again it says why little Bethlehem he said oh men of God where's the sword our Lord desires a fresh drink I don't care if it's life or death let's cut through this thing it's so hard standing by yourself I'm calling for men to Stand By Me stand

threeness and back to Presbyterian Lutheran ye abide in me and he is the word my word abide in you don't be afraid of 800 or 8 million I'll Stand By Your Side I desire to drink from that well again oh praise God he wants to drink from the original well the faith of the Pentecostal fathers what is that the word made flesh flesh in a many membered body that's the drink he wants friends what drink can I give him listen it's not just saying words and saying words people can say words but he wants a true worship a surrender a bowing down a serving and a giving all he wants worship worship means to bow down bow to what to the word to serve the word to surrender to the word to sacrifice for the word that's what Rebecca could doise and that's what those three Mighty Men of David could do they could sacrifice for The Living Word amise God he said I desire to drink from that well again he wants to drink from your life he wants a drink that's flowing out from you he wants the purity of The Word Alive in you and I that's the drink that quenches his thirst he wants to see himself reflected in us he wants to see his word made manifest he wants to see his word alive not because you have to go get him a drink you know these three Warriors weren't the only Warriors there were other Warriors I don't know how many heard him long for a drink of cold water these three when they heard his longing amen it triggered a longing in them when they heard what he wanted then all of a sudden there was a wanting in them they wanted to give him what he wanted they loved him they wanted to serve him they wanted to please him they wanted him to have the other Mighty Men didn't lose their position as mighty men the other Mighty Men weren't kicked out from being mighty men if all you want to do is be saved you can be saved amen but he's looking for a bride amen if all you want to do is be part of the message you can stay part of the message but he's looking for someplace for the message to live to come alive to be alive man if all you want is salvation you can have salvation amen but what he wants is somebody that'll hear what he wants and not stay in the camp and play it safe and I'll just be one of his mighty men amen he wants somebody to says if it kills me he's going to have water if it takes my life he's going to have what he's longing for if he wants me Amen to Manifest this word if it crushes me if it kills me if it causes me to lose all of my friends if I lose my reputation he's going to have this vessel for him to manifest his word through if I have to deny myself every moment of the day he's going to have a drink of cool Pentecostal water amen those were the three I want to be one of the three I you know when those three took off I don't think they had a plan garrisoned about by Philistines and there's three of them I don't know how many's in the Garrison I don't know numbers but I mean this isn't a dozen I don't think they had a plan I don't think they I think they just went God took care of them because their desire was right said I don't know how we're going to make the next step friends I don't know how we're going to get from here to the next place we need I have no idea how we're going to conquer I don't have no idea we're going to overcome the challenges I have no idea but I know this if he wants to drink from my life if he wants to drink his life out of my life then I want him to have that drink amen if it brings persecution if it brings rejection if it brings misunderstanding I want him to have a drink out of this fountain brother R goes on and why little Bethlehem he says I've never been against the men in them organizations I'm against that system that's barring the word of God out let's cut Warriors stand by us let's go into that well he's our Bethlehem he's our Bethlehem he's the house of God's bread listen what is he he's Bethlehem he's the bread he's the well he's the water he's the word he's the sword that's right am what is the water that we come and drink him his life what is the water that comes out of him him his life it's all him let's go into that well he is our Bethlehem these old sisters the World Council of churches organizing now let's restore the fresh word of God not a denomination let's not take a Creed that's old stagnant sisters that's fell 40 years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago or either last year I want God's word that's promised for today that's the drink he wants me to have this word today what is the fountain he wants me to drink from the word for today what's the fountain that'll give me everlasting life Everlasting water springing up into me at everlasting life that's the word he says I want God's word that's promised for today that's the message friends I want God's word that's promised for today that's the drink he wants me to have this word today amen come come to me in the great day of the seventh Feast the eth day come unto me if anybody's thirst and drink and out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water what will that be that old Pentecostal blessing he wants to drink from that's what he desires today to go back when a life was surrendered go back when the word was made manifest go back before they wanted their own way before they wanted their own understanding before let's go back to where they were willing to sell out everything let's go back to where they were willing to be chased from home to home and they gave all their goods and threw it in the pot let's go back to a full surrender let's go back to getting 2,000 of water for the word let's go back to not doing what we have to do not doing what we're told to do but recognizing what he wants and giving all to give him what he wants that's go that's the Pentecostal water he wants to drink back to the faith of the original fathers let's go back to second Samuel I want to close with this this scripture 2 Samuel 23 musicians if you'd like to make your way up please do so brother Blake if you'll come second Samuel 23:16 to17 and the three Mighty Men break through the host of the Philistines and Drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the Lord he said be it far from me oh Lord that I should do this is not this the blood blood of the men that went in Jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three Mighty Men when they came back that water was so precious that David couldn't drink it because that water that water became the blood of those three men that gave their life that jeopardized and Hazard their life for this w water and David saw this water as equal to their blood and it was so sacred and so holy because they they offered their blood for this water that he couldn't drink it he poured it out unto the Lord amen he poured it out as a drink offering to who Hallelujah a drink offering to the Lord amen he watered the Lord with what the lives of these three predestinated seeds I want to give a drink offering to the Lord and I want it to be precious and sacred and so holy no man could drink from it what is that offering it's when I give my blood my the blood represents the life in the Old Testament the blood represents the life I want to give my life Hazard my life life give up my life risk my life sacrifice my life so I can get to that original water at Bethlehem so that I can bring that water in me back to him so that that water becomes so sacred the only one that can receive that drink offering is the Lord himself may my life be poured out as an offering to my Lord he wants a drink friends you don't have to you can go to heaven if all you want to do to go to heaven you can go to heaven but if you want to be the bride you better start dipping water start giving up sacrificing start watering the camel because that's the power that's going to carry us there if if we want to be the bride if we want to be the elected not that we have to you don't have to listen Rebecca didn't have to and those three Mighty Men didn't have to they wanted to and I'm not even telling you this so that you go to a bitter Works program and you give up whatever entertainment you were doing and then force yourself to read the message instead of watching YouTube amen that's just your own efforts that'll amount to nothing it's got to go deeper than that it's got to be a pouring out our life a surrendering our life because we want to not because we have to not because the church is pushing me into it not because this is the standard of the people I'm around not for acceptance amongst a group of Believers not so that I can look like I'm in the message that amounts to nothing friends at the end of the day that's all for you who's going to give him a drink offering who's going to sacrifice for him who's going to give up their own ideas about this message I don't want my ideas about this message I want the purity of the word who will sacrifice themselves and so that that drink offering becomes equivalent to our life that's the only sacrifice worth giving back to the Lord is when this water is equivalent to our life when we've sacrificed surrendered given all because we wanted to I don't know about you I don't know if I'll ever be as good as those three I don't know if I'll ever be as quick on the trigger I don't know if I'll ever respond as fast I don't know if I'll I'll be as brave but I want to be I want to be like I don't know that I can endure and what Rebecca endured to get over 2,000 lbs of water I don't know that I wouldn't be tempted to quit or say that's good enough or look there's still a little water in the trough and Chase the camels away and I don't know I still have a human side friends I still have a carnal nature I'm fighting with but what I want from the bottom of my heart is water till all the camels are done drinking and if it's 2,000 lb of water if it's 4,000 lbs of water I want to keep pouring out my life surrendering my energy giving my time till all the word is fulfilled till all the word is satisfied I want to Hazard my life and risk my life and risk my safety risk my security risk my future so that our David The Fugitive King in this church age can have the drink of the original water from the well at Bethlehem there's a fountain open we know where it's at the question is will we cut through the Garrison of Philistines to get him that water I believe the bride will I know she will she's predestinated to it's his life in her it's his will in her it's his predestinated plan it's the word in her fulfilling the word for the hour she's going to cut through her own desire she's going to cut through her own thinking her own preferences her own way she likes things to be cut through her own tradition her own family history her own church history she she is she's going to cut through her own desire she's going to cut
