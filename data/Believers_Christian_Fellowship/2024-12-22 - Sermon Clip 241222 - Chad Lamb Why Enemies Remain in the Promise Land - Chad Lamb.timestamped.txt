[0:00] I hope that you understand this friends
[0:01] when you resist the devil amen and you
[0:04] take the word and you believe the word
[0:06] and you don't get Deliverance right away
[0:07] and it doesn't look like it's working
[0:09] amen God's not God's not upset at you
[0:12] because it didn't
[0:15] work because you can't do anything
[0:18] without him
[0:20] anyways amen failing is not the problem
[0:23] it's when we stop trying that's the
[0:26] problem when we stop believing when we
[0:28] stop pushing when we stop fighting
[0:30] that's the
[0:32] problem when we put it under tribute
[0:34] that's why he was angry and when they
[0:36] put him under tribute he says now I'll
[0:37] not drive them out but they'll remain
[0:38] and be thorns in your flesh and then we
[0:41] go a little further in Judges chapter 2
[0:43] and look what he says now Judges chapter
[0:45] 2 verse
[0:48] 20 and the anger of the Lord was hot
[0:50] against Israel and he said because that
[0:53] this people hath transgressed my
[0:54] Covenant which I commanded their fathers
[0:57] and have not hearkened into my voice I
[0:59] also will not henceforth drive out any
[1:01] from from before them of the Nations
[1:03] which Joshua left when he died that that
[1:06] through them I may prove Israel whether
[1:10] they will keep my way of the Lord to
[1:12] walk therein as their fathers did or
[1:15] not therefore the Lord left those
[1:17] Nations without driving them out hastily
[1:20] neither delivering he them into the hand
[1:23] of
[1:24] Joshua he left
[1:27] them but he left them for a purpose
[1:31] he left them so that he could prove
[1:34] Israel and then if you look at that last
[1:36] verse again he said therefore the Lord
[1:39] left those Nations without driving them
[1:41] out
[1:43] hastily oh there's some hope in the word
[1:47] hastily that doesn't mean he'll never
[1:49] drive them out he just not going to
[1:52] drive them out hastily because now he's
[1:55] going to use them to prove Israel now
[1:57] there's a purpose in them staying there
[1:59] and when they fulfilled their purpose
[2:01] they'll be driven out amen and we know
[2:04] under the ministry of Solomon they were
[2:06] they were driven out under the son of
[2:08] David Ministry amen he never said it was
[2:10] going to be there forever he said now
[2:12] I'm not going to drive them out I'm not
[2:13] going to drive them out
[2:17] hastily oh praise God if you give a
[2:19] child of God one Speck of Hope and Faith
[2:22] he's going to hold on to that amen he's
[2:24] going to say did you read the word
[2:25] hastily everybody else will say he said
[2:27] he's not going to drive them out he
[2:28] won't drive them out he won't drive them
[2:30] out but you get somebody with faith
[2:32] planted down in their soul they'll look
[2:34] at a little word called hastily and said
[2:36] hey praise God he said
[2:39] hastily that's the difference between a
[2:41] Believer and an unbeliever an unbeliever
[2:43] will look for the excuse to disbelieve
[2:45] the believer will look for the excuse to
[2:47] believe they'll look for the fraction
[2:49] the word they'll look for an exclamation
[2:51] point they'll look for a comma in a
[2:53] certain spot they're looking for a
[2:55] reason to trust God they're looking for
[2:57] a reason to believe the unbeliever is
[2:59] looking for a reason not to believe and
[3:01] God gives them plenty of
[3:06] reasons then you start adding up words
[3:09] and quotes and scriptures and he says he
[3:12] says don't remove won't remove allow to
[3:15] remain he said that four times in the
[3:16] Book of Judges but the believer says but
[3:19] he said hastily
[3:21] once and all I need is once amen you
[3:24] have four times it will not remove I
[3:26] have one time of hastily and I believe
[3:28] he's going to remove this enemy day amen
