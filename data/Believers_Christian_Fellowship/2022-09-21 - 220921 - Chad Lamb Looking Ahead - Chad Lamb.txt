current condition to sing your praise is lord let us be found faithful doing so we ask that you would take this word lord and plant it deep into our hearts now that you would take control and you

return to you a life of service lord with joy we ask that you would bless us this evening as we look to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen i'd like to start off by making another very exciting announcement if uh brother franco you could pull up to powerpoint we've got a new baby born into the assembly uh brother jack and sister emily sanders have a new baby julia celeste sanders born this morning at about 1 30 this morning so she's a fresh one amen i was i was so excited that's three baby announcements in less than two weeks that's a blessing amen i don't know that we've ever had that but it's been a blessing amen i also want to welcome back brother kyle god bless you for the calm brother wesley are back from idaho god bless you guys it's good to have you back amen while we're standing let's turn to luke chapter nine also before we read that i want to give you the results from sunday we had the vote to add to two additional uh deacons and they were both approved by the congregation brother jonathan baumgartner had a 95 percent yes vote and brother ilya luzonov had 91 approval so we thank god we thank god for the congregation and for their support and we just pray that god will bless them mightily and inspire them anoint them and use them as they serve this local body amen let's look at luke chapter 9 verse 62. luke 9 and 62 and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god amen you may have your seats so what a statement no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god amen and i want to preach a message this evening titled looking ahead it's just something god's been stirring on my heart a simple thought but i want to talk about looking ahead there's so many places to look amen there's so many distractions in the world today amen but i think the best place to look is to look ahead amen let's turn to philippians chapter 3. philippians chapter 3 and verse 13. brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth in those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus i love the fact that the apostle paul says these words because we hold apostle paul in such high regard and he was the one who had private revelation from jesus christ himself he was the he was the one who was responsible for delivering the message of grace amen to bring them from the law and to grace he was the one who was responsible for establishing the new testament church and writing almost all the new testament amen and so this is a man who had tremendous revelation he was the first church age messenger a prophet of god amen he was he was bringing the them out of the the law into the dispensation of grace it was just a powerful powerful uh ministry and all that goes with it with tremendous revelation and the apostle paul can say i'm still pressing on amen i'm still reaching forward amen forgetting those things are behind i'm reaching forward to those things that are ahead and here we are amen when the word has been restored back to paul's gospel and the seals have been open and we've been given so much amen i want to still have the attitude that i'm reaching forth amen i want to be reaching for more if there's more of christ to have i want more of christ amen i'm so thankful for what i have but i don't ever want to be satisfied just what i've had yesterday if there's more available i want the more amen and to think that we've come to the end of revelation is is is is funny god will be unfolding himself throughout eternity amen we're talking about god almighty and we've come to the end of god there's no way we've come to the end of god and all that's been given us the revelation that's been given the the personal revelation that we've received amen is is you know i don't know how to measure how far we've come and how far we have left to go i mean i was talking to some brothers and sisters the other day and i was i was using the analogy amen if if i go from a four-year-old to a five-year-old to no schooling at all and then now i'm graduating kindergarten all right i know so much more coming out of kindergarten than i did before i went in like the level of my understanding the knowledge i've gained the instruction i received i mean i'm light years ahead of where i was but in comparison to where i need to be to graduate in 11 years i haven't even scratched the surface amen and i'm wondering if this life isn't maybe something like that amen we've come to the message we've gotten so much but how much more is there to attain in the things of god how much more of god is there to discover how much more of the message is still waiting to be unveiled amen how much is laying in our books and our tapes how much is in our bible i mean that we haven't even gained an understanding of yet and i say lord help me to be reaching forward amen help me to be constantly saying god i want to see you more clearly than i've seen you before i want to know you better i want to have a deeper relationship with you i want to have more intimacy and a greater understanding a greater vision all the time so i want to be looking ahead amen not relying on what's happened in the past what's happened in the past is wonderful but what's happened in the past is my encouragement to keep pressing forward brother bam gives this story he tells it in several places but i picked it up here in in 1954 god's preparation said it's just like one time one of my managers mr baxter said he was in canada and there was a prize given for anybody who could ride a four inch board a half a city block on a bicycle and they got all the experts down they had one little old boy there and all of them thought he was a really a and all those expert riders who could go downtown and get a box of groceries on their arms and ride back and never touch their handlebars they was going to win this new ivor johnson bicycle and said mr baxter said he got on and went about 20 feet and fell off all the rest of them tried it and this little boy jumped on there and just rode right straight out to the end without a bit of trouble so all the boys got around and said what how did you do it well what caused you to do it he said i'll tell you where you boys what you boys was doing he said you were looking down like this trying to keep on it said i watched the end i watched the end what it was at the end i just kept looking at the end and i held steady and went on through but if you're looking down like this you're wondering and each each little teeter while you pushed over like that and you fall off that's the way christians do brother i'm looking at the end down yonder yes sir somebody might say well branham's a spiritualist he's a witch he's a hypocrite that don't hurt me i'm looking at the end down yonder there's where it's going and i'm writing for dear life because there's a prize of life i want to meet him down there at the end as paul said at the end i fought a good fight i finished the course i kept the faith henceforth there was laid up for me a crown of righteousness the lord the righteous judge will give me at that day not only me but all those who love his appearing so he tells this story in several places but brother brahma said this is he's typing it with what christians do amen we we get so fixated on on things that are going on now amen looking down and making sure uh everything's right and it's so easy to get diverted and so easy to get distracted and easy to fall off but he said the solution is just to look to the goal amen just to look to the end and keep moving towards the end amen not fixating on where we are and not being so uh uh so so absorbed amen in what's going on right below our feet but get absorbed in where we're walking to and if we're pointed in the right direction we're going to make it to the right spot amen we can become so distracted amen with the things that are going on in our everyday life that we could easily get ourselves off course without even knowing it and teeter and fall off because we've become distracted by all the details of what's going on today and trying to navigate amen and today without focusing on where we're going and many times the solution today's problem is readdress what's the goal amen where's what am i aiming for what is my goal what is my direction and if i'll just refocus my goal it'll take care of today's problems amen there's so many times that i find myself over-corrected or under-corrected or whatever because you face an issue and you begin to fixate on whatever it is that's going on and then the issue at hand becomes the biggest distraction in life and you think shouldn't i pay attention if we have an issue if it's a spiritual issue a family issue a church issue shouldn't we pay attention to it yeah we should pay attention to it but many times amen it just becomes a greater distraction amen and and it's not we're many times we're not going to fix the problem by fixating on it how many times have we uh uh fixated on an issue that we're facing and and spent all of our energy and got completely absorbed and studying and analyzing and and and trying to figure out if this happens that will happen and if that goes then maybe this will happen and if i go a little here i'll correct a little here and it never works the way we think it's going to work but we've absorbed all of our time and all of our energy fixating on the issue when what we might need to do in the face of trouble is rise our eyes a little higher amen and find out where christ is and just make it towards him amen just keep pressing forward amen because the solution many times is in forward progress hebrews chapter 12. let's turn there together hebrews chapter 12 verse 1. wherefore seeing we also are compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god so there's a certain laying aside every weight and forgetting it all and running with patience the race that is set before us to keep moving not start and stop start and stop start and stop but to keep moving you you know the story of the tortoise and the hair right the the the tortoise isn't the best runner the tortoise has no chance of beating the hair the hair is so much faster but the hair is overly self-confident and the hair has this problem of wanting to stop and take a break and rest and all that but the tortoise all the tortoise does is keep putting one foot in front of the other and one foot in for the other it's not flashly it's not stylish amen i mean nobody makes action videos of the tortoise and is running i mean this isn't a highlight reel he does the same thing over and over and over but no matter how many times you read that story the tortoise always wins amen and i wonder how many times we tried to be flashy chris christians and big this and big that this gift and this stylish thing and what what we need to do is trust god and just keep putting one foot in front of the other amen keep our eyes focused on the prize not starting and starting and stopping and starting but just continually moving amen towards the goal amen in that goal amen is jesus christ amen to become just like him that's what this message is this message is christ amen the goal is christ the goal is union with christ in christ living in you and i and so not starting and stopping and i ran good for a while and then i stopped for a while and i ran good for a while and i stopped for a while amen there's too many christians like that and and it can look good for a while because while we're running i mean we're witnessing to all kinds of people and talking about the message and i read this and i read that but then all of a sudden they took a break from being a believer for a little while and the tortoise the tortoise doesn't have i mean he doesn't have what the hair has he may not have amen the the the knowledge that the hair has he may not be able to quote things right off like that but he's got one thing for sure he knows the goal and he knows how to get to the goal and he never stops moving towards the end i say praise god for faithfulness we want to be found faithful now jesus it says endured the cross so we need to look unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who it says for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and set down the right hand of the throne of god and so i found this encouraging to me for the joy that lay before him jesus had to fixate on a goal he had to look to the goal and the goal it was beyond calvary amen the goal was for the glory that lay ahead but he must endure the cross despising the shame which means that jesus christ he wasn't looking forward to calvary in the flesh he was actually despising the shame despising the mockery of the whole event it didn't he didn't have to like it or enjoy it but he was willing to endure it because he saw a prize beyond the trial and the prize beyond the trial made it worth walking into the trial [Music] you know he's he said when he comes to gethsemane and gethsemane he's wrestling this out because it's not something that's easy it's not something that he would enjoy it's not something that's pleasant so the wrestling of our lord in gethsemane was a genuine wrestling he was wrestling with his own flesh to bring that flesh subject to the will and word of god but what gave him the grace to move forward for the glory that lay ahead he endured the cross despising the shame and there are some things in life that aren't easy is that right not all of life is pleasant not all of life is easy not all not every part of serving the lord is easy there are some difficulties that lay in there but but can we have a prize in our eyes that makes every obstacle worth the enduring that makes every trial rejection heartache disappointment it's all worth it because i'm not living for the pleasure that i get in this life i'm living for another pleasure that'll come in another life listen the greatest times that we can have on this earth pale in comparison to what's coming the most pleasurable time of our life here the most satisfying event we ever participated in it can't even compare to what is coming amen what is coming is so much greater than what we have amen so so we need to to me this is just where god's dealing with me is i want to start putting my my eyes above this earth and beyond this life and stop being disappointed when life is disappointing but to expect life to be disappointing because i'm not living for this life i'm living for the one that's coming and now my investments my heart my desire all the prize that i want is coming ahead not here i'm not looking for this to become pleasurable my pleasure lays ahead because if we're still trying to make this earth our millennium we're going to be disappointed all the time constantly we're going to be discouraged and disappointed because we will never get this life to work out perfect all the time in fact it's full of it's full of destruction it's full of perversion it's full of corruption it's full of error amen it's full of filth it's full of ungodliness amen and it's not going to get better it's only going to get worse amen it's not going to be a more conducive place for a christian to live it's going to get worse amen so why are we spending all of our time amen trying to make this our little paradise instead of forgetting about this and focusing on the real paradise and moving forward in the gospel moving forward with the message amen and moving forward in revelation and saying god amen it's not this i'm living for it's that that i'm living for praise god we had an event take place at our house sunday that was interesting we got up in the morning got ready i was getting ready to come and preach and just before i left the house the water started rising and the toilets and the bathtubs and all over and i realized we have a something wrong with the plumbing and it was rising and coming up and there was a threat of it spilling over and and all of a sudden but i gotta come preach you know what can you do and so i came on the church i said don't don't use the water don't do anything i'll look at it when i get back so i come to church and and then while i'm in the back getting ready just a little bit before i come out maybe 20 or 30 minutes i get a call from my wife and she says just after you left and then something happened and it started coming out of the toilet like a fountain you know and flowing over and getting on the floor and getting everywhere and i'm in the back getting ready to preach my house is flooding with backed up sewer water and i said oh god you gave me the house if it falls to ruin you'll fix it what can i do anyways because i'm not living for a house i mean i don't want a house you know flooded with sewage like nobody else wants that that's not what i'm looking for out of life that's not my desire amen and thankfully blake was able to run over there and david stayed home and they worked and they got things taken care of so we owe them a lot you know but god provided all i could do was turn that switch off because i got something more important to do it's the word of god it's more important than a house it's more important than backed up plumbing it's more god will have to take care of that because the things of this word are more important than the temporal things of life and god blessed us he took care of us everything got cleaned up everything's fine everything's all right amen but it's just one of those other tests in life and i'll tell you if anything's going to go wrong for me it's generally going to go wrong on a wednesday afternoon or a sunday morning and then you wonder why i mean why it's almost like god don't you know i'm supposed to be preaching but you know we got to become disconnected with the things of life and say god god gave me a house if i lose the house god will give me another house if something goes wrong god will take care of it i'm living for him and he'll take care of me as i live for him but my greatest desire is not a beautiful house the greatest desire in my life is not to have everything perfect the greatest desire in my life is to please him and walk pleasing to the lord to serve him and keep moving in this plan that he has for our life and so we get these little opportunities to find out what we really believe and that's all they are they're just tests that's all they are they're only tests they're not they're not punishments they're not god you know it's not it's not anything other than just a test to find out so that you can see where you're at amen and these things are good for us so we can find out where you're at amen if you you got a call tomorrow that from the bank that says oh there's been fraud somebody broke into your account and they wiped out your savings account for me i would chuckle because that's not a big deal anyways but for some others it might be a big deal amen but but what would we do amen would we lose our minds will we go crazy will we say i mean how am i going to survive amen you're going to survive the same way you would survive before amen because god has promised to take care of us he's promised to watch over us we need to get our eyes back on the prize and just keep moving forward and let god take care of what god's going to take care of if it comes it comes if it goes it goes that's just the way it is but i'm not here for that i'm here to serve god we need to be looking ahead let's go to luke 21. luke chapter 21 i'd like to begin reading at verse 25 and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken well you know men's hearts are failing for fear because of thing the things that are coming upon the earth but i hope our hearts aren't failing for fear because of the things that are happening in the earth he goes on to say in verse 27 then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory praise god and then these things begin to come to pass and look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh when you see the world falling apart amen and you've seen the sign of his coming amen look up and rejoice for your redemption draw with nigh amen this is not the time to lose heart amen every news broadcast being worse than the one before is good news not bad news amen our redemption draweth nigh amen we have seen his sign the sign of the son of man coming we've seen he's seen it in the cloud we've had the opening of the word the ministry of the son of man and we see perplexity among nations we see distress in the world and men's hearts failing for fear people no longer have confidence in anything they have nothing that they can attach their confidence to amen and so their hearts are failing for fear because they don't have anybody to protect them they don't they don't trust a government to protect them they don't trust in banks to protect them the financial system is not secure they have nothing to protect them amen so their hearts are failing for fear seeing the destruction and the chaos all around but for us we should have a greater confidence than we've ever had before because this is prophecy being fulfilled this is a guarantee that my lord already knew and he's already made a provision there's no reason for my heart to fail for fear because everything's happening the way he said it would happen it's time for me to look up not look down not look around but look up because my redemption draweth nine [Music] in the message the the falling apart of the world prophet says so this world is falling apart let her fall apart that's all right it's going to do it anyhow what did micah say here what did micah speak of the mountains will molt it'll run like wax and pour over like a glacier spurting up and some kind of a geyser rather shall melt and fall away but jehovah will remain forever all flesh is grasp the breath of god blows upon it whether it's flowers grass how beautiful it withers away but the word of god of our god stands forever isaiah 40 was prophesying of the coming of the messiah said that all our creeds denominational systems educators genius and everything else will perish but the word of god shall remain forever upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it what has god given to us his unfailing word of promise what has he opened to us the unfailing word what has he given us to sure rock the foundation he's given us the unmovable amen the unchangeable the word the revelation that was hid and gone from before the foundation of the world that is what we're focusing on that is what we're hiding and that is what we're standing upon that is what's guiding us amen it can't change it can't fail and we have absolute confidence in the word of god let's look at ii peter now second peter chapter three second peter chapter three verse nine the lord is not slack concerning his promises some men count slackness but his long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and golliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless i love this at the end in verse 11 seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what everything what all things your house your car your place of work this building everything shall be dissolved seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness amen that that car you love it'll go to the junkyard at some point it'll be parted out it'll be crushed it'll be melted down and poured into another car if time goes that far if not it'll be melted by a different kind of fire your house going to go up in flames everything all the all that glitters around the world all the glow of hollywood the glitter of hollywood and of every uh uh uh the pride of man that's built all of these structures it's all going to burn it's all going to go away every government will collapse every system of men will fail amen and if that be so what manner of persons ought we to be we're not not worried because the government's shaky well the government's shaky praise god all these kingdoms must be the kingdoms of our christ they must become the kingdoms of christ they must shake down amen we we desire to live in peace as long as we can but there's promises that things are not going to get better they're going to get worse amen and as they get worse we don't want to be those amen that become distracted by the worsening condition of the world amen and become teetering and and disillusioned and and stopping and starting but we need to stay focused on what god has given us and keep moving regardless of what happens in the world praise god matthew chapter six let's read this together these are all simple scriptures that we know really really well but the thought is so pertinent for the day chapter 6 verse 19 matthew chapter 6 verse 19 lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also that's sometimes why men's hearts are failing for fear because all their treasures are wrapped up in this life everything they have to live for is in this life only but but if your treasure is not here but your treasure is somewhere else amen than the prospects of all this falling apart and a new system coming is not a bad prospect because your treasures aren't here anyways and where your treasure is there will your heart be also amen we want to make sure that we looking ahead and laying up treasures because that's where our heart will be amen and when everything falls apart here our heart will not fail because my heart is safely entrusting in christ who can keep all the things that i've given to him he can be trusted to hold it amen eternally brother said in the message hear his voice he said but there's so many voices today that takes the voice of the lord away from us there's the voice of pleasure so many people are listening to that where they can go and have a good time and many of them are professing to be christians some kind of an old rock and roll come up they just can't listen to what god they say well i'm a christian i read a verse in the bible today yeah jesus wept that's it go ahead but then to really get down and pray they got too much many other things to do there's so many voices in the world so many things to attract our attention from god amen and brother graham talks about one of them having pleasure but there's so many things that distract our attention from god and not all of them that are you know are wicked things sometimes just making a living just working just taking care of a house amen there's times there's weeks in your life where work in a house and taking care of children is absolutely completely consuming amen or when the car breaks and the plumbing goes out and they want you to work overtime all at the same time and then you become completely consumed it's at that time those times that we have to stop amen we have to stop and we got to refocus because if we don't stop and refocus we're going to find ourselves teetering because we're not here just for work that's part of our life we're not here just for the house that's part of our life the things still have to be repaired the things still have to be taken care of the job you still have to keep your job but but we got to remember that that's not the whole point of our life that's part of our life but we're here to reflect the word we're here to manifest the word of god in our everyday life and stay focused on what's coming ahead and so when things pile up that's time to stop amen not to keep moving or move faster but it's a time to say time out i need to refocus i need to realign my vision amen because i find myself teetering i'm wobbling a little bit i need to stop and get my eyes fixed because you be it's amazing to see how much god can do amen when you trust him to get it done amen so many supernatural things can begin to take place but when we stop amen and start focusing on our attention on the problems and the issues and all of that and become distracted and absorbed with that amen then god kind of leaves us to ourself to fix our own problem we're going to sort this out and sort this and sort this out but so many times if we would just keep moving forward and as we're moving forward and keeping focused on what's right and do what we can so many things just come together it's amazing watching people's lives and being a part of people's lives i'll tell you this it always works out what are you talking about brother chad i mean it always works out but what works out everything it always works out how many of you are homeless have nothing to eat today how many it always works out god is faithful to his promised word it always works out i mean your whole world might come crashing down and 10 things go wrong on the same day and i promise you it will all work out it always works out i i've been through people through dark times through difficulties through circumstances and issues and i've watched amen it will stay focused and centered on christ it always works out the finances always turn around the thing always gets fixed the solution always comes it always works out amen don't we we don't want to be distracted when life throws a bunch of hurdles in our way amen just sail over the hurdle and keep running towards the prize don't worry about it it's going to work out this too shall pass whatever you're going through this too shall pass there's so many distractions that come tests that come the devil will try to distract god will allow the test so that we learn how to run the race with patience but but we must stay focused there's some good questions to ask ourselves all the time why am i here what is my purpose in this life and what does this matter long term whatever is going on what does this matter long term because i have been so burnt out about the smallest issues i mean to me there were great big giant issues and i got so burnt out and so stressed and so worried over them but now i'm down the road a little further i look back and it was nothing it was a not it became an absolute non-issue amen but it was like the biggest issue of my life at the time but it worked out everything sorted out and it's not a problem and everything works out just trust god and move forward his word will solve every problem his promise will endure through every obstacle he has never failed to keep his word he will never fail yet to keep his word but we must have confidence in god there's so many there's so many things that we could look at so we go back to the boys riding the bike you know they could look down at the problem at hand and fixate on it and become distracting they could look around at what's going on in the crowd and the cheering crowd and and what's going over here and they could get distracted but there was only one place to look to win the prize and that was to look to the end amen what the goal was and so it's always good to ask my question what's my goal in life why am i here what's my purpose and what is my goal in life is it to to get a certain position at work to save a certain amount of money i mean poor brother dave wood he bust my bubble the other day we were sitting talking and brother dave said i used to think when i get older and i can retire and i can do anything i want and it'll be so great and i'll have this all this time he said then you retire you have no time it's not that great is that right brother dave i said brother dave don't tell me that i'm still dreaming that retirement will be this utopia and everything will work out fine and he said when you get there it's not like that and i believe him because everything that has happened in my life every milestone and achievement that i thought was going to be the answer never was the answer the promotion wasn't the answer the graduation wasn't the answer nothing was the answer amen this life is not this life is not to keep us here to keep us playing in one position but life is structured to keep us moving towards a goal so now i've just thrown away all my dreams for retirement thank you brother dave the devil would love for us to forget who we are why we're here and where we're going he would love to have us as christians going around in circles distracted wobbling falling off trying to get back on falling off he would love to keep us distracted and disoriented and detoured but we have a message we know the mind of god we know why we're here we know what his purpose is for us we know where we're going we know what comes next amen and for the glory that lay ahead we'll endure whatever comes along because the glory that lay ahead is so worth enduring whatever we endure in life brother bram says in the masterpiece he talks about a a vision that he had had of the preview of the bride so then as they started leaving two or three of them in the back kind of get out of step and i was going to holler at them and they was trying to get back in step and i seen them just in the vision just fade out and change from me says and the reason they were dressed in different parts shall come from all nations it'll make up the bride each one had long hair and no makeup and real pretty girls and they were watching me that represented the bride coming out of all nations see she each one represented a nation as they march perfectly in line with the word and then i have to watch her this is brother eminem saying i have to watch her he said they were watching me and he said i have to watch her i have to watch her she'll get out of step with that word if i don't watch when she is passing by if she gets by maybe it'll be my time when i'm oversee when i'm finished or whatever it is what they was getting back trying their best it was getting back just get in line because they was looking out somewhere else watching about that church that just went out into chaos the front ones never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepped out a little bit to the right side and looked like was trying to get back in line as they went by they just passed me oh far is here to the wall past me and i was standing there and then i just seen it all move out and leave so brother man we know this this vision that he has of the preview of the bride he sees a perfect bride coming by in review and she's perfect marching and he says not just marching but walking like a lady gracefully marching by amen and she said she was just perfect and and it was beautiful amen then come another one and then the voice told him now we'll see the review of the church and now the church has come by and he said oh it was dirty and it was filthy and it was immoral and it was it was wrong and they were going off into chaos and his heart was breaking and he was so discouraged but then he says but the bride will come again amen and then he finds now the bride's marching and this is the end time bride and the end time bride now is marching the first one was the first bride this is the end time bride she's got to come back again and as she's marching by she was supposed to be looking at the prophet and the prophet was watching her to keep her and step with the word but she got distracted looking somewhere else at the worldly church that was going on from the chaos and when she looked away from the prophet amen she got out of step with the word and brother ben was crying get back in step and when he saw the vision leave she was trying to get back in line she'd not get in line with other believers she was trying to get in line with the word amen and she got distracted by the worldly church and i say god help us not to be distracted by anything but keep our eyes fixed on that voice that god gave us in this day the message that came through the messenger to keep us lined up with the word he was screaming out in the end of his ministry to stay in line with the word amen after the seals he was preaching to the bride stay in line stay in step stay in harmony with this revealed word amen if we'll stay not watching anything else but watching this word amen to stay in step with the word you can see why this is such a distracting time in life why this is such a distracting age amen because this is the age that god will bring the restoration of his word and if we'll focus on that word that word will keep us in line and bring us to our destination and solve every problem along the way but you can see why the devil will create an eden where there'll be distraction upon distraction upon distraction and there'll be every reason for us to be upset disoriented discouraged troubled all around amen because anything to get us to look away from that message look away from that prophet and get distracted and get off step but oh god help us heed the voice of the prophet i mean as he was screaming at the end get back in step get back in step with the word this word was given to us to give us everything we needed to finish the race it was the last thing that was poured into the bride it was the last measure that was given to her to help her to finish the last leg of this race and let's stay in in line with the word first corinthians chapter nine let's turn there first corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striveth for mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we uncorruptable everybody who runs in this race is running but one person is going to get the prize so he's he's admonishing the believers you run like you're the one who's going to get the prize and he who runs in the race is temperate and all things he has self-control because he has a goal he's not going to get distracted he's not going to be moved off course because he wants to win the prize and the apostle paul is telling us this is how we should run our race as christians temperate in all things not allowing pleasures or distractions or other things to knock us off course amen but to be tempered in all things and to run the race so that we might obtain the prize says in the message shalom do as david did put your future into his hands don't look to anything else david said said my time is in his hands you notice here in the psalms where we read it in in 62 my time is in his hand he is my rock what is he he is revealed to me he is the revealed truth my time is in his hands amen oh my there you are my time belongs to him i am his i'm in his hand because he holds the time i don't know what the future holds but i know who holds the future so he who holds the future holds me so why should i think about setting forth this that or the other for the new year i just put myself in his hands and walked like david did my time is in his hands he knew that god held the future david didn't know what the future was but he know god had the future i don't know what the future is none of us do but we know he holds the future we're standing here at the end of time and we're watching the world fall into chaos we're watching everything crumble all around us and we know amen god has given us a vision of what's coming next amen but we don't know how to get from here to there what are the steps what are the obstacles what are the events that shall transpire what are the events on the local level what are the events on a global level what what things are going to transpire we don't know all the details but we know one thing i'm in his hand the one who holds the future holds me i don't have to worry about the next obstacle the next global crisis the next thing i don't have to worry about it because i'm in his hand he already knows about it he knows the destination if i'll stay connected to him i will get right through the next global catastrophe i'll go right through the next local catastrophe i'll go through my next personal catastrophe because the one who holds the future who holds eternity holds me the one who came up with the plan to begin with is the one who's leading me in this journey i just put my hand in his and just walk i don't need to exert all kinds of mental energy trying to figure it out because i won't figure it out just walk just keep moving by his grace it'll all work out james tells us go to now you say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away for that you ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or that amen we're all guilty of this we'll get our calendars out do it all the time i do it all the time and we'll put events in and fill up the calendar my calendar is completely full and i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that i'm going to do that but really i have no idea what i'm going to do 10 minutes from now that's up to god i mean i've got things we need to plan there's goals that we need to have there's nothing wrong with that but i hold them all loosely because it may never happen and if it doesn't ever happen it needs to be fine with me if none of those things happen as long as i i'm in god's will and i'm walking in his hand if it god wills we'll do this if god wills will do that it's not something that we all have to start you know it's not a a chant we almost make every time we make a plan but it's an attitude we must have every time we make a plan that i will do this if it's god's will i will go here if it's in god's will i will do this if it serves god's purpose but but i am yielded to god's plan all the time not my own plans psalms 90 verse 10 says the days of our years are three score years and 10 at 70 years and if by reason of strength they'd be four score years that's 80. yet is there strength labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away james said our life is a vapor said it's 70 years with strength 80 and then it's cut off and we fly away and if we look at 80 years or 80 plus years compared with eternity there is no comparison you know we we can't help ourselves but come into this world with spiritual amnesia and all we've experienced is this life and we've counted days the way everybody else counts days and weeks and months and years the way everybody else counts time and we've lived and grown and these bodies but the word came to break our spiritual amnesia and return us to the understanding that we are eternal beings amen we existed before time we exist after time and this little blip in the radar really is nothing in our eternal existence this is a time of testing this is a time of character building this is a school that we're in so we can learn and gain character and learn the things we need to rule and reign with christ amen this is this is not the goal amen this was just part of the plan to get us to the goal we need to stop living like this is the goal and come back to realizing this is just my school amen i don't ever remember being in school thinking i want to do this all my life i hope i get to do this 70 or 80 years no i knew this was a short period of time and when i this was a goal to get me to something else it was to get me to independence to a job to a career so i could live on my own and this life is this isn't the goal friends this is just to get us to the goal this is part of the training and it's a spec amen it's just a spec it's nothing amen we need to not uh we need to just keep focused on what is eternal and what is of true value job told us man that is born of a woman is a few days job 14 verse 1 man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower and it's cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not that's not very discouraging i mean that's pretty discouraging not very encouraging but when we understand why we're here then it puts everything into perspective brother branham says and spiritual adoption from 1956 and there it is just one thing after the other and sickness on every hand i'm so glad there's a way out i'm so glad we don't have to stay here forever too aren't you what would we do if i had to live in this pest house forever i'm so glad there's an open door and that's all the earth is just a pest house just as soon as you think we're running all right then here comes something else along and get here here comes something else but i'm so glad that there's a way out so happy that the lord jesus has come and made a way of escape brother bam said aren't you glad there's something called death aren't you glad that as your body deteriorates and brother bam told us one thing i love about the prophet of god amen is he was so real and he was so normal he wasn't a super spiritualist into fanaticism he was a normal person and he acted in a normal way you could relate to him because he wasn't a fanatic amen he wasn't he wasn't trying to confess that he never had problems but he realized he even said now he said we've got these aches and pains and we know as we get older these things will come this is a man who preached divine healing and had a gift of healing in his life that was a minister to him by an angel and he's admitting the reality of life is as we get older these things must come on and they'll come more and more as we as we age and he says he says i just hope god gives me strength to endure it he's not even saying i'll never have i've got faith he had faith but he also knew that this body is sown in corruption this is part of the fall it has to be reversed everything has been changed until that time this is the reality that we live in i love the prophet of god being normal being a human being that you and i could relate to i want to be real like him not a religious fanatic but the reality of life and understand my position and how to live in this life how to to to deal with people how to love people how to deal with situations it was all demonstrated for us in this end time and i thank god for it he said these things come i'm so thankful there's death to get us out of this pestilence he says look at bill dowell he said he's 90 years old can you imagine another 30 40 years amen can you imagine amen your body deteriorating down to where you have no mobility no quality of life an absolute deterioration but you can't die there's no freedom there's no way to get out of the pest house but it gets weaker and weaker and more deteriorated all the time i said thank god this is not my destination amen this this world is not my home i'm just a passing through i'm here to gain character i'm here to display the word i'm here to become the manifested word for this day as christ lives his life through me i'm here to shine the glorious gospel of the end time as i yield myself to his hand and let him live his life through me i'm here to shine as a light i'm here to walk the path he has for me and i'm to do it with joy in the midst of the troubles that he and his wisdom allowed to come my way because this is not my permanent destination i'm just passing through i'm just running a race but i've got a prize at the end of this race whether it be through the change in my atoms instantly or i get to die and go on to the sixth dimension either way i've got a reward coming amen and i'm not living for now i'm living for that reward and if we stay focused on that amen the disappointments of life become minimal because this is just another thing it'll pass it'll be okay i just want to gain the character that i'm supposed to gain and move forward and shine the light that i'm supposed to shine in this problem and the problem that comes tomorrow i want to do the same thing i'm not expecting listen i'll tell you i for years i thought once we get past this it'll be smooth sailing anybody else think that when you're raising children or even in the church i think once we get over this obstacle it'll be smooth sailing once we get over this and now my whole thinking's changed i'm thinking i might as well just stay in this trial because i understand this one i'm not so eager to move to the next one because i don't that one that's a mystery to me and that's a little intimidating but at least i know what i'm dealing with here because you realize that this life is structured for that there must be a press to get the fragrance out of the rose amen to get the perfume to get the life to come out there must be a squeeze amen and we constantly have to get squeezed to let the life of christ come out so let's not be disappointed with life let's not live for this life let's look for the next one you know and i and and and i don't want you to misunderstand me and when i'm preaching because i still enjoy my life there are many pleasurable things and blessings that god allows in my life and i enjoy him to the max like there's times with my family there's times that i enjoy absolutely enjoy it thoroughly enjoy it and i've learned every pleasure that god allows to come my way i want to throw myself completely into it and suck out all the pleasure i can because i know there's another child coming and more hardship coming we become discouraged when we want it all to be blessings and all to be pleasure but we realize this is school so everything that comes i say thank you lord jesus and i enjoy it and i thank god for it and i enjoy my life i enjoy the pleasurable times it gives me i enjoy the times of fellowship i enjoy those things and i want to continue to enjoy them but i also must realize that that's just god's blessing because he's a good father and he loves to bless his children but his purpose is for us to make it through school to graduate to attain to something to gain the character that is necessary for what he knows is coming next and i want to be faithful paul says in philippians chapter 1 verse 21 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain [Music] but if i live in the flesh but the if i live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labor yeah what i shall choose i want not for i am in a straight betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with christ which is far better nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you paul was not dreading his death the apostle paul was not dreading his death for him it was a release for him it was a stepping into another place and to freedom and i read this quote here of brother bantam going to the bedside of his first wife and she was dying a young woman in her early 20s with two babies and and she says she said bill you've preached about it you've talked about it but you don't have no idea what it is i said what are you talking about she said heaven she said look she said i was being escorted home by some people's men or women or something they was dressed in white and she said i was at ease and peace said big pretty birds flying from tree to tree she said don't think i'm beside myself she was coming out he called her back he called her name and he called her back and she said why did you call me back she didn't she was going to a place she didn't want to come back to brother branham when he went beyond the curtain of time he went into the sixth dimension and was greeting the saints and then he you know he he begins to reiterate the story and tell us all about it but then he said i had a funny feeling i looked back and my body was moving on the bed and he said do i have to go back amen he in the bed next to him was his wife and the other room was his children amen but he had moved into such a reality such a goal such a place that he he himself did not want to go back to that old life and tell your friends there's a reward at the end there's anoth there's something better than this amen don't be discouraged don't be brokenhearted don't be downcast amen be happy in the face of trial this is another lesson this is another opportunity to shine this is part of god's plan for me for to overcome to show that the word will overcome but i got something better coming this isn't my my place of pleasure that's coming praise god and the message things that are to be brother i said this old earthly tabernacle here you know what it is this body it's like an old colt a coat that you wear a coat that you once wear but now you have one so much better you don't use it anymore what do you do you hang in the closet for you've got one better you've got a better coat it's more up to date than the one you used to wear that's worn out what it is that garment you are the inside of that there that garment only done what it bore your image see but you don't need it anymore now you've hung it up it's a rag and that's the way this old body is it's bore the image of the heavenly yet it is not you you are on the inside of that body you the spirit of god is on the inside of that body that's what makes the outside come in subjections because the inside is pulling at sea bringing in line with the word of god your inside you yourself your being brother member said in another place he says we've really never seen one another before you've only seen the earthly that bore the image because the real me is a spiritual me and the real you is a spiritual you amen the life of the soul and we've never really seen one another before we've only seen the earth that we dwell in and interacted with amen but we we've never really seen one another because you live in that body you're not that body and i live in this body i'm not this body and when i hear that i'm so glad because this body is doing things to me lately that i don't like i mean i crossed 40 and i was feeling pretty good and then all of a sudden things hurt that never hurt and things are more difficult that never used to be difficult and picking something off the floor becomes embarrassing i thought what's happening to me i'm so glad this isn't me amen there's a life inside of me that wants to live there's a life inside of me that's real life amen that must continue on this life and this body is deteriorating amen it's falling apart it's growing in weakness but there's another life in me that will never grow weak that will never deteriorate that will never pass away and when it leaves this body it's going to a heavenly body amen that will never change that will never grow old so we don't want to be discouraged we want to be encouraged there's a purpose in it all it's normal but i'm going through so much it's normal and it's okay but it's so hard it's all right it will be okay a year from now two years from now five years from now you're going to have a testimony from today that says the word works i've got evidence he's still my healer he's still my deliverer he's still the one who provides he goes on in this quote said this body is just an old coat and someday what will you do with it it was only in in the garment for a while that is like the earthly garment this body your real body your real self is on the inside of this old coat that you call william branham or susie jones or whoever it is someday it will hang on the earth's hall of memory of you you'll put it out yonder in the grave and somebody will put a tombstone up here lies reverend so-and-so or john so-and-so or so-and-so it'll lie there as a memorial of you the people just seen you in this and what you was your real you was on the inside of that but the old code itself just borne the image of the heavenly old people have you met made reservations to change codes have you made reservations for heaven remember you must have reservations you can't get in without them let's turn and look at second corinthians chapter five and read this scripture together ii corinthians chapter 5 verse 1 for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the self-same thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of his spirit the baptism of the holy ghost is the earnest of the spirit it's the down payment showing there's something better coming [Music] if you've got the spirit of god dwelling in you it's the earnest the down payment showing that it's not always going to be like this there's something better coming praise god in the invisible union the prophet says some of you people that really believe this to be the truth that we're entering another age we're entering the rapture age you know the church can't go into this condition it can't get any better it must get worse how many knows that say amen it's got to get worse it can't go like this it's got to be something and it's moving right now friend it's on the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's thus saith the lord we've entered into the rapture age and the move is on for the bride i have no desire to stay amen i only want to stay to finish the purpose he has for me and i want to be faithful in that purpose but that this is the rapture age that we've moved into this is time for everything to change and i'm eager for it to change and if i've got to pass through a few more lessons i want to go through my lessons amen because i'm here amen to accomplish what he wants to accomplish first corinthians 2 9 says but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god god has a plan and we are part of that plan in the message shalom from january 1964 the prophet says the dawning of a new day he said i feel it all over me now this is a new day friends this is shalom good morning peace the world is going into absolute utter darkness it's gone into the church has gone into complete apostasy the world has gone to complete darkness but brother benham said good morning church good morning little bride shalom it is the rising of the sun it is the dawning of a new day and where is it rising it's rising in me it's dawning in my heart amen he said i can feel it all over me now what's he doing he's moved into the rays of the light warm sunlight of a new day amen while laodicea is in darkness amen while the church is an absolute apostasy where there's been a complete blackout of the truth in the church amen brother brenham can feel the warm rays of the new day can you feel it amen not on this skin but in your soul can you feel the warm sunlight of the new day amen it's going to become an absolute reality all over said i feel it all over me now the light of a new day the light of a day where there's no night there's no darkness there's no shadows no skies no damn dark skies no midnights no graves no flowers on the hillside no funeral processions no doctors no more i can feel the rays of his light breaking through upon my soul the new day the old one is pressing away that's why when this world is falling apart we can be happy amen we can have joy in the midst of our trials amen if things get worse for us personally if things get worse for us locally if things get worse in this nation amen it cannot take away that the new day has already dawned in my heart i know where i'm going because it's alive inside of me the warm rays of the full light of the gospel shining in me and pretty soon i'll have a triune body that'll feel it all amen but right now i can feel it in my soul there's nothing to be distressed about there's nothing to be discouraged about everything is just right the rays of light breaking through upon my soul the new day as i feel the mortal blood pouring through my body i feel the surge of the holy ghost come in behind it rise and shine something said billy branham you're getting old you're getting weak your shoulders are dropping your hair is turning gray and falling out that's right and darkness gross darkness upon the earth but rise and shine i feel falling there the surge of light of the glorious gospel of jesus christ which has has made me a new creature in him i look for that day amen for the new day i don't know what the future is i don't know what it holds 1964 holds for me or nothing else but i hold the hand of him that holds eternity who is eternity are you holding the hand of him who holds eternity the one who is eternity has the new day dawned in your heart he says arise and shine when everybody else goes into depression the bride goes into absolute joy amen there's nothing to be depressed about what's it to be depressed about well you say you lost your job well i mean it's only going to prove that my god is a provider you know if we could take the right mental attitude and we could set our focus on the right goal amen and stay focused on what the goal is and keep moving god will work it all out what in your life hasn't he worked out what obstacle haven't you overcome what thing has he not worked out in life he's worked them all out or he is working them out but they will all work out for his glory brother man said in the message go tell my disciples from 1953 this quote here i really loved it one of these glorious spring mornings when all of it's over and the atomic bombs done bursted and the world sent her over yonder and she's whirled around through the years and been purified brought back and the palm trees will rise up in the earth again a resurrection of all nature like god did in the beginning going back to eden [Music] there'll be no pollution in the soil there'll be no pollution in the air and the palm trees there'll be no germs or diseases to ever break them down again the apple trees will never get old hallelujah shall rise raise up in some glorious beautiful morning when the big birds are flying from tree to tree jesus shall appear here on the earth again there is nothing in this life that can compare to that there is nothing he brother brennan is not talking spiritually now he's talking naturally physically upon this earth that when god created an eden he made fruit that he wanted his children to eat amen he wanted to have fellowship with them amen in the physical form and he wanted them to enjoy his creation wanted to enjoy his earth enjoy the sunshine enjoy the cool water he wanted him to enjoy it and he's bringing it back to that he'll purify the soil purify the air he'll bring everything back there'll be a resurrection of all nature and i'll be there in a glorified body having my atoms changed amen and a perfect triune being with a perfect flesh body with my theophany amen spirit and with my soul that's been regenerated and born again a perfect triune person back in the original condition amen there to taste the fruit that god made to be good [Music] that's the goal friends that's where this all is leading to it's all coming back to eden and what problem do we have that's worth getting distracted over when we put it all back into perspective and brother banham starts to describe what it'll be like amen and he says the great birds flying from tree to tree i mean can you imagine the the warm air and the smell of the fruit on the trees and the blossoms of the flowers and perfection everywhere and the greatest perfection is the perfection inside of you no more war with yourself no more wrong thoughts no more wrong desires no more inhibitions no more insecurities no more of anything going on inside amen you come back to that perfect son of god that he always intended for you to be and in a perfect environment and if you ever get discouraged here take this picture and put it out in front of you and just keep walking because we're going to make it there it's a promise it's just a shirt as anything else is a shirt it's going to happen we're going to sit under the tree we're going to hear the brook we're going to taste the fruit and we're going to worship at the feet of jesus in a physical body when he sets up the kingdom of david i'm going to see my lord amen in the body that he had when he was here on earth what a reward friends what a reward i gotta pass through a few days a man that's born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble what's a few days compared to eternity in this condition what's a few days what's 70 80 90 years compared to eternity in that world i think sometimes it does us good just to go back to the simple promise of the restoration of eden and put it before our face sometimes go back to the most simple and basic things of the gospel and put them right back in front of our eyes to realize everything's okay there's a promise there's a goal there's a crown to be won there's a prize at the end of this life and it's going to be worth it all hebrews 13 14 says for here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come we will never be satisfied with anything that this life offers you buy a new car it'll break down you build a new house you don't need repair everything i mean everything ends up disappointing everything that we get so excited about becomes a disappointment because everything in this life is corrupted and deteriorates i thought it was going to be so wonderful to have my own job in my own house and my own my independence and do whatever i wanted that was a disappointment every goal every station in life every thing i achieved every physical thing i bought ends up being a disappointment at some point the the the garbage yards the the junkyards are full of people's dreams that are now worthless but i want to keep this one dream before my eyes all the time because it's not a dream it's a reality for the glory that sits ahead let us endure our cross even despising the shame not not pleasant not liking it but let us go through it to get to the goal and let me do so with joy in the midst of the trial that he sees fit to allow to come my way for he's molding in me a character that i'll need there and he's he's bringing something out of me that will testify that his word is true i said god i'm your vessel have your way with me help me keep my eyes on that prize let's all stand musicians if you'll come it's good sometimes to refocus our glasses you have a bad day turns into a bad week can become a bad month it's time to refocus our glasses it's all okay friends god wouldn't have allowed it if it didn't serve his purpose he wouldn't have permitted it he wouldn't have signed off on it to come into your life if it wasn't for our good for his good it wasn't going to accomplish something for his kingdom so now let's just put our eyes a little bit higher not down on the board we're trying to cross not at the crowds on the side not at the critics and not at the fans let's put our eyes at the end of this path and say that's what i got to get to i got to get to him and i want to be pleasing to him let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for this day lord for the word that you've placed before us for the promise that we have god as we're reminded lord of what this life is and what's coming god help us to take courage for god by the opening of the word we can feel the sunlight from that new world warming our souls lord we're laying in the sun lord that's bringing a full maturity to the scene god that new day is dawned in our hearts and we're moving into it in full reality lord help us god encourage us along the way help us to stay true and be faithful as your people god i give myself to you help me lord to see the goal and stay focused thereon help me to look ahead lord help your people or if there's anyone here who's been discouraged beat up by life and overwhelmed by the obstacles and the difficulties i pray that right now you would give them a fresh vision of what lays ahead give them lord an inspiration from that vision to take another step forward knowing that it will all work out that this too shall pass that god that you're going to that word will never fail that's inside of them but it'll accomplish what you sent it forth to accomplish helpless god to be the manifestation of your word in this day that it would flow out from us lord in every squeeze and in every trial that it would just bring more of that fragrance lord that's pleasing to you god may we be found faithful by our own choosing to stay committed to you and joyful in the path that you have for us the wall we love you lord we ask that you encourage us help us to walk with you and keep our hand in yours trusting that you know the way bless your people lord encourage your people i pray in jesus christ's name amen bless you brother ben i'll live for jesus and let the world go by i'll claim his promises he will survive we'll walk together my lord [Music] and let the world go oh i'll live for jesus and let the world go by i'll claim his promises he will survive we'll walk together [Music] [Music] the move is on my lord the move is on and oh so move on brother move
