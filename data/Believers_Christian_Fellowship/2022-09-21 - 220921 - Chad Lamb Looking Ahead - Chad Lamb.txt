========================================

one thing I love about the prophet of God Amen is he was so real and he was so normal he wasn't a super spiritualist into fanaticism he was a normal person and he acted in a normal way you could relate to him because he wasn't a fanatic amen he wasn't he wasn't trying to confess that he never had problems but he realized he even said now he said we got these aches and pains and we know as we get older these things will come this is a man who preached Divine Healing and had a gift of healing in his life there was a minister to him by an Angel and he's admitting the reality of life is as we get older these things must come on and they'll come more and more as we as we age and he says and he says I just hope God gives me strength to endure it he's not even saying oh I'll never have I've got faith he had Faith but he also knew that this body is sown in corruption this is part of the Fall it has to be reversed everything has been changed until that time this is the reality that we live in I love the prophet of God being normal being a human being that you and I could relate to I want to be real like him not a religious fanatic but the reality of life and understand my position and how to live in this life how to to deal with people how to love people how to deal with situations it was all demonstrated for us in this end time and I thank God for it he said these things come I'm so thankful there's death to get us out of this pest house he says look at Bill Dow he said he's 90 years old can you imagine another 30 40 years amen can you imagine amen your body deteriorating down to where you have no Mobility no quality of life an absolute deterioration but you can't die there's no Freedom there's no way to get out of the pest house but it gets weaker and weaker and more deteriorated all the time I said Thank God this is not my destination amen this is this this world is not my home I'm just a passing through I'm here to gain character I'm here to display the word I'm here to become the manifested word for this day as Christ lives his life through me I'm here to shine the the Glorious Gospel of the end time as I yield myself to his hand and let him live his life through me I'm here to shine as a light I'm here to walk the path he has for me and I'm to do it with joy in the midst of the troubles that he and his wisdom allowed to come my way because this is not my permanent destination I I'm just passing through I'm just running a race but I've got a prize at the end of this race whether it be through the change of my items instantly or I get to die and go on to the sixth Dimension either way I've got a reward coming amen and I'm not living for now I'm living for that reward and we stay focused on that amen the disappointments of Life become minimal because this is just another thing it'll pass it'll be okay I just want to gain the character that I'm supposed to gain and move forward and Shine the Light that I'm supposed to shine in this problem
