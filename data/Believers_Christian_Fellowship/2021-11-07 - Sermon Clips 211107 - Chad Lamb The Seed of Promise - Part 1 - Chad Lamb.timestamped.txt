[0:00] if you look at the way jesus handled the
[0:01] word in his day he did not speak the
[0:04] word when he was speaking of what moses
[0:06] taught and all of this and even jonas he
[0:09] was taking scriptures from david and
[0:10] from jonas and from joel and from
[0:12] zechariah and all these things and he
[0:15] was preaching in a way they had never
[0:16] heard it preached like that before
[0:19] they couldn't even understand it applied
[0:21] that way it didn't even make any sense
[0:23] to them the way that jesus was
[0:25] presenting the word because he was
[0:26] presenting it so differently than their
[0:28] intellectual understanding and then the
[0:30] apostle paul comes and does the same
[0:32] thing with the scriptures we read i'm
[0:34] telling you it's hard to go back and
[0:36] think like a jew we've never thought
[0:37] like a jew but if you could go back and
[0:39] think like a jew and then paul would be
[0:42] absolutely tearing the height off of
[0:45] your your understanding
[0:47] flipping your understanding on its heel
[0:49] and messing up everything that you had
[0:50] learned all of your life
[0:53] but i tell you the prophet of god in our
[0:55] day did the exact same thing to the
[0:56] denominational understanding of the word
[1:00] and when the word comes to fulfillment
[1:02] and the interpretation of the word is
[1:03] always different than the humanistic
[1:06] understanding of being able to read
[1:08] words
[1:09] being able to read words and comprehend
[1:11] language amen when when jesus came he
[1:14] tore that to shreds when paul came he
[1:16] tore that to shreds and when brother
[1:18] branham came he tore that to shreds
[1:23] that's why people say i don't need
[1:25] anything else i just want my bible
[1:27] that's wonderful if you've got eyes to
[1:29] see and ears they're here you'll be good
[1:30] but if you're reading it the way the
[1:32] jews read their bible when jesus was
[1:34] here you'll be as lost as the jews who
[1:36] were rejecting jesus
[1:39] because they they didn't want this they
[1:41] just wanted their bible but this was
[1:42] their bible
[1:45] amen and we've come to the end of time
[1:47] where god in his mercy and grace has
[1:49] sent a prophet in this age and that
[1:51] prophet was here to bring the correct
[1:53] interpretation of the word to illuminate
[1:55] the word so that we could see the
[1:56] scriptures the way god wanted the
[1:58] scripture seen
[2:00] and you have people with the audacity to
[2:02] say i don't want that i just want my
[2:03] bible you put yourself right back where
[2:05] the jews were in the day jesus was here
[2:07] because this message is christ
