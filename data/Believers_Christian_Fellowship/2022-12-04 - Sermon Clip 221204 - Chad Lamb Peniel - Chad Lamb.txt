TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we need to meet the reality not the concept the reality we need to meet the person of the word not not the the the just the letter form but the living word amen in our day he's here he's here he's come by amen there's a there is there's a man come by who's speaking figuratively there's a man come by that you can get a hold of amen and if you can get a hold of him amen you can hold on till He blesses you until he changes your name till he changes your identity until he causes you to lose all confidence in the flesh there's a man here it's the Lord Jesus Christ he's here where is he he's here to speak to you face to face how do you know he's not speaking to you now what are you looking for what is your imagination tell you what if he's here through the preaching of the word presenting himself to you what if he's here using a vessel of clay and and vocal cords of a human being but what if he's present now laying out his plan and his word and his identification of you and he's here to meet you face to face what are you going to wait for what are you going to look for what other manifestation do you want before you give in amen God is presenting himself through the opening of the word through the word he's presenting himself he is the word he's the person of the word the veil has been taken off the word and he's it's the unveiling of God and he's here Christ is the mystery of God revealed that's the seventh seal he's here now presenting himself he's available you can get a hold of him and you can wrestle it out with him and you can start talking to him like Moses did and said God if you don't if your presence doesn't go with me don't live me Live Another Day don't let me go up and don't let me keep moving forward don't let me keep acting like a message believer make me a message believe me I don't want to be a church member I don't want to be this I want to be your son I want to be your daughter I want to be your bride I need a name change and I need you to touch something in me that'll cause me to lose confidence in this flesh and change me change the way I walk change the way I talk change the way I think God Jacob could not do it to himself there is no Reformation for Jacob there was only a transformation for Jacob and the transformation come and meeting God face to face his transformation came at penniel when he met God face to face
