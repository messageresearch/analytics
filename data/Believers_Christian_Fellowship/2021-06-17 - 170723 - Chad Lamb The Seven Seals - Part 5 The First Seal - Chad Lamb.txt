========================================

praise the lord it's good to see you all here this morning it's good to be here this morning amen we're going to continue on where we've been starting last sunday with the seven seals so if you could take your bibles and let's just start right away in the second corinthians read one scripture while you're standing while you're turning there i just want to make mention of our youth meeting this past friday night we did questions and answers with all of the youth and i was so blessed to hear the questions that our youth asked i mean i remember i remember back when brother branham preached the seven seals and he asked through the week he said now if you have questions concerning these seals put them in at the end and and the questions that came were were so childish they were so carnal they they were so not about the seven seals that when you hear brother ben reading them you feel sorry for him because he says several times but but then we have a youth meeting where their youth ages 13 and up are asking questions and these questions would blow away most theologians today how do these youth even know to ask these questions why are they even interested in this it just shows that god is preparing his bride his whole bride he's calling us higher he's preparing us for a rapture so we had a wonderful time i think we answered questions for over two hours and and they had submitted them ahead of time written them out and given them to me and it was wonderful and i thought it was a blessing we had more coming in so we're going to have to do it again in a couple months but it was a real blessing we should be really proud of our young people around here they're really getting a hold of the word and getting interested in the word i always thought that was excellent let's go to second corinthians uh chapter 11 verse 1. second corinthians chapter 11 verse 1. wood to god you would bear with me a little in my falling and indeed bear with me for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ but i fear lest by any means as the serpent begowed eve through his septility so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ amen there's two different words there that i want to think about as subtility and simplicity amen let's just bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord for your word lord we've come to this time lord where where we've looked forward to this time of hearing you lord hearing from you communing with you around your word and we're asking now that you would come in a supernatural way by the power of your holy spirit to pick up a gift that you've laid in a vessel of clay that you would use that gift lord to begin to speak to us your eternal words lord break to us the word the bread of life lord that we might have strength to sustain in the journey that we might grow thereby and become all that you've called for us to be in this last day we love you we give you preeminence in this place and ask lord that you would have your liberty in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated amen i just want to remember that the deacons told me that we have a family visiting they're from the congo and they've moved to to the united states and they live in fort wayne so they visited and so they're they're back in the father's nursery now with brother emmanuel who's interpreting the service into french live so i'm going to try to be very careful for brother emanuel and not go too fast still pull pull but i'm going to try my best not to go too fast for brother emmanuel but just forgive me now brother emmanuel forgive me now amen praise the lord so we see here that paul is worried he's jealous over a virgin a virgin church that he's presenting to christ and he's here in the first church age talking about this but he's concerned about something he's concerned that the the serpent that will will deceive this bride like he deceived the first bride he says but i fear that's by any means as the serpent begot eve through his septility this word subtility means cunningness or craftiness he's shrewd and cunning and intelligent in the ways of the world and he used that cunningness to deceive eve so you see eve was deceived by reason by reasoning you know the devil never came and told her something that that sounded ignorant that didn't didn't sound childish but he came in a way it was so uh it was so intelligent it was so cunning it was crafty and it was wise and it was subtle and and that's why she was deceived eve wasn't deceived because she was seeking to do evil eve was deceived because along the path enjoying the garden living in the paradise of god satan came in and he was trying to disrupt the work of god so he was trying to find a vessel in which he could work and and he found the serpent and the serpent was so close to man you have to find he's always getting as close as he can possibly get satan you don't have to worry amen you don't have to worry about satan trying to grab you and drag you into a bar room somewhere try to grab you into a house of prostitution that's not the problem amen what he's trying to do he's coming in with cunning craftiness and he's coming in so close as close as he can possibly get because he wants to be wherever god is he wants to usurp god's throne usurp god's authority so he's getting as close as he possibly can so so we the the problem is you know we get caught up in our minds as human beings and fighting the devil and and fighting him in places he's not at you know we want to we want to we want to fight for uh uh to abolish drugs we want to fight the the opium addiction we want to fight uh drug abuse we want to fight uh ting pregnancy we want to fight all of these things and brother branham said these are all symptoms of one cause and that one causes unbelief in god's word caused all of those things and so we're trying to fight the devil in places he's not at where is he at he's always right here trying to get deviation from the true word that's where he's working once he gets you to deviate from the true word your own human nature will take you to the drug house we'll take you to the house of prostitution or the gambling casino that's your own fallen nature we'll take you there that's not where he's at that's not where we should be fighting not picketing casinos that's not the problem we should be picketing false churches we should be picketing those who who are encountering craftiness deceived by the word of god that's the problem the problem is not what what what everybody else seems to be fighting you're just beating the air because that's not the issue he didn't come to eve amen and and he came with the word and he tried to bring a slight deviation to the word if we go ahead and bring up the powerpoint please i am going to make myself go slow not just because we have visitors or getting interpretation but because i don't want to lose anybody here i want to i want to back up if we could all turn to the book of revelation together uh i'm trying so hard to force myself i mean last night it was 11 o'clock at night and i'm pacing the floor at my house i'm i'm as nervous as the cat in the dog pound because i i don't know how to get all of this information out this little tube you know out this little hole we've got to do it in bite-sized chunks and i'm just saying god what what what tomorrow what are we going to do so really in many ways i've come to the pulpit all filled up and i'm trusting god to just bring out whatever he wants to bring out so i'm depending on you to pull pull from the source and see what god will speak to us today but i don't want to go too fast because we've got plenty of time to minister on this we're going to be ministering on this subject for a while and so nobody get in a hurry i'm saying that for myself what i would like to do is i'd like to bring you all over to my house i'd like to sit in a chair for six hours and start breaking this down that's what i that's my preferred method that's what i would like to do but but this is god's way and we're gonna go god's way let's go to revelations chapter 4. i'm going to read a lengthy reading but let's all read together and stay tuned in revelations chapter 4 it says after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me was saying come up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter. so we know that that john is caught up he's a type of them he's a type of the bride here brother branham says this is a type of the rapture and so now he hears a voice and wants the voice it's a trumpet so the trumpet calls him to the rapture amen just same thing for us that final trump will call us up higher now verse 2 and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one side on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an imran and round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne there were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come so we we see here that he looks and he sees a throne and a roundabout and in the midst of the throne are these four beasts and we're going to find these fourth beasts are major players as we talk about the church ages and the seven seals that these four beasts have a major part to play but you you have to understand the four beasts position because it matters where they are they are in the midst of and around about the throne and that's where you always find these four beasts you find them in the old testament there you find them whenever there's a vision of heaven you find them there you find them here the same place excuse me they are always connected with the throne of god that's very important verse 9 and when these beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that son on the throne who liveth forever and ever the four and 20 elders fall down before him and sat on that that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever casting their crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created chapter 5 and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look upon there thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals and i beheld and low in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the elder stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne so this is this gets really interesting as we move into here because now we find in revelations chapter 5 the scene has already been set he sees the beast he sees the throne he sees the one sitting upon the throne and now he sees a book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne and brother branham tells us that this book is the seven sealed book of redemption he tells us it's the book that that holds the mysteries of redemption the mysteries of the entire bible and he said that book was was redemption and so the the book of redemption is interesting because redemption is means to bring back amen or put back in a former condition or to buy back into a former place so it's a book of redemption so in this book are the mysteries or all the information containing redemption now god doesn't need redemption god hasn't fallen from anything god hasn't lost anything god doesn't need any redemption god doesn't need a book of redemption but he's holding a book of redemption and he's holding it waiting for the time that this book of redemption can go back to man because it was originally the inheritance was given to man when it was given to adam to to have dominion and rulership over all of the earth it was given to adam but adam lost the inheritance and so it now it goes back to the original owner and god is now holding this book of redemption it's a book of redemption because in it shows the claims to inheritance and who and who has claims and rights to inheritance hallelujah god is good so now he's holding it and he cries for someone to come and take the book now brother ram tells us there's holy angels there there's all kinds of heavenly hosts there you have the four beasts around the throne you have all of this but none of them can take the book of of redemption because they don't need the redemption it wasn't their inheritance it was the inheritance of man that was lost and so now there must be a man who can buy back what was lost so the only way you could have a man that's worthy to buy back is you have to have a man that comes in a different way than every other man's come because because of hybridization all man is corrupt and therefore no man could pay the price because he has corrupt blood so there must be a man who comes without corrupt blood a man who comes in a perfect condition lives a perfect life fulfills all the law of god then his blood his blood can pay the price of redemption and so that's what happens jesus god comes in the form of jesus christ he creates his own blood amen not jew not gentile but the blood of god comes down and he lives this life so fulfilling all the law there was nothing he ever did wrong no sin he ever committed and that makes him eligible now to be the sacrifice and that's why he's called the lamb and so now there's a cry out for a man and no man in heaven and no man on earth and no man under the earth no one who's ever lived nobody was currently living no one who would live in the future was ever worthy to take this book and john began to weep because john realizes now that this is redemption this is inheritance this is everything but then there was a cry that the lion of the tribe of judah hath prevailed amen and after he prevailed now he's coming forth now this is a this is a huge uh huge event that's taking place here we don't even have time to fully explain it because i want to get into the first seal but but you realize that he has overcome he says he has overcome now we realize that at calvary he paid the price of redemption but after calvary he doesn't go and take the book he goes and he begins to mediate for the sins of the people that he has just redeemed now he's not mediating for the old testament church because the old testament church now when he comes down and pays the price for them they lived a life looking forward to a sacrifice all of their animal sacrifices for substitution was looking forward to a perfect sacrifice so when jesus comes and pays the perfect sacrifice all those who had died under that covenant come forth amen he has just redeemed them so he's not mediating for their sins they're not sinning anymore they've already died all right but then he goes right to work mediating this is this is so i just wish that i could explain it i just wish that that i wasn't a human being right now and i wish you weren't human beings right now and i wish we could just have an eternal connection and that we could have it because this is so critically important that we realize now god is going through these motions and brother branham said these are actors in an act he's acting something out so that we can understand what's happening because in god's mind this is all finished from before the foundation of the world god's not acting it out amen it's acting out through time god it's already finished this is done i don't even understand that completely i just know that that's true so now he's acting out so showing us in the act what he's doing the lamb has been there after paying the price so that he can redeem man but he's been laying back there he's been mediating brother brennan said he's been laying as a high priest as melchizedek laying seven stripes of blood for seven church ages and what was the high priest to do on the day of atonement when he went in to sprinkle blood upon the mercy seat he was covering the sins of ignorance because you have to recognize that in the old testament the high priest would go in amen on the day of atonement and he would offer blood to cover the sins of ignorance because there was already there was already methods for atoning for your sins there was iniquity offerings transgression offerings all of these offerings if you knew you had done wrong you were responsible to take your offering to the temple you were supposed to be repenting all the time coming to this to the substitution of blood you're supposed to be doing that all the time the high priest did not go in for all your sins and for the sins you committed all year that's not what he went in for he went in to cover the things you didn't know about you got that you were responsible to give an offering for the things that you understood were wrong when when god would reveal it out of his word or you would hear it in the synagogue priest or you would read it you would realize you've done wrong and you were obligated to bring a sin offering an iniquity offering a transgression offering a peace offering you were already required under that covenant to do those things but there was there was things yet that they were doing they didn't even realize were wrong and god in his mercy would allow under the substitutionary system would allow a high priest to go in one day a year with blood and on that day he would mediate or he would he would he would he would intercede for and mediate for all the sins that were done into ignorance when they didn't know it was wrong so you can't sit in israel and just live any life you want and say know that the high priest will cover it one day a year that's not what he went in for he didn't go in to cover you he went in to cover your sins of ignorance so important so now jesus he paid the price of redemption it's a perfect blood nothing needs to be added to that price but yet he has something else to do before he takes the book of redemption he has to go back behind the throne and lay seven stripes or seven church ages because he's got to cover the sins of ignorance for the people that are in the book all right the the the original owner is holding the book you know the lamb knows who's in the book but they're seven church ages they don't have a full revelation of the word luther had part of the word but what about the part where luther was swearing and drinking and persecuting the jews and getting caught in politics either he was seed or he wasn't seed he was seed and he had come to the just shall live by faith he had come to the revelated word for his hour and he accepted it he was the church-aged messenger but yet there were sins in his life but because the full word hadn't been revealed yet jesus christ was there covering those sins because the full revelation of the word hadn't come yet this is so important because we're going to understand what 1963 was all about so now he's he's covering so the lamb he paid the price but he has to do the kinsmen work of mediation he's not doing it for the old testament bride that he's already paid the price for them he's mediating for sins they're not sinning anymore so he's doing it for the church ages and he has to stay back there till the last one comes in you ever read that in the seals book well you got to be careful brother branham clarifies that he says he must stay back there till the last one in the last age comes in and when that comes in he stops the work of kinsmen redeemer and he comes around and he takes the book he looses the seals he sends the seals down to church age messenger that's on earth at the time so we know the time of this transition and the work of melchizedek we can see that and why is he moving now because now now he is he is ending remember the mighty angel comes down and he lifts his hand to him that sits on the throne that liveth forever and ever and he says time is no more no longer or delayed no more he makes this statement and brother branham said it's like a roman candle one thing stops then another thing stops but the first thing brother branham says is time no more for denominations that ended for the redemption of the seed that ended the laodicean church age because now there's no more redemption under the pentecost you can't be sealed because the mediator the kinsman redeemer is not behind the throne anymore now in order to come to atonement you must come to the person himself the fullness of the word there's no covering for the sins of ignorance there must be an accepting that this is him this word is true and this message is right something changed something major changed and shifted and now you have to understand what 1963 was all about he has overcome what did he overcome he overcome the sins of ignorance he overcome the deception of the devil he overcome that that the devil would do to wreak havoc in the church ages he has overcome that already how did he overcome it he overcome it by his blood he overcoming his kinsmen redeemer and when he's overcome that now he's going to do something amen that's going to break the deception of the devil and he's going to come and bring a word and what was that word he brought the revelation of the seven seals hallelujah and he either came down or he didn't come down he either transitioned in the work of melchizedek or he didn't transition so now now you have to come that's why brother branham makes such unusual statements after the seals he makes unusual statements like he says now the bride is the blood by the spirit now in order to have the covering of the blood is you have to be sealed by the holy ghost because why because when he returned amen he came in the fullness of his word bringing the fullness of the holy ghost and that seal is atonement that is blood amen you cannot rely now there's no seed of god being redeemed and being sealed in a denominational system that's over that ended amen when he come and he took the book and he loosed the seals now for redemption for redemption you have to leave the denominational system and you have to unite to the person of christ there's no more time for denominational systems it ended right there and from that goes another one and from that goes another one from that goes another one but that ended right there time no more for denominational systems before that you could be sealed under the pentecostal revival you could even maybe live beyond that time i don't know but you were already sealed before that time and a pentecostal revival that's why brother branham said to individuals in their testimony asking about their fathers and all that he said oh he was sealed under another age what age the pentecostal age and when you're sealed you're sealed to the day of your redemption amen so the lamb must stay back there mediating for the sins of ignorance until the last one and the last age comes in and gets sealed now he steps forward and now redemption is time no more amen laodicea is still going on into tribulation but we've been called out of laodicea we've been called out of the pentecostal revival and called into the bride age where we connect with the person himself and for us that is redemption that is atonement connecting with the word the person of the word brings the life of the person of the word and that amen that is the blood that is your blood covering that's why nobody in the denominational system is covered under the blood of jesus christ no matter how much they say it no matter how many scriptures they quote if they don't recognize what happened in revelations chapter 5 they will never understand that there is now no more redemption in those systems there's no more seed coming to a ceiling in those systems now the seed that is part of this scroll that is part of this seven sealed book those names that are in there they must catch the transition come out and connect to the one who took the book and loose the seals and who came down as the mighty angel connecting to that brings you in redemption and seals you all right we've got that we may cover that 10 times 20 more times because it's super important that we recognize brother branham said this is the most sublime passage in all of the scriptures and for us we say absolutely amen because we recognize what happened so now we cannot accept amen living in darkness when light has come we cannot accept living outside the blood when the blood of the person himself with the blood has come amen now there's something that changes so you have to catch the changes or else you're going to be in trouble because when jesus came the first time they had lived under a system of substitutionary sacrifice where you could take a turtle dove or a goat or a sheep or an oxen you could take that and that thing would die in your stead and its blood would cover your sins that was perfectly acceptable that was the word under that under that uh condition or under that age the seed of god were being caught into redemption under that but when jesus christ came now all those substitutes are pointing to a true sacrifice the true sacrifice now comes and now you have this lap over period while he's there but just as soon as he dies he brother branham said it this way when they took the lamb and with wicked hands they crucified the lamb now they put the lamb in full effect they put that word in full of fact and from that point on you could slay thousands of lambs thousands of oxen it would do you no good anymore absolutely no benefit to you anymore whatsoever because now everything that they were pointing to had come he lived the perfect life that he's held up amen showing that he was spotless amen without flaw and then he was taken by the high priest and he was sacrificed and killed now he became the absolute substitute for you and now you have to come and recognize that to be sealed in redemption now the seed of god recognized that but the ones who are not elect not seed they keep slaying oxen they keep slaying sheep they keep there's still blood flowing all the time until god demolishes that temple amen so so now you if you don't catch the transition but don't worry the elective god always catch the transition because the seed have to come to the place where they're redeemed so now we go through 2 000 years and we understand that he's giving seven stripes for seven ages now you have to recognize that he's back there now he's like an actor acting out a play right because god is an eternal spirit he doesn't need a sit seat to sit on he doesn't need a dwelling place you see you understand that he's showing us in typology showing us in a drama what's taking place so that we with our finite minds can somewhat comprehend what he's doing and so he's showing us that he's back there amen laying seven stripes of blood for seven church ages now you have to recognize that the blood stripe for your age was the only place of atonement for your age you couldn't go to the old stripe that was laid back in luther's day because luther was under a stripe luther's age was under a stripe of blood from melchizedek laying down a stripe of his own blood covering the sins of ignorance because the full word wasn't revealed but you couldn't stay in the previous age you had to come under luther's message to be under this stripe because the stripe that had laid down yesterday would not cover you today so then when wesley come on preaching a revival now because wesley's bringing out further light more truth but he doesn't have it all yet the the high priest is back there the lamb laying down a striped bud to cover all the things that he doesn't understand but luther's age you cannot you have to catch the transition you're no longer able to be sealed under under under luther's message and reject wesley's message in the day that the blood was there for wesley's message he was covering for the ignorance of the age but once light has come you cannot stay in darkness you have to come to the light if you walk in the light as he is in the light then you have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ will atone for you but you have to be in the light as he's in the light so now under the pentecostal revival in the late ocean church age he's laying another stripe down because there's seed coming through there the elect of god are catching the transition they're catching the light as the light's measured out they come to the light and they're living in that and they're being sealed in that to a point where that last elect seed in that last age is sealed in under the work of boaz under the kinsman redeemer then after that one he comes forth he takes the book he looses the seals the mighty angel comes down with an open book now everything about that system has changed you can't rely on that system it worked for nearly two thousand years it doesn't work anymore something changed now for redemption you can't rely on boaz working it out at the gate now for redemption you have to unite the boaz himself before before boaz was working it out in the gate amen at the throne at the place of judgment he's working it out because the city gate was always the place of judgment where the elders were so here the lamb is back there laying seven stripes where at the throne at the gate at the judgment bar amen where all the elders are the 24 elders and the four beasts they're all right there he's doing the work of boaz in the city gate amen at the place of judgment he's making he's making amends for ruth but there comes a time that he leaves that and now you can't just say boaz is doing it boaz is doing it you have to connect to boaz now and that's the place of redemption that's the place of atonement that's the blood hallelujah god is so good to us friends this is this is the most sublime passage in all of scripture hallelujah all right let's keep reading i don't even know where i stopped verse 8 i think and he had taken the book and the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden biles full of odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on on the earth and i beheld and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand in thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth forever and ever praise the lord the most sublime passage in all the scriptures now when when this takes place brother branham now after the seals comes and preaches a message called indictment an indictment he talks about the the method of when jesus christ came the word in in full measure when he came in the fullness of flesh they took with wicked hands they took and they crucified the lord of glory and when they did they took that word and put it into full effect thereby abolishing the previous word what worked before won't work now because they took it and crucified it proving that it was the lamb if they didn't crucify it it wouldn't have been the lamb but by crucifying it they proved that it is the lamb hallelujah so in the indictment brother branham says now i indict this generation for the second crucifixion of jesus christ because when he came now in the fullness of his word that's what the mighty angel was coming down for when he came in the fullness of his word and brother branham taught the seven seals and they rejected it the nominations rejected it he says now you have put the word in full effect now the old system is dead nothing's coming to life in the old system nobody's getting sealed in the old system there's no redemption in the old system now it's all in the word that you have crucified and by crucifying it they proved it was the lamb they proved it was the word because they crucified it because they rejected it putting it by rejecting it they put it in position by rejecting jesus christ when he came on earth they put it in position by rejecting christ when he came in the fullness of the word they put it in position and now the only place to have redemption is to connect to that person receive the word for your age receive the revelation of jesus christ in our day that brings us redemption hallelujah brother brahma says in the breach between the church age and the seals now when we go breaking these seals you're going to see it goes plumb back in the scripture all the way back for each one of these seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals every mystery of the bible lays in these seals and the seals cannot be broken until that time boy i tell you what that is amazing if you if you just take face value on the seals and don't dig into it you think he's talking about just a span of time that covers the church ages but he says it goes all the way back and every mystery of the bible lays in these seals why it's a book of redemption so it's got to cover everything that was redeemed from genesis to revelations hallelujah souls that are in prison now but one day he rose from there came forth where was a book at it was still in the abstract owner god almighty and john looked around and he wept because there was no man even worthy to look on the book and especially open the seals to reveal what the hidden mystery was the mysteries was in the seven seals when these seven seals was open that opened up the entire bible oh hallelujah i can't even tell you what that fully means yet but i know it's true that's why i'm saying god grant me a greater revelation what is it you brought lord open my eyes to see it there's more to this than i thought the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and then these seven seals held the entire mystery of it so in order for it to follow the pattern that brother benham laid down it has to be in simplicity we got that this can't be anything mega complicated it's got to be simple if it's not simple it's not right so the the mysteries there the entire bible there's more mysteries in the revelation than what i always understood it was more there but it's got to be in simplicity if it's not in simplicity then it's not so we see that the the seals have been opened in the in the revelation of jesus christ out of the church age book says now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless now what does that the book of revelation the book of revelation shows what the antichrist spirit's going to do and what he did to the church next it exposes what is it the book of revelation the book of revelation exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the desecration of god's word stop right there that's his works period put a dot at the end of it that's all he's doing he's not doing anything else this is what he's doing and what reveals it the book of revelation reveals satan in his words attempted destruction of god's people and the desecrating of god's word how far back does that go in the bible how long has he been trying to destroy god's people and discredit god's word amen so the whole bible was locked up in this book of revelation it shows what the devil's been doing and how he's been doing it and how he intends to do it and when did he start discrediting the word all the way back in genesis and i i'll go back further than that when did he start discrediting god's word he started in heaven and the war that broke out in heaven that's where he started discrediting his word then that battle came down to heaven and he's been doing it ever since that's why the mystery of the entire bible was locked up in the book of revelation locked up in these seals because the whole bible's telling one story one story amen is is being told in the bible don't break it out don't separate it don't make it old testament new testament don't make it jews and gentiles make it one story and then you're going to find out what this is all about so he exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people in the discrediting of god's word now stop oh no let's read the next line right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire so how long is he going to be doing it until he's cast into the lake of fire has he been cast into the lake of fire yet no so that means he's doing this and he's attempting to do it to you every day and what exposes him the book of revelation hallelujah he is still attempting the destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word don't think that oh i saw it in the church ages if he did in the church ages he's trying to do it to you right now whatever he did to eve he's trying to do to you whatever he did to the jews he's trying to do to you whatever he did to the first church age the second church age the third church age he's trying to do it to you because he never changes his ways his tactics don't change amen so don't don't put this off somewhere else we take all of this right home every day satan is trying to destroy you and discredit god's word he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her amen we gotta we gotta slow down we've heard these so many times we go too fast if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her hallelujah how many wants satan to be powerless then we have to have a revelation of two spirits and we have to have the revelation that exposes two spirits and what exposes two spirits the revelation the book of revelation the seven seal book exposes the two vines if they can by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them what is a revelation a proper understanding amen a revelation when a revelation comes to you revelation comes by faith faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of god but you can hear the word of god and hear the word of god and hear the word of god and if god doesn't give you faith to believe it then you don't receive a revelation you can read the bible read the bible read the bible but it takes god to unlock it but when he unlocks it what is revelation a proper understanding right posit you can position the word you understand what it means it's placed correctly and and that that when god brings revelation he brings a proper understanding so we make revelation so mystical so so far away that i've got to have revelation what revelations i don't know i haven't got one yet how do you know when you'll get it what is it what's it going to be what's it going to look like it's always revelation on the word it's a proper understanding a positioning of the word knowing what it means and what its position and what it is for you that's revelation don't make it mystical and far away just receive the word accept the message bring it into your heart and let god quicken it to you and understand what god's trying to get the church to see in this day so we know that there's two vines satan and christ this started the second vine started in heaven but this the second vine is going to have an annihilation one day it's going to end and we read about it through the book all right and the message seed is not there with the shock notice see how close it looks matthew said saint matthew 24 24 said the two spirits in the last days the church spirit of the church people and the bride spirit of the bride people would be so close together until it would deceive the very elect if it was possible that's how close now if you read that and you think denominations and the bride you have missed everything he's trying to teach you it's the church spirit of the church people and the bride spirit of the bride people you could have a church spirit sitting in here to this morning where you're content coming to church saying i believe the message going home but that's about all the effect it has on you is sunday sunday sunday come to church go to church pay tithe that's all right but god has not called us to a church life he's called us to a spirit life he's not called us to attend church and say i go to church and say i believe the message he's calling us to live the token to put the life of christ on display to receive the person himself and let it change our every moment or every day not a sunday wednesday not uncommon morality amen not a not a book of creeds to line up to and i believe the message and therefore i don't wear i don't cut my hair that's not what he's talking about that could be a church life you could you could you could join many many churches you could go to pilgrim holiness churches and you could go to other wesleyan holiness churches where you don't cut your hair and wear a long dress and pay your tithe and try to keep the word and raise your children and subjection you could go to another church and have all that but it's not church spirit it's not church life it's a bride spirit for a bride life for the bride people it is the it is the literal life of jesus christ in your flesh dominating your whole life taking over every moment amen there's not a moment that you're not in the bride spirit that doesn't mean you don't fall or fail but it's not church it's not about church not about church people i've heard so much foolishness going on i get caught up in it myself sometimes thinking wrong thinking in the past but god brings us out and he shows you what he's trying to show you it is supposed to be a mini-membered body the body of jesus christ on earth displaying the full measure of the word i've heard people say before when we go on vacation we let our kids wear this and my wife will wear that because there's no believers around that's a church spirit for a church life amen why do you only dress right for the believers the believers they already know the truth amen they don't need you to display the word they already know the word it's supposed to be the life of jesus christ not just when you're in church or around the believers or in your hometown but you can be on vacation in the most distant remote region in the whole world and you still live the life of jesus christ that's what he's calling us to that's the bride spirit not you can wear pants when we go do this activity because we're not around believers who cares if we're around believers jesus christ is a believer and he's supposed to be everywhere i go amen see the deception deception comes in and reasoning and logic and begins to move us away these two spirits are so close and brother brother bam said they're wound together don't start thinking denominations in the bride don't start thinking bcf in the local pentecostal church you're going to miss it a million miles you've got to say god i don't want a church spirit in me i don't want a church spirit here i want the bride spirit i want the spirit of jesus christ i'm going to flesh out the word i want to live such a life if i was the last human being on the face of this earth that i've got the life of jesus christ i would live what jesus wrote in his word when nobody's looking when nobody's watching amen when i'm at home alone or if it's just me and my family or we're on vacation it matters not where i am or where you find me you're going to find me living the life of jesus christ anything besides that is a church life a church walk and it is a false vine hallelujah praise god that's how close you receive the very elect if it was possible you're not going to deceive the very elect in this day with catholic doctrine with pentecostal doctrine that won't deceive the elect it's got to be a little closer than that to deceive the elect so we find out that there's a battle plan because it started as war in heaven and the wars come down to earth and this whole book is a war it is spiritual warfare being fleshed out and manifest on the earth and the whole book talks about war and so the the book of revelation exposes what the devil's been doing all along but christ is doing something too and that's what we want to pay attention to fourth seal notice what is this all coming to we've just got about 12 14 minutes here i guess look what this is all coming to now he's he's come to the fourth seal he's talking about the last horse rider the one that's going to ride through the tribulation period and he says what is all this coming to he's been through the four horse riders now he's to the to the the one who's riding on the last horse the last last stage going to be incarnate and the beast and the in the tribulation period what's it coming to what is it it's going right back the way it did it started in heaven it's coming to the end time battle so whatever started in heaven it started there it's coming right back to it michael and lucifer again it's coming right back to where it started in heaven that's what all of this is about that's what all of this is leading to this is where we're all coming to right back to that battle in heaven hallelujah the first thing in heaven was a battle lucifer was kicked out and come to the earth then he polluted eden then he's been polluting ever since and now from the battle in heaven it's coming to the battle on earth and it's to be finished on earth at the time in the battle of called armageddon now anyone knows that the battle started in heaven and so they kicked him out michael and his angels overthrew them just run out and when they did dropped right down in eden and there started the battle down here god had his children all fortified up by his word and eve stuck her neck out and i believe you're right maybe and there it went and it's been ever since so now think about this the battle started in heaven lucifer rebelled against god amen so whatever tactics that he's using down here are the same tactics he's used up there just trying to destroy god's people and discredit god's word he tried it there amen he's trying it here he's not changing god's not changing he's not changing it's just repeating over and over and over again that's why when you find the scripture you find the pattern you found the whole thing the pattern always works so he comes down all right and so now they come down and the battle drops down to earth and god knows that the battle is coming to earth he knows lucifer has been kicked out he knows he's coming down and he's got children now in the garden of eden so god doesn't leave the children to their own devices what he does is he builds a fortress for them and he builds a fortress so thick and so high that it's impenetrable and the devil can never get to him lucifer can never deceive him what happened in heaven can never happen again as long as they stay in the fortress god doesn't leave his people defenseless he didn't leave he didn't leave adam and eve there all alone in the garden with with no defense no protection and knowing that lucifer is out roaming around trying to deceive amen dude god didn't think that oh lucifer's kicked out we're done with him now we'll never see him again god knew what was going to happen so god built a fortress he built a tank all right and he put adam and even the tank and they're in the tank and then nothing can beat them nothing could deceive them amen nothing could ever hurt them when they're in the tank but the devil didn't try to take on the tank the devil can't defeat god's armament amen he can't destroy god's weapon he can never come against it so what's he always tried to get the people to do he tried to get them to lose confidence in the weapon and god fortified his children behind the word of god and so the devil doesn't try to take the word on head on what he tries to do is he tries to get eve to lay her weapon down and come out from behind the wall has this tactic ever changed it's never changed brother branham said the devil he's trying he said he's trying to get you to lose confidence in your weapon what is your weapon the sword of the spirit which is the word of god it's the only weapon you've got you don't have another one and he's trying to get you to lose confidence in the weapon because the devil can never defeat the word he can't he's no match he never will he never has he never can defeat the word so the devil tries to get you laid down the word now this is amazing you yourself are no match for the devil you will never ever ever defeat the devil never i don't care how much you jump up and down and yell and stomp and snort and spit and all you're doing is acting out in the flesh and doesn't do a thing to the devil you can yell and scream at him you can call him a liar all you want but it's not going to move him because you yourself can never defeat the devil so god has given you a sword and that sword is the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and the devil can never defeat the sword so the devil knows he can never defeat the sword but he can defeat you any time any place anywhere but brother ben said the word of god will defeat lucifer that will feed the devil any place any time anywhere under any conditions so the devil will never come head to head with the sword he wants you to lay down the sword and lose confidence in it or leave it in the sheath or feel like you're not worthy to take the sword whatever how whatever tactic he can use to keep you from taking the sword because he can never defeat the sword but you can never defeat him see this isn't hard it's easy reasoning science doctors in medicine 401ks credit cards none of that will ever defeat the devil ever but the word so he tries to get you to put confidence in something other than the word and reason he tries to get you to lean on science and not on the word lean on medicine and not on the word lean on your job and not on the word lean on retirement and not on the word and if he can get you to do that he's moved you away from the word and he is just about to obliterate you because you're no match without the sword so so that's where he started in the garden of eden and and god had his children all fortified up but eve stuck her neck out she said i believe you're right maybe and there it went and it's been ever since so in the battle plan the first thing lucifer does is bring a white horse let's read in revelations chapter 6 together i can see now we're not going to get through a fraction of our stuff revelations chapter 6 verse 1 and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see and i saw on behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer so this is the first seal in symbol form that john saul and john recorded for us and we see the symbology here and he went forth on a white horse and and he had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer him so we find out he has a bow but no arrows brother brennan brings that out in the seals and he receives a crown so he doesn't come with a crown but he receives a crown and his whole purpose is to conquer all right now we'll just let the cat out of the bag and then just pick up the pieces later how is he going to conquer when he has no dominion or authority he has no crown he has a bow but no arrows so how is he going to conquer he's coming to conquer but if you send me out to conquer and you don't give me a weapon and you give me no authority how in the world i'm going to conquer so the only way this white horse can conquer is through deception because he has no weapon that can hurt you he has no authority over you he doesn't have a crown he has a bow but no arrows he can't hurt you he has no authority over you there's nothing he can do to you so he has to come but his whole purpose is to conquer so if he's going to conquer the only way he can conquer is through deception he said who is that white horse rider you're not blind you see who it is it's that antichrist and that deceitful spirit that's gone now and crept in praise the lord now let's breathe in the first seal the rider has no arrows for his bow did you notice he had a bow but there's nothing said about having any arrows so he must be a bluffer notice he look he starts out to conquer notice he has no crown the white horse rider i'm speaking of here a bow and a crown was given him afterwards see he had no crown to start with but a crown was given to him look at this one a white horse rider went out who is he he's mighty in his conquering power look at this he's mighty in his conquering power but he has a bow with no arrows and no crown but he's mighty in his conquering power but his power doesn't come from authority and his power does not come from a weapon his power comes from deception that's why he's on a white horse because in revelations 19 you see christ coming back riding on a white horse that's why this false vine wants to be so close that you can hardly tell the difference he's mighty in conquering power he wants you want me to tell you who he is he's the antichrist that's exactly what he is now because you see if if jesus said that the two would be so close together to deceive the very elected the bride if it was possible antichrist is the antichrist spirit so i want to i want to read let's read out of 2 thessalonians chapter 2 together everybody turn in your bibles second thessalonians chapter 2 verse 3 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and the man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worship so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is gone so where is the devil trying to get to not a bar room not a ball field that's not where he's trying to get he's trying to get to the temple of god and sit on the throne of god and declare that he is god he wants to be worshiped by like god so so he'll take any kind of false worship he can take verse five remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now you know what withholded that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only who who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way so you can find that this mystery was already working in the first church age and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the brightness uh no consumed with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all wonders and signs and lying wonders with all deceivableness of unrighteousness and them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved what did they not receive a love of the truth it didn't mean they didn't hear the truth but they didn't have a love of the truth so you have to receive the love of the truth doesn't that's why intellectualism will never work intellectualism in the message will never work but you must receive the person of the word receive the love of the truth all right so with all deceivableness of unrighteousness and them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause god shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness brother branham when he reads this passage he said believe a lie brother rem says it should be translated here i looked it in the lexicon the lie not a lie the lie the same one he told eve so brother branham comes right back and says it's not elia it's it's the lie and what's the lie it's the same lie he told eve what was the lie he told eve surely not i mean i know god said that but not for you not the way you think i mean you're a child of god you're you're you come out of adam you're you're one of the chosen you're one of the elected i mean surely god wouldn't cast you to hell god wouldn't destroy you god wouldn't let you die same line then one lie the lie is these things don't matter hallelujah brother bram says in the second seal notice wisdom and smartness they said now looky here isn't it only sensible that are women what difference does it make how they wear their hair but the bible says it does make a difference just take that one thing besides the hundreds of others see it does make a difference god said it made a difference so it's a difference so that shrewdness comes in and it doesn't make a difference and the bible said it makes a difference brother member said it makes a difference but the shrewdness will always try to compromise he didn't want eve to reject god he never asked eve to reject adam he never asked eve to disbelieve all the word he asked her to compromise on the word in the message one that's brother bram said now when adam and eve listened to the lie of the devil the holy image of god left them their fellowship was broken with god their fellowship of oneness with god was broken the very minute they listened to the lie of the devil that broke their fellowship and the very minute that you listen to the lie of the devil it'll break your fellowship the very minute you i we listen to the lie of the devil it will break your fellowship that doesn't mean you can't repent that doesn't mean you're not in redemption that doesn't mean anything but the minute you listen to that compromising spirit you break your fellowship that's the very minute you go out from the presence of god like she did is when you fail to take god's word just as it is you see the devil is trying under this white horse rider to bring in compromise or a slight deviation from the truth and that's how he started in the first church age he didn't he didn't try to start up other organizations and other churches and deny the faith and all he just tried a little subtle uh saying became deeds of the nicolaitans he wasn't starting a doctrine it's just a saying this is just something we do it can't hurt anybody it's a bow with no arrows it's a rider with no crown how can this hurt it's just something we do it's just our family tradition this is just something how can this hurt if it's different than what the prophet said it will hurt brother ben said in case you're wondering about that i'm going to go to a quote brother ben i'm saying in the token now if you doubt that at all go listen to the token if you doubt all these little things matter go listen to the token he says don't just come this far and say i believe the message oh praise god so we know that that that the greatest evidence brother venom said i know of is being able to receive the word for your day that's the greatest evidence of the holy ghost but he's not talking about receiving it here he come to preach the token to get us to recognize it's not being able to say i believe he says you can say i believe every word of he said that's just being able to read but he came amen amen the message did not come to to bring an understanding where you say i agree with all those doctrines i agree with all that truth and the token he's telling you it's not agreeing it's living it's the life of jesus christ it's taking the word and living it out he said don't just come this far and say i believe the message you obey the messenger well that's brother brenham's opinion he says you obey the messenger hallelujah come in to christ well i believe every word said brother that's good but that's just being able to read take the message take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in christ be in you when i see that i will pass over you outside of that there's not redemption claims made yet outside of taking the message into your heart not reasoning it not trying to find out what brother van was right or wrong not trying to correct the prophet or say that's his opinion or that doesn't apply today or that was for another time none of that will work you obey the messenger you come into christ you take that whole word inside and then you live the whole life of jesus christ and it's not a life that you live it's a life that he lives in you but you're never going to get there with compromise the moment you begin to deviate from what's been taught to us in this age you break your fellowship with god and the horse rider begins to ride in your life this isn't about the church ages it is he taught us accurately what happened in the church age the seals cover the churches accurately but it's about more than that it's about understanding how lucifer is trying to penetrate your fortress every day it's about how he's trying to come to your home to your house to your mind and he's knocking on your door trying to come in and he doesn't show up as a black horse he doesn't come hooded as the grim reaper hey can i come in today nobody nobody in their right mind he came in to deceive the elect if it was possible that wouldn't even deceive a nominal believer in the presbyterian church he doesn't come as the red horse rider he doesn't come as the white horse rider he doesn't come in the pale horse he comes in the white horse and he comes harmless a bow with no arrows i'm not going to hurt you it started as a saying in the first church age what harm is there in talking about it [Laughter] he started just talking to eve just reasoning a little bit what's wrong with you know debating a little bit i'm just talking about these things white horse rider the white horse now these horses you have to understand are anointings or powers there's not four different writers although we say all the time horse riders brother brimston horse riders but he made it really clear there's only one horse rider and he's changing horses so if this is the black battle plan we have to understand his goal is not to stay on the white horse his goal is to change horses and change horses until he finally winds up on the pale horse which is spiritual death eternal separation from god that's the goal that's where he wants to go every time so when he comes in with when he comes to you with a bow and no arrows and he's not wearing a crown he comes as innocent as though he can't hurt you how can i hurt you i'm non-threatening it's just a saying it's just a thought it's just something to think about it's it's it's not that bad nobody knows that's the power anointing of the white horse and remember he only starts riding the white horse so that he can eventually be on the pale horse his whole works is the destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word that's his whole works he's not going to knock on your door and say i'm lucifer how are you having a nice day he comes in on a white horse as close to christ as he can look but brother brenham said he said this horse that this writer remembers the same writer all the way through so he it's not changing riders changing horses or anointings or modes of operation but he's going to start in your life in septility and cunningness and craftiness and deception looking good looking right but his goal is to get to the pale horse to have you eternally separated from god good news is those whose names are on the on the lamb's book of life sealed under that scroll will never be separated from god but he comes in with subtility and he comes in seemingly good but it's a it's always just a little different just a slight deviation from the word just a reasoning just a surmising just a a figuring and his goal is to take you off now you realize when he comes to you he has no crown and he has no weapon he actually can't do anything to you when you know your position when he comes in as a compromiser and he comes in with seduction he can't do a thing to you but in the first church age brother branham says in the first church age he was given a crown who gave him the crown in the first church age he said the pope was eventually crowned as the head of the church who was it that gave him the who gave him the crown the church and when the horse when the horse rider comes into your life and the white horse and compromised amen you're the one who puts the crown on his head he has no authority whatsoever over you but when you open the door and let him ride in your life you put the crown on his head and now he begins to dominate your life what started off as a subtle difference what started off as just a little different than the message now after he comes in you put a crown on his on his head and he begins to dominate your life praise god so what are we watching for are you watching for a guy with a fork stick wearing a red suit and little horns you're watching for anything different than the pure word of god anything different than the absolute truth of god oh praise god now let's whoever's brought their seal book we can open up seal books if you didn't i'll read to you we should read it silently to punish all those who don't have the steel books but we won't do that because we're loving amen i'm just kidding first seal let's go to paragraph 21. you know i told you before that oftentimes brother branham when the first few minutes of preaching you see he gives you a preview of what the whole seal is about and so this is this is a good one here and in the first seal early on when he's when he just starts to preach in paragraph 21 on page 107. he says brother vale brother leave veil i think he's here we were talking the other day about people who getting people who are getting off track it's just like shooting a target if that gun is perfectly balanced perfectly trained and sighted it's got to hit the target unless the barrel moves or twists or vibration throws it off or a wind puff wherever it starts off at there is only one way to do it is to come back to where it left track and start again if it's going to hit the target if it doesn't why it just doesn't hit the target we want to hit the target but what the devil's trying to do is get us a slight deviation off and if he can get you back here just ever just a fraction of a millimeter i mean so much you can never see it with your eye you could adjust it if you had your gun clamped in a gun stand clamped in a gun vise and you had it dead on at 250 yards pull the trigger dead on all you have to do is turn that little nut one time and nobody will be able to see that it's any different whatsoever you can't see it you can't tell it's such a small change back here that surely it's not significant but fire that garden in 250 yards you're going to find out what a big difference that is because he's called us to the pure life and the pure word the pure word's been restored to us and he doesn't want us to compromise anymore he doesn't want us to deviate from it he wants us to line up to the message and then you pull the trigger it hits pull the trigger hits pull the trigger it hits and when we start pulling the trigger and it's not hitting we got to come back to how are we lined up to the message of the hour how are we lined up to this word this prophet came and he restored back to us the full word of god but he showed us how to live in the day that we're living in he showed us how to fight devils how to stay true to the word he demonstrated in his life he preached it over and over and over again and we're expected to line to it and if you line to it and you stay lined to it that white horse rider will never start writing in your life he'll never start from day one and if he never starts then you always hit the target but what the devil trying to do through subtility cunning craftiness just a slight change seemingly insignificant and it doesn't really matter oh praise god in the first seal let's go to paragraph 77. page 115 paragraph 77 we'll find out in a minute it even worked in the name of a church they call themselves the church and you just see if it isn't right no wonder i've been so against the nomination not knowing why they end up now it starts back here in a mild form and it just keeps getting worse and worse on down and the people go right into it saying oh yes this is just fine but in the last days these things are made known so the problem is he tries in a mild form to get you to take something that's different than what the messenger brought and then and then he wants to get worse and worse and worse until you get down here and all along he wants the people say oh that's just fine it's just fine it doesn't matter it's not a big deal it it has no arrows it can't hurt me that's the deception paragraph 131 it's not paragraph 131 paragraph 134 sorry now remember it wasn't russian no the antichrist is a smooth fella just watch how smooth he is he is smart now yes sir just takes the holy spirit the only thing that can outdo him there's nothing else you cannot tangle with this deception only the holy ghost and the holy ghost always lines up to the word praise god brother ben said i'll just quote this one to you god has promised that when the word is refused then they are turned to their desires now you have to recognize that though that that old cockleburst sticky nature is always hovering over you trying to get you to go wrong again amen and when we refuse the word that old nature is going to begin to influence again and so so when you refuse the word you're just turned to your desires and romans 1 28 says and even as they did not like to retain god and their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient why did they get turned over to reprobate mine they did not like to retain god in their knowledge there's a couple here i want to read together second seal let's turn over to the second seal paragraph 118 paragraph 118 page 173 now christ comes into the antichrist comes into light gradually i want you to notice this now to my catholic friends just sit still just a minute now and we're going to see where the protestants where we all are see notice the first church when the catholic church says they were the first the original church they're exactly right they were they began at pentecost that's where the catholic church began now i once didn't hardly believe that until i read history and i found that it's right they began at pentecost but they began to drift and you see where they're at so you see brother branham is laying these these horse these horse powers in this horse rider over the church ages and he's showing that the catholic church started out right it started out true it started out correct but through subtility through the white horse not the black horse not the red horse not the pale horse but through the white horse they were deceived and starting in another direction ever so slightly different but by the time you get down in the church ages you recognize that we stand here today and you can see what that church system is it's nothing like what it started at and what started it down the wrong road it was a very slight difference from truth very subtle difference from truth now we've got to take this home we've got to bring this right to our lives we have to say this is me amen the church ages was fine but this is exposing the works of satan and me and if i've got compromise in my life i need to go rooted out and repent and cast that thing out of my life because the goal is spiritual separation from god spiritual death is the goal the goal of compromise is death not compromise the devil doesn't he's not after you to live in compromise he's trying to get you to compromise to go to death he's trying to destroy god's people and discredit god's word his end goal is not compromise he starts in compromise the end goal is death he's not your friend he's not trying to get you to have more fun amen he's trying to destroy your life in the second seal paragraph 160. yeah paragraph 160. now the natural first bride of the human race before her husband came to her she fell from grace by listening to satan's lie and after god had for fortified behind his word if she would have stayed behind the word she would have never fell now that's the natural notice the natural woman and what was the curse the actual curse of coming out from behind god's word now we talk about hybridization and the original sin being sex in the garden but actually what cursed them was denying god's word this belief the the only sin is still the only sin the only sin is disbelief unbelief is sin what was sex act and hybridization it was fruits of the sin but the actual curse they weren't cursed because of sex they were cursed because of disbelief in god's word and if that worked for adam and eve what do you think will happen to us if we disbelieve doubt reason with one of god's word and and brother bam said this whole curse came from disbelieving one of god's words one one of his commandments how are we going to get back having one wrong that's what brother branham tells us we've got to line up why did the message come to line up a bride to dress a bride in the garment of the word amen it was the prophet who saw the preview of the bride and in the preview of the bride he sees a perfect bride coming by and my she's glorious and everything's just right and then he sees another one and he looks at the worldly church amen and he sees this worldly church led by a witch totally undressed marching to the time of twisting rock and roll music and she's going off into destruction and his heart's broken because he thinks this is the best that i've produced for the lord and then he hears music playing again onward christian soldiers and he sees another bride coming just like the first bride and she's marching and everything's just right but at the end time at the very end he sees two that are getting out of time out of rhythm with the march amen and what were they doing they were watching the worldly church they had their eyes now when they came by the stand the preview stand brother branham was there amen and the angel of the lord was over his right shoulder and whenever they came by the preview stand they looked at him but there's two in the back looking at something else they're looking at the worldly church going into destruction and they're getting out of time and the prophet wakes up in his bed screaming get back in step get back in step what is he calling what's the message calling for us it wasn't just to teach us the seven seals it was to get us back in step amen it was to put us in that perfect bride in line and step with the world and what do we have to be looking at you have to be looking at the angel of the lord and the prophet you cannot be ignoring this message and know how to live there's absolutely no way you're going to be an overcomer in this day if the only quotes that you hear are the ones that are read here on sunday and wednesday you will never overcome lucifer you will never defeat him that bride was in preview and when they crossed they were watching what was on the platform not the worldly church we we have to be careful that we line up to the message line up to the word the devil's trying to get us to any distraction anything from looking at this word sunday and wednesday religion will not put you in the rapture it's not going to work friends it's got to be a whole life a whole selling out an absolute surrender a complete death to self and there's a feeding on the word of god feeding on the message of the hour until it changes our lives until we invite it into our lives and we recognize that the prophet says something and i've been doing something else god changed my life i repent forgive me o god and line me back to your word that is the only way that this bride is going to overcome if not amen if not you deviate and we've seen people who deviate ever so slightly by reasoning of the word amen and if you watch their lives 10 15 20 years later they don't look anything like even a nominal christian having atheistic views or are human humanistic views and not even believing the word of god anymore what started it a slight deviation from the truth and what is truth the message of this hour is truth don't reason it believe it accept it invite it into your life ask god to give you overcoming power by a spirit paragraph 161 we read and what was the curse the actual curse of coming out from behind god's word and now remember she believed about 98 of it but you just have to let one thing go see she believed a whole lot of it oh certain she said this and satan would admit that it was right if he can just get you on one corner that's all he wants the only thing you have to do is give the bullet a little twist this way and it'll miss the target remember how he started back in paragraph 21 give the bullet a little twist this way and it'll miss the target that's all now she believed so much of it but yet missed it now and the result because she left the word for one little speck of reason brothers and sisters if it worked then it'll work now if it took it took out the children of god then it'll take out the children of god now it'll bring you down it'll bring you it'll it'll break your fellowship with god it'll put you in a condition that you don't want to be in your life will be out of harmony out of step with the word out of kilter with what god is doing why because we're watching something other than what we're supposed to be keeping our eyes on we're not supposed to watch the worldly church or the things of the world or anything that has to do with the world we're supposed to be living a consecrated sold out separated life amen let's go to ii corinthians see before i read this i just want to explain the problem in denominational systems the problem with churches and humans and everything under the sun is is is that we've adjusted truth based off experience now truth can't be adjusted if it's truth truth is an absolute it's a matter of fact it's unchangeable we got that and so you can't adjust truth but the problem is truth has been adjusting all along in churches so there was a standard in the nazarene church back a hundred years ago and now there's been a standard and that standard was holiness they were under the wesleyan movement they come out of the wesleyan church age there was a standard and that was truth and they could show it to you in the scriptures under sanctification but now that was the standard but now if you go into a nazarene church the standard is down here now if that was truth is this truth which is truth how did truth change truth can't change so why are we adjusting truth it doesn't work so you can see it all around when i grew up as a boy in the pentecostal church there were still quite a few women in our church that wouldn't cut their hair war dresses all the time and they weren't allowed to wear pants into the sanctuary that's when i was a boy and i remember as a young man i was young married still going to that same church that i grew up in and i remember when the women put pressure on the pastor amen during the bible school saying we need to wear pants we can't do activities with the kids and dresses and skirts and i remember when he caved in and they all showed up in pants so why were you wearing skirts and dresses before if it wasn't true why were you doing something that wasn't true if it wasn't the bible why were you doing it right they've adjusted truth based off the worldly church based off the world based off the culture truth has been adjusting right we have to be careful in the message we don't do the same thing that we don't adjust holiness we don't adjust our standard fashions can change holiness doesn't it floral print solid color i don't care it matters not to me thin tie thick tie i could care less but the holiness doesn't change because the fashions change fashions can't change holiness if we wouldn't do this before if we wouldn't have a television in our house before because the prophet said kick it out how come we'll have one now what changed and you can say well because i don't have children in the house anymore brother branham never referenced that based off whether he had children in the house or not he said when he preached the token he said throw out your magazines throw out your short skirts throw out your shorts throw out your television so now we won't have a television but we'll get netflix television and bring it on our computer what's the difference he told us to separate from the world total separation god calls for total separation from all unbelief brother branham never preached it any different he didn't preach compromise he was going to compromise he was going to let billy paul put a television in his house brother brandon explains this but the angel of the lord stopped him and told him not to if the angel of the lord told him not to then why have we brought it into our homes why why is the standard changed has truth changed is truth ever changing truth shouldn't change if it's true it should always be true we should be lining up to that word lining up to that message amen why what's the devil trying to do slight deviation from the truth it doesn't matter it's under control it's not it's different than what the prophet taught is it different than what the prophet taught if it's different than what the prophet taught i don't want it because i'm not smart enough to figure out if it's good or not amen if he told us to stay away from things stay away from him amen if he told us to do things let's do it if he told us to take the message in our hearts take the message into our hearts if he told us to obey the messenger then we obey the messenger we got to quit fooling around but all these things are are meant to distract us and bring us if he can get you on one corner then he can get you to lose the whole thing what is it it's the white horse friends none of us there's not one of us are going to fall for the red horse or black horse not one of us are going to fall for the pale horse spiritual separation but over and over that white horse comes knocking on your door that's the one you're tangling with all the time that's the antichrist spirit that you're fighting constantly all day every day slight deviation slight reasoning acceptance of something we wouldn't accept before what is it he's trying to get us to accept something we would not accept before and and he's trying to dupe us why he's always working where god's throne is where is his throne his throne is in you and i don't think you're immune from the attacks of the antichrist he'll come every day of your life as a white horse as innocent as harmless with a bow with no arrows and not wearing a crown but we've got a method to overcome him let's talk about that in just a second here i think i had everybody turned to i was going to anyways let's turn to paragraph 137 and the second seal go back just a couple pages paragraph 137 you can't make them scriptures lie they're going to be truthful always the only thing don't try to line your thought up to the script or the scriptures up to your thought but line yourself up with the scriptures that's when you're running with god no matter how much you have to cut away or lay aside line up with that and that'll that'll shave us right down friends i think i had you turn to second corinthians did we ever read that thank you guys thank you second corinthians chapter six i love it when the class is paying attention second corinthians chapter six verse fourteen be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what concord hath christ with belia or what part hath he with the that believeth with an infidel in what agreement has the temple of god with idols for for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they will be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean and i will receive you that's the cry that went out in revelations 18 and talking about the the the false church and the false systems says come out my people and be not partakers of her sins we're not supposed to be mingling at all we're supposed to be separated now you can't leave the world paul talked about this in the in the gospels he said you would have to leave the world but not leaving the world but being separate in the world let's look at revelations chapter 2. let's look at the admonition to the ephesian church age the first church age when this horse first began to ride was in revelations chapter 2. unto the angel of the church of the of ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and as born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted this church was doing a very good job their work was good their labors were good their patients they were judging false apostles they were doing excuse me they were doing a fantastic job they had been patient for his name's sake they labored and has not fainted verse 4 nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and i will remove thy candlestick albert's place except thou repent now this church was doing a good job they were doing a very good job they were they had works they had patience they were judging apostles and casting them out but he had someone against them because they had left their first love and he says go back to your first love do you remember when you went through first coming to the message those who were outside and come to the truth that was your first love and the scripture says do the first works we got duped friends and people calling that our legalistic face that wasn't our legalistic phase that was our first love and some people in the message have come along and said remember when you through your legalistic phase oh it's better now that you'll reason on the word and allow things in that the prophet didn't allow you you've grown a little bit in the lord and you've come to a position now where you can discern for yourself you don't have to exactly toe the line anymore brothers and sisters that wasn't your legalistic phase that was your first love you were so in love with him you didn't want anything of the world you would throw out things you would separate you would do whatever what is that that's your first love and then the white horse rider the antichrist spirit come in and taught us how to compromise taught us how to reason taught us how to justify things we would have never justified when we first came to the message and he says repent and do the first works that's not your legalistic phase that's your first love i think it's time we repent and come back to our first love and repent and do the first works i think it's time to throw out worldly influences throw out food from the false vine friends that you remember that that that last church in preview was watching the false vine the false church and we have been duped into accepting fruit from the false vine listening to their music singing their songs watching their movies that does not come from the true vine that doesn't come from the true vine it comes from the knowledge of the tree of good and evil so on that is a hybrid a mix there is some good and there is some evil but why do you want to drink out of a contaminated well when there's a pure river of life flowing clean there's two wells i told this to the young people friday night you've got two wells in this well it's good and bad some people drink it and get sick some people drink it and have no problem some people drink it and they're fine some people get it drinking sick and some have even died now here's a well this is certified tested and pure and everybody who gets this gets stronger and healthier drinking out of this one you pick which one you want to drink from i want to watch the little love movie that's christian i want to listen to my favorite band my favorite group and you look on the album you know they're not led by the holy ghost there's no holy ghost leadership in their life you can tell by the way they're dressed painted up earrings men with long hair the artwork on it comes from the occult but there's one nice song i don't care if there's two nice songs i don't want to drink from a well that's sometimes good sometimes bad when we've got 1200 sermons 1200 sermons preachers all over the world that you can watch you can download you can stream you've got the message on your phone you've got the message on a tablet we've got the message and we want to watch love movies coming from the false vine and we want to watch uh feel good things and movies and and watch music videos and listen to music coming from the false vine i say total separation from unbelief i don't want to taint my mind with something that comes from the false mind and i know it comes from the false mind i know the source i want to keep my mind pure how we've got the word we've got the scriptures we've got thus saith the lord on the word why are we polluting our mind it's the white horse friends not the white horse in ephesus the white horse right here right in my house right in my little entertainment console right next to my computer what is it it's the white horse where's your favorites page on your on your internet go look on your favorites page and see if there's any white horses there what takes all our time why is it we're not in the word because we play video games and we read nonsense books we read we read what's romance novels with a christian label oh my goodness friends throw away the trash that's what brother brennan preached in the token go back this week and listen to the token and you tell me if i'm right or wrong tell me if i'm being legalistic telling i'm being too hard go listen to the token and you listen to every word he says and you tell me whether this is nothing but the truth the gospel of jesus christ to keep a bride virgin and pure and clean and bringing her to the rapture see we forget so many times we've we've grown up in this world and we've got these senses that that drag us back into this society we're not born for this society we're not born for this world we weren't placed here just to operate in life we were placed here to take a body change we were put here at this generation at this time to receive the full word without measure and the full life that goes with it to take a rapture to get a perfect word for a perfect faith for a perfect rapture why are we still mingling it with other seed throw it out throw it out and say god i want a pure word a perfect word for a perfect faith for a perfect rapture when we begin to accept things off the false vine and we begin to deviate from what the messenger told us that we believe begin living different than the token message then we're being influenced by the white horse so what do we do god sent another power the reverend says now satan raises those watch the shrewdness of this fellow we're talking about here we're unfolding him right here just stripping him down by the scriptures and letting you see who he is you may feel a little stripped down i've been stripped down by this word we all get stripped down by this word you may be here feeling like you're overexposed and been stripped down it's not you that stripped down we're stripping the white horse the antichrist spirit that is trying to run in your life that's who's being stripped down let him get stripped down don't you get stripped down strip him down expose him in your life call him out for what he is say this is the influence of the white horse i taught this in my family we had a family devotion and and we did the devotion and everybody went to bed and i go up and my little boys nine and 11 years old had a stack of books and we had we had little books it was a abridged children's versions of classics they had a stack here of abridged children's version of old classic novels and my boy said dad that's the white horse rider we got to throw it away what was it wizard of oz full of magic and nonsense books like that full of things love stories things that shouldn't be in there i never noticed it i overlooked it but i taught it to my family my little boys rooted it out they had a stack laying there and i carried it out to the garbage and threw it away i was ever so happy i would have left it right there because i didn't i wasn't even thinking about it but they saw it they exposed it they kicked it out you can teach this to your children they want to know they're not hungry to live like the rest of the world you tell them their position in christ you tell them they're born into your family for a reason they've heard this message for a reason if they can accept it and believe it with all of their heart then they're going to go on a rapture because they're children of god's seed of god planted here for an end time victory to defeat the devil you tell me those kids won't get inspired by that they don't want the world they want to be overcomers they want something different than the false and the phony and the charades that go on in life they want a reality give them a reality don't give them the white horse we're stripping him down by the scriptures letting you see who he is what's supposed to be done and you remember he's not trying to go in to be a communist satan hasn't he's an antichrist so close that jesus said would deceive the very elected remember this white horse is not trying to deceive the pentecostal church they're already deceived this antichrist spirit is trying to deceive you trying to deceive me firstly it says that's the white horse rider the way of white righteousness church but an antichrist it got to look like on a horse even just like christ coming on a horse see friends has got to look good it can't look bad to be deceptive it's got to look good it's got to look okay and it's got to look christian but christian by title does not mean it doesn't come from the false vine it doesn't mean it's not polluted with hybrid seed and hybrid thought it has to be christian we don't want christian by appearance we want christian by birth by pure word by pure life christ is coming on a horse and close so close to see the very left here he is he's the antichrist he started writing in the first age now he rides on down on down through every age watch him but there was another anointing that was sent different from the antichrist anointing and this was the anointing from christ yes and the physio says now as the antichrist went forth on a beast of ministry there god went forth a beast to combat it oh who wants to combat the white horse this morning we realize i've let him in i want him out i i've been deceived i don't want to be deceived anymore he's been knocking at my door he's been inching his way in but i'm finished with him then what you need is a good dose of the lion anointing when every time the beast rode on a horse the antichrist rode his horse on this beast to announce his ministry god sent his beast also in his own mass to announce his combat to it now the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises a standard against it and so when the enemy went out as an antichrist god sent a certain type of power out to meet him when he went out again as a red horse rider another color another power another ministry god sent another one after him to combat it to hold his church sent the third one again god sent his third beast to come and announce it he sent the fourth one remember now when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises up a standard that doesn't mean that the enemy will never come to you like a flood it doesn't mean that you will never be tempted by the white horse again but god will raise a standard against the white horse hallelujah that's the one i like i'm tired of talking about that white horse let's talk about the lion question and answers on the seals in the days of paul the angel the church of ephesus paul founded the church being the messenger to it remember paul founded the church at ephesus become the messenger to that church and the spirit was in the land at that time was a lion spirit and the lion is the lion of the tribe of judah which is christ and christ is the word paul with the word of that age so what is the lion anointing it's christ the word what has returned in this day the word in measure or in fullness and fullness so do we have a line anointing oh we can combat the white horse rider with the lion anointing because we have thus saith the lord on the scriptures we have the what was in the back part of the mind of god has been revealed through a prophet we know what the word means we know how he wants us to line up to it we know what the holiness standard is by the scripture not because we figured it out or reasoned it but because we've had a divine interpreter of the word on the scene who will point us back to the pure meaning of the pure word the same as paul taught it and we can take that same pure word and we can roar like a lion and remember the white horse has no crown he has no arrows he can't do anything to you until you let him in and put a crown on his head so what do you do when the white horse knocks on your door you roar like a lion what is the roar of the lion the pure word christ the word doth not the word say see jesus was tempted in the wilderness and the antichrist spirit came to him too he was led of the holy ghost into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and he left us an example and every time that the devil would come in temptation he was bringing the word the devil came with reasoning on the word doth not the scripture say that you dash thy foot against the stool he'll lift thee up cast thyself down he's quoting the scriptures but he's adding reasoning to it he says then and jesus said doth not the scriptures say what did he do he took the revelation of the word in its proper place the devil brought the word but he misplaced it somebody might bring you a quote that shows you certain activities are okay they can misplace it the white horse uses quotes if you use the word with jesus would he not use the message against you absolutely but you've got to catch his cunning deception he's trying to get a quote and he's pulling it out i mean there may be a hundred quotes that say it straight one way and one quote that kind of could mean this way which quote do you think he's going to show you oh he's a deceiver but we're not going to be the seed because we're going to take the word the whole word we're going to be listening to tapes reading books being in fellowship we're going to be so full of the pure word that when the devil comes anything contrary to that will roar like a lion and say that's not what the prophet said that's not what the scriptures say hallelujah if you come to jesus with the word he'll try to come to you with the word if he tried to misrepresent the scriptures and use reasoning he'll do the same thing with the scriptures he'll do the same thing with the quotes don't think that he won't he absolutely will the lion of spirit in the sixth seal he says now see if you can get back here under the seals it when they're opened you can see exactly what god is doing what he has done what he is going to do here it is exactly and that's the reason men acts that way because that spirit that's predicted for that age to be on them they couldn't do nothing else john paul in them the lion spirit the word itself the word itself is a lion spirit and when the enemy comes in as a white horse you can take the pure word and you can cast him out the lion is the pure word which is christ which is paul's teaching brother branham brought us back to the original faith of the pentecostal fathers amen brother branham told us that the book of acts was not the framework for the christian church the book of acts was the measure by which every church should attain to it wasn't it was the example church it was not the framework and that's why we had to be restored back to that truth and back to that faith you know what will corrupt that faith compromise deviation from the truth accepting the white horse will absolutely destroy what god has tried to do in this age so in the battle plan when lucifer comes in with compromise deviation from the word we go right back to the pure word we do exactly what jesus did when he was tempted in the wilderness he'll come in and he'll say well what about this or what about that or don't you think or you know this isn't the same kind of time things have changed you go right back with god said the prophet said god vindicated it he backed it up i believe it and i'm going to measure up to the message of the hour i'm gonna measure up to the word that's been restored and if you do that he'll never have a crown and he'll never have no arrows and he has no authority whatsoever over you he can't hurt you he's an absolute bluff and he has zero authority don't let him in and don't put a crown on his head you take the word that god has restored and you throw the word back in his face and if you resist the devil the devil will flee let's all stand musicians if you could come there's a lot that i didn't read and we might get to it maybe on wednesday i don't know just pray we want to see the devil's full tactics exposed all the way through and we want to find out how god combats it we want to find out what anointing you find out today that you've allowed a white horse you say god give me more of your word put it in my mind put it in my heart wash me by the water of the word and give me the power to resist compromise brother branham says in the church age book when he's speaking in the ephesian church age he said the very name ephesus has a strange compound meaning it means aimed at and relaxed remember your first love remember your legalistic face how many of us aimed at and then relaxed how many of us went through ephesus i'd venture to say all of us have went through ephesus i've been through ephesus you've been through ephesus aim that and relaxed but god hasn't called us to aim at and relaxed he's called us to press towards the mark of the high calling in christ jesus he's told us to grow into the head in all things which is christ he's supposed to grow in the knowledge and understanding of our lord jesus christ he's told us to keep going forward we've never been told to relax yes aimed at and relaxed the high aspirations of this age that had begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of god whereby they were aiming at the high calling of god began to give way to a less watchful attitude i say oh god that was me i went through ephesus a less watchful attitude a less ardent following of jesus christ began to manifest manifest itself as an omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called the church would sink to the awfulness of the depth of satan it had become relaxed and was now drifting he says further in the church age book about ephesus he says the fervent desire to please god the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade oh brothers and sisters that washes me right out that strips me down and says god i'm sorry this is why i've been repenting this is why i've been crying out to the lord this is why i've been rising early this is why i'm reading my the message around the clock because i found that ephesus came to me aimed at and relaxed i allowed somebody to convince me that i should grow out of my legalistic face remember legalism is not obeying the word fully obeying the word is not legalism legalism is believing that somehow by obeying the word god will accept you and save you and fill you with the spirit even though he gives the spirit to them that obey him see obedience is required it is mandated and disobedience has never been accepted in the bible ever he has always expected full obedience any time there was not full obedience and god doesn't call obedience legalism legalism is believing that you can do something to put yourself into grace that's legalism are doing something to gain extra favor with god outside of his grace that's legalism fully obeying the word is not legalism and i failed when i let somebody convince me that i needed to mature out of my legalistic phase oh my goodness i should have matured in my legalistic phase not legalism but full obedience a desire a passionate desire to keep his word a passionate desire to reach out in the spirit and keep reaching out and keep getting hold and getting rapturing revelation after rapturing revelation after rapturing revelation but somebody convinced me to relax and that's where i made my mistake that cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade instead of the church being on fire with the fire of god it has cooled off and become a bit formal that is what has happened back there in the ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to god was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what god thought of them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them you know what we might as well forget that now because we're getting ready to leave the world i don't care what they think anymore if i care about what they think i'll stay with them and i don't want to stay with them i want to leave it's time we forget about what the world thinks and start caring what god thinks that is the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to god it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they changed their manner of dress their attitudes their behavior they got lacks that is what ephesus means relaxed drifting it's time to come back by the anointing of the pure word with christ and say god i want that burning hot desire i want to come back to my first love when everything else would hit the garbage can and i was a joy to see it go i wasn't going oh my favorite movie oh oh brothers and sisters remember the day when it was get it out of my life i want something different than what i've had i want something different than the way i've grown up i wanted something different in this world i want a real genuine god i want a real genuine faith and i want a real genuine holy ghost hallelujah it says in ephesians now it does not mean that she could not have repented it does not mean that we cannot repent we can but we must be quickly it must be a true heart to cry out to god in sorrow and then god will restore the glory shall come again how many wants the glory to come again praying because you loved him not because you had to praying because you were connecting with a supernatural being not because to be a good christian you have to pray and read your bible every day reading the word because it was feeding your soul not because it was a chore that christians must do listening to the message because you have a fervent desire what took on all the way it wasn't that the message changed it wasn't that the bible changed amen it wasn't like we get lied to all the time amen and say that just was what happens it doesn't have to happen what happens is compromise comes in and compromise comes in and when compromise comes in it breaks your fellowship with god to deviate on one word brother brahm said we'll break your fellowship with god and what happened to us we thought that it just kind of got to a dry period go check your life and see if you haven't done something to break your fellowship with god come back to our first love a fervent desire for everything godly a fervent fire a need to have more of a spirit more of his fellowship more of his word a burning hot desire for more of god less of me less of the world and more of him that's how we overcome the antichrist spirit come back to the pureness of the word come back to the full restoration of the word which is christ and have nothing but that oh brothers and sisters we never matured when we moved away from our first love we began to die but maturity is coming back to our first love let's all bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this day god when you when you preached the seals you opened up the plan of lucifer not just what he would do for church ages but what he's trying to do today in god he has been exposed in this place today his tactics have been exposed he has been unfolded and uncovered and satan as a body we want to tell you we deny you now in the name of jesus christ you may have attempted to deceive you may have brought in distractions but we're serving you notice right now that you must go we're pleading the pure word that's been restored to us through the message of the hour we believe that we're lining up to it it's true everything else you say is a lie we deny you we resist you in the name of jesus christ now be gone from us be gone from this assembly be gone from these people god give us back our first love we repent right now you told the ephesians that they will repent they go back to their first love now we're repenting lord and we're saying bring us back to our first love lord bring me back god to a burning desire for your word and your word only bring me back lord to a time where i will cast out everything that's not like you lord god and i don't care what anybody says or what anybody thinks lord but i want so bad to press towards that mark of the high calling your rapture lord it's become everything to us living your word living your will obtaining to the rapture lord it's everything now it's consuming us lord let it burn in us lord burn all the dross out burn all the word out give us a fresh anointing of your holy ghost lord where we have failed and broken fellowship we deny that right now we pray that you take us back into fellowship lord give us back lord our hearts desire to have you and you alone a love union a love affair where we're not interested in anything but you where we love nothing besides you that everything is as if we hate it compared to our love for you we pray that you'd bring us back lord you promised lord through the prophet the church age that if we'll repent that the glory will come back that glory lord where we bask in prayer where we were fed our souls were so enlightened by your word where our hurt burned within us while you preached the word our heart burned within us while the tape was playing lord you promised that that glory would come back if we would repent and we're repenting now lord and asking that you would bring that glory back god burn us with the desire for your will and your word bring lord your spirit to overcome every antichrist spirit in our life god anoint us to overcome in this last day let us not be deceived by the wiles of the slippery devil but let us stand true to the message into the word and believe it lord to obey it to accept it to receive it to be changed by it we ask it in the name of jesus christ we love you almighty god we give you preeminence in this place we give you preeminence in our lives sweep over us lord sweep us into your presence lord draw us up lord draw us close to you god we accept you and nothing else everything else is a lie your word is truth all reasonings and all doubts and all questions they're they're useless lord but your word is true we accept

time i was studying and i realized jesus never died at calvary jesus died at gethsemane [Music] the only reason he could go to calvary is because he first died at gethsemane he asked lord if it be possible let this cup pass from me jesus wasn't running to the cross because he thought it was a neat idea he didn't run there because he thought it sounded like fun he was wrestling within his own humanity asking if there was any way let this cup pass from me and when it came back that it was no other way he went right back to be it unto me according to thy will jesus died at gethsemane and he could go to calvary when he was being beaten [Music] they were beating a dead man when they were questioning him before pilate they were questioning a dead man when they were nailing him to the cross they were nailing a dead man to the cross because he had already died at gethsemane and i say god let this be my gethsemane let me die right now lord let me die every day lord let every morning be gethsemane for me that i will quit with the world and i will quit with with hobbies and i will quit with other passions but there'll be no passion like this passion there'll be no desire like this desire let me die to let this be my gethsemane lord and let me go as a sacrifice vessel to you completely surrendered not my life but your life the believer has to come to gethsemane friends we've got to continually come back to gethsemane say purge me lord let me die our lord was our example he showed us what to do and we have to do likewise god bless you we love you we're going to let you be
