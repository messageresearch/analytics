[0:00] what brother ben is telling us he's not
[0:02] just telling us the story of nimrod he's
[0:04] showing us the seed the beginning
[0:06] how this thing started and we'll get
[0:08] into religion where people will go out
[0:10] on a drinking drunken spree with
[0:12] adultery and all of that
[0:13] on a friday night as long as they can go
[0:15] to the confessional booth on saturday
[0:17] and confess it what are they doing
[0:19] they're climbing up the tower of babel
[0:21] to go to heaven to sing
[0:22] to come back down to earth to live any
[0:24] way they want
[0:26] you say well that's the catholic church
[0:27] i tell you friends the protestants are
[0:29] guilty of the same thing
[0:30] and we can be guilty of it in the
[0:32] message too i do my religious duty i do
[0:34] my devotion i say i believe the message
[0:36] but i still at the core of it do what i
[0:39] want to do anyways
[0:44] the truth friends
[0:47] seen people make choices amen that are
[0:51] contrary to the word of god
[0:52] contrary to the message amen but they'll
[0:55] stay religious amen and they'll stay in
[0:57] the church or stay in the message
[0:58] amen and if one church doesn't accept
[1:00] their unbelief amen and their
[1:02] disobedience to the word
[1:03] they'll just leave that church and go
[1:04] find another one and stay there
[1:06] why because they want a tower of babel
[1:09] they don't want a relationship with god
[1:13] so we don't want to just say
[1:15] confessional booth amen
[1:16] and you know we that's a clear-cut
[1:19] example amen but the devil's a lot
[1:21] trickier than that amen
[1:22] he's going to slip in if he can get us
[1:24] to build our own tower
[1:26] of babel and we can take the message and
[1:28] manipulate it to our own understanding
[1:30] and build our own tower where we feel
[1:32] like we can climb up and sing with the
[1:33] angels amen and go back down and live
[1:35] any way we want
[1:39] it doesn't work that way man i mean
[1:41] we've seen the
[1:42] scene with my own eyes i've seen amen
[1:45] things change since we come into the
[1:47] message
[1:47] dress and attire and attitudes and
[1:50] activities
[1:51] places we used to not want to go to
[1:53] restaurants we wouldn't go into amen
[1:55] and places vacations we wouldn't take
[1:57] amen and we act in ways and do things
[1:59] and play games and
[2:00] dress in ways we just not when we come
[2:02] to the message 20 years ago we wouldn't
[2:04] do it
[2:08] maybe we just got smarter
[2:12] i don't want to be smarter i don't want
[2:14] to live my own life i want to surrender
[2:16] my life i want to be that simple sheep
[2:17] herder
[2:18] says god i don't know i get so tangled
[2:20] up in myself sometimes i think i'm right
[2:22] and i find out i'm wrong
[2:24] sometimes i think i'm righteous and i
[2:26] find out it's only selfishness
[2:27] god you've got to judge me god you got
[2:29] to take your word and shake me
[2:30] i can't do this on my own amen
