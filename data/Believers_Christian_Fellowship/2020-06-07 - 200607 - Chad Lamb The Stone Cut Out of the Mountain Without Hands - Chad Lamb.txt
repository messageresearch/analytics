but whether he's welcome or not depends on us amen let's make sure he's welcome amen while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to the book of revelation and while you're turning there i have

kyle weiker is going to take the wednesday night service and then brother ben siebel is going to take the sunday service we'll be back for that service but he's going to take it for me and i appreciate them brothers be praying for them also remember brother ben in prayer because he's up in michigan right now preaching for brother dan ratliff so remember him while we have our service here amen god be praised let's look here at revelation chapter 1 verse 1 the revelation of jesus christ stop i don't want to read any more i want to leave it with that impact well when you look into the book of revelation right in the beginning when you start the declaration of what this is comes right up and hit you right in the face the revelation of jesus christ let's turn over to romans chapter 9. now can you see why the book of revelation is the bride's book the capstone of the bible amen and god kept it hid behind symbols amen so that nobody could interpret they could try but nobody with any authority could accurately interpret amen until a prophet would come along and it was the right prophet at the right season to come and unlock the mysteries so we catch the revelation of jesus christ uh romans chapter 9 verse 30 9 and 30. what shall we say then that the gentiles which follow not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith but israel which followed after the law of righteousness had not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at the stumbling stone as it is written behold i lay in zion a stumbling stone a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this day we thank you for this opportunity to gather together to worship your name and now as we come lord to the preaching of the word we do so because you told us to we do so because you laid this pattern out lord well but there's no sufficiency in man there's no ability in humans lord so we look beyond that lord and we come according to a promise in your word trusting that you'll speak through human lips well when israel was camped in the wilderness you brought fresh man a day by day they didn't have to labor for it or work for it all they had to do was gather lord and i pray that you would drop fresh manna from heaven now lord that we could gather it and feast on it and enjoy him we love you and we pray you find preeminence in all that we say and do and lord find a welcome in our hearts this morning in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated as we look here at romans chapter 9 if you'll remember when brother branham comes to sirs is this the time uh he's preaching this this he's had a series of six dreams that people have brought to him and those six dreams are all talking in one way or another about him going out west or storing up food or or things like that and and it's capped off by a vision and he and he's get caught up in a constellation of angels and now he knows he's got to leave and go out west to to meet those angels for the revelation of the seven seals and so when brother branham says when he has this vision he said the vision nearly packed me out of the room and he found himself in the corner of the room reading this scripture so this is a significant scripture he's reading as it is written behold i lay in zion a stumbling stone a rock of offense and whosoever believes in him shall not be ashamed and so now he's talking about seeing a constellation of angels getting caught up in the constellation of angels and now he knows he needs to go out west and he's asking could this be that third pool is that them seven unknown thunders is it time for them thunders to be revealed that the seals on the back side of the book the part that not even written in the book and he's asking this question but but supernaturally when he gets caught up in this realm he's beside himself and he comes through and when he comes to he's in the corner of his room with his bible open reading this scripture amen behold i lay in zion a stumbling stone i wonder what's coming amen it's the coming of the stumbling stone what was a cornerstone now coming to be the head of the corner and it's going to be a stumbling stone a rock of offense and whosoever believeth in him shall not be ashamed if you ever believe in him has nothing to worry about has no shame has no iniquity amen has no sin but will be completely purged by what by believing in receiving the stumbling stone let's back up and just read this section again so we can catch context it says what shall we say then that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness hath attained to righteousness even the righteousness was of faith he's showing this principle now the contrast between the jews the old church and the gentiles the old church amen they had received the prophecy they had received the written word but when the living word come they didn't have any faith and couldn't believe in that it became a rock of offense and a stumbling stone to them amen but the gentiles would receive it by faith and now they've received the law of righteousness by faith and those that were striving after righteousness have failed in righteousness because they didn't believe the stumbling stone and now we come to the same place brother brings to the same place at the end of the church ages at the end of the old church they had received prophecy they had received words they had received the bible amen but when the word came manifest in the flesh it became a stumbling stone to them a rock of offense and they stumbled at it amen but there's going to be a gentile bride amen was not going to stumble at the stumbling stone but she would receive it for what it was the seventh seal the coming of the lord the mighty god unveiled the mighty angel descending and to her she doesn't need to be ashamed anymore amen because there's no iniquity there's no now there's nothing but righteousness by what by faith not by works the gentiles received it by righteousness which is of faith but israel which followed after the law of righteousness had not obtained to the law of righteousness they wanted to be right and they were wrong the denominations through the systems have wanted to be right but they become wrong amen what made them go for what they they desired the law of righteousness they desired the word to make them righteous amen but the only way that you can be a righteous is by imputation by faith and so you cannot believe in the word you have to believe the word there's a big difference you cannot believe in god amen devils believe in god but is not believing in god it's believing god not believing in the word but believing the word and whenever the word comes in whatever form the word comes in then we believe that and that's a imputation of righteousness by faith amen why because it always comes as a stumbling stone mecha was a stumbling stone to ahab you know noah and his ark was a stumbling stone to that scientific generation every time the word comes it's a stumbling stone they stumbled at it and wanted righteousness but fell from righteousness they haven't even attained to the law of righteousness because they could not receive the stumbling stone when it was presented to them let's not stumble at the stumbling stone let's turn to matthew 21. if i can today i i want to minister on the stone cut out of the mountain without hands spend a little bit of time on this i'm trying to teach myself to go slow you know how self-reformation works it usually ends in disaster so we're just going to trust god to do whatever he wants to do but i don't want to go so fast and cramps so much in that we leave not knowing where we're at i just want god to just have his way and i want to just relax now relax in his presence and let him have his way matthew 21 42 jesus said unto them did did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and is marvelous in our eyes therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder this is interesting portion of scripture that that there's a stone that the builders have rejected that will become the head of the corner as the lord's doing it's marvelous in our eyes and he says now the kingdom of god will be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth fruits so the kingdom of god is going to be taken away from the jews and given to another nation but we know it was never given to one nation there's no you can't say that it went to the greeks or it went to the romans or it went here amen but but it was taken away the kingdom of god was taken away and it was given into another people and that other people became the kingdom of god and then he says and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken this stone we know a stone is a revelation in the word of god and whoever falls on this stone will be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder so we find that no matter who you are no matter what you think you will come in contact with this stone and when you come in contact with this stone it will require it'll bring brokenness and the question is whether it's voluntary or involuntary but you will come in contact with this stone at some point everyone will come in contact with this stone that was rejected that's become the head of the coroner and when you come in contact with that by free will and throw yourself upon the stone you're broken amen broken from wrong ideas broken from a false life broken from hybridization broken from sin amen so that he can put you back together the way that he wants but if you refuse that brokenness at some point that stone that you refused will be the stone that crushes you and grinds you into powder and blows you into the chaff of the wind so there's no option on coming in contact with this stone which is a revelation of the word and this stone you will either be broken on it or you will be broken under it one will be voluntary when you come in contact and are not ashamed and throw yourself down on the revelation of the word for your day or you can reject it amen and you can you can you can stumble at the stumbling stone and reject it but there's going to come a day when you do that that you will be ashamed when you stand before god and that stone will crush you oh praise god i say lord let me fall on that stone fresh every day and be broken from ideas be broken from concepts be broken from intellect be broken from passions be broken from everything that's human amen and be like you let's look at luke 17 together luke 17 and verse 20. and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say low here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you so now the jews were going to lose the kingdom and it was going to go to another nation but jesus says that the kingdom of god doesn't come with observation you can't say it's over there and it's over there and it's over there for the kingdom of god is within you so now we know where the kingdom of god is the kingdom of god is inside a people on the earth the jews were the oracles of god they were keeping the word of god they were they were they were keeping the light shining of the word of god amen but when the true light came they refused it to keep their artificial light or keep keep the portion of light they refuse the fullness of life amen and now that that kingdom was removed from them and given to another nation that will bring forth fruits thereof and that other nation amen is not a country or a physical location or something with borders that you can measure out because the kingdom of god doesn't come with observation you can't say over there there's a 10 mile square there's a continent or there's alright that kingdom now is within you praise god now let's i just want to lay those scriptures down for a foundation and then move forward i want to if we can bring up the powerpoint i want to look at a couple of quotes just as review from where we've been and move on from there so now any bible reader here knows that a scripture has a compound meaning every prophecy some most all of it is a duel a time there or two times or more that'll be answered as a revolving history now as i said last night and we all know that every prophecy is a compound meaning compound it repeats itself praise god and he says and how many knows that scripture is a compound meaning to every prophecy sure does yes sir it'll say it and mean it just exactly to this time and turn right around and repeat it again back over here somewhere so when it's spoken it means like when david was speaking of his condition in the psalms and crying out it was a real condition he was going through right then something that was happening to him but he was also referring to something that would happen amen when christ was in calvary and it had a dual meaning and then he says now this prophecy of course like all other prophecy is a compound meaning a prophecy sometimes has a natural meaning then it has a spiritual meaning so it's interesting that brother branham can come to this and he can begin to show you that there's a there's a revolving history to the word of god we find it repeating itself i mean you find it you know through the old testament many times the cycle repeats over and over again that they they they god rescues them they settle down under the rescuing power of god he sends a prophet he sends a judge amen and and then they'll settle down they'll turn back to jehovah but then they relax and little things start creeping in and they get caught up in idolatry again and then he brings a warning and they don't heed the warning then comes another judgment through either a plague or another army coming in and then they cry out and after they cry out he brings a deliverer and the deliverer brings a deliverance and it goes and the cycle repeats because the prophecy repeats in a revolving history sometimes there's a natural meaning sometimes a spiritual meaning that's why when god gave us the word amen he gave us his thought amen when god laid his thought down he laid it in the word but he wrote his word in such a way that the word is eternal and not limited by our carnal understanding so the word of god is limitless let's just say it's limitless amen and that's why the word can only be known by revelation because by intellect we'll put boundaries on scriptures and when we put boundaries on scriptures all of a sudden the very thing that'll bring us deliverance and understanding where we're at we've pigeonholed to another place and now we walk in darkness because the light that he's gave us has been put out by our own intellectual understanding and this word is a light it's a lamp unto my feet a light unto my path and god sent it as a light and it's a living word it's not a dead word i mean the old testament is not history the old testament's very much alive amen everything that happened there and all the spirits that all the warfare all the spirits everything that was there is here so it's very much alive it's very much applicable it's very much pertinent to what we're going through today because the same spirits they were fighting there are the same spirits you and i are fighting here so we we spied ourselves we we cut ourselves off amen from the very source that god gave us to overcome when we don't allow what brother branham taught us in the scriptures when we don't allow that scripture to unfold through natural and spiritual sometimes dual meanings two or more meanings in a revolving history sometimes natural sometimes spiritual so we've got to break ourselves away from pigeonholing the word of god we have to break our really what we got to break ourselves away from is the denominational approach to the word and it's more pervasive than we think we do it all the time and we don't mean to but it happens to us all the time but thank god he sent a prophet now i want to turn to the book of daniel let's read daniel together daniel chapter 2. this is where we get the context where we drew our text out of for some of what we want to speak on daniel chapter 2 verse 31 daniel chapter 2 verse 31 thou o king solace may hold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image image's head was of fine gold his breast in his arms of silver his belly in his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass and the silver and the gold broken the pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floor what's that that's what the stone fell on and what the stone fell on was ground to powder became like chaff in the summer threshing floor and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king thou o king are the king of kings for the god of heaven hath given the kingdom power and strength and glory and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beast of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given unto thine hand and hath made thee ruler over all them thou art this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all these shall it breaketh in pieces and bruise and whereas thou saw us the feet and the toes part of potter's clay and part of iron and the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou saw as the iron mixed with miry clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou saw's iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and shall stand forever so as much as thou saw was that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure so we know by by the teaching that we've had and by what the prophet has taught us that there's an image that nebuchadnezzar sees in a dream and that image starts with his kingdom and moves down through four kingdoms all the way down in the where it's iron mixed with clay into the feet and then to the toes and brother man teaches us this is a gentile world domination this is the gentile world powers amen moving down through starting with nebuchadnezzar who became unto the lord as a king of kings and so then he sees this image and a stone cut out of the mountain without hands now you see where i picked the stone that was just me i just picked that why do you think i picked that stone amen because of the message because of everything else brother branham told us amen if you if you if you if you would ask me brother chad would you please go tell me where brother brennam said that stone that was cut in the vision of daniel was the pyramid capstone at the top of the pyramid i'll just ask you to go read the message just go read the message amen because it's the coming of the headstone friends it's the coming of the capstone capping things off and now there's a stone cut out of the mountain without hands and it smites the image in the feet and it crumbles and then this stone grows into a kingdom that fills all the earth are we together so we we definitely know he's not talking about rocks not talking about a mountain he's talking about a kingdom amen and there's coming of a king which is the stone cut out of the mountain without hands and when the king comes the king smites this image now now if you look this is the world domination of the gentiles which really is the manifestation of the kingdom of satan so really we're looking at the manifestation of the kingdom of satan amen that's going to dominate and rule the world until there's a coming of a stone a king stone the headstone the capstone is going to come and smite this image in the feet why does it smite it in the feet because it's got to smite it in the place where the stone comes to manifestation and the stone comes to manifestation at the end of these four stages all the way down when the gentile kingdoms come to the end of time the end of time for the gentile domination amen at the toes the stone has to hit it there but when it hits the stone when the stone hits the feet it grinds the powder the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold it doesn't have to hit it in the head because that was nebuchadnezzar's right in that same spirit that that antichrist spirit satan's kingdom has now moved into the toes so when the smiting stone comes which is the king the king comes and smites it in the feet amen and it grows into another kingdom praise be to god the things that we have been told the things that we have been shown friends the whole world is waiting for this to happen and that doesn't mean that there won't come a king in the millennium as the son of david that will put down all other kingdoms and that kingdom will grow to a giant mountain that fills all the earth it will it absolutely will happen literally on this earth in the millennium but that doesn't mean that it's not happened already and happening now and it won't happen again see if you think about this when you talk about new jerusalem if we just can just for a minute just bear with me and let me take my time and just just relax i'm just going to relax and not feel pressured but there is a spiritual new jerusalem on earth now and that is the bride and the bride has been adorned prepared for her husband and adorned and what adorned in the word the revealed word of the last day has become her adornment and she has made herself ready by putting this adornment on and there's a there's a new jerusalem but we see that there's going to come a destruction at least a partial destruction to jerusalem and armageddon amen and then the king is going to come which is going to be christ as the son of david and we will come with him and establish a kingdom upon the earth and that kingdom will be the kingdom of jesus christ as the son of david for a thousand years and he will rebuild jerusalem so you will have a new jerusalem so you have a new jerusalem and a new jerusalem are they both new jerusalem yes then at the end of the millennium there's going to be a holy fire from god come down and utterly destroy absolutely everything amen and there's going to be a mountain rise up out of the earth and that mountain will rise up out of the earth and there's going to be a heavenly city the heavenly jerusalem descend from god out of heaven amen after the millennium when we move into eternity it will come down and it will cap off our rest over top of this mountain and the city will be on the mountain and this will come down over the mountain and it'll be new jerusalem so which one's new jerusalem it's all new jerusalem it's all telling the same story it's all telling the same thing men you have a you have it spiritually now you have it naturally in the millennium and then when you move beyond the millennium and the new heaven the new earth what was spiritual and what was natural blends together and now there's no veil separating heaven and earth there's nothing separating the dimensions anymore what was spiritual what is natural now blends together for eternity upon this earth amen and there's no separation from heaven and earth so you have spiritual natural and the blending of spiritual and natural you got that so we have to know who we are and where we're at because i'm i'm not a jew i'm not a jew so i don't need to see something physical i'm a gentile been called under the spiritual reality of a kingdom being taken away from a group of people in a physical location and given to another nation which the kingdom of heaven is within you which is no longer a geographical location but inside a people on the earth so the kingdom moved from a location with a headquarters called jerusalem now moved into another place which is his people and so the gentiles are able to catch this concept of what was natural to israel is now spiritual to the gentiles and we need to get comfortable with that because if we get comfortable with that we'll know where we're at and what's going on right now because i'll tell you new jerusalem is here there's a kingdom that has grown and is covering the face of the earth there is a light that is shining amen the light has descended the king has come the king and queen have united he's sitting on the throne at the top of the mountain and i cannot give you the physical dimensions because there's not physical dimensions it's a spiritual happening that's taking place right now praise be to god and if we can get comfortable with that we can get the benefit from that because the benefit of not always putting off putting off putting off waiting waiting waiting it puts us in a stagnant stalemate position where we begin to slumber and fall asleep again and fall back into the same category of denominationalism and constantly pushing something down the road is going to bring the denominational spirit right back in and we're going to lose our youth and we're going to fall asleep again but this isn't something for the future this is something for right now that's happening right now and we need to ask god to rub the eye salve in our eyes fresh every day so that we can see what's going on all around us because in our hearts maybe not in our intellect but in our hearts he has ripped the veil separating heaven and earth amen and it's connected in my soul and that's the reality that's within the believers praise the lord when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say thou art john the baptist some elias others jeremiah are one of the prophets he saith whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against him there's a foundational scripture for us in more ways than one brother member says now if you notice in the scripture reading there in the psalms i kept saying god is my rock do you know what a rock represents in the bible a rock in the bible here represents the revelation of god see god is my revelation he is see the revelation of the word is the rock so if a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands what is that amen 1962 perseverance but god's got a construction a constructed church that's built on the rock christ jesus and all other ground is sinking sand said eddie paranet that's right upon this rock i'll build my church the catholic church said it was upon peter he backslid after that the protestant said it was upon jesus i differ with you he said flesh and blood hath not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you then it was upon the rock of spiritual revelation of the word that's right same thing abel had so listen let's just stop right here whatever peter had is the same thing abel had but we're talking thousands of years apart in different parts of the scripture one caught a revelation of the fall in the garden of eden and the need for a blood sacrifice the other caught a revelation of jesus christ being the son of god and brother brahm said what they got was the exact same thing because they got the revelation of the word for their day oh there's no way we can overemphasize that i can repeat that ten times in a sermon we could go to prayer and we will be all right amen because we've got in order to come in contact with jesus christ you must come in contact with the living word made flesh in your day what abel had was and received was the same thing that peter received they received the word the revelation of the word for their day and it counted abel is righteous and peter is righteous that's right same thing abel had it was revealed to him instead of offering fruit like cain did he offered blood for it was revealed to him the whole church of god is built upon the spiritual revelation of christ who he is what he is and all about him praise be to god we don't mean to be rude there's no desire to be rude but outside the revelation of the word for your day is no life it's death outside the ark everything died the ark was the revelation of the manifestation of the revelation of the word for that day and everything outside of that died and that's everything outside of this message unless you're part of the 144 000 is death and doesn't mean there won't be those who are granted eternal life at the white throne judgment but right now it's not eternal life for them they'll be permitted to enter into eternal life but right now it's not equal to eternal life it's death everything outside is death remember that judgment at the great wine throw judgment is the judgment of the dead not the living the only judgment the living have is a judgment of rewards but that white throne judgment is a judgment of the death all the dead rose praise be the god that's not in a way to be rude or say there's categories for everybody god knows there's those who are going to receive entrance into eternal life there are those that will be there and come into the city and visit you and you'll like it and you'll be happy so it's not cutting everybody out it's not that but we have to recognize the word we have to recognize what the word means it's not flexible to our ideas it doesn't make us feel warm fuzzy and comfortable all the time amen the word is the word and the word doesn't flex and the word doesn't move that ark was non-negotiable it was non-negotiable you're either in the ark or you're out of the ark in the ark you live out of the ark you die it's non-negotiable and now the message is christ you're either in christ or out of christ it's not negotiable and we can't be in christ amen by refusing the light of the hour and trying to walk in the light from a previous hour that the only way you can enter into christ is to find him present tense and enter him there and if you enter him there christ is the full revelation of the full word of god so if you enter at the entry point which is the word made manifest in your day when you enter in you get all the word but you've got to find the door you've got to find the gate you've got to find the way to enter and that's through the word made flesh in your day praise god yes but abraham says that's what paul was no matter how much intellectual he had learned he had known god by revelation yes sir the intellectual went all the way out of the business then when the revelation came which upon the rock the church is built yes sir notice he was a predestinated seed the holy ghost alone shows you who he is there is no man they'll make they'll make you father son holy ghost and everything else out of it see but the holy ghost will reveal him as the lord god of heaven made manifest that that is him what will the holy ghost do the holy ghost will reveal to you the lord god of heaven made manifest that that is him so the holy ghost will not point you back to a previous age that's not the holy ghost the holy ghost will point you to the lord god of heaven made manifest praise god now oh praise be to god where do we want to go all right let's look at here we've talked about this several weeks back we've been talking about it quite a bit but brother branham pointed in 1960 to an event that took place where they had the 10 nation committee on disarmament and the talks fell apart and and uh ended badly but brother brown draws our attention to this and shows us that there was the divide of the eastern countries and the western countries and there was five countries on each one and he said the two big toes on those country were the two leaders of the two big nations and that was the united states and the soviet union amen and those two big toes were eisenhower and khrushchev eisenhower means iron khrushchev means clay and so brother branham is trying to not trying he's looking at an event that's taking place in the world and he's and he's drawing our attention to that because god drew his attention to that to show us where we are in the sequence of events where we are in time for the gentiles and brother branham says now and did you notice right now at the last hour when we brought in and where that this last great conference where khrushchev was five nations of the east eisenhower the leader five nations of the west represented the ten toes of the image they would not mix and khrushchev took off his shoe and beat it spiritual mind would pick that up right quick without brother berman i missed it so you have to figure out where your spiritual mind comes from [Laughter] amen we needed a prophet friends we had to have god show us spiritual mind would pick that up right quick on the desk they beat it on the desk they will not mix next thing is the coming of the stone that shoot out of the mountain without hands that will roll into the gentile kingdom it'll be finished and just before that time he's going to send his angel to what church to sodom no to the lukewarm no he sent it to the elected called out church what kind of a sign did he show the same thing that he did here last night god elohim manifested in the person of the holy ghost in his church oh my why it ought to send us a million miles in the sky with shouts and praises of his glory brother is pointing that out and he's saying the next thing to come is a stone that will come and smite those nations in the field that's the next thing to come but just before that he'll send a messenger to the elect group and he said what sign will he show did you catch it he says what kind of sign did he show the same thing that he did here last night the same thing he did here last night when he turned us back to the tent and told what was sarah was thinking in her heart amen and brother branham is there manifesting the same sign showing that the same one is present amen giving a message to his elect amen just before the stone comes down and smites the image in the feet now we got the image down to the feet down to the toes [Applause] and we've got the one who's going to come first with a ministry to the elect doing the same signs everything's in place now it's time for the stone to come and here we are in 1960 amen praise be to god that means amen if if brother branham's talking here and he's showing we've come to the end of the feet to the end of amen this manifestation of the antichrist spirit down through the gentile world powers we've come to the end of that and now the elohim is here in human flesh again doing the same sign that he did there just before the destruction of sodom amen then all of a sudden you have to look around and say where's the stone where's the stone where's the stone it's time for the stone everything's in place praise god amen so that stone when it's cut out it smashes that image in the feet now brother branham he he explains uh this image and he shows the domination of the world powers from babylon to the medes and persians to the empire of greece to rome and rome goes all the way out into the end and it turned from pagan pagan rome to papal rome and then it was a religion that was mixed in mingling with the politics religion and politics now mixing in and infiltrating into everything he said brother i said is rome it's always rome it'll always be rome it's rome and rome has mingled itself in and there's several places in the message where brother ben talks his iron and clay and he starts showing it protestants and catholics he said they start to mix together but they won't mix together but they're starting to come together to mix together but they won't completely mix is that right and he's showing the ecumenical move where they're coming in where the world council of churches is starting up and the the evangelicals and the protestants are gathering together the catholics are gathering together they're going to make a pack and come together to try to mix but they won't completely mix so brother man he's showing us that this image coming down to the feet it's both a political and a spiritual power it's both political and spiritual there'll be a destruction of all the political powers in the kings absolutely don't worry but before that he's going to destroy the stronghold of the spiritual and set his children free so he's going to there's going to be a spiritual stone cut out of the mountain that's going to strike aim in this image of the feet and break the power amen of this catholicism and protestantism the power of the and the harlots the seducing spirit of jezebel amen that has seduced god's children he's going to break that power with a revelation a stone that's going to smite the image in the feet and then that's going to grow into a kingdom that's going to fill all the earth and then there will be the son of david that will put down all other nations and build a mountain which is a kingdom that'll fill all the earth see mountains are kingdoms many times in the bible and it's amazing that moses was called unto a mountain and when he was called into the mountain he met the pillar of fire where and the mountain mount horeb mount sinai when he got the word amen the covenant word for the people of israel he got it on the mountain so god will bring a servant to the top of the mountain and at the top of the mountain he'll give them the word amen that's a covenant between him and his people and we know that that that went wrong the people refused it but there's always these mountaintops and even god when he's when he's calling out in ezekiel calling out least lucifer he says you were on my holy mountain amen but i kicked you out of my mountain that means he's been kicked out of the kingdom and this mountain that grows in daniel will be a kingdom so many times a mountain is a kingdom but let's go to hebrews chapter 12. hebrews chapter 12 verse 18 for year not come unto the mountain that might be touched and that burneth with fire nor into blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice that they heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it should be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake but you are come unto mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly in church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator the new covenant to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spoke on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven who voiced then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven in this word yet once more signifying the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore are we receiving we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire now the apostle paul brings us in the book of hebrews and he says you've not come to the natural mountain where the law was given where they met god and saw the pillar of fire come down on top of mount you've not come to that mountain but you've come to a mountain is that right so now paul is the one who is taking the natural things from the old testament and bringing them to become spiritual realities in the new testament so paul will take what happened to moses amen it will bring it right up here to today and say you've not come to that mountain but you've come to mount zion and so now moses brought them to a place a minute in that place they were supposed to when they heard the trumpet sound go up into the mountain and meet with god and hear his voice directly but they refused and ran away but moses brought them to the meeting place but they refused and they received the law which was a covenant between god and his people but now now paul the apostle is coming along there's three great prophets amen outside of jesus christ three great prophets that we want to take note of moses the apostle paul and brother branham three great prophets and all of them have to do with a mountain and the word right moses brought a people freed from the bondage of egypt enslaved in egypt and brought a people out to meet god on their way to the promised land and he was given the word paul was bringing a people out of the bondage of religion and trying to bring them to mount zion he said you've not come to that place but i've brought you to a place i've brought you to mount zion what were they supposed to do at sinai when they heard the trumpet they were supposed to go and meet god now paul brings them to the base of mount sinai amen and he's bringing it to the base of mount sinai but there's going to be a building up of mount zioni zion for three or for some seven church ages but when we get to the top amen something's going to happen at the top of mount zion that's going to be the king the king's going to come cap this mountain and unite with his church so moses brought them to a mountain and gave them the word paul brought them to a mountain and gave them the word and brother branham amen comes at the top of the mountain and receives the word amen moses wrote the old testament paul wrote the new testament and brother branham gave the revelation of the unwritten word in the top of the mountain amen that reveals the mystery laying through old and new testament three great prophets amen and we happen to be living in the day not on mount zion not at the base not a mount sinai not at the base of mount zion but we through seven church ages worked our way up and now we're up in the capstone in the throne with the king himself this is a different age and we we need to act different think different believe different be different amen we're not in the journey we're in the top and paul was the one bringing the church to this mountain and this mountain was spiritual yeah the apostle paul has absolutely no problem taking something from the old testament that's fixed and solid and tangible and touchable and he'll bring it right to the new testament church and it's spiritual nothing you can touch lay your hands on it's a faith in the word because that's the dispensation for the gentiles it's spiritual revelation spiritual manifestation a spiritual kingdom in you it was taken away from the jews which was physical and given to a nation which is spiritual what nation is that the nation of the kingdom of christ the kingdom of god praise god now now the apostle paul he's coming at the end of the old testament he's coming into the new testament to lay out the new testament but he's speaking of a voice that will speak from heaven that will shake he said that voice shook the earth but don't refuse him that speaketh that is going to shake the heavens and the earth so that anything that can shake that can move will be shaken so that that which cannot move shall remain so now he's talking about a voice from heaven that will shake not just the earth but the heaven and the earth and remember now paul is talking spiritually he said you've come to the heavenly jerusalem you've come to the uh uh you know the the spirits of just men made perfect you've come to all none of it you can see none of it you can see none of you can feel what the sense is it's all spiritually discerned so when the shaking comes that he's talking about is he talking about something where you see you know all the uh all the stars falling and shooting stars to the earth and great earthquakes rumbling that's not what he's talking about he's talking about a shaking that's going to shake the whole world and when brother branham got caught up in the constellation he said there was a blast that shook the whole earth shook the horse why it shook every religious system it shook every religious demon amen it even shook i'm telling you it shook the powers in heaven because we were not against principalities and flesh and blood but we war against uh principalities and powers in heavenly places that term actually means in heaven because the accuser of the brethren is there making accusation he has access to the the throne in heaven to accuse you and when this blast went off amen for the opening of the seven thunders it didn't just shake the religious system on earth but i assure you friends it shook heaven itself heaven and earth has been shaken from this voice that has come from heaven where at the top of zion all these things that brother branham is teaching us and telling us he's pulling them right out of the scriptures friend and making them alive amen and we just have to take what he said we've made so many mistakes as human beings trying to take the word and use the word to him in the message oh if i could take time to explain this we want to prove everything by the word but we've had the backwards approach to proving everything by the word so we've taken our understanding or denominational understanding through years of the word and we've tried to frame brother branham's message in our paradigm of the word amen and because you can read the scriptures easy for water baptism in jesus name it fit in and you could read the scriptures on there's only one god only one lord and you could slip that in there too and you could even read about eve was beguiled by the serpent and you could see serpent seed and so you could slide that in right there but there was some things he said that was so mysterious amen it was far beyond an intellect being able to read black marks on white paper so we would leave that outside saying that we're just judging this by the word and shaving off things that the prophet taught us is that the truth that's exactly what's happened not by evil intentions but the carnal mind through a denominational upbringing trying to take the word and check the message with the word and brother branham said take everything i said back to the word but brother branham wasn't saying he was teaching it wrong he was letting you know this is right take it to the word you'll find it in the word so now we've got to take the pattern that was laid out at the opening of the seals and lay that pattern down all through the word and with that pattern in our minds read the word and all of a sudden the word starts coming to life we started seeing things that were there that we never knew were there [Applause] and all of a sudden this is why he said this and this is why he said that and this is why he said that oh praise be to god let the prophet be the prophet moses was the giver of the word amen in the old testament amen paul was the giver of the word in the new testament and brother branham was the revealer of the word at the end of it all let him have his job he said when all the mysteries of the bible was all finished down comes this angel who was finishing the mysteries what ministry was that the ministry of the seventh angel that's his job it wasn't never our job to fact check brother branham it was brother branham's job to break our fact checker [Laughter] amen so that we can break the carnal the intellectual the ability to read oh my goodness we think it's such a privilege to be able to read amen those who would would benefit from the prophecy laid out in the book of revelation with those that read or hear amen you don't even have to be able to read amen peter was not an intellectual man and it benefited him well just to be able to receive the keys to the kingdom so praise be to god we don't want to get in bad habits we want all bad habits to be broke let the prophet bring the word that's what a prophet is a divine revealer of the word brother brethren gave us that definition a divine revealer of the word he says and what we have now is the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication so i'm not interested in fact checking brother branham i want him i want that message that god brought through that vessel to break every notion and tear down every wall and fence and i want to go back to the word with some freedom to move in the message with some freedom to explore the land with some freedom to cut away the ball and chain and cut away all the restrictions amen and just be free to enjoy the word amen so now the apostle paul here in hebrews he's laying this out you've come to a mountain you've come to heavenly jerusalem you've come to an innumerable company of angels he never said you're coming too you've already come because why that's all part of this mountain that's all part of mount zion it's all there you've come to it he says now verse 25 see that you refuse not him that speaketh for they escape not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he has promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifying the removing of those things which are shaken as the things which are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear apostle paul says we're receiving a kingdom and that kingdom cannot be moved he says in the message in his presence from 1962 he said this is evangelism this is the time to shake people this is the time that god said there'd come a time he shook mount sinai one time but there'd come a shaking again he wouldn't only shake mount zion but he would shake everything that could be moved but did you notice the rest of the scripture but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved hallelujah everything that can be shook will be shaken the heavens will shake the earth will shake heaven and earth will pass away but the word shall never pass away for upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will never prevail against it everything that can be shook will be shaken but we receiving a kingdom which is the word of god himself and god is the word so what is that kingdom the word of god himself and it cannot be shaken and god is the word he don't shake himself amen but we receiving a kingdom that cannot be moved it is unshakable said paul the hebrew writer i want to read a couple more quotes on the same subject and the world is falling apart he says we are dead our lives are hidden god through christ and not only that but we are raised with him raised up in a system a denomination organization we are resurrected in the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is within you why all these man-made systems must fall not one not once more i'll shake the world but i'll shake heavens and those things that cannot be shook it's what will remain and we receive a kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot be shook or moved that's the kingdom of god not a system not a political wheel not a denomination but a kingdom amen and its subject is dead to the systems of this world its subjects are dead to these organizations it's dead to those political system and it's alive and resurrected by the power of the king and future home he says and look you are part of that ground is that right and when he redeemed you he redeemed the earth with the same thing and you are together again how much plainer can it be you have to be redeemed because you're part of it and if the blood didn't drop on you you ain't redeemed yet you're not called then he cleansed it that's the same thing he does in the fire even the blood dropped it's yet got to be cleansed by fire that's right for a dwelling place for god god already took up his abode potentially the kingdom of god is in the earth now in the hearts of his saints are you in a kingdom is the kingdom in you what's the geographical location i'll tell you where it is it's covered the whole earth it's his attributes that he begin in the beginning now his attributes is redeemed what's he waiting to redeem the earth to set his attributes on it to fulfill exactly his predestinated plan then he says christ and christ is the mystery of god revealed then our headship is a kingdom oh this is good our headship is a kingdom what's our headship the capstone what's the capstone christ the revelation of jesus christ the capstone the headstone coming to the church is a kingdom the kingdom of god is within you said the bible jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in our own life let's read that again the kingdom the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in our own life that's the kingdom not just say i've got the kingdom i listen to the message no it's got to become spirit of life in our life that's the kingdom there's spirit in life in our own life every promise in this day as it did in the day when the word and god was won and the word and god is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as adam and eve in the beginning in the garden of eden the threefold mystery of god his body the threefold mystery of god has to do with his body second fold is preeminence in his body in his kingdom his kingdom in you the kingdom in you in the earth now what earth this earth let's look at this section again out of daniel daniel 2 and 31 thou saws till a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken the pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth this is the prophecy that we're dealing with now now i want to look at junior jackson's dream if i can and i'm going to i'm going to take my time and not blow through this either but i want to read out is this the sign of the answer i got several places i'm going to read but we'll talk about this so brother jackson dreamed to dream he couldn't get away from it and was leaving his church and he just couldn't stand it how long ago has it been brother jackson for the brexit february 61. he had the dream and he came to me and said something is on my heart i must tell you brother branham i said go on brother jackson he said i dreamed a dream and there it was i just sat still and i listened and watched brother bram is now seeing it he's listening to junior jackson tell it but he's watching the dream and i watched he said i dreamed that there was a great big hill like out in the field where bluegrass or something was and said up on top of this hill where the water had washed away the soil there was a top rock up on top the hill like the top of the mountain it was a rock no grass and where the water had washed down it had cut some kind of readings on these stones and you were standing there interpreting this reading on these stones and said all of us and here's the way he put it the brethren from georgia and from all around we were all standing together listening to you interpret that mysterious writing on those stones that mountain and said then you picked up something like from the air something like a wrecking bar or a crowbar wasn't it brother something like that a wrecking bar real sharp and said how you done it i don't know and said you struck the top of the mountain ripped it around and lifted the cap of it off it was in the shape of a pyramid and you ripped the top of it off now that was months and months and months before the pyramid message was preached beneath that was white stone granite and you said the sun or the light has never shined on this before look in on this watch this and that's right because the formation of the world the world was formed before there was light we all know that god moved upon the water and then then in the beginning he spoke for light and natural down down under there and the age that that formation was that light had never come upon that stone and he said look upon this light has never come upon it before and then when all of them got up and i told them to watch that and all of them come up and look in but he said while they were looking in he looked out the corner of his eyes i believe it was and watched me i slipped off to one side and started going towards the west towards the setting of the sun coming up a hill going down a hill coming up a hill going downhill getting smaller and smaller and went all the way out of sight so junior jackson comes to brother man with this dream this is the first dream in a series of six dreams that individuals will bring to him that's capped off by the vision of the constellation of the seven angels and in search of this the time he says there was this pyramid coming up out of the earth amen friends where where has this pyramid of the church ages come from from the earth the people you you and the people down through the ages for 2 000 years have been flesh part of the earth eating the earth earth making their body and in their body amen was a portion of the word for that age amen and that mountain has been growing out of the earth through the seven church ages it's been coming up out of the earth brother branham says your bodies were laying in this earth back when he formed the foundation of the world your body laid right there the materials for your body laid right there so this great monument to god this great pyramid that's been raising through seven church ages has been coming out of the earth and up at the top the washing of the water of the word is starting to reveal what's in the earth hallelujah the prophet's been revealing the church ages he's been revealing amen what has been coming up out of the earth from the time of fall on it's been building and building and building this great pyramid shape through seven dispensations of time coming up now to the top to the cap and he says up there was a top rock like a pyramid at the top amen and there was where the water had washed down the water the word had washed down he said it had cut yeah he had cut riding in this rock then another place brother bib says funny looking writing funny writing because nobody could interpret it they the the the lutherans tried and the wesleyans tried and the pentecostals tried but it was funny writing and brother benham never attributed to any given language yeah you understand he didn't say it was this kind of writing or that kind of writing he said funny writing because there's only one that's ever going to be able to interpret that writing and it's going to be the seventh angel that funny writing was put there just for him and he says all of a sudden he reached out of the air and he grabbed something like a wrecking bar crowbar real sharp and he just he said he didn't even know how he did it just grabbed it somehow and popped the top off of this and underneath was white stone so there was writing all over on the outside of the stone the stone was coming up out of the earth oh if we could just catch this phrase this is going to explain our whole existence and the whole church ages and everything right here coming up out of the earth amen through this hill coming up what was in the earth what was laying in the earth undiscovered amen it was the very mountain of god the very kingdom of god the very people of god amen god himself in a pyramid form coming up through seven church ages amen but at the top the water of the word begins to wash it away so you can see what's been in the earth all the time and we get to the top and now there's this funny writing and nobody can interpret but brother branham starts to interpret the writing because brother branham has to go around all over this outside word which is what's written in the bible and restore all the truths that were lost and interpret the bible and when he gets the bible all interpreted ties together all these loose sins that was left off through the church ages when he gets done with that at the top now it's time to reveal that there's something inside this rock now that has no writing on it oh praise be to god you know brother bram didn't have this dream junior jackson had the dream so he's not taking he's not just saying this is what happened and this was no somebody else had the dream and god was showing it through another vessel showing exactly what's taking place and so now brother bannon had come to the end of tying together all the loose ends he had preached the uh he preached the church ages which contained in the church ages every major doctrine of the church is that what he said tied together all the lucians interpret their writing on the outside of the rock but then when he gets to the top and all the brothers are standing around he gets an instrument he gets a tool he gets something in his hand and he uses that tool to pop the top off of the mountain to show that there's something else in here there's something else inside here everybody else can see the funny writing and try to interpret serpent seed and what about it is there three gods one god amen i don't understand the serpenty thing what about election election and free choice and how does election and free choice work and funny writing and everybody could try but there was one who could interpret the writing on that and that was brother branham and when he got done tying together all the loose ends something from heaven was given to him an ability was handed to him to discover amen to pop the top off of this and discover that underneath the top of this there is unwritten word light has never shined on this before nobody's even tried to interpret the funny writing why because there is no writing and brother bam goes right to the seals let's turn over here to revelation revelation chapter eight oh i'm trying to hold myself back i and and so many of you are so well versed in this you know exactly where i'm going you know what i'm going to say but i just feel compelled to keep going through because sometimes you don't catch it the first time second time third time but there's always a time when all of a sudden under the anointed preaching he's like got it click something just clicked like never before so i want to take my time and go through this revelation 8 chapter chapter 8 verse 1. see that's what happens when i start talking too fast sends you to the wrong chapter the wrong book in the bible we're gonna this is the opening of the seventh seal and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour see brother brennan takes that and he shows that nothing said right here in this seventh seal at all other six seals they had information they had information they had information but when you get to the seventh seal the only information that you have is silence about the space of half hour nothing but then he comes over here to revelation chapter 10. we'll pick it up in verse 1 he says and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and he cried with the loud voices when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices now seven thunders uttered their voices that wasn't a rolling of thunder a thunder in the bible was always the voice of god what the prophet tells us and you can see in the scriptures seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write so when the thunders uttered their voices it spoke something that john could write down so it wasn't just a noise it wasn't an undiscernible noise it was something that john heard and john comprehended john understood and john could record it and when the seventh hunters had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand up on the scene upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swore by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that there are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god the mystery of god and i just want to inject this christ is the mystery of god revealed the one singular mystery was a threefold purpose male female restored back to the garden of eden the mystery of god what is the mystery of god christ is the mystery of god what is christ the anointed word in each age the word and manifestation or the word becoming flesh what is christ what is christ the mystery of god revealed i don't know about you but to me christ the mystery of god revealed is the mystery that god wanted to be manifest in flesh jesus is flesh and my flesh and i hope your flesh the mystery of god and the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets so brother ever said he begins to sound he said not when he goes out and the healing campaigns and all of that when he begins to sound out his message and his message is the message of the seventh seal he's the messenger of the seventh seal and the seventh seal is revelation 10 1-7 it's what he says and what what what is the message in revelation 10 1-7 it's the message that john was forbidden to write brother branham so brother branham says that's why when he looks at this he says there's seven thunders and those seven thunders are sealed he says seal it up and write it not and that's why brother branham starts saying see there's seven seven seals on the back part of the book this is what he's talking about not 14 seals there are no 14 seals but he says there's seven seals amen in the book and there's seven seals on the back side of the book amen and he's talking about the seven seals from revelation chapter six the six seals and then the seventh in revelation chapter eight amen that come forth in symbol form except the seventh which is just silence for the space of half an hour but then over here you have seven thunder seven voices seven revelations seven something that came from god when the angel descended so when the angel comes to earth with an open book in his hand then there are seven voices that bring information that john could write down but he was told not to write it to seal it and brother branham calls those the seals on the backside of the book or the second set of seals and so he sees the ones on the inside are open but they're open in symbol form but the ones on the back side nothing's even spoke of them at all and that's what he's referring to when he gets here deserves is this the time and he takes that tool and he pops the top off and sees see no light is shown on this unwritten word it's not even written in the bible why because when it comes to the seventh seal silence when you come over here to the seven thunders silence he said see they're connected together it's the same thing whatever the seventh seal is amen is what those seven thunders are and he says and brother says i've read lots of men's writing and i've never read where anybody ever said that there's seven seals yet to be revealed why because he's the one that was given the tool that'll pop open the top of this word what's the what's the top of the word amen the word has been building old testament new testament building all the way up when you get to the top of the word or the capstone of the bible is which book of the bible the book of revelation amen brother banham starts down through that book down through the church ages amen and he gets to a place now where serves as this the time he starts showing that there's seals over here there's a seven seal here there's thunders over here what's he doing he's interpreting the funny writing on the outside of the cap but he says but look he grabs a tool he pops it open and says look but there's something inside that's not even written in the bible amen and he said i went out west and he said maybe to get the interpretation of what that was oh i love this he said and further in search is this the time or is this the sign of the answer and seven thunder's right in the revelation here of jesus christ it's some mystery does not the bible say that the revelation of jesus christ what is the revelation of jesus christ this book that we're reading out of the capstone book of the bible is the revelation of jesus christ and there's a hidden mystery in the revelation of jesus christ that has to do with the white stone to the seven thunders the unwritten portion in the word why he said why there is some hidden mystery then of it what is it the seven thunders have it for john was just about to write and the voice come down to heaven said don't write it but seal it seal it up put it on the back side of the book it's got to be revealed it's the mysteries further down he says and notice he said in some mysterious way we picked up out of the air a sharp tool that opened up the top and in there was white granite but it wasn't interpreted there was no letters i didn't interpret that junior i just looked at it and i said to the brethren look on this and that's fulfilled tonight motherboard is coming down he's taking this dream he's taking all of this and he's starting to piece it together so we know where we're at and he's and brother branham said now we went around and we interpreted the writing on the wall on on the outside of the stone and at the top amen and what's he doing brother branham is showing seven thunder seven mysterious thunders of seven seal silence a seven thunder sealed up don't write it all of these things and at the time of the uh the seventh angels ministry amen the mystery of god will be complete he's talking about all of that what's he doing he's taking the sharp tool and he's popping the top off of the word right there and the message serves as his time and showing there's a white stone underneath and junior jackson dreamed about it in february of 1961 and brother branham comes and says that dream's fulfilled tonight and he said look on this and i'm going out west to get the interpretation and come back and we're going to reveal what's not written see brother said i used to think that it was something that was not even written in the bible at all but he said see you can't add one word or take one word away it's something that has to be laying in the bible but been missed back there so what's he saying that there is a white stone there so there's a there's a there's out of the earth has been coming the kingdom of god one delegate at a time building building building what his temple his holy mountain his dwelling place do we understand we start thinking about temple when we think of solomon's temple we think of the temple in new heavens and new earth those are all symbolic friends where's his altar your heart where's his temple you solomon gathered stones from all over mis-shaped different sized stones and he fit them together perfectly to make his temple why because it's the living stones where the shekinah glory of god abides the lord of the rings keeps pointing to the pyramid to the pyramid over and over pointing to the pyramid and the pyramid is made by all kinds of different size and shaped stones amen and they've been gathered together and placed so perfectly in their position that they're earthquake proof everything that can be shaken shall be shaken so that which cannot be shaken which was the word that looked like a misfit to the world but there was a place in the temple of god that you that stone fit perfect and when you find your position in your place in the temple of god the house of god the mountain of god the dwelling place of god then you become earthquake proof you cannot be shaken because you're the word you're the living stone shaped by the word put in position by the word in the temple of god and it's become earthquake proof [Music] out of this out of the earth comes the temple of god the mountain of god what is it the kingdom of god the holy mountain where is it coming from you and me and great-great-grandma so-and-so and luther's great-great-grandma so and so what is it out of the earth is coming the holy mountain of god and at the top under the washing of the water of the word there's revealing mysteries loose ends in the bible it's all tangled up and there's gonna be a prophet start interpreting that and then when he gets to the top and his funny writing he's to begin to show that there's something more there's something in the bible there's seven thunders there's silence in heaven there's something going on a a mighty angel descending and a ministry of the seventh angel and he takes a tool and he pops it off and he says see nothing was written but it was sounded it was the voice of god and brother man said god doesn't do something just to be playing god doesn't speak just to speak he wasted he does waste not his breath if god spoke it was for a reason and if god spoke he gave a revelation and if that revelation was sealed up there has to come a time for that revelation to be unsealed and brother brenham said that he showed us that that white stone is a mystery that's not written but it's in the word it's in the stone i say it like this it's in the living stones what are you doing as a stone hewed out of the earth all you see is stone but i'd like to tell you behind the stone is a white rock a mystery that's been going on through the whole bible and that mystery is a mystery of marriage a mystery of a husband and a wife a mystery of god becoming flesh and that white stone is the unspoken mystery through the whole bible he said it was christ and noah it was christ and moses it was christ and david it was christ what was that it was the white stone in the stone amen it was christ hiding behind moses it was christ hiding behind david it was christ hiding behind solomon what was it it was the white stone within the stone amen the unwritten portion of the bible the mystery of god becoming flesh and nobody knew it until somebody could pop the top off and say there's more than what the theologians have been reading there's more than what the the printer can put in the book there's more what's laying there is written between the lines it can't be a new word because you can't add to or take away but this white stone nothing's written because it's been written on the outside but the revelation of the white stone will read between the lines on what's written on the outside and show you what the mystery has been through the whole book where at the top when somebody can take a tool from god and pop the top off and say there's a white stone inside oh praise god where does that put us friends i hope you're not waiting for something to happen [Music] you are the something that's happening and i say that over and over but i want it to sink into all of our hearts i want it to sink into my heart i want to repeat it till it becomes such a living reality it affects every moment of my day because it still hasn't hit like it should hit we'll go over these things and go over these things and go over things because there's got to come a greater manifestation to what is going on there's got to become a greater reality that's going on there's got to be oh praise god there's got to be that prophet with that tool in his hand that can cut away the casing stone off of me so the white stone can shine for us in my life so it wouldn't be chad lamb it would be jesus christ the one on the inside it was christ and moses it was christ and david it's christ in his bride can you say it's christ and bob it is christ and chad and it's christ and dave can you say that and say lord let that prophet take that tool and cut away the casing so that the whiteness comes through the purity of the revelation of what's going on in this day hallelujah let's look in the book of exodus real quick i told you there's three prophets you have to watch moses but paul brother brandon there's three exodus all tied to these three prophets let's look at exodus 32. oh my goodness i get so excited i'm gonna take a drink we'll slow down i'm gonna say the right chapter and the right verse so we can all read the same spot exodus 32 15. and moses turned and went down from the mountain two tables of the testimony were in his hand and the tables were written on both their sides on one side and on the other were they written does that sound familiar i mean it's like we're right at revelation chapter 5 and i saw a book in his hand written within on the inside and on the back side these things aren't in here just because god doesn't waste any time they were written on both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written and the tables were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god graven upon the tables and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh into the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed taught and he cast the tables out of his hands and break them beneath the mount so now he's been up he's been up in the presence of god and he's received the law of god but if you read the previous chapters brother god is telling him all about temple worship and all about the the law he's giving them all kinds of information but all that was written on the table of stones was the ten commandments because the ten commandments is the covenant between god and his people he brought them to sinai to marry them the purpose of sending a prophet to go rescue them from bondage was to bring them out to sinai so he could marry them but they refused the purpose of sending paul a prophet was so that he could marry them but they refused so what's the purpose of sending this prophet in the end time to bring us to the mountain so we can marry him let's not refuse him that speaketh from heaven so now you know moses brings them here god wanted to give his word directly to his people so he spoke he came down with fire and he spoke and when he come down with fire and he spoke the people ran the other way because they could not endure that which was commanded they couldn't take him in the voice direct from god and they prayed for a prophet to come and he says that's fine that's what you'll have from now on and that's the way god's done it ever since and so he brings him up into the mountain and he gives him all kinds of the word but he writes on these two tables of stone the covenant between him and israel and he comes down with this covenant this these two tables of stone written in stone between god and the people and he found the people already in idolatry and he was so angry that he cast out the tables of stone from his hand and they broke the pieces because when paul would come with the revelation of the word before they could unite they already went into idolatry in the first church age and the word was fragmented it's the same pattern over and over again now the word was broken amen the covenant between god as people was broken and fragmented and people could pick up pieces and have a little bit of this and a church age could grab a little bit of this and a little bit of that armenianism and calvinism and and right but god wasn't going to leave it that way god was going to fix it his own way praise god let's turn to uh exodus 34 and read verse 1. and the lord said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone likened to the first and i will write upon these tables the words that were the first tables which thou breakest and be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto the mount sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mountain and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor the herds feed before the mount and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and moses rose up early in the morning and went up until mount sinai as the lord had commanded him and took in his hand the two tables of stone and the lord descended in the cloud and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord so now the word has been broken because of idolatry and in idolatry the word's been fragmented but god now is going to give his people the covenant again he's going to give the people his word again and so he calls moses back up into a mountain but before he tells moses to cut two tables of stone out of the mountain amen that means moses was going to have to grab a sharp tool he's going to have to take a sharp tool and he's going to have to cut amen two tables of stone but not right on the two tables of stone because moses is going up to the mountain recognizing that there's word that's been broken amen and he's coming up with two tables of stone with nothing written on the stone i love the word of god amen how did he get these tables of stone oh he must have just grabbed something from the air a sharp tool or something amen and cut it out and he realizes there's got to be writing on these two tables of stone amen brother madam he's in sabino canyon amen and he lifts up his hand and all of a sudden something strikes his hand and what is it it's a sword and it says it's the sword of the king he said oh a sword of a geek said no these sword of the king what is it the word in the hand the prophet gets a sharp tool and with the sharp tool he can cut the top off and say there's something here in the same shape as this there's something underneath moses cut something the same shape of what was lost the first time but it has nothing written on it unwritten word unwritten stone and brother branham takes a sharp tool and cuts the top off and in the same shape of the seven seals in the same shape of the capstone there's another stone with nothing written on it so when moses was going to get the writing on the stone he had to take this stone that he cut with a sharp tool and go up on the mountain and up on the mountain god would come down in the cloud oh praise be to god everything brother branham did was orchestrated by the word this is what i was talking about the first time early in the message tonight this morning when we said we've been taking the word and trying to mold brother ben's message inside our paradigm of the word amen and it's the actual revelation of the word that brings light to what's laying here in the message how do we know what moses is doing if it wasn't for what we've seen happen in this day and caught the revelation of what's happened and it unlocks the mystery back in exodus exodus is not unlocking the mystery today the mystery today is unlocking the mystery in exodus we've got to catch the revelation by faith we've got to catch the revelation of the word today amen and if we catch the revelation of what's happening your bible will become a new book but we've tried to take the old book of the old bible amen and tried to take the message and stuff it into the old book of the old bible that's not a new bible that's not a new book friends but the seven seals loose that book from the old form that we had it in so that it could pop wide open so that we could catch the fresh revelation from god and that revelation will unlock the mystery of the whole word we've had it backwards how do we understand what ruth was all about and her journey in moab and coming back and orpha and two churches and false and because of the revelation today unlock the mystery then that was the white part of the stone that was hidden behind the words amen how did we get the interpretation of the white part the unwritten part where does the bible say ruth amen is a type of the gentile bride it doesn't it's white [Applause] [Music] amen where does it say rachel the fourth one to bring forth from jacob brings forth joseph amen perfect type of christ and brings forth benjamin when she departs showing the ministry of the bride where is that it's written there but it's in the white part what revealed the white part when a prophet could pop the topic when he could grab a sharp something from the air hallelujah we've got to be spiritually tuned in when brother branham says and serves this time i grab something out of the air somewhere and then he comes just a month later because the happening in sabino can with the sword in his hand happened just a month later in january and he holds his hand up and something mysteriously strikes his hand how can you tie those together how can you not tie those together you see friends it's not intellectual understanding amen it's not the ability to do a word search and compare exact phrases it's a revelation that unlocks the whole mystery it's a revelation that unlocks the message and it's a revelation that unlocks the whole bible and without that revelation you'll be a frustrated human being because you'll always be trying to take firm hard fixed unflexible words and explain and understand the message when brother branham doesn't use the scriptures in an unbending unflexible stiff rigid way and if we try to use the scriptures in a way different than he used the scriptures which he used them the same way jesus christ used the scriptures and the same way the apostle paul used the scripture but if we try amen so that we're not deceived and so that we don't go in air and so that we don't make any mistakes take a common well-defined understanding of the bible do you see the foolishness of mankind do you see our own our own failure do you see your failure i see my failure take the rigidity of the word and a rigid interpretation of the word and try to understand the message with a rigid interpretation of the word and all we end up doing is getting confused and we do word searches and find exact phrases and then we say well what did brother branham say about this subject and you start searching through it's like ah yeah he means this and he said that he means this and then all of a sudden he switches at the opening of the seventh day ah seventh season will open we know the seventh seal is not open yet so i'm still not open yet because that's not the way to find truth the way to find truth is a divine revelation from the father himself who unlocks the mystery in your heart and then you have faith in what that prophet said and you let that be the measuring stick that unlocks the the whole bible you can't work backwards you've got to work from the revelation at the top down you can't work from the bottom up hallelujah so moses now takes a sharp tool where'd you read that brother chad it's between the lines i don't think he used a dull tool to cut out the stone oh once you catch the revelation of the word the bible's fun all the rigidity all the stiffness all the fear of having it wrong just vanishes away and all of a sudden you realize that this word is my playground this word is my land this is the streams and the hills and the fields that he gave me to enjoy this word is my eden and i can eat the fruit from it and i can go anywhere in it and i can enjoy being in eden and all of a sudden the word gets fun because moses must have took a sharp tool and cut out two tables of stone with nothing written on them and went to the mountain because brother branham had cut the top off to reveal a stone with nothing written on it and he takes that stone up to the how do you know he took the stone up to the mountain my goodness there was no real stone it was a dream he took that stone in his heart the the mystery that was there he took it with him up to the mountain in sabino cannon and then a cloud came down and revealed the name of the lord but then let's go over here to verse 27. between verse 5 and 26 uh god is speaking to moses giving him all kinds of instructions now let's let's back up and look over here at chapter 34 verse 1 it says the lord said unto moses who the two tables of stone like and to the first and i will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou breakest so the lord says i'm going to write on these tables you hew them out you bring them up with nothing written on them i'll write on them now verse 27 and the lord said unto moses write thou these words for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel and he was there with the lord 40 days and 49th he didn't either eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the ten commandments who wrote upon it moses it was moses's hand but it was the word of god moses became the tool amen that god was using to write it oh it was moses hand all right with another sharp tool where did he get that sharp tool i don't know maybe he grabbed it out of the air he was up on the mountain he went up on the mount and god said i'm going to ride on these stones he went up into the mountain expecting god to ride on the stones he had already cut the stones out so maybe he just left all of his sharp tools because god said he's going to write on this stone so he goes with unwritten stone amen in the same shape he knows it's got to be the same thing because you can't add to or take away it's got to be the same thing but moses can't write on there because moses doesn't know what it is amen so now he's got to go up and god says all right on it so where did he get the sharp instrument to write on it maybe he had his hands up rejoicing and maybe something struck his hand and maybe he took that amen and was able to carve out of the stone what was unwritten before and when he when he carved it out you realize it was an exact match to what was laying in the first word oh praise be to god friends that hits me and thrills my heart why because it's the same story a revolving history doing the same things if you know what's been you know it will be and all that is is what's been before that's what solomon told us amen this has already happened i mean brother brennan's ministry was been vindicated by the word everything he did was based on what happened in the word and now he was given this sword amen to cut amen out of the white stone and give us the revelation of the unspoken part of the word which was the revelation contained in the seven thunders which was the interpretation of the symbols of the seven seals that were given in symbol form amen but nobody knew what they meant and they probed that and they poked at it but the revelation was laying in the seven thunders which wasn't written down which john heard but couldn't write but brother branham picked it up and where did he get it brother branham says it's not a man this didn't come from a man it's been the angels of the lord amen brother branham was the tool that god used to speak from the microphone but he's not the one who can make up the words it had to come directly as a revelation from god almighty to interpret the unwritten stone that was under the cap and so brother branham didn't reveal anything amen he was only the tool that god used to reveal it because moses didn't write on those stones god said i'll write on those stones just like god said i'll go down and deliver my people now moses you come and go i'll write on those tables of stone now moses pick up your pen and write [Applause] you see friends when we take the form in rigidity amen away from the word the word gets super fun and exciting because you see it not as stories but as one story and an unfolding of the one mystery the one plan the one goal god had in his mind what was that christ the mystery of god revealed oh praise god i'm so far off my notes i don't even know where i'm at hey amen brother man said don't you say thank you to no man in the seventh seal this didn't come from a man he said i knew not those things he didn't get it through study he got it by divine revelation guess what you're not going to get it through study now i firmly recommend reading your bible every day and i firmly recommend reading and listening to the message constantly but without a divine revelation you may catch some of the writing on the outside of the stone but you'll never catch the writing on the inside that comes by divine revelation and that's the mystery that is unlocked in our hearts hallelujah brother ram goes back to junior jackson's dream he says and junior turned around this is 1964 questions and answers from august of 64. and junior turned around and looked and he seen me going towards the west towards the setting of the sun going over one mountain another mountain real fast just kidding then he turned around and looked and seen me gone a whole big group of them took off that way and they they wanted to go this and do that after i told them to stay there stay here stay right here this is the place then when i did that i went just exactly and a little bit after that the angel of the lord appeared to me go out to arizona yonder i heard that blast go off and went there and what was it the boy dreamed that dream just exactly right and the lord gave that right remember i said there's something i'm going there for and when i went there it was the mystery of the seven seals that was sealed up on the inside of that mountain of the lord the mystery of the seven seals was sealed up on the inside of the mountain of the lord that mountain was the word had the word around it it was the readable part the writing on the outside of the book but there was something on the inside of the book that light had never shined on before and it was the mystery that was laying through the whole bible and it was sealed up with seven seals and that was the revelation of the seven thunders would come forth and unlock what that mystery was and here we are recipients of the interpretation of the white stone brother remember says in the feast of trumpets immediately after that the angel of the lord appeared and told about the seventh or the seven seals that i was a return back to jeffersonville and preached the seven seals there if i've ever said anything that was inspired it was in that there were the angel of the lord met us and the bible became a new bible there it opened up and revealed all the things that the reformers and things had left out it was the complete revelation of jesus christ what is the book of revelation the revelation of jesus christ what's the whole bible the revelation of jesus christ what's the mystery of the seven seals the complete revelation of jesus christ and jesus christ is the revelation of the whole thing and he's in me and i'm in him do you understand i'm i'm in the white stone do you understand i'm in the thunders it was speaking about me the uh the mystery i'm part of the mystery amen christ is the mystery of god revealed christ is male and female i'm part of the female expression of christ amen which is the thought of god anointed word for the day amen that's who we are we are the white mystery that was hidden in the rock that's what was revealed at the end time when he took that sharp tool which was a tool to be that he could use it to cut the word and pop it off and show that there's more to this than what we've been reading you know moses brought the word but then the apostle paul he went you know the apostle paul had a rigid understanding of the old testament and in his rigid understanding of the old testament he called jesus false and everything his disciples taught heresy is that the truth the apostle paul he was taught under gamaliel brother bam said one of the best schools one of the best teachers in all the land he had the best of best religious upbringing and teaching and he knew the word forward and backwards and in his rigid understanding in his bible school knowledge in his baptist sunday school literature knowledge i don't mean to be mean but that's the truth he had a rigid understanding and in that rigid understanding jesus christ couldn't be him because a disqualification and he didn't come and he didn't conquer and blah blah blah blah blah whatever reasons he had they had their case don't you think the pharisees didn't have points one through ten on why jesus could not be come on they knew the word amen don't think the devil doesn't know the bible he knows the bible he's listened to all the tapes he was there when they were preached the first time but he doesn't know the mystery locked in my heart he doesn't know the white stone inside my soul he can't get there amen he can get to my mind but he can't get down there he doesn't know the mystery that's been unlocked he doesn't know who i really am and whether he believes it or not i don't care because the seals have been broken in my heart hallelujah and so paul in his rigid understanding couldn't jesus couldn't be right what he taught couldn't be right and his disciples couldn't be right but with one encounter with the pillar of fire he caught a revelation from god himself and went to the desert of arabia and he said i was not taught this by man neither went to jerusalem but i was taught by god himself so where did paul get the revelation the same place brother branham god at the same place moses got it amen and when he came back with the revelation totally different than the way he saw it before i knew not those things when it came to me it was totally different than the way i had it worked out before where did we hear that and he came back and he used the same bible he used to reject christ now he used the same bible to teach christ he didn't need a new bible he needed the mystery of the bible to be unlocked to him and christ is the mystery of god revealed and christ was the mystery through the whole testament every prophet the psalms the prophets were all speaking of him and when paul caught a vision of him and the mystery unlocked he could go back to the same bible and now go from synagogue to synagogue teaching christ brother branham he said at the opening of the seven seals my bible became a new book to me he made no edits or corrections to the written text but it was all together different than he had ever seen it worked out before and for us when we catch the revelation of this word what's was the unwritten portion of the mystery locked in by seven mysterious thunders when god opens that in our heart and we see the mystery it's god becoming tangible it's god becoming flesh how in the earth stoned by stone see there's a part of you that's from earth but there's a part of you that's in heaven then there's another part of you that's your soul that can span both heaven and earth is that true i mean i don't mean to say anything wrong but you are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus right now and now we are the living stones you see the dirt you see the rocks but back inside of there's a white rock it's the unwritten portion of my life amen there's a mountain in the new heaven and new earth that pushes out of the earth a mountain that pushes out of the earth because part of you came out of the earth but part of you was already there in heaven which is the heavenly city new jerusalem that was here when moses was here brother braham said it was right over him the whole time and you're there and you're here so part of the city part of the kingdom part of the mountain of god pushes up from the earth and the rest of it comes down from heaven and sits over top until heaven and earth unite again permanently and forever where's that white stone unwritten party brother madam said and feast the trumpets he said this is the complete revelation of jesus christ and the seven seals have the mystery hit of what it all was and is supposed to open it in the last day at the laodicean age at the end of time thanks be to god that finishes the message to the church that finishes it when when they look back and see what has been and see where it's all brought up to that finishes at the age of the church is the church age finished it's finished at the opening of the seven seals so let's go back to daniel's prophecy there's a mountain let's just call this mountain the word of god or the kingdom of god you can call it either one the kingdom of god the word of god god himself and then you've got the image of satan's kingdom coming by wisdom coming by deception coming by splendor and grandeur then you have a stone cut out of the mountain without hands that comes and smites the image in its feet you know the word of god the bible christ is the revelation of god christ is the revelation of the bible revelation 1 1 the revelation of jesus christ or you could look at this stone as the book of revelation as the seventh under mystery as the seven thunders as the message as the book of revelation what is it a stone at the top of the mountain this is the mountain the book of revelation is the stone at the top of the mountain just bear with me i'm just showing this as a type and that stone the revelation of jesus christ which is the book of revelation came off of the mountain at the end time at the days of these ten kings five west five east trying to mix won't mix one takes a shoe off and beats it on the desk so that you won't miss it [Music] so that you'll know that you're at the days of the ten kings now it's time for the smiting stone to come smite how's the smiting stone going to smite what happens as soon as khrushchev beats his shoe in october 1960 december 1960 brother branham starts into the book of revelations with the revelation of the seven church ages why because there's coming a stone when he gets to those mysterious thunders what stone maybe that cloud shape pyramid the headstone the capstone the headship coming to the body the fullness of the word the fullness of the holy ghost the full life coming where coming to unite with what the mountain coming up out of the earth amen in the revelation coming down from heaven to unite once again to cap it off to show amen the full declaration of christ in bride form what is that stone i'll tell you for me it's the book of revelation the prophet opened it's the seven thunders it's the revelation of jesus christ that has smashed denominational teachings smashed the and the harlot teaching smashed jezebel religion and then now for me i don't know about for you but for me it has crumbled denominationalism it has destroyed carnal understanding it has ripped apart amen the and harlot system and it has blown it like the chaff of the wind and out of that has grown a mountain what mountain the mountain of jesus christ how in the form of his bride amen he's already been manifest in fullness in the form of jesus christ amen but now at the end of the new testament it's time for a new testament bride to rise in the full measure of the new testament to display the fullness of jesus christ in feminine form and that stone which was the revelation of jesus christ the seven thunders the book of revelation the capstone the headship call it whatever you want whatever makes you feel good it's all the same thing coming down and smiting this religious system that has worked through the gentiles from babylon actually from cain through nimrod all the way from assyria to babylon through egypt all the way down through and now in the end time by the revelation of the white stone it has destroyed that and we know the truth and what is the truth i don't need a religion i don't need a priest i don't need a man i don't need a system i don't need a book i don't need somebody's interpretation why because i was with god before the foundation of the world god is in me now and i'm going back there and it matters not amen what happens i'm a recipient of grace because my name was written on the last book of life before the foundation of the world and i don't need your system to get me through i don't need your arm to lean on i don't need your crutch amen because i've already made it in the mind of god why because i am part of god and i am part of the expression of god amen i'm one of the living stones that he is living in the shekinah glory of god is behind the dirt there's a white stone in my soul that's a revelation of who i am and i don't need a system of man they've been blown and scattered out of that has grown a mountain of what of revelation growing growing more word more word more word growing until it fills the horse sometimes we have such wrong understanding if there's a mountain that fills the whole earth everybody would know about it jesus was the light of the world but the light of the world cannot cure willful blindness a pharisee standing this close to jesus christ who was the light of the world saw no light and because he saw no light didn't mean there was no light and because you can't see a kingdom filling the earth doesn't mean there's not a kingdom filling the earth because you can't see the light at the top of this when the headships come down a light arise and shine for thy light has come shalom good morning it is the rising of the sun the world is in darkness and blackness the moon's blacked out the sun has turned to sackcloth where under the sixth seal the earth is under judgment and completely blacked out blind and cannot see but that doesn't mean the light's not here because the light is here arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee where upon the mountain that has filled the earth the throne of god is at the top shining the light through the whole world [Music] and today there's a bright shining light there's a kingdom of god upon this earth and it's a bright light that expels all darkness and all evil and it's the kingdom of god and if you can't see it it's not my fault because jesus came as the light of the world and it wasn't his fault if somebody couldn't see it but i'll tell you something if you can see it the gates of the city are open day and night they never closed you're welcome to come into the provided place of worship you're welcome to come into christ you're welcome to enter into this great revelation this great mountain that has risen amen from the capstone coming and smiting the image of the beast now it has risen to a mountain with gates that stand wide open and you're welcome to come if you can see it come because the spirit and the bride say come the ministry of the bride has come unto this holy mountain come under the light of the age come under the light of jehovah himself the capstone the headship at the top of the mountain shining the light you don't have to stay in darkness you don't have to stay in the world and you don't have to stay in gentile religion there is a kingdom on this earth filling the whole earth and the gates stand open always now she has no need of natural light no need of the sun no need of the moon why because the lamb is the light thereof and the lamb has come to unite the bride and the lamb is the light thereof she doesn't need your walled city she doesn't need your defense and protection the lamb is her protection her walled city is the word that she's part of praise be to god let's look at one more scripture together lots more but we'll get to it some other time revelation chapter 2 verse 17. revelation chapter 2 verse 17. he that hath an ear let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and i will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it i will give him the hidden manna what hidden man the manna that was behind the veil the manna that was only reserved for the priest so you better be a king or a priest to come in behind this bail the veil that was reserved for a certain specific time after the feast of atonement the full word because it's the word that bled for you the word died for you he's going to bring him to the true and living word the true and living sacrifice the word and then the veil is going to be open brother branham speaks in a couple places of a vision he had and he wrote it in a book i can't remember the name of the book but anyways in the vision he had years ago there was a veil in the west and now behind that there was a mountain of the bread of life brethren talks about this and searches this the time he said there was a veil out to the west he said there was a mountain of the bread of life he said lord that's revealed right before our face today what was that great mountain what's the bread of life the word of god that we feed on christ is the bread of life christ is the manna that came down from heaven and now he says i will give you the hidden manna and i will give him a white stone stone is a revelation white a pure revelation a revelation that only comes from god no light has shined on this yet i'll give him a white stone what's going to be in that white stone a new name which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it see brother chad have you received a new name you betcha what is it does it sound hebrew does it have a certain exotic ring to it yes it's called mrs jesus christ i received a white stone and in that white stone was the revelation of my new name i've always been part of him i will always be part of him i am part of jesus christ and i'm here to display the part of mrs jesus christ i hope you've received your white stone with a new name but i've received my white stone with a new name and because i received that stone to me it became a smiting stone that would smite all the intellectuals away and i say god be praised everything in brother branham's life was orchestrated and everything meant something and brother branham comes now in 1964 to sabino canyon he comes down and there's going to be judgment set in because they've rejected christ and there's a whirlwind that comes down three times and it claps three times and it rips the rocks out of the wall and cast them all about it says judgment striking the west coast and there the whirlwind went up and alaska nearly sank but i want to ask you what did all those little rocks look like they were all three cornered rocks brothers in a pyramid form like capstone rocks like revelation of the capstone headship the word what is that there was a headstone come down and blasted out of the rock you and i and now it's not one capstone they're scattered all over he said what was that little pyramid he said the revelation of the oneness of god the three or one father son and holy ghost in that day you'll know i'm in the father father and me i in you you and me making them all one what is the revelation i'm part of the capstone i'm part of the pyramid i'm part of the word i'm part of the white mystery that was hid behind the print on this paper for thousands of years that i'm there amen and he busted those stones and scattered them all over so you can pick one up and realize that i am a little stoned in the image of the great headstone and i'm here to display the mystery what is it all that was in god he poured into christ all that was in christ he poured in the church i in you you and me amen all making them one amen what is it the revelation of the godhead includes all the little stones [Music] includes you and i how did you get that brother chad because i was given a white stone i was given a white stone and at the right time god would use a prophet with a sharp tool to rip the top off of my life and shine light on this stone and give me a revelation of what my name is because he would come in the first seal now that he's breaking the seals now he's shining the light he comes in the first seal and he says now i'm no longer going to call you church i'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand it because there's an understanding that can only come to bride not to church because the church has been smashed the denominational church but now at the smashing of the smiting stone now there's a revelations coming and you can only understand if you get a new name [Applause] [Music] and now the prophet gave them a new name gave us all a new name i no longer call you church i call you bride amen hallelujah if you ever get a white stone and the prophet ever comes and peels the top off and shines the light on that white stone you'll realize i'm part of god an attribute of god misses jesus christ an expression of christ on earth i can no more be lost than god can be lost if you get that revelation then just watch all the denominational systems start blowing like shaft in the wind and all the scare of the enemy and all the fear of a point system and making good points to please god and coming to church every time the doors are open so i can go to heaven and having to say i believe the message even went in my heart i have doubts about it if you ever see the white stone interpreted to you it'll blow all of that away all of that chaff of that man-made denominational rubbish blows away and all of a sudden you've got the interpretation of your white stone because it's your new name personally to you not because a preacher said it not because mom and dad said it not because brother branham said it in the first seal but because god himself revealed my position to me and he gave me the stone and he revealed to me my new name in a pure revelation that comes from father god himself praise god let's all stand musicians if you could come hallelujah god is good friends and i love him with my whole heart i tell you this revelation is more than anything to me i'd rather have this revelation than have my next breath i'd rather have this revelation than my next meal job home it doesn't matter i'd rather have this revelation and if we catch this revelation who cares if you lose your job tomorrow who cares if your house burns down the next day and all your friends tell you you're crazy with this revelation everything's gonna be fine because all i got to do is portray christ in whatever measure he wants for this little bitty space of time and then i realize i've got a millennium i got a new heavens and new earth i've got everything my heart's ever long for is here and coming to me amen and coming in greater manifestation it doesn't matter anymore government rises government falls it matters not to me anymore people complain people leave people come it matters not anymore why because of the revelation of my name in the white stone that's why it doesn't matter because my position is secure my revelation is solid i'm not going anywhere oh it's the only thing that matters friends it's the only thing that matters praise god let's sing brother they were hopeless beating and so weary slaves are waiting for the day of liberty just to see the glorious sunrise from the highest mountaintop and this dawn will see their shackles falling off [Music] it's the rising of the sun a new day has begun rays of mercy made us free from sin today oh the joy that fills my soul for the message is my all thank you jesus for this day of liberty the grave is empty he's risen what a day because i live you shall live as well he said resurrected with christ jesus lift your hands towards the sky your reward is to be ever at it's the rising of the sun i can feel the quickening power amazing grace has read the veil for us that day our redeemer and our god soon he'll catch away his pride thank you jesus for this day of victory it's the rising of the sun i can feel the quickening power amazing grace has read the veil for us that day our redeemer and our guy soon he'll catch away his bride thank you jesus for this day of victory is your grave open have you resurrected into his kingdom oh hallelujah everything's fine worst day of your life everything's fine why because i know where i came from i know who i am i know where i'm going the mystery has been revealed to me it wasn't good enough that it was revealed to brother banham it's got to be revealed to me when it's revealed to me something settles down on the inside we can get worked up that happens we get worked up we get bent out of shape things happen stir us up but there's something on the inside that calms us back down it says all is well all as well says bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this day god we just want to say how precious your word is to us god how thankful we are that in the days of those ten kings you sent a smiting stone to smite and all the power of the enemy's been broken and all the tricks and deception has been broken god and now we can go free god i just ask that you would just purge us now lord and set us free from ourselves our old thinking our own carnal understanding give us the liberty to enjoy your word and god have preeminence among us display yourself through these vessels of clay take full control and have preeminence lord in this place and among your people for we love you lord and we thank you god we ask in jesus name that you would go with us you take us safely along the way and let us be a light in a dark and dismal world let us shine a true light for the the sun has risen and it's risen upon us and it's risen in our hearts and let us shine it forth lord that other weary travelers might find their way to this celestial city for we love you god and we ask your blessing over us your children and all that we endeavor to do in jesus christ's name we pray amen i'm resting on the finished word jesus christ today all
