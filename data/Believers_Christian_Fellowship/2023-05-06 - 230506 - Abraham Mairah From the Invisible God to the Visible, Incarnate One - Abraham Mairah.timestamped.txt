[14:50] amen God bless you all this evening
[14:53] certainly a privilege to be here
[14:55] together and we've been looking forward
[14:57] to this day for quite some time with
[14:59] some anticipation and planning and it
[15:01] has arrived amen We Trust amen that
[15:04] we're going to hear from God tonight
[15:06] because we've come expecting
[15:09] and the prophet of God told us you get
[15:10] what you expect amen so I hope you came
[15:13] with a big expectation
[15:15] because we want to receive what we came
[15:17] expecting
[15:18] men we all know and love brother Abraham
[15:21] he's been with us many times he's been
[15:23] coming here since 2015 the first time he
[15:26] came I didn't realize it had been that
[15:28] long until we were fellowshipping and he
[15:30] shared that I've been always thankful
[15:32] for his visit thankful for his
[15:33] friendship thankful for the ministry
[15:34] that God's entrusted into him it's
[15:36] always edified me I've been built up by
[15:40] the word that's been preached but I'm
[15:42] also thankful that we have an extra pool
[15:43] here because we have sister mercy and
[15:47] brother Moses sharibe and sister Mercy
[15:50] was brother Abraham was her guardian
[15:52] when she was young he raised her as an
[15:54] adopted daughter amen and so he's always
[15:56] got to come back and see his new
[15:57] grandchild amen
[15:59] so we thank God for that little extra
[16:01] pool that we have in this area but yeah
[16:04] brother Abraham's been a good friend we
[16:06] really appreciate this we want to we
[16:08] want to turn the pulpit over to him and
[16:10] we want to pull on the gift and receive
[16:12] what God has for us and trust that God
[16:15] will meet us
[16:16] also we want to welcome all the visitors
[16:18] or several that have traveled in from
[16:20] several different places we want to say
[16:21] God bless you you're very welcome we're
[16:23] very glad that you're here also if
[16:25] you're remaining for tomorrow the
[16:27] morning service will be at 10 30 in the
[16:29] morning we expect brother Abraham to be
[16:31] ministering again in the morning but
[16:32] also wanted to let you know that we're
[16:34] having a fellowship dinner immediately
[16:35] after the service over in the fellowship
[16:37] hall and everybody is welcome to stay
[16:39] and join in and we'll also be having a
[16:41] communion service tomorrow evening so we
[16:44] want to make you aware of that
[16:46] and at this time we're doing invite our
[16:48] brother Abraham to come and share the
[16:50] word
[16:51] like
[16:55] you're
[16:57] rise up on me
[17:07] [Music]
[17:14] [Music]
[17:18] Jesus
[17:23] [Music]
[17:26] him
[17:28] in the light
[17:30] of his glory
[17:34] and
[17:36] embrace one more time
[17:40] so turn
[17:42] your eyes
[17:45] Upon Jesus
[17:58] [Music]
[18:03] and the things of Earth
[18:08] will grow
[18:14] in the light of his glory and embrace
[18:24] I mean just greet you once more than a
[18:27] marvelous Jesus Christ
[18:29] just happy to be with you
[18:31] to see your face is still Shining
[18:35] for the glory of God Amen but you still
[18:37] love the Lord
[18:39] and he loves you that is a sure guess
[18:43] because the Bible says having loved his
[18:45] own he loved them to the very end
[18:48] so maybe you maybe sit for a few minutes
[18:50] or maybe four moments uh bring greetings
[18:53] from Uganda
[18:55] especially from our home Church
[18:58] and my family
[19:00] and also from
[19:02] across a few areas
[19:05] Kenya
[19:07] and Uganda different churches you know
[19:10] very many people love you
[19:13] they share with you the word and of
[19:16] course I appreciate the ministry here
[19:19] you've been a blessing to very many
[19:21] people around the world and what shall I
[19:24] say about the ministers here I go to
[19:27] hear a portion of where someone preached
[19:29] I think last Wednesday by the other
[19:33] brother it was wonderful
[19:34] so
[19:36] we appreciate all of you and um
[19:40] I know that we are not having much time
[19:42] here
[19:44] keep saying it but maybe I keep coming
[19:47] and you think because you keep coming
[19:49] still more time
[19:53] but you see Paul say the same thing is
[19:55] off I think for us we are more sure that
[19:58] we are more on the edge of it than all
[20:01] those who have say the same statements
[20:03] before
[20:03] [Music]
[20:05] amen so the Bible says I mean the
[20:07] prophet I think preached and said they
[20:09] died in an expression
[20:11] and they they were like about receiving
[20:14] Paul didn't even exclude himself when he
[20:16] said we who shall be alive I shall be
[20:19] alive
[20:20] he counted himself among others Whom The
[20:22] Rapture should find when he's still
[20:24] alive
[20:25] so what about us today
[20:27] so I think I must really appreciate all
[20:31] friends who've come I conceive a number
[20:33] of friends who have come from different
[20:36] places and brother Dan rutleaf just been
[20:40] here he did a very nice job for me and I
[20:45] enjoyed that brief one day in his place
[20:48] yeah talk about wonderful men of God who
[20:51] exhibit the love of God and the care is
[20:54] is a very nice brother and his wife so I
[20:58] can see yeah
[21:00] yeah a few friends also from other
[21:02] places is such a honor to have you uh I
[21:07] was asking brother Chad he was saying
[21:09] where are there some friends who've come
[21:11] just to attend these meetings I said
[21:13] well I don't know I think I've preached
[21:17] I'm I'm almost done I've preached I've
[21:19] preached myself finished kaput now so
[21:23] I would rather just come and sit and
[21:26] listen here but somehow he will not let
[21:30] me do that
[21:31] you know
[21:33] yeah and that's why I got it I think
[21:35] that's why God put him here and what
[21:38] shall I say about um
[21:41] the friends where I was in Charlotte
[21:43] they sent their greetings here
[21:46] um Pastor Shambo Stephen and his church
[21:49] and of course have been taking good care
[21:52] of
[21:53] my brother Chad and his lovely wife
[21:56] Angie
[21:58] I think yeah it is my second home here I
[22:02] always enjoy it
[22:03] so much appreciate so thank you for your
[22:07] smiles I can see them before so I think
[22:10] they they they just give me a good
[22:13] foundation like you're saying catch him
[22:16] so we are not having a problem with you
[22:18] we are having a problem with the Devil
[22:20] so you shouldn't have a face that is
[22:24] scared just relax and be free in the
[22:27] princess of the Lord
[22:29] amen so I think uh with those few words
[22:34] I would just request that we all stand
[22:37] up and have a world of Prayer
[22:44] and maybe you want to be remembered in
[22:46] prayer for whatever reason
[22:50] our God is not scared he's not even
[22:53] tired of you
[22:56] worry that you are lifting up your hand
[22:59] he loves it
[23:01] so just lift up your hand and we pray
[23:03] together
[23:04] loving heavenly father I want to thank
[23:06] you for this evening
[23:07] for this wonderful time that you've
[23:09] given us to be in the house of the Lord
[23:12] and Lord Fellowship around your word
[23:16] Lord is standing in this place and
[23:18] knowing how many sermons have been
[23:20] preached to hear
[23:22] the Lord is standard that you've brought
[23:25] here the word that comes forth
[23:28] I'm not even worth the Lord but I'm
[23:31] praying that God will come down and
[23:34] just add a little break today in the
[23:36] lives of your children
[23:38] deal with them gently
[23:41] saving them perfecting them bringing us
[23:45] Lord God to that station of the measure
[23:48] of the fullness of Christ for us why we
[23:51] are here we are still here because
[23:53] there's something that we lord God have
[23:56] to come to
[23:57] may you help us tonight
[23:59] meet the needs of your children you know
[24:02] them each and every one whatever they
[24:04] have come with just anoint your servant
[24:07] as I step completely out of the way and
[24:09] come and bless your people through your
[24:13] word as you break your bread of life
[24:15] which is yourself
[24:17] in Jesus name we pray
[24:20] amen
[24:22] and I'm just going to go to this very
[24:25] common scripture I think almost every
[24:27] preacher has ever preached about at
[24:28] scripture
[24:30] and it's very common even on a funerals
[24:33] so I think it should be today's today
[24:36] should be a funeral for someone
[24:42] in John chapter 14 I'm just speaking
[24:46] some a few verses um I'm picking verse
[24:48] one
[24:50] and then I'll pick verse 7 to 12.
[24:54] Saint John Chapter 14 verse 1 it says
[24:57] let not your heart
[24:58] be troubled
[25:01] and when the word let
[25:03] is applied it means permitted not
[25:07] allow or not
[25:10] so it's up to you
[25:12] either to permit it to allow it or not
[25:16] so he says let not your head be troubled
[25:21] and he's addressing many but if you
[25:23] realize he doesn't say let not your
[25:25] heart
[25:28] you say let not your heart
[25:33] be troubled
[25:35] you believe in God
[25:38] believe also in me
[25:43] so it was very easy company practice
[25:47] to believe in God
[25:49] but now the challenge you was believe in
[25:53] me
[25:56] and verse 7 he says
[25:59] if you had known me
[26:02] you should have known my father also
[26:06] and from henceforth you know him
[26:08] and I've seen him
[26:15] Philip says unto him Lord show us the
[26:18] father and suffices us
[26:21] Jesus says unto him have I been so long
[26:25] time with you
[26:27] and yet you have not known me Philip
[26:30] he that has seen me as seen the father
[26:34] how says Thou then show us the father
[26:39] now this is just chapter 14 of John
[26:43] I think it was just maybe the longest
[26:46] will be made about two years or one and
[26:48] a half years Jesus has been with the
[26:50] disciples and he's saying I've been with
[26:52] you a long time
[26:55] so how you would you think about
[26:57] yourself how many summons have you had
[27:00] how many years have you been here
[27:04] how does Jesus now talk about your time
[27:07] with him
[27:13] so he says I've been a long time so long
[27:16] time with you
[27:18] in the year you have not known him in
[27:19] Philip he that has seen the seen me has
[27:24] seen the father
[27:25] the house says though
[27:28] then show us the father
[27:30] believes thou not that I'm in the father
[27:33] and the father in me the ones that I
[27:36] speak unto you I speak not of myself but
[27:40] the father that dwareth in me he do with
[27:44] the works yes believe that believe me
[27:48] that I mean the father and the father in
[27:51] me
[27:52] or else believe me for the very work
[27:56] sake
[27:58] very liberalization to you he that
[28:01] believes on me the works that I do shall
[28:03] he do also in the Greater Works than
[28:07] these shall he do because I go unto the
[28:11] father
[28:12] I just wanted to read something else in
[28:14] the book of Ephesians chapter 1
[28:18] and Paul speaking about his ministry
[28:21] saying in verse 9 having made it known
[28:23] unto us
[28:24] the mystery of his will
[28:28] according
[28:30] to his good pleasure which he had
[28:32] purpose in himself
[28:35] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[28:38] of times
[28:40] he might gather together in one all
[28:43] things in Christ both which are in
[28:47] heaven and which are on earth even in
[28:51] him
[28:53] in whom also we have obtained an
[28:56] inheritance being predestinated
[28:58] according to the purpose of him which
[29:00] who worketh all the things after the
[29:02] cancer of his own will
[29:04] that we should be to the praise of his
[29:08] glory
[29:10] who first trusted in Christ
[29:17] may God bless his word and bless you may
[29:20] be seated
[29:26] dispensation
[29:29] in the indispensation of the fullness of
[29:31] times
[29:34] he wants to gather and he uses the word
[29:36] might
[29:38] so it's not going to apply to everybody
[29:41] um
[29:44] he doesn't say he must together all
[29:46] things
[29:49] but that is part of his program is part
[29:52] of his plan
[29:55] amen so today I'm talking about
[29:58] from the invisible God
[30:01] to the visible incarnate one
[30:04] that is moving from the invisible God
[30:08] to the visible incarnate one
[30:13] man so I have a subject from that which
[30:16] I'm saying
[30:17] move your business your faith business
[30:22] to God is new dispensation office
[30:30] it doesn't want your business in the
[30:32] other office
[30:34] he wants you to move it
[30:37] to the new office
[30:42] it strikes you that Jesus himself is
[30:44] speaking to disciples
[30:48] and he's addressing them and he says let
[30:51] not your hearts be troubled
[30:57] you believe in God
[31:00] I know you believe in God
[31:02] but now the challenge is
[31:04] believe also in me
[31:11] because that God
[31:13] is no longer that God that you thought
[31:15] of
[31:16] he has left it at the office
[31:23] but it had not really got to the
[31:25] understanding they are not
[31:28] received it the disciples the Believers
[31:31] they were with him
[31:34] they had seen the sign of the Messiah
[31:37] they had him preach
[31:39] they are saying that demonstration of
[31:41] creating power
[31:43] unmatched in history
[31:47] and what was it for
[31:51] but here the way they were still trying
[31:53] to hold on to the other office
[31:56] believing the way they are the Jews have
[31:59] been eating
[32:01] yet they are in a new dispensation this
[32:03] is a dispensation of Christ
[32:06] God has become flesh
[32:10] and they were here privileged to be with
[32:13] him
[32:16] they were living with him walking with
[32:18] him eating with him
[32:21] seeing him do
[32:24] like he's telling them even if it was
[32:26] hard for you to believe me Percy believe
[32:29] me for the works
[32:33] the Miracles the sign is the Wonders the
[32:36] display of this financial
[32:38] why is it too hard for you to understand
[32:41] that there is a change of office God is
[32:44] now here
[32:49] Isaiah 9 has been fulfilled
[32:57] glory be to God
[32:59] so the disciples if you remember my
[33:03] sermon which I preached here when I was
[33:05] here I was talking about going Beyond
[33:07] you know you know receiving the mystery
[33:11] the mysterious reality of the moral and
[33:15] a prophet of his ministry you got beyond
[33:17] the office amen so what did the maracai
[33:20] for introduce so that's why those who
[33:23] are stuck at the office of Malacca
[33:24] before are struggling as suffering are
[33:29] getting threatened they are getting
[33:31] weakened they are confused
[33:33] because that dispensation is over
[33:37] why are you holding on an office of the
[33:39] Prophet he's not even there he came
[33:41] preached the message showed you Christ
[33:43] identified reality for you and said here
[33:46] he is here's your bridegroom now you are
[33:49] still stuckled with the umbrella
[33:51] Williams please
[33:57] this is not time for that
[34:01] this time for the reality that he
[34:04] identified so Jesus himself is talking
[34:07] to the disciples and he says you look
[34:09] you are making yourself get to a bird
[34:13] when you stick to the other office
[34:17] when you remain to the office of the
[34:19] invisible God the god of Israel the
[34:22] great Jehovah almighty God of the Old
[34:25] Testament that related to us through the
[34:27] prophets and we could approach him
[34:29] through sacrifices and offerings and you
[34:31] know this right rights and these rituals
[34:34] and so forth we really knew the oracles
[34:36] we kept the Ten Commandments we know the
[34:38] Torah you related to him like that
[34:43] that one is no code
[34:46] you will remain trouble in yourself so
[34:49] it is in your power to travel yourself
[34:52] to fret yourself
[34:54] to confuse yourself or it's in your
[34:57] power to come to me also believe
[35:00] transfer that Faith amen
[35:04] from that office and bring it to me I am
[35:07] here I am the answer I am the reality of
[35:11] that office you were looking for
[35:13] something real something tangible that
[35:16] you can lay a hold on that you can touch
[35:18] and feel
[35:20] Hallelujah
[35:22] and Grace has provided it for you yeah
[35:25] yeah and here it is
[35:27] you are with it
[35:28] and you are still looking back
[35:32] you didn't go to believe in God
[35:35] and that was another dispensation this
[35:38] is a a new one this dispensation is that
[35:42] God has put on flesh he's here
[35:45] amen
[35:47] blessed be the name of the Lord
[35:51] I just love the Lord you know amen
[35:55] I wish I was a good Preacher Brother
[35:56] Chuck
[35:58] then I would start preaching now
[36:02] blessed be the name of the Lord
[36:04] now he says
[36:06] the prophet he says
[36:09] God has got a purpose in a message why
[36:11] cry speak he says God has got a purpose
[36:14] for you being here
[36:17] see if you can only be
[36:20] get to that place
[36:23] how much trouble you save God and
[36:26] yourself
[36:28] you serve God a lot of trouble and
[36:30] yourself when you come to that place
[36:33] you come to identify yourself with a
[36:36] reality he wants to bring you to when
[36:39] you come when you come to the up
[36:40] upgraded position it is a transformation
[36:44] don't stay stuck to a place
[36:47] God is to bring you to something friends
[36:50] we must go home and we are not going to
[36:54] go home by a god that is in heaven
[37:00] Our Father Who Art in Heaven
[37:03] yes
[37:07] but now that where is that father where
[37:10] is that God
[37:16] so I I'm just here to challenge
[37:18] ourselves today
[37:20] asking the grace of God if you can help
[37:22] me you see he says if you can get to
[37:25] that place
[37:27] you how much trouble you save God and
[37:31] yourself to
[37:34] so when you don't get to that spot
[37:38] you give God a lot of trouble
[37:42] because you are at an office
[37:44] that you are crying to
[37:47] you are disturbing him
[37:50] and he has given you the solution the
[37:52] solution is staring in the face he's
[37:54] here
[37:56] but you are stuck there and you are
[37:58] saying God God help me God answer this
[38:03] God do this now the prophet says
[38:05] somewhere where I said now we pray for
[38:07] the sick now we pray for to solve
[38:10] problems but time is coming that you
[38:12] shall speak amen you shall say
[38:16] now folks
[38:18] When shall these things be
[38:21] when are we going to come to that
[38:24] every other sign that the Bible speaks
[38:26] about for the end time preparing us for
[38:29] the Rapture is very clear it's very
[38:31] evident every sign you can read of the
[38:33] Bible what is remaining is for us to
[38:36] come to that to come to that point where
[38:40] God knows what is the new takes care of
[38:43] you what's the new takes care of every
[38:46] situation
[38:47] and you will not need anybody but he is
[38:51] in you Christ in you the hope of glory
[38:56] so God is having trouble
[38:59] by people who are supposed to give him
[39:01] no trouble
[39:09] oh
[39:10] just imagine if all is summons that we
[39:13] have been hearing all these years just
[39:16] imagine all the preachings all the good
[39:18] Summoners that we have had the
[39:19] revelations the Mysteries the teachings
[39:21] the expositions just imagine if all that
[39:25] became life in you
[39:29] just imagine all the courts that we have
[39:31] had all these years what if really you
[39:34] concept I mean you receive them and they
[39:38] become flesh they become manifested
[39:47] he says you believe in God believe also
[39:49] in me now we are coming to something
[39:53] because you see it's it was a common
[39:56] ground
[39:59] and God is warning us always to go away
[40:01] from the common ground
[40:08] that's why brother Branham where as long
[40:10] as he was the first and second policy
[40:12] that was like Common Ground the
[40:14] denomination of the world and everybody
[40:15] was accepting him
[40:17] but when he started to break through
[40:19] into the word
[40:22] the unveiling of the world and the word
[40:25] is God
[40:27] in the beginning was the word the word
[40:30] that created everything the locals
[40:34] the pill of Fire coming down and he says
[40:38] the quickening power came down to open
[40:40] the seals
[40:43] so the seals broke and the Word was
[40:45] unveiled and the word is that logos and
[40:48] the logos coming to you becoming that
[40:50] same original
[40:52] spoken in what
[40:55] he created the universe and it's here
[40:58] Tabernacle in you and it's there
[41:03] just you to come to terms to the fact
[41:05] that it's there
[41:07] that's where the problem is
[41:10] that's why we are still troubled
[41:12] troubled with the disease with the
[41:14] stress with this we did that
[41:17] problem this problem that this one hits
[41:19] me this one who Do You Think Can Hurt
[41:22] God and it bothers him
[41:26] you are still bothered by being hated
[41:29] because you have not yet realized who
[41:31] you are you are still abused and it
[41:33] affects you because you have not yet
[41:35] realized who you are you are still
[41:37] attacked by the devil and you get scared
[41:39] because you have not yet realized who
[41:41] you are but when you come to know what
[41:44] you have received
[41:50] believe also
[41:52] in the third pool
[41:54] believe also any God in Iman believe in
[41:58] also that all that was in God he poured
[42:02] into Christ all that was in Christ he
[42:05] poured into the church
[42:07] can you believe that yeah
[42:13] lord of the middle of God so it was
[42:15] common in practice
[42:16] and it's always the problem you know
[42:18] people will always want common things
[42:24] common practice for the Jews
[42:27] to believe in the existence of
[42:28] God
[42:30] his power his capability the Harmon
[42:33] importance
[42:34] this invisible god Jehovah
[42:37] whom they would relate as I said to
[42:40] through prophets and so forth and you
[42:42] know reciting some Torah some laws
[42:46] but
[42:48] when it came to a visible God
[42:56] it was a taboo
[42:58] and another famous
[43:03] and it was to be resisted by all means
[43:07] let's read something here in John
[43:08] chapter 10.
[43:12] in verse 40 he says a and my father are
[43:16] one amen
[43:18] then the Jews took up stones again to
[43:22] Stone him
[43:23] and Jesus answered them
[43:26] many good works have I showed you from
[43:29] my father for which of those what do you
[43:33] stoned me
[43:35] now look at this
[43:39] the Jews answered him saying for a good
[43:43] work we still need not
[43:46] but for blasphemy
[43:51] foreign
[44:03] being a mere man a mere woman
[44:11] you also
[44:15] at me a man
[44:19] you are making yourself good
[44:24] that's where the whole problem was
[44:30] and that's why in a Ministry that is
[44:33] pointing you to that the devil will rise
[44:36] up even when you yourself you are
[44:38] struggling to come to that the devil
[44:40] will rise up the devil doesn't want you
[44:42] to come to that but I'm not here to give
[44:45] the devil
[44:46] what he wants
[44:50] I'm here to trouble him the more I
[44:53] trouble him the less trouble I get
[44:56] but the less I trouble him the more I
[44:59] trouble I I will permit him trouble me
[45:02] I'd rather follow the devil now
[45:08] he wants to Stone you
[45:11] Glory Be oh God
[45:13] they throw stones he claims to be this
[45:16] he claims to be that I don't claim
[45:20] I am
[45:21] [Applause]
[45:24] I Am What God Says I Am
[45:26] [Applause]
[45:28] and this is not my statement this is the
[45:30] word of God
[45:33] so I Am What God Says I am and I believe
[45:35] that I am what he said I am
[45:39] but the devil doesn't want you to accept
[45:41] that and as long as you don't accept
[45:44] that you are the devil's friend somehow
[45:48] because you have given him the
[45:50] opportunity to keep troubling you
[45:54] and you are troubling Yourself by giving
[45:57] the devil's certificate to trouble you
[46:00] and Jesus says don't allow
[46:04] your hearts to be you are hard to be
[46:06] troubled
[46:08] this way believe us
[46:10] who are with Jesus
[46:12] they were seeing the Miracles the power
[46:14] of God is played and when Jesus is
[46:17] saying something to do with his office
[46:20] and then say show us your father and he
[46:22] will suffice us
[46:24] and Jesus said have I been us a long
[46:26] time with you and you don't know me
[46:31] and and and you know you know many of us
[46:34] have been in this message we have had
[46:36] good summons and preached you know we
[46:38] have seen so many things and yet we
[46:40] don't know that this message introduced
[46:43] to God Amen
[46:46] message is
[46:50] Seven Seals an evailed Christ
[46:53] and that is the mystery that is not for
[46:56] the world
[46:57] it's not for the denominations it's not
[46:59] for nobody else it's for you that's why
[47:03] them seven standards were forbidden to
[47:04] be written he wants to write himself
[47:07] with the ionic pen in the pages of your
[47:09] heart and you get that mystery and it's
[47:11] written there with the ionic pen not
[47:13] devil is able to take it out
[47:16] and the devil is scared of certain
[47:18] people
[47:20] but we must come to that
[47:25] yes glory be to God
[47:28] they wanted to Stone him
[47:30] for one thing
[47:32] because he claimed he's the son of God
[47:41] I I I really want God to help us to see
[47:44] this
[47:47] and Paul is talking about the
[47:49] dispensation of the fullness of times
[47:52] prophetically he's talking about the
[47:54] seven Church ages
[47:55] the times the fullness
[47:59] and after that
[48:01] after the message the seven churches
[48:03] Joni started to come up here
[48:08] and what happens
[48:11] John begins to see things that he could
[48:15] not be able to see
[48:20] the formula of God God has committedly
[48:24] connected him to the theophany and he's
[48:27] able to see things that he cannot see
[48:29] that's why he says he was able to look
[48:32] at the book
[48:33] that no man was supposed to look
[48:36] how did you look attitude
[48:41] and he saw 24 elders and he's one of 24
[48:46] elders
[48:49] so in other words he saw himself
[48:52] I'm angry 24.
[48:56] but you have to come up here
[48:58] leave this argumentative levels of the
[49:02] seven Church edges
[49:04] message Believers come up here
[49:07] come into the realm where you see things
[49:10] that you couldn't see when you are there
[49:17] and even one of the elders
[49:20] told him don't don't be sorrowful
[49:24] who was that one him he's the only
[49:27] theophan is speaking to him
[49:30] don't be sorrowful John
[49:33] and he saw himself already seated there
[49:36] already with crown already worshiping
[49:38] yet he's still here passing through the
[49:40] patimos island of troubles and
[49:43] prostitution but he sees himself already
[49:45] seated there
[49:48] so now God was giving me a fortress of
[49:51] what he was going to be things that are
[49:53] to be and now here we are we our things
[49:57] that are to be we are going to begin
[49:59] them here
[50:00] because you need that power in you that
[50:03] you are in you before you go home you
[50:05] are not going to go home by grace
[50:09] makes the formation of God in you and
[50:13] God takes over and takes you up up to
[50:16] Glory
[50:17] don't just sit there and say well if God
[50:19] wants to text me to take me to heaven he
[50:22] will take me
[50:27] he might gather
[50:29] so if you are not willing to be gathered
[50:33] that he might that are all things
[50:36] he has the intention to gather all
[50:38] things
[50:39] but some of them might not be gathered
[50:45] so you just have to ask yourself do you
[50:47] want to be in the might or must
[50:50] Hallelujah the master side of God's
[50:53] program or they might decide
[50:55] [Music]
[50:59] blessed be the name of the Lord but that
[51:02] is his plan he must gather all things in
[51:04] Christ and who is Christ the anointed
[51:06] the word
[51:09] so here we see the disciples themselves
[51:12] had not come to that
[51:14] they didn't realize so I think it is not
[51:17] even that you are very very lazy
[51:21] and all that you are too much weak no it
[51:24] is the nature of human beings
[51:28] but God is so perseverant God is still
[51:31] waiting bringing us to that
[51:34] that's why if you notice these days
[51:38] I don't care which preacher stands here
[51:41] he will appoint you to that amen
[51:44] there's no other place God is pointing
[51:47] us at
[51:49] but a word in you the life of the word
[51:53] God in you so when God is in you what do
[51:56] you become
[51:58] when God is with you and for you you are
[52:01] dead
[52:01] [Applause]
[52:02] for you you are dead
[52:05] I am crucified with the Christ even if I
[52:07] am living it's not me living is Christ
[52:09] Living so if it's God in you and you are
[52:12] dead who is there
[52:14] himself amen amen who is there now
[52:20] it's like the opening of the flowers
[52:23] beginning to sprout it's beginning to
[52:26] open slowly and one of these days you
[52:29] are going to see the full reality of Who
[52:32] You Are
[52:34] and God quickened that today bring it
[52:36] quickly friends I'm tired I want to go
[52:39] home I don't know about you
[52:52] so he says
[52:54] here he says no matter what size the
[52:57] circle is in another Court here he says
[52:59] oh how many peoples gather together
[53:01] Christ is omnipro I'm going to present
[53:03] and he is the only being that is there
[53:06] that is omnipresent the devil cannot be
[53:09] omnipresent God is the only one who is
[53:12] omnipresent that is everywhere he fills
[53:15] all Heavens on Earth
[53:18] that's exactly what he said in John
[53:20] chapter 3 verse 13.
[53:23] he says the son of man who was speaking
[53:25] from the Earth but he was in heaven
[53:29] so he says
[53:31] um here sometime ago on the mount up in
[53:34] California I was looking at the great
[53:36] Observatory we are one of the
[53:38] astronomers had been converted in my
[53:41] meeting
[53:42] and they took me up there
[53:44] and he got a glass that you can see you
[53:46] can see a hundred and twenty million
[53:48] light years
[53:49] or years of light space
[53:52] light troubles I think about 800 8 000
[53:55] miles per second whatever break that
[53:56] down into miles and how many miles would
[53:59] you have over 120 million years how many
[54:03] miles will you have in a minute how many
[54:05] in an hour in a day a year rather what
[54:08] I'm speaking about the universe and in a
[54:11] hundred years or in a million years in a
[54:13] hundred and twenty million years and all
[54:15] beyond that is filled with the solar
[54:17] system
[54:19] our great Jehovah God just blew them off
[54:23] his fingers in creation
[54:30] yeah
[54:31] now I feel religious
[54:33] and you know what I was preaching
[54:36] somewhere that you are in those fingers
[54:39] your names are engraved here so when he
[54:42] was blowing these things into creation
[54:44] you were there
[54:49] you were part of the fingers blowing
[54:51] them into existence
[54:55] and he covers all his fish and sometimes
[54:58] you walk around and act like we we can
[55:00] run his business we act like we can run
[55:04] his business we can't run his business
[55:05] his business he has to come in us and
[55:08] run his own business think for himself
[55:11] talk for himself act for himself achieve
[55:14] for himself plan for himself
[55:18] he says he's so big that he feels all
[55:20] his best and yet it will become so small
[55:23] that he can come to a poor Lost Sinner's
[55:27] heart
[55:30] that is God yes
[55:32] poor lost not sane
[55:35] must holy Reverend doctor so and so
[55:41] oh
[55:43] man no wonder we don't have those titles
[55:45] we don't deserve them
[55:46] he deserves all the titles yes
[55:50] you are just Mrs Jesus not this right
[55:53] reverent doctor this venerable
[55:58] oh
[56:00] blessed be the name of the road
[56:03] he comes he he can become so small that
[56:06] he will come to a poor lost a sinner's
[56:09] heart that's what makes him great
[56:13] did you hear that
[56:16] God is not made great
[56:19] by the greatness that we know he becomes
[56:22] so great when he comes and
[56:25] sits in your head
[56:31] it says I've had a privilege in my life
[56:33] to meet Great Men Kings I've been in
[56:36] four palaces praying for kings and
[56:38] monarchs and potentance and you find
[56:41] great men they are little in their own
[56:43] sight
[56:44] it's man that is nothing
[56:47] little man that thinks himself big that
[56:50] tries to make himself big
[56:53] that's what makes that's what makes God
[56:56] so big he humbles himself to come down
[56:58] to save to heal and makes him go to me
[57:01] now he comes here he says
[57:04] and how true that it is and how true
[57:07] that is with the church today we've had
[57:09] great men across the country like Oral
[57:11] Roberts and great gifts has come in all
[57:14] the Church of course not forgetting
[57:16] William Marion Branham
[57:21] himself
[57:23] but it was greater that
[57:26] because he introduced the greatest
[57:32] and then he says and great gifts have
[57:35] come into the church and the church just
[57:37] sits there and stares
[57:42] the baptism of the Holy Spirit nation
[57:44] and many churches have been filled with
[57:45] their spirit and great Rivals have taken
[57:47] place and the world just sets and stairs
[57:50] in his face
[57:51] when God does anything he expects the
[57:54] people to look at it and believe him
[57:58] not believe in him but believe him
[58:00] present tense
[58:04] I believe in a god
[58:08] that is there a Jehovah
[58:11] I believe in God he's somewhere there in
[58:14] heaven some great supernatural being
[58:21] he wants us to believe him
[58:25] Miracles wander signs that God does is a
[58:28] little something they are shaking before
[58:31] the church to wake up the church that he
[58:34] is soon coming okay now this applies to
[58:38] the disciples they were looking at God
[58:40] doing miracles
[58:44] opening the word
[58:46] teaching them the mystery
[58:48] and they were sitting there and staring
[58:58] yet the purpose why God is doing this
[59:01] the purpose why he is so mightily
[59:04] displayed himself in Malachi foreign
[59:18] and then you come to terms what God has
[59:20] made you to be
[59:22] not sit and stare
[59:25] Satan is there is not going to help you
[59:31] the devil enjoys it when you sit
[59:33] understand
[59:38] so that means whenever God comes down
[59:40] and his place is great power and an
[59:42] omnipotence
[59:43] he does it to show people something he
[59:46] expects people to look at it and believe
[59:48] him
[59:51] believe in him or believe I mean believe
[59:54] in him and be established in the present
[59:57] tense god of the present truth
[1:00:01] amen present truth yes
[1:00:05] so the present truth of that day in the
[1:00:08] disciples age was that God was now with
[1:00:12] them
[1:00:15] but that is not our message today
[1:00:19] God is not just with us
[1:00:25] God is in US
[1:00:31] and the more he comes into in us the
[1:00:35] more we disappear
[1:00:38] so he becomes bigger we become nothing
[1:00:40] we begin to diminish until we disappear
[1:00:45] and the final stand at the final level
[1:00:47] of the church will be that still be God
[1:00:49] in the church Hallelujah
[1:00:53] amen
[1:00:56] not anything less
[1:00:58] and don't settle for anything less
[1:01:01] don't enter into any negotiations with
[1:01:04] the devil for some deal some have baked
[1:01:07] here
[1:01:13] the world sits and stairs they charge
[1:01:15] seats and stairs
[1:01:18] but the bright Ponders
[1:01:21] over these things
[1:01:23] you remember Joseph never became a
[1:01:25] Christian
[1:01:28] it was a very righteous man holy
[1:01:32] but for him every time the message about
[1:01:34] Jesus came the Bible doesn't say he
[1:01:36] pondered
[1:01:39] it's only Mary who pointed
[1:01:42] about the things that were being spoken
[1:01:47] I'll leave that for your pastor
[1:01:56] so he comes he says and and when the
[1:01:58] church puts forth another church it will
[1:02:01] be a Pentecostal church with the signs
[1:02:03] of the acts in their Apostles doing the
[1:02:05] same thing with the same Jesus walking
[1:02:07] the same because he's the same yesterday
[1:02:09] today and forever a Pentecostal Branch
[1:02:12] filled with a holy ghost science and
[1:02:13] wonders of the Resurrection great things
[1:02:16] taking place among them they who know
[1:02:19] their gold in the last days
[1:02:22] they who know they are God in the last
[1:02:24] days shall do Express yes we are at the
[1:02:28] end
[1:02:31] what's the matter with the world I
[1:02:33] imagine closing saying this what's wrong
[1:02:35] with the world
[1:02:36] then he picks up that story of the
[1:02:38] little boy that the mother realized that
[1:02:40] he could not react to whatever it was
[1:02:44] he was playing for her for him
[1:02:46] ring a bell
[1:02:53] show himself
[1:03:00] he could only sit and
[1:03:06] then he brings down and says that's what
[1:03:09] is the matter
[1:03:10] a whole lot like the child today God has
[1:03:13] took the church in his arms and he has a
[1:03:16] shook
[1:03:17] ah and the other robots
[1:03:21] many other gifts and wonders as he has
[1:03:23] shook before the eyes of the people he
[1:03:25] doesn't call he doesn't mention himself
[1:03:27] because he's the one Speaking but we
[1:03:30] know
[1:03:31] through the prophet of the day he shook
[1:03:34] more
[1:03:37] and he says and they claim to be
[1:03:39] religious and they just sit there and
[1:03:41] stare and actually like they don't even
[1:03:43] pay any attention to it
[1:03:47] there is something mentally wrong with
[1:03:49] the church something's wrong
[1:03:51] so what if you have a mental problem as
[1:03:54] a church
[1:03:55] you need
[1:03:57] the mind of Christ
[1:04:02] to restore you are mine the right mind
[1:04:08] maybe you got some dementia
[1:04:12] some amnesia
[1:04:14] you forgotten who you were
[1:04:17] forgotten the purpose
[1:04:19] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:04:22] so he says there's something mentally
[1:04:24] wrong with the church something is wrong
[1:04:26] God displays the gifts and they will
[1:04:28] walk around and say oh Mentos or they
[1:04:31] are just putting on the speaking tongues
[1:04:33] there's nothing to eat see people are
[1:04:35] shouting and praising the Lord with the
[1:04:36] tears run down their cheeks oh she's
[1:04:39] just woke up there's nothing to eat
[1:04:43] to be paying attention to that a
[1:04:47] Christian because it's written in the
[1:04:48] world and they did that at the beginning
[1:04:50] there's something wrong with the church
[1:04:52] something wrong with the people
[1:04:53] something wrong with the nation
[1:04:57] so he comes down and he says that's the
[1:04:59] way the church is getting God has shook
[1:05:01] every promise in the Bible before them
[1:05:02] still we just sit and stare look at that
[1:05:05] look at what show me a sign will you
[1:05:07] they are looking for signs
[1:05:11] the bride is must be looking for God
[1:05:18] not just science
[1:05:20] have God and then the signs will follow
[1:05:23] this sign shall follow them that
[1:05:28] the Believers don't follow signs don't
[1:05:30] look for signs
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:33] besides to follow the Believers
[1:05:40] because they believe they what they are
[1:05:42] full of the word they are full of God
[1:05:44] and God produces the signs
[1:05:46] and that's ones who follow signs follow
[1:05:49] those ones who are holding gold
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:56] that's why one brother was telling me
[1:05:58] Prada tell me the greatest miracle that
[1:06:00] you have seen in your life
[1:06:02] we have had so many I say the greatest
[1:06:04] Miracle is when God led me to this
[1:06:06] message
[1:06:08] [Applause]
[1:06:11] because this message is the word is God
[1:06:16] amen science will fail Miracles will
[1:06:18] fail all these other things will fail
[1:06:20] what people have talked about great
[1:06:22] testimonies great experiences will fail
[1:06:25] but the word will never fail and I will
[1:06:27] have hell I thank God for the word
[1:06:37] so don't even be disappointed even when
[1:06:39] you are sick but if you have the word
[1:06:41] one of these days that you want to take
[1:06:44] care of whatever problem I want to tell
[1:06:47] you that we have come to that type
[1:06:56] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:06:59] I'm not even excited these days so much
[1:07:01] praying for the sick
[1:07:04] it doesn't excite me I've seen recently
[1:07:06] you know before I came they brought some
[1:07:08] girl who was mad and you know given the
[1:07:11] parents a hard time and beaten people
[1:07:13] and screaming and fighting and biting
[1:07:17] and
[1:07:18] and she's the mother of two children and
[1:07:20] they brought her to church I was not at
[1:07:22] the church there was a mismatch in the
[1:07:24] time that I gave them so they brought
[1:07:27] her a little bit later and they had gone
[1:07:29] somewhere so I came back in the evening
[1:07:30] they have been waiting for five hours
[1:07:32] and and I believe us they were doing
[1:07:34] some preparation there was a wedding and
[1:07:37] you know some of them were scared of the
[1:07:39] mighty woman you know so you raise up
[1:07:42] and talk words and people would run away
[1:07:43] and
[1:07:45] so I came and
[1:07:49] you know
[1:07:51] I I knew God was going to deliver her
[1:07:56] but I said God I'm tired of just praying
[1:07:59] for the people to be healed to believe
[1:08:01] it
[1:08:03] so what so what that they are delivered
[1:08:06] so what are they are here so many have
[1:08:09] been healed and they have gone back in
[1:08:11] the world
[1:08:12] serving the devil
[1:08:15] so that sign blinds them
[1:08:18] they think God is just too good to set
[1:08:20] them freeze all and they go and leave he
[1:08:22] said you know like you know that kind of
[1:08:25] life
[1:08:31] I said Lord before I pray for this human
[1:08:35] I I want to know
[1:08:38] whether she's going to Value salvation
[1:08:42] and and God Gave Me A Sign immediately
[1:08:45] and I thank God
[1:08:49] so I just took a hold of her and then I
[1:08:52] was asking ridiculous why didn't you
[1:08:53] pray for yourself Pastor that running
[1:08:54] Sunday I said no it's also handled it by
[1:08:57] you
[1:08:58] you're believers
[1:09:04] this is what I'm talking about not
[1:09:06] knowing what we have
[1:09:09] so I just got a hold of her and went to
[1:09:11] the office with her mother and as I
[1:09:13] kneel down
[1:09:15] she just kneel down and she knelt down
[1:09:17] and then I prayed for her
[1:09:19] I said God
[1:09:21] even when she doesn't understand I want
[1:09:25] her back in her right mind
[1:09:27] and I want to talk to her about
[1:09:29] salvation now
[1:09:34] I'm fed up with these people who just
[1:09:36] come and brought the power brought the
[1:09:38] power and go and live for the devil I'm
[1:09:40] not excited because they are healed
[1:09:44] you rather die sick and go to heaven
[1:09:46] than leave health and go to hell
[1:09:55] so I prayed for her in a moment like
[1:09:57] just the split of time she was delivered
[1:10:00] and she was saying where am I and she
[1:10:01] was laughing and then I said now calm
[1:10:04] down
[1:10:07] you know
[1:10:09] that you have been transported over 300
[1:10:12] kilometers to be brought here
[1:10:15] because all the preachers in the Kampala
[1:10:17] could not cast out his devil
[1:10:20] they took you to a number of churches
[1:10:22] and they have brought you here oh yeah
[1:10:25] where am I said you were here in Pursuit
[1:10:28] you are not in the company
[1:10:33] so I said now
[1:10:36] do you know why those preachers could
[1:10:38] not cast out those demons
[1:10:42] and then I I remember that statement the
[1:10:45] prophet says God is in times himself
[1:10:48] from the whole world empowering himself
[1:10:50] into his bride
[1:10:52] [Music]
[1:10:54] denominations are finished
[1:10:58] then what they are doing they just
[1:11:00] mascara they even training people to act
[1:11:02] like they were sick and they were healed
[1:11:04] they are doing things in tricks just to
[1:11:06] deceive the people they are dying they
[1:11:09] are finished
[1:11:11] true Revival is now around the world
[1:11:14] because the word is going to form itself
[1:11:17] into the fullness of God
[1:11:19] and God will take care of every problem
[1:11:21] and I want to promise you you are not
[1:11:23] going to be sick when we go home no
[1:11:27] that tabernoko this body
[1:11:30] a body has thou given me I didn't come
[1:11:34] looking for sacrifice for this for that
[1:11:37] but a body has thou prepared for me
[1:11:40] and you are that body
[1:11:44] so I talked to this girl about Jesus and
[1:11:46] she melted down with tears say I accept
[1:11:48] the little Pastor I'm even ready for
[1:11:51] baptism
[1:11:52] I said Thank You Lord
[1:11:56] I'm not excited just because people are
[1:11:58] healed
[1:12:00] I'm not even excited the lemon walk I
[1:12:04] had I thank God the elderly man I talked
[1:12:07] about I prayed before has been out of
[1:12:09] the church 15 years
[1:12:11] he just came back in his February to
[1:12:13] repent
[1:12:21] so brother sister thank God yes if you
[1:12:24] catch the revelation of peace
[1:12:27] you have got the greatest blessing you
[1:12:30] are the in the most comfortable position
[1:12:33] when you receive this word and when you
[1:12:35] cherish it when you value it
[1:12:38] when it becomes your life because it
[1:12:40] will become your power Your Glory your
[1:12:42] future your everything yeah
[1:12:44] without this you are not lost completely
[1:12:47] nothing amen but we found God he came
[1:12:50] our way we thank God we know where we
[1:12:53] are standing
[1:12:55] we are not going to sit there and stare
[1:12:59] don't sit and stare
[1:13:02] like the disciples will say we believe
[1:13:04] in God
[1:13:06] where God has sent a prophet
[1:13:10] and they were looking at Jesus they
[1:13:12] didn't know who
[1:13:14] well God has set us a great man
[1:13:19] God has sent us a great man a great
[1:13:22] prophet May Messiah is here who is the
[1:13:25] messiah
[1:13:28] yes
[1:13:31] and what is the message of Malachi for
[1:13:36] whom did he introduce
[1:13:42] are you ready to live there at our
[1:13:45] office
[1:13:47] of God With Us
[1:13:49] God is with us in our church
[1:13:53] our pastor is a good preacher
[1:13:57] we hear good testimonies in the church
[1:14:03] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:14:06] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[1:14:10] not others testimony there you are you
[1:14:14] are testimony
[1:14:16] you are testimony and what is your
[1:14:18] testimony the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:14:21] is the spirit of Prophecy so your
[1:14:23] testimony is that you are dead and Jesus
[1:14:26] Lives in You
[1:14:27] [Applause]
[1:14:30] not your testimony as a human being
[1:14:37] you are dead he lives so that's when you
[1:14:40] qualify to prophesy again the testimony
[1:14:43] of Jesus Christ is the spirit of
[1:14:45] Prophecy
[1:14:49] hmm
[1:14:51] so he says
[1:14:58] and after Jesus had so proven his
[1:15:01] Messianic sign that was that Messiah yet
[1:15:05] in the first of all that they saying
[1:15:07] show us the sign
[1:15:11] when you say Show Me A Sign you are an
[1:15:14] unbeliever
[1:15:18] because actually you are supposed to
[1:15:20] become the sign because you should be
[1:15:22] broke before you show signs
[1:15:25] you are not supposed to see signs but
[1:15:28] you are supposed to show signs
[1:15:30] and before you show signs you are
[1:15:33] supposed to be the sign
[1:15:34] the super signed what is this person God
[1:15:38] in a man
[1:15:43] so struggle to become this person
[1:15:46] and then you will become the sign to
[1:15:49] those who want signs but for you you
[1:15:51] want this person manifested and that's
[1:15:55] where your comfort is only is
[1:16:00] not just because your feet you can jump
[1:16:02] up and make push push press-ups
[1:16:06] you have good biceps and you can do this
[1:16:09] you can lift this
[1:16:12] business is running very well
[1:16:15] well enough time before the people I can
[1:16:17] attitude what is very well I'm a group
[1:16:19] orator blah blah
[1:16:22] notice that
[1:16:24] the sign is not even holding a message
[1:16:26] book
[1:16:27] it's not even holy in the Bible
[1:16:32] the sign is where the Bible becomes life
[1:16:34] in you
[1:16:36] when you become the message manifested
[1:16:39] [Applause]
[1:16:41] and that's what the devil doesn't want
[1:16:43] us to come to
[1:16:45] praise God there's gonna be a people
[1:16:47] come to that
[1:16:48] and I want to be one of them
[1:16:54] Hallelujah
[1:16:56] you believe in God
[1:16:58] you believe in Jesus who was with us
[1:17:00] believe in our in Jesus who is in US
[1:17:07] you believe in praying being prayed for
[1:17:10] believe also in praying

[1:17:33] pray for you in the morning
[1:17:36] we'll pray for you I was preaching
[1:17:38] somewhere I think when I was there
[1:17:40] something I was talking about how we
[1:17:42] want everything to be done for us
[1:17:46] the pastor has to study the message for
[1:17:48] us study the Bible for us and for you
[1:17:50] you don't study the message you don't
[1:17:51] study the Bible the pastor has to do
[1:17:53] everything and every single question
[1:17:54] Pastor can you answer me this I have
[1:17:56] this question what about this what about
[1:17:58] 70 Church ages what did the prophet say

[1:18:15] Lord be to God
[1:18:17] I don't know why you love this prayer
[1:18:19] it's not a good brother

[1:18:28] he's not a very good brother but he
[1:18:31] loves you

[1:18:57] take it where there is water take it
[1:18:59] where they can help it
[1:19:02] well it can be Avengers where it can
[1:19:04] gain strength
[1:19:06] okay that's why you find people you know
[1:19:09] they are working there they are there in
[1:19:12] the offices they do three jobs a day and
[1:19:14] run here and then they can't come to
[1:19:16] church
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:19] and then they come to ask the question
[1:19:21] which was answered last Wednesday night
[1:19:25] who is going to do a religion for you
[1:19:28] who is going to study the Bible for you
[1:19:31] you are asking a silly question
[1:19:34] uh-huh
[1:19:35] and you are a very mature person how do
[1:19:38] you tell me hey what about this this
[1:19:41] Quest the scripture that says women if
[1:19:42] you don't cut hair should that be a
[1:19:45] question you ask me
[1:19:48] [Laughter]
[1:19:53] hey
[1:20:00] God expects you not to sit and
[1:20:10] sounds good
[1:20:16] makes some sense
[1:20:23] God expects you to be active
[1:20:27] that's why he says you already got the
[1:20:29] faith when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:20:32] but now you know you don't know how to
[1:20:34] operate
[1:20:36] to act upon that
[1:20:39] who is going to act upon it for you
[1:20:42] who is going to go Interruption on your
[1:20:44] behalf
[1:20:47] who is going to be changed on your
[1:20:49] behalf who is going to be changed for
[1:20:51] you
[1:20:53] you need it to go there yourself
[1:20:58] yeah
[1:21:00] and that's why you people should begin
[1:21:01] to speak to God when you speak to God
[1:21:03] and you must you perfect in prayer then
[1:21:06] you are no longer going to pray you are
[1:21:08] going to begin to speak
[1:21:10] that's the final standard we are not
[1:21:13] going to pray
[1:21:15] we are going to speak but before we come
[1:21:17] to that level of just speaking the word
[1:21:20] you shall say to this mountain amen
[1:21:24] not pray
[1:21:29] thank you
[1:21:30] into existence he didn't pray
[1:21:34] it was the stage of Say Amen
[1:21:39] but before he could say how many times
[1:21:41] did the brother Branham first go to the
[1:21:44] woods and pray and wait upon the Lord
[1:21:47] pray and fasten for Faith meals
[1:21:51] it didn't come just just that easy
[1:21:56] seat and stare
[1:22:00] let me bring this also here
[1:22:03] maybe you put on your listening issues
[1:22:10] when you come to judge someone opens the
[1:22:13] prayer for you pray good
[1:22:16] praise for you when they are going to
[1:22:17] preach the word good they pray for
[1:22:19] prayer requests good the preacher praise
[1:22:21] and preaches
[1:22:23] good after preaching he prays good when
[1:22:26] do you pray
[1:22:29] and this is the House of Prayer
[1:22:34] and then you go back home and you give
[1:22:36] the past a call Pastor pray for me I'm
[1:22:38] having a headache I have a problem this
[1:22:39] this problem has come this problem has
[1:22:41] come
[1:22:43] can't you pray
[1:22:47] does God have grandchildren
[1:22:50] does God have babies
[1:22:53] all of us are children isn't it
[1:22:55] and he gives ear to all of us
[1:22:58] so what is happening Satan is there
[1:23:06] that's not very good preaching
[1:23:13] but there is a problem there is a
[1:23:15] complacency there is a weakness there is
[1:23:17] a resignation resigning into threat
[1:23:20] sitting there and giving yourself over
[1:23:22] to
[1:23:23] circumstances
[1:23:26] God knows he knows you are capable of
[1:23:30] doing something
[1:23:36] should be ringing in your heart now
[1:23:38] telling you that it's about to go home
[1:23:41] it's about time we are going home
[1:23:46] it is time to graduate from prayer to
[1:23:50] the spoken one
[1:23:54] unless you qualify unless you pass the
[1:23:57] examination
[1:23:59] pass this fast
[1:24:01] [Applause]
[1:24:04] so if you can't even pray how will you
[1:24:07] speak
[1:24:12] and yet you are supposed to come to that
[1:24:16] because in the beginning what's the word
[1:24:18] what was the word let there be
[1:24:22] [Music]
[1:24:24] the logos wow so the logos is getting
[1:24:27] formed in you so how are you going to
[1:24:29] come to that to say Let There Be
[1:24:33] when you can't even pray why did Jesus
[1:24:36] pray
[1:24:43] ER although he was a son
[1:24:46] yet land he obedience by the things he
[1:24:49] suffered and he was setting an example
[1:24:52] for you otherwise how could God pray go
[1:24:56] to the mountain and pray and wait upon
[1:24:58] God God waiting upon God
[1:25:02] yay
[1:25:04] God waiting upon you
[1:25:06] God is praying to who
[1:25:11] and then from there you come and say
[1:25:14] no man should eat on you anymore
[1:25:17] no fruit
[1:25:18] and a trip Drive
[1:25:21] he didn't mean to pray
[1:25:27] because he has qualified he has finished
[1:25:29] that
[1:25:30] he has passed he has graduated
[1:25:36] do you know that's the reason the devil
[1:25:38] fights prayer
[1:25:40] oh
[1:25:43] you can say Amen to the word you can
[1:25:45] maybe study the Bible but you go to
[1:25:47] prayer
[1:25:49] oh no no no no no no where are those
[1:25:52] family holders Brothers
[1:25:55] who prays in your home who prays for
[1:25:57] your children who prays for your wife
[1:25:58] who prays for your husband who prays for
[1:26:01] you
[1:26:03] he is there that our Heavenly atmosphere
[1:26:06] in your home
[1:26:07] because how are you going to rule out
[1:26:10] that Rapture will take place when you're
[1:26:11] in your house right
[1:26:14] and yet there must be that Heavenly
[1:26:16] atmosphere because God is there
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:27] let's work out wake up out of this
[1:26:30] slippery Slumber this complacency this
[1:26:32] looks I was breaking somewhere and I was
[1:26:36] talking about
[1:26:37] how that God spews you out of his nose
[1:26:40] because you are looking otherwise you
[1:26:41] are supposed to be permanently in the
[1:26:43] mouth of God
[1:26:46] a fire a believer
[1:26:51] you remain in the mouth of God but when
[1:26:54] you are lukewarm we quickly I I can't I
[1:26:58] can't I can't
[1:26:59] right yeah
[1:27:04] and when God spills you out you lose the
[1:27:08] anointing to do because you are boss the
[1:27:10] man in the mouth you are both in the
[1:27:11] hand and the handful feels the mouth
[1:27:13] speaks God speaks with the mouth full of
[1:27:15] feelings with their hand so how is the
[1:27:17] hand going fulfill when the connection
[1:27:19] to the intelligence they are not
[1:27:21] controls the hand to fulfill it you have
[1:27:24] lost it
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:26] spewed out you are confused you don't
[1:27:29] know where your bearing is
[1:27:35] um
[1:27:35] [Music]
[1:27:38] praise God lord the middle God
[1:27:41] so time to graduate
[1:27:45] from a church member from a good
[1:27:48] believer
[1:27:49] from a guru Christian to God in flesh
[1:27:53] time to graduate from a prayer life to
[1:27:57] the spoken word but before you come to
[1:27:59] the spoken word you are not just going
[1:28:01] to jump the queue or jump there it is
[1:28:04] going to be a graduation a process
[1:28:11] and that's why the difference making us
[1:28:12] so weak
[1:28:14] you can't even pray five minutes
[1:28:17] but you can be on the phone for hours
[1:28:20] you can listen the news for hours you
[1:28:23] can be on social media for hours you you
[1:28:26] have friends here friends here and Tick
[1:28:28] Tock and what's up and listen to
[1:28:30] Facebook and so these are that and all
[1:28:33] the time the message you think and
[1:28:34] you're looking thing and you're looking
[1:28:35] thing what about the heaven thing
[1:28:42] do you have your connection with God
[1:28:47] is that God reforming in you until you
[1:28:50] feel him so real
[1:28:52] and is that the relationship between you
[1:28:54] you know you know when you're just
[1:28:56] getting married and that intimate
[1:28:58] closeness and friendship and
[1:29:00] relationship and warmth of love that hot
[1:29:03] love is that there in your life between
[1:29:06] you and him because the bridegroom has
[1:29:08] come in you and is residing in you and
[1:29:10] you are the bride
[1:29:16] um
[1:29:18] because it is that love that will take
[1:29:21] you home
[1:29:22] without perfect love you will not enter
[1:29:25] there
[1:29:27] now who's love not yours because you
[1:29:30] don't have a perfect love it is his it
[1:29:33] is him
[1:29:34] [Applause]
[1:29:36] and you have to begin to realize it to
[1:29:38] feel it to experience it
[1:29:41] until you can even love your enemies
[1:29:46] [Music]
[1:29:48] when you no longer even look at them as
[1:29:50] anything dangerous because they actually
[1:29:52] are promoters we thank God for our
[1:29:54] enemies
[1:29:58] oh
[1:30:02] my brother Abraham today you are
[1:30:03] preaching something how how can you say
[1:30:06] thank God for my enemies thank God for
[1:30:08] you are
[1:30:10] do you know why he has not taken away
[1:30:12] the devil yet
[1:30:15] we should thank God for the devil
[1:30:19] [Laughter]
[1:30:23] because without the devil you wouldn't
[1:30:25] be saved you wouldn't be here you don't
[1:30:28] even have that power
[1:30:31] he has given you that power because of
[1:30:33] the devil
[1:30:35] you know if you want to see the the
[1:30:36] weapons of America you don't find them
[1:30:38] in Lima
[1:30:40] you find them we are the enemies
[1:30:46] they bring them here for what
[1:30:50] now you see all the weapons of God is
[1:30:52] Warfare in his Armory I hear because the
[1:30:55] enemy is here
[1:31:00] do you know why the Bible says you you
[1:31:02] you you you you you know he he'll
[1:31:06] prepare a table for you before you are
[1:31:08] enemies
[1:31:10] and he wants you to enjoy the food when
[1:31:13] the enemy is looking out
[1:31:16] laughs
[1:31:18] he will not take them away he'll keep on
[1:31:21] it he'll protect them he'll heal them
[1:31:24] he wants them to be elephant
[1:31:27] his belief
[1:31:33] because they are you are promoters
[1:31:37] when you are sick they are the ones who
[1:31:38] challenge God on your behalf let's see
[1:31:41] he's good he says he believes this time
[1:31:44] see he's going to die and then he's
[1:31:46] going to say okay
[1:31:48] so there you are promoters
[1:31:51] amen
[1:31:54] blessed be the name of that yes
[1:31:57] do you know why Joshua when he made that
[1:31:59] angel he said are you for us or for our
[1:32:01] enemies then you say nay
[1:32:05] neither
[1:32:09] and that was God himself
[1:32:12] so yeah I'm even for your enemies Joshua
[1:32:16] I have to give them Breath of Life
[1:32:18] they have to be there
[1:32:20] so that you become a conqueror how can
[1:32:22] you conquer when there is no enemy
[1:32:24] how can you defeat the enemy when
[1:32:26] there's an enemy no enemy
[1:32:29] how can you be an overcomer qualified to
[1:32:32] sit with me in my throne
[1:32:34] when there's nothing to overcome
[1:32:38] so he makes sure you're always
[1:32:39] surrounded with enemies
[1:32:41] and that is this good plan and you
[1:32:44] wonder why they hate you they always
[1:32:45] there
[1:32:52] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:32:54] okay
[1:32:56] so it's about time
[1:32:58] that they we the True Believers in the
[1:33:00] end time recognize
[1:33:03] recognized and started acting on the
[1:33:05] sign that God has given us the sign that
[1:33:07] proves that God is dispensation office
[1:33:10] has changed this is the reality that we
[1:33:12] must Embrace if we are to amount
[1:33:14] anything and he comes here in the
[1:33:16] message I think I will just finish
[1:33:18] quickly today he says all these things
[1:33:20] that we could speak of for hours
[1:33:23] the expressions of God to Sherman race
[1:33:26] all these have their part they play it
[1:33:29] well every flower every tree every
[1:33:32] Sunrise every sun is it everything plays
[1:33:34] it it's part well but all of those
[1:33:36] expressions of God making known to us
[1:33:38] and giving us an example and that he was
[1:33:42] going to make a great expression someday
[1:33:44] an internal expression
[1:33:46] that he sent us his expressed image in
[1:33:49] the form of his son God sent his son in
[1:33:52] the express image of himself
[1:33:56] what he thought of us
[1:34:00] so we when you see the image of Christ
[1:34:04] that's what he thought of you
[1:34:08] he changed his cast he became man he
[1:34:12] become one of us
[1:34:15] from God the internal father from The
[1:34:17] Great Creator who before there was a war
[1:34:19] revealed all the time space there was
[1:34:22] not even a meter or a light meter
[1:34:24] neither was there any atom or a molecule
[1:34:28] he was still God and He will always be
[1:34:30] God
[1:34:31] and then he comes down and says um
[1:34:35] let me leave this he says and then he
[1:34:38] went and then he was so mindful enough
[1:34:40] to make an expression to us knowing that
[1:34:43] he's so great yet he he come down in the
[1:34:46] form of his Humanity to express what he
[1:34:49] was
[1:34:50] he become a man of son acquainted with
[1:34:54] grief lived a a human life he had no
[1:34:58] place to lay his head he was expressing
[1:35:00] what if what God was
[1:35:06] in other words that is the final image
[1:35:09] of God
[1:35:20] the prophet talks about the Corporal
[1:35:21] image
[1:35:22] of Jesus they are seated
[1:35:25] and you are going to have a body changed
[1:35:30] and who is God who is Jesus
[1:35:33] God isn't it
[1:35:39] I was one time asking the church I said
[1:35:41] he says he had overcome as well I grant
[1:35:44] that he sits with me even as I overcame
[1:35:46] and I've sat with my father in my Throne
[1:35:47] so were they sharing the throne
[1:35:52] [Music]
[1:35:53] huh
[1:35:58] a big white throne and here the father
[1:36:01] sits on the sunny seats
[1:36:04] and then he says when you overcome
[1:36:06] you're also be granted the opportunity
[1:36:08] to come and see it with me
[1:36:10] in my throat like I overcame and I'm sat
[1:36:14] with my father so are we gonna be three
[1:36:17] no and it is there
[1:36:24] the Bible says
[1:36:28] God was the head of the Sun
[1:36:32] Christ is the head of the church and God
[1:36:35] was the head of Christ
[1:36:37] as Christ is the head of the church now
[1:36:40] when Christ has sat
[1:36:44] he was the body
[1:36:46] and the father was dead
[1:36:50] and when you sit you are the body and
[1:36:54] the Christ is the head
[1:36:58] one from
[1:37:00] I saw one yes yes sat on the throne amen
[1:37:07] glory to God
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:13] one body
[1:37:15] so now that is God's final expression of
[1:37:18] what he wants to be in a human body
[1:37:22] looking body
[1:37:25] look at how God treasured you
[1:37:28] not look like an angel
[1:37:33] but look like you
[1:37:35] the final
[1:37:37] yet he created you in His image but not
[1:37:40] the physical
[1:37:42] he created you in His image in the
[1:37:45] spiritual
[1:37:47] but now he creates himself in your image
[1:37:50] in the physical
[1:37:52] Hallelujah
[1:37:59] amen oh that you can really be husband
[1:38:02] and wife yeah
[1:38:04] same material
[1:38:07] born of my bones Flesh of My Flesh
[1:38:11] look at that and then he chose of all
[1:38:14] the trillions and trillions of stars and
[1:38:17] planets he chose here on Earth
[1:38:21] this is where his blood it dropped amen
[1:38:24] and this is the only star that he
[1:38:26] redeemed
[1:38:28] yes and
[1:38:30] all other stars will collapse and the
[1:38:33] Bible says all the stars were collapsing
[1:38:35] from the firmament flowing
[1:38:38] but this one will not collapse
[1:38:42] oh
[1:38:45] think about how he thought about you
[1:38:49] the final expression of his appearance
[1:38:53] like a man
[1:38:58] but before he becomes a man which he was
[1:39:01] he had to purchase you being restored
[1:39:04] back to his image
[1:39:08] personal
[1:39:09] Hospital
[1:39:10] right
[1:39:11] hmm
[1:39:13] I wish I was brother Chad come and take
[1:39:15] over brother and bring this out clearly
[1:39:18] Hallelujah
[1:39:25] he was expressing what what God was
[1:39:30] you see
[1:39:31] he laid a plan down for us all
[1:39:35] that where we could too could look at
[1:39:38] this small expression and see God
[1:39:41] this is small expression of your smaller
[1:39:44] tiny short body
[1:39:46] that may not be very very beautiful yes
[1:39:49] maybe you are not even handy sir
[1:39:52] don't care about hand something so leg
[1:39:55] summoning socialness
[1:39:57] whether your head is not doesn't matter
[1:40:02] whether you are just 50 pounds or 100 or
[1:40:05] 200 no problem
[1:40:08] he makes sure he fits
[1:40:10] and that's why when he he brought the
[1:40:13] final mystery of our inheritance the
[1:40:16] title did the book
[1:40:18] he brought it in a form of a little
[1:40:21] compressed smaller book and a little
[1:40:23] book in the Angel's hand he said go and
[1:40:25] take it and eat it so it is eatable by
[1:40:30] you
[1:40:30] [Applause]
[1:40:33] it disappears in you
[1:40:36] Final Destination the devil will never
[1:40:39] get a hold of it again
[1:40:41] it's now in you swallowed amen
[1:40:45] hahaha
[1:40:47] praise God Amen
[1:40:56] you could look at this small expression
[1:40:58] and see God
[1:41:03] and then we could look up and see God's
[1:41:06] Great Expression
[1:41:07] and have the Assurance so we look at how
[1:41:10] we can condescend and become too little
[1:41:12] and yet we see him as a very great
[1:41:15] awesome God
[1:41:18] and we have assurance and you walk with
[1:41:21] your shoulders High
[1:41:22] and you have your face on my first who
[1:41:25] is gonna scare you certainly whom do you
[1:41:27] think you are
[1:41:29] oh yeah
[1:41:33] if I I was in my father when we chased
[1:41:36] you from heaven I'm going to defeat you
[1:41:38] here
[1:41:39] I am not an amateur in this I am in my
[1:41:43] mind but not in his mind that he has now
[1:41:45] put in me I know better now I know where
[1:41:48] I came from where I'm standing and what
[1:41:51] I'm holding on and when we come to that
[1:41:53] the devil begins to tremble now
[1:41:55] who
[1:42:01] final expression
[1:42:04] God in a man
[1:42:06] final standard
[1:42:08] against the devil
[1:42:15] Hallelujah
[1:42:17] says God it was a paradox how God could
[1:42:20] become man and die
[1:42:24] that was a paradox how are the great God
[1:42:27] that filled always personally all
[1:42:29] eternity could come down and be man in
[1:42:31] order to die to serve human
[1:42:32] his own creation how God became one of
[1:42:35] his own Creations to save cause he
[1:42:38] created his own body he created his own
[1:42:40] body yes
[1:42:41] Jehovah the father dwelt in fullness in
[1:42:45] Jesus Christ his son Jesus was the body
[1:42:47] of God God was represented in the
[1:42:49] Tabernacle the Flesh of Jesus Christ and
[1:42:51] how that that one that Fearless person
[1:42:54] Lord in that eternity become one man
[1:42:56] amen become one man
[1:42:59] you see what I mean
[1:43:04] I'm finishing friends
[1:43:10] he comes here
[1:43:11] he says now I think he's in the message
[1:43:18] the world became flesh in the early trip
[1:43:21] he says
[1:43:26] now if that same spirit that say it
[1:43:31] let there be light
[1:43:34] and there was light
[1:43:37] and that said let there be trees and
[1:43:40] there was trees
[1:43:41] and if that same mind that was in Christ

[1:44:25] I mean the creation of God Jesus
[1:44:28] it's the beginning of the creation it's
[1:44:30] now the com the completion of the
[1:44:32] creation the Omega again
[1:44:35] [Music]

[1:44:43] cancer and it will be gone let the blind
[1:44:46] eyes be open and they will be so
[1:44:48] see it is your thought
[1:44:54] but wait a minute he said have faith in

[1:46:06] but if it becomes a real revelation of
[1:46:10] God that you see it before it happened
[1:46:12] and express it in word form now the real
[1:46:16] revelation of God where we are going now

[1:50:34] and this is my focus yes
[1:50:37] no I'm not just going to be happy
[1:50:39] praying for the people I don't care
[1:50:41] whether I'm praying for how many and
[1:50:43] they are getting healed that is not
[1:50:45] graduation that is not promotion that is
[1:50:47] retardation I want to come to a point
[1:50:49] where people will be delivered as we
[1:50:52] preach the word people are just walking
[1:50:54] up throwing away their crutches because
[1:50:57] it is there
[1:51:00] they are speaking it it's there they are
[1:51:04] they are having God the reality is here
[1:51:08] [Music]

[1:51:24] time is going to come when you all
[1:51:26] become Gods who will pray for God
[1:51:31] God he doesn't need prayers now
[1:51:34] God speaks the word
[1:51:37] well this is a new doctor no this is
[1:51:39] what we are eating this is the message
[1:51:41] now that's the reality this message
[1:51:43] brings us to
[1:51:46] and whether the devil wants or not we
[1:51:48] are gonna get there
[1:51:49] [Applause]
[1:51:56] Glory oh God maybe your pastor should
[1:51:59] just help you put yourself right and
[1:52:00] then everything begins to work
[1:52:03] here are the Dynamics you just put the
[1:52:05] car had some problem maybe the wire was
[1:52:07] cut here then we put it right and then
[1:52:09] he put the key and start the cargo
[1:52:13] I don't have to drive the car for you
[1:52:17] oh let's put it right
[1:52:22] glory to God
[1:52:25] and he says and they are the sons of God
[1:52:27] led by the spirit of God and when the
[1:52:29] human element goes out
[1:52:33] when the human element goes out there's
[1:52:35] human feeding the human reasoning
[1:52:37] opinion
[1:52:39] feelings
[1:52:42] the way I see it
[1:52:45] I felt this I felt it is
[1:52:54] [Applause]
[1:52:55] the American element
[1:52:57] the intellectual element
[1:53:01] goes out
[1:53:04] replaced by this financial element
[1:53:08] [Applause]
[1:53:13] so when the human element goes out and
[1:53:15] the spirit of God fills the fat currency
[1:53:17] that can't see I'm reading for you
[1:53:20] the prophet the human element goes out
[1:53:23] and then the spirit of God fills that
[1:53:26] vacuum so in other words creative
[1:53:28] workers God what God doesn't want to
[1:53:30] come and struggle to enter
[1:53:35] God is not a get Crusher he's not a
[1:53:38] house breaker
[1:53:40] he's a gentleman
[1:53:42] he waits at the door
[1:53:46] not only should there be a vacancy in
[1:53:48] your heart but there should be an
[1:53:50] invitation
[1:53:52] coming Lord
[1:53:55] come and have your way take overload
[1:53:58] I'm tired with this useless stupid head
[1:54:01] of mind making rounds of foolishness
[1:54:04] reasoning this arguing this knowing this
[1:54:06] knowing nothing tomorrow it will be a
[1:54:08] bunch of rotten
[1:54:15] I want you
[1:54:17] so that even when I was to sleep
[1:54:19] I'll have the earnest of Resurrection I
[1:54:22] will have the assure so anyway I see
[1:54:24] blessed the assurance
[1:54:28] Jesus Is Mine I have a fortress yes
[1:54:34] oh what a forward test of Glory divine
[1:54:38] test it here
[1:54:43] yes
[1:54:47] so the spirit of God feels that if I can
[1:54:49] say where you empathize yourself amen
[1:54:52] then we'll be then when
[1:54:55] the church in its power of the
[1:54:57] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:59] walks in his steps
[1:55:01] in his power in his thoughts in his
[1:55:05] being in his moving you see what I mean
[1:55:08] congregation says amen I don't know
[1:55:11] about BCF
[1:55:14] amen
[1:55:17] then your thoughts become what and ones
[1:55:21] become material
[1:55:26] what is become material that's when the
[1:55:28] church is in its power
[1:55:32] listen concludes I believe it's on its
[1:55:37] Road
[1:55:38] that's what I'm believing into it's
[1:55:40] coming I can feel it I can smell it
[1:55:44] we are going somewhere
[1:55:46] no wonder you've been yearning for
[1:55:47] something isn't it you feel like you
[1:55:49] have not made it you feel like something
[1:55:51] is there you want to get somewhere yeah
[1:55:55] and you're always telling the devil
[1:55:57] there's something I must get to
[1:55:59] now we begin to see it
[1:56:01] is
[1:56:03] that when the church will be so wrapped
[1:56:06] in Christ
[1:56:07] so wrapped in Christ
[1:56:11] the Holy Spirit
[1:56:13] mankind is so away from theirselves
[1:56:17] hey
[1:56:19] so away from them they are slaves
[1:56:23] that they don't see themselves
[1:56:29] you'd only see yourself
[1:56:31] yes that's the word
[1:56:34] so away from yourself that you don't see
[1:56:36] yourself
[1:56:37] you see God you see Christ you see the
[1:56:39] word
[1:56:42] and what you see speaks you you hear it
[1:56:44] you believe it you are not
[1:56:49] hmm
[1:56:51] they don't have no and then but to serve
[1:56:53] God and their thoughts and then move on
[1:56:55] they refuse the things of the world they
[1:56:58] just move in the spirit living the
[1:56:59] spirit move in the spirit walk in the
[1:57:01] spirit to fulfill the love Christ then
[1:57:03] the love of Christ in the human heart
[1:57:04] moving the holy ghost that great
[1:57:07] wonderful church will come we'll go
[1:57:08] forth with power and deity because deity
[1:57:11] will be revealed in human beings
[1:57:13] by the Holy Spirit bringing it to pass
[1:57:16] bringing it to pass the thought of their
[1:57:19] mind
[1:57:24] that is the office
[1:57:29] you're believing
[1:57:32] Christ
[1:57:33] who is Grace
[1:57:36] you believe in Jesus has said he saved
[1:57:39] you that is what is done
[1:57:41] now come here
[1:57:46] what is the final office God in him
[1:57:52] so when you believe God in you you will
[1:57:54] be so away from yourself flow away from
[1:57:57] your mind because you will be dead to
[1:57:59] not even be your mind think about that
[1:58:02] when it is not even in your mind anymore
[1:58:05] even your opinions your feelings nothing
[1:58:07] is working that's it's not it's there
[1:58:10] but it's ineffective paralyzed
[1:58:14] you see when you have a hand which you
[1:58:16] cannot do anything
[1:58:21] overtaken overwhelmed
[1:58:25] subdued amen
[1:58:32] then he comes down on in the message
[1:58:33] conference with God he says what are we
[1:58:37] his mouthpiece
[1:58:40] we submit ourselves to him and our words
[1:58:43] are not our words
[1:58:46] take no thought what you shall say cause
[1:58:48] it's not you that speaks it's the father
[1:58:50] that dwells in you he speaks
[1:58:57] so that same father
[1:59:01] that the disciples say show us your
[1:59:04] father
[1:59:04] now the prophet is telling ask the daddy
[1:59:07] father now dwells in you
[1:59:11] man you don't have to say oh show me the
[1:59:13] father father show me show me
[1:59:17] show you what
[1:59:21] right what do you want him to show you
[1:59:31] God is purpose we find it here in
[1:59:33] sending the Holy Spirit was one purpose
[1:59:36] that God himself might dwell in his
[1:59:38] church and continue his plan through the
[1:59:41] church continue his plans
[1:59:44] through the church that is the purpose
[1:59:47] that God was in Christ continuing his
[1:59:50] plans through Christ out of Christ into
[1:59:53] the church continuing his work through
[1:59:55] the church so he came out of Christ eh
[2:00:02] since the prophet is speaking not
[2:00:06] let me repeat that that God was in
[2:00:09] Christ continue his plan through Christ
[2:00:11] out of Christ into the church
[2:00:18] Christ is the one now in the church
[2:00:22] so that
[2:00:23] of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[2:00:28] empty praise God
[2:00:34] oh where is he he's in a church he's in
[2:00:38] you
[2:00:41] and you are looking for him at an empty
[2:00:43] office
[2:00:46] dispensational change
[2:00:49] you believe in Christ believe also in in
[2:00:53] this world
[2:00:55] this is the final stage
[2:00:58] this is where he is he's here
[2:01:02] not here here
[2:01:05] so when the devil troubles it doesn't
[2:01:07] trouble your mind it troubles your heart
[2:01:09] when he is no longer there he's not yet
[2:01:12] there you will get troubled then you are
[2:01:14] looking there you are looking for a
[2:01:16] solution from a wrong resource right
[2:01:21] right no wonder
[2:01:24] when Titus the Roman general came and
[2:01:26] the Jews gathered in the temple they
[2:01:28] thought God was going to protect them
[2:01:29] because they are in the temple they
[2:01:32] didn't know that the dispensation of God
[2:01:34] protecting a temple
[2:01:37] had gone that's why the veil of the
[2:01:40] temple was rent
[2:01:43] and them high priests knew these things
[2:01:46] not a bogus thing
[2:01:48] from the day we crucified that man this
[2:01:51] is a burger thing because we saw how
[2:01:53] they Veil that separated the holy of
[2:01:56] holies from the common view
[2:02:00] so they could whisper to one another we
[2:02:03] are here but we know we are nothing
[2:02:05] right yeah
[2:02:06] bogus
[2:02:10] where was God we cannot say it's
[2:02:13] lightning we cannot say it's the devil
[2:02:15] can the devil come and stay at the
[2:02:17] holiday they must be God himself amen
[2:02:21] so that means god is no longer here
[2:02:24] they knew
[2:02:25] that's why even the denominations one
[2:02:28] man one woman preacher came to me and
[2:02:29] said pastor I want to tell you something
[2:02:31] I said
[2:02:33] the day you prayed for that blind woman
[2:02:36] and she saw
[2:02:38] and we we started coming and peeping and
[2:02:41] seeing he says we have told one another
[2:02:44] all denomination is now no that God just
[2:02:48] passes by our churches but he stays with
[2:02:51] you
[2:02:52] oh yeah they know
[2:02:56] Nicodemus confessed
[2:02:59] no man can do these things without amen
[2:03:01] amen we know we know
[2:03:03] they knew they were prepared so these
[2:03:06] nominations are just masquerading no
[2:03:08] wonder they are swallowing every Tommy
[2:03:10] wrote they are supporting any pervasion
[2:03:13] they have nothing
[2:03:15] they lose nothing they miss nothing they
[2:03:18] have no relationship with God
[2:03:24] so he left the dominations now he left
[2:03:27] the office of heavenly father he left
[2:03:29] the office of Christ
[2:03:31] hey
[2:03:33] now he's in the word incarnate
[2:03:37] [Music]
[2:03:40] hey man
[2:03:42] what incarnate
[2:03:44] that's where he is
[2:03:46] and where is that office in you if he is
[2:03:50] not yet in you younger man

[2:04:04] plans through Christ then out of Christ
[2:04:06] into the church continuing his work
[2:04:08] through the church
[2:04:15] and now we know what the holy spirit is

[2:04:22] then he comes down here may I say it
[2:04:25] like this all that God was he born into
[2:04:28] Christ because he emptied himself and
[2:04:31] poured it into Christ

[2:04:41] fullness of godhead body and all that
