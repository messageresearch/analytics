[10:05] fitting to what I want to speak on
[10:07] tonight that's such an encouragement
[10:09] let's just bow our heads and pray
[10:13] together precious Lord Jesus we so
[10:17] grateful Lord that you've given us
[10:20] another opportunity to come and to
[10:23] assemble ourselves together as your word
[10:25] has commanded us to
[10:28] Lord father
[10:30] we're once again so grateful that we can
[10:33] assemble here not just as a social
[10:37] Gathering although we love one another
[10:40] dearly Lord but we can come and we
[10:44] can gather together around
[10:48] you our mate the revealed word father
[10:53] may we never take that lightly what may
[10:56] we never lose focus and view of what
[11:00] we're doing when we assemble here Lord
[11:03] and who that you truly are father you've
[11:06] been so kind to give us a profit to come
[11:09] in this closing moments of time and
[11:13] reveal to us of what we should look for
[11:16] and that we're not
[11:18] looking as he said for nail prints or a
[11:21] scar in the side of somebody but we're
[11:24] looking for you in the form of your
[11:28] revealed word
[11:30] Lord for we are a gentile people and
[11:32] that's how you have declared that you
[11:34] would come to a gentile people father
[11:36] we're so grateful for that Insight we're
[11:38] so grateful that you in your grace and
[11:40] your mercy have shown us and told us the
[11:43] appropriate thing to be looking for and
[11:46] as such Lord now that we have seen you
[11:48] we want to recognize you for what you
[11:50] are and we want to yield ourselves to
[11:53] you
[11:54] Lord father not our own ideas but you
[11:57] the word we just ask now that you would
[12:03] come father I stand here as a mortal man
[12:07] tasked with something that no mortal man
[12:10] can do Lord and we're just asking now
[12:13] both speaker and hearer that you would
[12:16] come that you would pick up the book and
[12:18] that you would loose the seals and that
[12:20] you would feed your children Lord father
[12:22] I I believe in my heart if I had
[12:25] anything to offer I would offer it to
[12:27] this people Lord for I know that your
[12:29] there your purchase price father but I
[12:33] have nothing Lord so we're completely
[12:36] dependent and Counting upon you this
[12:38] evening but not in vain Lord for we know
[12:41] that you have told us where two or three
[12:43] are gathered there you would
[12:45] be and we know that you're not like us
[12:48] as a man Lord that would lie but you are
[12:51] God and that you cannot lie and we take
[12:54] comfort in this promise and we commit
[12:56] ourselves to you we ask that you would
[12:58] just come
[12:59] come truly take the preeminence here
[13:02] Lord and do that which you have ordained
[13:05] for this evening we ask this in the name
[13:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:11] amen God bless you if you have your
[13:13] Bibles we're going
[13:15] to go to Philippians chapter 2 greet you
[13:19] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[13:23] certainly want to greet any visitors
[13:24] that we have here this evening you're
[13:27] certainly
[13:28] welcome Public Service Announcement I
[13:31] will not be preaching for two and a half
[13:32] hours
[13:34] tonight so just
[13:40] relax I didn't say 2 hours and 15
[13:42] minutes I just said 2 and a half
[13:47] hours now I certainly want to in all
[13:50] seriousness thank you for your patience
[13:52] and your attentiveness for the last
[13:54] service it was definitely not pre-
[13:58] orchestrated and had no intentions of
[14:00] going that direction and certainly not
[14:03] that duration but um it happens I I
[14:08] don't know what else to say and
[14:10] sometimes we get too spiritual minded
[14:13] and we think that we've entered into
[14:15] eternity and forget that everybody else
[14:17] hasn't so it can create a issue there
[14:21] but I can say I can say one thing and
[14:23] honestly and I mean this from the bottom
[14:25] of my heart I never felt one Speck of
[14:27] anybody with resentment or anybody
[14:29] trying to shut me down um I don't know
[14:31] whether that's a good thing or a bad
[14:33] thing but I honestly can say when I
[14:35] closed that service that you all were
[14:36] still pulling with an honest heart and
[14:39] that that really says a lot um and I
[14:42] certainly appreciate that um another
[14:46] Public Service Announcement before I get
[14:47] started is I think I need to start with
[14:50] an altar call because we as a
[14:52] congregation have failed our
[14:55] pastor and this hit me right before I
[14:58] came to service when he texted me and
[15:00] told me that he was at Detroit airport
[15:02] with his two daughters getting ready to
[15:03] go to
[15:05] Australia and I thought how in this
[15:07] world did we as a congregation allow our
[15:10] pastor to be in Detroit airport with two
[15:12] young beautiful ladies going to the
[15:14] other side of the
[15:18] planet I mean you read in the Bible what
[15:21] happened with Abraham when he went
[15:22] somewhere out of his country
[15:27] so after I
[15:29] repented I made a couple Clicks in the
[15:32] computer and I've got brother Elmer and
[15:34] brother Gabe I've got you a ticket to go
[15:37] to Australia to ensure that they all
[15:40] three return
[15:43] safely and I also ordered some Halloween
[15:46] masks that should be waiting for the two
[15:48] daughters when they get to the airport
[15:50] there I don't think our pastor will need
[15:52] one um no offense there but just for
[15:56] safekeeping we've ordered them some
[15:58] masks so that uh nobody will dare look
[16:01] at them but sorry to Spring that on your
[16:05] brother Gabe and brother Elmer but I'm
[16:07] sure you're willing and able and won't
[16:09] be any issues to ensure the well-being
[16:12] of our pastor and his daughter and it's
[16:14] for the sake of the congregation as well
[16:16] so it's nothing uh nothing selfish
[16:20] there but we certainly appreciate them
[16:22] and we pray that they'll have a good
[16:25] trip and pray even harder that they come
[16:27] back at the appointed time
[16:30] so let's read here in Philippians
[16:33] chapter
[16:36] 2 beginning with verse one this is the
[16:40] same scripture that we used last time
[16:42] and I just want to continue this thought
[16:45] on the pride of life and I'm pretty
[16:49] certain I'm going to be stuck on this
[16:50] for a little bit so don't be surprised
[16:53] if um there's additional services with
[16:58] the same title
[17:01] says if there be therefore any
[17:03] consolation in
[17:05] Christ if any comfort of love if any
[17:08] Fellowship of the spirit if any bows and
[17:12] mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be
[17:16] like-minded having the same love being
[17:19] of one Accord of one
[17:21] mind let nothing be done through Strife
[17:25] or vain
[17:26] Glory but in loneliness of
[17:29] mind let each esteem others better than
[17:35] themselves look not every man on his own
[17:38] things but every man also on the things
[17:39] of
[17:42] others let this mind be in
[17:45] you which was also in Christ Jesus who
[17:48] being in the form of God thought it not
[17:50] robbery to be equal with God but made
[17:53] himself of no
[17:56] reputation and took upon him the form of
[17:58] a servant and was made in the likeness
[18:01] of men and being found in fashion as a
[18:04] man he humbled himself he humbled
[18:08] himself and became obedient unto death
[18:11] even to the death of the Cross God bless
[18:13] you as you would have your seats this
[18:15] evening we
[18:18] certainly request God to add his
[18:20] Blessing to the reading of his
[18:23] word I'm going to do a very brief review
[18:26] for maybe some that weren't here
[18:29] and just to lay a little context of
[18:31] where we're coming from but we're
[18:32] dealing with the pride of life
[18:35] and the scripture says here to let
[18:40] nothing be done through Strife or vain
[18:42] glory and last service we obviously laid
[18:45] a lot of emphasis on this nothing
[18:47] nothing is nothing not one single Speck
[18:50] of anything nothing be done through
[18:53] Strife or vain glory and to let this
[18:56] mind be in you which means a per missive
[18:59] Act of this is what God is trying to do
[19:02] but you need to let this happen let this
[19:05] mind be be in you which was also in
[19:09] Christ Jesus and then it defines to us
[19:12] what mine was in Christ
[19:15] Jesus and that was who being in the form
[19:18] of God thought it not robbery to be
[19:20] equal with God but made himself of no
[19:25] reputation he made himself self he made
[19:30] himself he humbled
[19:33] himself and made himself of no
[19:37] reputation and again the emphasis is on
[19:40] the no part not one thing because we
[19:43] don't want to come down to the end of
[19:45] the road and made oursel of almost no
[19:50] reputation that's not going to work out
[19:54] good at the ply
[19:55] Gates but of no reputation none
[20:00] whatsoever being found in fashion as a
[20:03] man he humbled
[20:05] himself he humbled himself it is
[20:07] something that
[20:10] he it was an action that he took it was
[20:14] not something that happened naturally it
[20:17] was something that he sought out and
[20:21] brought himself into subjection he
[20:24] humbled
[20:26] himself and became obedient to death
[20:28] even to the
[20:30] Cross Ezekiel
[20:33] 2 we
[20:35] see the exact opposite of
[20:39] this Ezekiel
[20:41] 2:2 son of man say unto the prince of
[20:44] Tyrus thus sayith the Lord because thine
[20:47] heart is lifted up this is the exact
[20:51] opposite of the mind of
[20:53] Christ the what the first is what Christ
[20:56] did and what Christ portrayed the second
[20:58] second is what Lucifer did what Satan
[21:01] did because thine heart is lifted
[21:06] up I find this scripture
[21:09] interesting because it says your heart
[21:12] is lifted up it doesn't say that your
[21:15] body is lifted up that your spirit is
[21:17] lifted up that your reputation is lifted
[21:20] up that the people have lifted you up
[21:23] those obviously would not be good but
[21:26] that's still not the main issue you can
[21:28] have none of that going
[21:31] on and still within your heart be lifted
[21:34] up that is the
[21:38] issue this is verse 17 that I'm reading
[21:41] from thine heart was lifted up because
[21:44] of thy Beauty thou Hast corrupted thy
[21:47] wisdom by reason of thy brightness I
[21:50] will cast thee to the ground I will lay
[21:52] before I will lay thee before kings that
[21:55] they may behold
[21:57] you
[22:00] so we see the
[22:02] contrast in the two Spirits one of
[22:04] Christ one of
[22:06] [Music]
[22:07] Satan Proverbs 6:16 these six things do
[22:11] doth the Lord hate yay seven are an
[22:14] Abomination to him a proud look first of
[22:18] the
[22:19] list the first on the list a proud look
[22:22] I'm not going to go through and read the
[22:24] others for time sake but we get the
[22:26] point there this is at the top of the
[22:28] list of the things that God
[22:30] hates and then 1 John 2:15 you don't
[22:33] have to turn there I'm just uh quoting
[22:35] this to refresh your memory says love
[22:38] not the word world neither the things
[22:41] that are in the world if any man love
[22:43] the world the love of the father is not
[22:44] in him for all that is in the
[22:48] world the lust of the flesh the lust of
[22:51] the eyes and the pride of life is not of
[22:55] the father but is of the world
[22:59] and the world passeth away in the lust
[23:01] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[23:04] God abideth
[23:08] forever so I'm pretty confident if we
[23:11] will do a thorough search of the
[23:12] scriptures in regards to
[23:15] Pride you're not going to find one
[23:17] positive
[23:20] thing you're going to find a lot of
[23:22] things against
[23:23] it there's not one positive thing to be
[23:27] said for this
[23:30] attribute I'm going to read this quote
[23:32] as I shared with you last time this was
[23:34] the quote that turned my world upside
[23:36] down several months ago
[23:39] um it's go tell my disciples
[23:42] 1953 speaking of Mary she knew there was
[23:46] something about him speaking of Jesus
[23:49] was different from anyone else she had
[23:52] Seven Devils cast out of her everybody
[23:55] that's ever been free from the Devil by
[23:56] the power of Jesus Christ knows where
[23:59] they're standing no one can ever come in
[24:01] his great divine presence and ever be
[24:03] the same person anymore so she had Seven
[24:06] Devils cast out of her pride and
[24:10] envy she thought she was so pretty and
[24:15] that there was no one like
[24:17] her so again when I'm reading this quote
[24:20] we're common with we're familiar with
[24:22] this story as Mary she had Seven Devils
[24:24] cast out of her but now all of a sudden
[24:26] a prophet looks into that realm and he
[24:29] starts listing off what these devils
[24:32] are and he says pride and envy but then
[24:37] he goes a step further and he starts
[24:40] defining what pride and envy
[24:43] is
[24:45] and this is just where I'm at with this
[24:48] you know I can say with an honest heart
[24:50] I never thought I was prideful I never
[24:53] thought I was envious I never wanted
[24:54] that I would never desire that but the
[24:56] problem with that is is it was my own
[24:58] standard of what equals
[25:02] Pride that is the problem because I do
[25:07] not have the authority to Divi to Define
[25:11] what pride
[25:13] is only a Vindicated Prophet can come on
[25:18] the scene and
[25:20] Define what this Spirit really
[25:24] is so now this is what hit me with such
[25:27] impact
[25:29] is when he puts when he adjusts the
[25:32] standard to me this is what happened to
[25:36] me I have my standard but now a prophet
[25:40] comes on the scene and adjusts my
[25:42] standard he adjust it to the correct
[25:46] standard so now everything that I've
[25:49] done for the last 39 years that I didn't
[25:52] think there was an issue with now has to
[25:56] be compared to this new standard
[26:00] and the standard is a little woman who
[26:02] thought she was so pretty and there was
[26:03] nobody like
[26:06] her now I've got 39 years to review of
[26:10] every situation that I've been in that I
[26:13] thought I was a little bit better and
[26:15] there was nobody like
[26:19] me yes I'm still digging in case you
[26:22] were wondering yes I'm still dealing
[26:24] with
[26:27] situations but but that's what happens
[26:29] when the standard is set
[26:33] reset that's what happens when the truth
[26:36] comes in the TR the scripture says the
[26:38] truth will set you free what's it going
[26:41] to set you free it's going to set you
[26:42] free of your own standard it's going to
[26:45] give you an appropriate standard and if
[26:48] you will submit yourself to that
[26:50] appropriate standard then and only then
[26:52] will it set you
[26:54] free but a prophet of God has the
[26:58] authority to reset our
[27:02] standards right questions and answers on
[27:05] Hebrews
[27:06] 1957 says now let's take back to Cain
[27:09] could you tell me where that spirit and
[27:11] that meanness came from if Cain was the
[27:13] son of Adam which was a Son of God where
[27:16] did that evil come from the first thing
[27:18] when he was born he hated he was a
[27:20] murderer he was jealous and now from now
[27:24] take the nature of his daddy the very
[27:27] start in the beginning Lucifer and he
[27:30] was in the beginning he was jealous of
[27:33] Michael that's what started the whole
[27:37] trouble again we've had our own ideas
[27:40] and our own standards and our own
[27:42] thoughts of what caused the trouble what
[27:43] the issue was it was this it was that
[27:46] but now a prophet comes on the scene and
[27:48] reveals this is where it started this is
[27:51] the root of it this is this is the very
[27:56] very beginning of an issue issue and
[27:59] this issue is because he was jealous of
[28:05] Michael when we really grasp this and
[28:08] when we really come to an understanding
[28:10] of this I think it will be shocking to
[28:11] us everything evil and bad and negative
[28:15] that we see around us on a daily
[28:20] basis because somebody was
[28:27] jealous the power of that Spirit we say
[28:32] oh it's just a little pride a lot of
[28:34] times we'll say well that guy just
[28:35] thinks a little bit too much of
[28:39] himself this is the very thing that
[28:43] caused every negative thing that has
[28:46] struck this
[28:49] Earth he thought he was a little bit
[28:52] better than Michael he thought that he
[28:55] could run things a little bit better
[29:06] Saints we're called for a
[29:09] rapture we are called for our atoms to
[29:12] change we before that we are called to
[29:15] be the very image of Christ on this
[29:17] Earth
[29:19] today how do we think that we're going
[29:23] to fulfill the very and manifest the
[29:27] very image of Christ
[29:28] Christ to be him on this Earth to the
[29:32] point that we change Dimension
[29:35] Dimensions with our atams changing if we
[29:38] have even a speck of the thing that
[29:42] started it in the
[29:46] beginning it's just not going to
[29:52] work if this was the issue at the
[29:57] beginning
[29:59] do we think for a second that God is
[30:01] going to allow that issue back
[30:04] in to cause the same issue
[30:10] again he is not going to do
[30:13] it but I thank God because he sent us a
[30:21] word to do this work he has sent us a
[30:26] word to accomplish what needs to be
[30:30] accomplished he sent us a quote that can
[30:33] wreck our
[30:35] lives turn our lives upside down
[30:38] redefine the
[30:42] standard so it's just
[30:44] not something that he's going to say oh
[30:46] you know I'll take care of everything
[30:48] and it won't happen again it's not going
[30:49] to come back into my kingdom he has he
[30:52] has come
[30:55] himself to expose this
[31:01] Spirit to make sure that it doesn't
[31:03] happen again brother random says that
[31:06] the bride will not be deceived we have
[31:08] to remember the bride is not going to be
[31:10] deceived just because he said she's not
[31:12] going to be deceived she's not going to
[31:15] be deceived because he has came himself
[31:18] to ensure she won't be deceived and the
[31:21] way that he has ensured that is he's
[31:24] came and he's told her amen this is an
[31:29] issue deal with
[31:31] it it won't work over
[31:34] here so it's not about us floating
[31:37] around and oh we're the bride we can't
[31:39] be deceived everything's fine no if we
[31:41] do not yield to this word this word is
[31:45] the power and the Avenue and the reason
[31:49] we won't be
[31:51] deceived we cannot not subject ourselves
[31:55] to the word and think we're going to
[31:57] turn out
[31:59] okay it's not going to
[32:03] work he has given us away out but we
[32:07] have to take the way
[32:10] out he has exposed these
[32:13] spirits but we can't you know shut the
[32:17] door of our heart and say well no that
[32:19] part's okay I
[32:20] don't no we we actively and this is
[32:24] what's just on my heart and this is what
[32:25] I've been dealing with for months is we
[32:27] had better be actively pursuing this in
[32:30] our daily
[32:31] lives we should be actively hunting this
[32:35] Spirit down in our daily
[32:38] lives not being naive and thinking that
[32:42] we're okay and that we've got it figured
[32:45] out and that this isn't an issue with
[32:49] us we should be hunting this down in our
[32:55] lives actively pursuing it
[32:59] opening all the doors turning over all
[33:02] the
[33:03] stones I assure you it's in there
[33:05] somewhere amen yes sir it might just be
[33:09] a tiny little speck but it's in there
[33:11] somewhere this came through the fall
[33:14] this was injected into the human
[33:17] race and until our atoms change it's
[33:21] going to be there and you are going to
[33:23] have to deal with it on a daily
[33:26] basis
[33:29] I'm going to have to deal with it on a
[33:30] daily basis it is once this standard was
[33:35] reset and my eyes were open to this the
[33:40] level and the depths and the
[33:44] intertwining and the spider webbing of
[33:46] this Spirit was shocking to me it still
[33:48] is shocking to me it's
[33:53] repulsive but the one thing that I don't
[33:56] want to do
[33:59] is act like I'm okay and act like it's
[34:01] not really there and act like well
[34:02] that's just a petty thing it's no if
[34:04] it's a petty thing you better deal with
[34:06] it cuz it's not going to stay a petty
[34:08] thing remember his goal is not to stay
[34:10] on a white horse his goal is to get on a
[34:13] red horse and then a black horse and
[34:14] then run you into spiritual death by not
[34:17] dealing with the petty things the reason
[34:19] the bride will not be deceived is
[34:22] because the seals were broke we can all
[34:23] say Amen to that but the seals were
[34:26] broke not just as interpret ations of
[34:28] symbols the seals were broke brother
[34:30] Brandon says to reveal the tactics of
[34:32] the enemy you and I will not be deceived
[34:36] because of one thing we know the tactics
[34:39] of the
[34:40] enemy outside of that you will be
[34:43] deceived it wasn't just the
[34:45] interpretation of the symbols but it was
[34:47] revealing to us he's going to come on
[34:50] something that looks like the word
[34:56] first that's what why we won't be
[34:59] deceived not
[35:02] because I'm the bride I just won't be
[35:07] deceived if you do not take this word of
[35:10] God that has been given to us and
[35:12] actively hunt down and actively pursue
[35:14] that white horse rider in your life you
[35:17] will be deceived that's
[35:21] true am and you'll also find yourself
[35:24] fighting for that
[35:26] deception and you find yourself in
[35:28] spiritual
[35:30] famine and if you're the Bride of Jesus
[35:32] Christ before you get on that horse of
[35:33] spiritual death thank God we can't get
[35:35] on that he will come and he will knock
[35:37] you off your
[35:40] horse and I thank God for that I thank
[35:44] God even when I miss it on the first one
[35:46] and miss it on the second and I miss it
[35:47] on the third one I thank God in his
[35:50] grace and his Mercy that he will
[35:52] supernaturally interject himself into my
[35:56] life because Saints I do not have faith
[35:59] in myself to catch it on the first one I
[36:01] don't even have faith in myself to catch
[36:03] it on the second or third one I need him
[36:05] to supernaturally come
[36:09] down and say son you better look around
[36:13] and you better get a grasp on yourself
[36:15] and your
[36:16] situation and I am coming I'm going to
[36:18] pluck you up out of
[36:21] this and if I wouldn't do that look at
[36:24] where you would
[36:26] be
[36:28] I I don't ever want to get so
[36:32] spiritual that I think I don't need
[36:35] that I do want to grow spiritually to
[36:39] where I can start recognizing it as the
[36:42] White Horse Rider and the red horse and
[36:43] God forbid a black horse I do want to
[36:46] grow spiritually I do want to grow to
[36:50] the point that he's not constantly
[36:52] having to come down and pluck me out and
[36:54] rescue me supernaturally that's what
[36:56] we're called for that's what he's given
[36:58] his word for that in and of itself is
[37:01] Supernatural but we are called to grow
[37:03] spiritually and not constantly having
[37:06] that go go on but I never never want
[37:10] that to be unwelcome around
[37:12] me I I want him to constantly come and
[37:16] rescue
[37:19] me I need
[37:25] that brother brandom says and humble
[37:28] thyselves now surely after all these
[37:29] years on the field and around the world
[37:31] seeing different people ought to know a
[37:33] little bit about the gate to enter
[37:35] in and if you want to get somewhere with
[37:38] God never let an arrogant Spirit come
[37:44] around
[37:47] you he doesn't even say don't let an
[37:50] Eric Spirit get on
[37:52] you he says if you want to get anywhere
[37:56] with God anywhere
[37:58] never let an arrogant Spirit even come
[38:01] around
[38:04] you that's
[38:08] how
[38:09] actively hunting down this spirit I want
[38:12] to be that even before it gets on
[38:18] me I want to be recognizing it and
[38:23] casting it away from
[38:25] me I want to to be cognizant of it on a
[38:30] daily basis not if it's coming but how
[38:34] it's coming
[38:36] yes because I assure you it's coming
[38:40] some way same some
[38:42] form some
[38:45] fashion it is trying to work in our
[38:49] lives never let an arrogant Spirit a
[38:52] prideful
[38:53] Spirit come around
[38:56] you
[38:58] in the church age
[39:00] book brother randam says I believe
[39:02] Brother Kyle read this last time he
[39:04] ministered
[39:05] it and it just struck me so
[39:08] profoundly in the church age book he
[39:10] says be zealous and repent now this
[39:12] false church has Zeal make no mistake
[39:16] about that he says but it's a wrong
[39:19] Zeal he says they have put the word out
[39:22] for their own
[39:25] ideas this is what Pride does every time
[39:28] like its pattern will not change it this
[39:31] is what it will do every time it will
[39:33] take your own idea over the word of God
[39:38] that's first thing it
[39:42] does he
[39:44] says but God is calling for another Zeal
[39:48] it is the Zeal to cry I am
[39:52] wrong and this is the part that struck
[39:55] me it's the Zeal to cry I am
[39:59] wrong now I'm going to read it to you a
[40:01] little bit different it is the Zeal to
[40:04] cry I
[40:07] am
[40:11] wrong
[40:13] not I handled this wrong I handled that
[40:16] wrong I'm doing this wrong I did that
[40:19] wrong this is the Zeal to cry I
[40:22] am wrong when you see wrong this is me
[40:30] I am
[40:33] wrong because if we can never come to
[40:37] this level of recognition and this level
[40:40] of humility to even recognize that we
[40:43] are wrong amen
[40:48] amen how in the world are we going to
[40:51] recognize that we even need
[40:53] help how are we going yes see if you
[40:57] can't recognize that you're lost how can
[41:00] you recognize you need a
[41:03] savior brother brandom even condemned
[41:05] this in the Divine Healing movement he
[41:07] said you people going around here saying
[41:09] I'm not sick I'm not sick I'm not sick
[41:11] I'm not sick he says no you are
[41:14] sick you do have a problem
[41:19] but he was wounded for our
[41:22] transgressions he was bruised for our
[41:24] iniquities SS of God if we can't come
[41:27] and I'm not talking about a fake I'm
[41:29] talking about a real true Revelation
[41:31] when we look back and we open up the
[41:34] doors of our life and we open up the
[41:36] doors of our mind and of our spirit and
[41:38] if we can't in
[41:41] genuine genuine genuinely come before
[41:44] God yes with that True Confession I am
[41:49] wrong I'm the very essence of
[41:55] wrome only an arrogant spirit IR will
[41:57] keep you from that that's right to think
[42:00] that you're maybe a little bit right
[42:02] about something somewhat okay
[42:09] no I'm not talking about your soul and
[42:11] I'm not talking about the word of God in
[42:13] your soul we're we're much better taught
[42:15] than that but as Paul
[42:18] said in me that is my
[42:22] flesh in me that is my flesh there is
[42:28] one good thing half of a good thing
[42:32] three4 of a percent of a good
[42:34] thing no good
[42:38] thing amen remember who Paul was Paul
[42:43] was sent to the first church as the
[42:45] first church age Messenger to establish
[42:48] and build the foundation for the church
[42:50] why do you think Paul had to have the
[42:52] proper Revelation I am wrong in me is no
[42:56] good thing that is my
[43:00] flesh because the church buil on any
[43:02] other Revelation would have
[43:04] failed it wouldn't even stood a chance
[43:07] it would have never even got
[43:10] started I would say this is probably the
[43:13] most important Revelation that we can
[43:15] get because without it there can be no
[43:18] spiritual
[43:19] growth and even if you think there's
[43:21] spiritual growth You'll Go 39 years to
[43:23] realize there was no spiritual growth
[43:24] and you got to go back to kindergarten
[43:25] again come on now
[43:33] it is a Zeal to cry remember this is not
[43:36] just a cry this is not just a confession
[43:39] this is a zealous cry a zealous
[43:44] confession I am
[43:48] wrong now who is going to say that he is
[43:53] wrong what is it that all these
[43:55] denominations are based upon
[43:59] who's going to say that they're wrong
[44:01] the scripture says every man in his own
[44:03] eyeses thinks he's right there's denom
[44:07] denominations built on the very essence
[44:10] of not admitting that they're wrong
[44:12] we're talking millions of people we're
[44:14] talking billions of
[44:17] dollars built on something other than
[44:20] the confession I am
[44:22] wrong he says who's going to say that
[44:26] they all claim
[44:30] originality and that of God being
[44:32] original with
[44:34] God they claim
[44:36] that they are all
[44:39] right they all claim that they're all
[44:44] right now they all cannot be
[44:48] right in fact not one of them is right
[44:53] I'm going to let you in a little bit
[44:54] something don't leave this out in the
[44:55] denominational world
[45:01] don't leave it out there Saints we're
[45:02] we're way past that
[45:06] age who in this church building is going
[45:08] to say that they're
[45:10] wrong do we all not think that we're
[45:15] right is that not what all our daily
[45:17] lives is built upon the fact that we all
[45:20] think that we're okay that we're right
[45:22] let's bring it home
[45:25] now you all cannot be
[45:28] right in fact not one of you are right I
[45:32] need to turn around so I can do this not
[45:34] any of us are
[45:37] right they are all Whited sepers full of
[45:41] dead men's
[45:43] bones that's
[45:46] me without your grace in my life that's
[45:49] me dead men's
[45:55] bones they have no life they have no
[45:57] Vindication God has never made himself
[46:00] known in any organization they say they
[46:02] are right because they are the ones
[46:04] saying it but saying it does not make it
[46:06] so right
[46:10] right oh Lord have
[46:13] mercy it amazes me how the simplest
[46:17] statements are so
[46:20] profound since we can say whatever we
[46:23] want to say it doesn't mean that it's so
[46:26] amen
[46:32] they need the indicated thus saith the
[46:35] Lord of God and they don't have
[46:40] it if God backs you up with thus sayith
[46:46] the
[46:47] Lord then you are
[46:50] right and if he does that for all of you
[46:53] then you're all
[46:55] right but if he does doesn't do that
[46:58] then you're wrong and you're all wrong
[47:00] and I am wrong and just because we want
[47:02] to confess something else other than
[47:05] thus sayith the Lord does it make it
[47:09] so and I I honestly feel that there's
[47:12] nobody in here that wants to do that I
[47:14] believe
[47:19] that now let me say this
[47:22] here this is still in the quote this is
[47:25] him speaking
[47:27] just in thought you just in case you
[47:29] thought I was making it
[47:30] up now let me say this here I don't
[47:34] believe that God is calling only to the
[47:37] false Church to
[47:40] repent in this verse he is talking to
[47:45] his elect
[47:51] amen they have some repenting to do
[47:55] too amen
[48:02] yes saints of God over the last couple
[48:05] months I have found out that I am
[48:10] wrong when I compare my life and my
[48:13] attitude and my
[48:15] being to the new standard the Vindicated
[48:21] standard I came to a real hard
[48:25] conclusion that actually most every
[48:27] situation that I've dealt with in my
[48:28] life I've handled
[48:31] wrong I have found out that I Define the
[48:34] word
[48:36] wrong even when some of the things I did
[48:39] were right that's right because I did
[48:41] them with the wrong
[48:47] attitude this is not a pleasant reality
[48:50] to come to
[48:52] no it's been a very hard reality to come
[48:55] to and especially stand before the
[48:58] purchased blood of Jesus Christ and
[49:04] preach I have not only found out that I
[49:08] am
[49:11] wrong but the real thing that bothers me
[49:15] is I've realized I'm actually so wrong
[49:18] in this Fallen
[49:20] state that I don't even know what I'm
[49:22] wrong
[49:25] about
[49:30] this has so infiltrated this human race
[49:33] over 6,000 years
[49:36] yes I am so
[49:41] wrong I don't even know what part of me
[49:43] is
[49:48] wrong there are things ingrained in My
[49:51] DNA and in my culture and in my
[49:55] upbringing
[49:57] that's been there for
[49:59] Generations well before I even came on
[50:01] the
[50:02] scene they were wrong back then I'm
[50:05] eight Generations down the line and it's
[50:08] been taught and accepted the whole way
[50:10] down through you think I'm going to pick
[50:12] up on
[50:19] it I am so wrong I don't even know where
[50:22] to begin to start being
[50:25] right like where do I start repenting at
[50:29] first I'm four months in over one
[50:34] quote and I still haven't came to the
[50:37] end of
[50:38] it four I'm not exaggerating four months
[50:42] I have been scouring my life and opening
[50:44] doors and looking at situations only to
[50:46] realize I was
[50:49] wrong even when I was
[50:52] right I was wrong because I would have a
[50:55] little bit of pride in my my heart about
[50:58] something or I would handle it the wrong
[51:02] way in my heart not even in an outward
[51:07] manifestation four months I don't see
[51:10] the end of it
[51:11] yet constantly going back over stuff and
[51:14] I'm not stop I'm not talking the
[51:16] fanatical aspect of I'm not even a Son
[51:18] of God and no I Know Who I Am by his
[51:21] grace I know who I am but we also have
[51:23] to deal with the reality and the reality
[51:26] that in me is no good thing that is my
[51:29] flesh
[51:31] amen and let's not get so high on our
[51:33] horse that we think that we're in the
[51:34] spirit all the
[51:36] time saints of God even when you're in
[51:39] the spirit your flesh is tugging on
[51:50] you the seventh angel I remind you was
[51:53] standing behind the pulpit delivering
[51:54] the pure word of God and he would say I
[51:56] take this scripture and tie this man
[52:02] up you don't think he was anointed you
[52:04] don't think he was in the
[52:06] spirit if he can do it behind the pulpit
[52:09] delivering the word of God where am I
[52:13] Monday morning 30 minutes into the
[52:18] conversation with something that should
[52:21] clearly be covered by
[52:25] insurance
[52:28] I wish I wish I had the gift of
[52:30] discernment right now just to tap into a
[52:32] couple examples
[52:37] here we all have them do we
[52:40] not walk out here on Cloud9 Sunday
[52:43] Monday morning 30 minutes into the
[52:45] conversation and they clearly cannot see
[52:47] the problem here and I'm thoroughly
[52:50] convinced that if I just raised my voice
[52:52] a little bit more or if I repeat myself
[52:54] four
[52:55] times
[52:57] it will help the situation and they'll
[52:59] finally
[53:03] see that list of examples could go on
[53:06] well past our two and a half hour
[53:11] bark even when we are in the
[53:15] spirit that white horse is trailing
[53:19] along constantly tugging constantly
[53:22] trying to do something and even in the
[53:25] midst of a service even as a
[53:29] minister the flesh can interject itself
[53:32] that
[53:34] quick it's
[53:37] terrifying who in their right mind would
[53:39] want to stand here and do
[53:42] this knowing that from one minute to the
[53:45] next from one sentence to the next
[53:48] something can strike in your brain and
[53:49] you think it's of the Lord and you can
[53:51] say it and it might even be right and
[53:54] you say it with the wrong spirit
[53:58] because you're purposely trying to cut
[54:02] somebody it's a slick Spirit Saints it
[54:06] is a slick Spirit it is not going to
[54:08] come to you as well taught as you are
[54:10] and try to throw a spirit of on you just
[54:13] to openly go out and denounce your
[54:16] brothers and your sisters and attack
[54:19] their credibility and their character
[54:21] you're not going to do that for a 30
[54:23] minute
[54:24] conversation what it's going to do is in
[54:26] the midst of that 30-minute conversation
[54:28] or in the midst of that three-hour
[54:30] fellowship with you and your brothers
[54:31] and sisters there's going to be a white
[54:33] horse slip into the room and a piece of
[54:35] conversation is going to come up where
[54:37] you have the opportunity to say three
[54:39] words that
[54:41] demolishes your brother and sister's
[54:43] character and then you'll go on and
[54:44] you'll keep talking about something else
[54:47] but because that person hurt you or
[54:48] because you felt you was justified
[54:50] you'll say those three words in the
[54:52] midst of three
[54:54] hours not even catching
[54:58] but it felt good when you said it on now
[55:01] and you were
[55:03] right and you may have been but because
[55:06] you said it with the wrong spirit and
[55:08] with wrong
[55:10] intentions you were wrong amen that's
[55:14] right brother Ram says we're coming to a
[55:16] honed Razor's
[55:20] Edge I
[55:22] think that it's time we be honest with
[55:25] ourselves
[55:27] because it's the only thing that's going
[55:28] to work and I mean real real honest with
[55:32] ourselves no matter the cost I think we
[55:36] better actively pursue this spirit in
[55:38] our life in our spiritual realm and be
[55:41] real honest with
[55:47] ourselves because if not it's going to
[55:49] find a holding
[55:53] place I don't believe that God is
[55:55] calling un to the false Church to repent
[55:58] in this verse he is talking to his elect
[56:01] they have some repenting to do
[56:09] too as I said I've come to the
[56:11] conclusion that I'm so wrong I don't
[56:13] even know where I'm wrong
[56:15] at and in one sense that terrifies me
[56:17] but in another sense there's nothing I
[56:20] can do about it anyhow so what's being
[56:21] terrified going to accomplish what it
[56:24] does is it makes me very cognant and
[56:26] very aware of my need for this word amen
[56:30] amen I have come to the conclusion that
[56:33] I have
[56:35] zero power and zero ability to discern
[56:41] myself amen that's
[56:46] right our Pastor said this Sunday when
[56:49] he was ministering you know we think
[56:51] we're in this part of the prophecy and
[56:53] maybe we are maybe we're not we think
[56:54] this we think that but the real key to
[56:57] all of that to have a proper
[56:59] understanding is
[57:00] first first recognize maybe we don't
[57:04] have it all figured out let's start
[57:08] there if we can't start there we're
[57:11] probably going to have a skewed
[57:15] picture but if we can start there and
[57:19] really honestly before God admit I don't
[57:23] have things figured out and I need some
[57:25] help
[57:26] yes remember he is our Heavenly Father
[57:29] Like if one of my children come to me
[57:31] and like Hey Dad I can't figure this out
[57:33] I need some help what am I going to do
[57:35] as a good
[57:36] father going to help him it's what we
[57:39] want to do if I can do that in a carnal
[57:41] sense how much more how much more does
[57:45] he want to help us knowing that we're in
[57:49] Fallen flesh knowing that we don't stand
[57:51] a chance so in one sense I'm terrified I
[57:54] don't even know where to begin at
[57:56] in another sense it's a pretty good
[57:58] place to be Lord I'm so wrong I don't
[58:01] even know where to begin at what's a
[58:03] good father going to do he's going to
[58:06] take the next four months and reveal to
[58:08] you over the course of the last 39 years
[58:10] of where all you've went wrong
[58:13] at now you have that option of whether
[58:16] you line up to the word or not he can't
[58:18] force you to do that I can show my boys
[58:21] the proper way to do something I can't
[58:23] force them to do that they've got to
[58:25] make the decision well yeah that looks
[58:27] like a good idea that might work but I'm
[58:28] want to try this
[58:31] instead it may be
[58:33] fine in a spiritual realm that's not
[58:35] going to work out for you it's either
[58:38] going to be this way or no
[58:42] way and until we subject ourselves to
[58:45] that we're going to stay right there and
[58:47] we're going to have that in our life and
[58:49] we're going to have no spiritual
[58:52] growth brother brandom
[58:54] said if you saw him man
[58:58] paraphrasing if you saw a man that was
[59:01] blind out on the street with no clothes
[59:03] on in a horrible
[59:05] condition you would want to go to that
[59:07] man and help
[59:10] him but if that man didn't realize that
[59:14] he was blind naked out in the street
[59:18] wandering around yes if he didn't
[59:20] recognize there was a problem that's
[59:23] right how can you help him that's right
[59:30] you say that's really Elementary I know
[59:33] and I'm sorry it's just where I'm
[59:35] at like I would love to be preaching
[59:38] something higher than this but this is
[59:41] just where I'm at
[59:44] Saints if we don't even recognize
[59:47] there's a problem how can he help us
[59:50] yes he can't we first got to come to the
[59:54] recognition you know you know what there
[59:57] might be some aspects of my life that
[59:58] need some attention there may be some
[1:00:00] aspects of my life that's not lining up
[1:00:02] to the message there may be some
[1:00:04] thoughts in my head that's not true I
[1:00:06] may not have everything figured out the
[1:00:08] way that I think I
[1:00:20] do 1947
[1:00:24] experiences
[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:00:33] um yeah I'll go ahead and start with
[1:00:35] this
[1:00:38] one my subtitle for this is a little bit
[1:00:45] better little bit better three
[1:00:48] words lot of

[1:02:51] than
[1:02:53] somebody all alien iated from
[1:02:57] God Amen do you want to be alienated
[1:03:01] from God think you're a little bit
[1:03:03] better than
[1:03:07] somebody it's a powerful Spirit
[1:03:10] Saints it puts us in positions we do not
[1:03:13] want to be in it puts us in positions
[1:03:16] and we think we're still okay thinking
[1:03:19] you're a little bit better than
[1:03:21] somebody alienated from God
[1:03:27] you say I'm just a backslid a little bit
[1:03:29] no you're alienated from God that's per
[1:03:33] the
[1:03:33] standard yes he's the standard not
[1:03:42] me belong to some of these big churches
[1:03:45] and hiding behind every Church where
[1:03:47] you're trying to hide your sins God by
[1:03:49] Sovereign election remember he started
[1:03:51] out with the question who was you but
[1:03:54] now he's saying God by Sovereign
[1:03:56] election called you into this wonderful
[1:04:00] Fellowship what did you have to do with
[1:04:02] that nothing you were a sinner a stooped
[1:04:06] sinner an aristocratical
[1:04:10] sinner but
[1:04:12] God in his Sovereign
[1:04:15] election amen called you into this
[1:04:17] wonderful Fellowship so where would you
[1:04:19] be without the calling of God on your
[1:04:22] life not in a good place yes alienated
[1:04:26] from God he says he called you into this
[1:04:30] wonderful Fellowship you lost all of
[1:04:33] your
[1:04:36] pride the first thing that he goes to
[1:04:39] when God calls you when he truly calls
[1:04:41] you into
[1:04:42] Fellowship the first thing that you did
[1:04:44] was you lost all of your
[1:04:46] pride you say well I've been in
[1:04:48] fellowship with God for however many
[1:04:51] years
[1:04:53] really if you've had Pride injected into
[1:04:57] any of that you were not in True
[1:04:58] Fellowship with him you may have had an
[1:05:01] experience with him you may have even
[1:05:03] had some fellowship with him but I'm
[1:05:04] talking about pure Fellowship total
[1:05:09] Fellowship pure fellowship and total
[1:05:11] fellowship with God cannot come until
[1:05:14] all pride is gone
[1:05:17] amen he says you lost all your pride
[1:05:20] everything 1957 washing jesus' feet he
[1:05:24] says now these Pharisees was long ways
[1:05:26] from being poor men some of them were
[1:05:28] exceedingly Rich they got the tithings
[1:05:30] and the offerings and the cuts from the
[1:05:31] sacrifice they were rich men and they
[1:05:33] were looked up to and they had to live
[1:05:35] an honest life and respected as the
[1:05:37] clergy men in the
[1:05:41] city but may I say this that with all of
[1:05:45] that which is all right but if your
[1:05:48] heart isn't right with God you're not
[1:05:50] nothing in the eyes of God
[1:05:53] yet let's go back and look over those
[1:05:58] adjectives they were looked up to they
[1:06:01] lived an honest life and were respected
[1:06:04] as clergymen in the city it's a pretty
[1:06:06] good
[1:06:09] resume not sure that I wouldn't even
[1:06:11] want to have that
[1:06:13] resume he says but if your heart isn't
[1:06:17] right with God you're still
[1:06:20] nothing meaning your opinion of yourself
[1:06:25] the opinion of the community and the
[1:06:27] opinion of the church means
[1:06:31] nothing means
[1:06:34] nothing if your heart isn't right with
[1:06:37] God you're not nothing in the eyes of
[1:06:40] God yet no matter how religious how
[1:06:41] respected how good a name you have how
[1:06:43] honest you are it doesn't mean one thing
[1:06:45] in the eyes of God he says we're
[1:06:48] watching this Pharisee and I can see him
[1:06:50] as he walks back and forth in the great
[1:06:51] corridors of his home I'm dror so and so
[1:06:54] in this city you know I'm a
[1:06:55] well-respected
[1:06:56] citizen what I say is Law and
[1:07:00] Order I am a great
[1:07:05] man remember don't leave this 2,000
[1:07:08] years
[1:07:11] ago and when you get to thinking that in
[1:07:14] your
[1:07:15] heart then you're nothing that you ought
[1:07:18] to be says the
[1:07:19] Bible this is a man that can stand there
[1:07:21] say I am honest I am respected I am a
[1:07:24] man of God and they are all
[1:07:27] factual it is
[1:07:32] true but the fact that he thinks that in
[1:07:35] his heart that that makes him something
[1:07:37] alienates him from God and means that he
[1:07:40] is nothing in the eyes of
[1:07:42] God
[1:07:44] Amen he
[1:07:46] says when a man thinks he's just a
[1:07:49] little bit better than somebody else you
[1:07:52] are on your road out
[1:07:59] I I do not have the capacity to reveal
[1:08:02] the gravity of this to you Saints I can
[1:08:04] stand here until Kingdom Come and preach
[1:08:06] it and it has to be a personal
[1:08:08] revelation between you and Christ there
[1:08:10] is no way that I have this ability
[1:08:12] because it would require me going with
[1:08:15] Discerning power into each and every one
[1:08:17] of your old's lives and saying see this
[1:08:19] situation it was right here I don't have
[1:08:21] that ability I don't have that
[1:08:24] power you personally have to take the
[1:08:27] word of God and open yourself to the
[1:08:30] word of God and let him search this out
[1:08:32] in your life if not I'm simply going to
[1:08:34] be standing here preaching and you're
[1:08:36] going to think is that brother ever
[1:08:37] going to get off of Pride like do
[1:08:39] something preach the seals preach the
[1:08:40] plagues preach the
[1:08:42] vs if if the gravity of this situation
[1:08:46] hits you of this Spirit and the
[1:08:49] intertwinings and the inner workings and
[1:08:51] the intricate ways it has hold in our
[1:08:53] lives if it ever if it if the lid ever
[1:08:57] comes off of that to
[1:08:59] you I think you'll be of the same
[1:09:01] opinion to me we better pre be preaching
[1:09:03] on Pride for the rest of the time amen
[1:09:06] because it's everywhere and it is in
[1:09:14] everything the minute you think you're a
[1:09:17] little bit better than somebody else not
[1:09:19] even a lot better not even the
[1:09:24] best just a little bit better than
[1:09:27] somebody else meaning here's the
[1:09:31] best here's you 14 spaces down and then
[1:09:37] you're 14 out of
[1:09:42] 15 let's make it reality here's a scary
[1:09:45] thought how many billions of people are
[1:09:46] on the face of the Earth right now like
[1:09:49] 7even or8 billion so you're Six Trillion
[1:09:53] I don't even know the numbers I'm not
[1:09:54] smart enough I'm sorry but whatever
[1:09:56] you're one up from 7
[1:10:00] billion you're on your way
[1:10:02] out you say well that's a fanatical
[1:10:05] approach I say we better take a
[1:10:06] fanatical approach because Lucifer
[1:10:09] thought he was just better than one
[1:10:11] person in the beginning and here we are
[1:10:13] that's
[1:10:16] right if There's 7 billion on the planet
[1:10:20] I better have a real true honest
[1:10:23] Revelation in my heart I'm Number s
[1:10:25] billion and without his grace and his
[1:10:27] Mercy in my life I don't stand a
[1:10:30] chance that's
[1:10:32] true honestly not making it up that's
[1:10:36] really the humility that we have to come
[1:10:39] to you say well why do we have to go to
[1:10:42] that extreme why do we have to go to
[1:10:43] that level why does it have to be that
[1:10:47] way because my husband yes the revealed
[1:10:51] word amen Jesus Christ when he was
[1:10:54] standing on this Earth he made himself
[1:10:57] of no reputation amen I don't know how
[1:11:01] many were on the face of the Earth at
[1:11:03] that time but how many ever they were he
[1:11:05] was
[1:11:06] last amen yes and he made himself that
[1:11:10] way he humbled himself to that
[1:11:13] level
[1:11:16] amen if that's fanatical sign me up for
[1:11:22] fanaticism because that's where we have
[1:11:25] to come to we have to come to that same
[1:11:26] level
[1:11:28] amen abely
[1:11:34] right still speaking of this Pharisee
[1:11:36] situation he says that's right we're all
[1:11:38] the same in the eyes of God Rich poor
[1:11:40] brown black white yellow whatever we may
[1:11:42] be we're all on equal basis with God and
[1:11:44] when this self self styled Pharisee
[1:11:46] walked up and down the floor and said
[1:11:47] you know I believe I'll put on a great
[1:11:49] big party down here you know if I could
[1:11:51] just put on a big party cause all the
[1:11:53] people to talk about it I would get
[1:11:54] probably on the front page of the paper
[1:11:56] or in the society column if there was
[1:11:58] such a
[1:12:00] thing he says we see the same thing
[1:12:02] today people wanting to put on a show
[1:12:05] that the outside world would look at
[1:12:06] them that somebody would think that they
[1:12:08] would be big they want the biggest tent
[1:12:10] meeting or the biggest this or the be
[1:12:11] the best dressed crowd coming to their
[1:12:13] Church the biggest church the highest
[1:12:15] steeple the best of pews something big
[1:12:19] you say well none of that applies to
[1:12:21] us
[1:12:23] okay we want the biggest camp meeting in
[1:12:26] the
[1:12:28] message we
[1:12:30] want the most popular preacher in the
[1:12:34] message to come speak at our
[1:12:36] event it's the same
[1:12:39] Spirit fast forward 20 years it'll still
[1:12:43] manifest itself the same way you say
[1:12:45] well he was talking about parties and
[1:12:47] getting in the paper and maybe we just
[1:12:49] want everybody in the message to talk
[1:12:51] about
[1:12:53] it you all got the point I don't need to
[1:12:55] carry
[1:12:58] on he
[1:13:01] says he that will humble
[1:13:03] himself I'm sorry let me back up the
[1:13:06] best of few something big he says what
[1:13:08] we need is more God and not so much of
[1:13:11] the world he that will humble himself
[1:13:14] God will exalt but
[1:13:17] humbleness has to come
[1:13:21] first that's why this is so important to
[1:13:24] me because because me personally I've
[1:13:26] come to that Revelation that if
[1:13:30] humility is not there
[1:13:33] first it doesn't matter how up this how
[1:13:36] high up this message ladder I get
[1:13:39] Saints it doesn't matter if true
[1:13:43] humility is not here
[1:13:48] first as Paul said I come to the end of
[1:13:51] my road and I find myself Cast Away as
[1:13:54] one who preached the gospel
[1:13:55] yeah
[1:13:57] why because this wasn't first amen
[1:14:01] remember what the prophet said as the
[1:14:03] musicians comes I'm just going to have
[1:14:05] to stop because there is no way I'm
[1:14:06] going to even get close to finishing
[1:14:09] this and I had a promise I'm not going
[1:14:11] to keep you musicians come hurry it
[1:14:14] up but I'm going to keep going while I'm
[1:14:19] waiting humility has to come first he
[1:14:22] says if you want to get anywhere with
[1:14:24] God so let's just back up I'm not an
[1:14:26] English teacher again remember but
[1:14:27] remember anywhere would mean that you're
[1:14:29] gaining ground you're going somewhere
[1:14:32] but he says before you can even gain any
[1:14:34] ground you can never have an arrogant
[1:14:36] Spirit even around
[1:14:39] you that's why this is so important
[1:14:42] that's why we've got to be honest with
[1:14:44] ourselves and deal with this because
[1:14:45] this has to be dealt with first all of
[1:14:48] this has to be rooted out
[1:14:50] first
[1:14:51] firstly he says we watch this Pharisees
[1:14:54] as he as he walks up and down the floor
[1:14:56] he's trying to think oh if I could only
[1:14:58] think of some way now that I could get
[1:14:59] somebody for a drawing
[1:15:02] card if I could only think of somebody
[1:15:05] or something that I could put on a Big
[1:15:07] Show
[1:15:12] with I want to keep going because I'm
[1:15:14] getting ready to get in the flesh cuz
[1:15:16] I've seen some stuff I've seen this
[1:15:18] Spirit manifested
[1:15:20] out he says and all at once I see him as
[1:15:23] he rubs his chubby little hand together
[1:15:25] and he puts his hand on his rly poly
[1:15:28] stomach and he says oh why didn't I
[1:15:30] think of that that's the very idea not
[1:15:33] only will I be great before the people
[1:15:35] of the city but I'll be great amongst
[1:15:37] the other message Believers I mean the
[1:15:39] Pharisees the pastors of the message the
[1:15:42] pastors of the city he says you know
[1:15:44] what I'll do I'm going to send over and
[1:15:46] invite that little fell called Jesus of
[1:15:48] Nazareth that Holy Roller and I'm going
[1:15:51] to get down there and I'm going to
[1:15:53] expose that guy
[1:16:01] this will just apply to the ministering
[1:16:02] Brothers nobody else this will apply
[1:16:05] to Brothers if we ever set foot behind
[1:16:08] this pull pit with the intentions of
[1:16:10] exposing another
[1:16:12] Minister we're a Pharisee amen and we're
[1:16:16] on our way out
[1:16:19] amen am I wish I could tell you that
[1:16:22] I've never done that amen
[1:16:25] but I
[1:16:28] have in righteous
[1:16:31] indignation with the word of God and
[1:16:33] with
[1:16:34] quotes and in what I said I was right
[1:16:38] but the way I said it was
[1:16:41] wrong you say well we never know we
[1:16:43] never picked up on it it doesn't matter
[1:16:44] whether you did or whether you didn't I
[1:16:46] know
[1:16:51] here remember Saints the standard has
[1:16:53] been adjusted
[1:16:57] the standard has been
[1:16:59] adjusted the truth has been revealed as
[1:17:01] we would stand
[1:17:03] together only the truth can set us free
[1:17:06] but the truth can't set us
[1:17:08] free if we won't let it if we'll slam
[1:17:11] the door in its face and we say that
[1:17:13] don't apply to me or we whitewash a
[1:17:15] situation that we
[1:17:19] did I believe in my heart of hearts
[1:17:21] there's nobody in this building who's
[1:17:23] wanting to go out and live in sin and
[1:17:24] wanting to go out and live in dirt and
[1:17:26] smut and those things I believe
[1:17:29] that but remember that's not the level
[1:17:31] we're called to
[1:17:33] saints that is not the level we're
[1:17:35] called to we are called to be the very
[1:17:38] image of Jesus Christ on this
[1:17:41] Earth and that is going to require us to
[1:17:46] get real with God get real with
[1:17:48] ourselves first and realize that we've
[1:17:51] got some problems and that we are not
[1:17:53] okay yes even thinking you're okay is a
[1:17:56] problem because that is the
[1:18:03] problem we are going to have to a come
[1:18:06] to a real honest conference with
[1:18:09] ourselves and with
[1:18:11] God and search our lives and
[1:18:15] see as as the song says see if there be
[1:18:19] any wicked way in
[1:18:22] me and if there is
[1:18:25] reveal that to me that I can repent of
[1:18:28] that God forbid any of us would walk out
[1:18:31] of these doors and find ourselves in
[1:18:33] that leoan condition wretched blind
[1:18:37] naked that's bad but that's not the
[1:18:40] worst the worst is knoweth it
[1:18:43] not we have a
[1:18:46] word to
[1:18:49] know we have a word that can reveal to
[1:18:53] where we can truly know if we're right
[1:18:55] or
[1:18:56] not don't forsake
[1:18:59] it don't cover stuff
[1:19:03] up be real with God be real with
[1:19:08] yourself don't let his word return
[1:19:13] void he has cast it out on top of us
[1:19:16] over and over and
[1:19:19] over let it do its intended purpose it's
[1:19:23] going to hurt amen I'll tell you right
[1:19:26] now it's going to hurt it's not going to
[1:19:28] be pleasant it is not going to be
[1:19:34] fun but don't let this seventh Angel's
[1:19:37] message be in vain
[1:19:40] Saints look at just in that carnal realm
[1:19:43] look at the sacrifices that he had to go
[1:19:45] through just to tell us the
[1:19:50] truth don't let it be in
[1:19:53] vain
[1:19:55] brother brandom says we live in a free
[1:20:01] age there was a cost to this free
[1:20:09] age don't be unwilling to pay the
[1:20:13] cost we can quote that quote we're in a
[1:20:16] bright age we're in a free age praise
[1:20:18] God AR you am am I am I
[1:20:23] free yes hey am I free are you free
[1:20:28] let's just bow our heads please yes are
[1:20:31] we really or are we just saying that
[1:20:34] remember just because we say it doesn't
[1:20:36] make it
[1:20:38] so I'm not trying to play on your
[1:20:41] emotions here this evening we're going
[1:20:42] to close this service but we got to be
[1:20:45] real with ourselves Saints
[1:20:48] amen just because we're free of
[1:20:50] denominational churches are we
[1:20:53] free
[1:20:57] you say well I'm not what I used to be
[1:20:58] praise God i' never take that away from
[1:21:01] you don't don't back up on that but are
[1:21:03] you
[1:21:07] free there has been a free Age come the
[1:21:11] opportunity lays right before us not in
[1:21:15] theory but in manifestation and in
[1:21:17] reality but it is going to come with a
[1:21:21] cost and it has come with a cost a great
[1:21:25] cost not just in the seventh angel but
[1:21:29] all of the generations that have packed
[1:21:32] this message before
[1:21:35] us I don't want my daddy's
[1:21:40] sacrifices and my daddy's life to be in
[1:21:44] vain did he have everything right no he
[1:21:47] didn't have everything right but at
[1:21:49] least he told me God sent a prophet at
[1:21:51] least he preached the truth of that
[1:21:53] message yeah
[1:21:56] I don't want to throw his life away in
[1:21:58] vain we all have those people in our
[1:22:01] lives these Generations that have went
[1:22:03] before us not just brother Brandon but
[1:22:07] look how many generations have carried
[1:22:10] this since
[1:22:12] then for
[1:22:14] what you say well they just got little
[1:22:17] bits and little pieces okay that's
[1:22:20] fine but they did it so that we can come
[1:22:23] to the final closing moments of time and
[1:22:26] truly be
[1:22:33] free let's be real with ourselves let's
[1:22:36] be real with
[1:22:38] God we have a word with the
[1:22:43] power the spirit of Truth is
[1:22:49] come let's not let it be in
[1:22:53] vain
[1:22:59] one more statement and then we're going
[1:23:01] to close in the Book of Revelation
[1:23:03] chapter
[1:23:07] 1 verse one it says the revelation of
[1:23:11] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[1:23:13] show unto his servants things which must
[1:23:15] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[1:23:18] signified it by his Angel to his servant
[1:23:22] John we know through proper teaching
[1:23:24] that Jesus Christ himself gave this to
[1:23:27] brother brandom and he gave it to the
[1:23:30] bride that's how the Book of Revelation
[1:23:33] Begins the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:23:35] was given to the prophet and it was
[1:23:37] given to the bride verse
[1:23:40] 17 is what our reaction should
[1:23:44] be and when I saw
[1:23:48] him oh when I saw
[1:23:52] him I fell at his feet is
[1:23:57] dead saints of God if we have any other
[1:24:00] reaction or any other manifestation to
[1:24:02] this Jesus Christ that has
[1:24:05] come we're wrong there is only one
[1:24:09] appropriate reaction to this message
[1:24:12] that has come to this God that has come
[1:24:15] to this Jesus Christ that has come by my
[1:24:17] way and your way and that is to fall at
[1:24:20] its feet as
[1:24:23] dead let's pray together heavenly father
[1:24:26] I
[1:24:28] pray Lord that you would help us me

[1:24:46] partiality not with a little bit of my
[1:24:48] life left Lord but to react the
[1:24:52] scriptural way that John did the bride

[1:25:02] myself at your feet
