========================================

I do a little exercise sometimes when I have a a young couple ready to get married and they're sitting in my office we're talking and I say listen and I I start to I start to uh make some phrases I say okay let's say this young man looks at you and he says you know what you are so precious and dear to me I love you I love everything about you when you walk by my heart skips a beat I can't stop thinking about you and you're the sweetest thing God ever made and I asked a sister I said does that kind of talk feel good she said oh yeah that feels good then I say I go to the young man I say okay now the sister looks at you and says you are such a sweetie you're a sweetie pie you're so gentle and sweet and tender and everything about you I told the brother I said it I mean it's not bad I mean it's not bad it's okay but what if she looks at you and says you know what I really respect you for the kind of man you are I look up to you and admire you for the standard taking the life that you live and and I could place myself under your headship because I respect and honor you now you guys tell me which one do you want to hear on a regular basis do you want to be the sweetest guy at work you're in the weld shop and all the other welders look at you and says he is the sweetest guy in this show it doesn't move the men it doesn't because that's not the way they're made that's not their position there's nothing wrong with being sweet and if your wife looks at you and say you're being so sweet that feels good too but that I mean that can't be all there is to it amen there's got to be some more but when your wife looks at you and says you know I really respect you for what you just did I'm telling you you're going to make a man out of that man by the way you speak to him and if you want a man to be your Defender and your protector and stand on the front line and shield you from Darth you keep talking to that man that way and that man will go slay a dragon for you is that right he'll give his whole life to you why because that's what God called him for and if you love him that way you Empower him to be what God called him to be but if you look at your wife and say you know I really respect the way you work around here you put in a good day's work like a man you're not lounging around you something about is not working and if you're just now realizing today that that's not good Take Your Wife by the hand and come see me we'll make an appointment because we have to respect the nature that God made in each one and we have to know what God's wanting to do through the man and what God's doing to the woman and when we understand that and Empower that and respect that then all of a sudden you have a marriage that moves into harmony into unity and everything's operating the way God wants it to operate and we begin to move forward that way and so if we can get this verse right in our homes then a man love his wife even as himself and see that the wife reverends her husband you're going to have success after success in every trouble do this in every difficulty do this every day do this and you're going to have a successful marriage it will work because that's the way God intended for it to work
