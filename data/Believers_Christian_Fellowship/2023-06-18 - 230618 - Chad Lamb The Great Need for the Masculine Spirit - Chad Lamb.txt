you take the preeminence that we give to you may you instruct your children we love you father and we ask your blessing over the preaching of the word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you we're going to ask you to take a seat just for a moment let's start off by saying Happy Father's Day God bless all the fathers that are here and amen we appreciate you and the sacrifices you make and and the leadership that you give and uh I'm so thankful that we have a Heavenly Father amen who takes responsibility for us and Leadership for us and is set an example for us Earthly fathers to look after to take as our example amen I want to start off with an announcement we had a surprise Joseph and Rebecca Benjamin had their baby already come about a month early I think we've got a picture that we can pull up here yeah Jonathan Jason Benjamin he was born Friday about a month early so praise God they're excited he's doing well he was born just a little bit early and they had to check him out make sure his lungs are developed but he's doing good so just be praying that they all can go home soon and uh pray that we can get they can get down here so we can see this little guy here soon so that was quite a good surprise amen [Music] thank you so we thank God for that amen Lord has certainly been good and gracious and his gifts are wonderful amen I also want to say thank you to the trustees they were out here yesterday had a little bit of a work day with the trustees and a few of the young men and you'll see we have no front road sign because well you may not have noticed if you didn't notice I'm letting you know now they tore it out in preparation to set the new one and that should be done here in a couple weeks we're going to pour some concrete coming up this week and they also all along this front edge they cleaned up that flower bed and redid it and I just want to give a big thanks to the trustees and those that helped them and then they're always doing something amen and sometimes it's notice and sometimes it's unnoticed but they're always working they're always taking care of things and I really appreciate that it means a lot and they're always looking out for the best interest of all of us so we're thankful for that God bless you let's stand together and go to the Book of Genesis chapter one then there's a scripture that I read so often sometimes I get embarrassed I'm going to read it again at the beginning of service but sometimes you just can't help it I don't know so I just ask you to bear with me amen we probably we probably should just put down our Bibles and try to quote it by heart we probably could do it but but let's just start here in Genesis chapter 1 verse 26. and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth give me all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God bless you as you take your seeds praise the Lord this morning I'd like to preach on the subject the great need for the masculine spirit the great need for the masculine spirit brother bam says in the message marriage of the Lamb he says do you ever read in the scripture how the first man God made was a dual person Adam was both Adam and Eve spiritually speaking but when he made the first man in his own image and God is a spirit but when he put them in flesh he separated them he'd taken the masculine spirit and put into man and taken the feminist spirit and put it into a woman so we realized that man was made in God's Own image and he was made male and female amen so there's a masculine and a feminist part all of that was together and Adam when Adam was made in God's image we know originally in spirit form then in flesh form then from the singular flesh form amen he he split a rim took a rib off of Adam split the spirit between maskin and feminist put it in the woman and put them back together as one and so that was God's handiwork that was God's Great Masterpiece and so we see now when God split the masculine from the feminist Spirit now he made a division and he and he made the masculine one way in the feminist another way and he didn't he didn't have them together any longer he had them separated and one was in what they call a woman and the others was called man and now in order to put these together you must unite the two together in marriage as one amen is that right so God made a distinction and a separation and he separated and whenever God does something that's the way he wants it so God's divided out the masculine and the feminist and he wants it separated he doesn't want it together in one vessel anymore so the only way to have masculine and feminist is to bring them together in holy Union you can no longer mix them together in one vessel any mixing in one vessel is now perversion because God separated it amen so now we see the whole fallacy of the homosexual movement and all these things is because it is contrary to the very nature of God and the Very work that God did and what he wants and how he wants to display himself in this day amen a month ago at Mother's Day we preached on the feminine attribute and the Great Value in the feminine attribute and now we want to look at the other sign the great need for the masculine spirit because really when when it comes down to it you cannot you cannot have one without the other and stay correct in your vision and understanding of God we cannot have just a feminine attribute and allow that to to be everything but then we have an unbalanced view of God Amen neither can we go to the masculine side and ignore the feminine side we once again will have an unbalanced view but these two things must be working and and and and Unison together to display the actual picture that God wants us to see in this day to display the very nature of God it must come together with masculine and feminist amen and so brother Ram says here uh when Adam looked Lonesome so he took a rib from his side and made Eve a byproduct for him he'd taken the feminist Spirit out of Adam and put it in the woman he the love Spirit feminist kind gentle and he left the masculine spear in Adam now if there's anything different there's a perversion somewhere and and then they too was one so now how did God put him back together he put him back together through marriage that's the only way God puts them back together all right we understand God sets principles down and when we stick with those principles they work they bring Health they bring security amen they bring the image of God they bring the word of God the minute we start mixing these things and get off of what God designed we bring death amen we bring destruction we bring insecurity we bring all kinds of problems amen uh I'm just going to read a few quotes here together where brother bam starts talking about the male and the female the masculine feminist is to see some of the the descriptions that he put first of all we'll go to this quote and Satan's in he said God made a man of man he made a woman a woman and he dressed him different and he meant for them to stay that way and to act that way one is finished the other is masculine and he separated Adam in the Garden of Eden and did this separated Eve from him and God wants him to stay that way that's God's desire you go to Deuteronomy 22 this is a scripture that he just referred to there but I'd like to read it together Deuteronomy 22 and verse 5 Deuteronomy 22 and verse 5. in Deuteronomy 22 5 he says the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are Abomination unto the Lord thy God God wanted not just a separation in vessels but he wanted a clear distinction even in the way they were dressed that's why it's wrong for a woman to wear pants it's wrong for a man to wear a dress and it used to be that used to be intuitive everybody used to understand that you used to say and even now we live in a conservative area in the United States and in most circles you say it's wrong for a man to wear a dress and most people are like yeah obviously but then you say it's wrong for a woman to wear a pants no no that's fine no if it's wrong for what why is it wrong for one and not for the other but the world has become so perverted you say it's wrong for men to wear a dress and somebody will say well what's wrong with that we've gotten so far away from the image of God Amen and you say how did this happen how did we get to this place it's because the feminist movement and the feminist agenda has neutered the masculine Spirit as neutered men and when you neuter men and you quiet men and you move it all to the feminine attribute amen now all of a sudden you've got chaos breaking out everywhere because what you've done is devalued the masculine spirit that masculine spirit is there for protection for authority and it's needful but as soon as we go and and as soon as we begin to to make men feel guilty for being authoritative then we're wrong make men feel guilty for being leaders we're wrong because that's what God's called them to do brother man says in the message Shalom he says no more than see the young man out there find big fine-built fella with his hair what he curl it up like a woman and do and leotards on and big long sweater hanging down and purple shoes on masculine oh my what a horrible thing to call a man what a thing to call a man that's right see some woman supposed to be daintish lovely come out with a pair of men's trousers on a cigarette in her mouth and bobbed hair what a thing to call a woman remember he's laying it straight because the culture he was in the beatnik movement was moving in and that's how they were dressing with these like tight pants leggings and these long sweaters and the bangs hanging in their face amen and all that that came through the 60s through the Beatles and that whole beatnik movement and brother Branham is man enough to say it's wrong and I'm glad he did I'm not I'm not offended that he said that's wrong why because it's mixing and blending what God didn't want mixed amen he wanted separate vessel for masculine a separate vessel for feminine want them to express masculine and feminine and the only time they're to come together is through marriage not mixed in one vessel again again in the message Shalom he says there seems to be something among men don't seem to be have that masculine touch that he used to have women don't have that feminist touch she used to have you take man today man don't seem to be Burly like they used to be it's all some sort of they want to wear suede shoes with purple and they want to act like women now that is true it seems to be more or less like a perversion a woman wants to cut off her hair and act like a man and a man wants to act like a woman and yet you can talk to them and they're nice people to talk to nice people friendly sociable people what caused this it's that gross Darkness upon the people it's something that's pressed them into it so brother man once again he starts saying a man that wants to wear suede shoes with purple and you begin to say well I can wear any shoes I want and be a man this is what the prophet of God's telling us because you realize amen there's been a feminization of the world and certainly of our culture in America and the fashion has followed suits amen where they make men look feminine where they make men I mean they do these silly things with they slim down their pants so their little pencil legs and then they take and now they cut the shirts different from in than they used to cut them and now they cut them down tight to where it looks like they have a waist and then they they lay their pants low on their hips and and they're actually changing the way men's clothes are even made and making them look feminine to where if you're not careful and you and you begin to take a fashion and you begin to take fashion statements and fashion trends and just accept everything that's hanging on the rack in the store you don't realize what Spirit created those clothes you said I can wear any color I want and be a man go ahead go ahead but God wants a separation God wants a clear separation amen I wear any shoes I want my brother man was pointing to the shoes he's pointing to the clothes he's pointing to the hair styles I mean since when did Men stop cutting their hair like men amen now a man wants to go to a fashion salon and get his hair done up I don't mean you've been here my goodness but we're talking about the culture my hair is pretty good I don't have to worry about slipping into kind of the wrong thing there but you see it all matters because there's Spirits Behind these things it's a culture that's pressing in and creating chaos in the world that's all around us I thank God I thank God that there's men that'll still put on a suit and tie and come to church regardless of what the fashion trends are and regardless of what's going on they'll show their respect to God and say I'm going to hear the word of God and I'm going to address myself in a way that's appropriate and masculine and go face my God and hear his word remember the word is a person we're not coming here to hear a lecture and hear a speech amen we're coming to hear the word of God through the method that God has laid down for us in this day and when coming so we're coming to meet God it's still worth getting dressed up for it's still an event worth putting on our best amen it's still worth coming like a lady and coming like a man to present ourselves to the Lord amen doesn't mean you have to wear certain that's not what we're saying we should just take effort to present ourselves to God nobody's going to chastise you if you don't wear a tie to church that's not the point the point is that we care that we're coming ready diligent respectful honoring God honoring his word these things matter friends we can say they don't matter but they do matter we can act like they don't and we can be come like a church that anything goes and everything's easy and everything's fine and God loves you and God loves everything you do and you come any way you want and you just come and you sing a nice song to God and accept it that's not the case that's the modern idea of worshiping God Amen but but just because that's the way you want to worship God doesn't mean that's the way God wants to be worshiped amen amen brother member says when you see a man acts like a there's something wrong when you see a woman that wants to act like a man there's something wrong see there's something wrong they are two different Spirits all together but together they make one unit these two are one when God made a man first he made him both male and female in spirit he made him in his own image and God is a spirit when he separated him and put him in flesh he put the masculine Spirit on a man in the feminist spirit and a woman and if anything's contrary to that there's a bit of perversion there exactly you see a woman trying to act like a man there's a little something wrong there the cells crossed up somewhere that's right you see a man so sisified that he won't preach against sin or nothing else like that to hurt somebody's feelings there's a cross up there somewhere too not only is natural birth but a spiritual birth oh we need today is that a man be a man a woman a lady God intend them to be that way dressed different he says you say you're hammering on us women now I'm going to tell you about the man any man that will let his wife smoke cigarettes and wear them shorts and act like that there's very little man in him to my opinion that's right I've got my opinion of a man that'll let his wife do that I sure have well he just told us his opinion and he wasn't afraid to because brother Venom was a man he was masculine he was a man he was authoritative he could speak his mind he told you what his convictions were he wasn't always waffling and and in the middle of the road and sparing everybody's feelings he was a man he was a man's man and we responded to that it drew us it called us it captivated us amen but I want you to see what brother Brown's looking at as a man I mean being a man is not just taking a gun and shooting game and going and eating raw meat in the wilderness that's not what he's talking about he's not talking about things that a man can be soft he doesn't have to be hard a man amen a man a man can work in business and be a man or he can be a lumberjack and be a man and they can have the same quality of manhood that's what we're talking about but brother Ben's talking about a man who will take responsibility and Authority for his household and stand and not allow sin to come in and brother bear said a man that will let his wife do this and a man that will let his wife do that I've gotta I I have not got too much of opinion of that man why it doesn't matter what his occupation is it doesn't matter what his hobbies are that's not what we're looking at as masculinity that's not what we're looking at as manhood we're looking at a man that will take his god-given position as the authority and ruler over the woman and not give it up and not be passive about it he said there's very little man in him to my opinion he said well what's the matter you say well brother Madam here's what it is man is not measured by strength this way oh you say that guy's a man he's six foot tall got muscles that big I've seen many of them weigh 200 pounds six foot and a half tall and not one ounce of man in them throw a baby out of a mother's arms and ravish her man's not measured that's Brute that's brute strength as man's measured by character there never was a man like Jesus Christ never measured up to him and the Bible said there's no Beauty we should desire him didn't look like a king he was a little bitty fellow probably stoop little small and stature but there never was a man like him man is measured by character not by brutal strength [Music] you don't have to be mean and arrogant and harsh and Brash to be a man but you are going to have to stand and when nobody else stands and you're going to have to be straight and you're going to have to be firm and you're going to have to have a backbone to be a man you don't have to be loud you don't have to be aggressive but you must be authoritative you must be firm in your convictions you must be honest in your approach you must not be wishy-washy this is what the prophet lays out for us men will get into sports to feel like a man and won't rule their own house and turn that over to their wife and there's no man in that man you can dunk a basketball run the 40-yard dash faster than anybody he can he can do more than any other man do it longer do it harder do it faster and he's not even a man because he's not in his position as a man he's letting his wife take that position and now he's not a man he's male not a man sometimes the truth is just the truth it's not always Pleasant it's not always feeling good but it's just the truth when we go back to Genesis chapter 3 well find where God lays this out Genesis chapter 3 verse 16. and he says here unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply and thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee this was the order that God set down this is the pattern that God fixed and this is the one that God wants he wanted the masculine Spirit to rule over the feminist spirit and that was for protection because God when he separated them out he separated the masculine from the feminist he knew in the way that he was created being a byproduct amen that there was a susceptibility there and he allowed it to go because then there was a fall and it gave God the opportunity to express all of his attributes but after that fall he took that feminist nature that had been separated out and placed it under the rulership of the male of the masculine and he said he shall have rule over thee and that's the way God wants it to this day it may have been approximately six thousand years since he said this but that's still how he wants it to be that's still how the role should be played brother random said and some of you men will get that Wishbone out of you and get a real and get a real be a man Backbone in you say God help me and make your wife straighten up spank that little daughter of yours running around there on the street and some man insult her and then you go around and want to have the man arrested you ought to have a whipping you're the guy you brother that's right you're the one you ought to be the ruler of your house God's holding you responsible the way you're letting that girl do let her come in of a nighttime her hair all must up in a cigarette and pain all over her face I got two I don't know what they'll do but one thing brother as long as I got life and a barrel slots laying close I'll do my part I love reading these quotes because if I say those things it's like ah brother Chad's being harmed today no I'm just reading what the prophet said amen but what brother man was saying is he said you're the man be a man have a backbone you make things right you stand in the game you be the Watchman on the wall you make sure the house is lined up don't leave that to other people and don't turn that over to your woman and don't turn your wife and don't turn it over to your children you take position that's what it is to be a man that's what he's talking about be Burly he's not talking about you know grow out a great big beard and let your hair go and beeper he's talking about have some grit about you when it comes to leadership amen you know why because not everybody's going to agree with every decision you make and not every decision you make will be right either we just lay that out here right from the beginning just because you're masculine doesn't mean you're right amen all of us men will make a heap of mistakes and that's why I mean Jesus Christ is perfect amen God is perfect he's perfect in every way but we're not and so to take our positions sometimes we'll get it right sometimes we'll get it wrong and it's going to require a whole lot of humility to stand in your place when you failed to be able to come back and say that was me I was wrong I made the wrong decision there I shouldn't have done that amen that's what it's going to require as long as we live in flesh but just because you've made a heap of mistakes amen does not take away your responsibility to be the ruler it's almost like three strikes you're out turn it over to the woman that doesn't work that will never work it can never be that way and be God's way it must be we must have the humility as brothers as men amen the backbone in ourselves to say I was wrong I thought that was right wrong decision poor decision that was a selfish move I'm sorry for saying that I'm sorry for do that that was too rough that was too this we need to come back to our families we need to come back and say I was wrong I was wrong and there's nothing wrong with saying I was wrong amen but don't ever let that cause you to lose your position because the minute you do you subject the whole household amen and you open the door and open the gate for troubles to begin let's go to First Peter chapter three First Peter chapter 3. praise God First Peter chapter 3 verse 1. likewise your wives be in subjection to your own husbands to have any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wise while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear amen how was the woman supposed to save her unbelieving husband by a tongue lashing by preaching to him by telling them how wrong he is with her chaste conversation coupled with fear that word fear is reverence it's her Chastity her chaste lifestyle coupled with her reverence for God in reverence her husband that might win her husband not when she becomes spiritually dominant because she's spiritual and he's not that'll not work not because she preaches at him because she's spiritual and he's not that won't work either how can she win the unbelieving Heaven by her chaste conversation that's her lifestyle coupled with her fear her reverence her respect that's how she'll do it if everybody stays in their Lane it works when we start getting out of our lane then we start bringing chaos and things begin to fall apart but if we stay in our lanes no matter where we are God will bless it and it begins to have the affected result it goes on in verse three who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting of the hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God Adorn themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife is unto the weaker vessel and is being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered this way of always keeping everything in balance through the masculine the feminist he sits here and he begins through Peter he begins to lay down that a woman is to be subjected to her husband like the Holy Women of old were subjected to their husband amen and and and how to do that and he begins to tell them but then he turns right around he comes to the man he says now dwell with your wives according to knowledge you need to understand she's different than you and respect the feminine nature in her he says he says it this way you need to dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and being heirs together the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered you need so badly to understand this and get this that it doesn't hinder your prayer life and that God can continue to answer your prayers why because the woman is the weaker vessel is not the less valuable vessel the woman is the weaker vessel is the one that's more fragile more tender more gentle and she needs shelter and she needs care she needs a man to dwell with her according to knowledge and give honor to her as a weaker vessel amen that's part of leadership that's part of being a ruler So Gone amen he never comes along and says you be subject you be subject you be subject amen and the man can just act anyway once he turns right around and says now you dwell with her according to knowledge and give honor as a weaker vessel that your prayers aren't hindered amen because any time we remove one of these attributes we're starting to blur the image of God anytime we disrespect the feminine attribute we blur the image of God we disrespect the masculine we blur the image of God these two must be here in their positions in their place working in Harmony and unity to display what God wants displayed in this hour amen the world needs men let's go to Ephesians chapter 5. Ephesians chapter 5. and we'll go to verse 21. submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves into your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is head of the wife even as Christ is head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject into Christ so let wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it you see God bring the balance between the two attributes once again there's no way around it the man must rule his home no question without questioning I know none of you have that question because we have Godly sisters and godly brothers who believe the word of God but just rehearsing that there must be the masculine Spirit there must be the masculine nature and he must take dominion and rulership over his home because that's what it means when God told the man or told the woman The man shall rule over you it means to have dominion or rulership and so man must take that but he also must love his wife as Christ loved the church so how should I love my wife the same way Christ loved the church how did Christ love the church he gave himself for it Christ did not become effeminate for his wife he didn't become overly emotional and he didn't go to his wife and say now okay I understand that that this is hard for you we're just going to change this Rule and go with your emotions and this is no he stayed true to the word of God in all ways amen but he gave himself to shelter and protect his wife amen amen and loved her as his own body because that's what she is amen many times when I do pre-marital counseling with those who are going to get married I go to this and I go to verse Ephesians 5 32 let's skip over to 32. and I and I want to go through this because I want to show some of the things that I do when I begin to teach them in verse 32 it says this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverends her husband when I get down to this scripture I tell them many times I said if there's one thing you get out of our talks here today when we meet together before you're married there's one scripture you remember if there's one verse you put on your refrigerator to have a successful marriage it'll be verse 33. And if every married couple of every family can operate in verse 33 there will never be a problem because it's the key it says nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself you love her and prefer her and care for her and be tender with her amen love her and the wife see that she reverence our respects and honors her husband why is this key because this is the way God set it up and this is the way that it actually works I do a little exercise sometimes when I have a a young couple ready to get married and they're sitting in my office we're talking and I say listen and I I start to I start to uh make some phrases I say okay let's say this young man looks at you and he says you know what you are so precious and dear to me I love you I love everything about you when you walk by my heart skips a beat I can't stop thinking about you and you're the sweetest thing God ever made and I asked the sister I said does that kind of talk feel good she said oh yeah that feels good then I say I go to the young man I say okay now this sister looks at you and says you are such a sweetie you're a sweetie pie you're so gentle and sweet and tender and everything about you I told the brother I said I mean it's not bad I mean it's not bad it's okay but what if she looks at you and says you know what I really respect you for the kind of man you are I look up to you and admire you for the standard taken the life that you live and and I could place myself under your headship because I respect and honor you now you guys tell me which one do you want to hear on a regular basis do you want to be the sweetest guy at work you're in the weld shop and all the other welders look at you and says he is the sweetest guy in this show it doesn't move the men it doesn't move because that's not the way they're made that's not their position there's nothing wrong with being sweet and if your wife looks at you and say you're being so sweet that feels good too but that I mean that can't be all there is to it amen there's got to be some more but when your wife looks at you and says you know I really respect you for what you just did I'm telling you you're going to make a man out of that man by the way you speak to him and if you want a man to be your Defender and your protector and stand on the front line and shield you from dark you keep talking to that man that way and that man will go slay a dragon for you is that right he'll give his whole life to you why because that's what God called him for and if you love him that way you Empower him to be what God called him to be but if you look at your wife and say you know I really respect the way you work around here you put in a good day's work like a man you're not lounging around something about is not working and if you're just now realizing today that that's not good Take Your Wife by the hand and come see me we'll make an appointment because we have to respect the nature that God made in each one amen and we have to know what God's wanting to do through the man and what God's doing to the woman and when we understand that and Empower that and respect that then all of a sudden you have a marriage that moves into harmony into unity and everything's operating the way God wants it to operate and we begin to move forward that way and so if we can get this verse right in our homes then a man love his wife even as himself and see that the wife reverends her husband you're going to have success after success in every trouble do this in every difficulty do this every day do this and you're going to have a successful marriage it will work because that's the way God intended for it to work amen but see what happens in our culture the culture now has feminized men and the culture has made masculinity negative or they've made masculinity brutality they've done one or the other they've made it brutality or they they've made it uh they made it brutal or cruel and now you're not supposed to be a man and stand for convictions and take leadership and tell your wife no and tell your children no and say stop that you're not allowed to do that I I'm not allowing this in my home and all of a sudden the culture all of a sudden flares up and says what gives you the right to say that and I say God gives me the right to say that not just the right but the responsibility and I'll answer to God if I don't take my position it's not an ego trip it's a fear of God it's a respect and reverence for God my goodness where is the man where are the men that can be men where are the men that can go to work you go to work and you have a discussion and now the men have to talk like women because of feelings and and there's women mixed into the workplace and now you get into a work setting and the men have to be so careful and you know you got to phrase it this way and be respectful and we have equality and inclusion and diversity and all of these things and you have to watch your speech and nobody can be wrong and no idea is stupid and the way it used to work with men is they could go to work and somebody says I think I'm going to change this chain around this log and you say if you do that you'll be dead that's a stupid idea and the man says what do you mean it makes sense to me and you say no knucklehead look at this and they battle it out and come together and at the end they're like oh yeah you're right or I see what you know okay all right thanks and they take it and they do it and they why they're men now men sit around in the room what do you think well what do you think well what do you think well I think well let's go with what you think so that I don't hurt your feelings yes sir that's how we get into a world that's so upside down and backwards it's so crazy amen you you've heard in the news what the schools are dealing with we talked about it for dealing with boys wanting to go in the girls bathrooms girls in the boys bathrooms they're wanting to put litter boxes into the bathroom because they want to be dogs and they want to be cats and the school board having special meetings to try to figure out how to handle this I'll tell you to handle this they need one man to stand up in that school board and said this is ridiculous we educate human beings that were born male or female if you want to go home and you want to use a litter box have at it if you want to go home and dress like a girl have at it but when you come through those doors we've got rules here and for the sake of everybody else a boy that's born a boy is a boy a girl that's born a girl is a girl and you're not a dog or a cat you don't even belong in school you need to go to obedience class if we would have men who would be men I mean they might get voted off for the next school board but everybody in that room would know he's right and they're wrong but instead of that they have to say well I think the general feeling is and the parents have told me why the culture has become feminine and the only expression of masculinity is now in brutality and they wonder why boys are blowing stuff up on video games why they're shooting stuff up and blowing stuff up with War Games what's the attraction because they're still Male inside and you're forcing them to act like a girl it's not working we need men who will be men we need women who will be ladies and the whole thing if we respect one another in reverence one another in their position it will work there is no problem in schools when men were in charge but most of the schools now are run by women most of the teachers became women it began to change right and they become feminine and now nobody can stand up and say what's right is right what's wrong is wrong I may be on the school board one day but if I was there one day somebody would know what was right and what was wrong [Music] and I wouldn't be mean about it that's not manhood you don't have to be rough you have to be truthful and honest we had a prophet in our day who said some rough things and I'm not ashamed of those rough things some people are ashamed of them and tried to overlook them and say well he had a in his childhood if you understood how he grew up and his dad drinking and listen he went through what God wanted him to go through to get trained the way God wanted me to be trained God was with him in his temperament because there's a certain way the gospel had to be preached in this generation to call for a certain people [Music] and brother Branham said and he's preaching in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says now real quietly I'm going to ask consecrated men and women who really know God most of them it's very strange it seems like it's that way altar calls that I make is mostly men he mentioned this is a couple places in the message you know in the regular run it's women but it's all men here I think there's one woman at the altar maybe two It's usually the women and brother bear mentions this in another place or two one or two other places that it seems like at his altar calls it's mostly men and even goes on to say I think the women think I'm a little rough on them or a little against them but in my opinion I don't think that was it at all I think the men could respond to its preaching I think his preaching may have been a little straight it may have been a little cutting it may have been firm amen but that was a message I could respond to I listened all my life to a feminine message I listened to all my be nice be sweet be kind don't say nothing bad be good to this and do this and do all that and as a boy amen there is nothing there was no attraction I wanted to serve God absolutely wanted to be a Christian wanted to serve God but there was no attraction to that kind of gospel because there was nothing being preached that was drawing me into my position as a man but when brother Branham priests all of a sudden and what is he doing it's like he's taking a hickory switch and switching the entire generation and switching all the Pentecostals and all of a sudden the men under that kind of talking Straight Talk amen under honest honest conviction honest true manhood amen the men could respond to that kind of preaching he said in my meetings it's mostly men well I say praise God because if you get the man right and in his position it'll bless the whole home that's why God made him in such a way amen because because that nature must be displayed and that nature it was drawing men it was pulling preachers back out of denomination it was bringing people out of systems and out of this whole thing that's moving feminine amen and it becomes so dangerous in the Book of Job I'm just going to read this to you quickly Job 38 go going through all of his trials and he's got all this hardship and and all these things have happened to him and then all of it his three friends come and and they're accusing him the fourth one Ellie who was in the place of God he begins to correct him then after that says then the Lord answered job out of a whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge gird up now thy loins like a man for I will demand a thee and answer thou me what did God say he told job I'm going to talk to you like a man gird up your loins get up get dressed I'm going to talk to you and I'm going to demand of you an answer and he begins I love the way God talks to him he says where was thou when I laid the foundation of the Earth you're here groveling you're here whining amen you're here thinking you know something amen but listen I'm gonna you you gird up your loins like a man I'm coming down to talk to you like a man and you answer me where were you when we drew the foundation where where were you what have you done who Do You Think You Are oh praise the Lord something in me says that's right that's right when the angel Lord comes to Zach Zacchaeus not Zacchaeus Zacharias in Elizabeth Zacharias was in the temple and and the angel comes and presents himself it's time for the promise to be fulfilled and he questions how could this be well he's a man and he's a priest and he's got a Bible example so what is God what does the angel said to you because you doubted you'll not speak until the baby's born I mean really that's harsh but he should have known better he comes to Mary now the same Angel comes to Mary and Mary does the same thing how can this be sing I know no man but she's a woman she's not a priest she doesn't have authority she's of a different nature and there's no example in the Bible and he never smites her dumb never punishes or never does anything just goes ahead and answers her question you don't deal with men and women the same you don't raise boys and girls the same me and the boys were one day sitting down trying to figure out how to do something I don't know what it was it could have been anything from throw a ball to build a deck but we're hashing it out this long and this this and that and these material and all that I don't remember what it was but we're hashing it out and we're going at the table back and forth back and forth and my wife goes why are you guys arguing and we all stopped and we're like we're not arguing no we're fine I'd never catch her and the girls talking that way the conversation would be completely different it's a different nature that's why in the home you must have a father and a mother both in position with the freedom to express their nature we start to distort that and things start to get ah they start to fall out of place God can come down to his son job and said gird thy loins like a man I'm going to talk to you what was he doing God was bringing job back into a position of respect and God was about to take his position and keep job in his position and did job respond well to that yes he said I spoke once I'll never speak again I open my mouth twice I'll put my hand over my mouth lest I speak again for now I know I'm just a man and you're a God God put him in his position and it was good for job when we paint the picture like if we make God like we make the modern Church or like the modern man just sweet and just gentle and he's syrupy sweet and sugar and he he's this and he's that and he loves you so much and never but God can come to you anytime and say Gert your loins like a man I'm going to ask you some questions who Do You Think You Are talking to me like that this is where the modern church has failed that's why they don't have men in leadership anymore that's why when their boys get to be 13 14 they take off they're gone because they're preached a feminist message they're preached a feminine Christ only not balanced but just one-sided I'm so glad God sent a man to be the prophet in this day he could draw masculinity back in place and in that man who is so Burly and so strong with his conviction is so honest and straight was super tender with sisters very respectful and a gentleman at all times you don't have to be rough you certainly shouldn't be rough with women or children to be a man but you've got to take your position I remember I mean there's times sometimes I have old terms I picked up I don't know for my dad or where but every once in a while sometimes you just have to Rack somebody's Jaws you know I mean that may sound rough but my dad did it to me my dad would say boy what do you think you're doing no you're not doing that that's that's crazy and he'll say stuff like Over My Dead Body you'll never do that and you know what I stand here today and thank God for a dad who wouldn't be wishy-washy with me but would be honest with me and I look back and he was right I was about to do something very very foolish at the time I didn't know it I thought my dad was just rough and half blind and didn't understand nothing and I look back and he was dead on the money I could respond to that and something in me knew not to push against that now on mom the other hand mom would say no I don't think so but Mom Mom I really want to Mom all the other guys are doing it and all of a sudden Mom's heart is beginning to melt Mom I'm the only one oh my goodness now she's almost caved in my my little boy is going to be made fun of his feelings are going to be heard he's going to feel like he's different than all the other little boys and that boy will push moan and what is he doing he's he's manipulating her emotions he doesn't may not understand that but he's manipulating her emotions amen and if she's not careful she's going to get hooked in emotionally and this boy's going to run the show amen and now amen she's going to agree to something at first she did not want to agree to and didn't feel comfortable agreeing to and that's where it's nice when Mom can say I see what you're saying honey go ask your dad and dad says what planet did you just show up from there's no way that's ever going to work in a million years and you know what that young man can respond to that and know not to push anymore and stop right there and say that's it that's final why can't he with Mom but why can't he with Dad because it's a masculine Spirit speaking to a masculine spirit and what's happening is he's drawing masculinity out of that boy by the way he talks to him to others it may look rough it may look why it should be but what he's doing is he's drawing a boy to come back into respect and a boy can respect respect he can understand reverence and respect in manhood amen and when a man will speak to his son not mean not calling him names not not any of that but say there ain't no way that's not a good idea and this is not going to happen and I'm not going to allow it and I don't stand for that amen and when that boy all of a sudden he can respect that and you're drawing masculinity out of a boy that's why it's good to have a father a Godly Daddy who will take his position and stand and represent that nature of God to you and it's good to have a mother who'll stay in her position and represent that nature of God because we need both I remember one of our boys I'm telling all now this is a book I mean sorry kids I love you all it's Father's Day you have to forgive me and love me anyhow it'd be nice I already got my Father's Day present so I can say whatever I want now so but when a boy gets to be a certain age he starts to this is naturally creeping up in him especially if he's had Godly examples and he'll start to test his authority with his mother that's normal don't lose your mind that's normal he'll start to contradict her he'll start to correct her and tell her where she's wrong especially when it comes to driving or fixing things and all of a sudden mom doesn't know anything about cars nothing about driving what she never claimed to but all sudden he starts to usurp a bit of authority he tries to correct and he tries to tell her what's right and and mom's gonna have to endure that because she wants him to be a little man and a father of a household she can't Crush that if she crushes that then you got a female Spirit dominating that little male Spirit that's trying to express you got to let it express a little bit but that's where Dad has to take control not Mom Dad and we had a situation in our house where one of the boys I won't tell you which one I won't call names but it was the oldest one and they were and he come into this position now where he's just challenging challenging challenging not in a bad way and not horrible but challenging and and the challenge sometimes with borderline on disrespect there's times it could be disrespectful and that's where I come to him I say listen that woman you're talking to is your mother but she's not just your mother she's my wife and I will not let any man on this planet speak to my wife in a disrespectful way and if you dishonor your mother you have me to deal with you know what there's no problem then the problem went away why because now I drew out of him masculinity I didn't say you stopped being so rough you'd be a sweet boy and listen to your mom she could sweeten you up and really teach you how to be tenderhearted that boy's going to be like my goodness can't wait till I'm 18. true mom can't do that Dad can if Mom does it she's hurting masculinity if Dad does it he's drawing masculinity because he's he's putting the household back in respect because now it's not about Mom it's about Dad and Dad's value for Mom and I won't cross that line why because this is God's picture that's why it works it works every time we must keep our homes in order we must we must operate the way God designed it for the benefit and those kids who grew up there hey you know what and that Dad better never talk to his daughter like that takes a different approach amen but if that father is If he if he honors his wife as the weaker vessel then he'll honor his daughter as a weaker vessel and he begins more tender with her and explains things the shelters and protects her and says don't worry Daddy will take care of it I'm watching over it you're going to train up a girl that is comfortable under male Authority if you're harsh and dominant and critical and you talk to her like you talk to another man you're going to have a woman that recoils from male Authority but if you handle or like you're supposed to handle your wife amen then all of a sudden she will grow up understanding male Authority and be comfortable under that and your men will be brought into a level of respect where they understand masculinity and they will be fathers in their homes you have fathers and mothers now working in harmony that's why I thank God for this message look at what it has done look around and look at what it has done for us the world's in absolute chaos and doesn't understand even where they're at they don't know what their gender is they don't know what the roles are they don't know who's allowed to do what amen look around and see Godly men Godly fathers Godly mothers boys who are acting like boys and girls who act like little ladies how is that happening it's happening because the word has been put in position the word is the headship the word is the male and we as a bride have come under that headship and lined up and respected the word and the word is put dad in place in the words put Mom in place and the word is put the house in place and the word is put the church in place amen it's not magic amen it's not a certain personality it's not any of this what's happening is the word amen is put in respect and honor and puts everything in order amen women thrive on love men thrive on respect and honor amen goddess super good sometimes I just don't know where to go I'm not where I plan to be and I don't know where to go let's look at let's look at Second Kings second Kings chapter 2 verse 23. second Kings chapter 2 verse 23. this is when we get down to verse or the first part of chapter two is when Elijah's caught up in a whirlwind of fire the mantle falls on Elisha Elisha begins to move out into his ministry in verse 23 it says and he went up from thence unto Bethel and as he was going up by that way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the Lord and there came forth two she Bears out of the wood and tear 40 and two children to them brother man refers to the story many times and he talks about how Elisha was an angered prophet he said that wasn't the spirit of Christ that wasn't the holy ghost that was an anchored prophet and that was a mistake he shouldn't have done that Elisha was wrong because he let the little children who were mocking him anger him and in his anger he cursed them and that was not the spirit of Christ that was himself that was wrong and we know that brother Branham faced a similar test when the couple was being irreverent in the front seat and he was told they're in your hands whatever you say and he said I forgive you he passed the test but both tests had to do with irreverence and it's amazing when brother man in one quote many times he just says that's not the holy ghost that wasn't Christ but here he says in Elisha the prophet from 1956 he says now remember he had a temper too and some children begin to make fun of him because he was bald-headed and he cursed those children and that wasn't so much for the children's sake it was for the parents that didn't raise up their children to respect God that's what it was the parents lost their children because two she Bears killed 42 of them he goes on a little later he said but do you see something it was the people's attitude towards God's messenger brother Brown says Elisha was wrong Elisha was wrong there's no way around it he was wrong but he says the reason the parents lost their children is because they disrespected God's prophet when they disrespected and Dishonored The Prophet they disrespected God and they so disrespect unto God's servant Into the Heart of their children and it brought a curse and it brought death I can tell you the same thing will happen today it may not be she bears amen but we don't disrespect God we don't disrespect God's way we don't disrespect God's prophet I want to look at a few scriptures together let's go to Psalms 111. I want to lay out a little pattern here Psalms 111 . 11 and 10. the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and good understanding have all they that do his Commandments his praise endureth forever this word fear can be to be afraid of Terror are also deep reverence respect and the reverence and fear of God is the beginning of wisdom God in modern culture God is preached as though he's a woman and though he's always loved you and always come to Mama and he overlooks everything you do and but God has to be respected he's also a judge and he brings chastisement he's also a father so we have to be careful that we don't lean so one way on the aspect of God that we forget that God is a righteous God and he's to be respected in fact God demands respect he's not wishy-washy about it he demands respect uh let's go to Psalms 103 let's go back just a couple chapters here Psalms 103. verse 8. verse 8 the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous and mercy he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever he has not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the Earth is great his Mercy is towards them that fear Him now I want to lock in on that statement that fear Him because he says the Lord is merciful gracious slow to anger plenteous and mercy he won't always tide neither would keep anger forever he will not deal with us after our sins the reward us according to our iniquities I mean this is great God will forgive us God overlook God will have mercy but look at the requirements he says so the great is his Mercy toward them that fear Him great is his Mercy towards them that respect him honor and deeply reference him that's who he shows Mercy to verse 12 as far as the East is from the West so far hath he removed our transgression from us like as a father pitieth his children so the Lord pityth them that fear Him who's immersive for the ones that fear Him who does he pityth the ones that fear Him that respect him for he knoweth our frame he remembers that we are dust so he knows we're going to make mistakes he knows we're going to fail he knows he knows what happened in the Garden of Eden and he knows what's what situation we're stuck with in our flesh so he's merciful and piteous who those that respect him if you respect and honor God his mercies are new every morning he pityth you as a father pityth his children amen who be why because he knows that you're but dust but what if you're not fearing the Lord he goes on and he says verse 14 again for he knoweth our frame he remembered that we are dust as for man his days are his grass as a flower of the field so he flourishes for the wind passes over and it is gone and the place thereof shall know shall know it no more but the mercy of the Lord is from Everlasting to Everlasting upon them that fear Him and his righteousness unto his children's children to such as keep his Covenant and to those that remember his Commandments to do them who gets this Mercy who gets this un unstopping undenying mercy and Grace and love who gets this the ones that respect and honor him as a father and keep his Covenant and look after his Commandments they're the ones who receive these benefits when we preach it is this you can do whatever you want but God loves you and God overlooks it and Jesus died for all of your mistakes those statements are true they're true in a way but in a way they're false they're true in a way absolutely for the elect of God and for the children of God God is merciful god knows you're but dust he is tender in his Mercy he overlooks your iniquity he pityth you to those that fear him there must be a reverential fear of respect towards God into his word and then all of these benefits come it's not just like you can live laodicean and be anything that you want to be come to church and sing a nice song that says I love you I love you and then God overlooks all the sin in our lives and the the deformity of humanity and how Grievous the our actions are and I know chastisement will come and no correction my goodness we've got a complete perverted image of who God is in Proverbs chapter 1 . let's go over to Proverbs we're going to read a few scriptures back to back here Proverbs chapter 1. verse 7. Proverbs chapter 1 verse 7 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction chapter 14 proverbs 14. and 27. the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life to depart from it to depart from the snares of death so the fear of the Lord is not just wisdom and not just knowledge it is a Fountain of Life to reverence God and fear Him and respect him is a fountain of life because it keeps you subject to his word and that brings you into life chapter 15 verse 33. the fear of the Lord is is the instruction of wisdom and before honor is humility let's go to John 14. John 14. verse 15. Jesus looks at his disciples and says if you love me sing a nice song in church you love me reverence me respect and honor me a man can say the same thing in his family you can bake me pies every day but if you disrespect and dishonor me it's not love amen to a man it's not love you can say nice things about me but if every time I say this is what we need to do and you do the opposite that's not love amen it doesn't come across his love it doesn't feel like love to a man you can say nice things you can make a good dinner but if you don't reference and respect it's not love and Jesus says if you love me keep my Commandments if you love me respect me if you love me honor me if you love me fear me amen and like I said before God demands respect I mean this world is an absolute disrespect of God but is God going to do nothing about it no he's given him space to repent and the long sufferings of the Lord are for salvation to those who will turn he sent a prophet to declare but that Prophet didn't just declare the goodness of God he also began the judgments of the Earth because God will chase in this world for their sin he will burn it with fire he will Stone them with stones as he demands respect let's look at First Corinthians 11. First Corinthians 11. and 31. First Corinthians 11 and 31. for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world if we fail to judge ourselves guess what he'll judge us not look over it not act like it didn't happen not that you're going on or but he'll chasten you chasing is a spanking amen a correction he will correct you why so that you won't be condemned with the world you're his child he'll take care of you it's for your good but he's not just going to pass it off and let it go God has to restore respect in his own household that's what he was doing through a prophet he was restoring respect in his own household the church had got out of respects of God got off of the word amen and no longer made the the word the head and made the church the head made a committee of men deciding factors over the word and God sends a prophet along and that Prophet is a man's man and what's he doing he's calling it all wrong and he's pointing out amen the error of the church and the fallacy of men and he's bringing God's house back in respect amen and it's a good thing so as some of that was rough it needed to be rough it was a chastening a chastening is not supposed to feel good I don't I mean I gave him a spank and he was laughing the whole time said it tickle thank you Mommy no it's supposed to be a shaking amen get us back in position get us out of our position and bring us back into respect for God and this message brought the church back in respects to God because God demands respect and he says if you love me keep my Commandments you'll see people who will transgress the Commandments of God and pay no more attention to the word of God Amen pay no more attention to what Paul wrote than anybody they'll change it they'll say it doesn't matter amen the churches of the world Amen they'll Overlook all of that and say you just come and you love God God loves you that's all you need and they come and sing a love song to God hmm and go home thinking that God received their love he said if you love me keep my Commandments sometimes the judgments of God are harsh harsh sometimes the spankings are hard look at what he did to the nation of Israel and to Judah first he promised I'm bringing you into a land I'm giving this land for you and your Generations forever I have given this inherent I'll drive out the inhabitants I'll do this and I'll do that he tells David there'll not be one to cease from your lineage to sit upon your throne amen and so he he gives all these promises but what did Jude and Israel do they relaxed under the promise of God and they begin to lose respect for God and they begin to transgress his Commandments they begin to trample upon his word they begin to ignore his worship and ignore his Temple until many times the temple would fall into ruin amen disrepair amen the priests would start mixing the religion of Baal in with the religion of Jehovah doing things that they were absolutely commanded not to do amen they were under the promise of God and they felt content we're the children of God he brought us out of Egypt he told us he gave us his land he'll drive out the inhabitants he'll be a wall around us and we're here to be perpetually for Generations this is always our land and there'll always be a king on the throne of David and they forgot back in Deuteronomy he said if they will keep my ways amen the modern churches amen are preaching the blessing but bringing people into disrespect of God but the message snapped us out of that and I want to say stay snapped out see the church is the woman is the mother time and the word is the husband is Christ is the man and so in order for the whole household to be right amen the woman must and her children must come subject to the headship of the word and must reverence the word because Jesus says if you love me keep my Commandments so now in order for the church to be right and the children to be blessed and for everything to go well the word has to stay headship as the masculine and the church listen the church is supposed to be nurturing they're feminine in designation the church should be nurturing the church should be gentle the church should be loving the church should be the one that gathers around in a wounded time they gather to help they gather to support that's the church and that's a good function for the church but the problem is that coddling nurturing spirit amen in the church now when things begin to go wrong and now someone's off the word amen if there's too much of that feminine nature not checked by the masculine then the church now begins to say I I know that Paul said but I I know the Bible says but but listen there's more you need to understand and our church fathers and our elders and we as a church we we interpret it this way and yeah you can get married again I understand you didn't mean it I know that you don't quite meet the qualifications but you can take this office or this position I mean because we see you love him we love you so much and we see you're really trying you see how the woman can fail and what she is what the the church has done in her love has brought a curse upon the very children she claims to love just as much as those children and those children in Samaria were cursed because of what their parents their parents disrespect for the prophet amen LED down to their disrespect that brought them under a curse and Damnation the church has done the same thing when by love and so much tenderness and love and affection and nurturing and coddling amen until all of a sudden they'll Overlook sin and say that's okay you stay right here we understand you didn't mean to I know you didn't mean it and God understands yeah God understands that's the truth God understands he knows when he's being disrespected he knows when the woman is usurping authority over the man and now for that nature listen we don't want the church to become rough and we don't if the whole church became an evangelist I would find a new church we want the church to be gentle we want to gather around the Saints we want to be nurturing but what gives the freedom for the woman to take her role is that there's a male standing at the gate saying we will and we won't we will and we won't setting the boundaries keeping things in check so that the woman has the freedom to express the feminine nature so that the church can be nurturing the church can be calling the church can gather around in times of discomfort and Times of distress amen but but that church can never begin to take the children's heart away from the authority of the word that's where the church fails and that's where it brings a curse upon the very children that's supposed to be loved same thing's true in the home if a mother if a father lays down a rule amen but when father's at work and mother says now listen I know Dad said but but I know I know really what you want I know it's okay let's just do this and not say anything to Dad I know dad doesn't want this but it's okay this time you have no idea what damage is being done to that child that's what's wrong with the entire country because the church has started that attitude spilled into the culture and now the world is in chaos yeah well I mean it was only about whether they can ride their bike on the road or not or whether they can eat ice cream no listen it's not about that it's about training those children to give reverence to the masculine spirit because if you teach them to disrespect their dad it will be nothing for them to disrespect God's word it'll be so easy that's what's happened to our culture men used to be respected men used to be authorities men used to have power to rule their own house and when that got Stripped Away why because of the church when that got Stripped Away we see the chaos we're in now amen what a mother needs to do is constantly uphold the authority of that father she needs to tell the children let's ask Dad no dad said dad said no we shouldn't do that dad said yes this is okay what's she doing she's training her children to come under the authority of the masculine spirit amen healthy it's good the opposite is damaging very damaging and it may seem like love but it's not love because now you're setting up a struggle within your children when you just want them to respect does that means every one of dad's decisions is right no it does not mean that dad's decisions are right but Dad has the right to make a wrong decision and I'm sorry if that rubs somebody the wrong way but it's absolutely the way it has to be dad has the right to make the wrong decision but Dad must bear the consequences for that wrong decision he's got to take responsibility if he's going to take the privilege he's going to take the responsibility as well but he's the one with the right and you say but it's wrong but I feel it's this you and listen you've got a right to ask him about it you've got a right to have a conversation but don't you do it in front of your children don't you question his authority don't you question his decisions don't you question his soundness and making decisions in front of his children if you do you're setting up trouble amen because why he has the right as the man as the father as the husband to set the rules to set everything he has the right yes and and if we take away that right it brings a danger to the whole family it's like taking a wall that God built for protection and start just willy-nilly knocking holes in it anywhere that you want to knock holes in now there's no more protection but when we begin to do that we get out of our lane we begin to hinder the whole work and actually the the very the very mother who will take a tender heart and do those things is actually going to do more damage than good to her children because she wanted to give the popsicle or let him ride the bike or whatever it was she thinks it's nothing but she doesn't realize that if you continue to do that and continue to be little that and continue to make dad look like he doesn't know doesn't understand doesn't have a big enough heart then what you're going to do is destroy that child because now they're thinking dad doesn't make good decisions mom does dad doesn't understand Mom does that doesn't feel for me mom does ruining the very thing that God put in place to protect the family oh listen like I said is Dad right every time absolutely not doesn't mean his idea is better than moms absolutely not sometimes moms is way better than dads but you better wait and ask him privately about that and let him come back around and say you know what I had the wrong idea I talked to Mom and she gave me this is a better idea we're going to switch that so the man is always in his position he doesn't have to claim to know everything he can claim to be a knucklehead sometimes say listen guys that was a knucklehead move I should have never done that I talked to your mom and I realized that there was something else going on here I missed it I'm sorry we're going to switch to this but he has to do it he has to do it to keep everything in this right place not her coming and saying now you're sitting at the dinner table and all of a sudden dad says we're not going to do but you told him two days ago they couldn't I don't think that's fair and I agree with the kids you're tearing down your own house you're destroying your own children now you can talk to him privately and tell him I think that's a foolish mistake I don't think that's right whatever you say goes but I think you're missing something that's fine but don't do it in front of those kids don't don't go and undermine the the faith they have in the masculine Spirit and the ability for that man to rule his house don't do that you'll regret it the whole family will suffer what's happened the church has done that very same thing they've come along and say Paul wasn't married he doesn't understand and Paul's too hard on women do you know what that statement does Paul the whole statement Paul was too hard on women he didn't understand and Paul was never married so Paul really he shouldn't have said that and do you know what you have just done to a whole group of people that you you've poisoned with that garbage you know we can do the same thing in the message when brother Branham teaches marriage and divorce and we go around and say he didn't mean it that way we can do it this way you've done the same exact thing we've done the same thing amen why because God put us under the headship of a messenger in this day and we must honor that Prophet we honor the prophet we reverence God because he's the one who sent the prophet he's the one who Vindicated the prophet he's the one who gave the prophet what to preach and bringing us back into respect of God amen amen what's happened in our culture in our society is men have been publicly derided they've been chastised by their wives they've been shamed and you know what men have an ego it's not right but it's there I admit to it a man's problem is his ego and that's what trip up a man every time but you go publicly you start challenging his authority you start making him look like a fool or insensitive or not knowing better in front of his children in front of his family that man that man many times if he doesn't have the right understanding Authority he'll go silent because he's not going to go through the pain of that again and now you've got a man who won't take his position but now he'll just defer everything to his wife why because he's a weak man well maybe maybe you should take his position but maybe because she destroyed his manhood when she should have been elevating it for her own protection we have to say God I want to live the way you want me I want my family to be structured the way your family is structured I want to recognize your ways and I want to live your ways amen the church has destroyed her own children by getting them to lose reverence for the word the best way that we can protect the people is to show them reverence to the word you respect God you reverence God when the word says this but don't you think yeah sometimes it's hard sometimes I don't understand my feeling is for you and I I don't want this to happen but the word says it doesn't mean you don't feel sometimes sometimes you don't even question sometimes you don't even understand amen but the word says amen that's the right Authority that's the right position and then the church comes under that that's the way we need to be amen I'm going to skip ahead a little bit I want to go to First Chronicles 13. First Chronicles 13. First Chronicles 13. and 10. this is when David is bringing the ark to himself and they put the Ark on an ox cart and they begin to bring it to himself and it says here and the anger of the Lord was kindled against uzum and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before God and David was displeased because the Lord had made a breach upon uza therefore that place is called to this day and David was afraid of God that day David was afraid of God that day This Modern teaching on God is that don't fear God don't be afraid of God but David was afraid of God that day and guess what David should have been afraid of God because David transgressed God's law and by his transgression God smote a man dead should he have been afraid of that yeah he should have been afraid of God because God demands respect he doesn't give up his vision he demands respect he may be long-suffering and bringing the chastisement he may let something go on to fully manifest himself like he let the the cup of the amorites become full before he brought destruction but God will not let it pass it may pass for a decade it may pass for a generation but God will not let it pass he demands respect and when he brought judgment on David on that situation A man was laying dead and David went to his house afraid of God and he should have been afraid of God just like you know when you have a little Todd at home and he's not listening not doing well and mother looks at him and says I'm I'm going to talk to Dad and when Dad gets home he's going to deal with that should that little boy girl be afraid of dad yes they should be afraid of dad not afraid that dad's going to be violent not afraid of their daddy that he's going to be a brood but they should have a good healthy reverential fear that what they did is going to meet with a judgment by a judge who's able to Institute the judgment and that fear of dad keeps that child in check amen so that he doesn't allow his own little Fallen Spirit to take him too far one way or the other David was afraid of God he should have been amen well I don't want to be afraid of God then you stay under his Commandments reverence him respect him in his mercies are new for you his rights is unto you is for Everlasting to Everlasting amen as long as you are in the fear of God you don't have to be afraid because God knows you're but dust and God will forgive you God will correct you and forgive you and his mercies are new every morning but if you are disrespecting God and you're afraid you ought to be afraid because the hand of chastisements coming and it needs to come because God has to restore respect in his house that's why a man has to stay in his position and bring correction and he must restore respect and reverence in his house it's his job to do it amen amen it may be hard you may be misunderstood but it's the very protection for everybody that's under your leadership you must stay true to your position brother Branham says one time said in the message God doesn't call man the Judgment without first warning him says I don't know what caused me to do it but I said Lord God you owe me an understanding this is when the woman he had prayed for she was healed he declared or healed amen and just shortly after I think the next day she died he said Lord you owe me an understanding see after we going out there and telling that husband and him coming to the Lord after you've done those things for him and all that life and then taking that girl's life like that I said you owe me an understanding when you tell God something like that he'll leave you sit alone brother bam goes on to say he don't owe me nothing I'm in debt to him well he just let me pout it out for a few days you know and after about three or four months brother but I'm saying that you know what God had a relationship with his Prophet where he's constantly in continual communion with the prophet amen but when he says God you owe me an explanation God said that's it I'm pulling away from this communion amen and brother Branham found out he couldn't control God didn't owe him nothing no matter who he was who was he the seventh angel the prophet of the age The Chosen before the foundation of the world who was he but God didn't know him nothing what was God doing God was bringing that Prophet back into proper respect you can't talk to God any way you want you can't make demands of God God can just pull away from you and if you want to do it on your own you do it on your own he let him pound it out for a few days then after about three or four months one day I was out on the creek bank and the Lord spoke to me in a vision and said now go to her mother and say this to her mother did not her time come the year before when she was drowning in the creek on a picnic she should have went at that time but I had to take her when she was ready to go and that's what all this has happened and why you went out there then I got down and I cried and I said Lord Jesus forgive me your poor stupid servant I should have never said that Lord amen I mean sometimes we talk about the goodness of God and the love of God and the good but we need to keep that in check with the Judgment of God and the chastisement of God and the reverence for God because God demands reverence amen you can't live any way you want and command him and demand him and say you have to forgive me you have to overlook this you have to bless me he doesn't have to do anything that he doesn't want to do and he's got the right to say yes and he has the right to say no and as long as we stay in that kind of reverence amen we're going to find ourselves in a good position because we're going to have a father God who is watching out for us and protecting us and nurturing us and caring for us and shielding us from all the storms of life that's right that's the proper respect we want brother Branham says it in the message and knoweth it not he says I'm not a politician I don't neither I don't neither democrat or republican they're all Filthy I'm for one Kingdom and that's the kingdom of Jesus Christ that's all but how in the world did you ever see a bunch of Puppets like we got up there now like that bunch of Texans we got in there he's a man he can say what he thinks praise God now listen he says why they say whatever the people want if they want communism we'll give them communism if they want integration we'll give them integration we want segregation we'll give them whatever where is a man this is what brother bear said where is a man the men sitting up there saying well if that's what the people want that's what we'll give them the politicians they want communism if they want segregation whatever they want we'll give them and brother banham says the statement where is man he says oh God that's like the pulpit where is a man a man that's a man that stands for a principle where is women that stands for a principle where is a church that stands for a principle I ain't got a nickel's worth of time for a wishy-washy given compromising spirit a woman is a woman let her be a lady if a man is a man let him be a man if he's president where is our John Quincy Adams is where are Abraham Lincoln's man of principle where is our Patrick Henry said Give me liberty or give me death where is a man that stands for what's right where is the man that's not afraid to speak out regardless the whole world's against him speak out for what's right and stand for it and die for it where is our Arnold Van Winkle Reed again today where is Men of Integrity where is men with Spirit they are so wishy-washy and gummed up until they don't know where they stand God let me stand with the principles of a man as a minister the word of Jesus Christ praise God for heavens and earth will pass away but it'll never fail on this rock I'll build my church The Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against him oh praise God I like a man who will talk like that I got an argument we'll point that out where's the man that'll stand for convictions where is man that'll take the hit where's man that's willing to say what's right and take the repercussions that come from it where is a man that will defend his family and stay in position and say we won't because the word says even if his own family misunderstands him where's the man that's willing to do what's best for them not what's easiest for himself where is the man willing to get shot at rocks thrown at him Amen to do what is right that's man doesn't matter if he's loud or if he's soft-spoken doesn't matter if he's got hair all over him or he's smooth skinned you see that's not what man is man is the character to stay in his position and say I have a responsibility to take care of these that are under me and in order to do that I can't always be popular and I can't always be smooth and I can't always be sweet but this is love This Is Love from a masculine nature brother remember says and the message have not I seen Cynthia so sometimes I preach pretty rough because see that because somebody's getting out of line you see you're supposed to do that a real daddy will why he'd shake you and say here get back here in line if he's a real true father so sometimes your pastor has to weigh down on something just love him that much more because he's a real father to you see trying to keep you lined up because he's watching over your soul which the Holy Ghost has made him the overseer of the church and you must always watch that so brother Branham said sometimes I preach pretty rough because somebody's getting out of line he says you're supposed to do that this world's been so feminized that we're not allowed to speak rough anymore and speaking rough somehow is mean since when is talking like a man mean but I mean the whole culture has got to a certain way that we all recoil at that but my goodness listen to a few tapes listen to the message and listen to who God chose Amen to be the messenger's age to take the masculine side to dispense the word why because when The Minister's ministering he's taking the masculine role because he's giving out the word amen so there's a masculine row and a feminine role to receive the word and brother Branham came in a masculine role amen he was also part of the Bride that's feminine but when he was delivering the word as the prophet of the age he took on a masculine role and he says sometimes you shake people you need to do that amen sometimes a man needs to shake his house shake his children sometimes he needs to bring correction sometimes it needs to come from the pulpit amen we don't need to turn into the culture whenever that happens we need to sit down and say God what are you trying to teach me not he's not allowed to talk that way well forget about the way he's talking what's he saying he said the culture sometimes can creep in the churches creep into message churches where it's surrounded we have to push it out we have to constantly resist it it's in our workplace it's in our schools it's all around us we've got to constantly put that out or else every time you hear Brother Bear say something on tape you're like oh I wish he wouldn't have said that that way I want to give this tape to my friend maybe what your friend needs is to hear a masculine voice tell the truth something different than what they're hearing all the time amen one of the first tapes I listened to is marriage and divorce you want to talk about rough there were some rough statements in marriage and divorce and it was in the first block of tapes that I listened to but my goodness something inside of me came alive when a man was a man and said what was true and something in me knew that he was right I didn't I mean I thought it was a little hard there was times I was like oh that's too far that's too much but my goodness he was drawing something out of me pulling me back into respect to God you know we got to be careful as brothers and sisters too how we talk about the ministry of God because we can do the same thing in a church that a mother can do in her home amen is a preacher always right no is everything he says right is the fivefold ministry and foundable absolutely not but if you go home and start criticizing that Minister and he said he's standing there in a male role dispensing the word and what you're sowing into the heart of your children is wrong now there may be mistakes made in the Pulpit there has been and there will be but that's when you can do like Mom does Dad you go to that man and you say listen I didn't understand what you said it seemed a little bit that the man correct it and let the man come back and say I shouldn't have done that but don't you dare go amongst yourself start saying do you think that was right do you think this we think he should have done that I didn't like the way what seed is being sown what damage is being done amen you can ruin a man's influence and ruin his ministry and that may be the ministry that God will use to save your child summer rougher summer softer summer are bold some are all over the place some stand at the platform amen don't worry about your favorite style and don't criticize everything that's not your favorite Style Just Hold Steady and let go and if there's something wrong let's make it right let's have a conversation but don't sow evil seeds seeds of discrepancy seeds that cost somebody to maybe doubt in their mind and the next time that man's preaching they're a little closed up because they're not so sure because this brother who's a good brother he said something and made me wonder okay amen help us we all have to be careful I stand here this morning regretting things I said about other ministers I have regrets I regret being critical I regret that I let that come out of my mouth and my family heard or another Brotherhood I said God help us help us to show you respect if you called that man and you allowed the circumstances to work where he was in the Pulpit that day then I want to show you respect by showing respect to that office and if he's wrong I'll talk to him if he needs to be corrected he'll get corrected but I'm not going to put myself in a position position to disrespect because you called the man and you allowed him to stand here amen you may disagree with who's behind the pulpit amen but it's not your decision it's the pastor's decision and the pastor's the head of the church by God's ordination so when you start showing disrespect for that you're showing disrespect for God if there's a problem there's places to talk but not around dinner tables and fellowships that doesn't solve the problem that creates a bigger problem we cannot undermine God's way we cannot begin to to lose reverence and respect above everything God give me reverence and respect because God will honor my reverence and respect even to a man who's wrong if he's wrong God will deal with him but God will not if I lose respect for a god-given position then I'm in trouble with God yeah now it's not about whether the man's right or wrong it's about me being respectful to God right that doesn't give a minister a license to say whatever he wants he'll be corrected by the word too he'll get his chastisement and everybody has a right to ask any Minister why he said what he said everybody has that right just like Mom has a right to ask Dad you better do it respectfully you better show honor to God and one of the worst things you can say is that man's not even called to preach you may feel every wave that's wrong and it doesn't connect or whatever but what if God did call that man to preach what if he did for the what if reason I won't say that because if God did but I don't think he did and I don't feel well maybe your feelings are off that day maybe you're not 100 in your discernment but to let that come out of your mouth and to say that to another person that was sitting in the congregation that day that man has not even called he shouldn't even be in the pulpit then how did he get there was it through God's provided way or not if it was wrong it'll be corrected if he doesn't have a Ministry God will expose it if it's not right but for the chance that maybe he is he just had an off day or he is and maybe he hasn't come into his gift yet maybe he is and he can't get past himself for the chance that maybe he is I won't say that because if the man believes he was called and he says God called me who am I to say God didn't I wasn't there I didn't hear the conversation I don't perfectly know what's in God's mind just because I feel one way or the other we're going to have our children destroyed by she bears if we don't properly respect God amen it's not easy but it's true and we're all guilty I'm guilty I'm ashamed of things that I've said and I've asked God to forgive me because you can ruin a man's reputation and use it ruin his ability to help somebody else and he might just be just the tool God was going to use but because you put a doubt in somebody's mind I said God help us all I want to stay in respect I want the word to be masculine I want God offices to be masculine I want I want to respect that and if it's wrong I'll go talk to the brother I'll ask him if and if he doesn't listen I'll ask God to take care of it because God's responsible for that because God put that over me please help me God never to find myself being the wrong kind of woman and undermining what God is doing help us we should have enough we should have enough teaching by now enough respect for God's way because the prophet taught us this way that if there's something that's wrong or needs to address that we can go to that individual and talk to them and not have already talked to five people because it might have been a situation easily resolved maybe there's something you didn't understand or maybe there's something the minister actually had wrong said wrong or even misunderstood and he can come back next time and say listen I was wrong on that a brother come and talk to me and show me a better way and I'm sorry but this is the right way and then nobody in that room has lost respect for that Ministry amen but if you do it the other way over the fellowship after church and then it gets around to that man what have we done what evil evil I'm gonna call it evil it's evil what evil have we done and we think we're so spiritual while we're doing it because we know he's not a call man he should have said that I know the message what you're doing is you're putting yourself over God's offices because you're too proud of yourself and you think you know something that man doesn't know I say God help us this Prophet came and was a manly man to put us back in respect to God and it's going to take men standing behind the pulpit to keep us in respect to God so that we don't find ourselves being a foolish woman and tearing down our own house God help us all we all need a good switching for the things that we've said about brothers and sisters and Things We Said about ministers every one of us need it we need to keep our line lined up the word is over the church and the church is subject to the word the father is over his wife in his home and they're all subject to the father the the fifo ministry is over the church the pastors over a local church and that's the way God wants it and we have to stay reverent to that and if we stay reverent to that God will bless us and if it's wrong rest assured God will take care of it he still has a switch and he still knows how to use it nobody's getting away with anything we may think but because God is long-suffering that's so you have a chance to repent amen when you don't repent sometimes God sits back and lets Hey listen sometimes we think well nothing was correct nothing happened it's okay with God just because nothing happens quickly when you fall and you fail doesn't mean nothing happened with God maybe he's going to let you get a little comfortable and give the cow a little bit of rope God must not mind it's okay all right do it again until all of a sudden that little Spirit of rebellion comes into full opening rebellion and God will take care of it once not as a seed but when it bears fruit yeah amen God doesn't miss anything don't think you're getting away with anything we're not getting away with nothing God will take care of it and God will straighten us back out we've all been wrong but God calling us back to reverence back to respect for his word and everything his word calls for if you have doubts about anything I said read the message brother bear I mentioned all of this order is God's plan and if we honor it God will honor us God will do whatever needs to be done to bring his word to pass and to take care of his wife and his children amen why is the church in chaos why is the world in chaos because the church left the headship of the word why are families in chaos because the man is no longer the head of his home he has to be equal with his wife and she has to have just as much say as him where is that in the Bible see the culture's ruined because we left the word the families are ruined because we left the word Our Lives will be ruined if we leave the word and instead of a blessing on our children we'll put a curse upon them God help us not to bring a curse help us not to teach others to disrespect first God correct me and bring me in line and then God help me not to wrongly influence others so that we stay in respect to God and we have to have respect for the masculine spirit says I'm going to read this last quote and we'll close he says you say you're always talking on our women about our women all right men I will comb you down once then let me tell you something any man that will let his wife smoke cigarettes and wear shorts I got little respect of him even being a man well you can say all you want what I'm supposed to be nice and I have to be brother bam said I doubt you even being a man you know sometimes people say well I can't control my children I can't control they can do whatever they want listen I don't know about you but I fund everything that happens in my house I fund everything that happens in my house and I can whine and say they won't listen to me they won't do anything and they keep drawing money out of my bank to go do what I told them not to do be a man and shut it off and say if you disrespect me I'm not going to be able to bless you my goodness be a man take your position it's your position amen you're the one who's facilitating the whole life of your family you've got the you're funding it you're giving the money you've got the bank account you make decisions you own the cars your name's on the title my goodness why are you standing by as if you can do nothing it's your responsibility brother Branham said as long as I'm alive and have a slat of wood I won't allow that to happen well sometimes you can't take a old Barrel slot and nothing but sometimes you can just say all right but that's it no more I'm done that's so mean there's nothing mean about it that's love because that has to bring everything back into God's order that's real love showing respect and showing reverence was Moses a perfect man not in any way shape or form was he chosen of God to be the deliverer and Lead his Nation yes did he have faults yes did he make mistakes yes but when his sister and brother disrespected him God slowed her with leprosy it wasn't about Moses it was about the office that God put him in it was about disrespecting God amen when they wanted a king amen and Samuel was the prophet Samuel comes in Christ the god they rejected me and God says they haven't rejected you they've rejected me by rejecting you they rejected me when we reject the headship of the male we're the headship of a husband amen you rejected God because that's God's word when we reject the prophet of the age we've rejected God because that's God's word I said God keep me keep me Keep Me in respect brother Brown goes on to say I just want to read this the way he says it says I got little respect of him even being a man he's so sisified he don't even know what he belongs to he ain't man that's right that's right he's a poor excuse for a man oh he may be six foot tall weigh 200 pound but that don't look like a man to me that shows whose boss around your house she will stomp her foot I'll tell you right now and you'll bow down like you was a sick kitten what's the matter oh lordy he knows what he's talking about what we need today is men we need gospel preachers any preacher that will stand in the pulpit and hold back on these things I got little respect of him being called of God a man that's ashamed to stand in the pulpit and tell the God's truth when he knows it's an immoral thing for a woman to cut her hair a man's got a right to leave his wife and give her a divorce when she cuts her hair listen this is what brother Brandon's saying the Bible said who's the head of the woman her husband in the Bible said If a woman cuts her hair she dishonors her head no dishonorable woman should be lived with amen she cuts off her glory and so does the church when she does the same thing she cuts her glory stream off oh God why do I say these things but it's the truth we don't need compromises we need men and women who will stand for justice and right and tell the truth regardless of what it is but the man says if a woman will cut off her hair because her hair shows that she's under the headship of her husband and if she dishonors her head by shaving or cutting her hair then he has a right to put her away in divorcement she's dishonorable woman and brother Benham said a dishonorable woman shouldn't even be lived with amen amen how many men have I talked to that told me when their families were struggling with the message struggling to believe and struggling with the standard and they says you know what I'm going to back off a little bit and stay close to my wife and my children and help them through this friends they lost their entire family they had a wife and children who begin to disbelieve the message and struggle when brother Ben said this and don't cut your hair and women can't dress this and they started and they started bickering at him and bickering around him bickering at him and so he was going to do the nice thing the cultural thing amen what Society tells us the laodicean attitude is okay I'm not going to be too firm that I'm not going to take my stand and I'm not going to push too hard what I'm going to do is back down and I'm going to get close and I'm just going to show love and as I show love to them I'll pull them back in amen that brother I had that conversation with he lost his entire family and he's alone now it doesn't work what he should have said that's for me and my house will serve the Lord this is the way it'll be here if you can't live here I can't force you to but this is the way it will be here I love you I want you to be here I always take care of you I always take responsibility for you but this I have to serve God and I have to stay in respect to God regardless of what you choose to do I don't want you to go and I don't want anything to happen but I have to serve God and this man had to dishonor God to love his family and now he stands in dishonor at least he would have been an honor with God even if we'd have been alone that that doesn't work I had another one of my children this is tell all day we won't do this very often so you better soak it up it's just today I had another one start to question why this and why that and is this right and this right and there wasn't anything bad it wasn't rebellious it was just questioning but the question would get to be a little bit more of a pushback and I said listen let me say something to you I said I'm responsible for this house and everybody under my care and as long as you live here this is the way it will be and I'm not even asking you to believe it you don't have to believe it you can disagree and that's fine you're a free moral agent and I said one day you're going to be old enough to have your own home and in your own home you're going to have to make your decision on how you want to serve God whether or not you want to serve God and how you want to serve God and you have every right and freedom to make that choice but until then this is the way it'll be you know what I just drew out of that child of respect and honor and masculinity you know what happened the troubles went completely away and I never had one more discussion and one more trouble why because I wasn't forcing him to be religious I wasn't forcing him to pretend to be a Christian I was just telling the way I was going to serve my God and everything under me was going to lie into this because I love God and I will serve God regardless of what you think sometimes your children need to know that they're not that big a deal so how can you say that listen if it's if it comes down to me or you or God I'm taking God I have no option I can't save you by leaving God I can only Save You by staying with God and so sometimes we you just need to we need to just be a man and just say listen I love you I love you to pieces but I can't leave this word this is my husband this is my mate this is my headship I can't forsake it you can believe what you want to believe and that's okay for me you can make decisions when you're old enough and free you can make decisions you want to make and that's okay with me I'll still love you I'm not forcing you to be a believer but I am going to have respect for God and the home that he's given me and if I'm using the money he's given me to make the payments and we're paying for a phone and we're paying for internet and we're paying by the money that God gives me I'm not going to allow any of that money to be used for evil and this home is consecrated to God and none of it I'm gonna I'm not giving your space over in the corner for you to live evil because I respect God I don't know maybe I'm a million ways from wrong but I believe it's right and I believe it will be the salvation of our families when men act like men and women act like ladies and everybody stays in their Lane and shows respect and allows the feminine attribute to be on display and allows the masculine to be on display and they come into harmony one with another I believe that'll be salvation and Redemption and Holiness and perfection in a home where boys can grow up to be men and where girls can grow up to be Godly ladies and women praise God his word is always right the culture is wrong my ideas if they're contrary to the word is wrong the word is always right and God demands respect and if God has to rock your jaw rock your jaws every once in a while to bring you back in respect that's the best thing that ever happened to you enough would God do that read the Bible look at brother Branham how many times did God talk to him like a man remember standing in the Gap he's weary from the ministry he wants to leave wants to run him and brother Benham says all right God comes and says you go on with your plans and you'll be a bum like that and your wife will leave she won't stay up there hey guess what brother Branham could take the Straight Talk from God he didn't come wishy-washy gobbled up footing he just came and he said what was going to happen this is what will happen this is why if you do that if you make that choice he didn't say you're not allowed to make that choice but he said if you make that choice this is what's going to happen these are the consequences and brother Branham could respond to that I know it's that Ministry that called me back into respect for them it was straight it was hard it was sometimes culturally unfitting sometimes it was shocking to my system having grown up in laodicea through the 80s and 90s amen and all of a sudden I would hear that and I say can he say that can a preacher say that but he was drawing me he was drawing masculinity out of me and he was drawing me back into respect for God and I'm so thankful because I would not have the family I have today if that man didn't preach the way he preached [Music] I wouldn't be where I was I'd be in disrespect or Dishonored to God somewhere not knowing my position being influenced by the culture and a home would be a mess but I thank God that he sent the right Ministry with the right temperament at the right time to say the right thing to draw me back into respect for God because God demands respect and I don't want to be found disrespecting I mean let's all stand musicians if you'll come we'll pray I just want to say I love you I love you everyone and I never intended to preach like this today it wasn't my plan but you know what God is an honest God he's not influenced by the culture and neither is he bending and changing his nature because of our culture we don't have to change because of the culture we can stay with what God called us to be and find that their safety protection love there's nurture there's safety in our home safety in our churches safety in the message safety in the bride because we have respect for God and everything's come back with masculine and feminist in the right place in the right order and brought about the right Unity to display the very attributes I say thank God for this message let's bow our heads and pray their Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your goodness to us Lord I I stand corrected this morning God you've dealt with me on things I've said and things I've done that I shouldn't have said and I shouldn't have done and Lord I realize now more than ever that when I disrespected your ministry I disrespected you God when I shirked my responsibility stand like a man I failed you I failed to display part of your character and part of your nature when I failed in my home to take my place Lord that was my fault Forgive Me Lord God if you'll help me I want to stay in respect to you in everything Lord in every way under every word I want to stand Lord and face you one day knowing regardless of what happened around me I honored you in your word I didn't put my feelings above your word I didn't put my ideas above your word I didn't put the feelings of other people above your word but God by your help and your grace would you help me Lord to surrender myself to all those things and allow you to be Lord Of My Life King over me in every area of my life I love you Lord I ask that you help us as a people may we as families stay in a healthy order that'll be healthy for our children that will give our sisters freedom to be nurturing and loving and sweet and tender that they won't have to be hard they don't have to be Burly they won't have to take responsibility because their husbands do for them and they can be nurturing and sweet and gentle with their children with others May men take the responsibility Lord to stand in the front line and be a Watchman at the wall and the gatekeeper of their home may they stay true to your word and keep their homes lined up to your word that your blessings might continue to flow that little boys and girls might grow up to be Godly men and women God may we as an assembly stay in the right order lord always giving reverence to your word above everything else May the messenger that you sent Lord be a voice of Authority for us may we recognize you and your attributes Lord and may we surrender as a body of Believers as a bride to those attributes we love you God may ask God for your help Lord may you keep us Lord we know that we can't keep ourselves it's going to be you Lord but all your correction is good it cleanses the soul it purges us from traps and snares that we didn't see and we didn't recognize it keeps us from going further down the wrong road your mercy and your grace will bring correction in a different understanding so that we might snap out of these things and come back and level with your word in reverence to your word that you might bless us God we thank you let your word be preeminent we love you gone we thank you for the way you do things we declare that they are right and that they are good love you Lord I ask you bless us as we part bless the fathers that are among us on this remembrance of Father's Day God may they continually take the responsibility that you've handed to them to Shepherd a wife and to Shepherd a flock God would you give them wisdom to do so give them understanding Lord that they might stay in the right place in the right vein so the whole family that's under them can be blessed pray God that you would bless our fathers for their Godly men there are Godly influence doing what you've called them to do I'm so proud of them and thankful for the fellowship with men like these I pray you'd bless them today and may their wives and their children show them reverence and respect that is due and God and may they know that they're loved and respected and may you know Lord that you're loved and you are respected we ask these things and you're helping these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen age be thy way oh and I will walk my heart is here [Music] teach me [Music] foreign [Laughter] [Music] I hope to hear [Music] oh one more time oh yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] thank you is Lord [Music] he is
