our bibles and turn to mark 16 and before we read the scriptures i just want to wish all the mothers a happy mother's day amen like i say every year none of us would be here without a mother so we owe them we thank god for a good mother and we thank god for the sisters that are here they give us an example of what womanhood ought to be and what motherhood really is so we appreciate that i also want to let you know that brother mike sullivan sent a bunch of roses for all the mothers that are here and they're out in the foyer and between the doors so if you want to grab one on the way out some of you may not remember brother mike sullivan but he's visited here quite a bit and uh he's a wonderful brother and he stays in touch with us he lives away but he just wanted to do something special for all the moms so there's roses out there for every mother who would want one and also i want to make an announcement brother paul lafontaine sent me a text saying that they're starting the tri-state youth meetings up again so next sunday may 16th will be the first one at 6 00 pm and you're all invited to that all the youth that is amen amen god bless you all let's look at mark 16. mark 16 and verse 9. now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believe not after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country and let's just stop there and ask the lord to bless the reading of his word dear heavenly father we ask lord that you would bless the reading of your word god we can take the book and lord and in our physical hands read it lord with a an ability lord to understand the words but god only you can break the word to us only you can reveal it to us we're asking that you would come yourself and reveal your word to us and god we pray that you would open our eyes that we might understand and may we become more like you we ask it in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated my my plans have been interrupted a little bit i fully intended to continue on with the series that i've been enjoying so much on religion versus relationship i thought today we would come to part four but when i got friday and especially yesterday but started friday god started leaning me in another way and there was no option but just to preach amen and so what i want to preach on this sunday is i believe it'll be just an injection we'll preach this service i believe and then i still feel to go back to the series that we're on because my heart is still full of that subject but this morning i'd like to preach on the resurrection ministry of christ the resurrection ministry of christ because we know that there was three pools the jesus ministry there was three polls to brother branham's ministry and and we understand some of these things that the prophet has brought to us and we know there was a first and a second pool in the prophet's ministry and there was a first and a second pool and and jesus ministry but we also see that if you read the bible and we're going to look at this when you get to the resurrection ministry of jesus christ there was a change in the ministry of jesus christ in the resurrection the ministry before the resurrection was different looked different acted different than the ministry after the resurrection but he had a ministry after the resurrection and so i just want to take some time and i want to look at that the resurrection ministry of christ and and i want to read this uh scripture again and and mark 16 verse 9 it says now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils so we're going to get to this he first appeared to mary magdalene and we're going to look at that scripture in a minute and and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believe not after that he appeared in another form this is what i want you to catch after that he appeared in another form so the first thing we want to catch in the resurrection ministry of christ it's christ himself in another form amen and it was in a form that they did not recognize he was he was standing there he was walking with them on the road to emmaus because that's what the scripture is referring to and he was with them for six hours and more and in in and they were in direct contact he was a man and flesh it was jesus christ in flesh amen but he was in another form of flesh catch that put your spiritual jacket on now brother men would say don't let these things fly over our head and just be little verses in the bible these things are there for a reason and so now in the resurrection ministry he appeared to them in another form now let's look over at luke 24 and this is the road to emmaus story that this scripture in mark is referring to now don't forget mary magdalene he appeared first to her but we'll get to that in a minute luke 24 and verse 13. and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three score furlongs and brother brown tells us that that three score furlongs is about six miles three score furlongs and they they talked together of of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together in reason uh reason jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him why because mark says he came in another form it was jesus the bible says it was jesus amen but it was jesus in another form and their eyes were holding that they would not know him so in the resurrection ministry jesus comes and i want to i want to look at this too pre the pre-resurrection ministry amen jesus had a very public ministry the first and second pool were a very public ministry he would feed five thousand he would speak to multitudes he would heal all that were sick in the city and they would bring him from all the country round about to be healed amen the pre-resurrection ministry was a very public ministry amen but the post-resurrection ministry was a private ministry because the third pool won't be a public show so in the resurrection ministry of jesus christ it was not a public show amen but it was to the elect and we know in the third pool he went down to souls that were in prison now he went down to hell and preached to them and showed that they were forever condemned because they rejected the word in their day and now comes the fullness of the word that would have brought them redemption if they would have accepted the part of the word that they had in their day but by rejecting the part of the word that was manifest in their day they had rejected him he come the fullness that they saw in portion all of that collected together in fullness and now he paid the price of atonement and he comes down and he tells them you're condemned for rejecting they weren't rejecting jesus christ as a son of man nailed to a cross they were rejecting that part of the word that they faced in their day and they didn't get a second chance he came down to preach the souls that were in prison now and then he came back to his disciples and it wasn't a public show this time it was a behind closed doors private ministry i'm hoping that as we go through this we'll see our day and begin to recognize the third pool that we're so jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holden that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad and the one of them whose name was cleopas answered said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed in word before god and all the people and how the chief priest and our and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should redeem israel he was saying we trusted but he wasn't saying that he was still trusting they had they had trusted amen that it would be that it would be he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulcher and when they found not his body they came saying that they that they had also seen a vision of angels which had said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even as the woman had said the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to entered into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets this is a long sermon i think i think that jesus could have said i take for my context the entire bible i think he could have said that amen does that sound familiar and beginning at moses and all the prophets expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself what was he doing he was opening the mystery of the old testament and they drew nigh into the village whether they went and he made his dough he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them and it came to pass as he said at meet with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sights so now in the resurrection ministry now this is this is so critical just just oh if we could just get rid of everything we ever thought we knew amen and just take a fresh look amen in the resurrection ministry he now comes to them in another form and he comes and he begins to walk with them and he's questioning them why they're so sad and what's happening and they begin to ask and they just begin to explain to him the situation in their situation they have no understanding of the word for their day they said we thought it was going to be the fulfillment of this scripture and they didn't fully understand the scripture so what jesus begins to do is he begins to preach out of them the mystery of the old testament and and for his text he takes the entire old testament and as they walk along the road he preaches it but moses and all the prophets all the scriptures concerning himself amen and and he preaches this and they still don't know who he is amen so now in the resurrection ministry jesus now comes in another form a form of a man a form of a human being amen but they don't recognize the form and in this form he begins to preach out of the word and he begins to break the word he begins to take the word and lay in the bible and begins to apply it to the day that they're living in and so now in the resurrection ministry jesus christ will come in another form and preach the word and so now we wonder what what what is all this about and what's going on and what's going on all around us it's the resurrection ministry and it's jesus christ in another form and he's come in the form of a preacher of a five-fold ministry and he's taking all of the scriptures and all of the prophets concerning the day in which you live and they're beginning to preach it and what is it it's jesus christ in another form and what the resurrection ministry because in the resurrection ministry he can preach the whole bible he can go back through the entire thing and take all of those scriptures and bring them to the mystery that is being revealed right before their eyes and then this is the resurrection ministry then when they get to their place that they're they're traveling to he acts as though he's going to go on and they constrain him to come in because in the resurrection ministry you have to invite him in and when he comes in to them to commune with them privately he breaks the bread and when he breaks the bread breaking the bread has everything to do with feeding the sheep amen with breaking the word when he breaks the bread then their eyes were open they recognized this is him and they recognized him in the way he broke the bread and so they knew him and he vanished out of their sight oh this is so good he vanished out of their sight because this wasn't the ministry the resurrection ministry is not going to be the ministry where jesus christ stays right beside you and does everything for you this is where jesus christ comes in you and begins to flow through you all he's got to do is bring you to the word amen and don't misunderstand what i'm saying just hang with me and i think you'll see what he's trying to bring them to the word amen then when they recognize that was him he leaves why does he leave amen because he already opened the mystery of the old testament to them and then he leaves do you know how disappointing that would feel they were walking sad because their master their friend their teacher the one whom they loved had been crucified and now they found out that his body was missing and there were stories floating around of visions of angels and they can't find his body and they're so distraught and now they they have him come in another form but they don't know it's him but this man begins to preach in such a way amen they begin to recognize that this is the truth that this was jesus christ he was the messiah for real we weren't wrong it was right it was true amen and then he breaks the bread and they say that's him and then he leaves and now we're going to start to realize what is the point of the resurrection ministry and the point of the resurrection ministry is to get the word to the elect verse 32 and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together in them that were with them saying the lord has risen indeed and hath appeared to simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread so now we find out that that now that they are walking ah they're walking in a six mile and brother ben calls it a six hour journey so it's it's 60 furlongs about six miles amen and brother bam saying it was about six hours and they're traveling and so everything is pointing to the fact that they're traveling through the through the six church ages amen so now they're moving away from jerusalem they're moving away from the origin of the church and they're traveling away for six miles they're traveling away for six hours amen for six church ages they're traveling away but in the seventh church age he's going to come in another form he's actually going to come at the end of the six and they're going to find out it was him all the way through and now he's going to come and in the seventh hour because they walk six hours amen but the seventh hour was inside now and in the seventh hour he breaks bread and the way he broke the bread brother man says he did it the way he did it before and when brother branham was here amen in his ministry was proving that he was doing what christ did before and when he broke the bread and he did it in such a way that they knew it was him amen and then he vanished and they said did not our hearts burn within us when he spoke to us along the way amen and they and then the same hour they ran back to jerusalem so six church ages they move away but in the seventh behind the closed door amen they have a private interview with jesus christ who breaks the bread in such a way they recognize that it's not a preacher amen it's not a six hour sermon anymore now it's christ jesus breaking the bread and when he breaks the bread in the same hour they return to jerusalem they go right back to the church they were supposed to be in the original all this speaks of the seven church ages then they began to tell them what had happened and as they just spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you but they were terrified and frightened and supposed that they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts behold my hands my feet which it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see me have and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have you hear any meat and they gave him a piece of broad fish and of a honeycomb and he took it and did eat before them and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all these things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures so in the resurrection ministry first he will open the scriptures then he will open your understanding to understand the scriptures i want you to see that this listen this is the resurrection ministry amen because before when he was in the first two pools he was preaching in parables and he was talking scriptures and he was talking parables amen and even the disciples didn't fully understand what he was preaching amen they just they knew it was the word they knew it was right and he was preaching in parables and he was preaching in mysteries and he was speaking the word and he was contending with the false religion and he was doing the signs of the messiah he was doing all that but now when we get to the resurrection ministry amen now we get to the to the ministry to the elect now he opens the scriptures and he opens their understanding to understand the scriptures and now something begins to change in the disciples because now they they saw the signs they saw the ones they were attracted amen to the messiah but now he begins to open the mystery that had been laying in the bible and so that they would understand the mystery because he's got to point them to the word listen he's got to point the disciples to the word because he is the word made flesh but his dispensation now was going to change amen and they had to catch the change and in order to catch the change they had to have confidence when they could no longer go to jesus and wake him up in the back of the boat and ask him a question and have him explain now they were under the ministry of the holy ghost amen the holy ghost anointing them to understand the mystery that jesus had unlocked to them and now he had to put confidence in the word because now all the answers are going to come from the word in the resurrection ministry he's going to open the scriptures and open their understanding of the scriptures and he's going to send them to the word because now from here on they're going to get all their answers out of the word praise be to god let's look at this quote and go tell my disciples from 1953 he said there was a couple by the name one of cleopas and so forth they was on the road to emmaus and they were going along sad hearted broken and they were going along talking about it oh how bad it was and all of a sudden someone stepped out of the bush as an ordinary man not his collar turned around or any different dress are you catching it he dressed like the rest of man he wore his hair and his beard just like the rest of them it wasn't any different he didn't make any great difference his life proved what his credentials what he was and that's what god wants us to be wants our life to prove our credentials he comes in the message events made clear by prophecy i want you to understand brother branham is preaching events made clear by prophecy he also titles that modern events made clear by prophecy when he preaches another time and brother madam is trying to get the people to see the modern events taking place around them make clear by prophecy so brother ben was not preaching a historical teaching here he's not trying to take us to go back and look at something back in the bible he's trying to take the bible and to unlock to open the scriptures so you can see the prophecy for your day in an event made clear by prophecy he says now notice now quickly now don't miss this now here is the text how jesus made himself known to those disciples that he was their messiah now think about what he said he said don't miss this now here is the text how jesus made himself known to these two disciples that he was their messiah don't miss this this is how jesus teaches his disciples that he's the messiah and he wasn't going to heal them they weren't going to see a visible pillar of fire he was going to open to them the scriptures to prove to them he was the messiah now all eyes this way brother bennett says that's interesting and out in the land don't miss this now we've tried to tell you that the bible is the word of god wrote by god himself through the lips and instrumentality of man god can write himself so i'm going to pull several quotes out of a this is a long quote but i'm pulling segments out of it out of events made clear by prophecy he goes on to say now notice how jesus the word made these two heartbroke disciples know he was their messiah the question is how did he make them know that he was their messiah he came in another form and their eyes were holding to who he was so how would he identify his presence how would he identify who he is amen the way he would identify it is he would begin at moses and with all the prophets he would speak all the scriptures concerning himself he would show them amen he would show him by the word amen and then they would take the word and and then when he got behind closed doors he would do something like he did before and then he would break the bread in such a way that they knew only he can break the bread like that nobody else can break the bread like that only the messiah can break the bread like that amen it wasn't brother branham who opened those seals only the lamb can take the book and only the lamb can break that bread amen and he come in our day and he broke bread like no man could break bread there's only one that can break the bread like that there's only one that could break those seals and that's the lamb and that wasn't brother branham that was jesus christ that was the one who broke those seals and he broke the bread in such a way amen that you said that's him that's the messiah this is how he makes his presence known notice how jesus the word made these two heartbroken disciples know he was their messiah the messiah the promised word notice what he done he appealed to prophecy full slowed to believe all that the prophets wrote now he never said well what does the church say about it notice how he approached the subject he never come right out and said i'm your messiah he could have done it for he was but notice he identified himself in the word then they would know listen this is the resurrection ministry of jesus christ the resurrecting ministry of jesus christ did not stand up and say i'm the messiah i look at the pillar of fire come to me the mid the resurrection ministry of jesus christ and the third pool to his elect came and he broke the word to them and he broke the bread in such a way they knew nobody else there's nobody that can break bread that like that and he identified it was him he could have done it for he was but notice he identified himself in the word then they would know if he'd have said it he would have said that that and it would have been so but when he went and began to speak on the prophets about him and they seen it then they could tell themselves if they were god's children he didn't come out and directly say it he just showed it in the word and if they're god's children they could catch it but called their attention to what the prophets had foretold and said to look for in the time that the messiah his age would be manifested he as john let the word the bible identify their message here he never changes his way of doing it never has changed this is the resurrection ministry he's never changed his way of doing it it never has changed so the thing is do you want to see jesus today look for him in the resurrection ministry he never changed his way of doing it never has changed he never can change because he's the unchanging god see notice he went right back to those two disciples cleopas and his friend on the road to emmaus and said appealed to the scriptures to them said why are you so foolish to not believe that every word the prophets wrote concerning the messiah would have to be fulfilled oh what a day john did the same thing search the scriptures look back and said there'd be a voice of one crying in the wilderness where did i come from see that's that should have made it plain to them right should make it plain today and the thing that we see the holy spirit doing he once said search the scriptures he wants us to do it today he wants to do the same thing today it was now beginning to soak into them he had done told them they were fools for not looking at the prophecy for that day and now it begin to soak in begin to see the fulfilling of all this that had taken place in the last few days in the last two or three years the vindicated prophecy of the age it was then that they knew that their crucified friend jesus had fulfilled every word of this oh it was then that they know that that man truly was that messiah what identified it the word the word coming into fulfillment the word being made manifest is what identified it that man truly was the messiah that he should raise from the dead the grave couldn't hold him i will not suffer my holy one to see corruption there's not one word of prophecy can ever fail and he did raise then that messenger's down at the tomb this morning was right he is risen from the dead he is alive he is that messiah why don't fail it his action his ministry and everything he's done has been vindicated exactly the words that the prophet said would take place for this day that's done it then they know that it was him their crucified friend jesus that had done it no wonder their hearts burned within them as he talked to them now they had walked six miles and it seemed like a short time and here's another thing they had done you know they had heard a six-hour sermon on prophecy being vindicated brother branham preached a six hour sermon called spoken word is the original seed so they had heard a six hour sermon and so see in the resurrection ministry jesus come in another form i just like to say it this way so that we can understand he come in the form of a preacher and he began to preach to them a sermon on fulfilled prophecy and he took the whole bible for his text that's what he talked to them along the road just as soon as they started down the road he stepped out for he was right there at jerusalem six hours later 60 furlongs they was right down the road six miles to emmaus that's what it is and he had preached confirmed the prophecy for six hours don't condemn me on my three then see but notice they had preached they had heard a six-hour sermon on prophecy being confirmed vindicated now i was getting along towards evening time you know he's the same yesterday today and forever why did he say that because this is the evening time it's getting along towards evening time and brother brennaman just he's the same yesterday today and forever because brother branham does not want you to leave this in luke 24 he wants you to bring it right to the day that he was at he's the same yesterday today and forever at the evening time events are made clear by the prophecy what's taking place in the modern hour can be easily identified if you'll just believe the prophecy of the hour yes full slow of understanding slow to believe you keep pondering over it to believe that all the prophets said about the messiah wouldn't have to happen now he checked these points all back and showed what the prophet said that would happen then they begin to understand so he said act like he was going to go on by they liked this man they said you've given us something we never thought that he is alive somewhere they was talking to him and didn't know it and no doubt he looked at them sadly and he started to walk on by but he was waiting for them to invite him that's what he's waiting tonight for you to invite him oh friends amen listen their hearts were burning within them as he talked to them along the way what was making their hearts burn amen it was modern events made clear by prophecy it was the preaching amen it was jesus christ in a form that another form a form they didn't recognize and he was in the form of a preacher taking the word and bringing the word to the modern day he was taking the prophecy and explaining the situation in their life explaining what was going on all around them by the prophecy and their hearts were burning within them i'm telling you if you've sat here in this church in that same condition then it's time for you to invite him in if your heart's burning under the preaching of the word amen it's not a man in the pulpit it's jesus christ working through the offices that he put into a church and he's here what's he here doing he's here taking the entire bible amen from moses all the way through to revelation and what he's doing he's explaining the events that are all around us going on in your life going on in my life going on in the world he's doing it by the prophecy and our hearts are burning within us but he's waiting for you to invite him in it's not about a good sermon it's not about a good sermon or a good day at church i i like that preacher that was a good sermon go to church we've heard a good sermon today we heard the word we go out we have a meal we start back over on monday that's not the point he's here the presence of the bridegroom is here if all we heard was a good sermon and it was exciting and we went and ate and we had some fellowship and we went back monday and did the same thing amen we missed the whole point because he's come in another form he's in the form of his bride and that bride has a fightful ministry amen and it's him it's got to be him and he's here and what's he doing he's taking the prophecy for the day and he's beginning to reveal modern events by prophecy he's taking the whole bible and using the whole bible to show them the mystery that has been revealed in their day and their hearts were burning within them amen but he's never he's a gentleman and he's never going to force himself upon them their hearts were burning they were awakening to the realization they were getting excited amen and when it came time he wanted to come in to commune with them but he's a gentleman so he's going to walk by and he's waiting for them to say won't you come inside won't you come in and they constrained him to come in and why they say it is now late and the day is far spent i'm telling you it is late and the day is far spans we are at the end of the end of the end of the end it is late and the day is far spent don't let him walk on by amen don't let him make your heart burn don't let him take all this time in his preaching of his word to connect the dots so you can have an excitement and enthusiasm and then let him walk on by it's time to say would you come and commune with me and constrain him to come in and say no you've got to come in you've got to stay here it's the day is far spent it is late and the day is far spent you've got to come here when you come in on a private communion in the house then he broke a revelation and when he broke a revelation privately to them not a public show not a public work when he broke a revelation privately to them now they knew who had been preaching that morning they knew it was him it was him notice when these disciples invited him in their fellowship around the table it was then that he'd done something just like he did before his crucifixion and their eyes come open they knowed his manner his style they knowed what he'd done oh just catch that friends they knowed his manner they knowed his style they knowed what he'd done and he did it then just like he did before and they said that's him and quickly they raised up to scream it out and he vanished and there they took six hours to listen to a sermon maybe 20 minutes they were light-footed back to tell the rest of them he is risen indeed he is really alive friends this is the fulfillment of malachi 4 saint luke 17 saint john 15. also many revelations 10 so many prophecies that can be pinned exactly to this day brother brethren was saying all of those things about the road to a mass so that the people would understand that the same thing's happening right in front of you he preached a six hour sermon don't get after me for my three he's still preaching through the preacher amen it's still him in another form in his third pool ministry not a public show amen he wants to come in to your dwelling he wants to have a communion with you amen and if your heart is burning amen say come come lord jesus commune with me and let him break the bread in a way that you know it's him but brother branham ends this he said friends it's the fulfillment of malachi 4. luke 17 saint john 15 oh so many revelations 10. i am showing them the prophecy for their day i want you to turn with me to revelation chapter 10 revelation chapter 10. and verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets we believe that brother branham was preaching the fulfillment of that in his day but i want to continue reading the scriptures and it said in verse 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is in the open hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth now he's speaking to john and john is the type of the bride and he went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto him take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings i just want to say this day this scripture is being fulfilled the book has been opened the mighty angel has come down he's tore the seals off and then he's given it to the messenger of the age he's given it out to the bride and now it's time for that bride to take and eat the book become one with the revelation of the mystery and to prophesy again because he has no mouth but yours no hands but yours no feet but yours and mine and the in the literacy and church age of the church book he said there will be a voice in the last days of the people of his age and that voice will be in the bride she will be the final voice to the final age there is still a resurrection ministry on the earth the third pull is still going on and the third pull is the opening of the word not any new word the prophet already opened it see let's turn to john chapter 20. john chapter 20. and i want to begin at verse 14. and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus this is mary we read this in our opening scripture he revealed himself first into mary and she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus so here he appears to her in another form this is a common theme he appeared to her in another form jesus said unto her woman why weepest thou whom seeketh thou she supposing him to be the gardener she thought that he was somebody else amen she thought that he was the gardener say then to him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and i will take him away jesus said unto her mary she turned herself and saith unto him rabbone which is to say master amen all of a sudden she she was talking to jesus jesus came to her in another form he was in a form of flesh but it was a form of flesh that she was not recognizing catch that he was in a form of flesh but it was a form of flesh she was not recognizing amen and she supposed him to be the gardener she thought he was the pastor because he comes in another form but then she's asking will they have taken my lord wherever they laid him just show me and i'll go get him and all he does is call her by name and when he calls her by name her eyes open and she says that's not the gardener that's the messiah that's jesus christ that's my lord and he reveals by calling her name amen he reveals who he is by calling her name he doesn't say i'm the messiah i'm jesus christ he calls her name he identifies her in identifying her he reveals who he is and that's why it comes in the first seal and brother ben said i no longer call you church but i call you bride so that you'll get it amen he's giving her her identification and identifying her he's revealing who it is behind the veil amen that prophet was just the veil it was god elohim and flesh the flesh of that prophet but it was god himself who was revealing you to you praise god brother bram says in questions and answers on the seals so he said no nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world jew or gentile see that's all the book holds the mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names amen he's revealing the mystery of the book and while he's revealing the mystery of the book it's calling the names revealing the word for your day is calling your name positionally placing you telling you who you are revealing the mystery of the bible to you he says you understand now the book doesn't say now leave veil is to be saved in times of church age or ormond neville or whosoever no it don't say that it just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is but we ourselves by faith believe it he goes on to say christ is mystery god revealed he says now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him oh that's the believer what's the believer the words in the book what's the words in the book it's the bible what's the bible the bible contains a mystery the bible has been sealed amen and the mystery has been sealed in the bible i mean everybody's been able to read the words but they haven't been able to understand the mystery it's like in the old testament they could read the old testament but they didn't understand the mystery and when the mystery was revealed it was that god would come in the form of flesh as his own son and become the sacrifice to die for all of mankind and they didn't know that that baby in the manger was the words on that book when he was standing there amen they didn't understand the mystery amen and the mystery of the new testament is the bride and it's been laying in the old testament the mystery of the bible is adam and his wife restored back into fellowship back to a garden of eden now mystery's been laying in that word and as he's revealing the mystery he's calling the names because what's the believer the words on the book because the book is about the elect it's about christ male and female and christ is the expression of god and so now the words on the book and the word is him and that's in that he come forth for this book of redemption those names are written on the book before the foundational world when he was slain as a lamb praise be to god in the resurrection ministry he takes the scriptures and he comes in another form and he explains the scriptures concerning their day and their hearts burn within them along the way then he comes in privately and breaks the bread and they know that that's our lord he does something the way he's done it before then he comes in and he reveals himself amen he reveals himself to his disciples and then he opens their understanding to understand the scriptures then he commissions them to take the revelation of the mystery out into the world this is the resurrection ministry when jesus resurrected he did not gather a crowd he did not have a campaign he did not have a healing service not in this third floor of his ministry was there still miracles absolutely amen when they when they when he told them to cast a net on the right side and they caught a load of fish even they had toiled all night and caught no fish there was still miracles in the third pool amen there was still the miraculous all around him but it was not a public show he never he didn't feed 5 000 in his resurrection ministry the 40 days that he was on earth he didn't feed the five thousand he didn't heal all that were around about the country that were brought unto him but in in that ministry in that in that third pool ministry in the resurrection ministry he begins to take the word and explain to them the day they're living and by the word amen and opens to them the scriptures and then opens to them their understanding of the scriptures and he calls mary's name and in calling her name he opens her eyes to who he is you see how the resurrection ministry was different than the first and second pool praise god it was different for a reason now he wanted them to catch the word because he needed them to become the manifestation of that word and now they by catching the word amen and receiving the spirit of god that would quicken that word that's in them to life now they would catch that mystery and they would go forth and now they would be the light of the world let's go to john 21 the gospel of john chapter 21 in verse 1. after these things jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise on this why showed he himself they were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael cana and galilee and the sons of zebedee and two others his disciples simon peter saith unto them i go fishing they say unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus then jesus said unto them children have you any meat they answered him no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and you shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for multitude of fishes i mean there's several ways you can look at this but i just think it's interesting that jesus when he refers to the catching of fish he's saying children have you any meat what is the children's meat what is a it's the word we live off the word and they've toiled all night by themselves and they have caught nothing but jesus when he stands and when he begins to direct and he says cast thy net on the right side he asked did you catch any meat do you have any food he said no we've tried we've read the bible all night long and read it through and we're fishermen amen we're preachers we've been the civilian there we've done this our whole life we're professionals at catching meat we've been trained by our daddy all of our life generationally we are preachers we're good at catching meat amen and jesus want to show them their insufficiency their insufficiency to be able to feed themselves and he said children this is his resurrection ministry children have you any meat no and he says cast on the other side amen and they cost so much amen they could not even hardly they could even bring it into the ship jesus knows where the fish are in the deep he knows where the meat is and he says now children have you any meat they answered him no and he said unto them cast you the net on the right side of the ship and you shall find and they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fish well yeah because you always got to go to the right side you can't be on the wrong side without jesus you're fishing on the wrong side in his resurrection he'll bring you to the right side therefore that disciple verse 7 therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord that disciple whom jesus loved was john and john was a type of the bride and now there's seven in this boat representing the seven churches there's seven in this boat amen and jesus comes when they've toiled all night amen they've been in night they've been in darkness they haven't been able to catch anything and jesus comes and he says cast on the right side and they when when he does something like he did before because he did this for these fishermen before they had labored all night and toiled and caught nothing and jesus says cast back out and they said we've labored all night not caught anything it's worthless he said cast off he said now let down thy net and they had so much the net was breaking they had to call other fishermen in to help them so now when john when he recognizes he's doing something like he did before when he recognizes this this i recognize this this is familiar to me i've seen this before i've heard this before and it was the bride amen it was the bride it was john who said it's the lord amen it's not just a man who knows where the fish is it's not just a man who took a guess it was a man who knew exactly where the fish was it was the man who created the fish it was the man who placed the fish and john says it's the lord now when simon peter heard this it was the lord he girded his fisher's coat unto him for he was naked and then cast himself into the sea and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes as soon then as they were come to the land they saw a fire of coals there in fish layer and bread jesus was going to feed them himself he supernaturally had fish that they didn't catch because see jesus can always break the bread he can always bring the broiled fish amen he can always he wants to feed his children amen and it was fish that they didn't catch in a fire called there and fish laid there on and bread and jesus said to them bring of the fish which ye have now caught simon peter went and drew the net to land full of great fishes 150 and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken jesus said unto them come and dine and none of the disciples just asked him who art thou knowing that it was the lord listen this is a strange way to write this verse it's very strange none of them are asking if he looked exactly the same why would the scripture be written this way he must have come in another form and nobody durst asked him who are they because they knew it was the lord well if he looked exactly the same that's self-explanatory you wouldn't write the verse that way there's a mystery hidden between the lines he appeared yet in another form amen but he was identified by telling them where to catch the fish doing something he had done before and the bride recognized that's the lord she recognized amen i've seen this before i went through this before this is familiar to me he's done that's the messiah he's the only one that can do that and they don't even ask him who he is because they know by revelation not by facial structure they know by his works and his word that it's him how was he identified in the third pool how was he identified in the resurrection ministry this is how again then said that he did them come and dine and none of the disciples there's ask him who art thou knowing that it was the lord jesus then cometh and take his bread and giveth them and and fish likewise this is now the third time that jesus showed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas loveth thou me more than these we know the whole uh conversation here he asked him but he's telling him feed my lambs feed my sheep feeding my sheep and he gets down to verse 18 he says verily verily i say unto thee when thou was young thou girdest thyself and walketh wither thou wouldas but when thou shalt be old thou shall stretch forth thy hand and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not then spakey signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he had spoken this he said unto him follow me so when jesus comes in his resurrection ministry he comes to take peter and positionally place him and put peter in a position of service and he's now asking peter to feed my lambs to feed my sheep and he begins to he begins to give him his calling his election his positional placing he's now bringing peter into adoption in verse 20 then peter turned about and saith seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast this is the type of john this is john type of the bride to also lean on his breasts as supper and said lord which is he that betrayed which is he that betrayeth thee that's the question john asked the lord peter seeing him sayeth to jesus lord and what shall this man do jesus saith in him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me so in the resurrection ministry jesus comes to deal with the individual one man one person it has nothing to do with your neighbor has nothing to do with the next person in the aisle over the next seat over amen he's coming to bring you to adoption to bring you to a placing to call you to a work in the kingdom and he doesn't he's not going to tell you about nobody else because in this third pool ministry the third pull ministry is to one individual it's the one he's to give you your calling he's the position he placed you and the body and he's to call you unto your work amen not everybody else not a group this isn't the group it's the individual that's why christ is the mystery god revealed is the individual to the individual one person and now in the resurrection ministry it's to the one person for their calling in their positional place peter says well what about this one what's that to you follow thou me let's turn to ephesians 5. there's a couple other things i want to look at here and i want to take my time ephesians chapter 5 verse 25. before we read that i just want to review because i'm going to i'm going to go down another little path for just a moment in the resurrection ministry there were no more campaigns it's not that there weren't any more miracles and there wasn't that there wasn't the power anymore it was all there were no more campaigns this wasn't first and second form it was not a public show in jesus resurrected ministry he was just coming to his elect and the purpose of coming to elect was to open to the scriptures and to open their understanding of the scriptures to call their name so that they would know who he is in the day and hour that they live so that he could positionally place them in the body as an individual in adoption so that he could send them out now as the light bearers in the mystery revealed do you see the resurrection ministry is it going on today absolutely in the resurrection ministry you can't go to him in the first and second pool when they found out that jesus was in a city all the all the little cities and tribes all around they would gather all their sick and they would come to him but in the third pool you can't come to him he has to come to you it's to the elect and in the first and second pool you could gather your sick you could go for a miracle you'd go for a healing you could you could see discernment you could do all of these things but in the third pool you can't go to him because he's not in a church he's not in a city he appears and vanishes comes behind closed doors where they're locked in hiding amen reveals something to them and vanishes out of their sight he steps out of the bushes brother benham says on the road to emmaus and begins to walk with just those two tell me how could the disciples go to him in the resurrection ministry where do you find him where does he dwell in the third pool ministry once he commissioned the disciples to carry the word now there's an ethiopian eunuch that ethiopian eunuch he goes up to jerusalem because that's where he used to find him but now he's in his resurrection and he's not there anymore and he can't find the lord he can't get the answers to his biblical questions and so now god is going jesus christ is going to appear to the eunuch in another form and it's going to be the form of philip and he's going to speak to philip by an angel he's going to say go down by the wilderness there and go where i tell you and he leaves samaria and he goes down here and he's waiting and now this ethiopian eunuch is coming down because the ethiopian eunuch tried to go to god but in the third pool you don't go to him he comes to you i want to ask you those of you who god had called from denominations and out in the world and called to this message did you come to the message or the message come to you amen did you hunt for him or did he hunt for his lost sheep and the resurrection ministry he comes for his elect now the ethiopian eunuch writing down reading isaiah not understanding the scriptures couldn't find god up in all those theologians and formal religion but god is going to come to him in another form it's going to be in the form of philip because philip is part of the body philip is part of the body the flesh and bone of the lord that's the scriptures that's just the bible and now it is once again by the baptism of the holy ghost amen it is now jesus christ in flesh again the flesh of his church and now he's coming in philip and he tells him draw to that chariot draws up alongside that chair and he hears him reading and he says understand us thou what thou readest he says how can i let some man show me and philip beginning at that scripture that scripture unlocked to him the mystery of christ beginning of that scripture that wasn't the only scripture he began at that scripture beginning at that scripture he unlocked unto him the mystery of christ and when they got done he says what does hinder me to be baptized here's water he says thou believe with all thy heart he says i believe and he takes him down and he baptizes him and after he baptized him guess what happens to philip he doesn't start a church he doesn't invite him to his church he doesn't pro he vanishes he's gone because he served his purpose because jesus christ and the resurrection ministry came to that eunuch in another form because jesus christ was getting ready to go down to ethiopia in another form and now he was going to go down in the form of this ethiopian eunuch because brother bam said he took the message down to ethiopia praise god in the resurrection ministry they have the day of pentecost and then day of pentecost the holy ghost falls upon them they begin speaking with other tongues they spill out onto the street there are so many there gathered at the feast of pentecost that all heard them speaking in their own language and it caught the attention now i just want you to catch what i'm saying it caught the attention of the crowd but speaking with tongues and them hearing in their own language did not bring a conversion it just got their attention because they began to question it and condemn it and they said these men are drunk being but the third hour of the day and peter stood up in their midst being filled with the holy ghost he stood and said these men are not drunk as you suppose but this is the scriptures these modern events i'm going to make clear to you by the scriptures this is what the prophet joel said this is what david said and he preached to them a sermon out of the scriptures and when he opened to them the scriptures is that what happened is that what peter was doing after he opened to them the scriptures at the opening of the word in verse 37 and acts 2 it says then their hearts were pricked and they said men and brethren what must we do and he said repent and be baptized in the name of lord jesus christ for the mission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost see the hearing the tongues and their own ears didn't prick their heart the sign and the wonder attracted their attention but it didn't change their heart and they misunderstood the sign and were condemning it as something evil it wasn't bringing conversion it was bringing their attention to now where christ was because christ is now in his bride and peter stands up and begins to open to them the scriptures concerning what concerning their day the prophecy of joel the prophecy of david in their day and when they saw the opening of the word their hearts were pricked and then they were converted i hope you see this cycle i hope you understand what the third pull is now let's go to ephesians let's go to ephesians 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word now i want you to catch this phrase christ also loved the church and gave himself for it so he died for it he gave himself for it that he might so now we're going to see the purpose of his death all right do you understand that in the scriptures he loved it and gave himself for it that he might so now we're going to look at the reason he gave himself for the church or the purpose of his death he gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that it might be holy and without blemish so what men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherishes that even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and a mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ in this church he was typing the natural marriage but he was actually speaking of christ in his church and now he was telling us the reason that jesus gave himself for the church he gave it so that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of water of the word why he wanted to present that bride to himself without spot without blemish without wrinkle without any such thing so that that they too could be one so that he could unite with her so that she would be his body his flesh his bone that's the reason he died now let's go to christ as the mystery god revealed and see what the prophet says here he says you think i'm beside myself i'm not we've got the devil's answer not me that liveth but christ the word living in me it's not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here and here it is we gotta answer answer christ has risen and has paid the price for a redemption what god in christ manifested he gave that flesh that and blood that it that the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed that god in his redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day he said woo glory you see it oh my when can i stop notice it then you stand justified in the presence of god as a drop of ink dropped into the tub full of bleach you'll never find the stain of ink no more it went somewhere it'll never come back again and when man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished he didn't mention any work you have to do he said that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished it's gone it's separated it's dropped in the ink of the blood of jesus christ and it's never to be remembered god forgets it and he stands as a son and daughter of god in the presence of god now you are the sons of god not we will be we are now we are redeemed we have satan's answer god has vindicated himself god here amen christ the risen lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer that's the reason when this man sitting here dropped dead the other day sitting here we could say come back life because the holy spirit said so that's why i could do that that little baby yonder in mexico had been dead for about 15 hours when the vision came and said call it back to life and said let the baby live and the baby that doctors wrote a statement died at nine o'clock that morning and 11 o'clock that night came back to life it's living today what is it not them people the headship and the body has become one unit it's god manifested in his people he's come in another form that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer twain they're one god in his church is one christ in you god's great revelation glory to god even bearing his name his name is jesus the anointed the reason he's called jesus he is the anointed it's the anointed body of christ proving manifesting god like that body did and that body redeemed every of these bodies and through there god works his threefold manifest manifestation going to the kingdom risen paid the price we're redeemed god has proved it vindicated it and we stand justified in christ before him because he cannot pass judgment for he's already judged that body in which i am a part of how am i a part of it here it is it's in me if you abide in me and my words and you then and ask the father anything in my name it'll be done because it's their justified glory to god oh if i could get the world to see that why there you are there is the body of christ living standing redeemed redeemed oh my justified in his sight why are we justified we are his victory now he says why are we justified because he had to justify us because he wants to unite with us so that we can be his body his flesh his bones he said justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in this last day with his glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory amen when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us that's right and we're already potentially arise because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational creeds to an eternal word of the eternal god which is him himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever and then the world comes on the the world word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that the same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one they are husband and wife their flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of the spirit amen how do you know it bears the same record same fruit same word see manifest christ same life same god same spirit same word same book amen same science things that i do shall you do also oh hallelujah notice the vindicated word in his body is his very victory and the reason of his death so why did he die so that he could sanctify you by the washing of the water of the word so he can wash you from all the filth of these prostitutes so that he could present to himself what does it mean to present himself to come into a marriage union to present to himself a bride without sparta wrinkle why she's been washed from these prostitute spirits she's been washed from this religious this religious false vine that come from all the way back in the beginning this word the washing of the water of the word is washing her and separating her back from cain's religion so that she can be without spot or wrinkle so that he can unite with her so that the two can be one flash so that we can be his body his flesh his bones that's a tight uniting friends so the the vindicated word in his body is his victory the word the headship moving down into the body is his victory and the reason of his death see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell and preached the souls in prison that's right his flesh only died when he raised it up again and quickened it quickened means made alive his flesh which was his body and that's the word it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation and now she's standing upon her feet what is it it's the resurrection this is the resurrection season and the bride will have a resurrection ministry what will the resurrection ministry look like like the resurrection ministry i want to look at two more scriptures and read a few more quotes but let's go to colossians keep your place in ephesians we'll come back to ephesians let's look in colossians chapter 1 verse 26 colossians 1 26 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations that now has made manifest to the saints and whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory this was the purpose of his death and this is his victory ephesians 1 and 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he rotten christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principalities and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and have put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body so the church is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all the church is to be his body is to be the fullness or filled with him that filleth all in all this is the scripture where brother branham gets all that god was he poured into christ this scripture is speaking this and all that christ was he pulled into his body that they might be the head over the body the fullness of him that filleth all in all all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured into his church this is the reason of his death this is his victory now i want to read a couple quotes he said look here now we find remember we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones as god raised his bones and flesh out of the grave they cannot hide the man that has the potentials death cannot take him jesus said all the father has given me will come to me i'll raise him up at the last day oh my easter why we're right in easter when he raised we raised with him he sent the abstract back we hold it as the baptism of the holy ghost he is alive forevermore the same yesterday today and forever hebrews 13 8 proves that he's the same his messianic anointed ones believes that what is the messiah what is the messiah messiah is anointed one and now if he was the messiah by being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of god to be the redeemer and the anointed one and god raised up that body his bride is the anointed one for this day because his bride is the anointed one for this day it's already raised up with him in the resurrection because these two are one the anointed one for this day is jesus christ in the formation of his bride she's anointed with this spirit she's bearing his life he's been given his word and he came in the resurrection ministry and in the resurrection third paul ministry he came to open the scriptures to to open their understanding of the scriptures to call their name to place them in adoption as an individual and i'd like to say that that ministry continues on in the bride today what what ministry or should we she i say what ministry should we be looking for we should be looking for a third pool ministry this is the opening of the word brother branham he says in 1963 and the greater than solomon is here said those that the section by section alright he's calling them prayer line that those that are in the back there that's holding the prayer card step right out in front of the line there right section now i want you to know my brother and sisters that you don't have to wait for some special advantages to come by no no your pastor is the same now he may he may not be able to have the prophetic gift that comes in once once in a generation but look he has the same rights to pray for you that i would that discernment doesn't heal you it only brings you god conscious that you are in the presence of god there's a reason that i want to say that i i've received several comments recently and it's been going on now for about two years but but i get it almost every service that somebody will come to me and be like brother chad everything you said was word for word a conversation we had yesterday does that happen to any of you said i asked my wife a question i asked this brother question i asked i asked my husband a question and the next service or two services you came and you answered exactly what the question was i i had one brother the other day come to me and he said he said uh brother chad he said did you talk to brother so-and-so it was after the sermon i said no he said you didn't talk to him i said no he said you should talk to him i said i'm not going to talk to him i've already got my trainer at the hot i'm not going to talk to him two weeks later i speak to that other brother and that other brother said oh you talked to brother son so i said no i never talked to that brother he said you didn't talk to that brother i said no he said i was sure that next service should talk to that brother i said i never said a word to him he said i just knew you talked to him and then the brother began to weep he said because it was exactly not close but exactly word for word there's a reason i'm going through all this so relax relax it's happening more and more and more more frequently with more intensity i see people sometimes in the service i'll say something they'll smile and look over like this trying to get somebody's attention across the room and i have no idea what i said to cause that reaction but i know they're they're doing like looking over i heard stories of people who will oh as quick as they can they want to get out in the fore and said did you talk to him then did you talk to him i just want to i want to say this for a reason the discernment doesn't heal you it only brings you god conscience that you're in the presence of god because it's the person of the word because the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart see brother branham had a prophetic gift and he had a gift of discernment amen but i have no gift of discernment now god is taking the word and by the word he is bringing discernment into our lives accurate spot on shocking discernment into our lives but he's not doing it through a gift of discernment because i don't have the gift of discernment and it proves that it has nothing to do with the man standing in the pulpit because that man doesn't have that gift if i had that gift it would be an operation of the gift but it's not an operation of the gift so it has to be an operation of the word which is evidence that the bridegroom is here telling you what you talked about in your bed chamber [Applause] people have asked me they said you want i got a text from a sister one time said no fair you're listening to my prayers i'm not listening to anything i have no idea i have no idea when it happens except when people are craning their neck to see if somebody else heard it one brother told me the other day he said i i he because i almost got to the point where i stood i'm saying like do you hear that but if if i had a gift of discernment then it would be the operation of a gift but that is not the operation of a gift of discernment the only gift i have is a gift of a pastor the gift of a preacher it's the bridegroom himself is here he's the one who's listening he's the one who knows he's answering the questions he's discerning the situation he's giving the answers why because he's the word and when the word is in place the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the word is a healer the word is a deliverer the word is a provider you don't need the man with the gift you just need to be a yielded vessel because the the bridegroom is here amen the clouds show that the headship was coming to unite with the bride the bridegroom is here and if the bridegroom is here there's nothing that he can't answer through that word this is the resurrected ministry of jesus christ where he takes the word and he he brings discernment by the word somebody will say to me but it said you said you said everything we said the other day and and they'll say when you said this this and this and i'm like i don't even remember saying this this and this like i don't even remember preaching that so what is that the intelligence of man no it's the presence of the bridegroom the bridegroom is here he's the strong man in the house he's the one who's making sure that this bride won't fail he's the one discerning situations he's the one answering questions he's the one bringing correction to wrong thinking and the wrong understanding it's the presence of the bridegroom why because he promised that he would have a bride without spot or wrinkle and you and i can't do it friends amen and just the gifted man he can't do it either it's got to be the bridegroom himself to make sure that he's going to present himself a bride without spot or wrinkle and how is he going to do it by the washing of the water of the word amen it becomes shocking it happens to me when i sit in my seat me and my wife will be elbowing each other like and she'll look at me and smile and i'll be smiling through my mask or her because it was something we just said something we just talked about a question that we had it's not one preacher it's all of them because the bridegroom is here because our your bridegroom your mate is the revealed word for the hour and when you've accepted the leadership of the bridegroom listen understand me when you've accepted the leadership by submission submitting to the leadership of the bridegroom it's the leadership of the word for your day and under the leadership of your bridegroom now the bridegroom comes down and is the strong man of the house and the strong man of the house will say be careful there watch out for that this is good go there don't go there oh the other day you were wondering about this oh when you were wondering why brother brenham said that this is the reason why praise god we can all rejoice and shout because we know my husband is here the bridegroom is here and he hears me in my conversation he hears me when i pray and he's answering back according to his method to answer back us through the preaching of the word and he's promised that he would do it he's doing it because there's no way it's that man there i've had funny encounters it's comical to me i've had funny encounters with people who have really never met me and never known me but they've only understood they've only listened to sermons and you meet them and you can tell when you begin to talk you know i'm not i'm not super social and i'm not the most observant person in the world i'm sorry i'm not sentimental really not overly affectionate i mean i love people but you can tell that after a conversation they're a little bit disappointed because there's just a man and then there's god working through a gift and people expect you to be the same person out of the pool that you are inappropriate and it's not even the same because if you just yield yourself then it's not you anymore you're just standing by when he said that and i feel bad sometimes because sometimes i disappoint new people because it's it's not a powerful preacher it's not a powerful sermon it's not a great teacher gift of discernment isn't that it's the bridegroom himself all he needs is somebody who will surrender to the headship all he needs is a people who will say we want that headship we want you to be our headship we don't want our own way we want to lay our life down and submit to this word a hundred percent he doesn't want a woman who'll go our way and take her own thing and work her own job and solve her own problems and buy her own this he doesn't want that kind of woman he wants a woman who will be surrendered to him so that he can be the strongman of the house so he can be the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen but when you take the word down you're going to have to find a strong man somewhere we don't want a strong man we want christ the king amen we want our husband here we want him to do it through the weakness of man not the strength of man because we don't want to exalt men we don't want anybody to get out of position we want christ to be in position we want it to be him he's our lover he's our mate he's our guide he's our protector he's the one who makes sure that the that the kirby sweeper salesman is not taking advantage of you you guys are under 30 don't even know what i'm talking about because he comes in like a slicker tries to sell the product going door to door and begins to begins to flatter wife oh you've got a beautiful home you're a good housekeeper [Music] your husband must be so lucky i've got a vacuum cleaner that'll change your life but you know if the husband's home when he comes to the door that sweeper system starts talking differently we don't want to be an independent woman we don't want to stick up for ourselves defend ourselves figure anything out for ourselves we don't want to be smart we don't want to be strong we don't want to be anything we just want to be his amen we want him to be on the scene he's the strongman of the house he's keeping the the salesman run out of the house selling this religious idea and that religious idea and this compromise we want the bridegroom here to say no we don't need it amen no we don't want it thank you but that's okay we're fine hallelujah it's not her it's him i want to read a couple things here along this line brother ben said in 1955 shows the father now i believe he's here with his people and just as a divine gift it does not heal anyone it only raises their faith to a place so you can accept your healing the same thing has preached the word but it's jesus will come here now and do the same thing that he did when he was here on earth will it encourage you so that you can go home and know that he's raised from the dead i ask you the same thing if he comes down here and does something just like he did before if he comes down here just like he did as a son of man a the son of man working through a son of man bringing discernment and telling you exactly what conversation you had on your way to church if he can come down himself and do what you've seen him do before will you know that he's alive from the dead that this is the resurrection ministry that this is the third full ministry and it's not a man it's god things that are to be says now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creator denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god and the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living and that is his victory and the reason of his death and christ is the mystery of god revealed he says and there there would be a time come forth when he would express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church because now she's the body the fullness of him that filleth all in all we just read that in ephesians express himself in the fullness of his god had deity through his church having the preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by what accepting what eve turned down and adam what did they turn down they turned down the word accepting what eve turned down in adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see anointed with the word what eve turned down he comes back and we accept in 1963 he says in the message we have seen a star and have come to worship him would you deny what jesus said himself what the bible itself speaks out which is christ the anointed word and if the word abides in you then you're anointed you and your anointed person with the word you abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will to be done for you that's christ in you anointing the word for this age whatever age they lived in now i want to look at luke chapter four i'm going to take a few more minutes and take a look here in luke i had a conversation wednesday night with a brother out in the foyer and he said something that just i could not get off my mind could not stop so i had to go look at it when i looked at it i had to preach it in luke chapter 4 verse 16 this is when jesus comes into nazareth and he comes into a synagogue and sits down and they take the scroll and they hand it to him and brother branham is going to pick this up and uh this day this scripture is fulfilled and preach it there because he's going to have the same thing happen to him when he preaches birth pains and verse 16 says and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah's and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captive recovery of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister he sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all bear him witness and wandered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this joseph's son and he said unto them you will surely say to me this prophet physician healed myself he begins to prophesy but now he takes the scriptures he's in nazareth his hometown in nazareth he goes into the synagogue he takes the scriptures and he begins to identify himself by the word and he says the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach liberty to the captives in recovery of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised and the priest the acceptable year of the lord brother brahm's going to pick this up and he's going to make a few comments that i think are astounding in 1955 he says where i think pentecost failed this was the name of the message where i think pentecost failed so jesus had the greatest anointing of any man that was ever on earth is that the truth believe that is that right one day he went into the temple they gave him the scroll he picked it up in his hand he sat down and he read over in isaiah where it said the spirit of the lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year and so forth the jubilee year and he took the scroll and handed it back and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth the greatest anointing that was ever in the world on the lord jesus christ oh sometimes we get we methodists get noise confused with anointing noise ain't anointing no no i've seen where there's a lot of noise and not faith enough to curse it to cure a turtle toothache you've got to come solely to the father you've got to know exactly where you're standing in 1956 the message why are people so tossed about he says some people gets the wrong impression of what the anointing is did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone and what did they do when they had that anointing the greatest anointing was ever give to anyone was jesus christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without measurement and one day he entered into the temple and picked up the scroll and read said the spirit of god is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the acceptable year to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick give sight to the blind and now we would think if such anointing was on him that had been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessings and anointing of the lord upon him he would want to run all over the building scream and holler but the bible said he laid down the scroll set down and precious words proceeded from his mouth that's what he'd done under the anointing the anointing is not emotions the anointing is supreme power in control like knowing exactly what and how see and that's what's here jesus under the greatest anointing that was ever in a person and what did he do with that anointing he even began to read the scripture that spoke of his anointing god has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor the open blind eyes that set the captives free to preach the acceptable year of the lord that anointing upon him was so that he could bring the word so that he could open the scriptures and that he could say this day this scripture is fulfilled see there's nothing wrong with noise there's nothing wrong with getting excited but we can't confuse that for the anointing that's what brother bam said there's nothing wrong with being enthused and being excited and shouting and i like services like that where there's a robust amen and a hallelujah and praise the lord raising our hands and stomping a fee i like it like that but we can't confuse that for anointing and the louder faster and harder we preach does not mean it's more anointed this is just the truth there's a style of preaching called anointed preaching but that's not what brother branham described as anointed preaching and i don't care if it's fast or slow i don't care if i can barely keep up or if it's so slow i'm like next sentence please the anointing will bring the word for your day the resurrection ministry the third pool is the opening of the word for your day it's opening the scriptures and opening your understanding to understand the scriptures the the third paul ministry to the elect will be calling your name will be positioning you in adoption amen we'll be doing all of those things in the resurrection ministry because this is the resurrection of the bride this is the word that's been laying dead now for generations but slowly now begin to come up through luther through wesley through pentecost and now she's standing on her feet what is the resurrection of the bride and she has to be anointed but with what kind of anointing we can't misunderstand the anointing amen you can preach according to your personality slow or fast i'm fine with either in fact i like the word kind of fast myself but that anointing will bring the word for your day that anointing will be this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears not a historical jesus not what happened long ago not being pointed in the wrong directions not a run back to the previous church ages but that anointing take the scroll take the word open it to the part that apply today read the scriptures and say this day the scriptures will fill in your ears that's what the greatest anointing that was ever upon a human being did what did that anointing do the anointing had him hand him a scroll they gave him a scroll in in his hometown of nazareth where he's not respected gave him the scroll he read it he gave the scroll back and he sat down ask you a question how dynamic is the preaching sitting down he sat down and gracious words begin to come out of his mouth the doctrine of the day the word for that hour the revelation amen that'll bring an awakening to a bride that'll open our eyes doing something that he did before when through the preaching of the word not a gift of discernment but the preaching of the word he'll begin to speak back to you what you spoke to him in a prayer and to begin to answer back to you a question you were asking him in a prayer what's he doing he's trying to break the bread for you so you can say it's my lord he's here it's jesus christ it's not a man it's not a person it's not a preaching gift it's jesus christ here to break the word for his bride to do something like he did before look at brother branham he come to the most the the highlight of his ministry was when he preached the seals is that he talked about it all the time he said if i ever preached anything that was spiritually anointed amen it was those seals the seals was the highlight of his life and i tell you where's the discernment where is the big meeting what was it the highlight of his ministry was when he was opening the word he was most anointed this was the calling that he was called to all his life was to come down and open the seals and then to reveal the mystery of god as the seventh angel revelation 10 7 it was the purpose of his coming it was the highlight of his ministry it was the reason that he was on the earth and many when he come to it amen he he he only had one prayer meeting and that prayer meeting was after questions and answers on saturday morning and it was a fast line where they run through and all the preachers touch them and said be he'll be healed receive it in jesus name not a dynamic show of a gift i hope you understand what i'm saying when he come to his anointing when he came to the purpose which he was anointed for as the seventh angel when he came to it what was it verse by verse scripture by scripture opening of the seals revealing the seals through the bible what was it it was the awakening of the bride it was the calling of the bride it was the third poem ministry the sword in his hand the opening of the word and he said it'll be so humble will the bride have a ministry in the end time yes sure it's going on right now it's consisted of apostle prophet pastor teachers and evangelists amen going on all the time he said it'll be so humble why because in the resurrection ministry he opened the scriptures and he opened the understanding of the scriptures and he called her name and he positionally placed peter and he did it to the individual in that ministry they weren't coming to him they didn't know where to find him mary said to the what she thought was the gardener show me where he is and i'll go get him and he said mary i'm right here he's coming to you he's coming to you how's he coming he's in another form preaching a sermon for six hours on revealed prophecy what was that that was him he was there when he was invited into the house amen and they still didn't know who he was but he did something like he had done before so that they would know it has to be him we broke the bread their eyes were opened brother said they began to get excited and he was gone because the point was to get them connected to the word so that they would become the word for their day so that now they would carry the word and be the light bearers that's the reason of his death and that is his victory this bride is now the anointed of the lord is that true what should she do under this great anointing what kind of ministry should she have under this great anointing now it's the anointed bride anointed by his life what kind of ministry should she have listen i don't care about volume matters nothing to me loud quiet i've been allowed means i was thrilled with i was so excited i loved it why because the word was opening to me i heard a brother preach that was almost monotone almost monotone and like he was reading bullet points off of his notes and i was just as thrilled because it was opening the word what is that anointing for the bride to do she is the one carrying the word she has the life amen she knows the word she can open the word because the word's been opened to her she's ate the open book she's become one with it and now she and she can open the word and now god can give you of his spirit your heart can be pricked you can be baptized in his name you can repent be baptized in his name and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost he'll come in your heart and break the bread personally to you and open your understanding to understand the scriptures will the bride have a ministry at the end time sure a great ministry it's going on now it consists of pastors of apostles evangelist teachers it'll be so humble what will it be it'll be the word and when the word comes discernment comes when the word comes healing comes the scripture says he sent his word and healed their disease when the bridegroom is in position and the bridegroom is esteemed and held in that position and the bride room begins to speak amen that word will heal you deliver you correct you build you up edify you it'll do everything you need to do will be done by the word [Applause] we don't need a special this or a special that it's the word that does it amen and the word will do it through an apostle novenza's a pastor a teacher he'll do it through your brother in fellowship he'll do it through your wife he'll do but it'll be the word it'll be the one that comes through the tape or the book that you're reading but it'll be done by the word because that is our mate that is our husband that is who we become one with is the word and the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ will be the same ministry and it'll be the ministry of the word and as that word goes out there's still supernatural power under the opening of the word supernatural power while you sit and hear the word and believe that that's your bridegroom speaking to you and he knows your need and he said i sent my word and healed your disease you accept it now sitting in your seat and say under that word i accept that when you sent your word you healed my disease and watch what he does for you friends take manna's word believe that he's here he's the healer there's not a man that can heal you there's not enough oil that can heal you there's not enough lands laid on you that can heal you it's your faith in that word that speaks of that that heals you amen when the word goes forth everything you need is in that word that's why we feed on the word day and night because that's our mate that's our bridegroom that's our husband if i have a need the word will provide my need and to me when the opening of the word when the word is open and he's opening our understanding to understand the word then all of a sudden i say he's here it's him nothing is impossible now he's making his presence known among us by doing something like he did before children cast dinette on the right side wasn't it brother branham wasn't it that gift through brother brown that was able to tell you what you were talking about at your house before you came to church did we see that before and now when he comes and does the same thing and tells you what you were talking about the night before or the you know your phone's not bugged there's no cameras in your house there's no listening devices in your car but i know some of you have wondered because you told me you have what is it it's the presence of the bridegroom doing something like he did it before so you'll know it's the messiah it's my bridegroom he's here i can be healed i can be delivered i can be set free i can be positionally placed anything i can be filled with the spirit anything i have need of because the bridegroom's here and he's proving it service after service conversation after conversation fellowships and homes he's proving what's he proving he's proving he's here what is that that's the anointing taking the word in the third pool and showing that he's here i get excited it's an excitement it's an excitement that goes so deep sometimes all i can do is sit and cry it's an enthusiasm that goes beyond emotions no emotions come with it but there's a reality that comes to recognize that we are totally incapable of doing anything in our own we are just as helpless as the poor fishermen fishing all night doing the best they can with all the skill they've collected over their lives and still have nothing that's what we are friends without him that's what we are but then he shows up and he says cast your net on the other side and all of a sudden click click click click click and you say like john said it's the lord it's the lord it's not my brother it's not my sister it's the lord oh praise god it's time to jump out of the ship and swim to shore friends the lord is here he's here in the fullness of his word he's here to unlock the mysteries he's here to unlock your mystery he's proving it let's not miss what he's doing let it not slip by because it's so humble let it not let's not miss the grasp the reality of what's happening all around us let's let's absorb it and benefit from it because this is his resurrection ministry let's all stand musicians if you'll come please praise be to god i tell your friends god is good there's never been a day like this day god is so gracious and so loving and so tender he wants us to know that he's here he wants us to know that it's all under control that there's nothing to worry about if he knows what's going on in your home and he knows the conversation you've had then he's trying to show you everything's okay everything you have need of has been provided it's already provided we just have to have faith that he's here in our midst as the strong man to take care of his little bride let's just bow our heads and thank him for his word lord jesus we thank you for your word we appreciate you lord for all you've given and all you've done god you are so wonderful and so precious and so mighty you've been so tender with us lord you've corrected us while we're wrong but you did it so lovingly you've guided us by your word you've opened our eyes of understanding you've opened the word you've called us as individuals you've called us by name and you've placed us lord and told us to work in your vineyard you've called us individually you've proved that you're still here you're here in your resurrection power you're here in your resurrection ministry your anointing is still here god your prophet said it'll be so humble we believe it lord but god is so powerful it's changing us lord it's changing the way we think it's changing it's changing our understanding it's changing our reactions it's changing our families it's changing our lives it's changing us lord you are

invite him in don't let him pass by say come in lord come in and commune with me and break the bread for me do what you did for them do it for me so that i'll see your presence and i'll know you're here oh god is good in this day friends don't let him pass by just want to say god bless you mothers we appreciate you you should honor your wives and your mothers on this day because motherhood is an attribute of god and you know mothers you should be so thankful for this message because without this message you wouldn't even know how to be a mom a dad wouldn't know how to be a dad what idea do you take what's the right way to be a dad it's the opening of the word that shows you what a mother really is what a father and it doesn't just show it to you he gives you the power to become what you look at can't even be a good mom without this message oh how blessed are we to be living in this day when the bridegroom is here everything we have need of it's here just trust him have faith believe and watch it come to pass may god bless you as you go and let's sing this song again like is up now i can go free the chains that were holding me i can no longer see heard a long trumpet sound
