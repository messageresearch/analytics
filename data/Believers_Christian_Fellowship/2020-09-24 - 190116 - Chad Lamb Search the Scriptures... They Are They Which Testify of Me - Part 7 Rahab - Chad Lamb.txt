TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] there is [Music] praise the lord man i think i'm on yeah god bless you all let's take our bibles where we're standing and turn to luke 24. we are continuing on in the same subject search the scriptures part 7 which is super unusual for me but thank god i'm enjoying myself i am absolutely loving the word of god and and you get to a place where you read it so much you read it so much in the same passage year after year you read and and you you kind of think you know you get to a certain passage of scripture well i've read this before but all of a sudden it's like you've missed half of it like where have i been all my life what's happening amen and it's god he he can hide himself and reveal himself amen and it's amazing his ability to do that in the same scriptures amen that we've read for years he's able to unfold himself in the same we didn't rearrange the ink blots you know it's all the same but all of a sudden it's new again amen and i just appreciate the way god does that it encourages us and we're so thankful for them while we're standing quickly let's look at luke 24 and 44. and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures amen let's bow our heads their heavenly father we thank you lord for your word and god it becomes more rich to us every day lord it's vast and it's unmeasurable it's eternal lord it is you god expressing yourself in the form of your word lord i just prayed today that you would take this vessel of clay lord and that you would move the mind of a man out of the picture lord but you would come yourself and speak through these lips of clay lord i pray that we would hear lord with new ears with spiritual ears to hear what you're saying to us today that we might receive your word in the lord we might grow thereby and become more like you in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seats keep your bibles open we'll read through this again as you're seated i just wanted to make mention i should have said something over a week ago but we're moving into the season where we start to have some bad storms and many of you may have seen they're predicting a bad snowstorm for this weekend what will happen as we get there nobody knows it might go away it might get worse it might who knows but i just wanted to remind everything everybody of how you know we we cancel if we have to cancel or what we intend to do so first of all the goal is if at all possible we're going to have church unless it's just completely unsafe for anybody in this area to come if we're able and locally to have church we're going to come to have church amen but when we when we say that we caution anybody if anybody feels uncomfortable just because we're having church don't push yourself don't feel like you have to get out so if you're uncomfortable driving uncomfortable getting out don't don't worry about it if it's marginal and you're not sure just stay home it's okay but the reason we're gonna get here who can get here everybody with a four-wheel drive vehicle and everybody with a truck and a forward and a snowmobile we're gonna come and we're all gonna pull like crazy so that we can stream the service so everybody who's stuck at home has something to watch amen so if we locally can have service at all safely we're going to have service and we're not going to cancel unless we absolutely have to but sometimes in different areas like this last snowstorm if you were south of i-70 you got hammered but up here it was bad but it was okay we could still get to church so wherever you're at if it's not safe just stay home we'll come we'll pull you stay you pool and we'll have church amen and the last time we had a wonderful atmosphere we were down probably a quarter or third of the people but everybody pulled extra hard and it was wonderful and so we thank everybody for that so that's what we intend to do if for some reason we have to absolutely have to cancel the service what what i do is i'll talk to some of the deacons we'll make the decision if we make the decision sister suzanne will put it on the recording here in the church if you call into the church there'll be a recording saying there's no service we'll also call wtgn and wtg and we'll put it on the radio but also on their website so you can read it franco will put a banner on the website saying it's canceled and on the facebook page or you can call a deacon so we should be able to find out if we cancel church we should be able to find out amen so god bless you just be praying i'm praying we can still have service amen and if it wants to snow piles and piles after we go home that's fine as long as we can have church amen let's look at this scripture again in luke 24 verse 44 and he said unto them now we know what set the stage here jesus has has been crucified he's resurrected from the dead he's now shown him shown himself to the disciples amen thomas wasn't there the first time that he appeared to all the disciples and and he says i'll not believe unless i stick my finger in the in his hands and my thrust my hand into his side and so now jesus appears again when thomas is there and he tells him you know thrust your finger here and thrust your hand here and see that it is me and thomas says my lord and my god and he says hey you you now now you believe but blessed is he who doesn't see and yet believes so here we are in the setting this is the setting of the resurrection amen so this is a resurrection time this is a resurrection setting and this gets important because we've come back to a resurrection time we've come back to a resurrection setting in our day so now in this resurrection he begins to speak to them and he said these are the words which i spoken to you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled all things must be fulfilled which are written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures now it wasn't that they didn't know the scriptures because he said i told you these things he talked about these scriptures he's talked about these things these men amen they grew up going to synagogue they grew up hearing the scriptures it wasn't that they never heard the scriptures or didn't know the scriptures but they didn't understand the scriptures so one of the things that jesus christ does in the resurrection is he brings understanding of the scriptures amen and brother branham says in the message it is the rising of the son he says act christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheaf waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheep what was the sheaf the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheaf hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about [Applause] amen i'm sure you see what i'm talking about i don't know how many that they saw but i thank god for eyes to see it today amen amen i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism so now we're talking about a resurrection another resurrection out of dark denominationalism what's resurrecting out of dark denominationalism christ the word and we've come to another resurrection only it's not a resurrection out of a out of a cave tomb over and over in judea but now it's a resurrection out of dead denominationalism where they took the word and they they they they bound the word in their chains of creeds and dogmas for nearly 2 000 years but to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message christ the word back in the church again the holy ghost back in the church again so now we see there's another resurrection taking place and it's a resurrection out of dark denominationalism and one of the resurrection works that christ does when he resurrects is to give us understanding of the scriptures hallelujah i'm so glad they will come the first time they will come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denomination will be a message that the full maturity of the word is turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because i live ye live also speaking to his wife because i live ye live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is hallelujah are you in this resurrection hallelujah and in this resurrection season amen the word has been resurrected out of dark denominationalism and now it's come amen not for us to feel prince amen and thrust hands and decide amen but we can hear his voice and that he can give us understanding on the scriptures amen what a good day to be alive what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was way back to them on the day of pentecost the word made manifest now and as i say it's to be waived again in the last day so now we come in the resurrection time that jesus resurrects now he comes amen to show the sign to prove that it was him amen and then to get them to understand the scriptures and now in this resurrection season he's done the sign of the messiah to show that it's him the resurrected christ present tense here now amen and then he comes comes forth to bring us understanding of the scriptures but then now that wave chief was waved over them on the day of pentecost and now the pillar of fire comes into the church on the day of pentecost and now peter runs out and all of the 120 run into the street amen they're speaking in tongues and every man heard in their own language and he gets up on his soapbox that day and says these men are not drunk as you suppose but what's he start doing he starts giving understanding of the scriptures because he's in a resurrection season amen he that seed within peter has just sprung to life and resurrected and now peter who was afraid of the authorities who was hiding out with 120 who had separated and was in an upper room now when the pillar of fire comes into the church amen now that seed is quickened to life there's a resurrection in the resurrection season and he runs out and say this is that that the prophet joe has said [Music] [Applause] hallelujah now he's bringing understanding of the scripture through the church praise the lord let's turn to matthew chapter one and keep going down this path that we've been on i am enjoying these first six verses of matthew i never realized how rich the genealogy can be matthew chapter 1 verse 1 the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham abraham begot isaac isaac they got jacob and jacob begot judah and his brethren so we see here we've come to one two three four judah being four abraham isaac jacob and judah or isaac yeah jacob and judah comes to four and four is god's number of deliverance and judah is the tribe where the governor shall come forth shiloh shall come forth the scepter the king all of this it's it's the lion tribe it's the king tribe it's the delivering tribe amen so we we find all of this all of the the information all the things brother brennan teaches us amen in the seals we're gonna find it all through here we're gonna find four stages the the number four the number of deliverance seven church ages it's just it's just amazing so come to judah now in verse three and judas begot pharas and zara of tambar and now we've been through tamar and talked about her and how she comes into this lineage and she goes back to the original seed giver amen and so her fourth husband in the fourth stage is back to the original amen because judah is the original of the lion tribe the first one is judah amen who's the lion the king the scepter the ruler the governor is judah and so now she comes to her own and sheila but she comes back to the original to receive original seed and when she receives original seed her who could not conceive before now conceives on the original seed in the fourth stage of this journey which is back to the original seed again the wheat plant and so now back to the original seed now she produced produces not the third son but the fourth son pharas hallelujah so judas b got pharez and zara of tamar and pharis begot ezram and ezra and begot aram and abraham begat amina dab and aminadab begot nason and nayson begot solomon and solomon begot boaz of rahab so this is where we're at now to rahab and then we know in verse five it goes uh and boaz begat obed of ruth so that's the third woman that we've been wanting to look at here in verse 6 and jesse we got david the king and david the king begot solomon of her that was wife of uriahs so here we find out in verse five and six there's three of these four women mentioned so it's like we come down to the number four one two three four and we get to zara marrying judah and then we've got a gap and then all these women are clustered again and so whenever you see things like that you always ask yourself what's going on here why isn't this evenly dispersed because if you look when you look into the uh into genesis the jacob now is a possessor of the land he's living in the promised land that was given to his father abraham passed down to isaac passed down to jacob amen but we know what happens with joseph he's rejected of his brethren he's sold amen and he goes into his prison house he's exalted to the right hand typing christ all the way through but then a famine strikes the land amen in palestine and so now through all these circumstances the children of israel move out of the land move out of the promised land and move down into egypt okay and so now we're going to type this with the church ages because now they're leaving the promised land the word and they're going down into egypt which is a type of the world leaving the word going into the world and so we know judah and his in all of his children were there that generation was the generation who came with jacob their father and went down so judah would be the first judah so we go from judah to pharas to ezram to aram to abinadab to nason and to solomon number seven going through the church age journey and coming back through restoration and it was solomon who's born in the journey back but it's solomon who crosses jordan and goes into the promised land number seven in the seventh church age so these things are all laid out for reasons i mean they're not just they're not just there this way they're here for a reason amen so we find out that they come to solomon solomon's number seven and solomon number seven marries rahab the harlot in the promised land not an israelite a gentile marries her and when he comes to union with her and marries her and we're going to get more into this later what does she produce she produces the kinsmen redeemer which is number eight amen which is always a type of christ again so it's just over and over and over these stories roll and these numbers roll all through the bible so now we're going to focus down on on rahab let's turn to hebrews chapter 11. [Music] hebrews 11. in verse 29 we know chapter 11 to be the faith chapter of the bible the hebrews the heroes of faith as it's often called and we find here rahab mentioned of all the people that can be mentioned in this rahabs mentioned it says verse 31 by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace so who perished those that believe not so in jericho all the unbelievers perished but it says ray have perished not with them that believe not so by faith by faith the harlot ray have perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies so what was it that saved rahab's life faith amen by faith she was saved by faith she was justified it was her faith that saved her and you have to say what was it amen what was it that held her house up when all the walls came crashing down amen brother bam said 20 feet thick came in and parts the walls come crashing to the ground at the the sound of the trumpets and the sound of the shouting and they fell flat so that every man could go up in front of him but there was one section of this entire giant city with these giant walls that brother ben said they could run chariot races around the top there was one section that could withstand the wrath of god there was one step instead there was one section that though god in his wrath would demolish the defenses of jericho and demolish all the fortress of jericho but one section could withstand god's judgment what held that up it was faith that held that up faith held that part of the wall up amen and she was given a true token and that token was on display amen and the token amen was evidence of her faith it was an outward evidence of the faith she had so by faith she perished not it was her faith holding her house up it was her faith amen holding the walls intact for the salvation of her and her family it was by faith brother bam says and as i was with moses so i'd be with thee in 1960 he says this great harlot rahab became a believer i took her history here not long ago after she was considered and brought into the faith because of her belief in god she was brought into the israelite faith a proselyte she quoted a general in the army of the israelite army watch what god did for that woman they moved up in bethlehem and they had a son and and this son they called him boaz and out of boaz he married ruth from ruth and boaz came jesse and out of jesse came david and out of david came jesus hallelujah why faith cometh by hearing hearing of of a god that's a god of heaven and earth and believing on him believing what this is what we talked about last time but this is really important because it matters what we believe because by faith rahab amen by faith ray have perished not with them and that believed not so what was it that she believed in amen that gave her so much faith and her faith became an immovable fortress what wasn't she believed in well it wasn't the crossing of the red sea amen it wasn't the destruction of the armies across jordan it wasn't the signs it wasn't the miracles because she testified herself we all know what god did when he dried up the red sea we have heard of what god did in the destruction of the armies across jordan we have heard of these things and all of our hearts do faint so everybody in jericho believed in the supernatural signs they believed in the hand of god and they knew that it was god that was doing it amen so it's not believing in that amen there was something specific that she had to believe in and her faith in that thing was the thing that god recognized and saved her alive so my faith cometh by hearing hearing of god that the god of heaven and earth and believing on him believing what the commission that god had given to a man named joshua having that commission amen and there was a prophet with a commission amen and part of that commission he had signs and wonders and miracles and healings but you can believe in the creation of squirrels and you can believe in the opening of blind eyes in the healing of cripples amen but that is not the faith amen that is going to move us out of the destruction that's coming because anybody amen who believes in the supernatural of god believes in those things but what is it you have to believe you have to believe in that man's commission and what was his commission his commission was to forerun the second coming of christ that was his commission he was told when the pillar of fire showed up on the river in 1933 as john the baptist four ran his first coming you your message will four in a second so he's given a commission and then brother branham he comes down and he's working down through his ministry and he comes in 1962 present stage of my my my ministry i believe is where he says he says lord let this be the crowning of my ministry so now he's got a commission and a crowning amen and that is to dress a bride to clothe the bride in the word amen for your glory and so now he's here he's got the eleazar commission he tells us and explains to us he's under an eliezer commission to go and find a bride for the promised son and to bring that bride in union with the promised son hallelujah it's not just the miracles the signs and the wonders it's not just believing that god sent a prophet amen that's the same thing that jericho believed everybody in jericho believed moses was a prophet everybody in jericho believed they crossed the red sea he believed that they destroyed the armies across jordan but could they believe in joshua's commission to come in and divide the land to the rightful owners of the land that's the part that they couldn't cross they couldn't cross that line because they didn't believe that this group of people amen was the fulfillment of the promise they didn't believe this group of people had a right to the word they thought they had a right to the word they didn't believe that these people were the people with the right to the word see it matters what you believe you have to believe the commission amen not just the report but the commission brother ben uh says in the token message in 1963 anyone knows anything about the bible knows that the harlot was predestinated oh that does me good a predestinated harlot predestinated to be in that condition that goes beyond goes beyond your human understanding anyone knows anything about the bible knows that that harlot was predestinated sure she was the bible says she perished not with them who believed not that's right but she believed the message of the hour it matters what you believe salvation is in the message of the hour not believing in works and not believing that there's a prophet but salvation is in the message of the hour and god give her a sign by his messengers take a scarlet red streak and tie it on your side remember if you don't tie that streak there or leave it there what we've escaped by we're not responsible for our oath instead if if you are out from under it we're not responsible oh my ray have every predestinated seed in here you get out there and go to hunting them get your daddy your mother for we've just come out under the atonement down in egypt and everything that didn't have that we didn't have under that token perished so begin to explain the token to her now the token amen the token was given in recognition of faith because that's why the token is given in this day the token is given in recognition of your faith because abraham believed god and he received the sign of circumcision which was the sealing of the covenant because of his faith if he didn't believe he would get no circumcision so he believed god and received the sign of circumcision and now amen faith in the word of god faith in the message of the hour amen faith is what god when god gives the token he's recognizing your faith and your faith he is recognizing and when he recognizes you have the faith the right faith and the right thing he comes down and seals it in circumcision by the baptism of the holy ghost you can't just cry for hours and hours and hours on an altar to get the holy ghost it's a recognition of your faith the baptism holy ghost is a seal of your faith so you can't just jump up and down you can't just go through a prayer line now that will be fine if you have faith and if that's god's way amen for him to quicken that faith amen and seal you that's fine god can do it any way that he wants to do it through any sensation through any emotion through anything none of that is excluded but that you can do all of that but if you don't believe the message of the hour there'll be no holy ghost seal if you don't believe the commission if you don't have faith in the right thing at the right time the fully revealed word the message for this hour that we're living in you can cry and go through prayer lines and jump up and down and be anointed with oil and it's not going to come because it's god recognizing your faith [Music] [Applause] hallelujah so if you really truly believe i mean i mean really believe not an intellectual belief not a trying to believe but something in you that absolutely just believes then rest amen because he has to recognize your faith hallelujah if you don't have that knowing faith just say god i need a revelation amen i need i need you to quicken it to me unlock it lord give me a revelation so that i know that i know that i know that this is the truth she believed the message of the hour and god give her a sign by his messengers take a scarlet red streak and tie it on your house now the thread was recognition that she believed the message and then she had to have it on display outside the house for everybody to see that she was a believer there are no secret believers there are no hidden believers amen brother says in the again in the same message the token they must have believed that their own big denomination of jericho was able to resist the wrath of god see their own big denomination see they didn't believe the commission they didn't believe that this prophet was coming to restore the word to open the seals amen and to positionally place a bride in an invisible union with her groom they didn't believe all of that they didn't believe amen in the commission that now now it's going to be the bride coming of christ they just thought that they could just stay in the big denomination system and it'll be fine and god will recognize it amen they had confidence too much confidence in the big old walls amen and so god now brother man is now typing amen this wall city with the denominational systems and it's amazing where we go from here let's go back to joshua chapter 6. joshua chapter 6 and verse 2 and the lord said unto joshua see i have given unto thine hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor and you shall compass the city all you men of war and go around about the city once thus shalt thou do six days and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of ram's horns in the seventh day you shall compass the city seven times and the priest shall blow with the trumpet and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him now we've looked at this and been through this before on this jubilee trumpet it says here when they make the long blast with the ram's horn that ram's horn is the yo bell or the jubilee trumpet that's blown at the time of jubilee amen so we're hearing a jubilee trumpet and when the jubilee trumpet sounds then the walls will come fast go come come down flat amen and you will you this denominational system will be destroyed and you begin to possess the land so it's interesting that that he has them go around once we all know this really really well they go around one time they march around once was with the seven with the seven uh priest with seven trumpets amen that go around once for six days first church age second church age second third fourth fifth sixth they go through all six church ages amen and everything's the same before amen we're going through another church age another church age another church age but when we get to the seventh church age it's going to be different than the first six something very different is going to happen on the seventh that happened on the previous sex mother brethren says in 1964 the masterpiece says like in israel perfect type day of time i just got a few minutes left but in a perfect type in the beginning everywhere that a pillar of fire went was life god was that light and i don't care if it was midnight or whether they was in a good selected place when the pillar of fire moved the trumpet sounded and israel moved with it hallelujah and when the trumpet sounded martin luther moved out amen himself a man after him and then god took the life out of that and brought it on out and laid it down in the grave then out came wesley he saw the big organization so he sounded a trumpet of sanctification more of the word of god when he did that out they moved amen right out of luther right into methodist so he's saying the church ages are moving at the sound of a trumpet he comes to the sixth eel and he says and when messiah was cut off the jews was blinded so he couldn't see that was messiah and and then when messiah was cut off then the gospel in grace age came to the gentile and they came down and god pulled one from here and there and here and there and put them away under the messengers and here and there and here and there put them away under the messengers and he sent forth the first messenger and he preached and the trumpet sounded as we pick it up after a while and then that trumpet was declaring war what were they declaring around jericho this was a war march friends amen in each church age amen the church age messenger would sound forth the word brother branham said every church age they would break a seal amen bring a revelation sound a trumpet declaring spiritual war and then when it was rejected a plague would fall out amen the same thing you have in the book of revelations a seal a trumpet and a plague through each church age so he so he says and then the trumpet was declaring war trumpet always denotes war the messenger the angel came on earth the messenger of the hour like luther's like any of the messengers that we've talked of what does he do he arrives a seal open reveals a trumpet sounds war declared and away they go and when the messenger dies he seals away his group they're put in and a plague falls upon those who rejected it see and then it goes on then they organize get another organization we just come through it so brother branham is showing us amen that that every church age had a trumpet sound and here we all the way back in the book of joshua amen they're going to go around jericho seven times why seven times why not five why not twelve why seven times because you can find amen you can find this mystery secret of god working all the way down through the bible amen he's wanting us to come at the end of time amen when he begins when he breaks the seals and he opens the seals and he reveals the word and now the bible it opened up the entire bible you say the bible was open no the bible was not open until brother branham come and preach the seals that was a closed book that bible was not open but why is it we can preach this today is because a prophet came on the scene amen and he was given the revelation of the seals and when he preached that amen in the preaching of the thunders this bible became a new book it opened up the entire bible it opened up the entire word and he didn't have to change one word we didn't have to have a revision we don't even need a message revised bible we don't have to rewrite it we don't have to change the structure of the words we don't do anything we just take it for the way it is and the way it's been read for thousands of years and hundreds of years amen as scholars have poured over it they're pouring over a closed book and they're probing at it and getting kind of close but now now is the time that the seals have been taken off and it's opened up the entire book and he wants his bride to look down through and say there it is there it is there it is there it is there it is because we've got to have something amen that we can anchor our soul to amen enough faith that's going to change this body and now you're looking at every type every shadow every word what are you seeing you're seeing the whole plan of redemption you're seeing the threefold purpose you're seeing the seventh seal you're seeing yourself and if you can see yourself in this entire bible amen and you realize that i'm not reading the scriptures i'm living the scriptures i don't read the bible anymore to find out what happened i don't read the bible anymore to find out what's going to happen i'm reading the bible to discover what's happening to me right now as you read you say that's me that's me that's what i'm going through this is the position i'm in these are the spirits that i'm fighting they were called hittites and jebusites and parasites amen they were called philistines back then but now you can call them religious spirits and demons of depression and sickness and disease but it's the same thing man now we realize i'm not reading about the new testament church i am the new testament church all the new testament is husband and wife hallelujah so now it's different now you look back and see huh six times around huh seventh day i wonder what that types amen but on the seventh day you shall go around seven times because somebody is going to come along and explain all the mysteries of all the ages in the seventh so we've got to go around for the first stage and around for the second aid and around why because he's tying together all the loose ends and explaining what was left off in every age amen so we got to go through the church ages all again we've got to go around seven times on the seventh day and after the seventh time around on the seventh day now these seven priests are going to blow the trumpet and when they blow the ram's horn the yo bell the jubilee trumpet now it's not just the messengers now it's not just the seventh church age messenger but now the people join in now it's different now the people are being liberated now the people have a part to play before it's the messenger the messenger the priest the messenger the priest but now after the seventh time around on the seventh day and then they all stop and the seven messengers begin to blow all seven at one time and when they blow it's now not just a work for the priesthood it's now not just to work for the seven messengers but now in order for this system to come crumbling down it's going to take a shout from the people [Applause] say i get it i see it i believe it hallelujah i'm free this is our jubilee we're not leaving this for the preachers we've got something to do so now we find out that they blow the trumpet let's go over here to verse 20. chapter 6 verse 20. so the people shouted when the priest blew the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city now you realize when these walls came down these are huge boulders and huge rocks amen and they can come down haphazardly in all kinds of different ways and you could have a pile here and a pile there so that you would have to everybody's lined up around it so everybody would have to bunch together to work around this pile that's not how it came down amen it came down flat amen there is now no obstacle standing before them nothing the denominations could do to stop them nothing they could do from hindering them none of the creeds that kept them out none of the doctrines that kept them out it's all brought flat and every man went straight up before him he didn't need a detour there was only one spot they couldn't cross and that's where rahab was because her faith held the walls up verse 21 back in verse 20 in the middle the great shout the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the sword but joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the country go into the harlot's house and bring out vince the woman and all that she hath as ye swear unto her so now they're going to bring that they're going to bring the woman out at the time after the seven trumpets after the after the the seven times around after the great blast after the walls came down now the woman is going to be separated out from the systems she's going to be removed and separated out from the system it says it i'm just going to read two scriptures to you might want to jot them down but it says second corinthians 6 17 wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you this is the important part come out from among them and be separate and i will receive you revelation 18 4 and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of your sins and they receive none of her plagues so here rahab after the destruction arihaba is brought out and she's separated out brother benham says in the token 1963 and then when god honored it the house never shook down and then when joshua stood there and give the signal to destroy the whole thing went right straight up and rahab and all of her people set right and all their possessions amen amen all their possessions was in the house safely they just stood there and didn't have to look out the window they could read the scripture while the battle was going on there was nothing to be nervous about nothing to be worried about they had she had a true token not a false token a true token and she was confident in the token and she was confident in the promise they didn't have to look out the window they could read the scriptures while the battle was going on she came right back and courted courted the general and army in the army and was raised up and come into bethlehem and her portion was allotted up there to them and she brought forth a famous son and that famous son brought forth another famous son and that son brought forth another famous son until the great famous sun came right back down and on through obed and on through jesse and on through david that's right harlot rahab because she believed the messenger hallelujah we can't put enough stock in that just believing one and what has just believing accomplished in the scriptures amen not the works program amen just believing just believing knock the walls down just believing held her house up safe just believing what the messenger said amen was enough to preserve her in the time of judgment because she believed the messenger she applied the token and her house was saved or she had perished down there where she was at now i want to look at this solomon character for a minute solomon is not just one of any number of people he's a very unique person and numbers 26 moses begins the number or i believe it's joshua begins the number of the people the new generation that's raised up all the old warriors now have died off they're getting ready to cross over and there's another numbering and they number in in numbers 26 51 it says these were the number of the children of israel six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty so six hundred and two thousand seven hundred and thirty all fighting age men aged 20 and up that can fight not women and children and not the house of the levites there was another several thousand in the house of the levites wasn't counted in this so these are the men not the women and children the men that can go into battle are six hundred and two thousand seven hundred thirty right and there's one little harlot woman that has believed the message and come out of the denominations and which one of these 600 000 men do you think she's going to happen to run into the only one that counts is the prince of the house of judah he that's in line for the birthright and the house of judah because she is predestinated she is a predestinated vessel to be in the genealogy of jesus christ she's predestinated to come out she's a predestinated womb and that womb will only receive seed from one source this we're talking about was a harlot a harlot amen a harlot with a predestinated womb misusing what god had predestinated amen receiving seed from every denomination every thought everything that's out there but it never took never took never took never took until she comes out and she can't go to any one of these six hundred and two thousand men although they're righteous men amen although they're coming into the promise but there's one that she's predestinated to receive seed from now if you follow the line down through this is the line of the birthright from judah to pharas to ezram to aram to aminadab to nayasan naasan dies in the wilderness right this is solomon's dad he dies in the wilderness amen because all the old fighters die off so here comes solomon solomon is the only one right in this seed line one in a million how many hundreds of thousands do you think were in jericho one woman one man how did they ever get together predestination sometimes when we read the story we read the story but we don't realize the magnitude of what is taking place how is it that solomon stays single this long how is it he's not married how is it there's no there's a predestinated plan taking place amen brother brahm said why it had to be shepherds he said hold on i think i missed the part yeah why i had to be shepherds i'll get to that next but i want to go back and read joshua 6 again hopefully you're still in joshua 6. let's read 23 and then we'll go to the next quote let's go back to 22. but joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country go into the harlot's house and bring out vince the woman and all that she hath as you swear unto her and the young men that were spies went in and brought out rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the camp of israel and they burned the city with fire and all that was therein only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the lord and joshua saved rahab the harlot alive in her father's household and all that she had and she dwelt in israel even into this day because she hid the messengers which joshua sent to spy out jericho i want to look if we can look back and read verse 23 again and the young men that were spies went in and brought out rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had they brought out all our kindred and left them without the camp she left them without the camp of israel why they were heathens they couldn't come into the camp i mean they couldn't come into the camp of israel they they were from a heathen nation they were heathen people and besides that she had lived a very ungodly lifestyle she was rahab the harlot a famous harlot and now she's outside the camp brother ben says and why it had to be shepherds no i'm sorry not that one yeah here it is and why little bethlehem and then you see here she was taken in as one of the israelites she fell in love with the man which was a captain and a prince in judah he was the captain of the israelite armies his name was salman just like the king solomon and he was a captain and she became in a great romance with this captain which was prince of judah and finally she married him and when the estate was settled up for the israelites she and her beloved husband lived in bethlehem now you begin to see it open haven't you see begin to open as we see that in bethlehem she lived being a gentile bride to a jew why because she believed in a miracle-working god look where she come from from being out of a house of ill-famed prostitution through her conversion and through her unfailing faith in god it brought her from a prostitute house prostitute house to a beautiful home in bethlehem what a difference that's the way it does all of us from a house of unbelief and flusterations immoral acts and everything to a place position in christ which is most beautiful from the ridiculous to the sublime that's the difference that it makes through our conversion and did you see she married a prince of the house of judah a captain the captain represented christ took to himself a gentile bride from the lowest of the lowest to the principle and best place in the land as we'll get to it later in our message to prove that it was nothing else could be but that they're a type of the gentile bride so now she goes from being moved outside the camp they take her and they put her outside the camp of israel amen and so she has no hope of coming inside the camp but she's predestinated so there's only one way that she can get inside this camp there's only one way for her but there's no hope in her mind because she knows her immorality she knows her sinfulness she knows her condition so in her mind it's a hopeless situation and here she is removed and set outside the camp but here's solomon now solomon has every right to be in the camp solomon is one of the 12 princes and the firstborn lineage of each of the 12 tribes of israel and he happens to be carrying amen the natural lineage of christ key fella here not just any of the 600 and 2 000 this is the only one amen that is that is he's the predestinated one in the birthright of judah amen and he's got to find a predestinated womb to bring forth amen the lineage of christ and so god has to move all the circumstances so no doubt amen that he's taken notice of the girls in israel amen a lot of fine girls a lot of godly girls living right doing right dressing right doing everything right but none of them fit the bill because god is laying down a pattern showing his gentile bride so solomon in order to find his bride he must himself go outside the camp he's got to go outside the denominations outside the camp of religion he himself moves outside the camp when he comes outside the camp he's found the one who's come out from among her he's found the one who's been delivered from denominations he's found the one that's separated out not touching the unclean things and he said if you'll if you'll come out from her amen and not cut and be separate and not touch of the unclean things i will receive you receive you where not in the camp out of the camp i won't receive you in there i won't receive you in the denominations i won't receive you in the systems but if you come out from among her and be you separate i will receive you and now rahab has come out and she is separated and she's outside the camp in psalm and now what moved him to stroll outside the camp what power was upon his life what was he thinking he may not have been thinking he may have lost a goat he may be chasing down who knows how god worked it out but all of a sudden he goes outside the camp because what he's looking for cannot be found back in the system let's go out out of the camp to be joined to him so now these two meet outside the camp do you see yourself do you see the redemption story you see the bride of jesus christ the predestinated seed separated out the one who's ordained to redeem her now the question is how is she going to be redeemed by receiving seed now solomon is going to go outside the camp just like the the the owner of the armor the armor company's son goes down and he sees all of these beautiful girls and they're they're putting on the ritz for him but he goes out and finds outside the camp outside the party he finds a little washer woman and he finds in her character character that he can marry character that he's been looking for what was it solomon found in rahab rahab amen not an israelite princess amen not growing up hearing the stories not growing up always you know in the presence of moses and seeing joshua no this is a woman who grew up outside of all of that was her life was horrible in a horrible condition full of adultery but the first time she heard the message she believed it what was solomon looking for he was looking for the character that is expressed by faith faith in the message of the hour that was attracted to psalm and solomon finally found what he was looking for couldn't find it anywhere else couldn't find it back in israel but here is the woman amen and instantly when that light struck when that light flashed across that seed comes alive here's the woman with character and he says will you marry me can you imagine being rahab you probably can it was probably like when you first realize christ wanted to marry you and you're saying really like the preaching is striking your heart you know it's god calling you but you're like really i mean really could it be me i mean do you know what i did in jericho do you know what my name was my title you know what the nomination i come through do you know what i've believed you know what i've done solomon didn't care what she had believed solomon didn't care what she had done because all that mattered is she is separated from that and he can receive her and now the woman that's separated from the camp outside the camp when solomon comes outside the camp and finds a believer he marries her now is she outside the camp anymore he brings her right into the household of faith and dare anybody condemn rahab i dare anybody to mock rahab to condemn rehab to say she has no rights what gives her the right the right is that she is receiving seed and that seed takes conception within her and she brings forth the lineage of christ she's right there in matthew chapter one amen you go and read it and there's rahab and what's rahab bringing forth rahab's bringing forth not just another name judge is another name in the list but boaz the kinsman redeemer how dare anybody speak evil of rahab from that day on call her a harlot no sir her sins have been washed away her past life has been forgotten she is now a princess in judah who did she marry a footwash funky foot soldier water boy she married the highest ranking prince in judah the king tribe instantly her identity changed from rahab to harlot to princess mr and mrs salman now when she goes to the well she doesn't have to go outside to camp anymore she doesn't have to hide or come in odd hours now she walks right out there and if she's dipping in the well they can say oh i haven't met you who are you she doesn't say rahab i'm rehab no she says i'm mrs solman oh oh oh can i help you carry your water pot her identity completely changed in a moment it didn't take amen it didn't take years of being married before she could take his name amen before her identity would change it happened in a moment when he took her and said you're mine and she accepted what he has given to her amen instantly in the ceremony he took her unto himself and her total identity changed from that point on from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high it's hard to go any higher than where rahab went and it's hard to be any lower than where she was my goodness that should make us dance a little jig say it doesn't matter what i was it doesn't matter what i've done it doesn't matter where i've been it doesn't matter what label i've worn before i'm only wearing one label now and if you want to know who i am i am mrs jesus christ my identity has changed i have confidence in who i am amen there may have been a time i wasn't so sure that name would work there may have been a time i didn't know amen i didn't really know i'm just feeling it now but we've walked along far enough to know that this is a true identity amen it come through a true token and a true union amen with a true the true seed the true prince of the house of judah the true king making me the true bride and now i have a right to give my true identity i don't have to call myself what others called me i don't have to identify my former life i don't have to explain myself to anybody because solomon didn't care christ didn't care why should anybody else care praise god see brother brennan begins to say i just want to wrap up by sharing this last few thoughts he says in the message why i had to be shepherds he was talking about solomon is the one who founded bethlehem solomon founded bethlehem and who was there with him when he got his inheritance and found at bethlehem rehab rahab is taking possession of the land with her husband amen she's now in the marriage union she's now walking with her husband and when her husband gets an inheritance guess what she gets an inheritance when her husband gets bethlehem guess what she gets bethlehem this is why christ had to be born in bethlehem because solomon was given bethlehem and solomon and rahab took bethlehem and they brought forth boaz in bethlehem and they brought forth obed and bethlehem they brought forth jesse and bethlehem they brought forth david in bethlehem christ had to be born in bethlehem why because of rahab the harlot and salman she found her position and her position produced the kinsmen redeemer her position produced the kingly race her position produced the right offspring out of position nothing was happening seats coming nothing seats coming nothing seats coming when she gets into the right position seat comes conception right baby's born so why no matter how much we wanted to live a good christian life in whatever system we were in we were incapable of overcoming but when we come into the right position amen all of a sudden we receive the right seed and it brings forth the right life praise gone brother bill says he goes the bethlehem the house of god's bread we proved it in scriptures he could not come any other place bethlehem was founded by rahab and her husband in case you doubt it brother man said bethlehem was founded what was bethlehem the house of god's bread hallelujah where was that coming from rahab rave and her husband rahab was a harlot that a general courted in the israelite army after that after they had taken jericho and by face she believed the message of god in her condition and she was saved and from there when joshua divided up the lands and where each one would be and there's a great lesson that sometimes i hope to be able to bring at tucson of those hebrew mothers giving birth to those babies when she groaned at the birth pain of the baby she called the name of the baby and that positionally placed it in the promised land its tribe so now she's got to get into position when she gets into position now each one of these hebrew mothers in the in the exodus journey when they were bearing down in labor they would call forth a name and that name would position them in the land and brother branham said they were calling their tribal name they're called reuben and gad and then joshua comes along and joshua places reuben and gad and naftali and issachar and and dan and all of these he begins to place them amen but in their birth when they're birthed they're positionally placed because of the name spoken over them when they're birthed they're positionally placed that's why it's so important that all you do amen both in word indeed you do all in the name of jesus christ because how you bring somebody in and birth them into the church amen is their identification and if you birth them under trinitarianism and trinitarian baptism they'll never find the right position in the land but they've got to be birthed and brought in amen under the name of the lord jesus christ restoring water baptism wasn't just a trivial thing it brought an identification so now it's important it's important what how a baby's birthed and under what word they're birthed under because when the mother's bringing forth the word that she's speaking as she's travailing and bringing forth a new believer a new israelite what she's speaking is positionally placing them in the word so my brother venom comes to the first seal he says it only is to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken i'm going to back up one paragraph and read now watch he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol he's talking about the seals it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand church it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they knew there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider white horse rider red horse rider black horse rider but listen what he says next and it only is to be revealed at the last day when the actual seal is broken so there's an actual breaking of the seals when is the actual breaking of the seals not after the rapture but the actual breaking of the seals took place in 1963 at the actual seal is broken broken to who not to christ but to the church notice oh my that just makes me tremble i hope the church truly understands it you people i'm going to call you bride that you'll understand it so why does brother branham take the time to stop and say now there's going to be there's a transition taking place amen now we're coming to a new place a new position not a church age position but now we're coming to the breaking of the seals when they actually break and we reveal what the symbol of white horse says red horse says black horse says all of these things now we're coming to an actual position in order for you to get into position i'm going to have to call you by another name [Music] i'm not going to call you church but i will call you bride because the actual breaking of the seal is the bride's position because it's coming back into the fullness of the land not a partial journey not one time around but all seven times around that's what brother branham said in in 1964 the feast of trumpets now if i come with if i come with the message of pentecost i would be in the laodicean church age and it wouldn't be right i'm going to read that again now if i come with the message of pentecost i would be in the laodicean church age and it wouldn't be right but i'm saying that message if i come preaching a pentecostal message i would be in the later scene church age because the pentecostal age is the laodicean church and if i come preaching a pentecostal message i'd be in the later sea in church age and that wouldn't be right because what's right he come to bring us out of that into the bride age and that's why he had to call her bride because now there's a new position the new position isn't luther it's not wesley it's not justification it's not sanctification it's not baptism or holy ghost but now we've come to a new position and i'm going to speak in the first seal a new name as i'm laboring to bring forth and that new name i'm going to call you bride so i can position you in the bride's portion of the land amen that's why it's important it's important what you're birthed under the word that's spoken amen as the woman the church the bride is bringing forth more the word that is spoken is going to position us in the land praise god so now we can't identify with reuben's portion luther's portion any portion that belonged to the church before because the prophet said i'm going to call you bride that you'll understand that you can be positioned in your land what is our land the capstone the fullness of the word the entire bible opened up the revelation of the seals it's not anymore not anymore a church ages message if i preached that it wouldn't be right but now we come not with the pentecostal message but we come with the bride's message and when the bride is bringing forth more bride it matters what's being spoken during the labor pains because what's being spoken is positioning the seed in the land hallelujah amen praise god in the invisible union of the bride of christ said now your old book is gone with your old union you think rahab likes this portion of the message your old book is gone with your old union your name and your old has been transferred now you say do you mean to tell me that my old book god put it in the sea of his forgiveness you stand perfectly before god how do you think rahab stood before the rest of israel perfectly not because of her deeds but because of her husband it was her union with the right person that got her the respect it got her the position that she needed to be in you stand perfectly before god now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the lamb's book of life what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural union but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate i've done a lot of marriage not a lot i've done a few marriages and there's two names that matter most on a marriage certificate the bridegroom and the bride and your name is on the marriage certificate because your name is in the lamb's book of life hallelujah how would you like for your husband the day you get married to come to you and whip out a document and the date on it stamped and certified is 20 years earlier and it's got your name on the marriage certificate next to his i bet that'd be a shocking day how did you know how did you do that how how did you put that on that's exactly what god has done god knew who he was going to marry before we ever got here he knew what position would be and he knew what age we'd come forth he knew when the union was going to take place amen and he already recorded that name rahab's name was already on that book amen when she was in jericho living a harlot life her name's on the marriage certificate next to jesus christ amen when she's believing the report it's because her name's written there amen when she's when she's coming to life and receiving a true token because her name's being there when she's brought out and separated out of the camp it's because her name is on the marriage certificate when solomon can't find a suitable mate in all of israel it's because his name is next to hers on the marriage certificate that's why christ couldn't marry a church a.j man he had to wait until he had a bride he meant that he had a bride that he could marry we know there's bride all through the church ages they'll come up at the end but now in the invisible union he's waiting for one that's separated out and outside the camp amen what's moving solomon to go outside the camp his name on the marriage certificate what's moving rahab to stay outside the camp her name on the marriage certificate what is it that makes his heart skip a beat when he said he saw lots of women before you know her story would have been famous through all of israel the two spies they were received and they were spared and they were sent out you know that news would travel like wildfire when you look around jericho and the entire city is laid flat except one little house on the wall standing right here by itself you think that would have started a conversation [Music] you think they wouldn't all know who lived in that house and why it was standing and what her reputation was and what she everybody knew her story solomon wasn't looking for a relationship with a harlot he was looking for the one that had her name on the marriage certificate with him amen hallelujah it says now your new life is the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate hallelujah where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold now you're not only forgiven but you're justified amen by what by believing you're just but you're justified glory justified romans 5 1 said yeah romans 5 1 said they're being justified by faith look up the word the word don't mean forgiven the word means justified it don't mean you're forgiven you say i've been forgiven in my sense that's true but now i can go a step further because i've been in the invisible union received the seal of my faith the baptism of the holy ghost been washed by the water of the word and cleansed from all unrighteousness and now i cannot just say i'm forgiven of my sins that was an old statement that i made when i was coming in but now i can say what sins yes are you forgiven of your sins what sins [Applause] if you think i'm if you think i'm off my head just listen a little bit further as we read on down amy said the word don't mean forgiven the word means justified it don't mean you're forgiven for instance you heard i got drunk and done some evil things and everything then you come around and say to me you found out i didn't do them then you come around and said brother branham i forgive you forgive me i didn't do it at the first place see now if i did it i'm guilty but you could forgive me and i wouldn't be guilty but yet i'm not justified because i actually done it but the word justified is though you never did it amen it's not even regarded at all now he asks a good question how is it done how's that done in god's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book in marriage is divorced and dead it's not even the memories of god amen so why would you get back on your knees and say god i'm sorry for that thing i did 20 years ago it's not even in his memory it's not just forgiven it's justified just as if it never happened so if the devil reminds you of it say forget it amen i'm not bringing that back to god i've already repented amen i've already been forgiven and now i am justified how is it done and god's book of the sea of forgiveness your old book in marriage is divorced and dead it's not even in the memories of god you are justified therefore being justified it was accused you was accused you never did it in the first place the old union is in the sea of god's forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with he the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you in your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be in his bride and before the foundation of the world the bible said so and you are a predestinated seed how did you come to do this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent eve it's no fault of your own now we're talking about the difference between the natural man and the spirit man be in the inner man and the outer man there's a big difference this outer man did all kinds of stuff amen and it did it because it was moved by the wrong nature i mean it came with a sin nature but at one point in my life amen that sin nature was burnt out by the holy fire of god and god quickened to life a seed that was laying there in my soul dormant and been bursted into action and that is the life that i now live that's the real me from before the foundation of the world this is my true identity and that guy that i don't say it like that not that guy that expressed attribute of god never sinned in the beginning never was an unbelief never was in deception never disbelieved god at any time it was only a human mind a human spirit in a human body that was fallen but that has been cut off and divorced amen amen and the real you has sprung to life the eternal predestinated seed of god an expressed attribute of god you were deceived into it it's no fault of your own by your natural birth you come after eve who committed adultery that's the reason you was born unadulterous you're a sinner to begin with that's right you was deceived into it no it ain't your fault you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world god put your name in the lamb's book of life rahab was in that book did rahab really commit adultery depends on which rahab you're talking about brother branham said down inside me was another william branham it depends on which rehab you're talking about the one in the lamb's book of life or the one in the record of natural life just come up from natural parents which one are you talking about did ray have committed mount daltry well in one sense she did in another sense she never did it in the first place and now as her and solomon move into bethlehem they set up house and they brother man said they built a beautiful home they have wealth and they have land and they have boaz it's a totally new life old things are passed away she doesn't need to live the old kind of life in the old kind of condition now she comes to a brand new life a brand new condition why because of who she married say thank you god i don't have to rely on my old identity but through a union now my name is changed i've taken his name romans 5 1 says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into his grace wherein we stand and receive and rejoice in the hope of the glory of god i thank god spiritually we may have lived like rahab we may have been in all kinds of horrible situations spiritually speaking maybe even morally speaking or naturally speaking but something's changed now you say remember all those things you did well yeah in the human mind i remember them but god doesn't remember them they're not in the mind of christ so they're not worth talking about anymore i've received my true identity the identity of the true me that was written in the lamb's book of life and before the foundation of the world the old record of the old union is dead divorced and dead and i've realized my name is written on a marriage certificate from before the foundation of the world and now i have a right to his name i have a right to this new identity and i say thank you god we can come into bethlehem the house of god's bread praise god let's all stand musicians if you'd like to come i don't know about you but i've enjoyed rahab i never dreamed that so much was laying there and the sad part is as we move on we know we're leaving things behind but you just have to wait for revelation you can't manufacture those things so we just keep praying you know this is exciting time to be alive we've been birthed out not under a pentecostal message we've been birthed out under the message of the hour and it's birthed us into christ the word and now i don't have to wander around in darkness i don't have to move from one walled city to the next walled city but i've come out of that and separated and if i separate and touch not the unclean thing he will receive me and solomon's outside the camp and rahab's outside the camp and there's a union that takes place i say thank god thank god that he predestinated the lineage of christ because if he didn't predestinate it it'd be a totally different picture and i thank god he predestinated me to be in that line if it wasn't for his predestination it'd be a totally different story not by any works or any merit of our own but simply by predestination are we here let's bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father god lord what tremendous things lord that you have shown through the story of rahab and god it's amazing lord what you have laid in your word and allowed to lay there hidden in plain sight for all these thousands of years but now lord at the opening of the entire word you're showing us more and more and more about yourself and about ourselves and about this story about this great love story i pray god that you would just lord lift us on a higher plane with clearer vision that we might see in reality all of these things that we've discussed lord that it might be more than a story and more than a sermon but it would be our very life lord it becomes such a revelation to us that it would change the way we behave it would change the way we look at the world around us it would change everything about us because it's a reality it's true and it's true in us lord god change us mold us make us into your image use us for this final work and this final push in these last hours and moments of time have your way in your brain display yourself and display your great story of redemption in us use us for your glory almighty god open our lips to speak truth open our ears to hear truth open our hearts to perceive and receive all you have for us in this day we love your god and we ask for your blessings bless your children lord as they go on their way home lord keep them safe on the roads and let our light so shine that others would see our good works and glorify you that others would be drawn and attracted to your life and that your seed would find their way home we ask it in jesus christ's name amen god bless you do you know that song he brought me out of the miry clay i sing that song he brought me out of the miry clay i don't know about you but i was in some mirey clay i was stuck how many of you were stuck but he brought me out of the miry
