[0:00] we cannot say we believe this mess this
[0:02] is not a denomination this is not i you
[0:05] can't go to a message church and be a
[0:06] believer
[0:08] you have to be a believer
[0:11] it's not there's not admittance you know
[0:13] i walk into the doors of a message
[0:14] church and i'm a believer and i believe
[0:16] god sent a prophet i mean there's
[0:18] multitudes that believe god sent a
[0:19] prophet amen but
[0:21] that's not really the goal of the
[0:23] message that's not what god wanted god
[0:25] wanted a people that would come to the
[0:27] full life of jesus christ in bride form
[0:32] that it would be christ in bride form
[0:35] manifesting himself to the entire world
[0:37] that was the purpose of the message
[0:39] that's the seventh seal that's why
[0:41] brother branham opened the seals that's
[0:42] why god sent a prophet that's why the
[0:44] supernatural that's why there's a cloud
[0:46] that's why all the stuff that happened
[0:48] happened that's why there was raising of
[0:50] dead that's why there was opening of
[0:51] blinding eyes everything that happened
[0:53] happened for this purpose to get a bride
[0:55] to full maturity and it takes a full
[0:57] word the full light to bring her to full
[0:59] maturity to express the full life and
[1:01] that's the purpose of the message
[1:02] [Music]
[1:04] to stop somewhere short and say i
[1:06] believe god sent a prophet i go to a
[1:08] message church but you know i'm not so
[1:09] sure about brother benham said about
[1:11] this and i'm not so sure about that and
[1:13] i think i've got a right to remarry and
[1:14] i think it's okay for me to wear this
[1:16] and i
[1:19] you see really quickly that the devil
[1:22] has got in somewhere
[1:24] and a temptation in the wilderness
[1:28] because now we're hanging out over here
[1:31] my want my desire what i like the way i
[1:33] want to look the way i want to live and
[1:35] we we we've rejected the very
[1:38] message well we haven't rejected men's i
[1:41] believe god said no no no no
[1:43] you haven't taken the authority of a
[1:45] prophet in your life
[1:49] the voice that god gave us in this day
[1:51] to bring the bride to full
[1:54] rapture of faith to full harvest
[1:56] maturity
[1:57] [Music]
[1:59] and then somehow
[2:01] we get comfortable
[2:03] in compromise
[2:05] because i'm the bride i believe the
[2:07] message i'm the bride
[2:10] if you're comfortable and comfortable if
[2:12] you're comfortable living contrary to
[2:14] what the prophet of god taught us to
[2:15] live then i would go back and repent and
[2:18] say god there's something wrong with
[2:20] i've accepted a lie somewhere
[2:22] [Music]
[2:24] amen i've accepted something the devil
[2:27] has whispered to me somewhere he's used
[2:30] something to get me to stop in my growth
[2:33] to be coming to this perfect image of a
[2:35] bride and i've gotten comfortable being
[2:37] in the message and being part of the
[2:39] bride but they're never to be
[2:41] comfortable being in the message the
[2:43] message has to be in you amen and
[2:44] furthermore the message has to come out
[2:46] of you
[2:47] [Music]
[2:49] you
[2:50] you and i are called to be the living
[2:52] message the living expression of the
[2:54] living word everything brother branham
[2:56] preached is supposed to be alive and you
[2:58] and i
[3:00] and manifested and demonstrated
