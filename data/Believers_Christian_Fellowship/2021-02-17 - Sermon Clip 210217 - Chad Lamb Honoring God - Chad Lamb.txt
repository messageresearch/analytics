TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if your mother or my mother would have walked out on the street the way one of these women they would have put her in an insane institution she didn't even have enough mind to know to put her clothes put on her clothes well if it was insanity then it's insanity now this is a major statement that brother branham is making and i want to catch that brother brethren saying if it was insanity there what's changed if it was insanity to do that then why is it not insanity now what is change amen and we redefining what's saying and not saying we know that's true but if he's ever was in sanity it will always be insanity but cultures change to where it's become accepted and now nobody considers it wrong or insane but but there was a time a period of time when man was not so polluted and not so corrupted because corruption comes over time and there was a time that they would you know the majority of people would have looked at that and said that's insane that's wrong but now as corruption set in and corruption breeds more corruption and things deteriorate to the point where now the society says no this is normal and they go beyond saying it's normal or acceptable now it becomes preferred and after it becomes preferred then it becomes protected and once it's protected now anything against it is evil and insane what was once insane is now become normal accepted preferred protected and to say anything against it or take a different position now is insane the thing is completely flipped but the question is has god changed one drop amen has anything changed in his nature has anything changed in his thinking has anything changed in the desire nothing has changed in god what it is is satan's eden has come to perfection and his perfection is a total perversion of god's word his will and his plan but when you know his word his will and your plan amen when you look at this thing that's confusing to the world and confusing to denominational churches i mean they don't understand they know morality has changed they know dress and conduct and behavior has changed but they don't know what to do about it they don't know how to keep up with the change they no longer know where to draw the line to say what is right and what is wrong because they don't know the word the will and the plan of god and because they don't know the word the will and the plan of god amen they're trying to adapt to the new normal and they're trying to find out what's right in the new normal because they don't have the word the will and the plan of god but by revelation of this hour we know the word the will and the plan of god and you can step back and say nothing's changed with god what was once wrong is still wrong what was once insane is still insane
