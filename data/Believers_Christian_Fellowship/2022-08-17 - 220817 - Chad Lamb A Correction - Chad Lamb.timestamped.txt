[13:16] to have your seats starting off thank
[13:18] you musicians that'll be all
[13:21] amen i don't really intend to preach
[13:23] tonight i just want to talk to the
[13:25] congregation for a little bit
[13:27] there's a
[13:28] there is a mistake that i've made and a
[13:30] declaration that i made that i need to
[13:32] retract and i'd like to take a little
[13:35] bit of time and explain that and i'd
[13:37] like to make things right
[13:39] many of you will remember not all of you
[13:42] were here at the time but many of you
[13:43] were you'll remember that about two and
[13:45] a half years ago in february of 2020
[13:48] i had a service here on a wednesday
[13:50] night and during that service i was
[13:52] preaching about gifts and i was
[13:53] preaching about offices in the church
[13:55] and during that service i made a
[13:57] declaration and i declared unto you that
[13:59] god was rising up a gift amongst us and
[14:02] our brother rich levy and i had declared
[14:03] him to be a prophet in the office of a
[14:05] prophet
[14:07] and
[14:08] i realized now that that was a mistake
[14:10] that i shouldn't have done it i
[14:12] shouldn't have handled things that way
[14:13] and i was it was an error in making that
[14:16] declaration
[14:17] and i would like to retract that
[14:19] statement officially and i'd like to
[14:21] take a few minutes and explain to you
[14:23] why i retract that what the mistake was
[14:26] how i made that mistake
[14:28] and
[14:29] and see
[14:30] if god will just lead us from there
[14:33] um
[14:34] [Music]
[14:35] before that time before february 2020
[14:37] there was
[14:38] quite a period of time maybe a year or
[14:41] more where the brother was coming to me
[14:43] with many spiritual experiences dreams
[14:45] and visions and audible voices from the
[14:48] lord and they were really quite dynamic
[14:50] they were uh amazing
[14:53] and it had been happening for quite some
[14:54] time and there was a number of those
[14:57] events and they were very supernatural
[14:59] very spiritual
[15:00] and so i had been hearing this from him
[15:03] for a while
[15:04] and one of those supernatural events one
[15:07] of those dreams that he had was a
[15:10] spiritual dream i mean was the dream
[15:12] about the two cylinders
[15:14] and he had shared that with the
[15:16] congregation
[15:17] and as we moved into the first of the
[15:19] year into january going into february of
[15:22] 2020
[15:24] many of you know that in december that's
[15:26] when the coronavirus began to make news
[15:29] about what it was doing in china and
[15:31] began to move out of china and start to
[15:33] make its way across asia and into
[15:36] europe and there was quite a
[15:38] tension in the air because something was
[15:40] happening something on a global order
[15:43] and something with a
[15:45] lot of significance to it
[15:47] and during that time there was a
[15:49] discussion and there was some
[15:52] points being made that if this is a
[15:55] dream from the lord
[15:56] sent to help the people at this time
[15:59] how can we keep it from the people and i
[16:01] begin to think and ponder those things
[16:04] and think would it be right for me to be
[16:06] the only one to know these things and
[16:08] and and with the tension mounting and
[16:10] the things that were happening i decided
[16:12] to move forward
[16:14] and to let the congregation know what
[16:16] had been going on to make the
[16:18] declaration that i made about our
[16:20] brother and and then praying and
[16:23] trusting that god would bring clarity
[16:25] and that god would interpret the dream
[16:26] and if you remember i asked the
[16:28] congregation at that time to be praying
[16:30] that there was a significant dream that
[16:32] the brother had had and praying that god
[16:34] would bring an interpretation of the
[16:36] dream
[16:37] but after you know about a month there
[16:40] was still nothing that it came no
[16:41] interpretation of the dream
[16:43] and there was still this
[16:46] i'd say this continuation of the rolling
[16:48] of coronavirus through the uh european
[16:52] countries through the european continent
[16:54] and coming into america and we knew that
[16:57] things were getting difficult and there
[16:58] was shutdowns and all kinds of things at
[17:00] that time and it was a it was a
[17:03] disturbing time
[17:05] and
[17:06] i had this
[17:08] this i guess this pressure that i felt
[17:11] that if this was something of the lord
[17:14] and i didn't give it to people and it
[17:15] was something to help the people
[17:17] that
[17:18] i if it was and everything happened and
[17:21] it came out later that i somehow would
[17:23] be guilty of withholding a good gift
[17:25] from the people and so i began to think
[17:28] along those lines and i began to
[17:31] under that pressure that i was feeling i
[17:34] moved forward and i asked brother rich
[17:35] to share the dream with the congregation
[17:37] and many of you were there and remember
[17:39] in the fellowship hall sometime towards
[17:41] the end of march he shared the dream
[17:44] and i really want to apologize for that
[17:46] because it wasn't right for me to do
[17:48] that because i asked the brother to
[17:50] share a dream that had no interpretation
[17:53] and at the end of the night there was no
[17:55] conclusion
[17:56] and i feel like looking back
[17:59] that all of that dead was so confusion
[18:02] into the assembly because
[18:05] by the end of the night and by the end
[18:07] of the discussion we still didn't know
[18:09] if this dream had anything to do with
[18:11] coronavirus or not
[18:13] we still didn't know if it did what it
[18:15] meant for us as individuals or us as an
[18:18] assembly there was no conclusion there
[18:20] was no answer and i felt like what i
[18:22] hoped would be help there was really in
[18:24] the end no help for the assembly because
[18:26] there was nothing there was no takeaway
[18:29] there was no action there was nothing
[18:31] that we could gain from that
[18:33] and and so we moved on from there and
[18:34] you know how things transpired through
[18:36] 2020 and into 2021 and
[18:39] and i began to
[18:41] um
[18:42] i could say really begun to be troubled
[18:46] by why god never gave an interpretation
[18:48] when we were all praying for one why
[18:51] if we i really believed in myself that
[18:54] if god gave a gift and we received a
[18:57] gift that god would bless us for
[18:58] receiving a gift i really felt like that
[19:02] if we would just receive what god had
[19:04] then god would give more and if we
[19:06] received it the way god gave it then if
[19:08] we needed interpretation god would send
[19:10] it so i began to be perplexed on why
[19:14] there seemed to be no conclusion no
[19:16] vindication i felt like if we received
[19:19] it god will back it up
[19:20] god will vindicate it but no vindication
[19:23] came
[19:24] no clarity ever came in fact things just
[19:27] continued to get more murky and more
[19:29] unclear and and i felt more unclear and
[19:32] unsettled in myself as time went on
[19:35] and then i realized one day i was
[19:38] reading christ is the mystery of god
[19:39] revealed and this is when uh i had a bit
[19:42] of an awakening and i realized where my
[19:45] stake my mistake was
[19:47] and in christ as the mystery of god
[19:49] revealed in paragraph 332
[19:52] i was reading
[19:53] and it says
[19:55] who did the word of the lord come to
[19:57] prophet alone that's right is that right
[20:00] and the prophet had to be vindicated
[20:03] first
[20:04] not not because he said he was a prophet
[20:06] because he was born a prophet and proved
[20:09] to be a prophet and everything he said
[20:11] was exactly on the word and come to pass
[20:13] then everything else let go
[20:16] and as soon as i read this
[20:18] i actually got out of my seat and got on
[20:20] my knees and began to repent and said
[20:23] god i got ahead of your word
[20:26] because the instructions that we receive
[20:27] here from a prophet are based on the
[20:29] word of god that the
[20:31] prophets not to be received until he's
[20:33] vindicated a prophet first
[20:36] and he says furthermore
[20:38] not not because he says he's a prophet
[20:40] because he's born a prophet and proved
[20:43] to be a prophet and everything he said
[20:45] was exactly on the word and come to pass
[20:48] then everything else let go
[20:50] and suddenly in a moment of time i
[20:52] realized what grave mistake that i had
[20:54] made
[20:55] that i without having vindication first
[20:58] had made a declaration and a
[21:00] presentation to the congregation
[21:02] and believing within myself that god
[21:04] would back up what i was saying with a
[21:07] vindication and with an interpretation
[21:09] and i got it completely backwards in the
[21:12] word i was supposed to get the
[21:14] vindication first amen and then that was
[21:17] god backing it up and then we could
[21:20] receive a prophet and then all the
[21:22] blessings and everything that would come
[21:23] with that would be on it because we'd be
[21:25] in line with the word and so without
[21:28] meaning to and in my ignorance and in my
[21:30] haste and under pressure i realized i
[21:33] got ahead of the word of god and i took
[21:35] action was not appropriate not correct
[21:38] and then i've been mourning over this
[21:40] realizing that i put the congregation in
[21:42] quite a bit of a spiritual tension
[21:45] because i came to the congregation on
[21:47] that february wednesday evening
[21:49] and i declared to you
[21:51] a declaration of what was going on in
[21:54] the assembly one of our brothers in the
[21:56] gift in the office that that would hold
[21:58] but i gave no vindication that would
[22:01] allow you to receive that gift
[22:04] i basically i was asking you to take it
[22:07] on my word
[22:08] and that was wrong that was completely
[22:10] wrong that was never god's way and i
[22:13] didn't mean for it to be that way but
[22:15] that's the way it ended that night
[22:17] because there was nothing else to go
[22:18] with the declaration only i'm telling
[22:21] you this is what's happening
[22:23] and then you you were asked then to
[22:26] believe what i said but i never offered
[22:29] the vindication that must always
[22:31] associate this gift
[22:33] and so i just want to say that i'm sorry
[22:36] i'm very very sorry i know that it
[22:39] created a spiritual tension amongst the
[22:40] body
[22:42] i know that it was wrong
[22:43] and that i'm sorry for the repercussions
[22:46] i'm sorry for the spiritual tension
[22:48] i'm sorry for the confusion
[22:50] and i just want to ask that you would
[22:52] forgive me
[22:53] for this kind of mistake and i and and
[22:55] pray that
[22:56] i never make a mistake like this again
[22:59] because it's been
[23:01] it's been quite agonizing
[23:04] to realize
[23:06] that um
[23:08] with all the efforts to stay on the word
[23:12] that i got off the word
[23:14] with all the desire to keep a church
[23:17] lying to the word and
[23:19] receiving the gifts of god and obeying
[23:21] god and moving with the spirit
[23:23] i got ahead of the spirit of god and i
[23:25] got outside the word and i led a whole
[23:27] congregation
[23:29] away from the word and and expected them
[23:32] to follow me and accepting something
[23:34] that i should have never declared
[23:36] and so i'm sorry
[23:38] and
[23:40] you know as we
[23:41] move from here unfortunately brother
[23:44] rich and i are not in agreement on the
[23:46] direction i'm taking or on how to move
[23:48] forward but i believe this is the right
[23:50] thing to do and i'm asking god
[23:52] to continue to bring us clarity
[23:55] deliver us from ourselves
[23:58] and help us to stay lined up with the
[24:00] word
[24:01] in all things
[24:03] i've
[24:04] i've learned some tremendous lessons
[24:07] and i've learned that
[24:09] the word of god is pure
[24:11] it is perfect
[24:13] it is right in every way
[24:15] and every idea of man is flawed
[24:19] there's a
[24:20] message called standing in the gap where
[24:22] the prophet of god comes and he begins
[24:24] to explain we know it quite well he
[24:26] begins to explain
[24:28] a situation he found himself in under
[24:30] rejection he was wanting to run away
[24:32] and go into the wilderness and all of
[24:34] this and god corrected him but towards
[24:36] the end of that sermon he makes this
[24:38] statement
[24:40] he says we're on our road to meet christ
[24:42] at the end time and i wanted to bring
[24:44] this to you so that you would see and
[24:46] show you
[24:47] that the mistake that a man can make
[24:50] yet being sincere
[24:53] and at first when i read that it
[24:56] comforted me
[24:57] i thought well praise god the prophet of
[25:00] god make a mistake who am i
[25:02] but my comfort very quickly faded away
[25:05] when i realized the impact of that
[25:07] statement
[25:09] it's the mistake that a man can make
[25:12] yet being sincere
[25:14] and then i realized sincerity is not
[25:16] enough
[25:19] sincerity
[25:20] desire
[25:22] study
[25:24] effort
[25:25] is not enough
[25:27] without god we're nothing
[25:30] if god doesn't help us and lead us if
[25:33] god doesn't correct us and open our eyes
[25:36] we're finished
[25:37] we can do nothing literally jesus said
[25:40] without me you can do nothing and that
[25:42] is so literally true
[25:44] i realize that i am completely helpless
[25:47] pathetic
[25:49] without the spirit of god
[25:51] and that the mistake i made i didn't
[25:53] mean to i was sincere i can say it was a
[25:55] mistake and i can say with all the of my
[25:57] heart it was an honest mistake
[25:59] but yet it was a serious mistake
[26:02] and all of that
[26:03] it was serious it has reconcussions it
[26:07] means something
[26:08] and so
[26:10] you know now
[26:12] i realize sincerity
[26:15] effort
[26:16] desire
[26:17] will all fall short
[26:20] there's a scripture that i read and i
[26:23] want to read to you out of psalms 127
[26:25] verse 1.
[26:27] it says except the lord build the house
[26:30] they labor in vain that build it
[26:33] except the lord keep the city the
[26:35] watchman wakeeth but in vain
[26:39] and it's interesting when you look at
[26:40] the beginning of this psalm psalm 127
[26:43] there's a title like before many psalms
[26:46] that gives the author or the writer or
[26:48] or something about the psalm and right
[26:50] at the beginning of the psalm it says a
[26:52] song of degrees for solomon
[26:55] so this song was for solomon written to
[26:58] solomon
[26:59] and we know solomon to be
[27:01] the wisest that there was on the earth
[27:04] up to this time and even jesus referring
[27:06] back to the wisdom of solomon as being
[27:08] the greatest amen when he would declare
[27:10] a greater than solomon is now here
[27:13] and solomon also was the greatest king
[27:15] that israel ever had he had the most
[27:17] power the most wealth the most
[27:19] established kingdom
[27:20] he had peace on every side and every
[27:22] enemy was subject to him there was no
[27:24] danger in solomon's time because ev the
[27:27] enemy had been subjected there was
[27:29] prosperity there was peace it was the
[27:32] golden age of israel
[27:34] and in all the power and in all the
[27:36] wealth and in all the wisdom
[27:39] this saw this psalm was written for
[27:41] solomon
[27:43] except the lord build the house
[27:46] they labor in vain that build it
[27:49] except the lord keep the city
[27:51] the watchman waketh
[27:53] but in vain
[27:57] listen
[27:59] we're helpless
[28:01] without god
[28:04] we are
[28:06] in ourselves in our flesh we are no
[28:08] match for the devil
[28:10] we are no match for the fertility the
[28:12] wisdom
[28:14] of the enemy amen we can
[28:17] we can walk around with a bible in one
[28:19] hand and a message book in the other and
[28:21] if god doesn't open our eyes to the
[28:23] solution in that word we're going to
[28:25] fall flat on our faces reading the bible
[28:28] and reading the message every day of our
[28:30] lives
[28:31] we will read past our solution a hundred
[28:33] times and never see it if god doesn't
[28:35] open our eyes
[28:37] amen we will we will we will try with
[28:40] every effort to do the very best we can
[28:43] and if god doesn't stop us in our tracks
[28:45] we'll go on and make a huge mistake
[28:49] we are desperately dependent upon god
[28:54] and if anything i've learned is how
[28:56] pathetic we are
[28:59] and how wonderful god is
[29:01] and how desperately we need him
[29:04] in every area of our life
[29:09] we need the spirit of god or we will
[29:12] fail
[29:14] in zechariah chapter 4 verse 6
[29:17] it says then he answered and spake unto
[29:19] me saying this is the word of the lord
[29:21] unto zerubbabel saying not by might
[29:24] nor by power
[29:26] but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[29:30] the only way that we will overcome the
[29:34] only way not overcome i'll rephrase that
[29:37] the only way that we will survive
[29:41] is by the spirit of god
[29:44] by the leadership of the holy ghost in
[29:47] our lives by god intervening to stop us
[29:50] from failing by god opening our eyes to
[29:53] our mistakes by god bringing correction
[29:55] when we've gone wrong my god stopping us
[29:58] before we go wrong by god opening his
[30:00] word it is the only way that we will
[30:03] survive in this life without god we will
[30:07] fail
[30:08] we are failures to begin with
[30:12] we are in bodies that are fallen and
[30:14] failed and minds that are fallen or
[30:15] failed and
[30:17] it doesn't matter how gifted we are
[30:20] it doesn't matter how talented we are
[30:22] it doesn't matter how many years of
[30:24] experience we have
[30:26] without the ever present
[30:29] that without the ever-present spirit of
[30:31] god we will fail
[30:35] we can serve god 30 years and fail
[30:38] and so
[30:40] i've learned that
[30:43] there's nothing i can do without him
[30:47] and i'm dependent on him
[30:49] and i need to be comfortably dependent
[30:52] upon him
[30:53] and so i just i'm going to ask tonight i
[30:56] don't there's no no
[30:58] preaching no desire to preach
[31:02] but just to pray
[31:04] we need to pray for god's leadership
[31:07] we need to pray for god
[31:09] i've been praying and asking god to
[31:11] forgive me and
[31:12] been repenting from my failures and
[31:14] asking god to keep his sheep
[31:16] through it all and we just need to pray
[31:20] there's not
[31:21] a man alive that we can trust in
[31:26] i hate to say that but there's not a man
[31:28] alive we can trust in
[31:30] only christ
[31:32] can we trust him
[31:34] there's not a gift or a gifted person
[31:36] that we can sit back and rest in
[31:38] we have to trust in god giving us his
[31:40] leadership
[31:42] and
[31:43] there's not a church that we can trust
[31:45] in
[31:46] for without god leading every step the
[31:48] church will fail
[31:50] the pastor will fail the ministers will
[31:52] fail the officers will fail
[31:55] we are we are so dependent on god i just
[31:58] would like to take some time
[32:00] this evening before we're dismissed and
[32:02] just pray together
[32:04] and earnestly pray pray that god would
[32:07] forgive us and god would keep us
[32:09] i really covet your prayers i pray that
[32:11] god would you would ask god to guide me
[32:13] step by step and let me be more
[32:15] sensitive to a spirit than i've ever
[32:17] been before
[32:18] and that god would give me revelation
[32:20] and god would give me you know the
[32:22] correct answer to every question because
[32:24] there are there are questions every day
[32:27] there are decisions to make and and i'm
[32:29] a little gun-shy
[32:31] i'm a little
[32:32] fearful to pull the trigger
[32:34] i just need you to pray that god would
[32:36] give us clarity give us vision give us
[32:39] his vision his discernment give us the
[32:42] right understanding of his word and the
[32:44] right application for that word because
[32:46] we need him to do so
[32:48] and i'm going to ask you two to pray for
[32:50] the officers of the church
[32:52] the deacons and trustees and pray for
[32:54] the ministers that have to break the
[32:55] bread of life
[32:57] amen it's a fearful thing for a fallen
[32:59] human being to have to handle something
[33:01] so perfect and so precious and try their
[33:04] best not to ruin it
[33:07] we need to pray for one another we need
[33:08] to pray for the gifts among us we need
[33:10] to pray for our song leaders and for our
[33:12] musicians because i can tell you the
[33:15] devil would love to enter in any place
[33:17] he could enter in and bring a disruption
[33:20] and get us off the word if there's not
[33:22] one place it'll be another place and if
[33:24] this door is closed he's constantly
[33:26] shaking the doors to find where he can
[33:28] get in and we need to bind ourselves
[33:31] together and pray for one another
[33:33] there's not a gift among us that's not
[33:35] susceptible
[33:38] there's not a gift among us
[33:40] that's not in danger
[33:42] of being misled
[33:44] and misleading others
[33:46] and so we need to pray
[33:48] and i just pray that you would forgive
[33:50] me and
[33:53] and pray for me
[33:55] and i will pray for you
[33:57] man let's all stand together
[34:00] i'm going to ask josiah decide if you
[34:02] can come forward
[34:03] i just want to sing one song together
[34:05] and i want to go to prayer
[34:07] and
[34:09] and we're not going to get back together
[34:11] and dismiss we're just going to pray
[34:13] you're welcome to pray at your seat or
[34:15] pray at the altar i'm going to be
[34:16] spending some time at the altar asking
[34:18] god to
[34:19] keep us
[34:21] and you're welcome to join me who all
[34:23] would like to pray
[34:24] if you need to be dismissed you can be
[34:26] dismissed any time you want we won't
[34:27] have a dismissal when you're done
[34:29] praying you're welcome just to dismiss
[34:31] yourself and go as you feel led to go
[34:35] and we will
[34:38] we will trust
[34:40] in the only one who can keep us
[34:43] we will put our confidence in the only
[34:45] place to put our confidence
[34:47] that almighty god who proved that he
[34:50] loves us by sending us his word
[34:52] will to be the one that keeps us
[34:55] in that word
[34:57] you can have the word
[34:58] but if he doesn't keep us in the word
[35:01] will fail in the word
[35:02] and i believe with all my heart we've
[35:04] got the true word the vindicated word
[35:06] the pure word
[35:08] but without
[35:09] him
[35:10] showing us revealing to us that word
[35:13] we're going to fail
[35:16] and so we need to pray for one another
[35:19] and i'm asking to earnestly pray
[35:22] that god would help us
[35:23] i'm sorry
[35:25] for any confusion that we caused in the
[35:27] assembly i'm sorry for anybody that was
[35:29] hurt
[35:30] i'm sorry for the spiritual pressure
[35:32] that we put on individuals i'm sorry for
[35:34] the spiritual pressure that i put on
[35:36] brother rich by moving forward for the
[35:38] spiritual pressure in his family i'm
[35:40] sorry
[35:42] i'm sorry for every negative effect that
[35:44] this decision has made i'm really really
[35:46] sorry
[35:47] and i pray that god would
[35:50] cover a multitude of sins
[35:52] and that god would heal and god would
[35:54] restore
[35:55] god will fix anything is broken and
[35:57] wrong god will bring clarity wherever
[35:58] there's confusion because i can't do it
[36:01] but i'm depending on him to do the part
[36:04] that we can't do
[36:06] so before we go to prayer i'm going to
