by the works we have done but by thy Grace and thy Grace alone into thy presence we come without the music as a prayer and thy presence we come it's not by the works we have done but by thy Grace and thy grace alone into th presence we come one more time and to thy presence we come not by the works we done oh by thy Grace and thy grace alone in into thy presence we come amen God bless you this morning let's bow our heads together Lord we're so thankful Lord that we can come into your presence not just in a building Lord but anytime you've invited us to come but God we've set aside this time to join ourselves together Lord to come according to your command to to un unify ourselves Lord and to look unto you and to feed from your hand we pray God that you would just come down and break the bread of life for us Feed Us Lord as your sheep we wait upon you Lord and trust in you for we've come according to your provided way Lord I pray you would take this vessel of My Flesh under your control and Minister Lord through a gift you've placed there help me to stay completely out of your way and let you do what you want to do this morning for I want to be a surrendered vessel a tool that's in your hand God I'm trusting in you you to deliver your word God strengthen us equip us encourage us correct us help us Lord to have all that we need in this life for we know that it comes from you father and only by you will we be able to move and do what you've called us to do in this hour we ask for your blessings over this service we thank you for the privilege of being here for drawing us together in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you amen if you take your Bibles we're going to go to the book of Hebrews and as you're turning there I just want to say I'm so happy to see some snow on the ground I know some of you may not agree with me I mean we don't have to agree amen God said God's children he made a variety when he made his children some like the mountains some like the deserts some like this and that but I like winter and somebody think says thinks I'm perverted because Winter's a sign of death but you know somebody's got to like it amen but no I always say if it's going to be C cold it might as well be pretty amen so I'm thankful that we could still drive to church and the roads were good and everybody made it safely want to thank you for that or thank God for that but also I wanted to mention it reminds me that every year you know we have the potential of snowstorms and it comes up and it looked like this year was going to be none but it's always the potential and I just want to remind everybody that you know we we will do the best we can myself and the deacons with the input of the trustees as well try to make the best decision for the congregation when it gets to that weather and you know one thing I hate about weather is every storm comes Saturday night Sunday morning or Wednesday afternoon so you can about guarantee when it's going to snow yeah and so that's always frustrating for me because I I either want it to be clearly you can't do it or clearly it's safe and it's never that way it's always something in between and so just pray for us when we get into that situation that we can make the right decision amen we certainly want to have church every time we possibly can have it and we've always said before I said many times if you feel uncomfortable please don't drive those who can come will come we'll have service you can stream the problem is as soon as I say that people will come anyways and everybody knows that if that's a hard service to get to that's going to be a really good service so I'm going to go is that right so we know the way we all think we all think the same way you're like oh you can't hardly get there I'm going so that being the case sometimes we have to make a decision and sometimes you have to make a call early enough ahead for those who live far away and have to drive so that they're not already on the road and sometimes it's a good decision sometimes it's a bad decision so we just pray ask you pray for us and if we make a bad decision forgive us but you know the reason why we want to do the best we can for the congregation and keep everybody safe it would be really hard for us to make this decision and hear if somebody got off the road Road and got in a ditch and that would be terrible so we just pray that God will continue to give us his leadership so that we know what he wants us to do amen and I hope we get a big old gigantic snowstorm Monday morning someday and it's all cleaned up by Wednesday that would thrill my heart amen amen Hebrews chapter 10 let's look together at verse 23 Hebrews chap 10: 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see that day approaching amen God bless you as you have your seats and may the Lord bless us as we look into it his word may he give us eyes to see and ears to hear amen this this morning I'd like to preach a subject on the blessing and protection of the home Church the blessing and the protection of the home church this is something that struck me some time ago I don't remember how long ago and I jotted a few things down and that happens sometimes I'll catch inspiration it happens many times I'll jot it down on a piece of paper and throw it and uh and throw it in my uh briefcase and I'll have it with me and then when something strikes I'll pull it out this is what happened uh this this just struck me and come back and there there's a reason I'll get to the scripture that really made me start meditating on this it's not this one it's a different one and when I get there I'll let you know because it's the blessing and protection of the home church and here we have uh uh an admonishment in the book of Hebrews we have a command that we hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering and but let us consider one another to provoke un to love and good work works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching so we know that we see that day approaching that we're at the end time the finality of everything is closing in and that evil day is upon us amen but we also been given instruction what to do in that day and that's to gather together and to provoke one another to love in good works and to exhort one another amen so so that's the purpose of Us coming together is to provoke one another to love and good works I love this word provoke in the in the New Testament it's really an interesting word because at first it doesn't seem to be a very pleasant word to provoke is to irritate you know I I I don't really want to read that let's irritate one another into loving good works but really it's almost like a poking in you know it's like a cattle prod it's like the ox goat in the back that little poke to move forward amen and there's there's times that we can encourage one another I don't think through irritation I don't think that's the that's the full meaning of that but we do we have a responsibility one another and we need to be subject to one another and we need one another the reality is that we don't do well all by ourselves and God never intended us for us Believers to be all by ourselves and there's something that the fellowship does for one another when we can encourage one another amen and sometimes that encouragement is because you realize that when you come in the midst of your brothers and sisters that some of the things you're thinking and doing aren't working there's that little that little rub that little push and you realize that statement didn't fly amen that action is not working I can't say that in the company of my brothers and I can't do that in within the earshot or ey shot of my brothers and sisters amen and what that's doing is that's just prodding us along into the things that are good amen because we are all still human beings and we all still have a sticky cobber nature we all still live in the midst of leod deia and we need one another for the encouragement to keep moving forward some of that is positive encouragement I say it's all positive encouragement because it goes in a positive direction but Su of is the very fact that a brother will say I don't agree with that brother I don't think that's healthy I don't think that's good or please don't talk about that brother to me I don't think we should say things like that amen and that's a provoking but not because we're trying to irritate one another you understand what I'm saying but it's just saying you know that that conduct won't fly in the midst of the congregation I know that I can't just say whatever I want I can't just do whatever I want I there's something that about coming together that actually keeps our mind aligned to the things that are right amen and now we know there's a balance to that we're going to talk about about that as we move further down but then it goes now we we're to assemble ourselves together and exhort one another so much more as you see the day approaching this word ex exort is also interesting and I'll there's a lot of words that uh it's it's translated into but I want to read some of the definition says to address or speak to which may be done in the way of exhortation in treaty Comfort instruction also exhorting and comforting and encouraging encouraging and strengthening instructing and teaching this is all exhorting so when we get together to exhort one another what are we doing it's you can say exhorting if we could use just the term that we would all understand is coaching exhorting is encouraging a amen strengthening also comforting intreating instructing amen bringing comfort and encouragement we're here to do that for one another because we need that it's a command in the scriptures because we need that we don't come all the way up to the end of all things and the capping off of everything in the stature of a perfect man and we come to the perfect strength and understanding of the word and now I don't need anybody I've come to maturity that's not in the scriptures the scriptures aren't written that way amen when we come to the capping off of the church when we come uh uh to the adoption amen it doesn't it doesn't do away with this need for the body because we've come to maturity we have a perfect no amen because if it was so it wouldn't be in the scriptures that we need to come together to provoke one another to love and good works and to exhort one another amen so we need the body and it's a blessing to have the body now when I'm talking about the body just today for today's purposes I'm just speaking of the local body or a Home church and we know that this the the home church is not the whole body of Christ it's a universal body of of Christ everywhere and that we make up just a teeny fragment of that Global body but but like I've said before what works in the macrocosm works in the microcosm so what works for the entire body of Christ works for the local body as well so I'm I'm going to speak Amen on terms of the local body but I'm not in any way doing away with the global body so don't don't think those thoughts we still must be engaged with the body around the world we still must be a part and parcel giving and exchanging provoking and encouraging with every believer not just the ones we fellowship with in the place that we go and assemble ourselves so so don't think I'm saying that amen I'm just I'm laying I'm I'm laying out the the the guidelines so nobody gets their mind going because there's always something else you can say on every subject you can always further balance it amen there's no way you can come to every subject and say he said that but what about there's always a butt what about but just know that I'm just talking about the local church and then no one way discouraging us from fellowship in the global church that's still a requirement in Proverbs 27 let's turn there together we're going to uh uh pull in a few scriptures as we move along I actually have quite a bit that I want to share I I don't that doesn't mean I'm necessarily going to be a long time so don't get nervous but I have quite a bit that I want to share and I actually don't want to rush through it so I'm actually going to take take my time but that doesn't mean that I'm going to take a long time it just means I'm not going to talk super super fast don't get nervous I'm going to take my time Proverbs 27 verse1 17 iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend amen there's a purpose be with this fellowship and friendship and it it's not necessarily just always make us feel good although it does but as iron sharpeneth iron uh metal against metal will bring out a sharpening a keenness a sharpening down and also a removing of access material and a friend can do this for a friend but it says a friend can sharpen the countenance of his friend this word countenance actually means face he can sharpen the face of his friend but I I mean I don't think we're supposed to do that physically some friends have sharpened the face of their friends in the past but but that face means your presence or your person or your personage and your very presence and who you are is being shaped by your relationships and fellowship and it's very very important that's why it's important who we company with amen this is the very reason it matters who we keep company with amen and and also you know all of us uh we're all the we're all the same in many ways I know there's a variation in personalities there's a variation but there's also a commonality because of being human beings and being in this hybrid flesh and the commonality is none of us none of us none of us none of us really enjoy conflict enjoy differences or enjoy uh being challenged some people love to argue but not all of us love to be challenged amen but it's that very challenge of a friend amen that actually makes us who we are and sometimes if we only find friends that align with our thinking and agree with everything we ever say Amen maybe that's not the friend that we need the most amen maybe sometimes we need that friend that has a different viewpoint on things sometimes and is not afraid to say I don't understand that no run that past me one more time how did you get to that conclusion and you're like don't challenge me you're my friend just say you're a wonderful person everything you think is amazing and you there's no fault in you ever those are all the friends that I want around me that that's not going to accomplish the purpose of a iron sharpening iron and a friend sharpening the face of a friend your very being your very person so we don't want to be afraid of those things as long as it's love as long as it's a friend not contention and arguing and St that's never the purpose amen but it's so good that God in every assembly and in all of our friendships I mean how many times have you seen two of the exact identical personality type get married they say opposites attract for a reason that became a saying for a reason that wasn't just made up amen why because we need different perspectives Amen to keep us moving down the center of the line right and so it's very uncommon for two of The Identical personality Ty you have two super outgoing super flamboy amen super energetic people married together nope usually if you have one that's really strong one way you'll have one that's almost as strong the other way and they come together so our friendships amen what God put us together and in a body of Believers amen we we you have you'll find every personality type amen why because it's for the benefit of each of us for the whole and so we find that in a home church when we come together to Fellowship it's more than just sitting in our seat attending a church service there's much more we're to provoke one another to love and good works we're to uh uh uh um we're to encourage one another we're to strengthen One Another We're to sharpen one another's countenance so there's so much more to the home Church than just I sit in this Pew on Sunday and Wednesday that's not that's not really a home church if all we do is walk in the last minute sit down here the service walk back out the door and never talk to anybody never have any Fellowship no disc discussions no interaction really I think we've missed some of the benefit of a home Church brother B said in the voice of the sign he said now tomorrow is Sunday and there'll be Sunday School in churches the reason we have our services in the afternoon on Sunday is so we won't interrupt any service at all we believe every Christian ought to have a home church that they go to every Christian ought to meet somewhere with Believers and wherever you meet that's the church and brother Ram's not limiting that to location or size it can be in a home it can be four three four five Believers it can be a large place it can be a rented facility be building a traditional Church it can be a home I mean he's had services in trailers so it's it does not he's saying but a place where the Believers gathered together everybody he said every Christian ought to meet somewhere with Believers he says I believe every Christian ought to have a home Church they go to now when I say that I also want to uh uh make a disclaimer amen I I realize that so this is preaching through the choir because you're all here but I want us to understand the benefit and the protection of what God's given us so I want to do some teaching on this because it's not like saying you guys need to have a home Church you're like I'm here every one of you you're here I mean you have a home church so I I know this is preaching through the choir but we're laying down the foundation so we can move to what does that actually mean in our lives what is that producing and and and more than anything when I walk away from the end of the service today I want to be thankful to God that he's given us a fellowship I want to realize how precious that is and what a benefit it is and how meaningful it is that we're not alone that we're not walking this path alone we're not uh you know and there's some people that don't have the privilege of that there's many circumstances that are out there and I'm not here to judge them all and say if you don't have a home Church you're you're you're you're toast brother bam said everybody needs one but many people find themselves in between for whatever reasons they have a pastor who dies a church who disbands they have their bed fast now amen there's all kinds of reasons people get stuck in situations whether permanent or temporary and I'm not here to judge that God will take care of them he knows the motive and intent of the heart but the general rule I'm speaking in generalities everybody needs a home church and it's not so I can check that box and say now I'm right no you need need a home church God knows that you need a home not to say uh brother B said I need a home Church check and brother B said I need a rest check and no it's has nothing to do with checking the boxes it has everything to do with realizing I'm not going to church because brother bam said go to church I'm going to church cuz he said it for a reason because it's the word because I need it this is the problem amen we find so many times even in our fellowships you have people who will do it amen but they always kind of Stay On The Fringe of the home Church never fully in integrated never fully committed never giving their all amen because they're checking a check box that I've done what brother B said but the home church is more than just a place we slip in and slip out amen God wants us to be engaged there's no sharpening of the countenance when we just slip in and slip out there's so much more benefit amen that we're we we are meant to gain than just that's where I go hear the word and leave amen amen so there's a reason that he laid down these principles there's a reason it's in the word there's a reason we we're taught these things and when we don't understand what it's doing for us then we don't give the proper Credence to it that we should he also said in the message what house will you build me and when this message is in 1965 uh Perry green had just opened the church in Tucson and there was many Believers that went down there when brother Brenham went and they didn't have a church they could to go to amen they were and they had been out of fellowship and brother B starts talking about we had folks that were just laying home on Sundays kids little kids were riding their bicycles on Sunday in the street and no church to fellowship at no place to come and brother bam comes in that service and he says now that brother green God has sent him here and opened us up a church of like Precious faith that we believe in we ought to be very grateful to God and attend every service and take every place that we can if we are asked and called on to pray seek to do let's be soldiers right at it just anxious to do it he's talking about being a contributor not just a an attender but a contributor am keep the message honorable live the right kind of life don't let no smut come upon it we're living too late now we're too late in the hour let's live it clean uh or my life your life all of our Lives need to be picked up before God Amen uh our young people just ride around from place to place from show to show drifting further and further away from God now that's the truth I see it in my children I see it in myself getting to a place we not you've got to assem you've got to assemble ourselves together to worship God the Bible said so when we see this day approaching that much more come together if there's only two people here you be one of them and if we come together and worship together then we just then we just something or another about it Jesus said where two or three are gathered in my name there I am and there mened so brother bham when he comes to preach what house will you build me it's the dedication of that Tabernacle and and and and he's so thankful that God gave him a place to come to he was expressing his gratitude he was expressing the need and the people for it it wasn't working the way it was before he also said in the sermon of spirits every man ought to have a church home you ought to have a place not just to float about from Pillar To Post but have somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church somewhere you pay your tithe and somewhere that you help support the cause see when we when we look at some of the things the prophet's saying it's not just a place that I go to get but it's also a place I go to give because that's iron sharpening iron that's provoking one another to love and good works and and we if we don't take away the right mentality amen then I just go to church to get and then sometimes we'll we'll walk away and disappoint cuz I didn't get anything but the question is what did you give what we're here to support the work amen we're here to create an atmosphere brother Benham said an atmosphere you can have a birth in the right kind of atmosphere so we're coming together sometimes what we're coming for amen is just to create the right kind of atmosphere so somebody can be born and in the service we're lending our support amen we're we're throwing our shoulder to the wheel for the work of God to move it on because this is one of God's mechanisms the home church this is God's part of God's plan and we're throwing oursel into it committed to it to receive and to give not just to get something out of it but to give something as well to be a contribut a contributing Force amen not just a drain amen none of us want to be the parasite in the church sucking sucking sucking sucking but never giving anything back we all want to be we want to have a symbiotic relationship where we're giving and taking giving and taking G that's a healthy relationship amen amen so it's it's uh very very important that we have someplace that you help support the cause we're not all flying solo that's right amen God wants us to come together to work together for the kingdom of God like I said there's a balance to that we'll talk about that we don't want to get anything out of balance but we we'll speak on that in just a few minutes but I want to go to the scripture now that really started my mind uh meditating on this if you can go to 1 Corinthians chapter 5 this came to me one day I wasn't even reading the Scripture it just dropped in my heart and I started meditating on it and I really got an inspiration and and been meditating on on it since and in 1 Corinthians chapter 5 I'm going to read this and it's going to read as a negative portion of the scripture but I'm not going to take it in a negative way so we're going to look at 1 Corinthians chapter 5 and I'm going to begin right at the beginning of the chapter in verse one and it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father father's wife and you are puffed up and have not not rather mourned that he that ha done this deed might be taken away from among you for I verily as absent in the body but present in the spirit have judged already as though I were present concerning him that has so done this deed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when you are gathered together in my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus your glorying is not good know you not that A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump so I I I it was that scripture in this next quote that I'm going to read that came together and this quote is out of questions and answers on the Holy Ghost says that's what's the matter with the churches today when a man comes into the body of Christ and becomes one of the members and starts doing evil instead of you all getting together and doing this very same thing you brandom Tabernacle do that because as as long as you're holding him up he's under the blood and he just keeps doing the same old thing over and over and over all the time you get together and turn him over to the devil for the destruction of the flesh that his Spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord and watch the whip of God come in watch The Devil take a hold of him that's an evil spirit gets him and this boy he's referring back to the scripture this boy here straightened out he come back we find out in second Corinthians where he really cleaned up before God so we we when we talk about that as in the form of church discipline it it has a very negative feel to it because nobody ever likes this there's never been I I don't know nothing that I'm aware of where church discipline has been administered and everybody feels good about it I mean it's terrible but the reality is if it's if it's if what what I what I want to back up and say is what I felt what I was meditating on what struck me was not that you got to put away the evildoer what struck me is if you're not the church is actually protecting him from wrath that's what actually struck me that the church is a barrier and a protecting Force against wrath and against evil spirits that actually God would discipline this man and God would whip him with an evil spirit but because he was in the church and in the fellowship there was a barrier even against the whip of God and this began to just astonish me amen the power power and the level of protection that a home church has now if a home church has this level of protection against this evil spirit that be a whip of God to drive the man back amen what about all the other evil spirits that are around is the home Church also a barrier to those demons of sickness Demons of this Demons of depression amen all of a sudden between this scripture and the quote I realize there's a power and a level of protection just being in the local the body of Christ and in the home church amen that we need to be aware of because there's a tremendous benefit we have no idea what our lives would actually be like if we removed ourselves and stepped out from this protection that is there by the grace of God brother Brenham says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit amen because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and baptizes unto his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word amen so now now where is that blood protection amen amen the church is the blood by the spirit why because the blood represents the life where's the life in the body in the body of Christ in his body on Earth amen which is a many membered body amen and in that is the very Life of Christ and there's a certain buffer Amen in our lives and the and and there was nothing happening to this man until the church removed him from the buffer they had the Paul was telling them remove this man from the buffer and now listen I'm not talking about all the trials and things that come to our life that shape us and teach us and educate us and give us testimony there's still all of that but beyond all of that there's something about the body and being in the body and being in Fellowship that protects us from evil spirits and now that Paul's saying a amen you're you're not doing this man any good and you're not doing the church any good yeah right because and this is the danger this is where it gets really dangerous and this is where it really becomes problematic amen when you leave that sin that repetitive against the word unrepentant sin when you leave that in the body there'll be a certain level of protection and God may not destroy that man but what it happens is it becomes a leaven in the church and slowly begins to leaven the whole lump until the whole church becomes sick and weak and deteriorated so that's why these things are important both ways it's important that these issues don't just get swept under the rug and and let let go and they have to be dealt with amen for the for the benefit of those who are in error and for the benefit of everybody else and the Apostle Paul gives this instruction for a reason and we see it in the scripture work for this man comes later and he repents and Paul says he that repented bring quickly back into Fellowship unless he' be discouraged Paul's not interested in punishment for punishment's sake Paul is interested in reconciliation and restitution he's looking at the soul and the health of the church so now we realize that now being in this Fellowship offers us a protection that I don't think we're actually fully aware of we there's a unity and a bond in a local church and in the global Church we're speaking of local church there's a unity and a bond that actually does something special for us there's also a life in the midst of the body amen which is the Life of Christ which is the spirit of God which is the representation of the blood and it buffers us from so much of life there's so many there's so many uh things that the world deals with if you work work with people at work uh you talk to your Associates at work at school or wherever or family members who on Believers the the issues and the things that they have to deal with sometimes are shocking the level of mental illness and depression the the levels of childhood Rebellion the the levels of marriage issues and struggles and it's astronomical and and we say well we don't deal with all those things we all have things we deal with we understand that we all have things that come but when you begin to compare it to somebody outside it's it's just a different level altogether and you realize that there's something that God is doing for us that's very very special and we say Amen it's the word it's the effect of the word it is it's the effect of the word but having a local church and coming together is also the effect of the word all works together the the word is affected in our lives and it's affecting us and it's helping us amen we're we're we're coming together and bringing prayer requests together and brother B said if you got these prayer requests write them down lay them up here in the desk and let the song leader whoever read them and pray together over them and see what God will do amen it's simple it's not complicated he didn't make it complicated he says when you're gathered together in this atmosphere amen We've Come Together according to the word and there's needs in the body present those needs back to the body when the body agrees together in prayer amen see what God will do and we see it over and over and over and it's so simple it's just become expected is that right and it's simple obedience to the instructions of a prophet and faith in God's word I mean it's just very very simple it's not complicated amen you don't have to work ourselves into a fevered pitch we don't have to have an allight prayer meeting don't there's anything wrong with that but it's the Simplicity of being gathered together Harmony and unity focused on the same thing and there's a need in the body the needs presented the body prays about it together simple it may take 2 minutes amen it's over with and then the prayer requests start rolling in I was delivered I was healed I I the my doctor said they can't find it anymore how many times do you find that the level of malpractice Among Us is absolutely a misdiagnosis is astronomical I wonder if it's the same rates that everybody else experiences how many times the doctor says we got to do more tests I see a shadow I see a spot this looks bad I'm really detecting cancer I'm thinking this and we do the simple Act of just writing out a little T somebody just simply speaking and simply pray nothing I mean listen we don't shoot off fireworks we don't you know really work it up with the music just the Simplicity of agreeing together as a body and then we get another testimony I went back for further test I had an MRI the CAT scan was scary the MRI says there's nothing they can't find a thing and you think there's a lot of bad MRI machines around Lio Ohio bad CAT scans or whatever CT scans or are bad rate no I I I think there's something Supernatural taking place in the Simplicity of a local [Applause] body the fact that we come together in obedience to the word surrendering submitting to one another and loving one another does a tremendous work you know love is healing right you know when you write out a a prayer request or share a need and all of a sudden you get texts how are you feeling or somebody in the forest says what's going on they shake your hand and say I'll be praying for you this week do you realize that that's also bringing healing you know how many how many times just today I wrote it down in the back just today sh sister Sharon Rass talked about her KNE surgery she's doing well and all the support all the expressions of love the food and all the things that she received amen it's not just that God goes and stitches together and meniscus tear but you know your body amen has the capacity to heal itself but when they know when that body gets under stress and all out of source it starts to affect your immune system so sometimes our healing may just be amen that healing that comes to our spirit and our soul amen that relaxes us and brings us peace and love and unity and Harmony and true friendship and fellowship and it begins to work everything right in our body and allow the healing to move we always think it's one way but but it's more brother brah said God heals through music God heals through nature amen God heals God heals through love God cast out Spirits by love amen amen you know ah it's amazing that the brother B would say things like this because it makes you think different about everything how many times I mean it may not be all the ministers getting together and laying on their hands and screaming in the face of somebody to cast a demon out it may just be the love of the fellowship that starts to move that thing it loses its grip and loses its power we are so free as a people why are we so free why do we have so many testimonies why has God delivered us from so many things Why do husbands and wives get along so well why do children come in harmony with their parents why are we we seeing fellowship and healing and deliverance amen I I think I don't think it's just one thing I can't say it's because we come to church I'm not I'm not going to take that jump but there's something with Fellowship that brings a spiritual strength amen that helps everything else in the kingdom of God work so we don't want to unplug any of it we want to keep everything plugged in to get the full benefit amen amen let's turn to John 13 together I still want to keep thinking about this protection of the local church if it could protect a man living in fornication from the whip of God from an evil spirit which would be the whip of God if it can protect a man from that what can it protect us who are serving God with all our hearts from it's amazing to me that honestly when that thing dropped in my heart it blew me blew my mind wide open to everything I said this is amazing no wonder Paul said for forsake not the assembling together of yourselves no wonder when he said when you're to gathered together with the deacons and the elders gather yourself together there's something more happening than in just I'm going to hear a scripture now I understand that Bible verse better there's more happening than just that that's part of it amen that's a huge part of but that's not all of it amen John 13:12 so after he had washed their feet and had taken His Garment and sat down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sick greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them amen before this he tells Simon Peter he says I'm going to wash your feet and Simon Peter says no you're not going to wash my feet and Jesus says if I wash you not you have no part with me then he says well don't just through my feet if that's the case do everything I love Peter Peter's a bit of an extremist is that true John's the Apostle of love amen uh Peter's a bit of an extremist he's got that Burly Faith amen and guess what among us we have those that are love and we have some of those that are burly faith we have some that are a little bit extreme on everything they do and some that are a little bit soft on everything they do to some of us everything is wrong and important and must be dealt with immediately for others it's like ah it's not that big a deal it'll be okay they didn't really mean it right right but brother Brenham saw amen that at the end of the ministry God put Faith and love together because Faith worketh by love amen and he brought Peter and John together and they were as opposite as night and day but they needed one another Amen to administer so so in an assembly God has all kinds amen but it's for the health of the entire assembly you got to have somebody once in a while that'll stand up and say what are we doing about this and why aren't we doing anything about it this is a problem yes but you also got to have somebody who says listen it's not as big a deal as you think it's okay they're new they don't know what they're doing they're let's just let it go and you need both because if not if you lean one way or the other in some point you're going to find yourself off the rails one way or the other so thank God for a fellowship of believers who have like Precious faith and they're they're in unity under the headship of Christ but but they're not uniform because uniformity is not necessarily Unity we can try to create uniformity we all only do the same things we only like the same things we only dress in the same things we only wear the same colors we only drive the same type of car yeah not one of you get a sports car that's worldly and if you put a lift kit on your truck praise be to God and if you drive a minivan you're nothing praise God I love it we we're not looking for uniformity we're asking for Unity uniformity brings weakness amen that's right if you build a a stone wall or brick wall and all the bricks are the same shape it's not as strong as if you use mismatched Stone if you use mismatched Stone and they interlock together and you have these odd pieces sticking out and then other other rocks wrap around that odd piece and you've seen stone walls like that when you see that come together that's the way the pyramids are built they're not all the same size and shape Stone amen but all the different stones have come together in unity for one purpose but they're not they're they're not uniform so you look at the Great Pyramid that Enoch built it's not uniform but it's unified there's a there's a huge difference between uniformity and unification yeah amen so we want to be in the unity of purpose we want to be the unity of spirit the unity of mind but in order to accomplish that God is going to put together different size Stones amen because it's stronger that's what makes the pyramid earthquake proof yeah amen other ancient buildings that are built and stone walls that are built this way have survived earthquake after earthquake after earthquake for thousands of years amen and the church Will Survive the earthquakes of this world Amen when God puts all the pieces together and they begin to trust one another interlock together work together in unity and Harmony and love one another and not say you're an odd Stone well I mean that one could turn around and say well you're an odd Stone too but you're your odity here and my odity here are supposed to go together like this sir amen I said before I had I had a a thought one time about marriage and you know those little um uh uh uh I don't know what you call them it's a necklace and they'll have a broken heart and you get two halves one the guy can take one the girl can take and you put them together they're a perfect match you know those two things are not exact replicas of one another where this one has this big piece sticking out this one has an indentation where this one has another piece sticking out this one has an indentation yeah and when you put them together you get a whole unit amen and you're like why is that thing all messed up you know if I was making I would just make it around with a straight line you know that's the way it should look and I would magnetize so you clip them together they go right every time and I would put little guards on the top of the bottom so you can't mismatch it I'm weird I have an oddity amen I I need other Oddities around me to keep me balanced but that's not the way it's made it's made so they have to interlock the hole is only made when these two different parts come together and they strengthen one another my wife has attributes that I do not possess our family would suffer greatly if it wasn't for God putting a father and a mother together with different attributes and amen so that they could express to the kids and understand all the situations in life through these two different visions and the two different Visions come together in harmony not because they see the exact same thing amen because they're serving the exact same purpose to raise these children and fear admonition of the Lord that's what brings our unification not because we always agree on everything and not because we always see everything the same way but we're unified in purpose amen we're not we're not uniform in personality and has made our family stronger am so that's what the local body provides for us if we allow it if we allow it so now sorry I got off the rails there for a minute now we come back to what we call feet washing Peter says Wash Me All I Want It All Jesus says no you're clean but your feet you're all clean but your feet you need not say be washed you are all clean you need not sa washed except thy feet and so he it's interesting that he would say only your feet need to be washed because Jesus told them previously you are clean through the word that I've spoken to you you're clean through the word that I've spoken to you and we know that as a bride we are washed in the water of the word we're clean through the word that he's given to us Washed by the Water of the bleeding word but yet Jesus said that I'm going to have to wash your feet but and then he told him you wash one another's feet he didn't say wash everybody's whole body he said you wash one another's feet and and and when you understand this from the Bible times I've preached it before so many of you understand that when they would go to the bath houses they weren't necessarily bathing in their homes they were bathing in the bath houses and the Romans brought this in and and and the Jews also would take ceremonial bathing and you take come from the bath house amen you're clean but walking from the bath house to the house house you walk on a Dusty Street in a pair of sandals and walking the walk in the world your feet can become dirty but it doesn't mean you're all dirty amen and the same is true for us amen we've been cleansed we've been Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ the washing of the water of the word has cleansed us but as human beings we are still walking in a very dirty world and Jesus would now take on the role of a servant and kneel down and wash those dirty Dusty feet amen of the disciples amen because he wanted them to be all clean and he was going to serve this function for them but he says if I'm your master take my example and you do this to one another amen because why because in this life you and I are going to walk through this world and we may pick up a little dust on our feet we may get a little bit manure off the road and we're going to need our brothers and sisters to bear with us and help us wash that off God has left a portion he cleans by the washing of the water of the word amen but he told us to come to feet washing and communion not I mean this water out here is not doing the job it's symbolic amen it's a reminder it's it's something for us to do Amen on a on a continual basis to remind us that we must be serving one another but how are we to serve one another by humbling ourselves bearing with one another and taking the dirt of this world off of each other we need one another we need to wash one another how do we wash one another through Fellowship through the word through love through care amen we can wash one another not just once a month right that's just the symbol the reminder the the the the the reason for us to pause and think about but let's continually humble ourselves and serve one another amen and let's keep one another clean that's the whole purpose of provoking one another to love and good works amen let's go to First Corinthians 11 this is the other scripture that we read many times in communion so if there's a service that we can do for each other of washing of the feet then there's a strength a power a barrier in the body of Christ to keep us clean and that's our brothers and our sisters that's why brother B said every Christian needs a home church when you get out into isolation and get on your own then all of a sudden listen this is this is just the truth so just believe me am you get separated from fellowship and get on your own and you can go to the same church and separate yourself from fellowship because you can get your feelings hurt and draw pull away you can sit in the pews but still not be when you do that every thought you have now becomes the Holy Ghost every feeling you feel about something every thought you have every decision you make becomes the Holy Ghost because there's nobody there to sharpen amen there's nobody there to say but what about when brother B said this or what about that scripture did you think about that cuz the problem with our perspective is that's our perspective right the problem with perspective is that's the only thing you see you can see there's so many people that preach on balance balance balance and we know you have to have balance the reality is nobody on this planet knows if they're balanced or not if I have a three Dee tilt and then I declare I'm balanced I'm judging everybody around me on my 3° tilt but I'm blind to myself I don't even know that I've got this leaning this way I think I'm perfectly balanced have a perfect understanding of the message my heart is pure I'm completely innocent and all of a sudden I left flesh behind and don't have a sticky cocko nature anymore and cannot amen be tilted one way or the other I am perfectly in Bound this is the problem with pride and this is the problem with separating oursel from fellowship because sometimes you'll have a three degree tilt this way and your brother will have a three degree tilt this way and you both are looking at each other like you're both nuts you're nuts you're nuts amen but you have to realize I believe there's God in my brother and he believes there's God in his brother and we're willing to listen to one another and realize maybe it's not exactly the way I thought maybe there is another way to view this this is the danger of isolation this is danger of leaving Fellowship the other thing that's dangerous is if we only have fellowship with everybody else with a Three Degree tilt then we're all balanced what do you think about me brother I think you're good what do you think about me I think you're good right do we look good yeah you look good I look good we look good you agree with me yeah I agree with you I agree with you we agree I love human nature it's the same across the board it's the same for me it's the same for you it's the same for the new believer it's the same for the one who's believed 50 years it doesn't change we need each other we need the health the strength the support we need the correct vision we need iron to sharpen it iron we need a friend to sharpen the face of his friend the countenance of his friend amen we need somebody to help us wash the dirt off of our feet we need somebody that will bear with us in our mistakes we need somebody that we can go to and confess our faults one to another we need to S we need somebody that we can say listen brother pray with me I'm struggling to overcome this I'm having a hard time with this and we need somebody that's willing to Humble themselves get on their knees and start washing that dirt off of us start pouring love and the word on to on top of us and say encourage them in the word and say the scripture says this and brother B said that and I'm going to stand with you whether two or three agree touching anything God will hear from heaven and brother we're going to agree together on this and what are you doing you're washing that dirt off of them and you're helping bear one another's burdens this is what we need we need a body we need Fellowship we need to do what God called us to do because we need it another fallacy and pride is when we come to church because everybody else at church needs me I mean not even the pastor can take that approach not the ministry we're not here because everybody in the church needs me If I Die Tomorrow God will put another pastor and it'll move on just as good as it's ever moved or maybe better we don't we all need to come cuz we need to come we need the local body not because they need my gift I got to go they need me I need to be a contributor yes we do need you but come let's come humble brothers let's let's come together and say I'm going to church cuz I need to go to church I'm going for Fellowship cuz I need the fellowship it's amazing how many times I talk to people and all they ever do is saving everybody else they're saving the world I'm doing this because they need it and I saw there was a need here and I saw that's wonderful get involved under need but have you ever realized that you have a need I need encouragement I need my vision set straight I need to be sharpened I need to hear the word I need somebody to challenge my ideas amen praise God and so we need to wash one another's feet and then 1 Corinthians 11 33 says wherefore my brethren this is communion the Lord's Supper wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another this is an interesting quote where brother Brenham references this and it's in the message ordination in 1962 he says we believe that when we come together he said Terry one for another in other words wait on one another the word Terry means to wait wait on one another now as has been accustomed to us we take the scripture in this way way that when we do this that was just bow our heads and the congregation prays for we pastors we pastors pray for our congregation that's how we wait on each other by serving each other by praying you pray God listen to this prayer God you forgive my pastor if there's anything in his life that they have done you forgive them for it forgive them they didn't mean to do it and we come right back to Pastor's pray for our congregation God this is the little flock that you give us to watch over if there's anything wrong in their life take it away father so we can all Stand Together around Fellowship around knowing that we're coming here keeping the order of God and taking communion I think it's a sweet time of Fellowship right when we come together and brother M is referring specifically to the Lord's Supper to the time of communion and we t one for another another we pray for one another that doesn't mean you can only pray for the pastor Pastor well I'm not going to pray for myself so I'll pray for the whole congregation we pray for one another we hope asking God to wash one another forgive one another Overlook their sins Lord bring them out of that help them through their trial but I love the way he says this is the time the congregation prays for the pastor and the pastor prays for the congregation also because the pastor needs prayer amen he needs encouragement he needs correction he needs Clear Vision it's a symbiotic relationship and you pray for the pastor because everybody in the congregation needs the pastor and the pastor needs everybody in the congregation right we need one another we need it's not just God he's broke you fix him it's God I need that gift to operate for me because you've you've given five Ministry offices by which you Christ will minister to me amen and one of them is the pastor and the pastor over the local church and I need that Pastor and for my soul I need that Pastor and God would if he's done wrong forgive him correct him help him strengthen him encourage him because I need that gift and he's just a man and he's liable to make mistakes he's liable to get the wrong idea and God I'm asking you to help him amen not just because I know he's messed up and he needs me and I'm going to pray for him no that's that's pride humility will come down and say God would you please help him he's just a human being there's a potential that he could have done wrong or said wrong would you overlook it will you forgive him will you help him repent and would you encourage him and would you strengthen him and would you give him greater Revelation he's ever had before because I need that gift for my soul because we have to have one another that's why for me I I personally I don't believe this is a personal thing so please don't make a Doctrine out of it I don't believe it's a healthy thing when a pastor does not need the ties of the congregation to live when he's independently wealthy and he works for his own wages I don't think that's healthy amen because in the reality in the natural the shepherd lives from the Sheep the wool makes his clothes they have food for meat uh the milk uh for for food and the meat for food he lives off the Sheep but the Sheep Survive by the shepherd there must be a need both ways and whenever one doesn't need the other we're setting ourselves up for a very dangerous situation if the shepherd doesn't need the Sheep dangerous if the Sheep don't need the shepherd dangerous so we have to have the right attitude and say we have to have each other I need you and you need me we need each other we need every office Amen to be filled with with a holy ghost filled man and we need to pray for them we need our Sunday school teachers we song leaders our musicians we need everybody and everybody needs one another amen we're not we never come to a place where I don't need that anymore we got to have each other in every gift and operation and everybody contributing one way or another amen and so we need to pray but we need to pray the right way we need to pray with humility and with love and in unity amen amen and I would really appreciate the prayers it would do me a world of good amen in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 21 Ephesians 5:21 says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God Amen submitting yourselves one to another you know when we come into fellowship and a body of Believers there's actually a submission to one another that takes place because we don't all have the same personalities we don't all view things the same way we don't all react in situations the same way and because of that there will always always always be differences always you know one of the most complicated things for me as a pastor I'm giving you secret Insight is when two people come with a solution for the same problem and they have two opposite ideas of what we should do to correct the problem and I believe with all my heart both of them are Spirit-filled baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with the Holy Ghost genuine believers who love the word and know the messag and they both believe they've heard from God yes and they both believe they have the Holy Ghost I'm like God what kind of trap is this it's not like you can say well he's not a Believer no they're equally Believers in my eyes equally I believe they have the Holy Ghost and are led by the spirit of God and they come to me this is a problem this is a problem what do you think what do you think I think we should do this the other one says complete opposite and I'm saying that will always be where you have people that's why brother BR said God never sends two Major Prophets on Earth at the same time because they would have disagreement Major Prophets would have disagreement you mean two Major Prophets could have disagreement yes because there's still a human element those m one of those Major Prophets didn't have the Holy Ghost it's always going to be there friends it will always be there that's why we must submit ourselves one to another and humble our ourselves with one another because it's not always going to be according to our thinking it's not always going to be right and sometimes decisions will be made that we're in disagreement with but we must humble and submit ourselves because there's no way to have a body of Believers in unity of faith without submission to one another there's no way it's not possible because I there's no way if God could not get two Major Prophets to agree on everything he's never going to get amen 200 or 300 Believers to agree on everything do agree on that no maybe one of you disagree but you understand we must submit ourselves one to another we must be willing to listen we must be willing to consider we must be willing to to think outside of ourselves and listen to another brother and consider what our sister and consider what they have to say and and realize the validity of it and go back to the word and then amen we make our decisions based off that and if it's not our decision to make we still submit because as long as it's not contrary to the the word what are we going to do disfellowship over a disagreement of administration no we have to submit one to another there's a going in family there's a ton of submitting to one another and it may not be in your family but it is in my family we have a lot of submitting to one another because there's many times we're dead set against this idea or that idea and one person thinks this is great the person think that's the craziest thing I've ever heard in my life and there's a lot of submitting one to another amen because we don't all agree even though we share the same genetic gene pool mostly we still do not agree so we must be willing to submit to one another and we must be willing to be honest with ourselves and say is that the word or is that my opinion of the word you go right cuz many times so many things got fought over and splits happened and it came down to a matter of opinion amen it wasn't either one was off the word yeah and either decision wouldn't have been off the word yeah but we all have different makeups different backgrounds we come through different things and we all view the word through our glasses and so we must submit ourselves to one another and I don't mean just rolling over and letting things go off the word I'm not talking about that I hope you understand that the word is the word and the word Supreme and trumps everything else everything else our ideas our preferences our Traditions everything is trumped by the word of God so brother brandom said in total Deliverance he said well look what he does for us in the in the condition that we're in what would he do if we were in one heart and one Accord and the only way we can do that is unify our hearts together with Brotherly Love obey the offices of the church and the pastor and the pastor obey God then God works through the pastor through the board down into the church and all together one unit to the kingdom of God then God will hear when we have a unified group let nothing bother you don't be dismayed in anything I say praise God I want to be one unified group I want God to always hear our prayer I want to always have an atmosphere where God is welcome and you know uh there's been times we look over the last two years and by the grace of God God has brought into the assembly by his own doing brand new Believers people have never heard the message before and he's brought them here and and they you know what they need they need to come to the word they need to have a new birth amen they need to come all the way in and I said God help us to keep the atmosphere right so births can take place because we can change the Atmosphere by the way we deal with one another other by our Harmony and our unity and and you could by by by having strife and contention and disfellowship and murmurings and complainings you could kill a brand new believer before it hatches out of the egg I said God help us never to do that amen there's more at stake than just what I want there's more at stake than just myself amen there's our young people need to be born again our children are getting older we need an atmosphere Among Us that the atmosphere is conducive to a birth and say God help me never to do anything anything that would hinder your spirit that anything that would bring contention or Strife or disunity or disal God stop me in my tracks if I'm going to do anything to change that atmosphere and make this a place where you can no longer entrust us with brand new babes right if God's going to send brand new babies along then we've got a tremendous responsibility as a people to keep the atmosphere right stay focused on the word stay in unity and Harmony and love one for another and bring that nurturing atmosphere until there's another birth into the kingdom of God and we have that responsibility and we fail on that God's not going to send anybody else why would God send one of his children to an atmosphere that's not right amen it's bigger than us it's more about us as than than just us as an individual brother Brandon you know I'm not going to read the whole thing but you know in the beginning of Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother brandom he he he gives an encouragement to the church and a warning that you're one sweet loving group but Satan won't let it stay that way why is Satan against one sweet loving group because there's so much that's accomplished when you're in Harmony and unity and love with one another and he will try every which way possible to disrupt that and brother B said when he does when he comes in by whatever message method he comes in you draw that much closer to together if you see it happening don't Clan among yourselves don't start talking he said you just buckle up the Army you pull the Buckle CCH it tighter love one another and at the end of this or there's there's two things that I want to pull out of this he says now uh I'm going to start in paragraph 84 now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourselves in the Church of God how we come to how we got to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to praying amen amen take that to heart because that goes for all of us then further down when he comes to the bottom of this he said you just wax that much closer together take the Buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night about having the Buckle seed in the vision the buckles on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you it's so simple it's shocking amen what do I need to get the blessings of God and what do we need to receive the blessings of God at church draw up closer together talk nice about each other say nice things about one another and then God will bless you what is going to start cutting the blessings of God off as we start disfellowshipping or com into disunity I say God help us to resist that because we know that's what the devil will try to do in every home church amen he'll try to do it in every family in every home not just a home church every home will have to fight this off and every home church will have to fight this off and the bride body as a whole we have to fight this off cuz that's what he's trying to do is divide amen but brother BR said there's a blessing in not allowing yourself to be divided am let's go to John 13 now John 13 and we're going to read verse 33 Jesus says little children yet a little while and I'm with you you shall seek me and as I said unto the Jews whether I go you cannot come so now I say to you a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another amen I want everyone to know that I'm his disciple do you want the same what was going to be the display it was going to be the way we love one another that's going to be the display to the world so many other displays we want but the simplest is just that we love one another amen let's keep the simple thing simple amen 1 Corinthians chapter 12 First Corinthians chapter 12 and we're going to read verse 25 and 26 that there be no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one members suffer all members suffer with it or one member be honored all members Rejoice with it now you are the body of Christ and members in particular we are individual members that's true but we are part of a body and it's just all of my members cease to survive when I separate them from my body the same thing's true for you and I we Thrive by the connection to the body we're made to be part of a body we're on this Earth to be in the body of Christ we're members individually absolutely we must retain a certain amount of individuality but that doesn't mean we separate from the body brother M said and who is this mzc he said God came down and became flesh and died the death in Christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it for Fellowship God loves Fellowship why is it we love Fellowship so much I think maybe because we have God inside amen because God loves and if God loves fellowship and we be children of God and part of God and God dwells inside how can we not but love Fellowship amen God loves Fellowship that's what he made the man at the first time for was for Fellowship God dwells alone with cherubs so what was God even doing when he made man God was seeking Fellowship in Satan's Eden he says and as children of God we are part of God's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have Fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon the Earth and that was God's purpose at the beginning yes sir that's what God wanted at the beginning what did God want he wanted to have he wanted us to have Fellowship as a family of God upon the Earth that's God's Great desire I say let's have Fellowship as a family of God amen amen the local body and the global body but let's have Fellowship as a family of God that's what God wanted that's what God made man for that's what God's great plan has been unfolding let's have Fellowship so if that's what God wants what does the devil want to break Fellowship it's simple it's trying some way to break Fellowship that's right to break unity and Harmony and do by any means that he can to come and break it up so we have to as a body of Believers fight against that as individuals fight against that let's go to Ecclesiastes now together all the way back to Ecclesiastes which is Psalms Proverbs and then Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes verse 4 I want us to take these things to heart as truths out of the Bible Ecclesiastes 4:9 chapter 4 verse n two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if they fall and one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for Heath not another to help him up again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warmed alone and if one Prevail against him two shall withstand him and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken even I mean even this natural understand standing we realize amen that it's best not to be alone in the mighty conqueror the brother B says I said it reminded me of sheep you know when the heat of the day is on the sheep all get together and they stand against another and they make shade for each other and they support each other so that's the way the Sheep of God should do kind of stand together so it places and supports one another with our faith and the All Through the Bible amen we are called go God's sheep in the Old Testament and the New Testament were his sheep is that right am and also when we come to the message of the hour Amen brother brandham calls us Eagles is that true so are you an eagle or are you a sheep yeah amen you know my quizzes the answer is yes yeah amen so so the scriptures all through the scriptures and brother R talks about it we're sheep we're sheep of his pasture he's the great Shepherd and Bishop of our souls he's the Shepherd that leadth his sheep we've got all these scriptures my brother R comes along and shows at the end time age we're under an eagle anointing and our father is Papa eagle and we're the Messiah we're the little eaglets amen that come forth and so there's a certain nature of eagle and there excuse me there's a different nature of Sheep amen and this is where I want to say before uh uh the balance this is where I want to talk about a little bit of balance amen because we never want to lose our individual relationship with Christ never never that is also dangerous amen that is super dangerous I would it's almost as dangerous as not having a church but to have a church and you give everything over to the church and the church is everything and you have no individual Revelation no individual walk no prayer life no leadership from the Lord and you let the church be your leadership in every matter am mean that's a good way to get way off the rails on the other side so there is a balance to everything and Eagles Eagles fly high can see Eagles can move into that prophetic realm Eagles can have Vision Eagles can see Eagles can be independent Eagles can be alone and brother Bram says have you ever seen how how independent an eagle walks he's not tied to nothing and brother man' he starts to describe it like this he says won't you come out here he says shut your mouth I love the way he does it when he's showing as a Believer there must be an independence amen where we can serve God as an individual that I can't only serve God when I'm with other believers but there's something in me connect I have an individual connection to Jesus Christ that's that's independent from anybody else's I have an individual Revelation from the father that's independent of anybody else's amen I have this relationship that's fostered between me and him he's got a way of leading me he's got a way of showing me his way he's got a way of correcting me amen and that is between me in him and that must always be first that must always be foremost that must always stay intact but there's always a duplicity inside of us because you're the sinless Spotless virgin bride of Jesus Christ by the new birth you've been washed from all the sins amen your faith in the word has brought you back to your ought to be condition but you always have a sticky cber nature and you'll always be tempted yes so which one is it they're both true so we are eagles we're individuals we need individual leadership we need to be able to hear from God we need to be able to be corrected by God we need to have a revelation from God but that in no way changes God's desire for us to be sheep and part of the body these two things must dwell together simultaneously amen or else we've left the word somewhere we must remain sheep we must remain part of the body we must be subject to the offices of God and to the ways of God but we must also have an individual connection to Jesus Christ and we must also regardless of of what everybody else does I have a connection and I have leadership and I have a way that God leads either one is dangerous if we decide to be Eagles and not sheep we're going to wind up train wrecked somewhere if we decide to be sheep without also being Eagles we're going to be train wrecked somewhere by following some man in some church right off a cliff somewhere but these two things have to come together so when I talk about sheep and I talk about the church don't don't think that in any way we're doing away with the individual amen this is what the devil's howling about is that it's revealed to her alone one individual one person amen that's that's the whole mystery but God wants that one person who's got a revelation from God a connection with God knows the new birth he wants them to subject themselves to a local body and submit one to another and have love for one another and put our efforts together in unity and love the strength of the local church is the individual connections to Christ yeah that's the strength the strength of the the strength of the local church is that everybody's independently connected to Christ amen coming according to the word to work together in unity for the kingdom of God that's what makes a church strong what makes a church weak is when everybody's cut off their individual ability to hear from God and the responsibility to God and they turn all that responsibility over to a pastor and to a church and they just move along like sheep that's dangerous but to say I can do it I hear from God I've got the Holy Ghost I know what's right and I know what's wrong and I can do this independently that's just as wrong why is it the truth is always down the middle amen and you know I love it because there's part of me that thrives on my personal connection to Christ there's part of me there's depths in my soul that nobody can tou touch not even my spouse amen and there's a love relationship that's independent of any other and it's precious to me and I love that that God can speak to me he can whisper to me he can lead me he can come to me I can sense his presence I can talk to him I never want to lose that but you know what there's another part of me that absolutely thrives on Fellowship that needs encouragement that needs support that needs the correction that comes from the body I thrive on both and both make me alive I don't want to do without either brother Bram said it this way in the Good Shepherd of the sheep he says sheep are funny little creatures in one way here's another thing we might learn of sheep tonight when the weather is really hot did you ever see sheep they won't separate themselves and one be at one place and one at the other but Right In the Heat of the day the Sheep will all stand together you know what they're doing they're making shade one for the other they're having Fellowship what does Fellowship do it makes shade for one we're helping each other and protecting each other from the scorching rays of the Sun from the heat of Trials amen and you know that's the truth when we're going through a trial just the fellowship takes the pressure off just somebody to understand somebody to love you and pray with you and talk with you about it and and somebody to care about all of a sudden starts to take the intensity away from The Trial amen said he said' and wouldn't it be good if um if all God's sheep when the heat was on would stand together when the trials are real hard and the heat is on and everything going on everywhere if all of God's Little Sheep would just stand together we'd have the coolness of the shade of each other the Comfort to lean upon each other now someone said is that necessary brother brandom it certainly is now listen I'm not doing away with individuality but the prophet said this is necessary amen and he goes on he says he said it certainly is and then the next statement is this there's nothing like having a real good Dependable friend that when the troubles are blazing the heat is on you can go to this friend and sit down and just explain it to them talk talk it over in a personal confidence and then kneel down and pray together and know that this person is a God is a good God saved man or woman that you can put confidence in oh it's good to do that come let us reason together say the scriptures come let us stand together and I notice another thing when I see sheep in cold country and when all the Sheep the blizzard comes to break the wind all those little sheep will come from one side of the field to the other huddle up together and keeps each other warm the warmth from each body helps warm the other and I think when the church gets real cold and indifferent God's sheep ought to kind of huddle up together and pray for each other and then the warmth of real good Christian Fellowship oh it means so much much brother Simon Abbott you know he's a sheep farmer he was telling me they had a storm blowing one day and they went out to find the sheep and they found all the Sheep huddled together with their backsides towards the wind and the older sheep were out front and on the outside and the younger sheep on the inside and they they were absolutely stopping the effect of the storm and the wind for those Little Sheep amen and we know that bees in the winter will cluster together and they're swarm and they'll keep each other warm amen but there's some bees that are on the outside that are cold and they're making heat for those inside but they'll rotate after a while they just keep moving amen what are they doing they're all creating a warm atmosphere for each other not one of them bees could survive independent of the hive The Hive couldn't survive without all the bees there's always a symbiotic relationship that's how God keeps everything in equity he keeps everything in Balance because he always has amen there's always a need that has to be met by one of God's children that keeps us in Balance the fivefold ministry needs each other all the gifts need each other amen a pastor in a congregation need each other amen this symbiotic relationship and God keeps everything in equity and when you take that away you've unbalance the program of God you've ruined God's equity and now you're independent isolated on your own and don't need nobody I was reading a book that another pastor friend gave me on a Shepherd a Shepherd was wrote this book he was a Christian man and he just insights into watching sheep all those years and he would say every year they would have to take the sheep and Shear the sheep and it was kind of traumatic for the Sheep they would get crowed together you would wash them and dip them and and Shear them and there's a bunch of noise and and it was not too easy and and and when they knew this time was coming they would try to get away he said every once in a while you get a rogue sheep usually a male and he would go off and be independent he wouldn't come in for shearing time and he would go Rogue and he would go out there and he would start wondering and he would live in isolation and somehow he would avoid the Wolves and the Cougars and all of that and this he tells the story of one that he saw year after year when it comes shearing time amen he would go gather the sheep and and then this one he would make an appearance every once in a while he would see him and he would call to him he wouldn't come they would try to chase him down he ran away right and that sheep if I could just enter the mind of a sheep yeah which I don't know that I have this right but didn't want to be sheared didn't want to be subject to the shepherd didn't want to go along with all the other sheep yes maybe he had a painful experience in a shearing one time maybe he got frightened as a little lamb I don't know why but for some reason he didn't want to go along with the other sheep under the call of the shepherd for shearing time and he went off by himself and when he was off in isolation he probably thought he was doing okay cuz he survived the wolf and he lived from year to year he found his own gr grass to eat his own and he was he was making it yeah he was living who can argue with him but the problem that year after year his wool was getting thicker and thicker and thicker and it was getting full of sticks and Burrs and mud was drying and caking and it was getting heavier and heavier and heavier and was becoming more debilitated week by week but he thought he was fine cuz he could find some grass and he could avoid the wolf and he finally got so much wool that I don't think a wolf could bite through finally he got to where he couldn't run away from the shepherd and the shepherd caught him and he and he took him and he sheared him and when they weighed that fleece I don't remember what the weight was so you have to forgive me but that little sheep was carrying an incredible amount of weight an unbelievable amount I think it was more than his body weight and all because he was avoiding the Fellowship of the sheep and the shepherd whatever for whatever reason he didn't want sheared for whatever reason he wanted to go off with his own and though it looks okay for a while it's not okay because God made sheep to need a shepherd and he made a Shepherd to need sheep we and the Sheep need each other we're never going to escape this principle in God we need it we need it and so he may have been strong he may have been determined obviously he was he fought off whatever dangers were out there he must have had a strong Constitution as a sheep but in the end he would have died without the inter intervention of the shepherd we have to realize that God knows what he's doing and what he has set up is right his program is correct and he's asking us just to submit to it and if we submit to it there's a blessing and there's protection amen amen so we have to stay independent in one side and we have to remain dependent on the other side brother B said we know this really well he said if the spirit of God is in me that is the spirit of Christ then I'll I'll make my conduct like him make any Christian like him on top of that is he has given us a spiritual gift or his presence near then he will be just like he was then he could go right straight see he has no lips on Earth but mine ours no hands but ours our eyes he speaks through us he looks through us and he sees through US am now you see why you need the body Jesus said to his disciples look unto the Harvest it is white unto Harvest pray the Lord of the Harvest that he'll send laborers into the Harvest brother said he was the lord of the Harvest he could see but he's asking his disciples to use their eyes you see the need look into the Harvest you see the need and then you ask me to send laborers into the Harvest this is where brother Bon God put yeah God put himself in partnership with man he does nothing unless he does it through man and God is working through his body and if you want the full benefit of the life of Jesus Christ then you need the benefit of his body you may be a member but you're this amen and you need the rest of this to help this survive amen amen Ephesians 5:30 I'll just quote it to you says for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones that means I want all of Christ that means I must want you to I can't disfellowship you and brother B says this and the Mighty God unveil before us said this is the the story of the little boy you know it really well storms going on he calls up mama and she tries to encourage him she says now you must bear this in mind we go to church constantly we read the Bible we pray we are a Christian family we believe in God we believe that the storm whatever goes on God is our protection do you know what she was imploring him his individual Faith you're a Christian we go to church you know God protected you're okay you're fine up here in the bedroom by yourself don't worry about it you've got faith and then the little boy says mama I believe every bit of that but said when the lightning is so close that I want a god with skin on it and brother V said I think not only Junior but all of us feel that way when we get together when we pray one for another god with skin on it oh that mother was logical that mother was right she was saying Sunny you're perfectly safe in your bed nothing's going to harm you amen We Know listen we could take up the same language we know that nothing has happened in the life of a Believer unless it first cross God's desk and he signed off the clock's ticking right on time you're perfectly fine you're perfectly safe there's nothing to worry about God loves you we're Believers we believe in the Bible we're Christians and you just go over there and tend to that yourself you're fine but no he said I want to I know I believe it it's all true but I when the Lightning's flashing that close I just want a god with skin on it and brother brandom didn't say oh he should have listened to his mother he said no not just Junior but all of us are that way we need one another and we need comfort we need encouragement we need correction we need direction we need one another and I thank God that we have one another I so thank God that I'm not a Believer stuck on the back side of the desert somewhere with no Fellowship I'm not at a place where my pastor died in the church this fellowship and I'm stuck in a place there's people like that amen who would love to sit in our seat and have what we have I don't want to take it for granted I want to say God you've been so good to me you've been above and beyond amen every prayer request there's a need amen everybody that goes to the hospital amen the Believers gather around they send cars they send meals they show love pray praise be to God that we're here and not just we're here I want to be one of those that contribute to this great move of God Amen Jesus told his disciples he said I not just pray he's praying to God he said I don't just pray for them but I pr pray for them that will believe through their word so now all of a sudden God's going to come through them and then he tells them in Mark 16 go you and the world Amen preaching the gospel baptizing those that believe and these signs shall follow them that believe they shall cast out Devils they should speak with new tongues they should uh uh uh pick up serpents and not harm them they should lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that scripture still good today amen and sometimes what we need is a brother or sister with God on the inside god with skin on it I need God's hands Amen to fulfill that scripture to boost my faith so that I can claim my promise amen where are God's hands they're in the body he has no hands but my hands no feet no mouth no eyes but my eyes amen I'm here to see the need to be an agent an ambassador an agent for Christ to see the need and implore God for my brother's need because he said look on the Harvest look on the needed and pray I have his eyes amen what am I going to do with his eyes when I see that there's a need then I'm going to use his mouth and ask for the promise to be fulfilled in my brother and sister because that's his body working I'm going to lay my hands which are Christ hands on the believer to Quicken the faith that's inside of them to believe the promise amen amen it's the body of Christ you know we pray I I've I can say I pray I say Pro so many times God I don't know what to do sometimes you feel like job I don't know where he's at I know he's near I look behind and he's not there to the right I can see where he's been working but he's not there to the I don't know where he's at but listen this is a different day than that day he said oh if I could go to his house and knock on his door but that was a different day than this day now I know where he lives I know where his door is I know the body that he's in I know who is Flesh and Bones of him and I can go amen and be in the presence of God we seek the presence of God and seek the presence of God and we're surrounded by the presence of God and he's the Mighty God unveiled before us but the presence of God goes unrecognized he's in his body he's here in our midst he's ministering through these hands through these mouth through these eyes he's ministering back and forth one another he's giving love he's giving Fellowship he's giving correction he's giving Aid he's giving all kinds where is he he's Among Us don't let don't let the Pres of God go unrecognized we call out for his presence and call out for a solution and call out for a miracle and the body is all around fulfilling that cry and we miss it all the time we cry for God to speak and then we're talking to somebody in the fourer and God comes right down through a brother and gives us the exact answer to our question why cuz that's his body how else do you expect him to answer amen yes it comes through the preaching it comes through the song it comes through the fellowship amen have a need and somebody just comes and calls or texts and says I just wanted to encourage you today you were on my mind am you could say well I just think brother so and so is a super Spirit no that was Christ using his body to let you know he knows where you're at and it's okay amen sometimes we just got to open our eyes to the blessing that we're we're standing right in the middle of a tremendous blessing we just need to open our eyes and be thankful for what given us and soak up everything we can out of the very place that God has placed us amen realize we realize we're not perfect people and this isn't a perfect Church there's not one that exists there'll always be rubs there will always be something that I wish we did a little different I always wish we maybe we had this in a different way or I wish that brother would just shut up or you know we're people there's always something amen amen so we don't look for Perfection because if you do you're going to be on the hunt the rest of your life what we're looking is for a body of Believers that I can come to according to the word of God and get all the benefits that are there for me and be a blessing as much as I possibly can because this is God's provided way for this age what's his provided way through his bride body and I want to have my eyes open to it and I want to be grateful for it and I want to support it and love it and do all that I can I want to be a mouth he can use for my brother I want to be hands that he can use for my sister I I want to have eyes to see the need of my brother and sister and I want to be be able to exercise my faith in the word of God and I want to intercede for a brother or sister because this is his eyes amen sometimes you see something that nobody else sees God gives you special relationship special Insight or maybe you've gone through that before and you can recognize a struggle like nobody else can and you see something nobody else sees well praise God you he has no eyes but your eyes now you can intercede like nobody else can intered you can pray like nobody else can pray for that need and you can encourage like nobody else use Christ's eyes for Christ body use Christ's hands for Christ's body let's do the work of God brother M said oh my goodness he says now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book this book the title deed of all creation the marriage certificate it's got all kinds of names the Lamb's Book of Life he comes forth to get the book and all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him amen what are the Believers this day they are the words in the book amen amen not Black Ink on paper but now Living Word living Oracles of God they are the mystery that was in that book now is alive standing on Earth it's not just words on print it's the logos now has come down the very thought of God is being expressed and the word made manifest I mean the thought expressed is the word now this bride has become the Living Word made flesh what was in mystery is now in flesh upon the Earth and it is God in the formation of his bride all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into his body his church the bride where will we find him he's in our midst he's in me that's true he has to be in me I can't catch it like I catch the flow flu just by coming into association with those I must still have a personal experience I must still have an individual portion of God I must still have the baptism of none of that takes away from all of that but me by myself is just a little drop Amen in the ocean but I want to come together where there's a great big flood of God working together and I want more than just what I have on my own I want all the body of Christ and I think if we come with the right attitude we get the huge benefit of being part of that body amen and we get the tremendous benefit and protection of a local church just by being subject and spoken words The Original Seed he starts he he tells three stories in a row to emphasize a point the first story is Phillip when Phillip is in a a Revival meeting and that Revival meeting is taking place in Samaria and God an angel comes and speaks to him and calls him away and sends him into the desert Amen to to speak to one eth iian unic and God called him away and he went down there and he he draws alongside the spirit tells him to draw alongside the Chariot where the Ethiopian unic is going along and he hears him reading out of Isaiah and he says do thou understandest what thou readest and the Ethiopian unic says one of the wisest things I've ever read in the Bible from an unconverted person he says how can I let some man Teach me this unic knew that if I'm ever going to understand that God's going to use a vessel right am and he wasn't ashamed he wasn't one who had to get private Revelation on everything and knew what nobody else knew and I've got it nobody else had he wasn't like that he said I'm never going to understand this unless some man tell me and Philip beginning at that scripture preached unto him Christ and now brother benam said if the angel could direct Phillip why couldn't the angel just go to the unic he says because the seed wasn't The Germ was not in the Angel The Germ was in the body The Germ of life was in the body of Christ which was on the earth which was in flesh which was in Phillip and life had to come to life germ to germ and it had to come through the body that unic needed the body he needed Phillip he was not going to he said I just want God I want God to give it to me if he wanted God to give it to it he needed to recognize the presence of God when the presence of God came in Phillip that was the answer to his prayer that was the need that he had God was meeting his need through Phillip we know it wasn't Phillip it was the spirit of God in Phillip but without Phillip that's the vessel that carried it there and it was the presence of God unrecognized well actually that time it was recognized and he heard what philli said and he believed and he said here is water what does hinder me to be baptized why because he received the germ through the body and he wasn't puffed up proud arrogant he was willing to submit to God's provided way the next one is Peter right and he comes to Peter and an angel comes to Cornelius a gentile who's trying his best to serve the Lord and the angel speaks to Cornelius in a dream and the angel says unto him go into a city called J japa to uh uh Simon the Tanner and ask for Simon Peter he'll come and teach you what you need to know and brother Braham said the angel was standing there talking to to to Cornelius why couldn't the angel tell him what he needed to know because life didn't come through the angel life comes through the body because after p cost Christ is in his body on Earth the many membered body so brother so meticulously goes through this and spoken word is the Original Seed and then he comes to me this is the most amazing of them all he comes now to the Apostle Paul when he was Saul Saul on the road to Damascus amen he meets a pillar of fire the pillar of fire says Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and Saul says Lord who are you he said I'm Jesus whom you persecute so Paul is speaking to Jesus amen how many of you want Jesus to do something for you you want want Jesus to tell you what to do you want to hear from Jesus amen Jesus was talking to Saul he interrupted Saul and he says Lord what must I do he said go into the City and I'll send a man that will tell you what you need to do why didn't Jesus tell him cuz he had to work through his body he had changed dispensations and now he was working through his many membered body and that is God's provided way amen and Paul Saul couldn't sit there I mean God knocked him off brother said his high horse knocked him into the dust the Bible says he's knocked to the ground in the dust finally humbled and he didn't say I don't want to hear from one of those wretched Christians you come back and you tell if you want me to do something you come tell me yourself right no if he's going to get it he's going to get it God's provided way praise God how many times do we pray and say Lord just tell me what to do tell me what to do if you'll tell me I do God show me the way God show me what to do I say if you start praying that way start looking around for the body to have the answer how's he going to give you your answer what's he going to do and we know God speaks to us all kinds of ways God can show us signs he can give us dream we're not ruling out any of that but neither rule out the body speaking back don't rule out out philli coming along don't rule out Peter coming along don't rule out ananas coming along to give the words of life don't rule out your prayer being answered during the preaching of the word don't you dare rule that out don't rule it out from fellowship at a believer's house when you're sitting around the table and a brother says I heard this quote the other day have you ever heard this and he starts reading it and all of a sudden something drops in your heart and you're like that's exactly what I was asking the Lord about look for the answer to come through the body don't don't say God you're not speaking you're not speaking maybe you're not recognizing his presence maybe it's the presence of God unrecognized we need each other we need Fellowship we need a local body every Christian needs a home church I didn't say it the prophet said it but I believe it wholeheartedly from looking through the scripture it's absolutely the truth we need encouragement we need strength we need admonition and we still need to maintain our personal walk with the Lord at the same time I'm so thankful God gave us a body of Believers I'm so thankful for the Believers that will gather together I'm so thankful for those who will submit themselves to one another to just show throw their shoulder to the wheel to just support and to love and and to see that things move on in unity and Harmony amen I love that and I thank God for it it's been a huge bless blessing in my life it has changed me yes this Fellowship has changed me it has sharpened my face my countenance this Fellowship that we have God is using to shape my life and I want to say I love you and I thank God for every one of you Amen in order to come together and stay in unity there's personal sacrifice we give up our time we give up our energy we give up our money but it's a pleasure to serve the bride there's a submitting to one another there's a yielding there's giving up our preferences there's giving up our DS there's giving up our ideas there's giving up our time there's giving up our finance there's giving up our homes but I say it's a privilege to give back to Christ what I do for my brother I do for Christ even those who are not bride and not uh predestinated C Gene of God Amen when they come to the white Throne judgment he said because you did this to one of the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me I say if I've got to surrender my preference to keep Harmony if I've got to give up amen I'll do it am I'll do it to serve the body of Christ to have love to have an atmosphere where there can be births where God can speak where there can be anything is possible when we come together in unity brother Bram said look what can happen in the Tower of Babel which was a false Unity you believe that in that false Unity there were sacrifices in every false unity in every Unity there's sacrifices when they come to build the Tower of Babel somebody had to give up their time to work on it somebody had to give up their finances somebody had to rearrange their schedule and they had to work together in unity to get this project done they were unified or something evil yeah but God said now that they've come to this Unity they will do all the desire of their heart that false Unity was so powerful that God had to come down and self and break it up by separating their languages amen if that will work for evil what will it do for good what will it do when we when we say you know what I thank God for a home church I thank God for a global Body of Christ and I'm going to throw my shoulder to the wheel and I'm going to work together and I'm going to hear from my brother and I'm going to give to my brother I'm going to use my eyes for the rest of the body my ears my mouth my hands to serve Christ oh friends I thank God for what we have we are a blessed blessed people I want to end with I just want to quote to you one or two Psalms Psalms 921 it is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord and to sing praises unto thy name oh most high amen you know what it's so easy to see negative that's e easy easy easy but it's a good thing to thank God for all the good says in Psalms 106 oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever amen I just want to take a minute and thank God for a home church thank God for each one of you for your lives that you live for your consecration for your dedication a for your support brother Brenham even said he says he goes encourages me so much that people will drive across the country and come and hear me preach because what's the point of God giving me a message if nobody comes to hear it and the same thing for anybody who's preaching here every every one of the ministers Ministry are so thankful that there's somebody that wants to hear the word and pulls on it makes life so much better I mean we could be just as easily amen starting up a Grassroots church with two or three people and meeting in a in a front room somewhere laboring in the ministry just pushing to try to get the word across but God has allowed us amen all the ministers in this church to come and have a place where the people pull it right out of you and you start flying and saying things it's a privilege to be here friends it's a blessing to be in this Fellowship it's a blessing to be together and I thank God for each one of you I'm so glad that God called me to be a pastor with a group of people who want to be in charge who love the fellowship and will contribute my goodness is the greatest privilege of my life when I think about where I could be planted and what I could be doing cuz I would have the same gifts somewhere else and I'd have the same responsibility but for me I thank God every day and I want to be more thankful than I've ever been because God has brought together a fellowship that supports the work supports the word and wants to keep moving forward I say God you've been good to us you've given us every gift that we could ask for we could we have we have a wonderful facility we have the word you keep opening the word we have Fellowship we have those that are good at everything oh my don't belittle this tremendous gift that God has given to each one of us amen don't miss don't miss the unveiling of God right in our own local assembly I hope it's not the presence of God unrecognized I know for me I've taken things for granted I've gotten discouraged and I've gotten upset and I've said things I shouldn't have said but when you really stop and think about it we got nothing to complain about I got nothing but just joy in my heart and Thanksgiving to God for his love expressed to each one of us we have youth we have singles we have olders we have youngers we have family we amen we've got deacons we've got trustees we've got Ministry gifts we've got s leaders we got music I thank God I'm so thankful for the body of Christ and I'm so thankful for my home church so thankful and I going to say God forgive me for ever ever having a negative thought God forgive me for being critical God forgive me because you have given me so much and if you don't realize what a family we have you just wind up in a family tragedy one time let your House burn down one time or you get diagnosed with a terminal illness or you have to have an emergency surgery and you'll find out real quick that God is good and God works through his body amen I thank God for that say God you have been so good to us brother B said every Christian needs a home church I say thank God he said it because I don't want anything else but what God has given me I'm so thankful for it man God bless you let's Stand Together musicians if you come brother Blake I just think it'd be good if we'd sing that song thanks thanks I give him thanks you know the way life is we're we're all the same everything could be better your house could be better right you could do a better job we could have a little better this and a little it's always that way we don't ever really stop home improvements we don't ever get to the place where say that's just good enough for me everything could be better we as an asembly have many things we can improve in there's many things we could do better there's many things we could grow in that's the reality that's true if we stop growing we're dying we need to constantly be growing and changing and moving and flowing with the lead ERS ship of the Lord I mean there's always an area to work on and there's always something that could be done better always the problem is if we fixate on that yeah we start to say it needs to be better could be better sometimes we just need to look up and say but what about this and this and this and you know what I'm going to ask God to help us to do better but I'm thankful for what we have so thankful I thank God every day for for what he's given us I know that if I wind up in a time of need I know there'll be dozens who would come to my Aid I know if I needed prayer there would be multiple of you that would get on your knees probably instantly when you heard and pray for me we don't know what a treasure that is we're not alone we don't need to be alone amen God has brought us together and we should say thank you God and never stop to be thankful and more than that I don't want to just be thankful I want to be a contributor man sometimes we hang out on the edge don't hang out on the edge the blessings are being fully engaged and I know there's many reasons for that people have been burnt in the past they've had bad Church relationships they've been and horrible things have happened we're not discrediting that horrible rejection horrible amounts of pain have come but that doesn't change the fact that this is God's provided way because you've been hurt in the past and because things haven't gone well for you in the past doesn't mean it's okay just to stay on The Fringe if you stay on the edge you get the edge blessing if you come fully engaged you get the fully engaged blessing amen also you get the fully engaged workload that's just the way it is but it's the blessing it's more blessing to give than to receive it's the symbiotic relationship it's giving and taking and giving in taking I'd encourage you ask God to help you with whatever pain you've had in the past if you find yourself holding back pulling back and not fully engaging say God help me cut away Lord any barrier in my spirit realm any hindrance that's in me in any past pain because God I recognize this is your body on the earth and I want to be fully engaged and I want to have a place where I work together with the Saints for the movement of the Kingdom moving forward every every Christian has to have that kind of place where they throw their shoulder to the wheel and they work for the kingdom of God I say if God's had given us a place let's take full advantage of you know and that's only for the benefit of you you know who will benefit most when you get fully engaged you will not me you will we all benefit from one another but it's the person who throw thems into the plan of God surrenders to the will of God becomes a vibrant part of a local body they're the ones who are going to get the maximum benefit out of that we all benefit but they'll get the maximum benefit I say let's surrender to God's way joyfully amen let's sing that song thanks well thanks thanks I give you thanks for all you've [Music] done I am so blessed my soul is at rest oh Lord I give you thanks and thanks thanks I give you thanks for all youve done I am so blessed my soul is at rest oh Lord I give you thanks and thanks thanks I give
