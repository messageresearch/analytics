[15:38] amen God bless you all this morning
[15:40] certainly good to be here with you if
[15:43] you could take your Bibles and turn with
[15:45] me to Malachi chapter 4.
[15:47] you probably know which scripture I'm
[15:49] going to open up with
[15:51] um just want to say God bless you it's
[15:53] been here good good to be this one here
[15:54] this morning amen I was glad to hear the
[15:57] specials and especially the bonus
[15:59] special from Sister Priscilla that was
[16:00] good it was a dangerous service to visit
[16:03] sister president
[16:05] but but the special blessed us all so
[16:07] thank you for being willing amen I just
[16:11] wanted to remind you that brother
[16:12] Emmanuel will begin journeying home now
[16:15] he's begun his journey now and he'll
[16:17] arrive home late tomorrow night so just
[16:19] keep him and brother Randy in prayer as
[16:21] they travel home he's giving me updates
[16:24] along the way he's done well the Lord's
[16:26] blessed them they've had a lot of
[16:27] services a lot of fellowship and I'm
[16:29] looking forward to getting him back and
[16:31] hearing more about him and then we'll
[16:33] try to get him to take a service after
[16:34] he gets rested up so he can share with
[16:36] us what the Lord's done there in the
[16:39] Congo
[16:40] also wanted to say that we had a
[16:42] wonderful service Friday night with
[16:45] young adults I meet with the that age
[16:48] group the young adults ages 20 and up
[16:50] those that aren't married we meet a
[16:52] couple times a year and the rest of the
[16:54] church may not know that but you're not
[16:56] in that age group so
[16:58] you're not included sorry but no I
[17:01] wanted to let you know that we had
[17:02] questions and answers such and had a
[17:03] wonderful time and and I really
[17:05] appreciate the the young people the
[17:08] young adults that God has placed here in
[17:10] their commitment their desire and their
[17:12] willingness to give all for him it
[17:15] blesses me every time I spend time with
[17:17] really any of the Believers but I had a
[17:19] special time Friday night I want to say
[17:21] how much I appreciated them
[17:23] amen let's let's look into this word and
[17:25] I'll just preface this morning by saying
[17:28] that there's there is a lot that is on
[17:31] my heart and I'm going to take my time
[17:32] this morning so this is a fair warning
[17:35] ahead of time I'm not going to let
[17:37] myself get pushed and rush and and we're
[17:40] just going to take our time and let's
[17:42] begin here in Malachi chapter 4 verse 5.
[17:47] it says behold I will send you Elijah
[17:50] the prophet before the coming of the
[17:51] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[17:53] he shall turn the hearts of the fathers
[17:55] to the children and the Heart of the
[17:57] children to their fathers lest I come
[18:00] and smite the Earth with a curse while
[18:02] we're together let's turn also to
[18:04] Matthew 17.
[18:07] before we're seated
[18:09] go to Matthew 17.
[18:16] maybe 17 and verse 10.
[18:20] and his disciples asked him saying
[18:23] why then sayus describes that Elias must
[18:26] first come and Jesus answered and said
[18:29] unto him Elias truly shall first come
[18:31] and restore all things amen God bless
[18:34] you as you're seated keep your Bibles
[18:37] handy I want to turn to one more
[18:39] scripture let's go to II Peter
[18:44] uh second Peter chapter one
[18:50] second Peter chapter one
[18:55] in verse 12.
[19:00] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[19:03] you always in remembrance of these
[19:04] things though you know them and be
[19:07] established in the present truth
[19:09] so the scriptures we read we've been
[19:11] over many times have you been a Believer
[19:12] for some time and followed the message
[19:14] you know these things but yeah even
[19:17] Peter says he will not be negligent
[19:20] to put you always in remembrance and
[19:22] even though you know them and be
[19:23] established in the present truth amen so
[19:26] there's some things that I'd like to go
[19:28] over again amen and every time we do
[19:30] they go deeper they they get richer
[19:32] there's more color to it more
[19:34] understanding and and they help it grow
[19:35] and I certainly enjoy it all the time
[19:37] amen so the the this uh that I've been
[19:42] meditating on for the last little bit
[19:43] amen it's it's just started unfolding
[19:46] and uh really uh pouring in I could say
[19:49] if I could use that term and start
[19:51] pouring in all day yesterday and last
[19:53] night really pouring in it started
[19:55] Thursday but last night and so I was
[19:58] just grabbing quotes and grabbing
[19:59] scriptures and just throwing them on
[20:00] paper as fast as it came into my mind
[20:02] and my heart and and then I had a
[20:05] terrible time trying to sort it out into
[20:07] some clear thought because I had rambled
[20:09] thoughts everywhere amen and so I've
[20:11] been scrambling uh early this morning
[20:13] trying to make sense of it so if I
[20:15] hesitate And Delay it's just because I'm
[20:17] trying to read pages ahead and find out
[20:19] where in the world I am with all these
[20:21] thoughts but it was really just pouring
[20:23] down and it was like a refreshing to go
[20:25] through these quotes and scriptures for
[20:27] me and it really blessed me and so
[20:30] brother Frank if you could bring up the
[20:31] white board I'm going to use that for a
[20:32] little bit
[20:33] uh this morning as well
[20:35] in
[20:38] in going through this I wanted to start
[20:41] with a title but I'm not going to give
[20:43] you the entire title I'm just going to
[20:44] give you part of the title and we'll
[20:46] fill in the rest later
[20:48] amen so this is going to be like School
[20:50] amen and for the rest of the service
[20:52] everybody's going to be guessing what's
[20:53] the last part of it amen and and I'll
[20:56] tell you it these Revelations are very
[20:59] Dynamic they're not simplistic
[21:01] so so you can put all kinds of things
[21:04] into the style and you'll see what I
[21:05] mean just in a moment so yeah it's up
[21:07] I'm going to go ahead and write this
[21:08] down
[21:10] I'm going to start by writing this
[21:31] now you see what I'm saying
[21:34] you could drop all kinds of things in
[21:36] after this phrase and be correct
[21:39] because the word of God is very Dynamic
[21:42] and it's very expressive and it
[21:43] expresses itself in many ways so at the
[21:45] end I'm just going to give you my
[21:47] thought on it my what what my
[21:49] inspiration was but but please don't
[21:51] ever take that as the end all the only
[21:54] proper way to finish this statement
[21:56] that's not true this is very Dynamic
[21:58] statement and encompasses many many
[22:00] things in many facets to the Revelation
[22:03] but this is what I want to deal with
[22:05] this morning as the bride's Revival and
[22:07] what the bride's Revival is
[22:10] and I'm going to I'm going to read a lot
[22:13] of quotes all right and so listen the
[22:16] quote is just as fresh now as the day it
[22:18] was spoke
[22:19] and just because my head's down reading
[22:21] doesn't mean we shouldn't say Amen when
[22:23] the word strikes us amen and so we we
[22:25] want to keep the word fresh and don't
[22:28] get lost as I'm reading and as I'm
[22:30] reading I may not reference every place
[22:33] that I'm I'm reading from because I have
[22:34] so many quotes that I want to read
[22:35] especially I'll get into one segment
[22:37] I'll just be reading little phrases
[22:39] brother Brown says out of several
[22:40] different messages but my notes are
[22:42] always available online if you go to the
[22:44] website they're always available you can
[22:46] get every reference it's right there and
[22:48] you can go through it but I'm not going
[22:50] to take the time because I I think we're
[22:51] going to have the need for all the time
[22:53] that we have
[22:54] so in the third seal brother Benham says
[22:57] now that's what that's what's the reason
[22:59] today that the revivals that we're
[23:02] supposed to have we have denominational
[23:04] revivals we haven't had a real stirring
[23:07] no no no no no no no sir
[23:10] don't think we got revivals we haven't
[23:12] oh they've got millions and millions and
[23:15] millions of church members but not a
[23:17] Revival nowhere no no the bride hasn't
[23:21] had a Revival yet see there's been no
[23:24] Revival there no manifestation of God to
[23:26] stir the bride yet see we're looking for
[23:29] it it'll take those seven unknown
[23:31] Thunders back there to wake her up again
[23:33] he will send it he promised it
[23:37] so here comes brother Benham in in 1963
[23:41] and he's preaching in the seals he's in
[23:43] the third seal I think it's important to
[23:45] know where we are in the sequence of the
[23:47] ministry and he's in the he's now laying
[23:49] down the seals he's in the week of the
[23:51] uh and the week of March there where
[23:53] he's preaching the seals in March 1963
[23:55] and he's saying they have the bride
[23:59] hasn't had a Revival yet
[24:01] so that means brother branham's been on
[24:04] the scene and he's been ministering
[24:06] since 1930 somewhere along there he
[24:09] begins his ministry he begins his
[24:10] healing campaign going out in 1946
[24:13] commissioned by an Angel to do so and we
[24:15] know that he's he's already displayed
[24:17] the first pull in the second poll but in
[24:19] all of that the healing campaigns the
[24:21] camp meetings the tent meetings and the
[24:24] first and second poll and all of that he
[24:26] says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet
[24:30] it's really important to note
[24:33] he said there's been no Revival there no
[24:36] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[24:38] yet
[24:39] we're looking for it
[24:41] all right so brother remembers looking
[24:43] for it it hasn't happened yet this one
[24:46] that'll stir this bride amen and and
[24:48] it'll stir I I would like to I would
[24:51] like to make this statement not to
[24:52] change what the prophet said but I'm I'm
[24:54] look we're looking at the end time bride
[24:57] because we know every Church age had
[25:00] bride
[25:01] there was bride in every Church age Amen
[25:03] in what stirred amen was stirred in the
[25:07] Lutheran Church age what stirred the
[25:08] bride and revived the bride then it was
[25:10] the true revelation of the word that was
[25:12] restored in that day
[25:14] right same thing in Wesley's day same
[25:17] thing in the Pentecostal Revival it was
[25:19] the true word that was being restored
[25:22] that revived the bride there's been uh
[25:24] there's been bride in every age and
[25:27] every age has been stirred by the
[25:29] portion of the word for that age and
[25:31] it's awakened the bride in that day
[25:33] but I believe what brother man is
[25:34] referring to is the end time bride when
[25:37] it comes to the full manifestation to
[25:38] the culmination
[25:40] all right
[25:42] he says no manifestation of God to stir
[25:44] the bride yet see we're looking for it
[25:45] it will take those seven unknown
[25:48] Thunders back there to wake her up again
[25:51] now he ties The Awakening or the Revival
[25:55] he ties it to the mystery that's in the
[25:59] seven unknown Thunders it'll take the
[26:01] seven unknown Thunders back there to
[26:03] wake her up again
[26:05] and he calls the waking up of the Bride
[26:07] also the Revival of the Bride he ties
[26:09] these terms together so we realize
[26:11] without the revelation of the seven
[26:14] Thunders there is not a bride's Revival
[26:17] or an Awakening of the Bride it's going
[26:20] to take the seven unknown Thunders
[26:23] that's what the prophet said amen I know
[26:25] like I said I know we're rehearsing amen
[26:27] I know we know these things because
[26:28] you're established in this present truth
[26:30] but I will not be negligent to bring
[26:32] this back to your memory
[26:36] and the message recognizing your day and
[26:38] its message Prophet says everywhere now
[26:41] there's no Revival
[26:43] everybody's complaining Minister's
[26:45] crying I was in Reading in one of the
[26:46] outstanding papers that comes here to
[26:49] the church a very fine paper and I know
[26:51] the editor and I know the people and
[26:52] they're godly people very fine brother
[26:54] and sister more of the herald of his
[26:56] coming one of the finest papers on the
[26:58] field Herald of his coming but they
[27:00] hardly will print anything unless it's
[27:02] about fast pray fast pray sound a
[27:05] trumpet how many reads that you know you
[27:07] see it all the time fast pray it's all
[27:09] you hear fast pray we're going to have a
[27:11] great breaking of the day it's a great
[27:13] thing going to happen all of you pray
[27:16] pray pray we're not too late yet
[27:19] why do they do that why do they do that
[27:22] they want a Great Awakening they're
[27:25] crying believing that there will be an
[27:27] Awakening Awakening they're good people
[27:29] why is it what what have they done they
[27:32] have not recognized The Awakening of the
[27:35] Bride
[27:36] this is this message is preached in July
[27:39] of 1964 after more than a year after the
[27:43] opening of the seals when he's there in
[27:45] the third seal in March of 1963 he said
[27:47] there's been no stirring yet there's
[27:48] been no Revival to awaken the bride
[27:50] it'll take those seven unknown Thunders
[27:52] now a little over a year later he's
[27:55] showing the condition of the churches
[27:57] crying for Revival crying for a great
[27:59] stirring crying for an Awakening then he
[28:01] says why are they doing that they're
[28:02] good people amen but what did they do
[28:04] they failed to recognize read again they
[28:07] have not recognized The Awakening of the
[28:10] Bride so somewhere between March of 63
[28:12] and July of 64 what brother Branham said
[28:15] there hasn't been yet to revive the
[28:17] bride awaken abroad now he says it's
[28:19] come
[28:21] somewhere in between there you can
[28:23] decide where it is in between there but
[28:25] it's somewhere in between there you've
[28:27] got about a year and three months to
[28:29] work with
[28:31] praise God
[28:33] see by being Christians they feel the
[28:36] pull of the hour but they haven't
[28:37] recognized what's been done
[28:40] so brother we're gonna say it's already
[28:41] passed
[28:42] that's what's making them feel that way
[28:44] they know something is supposed to
[28:46] happen but see they're looking for it
[28:47] way off in the future to come when it's
[28:50] already happened right by you
[28:52] what brother I'm saying it's already
[28:54] happened right by you it's been all
[28:56] around you know during the seals for the
[28:58] rest says it's happening all around you
[29:02] isn't that what he says during the
[29:03] preaching of the seals he's saying I
[29:05] hope you're getting it I hope you're
[29:07] catching it
[29:09] I mean he says this several times
[29:10] there's several places in the seals I
[29:12] didn't pull them all out but you know
[29:13] they're there amen he's saying I hope he
[29:16] says I hope I don't have to take it
[29:18] right out in my hand and show it to you
[29:20] I hope you're catching what what the
[29:23] spirit's trying to get over without
[29:24] coming right out and saying it you see
[29:26] he makes these statements right and he's
[29:28] saying it then he comes to the end of
[29:30] the seals and he says now you're not
[29:31] getting it you're not supposed to get it
[29:35] praise be the Lord but somebody's
[29:37] supposed to get it
[29:39] and I believe that somebody's me amen I
[29:42] believe in the in the right period of
[29:43] time and the end time in the right
[29:46] position to catch it amen
[29:48] so he said it's already happened right
[29:50] by you it's going on it's happened and
[29:53] you missed it
[29:54] and the message the invisible Union of
[29:56] the bride of Christ he says but but
[29:58] watch
[29:59] when the spiritual bride when she begins
[30:02] to have a Revival
[30:04] when she begins to come back and line
[30:06] herself up with the word of God
[30:08] so now we understand there's an
[30:10] Awakening that comes a stirring and
[30:13] Awakening that comes by the revelation
[30:15] of the seven Thunders amen and and when
[30:18] the bride by that has a Revival what
[30:21] will she do in this revival she'll come
[30:24] back and begin to line herself up with
[30:25] the word
[30:27] it's a Revival back to the word it's a
[30:30] Revival back to being a proper Church to
[30:32] being a virgin bride
[30:35] amen not like what sometimes revivals
[30:39] are called in the nominational world or
[30:41] what they've been called in previous
[30:43] places in previous times amen but
[30:45] brother man is beginning to show us what
[30:47] the Revival is in the bride the bride's
[30:49] Revival is an Awakening amen it's an
[30:52] Awakening that comes it'll take those
[30:54] seven unknown Thunders to wake her up
[30:56] amen then he says it happened because
[30:58] they don't recognize the Awakening of
[31:00] the Bride they don't recognize what's
[31:02] going on all around you
[31:05] amen and that Revival when she begins to
[31:09] have a Revival she begins to come back
[31:12] and line herself up with the word of God
[31:15] watch then again you see how that the
[31:17] scriptures at that time there'll be a
[31:19] message sweep out to catch the bride
[31:21] catch that woman elect
[31:24] amen
[31:27] in modern events May clear by prophecy
[31:29] it says now we want to be posted
[31:32] to know to take place for this age that
[31:35] we live in God has lauded his word to
[31:37] each age
[31:39] so so much to each age and we must
[31:41] notice that one age cannot carry over
[31:43] into another age
[31:45] it just won't work for instance as I've
[31:48] said I believe last night I'm constantly
[31:49] speaking night after night places and
[31:51] sometimes I make a remark the second
[31:53] time I don't mean to repeat myself but I
[31:55] say this
[31:56] uh what good would it have done Moses to
[32:00] try to preach Noah's message
[32:02] or what good would it have done Jesus to
[32:04] try to preach Moses message or what good
[32:06] would have done Martin Luther to
[32:08] continue on with the Catholic message
[32:09] what good would it done Wesley to
[32:11] continue on with the Lutheran message
[32:13] what good would it done Pentecostals to
[32:15] continue on with the Methodist message
[32:17] are what good will it do Pentecost to
[32:20] continue on when the bride's being
[32:22] called
[32:25] amazing brother bear I'm saying one age
[32:28] amen cannot let's see what he says at
[32:31] the beginning here I want to get this
[32:32] right God is allotted his word DHA it's
[32:35] so much to each age we must notice that
[32:36] one age cannot carry over into another
[32:38] age
[32:39] remember brother Branham taught this he
[32:42] taught this uh through the Passover and
[32:45] he showed that in the Passover amen that
[32:48] that that that the lamb that they were
[32:50] given in the Passover every bit of it
[32:53] had to be consumed that night nothing
[32:55] could be carried over and that which was
[32:57] not consumed needed to be burnt by fire
[32:59] because it wasn't to linger to the next
[33:01] day
[33:02] they were to consume it that day then he
[33:04] also showed it in the manna that would
[33:06] fall every night and every morning they
[33:08] could go and gather Manna but they could
[33:10] never keep that Manna over to the next
[33:12] day because if they kept the Mana over
[33:15] to the next day it became stagnant it
[33:17] got it got worms in it it became rotten
[33:20] so then he begins to show amen that the
[33:23] Manna of yesterday that fell which was
[33:25] the word for that age that Manna cannot
[33:28] be carried over into this age amen there
[33:31] must be a Manna for today
[33:34] and you realize that it's the same
[33:37] manner what is manna Heavenly bread
[33:40] so what was Heavenly bread and Luther's
[33:43] day we must receive Heavenly bread
[33:47] so it's not in no way were we rejecting
[33:50] the truth that Luther had by saying we
[33:52] can't know but we can't carry that over
[33:54] we have to get the fresh bread and the
[33:56] fresh bread it contains the truth that
[33:58] Luther had it contains the truth that
[34:00] Wesley had it contains all of that
[34:02] because what was in the previous age is
[34:04] here in this age
[34:07] but we can't carry it over we have to
[34:11] keep receiving it fresh
[34:15] so he begins to tell us this
[34:18] that
[34:19] it cannot carry over into another age
[34:23] and so he says what good Moses preaching
[34:26] Noah's message what good would it be
[34:28] Luther preaching Wesley's or Pentecost
[34:30] preaching or yeah uh Wesley preaching
[34:34] Luther's or Pentecost preaching Wesley's
[34:36] age
[34:36] and what good would it do Pentecost to
[34:39] continue on
[34:40] when the bride's being gone
[34:43] so the Pentecostal Revival that message
[34:46] is not to continue on there's a fresh
[34:49] Manna now
[34:51] and the message works is Faith expressed
[34:53] 1965 said God to the Pentecostal Church
[34:56] of this day
[34:57] the restoration of the gifts May Lord
[35:00] those men maybe some of them present
[35:02] here some of them hearing the tape
[35:04] around the world may they realize that
[35:06] this is the calling out of the Bride not
[35:09] a Pentecostal message
[35:11] the Pentecostal message was to restore
[35:13] the gifts back to the church but this is
[35:16] the calling forth of the Bride another
[35:18] message that has to come just before
[35:21] Sodom has to be burned
[35:23] so Brothers clearly telling us one
[35:25] message cannot carry over into another
[35:27] age and he's telling us this is another
[35:30] age
[35:31] he's very clearly trying to tell us the
[35:34] Pentecostal message is not to carry over
[35:37] into this age the Pentecostal message
[35:39] was the restoration of the gifts and it
[35:41] was just as necessary as Wesley's
[35:44] message was and just as necessary as
[35:46] Luther's message was because there was
[35:49] something the church was lacking that
[35:51] the church had in its original form but
[35:53] now was lacking and it was coming back
[35:55] through the messenger it was delivered
[35:57] back the truth of justification
[35:58] delivered back the truth of
[36:00] sanctification and delivered back the
[36:01] truth that the gifts are supposed to be
[36:03] in the church
[36:05] so brother bam says the Pentecostal I
[36:08] mean again the Pentecostal message was
[36:10] to restore the gifts back in the church
[36:13] that was the message of Pentecost the
[36:15] restoration of the gifts which they
[36:17] called the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[36:19] brother Branham even goes to show that
[36:20] it wasn't actually what they thought it
[36:22] was
[36:24] they thought it was the final outpouring
[36:26] the latter rain the baptism holy ghost
[36:28] that would carrying them to the Rapture
[36:30] but they know they found out it wasn't
[36:32] that it was actually the restoration of
[36:34] the gifts the latter rain could not come
[36:36] until you first had a teaching rain and
[36:38] you could not have the teaching Reign
[36:39] without the prophet messenger
[36:41] and the prophet messenger would teach to
[36:44] restore all the truths that were lost
[36:45] through the seven Church ages tying us
[36:47] back to the Bible back to what the
[36:49] apostles preached back to what Paul laid
[36:51] out and then amen and then after that we
[36:55] would carry over into the Thunders
[36:57] we're going to get to that in a minute
[37:00] so praise be to God this
[37:03] Pentecostal message was to restore the
[37:06] gifts back to the church
[37:08] but this is different than that
[37:13] just as much
[37:16] as
[37:17] the Westland Revival
[37:20] was different than the Lutheran Revival
[37:25] is that true
[37:27] there are some elements that were the
[37:28] same there's some elements that were
[37:30] very different and the Wesleyan Revival
[37:32] was much different than the Pentecostal
[37:34] Revival
[37:36] but the bride's Revival is different yet
[37:40] than the Pentecostal Revival
[37:42] none was a copy of the previous it was
[37:45] something further
[37:47] it was an advancement it was a moving on
[37:49] it was a going higher
[37:52] Wesley's Revival was higher than
[37:54] Luther's Pentecost Revival was higher
[37:56] than Wesley's and the bride's Revival is
[37:58] higher than the Pentecostal Revival and
[38:00] it's not just a replication of the
[38:02] previous Revival this is something
[38:04] different altogether
[38:10] so I want to read this again
[38:13] this is the calling out of the Bride not
[38:15] a Pentecostal message the Pentecostal
[38:16] message was to restore the gifts back to
[38:18] the in the church but this is calling
[38:21] forth of the Bride another message that
[38:23] has to come just before Sodom has to be
[38:26] burned so brother I'm saying this is
[38:28] another message this is another age
[38:32] are we clear
[38:35] 1965 I've heard but now I see and we are
[38:38] not living in Luther's age Wesley age or
[38:41] the Pentecostal age
[38:44] you believe what the prophet says
[38:48] the Pentecostal wage was only a
[38:50] restoration of the gifts coming back in
[38:52] the church but we're living in the
[38:54] evening time we're living in a time of
[38:56] the calling out of the Bride
[38:58] this is this is a different Revival
[39:01] altogether it's it's not a continuation
[39:04] of the Pentecostal Revival neither is a
[39:06] replication of the Pentecostal Revival
[39:07] it's something beyond that
[39:13] amen 1964 the identified Christ of all
[39:16] ages
[39:18] he says now we find out that now we find
[39:20] our Pentecostal Brethren are living in
[39:22] the glare of a Pentecostal age and
[39:25] they're still miss it they're trying to
[39:28] interpret the Pentecostal age when we're
[39:30] plumbed past that
[39:31] we're living on up to the rapturing time
[39:33] for the calling the end time so brother
[39:36] Brown keeps saying this is another time
[39:38] this is another age this is another
[39:40] message
[39:42] amen
[39:45] and modern events May clear by prophecy
[39:48] this is not the day of Pentecost
[39:51] the Pentecostal age is past
[39:53] Pentecost is gone
[39:56] this is Harvest Time
[40:00] oh I just love it amen I love it because
[40:04] that's where I came from amen I was
[40:06] raised up in that hangover the
[40:08] Pentecostal Revival raised the
[40:10] Pentecostal boy generationally had run
[40:12] deep in my family amen from the time of
[40:14] Azusa Street all the way up to my
[40:16] generationally our family was
[40:19] Pentecostal
[40:20] and I remember the stories of my grandpa
[40:23] when he would tell me about the the
[40:25] reality of the Pentecostal Revival where
[40:28] the true bride amen was being called out
[40:30] and they were receiving the gifts and I
[40:32] I would love to hear my grandpa tell the
[40:34] stories because there was a genuineness
[40:36] to it it was still when the Revival was
[40:38] in the it was In the Heat of that
[40:40] Revival
[40:42] but I wasn't born in that time amen I
[40:45] can't go back and replicate my
[40:46] grandfather's days amen because I'm born
[40:48] for a different age I'm born for a
[40:51] different message I'm born for the end
[40:53] time message which is not a Pentecostal
[40:56] message it's plum on beyond the
[40:58] Pentecostal mess
[41:00] so the pentacle so when I hear about my
[41:03] grandpa's stories and and the Miracles
[41:05] and the signs and the things that were
[41:07] done I Marvel in that because that was
[41:09] genuine that was real that was the
[41:12] Revival
[41:14] but I also cannot long to reproduce my
[41:18] grandfather's days because I'm going the
[41:20] wrong direction if I hear his stories
[41:23] and I hear the stories of Azusa Street
[41:24] and how wonderful it was and hear what
[41:26] what what my family talks about amen
[41:29] long ago the miraculous things that
[41:31] happened amen the way the church was
[41:33] clean the way the church was holy I'm
[41:35] telling you the Pentecostal church was
[41:37] clean
[41:38] under the reality of that Revival they
[41:41] were clean they were holy they were
[41:42] godly people
[41:44] I look back on that and I could say oh I
[41:47] wish that it was still like that listen
[41:49] if we're looking back long and it was
[41:51] still like that we're missing something
[41:52] because we're plumbed beyond that now
[41:54] this message is beyond the Pentecostal
[41:57] message
[41:58] we're plumbed past that now we're not
[42:01] looking back saying oh if I could
[42:02] recreate my grandpa's day those were the
[42:04] Glorious Days that's when it was real
[42:06] that's when something was happening amen
[42:08] if we use terms like that we've
[42:10] absolutely missed the reality of where
[42:12] we're standing because where we're
[42:14] standing is an advancement on that it's
[42:16] past that amen it's a higher degree it's
[42:19] a higher calling
[42:23] praise God
[42:26] and there was nothing wrong with it it
[42:27] was beautiful it was perfect it was
[42:29] worthy of Merit it was worthy of honor
[42:31] it was worthy to be disgusting and with
[42:35] Merit and with respect and with
[42:37] admiration
[42:39] because it was a living reality and it
[42:41] was beautiful in its day
[42:44] but we can't live life in a rearview
[42:46] mirror
[42:48] we have to keep moving on with Christ
[42:53] in The Invisible union he says the word
[42:55] that fell on the day of Pentecost will
[42:57] not work this day
[43:00] brother Venom is not talking about the
[43:02] Azusa Street Revival now
[43:04] he's talking about original Pentecost
[43:06] 2000 years ago
[43:08] listen I did not say this the prophet of
[43:12] God said this
[43:13] this is in the invisible Union of the
[43:15] bride of Christ the word that fell on
[43:18] the day of Pentecost will not work this
[43:21] day no sir that was for Pentecost this
[43:24] is for the bride going home of the Bride
[43:27] we got something different the
[43:29] Pentecostals represented that again
[43:31] we're in the bride age
[43:33] amen
[43:35] amen
[43:36] this this quote has so much meaning amen
[43:40] because because though our hearts are
[43:43] turned back to the faith of the Father
[43:44] the original Pentecostal father brother
[43:46] Ben is now telling us the word that fell
[43:48] on the day of Pentecost our hearts are
[43:50] turned back to the faith of fathers but
[43:51] there's another word for this day that's
[43:53] beyond the word that they had for that
[43:55] day
[43:56] and the word that found on that day
[43:58] won't work in this day that was for that
[44:00] day
[44:02] amen
[44:06] because you know on the day of Pentecost
[44:08] amen they they what happened on the day
[44:11] of Pentecost on the day of Pentecost
[44:13] they tear it in Jerusalem until they
[44:14] were undue with power from on high
[44:16] according to the promise of the fathers
[44:18] the promise that Jesus gave them that he
[44:21] would come to them that they would
[44:22] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:24] that they would be endued with power
[44:25] from on high and they would be his
[44:27] Witnesses
[44:29] and
[44:31] and while they waited and tarried when
[44:33] Pentecost was fully come in when the
[44:35] right time came when it was the right
[44:37] season the right time God's appointed
[44:39] time amen then then in came a wind as a
[44:43] a rushing Mighty Wind amen and then they
[44:46] were all filled with the spirit they had
[44:48] cloven tongues of fire them they went
[44:50] out into the street they speak in
[44:51] tongues as the lord gave them utterance
[44:53] and all the people that were gathered
[44:55] from So Many Nations they all heard them
[44:58] in their own language
[45:00] it doesn't mean that they were speaking
[45:02] their language amen the the miracle that
[45:04] happened on the day of Pentecost was not
[45:06] just a spoken tongue but that everyone
[45:08] there could hear with their own language
[45:12] the brother man points that out that
[45:13] that was the that was a marvelous
[45:15] miraculous thing at Pentecost
[45:18] and the people that were Hearing in
[45:20] their own language hadn't even received
[45:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet
[45:26] and then Peter stands up Amen on the day
[45:29] of Pentecost and he begins to preach the
[45:31] inaugural message he begins to lay down
[45:33] the word for that day and he goes back
[45:35] to the Old Testament back to job and he
[45:38] says this isn't what you think but this
[45:39] is the word made manifest before your
[45:41] eyes this day this scripture is
[45:43] fulfilled in your eyes what Joel said
[45:45] this is it
[45:47] then he goes on and starts to tie Jesus
[45:50] Christ to the testimony the Prophecies
[45:51] of David what David had said to the Old
[45:54] Testament and this Jesus whom you
[45:56] crucified God has made both Lord and
[45:58] Christ what's what's he doing he's
[46:00] standing up and he's preaching the word
[46:02] for their day he's preaching modern
[46:04] events made clear by prophecy
[46:09] is that right
[46:11] and that was the word for his day
[46:16] and under that preaching their hearts
[46:19] were convicted and they say men and
[46:21] Brethren what shall we do and he begins
[46:23] to tell them amen repent and be baptized
[46:25] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[46:26] the remission of sins and you shall
[46:28] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[46:30] that day three thousand were added to
[46:32] the church
[46:33] good message
[46:35] what was it modern events made clear by
[46:37] prophecy
[46:39] and It produced
[46:42] but brother Brennan says the word that
[46:44] fell on the day of Pentecost will not
[46:45] work this day
[46:51] no sir that was for Pentecost
[46:56] see Pentecost was the Fulfillment of the
[46:59] promise
[47:00] the promise Christ made the promise of
[47:03] the fathers
[47:05] there's still other prophecies to be
[47:09] fulfilled
[47:11] and our day is the Fulfillment of those
[47:14] other prophecies
[47:21] I'm just going to read this short quote
[47:23] again because it it so brings clarity
[47:26] to me
[47:28] the word that fell on the day of
[47:30] Pentecost will not work this day no sir
[47:32] that was for Pentecost this is for the
[47:34] bride going home of the Bride
[47:36] we got something different the
[47:38] Pentecostals represented that again
[47:40] we're in the bright age
[47:44] so the Pentecostal Revival was rep and
[47:47] the restoration it gives was
[47:48] representing
[47:50] that day again
[47:52] but we've got something different
[47:57] the Feast of trumpets he says the
[47:59] seventh Angel's message under the same
[48:00] trumpet same everything exactly the same
[48:03] seal is to what
[48:05] call the people the bride out of the
[48:08] Pentecostal and World tradition to the
[48:11] genuine atonement
[48:13] the word
[48:14] Christ impersonated in his word here
[48:16] made flesh Among Us
[48:19] like every one of these little sentences
[48:21] I'm giving you is an absolute mouthful
[48:24] we have preached and can preached whole
[48:27] messages on these statements
[48:29] but he's he's telling us that the
[48:32] seventh Angel's message well who's the
[48:34] seventh angel
[48:36] amen the seventh angel was William
[48:38] Branham the seventh angel the seventh
[48:39] messenger the messenger to the laodicean
[48:41] church age to the seventh eight that was
[48:43] him
[48:44] and the seventh Angel's message under
[48:46] the same trumpet everything the same
[48:48] seal is to what what's it supposed to do
[48:51] call the people the bride out of
[48:54] Pentecostal and World tradition it's
[48:56] supposed to call us out of the
[48:58] Pentecostal tradition and all the other
[49:00] world tradition
[49:02] not to stay in it to call us out of it
[49:05] and bring us to what amen bring us to
[49:09] what what will it bring us to to the
[49:12] genuine atonement amen what is the
[49:14] atonement the atonement is what covers
[49:16] for you and makes you right in the sight
[49:18] of God
[49:20] the atonement is what breaks brings you
[49:22] to at one meant Amen to bring you back
[49:25] in reconciliation with God it takes an
[49:28] atonement and now he's bringing us out
[49:30] of the Pentecostal and World Traditions
[49:32] to the genuine atonement
[49:34] the word
[49:37] Christ impersonated in his word here
[49:39] made flesh Among Us
[49:42] if you want the genuine atonement you
[49:44] must get the word for your day
[49:48] message I have heard but now I see
[49:51] into 65.
[49:54] it says and then he promised in the hour
[49:57] of the seventh Angel's message the Seven
[49:59] Seals would be revealed
[50:02] so we got that in the hour of the
[50:05] seventh Angel's message the Seven Seals
[50:06] would be revealed
[50:08] and the mysteries of God would be
[50:10] declared revelation 10.
[50:12] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[50:14] his message not the healing service the
[50:17] message that follows the healing service
[50:21] so now he's telling us
[50:23] in the seventh Angel's message the Seven
[50:25] Seals will be revealed
[50:27] the mysteries of God would be declared
[50:29] which is revelation 10.
[50:32] so the declaring the mysteries of God is
[50:35] Revelations 10
[50:36] verse one to seven we're going to read
[50:38] that shortly
[50:40] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[50:43] so the mysteries of God would be
[50:44] revealed under Revelation 10 when the
[50:48] seventh angel begins to sound his
[50:50] message
[50:52] not the healing service
[50:54] the message that follows the healing
[50:56] service
[50:58] so now brother Benham is becoming very
[51:00] clear that his message to declare the
[51:03] seventh Angel's message was not back
[51:05] under the healing campaigns and not back
[51:08] under the first and second poll we'll go
[51:09] through them quotes that really clarify
[51:11] this but but his message is attached to
[51:15] the Seven Seals and the mysteries of God
[51:17] in Revelations 10 that's his message
[51:22] amen let's let's do this
[51:28] I've got another question I want to
[51:30] write
[51:49] another good question
[51:52] what is the message now this is the same
[51:55] thing this is also very dynamic
[51:57] you can have many answers for this but
[51:59] I'm going to pull out some quotes and
[52:01] show what brother Branham says I mean he
[52:03] says many things we know the message is
[52:05] Christ
[52:06] that's a quote but remember says that
[52:07] the message is Christ
[52:09] but let's look at it in this context
[52:11] what is the message
[52:14] he says now
[52:17] uh this is out of the anointed ones at
[52:19] the end time 1965. notice the very day
[52:23] when this messenger not when he starts
[52:25] on
[52:26] but when he begins to declare his
[52:28] message
[52:29] he's really telling us amen that there
[52:32] was much of his ministry that was
[52:34] foundational for his message
[52:37] I hope that doesn't stumble you but
[52:39] his message is declaring the mystery his
[52:42] message is attached to the seals and his
[52:45] message is attached to revelation 10.
[52:47] that's when he begins to declare his
[52:49] message not under the healing
[52:51] but this not when he starts on
[52:54] that's not what he's declaring his
[52:56] message not when he starts in his
[52:57] ministry but when he begins to declare
[52:59] his message
[53:01] see the first pull healing second pull
[53:05] prophesying third pull the opening of
[53:08] the word the Mysteries revealed
[53:11] no more there is no more higher order to
[53:14] reveal the word than prophets but the
[53:16] only way the prophet can be Vindicated
[53:17] is by the word and remember the third
[53:20] pull was the opening of them Seven Seals
[53:22] to reveal the hidden truth that's been
[53:24] sealed in the word
[53:26] amen what is that that is his message
[53:31] so we could write it this way
[53:34] what is the message
[53:40] let's just say
[53:44] the opening
[53:47] of the word
[53:49] is that right
[53:56] revealing
[54:01] the Mysteries
[54:05] that's when he begins to declare his
[54:07] message
[54:09] not when he starts on but when he
[54:11] declares his message
[54:13] Revelation 10 7 seals I find the seven
[54:16] Thunders
[54:18] so
[54:19] the reason I write this is because it's
[54:20] important to know
[54:22] because we use this term all the time
[54:24] the message I'm in the message or your
[54:26] message believer I'm a message believer
[54:28] you go to a message church is that a
[54:29] message preacher is that a message
[54:30] Pastor is that right
[54:33] and it's not wrong I'm not please don't
[54:35] feel condemned for saying that I say
[54:36] that all the time there's nothing wrong
[54:38] with that but really we need to know
[54:40] what the message is
[54:42] because the if we if if if we oh my
[54:47] goodness if we don't have a clear
[54:49] understanding we'll incorporate things
[54:51] into the message that aren't part of the
[54:52] message
[54:58] we will include things
[55:00] that really is not the message but the
[55:03] message when the seventh angel begins to
[55:05] declare his message that message will be
[55:08] the third pool
[55:10] which is the opening of the word
[55:14] which is the revealing the Mysteries or
[55:17] the Mysteries revealed that is the
[55:20] message
[55:22] now he says the message is Christ well
[55:24] tell me what's different between Christ
[55:25] and the opening of the word
[55:28] what's different between Christ and the
[55:30] Mysteries revealed
[55:31] so it's all synonymous
[55:34] they mean the same thing
[55:36] amen so what is the message so this to
[55:39] me becomes important because if I don't
[55:42] know what the message is then then I
[55:45] begin I begin looking at everything that
[55:48] was previous to the declaring of the
[55:49] message and making that the message
[55:52] so I can make the first pull the message
[55:53] and I can make the second pull the
[55:55] message but brother Brenham said the
[55:56] third pool was the message
[55:59] this is all a precursor these are all
[56:02] things building up or leading into the
[56:03] message there are also things uh let's
[56:05] just say it this way when we get into
[56:07] the three pools it's to me it's so
[56:09] important that we always understand what
[56:11] we're talking about because we use terms
[56:12] and then terms begin to lose their
[56:15] meaning at with the abundance of use
[56:19] so we say third pull but we have to keep
[56:21] in our mind what is the third pool
[56:23] because brother Branham in 1956 begins
[56:26] to tell us that he had a dream right at
[56:27] the beginning of the year right at the
[56:28] end of 55 beginning at 56 or a vision
[56:31] and in in in this he's fishing by water
[56:34] and he's and he's trying to catch fish
[56:36] amen and there's a bunch of other
[56:38] brothers around which were ministers and
[56:40] they were all fishing too amen and they
[56:42] were all he said all these Brethren they
[56:43] were catching all the little fish
[56:46] he says but I could see out in the water
[56:49] and there was big fish in the deep water
[56:53] and the big fish in the deep water he
[56:56] called them rainbow trout
[57:03] everything has meaning
[57:08] in the big fish in the deep water
[57:13] is a rainbow trout
[57:16] not a Cutthroat not not a bass not a
[57:20] catfish nada
[57:23] Muskie not whatever
[57:25] they were they were a specific kind of
[57:27] fish
[57:28] and rainbow we first see Rainbow and
[57:31] Noah's flood and the rainbow is a sign
[57:33] of a covenant that God made with man so
[57:35] these are a rainbow trout these are
[57:37] Covenant fish
[57:39] these are special fish the one species
[57:41] that ties us to the Covenant is right
[57:43] with the word rainbow in it is rainbow
[57:44] trout
[57:46] and so he said they were rainbow trout
[57:48] and he began to think I think I can
[57:50] catch him
[57:51] now he's a minister like the other
[57:53] ministers they're all fishing and
[57:55] they're all catching little fish amen so
[57:58] so uh uh you think it looks successful
[58:03] because I mean they're throwing out lime
[58:05] they're pulling in fish this is a
[58:07] successful Ministry
[58:10] but Brother Bear was looking at that and
[58:11] thinking no I think I could catch these
[58:15] special fish amen this certain fish not
[58:18] what they're catching I can catch the
[58:19] ones in deep water
[58:23] so
[58:25] if he looks down he's got a fishing pole
[58:27] in his hand
[58:28] there's a lure and all the brothers
[58:30] gather around and say oh brother Venom
[58:32] you can do it and you know show us how
[58:34] to do it and all that and he said all
[58:35] these ministers they gather around and
[58:37] and he and he casts it out there amen
[58:40] and he gives it a little jerk
[58:42] and he says that's the first pull when
[58:44] he pulls the fishing pole and pulls the
[58:47] lure now he gets the term first second
[58:49] third pull from this vision
[58:52] it all comes from this Vision so when
[58:55] you want to understand the polls come
[58:56] back to the vision
[59:00] so now when he comes to the first pool
[59:04] says it it attracts the little fish
[59:08] that was the sign in the hand when he
[59:10] takes somebody by the hand he tells us
[59:12] all of this in the message and he would
[59:14] a pattern would break out of his hand
[59:15] and begin to discern what disease they
[59:17] had
[59:18] and then he says on the second pole and
[59:21] now he started saying now now he starts
[59:24] saying let me show you how to do this
[59:25] now I'm a fisherman I can fish so he
[59:27] starts thinking that he knows what to do
[59:29] and how to catch these rainbow trout
[59:31] now remember the target fish is the
[59:33] rainbow trout
[59:35] not the little fish across the bank that
[59:37] any of the other brothers can catch
[59:40] so now in the in in the second pool
[59:45] he goes to pull the lure later he tells
[59:47] us what he should have done and the way
[59:50] the second pull should have worked
[59:52] he says in the second poll he should
[59:54] have gave it another tug and when he
[59:56] gave it the tug it would scare all the
[59:58] little fish away that were attracted by
[1:00:00] the first pool and when all the little
[1:00:01] fish darted it would get the attention
[1:00:04] of those big rainbow trout and their big
[1:00:05] rainbow trout would come up to the lure
[1:00:07] and then he said after it got their
[1:00:09] attention they came near he said the
[1:00:11] third pool would hook them set the hook
[1:00:14] in the fish and bring the fish all the
[1:00:17] way in
[1:00:18] that's the way this was supposed to work
[1:00:20] but in the second pool he pulled too
[1:00:22] hard and when he pulled hard amen The
[1:00:24] Lure of fish and everything a little
[1:00:26] tiny fish had bit The Lure and he said
[1:00:28] it looked like skin over my lure the
[1:00:30] fish was so small how he swallowed he
[1:00:32] said I'll never know he pulled it it all
[1:00:34] come tumbling back on him and now he was
[1:00:36] there with a pile of fishing line all
[1:00:39] around him and the angels the Lord said
[1:00:41] I told you not to do that
[1:00:45] and he says forgive me Lord I'm a stupid
[1:00:47] person
[1:00:48] so he tells us how the three pulls
[1:00:50] should have worked
[1:00:52] and he tells us his error and over
[1:00:54] emphasizing the second pull which was
[1:00:57] discernment when he would tell people
[1:00:58] the thoughts that was in their heart
[1:01:01] right so that means that the first pull
[1:01:05] or the second pool were not catching
[1:01:09] rainbow trouts
[1:01:12] they were getting the rainbow Trout's
[1:01:14] attention
[1:01:17] but the pool that was supposed to catch
[1:01:19] the rainbow trout was the third pole he
[1:01:22] said the third pool that'll get them
[1:01:24] that's what's supposed to catch
[1:01:27] so when we talk about the third pool
[1:01:30] we're talking about the pool that
[1:01:33] catches the rainbow trout
[1:01:35] the elect of God the predestinated seed
[1:01:38] the Covenant fish
[1:01:40] and I made this remark in Romania and I
[1:01:42] think it's amazing
[1:01:44] I I think it's beyond a possible
[1:01:46] consequence
[1:01:48] that God would allow brother Branham in
[1:01:50] his lifetime
[1:01:52] to catch the world record rainbow trout
[1:01:57] do you realize that that this man who
[1:01:59] had this Vision in 1955 that was
[1:02:01] commissioned by God to catch the rainbow
[1:02:03] trout then the division the deep water
[1:02:05] he actually went fishing on on a river
[1:02:07] in Idaho I believe it was Idaho
[1:02:08] somewhere and while he was fishing he
[1:02:10] actually caught at that time the largest
[1:02:14] rainbow trout that had ever been caught
[1:02:16] in the history the known history of the
[1:02:18] world
[1:02:20] you think that's a coincidence there's
[1:02:22] no way that's a coincidence that God is
[1:02:25] just proving again and again and again
[1:02:27] and again that it's this Prophet this
[1:02:29] message he's the one that knows how and
[1:02:32] God demonstrated to the whole world this
[1:02:34] man can catch the big rainbow trout
[1:02:36] they couldn't deny it it went on the
[1:02:38] record books he had it stuffed he hung
[1:02:40] it on his wall there's no denial this
[1:02:42] man knows how to catch rainbow trout
[1:02:46] God made the whole world testify of it
[1:02:52] listen this message is so Supernatural
[1:02:55] but it's so Supernatural and can be yet
[1:02:58] so humble and subtle
[1:03:00] at the same time unbelievable
[1:03:02] unmistakable you got the Fingerprints of
[1:03:05] God all over it
[1:03:06] but yet in such a humble way can slip
[1:03:09] right through the radar
[1:03:11] and go undetected by masses in their
[1:03:14] face but unknown
[1:03:16] on display but unrecognized
[1:03:20] so now
[1:03:21] the third pool
[1:03:24] is the opening of the word the Mysteries
[1:03:27] revealed
[1:03:30] so the third pool was the opening
[1:03:32] listen the third pool was the opening of
[1:03:35] them Seven Seals
[1:03:39] the third pull was the opening of them
[1:03:41] Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth
[1:03:44] that's been sealed in the word
[1:03:47] now what was the third Source pool
[1:03:49] supposed to do it was supposed to catch
[1:03:51] the Covenant fish
[1:03:53] the big rainbow trout in the deep water
[1:03:57] what is going to catch the elect of God
[1:04:01] it is going to be the seals
[1:04:07] the Mysteries revealed
[1:04:10] if you ever want to know why we preach
[1:04:12] on the seal so much and why we hit the
[1:04:14] seventh seal in the third pole and the
[1:04:16] mysteries of God in Revelations 10
[1:04:18] is because we're fishing for rainbow
[1:04:20] trouts and the prophet taught us how to
[1:04:23] do it
[1:04:25] amen
[1:04:29] praise the Lord
[1:04:31] and the message what is the attraction
[1:04:33] on the mountain
[1:04:36] he's referring to at the time he's up in
[1:04:38] Sabino Canyon in January I believe it
[1:04:39] was of 1963 the Lord calls him he's in
[1:04:42] his bed yet and the Lord calls him to go
[1:04:44] out to Sabino Canyon and he takes a
[1:04:45] notebook and he goes
[1:04:48] and he goes up to a rock that has been
[1:04:50] called Pulpit Rock it's a rock that
[1:04:52] looks like a Pulpit it's built on a rock
[1:04:54] Tower right in the middle of the canyon
[1:04:57] and he's there on his knees with his
[1:04:58] hands in the air and something struck
[1:05:01] his hand when he looked it was a sword
[1:05:03] and he says the voice came back and said
[1:05:05] not a king sword but the king's sword
[1:05:10] the word of the Lord
[1:05:13] said fear not it's only the third pool
[1:05:16] it's the Vindication of your ministry so
[1:05:19] now the third pole brother said is the
[1:05:21] opening of them seals the revealing of
[1:05:22] the mystery the third pull is the
[1:05:24] fishing technique that catches the big
[1:05:27] rainbow trout
[1:05:28] the third pull was to hook them and
[1:05:31] bring them in
[1:05:36] it's only the third pool
[1:05:38] he said it's the Vindication of your
[1:05:41] ministry why because his ministry is the
[1:05:44] seventh angel his ministry is those
[1:05:47] Mysteries his ministry is those seals
[1:05:49] his ministry is the Thunders
[1:05:52] that is the message that he has to
[1:05:54] declare
[1:05:56] over on the same page there
[1:05:59] it's
[1:06:01] so what then what was the third pull now
[1:06:06] the king's sword in his hand
[1:06:08] well what did the king's sword represent
[1:06:10] this is what the voice tells him the
[1:06:13] word of the Lord
[1:06:14] now the word of the Lord is in your hand
[1:06:19] to be given out this is the third pool
[1:06:22] it is the Vindication of your ministry
[1:06:27] praise God so now I hope we know what
[1:06:30] the third poll is
[1:06:32] the third pool is the opening of the
[1:06:33] seals the third pull is the word of the
[1:06:36] Lord in the hands of the Prophet the
[1:06:38] third pull is the Mysteries revealed the
[1:06:40] third pull amen it's all of those things
[1:06:43] the opening of the word
[1:06:45] the third pull is Christ
[1:06:48] the third pull is the Mighty God
[1:06:50] unveiled
[1:06:53] praise God
[1:06:55] now we go down to Christ as the mystery
[1:06:58] of God revealed he says God's great
[1:06:59] mystery of how it's a secret he kept it
[1:07:02] a secret nobody nobody know nothing
[1:07:04] about it even the angels didn't
[1:07:06] understand it see he didn't reveal it
[1:07:07] that's the reason under our seventh
[1:07:09] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[1:07:11] there was silence
[1:07:13] so this is so important
[1:07:16] he says
[1:07:19] God's great mystery how it's a secret so
[1:07:22] he's talking about a great mystery
[1:07:25] he kept it a secret nobody know nothing
[1:07:27] about it even the angels didn't
[1:07:28] understand it
[1:07:29] so what is the great mystery that even
[1:07:31] the angels don't understand he didn't
[1:07:34] reveal it that's the reason under our
[1:07:36] seventh mystery when the seventh seal
[1:07:38] was open there was silence Jesus when he
[1:07:41] was on Earth they wanted to know when he
[1:07:42] would come
[1:07:43] he said it's not even the son himself
[1:07:45] don't know when it's going to happen see
[1:07:46] God has this all to himself it's a
[1:07:49] secret and that's the reason there was
[1:07:51] silence in heaven for the space of half
[1:07:53] an hour and seven Thunders uttered their
[1:07:56] voices and John was forbidden to write
[1:07:58] it see the coming of the Lord
[1:08:01] so the coming of the Lord is laced into
[1:08:03] this mystery under these seals in this
[1:08:05] Secret Under the seventh mystery
[1:08:08] amen and brother Brahm ties all this to
[1:08:11] the third pull he ties all this to the
[1:08:13] declaring of the message all of these
[1:08:15] things tied together
[1:08:17] let's turn in our Bibles and look at
[1:08:19] Revelation chapter 8.
[1:08:24] I want to read this
[1:08:26] together so that we can see
[1:08:32] so in this quote
[1:08:34] brother Branham says that's the reason
[1:08:36] there was silence in heaven for space of
[1:08:38] half an hour come
[1:08:40] all right let's read Revelation 8 1 and
[1:08:43] when he had opened the seven seal there
[1:08:45] was silence in heaven about the space of
[1:08:47] half an hour so the silence in heaven is
[1:08:51] related to the opening of the seventh
[1:08:52] seal
[1:08:54] right so that's the first part of this
[1:08:56] sentence but the sentence is over let's
[1:08:58] go to Revelation 10 verse 1.
[1:09:01] and he says then Brothers says that's
[1:09:03] the reason of Silence in heaven for the
[1:09:04] space of half an hour that's Revelation
[1:09:06] 8 1 the opening of the seventh seal and
[1:09:09] seven Thunders utter their voices and
[1:09:11] John was even forbidden to write it see
[1:09:13] the coming of the Lord thou he ties two
[1:09:16] scriptures together and he puts them in
[1:09:18] the same sentence and makes them the
[1:09:20] same event
[1:09:21] and one is Revelations 8 1 the opening
[1:09:25] of the seventh seal in silence and now
[1:09:27] he ties it to Revelations 10 1-7 and
[1:09:30] let's read that together and I saw
[1:09:32] another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:09:34] heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[1:09:36] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:09:38] was as it were the Sun and his feet his
[1:09:40] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[1:09:42] little book open and he sat with he sat
[1:09:44] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[1:09:46] his left foot upon the Earth and cried
[1:09:48] with a loud voice is when a lion roared
[1:09:50] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[1:09:52] uttered their voices this is what
[1:09:54] brother branham's referring to in this
[1:09:56] quote the seven Thunders uttering their
[1:09:57] voices and he's attaching it to the
[1:09:59] seventh seal
[1:10:01] and now we're going to see why he calls
[1:10:03] it silence he attaches it to the Silence
[1:10:05] of the seventh seam
[1:10:07] and when the seven Thunders had uttered
[1:10:09] their voices I was about to write and I
[1:10:11] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying it to
[1:10:12] me seal up those things which is seven
[1:10:14] Thunders uttered and write them not
[1:10:18] so this is where brother Benham attaches
[1:10:20] these two portions of scripture together
[1:10:22] and he takes the opening of the seventh
[1:10:24] seal and silence there's not even a
[1:10:26] symbol like the other seals there's no
[1:10:28] White Horse no red horse no souls under
[1:10:29] the altar there's nothing to show it's
[1:10:31] absolute silence meaning it's an
[1:10:33] absolute mystery still
[1:10:35] then he comes to the seven Thunders and
[1:10:37] the Seven Thunders utter their voices
[1:10:38] amen and when the seven Thunders uttered
[1:10:40] their voices John was about to write
[1:10:42] because the uttering of the seven
[1:10:44] Thunders said something intelligible
[1:10:47] it wasn't just
[1:10:48] no it was a voice of God Amen that gave
[1:10:52] information that he could write down
[1:10:55] so John was about to write and he's
[1:10:57] about to write a voice from Heaven says
[1:10:59] right not what the seven Thunders
[1:11:01] uttered so there's an utterance under
[1:11:03] the seven Thunders that can be written
[1:11:05] down write them not and seal it up
[1:11:10] so what do we have in the seven Thunders
[1:11:12] we have a revelation amen that something
[1:11:14] was open just like just like in
[1:11:16] Revelation chapter eight we have the
[1:11:18] Revelation that the seventh seal was
[1:11:19] open it's open but what is it silence
[1:11:22] we don't know it's still a mystery we
[1:11:24] have seven Thunders seven Thunders
[1:11:26] uttered their voices absolutely they
[1:11:27] said something what did they say we
[1:11:29] don't know silence and brother bam ties
[1:11:31] these two together and he links it to
[1:11:33] the coming of the Lord because God kept
[1:11:36] this secret even Jesus didn't know what
[1:11:38] was it the coming of the Lord
[1:11:42] and it's part of the third pool and it's
[1:11:44] part of the Mad the the the prophet
[1:11:46] declaring his message and his message
[1:11:48] for running the second coming he said
[1:11:50] your message what is his message his
[1:11:52] message is the Mysteries revealed his
[1:11:54] message is the third pull is that
[1:11:56] message is the opening of the word and
[1:11:58] your message will forerun his second
[1:11:59] coming and here he ties it all together
[1:12:01] with the scriptures
[1:12:05] praise be to God
[1:12:07] so beautiful
[1:12:09] this is the this is the message friends
[1:12:15] let's go on
[1:12:18] verse 5 and the angel which I saw stand
[1:12:20] upon the sea and upon the Earth lift up
[1:12:21] his hand to Heaven swear by him that
[1:12:24] liveth forever and ever who created
[1:12:25] heaven and the things that therein are
[1:12:27] in the earth the things that therein are
[1:12:29] and the Sea and the things which are
[1:12:30] therein that there should be time no
[1:12:32] longer but in the days of the voice of
[1:12:34] the seventh angel
[1:12:35] who's the seventh angel
[1:12:37] we can give it a name William Branham he
[1:12:40] came as the seventh angel
[1:12:41] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:12:43] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:12:45] sound
[1:12:47] when he shot brother bam said not in the
[1:12:49] healing not when he started out but when
[1:12:51] he began to declare his message
[1:12:55] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:12:57] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:12:58] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:13:00] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:13:02] servants the prophets
[1:13:03] brother Branham takes Revelation 10 1-7
[1:13:05] and he makes that he may he attaches
[1:13:09] that to the seventh seal
[1:13:10] he calls that seventh seal the end time
[1:13:13] seal
[1:13:14] and and brother Branham calls himself
[1:13:16] the the messenger of the seven seal
[1:13:20] and the messenger of the seventh seal
[1:13:22] his message is Revelations 10 1-7
[1:13:27] praise God so now you can you can begin
[1:13:30] to see and and why are we going through
[1:13:31] all this brother Chad amen because I
[1:13:33] just feel like it amen praise the Lord
[1:13:35] it makes me feel good but also I want us
[1:13:37] to absolutely understand where we are
[1:13:40] amen and not not go backwards in
[1:13:43] Revelation to a previous thing I don't
[1:13:46] want to go back Amen to the first and
[1:13:48] second pull amen you know what the the
[1:13:51] supernatural things and effects that
[1:13:53] were there and the restoration of gifts
[1:13:54] it's in the church and it can still
[1:13:56] attract the tension of the little fish
[1:13:59] how many times can you testify of God
[1:14:01] healing your body
[1:14:03] how many times supernatural has God
[1:14:05] delivered you or answered a prayer how
[1:14:06] many times has God discerned your very
[1:14:08] thoughts amen through a brother through
[1:14:10] a conversation through a tape through a
[1:14:11] sermon how many times has God worked
[1:14:13] Supernatural in your life and you can
[1:14:15] share those Supernatural things
[1:14:18] and what can it do it can attract
[1:14:19] attention
[1:14:22] amen and it can get the little fish to
[1:14:24] come then it can get the little fish to
[1:14:26] scatter
[1:14:31] is that right the same process can work
[1:14:34] in our life
[1:14:37] but what is going to catch the Covenant
[1:14:39] fish
[1:14:41] it's going to be the opening of the word
[1:14:44] it's going to be the Mysteries revealed
[1:14:46] it's going to be the third pool it's
[1:14:48] going to be this Revelation Amen in the
[1:14:51] seals is actually what's going to catch
[1:14:53] the rainbow trout amen we still have
[1:14:55] things in our life that vindicate
[1:14:57] improve and we still have manifestation
[1:14:59] and we still have ways to declare God
[1:15:01] absolutely amen but they will not catch
[1:15:03] the Covenant fish they may get attention
[1:15:06] from the fish amen when it scatters the
[1:15:08] little fish but it will catch them is
[1:15:10] the same thing that will catch them and
[1:15:12] brother branham's vision is the same
[1:15:13] thing they'll catch them now
[1:15:15] it's the opening of the word
[1:15:19] so I have another question
[1:15:28] all right and now this is always my
[1:15:31] disclaimer
[1:15:33] if I misspell on this just love me
[1:15:35] anyways
[1:15:37] and if I misspell really badly please
[1:15:40] don't laugh out loud
[1:15:42] it'll get in my head and I won't be able
[1:15:44] to finish the sermon
[1:15:47] okay
[1:16:03] well you're not a good speller and it's
[1:16:06] silent and everybody's watching you
[1:16:07] possibly you can't imagine what pressure
[1:16:10] this is
[1:16:13] and then I gotta grammarize that's
[1:16:15] commas I don't even know if they're
[1:16:16] there right
[1:16:18] okay I'm gonna face the sentence
[1:16:36] all right we're almost done
[1:16:44] all right there's our question
[1:16:47] how does the Elijah of Malachi 4 turn
[1:16:50] the hearts of the children to the
[1:16:52] fathers
[1:16:54] it's a good question because we want to
[1:16:56] know we use we use these terms we use
[1:16:59] these scriptures we talk about this law
[1:17:01] we know who the Elijah Malachi 4 is it
[1:17:03] was William Branham we know who the
[1:17:05] seventh Angels it's William Branham I
[1:17:07] mean these are not Mysteries we know
[1:17:08] they are amen and and so when we use the
[1:17:12] term the message what are we talking
[1:17:14] about we're talking about his message
[1:17:16] the opening of the word the revealing of
[1:17:18] the Mysteries Revelation 10 1-7 that's
[1:17:21] really what we're talking about we say
[1:17:23] the message
[1:17:25] now when we say the Elijah of Malachi 4
[1:17:28] we know that that is William Branham
[1:17:31] when we go to Revelation 10 1 7 when it
[1:17:33] says the voice of seventh angel that's
[1:17:34] William Branham so that's why brother
[1:17:36] Branham can take Revelation 10 1-7 or
[1:17:38] other let's say Revelation 10 7 and
[1:17:41] Malachi 4 5 and 6 and he can put them
[1:17:43] right together because they're the same
[1:17:45] person
[1:17:46] right
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:49] praise God so we're there
[1:17:53] but he's commissioned to do something
[1:17:57] and that something is first to turn the
[1:18:01] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:18:03] and that was accomplished in John the
[1:18:06] Baptist ministry
[1:18:07] is that right he took the he took the
[1:18:10] fathers of of the Old Testament faith
[1:18:12] and turned them to the New and Living
[1:18:14] Way to the way of the children of the
[1:18:16] way of the Apostles amen and so he
[1:18:18] turned them and and prepared the way for
[1:18:21] the Lord but now there's another Elijah
[1:18:23] coming that we read in the beginning in
[1:18:25] Matthew when he says Elias shall first
[1:18:27] come and restore all things John the
[1:18:29] Baptist did not restore all things he
[1:18:30] prepared the way preparing the way and
[1:18:33] restoration are two different works
[1:18:35] so the first part of this prophecy is
[1:18:37] fulfilled by John the Baptist but the
[1:18:39] second part of this prophecy turned the
[1:18:40] heart to the children to the father amen
[1:18:42] could not have been done by John the
[1:18:44] Baptist Jesus prophesied yes Elijah
[1:18:47] shall come a first
[1:18:50] and restore all things
[1:18:52] that's the Elijah that we're talking
[1:18:55] about amen that we know is William
[1:18:57] Branham
[1:18:58] but he was to come and do something
[1:19:02] and that was to turn the hearts of the
[1:19:03] children to the fathers
[1:19:06] so the revelation of Malachi 4
[1:19:12] uh
[1:19:14] I want to be careful how I word this
[1:19:18] you cannot make it simplistic and say
[1:19:21] the revelation of Malachi 4 is God
[1:19:22] sending a prophet
[1:19:24] that is not actually the full revelation
[1:19:27] of Malachi 4.
[1:19:29] if we think Malachi 4
[1:19:33] is God sending a prophet
[1:19:35] then we only understand a fraction of
[1:19:38] Malachi 4. and I would say a tiny
[1:19:41] fraction of Malachi 4 a very small part
[1:19:43] of Malachi 4. so when we treat Malachi 4
[1:19:46] that prophecy as only the prophecy of a
[1:19:50] coming Prophet we have really limited
[1:19:53] our Revelation and our ability to
[1:19:54] understand what this is all about
[1:19:57] and so many times I see we we as I'm
[1:20:01] talking about brothers and sisters in
[1:20:02] the message we treat the prophecy of
[1:20:04] Malachi 4 as only as if it has to do
[1:20:06] with brother Branham
[1:20:08] and as if it only has to do with God
[1:20:09] sending Elijah but that to me that's
[1:20:13] that's the the smaller part
[1:20:15] of that scripture because once Elijah
[1:20:18] comes he's commissioned to do something
[1:20:20] to me that's the point of the prophecy
[1:20:23] so the point of the prophecy is not just
[1:20:25] it'll come that's part of it but what's
[1:20:27] he supposed to do once he comes that
[1:20:29] becomes the bulk or the purpose or the
[1:20:31] intent of the prophecy and what he's
[1:20:33] supposed to do is turn the hearts of the
[1:20:35] children back to the fathers amen so
[1:20:37] what's the intent of Malachi 4 what's
[1:20:40] the point of Malachi 4 what's to be
[1:20:42] accomplished in Malachi 4 is that this
[1:20:45] Elijah this Prophet is to come he's
[1:20:47] commissioned with a task and that is to
[1:20:49] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:20:51] the fathers this is Malachi 4.
[1:20:56] the heart of Malachi 4 especially for
[1:20:58] our day
[1:21:00] I hope that you see what I'm saying now
[1:21:02] not diminishing there's nothing that we
[1:21:04] ever say in any way to want to diminish
[1:21:06] the message of the of the Prophet the
[1:21:08] message of the Prophet is the message
[1:21:11] is the word is Christ is everything we
[1:21:13] want to emphasize we're not trying to
[1:21:15] downplay him we're trying to find out
[1:21:17] what he came to do amen and really catch
[1:21:19] the purpose of Malachi 4. so so many
[1:21:21] times we rattle off Malachi 4 Revelation
[1:21:24] 17 30. and these are just throw out
[1:21:26] scriptures Revelation 10 7 and in many
[1:21:28] ways where we're referring back to
[1:21:31] William Branham Malachi 4 that's him
[1:21:33] Revelation 10 7. that's him amen uh uh
[1:21:37] uh Luke 17 30. that's him
[1:21:43] but the greater part of every one of
[1:21:45] those scriptures
[1:21:47] is what's supposed to happen when he's
[1:21:49] here
[1:21:52] he has to come to fulfill the commission
[1:21:54] he has to come to do the work of a
[1:21:56] prophet amen but the work of the Prophet
[1:21:58] is the heart of these scriptures
[1:22:01] so what will happen in Malachi 4 when
[1:22:04] that Prophet comes he'll turn the hearts
[1:22:06] of the children back to the fathers
[1:22:08] well what will happen in Luke 17 30 in
[1:22:10] Luke 17 30 there'll be a revealing of
[1:22:11] the son of man the revealing of the son
[1:22:13] of man is attached to the coming of the
[1:22:15] son of man it signifies a personal
[1:22:17] coming
[1:22:21] two we get excited that Luke 17 30 amen
[1:22:26] we could see that scripture refill we
[1:22:28] could see that scripture fulfilled and
[1:22:30] manifest in that man that's exciting but
[1:22:33] there's something more behind that
[1:22:34] scripture what's he revealing he's
[1:22:37] revealing the son of man this is
[1:22:38] attached to the brother bam takes this
[1:22:40] amen and he takes the scripture in
[1:22:42] Matthew that says in the coming of the
[1:22:44] son of man show shall be in the days of
[1:22:45] Noah and he attaches them together the
[1:22:47] revealing of the son of man is also the
[1:22:49] coming of the son of man
[1:22:53] to me that's profound
[1:22:57] I can know
[1:22:59] in what vessel the son of man was
[1:23:02] revealed
[1:23:04] but if I stop there I've missed the
[1:23:08] point
[1:23:10] I can know who the Elijah of our day is
[1:23:13] but if I stop there I missed the point
[1:23:15] of Elijah company
[1:23:17] and I can tell you who the seventh angel
[1:23:19] is in Revelation 10 7. amen that in the
[1:23:21] days of the voice of the seventh angel I
[1:23:23] can tell you who that is that's William
[1:23:25] Brandon but if I stop there I missed the
[1:23:27] point of that voice
[1:23:30] because under that voice the mystery of
[1:23:32] God is to be finished
[1:23:34] to me all of these things that we're
[1:23:36] talking about become the profound part
[1:23:38] of these scriptures amen because if he
[1:23:41] had come and not done this then it would
[1:23:43] not be the Fulfillment of the scripture
[1:23:46] if he had come listen
[1:23:50] if brother Branham had come
[1:23:53] and he had discern the thoughts and
[1:23:55] intents of the heart amen if he had
[1:23:57] shown the sign amen of discernment if he
[1:23:59] had prayed for the sick had healing
[1:24:01] campaigns had a sign in his hand had had
[1:24:03] all kinds of uh Supernatural taking
[1:24:05] place but he never brought the the
[1:24:08] fullness of the mystery of God finished
[1:24:10] if he never brought the revelation of
[1:24:12] the coming of the son of man if he never
[1:24:14] turned the hearts of the children back
[1:24:15] to the fathers he would be disqualified
[1:24:17] for that office
[1:24:22] so that's why sometimes I find it
[1:24:24] discouraging in the message that we only
[1:24:26] refer to those things as that man
[1:24:30] and that's as far sometimes as our
[1:24:32] Revelation goes is God sent a prophet
[1:24:35] what was that Prophet sent for
[1:24:38] and what was he supposed to do and what
[1:24:41] does that mean to me
[1:24:45] now we're getting somewhere
[1:24:48] because there was a purpose behind it
[1:24:50] all
[1:24:52] now here's our question
[1:24:54] what does the Elijah of Malachi 4
[1:24:57] how does the Elijah of Malachi 4 turn
[1:24:59] the hearts of the children to the
[1:25:00] fathers
[1:25:03] in the church age book
[1:25:05] laodicean Church age now this messenger
[1:25:07] of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 7.
[1:25:11] he didn't make them two different
[1:25:12] Messengers that's one messenger
[1:25:15] now the messenger of Malachi 4 and
[1:25:16] Revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[1:25:18] things one according to Malachi 4 he
[1:25:22] will turn the hearts of the children to
[1:25:23] the fathers two he will reveal the
[1:25:26] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:25:28] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[1:25:30] contained in the Seven Seals
[1:25:34] now listen here we go here's the punch
[1:25:36] line
[1:25:37] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:25:39] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:25:42] hearts of the children to the
[1:25:43] Pentecostal fathers exactly so
[1:25:46] how's he going to do it by showing a
[1:25:48] sign in his hand how's he going to do it
[1:25:50] by showing the sermon no he's trying to
[1:25:52] attract the attention of the rainbow
[1:25:54] trout and get them to come near and
[1:25:56] listen to him that's what all that was
[1:25:58] about but how is he going to do it he's
[1:25:59] going to do it by revealing the mystery
[1:26:01] truths that are contained in the Seven
[1:26:03] Seals which are literally the
[1:26:04] revelations under the seals
[1:26:09] so how
[1:26:11] how does he turn
[1:26:15] the hearts of the children to the
[1:26:16] fathers
[1:26:20] where am I
[1:26:33] through revelation 10.
[1:26:37] that's how he does it
[1:26:40] which is
[1:26:49] the revealing
[1:26:52] of
[1:26:55] the mystery
[1:26:59] truths
[1:27:05] that's according to the prophet
[1:27:08] how he accomplishes and fulfills the
[1:27:11] prophecy of Malachi 4.
[1:27:17] you see what emphasis we should put on
[1:27:19] the seals
[1:27:20] and my emphasis we should put on the
[1:27:22] third poem what emphasis we should put
[1:27:23] on the Mysteries review what emphasis we
[1:27:25] should put on the seventh seal right
[1:27:28] this is why standing in the pulpit and
[1:27:30] just rehearsing the ministry of brother
[1:27:32] Branham and the supernatural science and
[1:27:33] telling all the stories it that will not
[1:27:36] catch the rainbow trout it can attract
[1:27:39] the rainbow trout
[1:27:41] and so there's times for that there's
[1:27:42] times that that is important there's
[1:27:44] time that it's needed there's times that
[1:27:45] that is useful because we still want to
[1:27:47] attract the fish
[1:27:49] we're still calling the elect we're
[1:27:51] still drawing their attention
[1:27:52] but that's why when we just stand up and
[1:27:54] just rehearse brother Benham did this
[1:27:56] and brother Benham did that and brother
[1:27:57] Venom did this and the supernatural was
[1:27:59] here and the supernatural was there and
[1:28:00] God did this miracle and God did that
[1:28:02] miracle
[1:28:03] that's wonderful that may draw the coven
[1:28:06] efficient but how will you hook them and
[1:28:08] land them
[1:28:09] in the gospel net it's going to take
[1:28:13] revelation 10.
[1:28:16] it's going to take the revealing of the
[1:28:18] mystery truths
[1:28:20] that's how it's done I read that again
[1:28:25] just so we lock it in as you're reading
[1:28:27] the board this messenger Malachi 4 in
[1:28:29] Revelation 10 is going to do two things
[1:28:31] one according to Malachi 4 you will turn
[1:28:33] the hearts of the children to the
[1:28:34] fathers two he will reveal the mysteries
[1:28:36] of the seven thunders in Revelations 10
[1:28:38] which are the revelations contained in
[1:28:40] the Seven Seals
[1:28:42] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:28:45] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:28:48] hearts of the children to the
[1:28:49] Pentecostal fathers exactly so
[1:28:56] let's go to Daniel
[1:28:59] chapter 12.
[1:29:06] something important that I want to look
[1:29:08] at here
[1:29:10] because I also want to understand this
[1:29:11] statement
[1:29:15] how were the third pool the opening of
[1:29:17] the seals the sounding of the Thunders
[1:29:19] the opening of the word the Mysteries
[1:29:21] revealed these are all synonymous terms
[1:29:24] how will that literally turn the heart
[1:29:26] to the children to the Pentecostal
[1:29:28] fathers
[1:29:30] let's begin to look in Daniel chapter
[1:29:32] 12. verse 4.
[1:29:42] but thou will Daniel
[1:29:44] shut up the words and seal the book even
[1:29:46] to the time of the end and many shall
[1:29:48] run to and fro and knowledge shall be
[1:29:50] increased
[1:29:51] then I Daniel looked and behold there
[1:29:53] stood two other one on I'm sorry I don't
[1:29:55] want to read on I just want to stop with
[1:29:57] that seal up the book now I want to go
[1:29:58] down to verse 8. let's jump down to
[1:29:59] verse 8.
[1:30:01] it says and I heard but I understood not
[1:30:03] then said I O Lord
[1:30:06] oh my Lord what shall be the end of thee
[1:30:08] what shall be the end of these things
[1:30:10] and he said go thy Way Daniel for the
[1:30:13] words are closed up and sealed to the
[1:30:16] time of the end
[1:30:18] so there was a revelation there was a
[1:30:20] mystery of what God was going to do even
[1:30:22] with the nation of of Israel
[1:30:25] and God was showing what will be the end
[1:30:28] of these matters and he began to see
[1:30:30] Envision but he did not understand
[1:30:33] and he asked and he said God what what
[1:30:36] is the meaning of this when shall these
[1:30:37] things be he said go thy Way Daniel for
[1:30:40] the vision is sealed up until the time
[1:30:42] of the end so that means this is a
[1:30:44] sealed vision of what God will do and
[1:30:46] how God will transpire these things to
[1:30:48] the end and I that is all sealed up but
[1:30:51] it's not sealed up forever it's sealed
[1:30:53] up to a particular time
[1:30:55] and the word tells us that these things
[1:30:58] are sealed up until the time of the end
[1:31:00] so that tells us that there's a marker
[1:31:02] here that if these things ever get
[1:31:04] revealed then we'll know we're at the
[1:31:06] end time
[1:31:07] the minute that this was what's laid
[1:31:10] secret in the Bible what's been
[1:31:11] unreviewed what's been unspoken what's
[1:31:13] been Undeclared what's been sealed up
[1:31:14] when it becomes unsealed that is the
[1:31:17] stamped that's the marker we are now at
[1:31:19] the end time
[1:31:21] because you know there was prophecies
[1:31:23] laying in the Bible amen Prophecies of
[1:31:25] Joel Prophecies of David types and
[1:31:27] shadows All Through the Bible when we
[1:31:29] come to the day of Pentecost amen and
[1:31:31] and Jesus had died he had resurrected
[1:31:33] amen he had shown himself to disciples
[1:31:36] he had raised again they knew that Jesus
[1:31:38] was the Messiah they knew that he had
[1:31:40] died they knew he raised again they they
[1:31:42] knew he was on the right hand of power
[1:31:44] they knew all of these things but yet
[1:31:46] they were waiting for something amen
[1:31:48] they were waiting for a designation for
[1:31:50] a marker for a happening for an event
[1:31:53] to launch them into their Ministry
[1:31:56] and so they were waiting for 10 days in
[1:31:59] the upper room amen but then all of a
[1:32:01] sudden the promise of the fathers came
[1:32:03] the Fulfillment of the scripture amen
[1:32:06] the prophecy now come into manifestation
[1:32:09] and when that happened amen The Men Who
[1:32:11] were frightened before the men who who
[1:32:14] were discouraged and unsure and
[1:32:15] uncertain and all of these things that
[1:32:17] were going on now all of a sudden they
[1:32:19] were filled with the spirit of God they
[1:32:21] changed with a boldness they ran out
[1:32:22] into the street and with a boldness they
[1:32:24] proclaimed this is nothing but the word
[1:32:27] of God this is that and this is this and
[1:32:29] this is that and now they were taking
[1:32:30] the word and they were placing it
[1:32:34] what happened to their faith when they
[1:32:36] realized this is the scripture fulfilled
[1:32:38] this is the prophecy come this is the
[1:32:40] marker of time now it's not a prophecy
[1:32:43] now it's a happening
[1:32:45] it's no longer a prophecy it's a reality
[1:32:48] it's a manifestation the prophecy is now
[1:32:51] real what did it do to them it increased
[1:32:53] their faith it gave them lying like
[1:32:54] boldness it gave him the ability to go
[1:32:56] out in the face of everything and now
[1:32:58] declare the truth who were hiding before
[1:33:00] now the Spirit came according to the
[1:33:02] word and they were men that were bold
[1:33:03] they knew who they were they knew their
[1:33:05] position they knew what they were
[1:33:06] supposed to do
[1:33:09] and now there's something that's going
[1:33:11] to come under the revelation of the
[1:33:15] Seven Seals under the sounding of the
[1:33:18] seven Thunders under the third pool
[1:33:20] under the revealing of the Mysteries
[1:33:21] under the seventh Angels Ministry
[1:33:25] that will bring us back to that same
[1:33:27] faith
[1:33:30] what is it
[1:33:32] it's the revealing of the Mysteries
[1:33:35] what do you mean brother Chad
[1:33:37] it's the time date stamp marker you are
[1:33:42] here
[1:33:44] you are here and if you can receive it
[1:33:47] you are it
[1:33:51] and it brings us right back to the faith
[1:33:54] of the fathers now I know this is the
[1:33:56] day for prophecy to be filled modern
[1:33:58] events May clear by prophecy that is
[1:34:00] this what you see now is that prophecy
[1:34:03] being fulfilled amen when he promised
[1:34:05] that he would have a bride he's having a
[1:34:07] bride right now when he promised he
[1:34:09] would wash her with the water of the
[1:34:10] word the washing is taking place right
[1:34:12] now
[1:34:14] this is that we know who we are when the
[1:34:17] spirit was held back because the word
[1:34:19] was held back through the nominational
[1:34:21] rivers but in the evening time it's to
[1:34:23] be loosed by the evening time message
[1:34:24] the Holy Ghost back and the people again
[1:34:26] why there's no more false teaching
[1:34:29] barrier there's no more misunderstanding
[1:34:31] barrier but now when the word the
[1:34:33] revelation of the word comes back it
[1:34:35] unlocks and unbinds the moving of the
[1:34:38] spirit to come back and make us what it
[1:34:40] intended to make us in the beginning he
[1:34:42] said You shall be endued with power from
[1:34:44] on high and ye shall be my Witnesses
[1:34:51] what are we his Witnesses
[1:34:54] that this is that
[1:34:57] this is the end time this is beyond
[1:35:00] Pentecost
[1:35:01] laodicea has failed
[1:35:04] it's gone into apostasy it's an absolute
[1:35:07] blackout God showed in the heavens above
[1:35:09] there's no light there anymore it's
[1:35:11] blacked out under Church apostasy the
[1:35:13] church is there but the bride has been
[1:35:15] called out of that because laodicea has
[1:35:17] failed and there's not one good
[1:35:19] statement made in your Bible about
[1:35:21] laodicea
[1:35:23] in every age you can see an
[1:35:26] accommodation and you can see a rebuke
[1:35:31] say you've held your first love or
[1:35:34] you've held to the work you've lost your
[1:35:36] first love it's always he's why because
[1:35:38] he's speaking to two Vines
[1:35:41] but when he comes to laodicea because
[1:35:43] this will be revealed at the end time
[1:35:44] when he comes to laodicea he has nothing
[1:35:46] good to say about laodicea and you tell
[1:35:49] me his bride is there amen under that
[1:35:52] church and he has nothing good to say
[1:35:54] about it
[1:35:57] where is Christ at the end of the Legacy
[1:35:59] in churches he's on the outside knocking
[1:36:01] that's why brother men and preached
[1:36:03] going beyond the camp now we've got to
[1:36:04] go beyond the camp of religion on the
[1:36:06] camp of denomination go beyond the walls
[1:36:08] of religion and go out and be United
[1:36:09] with the one that's been pushed out
[1:36:12] what's been pushed out the word
[1:36:17] amen
[1:36:23] so what is
[1:36:25] the revealing of the seven Thunders
[1:36:29] it's revealing of what's been sealed up
[1:36:31] in the Bible all this time waiting for
[1:36:34] the end time to be revealed
[1:36:41] and in the end time who will reveal it
[1:36:44] it'll come through a prophet
[1:36:48] but it will be revealed by Jesus Christ
[1:36:51] but it'll take a profit on the scene
[1:36:55] but to me I think the biggest question
[1:36:59] is who will it be revealed to
[1:37:03] and here in May lie the greatest mystery
[1:37:06] of all the Mysteries
[1:37:09] not who will he reveal it through
[1:37:12] but who will he reveal it to
[1:37:16] and if you can catch the revelation of
[1:37:18] that secret all of a sudden it'll change
[1:37:21] you
[1:37:22] change the way you think change the way
[1:37:23] you feel change everything about you
[1:37:27] amen
[1:37:30] brother Venom says in the church age
[1:37:31] book and the laodicean church age he
[1:37:33] says it was in the end time period that
[1:37:36] the seven thunders of Jesus came forth
[1:37:39] did you catch that it was in the end
[1:37:41] time period that the seven thunders of
[1:37:43] Jesus came forth then he quotes
[1:37:45] Revelations 10 3-4 that we just read
[1:37:48] said what was in those Thunders
[1:37:51] listen close what was in those Thunders
[1:37:54] no one knows but we need to know
[1:37:59] no one knows but we need to know you
[1:38:01] can't just say nobody knows it's a
[1:38:03] mystery brother Branham says we need to
[1:38:05] know
[1:38:07] and it will take a profit to get the
[1:38:09] Revelation because God has no other way
[1:38:11] of bringing out his scriptural
[1:38:12] Revelations except by a prophet
[1:38:15] and questions and answers in 64 he says
[1:38:17] have the question comes have the seven
[1:38:19] Thunders which equal seven Mysteries
[1:38:21] already been revealed
[1:38:23] were they revealed in the Seven Seals
[1:38:25] but are yet but are yet not known to us
[1:38:27] as the Thunders yet
[1:38:29] brother Brown says no they were revealed
[1:38:32] in the Seven Seals that means the
[1:38:33] preaching of the Seven Seals
[1:38:36] they were revealed in the Seven Seals
[1:38:38] that's what the Thunders was about
[1:38:41] what is the Thunder's about it's about
[1:38:43] the seals it's the Revelation that was
[1:38:45] contained in the seals when the seals
[1:38:47] came forth they came forth in a symbol
[1:38:49] for him to go out to the church for 2000
[1:38:51] years as a symbol amen but what the
[1:38:53] symbols represented that was the mystery
[1:38:55] hid under the Thunders amen and the
[1:38:57] Thunders revealed the seals
[1:39:00] amen
[1:39:02] let's keep reading
[1:39:04] they were revealing the Seven Seals
[1:39:05] that's what the Thunders was about they
[1:39:07] was the seven Thunders that had uttered
[1:39:09] their voices and no one can make it out
[1:39:11] John knew what it was but he was
[1:39:13] forbidden to write it he said but the
[1:39:15] seventh angel in the days of a sounding
[1:39:17] the seven Mysteries of the seven
[1:39:19] Thunders would be revealed and the
[1:39:21] seventh angel is a messenger of the
[1:39:23] seventh Church age
[1:39:25] William Branham
[1:39:27] praise God
[1:39:29] so in the days
[1:39:31] of that sounding the seven Mysteries of
[1:39:33] the seven Thunders would be revealed
[1:39:34] which means we're in the end time
[1:39:38] which means if you can receive it that
[1:39:41] must make you the end time bride
[1:39:44] not a church age bride
[1:39:46] this is an end time bride
[1:39:48] not a previous age bride not not a bride
[1:39:51] that came up through a partial
[1:39:52] Revelation like Lutheran like Wesley and
[1:39:54] like Pentecost this is not now this is
[1:39:57] the end time meaning now it's time for
[1:39:59] an end time bride that's right brother
[1:40:00] Branham attached this Revelation with
[1:40:03] the end time and the people made for
[1:40:06] this Revelation as the end time people
[1:40:08] are the end time bride it doesn't mean
[1:40:11] there wasn't Pentecostal brine it wasn't
[1:40:13] uh you know every other age had bride
[1:40:16] but this is end time bride and it takes
[1:40:18] an end time message to wake up the end
[1:40:20] time bride to bring the bride to her
[1:40:23] Revival
[1:40:24] her Awakening was going to come under
[1:40:27] this word
[1:40:30] in the breach
[1:40:32] he says this is right at the beginning
[1:40:34] of the seals when the seals are broken
[1:40:36] the Mysteries revealed down comes the
[1:40:38] angel the messenger Christ sitting
[1:40:40] setting his foot upon the land and upon
[1:40:42] the sea with a rainbow over his head now
[1:40:44] remember this seventh angel is on Earth
[1:40:46] at the time of this coming
[1:40:49] that was Revelations 10 1 and a mighty I
[1:40:52] saw a mighty Angel descend from heaven
[1:40:54] amen with a book in his hand amen and it
[1:40:56] gave the description and brother Branham
[1:40:58] tells us we'll read that in a minute
[1:41:00] that that's Christ
[1:41:02] that's the true Messenger that's Christ
[1:41:05] not coming in his body that was pierced
[1:41:08] it's not that this is this is a great
[1:41:10] Mighty Angel this is a spiritual coming
[1:41:14] or you could say an invisible coming
[1:41:17] but the question is is invisible real
[1:41:22] are we waiting for it to be real or is
[1:41:24] it real
[1:41:25] is this opening of the seals amen the
[1:41:28] silence attached to the seven Thunders
[1:41:30] have the seven Thunders utter their
[1:41:31] voices yes it was the seals if the seven
[1:41:33] Thunders uttered their voices amen then
[1:41:35] then all of a sudden now we've come to
[1:41:37] this great mystery which is what the
[1:41:38] coming of the Lord and brother Branham
[1:41:40] says the angel of the seventh angel will
[1:41:42] be on Earth at the time of this coming
[1:41:43] of this Mighty Angel which is Christ
[1:41:50] amen
[1:41:54] praise be to God
[1:41:56] the seventh angels on Earth
[1:41:59] time of this coming
[1:42:03] which is attached to the seventh seal
[1:42:07] which is attached to the silence which
[1:42:09] is attached to what wasn't written of
[1:42:12] what the seven Thunder spoke they all go
[1:42:14] together
[1:42:16] why because brother Branham could not
[1:42:19] open the seals
[1:42:21] brother Branham could not preach the
[1:42:23] seals unless Christ came down and
[1:42:26] revealed to him what was under those
[1:42:28] seals what those seven Thunders uttered
[1:42:30] that's why when brother bam I said
[1:42:31] before when he comes to the end of the
[1:42:32] seals he says don't say thank you to any
[1:42:34] man no man had anything to do with this
[1:42:38] he goes I was just as unsure of what
[1:42:40] those seals was as you or maybe anybody
[1:42:42] else
[1:42:43] but if he hadn't come
[1:42:45] I would have made a terrible mistake
[1:42:51] praise God
[1:42:54] amen
[1:42:55] again in the breach a couple paragraphs
[1:42:57] down
[1:42:58] says now we see that this seven sealed
[1:43:01] book now is the mystery of redemption
[1:43:03] it's a book of redemption from God now
[1:43:05] all the Mysteries at this time should be
[1:43:07] finished at the sounding of this
[1:43:08] messenger now here's here's the angel on
[1:43:10] Earth and another Angel Mighty messenger
[1:43:12] come down this Angel was an Earthly
[1:43:14] Angel messenger But Here Comes one down
[1:43:16] from heaven a rainbow Covenant only
[1:43:19] Christ it could be
[1:43:22] who's this messenger in Revelation 10 1
[1:43:24] he said only Christ it could be when
[1:43:27] does he come at the time the seventh
[1:43:29] angel is on Earth
[1:43:33] let's go to First Peter 1 13.
[1:43:47] my goodness I just about got excited
[1:43:50] I looked down here and somebody changed
[1:43:52] his clock there's a little clock here
[1:43:54] that tells me what time it is
[1:43:56] but somehow it got changed and it
[1:43:57] bounces between the date and the time
[1:44:00] now so I looked down and said 9 11. I'm
[1:44:02] thinking I've got hours to preach
[1:44:06] then I looked again at changed I said oh
[1:44:08] dear lord
[1:44:10] I'm in trouble
[1:44:12] I thought I was doing really good
[1:44:14] I'm going backwards in time
[1:44:16] First Peter 1 13.
[1:44:20] wherefore good up gird up the loins of
[1:44:22] your mind be sober and hope to the end
[1:44:24] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[1:44:26] you at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:44:29] what's coming to us a Grace is coming to
[1:44:32] us at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:44:34] what is the opening of the seals it's
[1:44:37] the revealing of Christ
[1:44:39] what's coming to you Grace
[1:44:41] at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:44:44] in Zechariah we know the ministry was
[1:44:46] Aruba was to rebuild the Temple and it
[1:44:48] says who art thou a great Mountain
[1:44:50] before zerubbabel thou shall become a
[1:44:52] plane and he shall bring forth The
[1:44:54] Headstone there with shoutings crying
[1:44:55] Grace Grace unto it brother bear says
[1:44:58] double Grace amen there is an extra
[1:45:00] measure of Grace that's coming at the
[1:45:01] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:45:04] which is what the opening of the seals
[1:45:06] and the revelation of the seventh seal
[1:45:09] he said in future home he says yes
[1:45:10] become become a part of the word a part
[1:45:13] of the word of today can't be a part of
[1:45:15] the word of Moses day that part is done
[1:45:17] made up that was the feat we're at the
[1:45:20] head now this is Christ not the arms
[1:45:22] time back in Luther this is the head
[1:45:24] time
[1:45:25] Christ The Headstone comes to the body
[1:45:30] praise God
[1:45:33] in John 1 1 I'm going to just quote it
[1:45:35] to you because you know it by heart
[1:45:37] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:45:39] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:45:42] then verse 14 says and the Word was made
[1:45:44] flesh and dwelt among us and we know
[1:45:46] that was Jesus Christ coming into
[1:45:48] Earthly manifestation
[1:45:52] so the word of God
[1:45:54] is God
[1:45:56] come from God is part of God
[1:46:02] it's the thoughts of God being expressed
[1:46:04] and now that word can take on flesh and
[1:46:07] the fullness of the word took on flesh
[1:46:08] in Jesus Christ
[1:46:12] so Christ was the word made flesh
[1:46:15] and I want to deal with that for just a
[1:46:17] few moments
[1:46:18] in in the message modern events make
[1:46:20] clear by prophecy all of these quotes
[1:46:22] are coming from 63 64 and 65 and I'm
[1:46:26] completely unashamed to say that because
[1:46:28] that's when he began to declare his
[1:46:30] message at the opening of the seals
[1:46:32] so it doesn't mean that there's nothing
[1:46:34] of value pre-seals many of the things he
[1:46:36] taught post deals he taught pre-seals
[1:46:39] the Teaching Ministry went on before
[1:46:41] there could be no ladder rain without
[1:46:42] the Teaching Ministry so the I take
[1:46:44] great value in everything that was
[1:46:46] preached before but he began to declare
[1:46:48] his message at the opening of the seals
[1:46:51] and this is the third pool and this is
[1:46:53] what gets the rainbow trout so I'm
[1:46:55] unashamed to labor in post-seal's quotes
[1:46:58] because that is the bride's message it
[1:47:00] all goes together I I believe that I
[1:47:02] agree with it amen but he began to
[1:47:04] declare his message and really declare
[1:47:06] it clearly and by the time he comes in
[1:47:08] 1965 he's just saying it now amen he's
[1:47:11] declaring it more and more clearly all
[1:47:13] the time
[1:47:16] so in modern events made clear by
[1:47:18] prophecy he says but he said all I'll
[1:47:20] meet them in one place the place I put
[1:47:22] my name that's in Jesus Christ that's
[1:47:25] where God puts his name that's the only
[1:47:27] place he'll meet you and it's Christ the
[1:47:29] word
[1:47:31] oh I want you to catch that there's one
[1:47:33] place he'll meet you there's one
[1:47:35] provided place that he put his name
[1:47:37] where did he put his name he put it in
[1:47:40] Jesus Christ he said that's where God
[1:47:42] put his name we all believe that
[1:47:45] he said that's the only place he'll meet
[1:47:46] you and it's Christ is the word the same
[1:47:50] yesterday it's growing from the feet the
[1:47:53] thighs and now in the head fixing to go
[1:47:55] manifesting in full measure the bride
[1:47:57] the same as the groom
[1:47:59] but if I'm saying he's only going to
[1:48:00] meet you in the place he puts his name
[1:48:02] and he put his name in Jesus Christ
[1:48:03] because all the family in Heaven and
[1:48:04] Earth is named that name
[1:48:06] we agree
[1:48:07] but he doesn't limit it to Jesus when he
[1:48:11] was in the fleshly form The Man from
[1:48:14] Nazareth he doesn't stop there he says
[1:48:16] it's Christ the word that's where he put
[1:48:19] his name wherever the word is Manifest
[1:48:21] it's a manifestation of the name of God
[1:48:24] where was the word is made manifest it's
[1:48:26] Christ it's Jesus Christ the word made
[1:48:28] flesh
[1:48:31] and there's where he plays his name and
[1:48:32] that's where he'll meet you
[1:48:34] that's why we have sometimes people who
[1:48:36] are trying to meet Jesus Christ in a
[1:48:39] previous age in a previous form in a
[1:48:41] previous way amen but he has a place
[1:48:43] today a meeting place where he put his
[1:48:46] name and that name is in Jesus Christ
[1:48:48] it's Christ the word and the word is
[1:48:50] present
[1:48:51] it's here it's been open it's revealed
[1:48:54] it's been delivered he's here
[1:49:00] now I'm going to read just one sentence
[1:49:03] quotes and all of these are out of 64
[1:49:05] and 65 and maybe 63.
[1:49:08] he said if you're married to Christ
[1:49:09] Christ is the word of God
[1:49:12] so if you're married to Christ
[1:49:13] you're married to the word
[1:49:18] and Christ is the word the anointed word
[1:49:20] made manifest
[1:49:22] you got that Christ is the word the
[1:49:24] anointed word may manifest
[1:49:26] and what are you married to the anointed
[1:49:28] word may manifest
[1:49:31] praise be to God
[1:49:33] Christ is the word and when we are in
[1:49:35] the word we're in Christ
[1:49:39] and how can I be in Christ denying
[1:49:41] Christ
[1:49:42] how can I be in Christ and deny this
[1:49:44] Revelation the prophet God Amen how can
[1:49:46] I deny the word if I'm in Christ amen
[1:49:48] but if I'm in if I'm in the word I'm in
[1:49:51] Christ
[1:49:52] he said you're born into the word for
[1:49:54] you're born into Christ Christ is the
[1:49:56] word yes sir each one in its age
[1:50:00] amen amen so what word do I have to be
[1:50:03] born into the word for my age
[1:50:07] he says and and with the age that we're
[1:50:10] living in
[1:50:11] when the word is interpreted God's
[1:50:13] speaking that word out and making the
[1:50:15] word for that age live giving the
[1:50:18] interpretation of it that it's God in
[1:50:20] Christ manifesting sin because Christ is
[1:50:23] the word and when the word is made
[1:50:25] manifest that is Christ in every age
[1:50:27] then
[1:50:29] so where is Christ he's the word made
[1:50:31] manifest
[1:50:32] for this age
[1:50:36] and if a man is born of the spirit of
[1:50:38] God he'll search the scriptures to see
[1:50:40] if it's the answer for today
[1:50:42] the answer of the day is Christ that
[1:50:45] should have been a good question what is
[1:50:47] the answer of the day the answer of the
[1:50:49] day is Christ what is Christ Christ is
[1:50:51] the anointed word for your day
[1:50:54] the answer of the day is Christ Christ
[1:50:55] is the word when the word comes to life
[1:50:58] it shows the light that's promised of
[1:51:00] the day
[1:51:01] see how brother Branham is never saying
[1:51:03] you can go previous and find Christ he's
[1:51:05] not ever saying that he's never saying
[1:51:07] you can go back up here and you can find
[1:51:09] him if you want to find him don't find
[1:51:11] him where he was find him where he is
[1:51:14] you're here now he's here now find him
[1:51:17] now
[1:51:20] when you begin to teach that people
[1:51:21] begin to accuse you of no longer
[1:51:23] preaching the cross how can you preach
[1:51:25] Christ and not preach the cross
[1:51:27] it's included today amen I don't have to
[1:51:30] go back to Luther's day to believe
[1:51:31] justification neither do I have to go
[1:51:33] back to Wesley's day to believe and say
[1:51:35] so I mean why how can you claim that if
[1:51:38] you need if you want to be saved in this
[1:51:40] day and you want to be saved from
[1:51:42] tribulation and go in the Rapture that
[1:51:44] you have to meet Christ for your day for
[1:51:46] that salvation
[1:51:47] and somebody says you're not preaching
[1:51:49] Calvary are you kidding I could never
[1:51:51] preach this without Calvary
[1:51:53] Calvary is what made it all possible
[1:51:55] without Calvary I can't say what I'm
[1:51:57] saying today
[1:51:59] Calvary is the foundation and then
[1:52:01] Calvary took place 2 000 years ago but
[1:52:04] reality Calvary took place in eternity
[1:52:06] in the mind of God Amen it's always been
[1:52:08] based on Calvary
[1:52:13] but you know I can preach Calvary and
[1:52:16] not Point people to Christ
[1:52:18] if I point them away from where he is
[1:52:21] now
[1:52:22] so it goes both ways
[1:52:27] if I reject Christ and I tell people
[1:52:30] don't go there that's false that's a lie
[1:52:34] and I say go here have I led them to
[1:52:37] Christ
[1:52:38] if the thing that I deny is the
[1:52:40] manifestation of Christ for our day I
[1:52:42] can point them to another manifestation
[1:52:44] and they'll find Christ
[1:52:46] I don't understand that
[1:52:48] he's here
[1:52:50] he's present he's in this day he's here
[1:52:53] in the end time the mighty Angel has
[1:52:55] come down
[1:53:01] he says if you've got the baptism of the
[1:53:04] Holy Ghost it can only point you to
[1:53:05] Christ and Christ is the word
[1:53:09] I like it I believe it
[1:53:12] and here he is today in his word
[1:53:14] manifesting the same thing he did there
[1:53:16] she can't recognize any other headship
[1:53:18] no sir there's no Bishop no nothing she
[1:53:21] recognizes one headship that's Christ
[1:53:23] and Christ is the word
[1:53:27] remember he says if you married to
[1:53:29] Christ Christ is the word
[1:53:33] he says and how will the Messiah the
[1:53:34] people that believe on him know it
[1:53:36] unless they're constantly in the word to
[1:53:37] know what he is Daniel said the wife
[1:53:39] shall know but the foolish the unwise
[1:53:41] wouldn't know they shall know their
[1:53:43] their God now now how he shall appear in
[1:53:46] the last days is to bring the people
[1:53:48] back to the word so that the bride will
[1:53:50] know her husband know her mate the
[1:53:53] revealed word that's why this has to
[1:53:56] happen
[1:53:57] if you want to be revealed to your mate
[1:54:02] you must be revealed to you must be
[1:54:05] um
[1:54:06] what am I saying when she wants to know
[1:54:09] her mate you want to know your mate you
[1:54:10] must be introduced to the revealed word
[1:54:13] because the revealed word is the mate of
[1:54:15] the end time bride
[1:54:19] you can see you can be you can be
[1:54:22] introducing somebody to an idea
[1:54:25] and that's not Christ
[1:54:27] you can be introducing people to a
[1:54:28] concept
[1:54:30] and it may not cry it can have the label
[1:54:31] of Jesus Christ but it may not be Jesus
[1:54:33] Christ because it's our concept of Jesus
[1:54:35] Christ
[1:54:37] but in order to introduce somebody to
[1:54:39] Jesus Christ I must introduce to them to
[1:54:41] the revealed word
[1:54:43] that's who the bride must be introduced
[1:54:45] that's who she must know that's who her
[1:54:48] mate is
[1:54:49] who's my mate my mate is Jesus Christ
[1:54:52] who's Jesus Christ the revealed word the
[1:54:54] end time revelation
[1:55:01] says in recognizing your day in this
[1:55:03] message now I'm going to say something
[1:55:05] National Force put Israel in her
[1:55:07] Homeland National Force will put the
[1:55:08] church and the World Council of churches
[1:55:10] but the power of God will put the people
[1:55:12] in The Bride
[1:55:14] the world forces this way and the world
[1:55:16] forces that way but God forces upward
[1:55:19] the spirit of God which is the word of
[1:55:21] God I want you to catch that the spirit
[1:55:24] of God which is the word of God
[1:55:26] don't separate these two things
[1:55:29] I want the spirit I want the spirit I
[1:55:31] want the spirit then get the word get
[1:55:33] the word get the word
[1:55:36] if we chase after the Spirit by denying
[1:55:38] the revealed word What Spirit are we
[1:55:40] going to get
[1:55:41] right but if we want more of the spirit
[1:55:42] we need more of the word if we want more
[1:55:44] of the power of God let's get more of
[1:55:46] the revelation of the hour
[1:55:53] amen the spirit of God which is the word
[1:55:56] of God my word is spirit and life will
[1:55:59] put the bride in her place
[1:56:02] so what will the spirit of God do it'll
[1:56:04] put the bride in her place what is the
[1:56:06] spirit of God the word of God he says
[1:56:08] the spirit of God which is the word of
[1:56:09] God which is my word of spirit and life
[1:56:12] will put the bride in her place because
[1:56:14] she'll recognize her position in the
[1:56:17] word then she's in Christ will put her
[1:56:19] in her place
[1:56:21] how's the bride going to get to her
[1:56:23] position it's going to be the revelation
[1:56:25] of Christ the revelation of the word
[1:56:26] that was in those seven Thunders that's
[1:56:28] in the mystery and the silence amen that
[1:56:31] Revelation is coming to a bride to put
[1:56:33] her in position
[1:56:35] what do you mean put in position where
[1:56:36] will I stand will it Lift Me Up what
[1:56:38] part what no put you in position is
[1:56:40] where you recognize who you are for your
[1:56:42] day you recognize by the Revelation you
[1:56:45] are the end time bride that spirit that
[1:56:47] comes with that word puts you in
[1:56:49] position you begin to act like an end
[1:56:51] time bride
[1:56:54] praise be to God
[1:56:57] she'll recognize her position in the
[1:56:59] word
[1:57:01] then she's in Christ
[1:57:03] will put her in her place
[1:57:06] says the church across the nation we're
[1:57:07] following Jesus Christ the word
[1:57:10] to be in the bride
[1:57:12] who wants to be in the bride
[1:57:16] to be in the bride you have to be
[1:57:18] remarried to the word of God which is
[1:57:20] Christ
[1:57:23] which means the old husband the old life
[1:57:25] has to be dead all the denominations all
[1:57:28] the Traditions all the false everything
[1:57:30] through the previous ages it all has to
[1:57:32] die it has to rot it has to be left
[1:57:35] behind amen you have to be a new
[1:57:37] creature
[1:57:39] you have to be remarried to the word of
[1:57:40] God to be in the bride I've said this
[1:57:42] before but I'll say it again what makes
[1:57:45] you and I bride
[1:57:47] there's so many times we I mean we say
[1:57:49] we're bride we're bride we're bride this
[1:57:51] is another one of those terms you know
[1:57:52] we use terms over and over again we're
[1:57:54] in the bride this is a bride Church a
[1:57:55] bride's message a bride this and that
[1:57:57] but when it comes down to it what makes
[1:57:59] you brine and the reality of what makes
[1:58:01] you and I bride is the bridegroom
[1:58:03] without the bridegroom you and I are not
[1:58:06] bride
[1:58:07] so what is the main effect I mean what
[1:58:10] is the main cause of you being brought
[1:58:11] is the bridegroom amen the presence of
[1:58:14] the bridegroom when you amen have
[1:58:16] received that invitation to be United
[1:58:17] with him your bride amen that's what
[1:58:19] makes you bright you can't self-declare
[1:58:22] bride no woman in the world can
[1:58:23] self-declare herself bride
[1:58:25] what makes her a bride is because she
[1:58:27] has a bridegroom because she has a
[1:58:29] bridegroom she's now a bride if I want
[1:58:31] to be bride I need a bridegroom
[1:58:34] and who's my bridegroom the revealed
[1:58:37] word my mate
[1:58:39] so I had to be United with one the
[1:58:41] revealed word for this day to be part of
[1:58:44] the end time bride
[1:58:50] I can't say I'm bride saying bride
[1:58:52] doesn't make me bride
[1:58:54] I said I want to be a bride
[1:58:56] I mean there's a lot of young women that
[1:58:58] walk around and want to be a bride but
[1:59:00] that doesn't make them a bride they need
[1:59:02] some man
[1:59:04] to make them a bride
[1:59:06] and no matter how much the church wants
[1:59:08] to be bride it takes some man to make
[1:59:11] you bright and that man is Christ Jesus
[1:59:13] the revealed word for today
[1:59:16] which is the third pool which is the
[1:59:19] seventh seal
[1:59:20] which is the mystery of God revealed
[1:59:26] now this is the final part I keep
[1:59:29] looking at 9 11. and it just does my
[1:59:32] heart good every time
[1:59:34] and then it changes again somebody's
[1:59:36] going to have to fix this for me so I
[1:59:37] don't
[1:59:38] get lost
[1:59:41] because next month is going to be 10
[1:59:43] something
[1:59:44] and I'm going to think I just got
[1:59:45] started 10 30.
[1:59:47] this is the beginning
[1:59:51] all right
[1:59:52] now
[1:59:54] now we know
[1:59:58] we know what the message is according
[2:00:00] what the prophet told us and I say what
[2:00:02] I wrote down is not static it's Dynamic
[2:00:05] it means that and it compasses so many
[2:00:07] other terms
[2:00:09] we know how the Elijah of Malachi 4 will
[2:00:13] turn the hearts of the children
[2:00:16] I want to look at another question now
[2:00:18] if I could write this
[2:00:30] what does
[2:00:32] the bride
[2:00:37] feed on
[2:00:43] so we're going to look at what the
[2:00:44] prophet says let's go to John chapter 6
[2:00:47] and we'll begin
[2:00:48] with what Jesus says
[2:00:57] John chapter 6.
[2:01:02] verse 32.
[2:01:07] in John chapter 6 verse 32
[2:01:09] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[2:01:12] I say unto you Moses gave you not that
[2:01:14] bread from heaven but my father giveth
[2:01:17] you the true bread from heaven
[2:01:20] he's typing this with manna that fell
[2:01:22] now he's showing himself the true bread
[2:01:25] from heaven for the bread of God is he
[2:01:28] which cometh down from heaven and giveth
[2:01:31] his life into the world then said they
[2:01:33] unto him Lord Evermore give us this
[2:01:35] bread
[2:01:36] and Jesus said unto them I am the bread
[2:01:39] of life he that cometh to me shall never
[2:01:41] hunger and he that believeth on me shall
[2:01:44] never thirst
[2:01:46] let's go down to verse 41.
[2:01:51] the Jews then
[2:01:56] yeah
[2:01:58] the Jews then murmured at him because he
[2:02:01] said I am the bread which came down from
[2:02:04] heaven so now they didn't like that now
[2:02:06] let's go to verse 53.
[2:02:09] then said Jesus unto them verily verily
[2:02:12] I say unto you except you eat the Flesh
[2:02:15] of the son of man and drink his blood
[2:02:17] you have no life in you
[2:02:19] whoso eateth My Flesh and drinketh my
[2:02:22] blood has eternal life and I will raise
[2:02:24] him up at the last day for my flesh is
[2:02:27] meat and deed and my blood is drink
[2:02:28] indeed he that eateth my flesh and
[2:02:31] drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I
[2:02:34] in him
[2:02:35] as the living father hath sent me and I
[2:02:37] live by the father so he that eateth me
[2:02:39] even he shall live by me this is that
[2:02:42] bread which came down from heaven not as
[2:02:44] your fathers did eat mana and are dead
[2:02:45] he that eateth this bread shall live
[2:02:48] forever
[2:02:50] so what are we supposed to eat we are
[2:02:52] supposed to eat Jesus Christ
[2:02:55] he says You Eat My Flesh and drink my
[2:02:58] blood my flesh is meat that's food
[2:03:01] indeed and my blood is drink indeed and
[2:03:05] if you eat my flesh and drink my blood
[2:03:08] you have everlasting life
[2:03:13] so what does the what does the bride
[2:03:16] feed on she feeds on the body and blood
[2:03:20] of the Lord
[2:03:23] so when we take communion communion is
[2:03:26] symbolic and it's a reference back a
[2:03:28] remembrance to what Christ did for us
[2:03:30] when he paid the price of redemption at
[2:03:31] Calvary
[2:03:33] amen and those elements are not the
[2:03:35] literal elements of his body and of his
[2:03:37] blood but the representation of the body
[2:03:40] which was given for us and the blood
[2:03:41] which given for us and we know that the
[2:03:43] body was the word made flesh so the body
[2:03:46] was the manifested word
[2:03:49] the body that was broken for us it was a
[2:03:51] word made flesh and the blood that was
[2:03:53] shed for us we realized the blood
[2:03:54] symbolizes the life because the life of
[2:03:57] everything is in the blood amen so what
[2:03:59] we have now and when we eat his flesh
[2:04:01] and drink his blood we have the word
[2:04:05] made flesh
[2:04:08] and the life of that word the life of
[2:04:11] God together
[2:04:13] and it said unless you eat this and
[2:04:16] drink this you have no life in you
[2:04:19] let's look at uh
[2:04:23] I'm just going to reference to you this
[2:04:25] in in Mark chapter 14 that the Last
[2:04:27] Supper Jesus says As they did eat Jesus
[2:04:29] Took bread and blessed and break it and
[2:04:30] gave it to them and said take eat this
[2:04:32] is my body and he took the cup when he
[2:04:34] had given thanks he gave it to them and
[2:04:36] they all drank of it and he said unto
[2:04:38] them this is my blood of of the new new
[2:04:40] testament which is shed for many now
[2:04:43] he's telling them once again eat my this
[2:04:47] is my body which is given for you that
[2:04:49] bread is not it it's a symbol it's
[2:04:51] symbolizing that you have to feed on
[2:04:53] Christ you have to drink from Christ you
[2:04:56] have to feed on the word made flesh and
[2:04:58] you have to drink from the life
[2:05:01] here's what here's what brother Branham
[2:05:03] says now this is Anointed ones at the
[2:05:06] end time 1965.
[2:05:09] he says you couldn't feed Methodist
[2:05:12] Lutheran message oh no he didn't want
[2:05:14] that to carry him it's rotten why
[2:05:16] because the because the message cannot
[2:05:19] be carried over from a previous day
[2:05:21] remember we went through this principle
[2:05:23] it cannot be a carryover amen that gets
[2:05:25] maggots in it it gets worms and the Mana
[2:05:28] that fell fresh that morning amen
[2:05:30] there's new Mana that has to fall the
[2:05:31] next morning the Passover Lamb that you
[2:05:33] feasted on couldn't be carried to the
[2:05:35] next day had to be consumed amen so
[2:05:37] there has to be a fresh message every
[2:05:39] day
[2:05:41] so this is why he says you cannot feed
[2:05:43] the you could not feed the Methodist the
[2:05:46] Lutheran message you can't feed them
[2:05:48] that they have to have a fresh message
[2:05:49] for themselves
[2:05:54] why because by the time it carried over
[2:05:56] brother when I said it had wiggle tails
[2:05:58] in it
[2:05:59] what's that the ideas of man mingled in
[2:06:04] corruption had come in
[2:06:06] he said you couldn't feed Methodist
[2:06:07] Lutheran message oh no he didn't want
[2:06:09] that carry and it's rotten the life had
[2:06:11] done left and it went into something
[2:06:12] else that's the old stock that's dead
[2:06:14] back there the life was moving on
[2:06:16] neither can you feed the bride of Christ
[2:06:18] Pentecostalism
[2:06:20] no indeedy maggot blowed organizations
[2:06:23] nothing doing no no
[2:06:26] just as much as you could not feed a
[2:06:29] Wesleyan a Luther message you could not
[2:06:31] feed a Pentecostal a Wesley a message
[2:06:33] you cannot feed the bride the
[2:06:35] Pentecostal message
[2:06:37] you cannot feed them the laodicean
[2:06:39] message the Pentecostal message you
[2:06:41] cannot feed him that was the restoration
[2:06:44] of the gifts that message was good for
[2:06:46] its time but it will not carry over this
[2:06:49] is beyond that the prophet said
[2:06:52] so we can't just replicate and re-teach
[2:06:54] the same thing
[2:06:57] same quote you're an annoying ones at
[2:07:00] the end time
[2:07:01] you cannot feed
[2:07:03] the Bride of Jesus Christ Pentecostalism
[2:07:05] so for the promise is and before that
[2:07:08] great and terrible day shall come I'll
[2:07:11] send unto you Elijah the prophet he will
[2:07:13] restore the hearts of the children back
[2:07:14] to the faith of the fathers again all
[2:07:17] these promises had been made in the
[2:07:18] Bible I will do it and there the Eagles
[2:07:21] will gather all that the father hath
[2:07:23] given me will come to me where will the
[2:07:25] Eagles gather the Eagles will gather
[2:07:28] over the fresh kill of the word brother
[2:07:30] Benham said where the word the Manna is
[2:07:33] fresh freshly killed for this day it
[2:07:35] doesn't have magnets it doesn't have
[2:07:37] flies it doesn't have wiggle tails in it
[2:07:39] and where it's flesh it has the Flesh
[2:07:41] Blood
[2:07:43] because it's freshly killed
[2:07:47] again anointing ones he says it's not a
[2:07:49] man it's gone the angel was not the son
[2:07:52] of man he was the messenger from the son
[2:07:53] of man the son of man is Christ he's the
[2:07:56] one that you're feeding on
[2:07:58] you're not feeding on a man a man his
[2:08:00] words will fail but you're feeding on
[2:08:02] the unfailing body word of the son of
[2:08:05] man what are you supposed to feed on
[2:08:07] Jesus Christ the son of man that's what
[2:08:10] this message is
[2:08:12] the Revelation amen the real message
[2:08:15] that the messenger came to declare what
[2:08:17] is it it's the body word of the son of
[2:08:19] man just as much as Jesus in his day
[2:08:21] said unless you eat my flesh and drink
[2:08:23] my blood brother branham's come to the
[2:08:25] same point he says you better be eating
[2:08:27] the son of man and you can be just as
[2:08:29] confused in the carnal as they were that
[2:08:31] day how do I eat this man and drink his
[2:08:33] blood he's not talking natural he's
[2:08:35] talking spiritual
[2:08:37] and now brother Branham says you're not
[2:08:39] feeding on the words of a man
[2:08:41] because the bride has to feed on
[2:08:43] something and she can't feed on the
[2:08:45] previous message
[2:08:48] so what's she feeding on she's feeding
[2:08:51] on the body word
[2:08:52] of the son of man
[2:09:00] I say we better feed
[2:09:02] right here
[2:09:05] and the message the seat is not air with
[2:09:07] the shock
[2:09:09] neither will a Christian eat on that
[2:09:11] dead akarians from old denominational
[2:09:13] doctrines and things they want the word
[2:09:16] of God fresh the promise of the hour God
[2:09:19] promised rabbits in the days of Luther
[2:09:21] he promised other things in the days of
[2:09:23] others but now he promised us a full
[2:09:26] Square meal the full seven course menu
[2:09:31] for all the Seven Seals are open and
[2:09:33] everything is ready for the word of God
[2:09:35] to those who can receive it
[2:09:38] what are we supposed to feed the bride
[2:09:40] not previous aged message
[2:09:44] we're supposed to feed the bride the
[2:09:46] seven course meal
[2:09:48] the opening of The Seven Seals the
[2:09:50] sounding of the seven Thunders the
[2:09:51] revealing of the son of man amen that's
[2:09:54] why Brother people come and say Christ
[2:09:55] is the mystery of God revealed why
[2:09:58] because under the voice of the seventh
[2:09:59] angel the mystery of God should be
[2:10:01] finished which is what declaring Christ
[2:10:05] what is those seals those SEALS or
[2:10:07] Christ what is the revealing of the
[2:10:09] seals revealing Christ
[2:10:12] he is the seals that was revealed if I
[2:10:15] want to feed on the body word of the son
[2:10:17] of man I better feed on this revelation
[2:10:20] of this message and if I want to feed
[2:10:22] God sheep sheep food I better be feeding
[2:10:25] them this message
[2:10:28] not what he started out with
[2:10:30] not the healings
[2:10:32] but when he began to declare his message
[2:10:35] when Malachi 4 amen was fulfilled in
[2:10:39] Revelation 10 1-7
[2:10:42] declaring the silence that was in
[2:10:44] Revelations 8 1.
[2:10:46] that's the food
[2:10:48] we need to feed on
[2:10:53] brother Benham said if you haven't fed
[2:10:55] fully on this word to Fly Above these
[2:10:57] denominations
[2:10:59] I invite you to do so now
[2:11:02] well it'll give us the strength to
[2:11:03] spread our wings and fly away from every
[2:11:06] other voice and every other thing it'll
[2:11:09] be the strength that we get from feeding
[2:11:12] on this Christ
[2:11:15] amen
[2:11:17] so what do we what does the bride feed
[2:11:20] on
[2:11:27] Christ
[2:11:32] and I can take one of brother branham's
[2:11:34] definitions
[2:11:36] straight from the quote I believe
[2:11:51] what is the bride feed on she feeds on
[2:11:53] Christ
[2:11:54] and brother Brandon said Christ is the
[2:11:56] anointed word for the day
[2:12:00] now let's go back to the beginning
[2:12:03] and I'll give you the rest of my title
[2:12:09] the bride's Revival is
[2:12:11] you could write many things and be
[2:12:14] absolutely correct
[2:12:16] but to me the bride's Revival is
[2:12:26] that's my Revival
[2:12:29] the bride's Revival is Christ
[2:12:33] is the seals that was revealed what is
[2:12:36] the revealing of the seals it's the
[2:12:37] revealing of Christ
[2:12:39] what is the manna that came down from
[2:12:41] heaven Christ what is the body word of
[2:12:43] the son of man Christ what what was the
[2:12:45] mystery contained under those seals of
[2:12:46] Christ what is the mystery of God Christ
[2:12:50] what is the Bible Christ
[2:12:54] what is the bride's Revival Christ if we
[2:12:58] want to have a Revival we don't need to
[2:13:00] go back anywhere else to previous
[2:13:01] Revival if we want a Revival let's keep
[2:13:04] moving towards Christ
[2:13:06] that brings the Awakening of the Bride
[2:13:08] that brings her into position that gives
[2:13:10] her food to Fly Above these
[2:13:12] denominations that gives her strength to
[2:13:14] take a Rapture she's not taking a
[2:13:16] Rapture listen if a previous message
[2:13:18] would have brought a rapture we don't
[2:13:20] need this message
[2:13:22] if previous teaching would bring us
[2:13:24] really a Spirit-filled life then we
[2:13:25] don't need the previous teaching we
[2:13:27] don't need this teaching because what we
[2:13:28] need is a Spirit-filled life
[2:13:31] but none of that teaching was good
[2:13:33] enough to produce what's needed to be
[2:13:35] the end time bride
[2:13:36] so God would bring an end-time message
[2:13:39] when what's been sealed will be unsealed
[2:13:41] so that we have something to feed on
[2:13:43] that will take us higher and higher and
[2:13:45] higher until it takes us to the change
[2:13:47] of our bodies
[2:13:49] this is what we should be feeding on
[2:13:53] not maggot infested
[2:13:56] previous message that's meant to be left
[2:13:59] in that day
[2:14:01] we need to feed on the fresh kill of the
[2:14:04] word where the word is fresh and it has
[2:14:07] the blood in it
[2:14:11] I'm going to read one last quote
[2:14:15] and uniting time and sign
[2:14:17] there is a uniting time and that's on
[2:14:19] right now
[2:14:20] what is she uniting for
[2:14:22] the rapture
[2:14:25] non-ecumenicism
[2:14:27] the rapture
[2:14:29] God's getting her ready yes sir uniting
[2:14:31] what is she uniting with
[2:14:33] with the word
[2:14:35] you got that
[2:14:36] what is uniting for the Rapture what's
[2:14:39] uniting with the word
[2:14:44] for all heavens and earth will pass away
[2:14:46] but my word shall never pass away
[2:14:49] she's uniting herself with thus saith
[2:14:51] the Lord regardless of what any
[2:14:53] denomination or anybody else says she's
[2:14:55] uniting herself she's getting ready why
[2:14:57] she is the bride that's right and she's
[2:15:00] uniting herself with her bridegroom see
[2:15:02] and the bridegroom is the word
[2:15:07] don't let anybody steer you in another
[2:15:09] direction if you want to unite with the
[2:15:11] bridegroom the bridegroom is the word
[2:15:12] what word the anointed manifested word
[2:15:15] for your day that which was brought to
[2:15:17] us by an end time Prophet amen that was
[2:15:19] revealed that mystery that had been
[2:15:21] laying the mystery of redemption have
[2:15:23] been laying in those seven Thunders
[2:15:26] when Christ come the mighty Angel he
[2:15:29] come to bring the word back
[2:15:32] and make it available to the bride
[2:15:34] and that's what we're feeding on
[2:15:37] that's what will take us in a Rapture
[2:15:39] because it'll take a revelation
[2:15:41] what revelation
[2:15:43] the revelation of what happened long ago
[2:15:45] know the revelation of who you really
[2:15:48] are
[2:15:49] and that's a revelation that was laying
[2:15:52] in the seventh seal in this mystery of
[2:15:54] God
[2:15:55] amen let's all stand musicians if you'll
[2:15:57] come
[2:15:58] I appreciate you being patient with me
[2:16:01] letting me get all of that out
[2:16:05] you know I said the bride's Revival is
[2:16:08] Christ
[2:16:09] I can also say this message is Christ
[2:16:12] that's true
[2:16:14] I can also say the message is the
[2:16:17] revealing of the Mysteries the opening
[2:16:20] of the seals the opening the third the
[2:16:21] third pool yes the opening the word
[2:16:23] that's it true
[2:16:24] but I could also say the message is
[2:16:28] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[2:16:31] the message is the unveiling of God
[2:16:34] the message is the Mighty God unveiled
[2:16:37] the message is the choosing of the Bride
[2:16:38] the message is the invisible Union of
[2:16:40] the bride of Christ the message is uh
[2:16:43] the uniting signs and times the message
[2:16:45] is the rising of the Sun the message is
[2:16:47] the rapture
[2:16:48] all of these things are the message
[2:16:52] amen and that's what we've been given in
[2:16:54] this day that's what we're feeding on
[2:16:56] that's what we're leaving everything
[2:16:58] else and pressing into and it's taking
[2:17:00] us Higher and Higher and the bride goes
[2:17:02] up word by word
[2:17:08] let's bow our heads and pray
[2:17:10] dear heavenly father we thank you for
[2:17:12] this day
[2:17:13] and oh God so many of these things Lord
[2:17:16] we're bringing back to the memories to
[2:17:18] the remembrance of your bride
[2:17:20] because they've been established in
[2:17:22] present truth
[2:17:23] but oh how we love this word Lord how we
[2:17:26] love you our bridegroom we we love to
[2:17:29] make love to you we love to talk about
[2:17:30] you we love to feed on you we love to
[2:17:33] receive from you
[2:17:36] because your spirit and your word your
[2:17:37] Prophet told us are the same
[2:17:40] your spirit is here to make the word
