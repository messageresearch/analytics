[0:00] this will just apply to the ministering
[0:02] Brothers nobody else this will apply
[0:05] to Brothers if we ever set foot behind
[0:08] this pull pit with the intentions of
[0:10] exposing another
[0:12] Minister we're a Pharisee amen and we're
[0:15] on our way out
[0:20] amen I wish I could tell you that I've
[0:22] never done that amen but I
[0:27] have Amen in righteous inding Nation
[0:31] with the word of God and with
[0:34] quotes and in what I said I was
[0:37] right but the way I said it was
[0:40] wrong you say well we never know we
[0:42] never picked up on it it doesn't matter
[0:44] whether you did or whether you didn't I
[0:45] know
[0:50] here remember Saints the standard has
[0:53] been
[0:55] adjusted the standard has been
[0:58] adjusted the truth Tru has been revealed
[1:01] as we would stand
[1:02] together only the truth can set us free
[1:05] but the truth can't set us
[1:07] free if we won't let it if we'll slam
[1:10] the door in its face and we say that
[1:12] don't apply to me or we whitewash a
[1:15] situation that we
[1:18] did I believe in my heart of hearts
[1:21] there's nobody in this building who's
[1:22] wanting to go out and live in sin and
[1:24] wanting to go out and live in dirt and
[1:25] smut and those things I believe
[1:28] that but remember remember that's not
[1:30] the level we're called to
[1:32] saints that is not the level we're
[1:34] called to we are called to be the very
[1:37] image of Jesus Christ on this
[1:41] Earth and that is going to require us to
[1:45] get real with God get real with
[1:48] ourselves first and realize that we've
[1:50] got some problems and that we are not
[1:53] okay even thinking you're okay is a
[1:56] problem because that is the
[1:58] problem
[2:03] we are going to have to a come to a real
[2:07] honest conference with ourselves and
[2:09] with
[2:11] God and search our lives and
[2:14] see as as the song says see if there be
[2:18] any wicked way in
[2:21] me and if there is reveal that to me
[2:26] that I can repent of that God forbid any
[2:30] of us would walk out of these doors and
[2:31] find ourselves in that leoan condition
[2:35] wretched blind naked that's bad but
[2:39] that's not the worst the worst is
[2:40] knoweth it
[2:43] not we have a
[2:46] word to
[2:49] know we have a word that can reveal to
[2:52] where we can truly know if we're right
[2:55] or
[2:55] not don't forsake it yes Lord don't
[3:00] cover stuff
[3:02] up be real with God be real with
[3:06] yourself
