[11:25] sincere life's prayer that we will come
[11:29] out okay on the other end let's just
[11:31] pray
[11:33] together precious Lord Jesus
[11:36] we're thankful once again Lord to
[11:40] be gathered here father as your
[11:42] scriptures have commanded
[11:44] us Lord and as we so often pray
[11:49] but we would never want it to become
[11:52] common to us father we are so grateful
[11:55] that we can come here and gather as a
[11:57] people and and not just be a social
[12:00] event
[12:01] Lord we're not gathered here around a
[12:05] man's
[12:07] idea father we're gathered here around a
[12:12] person the person of the word the
[12:16] revealed word the Lord Jesus Christ
[12:20] himself Lord and we're ever so grateful
[12:22] that you have saw fit to come by our way
[12:26] in these closing moments of time and to
[12:29] open our eyes and to open our ears and
[12:31] to reveal yourself to us
[12:35] father Lord as the world is in darkness
[12:39] and gross Darkness on the people you've
[12:42] shed your love on a select group
[12:45] Lord that we don't have to stumble
[12:48] around in darkness and error and our own
[12:51] ideas but you have sent a clear and
[12:54] Guiding Light to us Lord we just worship
[12:57] you for that this evening father that's
[13:00] why we're here we're here to be edified
[13:03] yes we're here to be perfected yes but
[13:05] we're here to worship you father more
[13:07] than anything and to offer thanksgivings
[13:11] for what you've done for us we would
[13:13] just ask now that as we would come to
[13:15] this part of the service that you would
[13:18] come Lord as you've so Faithfully done
[13:20] in the past and that you would just pick
[13:23] up this book and that you would feed
[13:25] your sheep Father for I stand here as a
[13:28] Mir mortal very con conscience of my
[13:32] shortcomings and my lack of ability to
[13:35] do what is tasked with being done this
[13:37] evening father but we all know and agree
[13:40] that there is one here that can do what
[13:42] needs to be done and we just submit
[13:44] ourselves to you both speaker and hearer
[13:47] for you to accomplish that which you've
[13:49] purposed this service for in the name of
[13:52] the Lord Jesus Christ we would pray
[13:56] amen God bless you Saints so good to be
[13:59] with you this evening we trust you've
[14:01] each and everyone had a wonderful
[14:04] Christmas day and time with your friends
[14:07] and loved ones and family we just ask
[14:10] that you would take your Bible and turn
[14:12] to John chap 13 with
[14:15] me I'd like to just
[14:18] continue with this thought that I
[14:21] presented last time of things that were
[14:25] and I don't intend to be lengthy this
[14:27] evening I just want to do a real quick
[14:29] review from the uh past service and then
[14:32] there was just a few loose ends I would
[14:34] like to tie up on this topic now I said
[14:38] that's what I intend now what happens is
[14:41] what happens but that's my intention so
[14:45] at least I have good
[14:51] intentions John
[14:54] 13 beginning in verse
[14:57] one says now before the Feast of the
[15:00] Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
[15:02] was come that he should depart out of
[15:05] this world unto the father having loved
[15:08] his own which were in the world he loved
[15:10] them until the end and supper being
[15:13] ended the devil having now put into the
[15:15] heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to
[15:17] betray him Jesus knowing that the father
[15:21] had given all things into his hands and
[15:23] that he was come from God and went to
[15:26] God he riseth from suffering laid aside
[15:29] his garments and took a c a towel and
[15:32] GED
[15:33] himself God bless you as you would have
[15:36] your seats and this is obviously the
[15:39] scripture that we're springboarding off
[15:42] of this Revelation that John records in
[15:45] the scripture that Jesus had is
[15:49] Paramount and extremely important and it
[15:52] put into
[15:54] action
[15:56] all the the culmination of Jesus's
[15:59] Ministry and the culmination of his
[16:01] purpose for being here on Earth uh to go
[16:04] to the cross and then to resurrect from
[16:06] death but this Revelation is the
[16:09] Revelation that was immediately
[16:11] preceding what put that into action and
[16:15] we know from here that Jud uh Jesus
[16:17] turns to Judas based on this Revelation
[16:20] that he has that he come from God and
[16:22] he's going to God he turns to Judas and
[16:25] tells him what thou doest do quickly so
[16:29] this was an overcoming Revelation this
[16:31] was not just a uh minor Revelation this
[16:34] was a major Revelation and this was an A
[16:38] lifechanging and an overcoming
[16:40] Revelation that it could literally
[16:43] overcome death itself and the suffering
[16:46] of the Cross and this is what Jesus had
[16:50] when he
[16:52] recognized that his hour was come that I
[16:55] must leave this world to depart to my
[16:56] fathers to my father and we know that
[16:59] these patterns lay in the scripture and
[17:01] we know that if this was the pattern for
[17:03] Christ this is going to be the pattern
[17:04] for his bride so when we as the Bride of
[17:08] Jesus Christ come to these closing
[17:09] moments of time to where we recognize
[17:13] that there is an hour
[17:15] here and the time is upon us that we are
[17:19] to leave this Dimension that we are to
[17:21] depart from this Dimension and we are to
[17:24] go back to the father in the fullness of
[17:26] that then it's extremely important that
[17:30] we have the same Revelation that Jesus
[17:32] Christ
[17:33] had Matthew 17:10 says and his disciples
[17:36] asked him saying why then say the
[17:39] scribes that Elias must first come and
[17:41] Jesus answered and said unto them Elias
[17:44] truly shall first come and restore all
[17:48] things but I say unto you that Elias is
[17:50] come already and they knew him not but
[17:53] have done unto him whatsoever they
[17:55] listed likewise shall also the son of
[17:57] man suffer of them so we know here that
[18:00] the disciples are approaching Jesus and
[18:02] they're starting to pick up on things
[18:04] and starting to recognize him for who he
[18:06] is and they pose the question if you are
[18:09] him and this is what's transpiring why
[18:11] do the scribes keep saying that Elias
[18:14] first has to come so Jesus brings
[18:16] Clarity to them reveals to them the
[18:18] ministry of John the Baptist but Jesus
[18:20] here himself when he's speaking of the
[18:23] Malachi 4 Ministry before the great and
[18:25] Dreadful day of the Lord he says elas
[18:28] truly shall first come and he
[18:32] attaches a revelation and a purpose to
[18:36] that Ministry so he truly shall first
[18:39] come before the great and Dreadful day
[18:41] of the Lord to restore all
[18:45] things so there were loose ends that had
[18:48] to be tied up yes there were uh there
[18:51] was a first pole that had to go forward
[18:53] yes there was a second pull yes but the
[18:55] purpose of that per Jesus was so that
[18:57] this
[18:59] Revelation that he could come and
[19:01] restore all things and this all things
[19:04] was the
[19:05] revelation of who we were before we were
[19:08] here where we were before we were here
[19:11] this was the same Revelation that Jesus
[19:13] portrayed that he knew that he came from
[19:16] God and went to God 1953 brother random
[19:20] says now the first man now he made the
[19:22] first man in His image and we are
[19:24] returning back to that image that's
[19:26] right to our first created image when
[19:30] God created me William brandham I was
[19:32] before the foundation of the world he
[19:35] made my being my spirit I wasn't
[19:38] conscience of anything as far as I know
[19:40] of but I was there oh I don't believe
[19:44] you're getting it but Jesus told the
[19:46] disciples that he knew them before the
[19:48] foundation of the world and Paul said
[19:50] here that he chose us in him before the
[19:53] world begin now there was some part of
[19:55] me Orman Neville and the rest of you you
[19:58] all here that's in Christ Jesus before
[20:01] the world ever began and here's to my
[20:05] analysis of that I think that the people
[20:07] today that are possessed with this
[20:09] Spirit a part of these Angelic beings
[20:13] Spirits which rotated off of God that
[20:16] never fell in the beginning and resisted
[20:19] the devil's lie in heaven and we
[20:21] obviously spent a lot of time on that
[20:23] last time so I'm just going to continue
[20:25] but I just wanted to refresh that to
[20:27] your memory
[20:29] 1957 questions and answers on Hebrews
[20:32] brother brandom says now when he the
[20:34] logos went out of God which was God
[20:38] coming from this one big Fountain into a
[20:42] body in the form of a man and it made
[20:45] the logos which we call theophany now if
[20:49] you take the theophany when you're
[20:51] looking at that that's a man now that's
[20:55] where we were in the beginning amen
[20:58] now you do not understand it now but you
[21:01] was back there in the beginning that way
[21:05] when God made Man In His Image he made
[21:07] him a theophany now there you are that's
[21:12] the way we are here we come from a
[21:15] higher being in the beginning we were in
[21:18] the image of God the veil and the
[21:21] Darkness keeps us from knowing it now
[21:24] but Jesus told his disciples that he was
[21:27] with them before the foundation of the
[21:29] world see we
[21:32] were you can't know it now but you was
[21:36] in the beginning I say praise God even
[21:39] if I can't know it now even if I don't
[21:41] have a perfect revelation of that now
[21:43] I'm taking his word for it that I was in
[21:47] the beginning and if this he starts
[21:49] quoting scripture and if this Earthly
[21:52] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[21:55] already waiting Hallelujah and then we
[21:58] move into this theophany what we once
[22:01] lived so we can eat and we can shake
[22:04] hands and I just want to remind you as
[22:07] I'm reading a few more of these uh as we
[22:10] quickly review here my goal here is not
[22:14] to teach
[22:16] terminology because just in that one
[22:19] quote that we read brother brandom
[22:21] referenc her several things he'll say an
[22:23] Angelic Spirit um he would say a
[22:26] theophany he would say a uh uh uh spirit
[22:30] that didn't fall in the beginning he
[22:32] would say some part of you so there's
[22:36] different terminology that he's using
[22:38] here and there's different terminology
[22:40] that he'll use all the way up to the end
[22:42] of his ministry we know that he uh
[22:45] addresses this topic and who is this MDC
[22:48] very clearly uh we're not going to
[22:50] probably make it that far tonight but we
[22:52] know along through his ministry he would
[22:54] use different terminology but that's not
[22:58] what I'm here to teach on tonight there
[23:00] are people much more qualified for that
[23:02] there are people that have spent years
[23:04] studying that out we've heard teaching
[23:07] on that and preaching on that over the
[23:09] years um and I'm not saying that that's
[23:11] not important and that's not good I'm
[23:13] all for that I stand in support in
[23:15] support of that but I know that there is
[23:18] a
[23:19] tendency uh to Veer towards an
[23:21] intellectual conception at times and
[23:24] miss a
[23:25] principle so I'm not here to emphasize
[23:28] terminology to teach a terminology or an
[23:31] English class what I'm here to do is to
[23:34] emphasize how important this principle
[23:37] is because from 47 to 65 he uses a lot
[23:40] of terminology for this same topic but
[23:43] the principle never
[23:45] changes never changes One spec the
[23:49] principle is sound it is pure it is true
[23:52] and it never
[23:56] wavers God will see fit to Enlighten the
[23:59] terminology to us if he sees fit to do
[24:02] that but he's already done enough with
[24:06] the principle that I think we would be
[24:09] silly to stick our head in the sand and
[24:12] not believe it and not look at it and
[24:15] not accept it for what it is just
[24:17] because he'll use one word here and a
[24:20] different word here catch the principle
[24:23] and allow them to blend together the
[24:26] principle does not change and like I've
[24:28] said uh before at the end of the day if
[24:31] I just come back and say some part of me
[24:36] was with God in the beginning if that is
[24:39] the the bare minimum that I can muster
[24:42] up to have a revelation of I'm good I'm
[24:45] fine with that now I believe we have
[24:47] more Lane here to expound upon that but
[24:49] at the end of the day I am not here with
[24:51] an agenda I'm not here to make you see
[24:53] it from this way or this way or from
[24:55] this word what I'm here today is when
[24:57] when you get up and walk out of here at
[24:59] a bare minimum you can say the prophet
[25:02] the Vindicated prophet of God not me the
[25:05] Vindicated prophet of God clearly taught
[25:07] that there was some part of
[25:10] me in God in the
[25:13] beginning and I would never let I would
[25:16] never let Satan steal your joy from that
[25:18] Saints when you get confused on
[25:20] terminology or when you see how don't
[25:23] see how this can add to this ju don't
[25:25] let him take your joy away from that
[25:27] Saints rejoice in that stick to
[25:30] that don't allow education to steal that
[25:33] away from you or frustration of not
[25:35] being able to line everything up just
[25:38] accept the principle remember the Tree
[25:40] of Life brother random taught us the
[25:42] tree of life was spiritual
[25:47] principles spiritual principles that the
[25:49] tree of life was not a tree of
[25:51] terminology the tree of life was made up
[25:54] of spiritual
[25:56] principles hallelujah praise the Lord he
[25:59] says in 1960 of the unfailing realities
[26:02] of the Living God if a man is hungering
[26:04] for God you tell him say the Apostles
[26:07] Creed join the church put your name on
[26:09] here be sprinkled or immersed or
[26:11] whatever you want to that will never
[26:13] satisfy a hungry Soul see cuz they were
[26:16] predestinated of God to search for life
[26:19] they were once Angels who did not fall
[26:22] 2third of the angels of heaven fell
[26:25] that's these evil spirits working
[26:27] amongst people very religious you know
[26:30] the Bible says that you was just not
[26:33] always right here you were once
[26:36] somewhere
[26:38] else 1960 the uncertain sound and they
[26:42] just found out recently that your body
[26:44] is full of light x-ray proves that he
[26:47] says and that's Cosmic light that's in
[26:50] you that you're made up of full of light
[26:52] cells now that's Cosmic light but God is
[26:56] a different light but yet he's light now
[26:59] I think that that picture there is a
[27:01] great proof of what I'm fixing to say
[27:03] that God is light and when we were
[27:07] walking in light of God as sons of God
[27:12] God is Not Cosmic light but God's light
[27:16] operated through the cosmic light of our
[27:19] bodies
[27:20] ourselves we were absolutely at one time
[27:24] real genuine sons of God
[27:28] amen full disclaimer I don't understand
[27:31] that you will know the day that I fully
[27:34] understand that I assure you because
[27:36] you'll hear me
[27:37] screaming but I don't fully comprehend
[27:40] that I don't fully understand that but
[27:42] as I said before we know that brother
[27:44] brandham taught us the principle that
[27:46] God's thoughts are real God's thoughts
[27:47] are Eternal they're not like man's
[27:50] thoughts right that's right so when when
[27:54] I read this and I'm studying this and I
[27:56] see brother brandom make the statement
[27:58] that God's light
[28:00] operated that's a verb that is action
[28:04] through the cosmic light of our
[28:07] bodies Our cell me in an educated way I
[28:12] immediately begin to think there's no
[28:14] way this is a thought because a thought
[28:16] to me does not have cells it does not
[28:20] have you know action to it he says we
[28:23] were at absolutely at one time real
[28:26] genuine Son of God but as I say we would
[28:30] think that way but we have to remember
[28:32] that man's thoughts are not like God's
[28:34] thoughts and God's thoughts are real and
[28:36] God's thoughts are tangible and the
[28:38] light of God can operate through your
[28:40] being and through your cell and you be a
[28:43] real genuine Son of God and you still
[28:47] just be a thought in the mind of God
[28:51] because God's thoughts are so much
[28:53] higher than ours and as I said before I
[28:55] don't want to stumble anybody but this
[28:57] is to me this is just easy to understand
[29:00] when we accept the fact that God's
[29:02] thoughts May simply be in a different
[29:04] dimension and that Dimension when we're
[29:08] not open to that Dimension we say well
[29:10] it's just a thought of God well if God's
[29:12] thoughts are in another dimension they
[29:14] can be more real than this Dimension and
[29:17] the and God's the light of God could
[29:20] certainly be working through the cosmic
[29:23] light of our bodies and ourselves in
[29:25] that Dimension and that Dimension could
[29:27] just be known as the thoughts of God but
[29:30] it is more real than this Dimension that
[29:32] we set in now so the emphasis is on the
[29:37] thoughts of God because the thoughts of
[29:39] God are what is
[29:41] real it is what is
[29:44] eternal what we see here this is a
[29:46] thought of
[29:47] man this is a thought of man everything
[29:50] you see right here outside of these
[29:52] individuals everything material Goods
[29:55] here is the thoughts of man this this is
[29:57] what man had an idea and then sat down
[30:00] and constructed and put together brother
[30:02] brandom says God's thoughts are not like
[30:04] that he does not have a blueprint that
[30:06] maybe one day he'll get to and put
[30:08] together but when God has a thought it
[30:10] is real it is
[30:11] tangible it is
[30:15] eternal so much higher than our thoughts
[30:18] but this is just another prime example
[30:20] of what I wanted to emphasize when we
[30:22] read that through education and through
[30:25] teaching you know our mind starts going
[30:27] haywire how is it a thought but it has
[30:29] cells if it has Sals it's real it's
[30:31] tangible it's no longer a thought throw
[30:34] education out the window it does not
[30:36] exist in the mind of God it does not
[30:38] exist in the Realms of
[30:41] God we thank God that we have prophetic
[30:44] insight into the mind of God and that
[30:47] prophetic Insight is what interprets the
[30:49] mind of God to us not our education and
[30:52] what you know we learned the word was in
[30:54] third grade that's that's certainly not
[30:57] not going to to hold
[30:59] weight Israel and the church 1953 he
[31:03] says now you didn't become a Christian
[31:05] just coincidence because you become a
[31:07] Christian before you was in this world
[31:10] before you were born God ordained you to
[31:12] be a Christian from the Garden of Eden
[31:14] from before the foundation of the world
[31:17] all you say is that right brother that's
[31:19] the truth before there ever was you know
[31:22] anything there was a time that you knew
[31:26] amen but your mind is darkened to that
[31:29] now there's only been one man on Earth
[31:32] that knew that he was from before and
[31:34] that was Jesus he said glorify me father
[31:37] with the glory that I had with you
[31:39] before the foundation of the world he
[31:41] was the Incarnate God he could move back
[31:44] there and know what is I'm sorry he
[31:46] could move back there and know what was
[31:49] but our minds are blackened there
[31:53] obviously we know that we came different
[31:55] from Jesus Christ we came through the to
[31:57] fall and he did not and there was
[31:59] something that we came without that he
[32:02] did not even though brother brandham
[32:04] said he was 100% man but he also said he
[32:07] was 100% God so he had that capacity to
[32:10] move back there brother brandom says and
[32:13] remember where he came from not as and
[32:17] he makes the statement here that there
[32:18] was only one man that knew that now we
[32:20] know we stand here as a or sit here as a
[32:22] privileged group of people and we know
[32:25] that not in the perfe ction that Christ
[32:28] knew it though cuz he's saying that our
[32:30] minds are still dark to that we don't
[32:32] have a perfect revelation of that
[32:34] Jesus's revelation of that was not
[32:36] skewed it was not darkened it was not
[32:38] blackened he could move back there and
[32:40] have a perfect knowledge of
[32:43] that through the gift of a prophet that
[32:46] has been brought to us now we have a
[32:48] partial revelation of that um we have an
[32:51] insight into that but it's not the same
[32:54] as Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ was
[32:57] not hybrid we came with a hybrid mind we
[33:00] came with a with a hybrid body and again
[33:03] I don't have all the understanding of
[33:05] that but for whatever reason that has to
[33:09] be blackened to us that has to be
[33:10] darkened to us at one time it wasn't at
[33:14] one time brother Brandon said you knew
[33:16] that we didn't wonder if we were Sons
[33:19] and Daughters of God it wasn't a
[33:21] question we knew yes we knew just the
[33:24] same as Jesus Christ knew when he was
[33:26] here on Earth
[33:27] but now through the plan and the
[33:30] permission of God we have come in this
[33:33] condition but as I said before I thank
[33:35] God for a prophet I thank God for the
[33:37] gift of a prophet that was sent to me
[33:39] that I dealt that this does not have to
[33:42] be completely darkened to me that there
[33:44] has come a Vindicated word in this hour
[33:48] to start pulling back that spiritual
[33:50] Amnesia maybe not in its entirety yet
[33:54] but I believe we're getting there and I
[33:56] believe we will get get there and and we
[33:58] will have that perfect
[34:01] understanding if we need that prior to
[34:03] the Rapture we'll have it prior to the
[34:05] Rapture if we can make it with in the
[34:08] Rapture without a perfect understanding
[34:10] of that we'll make it without that but I
[34:13] believe that through the full word
[34:17] that's been
[34:18] delivered
[34:20] amen I believe that we
[34:24] have perfect rapturing Faith available
[34:27] to us even without maybe the all the
[34:30] terminology not lining up I believe we
[34:33] have been privileged and given
[34:36] enough that we're not we're not going to
[34:41] be left hanging and having to figure out
[34:44] terminology on a topic such as this
[34:47] remember the terminology is not ever
[34:50] what's going to change your atoms the
[34:53] terminology is simply The Vessel and the
[34:57] vehicle that God would use to try to
[34:59] reveal something to us it's it's and
[35:02] brother random taught us these
[35:04] principles in the Book of Revelation in
[35:05] the Book of Genesis he says those are
[35:07] books of symbols you know go God God is
[35:11] a spirit why does God need a marble
[35:13] Throne to be setting on brother Ram says
[35:16] no no no he says these are symbols so
[35:19] it's not even the symbols that are real
[35:21] but the symbols are the vehicle to try
[35:23] to get the thoughts of God over to us in
[35:26] our fallen
[35:28] condition and I believe that we
[35:31] understand that and know that so even
[35:33] though our minds are blackened there I
[35:37] believe that there's been light shed on
[35:39] that and I believe there's been enough
[35:41] light shed on that that the spiritual
[35:43] Amnesia of the principle is gone even if
[35:47] I don't have a perfect understanding of
[35:50] it he says continuing in that same
[35:53] message he says now we've got to come to
[35:56] full
[35:57] Doctrine I like good old shouting
[35:59] meetings where we just clap our hands or
[36:01] shout and have a good time have great
[36:03] powerful services and things dance on
[36:05] the bubble as it were but then when The
[36:07] Showdown come time comes you don't know
[36:10] where you're standing I'll interpret
[36:13] that if you'll allow me that Showdown
[36:14] time he was referring to is the trials
[36:16] in your life
[36:18] am he says when The Showdown time comes
[36:22] you don't know where you're standing
[36:24] let's get back and find out let's find
[36:27] out what's making us do that let's get
[36:29] back to the
[36:31] foundation see this is a foundational
[36:34] principle per the prophet let's get back
[36:36] to the foundation of why we're rejoicing
[36:40] let's get back to the foundation of why
[36:42] we're dancing let's get back to the
[36:44] foundation so that when the trials and
[36:45] the tribulation comes we're not
[36:47] scattered and blown like the wind blown
[36:50] With the Wind let's get back to the
[36:52] foundation the major principles of God
[36:56] know where we come from and know where
[36:57] we're going so that when The Showdown
[37:00] time comes we're not
[37:04] shaken so here's the few things that I
[37:08] wanted to you know kind of wrap up this
[37:10] topic with
[37:11] now in the church age
[37:15] book brother brandham
[37:21] says speaking on the topic of
[37:25] predestination he said before I close
[37:27] this subject I know there is a question
[37:29] in your minds you will want to know if I
[37:33] believe in the doctrine of
[37:35] preexistence I don't believe in that
[37:38] Mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of
[37:41] souls any more than I believe in re
[37:44] reincarnation or the transmigration of
[37:47] souls be careful here and see this it is
[37:52] not the person that comes predestinated
[37:55] eternally from God it is the word or
[38:00] seed that is it way back there too far
[38:04] back for the human mind to grasp the
[38:07] Eternal go he said for the human mind to
[38:11] grasp he didn't say for your soul to
[38:14] grasp so don't run away from it and say
[38:16] oh there's no point in trying he said
[38:18] way back there too far for the human
[38:20] mind to grasp Amen Let me quote a
[38:23] scripture to you let the mind of Christ
[38:25] be in you so get rid of your human mind
[38:28] let the mind of Christ be in
[38:31] you so even if it's too far back for
[38:33] your human mind it's not too far back
[38:35] for your soul amen way back there too
[38:38] far back for the human mind to grasp the
[38:41] Eternal god with eternal thoughts
[38:44] thought and decreed Jacob have I loved
[38:47] but Esau have I hated so he's stating
[38:51] this principle Jacob have I loved Esau
[38:53] have I hated this is way too far back in
[38:56] the mind of God for you to
[38:58] grasp so my question is to you why do
[39:01] you believe it
[39:03] still if your human mind can't believe
[39:06] that or can't grasp that why do you
[39:08] still believe in the predestination and
[39:10] the sovereignty of God that Jacob have I
[39:12] loved and Esau have I hated and you
[39:14] apply you have the audacity to the apply
[39:17] that to your life that you were
[39:19] predestinated from God if that is too
[39:22] far back for your human mind to grasp
[39:25] why do you still believe
[39:27] it cuz there's something else besides
[39:29] your your human mind that the spiritual
[39:32] Amnesia has been stripped away from that
[39:34] the light of God has shed upon and given
[39:37] you the
[39:39] ability eyes to see and ears to
[39:44] hear he says Jacob have I loved but Esau
[39:47] have I hated and neither was
[39:50] born neither had done good or evil see
[39:54] it was the thought and and then that
[39:57] thought became expressed and God brought
[40:00] bought back Jacob because Jacob alone
[40:05] was seed Jacob alone had the seed that
[40:08] is why he had respect to the birthright
[40:10] and the Covenant of God if you are true
[40:13] seed you will hear that
[40:16] word the spirit will baptize you into
[40:19] the body of Christ filling you and
[40:22] empowering you and you will receive the
[40:25] word for your day and
[40:28] age see how clear the true evidence
[40:32] becomes when the word of God is revealed
[40:35] to
[40:36] you I say praise the Lord for that
[40:39] because there has been thou hundreds of
[40:43] years of the truth of the new birth
[40:45] being skewed and being falsely
[40:48] represented and now he says see how
[40:50] clear it is once the word has been made
[40:52] known to you that if you are seed yeah
[40:57] the spirit will baptize you into the
[41:00] body of Christ filling you and
[41:02] empowering you and you will receive the
[41:05] word for your day and your age see how
[41:08] clear the true evidence becomes
[41:13] then I would say don't ever make it any
[41:15] more than what the prophet said it was
[41:18] if he said the true evidence was to
[41:21] receive the word for your day and your
[41:24] age let it be that there is nobody else
[41:28] on the face of the Earth that has the
[41:30] capacity to receive the full true word
[41:33] for this day in this age outside of the
[41:35] elect of Jesus Christ and I don't care
[41:38] how many mistakes youve made today this
[41:40] week last week whatever it doesn't
[41:42] change what the Vindicated Prophet said
[41:44] the true evidence was it doesn't change
[41:47] the fact that if you have the capacity
[41:50] to receive the full word of God for this
[41:52] day in this age as delivered by a
[41:55] Vindicated prophet there is only one
[41:57] people on the face of the Earth that has
[41:59] that
[42:00] [Music]
[42:01] capacity you
[42:04] Lord
[42:06] shortcomings
[42:11] mistakes willful
[42:14] Disobedience doesn't change any of
[42:17] that if you have that capacity it means
[42:22] one thing right now shortcomings
[42:25] mistakes and willful Disobedience will
[42:27] put a lot of scars on your
[42:30] back it it will do that it's not if it
[42:34] will do that but scars on your back
[42:38] still won't change what capacity that
[42:41] you
[42:43] have so I want to go back to this uh
[42:47] just just briefly here because if you
[42:49] would just read this in this
[42:51] context it would almost sound like
[42:53] brother brandom doesn't believe in
[42:55] pre-existence and he doesn't believe in
[42:57] all these statements that he's made from
[42:59] 47 to 65 but we know there has to be a
[43:02] truth somewhere here but brother random
[43:04] does not say that he says you will want
[43:06] to know if I believe in the doctrine of
[43:08] pre-existence that's the question he
[43:10] says I don't believe in that Mormon
[43:13] doctrine of pre-existence I'm not Mormon
[43:16] I can't tell you what that Doctrine is
[43:18] but he gives us a little insight here he
[43:20] says in the pre-existence of souls any
[43:24] more than I believe in the reincarnation
[43:26] or the transmigration of souls so me
[43:28] just applying
[43:30] biblical uh definitions to this we know
[43:33] that Adam did not become a living Soul
[43:37] until God formed him out of the Dust of
[43:40] the earth made him a flesh body and put
[43:43] a and breathed in him breathed in him
[43:46] the breath of life and then the
[43:48] scripture says he became a living Soul
[43:51] so brother random from my understanding
[43:54] is saying that Adam never existed in
[43:57] that condition in that form in that
[44:00] manifestation as a flesh man with a soul
[44:03] PRI to being in this Dimension and in
[44:06] that manifestation as recorded in the
[44:09] scriptures now I could be wrong here if
[44:11] I am our pastor will come and correct me
[44:13] but this and I'm open to that um like I
[44:15] said I am not an authority on this but
[44:18] this is just me applying what I see in
[44:20] the scriptures to the statements that
[44:23] brother random is making because you
[44:25] would you would have to be foolish to
[44:28] read the message and not think that
[44:29] brother brandham doesn't believe in any
[44:31] type of pre-existence I mean there are
[44:34] dozens and dozens and dozens of
[44:36] statements to where he clearly says that
[44:38] but he is addressing now what form that
[44:42] was in and the form that that was is not
[44:46] the form that we find ourself in now
[44:48] right it's not even the form that Adam
[44:52] found himself in before he fell so there
[44:55] was a different form there was a
[44:58] different manifestation I'll say there
[45:00] was there was possibly different forms
[45:04] and different manifestations and
[45:06] different Expressions prior to this one
[45:09] I don't know that there was just one but
[45:11] there was at least one and at the very
[45:14] least it was a thought in the mind of
[45:15] God which by the way again was
[45:18] real so real that the light of God could
[45:21] work through it if that was the same
[45:23] expression if not then there was another
[45:25] expression and it was just as
[45:28] real but he's
[45:30] making a a teaching here so that the
[45:33] people do not believe a false Doctrine
[45:36] as presented by the Mormons that he does
[45:38] not believe in the pre-existence of The
[45:41] Soul Man in that in this condition as a
[45:44] living Soul prior to this Dimension but
[45:47] he brings Clarity to that he said it is
[45:50] not the person so it's not your flesh
[45:54] being it's not this 16 elements that
[45:57] you're setting in here today we know
[45:59] that it can't be that because even that
[46:00] is in a hybrid
[46:03] situation but he says it's not that
[46:06] person that came predestinated eternally
[46:09] from God it is the word that is inside
[46:14] of that person so it is the word or he
[46:16] says it is the word or seed that is
[46:19] inside of that hybrid 16 elements that
[46:22] you're you are packing around that word
[46:25] and that seed in those elements and even
[46:28] though that full manifestation when I
[46:30] see you I see a body I see eyes and ears
[46:32] and so that's not the Eternal part and
[46:35] as brother Brandon referenced it he says
[46:36] you've never seen me so it's not that
[46:40] expression that I can see with my
[46:42] natural eyes here that is important that
[46:44] is eternal that was in the mind of God
[46:47] how could God it is not that God didn't
[46:49] know you would end up in a hybrid
[46:51] condition but God's Eternal thoughts
[46:53] would not put you in a hybrid condition
[46:55] that is not not how he knew
[46:59] you he says it is the word or the seed
[47:04] that is it way back there too far for
[47:07] the human mind to grasp but he's given
[47:10] us some light on that he's shedding
[47:11] light on that so that we're not going
[47:13] astray and you know there's a lot of
[47:15] things that tie into that first you
[47:16] believe that you were a a human in uh
[47:20] before you were in this world and then
[47:22] you know people went crazy with that now
[47:24] you weren't just a human but before this
[47:26] you were a buffalo and then before that
[47:28] you were an ant and now if you squish a
[47:30] fly you're right that could have been my
[47:32] grandmother and he says we don't believe
[47:35] in that we don't believe in The
[47:36] Reincarnation we don't believe in the
[47:38] transmigration this manifestation that
[47:40] we find oursel in right now is not the
[47:43] same manifestation that
[47:47] pre-existed what pre-existed is the word
[47:51] that's the Eternal part or the seed so
[47:55] he puts those two terminologies to it
[47:57] the word or the seed that is what is
[48:01] eternal
[48:03] now we want to hold that in our mind
[48:08] because I'm going
[48:09] to be speaking on that specifically now
[48:13] because that is very easy just to say
[48:16] and it becomes a cliche oh yeah the word
[48:18] in me was before oh yes you know the
[48:20] seed that was in me and that's true I'm
[48:22] not against the cliches but I've heard
[48:24] cliches all my life there is a truth to
[48:27] this and I want to the best that I can
[48:30] just cut a little piece of that off
[48:32] tonight and let you walk out of here
[48:34] tonight maybe with a little bit more of
[48:37] an understanding or uh Foundation of
[48:41] what does that really mean what does he
[48:43] really mean when he says it was the word
[48:46] or the seed that was
[48:48] eternal before I do that I I need to
[48:50] read you this other quote in the church
[48:52] age book he says now I know in answering
[48:55] one question another one is apt to come
[48:57] up and people ask me if Eve fell that
[49:01] way what did Adam do so he was just
[49:03] speaking how Eve was deceived and the
[49:06] serpent begal her and she fell uh
[49:09] because she did not believe the full
[49:10] word of God and they're saying if Eve
[49:13] fell that way what did Adam do for God
[49:17] lays the blame on
[49:19] Adam he says that is
[49:23] simple that's simple of course well of
[49:26] course it's simple why would we think
[49:27] that would be
[49:30] complicated the word of
[49:32] God this is extremely
[49:38] important the word of God is forever
[49:42] settled in
[49:46] heaven this is a principle we have to
[49:49] catch if we're going to catch anything
[49:50] else we have to catch
[49:53] this the word of God God is forever
[49:58] settled in
[50:01] heaven before one Speck of Stardust was
[50:05] made that word God's law was there
[50:10] exactly as it is written in our
[50:15] Bible we have to catch
[50:18] this so when this came along it was not
[50:22] the first manifestation of this amen he
[50:25] said
[50:26] this was forever settled in heaven
[50:29] before there was one Speck of Stardust
[50:31] and it was there exactly as we find it
[50:36] here forever settled he says now the
[50:39] word teaches us that if a woman don't
[50:43] get hung up on this principle I'm not
[50:44] going to preach on marriage and divorce
[50:46] and I don't want your minds to stay but
[50:48] I have to read this so you understand
[50:49] where he's coming from but stay focused
[50:51] on the principle that I'm reading here
[50:53] not on the example he says now the the
[50:55] word teaches us that if a woman leaves
[50:57] her husband and goes with another man
[50:59] she is an adulteress and is no longer
[51:01] married and the husband is not to take
[51:03] her back that word was true in Eden as
[51:06] it was true when Moses wrote it in the
[51:08] law so he's saying before Moses wrote
[51:11] that in the law it was already true it
[51:15] was already settled it was already
[51:17] written in heaven exactly the way Moses
[51:19] finally came and wrote it it had already
[51:21] been done and it was already settled in
[51:24] so much that God used it as judgment
[51:27] against
[51:31] Adam the word can't change Adam took her
[51:35] back he catch this he knew exactly what
[51:39] he was doing but he did it anyhow my
[51:42] question to you is how did Adam know he
[51:45] was exactly what he was doing and that
[51:48] he was transgressing the laws of God
[51:50] when it had never even been
[51:54] written praise God because Adam didn't
[51:58] have the Blackness on him like we have
[52:00] on us at that point in time that was
[52:03] prior to the fall he was not confused
[52:06] brother brandom says he was not confused
[52:07] he says he knew exactly what he was
[52:10] doing and he did it anyhow before it was
[52:13] ever written in the Bible That's how
[52:16] real it was it was so real that Adam
[52:18] knew what he was doing was wrong he knew
[52:21] it was a violation of God's word and it
[52:23] was so real that God could come on the
[52:24] scene and say you knew this was wrong
[52:27] and now I am still righteous even though
[52:29] it's not written down on paper you knew
[52:32] this was wrong and it is so real and
[52:35] settled here in heaven that I am still
[52:37] righteous to pass judgment on
[52:40] you that's how real it
[52:45] was the principle is that that didn't
[52:49] change just because we're now in
[52:53] 2023 we would view that as a negative
[52:58] example as in it's real it was real
[53:00] before and there were people judged by
[53:02] it but if it's real for the negative
[53:05] example it still has to be real for the
[53:08] positive
[53:11] example 1963 questions and answers on
[53:14] the seals is it true that every Jew born
[53:17] since Christ that came into the world is
[53:19] to be saved he says no nothing will be
[53:23] saved only those whose names were put on
[53:25] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[53:26] foundation of the world Jew or Gentile
[53:29] see that's all the book holds that
[53:38] Myster what
[53:42] book and when did it come into
[53:46] existence this book holds the mystery of
[53:49] who is to be
[53:52] saved what book where is it it written
[53:56] and when did it become into
[54:01] existence the book holds the mystery and
[54:05] the book is only unfolding it
[54:09] now not each one's name but what the
[54:14] mystery of the book is while it's
[54:17] calling those
[54:19] names you finally understand that now
[54:23] I'm sure everybody raised their hand and
[54:24] said yes
[54:26] the book does he continues the book
[54:28] doesn't say now LEL is to be saved in
[54:32] time of this church age or Oreville or
[54:34] whoever no it don't say that the book it
[54:38] just shows the mystery it unfolds the
[54:42] mystery of what the thing is if you
[54:45] allow me to interpret that to you it
[54:46] infolds the mystery of what the word for
[54:49] your age is it unfolds that mystery of
[54:54] what the book
[54:56] is and what the thing is but we
[55:00] ourselves by faith believe it that's
[55:03] what I said the other night amen
[55:06] so this book is the word of God this
[55:10] book is the Lamb's Book of Life this is
[55:12] The Book of Life this is the record of
[55:15] the elect and he is saying that there is
[55:17] nobody going to be saved besides what's
[55:19] already on this book but this book is
[55:22] only unfolding itself now
[55:25] he says this it shows the mystery it
[55:29] unfolds The Mystery of the thing and he
[55:32] says this book holds that mystery and
[55:34] the book is only unfolding now not each
[55:37] one's name but what the mystery of the
[55:39] book is while it's calling those names
[55:44] so as this book unfolds and as this
[55:47] mystery
[55:48] unfolds it somehow reveals or calls
[55:53] those names
[55:57] amen someone said well there's no need
[55:59] in me trying it brother
[56:01] brandham brother brandom said there's
[56:03] only one to be saved out of
[56:04] Jeffersonville now you see it's showing
[56:07] a parable that isn't it isn't it there
[56:09] might be thousands saved I don't know I
[56:12] hope every one of them is saved but I
[56:14] don't know but here is the way I want to
[56:16] believe it I'm that one you believe the
[56:20] same way for you if you don't then
[56:22] there's something wrong with your faith
[56:23] you're not sure what you're doing
[56:25] how can you walk up there in the face of
[56:27] death when you're not too sure whether
[56:29] you're saved or not how can you go down
[56:31] here and say to this crippled man laying
[56:33] here blinded and twisted up thus sayith
[56:35] the Lord rise up Jesus Christ makes you
[56:37] whole how can you stand that old cold
[56:41] stiff body laying there that's dead and
[56:43] been dead for hours and hours and laying
[56:45] there cold and stiff and say thus sayith
[56:47] the Lord rise to your feet you better
[56:50] you have to know what you're talking
[56:51] about you say well death claims
[56:54] everything it's all G on yeah but when
[56:56] the word of God is revealed you know
[56:59] it's God that changes things
[57:02] am so he's teaching this principle that
[57:05] you have to know where you're standing
[57:07] before you're going to accomplish
[57:09] anything for the kingdom of God even
[57:11] before you're going to be uh stable and
[57:15] secure in your own salvation and the
[57:17] only way to do that is through the
[57:20] unfolding of this mystery the unfolding
[57:23] of this book because as it does that it
[57:26] will call your name and if it calls your
[57:29] name that means your name is on the book
[57:31] and if your name is on the book that
[57:33] means you can no more be lost than God
[57:34] can be lost because his word that book
[57:37] was forever settled in heaven and it was
[57:40] eternal and it was
[57:42] real amen just as real as when Adam knew
[57:47] what he was doing he was transgressing
[57:49] the laws of God it was so real then that
[57:52] God can now come down and pass judgment
[57:54] it is the same reality it is same it has
[57:57] the same Eternal quality that it can now
[58:01] not in judgment but now in Grace come
[58:06] and be revealed somehow some way that
[58:10] you would hear your name under that and
[58:13] that would give you a security and a
[58:15] stability that I came from God I'm going
[58:18] to God because my name is on this book I
[58:21] have heard my name called as this
[58:23] mystery has been revealed
[58:27] God now this is if by God's grace he'll
[58:32] allow me to do this this is where I want
[58:34] to make the rubber meet the road because
[58:36] you can take everything that I've said
[58:38] up to this point as cliches but this is
[58:41] where the rubber will meet the road I'm
[58:43] going to ask you if you can hear your
[58:45] name let's go to Malachi don't turn
[58:48] there I'm going too fast Malachi
[58:50] 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah thank
[58:53] you amen
[58:57] why are you happy why are you rejoicing
[59:00] why do you have your hands up I didn't
[59:02] not say your name I did not say your
[59:06] name that's exactly right because there
[59:09] is a book being revealed there is a
[59:12] power and the unveiling of God that can
[59:14] give you eyes to see and ears to
[59:17] hear behold I send you what audacity you
[59:22] in a hybrid condition you with thank you
[59:25] as
[59:26] you behold I will send you saints of God
[59:30] I don't care if there is only one person
[59:33] going in a Rapture behold I will send
[59:36] Benjamin seabolt Elijah the prophet and
[59:39] if he so cared about me to send me
[59:43] Elijah the prophet prophet he only has
[59:45] one point in doing that so that he can
[59:48] reveal himself to me and that he can
[59:50] give me a proper understanding of where
[59:52] I came from and where I'm going
[59:55] so that I will recognize it is now my
[59:58] time to depart out of this world unto
[1:00:00] the
[1:00:02] father he might I I'll say it like
[1:00:05] brother brandom said it I'm glad that it
[1:00:07] doesn't say Benjamin seabolt right there
[1:00:09] because there might be two Benjamin seab
[1:00:11] bolts on the face of the Earth but I am
[1:00:13] here to tell you by Revelation it might
[1:00:16] as well say that I will send Benjamin
[1:00:19] seabol born on finwick mountain in ji
[1:00:22] January the 4th 1985 I'm talking too
[1:00:25] fast I'm probably going to give false
[1:00:26] facts so don't don't pay attention to
[1:00:28] that you know what I'm getting at it
[1:00:31] might as well put my DNA chemistry
[1:00:34] makeup right
[1:00:36] there there is no doubt of who that you
[1:00:39] is I encourage you to believe it for
[1:00:43] yourself the availability to believe it
[1:00:45] to yourself is there allow it to call
[1:00:49] your name behold I will send you Elijah
[1:00:53] the prophet before the coming of the
[1:00:55] great and Dreadful day of the
[1:00:57] Lord and he shall turn the heart hearts
[1:01:00] of the fathers to the
[1:01:04] children well I thought Malachi 4 spoke
[1:01:06] about brother brandom it
[1:01:08] does it
[1:01:10] does but there's also a you in
[1:01:13] there and there's these children
[1:01:18] yeah see brother brandham has a
[1:01:22] purpose to turn the hearts of the
[1:01:24] fathers to the
[1:01:27] children well who's the
[1:01:29] children I know who Elijah is but who is
[1:01:34] this you and who is this
[1:01:37] children and they're mentioned again and
[1:01:39] the hearts of the children to the
[1:01:40] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[1:01:42] with the
[1:01:45] curse this is the word of God is it
[1:01:50] not this is real this is eternal and and
[1:01:54] this was forever settled in
[1:01:57] heaven even before Elijah showed up in a
[1:02:00] tangible body even before God gave me
[1:02:03] eyes and an education to read the words
[1:02:05] and say behold I send you before any of
[1:02:09] that happened this was already settled
[1:02:11] in heaven that I'm sending Benjamin
[1:02:13] seabolt Elijah the prophet and he will
[1:02:16] come to a point one day he will
[1:02:17] recognize that he is a child of God that
[1:02:20] needs his heart turned back to the
[1:02:22] fathers yeah
[1:02:25] that is how the book calls your name
[1:02:28] that is how you this is what brother
[1:02:30] Brandon was talking about the Eternal
[1:02:32] part the word or the seed not your
[1:02:35] hybrid body not the condition you find
[1:02:37] yourself in but that Revelation that day
[1:02:40] and that time or that night wherever it
[1:02:42] was at in a church building in a barn in
[1:02:44] your bedroom wherever it was at when you
[1:02:46] read that and you all of a sudden had a
[1:02:48] spark in your heart to have the to have
[1:02:51] the audacity to think that's me amen
[1:02:55] what if that is
[1:02:59] me that was forever settled in
[1:03:03] heaven and that was the Eternal portion
[1:03:06] and that is what is going to stabilize
[1:03:11] us come what
[1:03:16] may Revelation 10:7 but in the days of
[1:03:19] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:03:21] shall begin to sound the
[1:03:23] mystery
[1:03:24] the book The
[1:03:28] Mystery I know who that seventh angel is
[1:03:32] but the mystery of God should be
[1:03:34] finished who is this
[1:03:37] mystery because it sounds familiar to me
[1:03:39] it sounds like somebody said that to me
[1:03:43] before it it sounds almost like my name
[1:03:47] this mystery of God should be finished
[1:03:51] this final manifestation of God is going
[1:03:54] going to be
[1:03:55] finished Christ in Bride form is going
[1:03:59] to be
[1:04:00] finished saints of God the bride is made
[1:04:02] up of people and those people have names
[1:04:06] and those names are not necessarily
[1:04:08] written in Black Ink and white paper but
[1:04:10] they can say the mystery and all of a
[1:04:13] sudden something as brother Brandon
[1:04:14] would say something would come tumbling
[1:04:16] down through a mystical Channel and I
[1:04:18] would recognize that I am that
[1:04:22] mystery the voice of the seventh angel
[1:04:24] when he begins to sound when he begins
[1:04:27] to call
[1:04:28] names the mystery of whether I'm on that
[1:04:32] book or not's going to be
[1:04:35] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:04:37] servants the prophets and the voice
[1:04:40] which I heard you say well that's John
[1:04:43] that's not you the voice that I
[1:04:47] heard from Heaven spake unto me you said
[1:04:50] well that's John no that's
[1:04:52] me you can you can say it's John if you
[1:04:55] want to but that's
[1:04:59] meise spake to me again and said go and
[1:05:02] take the little book which is open in
[1:05:03] the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:05:05] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[1:05:06] went into the angel I went into the
[1:05:09] angel I went to the angel you said well
[1:05:12] I never went to the
[1:05:13] angel did you pick up a message book
[1:05:16] yeah did you turn on a tape did you
[1:05:20] listen to what somebody had to say about
[1:05:21] Elijah the prophet coming into the scene
[1:05:27] and I went into the
[1:05:29] angel and I said give me the little book
[1:05:33] give me the little book me me that me in
[1:05:37] the scripture is a person
[1:05:39] Saints and that person is written in the
[1:05:42] word of God forever settled in heaven
[1:05:46] Eternal
[1:05:49] real give me the book and he said unto
[1:05:52] me take it and eat it up and it shall
[1:05:54] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[1:05:58] thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[1:06:00] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[1:06:02] ate it up and it was in my mouth look at
[1:06:04] all these personal pronouns I would
[1:06:07] encourage you if there is anything that
[1:06:09] I could do tonight I would encourage you
[1:06:11] do not leave this with
[1:06:14] John and that's just not me saying that
[1:06:17] we we have a Vindicated Prophet saying
[1:06:20] that John represented the
[1:06:22] bride yes we're not out in left field on
[1:06:25] this teaching Saints we're not out in
[1:06:27] left field a prophet would say who this
[1:06:29] is representing but it has to remember
[1:06:32] what he said the new birth was is Jesus
[1:06:34] Christ revealed to the individual you
[1:06:37] can say Amen all night long when I say
[1:06:40] that's not John but that's just coming
[1:06:43] out of Egypt you got to say that's me to
[1:06:46] get into the promised land our goal is
[1:06:48] not to just come out of Egypt and wander
[1:06:51] around in the wilderness of who the
[1:06:52] mystery is and who who that thy is and
[1:06:55] who that me is our goal is to get out of
[1:06:58] Egypt get out of the darkness and get
[1:07:00] into the promised land to where we can
[1:07:03] recognize that is not just
[1:07:07] John that is
[1:07:10] me sweet as honey and I had eaten it up
[1:07:13] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[1:07:17] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:07:20] peoples and Nations and tongues and
[1:07:21] Kings you say well John sure did do a
[1:07:24] good job on
[1:07:28] that did anybody testify to a coworker

[1:07:33] stranger did anybody testify to their
[1:07:35] their their family at Christmas

[1:07:42] coworker sir to your family at Christmas
[1:07:45] to the stranger at
[1:07:47] Walmart was forever settled in heaven
[1:07:51] and it was so real that God wrote it
[1:07:55] down thou must Pro thou put your name in
[1:07:59] there thou must speak of the true word
[1:08:03] of God to your family member that's lost
[1:08:06] and astray during Christmas in
[1:08:10] 2013 23
[1:08:13] sorry amen remember we're still in
[1:08:16] Fallen
[1:08:19] vessels you say well nah that's too
[1:08:22] simple that saints of God that is the
[1:08:24] rubber meeting the road you make it
[1:08:27] cliches if you want to you make it fairy
[1:08:29] dust if you want to that's the reality
[1:08:32] of the word of
[1:08:35] God thou must prophesy again before many
[1:08:39] peoples and Nations and tongues and
[1:08:40] Kings let me read you one more
[1:08:42] Revelation
[1:08:43] 22:16 Jesus I Jesus have sent my angel
[1:08:48] to testify unto
[1:08:52] you
[1:08:56] just in case you don't know that
[1:08:59] angel was the seventh angel and that
[1:09:02] angel was the same angel that was in
[1:09:03] Malachi 4 and that angel was also sent
[1:09:06] to me
[1:09:07] there and I was a
[1:09:10] child so that I would not be cursed and
[1:09:12] I would not be destroyed in the great
[1:09:14] and Dreadful day of the Lord and here he
[1:09:16] is again I have sent M Angel to testify
[1:09:20] unto
[1:09:22] you
[1:09:25] this is the portion brother brandom says
[1:09:27] it is not the person that came
[1:09:29] predestinated and eternal from God it is
[1:09:32] the word or the
[1:09:34] seed you can't make it anything else do
[1:09:38] you have like some paper and ink in your
[1:09:40] heart you're going to pull out one day
[1:09:42] and be like see the word is in me no
[1:09:44] brother Rand says when that mystery is
[1:09:46] revealed it calls your name that name is
[1:09:50] eternal recorded by God himself in The
[1:09:53] Book of
[1:09:55] Life prise God it might say you it might
[1:10:01] say me it might say thy it might say
[1:10:05] thou might say whatever personal pronoun
[1:10:08] is out there and
[1:10:10] available but if you have the capacity
[1:10:14] to
[1:10:15] understand I'm the one he sent that
[1:10:18] angel
[1:10:20] to why not have the capacity to say I
[1:10:23] have my name written in the book because
[1:10:26] he didn't send that angel to anybody
[1:10:27] else besides those names that were
[1:10:29] written in the book he says nobody else
[1:10:31] but the redeemed nobody else but the
[1:10:33] elector even considered in Redemption
[1:10:38] amen I Jesus have sent M Angel to
[1:10:41] testify unto you these things in the
[1:10:43] churches I am the root and offspring of
[1:10:46] David and the bright and morning star
[1:10:48] and the spirit and the
[1:10:52] bride and the Spirit and the bride say
[1:10:56] come amen have you ever invited anybody
[1:11:00] to come into the truth of this
[1:11:04] hour based on what where do you get your
[1:11:07] Authority
[1:11:10] from who are you to invite somebody into
[1:11:14] the truth of the
[1:11:16] hour oh praise the
[1:11:19] Lord because the
[1:11:22] spirit and B Benjamin seabolt say
[1:11:27] come put your name in there don't
[1:11:30] hesitate to put your name in there if
[1:11:32] you have believed the truth and you know
[1:11:35] who the angel is and you believe what he
[1:11:37] has came and told you why can't you put
[1:11:41] yourself in the position that the spirit
[1:11:43] in me as the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:11:46] saying come and if you're identifying
[1:11:48] yourself as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:50] you are written in the Eternal un
[1:11:53] infallible word of Jesus of word of God
[1:11:57] that remember was forever settled before
[1:12:00] there was a speck of
[1:12:02] Stardust see now we're getting down to
[1:12:04] the
[1:12:06] reality of how we were real in the
[1:12:08] thoughts of God and in the mind of God
[1:12:11] because his word was in his mind yeah
[1:12:14] and his word consisted of people amen
[1:12:18] that's the best way I know to say
[1:12:20] it his word can consisted of
[1:12:25] people read the
[1:12:28] Bible what's the Bible made up
[1:12:31] ofah
[1:12:33] people
[1:12:35] people
[1:12:38] people and you'll find that those people
[1:12:40] that are in the
[1:12:42] scriptures that had power before God and
[1:12:46] that made a difference on this Earth had
[1:12:48] a revelation one day yeah amen that I
[1:12:52] think my name's written in that book
[1:12:55] I'm hearing a voice that sounds familiar
[1:12:58] it's telling me something that I feel I
[1:12:59] have heard
[1:13:01] before it sure Rings true in my heart of
[1:13:06] hearts there's nobody else recorded in
[1:13:08] here that I know that says they read the
[1:13:11] word of God thought it sounded good
[1:13:13] didn't know if it was them or not and
[1:13:15] they found them you know in the
[1:13:18] Millennium and in the new heavens and
[1:13:19] new earth everybody in here
[1:13:26] right
[1:13:28] past
[1:13:30] present and
[1:13:32] future
[1:13:35] somehow had some type of spiritual
[1:13:37] Amnesia stripped off of them to where
[1:13:40] they could have an individual
[1:13:43] Revelation
[1:13:45] amen Jesus Christ and that's what I was
[1:13:48] getting to earlier before I went off on
[1:13:50] whatever tangent I went off on brother
[1:13:52] brandom says the New Birth was Jesus
[1:13:55] Christ personally revealed to
[1:13:59] you how is he going to personally reveal
[1:14:03] himself to you if he never calls your
[1:14:06] name
[1:14:07] amen look at all the angels that came to
[1:14:11] people in the Bible the first thing that
[1:14:15] most of those angels did was properly
[1:14:18] identify the people they came to thou
[1:14:22] Gideon I'm probably going to get my name
[1:14:23] is mixed up now but just forgive me you
[1:14:25] know the principles thou Gideon thou
[1:14:27] Mighty Man of
[1:14:28] Valor Mary thou highly beloved of God
[1:14:34] highly favored and beloved of God you
[1:14:37] think that's what she was thinking
[1:14:38] before the angel showed up she didn't
[1:14:40] have a clue she was highly favored and
[1:14:42] beloved of
[1:14:43] God but this Angel comes with a book and
[1:14:47] he strips the Mysteries off the book and
[1:14:50] they give a proper identification Gideon
[1:14:54] Mary the list just goes on and on why
[1:14:58] let it stop with you do we think now
[1:15:00] that this is dead and he won't do this
[1:15:02] two the same thing 2,000 years later if
[1:15:06] Jesus Christ is going to personally
[1:15:08] reveal himself to you why would he not
[1:15:11] call your name and reveal your name to
[1:15:14] you
[1:15:18] amen I hope that brings Clarity of how
[1:15:21] we are Eternal and how we are real yes
[1:15:25] as the word or seed of God that was
[1:15:29] forever settled in heaven it is not just
[1:15:32] a
[1:15:32] cliche it is real if you let it be real
[1:15:37] and if you let it be
[1:15:41] real I would just say as brother random
[1:15:44] we said all things are possible to them
[1:15:47] that
[1:15:50] believe if you truly believe that you
[1:15:53] are a son or daughter of God what is not
[1:15:57] possible see this is not majoring on a
[1:16:01] minor this is majoring on a
[1:16:03] major the major is that you recognize
[1:16:07] and have a proper understanding who you
[1:16:08] are before
[1:16:10] God and if you have that now all things
[1:16:14] are
[1:16:15] possible this is what Peter teaches in
[1:16:17] the scripture make your calling and
[1:16:20] election sure because if you do that you
[1:16:22] won't fail Yeah by default if you don't
[1:16:26] make your calling an election sure what
[1:16:28] are you going to do you're going to
[1:16:31] fail this is a major this is a must amen
[1:16:36] this is the new birth amen this
[1:16:40] is Jesus Christ personally revealed to
[1:16:43] you remember the scripture says we are
[1:16:46] not born to Flesh and Blood we are born
[1:16:48] by the word of God
[1:16:52] Amen
[1:16:53] amen the word of God is what will allow
[1:16:57] you to have a new birth yeah how I just
[1:17:00] gave you the examples
[1:17:02] amen you are going to have somehow
[1:17:06] supernaturally have something come down
[1:17:08] from a Heavenly
[1:17:10] Dimension and ring true in your soul
[1:17:13] that I am that
[1:17:14] you I am that me am I am that
[1:17:19] thy and when you do that and you proper
[1:17:23] place that for your day and for your
[1:17:25] hour as brother brandom said one of
[1:17:28] these days you're going to find
[1:17:30] out God is in
[1:17:35] you you say well that's nice I like the
[1:17:38] sounds of that but brother Benjamin I am
[1:17:40] just not there yet that's fine not a
[1:17:45] problem find yourself in this
[1:17:48] scripture Isaiah 53:1
[1:17:52] who
[1:17:55] who hath believed our
[1:17:57] report and to
[1:18:00] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for
[1:18:03] he shall grow up before him as a tender
[1:18:05] plant and as a root out of dry ground he
[1:18:07] hath no form nor comeliness and when we
[1:18:09] shall see him there is no beauty that we
[1:18:11] shall desire him he is despised and
[1:18:13] rejected of men a Man of Sorrows
[1:18:15] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[1:18:17] were our faces from him he was despised
[1:18:19] and we esteemed him not surely he hath
[1:18:22] borne our griefs have you ever had any
[1:18:25] griefs surely he hath borne our griefs
[1:18:29] and carried our sorrows yet we did
[1:18:31] esteem him stricken smitten of God and
[1:18:33] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[1:18:38] transgressions you say I can't see
[1:18:40] myself as bride tonight that's fine see
[1:18:42] yourself as a transgressor
[1:18:44] then find yourself in the scripture and
[1:18:46] work for it I don't say that to condemn
[1:18:48] you I'm not saying that to Belo you I'm
[1:18:50] just saying if there's a progress from
[1:18:52] Glory unto Glory that he's going to call
[1:18:54] us through and if you can't see yourself
[1:18:56] as the one taking the book and you can't
[1:18:58] see yourself as the one prophesying
[1:19:00] again and you can't see yourself as the
[1:19:01] Bride of Jesus Christ saying come that's
[1:19:05] okay start in Isaiah 53 who has believed
[1:19:08] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who
[1:19:10] has believed the report who is the arm
[1:19:13] of the Lord revealed
[1:19:16] to he was bruised for my transgressions
[1:19:19] I can accept that I'm a transgressor and
[1:19:21] I need somebody to atone for that he was
[1:19:24] he was wounded for my
[1:19:26] transgressions he was bruised for my
[1:19:29] iniquities the chastisement of the peace
[1:19:32] that I needed was upon him and with his
[1:19:34] stripes I am
[1:19:37] healed you say I can't see myself there
[1:19:40] yet that's fine do you need healing see
[1:19:42] yourself in the scriptures do you need
[1:19:44] your transgressions covered for see
[1:19:46] yourself in the SC the the scriptures

[1:19:52] years ago yeah if you got to start off
[1:19:55] on the Bottom Rung start off on the
[1:19:56] Bottom Rung we all did here there is no
[1:19:59] shame in that the only shame is not
[1:20:01] starting off on the bottom run the only
[1:20:03] shame is thanking your bride when you
[1:20:05] haven't even repented yet thanking your
[1:20:07] bride trying to tell people to come and
[1:20:08] you don't have a clue where you're
[1:20:09] taking them
[1:20:13] to Isaiah 53 I can find myself there you
[1:20:17] say well I haven't found myself yet well
[1:20:19] here you go verse six
[1:20:21] all all we like sheep have gone
[1:20:26] astray you might not see yourself as the
[1:20:29] perfect spotless virtuous bride of Jesus
[1:20:32] Christ right now and that's
[1:20:33] okay find yourself as one that is his
[1:20:38] sheep yeah that has went astray and
[1:20:41] start working your way from there yeah
[1:20:44] I'll say it this way let him start
[1:20:45] working his way from there you work as
[1:20:48] much as you can but understand it's
[1:20:49] going to be a work that he does but
[1:20:51] he'll never have anything to work work
[1:20:52] with if you can't hear your name called
[1:20:55] he's calling he's hollering he's
[1:20:57] screaming he's not going to say John
[1:21:00] Becky suszie so forth he's going to say
[1:21:03] all of you have went
[1:21:06] astray it's up to you to believe or to
[1:21:09] reject if you're one of those
[1:21:12] all all we like have like sheep have
[1:21:15] gone astray we have turned everyone to
[1:21:17] his own way and the Lord hath laid on
[1:21:19] him the
[1:21:20] iniquity of us all
[1:21:25] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[1:21:27] yet he opened not his mouth he is
[1:21:28] brought as a lamb to the slaughter and
[1:21:30] as a sheep before her shearers is dumb
[1:21:32] so he opened not his mouth he was taken
[1:21:35] from prison and from
[1:21:37] judgment you
[1:21:40] ready and who hallelu shall
[1:21:45] declare his
[1:21:49] generation if you find yourself in all
[1:21:51] of the negatives
[1:21:53] find yourself in the positive accept all
[1:21:56] the negatives I am a transgressor I have
[1:22:00] fallen in iniquity I have went my own
[1:22:03] ways but I'm repenting for that I am a
[1:22:05] sheep of his fault and I coming back
[1:22:07] under the shepherd's word and
[1:22:11] now I will declare his generation I will
[1:22:15] declare that he is here in flesh again I
[1:22:18] will declare that he has come in the
[1:22:19] form of his bride I will declare and say
[1:22:22] come to this truth I will prophesy again
[1:22:25] with the life that I
[1:22:30] live this is the word that he was
[1:22:32] referring to and there's many other
[1:22:35] scriptural examples we can go from
[1:22:37] Genesis to Revelation and be here till
[1:22:42] forever but we have to let the book call
[1:22:45] our
[1:22:46] name and we've had a Vindicated Prophet
[1:22:48] come on the scene and tell us how that
[1:22:51] happens and now shed light and give us a
[1:22:54] proper understanding of what he means
[1:22:57] when he says we were a word a seed in
[1:23:01] the mind of God and we were real and
[1:23:03] eternal and that word was forever
[1:23:06] settled in
[1:23:08] heaven your spiritual placement was
[1:23:12] forever settled in heaven before there
[1:23:15] was one spec of Stardust he
[1:23:18] said if it was settled then I'm pretty
[1:23:21] confident that what you did yesterday
[1:23:23] today two weeks ago a month ago didn't
[1:23:28] change
[1:23:31] that amen it didn't it can't and that's
[1:23:36] his grace amen because I'm sure you just
[1:23:40] like me have sure tried to change that
[1:23:42] before and we've sure stuck our foot in
[1:23:45] stuff we didn't need to and our hands
[1:23:47] and stuff we didn't need to and our eyes
[1:23:48] and our ears and everything else and
[1:23:51] we've allowed Satan to come come along
[1:23:52] and try to change that spiritual
[1:23:55] position but I thank God it was forever
[1:23:58] settled in heaven yeah I thank God that
[1:24:01] he chose and not me I thank God that He
[1:24:04] gave the Revelation that he sent it
[1:24:07] tumbling down that he sent me an
[1:24:11] angel that he could turn my heart
[1:24:17] back it's got to be true for somebody
[1:24:19] Saints am he did he said I'm sending my
[1:24:23] word forth and it will not return void
[1:24:26] unto me I say if nobody else will accept
[1:24:29] it I'll accept it I will be that you I
[1:24:32] will be that me I will be that
[1:24:41] thy 1 John 3:1 says
[1:24:45] behold what manner of love the father
[1:24:48] hath bestowed upon
[1:24:50] us that we we should be called the sons
[1:24:54] of
[1:24:54] God I say amen and amen
[1:24:58] behold what manner of love the father
[1:25:01] has bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:25:04] called the sons of God
[1:25:07] remember the son a son scripturally def
[1:25:11] defined a son is something that comes
[1:25:14] out of the father it doesn't include you
[1:25:16] sisters a son is just something that
[1:25:19] comes out of the father a daughter can
[1:25:21] come out of the father and it be called
[1:25:24] a son not in the perverted way that the
[1:25:27] world wants to make it today it's just
[1:25:29] terminology the scripture is using what
[1:25:34] love the father has bestowed upon us
[1:25:36] that we should be called something that
[1:25:39] come out of the father amen
[1:25:43] right therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:25:46] because it knew him
[1:25:47] not beloved now we are the sons of God
[1:25:51] and it doth not yet appear what we shall
[1:25:53] be but we know that when he shall appear
[1:25:56] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:25:58] him as he is and every man that hath
[1:26:00] this hope in him purified himself even
[1:26:02] as he is
[1:26:04] pure whosoever committeth sin transgress
[1:26:07] transgresseth also the law for sin is in
[1:26:10] the transgression of the law and ye know
[1:26:13] that he was manifested to take away our
[1:26:15] sins and ye know and
[1:26:18] Ye Ye is a person who knows that who
[1:26:23] knows that he was
[1:26:25] manifested to take away our
[1:26:30] sins is somebody hearing their name
[1:26:33] called you know that he was manifested
[1:26:35] to take away your sin and in him is no
[1:26:38] sin whosoever abideth in him whosoever
[1:26:42] whosoever is a person I'm just here to
[1:26:45] say that whosoever that whosoever is it
[1:26:47] was forever settled in heaven whosoever
[1:26:51] that is it does they don't have a choice
[1:26:53] whether they're going to heaven or not
[1:26:54] they're going to make
[1:26:55] it whosoever that is
[1:26:59] yeah whosoever abideth in him sinth not
[1:27:03] whosoever sinth hath not seen him
[1:27:07] neither known him little children let no
[1:27:09] man deceive you he that doeth
[1:27:11] righteousness is righteous even as he is
[1:27:13] righteous he that committeth sin is of
[1:27:16] the devil for the devil sinth from the
[1:27:18] beginning for this purpose was the son
[1:27:20] of God made manifest that he might
[1:27:23] destroy the works of the
[1:27:25] devil remember the Son of God is
[1:27:28] something that came out of God
[1:27:33] yeah and the purpose of something coming
[1:27:36] out of God into a manifestation was to
[1:27:40] destroy the works of the
[1:27:43] devil right you say well Jesus did a
[1:27:46] fine job of that yes he most certainly
[1:27:48] did but now let me tell you what the
[1:27:49] works of the devil are the works it
[1:27:52] exposes Satan brother Brandon says
[1:27:54] revealing his works the attempted
[1:27:56] destruction of God's people and the
[1:27:59] discrediting of God's
[1:28:01] word how many have not allowed Satan to
[1:28:05] discredit God's word in their life God
[1:28:09] praise God if you do that in the
[1:28:11] fullness of the word of God by default
[1:28:14] you are a son of God you have no there
[1:28:17] is nobody else that has that capability
[1:28:20] Amen to not let discredit even a small
[1:28:23] portion of the word of God in their life
[1:28:25] there's only one class of people that
[1:28:27] has that
[1:28:28] capability I'm not talking in partiality
[1:28:31] I'm talking in fullness of the revealed
[1:28:33] word for this day and this hour if you
[1:28:36] have not let Satan discredit any of that
[1:28:38] to you
[1:28:40] amise God you are a son of
[1:28:45] God not will be you are actually you
[1:28:50] will be because it won't change because
[1:28:52] you are already and you have
[1:28:57] been the Son of God was made manifest to
[1:29:01] dis to destroy the works of the devil
[1:29:05] why are you not letting Satan discredit
[1:29:08] the word of God in your
[1:29:12] life because you think it's a good
[1:29:15] idea because you like the church you go
[1:29:20] to
[1:29:22] it's because you're a Son of
[1:29:25] God let's not make it more complicated
[1:29:28] than what it has to
[1:29:32] be Satan's work is the attempt to
[1:29:36] destruction of God's people and the
[1:29:38] discrediting of God's
[1:29:41] word and the scripture says that there
[1:29:45] is
[1:29:46] Sons there is manifestations that have
[1:29:49] came out of God with one person
[1:29:53] purpose to destroy the works of the
[1:29:56] devil how many have chosen the truth
[1:29:59] over
[1:30:01] false God you have no capacity to do
[1:30:05] that within yourself amen that's right
[1:30:09] we're coming to a
[1:30:11] close in 1 Corinthians
[1:30:13] 14:37 in the church age book brother
[1:30:15] brandom says if any man think himself to
[1:30:17] be a prophet or spiritual let him
[1:30:19] acknowledge that the things that I write
[1:30:20] unto you are the Commandments of the
[1:30:22] Lord now see that the proof of the
[1:30:25] indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and
[1:30:27] follow what God's Prophet gave for his
[1:30:30] age as he set the church in
[1:30:32] order have you acknowledged and follow
[1:30:37] what God's Prophet gave for this age as
[1:30:40] he set this church in
[1:30:43] order that proves you have the
[1:30:45] indwelling
[1:30:47] spiritu and if you have the indwelling
[1:30:50] spirit it's been forever settled in
[1:30:58] heaven Paul had to say to those who
[1:31:00] claimed another another Revelation what
[1:31:03] came the word of God out from you or
[1:31:06] came it unto you only the evidence of a
[1:31:10] Spirit-filled Christian believer is not
[1:31:14] to produce the word of
[1:31:17] God it is to receive the word of God and
[1:31:21] to believe and Obey it you say well I do
[1:31:25] everything that he's talk I dress this
[1:31:27] way I dress that way I don't cut my hair
[1:31:29] I don't wear makeup I don't do this I
[1:31:31] don't do that
[1:31:34] I have you heard him call your name
[1:31:37] because you can do all of that you can
[1:31:39] do all of that and I would say do more
[1:31:41] of that do it to the fullest
[1:31:44] extent but if you've never heard him
[1:31:48] call your name amen you're still missing
[1:31:50] it
[1:31:53] it is not to produce the
[1:31:56] truth but it's to believe to receive the
[1:32:01] truth to receive the truth receiving the
[1:32:05] truth is just not receiving conduct and
[1:32:10] order it's to receive all of the
[1:32:14] spiritual principles that the angel
[1:32:16] disseminated to receive the truth is to
[1:32:21] put yourself in those scriptures that we
[1:32:22] just read a little bit ago to receive
[1:32:25] the truth he the I think you will agree
[1:32:28] with me that brother Brandon was trying
[1:32:30] to get somebody into those scriptures
[1:32:32] correct he was trying to awaken somebody
[1:32:35] to believe that was them and that was
[1:32:39] the truth that he was delivering the
[1:32:41] other things were the they were miners
[1:32:43] not everything but the dress the
[1:32:46] Holiness movement was on scene well
[1:32:49] before
[1:32:50] that just common decent living was on
[1:32:53] scene before that that was not the point
[1:32:56] of the Angel's
[1:32:59] message
[1:33:01] yeah the point of the Angel's message
[1:33:04] was to deliver truth to produce truth so
[1:33:07] that we may receive the whole truth the
[1:33:10] major truth the truth that Jesus
[1:33:13] had I come from the father and I'm going
[1:33:17] back to the
[1:33:19] father as the musicians would please
[1:33:24] come I'm going to read you two portions
[1:33:26] of scriptures quickly as they would come

[1:34:43] go and pray unto me and I will hearken
[1:34:45] unto you and you shall seek me and find
[1:34:47] me when you shall search for me with all
[1:34:49] your heart and I will be found of you
[1:34:51] you there's two people in this scripture
[1:34:55] I and

[1:34:59] Lord and I will turn away your captivity
[1:35:02] and I will gather you from all the
[1:35:04] nations and from all the places whether
[1:35:06] I have driven you have you found
[1:35:08] yourself driven in life have you found
[1:35:10] yourself someplace that was not
[1:35:12] recognizable did you find yourself some
[1:35:15] place that was not
[1:35:17] comfortable has something came along and
[1:35:20] made you realize I don't belong in this
[1:35:22] position that I'm in right now there is
[1:35:25] something drawing me there is something
[1:35:27] calling
[1:35:28] me this was I I the Lord was doing this
[1:35:33] amen I will be found of you I will bring
[1:35:37] you again into the place which I caused
[1:35:40] you caused you to be carried away
[1:35:47] captive we find ourself carried away
[1:35:52] captive in a hybrid
[1:35:55] condition but he
[1:35:58] says after a certain time
[1:36:00] period it says 70 years to Israel I'll
[1:36:03] say seven Church ages to the
[1:36:05] Gentiles after this time period I am
[1:36:09] going to hear your call and I am going
[1:36:12] to come get you whoever this you is is a
[1:36:17] real special person they ought to be the
[1:36:21] happiest you on the face of the
[1:36:24] earth I God is going to come and find
[1:36:28] somebody because this is the word of God
[1:36:31] and it was forever settled in heaven
[1:36:33] before there was a speck of Stardust and
[1:36:36] he said to
[1:36:38] somebody I'm coming to get you yeah amen
[1:36:44] Lord after a certain time period I am
[1:36:48] coming to get
[1:36:50] you
[1:36:52] and I am going to bring
[1:36:55] you
[1:37:00] again again means you were somewhere
[1:37:05] before I will bring you again into the
[1:37:09] place which I caused you to be carried
[1:37:11] away captive
[1:37:13] from you say well why did he allow me to
[1:37:16] be carried away captive from because he
[1:37:19] had to express himself brother Bron said
[1:37:23] he needed to express himself as a savior
[1:37:25] and he had some part of him come out
[1:37:29] into a
[1:37:31] manifestation of
[1:37:34] people that would somehow believe I find
[1:37:38] myself in this condition but this is not
[1:37:41] where I'm originally from and I'm now
[1:37:43] going to accept the way back that has
[1:37:46] been presented to me by an Angel
[1:37:48] messenger I am going to identify myself
[1:37:51] with that angel
[1:37:53] messenger and believe what he says to be
[1:37:55] true about my heavenly
[1:37:59] father I will bring you again into the
[1:38:03] place whence I caused you to be carried
[1:38:06] away
[1:38:08] from and we're going to close with this
[1:38:11] Psalm
[1:38:13] 139 to the chief musician a Psalm of
[1:38:16] David oh
[1:38:18] Lord thou Hast searched me
[1:38:21] and known
[1:38:26] me this was prior to
[1:38:31] 2023 thou Hast searched me and thou Hast
[1:38:35] known
[1:38:37] me thou knowest my Downs sitting and my
[1:38:41] Uprising thou understandest my thought a
[1:38:44] far off thou compassest my path and my
[1:38:48] laying down and art equ Ed with all my
[1:38:55] ways for there is not a word in my
[1:38:57] tongue but lo oh Lord thou knowest it
[1:39:00] altogether thou Hast beset me behind and
[1:39:03] before and laid thine hand upon me such
[1:39:06] knowledge is too wonderful for me it is
[1:39:09] high and I cannot attain
[1:39:12] it I'll admit that but I'll also admit
[1:39:15] it's still
[1:39:17] true this knowledge I may not be able to
[1:39:20] attain to
[1:39:21] this terminology the full context but
[1:39:24] it's still true and he knows me and he
[1:39:28] knows when I sit down and he knows when
[1:39:30] I get up and he knows when I lay down
[1:39:32] and he knows when I arise and he knows
[1:39:34] all the paths that I've taken and will
[1:39:36] take yes
[1:39:39] amen whether shall I go from thy Spirit
[1:39:42] or whether shall I flee from thy
[1:39:44] presence if I Ascend into heaven Thou
[1:39:46] Art there if I make my bed in hell
[1:39:49] behold Thou Art there if I take the
[1:39:51] wings of the morning and dwell in the
[1:39:52] uttermost part of the sea even there
[1:39:54] shall thy hand lead me and thy right
[1:39:56] hand shall hold me if I say surely the
[1:39:59] darkness shall cover me even the night
[1:40:01] shall be light about me yay the darkness
[1:40:05] hideth not from thee but the night
[1:40:07] shineth as the day the darkness of the
[1:40:09] light are both alike to thee if thou
[1:40:11] possessed my reign thou Hast covered me
[1:40:13] in my mother's
[1:40:16] womb before I was born you covered me it
[1:40:21] gets better hold on I will praise thee
[1:40:24] for I am fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:40:26] marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[1:40:28] knoweth right well my soul knoweth right
[1:40:32] well my brain may not get it but my soul
[1:40:36] knoweth right
[1:40:38] well marvelous are thy
[1:40:42] Works my substance was not hid from thee
[1:40:45] you say what substance I don't know what
[1:40:47] substance but my substance was not hid
[1:40:49] from him when I was made in secret and
[1:40:53] curiously wrought in the lowest part of
[1:40:55] the earth Thine Eyes did see my
[1:40:57] substance yet being
[1:41:00] unperfect and in thy book all my members
[1:41:03] were
[1:41:04] written
[1:41:08] amen which in continuance were fashioned
[1:41:11] when as yet there was none of them you
[1:41:14] wrap your brain around
[1:41:16] that when none of them were fashioned
[1:41:19] when none of them were made he he was
[1:41:21] still
[1:41:22] there and he wrote them in his
[1:41:30] book verse
[1:41:32] 17 how
[1:41:34] precious and this is if you forget
[1:41:37] everything that I've said tonight just
[1:41:38] catch
[1:41:39] this how
[1:41:42] precious and if you'll allow me to
[1:41:43] interject how
[1:41:45] real how precious and how real also are
[1:41:51] thy thoughts unto me amen oh God Amen
[1:41:55] How
[1:41:56] great is the sum of them as we would
[1:41:59] stand
[1:42:01] together I am here to self- admit that I
[1:42:06] don't know how precious they are and I
[1:42:09] don't know how great the sum of them are
[1:42:12] but the little bit that I can
[1:42:16] grasp as brother random says when you
[1:42:18] come down towards the end of the road
[1:42:20] these things just means so much to us
[1:42:22] Saints am
[1:42:24] amen Saints we don't have the promise of
[1:42:27] tomorrow we don't have the promise of
[1:42:31] tonight we stand here as the most
[1:42:35] privileged people on the face of the
[1:42:38] Earth to have a Vindicated not some
[1:42:41] sketchy Fly by Night person a Vindicated
[1:42:45] Prophet per the scriptures sent to me to
[1:42:50] reveal to us these things to reveal to
[1:42:54] us the thoughts of God to reveal to us
[1:42:58] where we come from and where we're going
[1:43:01] I challenge you and I challenge myself
[1:43:04] to let the reality of that be more real
[1:43:09] to us than ever I I say let it be more
[1:43:13] real than anything
[1:43:15] else if brother brandham says the
[1:43:17] thoughts of God are real and they are
[1:43:20] eternal and they are his word and it was
[1:43:22] forever settled in heaven
[1:43:25] amen let it be settled here on Earth
[1:43:29] tonight I will remind you when that
[1:43:32] seventh seal broke it was silent in
[1:43:36] heaven it was not silent on
[1:43:40] Earth you tell me where the seventh seal
[1:43:43] was
[1:43:47] at and don't get confused on that cuz
[1:43:49] the seventh seal is simply the coming of
[1:43:51] God Amen the seventh seal is a person
[1:43:54] yeah that's
[1:43:55] right and if it's silent in heaven where
[1:43:58] they angels and the cherubims are
[1:44:00] commanded to worship Him
[1:44:02] 24/7 and it's silent there but it says
[1:44:06] nothing about silence on Earth you tell
[1:44:08] me where he was at you tell me what form
[1:44:12] he took
[1:44:13] on I'll tell you that there was an angel
[1:44:15] sent to you to tell you what form he was
[1:44:18] in let's play
[1:44:22] precious Lord
[1:44:24] Jesus father we are beyond words to
[1:44:27] express our gratitude toward you
[1:44:30] Lord these things that we have
[1:44:35] spoken as the scripture says blessed is
[1:44:39] the man who even reads the Prophecies of
[1:44:42] this
[1:44:43] book father we do not have
[1:44:46] vocabulary to express our Thanksgiving
[1:44:49] to you
[1:44:51] Lord and we're not standing here as a
[1:44:53] hottie people saying that we know it all
[1:44:56] and we've got it all and that we don't
[1:44:57] need more and that we don't need you to
[1:45:00] continue to reveal the perfect
[1:45:03] revelation of this subject to us but
[1:45:06] Lord we will never back down on our
[1:45:08] gratefulness of what you have revealed
[1:45:10] to us and I pray that you would help us
[1:45:12] to walk in the fullness of what we can
[1:45:16] grasp not with our brain Lord but with
[1:45:18] our soul with the Eternal part of us who
[1:45:21] has heard this
[1:45:23] before and I pray that you would make it
[1:45:26] manifest in our life and we open oursel
[1:45:29] to you not to just anything Lord but we
[1:45:33] open oursel to you to further reveal
[1:45:36] truth on
[1:45:37] this we love you and we appreciate you
[1:45:40] and we believe you and we just offer you
[1:45:43] praise and thanksgiving for this night
[1:45:46] Lord that
[1:45:48] we somehow
[1:45:52] supernaturally can recognize in our
[1:45:55] soul who that you
[1:45:58] is who that me is who that thy is who
[1:46:02] that thou is to recognize who that
[1:46:06] angel was sent
[1:46:08] to father I pray as the prophet
[1:46:11] admonished us may we never take this for
[1:46:16] granted no way and Lord I stand here
[1:46:20] knowing that I have and I Repent of that
[1:46:23] and I ask forgiveness of that and I pray
[1:46:26] that you would help me never to do it
[1:46:28] again but may I may I give it the weight
[1:46:34] and may I hold it amen as valuable as it
[1:46:38] is help us father as we would leave this
[1:46:42] building we would ask your blessings on
[1:46:45] our pastor and his family as there a way
[1:46:48] that you would just bring them back
[1:46:49] safely and at the the appointed time I
[1:46:52] pray your blessings on this congregation
[1:46:54] father I pray that if there is one
[1:46:57] here that has not seen or heard their
[1:47:01] name in the book that they wouldn't walk
[1:47:03] out those doors until they have for it's
[1:47:05] here and it's
[1:47:07] available Lord even if it's in Isaiah 53
[1:47:11] just as a transgressor and they need to
[1:47:13] come for repentance and accept you as
[1:47:15] their savior
[1:47:17] Lord just in the what we would say the
[1:47:21] bare necessities and Essentials of
[1:47:23] Christianity to recognize that God had a
[1:47:27] son and he paid the price for our sins
[1:47:29] and our hybrid condition may they do
[1:47:31] that tonight and may you take that and
[1:47:34] and and water your water it with your
[1:47:37] word and your spirit and and begin a
[1:47:39] birth there and a growth there Lord and
[1:47:42] father for those that are farther along
[1:47:44] the road and have are moving from glory
[1:47:47] to glory I pray that you would move us
[1:47:48] to the next Glory father and that we can
[1:47:51] see ourselves as your bride and as the
[1:47:53] one that the the angel has been sent to
[1:47:55] but we need more father we've got to
[1:47:58] come to
