how great is our god how great is his word oh he's the greatest will oh you just put your trust in me oh how great is our god how great is his name oh he's the greatest [Music] [Applause] anointed ministry let's sing that verse again how great is our god how great is his name forever the same he's unveiling his treasures for those who will see [Music] and he said i'm going to give you anointed ministry oh lord [Music] try [Music] [Music] for you let's sing it again [Applause] [Music] r trying to [Music] oh is [Music] me let's just pray together precious lord jesus [Music] lord we just want to thank you for this opportunity that you've given us once again lord to come and to gather ourselves together around you lord the revealed word for our age lord we don't gather here around a man's idea or as a social event lord but we come to sing praises and to worship the one and the true living god lord and we're so grateful that the revelation that you have provided to us that we cannot come in vain and that we cannot just come blindly but we can come knowing what form you have chosen to appear in our age and that we can worship you truly in spirit and in truth lord we count that a great privilege and i pray that we would not take it for granted lord we would ask now as we would come to this part of the service that you would just come lord and do only that that you can do lord for the scripture says that no man was found worthy to take the book and to loose the seals lord but only little m was worthy father and we would ask now that you would come and you would take the book and that you would break the seals and feed your sheep lord we just commit all things into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you if you have your bibles we'll turn to the book of john chapter 10 and just greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ it's a privilege to be here with you this morning we're definitely sorry our pastor and his family could not be here we'll miss them dearly and we just pray that god will touch each and every one of them and restore them and just resolve that situation there that they can be back with us very very quickly just pray for remember brother emmanuel as well i'm assuming he'll be on his way back shortly from his trip so we just want to remember him and hold him up in prayer as well as we look here in the book of john chapter 10 we're going to start with verse number 1. jesus speaking he says verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber then if we'll skip to verse 7 then jesus said unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep and skipping to verse 15 jesus still speaking as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep skipping to verse 19. there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings and that's what i want to talk on this morning is these sayings as you would have your seats if we'll continue down farther in that chapter we'll go to verse 24. then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly jesus answered them i told you and you believe not the works that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because you're not of my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they will never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them to me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand i and my father are one then the jews took up stones again to stone him so as we would come to this portion of scripture we can see in the early part in verse 19 that jesus is telling them that i am the door to the sheepfold and there is division from that saying and then as he moves farther down in the same in that chapter verse 30 he proclaims that i and my father are one and there's an immediate reaction to that and it's not a good one it's not let's debate this farther let's argue with this um let's see what angle you're saying that from but jesus proclaims a statement i and my father are one and the immediate reaction is to take up stones and kill him first john chapter four if you'll turn there with me first john chapter 4. beginning in verse 1 it says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come into flesh is not of god there's no wiggle room there you can have all the spiritual discernment in the world and it's all lame right here in three verses how to discern what is of god and what is not of god if it is a spirit that proclaimeth that jesus christ is come in the flesh that is of god if it would take away from that or deviate away from that in the slightest it is not of god very clear definition going back to the book of john chapter 7 verse 37 john 7 37 in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water and skipping to verse 43 so there was a division among the people because of him and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him so i want to take those scriptures that we just read i want to talk i want to tie them to this quote out of the sea does not air with the shock 1965. brother branham said speaking here says jesus told us what would be in the last day it would be so close that they would deceive the very elected if possible but then the seed comes forth from there and the life leaves the shock and the shock is a carrier and that's just exactly what our denominations has been a carrier luther wesley pentecostal may i say message and now it's time for the seed to come forth mary was not the seed just a shuck tassel and stalk carriers of part of the word not all the word luther had justification wesley had sanctification pentecostals had the restoration of the gifts so you can see as brother branham speaking he's saying that they are shuck because they did not have all of the word luther wesley pentecostal if we don't think that there's been a message movement that does not have all of the world we're simply fooling ourself we have to understand the brother branham says every revival produces twins the bride's revival is included in that what is the bride's revival based around the message so we have to allow brother branham to say what brother branham says and whether it whether it's palatable or whether it fits our little box that we have or not we have to allow him to say these things and define these things so he's saying here that if you do not have all of the word you are shocked and he starts putting names to that luther wesley pentecostals but the definition that he gave to that was they did not have all of the word now they could produce that justification will save a man you believe that sure it was a carrier of the word just the same as i believe the stalk is part of the wheat sure it is but it's the carrier it ain't the life then along comes sanctification how many believes in sanctification you believe the bible you have to sure so still that's not it but then came the pentecost the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues there they called that the initial evidence which brought forth what the shock but they denominated but when you come to say i and my father are one and these other things then the shock pulls away from it but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of god in its fullness and in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever so brother branham is is preaching here and he is laying down definitions of what is seed and what is shuck what is seed and what is shock and he's given us a definition here that shuck is anything that is not all of the word but he also comes along and he says but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of god and the sentence that he said right before that is when you come to say that i and my father are one and these other things then the shock pulls away from it so that very very clearly identifies that the shock is incapable of the revelation i and my father are one i should have warned you before i started but i intend to go very slow today i intend to take my time and we're going to nail this down we're not going to get done today but my intention is to lay a very wide firm foundation we'll touch on a couple things and then we'll pick this up some other date lord willing but it's imperative that i lay this foundation because without it the rest of anything that i'm going to say is totally in vain in the church age book brother random says very familiar quote very familiar he knows speaking of satan he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church shuck and seed and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely sordid today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them the key to that was if they get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church this is the point that i want to make usually you save your point for last but i have to give my point first because if i don't give my point first anything that i say you're going to take it wrong the two spirits within the framework of the christian church is what we must be able to discern the question is what is the framework of the christian church and where do we put that at because here's what i'll tell you if you put that anywhere besides where you're sitting at this morning you've missed it and you'll continue to miss it if you put that antichrist spirit in another message church somewhere else because they don't preach a doctrine exactly like you see it you've missed it if you put that antichrist spirit somewhere in the economical world if i can see good working here bad working here you've missed it if you can put that in the political world of this person stands for this this is true this is right but this is antichrist because they're standing against this you've missed it if you can see that in the denominational realms you've missed it if you can see that in the ranks of the message congratulations you've still missed it if you can see that in the person sitting beside of you that's great it's still pointless you say well i would like some authority of that okay there were 12 disciples one of them was a devil two of them knew who that devil was the scripture says they all forsook him peter and john knowing who judas was still did not keep them the only thing that will keep you is the only thing that would have kept them and the only thing that would have kept them is what they got at pentecost a true revelation of themselves they got a true revelation of the antichrist spirit working in the framework of their church your framework is your soul your spirit and your flesh that is the framework within that framework there is seed and everything else is shock your hybrid spirit and your hybrid flesh is shuck one has to go and be no more one the atoms have to change the only part of you that is seed is the seed that is in your soul your hybrid spirit and your flesh will spend every waking and every sleeping moment of its life contradicting what your soul and what your seed is telling you that's its job it's hybrid it's of its father the devil it is the author of lies it is so crafty that it will do the same thing that the serpent did and the serpent when it came to eve remember it didn't come with a lie first what it did is it started building her confidence in him by telling her the truth telling her the truth telling her the truth and then there was a slight deviation your spirit realm will do the exact same thing to you it will agree with this message it will agree with this scripture it will agree with this spirit and it will agree with things for six days in a row just for one opportunity on day number seven to bring a slight deviation to that and if you have your eyes focused on trying to discern the antichrist spirit in the person beside of you within the ranks of the message within the ranks of the denominations in the political realm and the economic realm at the people at work you will totally miss that trap when it comes your way we have to bring the focus where it needs to be and in all reality just think about it for a second say you are able to discern all of that in all of those other ranks and in all of those other realms what good does that do you if you don't at the end of the day know who you are and if you can't say i and my father are one see you can say that person and his brother and his pastor and his mother they are not of the father and you may be right you may be right but how does that change your atoms what does that profit you what good does that really do you at the end of the day at the end of the day what good did it do john and peter to know who judas was they still forsook him judas went and hung himself it took care of itself it never profited john or peter to know who it was did jesus reveal it to him sure he revealed it to him but just because he revealed something to him doesn't mean that we need to hinge on that doesn't mean that that is the focus doesn't mean that that's the most important part what they needed to know was who they were that's what they needed to know and that's what we need to know because if we're going to do the greater works if we're going to be an invincible army if we're if we're going to do that it's going to be because we have a true revelation of the two spirits within our own framework we have to have god's spirit to discern ourselves you cannot use your own spirit to discern yourself because as i just said it will spend six days in a row discerning things correctly just to set you up for a slight deviation one day we have to allow god's spirit to discern the antichrist spirit within our own framework see if you had if you had just a pure human spirit there wouldn't be an issue with your with your discernment but we don't have a pure human spirit it's a hybrid human spirit it's already mixed brother branham said it it came and it came with a sensual nature your spirit realm your memory your reason your conscience imagination and affection is the author of lies it's of the father the devil it will deceive you every opportunity that gets and i assure you one thing that it will never say it will never say is that you and your father are the same it will never declare that to you your flesh will definitely never declare that to you romans 7 verse 12 paul speaking wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good was then that which is good made death unto me basically saying that the word is true but i can't keep the word so it's nothing but death to me he says god forbid but sin that it might appear sin worketh death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly sinful meaning the word is going to reveal sin making it very clear this is sinful for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin for that which i would do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that i do sounds like paul has a problem sounds like paul had a hybrid human spirit same as me and you if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me sounds like paul is discerning the antichrist spirit within the framework of the church for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would do i do not but the evil which i would do that i that i would not do that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me sounds like paul is coming to a revelation that his soul was not lining up with his spirit and he's got a problem with that and he's recognizing i want you to take another angle when we're reading the scripture this is not about conduct i'll say this this is not just about conduct this is about paul's revelation paul is wanting to have a revelation of something of himself and he's saying my hybrid spirit and flesh is not lining up with that because what my soul declares is good but my hybrid spirit and flesh is not lining up with that does that manifest itself in conduct sure but it has to start in the inner man for if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members notice where paul is placing this he is not placing this in the pharisees or the sadducees or the scribes or the whoever paul is saying i have got a problem i paul have got a problem o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from this body of death i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin moving to chapter 8 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit sounds like the light is starting to shine with paul he's starting to discern the within the framework of the christian church the two spirits for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god notice it does not say the evil mind or the wicked mind or the satanic mind it says the carnal mind your hybrid human mind that will lead you at work every day allow you to work allow you to reason and fought and solve problems allow you to have a memory so that you don't make the same mistakes again or that you know how to do something the next time that you are presented with that see it works it works good things all the time just so you'll start trusting it the same way satan says is it not written is it not also didn't he also didn't he say that you could eat of every tree it will build your trust in it just to let you down even if it's one time in your life even your hybrid spirit will allow you to place trust in it by acting correctly by acting good and by doing good things it will allow you to place trust in it all the way up until the point that you want to say i and my father are one even if it never even if it never lets you down before that if you're like me it lets you down way before that many many times but even if it would act let's say it this way even if it would be a good boy up until that time when it comes to that time it will let you down and that's the only time that it really cares about because it does not care what other revelation you have until you begin to have the revelation that i and my father are one that's when it realizes it has a problem and that's when it'll start saying things like well surely you won't die sure surely not surely you won't die because the carnal mind is enmity against god we just have to come to terms with that we have just got to become comfortable with that that within me lays no good thing for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be quit trying to convert your your hybrid spirit it's not going to happen brother brandon says it has to go and be no more it is not convertible it is hybrid it is of the father the devil and it will it is the author of lies so now i want to go back to where we started in john 10 verse 19 it says there was division therefore among the jews for these sayings this is immediately after jesus told them i am the door to the sheepfold now there's a division there wasn't a division before that and look at all the miraculous miraculous that jesus was doing look at everything that he said before that but now when it comes to john chapter 10 jesus makes a declaration and this declaration causes division all he said was i am the door to the sheepfold i mean that's a pretty simple statement he never even said anything about them he just said i am the door to the sheepfold but you see what happens is when you begin to say that you say the same thing that abel said to cain in the garden abel just told cain who he was and cain recognized that if what he's saying is true that means we don't have the same father and i would venture to say there was a bit of a division in the garden there was a division and i know there was a division because the reaction was the exact same to what jesus had as soon as jesus said this i and my father are one the reaction is always the same they pick up a stone and try to kill you that's what happened in the garden i would say after they got that's what happened when they got kicked out of the garden we know you understand what i'm saying that i'll put it this way that's what happened in genesis that's what happened in genesis that's what happened when jesus was here on the scene and that's what's going to happen in the book of revelation now we can know that and we can see that and we can say amen but unless you realize that your human your hybrid spirit and your flesh does the exact same thing to you it's pointless to see the rest of that because when you come to say i and my father are one your hybrid human spirit will immediately do the same thing and it will pick up a stone of its own revelation usually out of your memory and it will kill that revelation it will stone it to death and if it don't pick it up out of its memory back it will pick it up out of its reasoning back and it will reason that to death with its own stone of revelation from your reasoning if that doesn't work it'll go over to its little bag of conscience and it'll pick up a big rock out of there and it will kill that revelation that you and your father are one see you can see it back in genesis you can see it when jesus was here you can see it in the book of revelation but unless we can see it right here it does us no good we brother branham says said when you begin to say i and the father are one and these other things the shock will pull away now i'm not i'm not so naive to try to tell you all that there's not a denominational shock that there's not shock within the ranks of the message i mean we've seen those movements we've seen those things who cares who cares if the church down the road or if the church across the state or the church across the country is wrong who cares if you yourself are wrong what good does it what good does it do us to know if somebody else is wrong if we can't discern that we're wrong because brother branham says when you begin to say i and the father are one and these other things the shock will pull away and if we don't have the right definition of shock then the whole point the whole thing is pointless what difference does it matter if you say i and my father are one and the church down the road don't believe that if the church across the state doesn't believe that if the church across the country doesn't believe that if you're if the guy at work doesn't believe that what good does that do if you really don't believe it if your hybrid human spirit can talk you out of that can can reason that away from you can pick something up out of your memory and cause you to doubt that what good does it do you to know and discern everywhere else none so when we read that quote and we get excited yeah when i begin to say i and my father are one the shucks going to pull away yeah they're going to be exposed they're really going to get it then you've missed it i've missed it that's not the shock that we're concerned about pulling away because all of that can pull away and it still doesn't change your atoms just because everybody else falls away does not mean that your atoms change the only thing that will change your my atoms is the revelation that i and my father are one without doubt but a perfect revelation of that so when we read that quote and he says when you begin to say i and my father are one of these other things and the shock will pull away we have to bring that home and we have to make sure that we're putting that shock where that shuck is supposed to be and where it will do us some good going back to first john chapter 4 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god don't put those spirits somewhere else beloved believed not everything your spirit tells you believe not everything your mind tells you try your spirit try your mind try your thoughts whether they are of god because many false prophets many false sayings are going out through your mind they are going out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in my flesh is of god and every spirit that confess confesseth not that jesus christ has come in my flesh is not of the is not of god that's the discernment that we must have john chapter 7. we just read this i want to reread verse 43 early emphasis on verse 43 john chapter 7 the last day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me this scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water and then in 43 so there was division among the people because of him watch the reaction and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him they weren't taking him to take him out to lunch they weren't wanting to lay hands on him to say good message they weren't wanting to take him to invite him over for some fellowship he made a statement that if you're thirsty if any man thirst let him come to me by default what does that mean of them they've got no water see they didn't they wouldn't have had a problem if he would have said if any man thirst come but he said come to me they didn't have a problem if jesus would have said i am a way i am a truth i am a light that wouldn't have been a problem but that's not what he said and that's not what we can say you saying that will never convert anybody but when you come to say i and the father are one and these other things the shock will pull away not only will it pull away in your life but if you are trying to convert somebody at work at school at home you will never convert that person with any other revelation with i am a truth i am a way i am a life never work it is the way the only way the only truth and the only life that's what they had a problem with jesus saying and when jesus stood and said if any man thirst let him come to me that was the same thing as telling them who their father was and they had the same reaction we're going to lay hands on him we're going to take him out so now that we have what i would feel is a proper understanding of what we need to focus on where we need to focus [Music] where and who we need to be saying these other things too we can move forward but if we move forward without truly understanding without truly comprehending and without the focus being where it needs to be we're going to find ourselves in the same place that john and peter did even knowing who judas was we're just going to forsake our revelation we're going to flee from it we have to put the emphasis and the focus where it needs to be greatest battle ever fought brother branham says this first great battle that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven we're very familiar with this and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and satan came to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan came to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since it came from heaven came to earth and ended up where not in the political realm is it there sure do we care about that no not in the denominational realm is it there yes do we care about that no is it in the ranks of the message sure do we care about that no he says it begin in us and has been raging ever since the last place that the prophet put this battle was in me and you and he never said it went anywhere else don't by our own revelation and by our own knowledge that this message has given us don't try to take that and put the battle somewhere else it doesn't matter the prophet put it in me and you and that's where we have to leave it christ is the mystery of god revealed brother brandon says it's an individual one person all hell is against this teaching what teaching it's an individual one person all hell is against this teaching all hell is against this truth but it is the truth jesus never said now peter and john and all the rest of the people you've got the revelation now the whole church is saved no it was to him personally i say unto thee not them to thee thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church there it is the revelation not to them but to him an individual not a group an individual all hell is against it bring that present tense peter could have had the revelation of who was right and who was wrong within the ranks of the message who was right and who was wrong within the pews of your local church who was right and who was wrong within your own little house at home hell don't care hell does not care the revelation that hell cares about is in you as an individual ephesians two verse one and you hath he quickened who were dead in sin and trespasses wherein time passed ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we had our conver we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind where's the battle at in the flesh and in the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are ye saved so if you can see the antichrist spirit working in the economical realm and in the political realm and in the denominational realm and in the ranks of the message and in the pubic side of you and in your own local house congratulations it's only by grace you're saved and not in those realms don't get lifted up in that revelation because it's by grace you can see that and if you can see all of that and you still don't have enough grace to see it within yourself it will do you no good i have a certain amount of times that i have to say that i'm keeping count first corinthians 9 verse 26 i therefore so run paul speaking not as uncertainty so fight i not as one that beateth the air paul's saying i am very focused on what i'm fighting here i'm very focused on this race that i'm running but i keep under my body and bring it unto subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway even the apostle paul was preaching this get your eyes off everybody else get it to where the real battle is and fight that battle with certainty deal with your hybrid human spirit and deal with your flesh and quit worrying about anything else that's the shock that needs to pull away that's what matters all right we're 44 minutes in i've met my quota of saying that it will do you no good let's begin with with the first thing that that lays in the scriptures because brother branham says when you come to say i and my father are one and these other things the shock will pull away and we were very familiar with this quote and our pastor actually preached a message on these other things but it was several months ago he was ministering not not in that message that he titled these other things it was a different message but he's ministering he's preaching and he's and he reads this quote and he's he makes the statement he says i wish i would have he would have expounded and told us what those other things were because that's what i would be preaching and i'm sitting in my seat and i was like yes me too wouldn't that be great if he just gave us a list because that's what i would preach to and as i was sitting there i would just say a voice spoke to me it wasn't audible but a voice spoke to me and says he's already preaching it and he doesn't realize it and i know that wasn't my thought because my thought was saying yes i wish he would have left me a list that way i could preach it too and as that thought is coming this thought if you want to say overrides that and it says he's already preaching it and doesn't realize it no i don't say that so that you think i'm spiritual then i hear voices or whatever i'm sure we've all experienced those things but to me it was significant because god was trying to draw my attention to something we are doing something and not even realizing that we're that we're doing it but he's wanting us to realize what we're doing now he's wanting us he's wanting to draw attention to what are we really doing but that happened during that service and that was all that happened during that service he never gave me the list and he never told me how he was doing it and not realizing it so i was just as clueless as basically before i heard the voice but i just began pondering on that and i knew that if god would say something like that that there was a purpose for it and he's wanting to reveal something but god will do that this is just a little sidebar but i'm sure you all have experienced this god will do that in our lives and he will drop a revelation in there of something just to see what we'll do with it and most of the time this is just my opinion you take it for what it's worth most of the time i believe he's laying that there to see if we will force the issue he's laying that there to see if we will interpret that or if we will figure try to figure that out or if we will put our own definition to that because it would have been very easy for me to say okay well god said chad was already doing it he just doesn't realize it so let's go pull all the messages that chad has preached and let's figure out what he's what he's preached that are these other things see you can take a humanistic effort towards it and it'll do you no good but i didn't i just said well praise god he's doing it he doesn't realize it and i don't realize it but praise god we're doing it and if god wants us to realize something then he'll reveal it but several weeks went by and then i don't remember what i was doing but it just hit me brother branham says that when we when you begin to say i and the father are one and these other things the shock will pull away and when he says i am the father of one and these other things that is that is implying similar things it's implying similar things a similar statement i and the father are one and a similar statement the shuck will pull away it was just like a light bulb went off what else did jesus say that caused division and when that went off then it was right there it's all through the scriptures it was it was just like a flow chart number one luke 2 verse 46. when you begin to say i and the father are one and these other things the shuck will pull away we've properly identified what the real shock is that we need to be concerned about and this is not somebody else saying i and the father one but this is you saying i and the father are one that will and these other things that will cause your hybrid human spirit and your flesh to pull away from that seed luke 2 46 and it came to pass that after these days they found him in the temple speaking of jesus sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wisty not that i must be about my father's business from what i can tell these are the first recorded words of jesus christ that we have in the scripture of the human jesus christ from what i can tell this is the first words recorded that we have of him and in jesus's first words that are recorded in the scripture he says how is it that ye sought me he immediately corrects the error as brother branham told us he immediately corrects the error now here's what i want to tell you don't let my really large 45-minute foundation go to waste and leave this at mary or i'll go back and lay another 45-minute foundation and make you do jumping jacks while we're doing it don't leave this at mary he said unto them how is it that ye sought me know you not that i must be about my father's business brother brandt says what is the father's business we're going to get to that here in a second he says what is the father's business is to seek and to save the lost sheep and here comes me and you to jesus lord why is this happening to me don't you know that i believe your prophet don't you know that i've stood for your prophet don't you know that i believe this message and i've stood for it he says hang on how how is it that ye sought me this is not this is not what you have done you you've stood for my for my prophet you've stood for my message how do you even think you were able to stand for my prophet and for my message let alone the revelation that me and you are one how do as as we would say time out just time out for a second how is it that ye sought me no no know you not that i was about my father's business when i allowed you to have the revelation that i have sent a prophet when i allowed you to have the revelation of this message being true when i allowed you to have the revelation that me and you were together before the foundation of the world know ye not that i was about my father's business see we brother branham said when mary did that she denied her own testimony for the nine months before that or for however long before that i think he was what 12 years old at that time she come to that point see how i told you what your hybrid spirit will do to you for 12 years mary's hybrid spirit laid in agreement with that revelation that he was deity virgin born but then it saw an opportunity and it created a situation to where she was pressured she was a mother looking for a lost child there was pressure it was intense she was frantic she was rushed and it saw an opportunity i am the father of lies now i am going to have her run her entire testimony for the last 12 years of this being a virgin born son of god and i will make her run in in here and declare that joseph is really the father just like that most of the time when we deviate away from our revelation it's because we're under pressure and it's because we're rushed just like mary that's how deceptive your hybrid human spirit is remember it was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil it will lay in agreement of something for years just to wait for an opportunity to shatter the entire thing why does the devil care if you have the proper revelation for 20 years if he can get you to a moment before a crowd of people before the scribes and the pharisees and then manipulate your hybrid human spirit to make you confess something different you you think he won't wait 20 30 years for that one opportunity that's how fickle and how much distrust we have to put in our hybrid spirit and in our flesh none zero it will always lie to you every attempt that it gets that shock cannot handle the revelation that i and the father are one and that's the revelation that mary was declaring here because if she would have declared that jesus was virgin born what option do they have because it lays there in the scripture when jesus came and he says i'm that i'm born to my father they they knew what that meant they knew what that meant they knew that that meant he was god and that's what mary had the opportunity to declare here but her hybrid human spirit would not allow her to do it it will never allow you to do it it must come from the seed within and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wist ye not that i must be about my father's business so it did two things it immediately corrected the error and told me and you we had nothing to do with this and then it told us who had something to do with it questions and answers on hebrews 1957 father it is noted that when you were 12 years old you were found in the temple with the scribes and the sages discussing within the scriptures and they were astonished to see a little boy of about 12 years old explaining the scriptures you was about your father's business remember what we're dealing with here these other sayings the first one jesus declared you did not look for me i was looking for you and i am about my father's business now it's real easy to put a superficial revelation or a superficial interpretation of what the father's business is oh it's seeking and saving the lost sheep of israel but let's allow a prophet to tell us what the father's business is you was about your father's business you said to your mother knowest thou not that i must be about my father's business to explain the scriptures with their spiritual meaning your coworkers your friends your family they're okay with a superficial speaking of the scriptures god became flesh in the form of jesus he died for us on a cross we accept him as our savior we're now good to go but you realize that he was actually the word when he came there and it was the word that died for us and now in this day if we want to have that covering for a sacrifice of sins we have to accept the word have that conversation see if there's not some shock that pulls away see they're okay with a superficial interpretation but when you allow a prophet to interpret what that means it's totally different and now a prophet comes and says the father's business is to explain the scriptures with their spiritual meaning not just a superficial intellectual conception but to be about the father's business is to explain the scriptures with their spiritual meaning but i thought you said that brother branham says that the father's business is to seek and to save that which was lost he did how else do you think you are going to seek and save that which is lost without giving them the proper interpretation of the scriptures can't do it you may play on their emotions you may get a response you may make them cry you may make them jump you may make them scream he says to seek and to save that which is lost you cannot save that which is lost without explaining to them the spiritual meaning of the scripture can't do it it's one and the same thing i'm not just making that up saints what did peter do at the day of pentecost there's 3 000 of them there and he came out and he says this scripture right here is that that you're seeing what did he do he gave the spiritual meaning to the scripture and what was the outcome 000 conversions peter did not even tell them to go back up into the upper room he did not point them back to a cross to go dig up some dirt and get some blood peter took the scripture and gave the proper interpretation to it and they were converted don't think we're going to convert somebody any other way it's not going to happen and if we're doing it some other way it's not my father's business brother branham says if we discern the two spirits within the framework of the christian church if one of those spirits is god's what's the other spirit there is only two spirits don't sugarcoat it any other attempted method of conversion without the proper explanation and revelation of the scriptures for our day is anti-christ it is of the fought of their father the devil any other method any other way it is of the father of the devil because the father's business per the prophet is to explain the scriptures with their spiritual meaning 1964 they identified christ of all ages he said don't you know that i must be about my father's business see see if he had been about his father joseph business if joseph had been his father he'd have been making cabinet doors and things see but he was about his father's business straightening out the word for the come day you say well they're passing out bibles in africa they are doing mission trips in philippines they are that's wonderful that's good i'll say it like the prophet said it they're a good shuck leave them alone i don't and i know we chuckle with that but i i say that in all honesty i don't condemn them for that i do not condemn the shock for being a shock because the scripture told me it's only by the grace of god that i can even recognize that i'm not shocked so let the shock be a shock if there wasn't shock me and you wouldn't be standing here or sitting here this morning but if they're not straightening out the word for their day they are not converting people and they are not about the father's business the true father's business but if a shock is being a shock let it be a shock because that's a direct quote brother branham said that it was a good shuck you can't just do away with the shuck if you plant corn and cut sale of that coming up that shot kill it you're never going to have any corn let it be what it is and that's what i say we can recognize good and bad within the economical realm within the political realm within the denominational realm within the ranks of the message i'm not fighting against that if it's shuck let it be shuck if it's seed let it be seed it will manifest itself but that's what i say our focus has got to be off of fighting and discerning what is shock outside of the real shock that we need to deal with [Music] that's what we have to deal with that's what we need to focus on he was about his father's business straightening out the word for that day who's to say that they're shocked doing a work right now laying a foundation for somebody to go and to straighten out the word for the day to that individual who's to say that that the shock hasn't given that person a bible to where they have a mechanical understanding of the scriptures and of who jesus is and of the history so that you have something to work with when you get there to straighten out the scriptures for the day leave the shock alone saints leave it alone it is a good shock as paul said you know they they got on the paul you know there's these other people over here they're preaching the gospel but they're doing it for filthy luker he said leave them alone just leave them like if they preach the gospel leave them alone if they're not fighting against us they're for us just leave them alone leave them alone if they want to preach the message and put their own interpretation to it leave them alone maybe somebody will just hear that there's a message maybe somebody will hear that there's god has sent a prophet maybe they don't come to the fullness of the revelation maybe they don't preach the fullness that i and my father are one leave them alone let them preach what they're going to preach it's not going to hurt a seed it's not going to hurt a seed and who's to say that there's not shuck laying a foundation for another seed to come along and straighten out the scriptures to that seed don't fight that battle saints it's worthless it's pointless it's i'm going to go over my quota but i'm going to say it again there's no point in that that's not the battle that's not where it's at it did john and peter no good it'll do you no good deal with this shock straighten straighten out the scriptures with this shock and then worry about the other shock watch the word is always corrective 1964 the voice of the sun that little 12 year old boy never a day in school as we know of just a child he never knowed it he never know he said it perhaps this was so profound to me i'm not going to take a lot of time on it but brother brandon says when jesus made that statement he may not even know what he was saying he's just a 12 year old boy he never knowed it he said it perhaps but watch what he said know ye not that i must be about my father's business and he is the word today he is the same yesterday today and forever no ye not if he had been about joseph business he'd have been making carpenter business but he was about the father of the heavenly father's business he was out there another definition coming he was out there busting up them organizations they had out there and all that scrupled it he was tearing it to pieces well brother benjamin you just told us not to worry about busting those up not to be worried about fighting them not to be focused on them yes live the life it'll bust them up every day live the life deal with this shock get the revelation i and the father are one and these other things in here it will bust up your own denomination it will tear it to pieces so yes by all means deal with the the denominational spirit but deal with it in yourself tear it to pieces bust it up with the appropriate revelation for the word of your day he was about the heavenly father's business he was out there busting up them organizations they had up there and all that scrupled it up he was tearing it to pieces now like i said i'm not so naive to believe that there's not repercussions and there's not things that happen when we live a life and when we say things and when we just deal with ourself there are repercussions and there are ripple effects to that god sent a worldwide ministry through a prophet that tore those denominations to shreds and he did not mince words about it but don't think for a second that that was his focus and that's what he cared about what he cared about was the sheep in there and the only way to get the sheep in there was to bust up everything that was around them so that they would recognize the fallacy in it he wasn't doing it so that he could say you're wrong i'm right he was not don't think that he was taking any glory in that don't think that he would enjoy that process he would preach as hard as he could and then he'd be bawling at the end of the service but he knew the only way to get to a sheep in there was to bust that up so we have to make sure our motive and our objective is right when even when we're going after a seed and that's why i spent 45 minutes laying that foundation is i can come here and i can preach this and it will be true but if i preach it with the wrong spirit and with the wrong motivation and i preach it with the motivation to show somebody else is wrong and that i'm right or that we as a church are right and there's another church that's wrong you've missed the boat saints we have missed the boat you can say what is right and what is true and what is actually and even be according with the scriptures and if you say it with the wrong spirit and with the wrong motivation you're wrong you're wrong that's why we have brother bran says all hell is against the revelation to the individual we have to deal with the individual we have to deal with ourselves and then whatever god chooses to have as ripple effects from that then so be it but if that's our focus and that's our motivation is to deal with somebody else or deal with another church or deal with the person sitting beside of us we've missed the boat we have to say what's right with the right spirit and with the right motivation the seed is not air with the shock 1965 or just proving the denominations has been carriers that's another one of the father's business to prove and the father's business now is to show you that them denominations is not his they're a man-made system that denies the word don't put that out there the father's business is to show you that your own mind your own man-made thoughts and interpretations is not his they are man-made and they will deny the word even if it agrees with it for years intellectually when this pressure comes and when when it gets intense and when you get in a rush it will wait for that opportunity to deny the word brother branham says his business is to show that those are just carriers they're just carriers what is your flesh what is your your spirit it's a carrier of the seed if you did not have your flesh and you did not have your your spirit what's going to pack your seed around i it's just that simple saints it's a good shock it's been permitted by god not his perfect will his permissive will but it's a good shock it has to be there to carry the seed but as paul said i die daily and i bring into subjection this body and this mind this spirit to the true interpretation of the word so it's a good shock it'll carry this seed brother around says he's got no hands but my hands no feet but your feet no mouth but our mouth it's a good shock if if it's about the father's business and your seed your seed the true you your heart your soul your seed whatever the germ of life of god so zooey life the holy ghost within you whatever terminology you want to put on it that has to bring your shock into subjection and all brother bran says all of the life has to be sapped out of that shock and go into the seed for it to be worth something all right here comes the bombshell quote 1965 the seed does not air with the shuck the word yet young spake for itself and know not that i must be about my father's business quoting jesus there is the secret of the message now wouldn't that make a title there is the secret to the message i know i've got everybody's attention now i am about to tell you the secret of the message there is the secret of the message now just exactly the father's business what is the father's business this is a good question right this is the secret of the message you say well i thought the thunders were the secrets of the message they are they're the father's business i i thought the seals and the trumpets and they are they're the father's business what's the father's business revealing you to you he says what is the father's business could you think of what the father's business was in him speaking of jesus to fulfill what isaiah said think hard brother branham says the father's business which is the secret of the message the father's business to jesus was to fulfill what isaiah said about him a virgin shall conceive fulfill what isaiah said again the lame shall leap as a heart and all these things that would take place like moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet among you liken unto me it was the father's business to fulfill the word [Music] that's the secret of the message so you can have whatever whatever intellectual conception and knowledge store up you want to have about the message and you can quote whatever you want to quote and verbatim not verbatim page number paragraph message here whatever if you're not fulfilling the word you're not about the father's business and you don't have the secret of the message that's the prophet's definition not mine it was the father's business to fulfill the word well if that came down through them stalks of those natural women speaking of the natural lineage of jesus tamar and uh down through down through mary that natural energy says if it came through them what about the stalks of these spiritual women church women luther methodist wesley pentecostal you understand we must be about the father's business the wheat would cry back to the grain the wheat would cry back to the grain who is he speaking of here us and the father the wheat would cry back to the grain what must it do now watch what he does here vindicate malachi 4 vindicate luke 17 30. vindicate hebrews 13 8 vindicate saint john 14 12 vindicate all of his word vindicate revelation the 10th chapter the opening of the seventh seals and the mysteries of god what is the secret of the message to be about the father's business what is the father's business to fulfill the word what would the wheat cry back to the grain what must we cry back to the father we must vindicate malachi 4. luke 17 30 hebrews 13 8 watch what he did there he changed his terminology he went from fulfill to vindicate he's not playing with words saints there is a huge difference between fulfillment and vindication he says what must we do we must vindicate malachi 4. i thought malachi 4 was brother branham it was in fulfillment but we must vindicate that we must vindicate luke 17 30. you say well i thought that was the son of man ministry and brother random it was but we must vindicate that not re-fulfill it not re how many ministers have we seen try to re-fulfill malachi 4 and be that messenger that's not the father's business brother branham says the father's business was to vindicate malachi 4. not re-fulfill it i'm going to read you these definitions so you can see where i'm going fulfill means to bring to completion or reality fulfill to bring to completion or reality to vindicate something is to clear something or someone of blame or suspicion to show and to prove to be right reasonable and justified brother branham said the secret of the message was to be about the father's business and the father's business was to fulfill the word of god and then he gives us our instructions of what we must do to be about the father's business and he says our instructions are to vindicate malachi 4. to vindicate luke 17 30. to vindicate hebrews 13 8 saint john 14 12 all of his word revelation 10 7 the opening the seals and the mysteries of god i'm going to make it real plain for you saints we know there's an attack on this message we know there's an attack on the prophet there's an attack on the cloud there's a tackle on this vision there's a tackle on that vision there's attacked on this situation we are not to try to re-fulfill those things we are to vindicate and to clear and remove all suspicion or false blame and to show and to prove that which has been said to be right reasonable and justified and here's the thing we're to do that without ever uttering a word because if you utter a word they can utter more words if you argue they can argue back if you get facts and figures and clippings and whatever else they can get more what they can't argue with is the vindication of a lived life because deep down in their heart they will know i can argue all that i want to but you know what they'll never say this they're incapable of saying this because if they say this they declare that you and the father are one and if they say that then they are to automatically declare what their father is but what they will never tell you is you know what that person's got something i don't have and it lines up with what that man said that they call as a prophet and when you vindicate that you remove all suspicion and blame from that ministry that god sent us is there blame on that ministry absolutely is there suspicion about that ministry absolutely don't kid yourself are you going to intellectually ration uh rationalize that and figure that out with those people that are unbelievers no they're unbelievers saints that's what they do they unbelieve we're believers we believe brother branham did not tell us that we needed to re-fulfill those things he did not tell us that we needed to go get facts and figures to show that the fulfillment of those things were accurate he said vindicate it vindicate it how do we vindicate it we live it and when we live it even if they'll never acknowledge it they will know deep down inside they've got something i don't have and it matches what that man said and it matches what those scriptures say but if they are who they say they are and i don't line up with that i don't like the position that puts me in when you begin to say i and the father are one and these other things what are these other things we're only going to get to one or two out of 20. what are these other things to explain the scriptures with their appropriate spiritual meaning i challenge you to do that without uttering a word i challenge you to do that without uttering a word be about the father's business bust up your own denominational thinking tear it to pieces be about the father's business vindicate revelation 10 7. we've talked about revelation 10 7 for how long for how many years how many services how many messages have we preached about revelation 10 7 why don't we vindicate revelation 10 7. we don't need to refulfill revelation 10 7 we don't need to reemphasize who revelation 10 7 was we need to vindicate it with a lived life vindication is much much different than fulfillment and vindication is required by god the fourth seal 1963 vindication is so important vindication of the scriptures is so important to god that he ensures he has it himself god vindicated brother branham we know that god vindicated him but what brother branham said has to be vindicated by a people that he said it too and god cares about this so much watch what brother branham says 1963 fourth seal life followed the rider on the white horse speaking of the truth of the true horse the true white horse rider christ who was the word life vindicated by his resurrected saints that he had with him he says when christ comes riding on that white horse not exactly horses his name is the word of god and he is life he's bringing life with him and he is vindicated it does him no good to have the title of the word of god if there's no vindication but it's so important to christ that he is vindicated as the word of god that he comes with his vindication his resurrected saints your lived life is so important to god that that is what he rides on when he returns as his vindication don't put that future tense are you allowing him to vindicate the true and accurate interpretation of the scriptures that we know as this message through your lived life by having a perfect revelation that i and the father are one and these other things and causing your own shuck to pull away destroying your own ideas in your own mind are we allowing him allowing him to ride in our life by doing that don't put that future tense he's come riding on that right now he's looking to ride on that right now he is looking for vindication you say well he's god he's who what does he care he's god he don't care whether somebody believes him or not no god cares god cares about vindication i'll say that that's what he cares about most and he's not needing to vindicate it to make himself feel good saints he's not doing it for self-esteem but that's his business is to explain the scriptures to live the scriptures with their true spiritual meaning he cares about that so much so that he would choose that as his vehicle to come in in this last day not coming in to come in present tense resurrected saints that he had with him now how is the battle to go jesus said he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die what did he just say before that how is this battle to go are we catching at saints where are the battles at where he's wanting to ride at where he's riding at is the same place that the battle is taking place it's in me and you how is this battle to go and then he starts quoting scriptures he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die again he said he that believes in me i will give him eternal life i will raise him up in the last days that's his promised scripture here comes satan with all four corners of the earth with his protestants and with his catholics and all together mark with his protestants and his catholics don't leave it all in catholics remember what i said earlier any type of attempted conversion without the appropriate interpretation of the scripture is not of christ call it protestant if you want you may be protesting the catholic church but you're still in line with protesting christ don't tell them they're okay saints they're not okay just because you define withstand and don't agree with the catholic church does not make them okay tell them the truth explain the scriptures with their appropriate meaning or they're just going to be a protestant and look who satan's writing protestants and catholics there's no gray area it's either christ or it's antichrist it's either i and my father are one or it's serpent seed it's it's not i don't want to make that statement it's not surprising we know there's a group that's granted in it's antichrist you understand the true interpretation of the scripture for our day is not a gray area and nothing else will work not for us not for anybody else satan is riding on protestants he is riding on catholics and altogether marching right up to the battle of armageddon all right and here comes jesus coming down from heaven with resurrected saints vindicated word what is the secret of the message to be about the father's business what is the father's business to vindicate malachi 4. if you look real closely in that chapter there's more than i will send you a prophet there's some children in that chapter who's those children who's going to vindicate the children we spend so much time focusing on vindicating the messenger we forget to vindicate the children with resurrected saints vindicated word i said if god speaks continuing in the fourth seal if god speaks or sends you he backs up what you say see notice if you're an ambassador from heaven all heaven is behind you and heaven is consisted of the word notice now he's come he said it not me he did not say he's coming he said notice now he's come with resurrected saints vindicating that his word is true there's two errors that we can make with that we can make those we can make that future tense that he's coming with resurrected saints that's one error and we can make those resurrected saints people that have already died and are coming back if you do that you're in error and you will never be able to declare that you and the father are one he's come right now with resurrected saints you say well i haven't died yet that's your problem you haven't died if you'll die he can resurrect you and then he can ride on you and he can vindicate and prove his word [Applause] let the shock pull away you say well i see the fallacies and denominations nope wrong shock i'm not going to rehash that i think you all get the point number two we're going to stop with this one because we're already an hour and a half in but if i can get two then like i said we've we'll deal with the rest some other time lord willing luke 5 17 and it came to pass you don't have to turn there you can just listen luke 5 17 and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of galilee in judea and jerusalem and the power of the lord was present to heal them and behold men brought in a bed a man which would take which was taken with a palsy and they sought means to bring him in and delay him before him and when they could not find by what way they may bring him in the house of the multitude they went up on the housetop and let him down through the the tiling with his couch in the midst of before jesus and when he saw their faith he said unto him unto him man thy sins are forgiven thee watch the reaction and the scribes and the pharisees begin to reason don't leave it in the scribes and pharisees reasoning you pack that around with you every day and your mind begin to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemy who can forgive sins but god alone but when jesus perceived their thoughts he answered said unto them what reason ye in your hearts whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk but that ye may know see god cares about vindication and watch who he uses to vindicate it a man but that ye may know what i just said is true i'm going to pick up this man and manifest it in his life so that you can't argue with it don't leave it back there but when jesus perceived their thoughts he answered and said to them what reason ye in your hearts whether is it easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath power up on earth to forgive sins he said unto the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise and take up thy couch and go into the house and immediately he rose up before them and took up one took up that whereon he lay and departed to his own house glorifying god and they were all amazed and they glorified god and were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things today this is the second instance in the scripture where jesus speaks and he says man thy sins are forgiven thee who is this the response is who is this that speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone jesus's response but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sin he said unto the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise and take up thy couch and go into thy house but that ye may know this is the second thing that jesus says after he corrects mary and says you didn't have anything to do with this was me i'm about my father's business the second thing recorded in the scripture that he says the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sin when you begin to say i and the father are one and these other things the shuck will pull away when you begin to say you have the power to forgive sins the shock will pull away you can tell your co-worker at work all the time that jesus christ 2000 years ago had power to forgive sins no argument tell them you have power on earth to forgive sins watch the shuck pull away and then deal with the real issue that every time that you even think that let alone mutter it your human hybrid spirit says no no no no no hang on hang on bag of memory last tuesday 1 15 at walmart all three remember then and you think you have power to forgive sins no no deal with the real issue the son of man in me i and my father have power on earth right now to forgive sins how by being about the father's business live the life and if needed explain the scriptures to them and by explaining the scriptures what will you do two responses there is only ever two responses to the true interpretation of the scriptures you will either set that person free from their sins or they will be judged by that [Music] it was the only responses in jesus day it was the only response in genesis it's the only response in revelation there is only two responses how are you going to forgive somebody's sins on earth today you live the life and then when they realize there's something different you explain the appropriate spiritual meaning of the scriptures to them and when they get a revelation that that is correct their sins which are many shall be forgiven how were your sins forgiven saints it's not some magic wand we're going to wave over it's the same way you were converted that they'll be converted the same way your sins will be forgiven is the same way theirs are forgiven don't don't sugarcoat it with them tell them the truth tell them the truth did sugar coating work for you how do we expect sugar coating and making the mallet message water down and palatable to save somebody from their sins it didn't work for you don't give somebody something to eat you wouldn't eat don't give them something that will do them no good give them the word live the life don't back up on it tear your shuck away let the seed shine forth and if necessary explain the scriptures to them but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins i say unto thee arise take up thy couch and go into the house first john 1 verse 5 then this is the message which we have heard of him and i declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin very common scripture very familiar scripture scripture put it in context here don't put it in history don't put it in future tense if we are walking in the light how many are walking in the light we have fellowship one with another who has fellowship one with another in this truth that we have revealed to us then why would we back up on the fact that we have the blood of jesus christ and we can cleanse people from sin did it cleanse you from sin why wouldn't it cleanse somebody else from sin if that power lays in you to cleanse your life why wouldn't it lay in you to cleanse somebody else's life if you tell it to them don't back up on that first corinthians 6 verse 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god but be not deceived neither fornicators nor adulterers sorry nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusing abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves or covenants or drunkens or revilers or extortionists shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you but ye are washed we are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god that sounds like forgiveness of sins to me how ye are washed you are sanctified you are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god john 6 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak to you are spirit and our life back to verse 11. in first corinthians 6 and such were some of you but ye are washed ye are sanctified ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god what is the spirit of our god the words that i speak unto you are spirit and they are life how are you how am i going to forgive somebody of their sins on earth i am going to give them the spirit of christ how am i going to give them the spirit of christ i'm not going to carry it around in a little bucket and dish it out i'm going to speak the word when you begin to say i and my father are one and these other things the shock will pull away i'm getting ahead of myself but one of these other things is unless you believe the words that i speak unto you you will die in your sin tell that to your hybrid human mind it'll take you way past walmart last tuesday in aisle three tell that to your hybrid human mind the words that you speak don't back up on that revelation saints if your hybrid human mind disagrees with it that probably tells you you should agree with it when you wake up and you look in the room in the mirror and you say these other things and you repulse and you want to put something over the mirror that probably tells you there's a truth there he's the father and author of lies he will resist that revelation every time that it comes unless you believe the words that i speak unto you say that to a co-worker they're okay with you talking about jesus saying that 2000 years ago tell them unless you believe the words that i speak i had a man ask me that point blank one day you're saying that if i don't believe like you believe that i'm not going to make it answer it truthfully saints don't back up on it don't wishy-washy with it it's either true or it's not true and it's not that you have to believe like me it's that you have to believe the truth it's not that you have to believe because this is what i say but search the scriptures see if they be so maybe that's one of those other things search the scriptures if i do not the works don't believe me you may not want to say that to your co-workers maybe they'll look at the works is it true or is it not true can we say these things are we ashamed to say these things your spirit and your flesh will make you ashamed to say that every time and if you if your own spirit and your own flesh will make you ashamed to say that every time don't think the person at the grocery store or your co-worker is not going to try to make you ashamed to say it but it's true saints and if we say it with the right spirit and with the right motive and it crosses a seed i'll say it like brother branham said it quickly it will spring to life because if somebody has the same father as you they have no problem with you saying i and my father are one because they just say oh yeah me too but if they have a different father they're going to have a problem with that saints i'll even say it this way if they just don't even have a true revelation of who their true father is they're still going to have a problem with it because i wake up and look myself in the mirror and i still have a problem with me saying that but that's why we have to let our shock pull away and we have to declare those things do not be afraid to say that i and my father are one do not be afraid to say those other things we are washed we are justified we are sanctified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of god john 6 63 gives us the definition of what the spirit of god is the words that i speak to you are the spirit of god they are life as we come to a close psalm 103 1-3 says bless the lord on my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases see the person at work is okay with you praying for their disease they will recognize something in your life that you can pray for them if they're sick and they will be healed how many how many can witnesses that we know that to be true the prayer requests come across the the desk all the time they recognize there is power there to forget to heal what is in their body what is wrong in their body but the first part of that verse says who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases huge step between somebody having faith in you to pray a prayer and touch the throne and heal their body but now the words that you speak unto them are going to forgive them of their iniquities it's the same power it's the same blood it's the same word it's the same spirit one goes right with the other isaiah 53 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities they go together saints you cannot have the healing of the body outside of the same power that can forgive somebody of their sins it's the same atonement it's the same word it's the same spirit don't get hung up on that the chastisement of our peace was upon him upon him and by his stripes we were healed church age book the roman church we're still dealing with this second saying of jesus christ that the son of man hath power on earth that forgives sin the roman church now has become a false prophet to us to the people because she has taken away the word of the lord she has taken away the word of the lord from the people and given her own ideas as to what constitutes forgiveness of sins she has taken away the word of the lord and she has given her own idea of what constitutes forgiveness of sins what brings the blessing of god and the priests have gone so far as to state categorically that they have power not only in life but in death notice he did not say that there is not a truth to the forgiveness of sins he simply said that they have taken the word of god away this is so simple saints catch it how do you forgive sins he says that they have given their own idea as to what constitutes forgiveness of sins but what did they do first they took away the word of god i'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but if they're taking away something and putting something in place and he's saying that's wrong then chances are what they took away is the answer how do you constitute forgiveness of sins by giving the word of god how else is the word of god going to be dispensed in this day and in this age how else give me another option besides you and me give me another option besides the revealed truth as we have it from a vindicated prophet give me another option of the word of god to forgive sins not their saints he says we do not look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest why do we look for that because that's what forgives us of our sins why would we try to give somebody else something else to forgive them of their sins besides the true word of god it puts us in the same category the roman church does is in we're taking away the truth and we're giving them some idea we can't do that philadelphian church age he speaks of this catholic preached he says a catholic priest told me one time didn't jesus say whoever sent you remit that they're remitted i said he said it whosoever sends you retain to them they're retained that's whosoever you forgive they're forgiven whosoever you don't forgive they're not forgiven i said that's correctly what it said he said then didn't christ give his church which we are his church the power to forgive sins on earth he certainly did i said now if you'll forgive them the same way that they forgave them i'll go with you yeah he said yes he said how did they how did they forgive them did they tell them go do anova or something or the way you do it no sir peter said repent amen there's the key repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost he did not deny that the power to forgive sins was present on earth today he says you simply have to do it the same way peter did it it's there it's true it's accurate and it's by the spirit of god it's by the true revealed word of god for your day again as i told you before we know these things these things have been preached we understand the truth behind these but let's make it to an individual you say oh yeah well if people will come to the knowledge of the truth if they'll see the truth no what if people will see you what if people will see you will they be forgiven of their sins do you live a life do i live a life that when people see me they can be forgiven of their sins or judged by what they've seen do we live that life do we recognize that we have that power it's not a fairy tale we literally have that power in a lived life and in an appropriate explanation of the scriptures for our day we literally have that 1956 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever brother says now let's go back and find out what's right and what's wrong the bible ought to be the solid foundation and i believe with all my heart that this is the unadulterated word of god and i believe that anything that's contrary to this is an error everyone understand that i do not believe now listen carefully i do not believe that there's any person in earth today that has power to heal the sick i do not believe it i do not believe there is a person on earth today can forgive sin as god would he said well that kind of just throws a wrench in what you just said for the last 10 minutes and god doesn't forgive your sins now and god doesn't heal you now he's already done it it's a finished work at calvary and our faith rests in what god has already done for us he's saying as paul said within me there lays no good thing i look how many people were healed with his ministry but yet he would come and say there's no man that has the power to heal you or forgive your sin okay well brother branham what have you been doing thousands and thousands and thousands of cases of people being healed with his ministry what he's declaring is i and my father are one and within me there is no good thing and it is what he has done it's what the spirit of christ has done it is what the word has done there is not a man me or you have no ability to forgive somebody or to heal somebody but the revealed word that is in us has that power don't let your shuck talk you out of that as the musicians would come 1963 the fourth seal paragraph 291 the antichrist the true bride doctrine and therefore he takes his own bride now and builds her up under a creed of his own i want to go really slow on this so that you'll catch it the antichrist refuses the true bride doctrine so we have a true bride doctrine and therefore he takes his own bride now and builds her up under a creed of his own so now i've got to switch these true bride doctrine creed of his own he makes her a denomination he gives birth to other denominations as quoted in this holy scriptures he gives birth to daughters she became just like her mother natural worldly denominational opposing the spiritual bride the word the antichrist refuses the true bride doctrine how many wants to have the true bride doctrine so now if you'll go back to paragraph 285 when you're reading this he'll tell you what the true bride doctrine is the paragraph just prior to that now the battle started in heaven it'll be finished on earth in the form of armageddon now let's watch and see it unfold and maybe we can unfold it what's he unfolding the true bride doctrine the battle of armageddon the lord help us right now to do this now watch it unfold the mysterious writer watch what he does now he opposed he refused to repent and go back to the original blood word the word became blood and flesh see he refused to go back to it it's antichrist he is opposed to the true word bride takes his own bride of creed and denomination let's back up and rehash this it's very simple we have a true bright doctrine the true bright doctrine is the word became blood and flesh don't put that two thousand years ago the true bride doctrine is the word became blood and flesh he says that's what satan has refused to go back to satan can go back to everything up to that and still be satan satan can go back to serpent seed satan can go back to water baptism in jesus name satan can go back to the oneness of the godhead satan can go back but and when he hits this true bride doctrine he opposes it what does he oppose the word became flesh and blood he is opposed to the true word bride and he takes his own he takes his own what he takes his own hybrid mind and flesh he takes his own shock he takes his own creed and denomination he takes his own intellectual conception don't leave it on him bring it home if we take anything other than jesus christ is come in my flesh we have accepted the satanic doctrine and we are opposing the true bride doctrine which is jesus christ is come in the flesh i and my father are one and these other things number one to straighten out the error and explain the scriptures with their true spiritual meaning number two i do have the power on earth to forgive sins by by proclaiming with a lived life the true unadulterated word of god don't back up on those things don't allow your shock to take that away from you separate from that shuck make sure our focus is on the right chuck make sure that we're not so busy dealing with other people or other things or other systems that doesn't see this true bright doctrine that we fail to be this true bright doctrine that we fail to walk with a perfect understanding that i and my father are one if you'll just play something softly please if you'll stand with me i want to read this last scripture before we close i want to watch i want you to see this is not a game saints there is no gray area there is not any room for kinda and sorta and maybe it's either you and your father are one or you're not right you have to have a father it's either one or the other first john 4 1-6 we've read part of this as we get we begin the service but i want to read the last two verses of that last three verses beloved believe not every spirit remember don't put that out there put it in here do not believe everything that comes through your mind but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesses confess it that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is the spirit of antichrist where did he say the battle was in us where do you think these spirits are going to be saying these things in us he said don't believe every spirit that speaketh to you check it by the word and every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is not come in my flesh is not of god and it is the spirit of antichrist wherefore ye have heard that it should come and even now is it in the world how could paul say that it's here and the seals weren't going to be broke for thousands of years to tell us who that white horse writer was because paul recognized it writing in himself he recognized it in himself that's he did not declare it's there he declared that it's here it's here he didn't declare it's there he declared it's here and now already is in the world ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you that it he that is in the world they are of the world who is they who are they your spirit realm your flesh realm they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them now when i say they are of the world they are in the world that doesn't mean that your soul the seed the word that is in you cannot resurrect them out of that but what i will say it's going to be on a daily basis because soon as you resurrect them out of that and bring them subject to the word they're going to try to go right back to laodicea it's a daily occurrence with me it's an hourly occurrence and i won't even say that with me it's a minutely occurrence they are of the world therefore they speak of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth the true bride doctrine and the spirit of error the antichrist doctrine how do we know that hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god anything that will tell you or try to convince you otherwise through your memory your reason your conscience your imagination and your affections and your hybrid flesh is of the devil and must be resisted the same way we resisted him back there in heaven and kicked him out the battle is now here in us and we have to kick him out the same way how do we talk about that battle in heaven and all i wonder how it would have been and what did with you since they weren't up there with swords they weren't up there with swords the battle in heaven begin with a jealous spirit you don't kill a jealous well i guess you could kill a jealous spirit with a sword people do it all the time that's not what they were doing in heaven they combated an antichrist spirit with the true spirit the true bride doctrine that when this jealous spirit of i will build a kingdom greater than that of michael that of christ when that spirit came in they resisted it with the true word of god no i and my father are one and these other things and that doesn't match these other things that's how we kicked him out there that's how we'll kick him out here you say well that's really shallow narrow and just leaves it all with me you're right don't put it anywhere else when you begin to say i and my father are one and these other things your shock cannot handle it and that's the only time that's the only shock that me and you need to be worried about praise the lord right i laid a really loud or a really long foundation there's many other things that he says we'll get to those some other time lord willing but that's two of them if you'll go and you'll look at the scriptures i'm sure you can find the other things but remember what those other things are they are things that declare i and my father are one and that causes a division from your soul and your spirit because your spirit is fallen what does the word of god do it divides asunder between the soul and the spirit let's keep the focus there and the rest of the shock will take care of itself don't even worry about it let's pray together precious lord jesus as we would come to this close of the service lord we've been lengthy father lord i pray that you would just bless the people for their patience and their attentiveness lord and their pulling on the word lord and i would pray that we would be able to take these things that you have laid so graciously and given us from a prophet to define and make clear these scriptures that we can apply them to our daily individual life i pray that we would take those and make them a reality lord that our focus would be where it needs to be lord and not trying to figure out something else or someone else but lord focusing on us the revelation to the individual of the individual may you give us the grace to do that lord we pray that as we would go from here that your spirit your word your your protection would just be upon us your blessing would be upon us i pray that you would just heal those that need healing lord that you would find those lost sheep of yours that need found we would just send your word and your spirit to do that which only you can do we pray that we would take these things lord and maybe they just manifest in our life we give you the glory we give you the praise and we thank you for truth lord in the name of the lord jesus christ we would pray the bride says amen god bless you brother o glorious victory that day he set me free my life is to praise it's a revelation of who to redeem his lost friend the [Applause] and this is god's great mystery [Applause] oh [Applause]
