[4:40] environment we live in
[4:42] we don't take them lightly anymore
[4:46] second peter chapter one i'm going to
[4:49] begin
[4:50] reading
[4:53] at verse one second peter chapter 1
[4:57] verse 1. simon peter a servant and
[5:02] apostle of jesus christ to them
[5:04] that have obtained like precious faith
[5:06] with us through the
[5:07] through the righteousness of god and our
[5:08] savior jesus christ
[5:10] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[5:12] through the knowledge of god
[5:14] and of jesus our lord according as his
[5:17] divine power hath given unto us all
[5:19] things that pertain into life
[5:21] and godliness through the knowledge of
[5:22] him that hath called us
[5:24] to glory and virtue whereby
[5:28] are given unto us exceeding great and
[5:30] precious promises
[5:32] that by these you might be partakers of
[5:34] the divine nature
[5:35] and having escaped the corruption that
[5:37] is in the world through lust
[5:39] and beside this giving all diligence add
[5:41] to your faith virtue
[5:42] and divert you knowledge into knowledge
[5:45] temperance into temperance patience
[5:47] and the patience godliness and the
[5:49] godliness brotherly kindness
[5:51] and the brotherly kindness charity for
[5:54] if these things be in you and abound
[5:56] they make you that you should neither be
[5:57] barren
[5:58] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[6:00] lord jesus christ
[6:02] amen let's just bow our heads and pray
[6:06] lord jesus we thank you father we thank
[6:09] you that we can gather and sing your
[6:10] praises lord
[6:12] that you put in us a heart of gratitude
[6:14] lord and a faith to believe in you in
[6:16] this day
[6:18] and god with thanksgiving we sing to you
[6:20] songs of worship and praise
[6:22] and now lord as we look with hungry
[6:24] hearts to the word we pray that you
[6:26] would come yourself
[6:27] and break the bread of life to us lord
[6:29] that you would feed us from your own
[6:31] hand lord that you would
[6:32] feed us on your word lord and help us to
[6:34] grow spiritually to be what you want us
[6:36] to be in this world
[6:38] and god we give you preeminence in this
[6:40] place and ask that you take your liberty
[6:42] and may your holy spirit move in the
[6:44] lives and hearts of all your children
[6:46] we ask these things in jesus christ's
[6:48] name amen
[6:50] you can have your seats keep your bibles
[6:53] open here to ii peter
[6:56] we this is a very familiar portion of
[6:58] scripture to us and i just want to look
[7:00] at it for just a minute
[7:01] and then go and look at other things
[7:03] associated with this
[7:04] but we see that we might be partakers of
[7:08] the divine nature from verse 4 here
[7:10] having escaped the corruption is in the
[7:12] world through lust
[7:14] and and beside this give all diligence
[7:16] add to your faith virtue so we know that
[7:18] there's
[7:18] there's going to be these uh seven
[7:21] virtues capped
[7:22] off by the eighth which is charity which
[7:24] is love and god is love so it's capped
[7:27] off by
[7:28] god himself and it's amazing that when
[7:30] we look at these
[7:32] virtues or we look at these attributes
[7:35] or strengths or whatever
[7:36] you can see that the building of these
[7:38] is actually building the character of
[7:40] christ
[7:40] amen the character of christ the
[7:43] character of god himself
[7:45] but in the face of each one of these
[7:47] virtues or each one of these
[7:48] attributes or characteristics you can
[7:51] say
[7:52] each one of these is best expressed in
[7:55] the face of adversity to the virtue
[7:58] so faith is best expressed in an
[8:02] atmosphere of unbelief
[8:04] and so god will always use the contrast
[8:06] amen
[8:07] the contrast to bring out his own nature
[8:10] and that's why the world has fallen in
[8:12] the condition it's in
[8:13] so that we can come into this world in
[8:15] this condition and understand god better
[8:17] because white shows up in the contrast
[8:19] of black i mean once you see the evil
[8:21] experience the evil then the
[8:23] righteousness stands out that much more
[8:25] because you've experienced
[8:26] unrighteousness
[8:28] and so we find out that we find now if
[8:31] as these things are expressed
[8:33] our god is wanting to express these
[8:35] things the greatest way and the best way
[8:37] to highlight the nature of god
[8:39] amen is to bring forth each one of these
[8:41] characteristics and the opposition of
[8:43] the characteristic itself
[8:46] so if we're going to express faith it's
[8:47] going to come in a world of
[8:49] unbelief virtue is when nobody has any
[8:52] more strength amen
[8:53] and when you have no strength in
[8:55] yourself then there's a supernatural
[8:56] strength that takes over
[8:58] amen in knowledge in a time when nobody
[9:00] knows god
[9:01] nobody knows about god nothing of god
[9:04] anymore
[9:05] temperance when the world is full of
[9:07] there's a lack of self-control
[9:09] an absolute utter lack of self-control
[9:12] amen temperance is expressed
[9:15] in patience when there is no more
[9:16] patience and godliness when there is no
[9:19] more godliness
[9:20] amen in brotherly kindness when there is
[9:22] no more brotherly kindness
[9:25] and then the capping off of charity god
[9:28] himself the very nature of god the
[9:29] capstone of love
[9:31] amen when there is no more love in the
[9:33] world
[9:34] and i think we've come to that place i
[9:37] think we've come to the place where
[9:38] the true nature of god amen the divine
[9:41] nature can be
[9:42] expressed like it's never been expressed
[9:44] before
[9:46] and opposition to each one of these is
[9:49] so heightened amen it's so
[9:51] it's so obvious that that the nature of
[9:55] christ stands out like it's never stood
[9:57] out before
[9:58] and so that's what god is calling us to
[10:00] to grow into this
[10:01] expression of christ the very nature the
[10:04] very
[10:05] characteristic of the word can be
[10:07] expressed in these virtues
[10:09] but i want to i want to look at a quote
[10:12] here that we read
[10:13] sunday out of the easter seal is but he
[10:16] that understandeth he that knoweth his
[10:19] place in this hour
[10:20] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[10:22] him that sent me
[10:23] hath present tense eternal life shall
[10:25] not come into the judgment but has
[10:27] already passed from death and alive
[10:29] then when this new eternal life dwells
[10:31] in you it is the potential
[10:33] or the earnestness of you being
[10:35] quickened from mortal to immortal
[10:36] immortality let me say that again when
[10:39] the spirit has found you the individual
[10:41] and has come upon you it is the
[10:43] potential of your eternal inheritance
[10:45] that god thought of you and made for you
[10:47] before the foundation of the world
[10:49] that is your potential life you ask me
[10:52] for an oak tree and i give you an acorn
[10:54] now the life for that oak tree is in the
[10:56] acorn now but you have to wait till it
[10:58] grows up
[11:00] further in the same quote he says now
[11:01] notice it's the earnest or the potential
[11:04] the quickening power of your
[11:05] resurrection
[11:06] when you receive the holy spirit is then
[11:08] dwelling in you the potential of it
[11:10] notice you are now on your way growing
[11:13] to the full resurrection
[11:15] so you're now on your way growing to the
[11:18] full resurrection
[11:19] no tree just comes up overnight it's got
[11:22] to grow
[11:22] as we grow in grace and knowledge of god
[11:25] you are baptized unto the holy spirit
[11:27] now as the pentecostal church baptized
[11:29] in the holy spirit
[11:30] it's begin growing limbs has died they
[11:33] was pruned them off but the tree is
[11:35] still growing
[11:36] it's still going on because it's got to
[11:38] come to the resurrection
[11:40] they're led by the spirit to quicken the
[11:42] word to you who is believers
[11:44] the word keeps quickening as you come to
[11:46] first limb second limb third limb on up
[11:49] it just keeps quickening the spirit of
[11:51] god keeps quickening to you
[11:53] so now we're growing to the full
[11:55] resurrection
[11:56] but we're growing as the word of god is
[11:59] being quickened to us
[12:00] because the word of god being quickened
[12:02] or made alive
[12:03] is bringing the change amen so now
[12:06] you know we we we come to this
[12:10] uh place where the seed is quickened
[12:12] alive amen it's the potential of the
[12:14] resurrection because we've already
[12:16] resurrected from the dead
[12:18] amen you were you were laying there as
[12:20] if dead amen
[12:21] the potential was laying there
[12:23] unrealized or unquickened or unsparked
[12:26] off
[12:27] but with the contact with god by the
[12:29] baptism holy ghost
[12:30] it sparked that seed off to life amen
[12:33] and now
[12:34] that that life begins to grow to the
[12:37] full resurrection
[12:38] amen and it begins to bring this outside
[12:40] life into obedience to the
[12:42] inside life it begins to bring the outer
[12:46] man
[12:46] subject amen to the inner man that's
[12:48] been quickened to life
[12:50] and he does it as he quickens the word
[12:52] to us so
[12:54] like i was saying it's the reason we
[12:57] go back and read the same book we've
[12:59] read
[13:00] and read the same scriptures we read
[13:02] amen because as we grow
[13:04] he keeps quickening the word and
[13:06] quickening the word and quickening the
[13:07] word
[13:08] and then what and what is it doing it's
[13:10] bringing the potentials out that is
[13:12] already there
[13:15] i put a title on this the full potential
[13:18] is in the seed
[13:20] the full potential is in the seed amen
[13:23] and so many times uh the like i said the
[13:27] denominational idea
[13:29] sometimes is a striving and a climbing
[13:32] and a working our way
[13:33] up into the stature of christ amen to
[13:36] the characteristics of christ
[13:38] and there's so much uh uh if i could say
[13:41] it this way there's so much humanistic
[13:43] labor
[13:46] if i could say that if you understand
[13:47] what i'm saying so much humanistic labor
[13:50] amen to labor to bring forth the
[13:51] characteristics or the nature of christ
[13:54] amen and there's nothing wrong with
[13:56] trying i i hope you don't take me wrong
[13:58] we should be trying
[14:00] we should be trying with all of our
[14:02] heart to live a clean life live a godly
[14:04] life
[14:04] live the way he wants us to live but the
[14:07] reality is
[14:08] humanistic effort will never make it
[14:12] it will never bring forth the full
[14:14] potential
[14:15] of the sea that will never bring us to
[14:16] the full resurrection amen
[14:19] because the humanistic effort the trying
[14:21] harder effort
[14:22] amen is going to create frustration and
[14:25] because there's nothing in the outer man
[14:27] that can accomplish this goal because
[14:30] what what we need is already on the
[14:32] inside
[14:32] it must be quickened by the holy ghost
[14:35] amen as he quickens word upon word upon
[14:37] word
[14:38] amen because the word comes to the word
[14:40] amen and
[14:41] lifts out of the soul the potential
[14:44] that's already there
[14:45] because what's laying in there what is
[14:47] that see gene of god
[14:49] it is a portion of god that god has
[14:51] predestinated to come to life
[14:54] and come to manifestation in this hour
[14:56] that we're living in now
[14:58] so god had foresaw all things and knew
[15:01] amen they knew what bedded what ground
[15:03] you would come to
[15:05] amen where you would be planted in what
[15:07] time you would be planted
[15:08] and so god planted a correct seed
[15:12] for the correct hour in time
[15:17] so so you you're not here wishing
[15:20] oh i wish i would have been alive in
[15:22] luther's day because you didn't have
[15:24] what was what god had planted in you
[15:27] amen was
[15:28] meant for this day to come forth in this
[15:30] hour
[15:31] and everything that is needed was laying
[15:34] in the seed amen
[15:35] it was laying there in seed form or gene
[15:38] form
[15:38] or attribute of god form but it needed
[15:41] something to bring that potential out
[15:44] and that something is the baptism of the
[15:46] holy ghost that comes
[15:47] amen and lights off and and brother baby
[15:50] says when the word
[15:52] lit the soul amen so what is the holy
[15:54] ghost it is the spirit
[15:56] of truth it's what the word says it is
[15:59] the spirit of
[16:00] truth i mean if it's the spirit of truth
[16:02] what is it bringing
[16:05] the spirit of truth is bringing truth
[16:09] and what is truth bringing truth is
[16:11] bringing the spirit of truth
[16:13] you can't separate those two things so
[16:16] now
[16:16] as the word for our age comes and is
[16:19] preached amen
[16:20] it is it is drawing the potential that's
[16:23] in the seed
[16:24] out to the surface that's why we keep
[16:27] laboring in the word that's why we
[16:30] haven't stopped
[16:31] because i don't believe i've come to my
[16:33] full potential yet
[16:36] and i hope you don't believe you've come
[16:37] to your full potential but i believe
[16:39] there's potential
[16:40] for a full manifestation of the full
[16:42] life of jesus christ
[16:43] i believe that with all my heart amen
[16:45] and so that's why we keep laboring in
[16:47] the word
[16:48] amen we keep laying before the lord and
[16:50] saying draw us up
[16:51] draw us up brother baby says in the
[16:54] message things that are to be
[16:56] if you love the world or the things of
[16:57] the world the love of god is not
[16:59] even in you see if you still love the
[17:03] if you still have the love of the world
[17:04] want to act like the world and do like
[17:06] the world
[17:07] yet you're in the church but a cockle
[17:09] burr and a patch with the wheat
[17:10] shout with the rest of them rejoice with
[17:12] the rest of them all the spiritual
[17:14] blessings is right upon you
[17:16] you say well i prophesied so did
[17:17] campuses so did balaam
[17:19] that has nothing i got the baptism the
[17:21] holy spirit that still has nothing to do
[17:23] with it
[17:23] that's just only a temporal gift for you
[17:26] the real gift is your soul
[17:28] down in there see that was born of god
[17:31] that controls the whole thing to the
[17:33] word of god
[17:34] and the will of god and there you grow
[17:36] up
[17:37] so brother man said the real gift is
[17:39] that soul down in there
[17:40] brother man is not saying that the holy
[17:42] ghost is not the real gift
[17:44] it's a real gift but he's referring to
[17:46] that k ephesus bunch
[17:48] the kf is his bunch who says haven't we
[17:50] done mighty works and aren't i the high
[17:52] priest and haven't we done this
[17:53] and brother bam said that's just a
[17:55] temporal gift for you
[17:57] for you this is the temporal gift amen
[18:00] but the real
[18:01] gift is down in the soul when that
[18:03] baptism the holy ghost strikes that seed
[18:05] in the soul
[18:06] and it connects amen when word comes to
[18:09] word when life comes to life
[18:10] amen and there's a connection and it's
[18:12] sparked off and comes to life
[18:14] that's the real gift is the baptism of
[18:16] the holy ghost on the soul
[18:20] amen so you can have the baptism holy
[18:22] ghost in the spirit
[18:24] but that's not the real gift and brother
[18:26] i'm saying it's not a real holy ghost
[18:27] that's not the real gift
[18:28] the real gift is down in the soul
[18:32] the real gift is your soul down in there
[18:34] see that was born of god
[18:36] and that controls the whole thing to the
[18:38] word of god
[18:39] and the will of god and there you grow
[18:42] up see
[18:43] then you're a son and daughter of god
[18:44] you're a child of god so
[18:46] there you from there you grow up that's
[18:48] what i want to emphasize there you grow
[18:50] up
[18:52] in the message it is the rising of the
[18:53] sun so now
[18:55] now if that spirit that raised up jesus
[18:57] from the grave dwells in you
[18:59] you potentially have life led by the
[19:01] spirit to quicken the word to you
[19:03] to believe it the little thing keeps
[19:05] pushing up as it grows
[19:07] brother keep saying the same thing amen
[19:09] it's quickened the life but it keeps
[19:11] pushing up as it grows
[19:12] it's quicken the life but it's growing
[19:15] it's quick in the life but it's growing
[19:17] to the full resurrection it's quick in
[19:18] the life but it's growing more in the
[19:20] likeness of christ
[19:20] it's bringing this outer man subject to
[19:22] the inner man it's
[19:24] growing within you as he quickens the
[19:25] word to you
[19:28] he says in leadership the choice of your
[19:32] conduct you can't mix it now
[19:34] you're either for god or against god and
[19:36] the outward expression shows exactly
[19:38] what's on the inside
[19:40] many of you think i got the baptism holy
[19:42] ghost i'm going to heaven that don't
[19:43] mean one thing that you're going to
[19:45] heaven
[19:46] no sir you can have the baptism of the
[19:48] holy ghost every hour in your life
[19:50] and still be lost and go to hell
[19:53] i would say that would be a temporal
[19:54] gift to you
[19:57] in that condition you can still the
[19:59] baptist only goes every hour of your
[20:00] life and still be lost and go to hell
[20:02] the bible says so uh that's exactly
[20:04] right look here
[20:05] you are a outside person you have five
[20:07] senses that contact the outside body
[20:09] god gave you five senses not to contact
[20:12] him your earthly home see
[20:14] see taste uh feel smell in here then you
[20:17] have a spirit on the inside of that and
[20:18] has five outlets conscience and love and
[20:20] so forth
[20:21] five outlets that you contact the spirit
[20:23] world with that
[20:24] but with your but with your spirit
[20:27] your physical contacts the physical your
[20:30] spiritual context is spiritual
[20:32] but inside of that you've got a soul
[20:35] and that soul is that gene that comes
[20:37] from god
[20:38] and like a baby formed in its mother's
[20:40] womb when the baby comes into the
[20:41] mother's womb by the little germ
[20:43] it crawls into the egg it doesn't form
[20:45] one cell a human
[20:46] the next dog the next a cat the next
[20:49] horse
[20:50] it's all human cells because it's
[20:52] building off of an original
[20:54] human cell and when a man has been born
[20:56] again by the word of god
[20:58] predestinated to eternal life called the
[21:00] elected
[21:01] it'll be word of god on top of word word
[21:04] on word
[21:05] not a denominational creed and then a
[21:07] word and a creed and it won't work you
[21:09] can't have that leave it in and
[21:11] only one eternal life jesus christ the
[21:13] word
[21:15] so the true seed amen when sprung to
[21:17] life it'll build
[21:18] word upon word upon word
[21:21] upon word and it won't be mixed with
[21:24] something else
[21:26] you see in order like we said last
[21:30] sunday in order to have a natural birth
[21:32] amen you have to have two of the same
[21:34] kind come together
[21:36] you can't have two of different kinds
[21:38] come together but when two of the same
[21:39] kind comes together
[21:40] you can have a birth amen and so now
[21:43] when we have two of the same kind come
[21:45] together
[21:46] so if the if the word of god is going to
[21:48] come and the spirit of god is going to
[21:50] come
[21:51] to bring a birth then what does it have
[21:53] to make contact with
[21:54] it has to be two of the same kind so
[21:56] there has to be word of god laying down
[21:58] there
[21:59] word has to come to word life has to
[22:02] come there already has to be
[22:03] life down in there it's already got to
[22:07] be there
[22:08] amen it can't get put there it has to be
[22:11] there
[22:12] and something has to come to it and the
[22:14] thing that comes to it
[22:15] has to be the same thing that it is
[22:18] it can't be dog and cat amen it's got to
[22:21] be dog and dog or cat and cat
[22:23] amen in order to bring forth it's got to
[22:25] be god connecting with god
[22:28] oh i hope that doesn't become common to
[22:31] us in a way that we miss the impact of
[22:33] that
[22:34] there has to be a portion of god laying
[22:36] down in there
[22:37] a sieging of god a peace of god has to
[22:40] already be there
[22:42] and it had to be there when you first
[22:43] come into this earth you it had to be
[22:46] there
[22:46] but it had to exist before then
[22:50] because it always existed it's a part of
[22:52] god
[22:53] amen it never uh if i could say this
[22:57] that peace that part that attribute
[23:00] i i don't know if there's an english
[23:02] word that can properly label what it
[23:05] actually is
[23:06] but that's something that come from god
[23:08] amen
[23:09] that did not have a beginning because if
[23:11] it has a beginning then it's not
[23:13] zoe then it's not god
[23:17] but there has to be something there that
[23:19] didn't have a beginning
[23:21] that was a portion of god that god chose
[23:24] to portion
[23:24] out amen so that god can become a family
[23:30] amen and that's what we want to talk
[23:33] about and focus on
[23:35] amen because if if that's a portion of
[23:38] god
[23:38] amen then what kind of potential is
[23:41] laying in that seed
[23:44] i mean sometimes you know
[23:47] as a human being we feel like the world
[23:50] is stacked against us and
[23:51] you know i i'm never going to attain to
[23:54] the level i need to i'm never going to
[23:55] get out of this
[23:56] trial i'll never have financial security
[23:58] and i'll never
[23:59] break forth out of this unhealthiness
[24:01] that i'm in or i never can get free
[24:04] from the bondage i can't break free from
[24:07] my past or out of my complex or
[24:11] i can never get over this hurt i can
[24:13] never get over
[24:14] this disdain in my past i can never get
[24:17] over this dark spot
[24:19] that's humanism but what's on the inside
[24:24] the potential to overcome everything
[24:28] everything that the devil did can be
[24:30] overcome amen by that potential that's
[24:32] laying on the inside
[24:33] amen everything that the devil's ever
[24:36] done all the way back to the original
[24:38] lie he told in the garden of eden
[24:40] can be overcome by that potential that's
[24:42] laying in there
[24:45] because that potential when the word
[24:47] builds on the word builds on the word
[24:49] it can grow to the full resurrection
[24:51] amen when it can grow to the full
[24:53] resurrection
[24:54] it can actually change what had happened
[24:56] all the way back in the garden of eden
[24:58] when hybridization moved in
[25:00] that hybridization can be changed by the
[25:02] potential that's laying on the inside
[25:05] but it's got to be quickened by the word
[25:07] and quickened by the word and quickened
[25:08] by the word and word builds on word
[25:10] builds on word
[25:11] and grows into the full resurrection
[25:15] so we can't keep looking at outside
[25:17] factors
[25:20] if if we could just all dial in we've
[25:23] got to quit looking at outside
[25:24] factors as as impossibilities to
[25:28] overcome
[25:30] and we've got to quit looking at past
[25:32] mistakes and past failures
[25:34] amen as inevitable to repetition
[25:39] that's humanism that's human thinking
[25:42] we've got to stop because what we're
[25:43] doing is we can't see
[25:45] past our human life and we can't see
[25:48] past our human eyes
[25:50] and our human memory and our human
[25:52] reasoning and our human affections
[25:55] it's just the spirit realm and we stay
[25:57] bound down from reaching our full
[25:59] potential
[26:00] and we're bound by the by the spirit
[26:02] realm
[26:03] in our memory reasoning affection
[26:05] consciousness
[26:09] and we remember what it was like every
[26:12] time i
[26:12] i tried this and failed and tried this
[26:14] and found tried this and failed
[26:16] and so we reasoned that i shouldn't try
[26:18] it again and fail because it hurts too
[26:20] bad
[26:22] it's embarrassing i've been wounded i've
[26:24] been hurt
[26:25] i've failed and so now now my memory of
[26:29] what i've done but
[26:30] in the past and the affection
[26:34] the pain that it caused me i'm now
[26:38] using reasoning to try avoid
[26:41] to grow and move forward because of
[26:43] what's happened in the past
[26:49] that's where we all live
[26:52] but if we can quit looking at the man in
[26:55] the mirror
[26:56] if we can quit looking at the
[26:58] hybridization and the outer man
[27:01] and say if if
[27:04] god lives in me if
[27:07] god lives in me what can defeat god
[27:11] what can hold god back what can stop god
[27:14] from overcoming history
[27:16] complexes failures false obstacles that
[27:19] are insurmountable
[27:20] what can stop god the red sea couldn't
[27:22] stop him the overflowing jordan couldn't
[27:24] stop him
[27:25] amen nebuchadnezzar couldn't stop him
[27:28] what could stop him
[27:29] amen amen nothing could stop him
[27:33] thousand thousand demons released out of
[27:35] euphrates can't stop him
[27:37] and then lucifer couldn't stop him in
[27:39] the war in heaven nothing can stop him
[27:41] amen the potential amen is laying within
[27:44] us
[27:44] we just have to feed on the word and let
[27:46] the spirit of god quicken word upon word
[27:48] upon word and poor word
[27:50] and grow into the full potential and
[27:53] quit
[27:53] acting like we're limited amen with
[27:56] humanness
[27:56] we're not limited amen remember we've
[27:59] talked about this before there is no
[28:01] limitation
[28:02] amen when god is present there is no
[28:04] limitation
[28:05] amen peter before he was born again
[28:07] could walk on top of water
[28:09] now you tell me what we're limited to in
[28:12] the human realm
[28:14] philip could disappear and reappear
[28:18] hundreds of miles away why and he was in
[28:21] the same body that we're in
[28:23] in the same condition he'd receive the
[28:24] baptism of the holy ghost
[28:26] yet he hadn't got the full revelation
[28:28] that was laying under the thunders
[28:32] so we have to stop amen letting the news
[28:36] tell us who we are
[28:37] and what our limits are you know we got
[28:40] to stop
[28:41] you there's there's so much there's so
[28:44] much uh
[28:44] confusion in the land in this day so
[28:47] much wickedness on every hand
[28:48] there's so much uh unrest
[28:52] we can't let that affect us
[28:55] you know the there's people
[28:59] rioting in the streets shooting one
[29:01] another
[29:02] burning police precincts there's people
[29:06] getting in fights and arguments over
[29:08] masks there's people throwing fits
[29:12] over wearing it or not wearing it on
[29:14] both sides
[29:16] it's become a political issue and i just
[29:19] want to encourage you
[29:21] don't get caught up in the minutia don't
[29:24] get
[29:24] caught up in the don't take a side on
[29:27] this thing
[29:28] don't take one side or the other don't
[29:31] be republican don't be democrat
[29:33] don't be politically minded whatsoever
[29:36] don't worry about
[29:37] what the government is saying or the
[29:39] government all they're doing is setting
[29:41] up for the next phase of destruction
[29:44] we know it's all lost it's all ruined
[29:47] there's no hope it's never turning
[29:48] around
[29:49] it's never coming back these things has
[29:51] to be this way
[29:52] and everything that's setting up getting
[29:54] worse is getting worse because it's
[29:56] supposed to get worse
[29:57] and it's getting worse for what comes
[29:59] next
[30:01] but that's not who we are
[30:04] you we may be affected by that in the
[30:06] flesh we may we may be restricted in
[30:08] some ways and affected in some ways
[30:10] but don't get caught up in none of that
[30:12] stuff let's look a little higher
[30:14] and say this my deliverance is coming
[30:17] nigh amen
[30:18] day by day word by word this thing
[30:20] doesn't affect me
[30:22] it only affects my flesh but it doesn't
[30:23] affect me
[30:27] don't get caught up because all of a
[30:29] sudden what happens we get so troubled
[30:30] in our spirit
[30:31] amen that we're not even living to the
[30:33] potential god wants us to live
[30:35] amen because there's something deeper
[30:37] than the spirit realm
[30:38] that he wants to take control of the
[30:40] outside man
[30:42] and our minds are so caught up by news
[30:44] and
[30:45] and all this you know what happened with
[30:47] the economy what will happen with their
[30:49] jobs what will happen all that
[30:51] take no thought what you'll wear for
[30:52] tomorrow
[30:55] oh that's a fun quote that's a fun
[30:57] scripture to put
[30:58] on your mirror that's a fun scripture to
[31:01] put in your car
[31:02] but it's not a fun scripture to live
[31:08] right some of these things that we've
[31:10] talked about
[31:11] are nice to talk about they're pep rally
[31:13] kind of verses
[31:15] take no thought tomorrow consider the
[31:17] lily amen solomon in all's glory wasn't
[31:19] dressed like one of them
[31:21] you know take no thought what you eat or
[31:23] what you aware your father knows
[31:26] those are great pep rally scriptures but
[31:28] when it comes down to it you actually
[31:30] have to live it where the rubber meets
[31:32] the road and you actually have to forget
[31:34] about it and trust god
[31:35] to provide for tomorrow's meet for
[31:37] tomorrow's raymond for tomorrow's job
[31:39] for tomorrow's whatever
[31:41] when we actually get there you're going
[31:42] to be at war with the outer man and
[31:45] you're gonna have to subdue the outer
[31:47] man and pull him back
[31:48] amen so that you can continue living the
[31:50] life that god's called us to live
[31:52] it'll be absolute spiritual warfare for
[31:55] that pep rally scripture to come to
[31:57] manifestation
[31:59] right we learned them in sunday school
[32:01] we quote them to one another anytime
[32:02] somebody goes through a trial we start
[32:04] quoting them to them
[32:06] and they're every bit the truth but the
[32:09] reality is
[32:10] when we get to that point it's going to
[32:11] be a fight
[32:13] to subdue the outer man to let the inner
[32:15] man live
[32:17] but i'll tell you if we can if we can
[32:19] die to this outer man
[32:20] and die to reasoning and die to
[32:22] conscience and
[32:23] die to natural affections amen we can
[32:26] see god do supernatural
[32:28] things
[32:32] we believe that we're the elect of god
[32:35] the seed of god the bride of jesus
[32:37] christ
[32:39] we do but it's so
[32:42] easy for spiritual indonesia in the
[32:45] midst of a trial to creep back in
[32:47] and forget who we are and let panic come
[32:51] in and anxiety come in and panic and
[32:54] anxiety will start to dominate
[32:56] again and that's a battle we have to
[32:59] fight
[33:00] that's not something that we should say
[33:02] should never happen it'll happen
[33:04] you still live in hybrid flesh you still
[33:06] have a human spirit
[33:07] you will still have to fight your way
[33:09] through those things
[33:11] it's not a cakewalk it's not easy it
[33:13] wasn't meant to be easy
[33:16] it was supposed to be hard so we have to
[33:19] focus on what we know what the reality
[33:22] of what this is
[33:25] see we've had it good
[33:31] we've had it good we may have had it
[33:35] better
[33:36] naturally speaking then we're ever going
[33:38] to have it again
[33:40] maybe i don't know it could get a lot
[33:42] better
[33:43] it could get a lot worse but i think we
[33:45] can all come to the place where we can
[33:47] agree there's some uncertainty
[33:50] we may and america have already seen our
[33:52] best days
[33:54] we may not we may see better yet i don't
[33:57] know
[33:59] but all i know is that can't move me
[34:02] anymore
[34:05] that can't move me anymore the word has
[34:08] to be the thing that moves me
[34:10] the word has to be the thing that
[34:12] directs me and moves me and guides my
[34:14] feet
[34:15] i've got to keep putting focus on the
[34:16] thing that will really matter when it
[34:18] really comes to the rub
[34:20] what will really matter this word that
[34:22] i've held in my heart
[34:23] a new body will materialize around that
[34:27] i've got we got to get down to the we
[34:29] got to get down to the real reality
[34:32] and focus on that and we've got to be
[34:34] singularly focused on that
[34:35] because there's going to be way more
[34:37] distractions than there are now
[34:39] i mean as we get nearer and nearer and
[34:41] and the distractions are going to get
[34:43] uh more difficult maybe more violent
[34:46] maybe more more frightening and more
[34:49] desperate
[34:49] amen but it doesn't change anything in
[34:52] the word of god in the plan of god
[34:54] we got to go back we got to go back and
[34:56] rehearse basics and never forget
[34:58] that i am a seed gene of god
[35:01] predestinated by god to be expressed
[35:03] in this day that i'm living and if the
[35:07] day
[35:07] i'm living is destined to fall
[35:10] completely apart
[35:11] then the potential in me to to crest
[35:15] every wave is already here
[35:20] when i was talking to some brothers at
[35:22] the picnic table on on
[35:24] sunday at the reception
[35:27] we were talking about that and i was i
[35:28] was mentioning brother branham says
[35:31] the stabilizers have been put on the
[35:33] ship
[35:35] and shall crest every wave
[35:39] you know when you first hear that you're
[35:40] like yeah the stabilizers have been put
[35:43] on the ship
[35:43] she'll crest every wave do you realize
[35:46] what that means
[35:48] that means there's going to be waves
[35:49] like there's never been waves before
[35:52] there's something was coming to the
[35:54] church brother bedam knew
[35:56] that was going to require stabilizers
[35:58] that hadn't been put on the ship yet
[36:00] because the ship's going to see waves
[36:02] like it hasn't seen
[36:03] yet so the stabilizers were needed
[36:09] amen so you know
[36:13] if god wakes you up in the night and you
[36:16] have an angelic visitation he says
[36:17] i just want you to know that i've put
[36:20] extra stabilizers on your ship
[36:24] i'm just letting you know i've just
[36:25] finished putting extra stabilizer on
[36:27] your ship
[36:28] don't worry you'll crest every wave oh
[36:30] you may feel good for a few minutes but
[36:32] when the reality kicks in
[36:34] and the waves start coming and they get
[36:36] bigger and bigger amen and they start
[36:38] curling up
[36:39] over the ship and crashing down on top
[36:41] and you start bobbing in the water up
[36:43] and down
[36:43] you're going to have to remember the
[36:45] stabilizers are already on the ship
[36:47] she'll crest every wave and then at that
[36:50] time
[36:51] it's going to become a reliving reality
[36:54] not a pep rally quote not something that
[36:56] we're excited about
[36:57] but something when we start living it
[36:59] out it's going to be the very anchor
[37:01] that holds us through the waves
[37:03] it's going to be the very reality that
[37:05] keeps us going
[37:06] when nothing else will keep us going
[37:10] so all these so much of my life
[37:14] scripture has been uh scripture has been
[37:18] something that comes on cards
[37:23] of encouragement or a nice little phrase
[37:26] or a cute flowery picture of meadow with
[37:30] a scripture because it's beautiful
[37:33] but the reality of living the scripture
[37:37] isn't the flowery meadow the reality of
[37:41] living out and fleshing out the
[37:42] scripture
[37:44] is in the backdrop of black
[37:47] when jesus came to live the scriptures
[37:51] what was his experience
[37:54] when paul began to live the scriptures
[37:56] what was paul's experience
[38:00] when noah lived the scriptures what was
[38:02] his experience when abraham lived out
[38:04] the scriptures what was his experience
[38:06] do i have to go through every character
[38:08] in the bible
[38:10] find one find one that was skipping
[38:13] through the meadow
[38:14] picking flowers smelling them reciting
[38:16] bible verses
[38:18] they were living the scriptures they
[38:21] were living out the prophecies
[38:23] amen and the word was coming in the face
[38:26] in the opposition of that word it was
[38:28] coming to conquer in the opposition of
[38:31] that prophecy
[38:35] i think we need to remember these things
[38:37] and be reminded of them
[38:39] and when things get tough say praise god
[38:42] if god allows this then there's
[38:45] something in me he wants to express that
[38:47] will overcome this
[38:50] because it's already there it just has
[38:51] to be unlocked
[38:53] it's already in there
[38:56] but the bible says in the message show
[38:58] us the father from 1955.
[39:00] now you people here you have beautiful
[39:02] trees perhaps have great apples plums
[39:04] now look a little tree
[39:06] just about one inch high has everything
[39:08] in it all the peaches all the apples all
[39:10] that'll ever be in it
[39:11] was in it when it was just one inch high
[39:14] if it isn't then where does it come from
[39:17] now you plant that little tree as a seed
[39:19] and it drinks it drinks it drinks it
[39:21] drinks
[39:21] it has to drink more than its portion
[39:23] and as it begins to drink
[39:25] it pushes out limbs pushes out blossoms
[39:27] pushes out apples
[39:29] the only thing the tree does is drink
[39:31] and it pushes out
[39:32] that's the way it is with every man or
[39:34] woman that's born of the spirit of god
[39:36] you are planted in christ jesus and the
[39:38] only thing you have to do is to drink
[39:40] from his promise
[39:42] it'll push out divine healing everything
[39:44] you have need of it'll push out
[39:45] as long as you are planted in christ
[39:47] jesus
[39:49] everything everything brother man i said
[39:52] you take an apple seed
[39:53] every apple that'll ever be produced off
[39:56] that tree is in the seed right then
[39:59] but it's got to go in the ground in the
[40:00] right condition and grow and the water
[40:02] and the sun has to come
[40:03] and it grows and produces all the apples
[40:05] but every apple it ever produces in the
[40:07] seed right then
[40:09] let's turn to ephesians real quick
[40:20] ephesians chapter 2
[40:23] verse 8
[40:26] for by grace are you saved through faith
[40:28] and that not of yourselves it is the
[40:30] gift of god
[40:31] not of works lest any man should boast
[40:33] we are his workmanship
[40:35] created in christ jesus unto good works
[40:38] which god hath before ordained that we
[40:40] should walk in them
[40:42] so who decided
[40:46] what good works you would do on this
[40:48] earth
[40:49] and when was it decided
[40:54] so if that's the case god had to put
[40:57] that in the seed
[40:59] because every apple ever come forth was
[41:01] in the seed
[41:02] and if god has already ordained the good
[41:05] works that we should walk in that we
[41:07] should perform
[41:08] it was already ordained then god had to
[41:10] put it in the seed
[41:11] so what do i do amen feed on the word
[41:15] drink up the rain drink it up and push
[41:18] out
[41:18] feed it up and push out amen we've got
[41:21] to quit
[41:21] wandering to and fro over the face of
[41:23] the earth trying to solve all of our
[41:25] problems
[41:26] our problems are solved by the
[41:28] quickening power of the word for this
[41:30] day
[41:30] because the word and the spirit go
[41:32] together it is the spirit of truth when
[41:34] truth comes the spirit of truth comes
[41:36] when the word comes the spirit of the
[41:38] word comes
[41:39] amen the word for this day amen will
[41:42] quicken the potentials that's laying in
[41:44] the seed for this day
[41:46] we've got to keep feeding on the word
[41:48] and asking god to lift us higher
[41:50] give us eyes to see amen because so many
[41:52] things are accomplished by revelation
[41:56] remember when when elisha was in daythan
[41:59] in gehesa his servant was with him and
[42:01] and the army of syria
[42:03] coming and camped around about him amen
[42:06] uh geheza woke up and he was nervous
[42:08] because of what his eyes saw
[42:10] he was nervous he was frustrated he
[42:13] assumed that death or capture was
[42:15] was imminent but elisha was just as calm
[42:19] and as cool as he could be
[42:22] why it was a difference of revelation
[42:26] it wasn't a difference of physical
[42:28] eyesight the difference was revelation
[42:31] elisha knew who he was he knew who god
[42:34] was
[42:34] he knew what his purpose was
[42:37] he knew there was nothing to worry about
[42:39] god had it all under control
[42:42] and because he had a he there was a
[42:44] spiritual reality to elijah that was
[42:47] greater than the natural reality
[42:48] when the natural reality looked bad
[42:51] elisha was
[42:52] elisha was still fine amen but geheza
[42:54] who was
[42:55] stuck in a carnal mind amen he was
[42:57] nervous
[42:58] so elisha prayed god opened the eyes
[43:01] of this young man and all of a sudden he
[43:04] opened his spiritual
[43:05] eyes and he could see chariots of fire
[43:08] and angels
[43:09] all around the hills all around them and
[43:12] now
[43:12] by spiritual revelation gehesa
[43:16] relaxes see
[43:19] what did it take it took a spiritual
[43:21] revelation amen
[43:23] that he would elisha could say relax
[43:25] relax relax relax relax it's okay relax
[43:27] amen
[43:28] he would just get more and more worked
[43:29] up amen because it's almost like
[43:32] elijah's in denial
[43:34] everything's fine yeah it's fine but i
[43:37] love it when you talk to somebody like
[43:39] that
[43:40] amen you've got a trial you're going
[43:42] through a hard time
[43:43] amen things are bad and your friend come
[43:45] to you and he says oh you've got this
[43:47] and this and this
[43:48] i'm praying for you have you tried this
[43:50] have you tried that
[43:52] have you tried here you say no
[43:55] i'm trusting god i've got a revelation
[43:57] in my heart everything's fine
[43:59] it's fine but yeah i know that's the
[44:02] word but
[44:03] i love when somebody says yeah i know
[44:04] the scripture but
[44:08] it's like thanks buddy
[44:12] i know that but and they think it'd be
[44:15] or
[44:15] get hazardous i know elisha but i know
[44:17] god i know he stood up for you
[44:19] time and time again i know you're a
[44:20] prophet of god i know you're here by the
[44:22] will of god
[44:22] i know you're serving god's purpose but
[44:24] look at the syrians
[44:26] i know god stood up for you time and
[44:28] time again but look at the series i know
[44:29] you stood for him on stanford but look
[44:31] at the sirians
[44:33] and god said allah said god open his
[44:35] eyes
[44:36] so that he can see a greater spiritual
[44:39] reality why
[44:44] why do you think it's so important that
[44:46] we preach bright age and bride coming
[44:49] and the coming of the lord and the sea
[44:51] gene of god
[44:52] why do you think it's so important we
[44:54] preach that amen because that gives you
[44:56] the spiritual eyes to overcome the
[44:58] situation
[44:59] you have to know who you are what day
[45:01] you're in what his purpose for you is
[45:03] you have to know amen because if we
[45:05] don't know these things amen we're still
[45:07] trying to overcome laodicea with a
[45:10] layout to see in mind
[45:12] and the only way to overcome the
[45:13] laodicean condition amen is to
[45:15] fly a little higher amen and god give us
[45:18] spiritual revelation
[45:20] of what we've been caught up into and
[45:22] what his purpose is for the bride in
[45:24] this age
[45:25] and when we preach these realities of
[45:28] the word for our day
[45:29] amen it brings a different vision to our
[45:32] eyes
[45:32] amen the revelation of who we actually
[45:35] really are
[45:36] begins to take the scales off of our
[45:38] eyes so that when we see
[45:39] these things in the natural we can relax
[45:42] because we have a greater vision in the
[45:44] supernatural how
[45:46] is he going to let how is he going to
[45:48] lose his bride
[45:51] how is there going to be one thing that
[45:52] happens to his bride that surprises him
[45:57] i'm the bride of jesus christ and what
[45:58] are you so nervous about
[46:01] because your nervousness and your
[46:03] confession with your mouth don't
[46:05] they don't match your constant anxiety
[46:09] and fear
[46:09] with the confession of who you say you
[46:11] are they're not lining up they're not
[46:13] going together
[46:16] because if we really once we really
[46:19] catch this revelation
[46:20] amen then there's got to come a rest to
[46:22] the soul
[46:24] and that rest in the soul has got to
[46:25] fight this anxiety in the outer man and
[46:27] bring
[46:28] it subject to the word amen
[46:31] just imagine for yourself that your soul
[46:34] is elisha
[46:37] and your outer man is ghaza
[46:40] say god god help me with this outside
[46:43] guy
[46:45] he's a nervous wreck he's worried about
[46:47] his job
[46:48] he's worried about his mortgage payment
[46:50] he's worried about this
[46:51] oh god help me rein in this this
[46:54] servant does nathan instead of going the
[46:58] other way
[46:59] we've got to quit letting nathan give
[47:02] the reality to elisha but
[47:03] elisha speak the reality to dathan relax
[47:07] my friend
[47:08] all is well and your mind is twisted in
[47:11] knots but you're saying relax all as
[47:14] well
[47:14] your emotions are scrambled up and
[47:16] running rampant and in your heart you're
[47:18] trying to say
[47:19] all is well it's a battle we have to
[47:22] fight friends
[47:24] brother brahm says in the patmos vision
[47:26] i just want to take a few minutes
[47:27] and i'm going to go really slow i think
[47:31] but i want to catch this out of the
[47:32] scriptures
[47:34] in the patmos vision he says cut every
[47:36] obstacle from human beings
[47:38] that they might be connected like like
[47:40] in the garden of eden
[47:42] i was going to choke it but i'm going to
[47:44] say it
[47:45] man is omnipotent
[47:49] brother ben said i was going to choke it
[47:50] but i'm going to say it man
[47:52] is omnipotent you don't believe that
[47:55] but he is hallelujah amen even when you
[47:59] say it
[48:00] your brain your outside man and all its
[48:02] funny feelings and
[48:03] but down inside it's absolutely the
[48:05] truth because it's god in here amen
[48:07] it's god inside this flesh it's god
[48:09] tavern now deity
[48:10] tabernacled in the clay amen it's
[48:13] limitless i mean it's got full potential
[48:15] nothing can stop it there's omnipotence
[48:19] inside
[48:20] of a man man is omnipotent you don't
[48:23] believe that but he is
[48:24] a man fully surrendered to god is
[48:28] omnipotent
[48:29] did not he say in mark 11 12 whatsoever
[48:32] things you say and don't doubt in your
[48:33] heart it'll come to pass
[48:34] you can have what you said what happens
[48:37] when two omnipotents meet
[48:39] when god and man comes together through
[48:41] omnipotence something's got to shake
[48:45] whatsoever you'd say with the creative
[48:47] power of omnipotence of god
[48:48] knowing that has promised it and he said
[48:50] it in his word
[48:51] it creates a power that goes out yonder
[48:54] and brings things to pass
[48:55] things that is not it makes them as
[48:57] though they are because two omnipotents
[49:00] have met what to omnipotence
[49:03] the omnipotent outside you and the
[49:04] omnipotent inside you has
[49:06] met quickened the revelation and it
[49:08] spoke through human lips
[49:10] and when it spoke through human lips
[49:11] amen it's the same as
[49:13] deity speaking not when it comes from
[49:16] here
[49:17] when it comes from here it's wishful
[49:19] thinking that's not the same as deity
[49:21] speaking
[49:22] even if it comes from here is a mental
[49:24] acknowledgement of the word or the
[49:26] message
[49:27] and it comes from here and comes out
[49:28] here it's not
[49:30] guaranteed that that will move i hope
[49:33] you understand what i'm saying
[49:34] that's just a mental process amen and
[49:37] there's nothing wrong with confessing
[49:38] the word through a mental process
[49:40] amen but that mental process has got to
[49:42] drop down
[49:43] and strike the soul until a living
[49:45] reality out of the soul comes and when
[49:47] that happens
[49:48] and the mouth speaks it absolutely will
[49:50] happen because that is deity speaking
[49:54] because it's not the mind of man it's
[49:55] not the will of man amen it's not the
[49:57] function of a man
[49:58] amen it's the function of god using a
[50:01] man
[50:03] moses without the baptism of the holy
[50:05] ghost could could
[50:06] create flies and fleas and all of these
[50:09] other things
[50:11] what can happen today if somebody gets
[50:14] fully surrendered to god
[50:17] the potential is there friends brother
[50:20] brahman said
[50:21] in 1960 when he said the
[50:24] expression made i jotted it down on a
[50:26] piece of paper i'll pick it out in the
[50:28] office there
[50:28] two omnipotents meet that's true when
[50:31] god and a believer meets there's two
[50:33] omnipotents because
[50:34] a man is a part of god he is a son of
[50:38] god
[50:40] he goes on to say in the restoration of
[50:41] the bride tree from 1962
[50:44] otherwise you're going to form what's
[50:46] known to me as a bride
[50:47] see all right i'll go with you you will
[50:50] be part of me
[50:51] you will be my bride my life will be in
[50:53] your body just like a husband and wife
[50:55] as one person
[50:56] you and i are going to be one at that
[50:59] day you'll know that i am in
[51:00] the father the father and me and i and
[51:03] you and you and me
[51:04] oh i just love that satan just gets so
[51:07] angry
[51:08] at that see the oneness of
[51:12] god that's a big statement friends
[51:15] don't let it fly over the head he said
[51:19] just like husband and wife is one person
[51:21] bride and bridegroom one person
[51:24] you and i are going to be one at that
[51:27] day you'll know that i am in the father
[51:29] the father and me i and you and you and
[51:32] me
[51:33] oh i just love that satan just gets so
[51:36] angry at that
[51:37] the oneness of god the oneness of god
[51:41] brother branham didn't limit to father
[51:43] son and holy ghost
[51:45] the oneness of god the definition
[51:47] brother brahm gives you the oneness of
[51:48] god the example he says
[51:50] is i am the father the father and me i
[51:52] in you and you and me
[51:57] that makes you that attribute inside of
[51:59] you
[52:00] part of the oneness of god
[52:03] and that's the revelation that satan is
[52:06] fighting in this hour
[52:07] the revelation to the individual one
[52:10] person
[52:11] coming to you recognizing who you really
[52:13] are
[52:14] you're not you're not the flesh that you
[52:17] were born into you're
[52:18] not just coming through these two
[52:20] parents you know not that
[52:22] that's not who you really are what you
[52:24] really
[52:25] are from the mind of god before the
[52:26] foundation of the world is that
[52:28] attribute that's laying down inside the
[52:29] soul
[52:31] that's what satan doesn't want to be
[52:33] expressed and that's the revelation that
[52:35] he's fighting
[52:37] and he's still fighting it let's take
[52:39] our bibles and
[52:40] turn to john 14.
[52:44] i want to take several scriptures here
[52:46] in just a bible study and go through it
[52:47] slow
[52:49] now as we go through this i just want
[52:51] you to hang on with me
[52:54] and and i want you to think
[52:57] um just keep your mind alert and put
[53:00] your spiritual jacket on as we read this
[53:02] and we all know this we've all read it
[53:04] but it's just so much fun to read it
[53:07] because you're going to find out that
[53:10] jesus begins to speak
[53:14] illogically to the human mind
[53:19] i'm not saying he's illogical he's
[53:20] illogical to the human mind
[53:23] he starts to say things that don't add
[53:25] up
[53:27] but it's the scripture and it's what
[53:29] jesus told his disciples
[53:32] and you'll never get them to add up
[53:34] without a revelation
[53:35] of the godhead without a revelation of
[53:38] the oneness of god
[53:39] you'll never get this picture painted
[53:41] right but let's just look at these
[53:43] scriptures
[53:46] let's go to john i'm in luke
[53:49] john chapter 14
[53:53] verse 7. if you had known me you should
[53:57] have known my father also
[53:59] and from henceforth you know him and
[54:01] have seen him
[54:03] philip saith unto him lord show us the
[54:05] father and it sufficeth us
[54:07] jesus saith unto him have i been so long
[54:10] time with you and yet has thou not known
[54:13] me philip
[54:14] he that hath seen me has seen the father
[54:16] and how sayest thou then
[54:18] show us the father believeth thou not
[54:21] that i am in the father
[54:22] and the father in me the words that i
[54:25] speak unto you i speak not of myself but
[54:27] the father that dwelleth in me
[54:29] he doeth the works believe me that i am
[54:31] in the father and the father in me
[54:33] or else believe me for the very works
[54:35] sake
[54:37] we we know this scripture
[54:41] so well that we can take a surface
[54:44] reading
[54:44] and we can always miss what else is
[54:46] laying there
[54:48] but he says when you see me
[54:51] you have seen the father
[54:54] but the scripture says no man has seen
[54:56] the father jesus says no man has seen
[54:58] the father at any time
[55:00] but when you see me you see the father
[55:03] you know i god the father only took
[55:07] one body of flesh to dwell in fullness
[55:09] and that was his son jesus christ
[55:12] but there's another meaning here too
[55:14] because it's not just c with the natural
[55:17] eyes because pharisees
[55:18] saw him sadducees saw him and rejected
[55:22] him and didn't see the father
[55:23] but he's bringing a greater revelation
[55:25] if you actually see
[55:26] me if you see who i am by revelation
[55:29] know who i am you see the father
[55:31] it's not just a physical seeing only
[55:34] amen it's a spiritual scene and we'll
[55:37] show that a little bit later
[55:39] he says but you know let's read it again
[55:46] if you had known me you should have
[55:48] known my father also
[55:51] well you know they knew some people knew
[55:53] jesus
[55:54] some people grew up in the same town
[55:56] with him they knew what family he was
[55:58] from and
[55:58] they probably knew what his favorite
[56:00] food was but that's not
[56:02] the knowing he's talking about he's
[56:04] talking about if you know me
[56:06] an intimate knowing if you know me you
[56:08] should have known my father also
[56:10] and from henceforth you know him and
[56:12] have seen him
[56:14] philip asked the question and he says
[56:16] i've been so long time with you
[56:18] he has thou not known me philip he that
[56:20] has seen me had seen the father
[56:22] and how thou sayest show us the father i
[56:25] can't show you
[56:26] i've shown you i can't show you
[56:30] because i've already shown you how did
[56:32] he show you
[56:33] in the works it was the father working
[56:36] in me it was him and me and i
[56:38] and him and believe me if you can't
[56:40] believe me believe me for the work's
[56:41] sake
[56:41] i've already shown you the father how
[56:43] did he show you the father
[56:45] not just in the skin he showed him the
[56:47] father because it was the father behind
[56:49] the skin
[56:50] doing the works praise god
[56:53] let's go over to verse 16.
[56:58] and i will pray the father and he shall
[57:00] give you another comforter
[57:02] that he may abide with you forever even
[57:05] the spirit of truth
[57:06] whom the world cannot receive because it
[57:08] seeth him not
[57:09] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[57:11] he dwelleth with you
[57:13] and shall be in you all right here's
[57:16] some more confusing language
[57:18] because if you're looking at this
[57:20] carnally there's nothing he's saying
[57:22] makes sense
[57:24] it only makes sense if you understand
[57:26] the godhead
[57:27] and says spiritual revelation even the
[57:29] spirit of the truth who the world cannot
[57:30] receive because it
[57:32] seeth him not when do you
[57:35] ever see the holy ghost
[57:38] he's talking about the spirit of coming
[57:39] the spirit coming they don't see him
[57:41] amen but you're going to see him you're
[57:43] going to know him amen in fact
[57:45] he's dwelling with you now and jesus
[57:47] says i've got to go
[57:49] so he can come when i go the father will
[57:51] send him but he's dwelling with you now
[57:56] you understand the revelation transcends
[57:58] language language cannot encapsulate
[58:01] the revelation but that jesus is just
[58:03] using words
[58:04] to try to get them to understand there's
[58:06] a transition coming
[58:08] but the words he's saying don't even
[58:10] make sense there's a spirit coming that
[58:12] they can't see
[58:13] well nobody can see a spirit with these
[58:15] eyes remember these disciples are going
[58:17] to be able to see
[58:20] and i'll tell you further you know him
[58:22] and he's dwelling with you
[58:24] but i thought you said you would send
[58:26] him
[58:28] how do i know him if i haven't met him
[58:30] yet how do i know him if you haven't
[58:32] seen him yet
[58:34] amen now you know why sometimes you
[58:38] can't figure out the language in the
[58:39] message
[58:41] the same exact reason
[58:45] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[58:46] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[58:48] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[58:50] he dwelleth with you
[58:52] and shall be in you
[58:55] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[58:57] come to you
[58:59] so who's coming the comforter or you
[59:03] and he's dwelling with us and he will be
[59:06] in me
[59:07] you understand if we could go back and
[59:10] erase everything we know and stand there
[59:12] where the disciples are standing there
[59:13] can you imagine the look on their faces
[59:15] they're trying to catch what he's saying
[59:18] i'm going to go and send you another
[59:19] comforter they're comforted by the
[59:21] presence of jesus christ
[59:22] he's right there in their midst and a
[59:24] flesh body they're comforted by that
[59:26] and but he says he says but i'm going to
[59:27] go and the father i pray the father
[59:30] he will send you another comforter can
[59:32] you imagine calculating
[59:34] you go talk to father father is going to
[59:37] send comforter
[59:38] comfort is going to come down
[59:41] and nobody will see him the world can't
[59:42] see him
[59:44] but you'll know him because he's
[59:45] dwelling with you now
[59:51] the spiritual reality is greater than
[59:53] the natural understanding
[59:58] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[1:00:01] come to you
[1:00:02] yet a little while and the world sees me
[1:00:04] no more but ye see me
[1:00:06] because i live you shall live also
[1:00:10] at that day you shall know that i am in
[1:00:12] my father and ye and me
[1:00:14] and i in you
[1:00:17] he that hath my commandments and keepeth
[1:00:19] them he it is that love with me
[1:00:22] and he that loveth me shall be loved of
[1:00:23] my father and i will love him
[1:00:26] and will manifest myself to him
[1:00:29] manifest just means reveal or show
[1:00:32] judah saith in him not ascaria lord how
[1:00:34] is it that thou wilt manifest thyself
[1:00:36] unto us
[1:00:37] and not unto the world jesus answered
[1:00:39] and said unto him
[1:00:40] if a man loves me he will keep my words
[1:00:42] and my father will love him
[1:00:44] and we will come unto him and make our
[1:00:46] abode
[1:00:47] with him man
[1:00:52] i'm going to get the father and
[1:00:55] jesus christ and the comforter
[1:00:59] that's the truth amen but it's not going
[1:01:02] to be what a carnal mind thinks there's
[1:01:04] not three
[1:01:04] it's all the same exact thing amen it's
[1:01:07] all
[1:01:08] god god and whatever manifestation god
[1:01:10] wants to manifest himself
[1:01:11] that's why the human language cannot
[1:01:13] encapsulate
[1:01:14] or explain what's going to happen
[1:01:18] if you were a disciple that day i
[1:01:20] imagine it was very confusing
[1:01:24] brother brahman says in christ is the
[1:01:26] mystery god revealed jesus said at that
[1:01:28] day
[1:01:29] that's this day he brings him to this
[1:01:31] scripture but brother branham takes this
[1:01:33] scripture
[1:01:33] and brings it back to this day he said
[1:01:36] at that day that's this day
[1:01:37] at that day when this revelation is made
[1:01:40] known
[1:01:40] what revelation the revelation is christ
[1:01:43] the mystery of god revealed
[1:01:45] amen and christ in you the hope of glory
[1:01:49] when this revelation is revealed you
[1:01:52] will know that i am in the father
[1:01:54] and the father in me i in you and you
[1:01:57] and me
[1:01:58] when the revelation is made manifest at
[1:02:00] that day you shall know that i and the
[1:02:02] father are one
[1:02:03] i am in the father and the father is in
[1:02:04] me then when the revelation comes forth
[1:02:07] then it's i in you
[1:02:08] and you and me there you are
[1:02:12] what is that the oneness of god and
[1:02:15] who's included in the oneness of god
[1:02:17] i'm included in the oneness of god
[1:02:21] that's why the carnal mind will never
[1:02:22] understand that because
[1:02:24] you know something besides me has to
[1:02:27] come to me
[1:02:28] and when something besides me comes to
[1:02:30] me it can quicken something that's down
[1:02:32] inside of me
[1:02:32] just leave all the human stuff out of it
[1:02:35] amen there's a part of god laying down
[1:02:36] inside the soul
[1:02:37] and god is going to come to god to
[1:02:39] quicken it the life amen and nurture
[1:02:41] this thing as it grows and grows to what
[1:02:43] to the likeness of god to the
[1:02:45] manifestation of the word
[1:02:47] whatever term you want to use leave the
[1:02:49] flesh out of it
[1:02:50] and quit making it three or four or five
[1:02:53] different people
[1:02:54] amen that's why the bride of christ is
[1:02:58] one body
[1:03:00] many members one make that make sense
[1:03:03] it's not carnally comprehended it's
[1:03:05] spiritually understood
[1:03:08] it's all the oneness of god
[1:03:11] let's go to verse 26 14 26.
[1:03:17] but the comforter which is the holy
[1:03:18] ghost whom the father will send in my
[1:03:21] name
[1:03:22] he shall teach you all things and bring
[1:03:24] all things to your remembrance
[1:03:25] whatsoever i've said unto you
[1:03:27] now let's go over to chapter 15 verse 26
[1:03:31] but when the comforters come who i will
[1:03:34] send unto you
[1:03:36] let's go back to 14 26
[1:03:39] but the comforter which is the holy
[1:03:40] ghost whom the father will send
[1:03:43] 15 26 but when the comforters come whom
[1:03:47] i will send
[1:03:48] who sends the comforter is it the father
[1:03:52] or is it the son who sends the comforter
[1:03:55] it's
[1:03:56] the same one
[1:03:59] amen praise be to god if not you have to
[1:04:03] have two comforters
[1:04:05] because you have two different people
[1:04:07] sending two different comforters
[1:04:08] and now you got to decide which
[1:04:10] comforter you want it has nothing
[1:04:12] to do with the language forget the
[1:04:13] language catch what he's saying
[1:04:15] amen he and the father are one
[1:04:20] and then i in you and you and me we're
[1:04:22] one
[1:04:23] and then the father and i will make her
[1:04:25] a boat in you
[1:04:26] to be what to be one so it's all
[1:04:30] one thing praise god
[1:04:34] chapter 16 verse 7
[1:04:38] nevertheless i tell you the truth is
[1:04:40] expedient for you that i go away for if
[1:04:42] i go not away the comforter will not
[1:04:44] come unto you
[1:04:45] but if i depart i will send him unto you
[1:04:49] i thought that was the father's job
[1:04:52] amen oh i love this this is all in here
[1:04:56] for a purpose and for a reason
[1:04:58] it's said both ways for a reason so that
[1:05:00] we can take
[1:05:01] and take it both ways slap an equal sign
[1:05:04] between the middle and say it's the same
[1:05:05] thing
[1:05:06] because if the father is going to send
[1:05:08] you the comforter and i'm going to send
[1:05:09] you the comforter then
[1:05:10] then then the father and the son are one
[1:05:15] amen 16 27.
[1:05:22] for the father himself loveth you
[1:05:26] because you have loved me and i believe
[1:05:28] that i come out from god
[1:05:31] see why did the father love them
[1:05:35] not because they believed just his
[1:05:37] earthly manifestation in the healings
[1:05:39] and the miracles
[1:05:40] the father loved them because you have
[1:05:44] loved me
[1:05:44] and have believed that i come out from
[1:05:46] god
[1:05:49] that's why the father loved you because
[1:05:51] you believed
[1:05:52] i was originally in god
[1:05:56] this is important friends because this
[1:05:58] is how we're supposed to love one
[1:06:00] another
[1:06:01] and this is what we're supposed to
[1:06:02] recognize about one another
[1:06:04] because we love one another because we
[1:06:07] recognize that we came out from god
[1:06:10] verse 28 and i came forth from the
[1:06:13] father
[1:06:14] and him come into the world again i
[1:06:16] leave the world
[1:06:17] and go to the father so verse 28 is an
[1:06:20] important one
[1:06:21] i come forth from the father and him
[1:06:23] come into the world
[1:06:25] again i leave the world and go to the
[1:06:27] father
[1:06:29] let's go to chapter 17 verse 14.
[1:06:35] i have given them my word and i and the
[1:06:38] world has hated them
[1:06:39] because they are not of the world even
[1:06:41] as i am not of the world
[1:06:44] how was he not of the world go back to
[1:06:46] previous chapter verse 28
[1:06:48] i come forth from the father and i'm
[1:06:50] coming to the world
[1:06:51] again i leave the world and i go back to
[1:06:53] the father that's how jesus was not of
[1:06:55] the world
[1:06:56] he came from the father and he went back
[1:06:58] to the father
[1:06:59] and now he points to disciples and he
[1:07:01] says i've given them thy word and the
[1:07:02] world hath hated them
[1:07:03] because they are not of the world even
[1:07:06] as i
[1:07:06] am not of the world the same way he was
[1:07:09] not of the world is the same way
[1:07:11] we're not of the world and we're not of
[1:07:13] the world because his origin was in god
[1:07:16] not as beginning his origin was in god
[1:07:18] not my beginning but my origin was
[1:07:20] in god i've come out from god into the
[1:07:23] world but someday i'm going back to god
[1:07:26] jesus came out from the father and he
[1:07:28] knew he was going back to the father
[1:07:30] and this is why god loved him because
[1:07:33] they caught that revelation
[1:07:36] let's look at verse 20 now
[1:07:44] 17-20 neither pray i for these alone but
[1:07:47] for them also which shall believe on me
[1:07:49] through their word
[1:07:50] that they all may be one as thou father
[1:07:52] art in me
[1:07:54] and i in thee that they also may be one
[1:07:56] in us
[1:07:57] that the world may believe that thou has
[1:07:59] sent me
[1:08:00] and the glory which thou gavest me i
[1:08:03] have given them
[1:08:04] that they may be one even as we are one
[1:08:07] i
[1:08:07] in them thou in me that they may be made
[1:08:10] perfect in one
[1:08:11] and that the world may know that thou
[1:08:13] has sent me and has loved them
[1:08:15] as thou has loved me
[1:08:20] if we catch the reality of this
[1:08:24] what does it matter if the plant's
[1:08:26] closing down
[1:08:29] what does it matter if the government
[1:08:30] fails and what does it matter if
[1:08:32] currency
[1:08:33] is worth nothing tomorrow morning
[1:08:36] do you understand what i'm saying if if
[1:08:40] you
[1:08:40] if something in you that part of god
[1:08:43] that's in you that was to be you before
[1:08:44] the foundation of the world
[1:08:46] if that came out of god amen is destined
[1:08:48] to connect back to god
[1:08:50] and god put it here for a purpose in
[1:08:53] this tabernacle of flesh to express
[1:08:55] his word for this day what does it
[1:08:57] matter if the banks fail
[1:09:00] what does it matter if the jobs are gone
[1:09:02] what is it yes there'll be stress
[1:09:04] yes there'll be tension yes there'll be
[1:09:06] hardship but
[1:09:07] but if if god allows it to happen
[1:09:09] there's a purpose for it to happen and
[1:09:11] something he wants to accomplish
[1:09:13] and he's already pre-wired us to meet
[1:09:16] the condition of the age
[1:09:18] there's already something there there's
[1:09:20] already something in his word
[1:09:21] it's already been unrocked by the
[1:09:23] message there's something that god wants
[1:09:25] to do
[1:09:25] amen and if he chose to do it that way
[1:09:28] it's the only way he can accomplish it
[1:09:31] do you realize that his eye is on you
[1:09:34] why is his eye on you
[1:09:35] his eye was on abraham no matter where
[1:09:37] abraham moved amen god was watching
[1:09:39] wherever abraham moved
[1:09:42] why because abraham was a predestinated
[1:09:44] seed
[1:09:45] god was not losing amen he was not
[1:09:47] losing contact with abraham he was not
[1:09:49] losing abraham and the crowd of people
[1:09:52] god has not lost you in the crowd he has
[1:09:55] not lost you in the many numbers of
[1:09:57] 7.7 billion people on the planet he
[1:10:00] hasn't lost you he knows where you're at
[1:10:07] and he's predestinated you and your life
[1:10:10] and your steps
[1:10:12] and he'll not let anything happen that
[1:10:14] he has not ordained
[1:10:19] and so if god allows circumstances to
[1:10:23] come
[1:10:25] he wants to bring a result and he wants
[1:10:28] to manifest something
[1:10:30] and this is the only way it'll work
[1:10:33] because if it'll work another way he'd
[1:10:36] have allowed another way
[1:10:41] you know how much time i've wasted
[1:10:42] complaining
[1:10:45] about my circumstances you know how much
[1:10:48] time i've spent grumbling and
[1:10:49] complaining
[1:10:50] when god is wanting to move when god is
[1:10:53] wanting to show himself mighty on my
[1:10:55] behalf
[1:10:55] when god is wanting to confirm his word
[1:10:59] how many marvelous testimonies have we
[1:11:01] heard of divine healing
[1:11:05] how much stress fear and pressure have
[1:11:08] the individuals had to go through to get
[1:11:10] to the testimony of divine healing
[1:11:13] you realize it wasn't easy it wasn't
[1:11:16] easy
[1:11:17] we love the testimony and we shout and
[1:11:19] rejoice in the testimony
[1:11:21] and that's what god wanted to do to show
[1:11:23] his word is the same yesterday today and
[1:11:25] forever to show he's here to show that
[1:11:26] he can still heal but in order to show
[1:11:28] that
[1:11:29] he's got to take us into a condition
[1:11:31] into a place that
[1:11:32] none of us want to go and he's got to
[1:11:35] put us in places that that our flesh
[1:11:37] doesn't want to be and under
[1:11:38] circumstances that we would love to get
[1:11:40] out of
[1:11:41] because he's trying to manifest himself
[1:11:45] he did it in every church age he did it
[1:11:47] in all the believers through the bible
[1:11:48] what makes you think he's not going to
[1:11:50] do it in you and i
[1:11:52] so we have to start recognizing in every
[1:11:54] trial and every hardship
[1:11:56] and then we have to recognize god is
[1:11:58] trying to do something
[1:12:00] i need to get in tune with what he's
[1:12:01] doing i need to get in the program i
[1:12:03] need to get in the channel
[1:12:05] i don't want to fight i don't want to
[1:12:06] wrestle i don't want to be nervous
[1:12:08] i want to sit back and relax and say god
[1:12:11] what do you want me to do
[1:12:12] how do you want me to react brother i
[1:12:15] said many times god will do something
[1:12:17] just to see how you react to it
[1:12:21] he'll allow somebody to say something
[1:12:23] he'll allow something to be done that
[1:12:24] was wrong somebody say something just to
[1:12:26] see how you react
[1:12:29] why because he's got character that he
[1:12:32] wants on display
[1:12:34] he wants all of these things in the face
[1:12:36] of opposition
[1:12:37] and the opposition of virtue and the
[1:12:39] opposition to temperance and the
[1:12:40] opposition the brotherly love and the
[1:12:42] opposition to charity
[1:12:43] he wants in the face of the opposition
[1:12:45] to demonstrate his charity
[1:12:47] his temperance his brotherly kindness
[1:12:54] he'll say why would he do that because
[1:12:55] he's god
[1:12:57] and he wants to prove he's god
[1:13:01] do you believe god wants to prove he's
[1:13:02] god
[1:13:05] then you tell me how is he going to
[1:13:07] prove he's god
[1:13:10] he's going to have to take wherever he
[1:13:12] is
[1:13:13] and where is god
[1:13:17] and display it through that when
[1:13:20] elisha was here was in elisha abraham
[1:13:22] was here as an abraham noah was here as
[1:13:24] in noah
[1:13:26] but who's here now who's here now
[1:13:30] and where is he working now and if he's
[1:13:33] going to display himself now
[1:13:35] where is he going to display himself if
[1:13:38] he's going to show himself a healer if
[1:13:39] he's going to show himself a deliverer
[1:13:40] if he's going to show his
[1:13:41] characteristics in his character if he's
[1:13:43] going to show divine love where is he
[1:13:45] going to show it he's going to show it
[1:13:46] here and if there's going to be a need
[1:13:48] for divine love it's got to be in a face
[1:13:50] of
[1:13:50] lack of love
[1:13:54] we might as well get comfortable with
[1:13:56] that thought amen
[1:13:59] brethren said in the message convinced
[1:14:00] and then concerned
[1:14:02] said therefore jesus said it's not me
[1:14:04] that doeth the works it's my father that
[1:14:05] dwelleth in me
[1:14:07] he doeth the works that's right he could
[1:14:10] speak and say the words and what it was
[1:14:12] it isn't me it's my father that dwelleth
[1:14:14] in me see and his father
[1:14:16] that's the reason he prayed to the
[1:14:17] father someone asked me he said well
[1:14:19] then
[1:14:20] how could you pray to the father if the
[1:14:22] if the father was in them
[1:14:24] i said how do you pray to the father the
[1:14:26] fathers in you
[1:14:29] that's a good question see there you are
[1:14:32] you pray to the holy ghost so you sure
[1:14:34] do god was in christ reconciling the
[1:14:37] world to himself great jehovah god dwelt
[1:14:39] in christ
[1:14:40] we it is in us by measure
[1:14:44] he goes in 1963 calling jesus on the
[1:14:46] scene someone asked me
[1:14:48] then how do how did he pray in the
[1:14:51] to who did he pray to in the garden of
[1:14:53] gethsemane i said i'll answer you that
[1:14:55] when you answer me this
[1:14:56] do you believe you have the holy ghost
[1:14:58] yes i said
[1:14:59] then who do you pray to where is he at
[1:15:03] when you pray to him
[1:15:06] when you claim you have him and yet
[1:15:08] you're praying to him
[1:15:12] i in you you and me
[1:15:16] in that you'll know you'll know i am in
[1:15:17] the father the fathers and me i
[1:15:19] and you and you and me jesus those
[1:15:21] disciples in that day
[1:15:23] if you keep my commandments the father
[1:15:24] will love you and the father and i
[1:15:26] we will come to you and make our abode
[1:15:29] with you
[1:15:31] where's the father and the son in the
[1:15:34] disciples
[1:15:36] where's the father that they pray to
[1:15:40] what did the scripture say in that day
[1:15:43] you'll know
[1:15:44] i and you you and me
[1:15:47] see in human terms
[1:15:50] we only understand by time and space
[1:15:54] nothing makes sense to us unless we can
[1:15:56] put it in a physical place
[1:15:58] in time we say right here
[1:16:02] i'll set i'll set one thing object here
[1:16:06] and i'll go all the way over here and
[1:16:08] i'll set another object over here
[1:16:12] and in our dimension that we live in our
[1:16:15] carnal understanding
[1:16:16] we'll say that is here and this is there
[1:16:21] but god can say that and this are the
[1:16:24] same thing and they're in the same place
[1:16:29] don't try to figure it out you'll fizzle
[1:16:31] some brain cells
[1:16:34] but god transcends space god transcends
[1:16:37] time
[1:16:37] god created time created space to
[1:16:39] manifest himself amen he is not bound by
[1:16:42] space and time
[1:16:43] amen jesus when he was talking to
[1:16:44] nicodemus he was saying the son of man
[1:16:47] who's here which is in heaven
[1:16:48] the son of man was in heaven and here
[1:16:50] and you're seated now in heavenly places
[1:16:52] in christ jesus but you're right here
[1:16:55] you can be in two places at once because
[1:16:57] there's not really two places at once
[1:17:00] and we can't understand that but we try
[1:17:02] to take god
[1:17:03] amen we try to make the father over here
[1:17:06] and the son over on
[1:17:07] i mean the sons on this altar here the
[1:17:09] father standing over here the holy ghost
[1:17:11] is working all over the place
[1:17:15] you understand we limit our
[1:17:17] understanding of god
[1:17:18] amen god's in you if you're a child of
[1:17:22] god
[1:17:22] born again god is dwelling in you and
[1:17:24] the same god dwelling in you is the same
[1:17:26] god dwelling in me
[1:17:27] amen and we are one right that's what
[1:17:30] jesus said his prayer was that they
[1:17:31] would be one
[1:17:32] even as you and i are one in the same
[1:17:35] way that the father and the son
[1:17:36] is one is the same way that he wants me
[1:17:38] and you to be one amen
[1:17:41] explain it brother chad i'm done that's
[1:17:43] as far as i can go
[1:17:45] i can't explain it but it's a reality
[1:17:48] it's just as real
[1:17:49] as those angels that we're encompassing
[1:17:51] around the syrian army
[1:17:52] it's just as real amen that god is
[1:17:55] linked to every one of us at the same
[1:17:56] time
[1:17:57] this was one body of jesus christ on the
[1:18:00] earth amen and christ is dwelling
[1:18:02] in that body on the earth how does it
[1:18:04] work i
[1:18:05] don't know but the fact is it's nothing
[1:18:08] but the truth amen and if that is the
[1:18:10] truth then there's nothing for me to
[1:18:12] fear
[1:18:12] there's nothing for me to worry about
[1:18:14] there's no reason to let anxiety take
[1:18:16] over me
[1:18:17] because god has got it all under control
[1:18:19] because he's here and he's here and he's
[1:18:21] here and he's there
[1:18:22] and he knows the future and he knows the
[1:18:23] past and he's been in it all
[1:18:27] and it was done before the foundation of
[1:18:29] the world and now he's letting it
[1:18:30] manifest in this little hickey called
[1:18:32] time
[1:18:32] but he's not even in this hickey called
[1:18:34] time he's still in eternity watching
[1:18:36] what's going on in the hickey called
[1:18:38] time
[1:18:38] and he's orchestrating it all and has it
[1:18:40] all pre-planned
[1:18:41] and how does it all work i don't know
[1:18:44] but i know one thing
[1:18:45] that he's got it all under control i
[1:18:48] know for sure
[1:18:49] that nothing is going to happen to me
[1:18:51] unless it's ordained to happen
[1:18:53] and if he allows it to happen it's the
[1:18:55] very thing that needs to happen
[1:18:57] to get me where he wants to be to do
[1:18:59] what he wants to do
[1:19:03] rest little bride rest
[1:19:08] all as well rest
[1:19:12] why why does it have to be this way
[1:19:15] i don't know but it has to be this way
[1:19:25] i'm just going to read two scriptures
[1:19:27] second corinthians 5 19
[1:19:29] to wit that god was in christ
[1:19:32] reconciling the world unto himself
[1:19:35] colossians 1 26 even the mystery which
[1:19:38] had been hid from ages and from
[1:19:40] generations
[1:19:41] but now is made manifest to the saints
[1:19:43] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:19:45] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:19:47] among the gentiles
[1:19:48] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:19:52] that's why brother baby says all that
[1:19:54] god was he poured into christ
[1:19:56] all that christ was he poured into the
[1:19:58] church
[1:20:01] and he's not going to lose you and he's
[1:20:04] very aware of what's happening
[1:20:08] i want to read a quote as we close
[1:20:11] out of the message i know this is one of
[1:20:13] my favorite
[1:20:14] portions of the message remember them
[1:20:18] says
[1:20:19] in chapter or in paragraph 28 of i know
[1:20:21] from 1960.
[1:20:23] it is written in one of the scriptures
[1:20:25] in the bible trials are brought upon us
[1:20:27] are more precious to us than gold itself
[1:20:30] that's first peter 1 and 6. wherein you
[1:20:32] greatly rejoice though now for a season
[1:20:34] if need be
[1:20:35] you're in heaviness through manifold
[1:20:37] that's many
[1:20:38] temptations that the trial of your faith
[1:20:41] being much more precious than of gold
[1:20:42] that perishes
[1:20:43] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:20:45] found the praise and the honor and glory
[1:20:48] at the appearing of jesus christ back to
[1:20:51] the quote brother brahm says
[1:20:52] they're more precious to us than gold
[1:20:54] itself for it is god giving us
[1:20:56] these trials after we become his
[1:21:00] property
[1:21:01] our confession and our baptism and our
[1:21:03] promise to walk in life after him
[1:21:05] then every trial that comes upon us is
[1:21:07] to perfect us for his glory
[1:21:10] it is to bring us to a place where god
[1:21:12] can make himself more real to us
[1:21:14] than he was before the trial come
[1:21:18] i want to join in this morning with job
[1:21:20] to say that i've lived long enough to
[1:21:22] know
[1:21:22] that that's the truth i've seen in my
[1:21:24] own life that every time a great
[1:21:26] situation rises that
[1:21:28] i can't get around it or under it or
[1:21:30] over it
[1:21:31] god makes a way and comes out glorious
[1:21:34] i just wonder how his grace ever does it
[1:21:36] but he does it
[1:21:38] and remember in all these things satan
[1:21:40] tries to make us nervous
[1:21:42] and upset key in on this listen
[1:21:46] and all these things satan tries to make
[1:21:48] us nervous and upset us
[1:21:50] to get us to think oh why did this
[1:21:52] happen why couldn't it have been like
[1:21:54] this
[1:21:56] has that ever happened to you have you
[1:21:58] ever asked yourself that question
[1:21:59] if you haven't asked yourself that
[1:22:00] question in a week's time i wonder where
[1:22:02] you're living
[1:22:05] but that's satan trying to make us
[1:22:06] nervous and upset us
[1:22:08] why did it happen like this why couldn't
[1:22:10] it have been like this
[1:22:12] further down in paragraph 36 he says
[1:22:14] it's those crucial hours that press us
[1:22:17] on those sacred sands
[1:22:19] it was in the bible and remember no
[1:22:22] matter how great the distress
[1:22:23] is satan cannot take your life until god
[1:22:25] has finished with you
[1:22:27] there is nothing can happen to you
[1:22:29] unless god permits it there is no
[1:22:31] evil can come unless god permits it and
[1:22:33] it's for your good he's working that
[1:22:36] can we believe that can we just take it
[1:22:40] and believe it and accept it
[1:22:41] amen and realize that that there's
[1:22:44] tribulations that are ordained for us to
[1:22:46] overcome
[1:22:47] the stabilizers have been put on the
[1:22:49] ship
[1:22:50] why were the stabilizers put on the ship
[1:22:52] because the ship
[1:22:53] is going to need the stabilizers
[1:22:57] that means the water's going to get
[1:23:00] rough
[1:23:04] amen now maybe we'll go from shouting at
[1:23:08] that quote to going oh the stabilizers
[1:23:10] are on the ship
[1:23:14] oh he just put the stabilizer oh he just
[1:23:17] put the big stabilizers on the ship
[1:23:22] it's for your good he's working that
[1:23:25] let's think
[1:23:27] there when the floods come to destroy
[1:23:29] the earth it could not destroy
[1:23:30] noah noah could not be destroyed because
[1:23:33] that god had worked for him to do
[1:23:35] one day down in a great nation under a
[1:23:37] great bondage there were some hebrew
[1:23:39] children
[1:23:39] that we know as shadrach meshach and
[1:23:41] abednego and it come to a place where
[1:23:43] they had to make a decision that
[1:23:44] something had to be done
[1:23:47] their faith was put to the test and when
[1:23:48] their faith is put to the test
[1:23:50] then don't fail stay right with what you
[1:23:53] believe
[1:23:53] oh that's so crucial friends if you've
[1:23:57] confessed to believe something
[1:23:58] you say i believe that this is of god
[1:24:00] and i believe that god led me here and i
[1:24:03] believe this is of god
[1:24:04] don't change your mind when things start
[1:24:06] going backwards
[1:24:08] because if you start doing that amen
[1:24:10] you're never going to be able to trust
[1:24:12] the leading of the lord ever again
[1:24:15] because if you feel that this is of the
[1:24:17] lord stick with it amen
[1:24:19] if you feel god let your stick with it
[1:24:21] because every opposition will come
[1:24:23] just stick with it and let god direct
[1:24:25] your path let god leave
[1:24:27] let god turn don't start making your own
[1:24:29] decision just wait till god
[1:24:30] leads step by step by step and you'll
[1:24:33] find out you'll come right through the
[1:24:34] trial
[1:24:36] because it's ordained but we too many
[1:24:38] times we run from one opinion
[1:24:40] to another opinion we go from yeah this
[1:24:43] is of the lord no no i was wrong now
[1:24:44] this is of the lord no no i was wrong no
[1:24:46] this is of the lord
[1:24:47] amen once you believe something you
[1:24:49] stick with it amen
[1:24:51] and once we believe something in the
[1:24:53] word we stick with it amen
[1:24:54] and watch it work friends watch it work
[1:24:57] every time
[1:24:58] too many times we start to question and
[1:25:01] start to second guess
[1:25:02] when everything starts to go wrong amen
[1:25:04] it's going to go wrong
[1:25:06] everything's going to go wrong
[1:25:09] if you've lived long enough you know
[1:25:11] everything's going to go wrong but if
[1:25:12] you believe something stick with
[1:25:14] it and watch god work everything out
[1:25:20] praise god stay right with what you
[1:25:24] believe those three hebrew children
[1:25:27] they didn't know what god would do
[1:25:31] but they knew one thing they were going
[1:25:32] to compromise on the word and bow down
[1:25:34] to that image
[1:25:35] and they knew god could save him but
[1:25:37] they didn't know that he would
[1:25:40] but they stayed with it anyways
[1:25:44] he said now and when they faced
[1:25:47] when they faced faith was put to a test
[1:25:50] and they went through a crucial hour not
[1:25:52] only did they
[1:25:52] go to ashley but they went to a fiery
[1:25:54] furnace but satan could not destroy them
[1:25:57] for god's purpose
[1:25:58] wasn't yet fulfilled they could go in
[1:26:00] there with this hope
[1:26:01] i know my redeemer liveth they could go
[1:26:04] in there with this hope there
[1:26:05] we are assured that god is able to
[1:26:07] deliver us from this fiery furnace
[1:26:08] but nevertheless we will not bow to the
[1:26:11] image
[1:26:12] satan could not take them he could not
[1:26:14] drown no in the flood until the purpose
[1:26:16] of god had been finished
[1:26:17] he could not burn up the hebrew children
[1:26:19] until the purpose of god had been
[1:26:20] finished
[1:26:21] he could not kill job with boils and
[1:26:23] troubles until the purpose of god had
[1:26:24] been finished
[1:26:25] neither could the lions eat daniel until
[1:26:27] god's purpose had been finished
[1:26:29] neither could death and old age take
[1:26:31] abraham until the purpose of god had
[1:26:32] been finished
[1:26:33] and neither can it take you or can it
[1:26:35] take me until the purpose of god of our
[1:26:38] life is finished
[1:26:39] so we gather from their consolation
[1:26:43] and i'd like to say it this way if the
[1:26:45] purpose in this life is finished
[1:26:47] why would we want to stay one second
[1:26:49] longer
[1:26:51] the sixth dimension is beautiful brother
[1:26:53] branham went amen
[1:26:54] hope when she crossed over she had
[1:26:56] babies she had two
[1:26:58] babies a young mother young newly
[1:27:00] married with two babies
[1:27:01] when she crossed to the other side when
[1:27:03] bill when brother brown called her back
[1:27:05] she said why did you call me back and
[1:27:08] then i want to go
[1:27:09] she didn't want to come back to this
[1:27:11] side with two babies and a young husband
[1:27:14] you think that would have been the best
[1:27:15] that would have been the greatest love
[1:27:17] ever but she
[1:27:18] had entered into perfect love which was
[1:27:20] greater than mother's love
[1:27:22] greater than a love of an infant baby
[1:27:24] that she could snuggle with perfect love
[1:27:26] was greater than mother's love
[1:27:28] greater than baby's love brother branham
[1:27:31] when he went across he could look back
[1:27:33] and he could see his wife laying there
[1:27:34] he could see himself lying there
[1:27:38] and when they he felt that funny feeling
[1:27:40] and he said i don't have to go back do i
[1:27:44] i don't have to go back he could look
[1:27:46] back
[1:27:47] shouldn't he be shouldn't he be a good
[1:27:49] husband and want to go back where his
[1:27:51] wife is
[1:27:53] see he had entered in perfect love and
[1:27:56] there was not enough human language to
[1:27:58] explain what it was like
[1:27:59] i say friends if if god's purpose is
[1:28:02] done in our life
[1:28:04] why do we want to stay if god's purpose
[1:28:07] is not done in our life
[1:28:09] then we can't go no so what are we
[1:28:12] worried about
[1:28:14] so we're really the reality and the
[1:28:15] truth really hits home
[1:28:17] what are we worried about we can't go
[1:28:20] before our time
[1:28:21] if it's our time we don't want to stay
[1:28:26] believers don't fear death death is a
[1:28:28] release for us
[1:28:30] desert is a release to a far better
[1:28:32] place it's not a fearful thing for us
[1:28:34] it's a blessing it's a reward it's a
[1:28:36] beautiful transition
[1:28:40] amen brother brahma says
[1:28:44] and why does god let troubles come
[1:28:47] it's a good question and why does god
[1:28:50] let troubles come
[1:28:52] god harnesses trouble puts bits in its
[1:28:54] mouth and makes it obey him
[1:28:56] and those troubles bring us into a
[1:28:58] closer fellowship with god
[1:29:00] there had been no rainbow until the
[1:29:02] flood came but after noah was pressed
[1:29:04] into that condition
[1:29:05] that he was in to float 40 days and
[1:29:07] nights in a storm
[1:29:08] and that little ark pitching up and down
[1:29:10] in the water it was after the flood was
[1:29:12] over that he saw the rainbow for its
[1:29:13] first time
[1:29:14] the covenant of hope the covenant of
[1:29:16] promise after he went through the
[1:29:18] tribulation then he saw the promise
[1:29:21] that's the way you see the promise after
[1:29:23] you've gone through the tribulation
[1:29:25] i've liked that poem or psalm must i be
[1:29:27] carried home to heaven on a flowery bed
[1:29:29] of ease
[1:29:29] while others fought to win the prize and
[1:29:31] sailed through bloody seas
[1:29:33] we ask for comfort and peace god gives
[1:29:36] us the best he could give us
[1:29:38] trials and tribulations that's better
[1:29:41] than comfort and peace
[1:29:42] our comforts is just beyond the river
[1:29:46] it wasn't until the hebrew children was
[1:29:48] forced into the fiery furnace on one of
[1:29:50] their most outstanding trials that they
[1:29:52] seen one like the son of god standing
[1:29:54] among them
[1:29:55] their troubles produced the son of god
[1:29:57] standing among them
[1:29:59] in the breezes to wave away the heat
[1:30:01] wave but not until they went to the fire
[1:30:03] did that comforter appear
[1:30:07] i wonder if they regret that
[1:30:11] i wonder if they regret seeing the
[1:30:13] comforter seeing one like the son of god
[1:30:14] come and rescue them
[1:30:16] i wonder if they regretted their stand
[1:30:17] if they regretted the anxiety if they
[1:30:19] regretted the stress if they regretted
[1:30:20] the fear
[1:30:21] walking up to be thrown into fire or
[1:30:23] were they glad that they took their
[1:30:24] stand
[1:30:25] or were they happy that they endured to
[1:30:27] the end i don't think we're ever going
[1:30:29] to regret having faith in standing on
[1:30:31] faith i don't think we'll ever regret
[1:30:32] whatever trials come whatever troubles
[1:30:35] come but if we just take our stand and
[1:30:37] stand on faith i don't think we'll ever
[1:30:38] regret it
[1:30:47] it see that was daniel who had purposed
[1:30:50] in his heart
[1:30:51] that he not defiled himself with the
[1:30:52] things of the world and was forced
[1:30:54] through a trial
[1:30:54] whether he'd pray to god or go to a
[1:30:56] lion's den but it was after the heat was
[1:30:58] put on he was thrown into a lion's den
[1:31:01] then that after that he saw the angel of
[1:31:03] the lord standing in the midst of him
[1:31:05] keeping away the great pillar of fire
[1:31:06] standing between him and the lions
[1:31:08] and the lions could not get him because
[1:31:10] he'd went through the trials and
[1:31:11] temptations and troubles
[1:31:12] he knew that his god was able to deliver
[1:31:14] him from that
[1:31:16] it was abraham after he'd seen the
[1:31:17] ground get barren and the drought come
[1:31:19] and lot separate himself and go down to
[1:31:21] live deliciously
[1:31:22] into the world it was after he had heard
[1:31:24] the wines and cries of his herdsmen with
[1:31:26] no grass for his cattle
[1:31:28] but he maintained in the land that god
[1:31:30] gave him and told him to sow jordan in
[1:31:32] and as as on that day after he had been
[1:31:34] tried
[1:31:35] till his patience was at the end it was
[1:31:37] on that day
[1:31:39] that when after the trial was over he
[1:31:41] spoke face to face with elohim under the
[1:31:43] oak that day
[1:31:44] it was after he'd suffered his trials
[1:31:47] after he went through the troubles
[1:31:48] that he'd been through that god appeared
[1:31:50] to him in the form of a man
[1:31:52] and sat there and told him he was
[1:31:54] married in his wife's name of sarah
[1:31:56] and said she laughed at him in the tent
[1:31:58] behind it was there that abraham called
[1:32:00] him
[1:32:00] elohim it was after the trial and
[1:32:03] tribulation
[1:32:07] what did the trial and tribulation
[1:32:09] produce
[1:32:11] a greater revelation of him
[1:32:16] what does the trial and tribulation
[1:32:17] produce for us friends
[1:32:19] a greater revelation of him
[1:32:23] some of us have been through some hard
[1:32:24] things
[1:32:26] but i'd venture to say there's harder
[1:32:28] things coming yet
[1:32:30] but what does it produce a greater
[1:32:32] revelation
[1:32:33] of him a greater it was
[1:32:36] after the trial that they saw the
[1:32:38] promise it was
[1:32:40] after they made their stand that they
[1:32:42] saw one like the son of man
[1:32:43] it was after abraham had made his choice
[1:32:46] and was suffering for it when lot was
[1:32:48] living the lips it was after that
[1:32:50] that he met god face to face
[1:32:53] and i said god don't let me try
[1:32:56] to avoid what you're trying to bring
[1:32:59] from my good
[1:33:00] don't me try to circumvent what you're
[1:33:03] trying to do to bring a greater
[1:33:04] revelation of yourself to me
[1:33:06] but help me have faith that you who
[1:33:08] allowed this it's for a purpose
[1:33:10] you who brought me down this road it's
[1:33:12] for a reason it wasn't in vain
[1:33:14] it wasn't aimless it wasn't for no
[1:33:16] reason and it wasn't so that the devil
[1:33:18] could have his way from
[1:33:19] with me it was so that you could reveal
[1:33:21] yourself to me
[1:33:22] and through me god now wants to manifest
[1:33:27] manifest himself where in me
[1:33:31] do you believe that does god want to
[1:33:33] manifest himself in you
[1:33:36] how is he going to manifest himself in
[1:33:38] you
[1:33:39] it'll be in the face of everything
[1:33:42] that's contrary to that life
[1:33:45] everything that's contrary to that
[1:33:47] nature to those characteristics
[1:33:49] that's how he's always manifested
[1:33:51] himself in the bible
[1:33:53] and that's how he wants to manifest
[1:33:55] himself in you
[1:33:58] don't be afraid of what comes next
[1:34:02] let's all stand musicians come don't be
[1:34:05] afraid
[1:34:09] sometimes i wonder if we're not so
[1:34:12] worried that we're going to have a trial
[1:34:15] that we create undue anxiety about this
[1:34:18] could go wrong or that could go wrong or
[1:34:20] we might have this
[1:34:23] i wonder what that looks like to god
[1:34:27] when he tells us in his word and his
[1:34:29] message
[1:34:30] who we are and his plans that he has for
[1:34:33] us
[1:34:34] and the works that he's ordained for us
[1:34:39] i wonder if we couldn't just adjust our
[1:34:42] vision just a little bit
[1:34:44] and just adjust our mindset a little bit
[1:34:48] and say if this is what god wants
[1:34:51] this is what i want
[1:34:55] if this is what if the three hebrew
[1:34:58] children
[1:34:59] only could read the bible we read
[1:35:02] it would have relieved a lot of stress
[1:35:06] if they could have only read the story
[1:35:08] after the fact they would have been
[1:35:10] totally different
[1:35:12] i mean if abraham could have read what
[1:35:13] we read i mean those 25 years of waiting
[1:35:16] and all the contention with lot that
[1:35:17] have been no big deal
[1:35:19] but that's not how god does it but he
[1:35:22] put all of those stories there for us
[1:35:25] he put all of those examples there for
[1:35:26] us and put the life of the prophet on
[1:35:28] display
[1:35:29] for us so that we could say
[1:35:33] god you know the way that i take you
[1:35:36] know the path that you want from me if
[1:35:38] this
[1:35:38] is what you want this is what i want if
[1:35:41] this is the way you want to reveal
[1:35:43] yourself to me
[1:35:44] then i say blessed be the name of the
[1:35:46] lord if this is how you want to get
[1:35:48] glory to your name then i say blessed be
[1:35:50] the name of the lord
[1:35:51] let me not amen change my confession
[1:35:55] let me not back down that i know i'm a
[1:35:57] child of god
[1:35:58] i know god knows the way i take and i
[1:36:00] know god has a purpose in this
[1:36:04] i don't think i don't think
[1:36:12] things are going to get easier and
[1:36:13] easier and easier
[1:36:15] i think things are going to continue to
[1:36:17] be difficult
[1:36:18] they've been difficult all our lives why
[1:36:21] should we expect anything different
[1:36:23] they've been difficult through the whole
[1:36:25] walk why should we expect it different
[1:36:27] it's been difficult through the whole
[1:36:28] bible
[1:36:28] why should we expect anything different
[1:36:32] i say let's come to terms with it now
[1:36:34] god
[1:36:35] has already ordained things to happen
[1:36:39] god has already already placed the seed
[1:36:42] within
[1:36:43] and inside that is the potential to
[1:36:45] overcome everything
[1:36:46] but there's no reason to unlock that
[1:36:48] potential until there's a need
[1:36:52] and in the face of the need god will
[1:36:54] come up
[1:36:56] god will manifest himself and god will
[1:36:58] conquer that thing
[1:37:00] we want to see god mighty but we don't
[1:37:02] want to go through trouble we see god
[1:37:04] mighty when we go through trouble
[1:37:06] and i want to say god i'm yours
[1:37:11] i'm yours you have me i'm yours
[1:37:15] i believe you knew me before the
[1:37:17] foundation of the world i believe you've
[1:37:19] ordained the road that i'll take i
[1:37:20] believe you've ordained my steps
[1:37:22] and i want to make a declaration and say
[1:37:24] lord i want to trust you with all of my
[1:37:27] heart
[1:37:27] every step of the way help me not to
[1:37:29] give a negative confession help me not
[1:37:31] to let doubt
[1:37:32] and anxiety rule but help me to believe
[1:37:35] what i believe right now
[1:37:36] in the face of trial help me to confess
[1:37:38] what i can confess right now
[1:37:40] in the midst of a trial god is going to
[1:37:43] get glory on this earth
[1:37:45] god is going to show himself mighty on
[1:37:47] this earth god is going to display his
[1:37:49] attributes on this earth
[1:37:52] and he needs a vessel to do it and i
[1:37:55] want to yield mine to him
[1:37:58] the potentials where and the seed
[1:38:01] but god is going to make sure all that
[1:38:04] potential comes out
[1:38:05] and gets on display and it's not
[1:38:08] skipping through a
[1:38:09] field full of daisies it's in the face
[1:38:12] of hardship and difficulty
[1:38:14] i say god you can be god
[1:38:18] and i want to be your bride let's just
[1:38:20] pray lord jesus we thank you father
[1:38:24] god we thank you for your word god it

[1:38:42] who was hungry

[1:38:45] bible

[1:41:32] oh god
[1:41:33] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[1:41:39] how many of you believe we're going to
[1:41:40] see supernaturally
[1:41:42] in the bride
[1:41:46] are we going to see supernatural in the
[1:41:48] face of no difficulty
[1:41:51] what do you need the supernatural for if
[1:41:54] there's no difficulty
[1:41:56] no strain no impossibility but you only
[1:41:59] see the miraculous
[1:42:01] when you're faced with the impossible
[1:42:03] you only see the supernatural
[1:42:05] when the natural will no longer work so
[1:42:08] i believe we're going to see the
[1:42:09] supernatural hand of god i believe god's
[1:42:11] made promises to his bride
[1:42:12] i believe god is going to supernaturally
[1:42:14] move and deliver on his bride
[1:42:16] but i believe just like the bible if
[1:42:18] we're going to see that then we've got
[1:42:20] to let we've got to convince ourselves
[1:42:22] now not to be afraid when darkness comes
[1:42:25] not to be afraid when difficulty comes
[1:42:27] not to get nervous when the
[1:42:28] possibilities come
[1:42:30] amen and there's no natural possibility
[1:42:32] for a solution
[1:42:33] we got to tell ourselves now don't get
[1:42:36] nervous then because
[1:42:37] that's when he's going to move how many
[1:42:40] times have difficulties come
[1:42:43] and god hasn't poured out a blessing
[1:42:46] tough tough times tough difficult
[1:42:49] circumstances even difficulties in the
[1:42:52] church
[1:42:52] that afterwards god hasn't poured his
[1:42:54] word out and brought us up higher
[1:42:58] amen this is the way god lifts you up
[1:43:01] and you grow something terrible happens
[1:43:05] and god's word overcomes and you grow
[1:43:08] you're just difficulty growth difficulty
[1:43:11] growth
[1:43:12] difficulty growth it's just the way it
[1:43:13] is friends
[1:43:16] and i want to i myself i want to be able
[1:43:19] to stand still
[1:43:21] and see the salvation of my god
[1:43:24] i don't want to be tossed to and fro i
[1:43:27] don't want to be
[1:43:28] like the rest of the world i want to be
[1:43:30] like a child of god and i want a greater
[1:43:32] i want a greater faith in me i want a
[1:43:36] greater faith
[1:43:37] to be expressed out of me that when when
[1:43:39] when it looks impossible
[1:43:42] i want to have faith like shamgar had
[1:43:45] i want to have faith like samson had i
[1:43:48] want to have faith like the three hebrew
[1:43:50] children had
[1:43:50] that's the i want to have faith like
[1:43:52] daniel had
[1:43:54] that's what i think is going to be
[1:43:55] expressed in the bride in this that
[1:43:57] this day and if it's going to be
[1:43:59] expressed
[1:44:00] then he's going to have to put
[1:44:02] stabilizers on the ship
[1:44:04] and make us a promise ahead of time so
[1:44:08] that we wouldn't falter and fail
