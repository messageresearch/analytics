ourselves into you as we worship you lord now as we look into your word we pray god that you would do what no man can do but that you would come and break the bread of life with your own hands lord that you would feed your waiting sheep that we might receive the portion that we have need of god that you might lead us in the way that is right and that you might be glorified in all we say or do for we commit this service into your hands we commit ourselves into your hands and pray that you would take preeminence among us be blessed be glorified and may your children be edified we ask in jesus christ's name amen man god bless you all it's good to see you this morning while we're standing if we could turn to matthew chapter two we'll begin with that verse now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea and the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him may the lord add the blessing to the reading of the word as you seeded may god have his way amen i wanted to start in the scripture this is not exactly where i'm heading to but i'd like to take for a text this morning by the grace of god the stumbling stone is the foundation stone so if we can register that in our minds it's a simple message but is this something that's heavy on my heart the stumbling stone is the foundation stone so we see here and we know so much about christmas and this is christmas season and and so you know you see that the wise men they journeyed from the east because they were led by a star and a star was leading them uh leading them to christ they knew by the star that christ was on earth and he was born king of the jews and so they went to jerusalem because it seemed like the most logical place to go so if there's a star that's indicating that that christ is born then you would go to the headquarters of the religion of the world in that day and you would go to the to the main headquarters of the main system and you would go there to look for this christ that's come amen but when the wise men got there it seemed as nobody knew what they were talking about they had seen the star the wise men had but those in the system hadn't seen the star they were blinded to it amen others could see it from outside the system but the ones who were in the system that was supposed to be god's system they were blind to the star that was indicating that christ was on earth and brother venom says in the message there is a man here that can turn on the light said oh we have seen his star in the east and we come to worship him and when they lined up in jerusalem the denominational headquarters they didn't have the answer they went up and down the streets crying where is he born king of the jews they know nothing about it so they called on the word to find out they had followed know that star was leading them to eternal light again brother brahm says in god's rap gift as long as they was in them denominational realms that star never did appear to them it went out of the gates of jerusalem and stayed out brother stayed out as long as they walked through those denominational realms where is he surely you pastors ought to know something about it what's this all about you rabbis and you priests and you methodists and baptist presbyterian catholics and you old churches like that surely you got an answer for it where is he oh my see they know nothing about it and them that were in there stayed in darkness till they came out of it so when the wise men were there they lost sight in the denominational church when they went into jerusalem into the walled city into the denominational walls they lost sight of that star so they were depending on the rabbis and the religious leaders to tell them they knew that that star was indicating christ was on earth and they followed the leadership of that star to come to the headquarters of the religion of that day and surely in here they would know where this christ where this fulfillment of the word for our day is taking place and when they were in the walled city in the denominational walls they lost sight of the star and they could not see it until they walked back out of the gate and when they left that system the star appeared again and we know that we followed a star in this day the seventh star amen the seventh angel the messenger amen and that messenger has led us to christ and that messenger indicated that christ is on the earth again amen and in the walled cities they know nothing about it amen they don't know what you're talking about you go to the to the religious systems to the headquarters of religion in this day and you ask them amen that star amen i saw that star amen the seventh star showing me that christ is coming this day amen and you asked them about that and they blank stairs we don't know we didn't see any star we don't know what you're talking about and as long as they stayed in there they stayed in darkness till they came out and as soon as they got out of the city there stood the star again let's look here in matthew chapter 2 down to verse 9. this is the wise men again when they heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy it wasn't that the star was not able to lead them all the way to christ is when the star appeared amen from the east to the west and it appeared amen it was near jerusalem and because bethlehem was not far from jerusalem amen then because they knew christ was here they went to the most logical place to find him but he wasn't there because christ can't be born in the system he has to be born outside the walls of the system and when christ came in this day he did not come in the system he had to come outside the system you have to find him outside the systems of man and outside the religious orders of the day amen because he's not going to be found in such he's not going to be bound by such amen but where did they find him they found him amen where the where the where the word said they would find him and bethlehem the house of god's bread because he was the manna that came down from god out of heaven he was our portion to feast on and in this day he's the manna that's come down from heaven again amen in our portion of the word for this day to feast on amen and he was not born amen in a system he was not born in a walled city praise god brother brahma says in the message of guide so you see these wise men remember when they entered into jerusalem the star disappeared and as long as you look for creeds and denominational men to lead you to god the help of god will leave you but when you get sick and tired of it and left them left the creeds and denominations of those jews and went out of jerusalem then the star appeared again and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy you know when when the prophet of god was here the seventh angel that star and the hand of god amen he was shining and as he began to shine he began to indicate that now it's time for christ to return to the church and he was shining that star was shining over jerusalem trying to get the attention of the church but they didn't see it and they testified to the wise men that they didn't know what they were talking about amen and it was shining over them trying to get their attention and the prophet of god in our day amen he was shining that light over all the denominations amen but they were blind and could not see what the star was showing amen they saw a movement they saw a work they saw healing campaigns they saw discernment and they heard testimonies but they didn't recognize what the star was for they couldn't see the position of the star and the timing of the star and the appearance of the constellation showing what time we are on earth and it's time for him to appear and so the systems missed it they didn't know anything about it amen because he didn't show up in the systems he was just shining over them to get their attention but but you couldn't find him there for he was outside the walls and in order to be united with him do you brother bam told us you have to go beyond the camp you have to go outside jerusalem for he was born outside jerusalem and he was crucified outside jerusalem amen he was rejected and he was cast out and he was crucified and now to be united with the one who came to save us to be united with the one who came to redeem us he was born outside the system and he was crucified outside the system in order to be united with him you yourself have to go outside of the system and when you step outside of the system sure enough that star that seven star is there to lead you all the way to christ because christ is the same as he was in that day he is today for he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what was he in that day he was the very word of god the prophecy for that day made manifest in flesh that's what he was what is he today the very same thing he was in that day he is the word of god the prophecy for this day made flesh and manifest in this day what he was then he is today he's the same yesterday today and forever then he was a baby laying in a manger now he's being formed into the bride but what is it the same jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what has he always been he has always been the word made flesh in your day that's what he was in moses day that's what he is today making him the same in moses day as he is in this day not the same actions not the same thing you see with your eyes but the very same christ that was with moses is the very same christ that's with the bride today he's the same yesterday today and forever that's what makes him the same he is the word made manifest in the day and the hour that we live in people want to see the same they want to see the same picture the same image the same nail prints in the hands the same scar upon the brow the same shoulder length hair the same beard they want to see jesus christ the same in the same physical appearance in the same image and that's why they can't see him because he's the same but not in the same manifestation he was in the proper manifestation for that day and now he's in the proper manifestation for this day making him the same yesterday today and forever if you want to find him that was born king of the jews you want to find him that is the head and the husband to the bride amen you have to go outside the city and you got to let the star lead you to him praise be to god let's go to luke chapter 2. it's interesting when you get into christmas time and christmas season and hear you know so many people talk about christmas and christmas stories and and i'm sure in churches all over america last sunday and wednesday and this sunday there's christmas sermons and but but there's so much that is missed when the star hasn't led you to christ we're talking about tradition and we're talking about things that have come and things that have gone and been things that where christ was but nobody's talking about where christ is or at least there's very few that's talking about where christ is today we're talking about a christmas story that happened 2000 years ago and not realizing that he came now that he's here among us amen that we're not looking back amen we're looking to the day that we live in to find christ and so the christmas story for us is not an old story and the christmas story for us is not a one time of your story but the christmas story for us is god's wrapped gift and god's wrapped gift is still here it's just in a different package it's just in a different wrapping it's not wrapped the same way it was wrapped in that day when his gift showed up there was a wrapping in that day and he was wrapped in swaddling cloth amen that was the rapping that day a baby in a manger and that body of flesh amen but it's the same gift that was there is the same gift that's here amen this is christmas for us too but it's just a different package it's wrapped in a different wrapping amen so don't let the rapping throw you off it's the same gift for us every day is christmas amen amen we're living because this gift is now wrapped in you and i that swaddling cloth brother venom said that they wrapped that first christmas gift in they said he goes i was told it was a it was an old cloth taken off a yoke of an ox just an old dirty cloth put there to to to put a cushion between the wooden yoke and the ox's neck so it was dirty it had ox hair in it smelled like hot ox and had ox sweat and that was what was taken and and that's what brother ben tells us that he was told he'd taken and wrapped jesus in that and that swaddling cloth amen and if god amen could allow himself to come into flesh and be birthed as the son of god upon this earth and allow that precious son to be wrapped in such a dirty such a such an unwanted and undesirable rapping can he wrap himself in you today amen amen how can he not use you if he can use a a a yolk a cloth out of a yoke for a swaddling cloth can he wrap himself in you and i today amen they're still he's here amen the gift is here but but don't look at the package look what's inside the package the gift isn't the wrapping the gift is inside amen let's look at luke chapter 2 verse 21 and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcision of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every male that opened at the womb shall be called holy to the lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons and behold there was a man excuse me in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lord's christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he up in his arms and blessed god and said lord now let us thy thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel and joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yea a sword shall pierce through thine own so also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed so i want to pay attention to those last two verses that we read verse 34 and 35 i want to look at this if you look at the beginning of verse 35 there's a there's a statement in parentheses and the state in parentheses is is another thought it's an injected thought injected into the sentence and is telling that yeah a sword shall pierce through thine own so also amen because she was going to see the sufferings of christ but but so i don't want to read that when i read the context of what simeon's saying because that's an injected thought so i want to go back and pick this up and i'm just not going to read that part he says behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel so when when simeon picks up this baby and we know that this is the christ child when he picks up this this prophesied word this word made flesh and he's holding in his arms when we listen to christmas stories and nominal denominational teaching on christmas amen it was jesus who come to to save the world and that that's absolutely the truth but simeon says this child is set for the fall of many he didn't just come for blessings but he also come for the fall that's why the denominational understanding will never give you the full picture because they water the gospel down so much to where the only thing they ever talk about is what's pleasant to hear the the blessings of what god gave and and how we're saved but this child was set for the fallen rising again in many in israel that because christ came israel was going to fall and god was going to turn from them to another people because of this child this child is going to be the downfalling of israel because he's prophesied to be enlightened to the gentiles so this child amen when we sing the songs and you go into stores and hear all the songs but people don't realize when the word is made flesh amen in the word amen comes and makes and makes himself flesh and is manifest among us amen it accomplishes two things it brings judgment to some and liberty to others and simeon picks up this child and say this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel because israel has to fall so that he can be a light to lighten the gentiles but by his grace he'll raise israel again under the prophetic under the two witnesses under the prophetic ministry in revelations 11. so this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel that wasn't the part of the christmas story we wanted to talk about this child is set for the fallen rising again in many many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against he's also come he's set he's established he's placed here to be a sign that will be spoken against that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed now when he says that the thoughts of many hearts might be revealed he's not talking about the gift of discernment that jesus would discern their thoughts he's not talking about that what he's talking about is that this child this manifested word this promise for this day coming into manifestation is set here to be for the fall and rising again and many of israel is set here to be a sign that will be spoken against that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed amen because when they speak against this sign it'll show that they're unbelievers and not part of christ this sign is set here to expose the thoughts of the hearts they were in a religious system and that religious system amen and had come to the pinnacle amen and it had it had man's ideas mixed in and separated into denominations but they had a great system a powerful system amen they were influential in politics they had jerusalem as their headquarters they had all of this amen and god was going to set amongst them a sign a virgin shall conceive this shall be a sign a virgin shall conceive and this sign shall be spoken against that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed amen because when they begin to speak against the sign they showed that they were not part of the word that they did not believe moses and they didn't love god and that sign was set he was set for the fall i don't know anybody who preaches like this on christmas merry christmas he came for the fall of israel and for the rising again of many americans he came so israel will fall so the gentiles could rise and later so the gentiles could fall so he could turn to the jews again he came for the falling of some for the raising of others he came to be a sign that would be spoken against amen god knew he was prophesying the holy ghost speaking through simeon knew that they were not going to accept this sign they were not going to accept this gift and he came as such he came for such he came to do the dividing and the separating because when the word is made manifest it automatically begins to separate and for a sign which shall be spoken against that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed so if you want to know why jesus came and was set up on the earth this is why simeon tells us amen isaiah 7 14 is the prophecy that we referenced it says therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel emmanuel means god with us and so here's the sign the sign is that god is with us and this sign of god with us will be spoken against so that many of the hearts many hearts the thoughts of the hearts may be made may be revealed so i want to turn to isaiah chapter 8 together i just want to build on this thought brother branham says in the message c does not heir with the shock he said soon lord we're all going to pass that way i too must go that way every man and woman boy or girl in here has to go that way and we will be accountable for what we do with the word of god amen that's what that what's what he he was saying through simeon when he said he shall be a sign that shall be spoken against what were they speaking against they were speaking against the word of god and it was manifesting revealing what was in the heart isaiah 8 13 let's read this together sanctify the lord of hosts himself and let him be your fear and let him be your dread and he shall be for a sanctuary but for a but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the house of israel for a jinn and for a snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem and many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken how because the lord will come according to his word and the lord will be for a sanctuary for some for others he will be he will be a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense because he will be a sign that's spoken against and when they speak against that sign that sign becomes a stumbling stone to them a stone of stumbling in a rock of offense to both the house of israel for a jinn a jinn as a trap for a gin for a snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem and many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken man let's go over to isaiah 28. isaiah 28 and verse 16 isaiah 28 16 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious cornerstone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste we're talking about two stones no we're talking about one stone this is the same stone to one he's a stone of stumbling a rock of offense to the other he's a sure foundation to the one he's a sign that's spoken against amen to reveal their hearts to the other there's going to be some simple people upon the earth who are uneducated and not high ranking in the religion but they're going to recognize that this is christ the son of the living god and it's going to reveal that there's something in their heart that's not in the pharisee's heart amen so the the stone of stumbling is the foundation stone it's the same stone one will trip over the stone and fall the other will stand upon the stone and be unmovable to one it is their demise to the others they're building up amen to one it is the rejection to the other it's going to be their acceptance it depends on what's down inside of you and what you do with the word when you come in contact with it for some the word the word is a revelation a revelation is a stone in the bible for some the stone of the revelation of the word is always a stepping a tripping stone a stumbling stone and they're constantly falling over the word that's made manifest in this hour stumbling over christ but for others amen who have something inside of them that was placed in them before the foundation of the world they've got a faith that they didn't conjure up that's not intellectual or mental but there's a part of god a part of that word and when they come to the stumbling stone for them it's not a stumbling stone for them it's a sure foundation a rock a true stone a tried stone amen and it makes them not to stumble but it keeps them from stumbling it prevents them it's one for one it creates the fall for the other it prevents the fall it's not two stones one stone remember when israel was coming out of egypt amen and they they came down to the red sea and they got themselves in a in a bind in a corner they couldn't get out amen and the egyptian army was coming down to slay them the pillar of fire moved behind them and became a wall between them and to the egyptians to the egyptians it was darkness to them it was light amen it was not darkness and light two objects it was the same christ the same pillar of fire the same angel of the covenant to the chosen elected it was light to the non-elect it was blackness and darkness amen and god amen plays both parts amen he's to one darkness he's the one judgment he's the one condemnation but to the other he's salvation he's redemption he's their vindication just depends on which side you find yourself let's go to matthew 16. matthew chapter 16. we know this really well but i want to read it together i'd say it this way that first christmas which we know was in march or april not december because the season when lambs were born for some it was the greatest day in the greatest event of their lives for others it was the beginning of the end for them the same birth the same announcement from angels the same prophecy being fulfilled the same the same thing that came amen to be the greatest event that ever happened for one group of people became the worst thing that ever happened for another group of people amen we have to understand that this is the word that this is christ matthew 16 13. when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said they said say some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah are one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am that's when we really get to the question not who do men say that i am there's all kinds of ideas and people say all kinds of things amen and jesus asked the question who do men say that i am he asked him the question he wanted to know their response and they could identify what other people said about him but he wanted to move past what other people said about them and wanted to know what they said about him because you know there's a lot of people around us who have things to say amen about the message of the hour about the coming of the prophet amen the ministry of william branham and the ministry of christ the son of man in this day they have all kinds of things to say about it amen there's people all over the world who have something to say amen and you can repeat what somebody else is saying somebody says that the message is this and somebody says brother branham was this and he fulfilled that amen but christ wants to come down to your seat and say who do you say this is amen not what mom and dad said not what the pastor said not what everybody else my church believes amen you might as well throw that dialogue right out the window because it doesn't matter to god what your church believes what matters to god is what you believe amen and what your church believes may be fine and it may not be fine amen god's the one who'll determine that but god he may ask what does your church believe well we believe brother brennan was this and we believe that christ has come and we believe this and this and this is the hour of this manifestation beautiful now what do you say amen can you from your heart say the same thing that they're saying are you just repeating again what you've heard because you can see when they begin to talk about what everybody else said about christ there was mass confusion some say john the baptist some say elias some say jeremiah some say one of the other prophets if you're going to take what everybody else around is saying you're going to get caught up in mass confusion because was it jeremiah's is it john the baptist amen is it is it one of the other prophets who is it amen we've heard all of these voices we heard he's come we heard he's coming we heard the millennium's already on we heard that there's no physical rapture it's only a spiritual we've heard all kinds of things who do you say this is who do men say well there's some churches believe this and there's some ministries believe that and some people say this we're going to keep going down that line we're going to be utterly confused amen but he wanted to go deeper than that below the ability to hear what somebody says he wants to get down to the root amen because this christ came he was set and established upon this earth this baby to reveal the hearts of many and what's he doing now with peter he's about to reveal what's down inside of peter amen because that's why he came to reveal the thoughts of meaning that he would be assigned spoken against to reveal the thoughts of many peter and the disciples they'd heard so many things but jesus said but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said hour to christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven you can never get this by natural ears you can never get this by hearing and repeating you did not get this by flesh you got this from my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it [Music] brother branham says in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says now now say my church my church has nothing to do with it it's an individual one person all hell is against this teaching all hell is against this truth but it is the truth jesus never said now peter you and john and all the rest of the people you've got the revelation now the whole church is safe no it was to him personally i say to thee not to them to thee thou art peter upon this rock i'll build my church and the word peter means a stone a stone means to confess one or a separated one upon a certain stone upon a certain thing sia called out the church called out upon this stone upon this revelation flesh and blood never revealed it to you but upon the revelation called out group i'll build my church in them and all the gates of hell shall never be able to withstand it what was he he was the rock of offense what was who was the one speaking to the disciples the stumbling stone the stumbling stone the rock of offense he was the one speaking to the multitudes he was the one now speaking to his disciples and when he spoke to his disciples he was the rock of offense but he was also the sure foundation a tried stone a sure stone an unmovable stone and so now he's testing peter to see whether to peter he'll be a rock of offense or to peter he'll be a sure foundation because it depends on the revelation peter has as who he is and that revelation didn't come from peter that revelation came from the father because that revelation was in the father and now that revelation that was in the father a part of the father is now in peter and so that revelation can only be of the father and so he's looking to find out amen to peter am i a stone of stumbling or am i a sure foundation and peter said he said we believe that thou art christ the son of the living god he said flesh and blood never revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church what rock the rock of revelation of who the word is the sure foundation right then he was becoming to them the sure foundation the tried stone the immovable rock amen and he says and i'll plant my church upon this rock and the gates of hell shall never prevail against amen the gates of hell shall never prevail against it that means the gates of hell will come against it but the gates of hell shall never prevail against it it did not say the gates of hell shall never come near it he said the gates of hell shall never prevail against it so the gates of hell will come against it that's why you cannot have your house built upon the sand but your house must be built upon the rock that rock of the revelation of who jesus christ is he is the word made manifest in our day and upon that rock the gates of hell shall never prevail so to one he's a stumbling stone to the other he's the sure foundation and when the church is founded upon this sure foundation the gates of hell cannot prevail for those who are not those who are not founded upon this revelation the same revelation that makes you firm on a foundation that cannot be shaken that same foundation without revelation becomes a stumbling stone and you fall let's turn to ephesians chapter two ephesians chapter 2. in verse 19. i want to read several scriptures back to back here ephesians chapter 2 verse 19. now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone and whom all the buildings fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of god through the spirit so jesus christ in this foundation he is the chief cornerstone he is the first and the last he's the alpha omega he's the beginning of this structure the sure foundation and the cornerstone the cornerstone is what sets the rest of the building amen when you set the cornerstone its angles and dimensions will set the rest of the building so everything must be built off of jesus christ the sure foundation the tried stone he was the perfect representation of god on the earth he was the perfect god man he became the cornerstone he became the measurement he became the he became the beginning the setting stone that sets in place that everyone else must measure off of this stone and when we build up this tabernacle this habitation for god what's he building he's building a bride but that bride must begin with the perfect image of god the perfect man the perfect god man sets the dimensions for that building that building is built off the example of christ and he is the sure foundation he is the tried stone he is the cornerstone and off that foundation there's a building that's being built let's go to first corinthians chapter 3. first corinthians chapter 3 and verse 10. according according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon for other foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is jesus christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones hay or stubble every man's work shall be made manifest so now paul's saying i as a master builder have laid the foundation so paul the apostle amen he set the foundation with christ as the chief cornerstone amen the chief cornerstone and paul the apostle laid out the foundation of this building that's why when we find the building in ruin when we find amen the the the uh the the bride tree in ruin amen at the end time there's going to be a prophet who has to go back to the foundation because paul the wise master builder laid the sure foundation and he laid it true and he laid it straight what this church is supposed to be but paul never claimed that he finished this building paul laid the foundation he said another man builds upon so when brother benham comes to bring us back to the sure foundation that the apostle paul had laid to establish the church to set forth the bride amen he's got to bring us back and lay the stones back in place and bring it back to the foundation that the wise master builder laid that's why he says i preached what paul preached he had to come back and lay it back right again and build the church ages back upon that correctly leaving out what was added on but see paul never finished that building paul laid paul knew that if i lay the foundation correctly and i get the cornerstone in place amen the cornerstone guarantees that the building will be finished correctly because everything must be built to the dimensions of christ the god-man god and flesh so when remember brother bennum comes back and begins to rebuild amen and becomes comes back and takes us back to the foundation and lays the stones in place according to the proper foundation restoring the church back to the original word the original faith of the fathers amen from there he can go on to complete the building because the building was meant to be completed but paul didn't complete it that's why you can't just go back there and stay back there you've got to go back to the foundation lay everything straight again man you got to move to the capstone friends you can't stay with the building incomplete the goal was to have a complete building but the cornerstone told you what the complete building was going to look like the complete building was going to look like the cornerstone every stone was going to match every stone was going to fit into its place and it was going to make when it was finished the whole building would reflect the cornerstone the cornerstone was foreshowing the building amen let's go to romans chapter 9. romans chapter 9 verse 32. wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling stone as it is written behold i lay in zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so he's laying out a stumbling stone but if you believe on that stumbling stone you'll never be ashamed you'll never be moved you'll never be ashamed let's go to first peter chapter 2. first peter chapter 2 verse 4. to whom coming is unto a living stone [Music] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious ye also as lively stones or built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scriptures behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believeth he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of a fence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed they were appointed to stumble at the stumbling stone that's why simeon could say what simeon said because he is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign that shall be spoken against that many of the thoughts of the hearts shall be revealed and so it's saying here to us and therefore to do which believe he is precious he is the foundation stone he is the precious stone he is the tridestone but other than which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same as made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient when they were stumbling at christ they were stumbling at the word when they were stumbling at the manifestation in that day the man christ jesus when he was on earth they were stumbling over one coming from nazareth they were stumbling over you being a man make yourself god they were stumbling what were they stumbling over they were stumbling over the word and they were supposed to be the guardians of the word the oracles of god amen the great church that was guarding the truths of god amen and here come the truth and the manifestation and that truth for them that they thought they were guarding they began to trip over and fall but to harlots and prostitutes and tax collectors and fishermen he became a sure foundation a tried stone he became the setting stone that set them immovable unshakable amen set them undefeatable against the enemy because they were stumbling at the word he says uh in hebrews chapter four let's turn there together hebrews chapter four i'm going to start reading from verse 12. for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder a soul and spirit and the joints in the morrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart what is the discerner the word so when the word comes in the manifestation just like in that day when simeon said he shall be a sign that sign was the word made flesh shall be a sign that shall be spoken against at the hearts of many the thoughts of many hearts shall be made manifest amen what was making them manifest the word the word was the one that was sharper quicker than the two-edged sword it was the word that was dividing it was the word that was discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart because jesus christ was standing there the word and when they stumbled over the word it was discerning their hearts see you don't you don't necessarily have to have amen the gift of discernment in this day all you have to have is the true word and the word will do the discerning you preach the true word and its full power and the true word and its full power will begin to discern because as you preach the full word in this day it becomes a stumbling stone to some and a rock a foundation a sure stone a tried stone of precious stone to some that they can climb upon and be secure but for others it takes all the security away and they stumble and they fall and you don't necessarily need to have the gift of discernment to have spiritual discernment all you have to have is the true manifested word for your day and the true manifested word for your day will do the dividing amen will expose the thoughts and the intents of the heart amen let's go to john chapter 8. i love when the word says things in a way you didn't expect and it begins to shift your paradigm and change your thinking because when we were in the denominational churches you thought that that god when he sent down jesus and and he was looking down and saying i love this whole world so much that i'm going to put this baby here it's going to be such a wonderful thing but we know simeon has caught the mind of god and simeon is not using that kind of language he's not using that kind of dialogue amen simeon saying amen this child amen this this child shall be for the fall and rising again of many in israel that god through this manifested word is going to accomplish what he's had in the back part of his mind he's going to use this to separate he's going to use this to call his sheep and to himself he's going to use this to bring judgment to the world but he's going to bring life amen unto those that are his he's going to be a sign god when simeon catches the mind of god he knows now what god is thinking when god amen is sending this sign unto the earth a virgin shall conceive and bring forth the sign and she shall be emmanuel he shall be emanuel and you know the thoughts of god is thinking this is a sign that shall be spoken against that many of the hearts shall be exposed see this is why this things like this and all these things in the scriptures is why the nominal denominational teaching will never bring you to the realization of who god really is because it takes a man's perspective looking up to god and only displaying what what the man wants to display but with a revelation of the word takes us into the back part of god's mind and begins to show us god's plan from before the foundation of the world all the way to new heavens and due to earth and it begins to display the very character of god god is not judging man man is judging himself because jesus didn't come to the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved but those who believe not are condemned already he didn't have to send him to the world to condemn the world the world's already condemned he didn't send him for condemnation he sent him for salvation but refusing salvation keeps you in condemnation so god didn't send christ down thinking now i'm going to get him he says i have a way out amen for whoever will take the way out mine will take the way out and those that are not mine will stumble over this sign because you're already in condemnation but jesus provided a way out of condemnation not a way to be condemned but when they sent the sign that would free from condemnation they begin to stumble and fall over the sign instead of climbing up on it and saying i am saved so wonderfully wonderfully miraculously saved i'm saved from all sense past present and future climb upon the stone and realize that he didn't send him for condemnation but that the world through him might be saved but you've got to stand upon that stone and not stumble over it john chapter 8 verse 42 john chapter 8 verse 42 jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word year of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own free as a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth you believe me not so why didn't they believe him because he said the truth if he had lied they would believe him because they're of their father the liar so jesus is saying you're of your father the devil he was a liar from the beginning so if i had come and lied to you you would believe me but why don't you believe me because i told you the truth praise god almighty that's why you can tell tons of people the truth and they won't believe you but you tell them a lie they'll believe you amen you can preach the truth of this gospel and people will turn it down and stumble over it but if you make it some lie some amen jesus loves you just the way you are you don't have to change or do anything just repeat these line after me and come to church and pay your tithe and jesus will surely accept you you tell them that lie they'll believe it by the billions but you tell them the truth they won't believe the truth they'll stumble over the truth man it says all right because of verse 45 and because i tell you the truth you believe me not which of you convinces me of sin and if i say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of god then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that thou art a samaritan and ask the devil why because he told them the truth he told them exactly 100 the truth and they said didn't we say well you're a samaritan they didn't believe the virgin birth from the beginning they're pointing right to his birth and they're denying the sign they're speaking against the sign that a virgin shall conceive and now they're accusing him of being a samaritan pointing right to his birth now they're speaking against the sign which is what simeon said they would do and hast a devil jesus answered i have not a devil but i honor my father and you do dishonor me praise god i love it jesus knows where he's standing he knows what the truth is and he's offering the truth but he knows that that truth will be a stumbling stone to some and a sure foundation to others let's go to matthew 21. matthew 21 and verse 42 jesus saith unto them did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder jesus now bringing another another picture of this stone the stone that's a stumbling stone is also the foundation stone but that foundation stone is also the capstone the head of the corner and whoever falls upon this stone will be broken but whoever this stone falls upon will be ground in the powder and he's pointing right back to daniel chapter 2 to the stone that is cut out of the mountain without hands and that stone that is cut out of a mountain without hands amen is is a depiction of christ and in the end times he smites the image amen the image that nebuchadnezzar saw of the fur for gentile world powers he smites it in the feet and when he smites in in the feet it is broken up and it blows away as the chaff from the winter threshing floor so jesus is now showing that this cornerstone this stumbling stone is a foundation stone as a cornerstone has become the head of the corner and whoever can fall upon this amen they'll be broken amen that's a good thing you want to fall upon this stone this word and be broken so that he can put you back together amen but if you refuse to fall upon the stone to be broken the stone if the stone falls on you it destroys you but if you fall on the stone it'll make you amen glory you'll be undone so that you can be put back together and the message the identification of christ in all ages the prophet of god says you've told the truth you've had five and the one you're living with now is not yours he's out of john 4 the samaritan woman at the well look at that little woman see she had fallen from god's thoughts where did that little woman come from did she come from parents in samaria i mean she was called a samaritan but that's only this dimensional amen that's only a title that works for this dimension where did she come from she didn't come from samaria she didn't come from a mother and father who were samaritan she didn't come from sakkar or whatever city she was in she had fallen from the thoughts of god there was something down inside of her amen that was in god was in the thoughts of god and then fallen she had fallen from the thoughts of god and landed amen as a little baby given to two little parents in samaria and she had the label of being a sumerian but she wasn't a sumerian she was a daughter of god that's why we're not americans we're not americans we're not germans we're not africans we're not whatever nationality that you might be that's not who you are amen if you're a child of god you've fallen here from the thoughts of god amen and god is bringing his word to try to collect back all of his thoughts amen and with what for millions of people has been a stumbling stone called the message of the hour a prophetic gift that's been on the earth through a man named william branham who brought us back in contact with a living jesus christ for many it's a stumbling stone for you it's a sure foundation it's a precious stone and then it's a rock that you can base your whole life upon its foundation goes clear back to the mind of god where you tumbled from is where this rock came from and where this rock is rooted too amen for some they've stumbled over the message and stumbled over the prophet and stumbled over the signs but for those who have fallen from the thoughts of god amen he sent that very word to expose the thoughts of many's hearts oh sometimes it's not a bad thing to have the thought of your heart exposed sometimes it's even exposing it to you god is bringing this word to peel away layers that don't belong to you layers of hybridization layers of denominational thinking he's bringing the word what's he trying to do he's trying to expose what's in your heart so you can see what's in you we've lived so long in the intellectual realm being taught and being trained and coming through life and having circumstances and experiences and bible training but he sent a powerful word in this day to penetrate past the mind to get down into the heart amen so that he can see there's something there that fell from the thoughts of god [Music] and that seed will not stumble over that word but it becomes a sure foundation see if if this is you man you're just like peter was peter he didn't know who he was he was a fisherman peter was a fisherman the son of jonas that's all he was a jew of the tribe of whatever tribe he was a fisherman by the sea of galilee that was his whole identification all of his life until the sign that was spoken against came his way until the stumbling stone came across his path amen to see whether he would stumble or whether he would stand and when the stumbling stone came across his path he stood upon it he didn't stumble and he got a new identification because he thought that he was one thing when he realized then he was something else and on the day of pentecost the power came into him to quicken the seed to make him all that god intended for him to be and from then on he goes off preaching the word and now peter the fisherman from galilee is the spokesman on the day of pentecost he's the main preacher that's preaching in the new testament church when it first is formed now he's boldly proclaiming the truth the man who was running afraid afraid of a damsel on the night of the crucifixion or the night of the arrest but something he's now on a sure foundation amen he's now standing upon a rock amen he's been lifted up above the heads of his enemies now he's in psalms 27. he's been lifted up upon a rock all his enemies are around him is peter surrounded by enemies he's right in the middle of everybody who hates christ and hates the christian life he actually wasn't even christian in that day he didn't even have that term amen they were just the ones who were following jesus and they thought when they they thought when they crucified the stumbling stone they got it out of their way they didn't realize that that stelling stone came right back into a people and he was still a stumbling stone upon the earth living in peep a body on the earth and they were still stumbling over the stumbling stone they thought they could kick it away they thought they could put in the catapult and cast it away through crucifixion they didn't realize that thing boomeranged right around back and came right into a group of people [Music] and now the stumbling stone was still on earth and they were still stumbling over the stumbling stone and peter now peter who was afraid peter who's an illiterate fisherman all these identifications he has he and the day of pentecost he gets a new identity [Music] and now he's on a sure foundation and the pharisees are stumbling the tide has turned peter knows who he is he knows who the lord is he's got a revelation of who christ is he's got a revelation and a new birth experience telling him who he is and now he's unmovable now they they arrest him because he and john amen they pray over the lame man by the gate called beautiful and he goes leaping and jumping and praising god and they begin to preach they come to arrest them and they take him to jail and they begin to threaten them now they take the illiterate fisherman who doesn't know anything this poor guy amen who ran scared amen they now take him and bring him before the council to intimidate him and they found out that this man was standing upon a rock and that rock was going to become their stumbling stone they're facing the stumbling stone again in another package and they looked at him and they said we we command you not to teach or preach or pray or do anything in this name and peter standing on a rock listen there's the one stumbling now he's the one who's solid he says will you tell me is it better to serve god or serve man a or b when they realized they couldn't do anything with them they said they further threatened him and sent him away and what did he do after the further threat he ran right back to the house where they were praying for him and they began to rejoice and praise god that they were found worthy to suffer for his name's sake they weren't afraid of the suffering they weren't afraid of the persecution they weren't afraid of the trouble they weren't afraid of the rejection they weren't afraid because they were on a sure foundation something had changed and now the rest of jerusalem is stumbling over them because the word is in them back to this quote about the little woman in samaria she had fallen from god's thoughts that does something for me friends because where you came from is where you're going back to if brother brennaman came from ellen charles branham he could have been a nervous boy as he got to the end of his life he said great was the day when i realized i'm not the son of charles and alabama but i'm a son of god amen once you realize you're a son of god you've climbed upon a sure foundation not even death can separate you from his love not even death is a bad thing anymore it's just a release into the dimension you long to be in you're on a sure foundation she had fallen from god's thoughts she could be she could be redeemed why should could she be redeemed because she fell from his thoughts she could be redeemed she was a subject she had representation in heaven she had a theophany she had representation in heaven an angel that always beheld the father's face she didn't know it she was the woman who had too many husbands she was the woman who was rejected in her society she was the woman who had to go to the well at the wrong time at a different time of the day and because she had lived unclean she couldn't get her act together she couldn't get out of the cycle that she was in amen but inside of her we can tell by the dialogue was a desire to worship the true god and god knew where she was and there was something down inside of her she was going to have to come in contact with the sign that was spoken against so the sign that was spoken against could reveal her heart she could be redeemed she had representation in heaven i don't know about you but that makes me so happy friends it's not anything we've done it's not our power it's not our mind it's not you know in our strength but i i believe amen by the grace of god that he's given to me to have faith to believe it that i have fallen from the thoughts of god then i'm not the son of my earthly parents but i'm a son of god that's been put on this earth for a season to accomplish something he wants to accomplish and i believe i've come in contact with the sure stone the precious stone the foundation stone and i'm standing upon that stone and i believe that i've heard from my theophany why because when i heard this message i recognized it was eagle's food i left the others brother branham said if you've done that you heard from your theophany if you have heard this message and recognize that it's eagle food and you left all the others then you heard from your theophany if you heard from your theophany you've got representation already on the other side there's no chance that you'll miss it amen it's not your strength it's not your will it's not your intellect amen it's god's predestinated plan you have fallen from the thoughts of god now you're here and the stumbling stone is a foundation stone inside of you and others are coming in contact with you and they're either stumbling or finding a foundation she had representation in heaven she turned around look at the difference between her and them preachers her priest them preachers when they saw it they said well this man is a fortune teller they didn't know the word he was a sign spoken against look what she said well now sir you must be a prophet they said you're of beelzebub she said you're a prophet someone will look at the prophet of god in this generation well he's a false prophet he's a charlatan he said this but you look at it and said that's a prophet of god [Applause] how because you have representation in heaven you're hearing you're hearing from yourself something somewhere else is saying it's okay it's good amen you know sir you must be a prophet we haven't had one for hundreds of years and we know when the messiah cometh that's what he is going to do oh my she could teach birmingham something she could teach the rest of the world something yes sir she could teach those theological seminaries something same yesterday today and forever let her teach us something today let's go to zechariah chapter 4. zechariah chapter 4. and we're going to read from verse 6. zechariah 4 and 6 then he answered and speaking to me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by strength but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts how's anything going to be accomplished for the kingdom of god this is how it's going to be accomplished not by might nor by power not say not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you brother branham comes to the message of grace in 1961 and this is what he says about this portion of scripture he says there are we are all acquainted with this scripture that that reads the bible we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and zerubbabel was a great prince among the people who had laid the foundation of the building and the set the context we know that israel has been taken captive into babylon they've been held in babylon for generations but now is the time that was prophesied by jeremiah that they are going to come back amen they're going to come back into the land and when they come back into the land to rebuild jerusalem they're going to rebuild the temple again they're going to restore the worship of jehovah again amen and this is this is typed in the church ages where the church has been carried away to babylonian system to to that mystery babylon the great but there's going to come a time amen that's prophesied i will restore again saith the lord that there's going to be a return back to the original and a restoration back of the worship of god and so zerubbabel but here he is showing in type when they went got carried away babylon but now they're coming out of babylon and now they're going to build again amen and zerubbabel is going to lay the foundation but he's also going to bring forth the headstones with cryings of grace grace unto him and that's what brother bannon is referring to now as we read further we find out that god says zerubbabel has laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring forth the headstone i want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone he shall bring forth the headstone and we know that the scripture says that jesus is the chief cornerstone he's also the headstone now if we will think for a few minutes that's the seventh church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers who is he talking about now in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit who's he talking about now who's he typing cerubal with now not by power not by my but by my spirit saith the lord not by organization not by denomination but by the holy spirit god will bring forth the church in this last days zerubbabel the prince with joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone he had laid the foundation he took the people back to the foundation in type further down a couple paragraphs further he says but now according to the prophecy there will come the headstone and i want you to notice that when the headstone comes the prince that's going to cry out the message will cry out grace grace for it's by grace are we saved and not of works lest any men should boast so brother ben is now talking about amen zerubbabel who laid the foundation amen he's going to finish the work he's going to bring the headstone down the completion of it all and brother branham's saying this in time is the seventh angel is coming back to bring him back to the foundation bring him back to the foundation that paul laid bring him back to christ the chief cornerstone bring him back to the right dimensions of the church the right word the right layout the right pattern bring it all back amen and when he brings it all back the same one who brings it back is the same one who's going to call for the headstone and the headstone is going to be the capping stone to cap it all off and the message the future home brother van says is there a way brother branham he said yes become part of the word a part of the word of today can't be a part of the word of moses day that part is done made up that was defeat we're at the head now this is christ not the arm's time back in luther no this is the head time christ the headstone comes to the body this is the time amen through that prophetic ministry he restored us back to the original faith of the fathers brought us back to the right foundation brought us back to the correct cornerstone brought us back to the right teaching the right doctrine tying together all the loose ends and when he built it back now it was time to call for the headstone but the calling of the headstone would be grace grace not anything anybody did but what god has done amen it's his grace unto us and the message christ has revealed in his own word he said god was in the beginning and he kept coming down through the prophets and on down until god himself became human like us plumbed down at the foot of the ladder a baby born in a manger hated rejected despised a bad name and everything he was then he started rising seeing from the feet he began to build the church the bride coming back and on back and now coming out into the headstone brother branham now he's saying god was building all the way through that old testament until he finally came and the baby in the manger and from there he started building again up through the feet he was building the groom now he's building the bride and he's bringing the bride all the way up to the headstone where it all joins together and makes the one great transfigured body of jesus christ so zerubbabel who brought us back to the foundation is the rubal who brings the headstone the capping off in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed he says we have satan's answer god has vindicated himself god proves himself to his promise in this day hallelujah the headship is here is it coming no the headship is here amen he's done the work amen he's been here the son of man amen has come to do what to unite the the bride and the bridegroom the head and the body together to do what to reproduce the son of man again the headship is here the capstone has come amen that which was a sure foundation has become the capping stone that was the head of the corner has become the headstone see when you start off with the cornerstone the cornerstone we're looking at a pyramid because brother branham showed us this great city is the pyramid that cornerstone already has the angles for the entire pyramid the angle is in the stone the angles on the corner the right angle in the corner shows the stone shows the dimensions everything has to fit to this angle and you can build and build and build and build but you never know you've built right until the headstone comes and vindicated because if you've got the angle off the headstone will never fit if you were wrong in the word anywhere down here if the loose ends didn't tie together if the doctrines weren't laid out right if you didn't have it back zeroed into the cornerstone jesus christ by the time you got to the top it was going to be out of kilter somewhere and that headstone wouldn't lock in it would never come down and fit so the cornerstone amen is the one who starts it the alpha stone becomes the omega stone the beginning and the end the alpha stone is the one who lays the foundation and sets the pattern but the omega stone is the one who proves that this is it [Applause] [Music] you've got to build off the corner so brother branham brought us back to the sure foundation to the word of god jesus christ the word made flesh and he brought us back to the fullness of the word and brought us back to the gospel that paul preached when he laid out the pattern for the church he restored the stones that had fallen down he brought it back amen but he was powerless to do anything amen until he got everything in order and god decided i'm going to vindicate that this man was right i'm going to vindicate that this is my message that this is the truth and he came down himself as the headstone and when the headstone came down when you see that cloud from 1963 it's the brother banh said that cloud is the vindication that this message is the truth because the capstone vindicates the building that the angles are right the doctrines are right you've gone back to what paul said you've tied together the loose sins you've got the godhead right water baptism right marriage and divorce right you've got it right and when you see that headstone coming down amen it's the vindication that this message is the truth [Applause] amen it comes down to unite with you to vindicate that you're on the foundation and the ones are on the foundation the headstone becomes the vindication that you were built on the foundation what is a stone a revelation what is jesus christ the revelation of god and that revelation of the word became the cornerstone so what became the headstone the revelation of the word the revelation of the word the word made flesh and that day became the cornerstone what is the headstone the word made flesh in this day the bride is built up into the head she's coming to the headship vindicating that this message is right see when you see people doubt the cloud attack the cloud question the cloud listen don't forget what simeon said he's coming to be a sign that'll be spoken against to what to reveal the thoughts in many hearts so when god sends the sign that he promised the sign of the coming of the son of man amen the sign in the clouds when he brings that sign upon the earth amen when somebody begins to stumble over the stumbling stone amen you can say praise god you're stumbling over the stumbling stone a sign that is spoken against is a vindication to me that this message is right to you it's a stumbling stone to me it's the capping stone to you you stumble over it again to me it vindicates that what i believe is the truth it is my seal it is my it is my tying it together it is my vindication to you it's a question mark to me it answers all questions to you it's a further stumbling to me it ends all my stumbling about it is it's the high tower it's the strong tower it's the capping off it's the ceiling it's the securing it's the finishing it's the capping it all off and it's done it is done what else are you looking for he's here we've come into the headstone the headstone has come down under this ministry in this last day what else are we waiting for amen he's sealed it off he's vindicated it it's become a sign spoken against to reveal the hearts of many let it reveal the hearts of many let that sign spoken against reveal your heart don't try to stop people speaking against it because they have to don't try to stop people from stumbling over the stumbling stone they have to it's the same stone that was in the corner it's the same stone that's in the head if they stumbled at the cornerstone they stumble over the headstone if the world stumbles let them stumble but friends don't let that be your stumbling because you fell from the thoughts of god you can be redeemed you've got representation of heaven when you see that sign amen be be like the foolish shepherds who were uneducated they didn't know anything them shepherds didn't know they had no education they had no bible training they didn't know anything but one thing they knew is they could spot a sheep from a mile away when a lamb was born they knew what a lamb being born looked like so god why did it have to be shepherds because they're the only ones that would understand the birth of the lamb of god amen why did it have to be fishermen and tax collectors and harlots and prostitutes and all of these nobody why did it have to be them because everybody else was stumbling over the sign and speaking against it but there had to be a people on earth that weren't relying on their intellect but there was something deeper on the inside that had fallen from the thoughts of god when they come in contact with a sign spoken against they could say i don't have a problem with that i believe that's the truth their family speaks against it they're going to have pastors speak against it churches speak against it they can have people leave the message and speak against it but there's a sign spoken against to reveal the thoughts of the hearts of people so let the signs spoken against reveal what's in your heart what's in your heart i hope a sure foundation i hope a tried stone i hope a true stone i hope a precious stone is in your heart the revelation of jesus christ not just the revelation of christ 2000 years ago but the revelation of christ today the alpha the omega the corner and the head all united together to cap off this bride to show his glory on the earth in this end time brother ram says again in christ is the mystery of god revealed what is it not them people the headship in the body has become one the headship in the body has become one unit [Music] you can say i don't see that cloud anymore where's the sign see the cloud was a real sign it was the sign of his coming when brother man was told to take the picture and turn it to the right he saw the image of christ and he said that's our lord up there but god never sent the sign for us to put a picture on the wall and sit here by the sign and say i believe this sign this sign went somewhere just like the sign that was given to the there was a sign that was given to the shepherds and that sign was you'll find a babe wrapped in a swaddling cloth lying in a manger that sign was so that they could see that christ was here but 10 years later they can't go find the babe wrapped in swelling gloss lying in the manger that babe 12 years later was now disputing in the temple now what was there is there the sign was a true sign but the life and the sign is now the life there and the twelve-year-old and the temple confounding them with their wisdom and then what was in the manger amen is now standing by the sea of galilee breaking loaves of fish to feed 5 000 men and women and children amen the shepherds could go every year they could go back and light candles in the cave where he was and say this is where the sign was and they could miss where he's at [Applause] but the sign was to indicate he's come but when he's come you stay with him the sign of that cloud was to tell us the headship has returned to the body now where did the headship go the headship has been united with the body the head and the body are one unit now now the headship the headstone the capping stone is in the bride and he's here manifesting himself in the formation of the bride we can stay with the sign it's a sign spoken against let it be when jesus was standing there in john chapter 8 speaking to pharisees and the religious leaders and scribes amen he was that sign now he's in he's in an adult form and they're still speaking against the sign say did we not well say of you you're of samaritan you're a little legitimate birth still speaking against a sign listen friends there's still people speaking against the sign let them speak against the sign the reality of the signs here in my heart amen what that sign represented is here in my heart amen christ has come to unite himself with me to live in me and i'm trying every day to give him a greater preeminence trying every day to surrender my life in a greater way to him that he might have a greater manifestation now it's not whether you believe the sign or not now i'm i'm totally absorbed in trying to give him preeminence i'm totally absorbed in trying to give him first place because the headship is here but i'm trying every day to stay out of the way so that the headship can manifest himself now i'm not concerned whether you believe the sign or not you can believe the sign or not believe the sign but i'm trying to manifest the sign with all that's in me and not get in the way and not hinder his walk not take my own idea not get consumed in this world i'm trying to beat this body into subjection and bring it into subjection to the sign that's in me and that sign in this end time has become another stumbling stone these people the coming of the lord the lord is present in you what does that become another stumbling stone but it's not just a stumbling stone friends it's also a sure foundation it's also a precious stone it's a tried stone a true stone that we can rest upon the headship and the body has become one unit it's god manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer twain they're one god and his church is one christ in you god's great revelation what is god's great revelation christ and you as one i was trying to get great revelations the greatest revelation is christ in you as one as one person together the husband and the wife united as one that's the great revelation of god god's great revelation glory to god even bearing his name his name is jesus the anointing excuse me let's look at one more scripture luke chapter 18 and i would like to finish with this if the musicians would like to come forward and brother ben if you'll make your way up matthew matthew 20 i'm sorry luke 18. luke 18 and i'm going to begin reading in verse 8. i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth that was the question we're talking about the coming of the son of man when the son of man cometh will he find faith on the earth how many of you can speak affirmatively and say yes because he's put the faith in me it was a gift of faith it was a seed gene of god will he find faith on the earth he's not he's not talking about mental faith he's not looking about for somebody who will agree with him that will sympathize with him he's looking for somebody who has something on the inside that will believe when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and i can say yes because of grace grace god's wonderful grace if he wanted to find faith on the earth he was going to have to plant seeds of faith he couldn't have found faith on the earth unless he had planted seeds of faith and if he had planted seeds of faith then he was going to use a sign spoken against to reveal the heart to find where the faith was and the faith was in the heart of his children say oh i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them not by might not by power but by his spirit god has done a great work for me god has done a wonderful thing for me i could never amen i could never come up with the concept of hearing from my theophany amen it had to happen it had to be something that god did it had to be a voice that could penetrate down to the inside of me that would tell me that this is nothing but the truth amen there had to be something else besides me and man it couldn't have just been me a human being it had to be something with me more in me than just a human being because millions and billions of human beings have walked away and stumbled over the stumbling stone why for some this message is a stumbling stone but for me it's my sure foundation why does summit make them uncomfortable why does it make me so comfortable why for some does it seem so foreign and why for me is it so familiar why for others is it like something from another planet but for me it's a voice from home it's a familiar sound it's the original language i used to speak somewhere else at another time why is that it's not me it's something god has done amen and god has sent these signs he's done these works he's come into the earth and the way he's coming to the earth to be a sign spoken against that he might reveal what's in the heart and i say god reveal yourself in me find faith right here because you've planted it there i believe it with all my heart you've planted it there and i can only respond to you see when god is his voice is in the earth today because his voice is in the bride and god is calling out for something what's he calling out for many will stumble many will fall many will reject and he already knows that but what's he calling out for he's calling out for himself the word is calling to the word an eagle screaming to an eagle see it wasn't you that got a hold of god you never got a hold of god the god in you got a hold of god when god came along there was god on the inside god on the inside recognized god coming along and god got a hold of god word came to word eagle scream came the eagle scream amen it was god looking for god and god finding god and god holding on to god you haven't held on to anything it's the god in you that's held on to god if it wasn't for that there's nothing we can do just live as best in life as we can be as nice as we can do the best work we can for christian works and hope that it works out in the end but we've got something other than that a face seat on the inside that says that whatever he said it's the truth amen i've never heard it before but it's the truth what that prophet taught is the truth what this scripture says is the truth and i believe it and that sign was the sign of his coming [Music] god hunting up god looking for his children his attributes that are sowed into the earth when you reach out for god it's not these hands it's not this mind but it's something in the soul reaching back and getting ahold say i'm here lord i'm here father i hear your voice that's a familiar sound to me here i am lord god help me climb up on the precious stone on the shore foundation and help me lord to plant my feet on solid ground god bless you let's all stand friends and let's just pray you know when that headstone comes down jesus says the cornerstone has become the head of the corner of the headstone and whoever falls on it will be broken whoever it falls on will be ground in the powder because we know according to daniel's prophecy in daniel chapter 2 that stone cut out of the mountains of my hands will grind in the powder all the systems of man all the gentile systems of this world it'll grind it'll destroy so that stone is a destroying stone but that what is a destroying stone for one is a vindicating stone for another the one that that ends world gentile powers brings you into power with the king of kings and the lord of lords one brings judgment to you it saved you from judgment to one it brings condemnation to you it's freed you from condemnation to the one that brings destruction to you it brings life amen to one it ends the world system to you it brings you into your system amen which is the system of the son of god the son of david it just depends on which side you're on and i say god by grace you've put me on your side and i can never be more grateful more thankful i can never stop worshiping you worship can go on for eternity because of what god has done for us friends not what we've done for ourselves and that capstone has come down with shoutings of grace grace not just grace for salvation but now grace for a body change to go to the right condition we were always meant to be in the headstone has come down with shoutings of grace grace double grace oh let's just worship him let's just bow our heads and tell him how much we love him oh father we love you lord we thank you jesus for this day for your word lord which means so much to us god for when the realization of what you've done lord when we see the world trembling and the world shaking and the rejecters rejecting and speaking against your signs and speaking against your ministry speaking against your word god we're so thankful that we can say to them what's stumbling to me is a solid rock god it's by your grace god i pray if there's any amongst us that are still stumbling i pray god that you would turn the dial inside their heart that you would wake up that seed gene on the inside and they could realize this is not a stumbling stone but this is a foundation stone and this message isn't something to question or to flounder over to wonder about or ponder over or to speculate on but this message is a sure foundation a precious stone that we can set our feet upon and be grounded and the gates of hell cannot prevail against us god i pray that you'd help us to stay firmly planted on this rock this revelation of who you are a personal revelation to each individual what if there's an individual amongst us that that you have not revealed yourself to lord in this way i pray you go to them now for we can do nothing without you lord and i pray god that you would begin to penetrate deep into the heart and find that portion of the word laying there waiting to come to manifestation lord i pray that you would open every heart lord and reveal the thoughts that are deep in the heart that we might know were your children lord and where we came from and where it is you're taking us to and what our purpose is on this earth we love you lord we thank you father so thankful that we can say that by grace you're my foundation stoned by grace you're my capping stone by grace you've saved me by grace you've kept me low and sealed me and i can say lord of the full heart that i love you lord that your work is good and your word is perfect and it's beautiful and i love you for it lord i ask that you would bless your people in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless your friends amen my hope is built on nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness i dare not trust the sweetest frame but holy jesus name [Music] on christ the solid rock i stand hold on [Music] when darkness seems to hide his face i rest on his unchanging grace in every height [Music] on christ the son is [Music] [Music] [Music] the song broncos [Music] [Music] when he shall come with trump itself oh may i ever [Music] dressed in his
