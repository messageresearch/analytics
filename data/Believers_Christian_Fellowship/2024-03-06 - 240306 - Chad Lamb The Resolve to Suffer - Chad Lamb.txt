worship Lord with brothers and sisters Lord who come with the same desire just to bring honor and glory to your name to hear your word Lord and to reverence it to surrender to it God I pray Lord that you'd come on the scene according to your promise for you said whereever two or three are gathered Lord so we know that you're here because you've never lied you've never told us anything wrong but we're here gathered in Your Name Lord not our our name but your name not just for our purpose but for your purpose not just for our desire though we desire but we're here by your bidding by your drawing because of your desire may everything we say or do bring glory and honor to Your Name Lord God I pray that you would feed us Lord God there's nothing Lord that we can do in of ourselves but God if we can yield ourselves to you that you can do beyond our ability that's what we're depending on that by your spirit you would do beyond our ability that you would take Lord a vessel of clay and you would use it to speak Eternal words of life that those words will go in deep inside of our hearts and change us Lord and that word would be a seed that' be planted in good ground and it would bring forth a Bountiful Harvest For Your Glory may it be so in our lives we ask in Jesus Christ's name speak tonight Lord we pray take the preeminence as we surrender it to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated for just a moment thank you musicians God bless you amen I just want to say we had a wonderful wedding here last night and so thankful for all who could attend we had many visitors some have had to leave but some have remained sister irena's brother and his wife and daughter here God bless you it's good to have you with us I was glad they were able to stay over many have already had to travel back but uh I just want to thank everybody who helped make it such a nice wedding such a memorable wedding and we really are thankful for brother Riley and Sister Abigail Sanders that's what we can say now that that's her name now she's had a name change by marriage amen and so we we thank God when she signed the marriage certificate I saw her sign bomb Gardner for the very last time she'll ever signed bomb Gardner so may God bless them as they're away and bless them in their travels uh also wanted to say thank you all for praying for us as we were gone last weekend celebrating my wife's parents 50th wedding anniversary we had a nice time we had good travels there and and all of the family was gathered together for the first time in a long long time so that everybody made it so it was nice so we appreciate that so I wasn't here to formally welcome our visitors from UK so brother Simon had to do it himself but God bless you brother Simon it's good to have you and your family here so nice to have you back once again we really appreciate brother Simon stepping in and taking the service for us and we were able to stream while we were driving up from West Virginia and we got to stream the entire service and loved every minute of it I thought it was a wonderful word from the Lord and it was exciting to hear and we were in the van saying amen that's good praise the Lord and then he was doing stuff on the Whiteboard I never knew you could do and then they were watching behind they were streaming they had the the phone behind me so I couldn't see what he was doing I was driving and he goes I'll Zoom this in here I said you can zoom the Whiteboard I said did he just zoom that so I told Brother Simon yesterday he's going to have to give me instructions of training session on how to use the Whiteboard that I've been using for more than a year so God bless you brother Simon We Appreciate You yielding to the Lord it was a wonderful word and we certainly enjoyed it amen uh also want to remind you tomorrow night will be the church age book Bible study here in the fellowship hall it'll be the last one we'll be having for a month because we'll be traveling uh my daughters and I will be traveling to Australia to minister so uh we just want to remind you of that let's let's all stand together and let's turn in our Bibles to the Book of Romans Romans chapter 8 and then Romans chapter 8 and I'd like to read just two verses verse 17 and verse 8 18 Romans 8 verse 17 and if children then heirs HS of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US man God bless you as you have your seats I want to take from this from this text uh a thought that I'd like to share with you and for a title we can take the resolve to suffer and the resolve to suffer and we've we've preached around on this subject many times you can't preach the Christian Life without preaching suffering or trials or tribulations and so we've touched on this many times but there's a certain aspect that I would like to just highlight and that's the resolve to suffer uh we find so many times that what really troubles Us in trials and tribulations what really I I believe causes us so much distress and turmoil is all of our efforts to avoid trials and we spend an exhaust and exert so much energy and so me much mental strain and our avoidance of what will come what will come anyways instead of just being resolved to suffer so I believe that we could spare ourselves so much mental strain and tribulation and trouble if we would just be resolved that this is a principle in the Christian Life and we're just going to be resolved to him let's go to 2 Timothy chap 2 second Timothy Chapter 2 and I'm going to read from uh verse 10 2 Timothy CH 2:10 therefore I under all things for the elect's sake that they may also obtain the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us so if we suffer we shall reign and what he said before in Romans is that uh that we're joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together so there's no option on suffering suffering is just part of the package uh let's turn to Philippians now Philippians chap 4 Philippians CH 4 and verse 10 in Philippians chap 4:1 it reads but I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at the last your care of me has flourished again wherein you were also careful but you lacked opportunity he's talking about meeting a financial need that he has now he says not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in whatsoever State I am therewith to be content I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I'm instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me that's the key phrase I can do all things through Christ which strengthen to me he knew how to do with much and he knew how to do with little how to abound and how to abase amen he was thanking them for meeting the financial need but not that he had want because he knew that in whatever state he was in there and to be content he had learned that Amen to to suffer with whatever God had allow and that with with God uh he can do all things through Christ with strengthened him let's turn to 2 Corinthians now because we're picking this all up from the Apostle Paul and let's read 2 Corinthians chapter 12 2 Corinthians chap 12 and verse 7 he says and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations that were given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me or there I'm sorry there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted a measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am I strong I marveled when he says this because we know the Apostle Paul did not want or desire this Affliction whatever the thorn was in his flesh wasn't something he was pleased with took pleasure and or wanted because he sought the Lord's Thrice to take it away so Paul's desire was not to have whatever this Affliction was he didn't want it it came upon him without him asking for it it was given to him it was a a messenger of Satan to Buffet him permitted by God he didn't want it he didn't want it to remain he was asking God for it to be removed and he asked three times and finally the word of the Lord came to him and said my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness and when he got that answer I want you to watch his attitude because what we're talking about tonight is an attitude amen we we're going to talk about suffering but it's not about suffering everybody suffers everybody that's been born of a woman suffers everybody that's taken breath in and out in this world suffers to one degree or another suffering is not suffering is not just uh only reserved for Christians suffering is reserved for Humanity but what I want to talk about is our attitude when he found out that God had permitted this and wasn't intended to remove it and said my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness he says most gladly therefore will most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities what a statement amen that's not what he was saying before he got the word of the Lord he was asking for it to be removed he wasn't taking pleasure in infirmities but once he realized this is the will of God for my strength is made perfect in your weakness he says now I will take pleasure in infirmities that the and infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am I strong amen praise God so I love the attitude and that's what I want us to key in on because this is what separates Christians from the rest of the world Amen in uniting time and signs brother Bram says speaking of tension I was praying about it this morning what would you do if you didn't have tension and we know brother Bram was plagued with this tension this nervousness this tension he had from a small boy and it troubled him all the time everybody knew he had this tension his mother knew it and and but he he he was praying about it the morning he was preaching this sermon said what would you do if you didn't have tension just think of it tension is a part of living that kind of encouraged me when I thought that if you had no tension you'd be like a ragd doll you wouldn't have no feelings there'd be nothing you could work on a little further down he says and just think of feelings what if you didn't have any feelings no pains or Nothing what if there' be no pain at all you'd have no feelings at all just think just think for a minute of how much of human existence and how much human effort is directed towards the avoidance of pain how much money how much time how much effort do we spend trying to avoid pain I don't know I don't know if we could put a monetary value on it or we can give an allotment of time but I've spent a great deal of my time trying to avoid pain trying to bypass it trying to not suffer amen but brother B said what if you didn't have any pain you'd have no feelings at all and if you had no feeling then one of your senses would be gone see so everything's just right anyhow God just give us Grace to stand up to it that's the thing if I just stand up with that Grace and stand there and say we know that when this life is over the great ones on the other side where we're looking to go to and now we remember that all these things that's attention some people tries to introduce produce Christianity that you're free from worry no you're not you're free from tension oh no you add tension when you become a Christian because you was kind of happy go-lucky whatever it was out there not caring what you did but when you've become a real Christian every moment you're wondering am I pleasing my Lord if I could hear from him it puts you on tension puts you on guard that's what makes you what you are so after all tension is a blessing amen those of you who Ser suffer with nervous tension yeah it's a blessing prise God Amen and it's caused I I'm sure it's caused a lot of trouble nervousness and tension causes trouble causes distress causes anguish but the prophet of God saying it's a blessing believe it it's just the way you're looking at it it's just the way you're looking at it see if you just look the other side no matter how thin you slice anything you still got two sides to it see so you want to see both sides tension what what's this tension if I could have been born without this tension well if I wouldn't have had this tension I wouldn't have been what I am I wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps it was this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ see so it's been a blessing thing to meise see what I said about attitude he says it's just the way you look at it every situation in life has two sides to it and it just depends on the way we look at the situation and all of us are going to face situations we have faced we probably are facing we will be facing situation situation that causes anxiety situations that cause tension situations that cause pain or suffering and everything comes down to the way we view that situation is going to determine the way we behave towards that situation he goes on in this quote to say so then as Paul said as though when he had t ention or something or another he had consulted the Lord to take it away from him three times and the Lord said uh to my Paul he said my grace is sufficient he said then I'll glory in my infirmities then when I am weak I am strong as long as it's the will of God all right now I consulted him one time when it used to bother me so bad it scared me and he told me about 8 or 10 years ago he said it'll never scare you again and it never has did it no sir don't worry about it I just feel it but I know it's there but I just go on because it it don't scare me no more so thankful for that now this is what he says next now he could have said it won't be no more just as well as that it won't scare you no more amen he was praying about it because it used he you know used to scare him you say what would scare you about this nervous tension well maybe it was scare him that he was losing control maybe it was fear F that he didn't know how bad it would get he he had to leave the field he left the ministry one time because of a nervous breakdown maybe he was fearful that he didn't know how far this tension would go and how bad it would get and it used to scare him and he sought the Lord and the Lord one time said it won't scare you no more he could have just as easily taking the tension away if he took the fear away he could take the tension away but somehow the tension served God's purpose amen so he took the fear away not the tension and then the next thing he said so it's his will that it happened so I just embrace it amen amen and say thank you Lord I'll walk that way H I'm going to say that again because it does something to me so it's his will that it happened so I'll just embrace it and say thank you Lord I'll walk that way the one thing that we we always try to do in life is get rid of our trials not embrace them but sometimes the only thing to do is embrace them because it's the will of God I want to look at Mark 14 together let's look at Mark 14 and let's go to verse 32 Mark 14 and: 32 and they came to a place which was called Gethsemane and he said to the disciples sit ye here while I shall pray and he taketh with him Peter and James and John and began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy and saith unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death Terry you hear and watch and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him and he said Abba Father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what I will but what thou Willl here Jesus comes to the hour the hour of his great trial the hour of his suffering the hour of his persecution and when he comes his soul was exceedingly sorrowful unto death he was great Agony and sorely amazed and Jesus wasn't looking forward to the trial in his flesh he didn't want it I hope you can understand what I'm saying he didn't want it he wanted to bypass it so as a human being as the man he wanted to go around this obstacle and he said father if there's any way that this can pass me but then he says but not my will but thine so he continually surrenders we know he does this three times but he surrenders to the will of God but what he would like to do is bypass this hour he would like to bypass this trial he is a man brother B said he was 100% man 100% God now when you figure it out ma mathematically when you can solve that equation come and talk to me but it's nonetheless absolutely true he was 100% man he was 100% godone And as a man he wanted to bypass he was already suffering uffing with the the mental anguish the emotional anguish of what was laying ahead of him was causing him to be sorely amazed and be in anguish and severe anguish so this wasn't this wasn't an easy thing this wasn't an easy trial and he and he and he sought the father that if it were possible and and he starts off by saying father all things are possible to you have you ever prayed that have you ever been in the mid middle of a trial and said God you could so easily God this is nothing for you you could so easily amen you remove Devils by the Finger of God I mean you could so easily get me out of this situation you could rescue me the whole situation could change tomorrow have you ever prayed that way well you're praying just like Jesus prayed Abba he says Abba Father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me that's what he says take away this God you can do anything take this away from me nevertheless not what I will but thou Wilt amen and he cometh and he findeth them sleeping and saith unto Peter Simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour watch ye and pray lest you enter in Temptation the spirit is truly ready but the flesh is weak and again he went away and prayed and spake the same words and when he returned he found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy neither wish they what to answer him and he cometh the third time and saith unto them them sleep on now something had changed after the third time there was a resolve I could say there was a resolve in him to suffer he had sought the Lord he had asked if it was possible to be bypassed he had gotten the word from the Lord three times he had asked the father if he could bypass this trial and three times there was no no yes answer and each time he was willing to surrender to the will of God and each time the answer never changed and finally he comes back and he says sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour has come behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise up let us go Lo he that betrayeth me is at hand there's something about that statement that amazes me just before he he's in great sore amazement and great anguish and sorrow and he's seeking the almighty God the Father who can take away every circumstance and change everything and asking him to remove this cup from him but then surrendering his will to the father's will and even in another gospel he comes and he talks to his disciples and he he he expresses disappointment he says what could you not watch with me one hour don't you know what I'm going through don't you know what's happening can you not just bear with me couldn't you just be a friend to me could you not watch with me one hour how many times do you get in a trial and for you it's the greatest trial of your life but for your friends it's not a big deal yes they don't understand the anguish they don't understand the the tension they don't understand what you're going through and you feel all alone and all forsaken you're asking God to change the situation and it doesn't look like the Situation's going to change amen and he was went from sorely amazed and in great anguish and disappointed in his friends for not watching with him one hour and he goes through all of these emotions and then he finally comes to a resolve and when he comes to the resolve to me it's beautiful yes sleep on now and take your rest before he says why couldn't you walk why are you asleep what are you doing sleeping why can't you watch with me I need you to pray with me and now he says it's okay take your rest it's all settled I know the will of God sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour has come behold the son of man is betrayed under the hand he he listen there there is no doubt in his mind what's getting ready to happen he understands the situation this is isn't ignorance Blissful ignorance that he's moving into not knowing he knows exactly where this is going he knows where this is going to lead he knows exactly what's taking place but he's got such a resolve and such a peace and such a stability because now he's stepping into the will of father he has surrendered his will he said the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise up let us go Lo he that betrayeth me is at hand one of the things I love about this is when Jesus comes to this resolve from anguish and sorrow to disappointment and friends and calling out to God to resolve now this resolve carries him right through the the worst trial the most difficult set of circumstances a human being can go through he is betrayed he is he is he is rejected and he is forsaken then he is uh uh mocked he is scored he is falsely accused he is beaten he is uh uh nailed to a cross and he's left to die like the trial this isn't like losing your job this isn't like your spouse you know saying something cruel and mean to you and hurting your this is we're at a whole new level here but the resolve carries him through the trial and the way he conducts himself as he moves forward with the resolve to suffer to me is is Paramount it it to me it's our goal this is what we're striving for amen it's not that we don't have emotion Jesus it wasn't that he didn't have emotion he wasn't sterile he was 100% man amen he felt amen he suffered he had anguish he had sorrow amen he he did not want to suffer he did not want to go through the trial he did not want to feel the pain he did not want to separate one from his friends he knew all the feelings that we feel yes but yet when he knew the will of God and he resolved himself to do the will of God he was able to walk into suffering amen and as a lamb SI silent before the Sligh before before the slaughter and a sheep silent before the shears he was able to go dumb because he had already resolved he didn't have to defend himself he didn't have to I mean he didn't say anything mean to Judas what would we have said if we knew what Judas has done and he come all he said was Judas betray us the son of man with a kiss when he stood uh when he stood in the the trial and and the whole trial was was was a total sham right he didn't defend himself he didn't try to get out of it he didn't he just stood and let him say what they were going to say he didn't defend himself cuz he knew the will of God and even when when pilate says know you not that I have the power he says you have no powerless it's given to you from heaven from above he knew what was going on that God was in charg but the resolve to suffer amen brought out such a beautiful character amen that he didn't have to panic he didn't have to be afraid he didn't have to defend himself he didn't have to become angry or bitter or any of the things that happened to us when we get into a situation that's not near as intense as this why cuz he was resolved to suffer the prophet of God tells us in the church age book in the saman church age he reads Hebrews 5 and8 5 uh chapter 5: 8 and9 says though were he he were a son he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering did you did you get the impact of what brother bam just said the character of Jesus was perfected by suffering I didn't know that his character needed perfecting praise God but he said the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and if his character was perfected by suffering how is our character going to be perfected the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measuring of suffering and they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection he goes on to say unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character satanic but Power with characters fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is sat down on his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary sufferings we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes all what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation amen then he quotes from Peter he says think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are all tried and chasen his sons not one but goes through that he says is it strange that God wants to develop Christlike character why are these things happening to us is it strange that he wants to if if Jesus Christ's character was perfected by suffering is it strange that we would have trials and tribul ations we shouldn't think it strange but the the re the reality is we always think it strange we always think it's somehow unfitting unfair undeserved and that may not be you you may have risen to a higher level of maturity but God's still working on me because every time I go to why God is this happening and why why am I suffering and why do you let this happen and why didn't you prevent this and you could have stopped this and why is that going on and why is this going on why why why why why on brother and then really I find for me I find so many times that when when it comes to the trials and tribulations of life and listen I don't mean just trials and tribulations because we're being persecuted for the gospel sake amen there's a whole lot of other trials and tribulations that are shaping Us in life amen but the trials and tribulations of life I find that so many times I cause myself way way more mental stress and strain than the actual trial would cause me by trying to fight the very fact that it's happening and resist it and try to find a mechanism with which I can avoid it and trying to find my own way out and trying to dodge the bullet as it was to say Amen it reminds me of when I was in school you know when I was in school I'd get assigned a research paper you got a five-page research paper that is the trial of my life and I would do anything but sit down and write that paper I would think I've got to go to the library first so I'll wait till I go to the library go to the library I got to get books well I got the books I know nobody goes to the library anymore but that's what we used to have to do oh I'll read this book and I'll read that book okay well I I'll start writing but I got to write an outline first well I I and you just kick the can down the road and you find some excuse and you don't do it and you delay it and there you are the night before and you got to write a five page uh research paper amen and so if you finally just sit down and you just start writing you know what always happens by the time you actually sit down to write it and get done it really wasn't that bad it really wasn't a big deal I caused myself weeks of stress weeks of strain weeks of mental anguish dreading writing this paper dreading all the things I going to the hours of Anguish and finding another way and the fact is when I sat down to write it you just start flowing and it works and one thought builds to another and before you know you're done writing the paper and if I would have wrote it the day it was assigned I would have had it done way ahead of time I would have passed through that trial I wouldn't have complained I wouldn't have become bitter I wouldn't have accused the teacher of being mean and rude and a hateful teacher and not liking the students wishing I was in Mrs so and so's class you know how much mental I mean this is a childish example but this example matches everything in life take it to work take it to family bring it into the church amen we cause ourselves all the trouble cuz we're not just resolved to pass through a [Applause] trial and then before you know what God doesn't like you because you're in Mr so- and so's class and not Mrs so- and so's class and it never works out for me and it always works out for other people and before you know it you've got God off the throne and forgot where you're at and he's not in control anymore everybody around you now is in control the problem is when we don't just resolve ourselves to suffer and move the way God wants us to move then all of a sudden we bring God off of the throne we put him down here and now Pilot's the one in control of this yeah right now it's everybody else around me right it's Mr this teacher in this school in the Ohio state for requiring a curriculum that be so foolish and I remember I missed recess for a whole week cuz I couldn't finish my multiplication tables oh the burden that sometimes we suffer through I had to get my one to one through 10 multiplication tables memorized and filled out and I didn't get it done in time and listen it wasn't because I wasn't capable it wasn't because I couldn't do it it wasn't because I couldn't memorize it wasn't because I didn't understand the concept it was because I just didn't want to do it cuz it was going to take a little bit of mental strain it was going to take a little bit of application applying myself and I was going to actually have to not play until 10:00 at night I was actually going to have to sit down and like like like memorize it and I didn't want to cuz I didn't like it right and then all the kids go out the recess and then I can see him running by we had a lower floor and the window was up high and I could see feet moving by and all of a sudden the disdain for my teacher and my hatred for math in general the problem is when we take that in later in life we start to attach that to people yeah yes that's right this person who hurt me my dad my mom that brother my boss who gave you your mother and your father who gave you your job who forsaw your trials who knows what character he's molding and who knows what he's trying to draw out of the seed that's inside of you question is is God still on the Throne is everybody else in control does God still know and ordain the footsteps of the righteous or or is it just a halfhazard random life and everybody else can do me wrong any time and and throw throw the course off and mess up God's plan and ruin everything we can't have it both ways it's either one or the other and so you can see how not resolving to suffer all of a sudden it creates in US extra anguish extra turmoil listen if I would have took the assignment and studied my multiplication tables I was more than capable of memorizing them in short order I could have filled it out when all the other kids fill it out and I could have went to recess when everybody else went to recess and I wouldn't have had to struggle with bitterness I wouldn't have had to fight off self-pity you know the reason I use multiplication tables and because if I start using real examples that we all face with on a daily basis some of you are going to get offended at me so I've got to use multiplication tables and research papers because this hits way too close to home because it because my it becomes my husband it becomes my wife it becomes the minister it becomes the Sunday school teacher it becomes my coworker it becomes my boss that's right true and instead of saying God you let this trial pass me but if not thy will be done and just give me the grace to stand up to it remember brother Ram talked about when the slave buyer was going down the South and he was looking for slaves and he come across this one and and he saw a young man in the field and that young man he he held his head high he kind of had an air of dignity about him he went all of his work and he never had to be persu persuaded he never had to be beat he never he he just did it and he started asking about him and and and the owner began to sing his accolades and you know never have to whip him never have to do anything and and he wanted to buy him he said he's not for sale and he began to ask what what is it that makes him so different do you treat him different no he treats the same eat different no he at eats the same and he found out that in his homeland his father was the was the king of a tribe and though he's away from home he conducts himself as the son of a king brother man brought that lesson he told it so many times it's such a simple lesson but the reality should be true for us every day amen why should I bring myself down to gravel to complain to become bitter and disappointed in life when my father is the king and actually my father sent me on this journey because he wants me to rule and reign with him one day and so he wants me to gain some character so that he can bring me back to the throne and be a joint air with him amen the whole thing is serving a purpose a great purpose and and it all has to do with me being exalted on high and placed on the throne with the character fit the rule nothing bad is happening to me that's why the message of the hour and the end time is so beautiful that it absolutely it peels back amen all the confusion of our life it takes the seals off our life so we can see where we came from why we're here where we're going and what the purpose is in our life so that we can begin to conduct ourselves as children of the king we we eat what everybody else in the world eats we sleep where everybody else in the world sleeps we get treated like everybody else in the world gets treated but we should conduct ourselves completely different than everybody else we are sold into the slavery of hybridization like every other slave that's on this planet but we should conduct ourselves differently let's go to Genesis 37 together Genesis 37 and verse 26 Genesis 37 and verse 26 we're going to look at the life of Joseph just with a few scriptures Genesis 37-26 and Judas said unto his Brethren what prophit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood Come and Let Us sell him to the Israelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his Brethren were content so here they're going to take their little brother who they hate because he's spiritual he's done nothing wrong he's done nothing wrong to them he's done nothing wrong but because they're jealous and they have envy and they hate him they're going to take him and they're going to sell him into slavery now I've never been treated like this but I can tell you if I had there would be a lot of things going on in my emotional realm I've never been betrayed the way Jesus have been betrayed but if I had there would be a lot of things going on in my emotional Realm would set up a struggle it would set up a struggle that was beyond the slavery because being sold into slavery has one struggle but being in torment and turmoil in your mind is something completely different Genesis 39 verse 1 Genesis 39 And1 and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and pfer an officer of pharaoh captain of the Guard an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmaelites which had brought him down thither and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand and it came to pass from that time that he made him Overseer in his house and over all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field and he left all that he had in Joseph's hand and he knew not ought he had save the bread which he did eat and Joseph was a goodly person and well favored there's something that I draw out of this when I look at this in context of what we're talking about Joseph having done nothing wrong he's hated and betrayed by his Brethren he's despised for no good reason because he he is what what God made him he sold into slavery when he sold into slavery he goes down and and while he's down there he's he's bought by potier now he's Piper's property and we we know all of this but something is unusual here because he must conduct himself in an unusual way because potterer sees something in Joseph that's special I don't think Joseph was angry contemptuous and bitter I don't think pfer would have made him ruler over his house right I don't think he was sour and contrary I don't think he was depressed and downgraded to the point of not speaking no doubt he was upset no doubt he had all all the emotions that we would go through but there was something different about Joseph and that Joseph in this situation he was able to project another kind of life and the life he kind of tried to project caused Piper to take note of him and Piper took him and began to give him Authority and began to give him uh uh different different rulership over different things until finally Joseph ruled everything that was in his house and he didn't even know what he had coming or going only the what he sat down to eat he knew he had that everything else was in Joseph's hands amen I'm I'm just believe with alight there's no way Joseph could have got there sour and bitter and nasty and angry and blaming everybody else for his problems no way no way he could operate at that level amen he was operating at a totally different level so that situation is bad enough because he's taken from his father he's taken from his family he's taken from the land that he's promised amen now he's in slavery but the situation goes from bad to worse so 3919 and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife why because Piper's wife tried to have Joseph for her herself and he fled and it came to pass when his master heard the words of the wife which she spoke unto him saying after this manner did the servant to me that his wrath was kindled and Joseph's Master took him and put him into prison a place where the king's prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison my verse 21 but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of The Keeper of the prison and The Keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there was the doer of it the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper so when the trial gets worse it wasn't like Joseph could endure for so long but now there's no way I can take this Lord you've given me too much this trial has gone beyond my ability this is this is over the top this is not right there's no way and and no there must must have been something that carried Joseph through cuz when he got down to prison of all the prisoners that were there amen some I mean we know that there were some there that were the Butler and the Baker and one was justly in prisoned one was unjustly impr prisoned so who who knows what situations he found but no doubt what kind of attitudes and temperaments and sourness and oh I don't you you can only imagine what was in that prison but there was something about Joseph that made made him different to The Keeper of the prison than any of the other prisoners and and it wasn't his sour attitude it wasn't his hatefulness it wasn't his disrespect for the guard like he didn't feel Justified and and being short-tempered and short fused with the guard because he was unjustly treated we justify so much horrible conduct we self justify so many things that should never come out of our mouth we justify it because of hurt because I'm offended they hurt me they they shouldn't have treated me this way I shouldn't be in this prison I shouldn't be treated this way and we we'd start to justify our short fuse our our bad temperament our nasty attitudes there's no justification for it no matter what happens so something was different about Joseph and and that brought him to the attention of the guard and the and the keeper of the prison gave him Authority until all of the sudden amen Joseph listen Joseph wasn't an angry contentious bitter human being or he would not have been given charge of the entire prison and you know we look back and read the Bible and we see everything is so perfect it's perfect it's the perfect plan of God everything worked out perfect but while they were living it it didn't look so perfect I would assure you that Joseph wasn't thinking ah yes this is perfect I'm going down to Egypt because I got to go to Egypt to save my brethren I mean years from now there's going to be a famine and years from now they're going to need me to be at the right hand of pharaoh and I I can see it perfect how many trials have we been through when God upset our world and totally totally rocked our world and changed everything and we were so disappointed and so discouraged and then years later you look back and say that was absolutely perfect God God knew exactly what he was doing I lost that job and I loved that job and I wanted that job and they let it go but now years later you can look back and say that was the hand of God but you didn't know it the day you lost your job you didn't know it when you were going through the trial you can only look back and see it and God was working a plan all the time in your life and he knew you would hit disappointment you would hit discouragement amen but as a Son of God you've got to stand up and say God I trust you in every decision you make and if this is not of you I trust that you'll change this situation so now Joseph is is now in prison and and then there's two men a butler and a baker and they they have dreams and he interprets the dream and the interpretation comes to pass and he tells the one when you're restored don't forget me buddy like please say a good word to he said I'll never forget you you're my bud and you you you you gave me the interpretation of Dream It's coming to pass and as soon as he got out of prison he forgot Joseph question is how would you feel would you go that Butler Baker I don't remember which one it was after all I did for him and I was good to him and he forgot about me come [Music] on now if you never had that thought you'd come to Perfection already and you probably die and go to heaven cuz you don't need any more time on Earth those things roll around in our head but we need the spirit of God Amen to correct that Human Side sometimes we just need to remind ourselves who's in control that God never fell off his throne and bumped his head and got amnesia he's in absolute control he's still seated at the head of everything and he hasn't forgot me and he hasn't forgot where I'm at and he and he's not unmindful of what I'm going through amen sometimes we just need to rehearse these things to ourselves to keep us in the right frame of mind mind so Joseph now is forgotten and he's still in prison God knew that this man in order to fulfill the vision had to know how to rule and Reign so he started training them in Piper's house you know what he would have picked up in Piper's house potier was an Egyptian the Bible's careful to tell us he was an Egyptian and he was at a captain in the guard do you know what he would have picked up in poyer's house Egyptian culture Egyptian customers Customs Egyptian politics cuz he was in the house of a high-ranking official he would have figured out quickly how things work in Egypt you know what he would have picked up in prison All the gossip from the king's Palace because the the prison he went to was the one where they keep all the king's prisoners so he would have picked up all the political undercurrents oh yeah that was the best training he could have ever had to ascend to the right hand of pharaoh he had seen it on both sides he had heard it from both sides and in both places he was given responsib ability as a ruler to rule and Reign and guide and be in control of people and God was absolutely working an absolute beautiful plan it was probably more perfect than we could imagin he probably overheard things in that cell and that prison that saved him trouble when he got to the throne I don't know I but can you imagine so God's plan was absolutely perfect amen and God's going to work his plan in us he's going to have a perfect plan and he's going to work it in our lives and he's doing the same things with us today you have to believe that he's doing the same things with us today he's bringing us in an ordained plan he's bringing us an ordained way because he has a goal in mind he has an objective in mind and he's trying to bring us into Christlike character so why so that we can rule and reign with him and in so doing he's got to put us in places and in situations where we have to learn how to handle situations and we have to hear things and experience things and see things that we didn't want to hear and we didn't want to experience and we didn't want to see because we would if we planned Our Lives my life would be so cream puffed cake eating sweet as honey every day of my life I would never learn anything if I got to pick I'm glad he doesn't let me pick cuz I mean I'd still be a little baby on the floor kicking and screaming every time he didn't answer my prayer immediately I'd be throwing a 2-year-old temper tantrum so God In His abundant goodness and Grace he's got an objective in mind and everything's moving to that objective and faith in that is what gives us the right attitude in the midst of Trials listen we can't get bitter because it's better for them than it is for me you can't get bitter because somebody else's situation it looks like God blessed them and he didn't bless me God's got something else for them than he has for you you didn't make a mistake you know what happens when we get bitter about that now we never go around saying I'm bitter because I'm envious we would we don't say that we're Christians we know better but that's actually what happens so we don't that doesn't come out of our mouth and we don't even let that float around in our mind we cover that up with some other excuse I mean we play mental gymnastics with ourselves all the time but but what happens when we do that and we begin to compare our life with somebody else and we feel feel mistreated or left out or somehow forgotten or really the accusation is against God when it gets really down to the nitty-gritty our accusation is really against God because God's in control and we may think we're directing it towards somebody who's harmed us and somebody who's hurt us and but really what we're doing is saying God you've not done a very good job of taking care of me because I'm hurt and I'm wounded and I'm negatively affected and now I'm justified in my bitterness and I'm justified in my nasty attitude and I'm Justified at being angry with everybody and always in a fight instead of just being honest and saying God I'm destroyed but I need your help I don't understand why these things have happened in my life I don't understand why everything seems to work out for others but it never works out for me but one thing I know is before the foundation of the world I was a thought in your mind and you know what you're doing and forgive me for my attitude Come and Let Your Grace be sufficient for me sometimes we got to get down and be honest and not just keep pretending we're okay when we're not okay we need to say God I'm not okay I'm I'm bitter I'm angry I I have self-pity amen I feel sorry for myself and Lord what I need you to do is come down and give me the faith to recognize that every step I take you're aware of you know about it there's a definite purpose in my life and you're going to bring me to an expected End Amen you have thoughts for me of good and not of evil right right these are the scriptures that concern the elect of God we need to rehearse these when bad things happen to us amen we believe it when good things happen but we have to rehearse it when the bad things happen when sickness comes When Trials come when we lose loved ones we didn't expect to lose what are we going to do these are these are the things of life that are there to mold us and put character into us they're to equip us to rule and Reign amen when people walk away from the message we never thought would leave people for forsake us that you never thought would forsake us we evily spoken of we're accused of things we haven't done when we do wrong things and have wrong result all of these things we have to come back to the reality God you know the way that I take and when I am tried I shall come forth as gold why because that was his plan all along nothing has changed his plan let's turn to Acts 14 together I want to read through a couple scriptures and look at something here in the in the word before we leave Acts 14:21 says and when they had preached the gospel to that City and had taught many they returned again to lisan to ionium and to Antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God so how do we enter into the kingdom of God through much tribulation so that should be our expectation this word tribulation is a Greek word and I won't even try to pronounce it but the definition that gives at the bottom is a pressing pressing together pressure oppression Affliction tribulation distress or Straits so what how must we enter into the kingdom of God through pressure through oppression Affliction tribulation distress Straits what is it the whole world caving in on you yeah amen things going wrong pressures coming troubles and trials and this is how we enter into the kingdom I want to look at uh uh just a couple more places here let's go to Romans chapter 5 we'll turn quickly to a couple scriptures Romans chapter 5 verse 1 5 and one therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith and the grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us this word tribulation is the same one we just went through in the previous verse oppressed anguish tribulation and by tribulation we glory in Tribulation because tribulation worketh patience let's go to James chapter 1 quickly James chapter 1 verse two my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing I hope we can see by the scriptures that trials and tribulations and pressures and squeezes they're just a part of life amen there's no way to avoid them in fact the constant attempt to avoid them and then the mental distress and the the the the the anger and the frustration we have by not avoiding them is actually causing us more trouble than the trial itself sometimes what we need to do is just put our head down like a mule and plow we'll be done with it before we can quit fussing right it'll be over with and we'll be on the other side of the trial amen and we won't get on the other side of the trial with all of the regrets and all of the repentance and all of the having to make things right for what we said and did to our family members and those that were around us we won't have to go make things right with our co-workers and we won't have to if we would just sometimes just put our head down and just plow and say God you know what's best and when I am tried I shall come forth as gold you know what's right you know what's wrong you know what's being said right you know what's being said wrong you know what's being done right you know what's being done wrong and I trust you who's the righteous judge of all Heaven and Earth to judge righteously for my case right now right now and if you see fit to allow this to happen to me then this is the direction that I want to take Amen on Amen sometimes we become our own Advocate and we forget we have an advocate in the message the world is falling apart brother B says we want everything just everything so we can take it easy and retire and take life easy if that's ever been a true statement that's a true statement for me you and I you know what I want to do I want to become a professional fisherman but not one that actually has to catch fish to keep his profession like I just want to go try and get paid this is what he says everything we want everything so we can take it easy and retire and take life easy said life wasn't intended to be easy life is a struggle amen anything that's got life is a struggle look at the trees how they struggle look at everything that's got life it's a struggle and we we try to get some kind of system that takes it easy then we're wrong and we know that there's something wrong you know we paint the American dream you work hard for 30 years you save for retirement and blah blah blah then you retire you golf every day and the sun's always shining and nothing in your house breaks because you're not working now so everything's fine you know what it's a carrot on a stick you work all your life work work work safe safe safe safe safe safe and and say you do get enough amount of money that you don't have to go to work anymore that won't give you good health amen that also won't give you a good solid family that also won't end any of your troubles right it's the carrot on the stick when there's going to be struggles and suffers all along before retirement during retirement postretirement when you have to go back to work cuz it wasn't like what you thought it was you're going to have struggles all along yes right you get enough money that money is not a struggle you have struggles with your health if you don't have struggles with your health you have struggles with your family you don't have struggles with your family you have struggles at church there's going to be a struggle might as well resolve ourselves to struggle well to do a good job in the struggle to be like Joseph amen and not like Cain Cain killed his brother amen Cain did unrighteous and he killed his brother and when God came to to correct him on it he started fussing about the correction and feeling sorry for himself and having self-pity and got angry and contentious with almighty God when he was God was being so merciful to let him survive and then to put a mark upon him that nobody would kill him and he he he's contentious and he's angry and he's bitter and he's lying to God I don't want to be like Cain I want to be like Joseph I want to be like Jesus job said in job 14:1 he said man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble guess what your retirement plan is not going to change that no amen nothing's going to change that amen that's life you know what'll change that new heavens and new [Music] earth and we're destined for that so praise God let's go to John 16 together John 16 and let's go to vers verse 33 John 16:33 these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation listen if Jesus said it it's a promise just the same promises I'll be with you until the end of the world Amen so you can Bank on it in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer cheer I have overcome the world hallelujah amen now now this word tribulation is the same one that we've been looking at in the previous two verses oppressing oppress oppression Affliction tribulation distress Straits now let's go to Matthew 7 and we're going to see the word again only it's translated differently but I want to see in its application here Matthew chapter 7 verse 13 we're going to read verse 13 and 14 of Matthew chap chap 7 enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many there be which go there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth unto life and few there be that find it it says straight is the gate and narrow is the way that word straight just means narrow so when I looked up straight and it said narrow I said well why would it say narrow is the gate and narrow is the way well this word narrow most every other time in the Bible is translated tribulation and in the previous three verses we read when Jesus said in this life you shall have tribulation this is the this isn't the same word this is the root of that word or the verb of that word with it comes from the same word and here's what it means narrow to press as grapes press hard upon to compress to be contracted metaphorically to trouble to afflict to distress so straight is the gate and narrow this kind of narrow is the way which leadth them life and few there be that find it God why are there few that find it because there's so many that don't want to go the way of press Affliction they don't want to be squeezed like the grapes they don't want to be pressed hard upon they don't want to they don't want to be contracted they don't want the metaphorical meaning of to trouble to afflict or to distress so they try to take the wide way to bypass this way but this is the way to life you enter into the kingdom through much tribulation straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth into life and few that be there be that find it why because there's very few that says Lord is this the way I have to walk Amen to get to you then that's the way I'm going to walk that's the way I want to walk there's very few that have a resolve to suffer and in the Old Testament in the Book of Daniel when we know the story of the fiery furnace and the three Hebrew children but I love what they said they they they were they were nice to the king they said oh King live live forever we can't we can't do what you say and our God is more than able to deliver us and he will deliver us out of your hand but even if he doesn't Will Not Bow you know what they had a resolve to suffer they were willing to go through the fiery furnace to stay with the word but they weren't getting bitter angry they weren't spitting a insults towards the king they weren't saying you wait till God gets you for what you're doing no none of that they conducted themselves as sons of the king amen amen we know know that God delivered them in the church age book brother benam makes this statement and he he says there is a gold of God it goes from 1 Peter 1:7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perisheth said the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of Affliction that is the right kind of gold but what kind of gold does the church have today it has but the worldly gold that will perish it is Rich it is complacent it has made affluence and the the major Criterion of spirituality the evidence of God's blessing and the correctness of Doctrine is now based upon how many Rich folks are involved in it you'd had better come before it's too late sayith the Lord and buy of me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly Rich are we getting it listen to me naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it oh no we are going to take something with us what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less nothing more so we had better better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before God so then what will we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of ter character will you take with you will it be will it be his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of Affliction or will it be the softness of this characterless leoan people it is up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden what kind of character do you want to take the character list leoan that's what we're immersed in yes no one wants to suffer no one thinks they should suffer right amen politicians stay in their position by removing everyone's suffering until no one suffer and now when no one's suffering everybody's suffering because nobody wants to suffer and the message I know brother says why does God let troubles come God harnesses trouble many of you I've told this for years you know this I've quoted this from this Pulpit many many times this is probably my favorite quote in all the message why does God let troubles come God harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God Amen how many times have we prayed for a closer walk with God he said there had been no rainbow until the flood came but after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in a storm the little Ark pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of Promise after he' went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the Promise after you've gone through the tribulation I've liked that PO po or Psalm must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas this is the part that's my favorite we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our Comforts is just beyond the river why are we going through the troubles to have the character when we get beyond the river our comfort is just beyond the river I think we need to stop expecting Paradise here and start looking for Paradise there America's falling apart I mean it's been falling apart brother R told us it was falling apart and it's it's it's rapidly falling apart right before our eyes there is no security in finances there's no security in government there's no security anywhere there's only Security in Christ it's going I mean what happens if we lose it all tomorrow well if we lose everything tomorrow I've lost nothing because we've been placing Treasures in Heaven where neither moth do corrupt or rust do corrupt amen our Treasures our Comforts are just beyond the river and nothing can be lost there and if I've got to pass through a little difficult time here to get there then then so be it God's got a purpose in it and I need to gain some more character am amen I want to I want to well I want to read two more verses if I can read two more as we close let's go to Hebrews 13 Hebrews 13 I'm going to read this and then one more scripture Hebrews 13:12 Hebrews chapter 13 verse2 wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach that means willing to suffer for his name bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come there's nothing here for us if we lose it all we have no continuing City let's go over to First Peter just a few books over to the right First Peter chapter 5 verse 10 1 Peter 5 and 10 but the God of all Grace who have called us into his eternal glory by by Jesus Christ after that you have suffered a while make you perfect established strengthened settle you when after You' suffered a while I want to be I want to be perfect established strengthened settled you'll get there after you suffered a while cuz that's the plan I say God help us I believe we're in the age of adoption you know Jesus went to Gethsemane after adoption after Mount Transfiguration that right so even in the age of adoption we have to learn to resolve ourselves to suffer to give in the will of God to keep the right attitude the right approach the right Focus there's a certain maturity that the bride has got to come to and we cannot be throwing temper tantrums when we hit trials there there's going to be a people on this Earth that's going to reflect his character amen and it's not that they're not going to have distress because after adoption he came into anguish of spirit he come into sore he was sorely distressed he prayed in anguish until he SW it as it were great drops of blood it wasn't that he didn't have anxiety and he didn't have pressure and he didn't feel the pressure and he didn't have great distress he had all of that but what he did with it and the way he reacted to it is showing what an adopted son of godone acts like it's not that we don't come to the end of our wits it's not that we don't come to a trial that's beyond our ability it's not that we don't we don't ask God to remove the situation and change it for us it's not that we don't have great anguish and severe sorrow and are so perplexed and so Disturbed and so distressed that we have no idea what to do we we've hit that many times we hit it many more times but what we need to do is exactly what Jesus did and said God let this cup pass please rescue me from this situation but if not thy will be done not my will be done and give me the grace to stand up to it Lord let me act like your son in the midst of this trial yes amen I so want to be able to reflect that life in my life uh God is going to have a victory on this Earth amen he absolutely is going and and brother brandham said his life in her is his victory amen the resurrected life in the bride is the purpose for his death and it's his victory amen so he is going to have victory ictory on this Earth amen and where is he going to have Victory he's going to have it in his bride and how is he going to have it she's going to reflect his life I say God you can start right here I need an extra dose of your help I need an extra dose of your grace that is sufficient for me I need that same sufficient Grace that was sufficient to carry Paul I need that same sufficient Grace sufficient enough to carry me cuz I'm failing In My Own Strength but I can never fail in your strength for when I'm weak your strength is made perfect in my weakness sometimes we just need to be resolved to go through the trial yes stop fussing stop complaining stop blaming stop conniving stop manipulating and just start walking I think for us I think if we're able to take that attitude and approach I think we'll be surprised at how quickly we come through a trial and I think we might be surprised how it was so much easier than we thought why because with that attitude and with that resolve it's not you walking through the trial it's his grace that's sufficient for you it's not like you get to the end of the trial and say that was easy now you get to the tri you say thank you God you carried me through and it was so much better than I expected it was so much different than what I anticipated I had dread and I had anguish but when I surrendered Your Grace was sufficient and your strength was made perfect in my weakness and I come through the trial and and I L Lord help us I want to come to the place where I quit causing myself extra trouble in my trouble yes I have caused myself so much stress so much depression so much anger and frustration and so much regrets why because of me it wasn't the trial it was me it was my reaction to the trial it was my attitude towards the trial it was the things I said and the things I did and that I caused myself more trouble than the trial was actually going to cause me true amen you know what I want the next time he hands me a multiplication table I just want to start working on it instead of looking around the room and seeing if everybody else is mad like I'm mad see if anybody else agrees with me that this is unfair how much energy do we exert wasting time instead of just getting down to business yes praise God say God help me next time you give me a 10-page research paper I just want to start writing down the outline page one not fight it not resist it not blame anybody not get bitter or angry but God make your grace sufficient for me and in my weakness would your strength be made perfect I'm moving forward Lord would you help me I think you'll find with that attitude you'll never pass through a trial alone amen there'll be somebody with you let's all stand musicians if you'll come and brother Blake if you'll please come I don't know when I'll finally grow up spiritually but I know if I'm on if I'm here at the time of the body change he'll see to it that I am I don't know when it will happen and I don't know what it'll look like but I know one thing I'm not what I was and what what what is it that has changed all of us from what we are what we were to we are now it's the word of God but you know what's made that word real our trials and tribulations you know what's made the word so relevant and so real and so pertinent is because of the things that we went through the word of God has changed us and our trials have shaped us and I say thank you God and if that's what it took to get here I wonder what it will take to finish the job probably retirement I don't think so I don't think take more of the same maybe a lot more of the same maybe a degree which we haven't faced yet but praise God he will have his victory on this Earth and he will have it in human flesh and he will have it in a fallen redeemed human in flesh that is called his bride and it'll be the many membered bride of Jesus Christ and she will stand the trial she will go like Jesus did silent to the slaughter praise God not defending herself not manipulating not blaming not ridiculing but just silently walking for with confidence that my father knows the way that I take and when I am tried I shall come forth as golden praise God God bless you all let's bow our heads together and pray dear Lord Jesus I thank you Father for God we need you Lord now more than ever God we're realizing more and more Lord how childish and foolish we've been and God we realize that if it wasn't for you Lord we would have never made it one step not one step towards your kingdom could we have made on our own not one thing could we accomplish Lord without your spirit if it wasn't for your predestinated plan for your WR and wooing for the word that you've given in this hour to mold us and shape us we would have never made it this far God I pray that you would give us a determination Lord to give you first place and preeminence in every way God you surely know the way that we take you've had thoughts of us from before the foundation of the world thoughts of good and not of evil to bring us to an expected end you've had a desire that you want to accomplish in our lives and Lord you given us a revelation of your of your great plan help us God to surrender in a greater way than we've ever surrendered help us to give up our lives more than we've ever given them up before help me God help me to surrender help me to yield to your tender hand you're the Potter I'm the clay when you apply pressure lord it's because you're trying to bring another characteristic another trait out of this lump of clay you've got something in mind and help me not to resist that your hand to resist the pressure but help me Lord just to yield to you and allow you to have your way in my life God I pray for myself and for everyone that hears the sound of my voice Lord that you would give us the grace that's sufficient for our trials that your strength would may be perfect in our weaknesses that we would Glory then Lord in the thing that you're accomplishing when we're not able you are when we can't you can when we're lost you know the way when we're blind you can see see help us Lord to just put our hand in yours and trust you as you lead us through for Lord You're the Good Shepherd and though I go through the valley of the shadow of death I'll not fear for thou art with me you're the Shepherd that leadth us all along the way you go before us and bid us come even through trials even if we walk through the valley of the shadow of death you're with us help us not to fear help us not to lose our faith Lord help us not to lose our understanding but God all that you've given to us may it strengthen us and equip us for the things that we face next and may we do so Lord by bringing glory and honor to your name may you be magnified may your strength be made perfect may you get all the glory in all of it we pray pray would you bless us and that you would help us that You' forgive us for where we failed that you would strengthen us with your might in the Inner Man help us to live the life you've always ordained for us to live God I want to live like Joseph sold in slavery to the slavery of hybridization in this world he never asked to be sold he was just sold we never asked to be sold but we've been sold into slavery by Adam help us not be bitter angry help us Lord to just shine as a light wherever you place us to surrender to your great plan for your plan is perfect may we live a life like Joseph may we live a life like you displayed Lord when you walk this Earth God I pray you have your way in me bring us Lord to a greater maturity than what we have now we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen for [Music]
