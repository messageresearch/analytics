[0:00] but i've never had an experience that
[0:01] i've been filled with the holy ghost
[0:03] that i can put my foot on
[0:05] all right notice this brother man's
[0:08] gonna
[0:08] he's gonna fix this all right notice
[0:11] this
[0:12] ordinarily a human being is born in sin
[0:14] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[0:16] speaking lies
[0:17] that's the nature of human being sister
[0:19] bruce says yes
[0:21] that was your nature it changed once
[0:24] but what changed it she says christ
[0:27] there you are sister
[0:28] that's it
[0:33] what's complicated about that amen the
[0:35] holy ghost is for you receive it amen
[0:38] say god i receive it you promised me
[0:40] that gift i've done
[0:41] everything you asked me to do amen you
[0:43] provided the faith to believe your word
[0:45] you're the one who pricked me in the
[0:46] heart
[0:47] and i cried out what should i do you
[0:49] said repent i've repented lord
[0:51] you said be baptized in your name i've
[0:52] been baptized in your name and you told
[0:54] me i
[0:55] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[0:57] and i'm here lord
[0:58] receiving your gift
[1:00] [Music]
[1:03] because that's what the word says amen
[1:06] and when that gift comes to you it will
[1:08] change you
[1:10] your soul will change amen it's not just
[1:12] saying well i accept it i believe it
[1:14] those are words words don't mean
[1:15] anything but there has to be an
[1:17] experience amen
[1:18] brother branham was clear on that you
[1:20] have to have the experience of the new
[1:21] birth
[1:22] i mean we don't go back to preaching a
[1:24] baptist doctrine of you you receive the
[1:26] holy ghost when you believe
[1:27] brother branham was dead set against
[1:29] that because there's a lot of
[1:30] intellectual faith saying i believe
[1:32] now saying that i've got the holy ghost
[1:34] because i believe
[1:36] but he said you've got to have an
[1:38] experience there must be an experience
[1:40] of the baptism the holy ghost but he
[1:42] never attached it to
[1:43] any fleshly emotional evidence or
[1:45] sensation
[1:46] he said what is the experience brother
[1:49] brennan makes it clear
[1:50] the experience is a changed life
[1:53] that is the experience that you went
[1:55] through the experience of i was one way
[1:57] and now i'm
[1:57] different and i didn't change myself it
[2:00] wasn't alcoholics anonymous it wasn't a
[2:02] self-help book amen
[2:04] it wasn't willpower it wasn't turning a
[2:06] new leaf at the new year
[2:07] none of that worked amen but there was a
[2:09] supernatural power
[2:10] that changed me from the inside what is
[2:14] that
[2:14] amen that's the experience amen of the
[2:17] baptism of the holy ghost of the new
[2:19] birth
[2:21] and that's what brother bam said you
[2:22] have to have
[2:24] it can't just be a mental
[2:25] acknowledgement and a verbal declaration
[2:27] but you have to have that experience
[2:30] you have to change your desires have to
[2:33] change your thinking has to change your
[2:34] loves have to change
