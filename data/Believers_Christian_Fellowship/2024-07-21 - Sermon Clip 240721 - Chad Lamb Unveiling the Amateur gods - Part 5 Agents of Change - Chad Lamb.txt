TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it says now verse 21 but after a long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said s you should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from CRE and to have gained this harm and loss and now I exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee wherefore sir be of good cheer for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me Hallelujah he never required they believe God but he said you be of good cheer because I believe God and I believe because of faith faith will bring this to pass and because I believe God they'll be no loss of life only of the ship don't worry I believe amen praise God it says now listen that the angel of the Lord said Don't Fear because they have to go to Caesar the Apostle Paul already knew he was going to stand before Caesar God had already told him when he was arrested early on in his arrest that he had to go to appear before Caesar so he was on this journey to go to Pier before Caesar the Apostle Paul believed the word of God he knew the prophecy was true if he was going to go see Caesar he was going to go see Caesar regardless of what happened to the ship but he was away in a long abstinence the Bible says he was hidden away where was he I'll tell you what I believe amen this is me I believe he was praying a prayer of intercession for everybody else on that boat because look at the answer he got don't be of any fear for surely you're going to go to see Caesar but I have given you all the souls that are on this ship who did he give them to he gave them to an agent that was on the earth standing in the Gap a Son of God that was going to go to Caesar anyways he had no doubt he was going to go to Caesar so what's he need he he's saying God what about all these Souls on this boat what about all of these lives and he says I've given them to [Music] [Applause] youall Lord what would have happened to that ship if Paul wasn't on that ship what would happened to those lives if Paul hadn't interceded for those lives and what would happen to all the people around us if there's not an agent on earth right in their midst and you're workplace and in your family amen they may not be seen they may never be able to receive the message but my can you bring healing to their life amen can you bring comfort and peace to them can they be preserved in time of sickness all of these people on this boat most of them were prisoners I doubt all of them were SE Gene of God Amen but their life was saved from that shipwreck because there was somebody standing in the gap for them 200 and something Souls amen
