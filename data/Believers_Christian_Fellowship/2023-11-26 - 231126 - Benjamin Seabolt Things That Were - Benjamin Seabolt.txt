that I found out he could bring me out show me the way he showed me the way praise the Lord you happy to be free this morning there's a lot of people that are bound but we can stand here by his grace free brother Randon would term this age as many things he would call it a bright age he would call it an astronaut age he would call it different things but my one of my favorite terms that he used to describe this age he says this is a free age this is a free age and just because there's bondage all across the face of the Earth there's darkness and gross Darkness over the face of the Earth you that doesn't mean that you have to be in bondage so just because there's darkness and gross Darkness doesn't mean that there's not the option of light just because there's bondage doesn't mean there's not the option of being free we've been given a word to free ourselves not just from denominations and vices but we think about this we've been given a word that is so powerful in this last closing moments of time we've been given a word that is so powerful it can literally free you from your own self it can literally free you from your own thoughts from your own genetic makeup from your own complexes it's one thing to be set free from another man's idea from a vice or from something like that but a word that can actually come in and free you from yourself there is none more powerful praise the lord it's good to be with you this morning let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer before we'd approach the word precious Lord Jesus we're so thankful to be here Lord and in this season of Thanksgiving we just want to come and bow ourselves before you thanking you father that you have poured out your grace and your mercy upon us and Lord not only have you sent us a profit father to expound upon your ways and upon your words but you have actually came came in the form of a prophet Lord the the revealed word you yourself to pass by our way Lord and to lead us and to guide us and to draw us into all truth Lord that we would not have to be bound by any man's idea even our own idea or even our past Traditions father but Lord you have seen fit to come by our way and free us from all things except for yourself so Lord as we would come to this portion of the service we would just ask that you would come now Lord that you would come and that you would be the speaker here this morning Lord for you know I have nothing to offer this people Lord we would ask that you would come and that you would be the hearer father and that you would just take your word and do that which you have divinely orchestrated this service for we commit ourselves to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen let's turn in our Bibles to John 13 please and this is where we will begin John Chapter 13 thank you musicians and I would just like to take a subject this morning brother Brandon preached a message uh things that are to be and we're all familiar with that we've actually preached on that quite extensively the last several Services um but I would like to change that a little bit in the morning I would like to take a topic of things that were so we'll obviously see that those are directly linked together but for the sake of a title and a subject that's what I would like to look at things that were and let's begin here in John 13 beginning in verse 1 it says now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them until the end and supper being ended the devil having put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and garded himself and let's turn over to Matthew 17 now read a portion of scripture there Matthew [Music] 17 verse 10 and it says and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto the them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias is already come and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them and then if we can turn to Revelation chap 10 very familiar portion of scripture for our last reading here Revelation chapter 10 in verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets God bless you as you would have your seats so looking here in John 13 says before the Feast of the Passover and there's a couple uh descriptions that are given in this portion of of scripture before the pie before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew his hour was come that he should depart out of the world unto the father so this is the time frame or this is the position that Jesus is now operating in he has come to a proper understanding that now is the time this juncture and time this is the time predetermined that I am to leave this world and I am to go unto my father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having put now Into the Heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God so if you're following this pattern through the scriptures there is a junction there is a portion of time that Jesus comes to an understanding that now is the time that I am to depart from this world and go unto the father and there is a revelation that is directly linked to this juncture in time and this Revelation is contained in ch in verse three Jesus knowing the father had given all things unto his hands and that he was come from God and that he went to God so if we ever see this time period come again that there is a people on the face of the Earth who are coming to a recognition that now is the time that I am to depart out of this world and I am to go unto my father I would venture to say that this Revelation contained in chap in verse three is going to be very Paramount on their M on their mind mind because you're not going to depart out of this world and go unto the father if you do not have a proper understanding that the father has given all things into his hands and that I am come from God and that I'm going to God you're not going to go back to the father if you don't have a recognition that you came from the father so this Revelation I I find it astounding that this Revelation is mentioned here in this chapter because we know that Jesus uh brother brandom said he was 100% God and he was 100% man and he went to the Garden of the CMI and he sweated it out there and he made his decision there and he came to the conclusion brother Brandon says he went to Calvary with one scripture that he would not allow his holy one to see corruption but we know that through the the time line of events that immediately after this is stated in chapter 3 or I'm sorry in verse three immediately after that Jesus turns to Judas and he says what thou doest do quickly Jesus turning to Judas and saying what thou doest do quickly hinged solely on the Revelation contained in verse three he could not not have the courage and the ability to turn to Judas and say what thou doest do quick he knew what that was nobody else knew the disciples didn't even know but he knew when he turned and he loosed that demon to do what it was going to do he knew what the result of that was going to be he knew the suffering and the death that was going to come with that but this Revelation that was in him was so powerful and it was so overcoming that he could turn to the very one that was going to cost him his life knowing that he was operating in the plan of God and tell him what thou doest go do it quickly because I know where I come from and I know where I'm going and I recognize the hour that I'm in and it is now my time to depart from this world and go back to my father you are simply going to be the tool that is used to fulfill that plan this was not something that that Judas or Satan was overpowering Christ he had to have permission to do this this was a tool that he was going to use to further the plan of God but this was not an easy task this was not him telling him you know what thou doest do quickly and I'm going to have a bed of roses and Float off to the father there was great torture there was great suffering there was great sacrifice and pain that was going to come from this but there was an overcoming Revelation that Jesus had in the face of all of that to look that directly in the face and say I know where I come from and I know where I'm going and what thou doest do quickly and there's a people here on the face of this Earth in the in the closing moments of time that are going to face intense pressure on every hand and we Face intense pressure just in our daily lives but even we know there's a politically backed persecution and a religious persecution coming against the true bride but we can stand in the face of all of that just like Jesus stood and declare I know where I come from and I know where I'm going and furthermore I recognize that if you all are gathering yourselves together it's simply a fulfillment of scripture and it's an indication that the time is at hand that I must depart this world and go to my father I know where I come from and I know where I'm going and what you all are going to do do it do it quickly do it quickly looking here in Matthew it says in his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and this is very key here what is Elias to do when he comes Elias truly shall first come and restore all things this is a very broad term but let's compare this to John 13 what all things were Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and that he went to God so the disciples are approaching Jesus and saying this is happening this is happening and this is happening but what about why are the scribes saying that Elias must first come he responds that's true Elias shall Truly Come and restore all things what is what what is this all things that Elias is to restore it is the proper understanding of our relationship to the father there were a lot of doctrines that brother brandom would come and that he would St restore there were a lot of lucans that he would come and that he would restore but and this is just my opinion you don't have to take it um but but to me that wasn't the purpose that wasn't the only purpose purpose there was a reason behind restoring the doctrines and the teachings and that was so that we could know where we stand and that we can have an understanding that this this man is not just pulling these things out of thin air he's not just making these things up this matches the scripture this matches the scripture this teaching that he has this is matching the scripture this is loose end that he's tying up this this matches in the Bible this matches the scripture and now we can start having faith in this ministry that is being presented to us but the point of that Ministry in my opinion was not to restore just the doctrines but it was to restore an understanding that I came from the father and that I'm going to the father and that I know who I am that I can now have the ability as Jesus did to know all things and knowing all things is not an ex an exhaustive list of all the topics in the Bible but I would term it as in what's most important what's most important what are these all things because you can have a proper understanding of a lot of the doctrines and still not have confidence in who you are and what good will it do you even Jesus would come and say I do nothing except for the father shows me so does he know all things that's another topic within itself we won't get into that but I just say that to make a point this is not an exhaustive list of having all the answ aners to all the questions this is knowing the main question this is having the answer to the main thing and brother Brandon would even go so far when he would conclude uh the church age book he would write this down and he says if I have one goal for my entire Ministry I have one goal for my entire Ministry and that is to put back a spiritual relationship between God and man he didn't say my goal was so that you would have all the answers to all the questions to all the doctrines to all the teaching he didn't even have that he would say that there was things that he didn't know there was things about the Millennium he didn't understand and the new heavens and new earth that he didn't understand there were things that he readily amended I don't understand this I don't have a proper understanding of this but the one thing that he knew for sure and that he could declare is that he wasn't the son of Charles anell Brenham anymore he says I thank God for that day for that Revelation that I recognized that knowing all things because I would just say this if we truly truly understand I'm not talking intellectually but I'm talking if we truly understand that I came from God and I am going back to God you tell me what else matters it's not that nothing else matters I'll say it this way what else matters as much as that right what's going to Trump that what's going to be more important than that what is going to be so powerful that it can overcome that nothing now that doesn't mean we're not going to have good days and we're going to have bad days because we we understand we live in a fallen condition but I'm talking at the end of the day when the rubber meets the road sir or when you're on your deathbed when things are getting real what's going to overcome that it's so powerful that Jesus could turn and loose all the devils in hell that were wanting to kill him for years he could turn and speak to them and say what thou doest do quickly even all the devils in Hell could not overcome that Revelation or could not Shake him he knew where he come from and he knew where he was going and brother uh and Jesus refer ing brother brandham the Elijah for our day he would make that comment of him that when he comes on the scene this this Revelation is going to be lost this knowledge of all things it's going to be lost but when he comes back on the scene his empasis is going to be restoring that Revelation to you so I to me like I said that's the important part of it is we can get so tangled up in the doctrines and the teachings and maybe miss the point of the the message uh the point of the message is to identify you the reason that he brought the teachings of the doctrines is you could be drawn to that so you could have faith in that Revelation 10:7 it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound we know this is the same Ministry that Jesus referred to of Elijah the mystery of God should be finished not Mysteries the mystery of God should be finished well if you're a part of God and he's bringing a proper understanding to to you of where you came from and where you're going that finishes the mystery you remember brother Brandon would come and he would say the thing that I wondered about all my life not the things that I wondered about all my my life the thing that I wondered about all my life says I don't wonder about that anymore the mystery should be finished why is that so important because there's nothing else going to Trump that mystery when you have that Revelation so with that in mind I would like to just look at a few scriptures here and I just pray that you would relax this morning I don't have an agenda I don't have a doctrine that I'm trying to force on anybody to be quite Frank with you it's just the Thanksgiving season and I've got a bunch of quotes here that I'm thankful for and half of them I don't even really understand but it I know it's true and I'm thankful for them so maybe I should have just titled this can I share some quotes with you um and you make out of them whatever you want to make out of them but I uh we was talking about this with brother Chad several weeks ago and I asked him the question I said how is it that something that I really have no clue about Thrills my heart so much because I can't take this this and tie it all together and present it in a PowerPoint of this this this and you you get it there's things that brother brandom says here that I I don't even understand but I know it's true and it rings true in my soul and it Thrills me to no end so I want to approach this not as you know this is the way it is and this is the way it's got to be um but I just want to approach this by you know what do you what do you think about this um how does this make you feel uh because there's comments that he makes here that are so astounding and overwhelming and even intellectually you can't wrap your mind around it but it does my soul good because I know it's true but I want to read this scripture before we would jump into these quotes I want to read this scripture in Ecclesiastes uh chapter 1 and verse 5 Ecclesiastes 1 and 5 it says The Sun Also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to his place where he arose the wind goeth towards the South and turneth about unto the north it whth about continually and the wind returneth again according to its circuits all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place from which the rivers come tither they return again all things are full of Labor man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun is there anything whereof it may be said see this is new it hath been already of old time which was before us so the the context of that is the sun comes up and the Sun goes back to where it came from the wind bloweth and it goes back to where it come from the waters move about and it goes back to where it come from and then he brings it into the person and he says the things the thing that hath been that which shall be it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun there is no new thing Under the Sun so let me ask you this is your positional placing in Christ Under the Sun now you you're living on this Earth You are literally Under the Sun and the scripture says there is no new thing under the Sun so if your position in Christ is now being manifested underneath of the literal sun and the scripture is saying that that position is not new it was before just like the sun it's got to go back to where it came from it's the wind it's got to go back to where it came from the waters return from where they come from your placing is not new to Christ it may be new to you but it's not new to Christ is there anything whereever it may be said see this is new it hath been already of old time which was before us I say praise the Lord for that amen John 6:60 many therefore of his disciples when they had heard it heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it this was when Jesus was going through the list and telling them I'm the bread that came down from heaven um and so forth when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doth this offend you what and if ye shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father so Jesus is here declaring himself plainly before them and he's asking you know does this offend you what I've said about my position and he says well if that offends you what will you do and what will you say when I Ascend back up from where I come from and he says there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him Jesus knew from the beginning I'm venturing to say that this wasn't from the beginning when he met them on the earth Jesus knew from the beginning Jesus knew from the beginning who would not believe and who would betray him well if that's true in the negative it's got to be true in the positive if he knew in the beginning who was not going to believe him surely he knew who would believe him and Jesus references this he says therefore said unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father in John 1 verse1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things listen to the terminology all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men all things were made by him when Elijah is to come he's to restore all things Jesus when he was here knowing all things this things is an interesting term because even when the Holy when the scriptures would speak of Jesus coming to this earth the angel would speak to Mary and it told her that that Holy thing that Holy thing that you shall give birth to it'll be called Emanuel that Holy thing a that thing was a person that thing was the Lord Jesus Christ but even in the scriptures it's recorded as a thing so in verse three here it says all things were made by him I'm just going to put myself in there because if it if if Jesus could be called a thing I can be called a thing all things were made by him I was made by him and without him was not anything made that was made I want to read this quote out of the uncertain sound 1960 brother brandom said and they just found out recently that your body is full of light ex-ray proves that the X-ray does not have any light of its own it's the light it's your light that it uses you're born with four Rays after a while say 2025 one ray goes out and 35 another or 40 another one goes out and finally when you get past 65 you're living on your last Ray and every time you take an x-ray picture you're tearing them Rays down that's the reason you don't have no more you stick these kids feet in these machines because it's just tearing the Rays right out of their little bodies and that's Cosmic light that's in you that you're made up of full of light cells now that's Cosmic light he's talking about the natural body and an x-ray not producing the light that your body actually contains light within itself to form that x-ray he says that is Cosmic light but God is a different light but yet he's light now I think that that picture there is great proof of what I'm fixing to say I wasn't there when he was preaching this but I'm guessing to say he's talking about the picture of the pillar of fire above his head he says now I think that that picture there is great proof of what I'm fixing to say that God is light and when we were walking in light of God as sons of God God is Not Cosmic light but God's light operated through the cosmic light of our bodies our cells we were absolutely at one time real genuine sons of God but then when the fall came like seaweed you get in the bottom of a sea a lot of time divers and they'll get under this seaweed and before they know it they're wrapped up in such a way that they can't get out that's what the sin has done to the human being that's the way coldness has done to the church that's the way communist has done to the nation it's so treacherous and in the human body it's wrapped us up it's pushing out this light of God by denominations and denying the faith and so forth It's pushed out all the Rays of God's great power the power of Faith see that's in us that should be they've pushed all those Rays out in such a place till we just got to a lodge and then now below the lodge the church is cuz it's just pushed all the darkness out and even just saying it doesn't happen denying that it could happen see the miracles of god so brother Branda makes the comment that's just astounding to me that before we were here he says God we were absolutely at one time real genuine sons of God in so much that we that God's light the light of God not Cosmic light but the Holy Light Of God could operate through he says our body and ourselves now like I said before I do not understand this but I believe it I do not understand this but I believe this and we know that brother brandham taught us that in before the beginning all the way back if we would just uh put it in our own human Minds as far back as we could go that we were thoughts in the mind of God and he would express that to us that those thoughts are not like like man's thoughts but God's thoughts are real not like man's thoughts God's thoughts were real so we know that he taught us that but then he would come and and make this comment that not not only were we thoughts but were we thoughts but we were so real to the point that we had bodies we had cells and that God light could work through that now I can't say that that's still in thought form because I don't know my thoughts are not like God's thoughts this could still be in thought form but because God's thoughts are real this could still transpire humanly thinking when I when I see the terminology bodies and cells I say that's not a thought that's something that's manifested but remember our thoughts are not like God's thoughts you know we have the little cartoon drawing of the man sitting here and he's got a little bubble coming up out of his head and he's got his thought there like he's thinking something well that's not God's thoughts when God has a thought it's real it's it's brother Brandon says it's not like a contractor who would think of a project and start laying out pieces of that project when God has a thought of the project the project is there the project is real the project is complete in so much that the scriptures to could declare that the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world that was not frivolous that was real and again I say this without a real clear understanding of what I'm even talking about but a prophet knows what he's talking about and a prophet would declare to us that even I would say it this way even if he's still referencing that this is in thought form these thought forms were not flippant thoughts and I just want to emphasize that that God's thoughts are not like our thoughts so we don't want when when brother Brandon would would say that that in in the mind of God uh that we were thoughts in the mind of God I don't know that we fully give that the weight that we should because that's the answer to the devil's question knowing that we were in the mind of God knowing that we were real brother BR says real genuine sons of God now again as humans when we see this terminology sons of God we automatically think a person a human being a son or a daughter but remember brother brandham taught us that a son the the word son simply means something that came out of the father so the word son does not necessarily have to mean here in the form that I am in now I'm a son of Michael seabolt a son is simply something that came out of the father whatever form that may be in whether that's in a theophany form whether that's in a thought form whether that's in brother Brandon would say one of these little clinkers that spun off of God that spun off the logos whatever form that is it's still a Son of God and again I stand here not an expert or author Authority on this subject but I know enough and brother brandham has said enough that this is real you call it a clinker if you want to you call it a thought if you want to you call it uh a that you could put on the condescension of God and of the sons of God but at the end of the day when we track all of that back brother brandom says that God had you in his thoughts and his thoughts were real they were real not flippant thoughts not something that may be or may not be but thoughts that were real and I believe through the preaching and the teaching of the message that it has brought us back to that understanding to give us that confidence the ability to believe the word that has come through this ministry that is that is a rare occurrence that is not something that we should be take that we should take lightly the ability to hear from the father through the message of this hour and the capability to believe it means one thing that you had to have been there and you had to have been real before continuing in this same quote he says well that's the way I'm sorry let me skip down he says and yet yet the man somewhere down in him he's he's talking after the fall came and we get all tangled up in seawe like a diver does he says and yet the man somewhere down in him somewhere in him as I Illustrated it like a button when a man is saved that much of him is God that's the little light that comes in so he's saying at your new birth when you're saved he says there is a light that comes in like a button that light comes in to make him quit doing what's wrong he says now if you can take all of the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out if you can take all of that out that little button like of the light and power of God will keep growing so again we know that our new birth is not the end go our new birth is just the starting point and brother brandom says that when you are born again you have the light of God come into you and it's about like a button but if you will continue to die out to yourself and that you will clear this out of your life the envy and the strife and the unbelief that light will continue to grow in your being it'll be it will keep growing growing growing growing crowding out unbelief and you don't do it by exhortations of bodily exercise you do it by a Sanctified consecrated life that the holy spirit moves through you he says I caught some of it in a place not long ago how many ever remembers Elijah Perry was raised from the dead that morning some of you over here he says I caught some of that not too long ago in a place and he starts referencing this testimony he had been dead several hours he died with hemorrhages of the lungs and he was so bloody all over and I started to walk away from the bed and I felt somebody lay their hand on me I thought it was sister schaer and when I turned there was nobody around me and I started to move away this way then I felt that hand again and I turned back it wouldn't get off of me and before I know what I was doing I was laying on top of that man with my lips against his lips and I was as bloody as he was laying there on that man crying out to God and I felt something come up up around the side of my ear it was his hand you've heard him stand right here and testify of it so brother Brandon is making this comment of the light of God working through our being and that when we're born again this light of God will come into this manifestation of our being and he says I ran into some of it a little while ago and then he gives a testimony of the result of that we have a dead man coming back to life the light of God working through the being and he says Readers Digest picked it up and in America here we got it wrote out here in the reader digest where they had examined for Divine Healing and they took a brother that prayed for the sick and had a sick man and had him praying for the sick and then they put a piece of lead foil anyone knows lead foil reflects that Ray upon between the man and that man that was praying the brother it laid it down like this and shot the picture of the X-ray and from the man's hand showed a visible reflection of a ray coming out of his hand going to the other man so this is this is not just a good thought even though it is a good thought now brother brandom is saying that science has even picked this up science is even testifying to the fact that when somebody is interceding for a brother for another person and they are praying the prayer of faith there is literally a measurable amount of life going from that individual into that other individual God know God knew what he meant when he said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover laying on of hands of this man upon a sick man and the mechanical x-ray showing the light coming from the man's hand he says someday this is just Thrills my soul he says someday you're going to find out that God is in you prise God I say let it be today Let It Be This Day science has progressed so far to the so far that they're picking up on these Supernatural uh Transmissions of light and brother Brandon would compile all of that and come and make the point to us that all of this is happening that so that someday me and you can come to the recognition that God is in you that's the point let's not get confused by the terminology or the manifestations the thought the theophany the clinker let's come back to the point of the matter and the point of the matter is that somehow some way God is dwelling in mortal [Applause] flesh and it can not only have an effect on my mortal flesh but once I come to a recognition of all things things and that I come from God and that I'm going to God now I can start having a positive effect and a positive outflow on my brothers and sisters 1957 questions and answers brother brandham says now when he the logos went out of God which was God coming from this one big Fountain into a body in the form of a man and it made the logos which we call theophany now if you take the theophany when you're looking at that that's a man now that's where we were in the beginning now you do not understand it now but you were back there in the beginning that way when God made Man In His Image he made him a theophany and he only placed him in flesh so that he could till the soil could touch that theophany doesn't touch it doesn't see taste smell hear these senses that we have so God put me stand down here in order to touch and to feel and as he walked through the garden first as a theophany like the holy spirit is in here now walking in here he led the animal life it controlled everything but it couldn't till the soil so God put him in flesh so that he could till the soil he gave him five senses to till the soil and fix up The Vineyards and so forth then the man still looked Lonesome skipping down several paragraphs he says what do we do well my dear sainted brother my dear sainted sister before the foundation of the world when God created You In His Image he made you a theophany just like himself when he said let us to the creatures that he had made let us make man in our own image in our likeness a theophonic cried Lord let me see you he said go Yonder and hide in the Rock in the cliff and Moses got back in that cliff and when God passed by the lightning and thundering and as God passed by he had his back turned like this and Moses said it was the back of a man now there you are that's the way we are here we came from a higher being in the beginning we were in the image of God the V hell and the Darkness keeps us from knowing it now so I feel very confident when I come and tell you that I don't understand these things the way that I should understand them brother brandham says the veil and the Darkness keeps us from knowing these things now and I don't know that we will ever come to a perfect understanding of this we may we may not I don't know but brother brandom is clearly saying that there is a a veil there is a Darkness that's keeping us from knowing this the way that we used to know it but it doesn't change the fact that we were there in the capacity that he said we were there so even if the veil in the darkness would keep me from having a complete perfect understanding of that what understanding that has been brought to me I want to hold on to with my life because it is that Revelation that has the overcoming power it is that Revelation that is going to Trump all things it is that Revelation when I come to the day and the hour that I know that it is my time to depart from this world and go to the father it is that Revelation that's going to literally change this body if we need a perfect understanding of what he's talking about here that darkness and that Veil will be removed for us I don't think it's something that we have have to force into I don't think it's something that we have to make up or act like that we understand I think we can be comfortable saying I don't completely understand this but it doesn't change the fact that I was a real genuine Son of God before and I came from the father and I'm going to the father he says you can't know it now but you was in the beginning and if that he starts quoting scripture and if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting Hallelujah and then we move into this theophany what we once lived so we can eat and Shake Hands questions and answers on Genesis 1953 brother randam says now the first man now he made the first man in His image and we are returning back to that image that's right to our first created image when God created me William brandham I was before the foundation of the world he made my being he made my spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know of but I was there and that's all that I'm saying this morning I may not be conscious of anything but I was there oh I don't believe you're getting it but Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said here that he chose us in him before the world began now there was some part of me and Orman Neville and the rest of you all here that's in Christ Jesus before the world begin and here's to my analysis of that I think that the people today that are possessed with this Spirit a part of these Angelic beings Spirits which rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devil's lie in heaven he calls it a theophonic being but my favorite thing is he says some part of me some part of me call it what you want but some part of me was so real that God's light could work through my being in so much that I could resist the devil's lie in heaven we wonder how that we have overcome the things in our life the trials the tribulation the hardships the broken hearts the false teachings the false doctrines the false Ministries the the horrendous things the abuse that's happened to each and every one of us why didn't those snuff out our light why why didn't those put an end to us that's right because it can't it didn't in the beginning and it can't now we wonder how did I overcome the darkness that I was stuck in and we each individual has different circumstances that we were stuck in some false churches some false teachings some vices whatever the case may be some just in our own self our own genetic makeup our own complexes how did we overcome all of this we couldn't be stuck in that condition Saints because we were not Darkness to begin with we were light to begin with we cannot be stuck in darkness that's how we've overcome it wasn't because that we tried harder that we did better that we made a decision here or we made a decision there no God made a decision and even if we make a decision now it's because we've made a decision then before now to resist the devil's lie while we were in heaven as the scripture says there's nothing new Under the Sun there's nothing new going on here what has been is what is you can't keep light in darkness you can't snuff out light by Darkness even if it's just a little sliver of light it's always more powerful than Darkness even a little sliver of Truth is always always going to Trump false it may take years it may take decades but that doesn't matter at the end of the day what has been will be and we thank God for that Revelation Christ is the mystery Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Brandon speaking he says so you can see here basically in the beginning the very thought that God had in his mind he hid it from all of these Scholars and just a selected predestinated number was the only ones that heard it past tense heard it let me back up he says so you can see here basically in the beginning the very thought that God had in his mind he hid it from all of those Scholars and just a selected predestinated number was the only ones that heard it again past tense and now search back through the scriptures down through the age of the prophets and see if it wasn't the same thing and Jesus here referring to them to the prophets and to the Psalms he says they all spoke of him and here these Jewish Jewish teachers rabbis doctors of the law Prof professors listen to this had did exactly like they had done before the people that were manifested in human flesh in the days that Jesus was physically walking the Earth brother random says the Jewish teachers rabbis doctors of the law professors had did exactly like they had done before their decision did not change simply because they became manifested on the earth their decision had already been made they had already made a decision before if that is true in the negative how can it not be true in the positive for us the indictment this is not just one time that brother Brandon mentions this he mentions it multi multiple times he says in the indictment guilty of crucifying him sure I indict this generation finding them Guilty by the same word that found them guilty at the beginning when did he say that they crucified him at the beginning what did he say that they did exactly like they had done before they crucified him by the same word that found them guilty at the beginning that's right Jesus said who can condemn me he was the word made flesh and today the same word is made flesh what same word the same word that was in the beginning that they crucified then how did they crucify it how did they crucify it then they belied the devil's lie but there was a group of people that didn't believe the devil's lie who heard the thoughts of God and who resisted that and they'll make the same decision now that they're manifested even in hybrid flesh they will make the the same decision now that we made back then the same as the scribes and Pharisees did the children of God will make the same decision that they made them if it's true for them it's true for us back in Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother brandom says and they're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon and shut up all the churches you see that and churches like this who is not denomination they'll use them for a storehouse anything and if any man goes and offer a prayer for anybody else that don't belong to the ecumenical movement will be shot on the spot it's already ready that that Lutheran Minister the head of it said so and it's right here you can read it right here in your magazine don't make any difference what they say that church will stand true in the fight he's saying it doesn't matter what the ecumenical movement will do the church is going to stand true in the fight he says she's already proved it back Yonder sh and she'll do it again again I I don't have a clear understanding of that I don't remember making that decision I don't remember resisting the devil's lie in heaven but brother brandom says that I've already proved it the reason that I will stand today is I've already proved it back Yonder and that I will do it again I'm not even here to say that we've only made this decision twice and that we've only resisted the devil twice in the thoughts of God and here now I don't know what transpires in between that time frame we may have already fought this battle a hundred times but I know we've at least fought it twice then and now and the outcome whether it's twice or whether it's 200 million million times the outcome is not going to change what we did then is what we are going to do now the same as the scribes and Pharisees had made their decision then for the negative we have made our decision for the positive he says she'll do it again in the face of everything it's the word of God 1960 the unfailing realities of the Living God brother brandom says let me say one more thing Creeds does not satisfy a Hungry Heart if a man is hungering for him you hungering for God you tell him say the Apostles Creed join the church put your name on here be sprinkled or immersed or whatever you want that will never satisfy a hungry Soul cuz they were predestinated of God to search for life they were once the Angels who did not fall 2third of the angels of heaven fell that's these evil spirits working amongst people very religious you know the Bible says that you was not just all always right here you were once somewhere El else I say praise the Lord I'm thankful for that I was not always just right here I was once somewhere else John 643 Jesus therefore therefore answered see this is not just brother Brandon making up a good thought or making up a good comment this is scriptural right John 6:43 Jesus therefore answered and said unto him murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me we've spoke on this before so I don't I'm not going to spend a lot of time on it but as I said this is not just some thought that brother brandom is throwing out there to excite the people or to get a response this is scriptural hath heard hath learned past tense he says not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god meaning except he which is of god he hath seen the father you hath been taught you hath learned and you hath seen the father how I don't know but it doesn't change the truth in the future home brother brandom says you become a new person not just an old one patched up by joining the church or trying to turn a new page but you are a complete brand new unit God takes the old man and burns him completely out with a holy ghost in Fire and comes down himself sends down your represent resentation sends down your representation no then he starts quoting scripture no man can come to me except my father hath drawn him and all the father hath given me will come to me amen speaking of the new birth brother brandom says when that transpires God sends down your representation my question question to you is my was my representation already there or did it magically appear when I was born again the ability to be born again means you already had representation brother brandom says only the elect are considered in Redemption he sends down your representation what form that is in I don't know but I know brother brandom says that when you heard heard the message and you left the other thing you heard from your theophany that's right so if we have to put terminology to it I would say sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the skies in multitude and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them AAR off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and this is the verse I want to key on and truly if they had been mindful of the country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned this is speaking of the natural seat of Abraham but if it's true in the natural it's true in the spiritual and the principle is if they would have known from what country they came out of they would have had an opportunity to return I would say that we have been given Insight onto what country we have came out of and by default that gives us an opportunity to return to that country in the church age brother in the church ages brother Brandon says and the Stars which he's holding each star now look could we just stop a minute I want you to get this a star was the minister and a minister Anointed with the spirit from above do you realize that you repres represent a star in heaven and every Star in heaven represents you remember brother brandom taught us that God had three Bibles he wrote it first in the stars and the heavens he wrote it in the pyramids and he wrote it in his written word so if my position is represented in the Stars what possibility and chance is there for me to come to this day in this manifestation of this word for this hour and it be something different that's what's represented in the stars that was written first and that was even after the beginning remember brother Brandon said and the scripture says that there were 2third of those stars that fell their position was written in the heavens they fell from that position it's written it's documented in the heavens but there was a third of those stars that didn't fall and he says do you realize that one of those Stars represents you well if I was one of those thirds that did not fall and I still have that representation there what is the chances that Lo DEA is going to overcome me going to venture to say none we should take comfort in these things we should take comfort in these things in The Daily Grind when we're resisting and when we're fighting and when we're striving to do what is right to do what is true and when we fall flat on our face we need to come back to this Revelation that I was a star that did not fall and I am going back to that position that is overcoming power that is an overcoming Revelation as we would start to wind down here let's go to Luke 15 Luke 15:1 this say story of The Prodigal Son extremely familiar passage of scripture but there are a couple things in here that are very interesting Jesus speaking he said and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that fth to me and he divided unto him his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with righteous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him unto his fields to feed swine and he would Fain to have filled his belly with the husk that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself this is key when he came to himself he said how many hired Servants of my fathers have breed enough to spare and I perish with Hunger I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee this is the story of The prodal Prodigal Son falling into the deep Miry clay of Le oia falling into the deep Mary clay of his own desires and his own wants he took a journey he went into a far country I would venture to say he was a he was a star he was he was a star that that was not in its correct position anymore and he's been placed in a far country not where he began at not where he started off at he started off in his father's house but he found himself somewhere else but there was a point in time right before the total darkness swallowed him up there was a point in time that he came to himself and him coming to himself directly was related to the fact that he realized I have a father who has plenty of food that he will give me even though I'm not worthy he came to himself and recognized I am not in the position that I used to be in but I used to be in a position that's not like this that I find myself in now and in that position there was plenty of food and things were a lot better the scripture just simply records that as he came to himself he came to himself he remembered that he had a father he says I will arise and go to my father my question is is this the first time that he's been to the father no it is not this is at least the second time because he was once there before so he's going back to his father and I will say unto him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee and I am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants I hope I'm not the only one that can relate to this story have we not all found ourselves in that position father I have been somewhere that I should not have been I am not worthy for you to accept me but all that I can do is ask amen I am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants so he determined this is what I'm going to say to my father when I get there and he rose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him how many has started returning to the father and you can recognize where you're at today when I first started I was a great way off from the father when I first made the decision when I first came to myself I was still a great way off from the father but where I'm at today I may still be a great way off from getting back completely to my father's house but thank be to God the father's not standing there waiting he's not just sitting there in a chair saying well he'll eventually get here the scripture says that when he was a still a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran how many's thankful that God has ran to you he has ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son you know he had this speech ready he says he says father I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son but the Father the father didn't even have anything to say to him the father turns to the servant bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive again and he was lost and is found and they begin to be marry that's how quick forgiveness won the son had a prepared speech I'm going to come to the father and I'm going to plead my case and I'm going to tell him this and I'm going to tell him that and the father when he came with a true repentance the father didn't even address it he said go kill the fatted calf go get the best robe go put the ring on his finger he didn't say well go do penants for a week go do this go do that he has already provided he doesn't even address it he's repented he's seen a repentant heart go kill the fatted calf let's be merry amen for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be married now his Elder son was in the the field and as he came and Drew n to the house he heard music and dancing and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father out and entreated him and he answering said to his father Lo these many years do I serve thee neither transgress I had any time thy commandment and yet thou never gavest me a kid that I might make marry with my friends but as soon as this son was Come Thou hath dived thy live who hath which hath dived thy living with harlots thou Hast killed for him the fatted calf and he said unto him and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all I have is done what Revelation did he give him to overcome this complex all that I have is thine son son son all that I have is thine Jesus knowing all things had been given into his hands and that he was a Son of God that he came from God and went to God had overcoming power for all things amen this parable that Jesus is teaching has the same same language entwined into it the father simply reminds him of his position and reminds him son you're my son and all that I have is thine what are you upset about why are are you so frustrated you are my son is that not enough can anybody relate to this amen we get so tangled up in the Affairs of the world we get so tangled up about this situation and that situation and this church and that church and this Doctrine and this teaching and this past abuse and this thing in our life and this complex and this genetic makeup but the father is just standing there looking at us son come back to a proper understanding come back to your your spiritual placing come back to the knowledge of all things come back to the revelation of what is important you have got your eyes directed on everything else and you've got yourself all worked up about something because you have left the most important thing son son you are mine you are my son and all that I have is thine what more do we need what more could we ask for what does it matter how he treats or doesn't treat anybody else or how he does or doesn't deal with any other situation and I'm not saying that we live with our head in the clouds and we don't deal with situations that we have to deal with but I would say let us bring every situation under the the under the power of this Revelation and let's let's have this Revelation on the foremost of our minds when things are going sideways directly or indirectly I am a son and he has given me all things he has been kind enough to send me a prophet to come in the form of a prophet and reveal himself to me as his son what he hath taught me before he is teaching me now what more could I ask for amen I find it astounding that this is a son that could stand there and look his father in the eye and say I have done all of your Commandments and I have not aired one time and his father didn't correct him he didn't say well there was this time you did he stands there and he says I have done everything everything and I've kept all your Commandments but he still had jealousy laying in his heart he was still more concerned about his brother's position and his brother's reception than he was about his own position that's why I say getting all the teachings and all the doctrines to me that's not it that comes with it and I will never say that that's not important because it's extremely important but I believe that you can have such intellectual power and an intellectual understanding and a legalistic ability to do what is right and what is what is uh true and I like I said I don't belittle any of that I should I say we should be more like that but at the end of the day the problem here with this son even though he can say I've done everything you've asked me to do the problem was he still had something laying in his heart he still had jealousy laying in his heart and the father had to come and deal with that he had to come and remind him it doesn't matter about anybody else what matters is you're my son and all that I have is thine quit worrying about your brother and I would just say me personally that I don't ever want to find myself in that position I don't want to ever find myself in the seat of the scornful of somebody who's went Wayward and somebody who's lost track but they would come with a repentant heart I I pray to God that I would never have that in my life that I would come and say well Lord I've served you for x amount of years and I've done this and I've sacrificed this and you're blessing that person and you know they just they just came back two weeks ago and look at all that they've done I want to be there putting the robe on him putting the ring on his finger helping Phil dress that cow I want to be cooking the meat for him I want to be rejoicing and I want to be merry regardless of how Wayward and how long that it's been I want to respond with the power of the Revelation that I am a son of this father and a wayward son has returned what can I do to help him what can I do to assist him how can I encourage him or her I want to respond correctly there's a couple more scriptures as we would close here Ephesians 1:3 our pastor read this Wednesday night very familiar but I just want to repeat it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world and again I want to emphasize I'm I'm not an authority on this topic I've probably done a very poor job of Pres presenting this but this is all that I want to say this is all that I want to hold before you this is all that I want to remind you of I want this to be on the foremost of your mind every day day in and day out he hath chosen Us in some way in some shape or in some form before the foundation of the world and what happens now and what happened yesterday and what happened what will happen tomorrow is not going to Trump that he hath chosen us that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love skipping down to verse 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will I believe this mystery is the same mystery that's in re Revelation 10:7 having made known to us the mystery what mystery as brother brand says one day you're going to find out that God is in you amen having made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things what did Jesus know had been given unto him all things and he will gather those together to him verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ Israel and the church brother Brenham says now it's election I want to get on that election strong cuz it's the truth now you didn't become a Christian just coincidence because you became a Christian before you was in this world before you were born God ordained you to be a Christian from the Garden of Eden from before the foundation of the world all you say is that right brother that's the truth before there was ever you know anything I'm comfortable resting in that I I didn't know anything but he's telling me and a prophet has the authority to do this he's telling me before I even knowed anything I was a Christian God had chosen me and ordained me to be a Christian there was a time that you knew praise the Lord there was a time that you knew your mind is darkened to that now I don't understand that this is just my thought I could be a million miles from right but to me there is some type of rules and contingency that God has agreed to in this battle that has Spilled Out of Heaven onto Earth and to me part of this contingency in this rules of warfare is that he knew that if we would have a proper understanding of what we knew before that Satan wouldn't even have a chance if that makes sense we understand he don't have a chance um and here I am trying to use language to explain these things and it's just not going to work but we understand that there were Rules of Engagement and there were things that had to be agreed on there was a Battleground set and Satan would know that if they come remember remember uh we'll get to that in a second I don't want to go there yet but there was a reason that we could not come with this proper understanding and that reason brother Brandon says is so that we could be tempted and tried by sin if we would have come just directly the way that we should have come there would not have been a test or a temptation but he says there was a time that you knew this but you can't know it now to me again that's just my opinion you don't have to agree with that but to me that is that is part of that spiritual warfare that was agreed upon he says your mind is darkened to that now there's only been one man this is what I was going to refer to there's only been one man on Earth that knew that he was before and that was Jesus Jesus had this proper clear perfect understanding our minds are darken to it but Jesus is what wasn't he said glorify me father with the glory that I had with you before the foundation of the world he was the Incarnate God he could move back there and know what it was but our minds are blackened there but we were ordained predestinated see he says he says that and I believe that and I rest in that I'm comfortable with that but he doesn't just leave it there he says our minds are black there but we are were ordained predestinated so he immediately starts going into trying to expound upon that to give us what light that we can have you know what predestinate means predestination of anything was pre-a by God Amen that's not skim milk now notice I believe that stumped you we better go over there just a minute turn over with me to Ephesians the 1 chapter this is what we just read and let's read just a little cuz I'm afraid your missing that and you just think that I'm saying that I am not now Paul is speaking addressing Ephesians Ephesians 1 directly to the shoulder to the church that's what we're doing tonight this is not for babies this is for grown-ups not babies little babies I got a little one back there just now learning to walk he'd Boop and fall down get back up and he thought he was doing something great I was that way one day but now I'm a man I put away child childish things so brother random is expressing this is not skin milk this is not for babies this is not a light teaching this is strong this is this is uh real and this this is uh true I'm not just making this up he says now we got to come to full Doctrine full Doctrine all things I like good old shouting meetings where we just clap our hands or shout and have a good time have great powerful services and things dance on the bubble as it were but then when The Showdown time come you don't know where you're standing let's get back and find out let's find out what's making us do that let's get back to the foundation see where we're at what Foundation is he talking about Ephesians 1 that's the scripture that he's referencing your mind is darkened to that now but let me expound upon that because you can have great services and dance and shout and these things that he lists he says but when The Showdown comes it's not going to hold you there's one thing that's going to hold you and I'm going to expound that to you Ephesians 1 predestinated in him before the foundation of the world the knowledge of where you come from and where you're going he declares when The Showdown Comes This is what will hold you let's go back to the foundation to see where we're at as the musicians would come I'll finish with this scripture in uh Philippians Philippians 2 brother brandom says we've got to come to full Doctrine and we've got to get back to the foundation to see where we're at how many wants to come to full Doctrine how many wants to have a proper understanding of where we're at where we were and where we're going to as I said before things that were are directly related to things that will be things that are to be but things that were and things that are to be are both directly related to things that are does that make sense so we can come and rest in things that were and we can rest in things that are to be but that's not the battle that's going on now the battle that's going on now is things that is and you will never have a victory with the battle that is if you don't have an understanding of things that were and things that are to be does that make sense that's what it was given to us for was for overcoming power for now when we get to things that are to be brother brand says when you enter into that being into that body you know all things we're not going to need the overcoming power then now is when we need the overcoming power that that Revelation is going to put us into things that are to be and we know that things that are to be are simply a body a body that we are going to Philippians 2:5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus what mind was in Christ Jesus John Chapter 13 all things have been given under my hands I have come from the father and I'm going to the father and this is what it continues to say in verse 6 who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross I will would venture to say that let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus that he thought it not robbery to consider himself equal with God that would be a revelation that could very easily get you puffed up and in a mindset that you should not be in but remember we have to say stay in accordance with all of the scriptures and immediately after that Revelation comes look at the results of that Revelation who Jesus having this Revelation took up a towel and GED himself and became a servant to his brother Jesus thinking it not robbery to be equal with God being found in fashion as a man humbled himself that's the result of a proper understanding of this Revelation humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the Cross this is not a revelation that is profound and as rich and as powerful is it as it is this is not a revelation that's going to put us out of a proper manifestation of a Son of God with a a proudful and a boastful and an arrogant attitude this proper revelation will bring humility it did with Jesus it did with every believer through the Scriptures it did with the prophet of our age why would it go sideways now and result in an arrogance spirit this this Revelation is a revelation that I feel we have to have though because it's directly related to the scriptures if we if we truly believe if we would all stand if we truly believe that we are in the closing moments of Time how many believe that that we are in the closing moments of time and that it is the time is at hand that we we are to depart out of this world and go to the father how are we going to do that if our revelation of our spiritual placing and position is up one day and down the next up one day down the next today I'm a Son of God tomorrow I'm not today that I am but two hours from now I made a mistake and now I'm not that may have worked for the church ages but remember we're not in the church ages we have been called out of the church ages we are standing like no other people have stood on the face of this Earth we are standing not just in a position not just to be saved and make it we're not called just to be saved and make it we are called to literally put death under our feet and have our atoms changed and these bodies go to a different dimension we're not called just to be saved and make it we're called to be raptured and brother random says how can we have rapturing faith if we don't even have faith for Divine Healing so how can we have rapturing faith if we don't even have faith that I have come from the father and that I'm going back to the father and doesn't mean that our emotions are not going to play with us and that we're not going to have to come overcome those on a on a daily basis but I venture to say that there is no other Revelation that is going to overcome that for you but this Revelation this Revelation that has been brought to us through the message of the hour was brought to us so that we could have perfect faith in where we came from and where we're going and by default who we are now let's pray together precious Lord Jesus we just want to thank you for this time that you've given us Lord father and as we said before we stand here totally inadequate to even Broach this subject Lord we don't stand here as a man with prophetic Insight who could make statements like this Lord we we can't even make these statements only only your Vindicated Prophet could make these statements Lord father and even if we come before them without a perfect revelation of such and not being able to see the things that he was seeing as he would make these statements Lord we still want to declare them and we want to declare them as true and we want to declare that we believe them Lord and we want to thank you that you have not left our minds completely veiled and in complete darkness but you have come and you have started to strip away spiritual Amnesia Lord and to bring back to our remembrance what your Prophet said that we once knew before and that W that we were real genuine sons of gods sons of God before Lord we thank you for that Revelation I pray that you would continue to reveal it to us Lord I pray that you would continue to expound it to us and I pray that you would allow us to continue to yield to that as things would get Topsy Turvy Lord and as hardships would come and as a press would come or a squeeze would come or persecution would come I pray that we would be able to rest and Hold Steady and be full grown adul uh Christians and overcome by the same power and Revelation that you overcome by Lord may you continue to make it real to us Lord Make It Real to us in our hearts Lord and make our lives manifest it may we demonstrate it and manifest it as we would walk on this Earth we love you and we appreciate you we just commit ourselves in this day into your hands Lord we pray that you would just take the words that have been spoken of anything has been said that would cause confusion or misunderstanding I pray that you would just go and that you would fix it Lord and that you would make it right Lord that you would just accomplish the point and the purpose that you've had for the preaching here this morning we ask this and commit it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you brother will I have a father brother Chad please he calls me his old he'll never leave me no matter where I go He Knows My [Music] Name he knows my every thought he SE each tear that falls and hears me when I call I have a maker he for my heart before even time began my life was in his hand He Knows My Name he knows my every thought he sees each tear that falls and he hears me when I go and he hears me and he hears me when I go amen oh I pray that God will give me a better revelation of the fact I came from God and I go to God Amen we we've heard it preached we've been we've seen it uh in the message we see it in the scriptures we know it's true but oh I need it to become more true in my heart to settle out all uncertainty to put to to bed all fear all mistrust and uncertainty and and Troublesome Waters may it all just be put to rest with the fact that he knows the way that I take he predetermined he saw before he knows me he's known me from before the foundation of the world not not necessarily me in the way I think of me but me in the way he thought of me he's known me I say you know I still remember I remember what it was like coming to the message and growing up in church and growing up as a Pentecostal boy and I remember what it was like coming to the message and hearing things that I had never heard before strange things that seemed strange and so different than what I taught I remembered what it was like amen but I also remember what it was like amen knowing that when I come to this revelation of the word it was like coming home and how could it be like coming home when I've never heard these things before I mean there was times there would come out of my heart an amen Amen brother that's the truth and it's as if I already knew it but i' never heard it before intellectually I could know I never heard it before but something about it seems so familiar where did that come from Friends amen because we were part of God from the very found before the foundation of the world Amen whatever transpired between then and now we could sit and debate about it for hours and hours and hours amen and may God let us see it but the consequential part to that is that I know that I was there and when he knew me from before the foundation of the world and he knew the way that I would take and nothing is out of kill her from with God everything's just ticking right on time and like our brother Ben was saying that revelation will hold us in this day a lot of teaching amen there's a lot of teaching but the teaching should help us translate it into a life there's so many things that when your loved one sick and dying understanding the sequence of end time events may not be the thing that's on your mind right then when you hit tragedy in your life and you're crying through the night because you have no idea how this is going to work out out understanding what happens first the Millennium and and Gog and Magog or that may not be the thing that's on your mind but when you hit tragedy in your life the one thing that may come to your mind is God I know that you know and I know that you've called me and I know that you predestinate me and I know that you've already seen the solution to this problem and I'm putting all my trust in you because I believe you've called me a son and in my heart there was a witness that said I am a son I'm your son and all when all of this was determined before the foundation of there I was there and somehow I was real and somehow I knew it and somehow it didn't scare me then don't know how all that works but God help it not to scare me now amen I believe it's important for us to realize that God already has seen it God already knows when it was all determined and all set out in the mind of God we were there not like this however we were there we were there and now that we come into the dark cloud of this Veil and so many things about that transition we don't understand but when we're walking around in darkness if one light can keep shining in in us in our heart to know I was there I was there when he decided I was there when he laid out the victory I was there when he showed how this flesh would manifest his glory in this end time I was there everything is okay amen remember God is not coming looking for sheep he's a Shepherd looking for lost sheep he's not just walking around picking up sheep he's po he's picking up his lost sheep if they're lost sheep they were his sheep to begin with I'm so glad the shepherd came and found me and when he came and found me he was proving to me that I was his sheep from before the foundation of the world I've always been his sheep not a new sheep I'm his restored sheep oh let that Revelation carry us friends amen I'm thankful for it I want it to grow in my heart amen let's just bow our heads and thank the Lord for his word dear Lord Jesus I'm so thankful Lord that in this Dark Age of Satan's even it's the darkest time upon the Earth there is mass confusion there's been media Outlets by the droves and and forms of communication that is exceeded Lord it exceeded the Telegraph and gone to the telephone exceeded the telephone gone into television exceeded that and gone to the internet and now Lord there's evil Wicked messages Darkness passing all through the world Lord frightening things fearful sights mixed messages confusion on every hand Lord this is the darkest time it's ever been but God in this age you foresaw it you knew it you would bring the greatest light and the most tremendous Revelation to the sons of God that have ever been so that we know who we are and where we came from and where we're going and what it is you're wanting to do in our lives now Lord you gave us that light to Hold Us in the midst of this darkness and God as as confusing messages mix all around in our minds as we hear with these ears and see with these eyes things that are so contrary to your word so contrary to your desire God May there come a knowing that's beyond the brain a seeing that's beyond These Eyes a hearing that's beyond these ears but from the seed that's in the soul the real us from before the foundation of the world may come true understanding and true knowledge and true eyesight and true hearing to hear your word and your plan for us and for this day God I pray that your truth would transcend all of the natural Lord and all of the mechanical and go down into the Heart Lord and remind us of things we once knew awaken us to things that we had drifted to sleep in but that are realities oh we love you you we thank you for the word that you've given to us and I pray God that that word that Revelation that light would sustain us through this part of the journey they give us light to seeed to make the next move they give us courage to stay fast in this word regardless of the circumstances and God may your will be accomplished on Earth as it is in heaven we love you father we ask you help us bless our brother Ben restore to him his strength continue to inspire him and encourage him Lord feed him on your word Feed Us on the word and may we grow may we grow to your very likeness we go into your very representation on this Earth may we move all the way into adoption where we become on this Earth exactly like our father doing what he would do Lord that's your purpose in our lives in this day we surrender to it Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen God

every myy clay has we've been lifted out how do you know because it was finished in the mind of God before the foundation of the world I think sometimes we have to remind ourselves of that that I was there when the plan was formed I was in his mind he he finished the work from before the foundation of the world The Works were finished from before the foundation of the world this mountain I don't know how to get over it but I I've been over it before now I just need to trust God and say God you show me the next step I don't know I've got spiritual Amnesia I'm stuck in this Darkness I don't
