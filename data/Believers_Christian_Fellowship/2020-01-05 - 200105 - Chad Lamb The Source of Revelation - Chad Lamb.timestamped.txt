[2:20] oh
[2:39] praise the lord and he's here
[2:43] because his word said he'd be here we're
[2:46] gathered in his name we know his name

[2:57] amen and we just appreciate that
[3:00] and he's he's here to heal and here to
[3:02] save
[3:04] amen this is the part of the service
[3:06] where we invite the lord to speak amen
[3:10] but it's a mystery because he's going to
[3:12] speak through human lips and that
[3:14] through lips of a vessel amen that is
[3:16] born wrong amen
[3:18] and is subject to failure and fault like
[3:21] any other human vessel that's out there
[3:23] but it's his method amen
[3:25] and we've got to look beyond the veil
[3:27] and we've got to have
[3:28] faith in god's method and he's here to
[3:30] heal and he's here to save
[3:31] and if we have confidence in the word of
[3:33] god then we can look beyond the veil of
[3:35] flesh and say god you speak
[3:37] you're here to speak and i'm here to
[3:39] hear and to receive your word
[3:41] amen praise be to god amen it's good to

[3:55] this year we have clear vision
[3:57] that he opens his word like never before
[4:00] and we can see
[4:01] the reality that he wants us to see
[4:03] where we live amen this dimension that
[4:05] we live in is not the reality
[4:08] amen this is just the vapor the mist the
[4:10] reflection of the reality
[4:12] the negative of a positive amen but may
[4:14] he this year let us see the positive
[4:17] more
[4:17] and more and more and more may come into
[4:20] plain view
[4:22] praise be to god let's take our bibles
[4:24] and turn to the book of revelation
[4:26] while you're turning i just want to let
[4:28] you know that um brother yatzik from
[4:30] poland will be coming in
[4:32] on tuesday this week and they'll be

[4:38] out brother ben and i had visited
[4:40] when we were uh on the trip in eastern
[4:44] europe

[4:47] over he's going to take these two
[4:48] services for us
[4:49] so i'm looking forward to that amen so
[4:51] come expecting and
[4:53] let the lord feed his sheep amen but be
[4:55] praying for his travels and
[4:57] pray for his stay while he's here let's
[5:00] look at revelation
[5:01] chapter one verse one i'm going to
[5:03] continue on from where i was
[5:05] two sundays back the last sunday that i
[5:07] ministered i
[5:08] you know we preached and i didn't really
[5:10] finish some of the things that were on
[5:11] my heart and so
[5:12] i thought i'd just pick it up again and
[5:14] continue on
[5:15] let's start here in revelations one and
[5:17] verse one
[5:19] the revelation of jesus christ that is
[5:22] an amazing statement
[5:24] that is an amazing statement now what
[5:27] you're getting ready to read
[5:28] is the revelation of jesus christ so
[5:31] you know horse riders and beasts and and
[5:35] those worshiping around the throne all
[5:37] of this is the revelation of jesus
[5:39] christ
[5:40] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[5:42] gave unto him
[5:43] to show unto his servants things which
[5:45] must shortly come to pass
[5:46] and he sent and signified it by his
[5:48] angel unto his servant john
[5:51] man let's bow our heads and ask the lord
[5:53] to bless the reading of his word
[5:55] dear lord jesus we thank you father for
[5:57] this word
[5:58] we thank you god and your grace has
[6:00] brought us to this place
[6:02] god you've brought us here to worship
[6:04] you lord you've brought us here to hear
[6:05] your word
[6:06] you've given us ears to hear and eyes to
[6:09] see and for that we're eternally
[6:10] grateful lord
[6:12] lord we just pray that you would
[6:13] continue to rub the eyes out in our eyes
[6:16] as you
[6:16] continue to unveil yourself through your
[6:18] word god let us see what you
[6:20] it is you want to instruct us in today
[6:23] what it is you want your children to
[6:24] know today
[6:25] for this hour for this moment in time
[6:28] you're accomplishing
[6:29] something lord through your bride and
[6:31] may we catch what you're doing lord and
[6:33] may today
[6:34] you guide us lord by your word give us
[6:37] instruction for living our life lord
[6:39] shape us into the living stones for your
[6:41] temple
[6:43] we love you and ask you to have
[6:44] preeminence here in jesus christ's name
[6:47] we pray
[6:48] amen you can all be seated
[6:52] i'm going to pick up this la this same
[6:54] quote that we started with last time
[6:56] out of the revelation of jesus christ
[6:58] from the church age book
[7:00] it says you will recall that i mentioned
[7:02] at the beginning of the message that
[7:04] this book we are studying
[7:05] is the actual revelation of jesus
[7:07] himself
[7:08] in the church and his work in the future
[7:10] ages then i mentioned that it takes the
[7:13] holy spirit to give us revelation
[7:15] or we will fail to get it there you go
[7:20] bringing these two thoughts together you
[7:22] will see that it won't take disordinary
[7:24] study
[7:25] and thinking to make this book real it's
[7:27] going to take the operation of the holy
[7:30] ghost that means this book can't be
[7:33] revealed to anyone
[7:34] but a special class of people
[7:38] it will take one with prophetic insight
[7:40] it will require the ability to hear from
[7:42] god
[7:43] it will require supernatural instruction
[7:46] not just a student comparing verse with
[7:48] verse
[7:48] though that is good but a mystery
[7:51] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[7:53] it never becomes
[7:54] clear we understand that the
[7:58] the mystery a mystery requires the
[8:00] teaching of the spirit
[8:02] or it never becomes clear and so just
[8:05] teaching will not bring a mystery clear
[8:08] but teaching of the spirit will bring a
[8:11] mystery clear
[8:12] there's nothing wrong with teaching amen
[8:14] teaching is one of the five-fold
[8:16] ministry gifts teaching is something
[8:18] that we're supposed to do out of the
[8:19] word
[8:19] but teaching alone cannot bring
[8:21] revelation it must come from the spirit
[8:24] of god
[8:27] how we need to hear from god and lay
[8:29] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[8:31] spirit
[8:32] to hear and know amen
[8:37] i'm convinced that that revelation is
[8:40] everything
[8:41] i'm becoming more convinced all the time
[8:43] i was convinced before but
[8:45] as we go on i get more convinced and
[8:47] more convinced and more convinced
[8:49] that it's going to require revelation
[8:51] but there's only a special class of
[8:53] people
[8:53] that can receive this revelation of
[8:55] jesus christ
[8:56] that's why this book in the book of
[8:58] revelation is the bride's book because
[9:00] of the revelation of jesus christ
[9:02] it's the capstone book to the entire
[9:04] bible and that capstone set on
[9:07] unlocks the mystery of the entire bible
[9:09] amen which is christ is the mystery of
[9:11] god revealed
[9:13] so it's amazing that what we have in our
[9:16] hands let's turn together to hebrews 11.
[9:27] look at hebrews 11 and we'll look at
[9:30] verse 1.
[9:33] now faith is the substance of things
[9:36] hoped for
[9:38] so faith is the substance
[9:41] we have to realize is we're talking in
[9:43] the supernatural spirit realm
[9:45] we're not talking about this dimension
[9:47] that we're in because this dimension we
[9:48] realize
[9:49] is not the real reality this is the
[9:52] vapor this is the myth so we know that
[9:54] this is not the real reality
[9:56] so faith is the substance
[9:59] of things hoped for faith is an actual
[10:02] substance
[10:04] it's not a fleeting thought it's not a
[10:06] funny feeling
[10:07] it's an actual substance and that's why
[10:09] when somebody has faith they have the
[10:11] substance of the things hoped for amen
[10:13] that's why they can rest so
[10:14] solidly on faith which is a revelation
[10:17] amen and they'll not waver they'll not
[10:19] be tossed about
[10:20] because what they have is not an idea
[10:22] what they have is not a thought
[10:24] what they have is substance
[10:28] faith is the substance of things hoped
[10:30] for the evidence
[10:33] of things not seen
[10:37] for by it the elders obtained a good
[10:39] report how did the elders
[10:41] everybody in the old testament all that
[10:43] had come before how did they obtain a
[10:44] good report
[10:45] by faith by faith
[10:48] amen their deeds were just an expression
[10:51] of their faith it wasn't the deeds it
[10:52] was the faith that god respected
[10:54] it was the faith that god honored amen
[10:56] it wasn't what they
[10:57] did amen what they did was only an
[11:01] outcropping of what they believed what
[11:03] they believed moved and then the action
[11:05] to fulfill the word of god and obey the
[11:06] word of god
[11:07] but they could have fulfilled the word
[11:09] and obeyed the word but without faith it
[11:11] would not have given them
[11:12] anything amen as far as merited
[11:14] righteousness
[11:16] because just obedience won't do it alone
[11:19] it has to be by faith
[11:22] so faith is the substance of things
[11:24] hoped for the
[11:25] evidence of things not seen i made a
[11:28] statement last time that that i'd
[11:30] actually picked up from a brother i was
[11:32] speaking to brother
[11:33] i think his brother aaron mcgeary we
[11:34] were having a conversation and he made
[11:36] the statement
[11:37] he says really he says you know
[11:40] revelation the personal revelation is
[11:42] the vindication
[11:44] and when he said it the roman candle
[11:45] started going off
[11:49] because faith is a revelation a
[11:51] revelation is faith
[11:52] amen and faith is the substance of
[11:55] things hoped for
[11:56] the evidence of things not seen
[12:00] so now all of a sudden amen challenging
[12:03] brother branham's vindication
[12:05] doesn't do me any harm questioning
[12:08] whether or not
[12:09] 16 men fell off a bridge or questioning
[12:11] what day the cloud showed up or what the
[12:13] cloud was made out of it
[12:14] or all of these other things or the
[12:16] healing of the boy and film the
[12:18] questioning of that
[12:19] does nothing for me because what god has
[12:21] given me by a spirit
[12:23] is substance and evidence
[12:26] so i don't need an evidence of a report
[12:29] i don't need
[12:30] evidence of a photograph i don't need
[12:32] evidence
[12:33] of brother bannon's vindication through
[12:35] scientific sources
[12:36] because what god has given me is
[12:39] evidence
[12:41] so it the faith is not just a thought
[12:44] it's not a fancy notion it's not an
[12:47] agreement amen
[12:48] faith is a substance amen of things
[12:51] hoped for it is the
[12:52] evidence of things not seen
[12:56] amen the only connection that you have
[12:59] amen with the unseen world is by faith
[13:02] and faith is a revelation so now
[13:06] we look at the scripture and realize
[13:07] amen what we should have realized all
[13:09] along
[13:10] that the scripture is right
[13:14] faith is the substance of things hoped
[13:16] for the evidence of things not seen
[13:18] and that's why amen if somebody can
[13:21] start to
[13:21] challenge natural evidences
[13:25] and it starts to bring doubt to me
[13:29] it shows amen doubt in my heart not down
[13:31] in your mind down in your mind you
[13:33] remember
[13:33] your mind has nothing to do with your
[13:35] soul
[13:36] doubts can pass through your mind you
[13:38] just reject those things
[13:40] even the devil could put thoughts in
[13:41] your mind he can bring doubts through
[13:44] your mind
[13:44] amen just because the devil put a doubt
[13:46] in your mind that doesn't mean you doubt
[13:47] it in your soul
[13:50] but when when somebody begins to
[13:52] challenge evidences
[13:55] and all of a sudden the challenge of the
[13:58] evidence
[13:59] causes me to doubt in my heart then we
[14:02] realize i
[14:03] must have never had an evidence my own
[14:06] evidence because my own evidence
[14:09] overrides
[14:10] everything else because it's a personal
[14:13] vindication to me
[14:15] that the message is true because by
[14:17] faith amen faith
[14:19] is the substance faith is the evidence
[14:23] so really i don't need anything else
[14:26] [Applause]
[14:27] if you think about what god has done
[14:29] amen god has taken
[14:31] and he's done such a supernatural thing
[14:33] and vindicated the prophet
[14:35] amen so that it will catch our attention
[14:37] amen and in catching our attention
[14:39] the word can be sown into our heart and
[14:41] when the word is sewn into our heart it
[14:43] quickens the seed that is there
[14:45] comes the life amen that is faith that
[14:47] is revelation
[14:48] amen and from that point on amen that
[14:51] was the redemption that was the
[14:53] awakening that was the restoration back
[14:55] to where you'd fallen from
[14:58] and that is the thing that takes control
[15:01] so so the the the vindication that we've
[15:04] seen all the evidences have we seen
[15:06] amen all of those things were in order
[15:09] to
[15:10] to to be the vindication of a prophet so
[15:13] that we could see the vindication of a
[15:14] prophet who would draw our attention to
[15:16] a gift of a prophet
[15:17] so that the word can come and awaken who
[15:20] we really are
[15:22] and restore us as sons and daughters of
[15:25] god back into god
[15:27] is that right and in doing so
[15:31] now we have substance
[15:34] of things hoped for and the evidence of
[15:37] things not seen
[15:39] praise be to god
[15:43] let's keep keep your place in hebrews
[15:45] but flip over to ephesians
[15:46] real quickly for me ephesians 2
[15:50] we know this scripture so well but i
[15:51] just want to lay it in here
[15:54] while we are here
[15:57] ephesians chapter 2 and verse 8.
[16:08] for by grace are you saved through faith
[16:11] and that not of yourself
[16:12] it is the gift of god not of works lest
[16:16] any man should boast
[16:17] for we as was workmanship created in
[16:19] christ jesus unto good works which god
[16:21] has before ordained that we should walk
[16:23] in them
[16:24] so so the works are not what makes you
[16:27] accepted
[16:29] it's faith
[16:33] we were it's not of works unless did he
[16:35] mention most
[16:37] but we were ordained into good works so
[16:39] god has already known the works that
[16:41] we'll do he's already ordained us to do
[16:43] certain things in the kingdom of god
[16:45] but those doing those things are not
[16:47] those doing those things are not what
[16:49] brings us salvation
[16:54] for by grace are you saved through faith
[16:57] and that not of yourselves is the gift
[16:58] of god
[17:00] so we have to make sure we keep the
[17:02] right things in the right order
[17:05] brother said anointed ones at the end
[17:06] time what is faith faith is something
[17:08] that's revealed to you
[17:10] that is not yet but you believe it will
[17:12] be faith is a revelation of the will of
[17:14] god
[17:15] amen let's go back to hebrews with if
[17:18] you can with me
[17:20] look at hebrews 11 4.
[17:27] by faith abel offered to god a more
[17:29] excellent sacrifice than cain
[17:31] by which he obtained witness that he was
[17:33] righteous god testifying of his gifts
[17:36] and by it he being dead yet speaketh
[17:39] so by faith abel offered unto god a more
[17:42] excellent sacrifice than cain
[17:44] by which he obtained witness that he was
[17:47] righteous
[17:51] amen oh praise be to god
[17:56] by faith what moved him to make the
[17:59] right sacrifice the right offering
[18:01] faith which is a revelation abel
[18:03] received a revelation of what god's
[18:05] requirement was
[18:06] and when he caught the revelation and he
[18:08] produced the right
[18:10] the right offering it was a vindication
[18:14] that he was righteous
[18:18] why was he righteous because he
[18:21] believed god
[18:24] is that right abraham believed god and
[18:27] it was imputed unto
[18:28] him for righteousness right and it's not
[18:30] just for abraham but for all abraham
[18:33] seed that it said it was imputed
[18:34] amen so if you believe god it is imputed
[18:37] unto you for righteousness
[18:38] amen not because of the works the works
[18:40] are only an outcrop
[18:42] of the faith of the belief amen but
[18:44] because abel
[18:45] believed by faith he offered a more
[18:47] excellent sacrifice
[18:49] then cain by which he obtained witness
[18:51] that he was righteous god testifying of
[18:53] his gifts and by it
[18:54] being dead yet speaketh amen
[19:00] but the member said in the invisible
[19:01] union of the bride of christ
[19:03] so was cain the prostitutive son very
[19:05] religious
[19:06] built altars and offered sacrifice and
[19:08] paid his tithes and done everything that
[19:10] any other religious man would do
[19:12] but he failed to keep that word he
[19:15] failed to have the revelation
[19:17] where did cain fail cain didn't fail in
[19:20] his desire to worship god
[19:22] he didn't fail in his works towards god
[19:27] amen brother man said he loved god he
[19:29] meant he wanted to worship god
[19:31] and he worked hard he worked harder than
[19:33] abel i think we could say
[19:34] he put more effort into his sacrifice
[19:37] and abel did
[19:38] amen but it didn't matter he failed and
[19:41] where he
[19:41] failed was the realm of faith because he
[19:44] did not have a revelation of the word
[19:48] and abel's revelation of the word amen
[19:51] when he caught the revelation and
[19:53] offered the sacrifice amen
[19:55] it proved he was righteous
[19:59] but when cain could not catch the
[20:01] revelation it was an
[20:02] indication that he was not righteous
[20:06] it wasn't based on works it was based on
[20:10] faith
[20:13] and the revelation is the only thing the
[20:15] revelation of the word
[20:16] what what is a revelation jesus said
[20:19] upon this rock i'll build my church and
[20:21] the gates of hell can't prevail against
[20:23] it
[20:23] faith is a revelation because faith has
[20:26] been revealed to you
[20:27] able by faith offered by revelation
[20:30] faith
[20:31] offered to god a more excellent
[20:32] sacrifice than that of cain
[20:35] and the message works is faith expressed
[20:37] now faith is a revelation from god
[20:40] now faith is a revelation there's where
[20:42] i want to stay
[20:43] there just a moment it's a revelation he
[20:46] has revealed it to you
[20:48] by his grace it's nothing you did you
[20:50] didn't work yourself up into faith
[20:52] you never have faith it's given to you
[20:54] by the grace of god
[20:56] and god reveals it to you therefore
[20:58] faith is a revelation
[21:00] and the whole church of god is built
[21:02] upon the revelation
[21:04] now all these quotes i'm going to you
[21:06] are coming out in 1965
[21:08] amen and most of them are at the end of
[21:10] brother branham's ministry because he's
[21:11] catching he's laying down the fact amen
[21:14] that it's
[21:14] faith in the word of god amen that is
[21:18] proving
[21:18] the royal seed of abraham because the
[21:21] royal seed of abraham
[21:22] could always catch the word of god
[21:25] [Applause]
[21:26] now i want to give a definition to you
[21:28] let me switch over here to another spot
[21:32] in the message
[21:36] the god of this evil age brother brennan
[21:38] makes this
[21:39] statement it's an amazing statement he
[21:42] said in god
[21:43] is the word right
[21:47] and that's not that's not hard for us to
[21:49] believe god is the word amen god is the
[21:51] word
[21:52] but then he may then he's going to
[21:54] define what the word is
[21:56] that's what i like about this quote said
[21:59] for god is the word
[22:00] in the word is the word manifest for the
[22:04] hour and the day.
[22:07] now you realize he just made it he just
[22:09] made that crystal clear
[22:11] god is the word and the word is the word
[22:14] manifest for the hour and the day
[22:17] amen so in order to be in the word you
[22:20] must be in the word that is manifest for
[22:22] the hour and day
[22:24] and the word that is manifest for the
[22:26] hour and day is
[22:27] god and if we want to worship god
[22:31] amen we have to worship him in spirit
[22:33] and in truth
[22:34] by revelation based off the revelation
[22:37] the manifestation of that word
[22:39] for the hour and the day
[22:42] that's why you can be preaching the
[22:44] bible and not preach the word
[22:46] [Applause]
[22:51] you have to have a revelation and you
[22:52] have to know what day you're in and what
[22:54] hour it is
[22:55] and you have to preach the word and
[22:56] manifest in this day and hour
[22:58] amen when when the pharisees were
[23:00] preaching they were preaching the bible
[23:02] but they were not preaching the word
[23:06] john the baptist was preaching the bible
[23:08] and preaching the word amen
[23:10] he was preaching the word which came
[23:11] from the scriptures
[23:13] but he knew the manifestation of the
[23:16] hour in the day that he was in
[23:18] so john was preaching the word the
[23:20] pharisees were preaching the bible
[23:22] [Applause]
[23:26] that's why amen you can just stick with
[23:29] the scriptures
[23:30] and lead people astray
[23:31] [Applause]
[23:33] you just go verse by verse word by word
[23:36] amen you can preach what all the
[23:37] pharisees agree is true
[23:39] and a common belief amen and lead people
[23:42] astray
[23:42] that's what the pharisees were doing
[23:45] [Applause]
[23:46] but to preach the word is different to
[23:49] preach the word
[23:51] you have to catch that scripture that is
[23:53] being manifest in the day and hour which
[23:55] you're alive
[23:56] and that is preaching the word
[23:59] [Music]
[24:01] amen so brother brahm tells us
[24:04] god is the word and the word is the word
[24:05] that is manifest for the day and hour
[24:07] that you're living
[24:09] praise be to god
[24:13] it's exciting friends why is it exciting
[24:17] because that's the substance i have in
[24:18] my heart and that's the evidence i've
[24:20] got of the unseen world that's already
[24:21] mine
[24:22] that's why you can shout amen it's
[24:23] because you've got the substance and
[24:24] you've got the evidence
[24:26] and what's coming through is just
[24:27] striking that substance and striking
[24:29] that evidence and you know it's right
[24:31] you know that's the truth
[24:35] amen that's why they say i just want to
[24:38] preach the bible
[24:39] that's fine there's nothing wrong with
[24:40] preaching the bible but make sure you
[24:42] preach the word
[24:45] amen make sure it's the word
[24:49] you can amen you can do all kinds of
[24:52] things with the bible
[24:54] and come up with all kinds of funny
[24:55] ideas and wrong impressions
[24:57] and you can be preaching somebody
[24:59] completely in the wrong age and in the
[25:00] wrong dispensation
[25:02] with the bible but to preach the truth
[25:04] is to preach the word
[25:06] [Applause]
[25:07] praise be to god
[25:14] in the god of this evil age 1965
[25:17] and notice cain he didn't want no blood
[25:19] sacrifice
[25:20] he came down and offered the fruit or
[25:22] the fields of beauty upon his altar
[25:24] very religious then everything just
[25:26] exactly like abel done
[25:28] offered a sacrifice fell down before god
[25:31] in worship obedient in
[25:32] every way but without the revelation of
[25:35] the word
[25:40] oh i hope we can catch this cain was
[25:43] super religious
[25:44] [Applause]
[25:47] cain was working his religion
[25:54] cain if we could put it in modern terms
[25:56] cain was at every service
[25:58] [Applause]
[25:59] [Music]
[26:00] he was amen he was in obedience
[26:05] that's what brother bram says he said
[26:08] he was obedient in every way
[26:12] but without the revelation of the word
[26:15] there's going to come a separation
[26:17] through cain and abel
[26:18] amen and the separation always comes the
[26:21] same way
[26:22] god never come down amen and just said
[26:25] you're
[26:26] you're the good one you're the bad one
[26:28] no sir now he didn't do with esau and
[26:30] jacob he didn't do it with cain and abel
[26:32] amen he didn't do it with jesus and
[26:34] judas amen god
[26:35] knew who was who from before the
[26:37] foundation of the world
[26:38] but he's going to bring a revelation of
[26:41] his word
[26:42] and a revelation of his word is going to
[26:44] separate out the two seed lines
[26:47] because the true seed can catch the
[26:49] revelation of the word
[26:50] and the false seed cannot
[26:54] and so always it's the revelation of the
[26:56] word that brings separation
[27:00] amen it's not anybody deciding you're in
[27:02] your own remember
[27:03] the wheat pulls away from nobody
[27:07] the wheat doesn't go anywhere the
[27:08] wheat's always here
[27:10] amen everybody's welcome everybody's
[27:12] accepted remember the bride says
[27:14] revelation 22 17 the spirit and the
[27:16] bride say
[27:17] come they don't say go
[27:20] amen the bride is not separating by her
[27:23] own reasoning by her own thinking
[27:25] amen she's not got the ministry of
[27:27] separating amen she's got the ministry
[27:29] of reconciliation
[27:30] [Applause]
[27:32] and she's saying come come to the word
[27:34] come to the fountain
[27:36] come and drink amen but it's the
[27:38] revelation of the word that's bringing
[27:40] the separation
[27:48] let's read this again very religious
[27:50] done everything just exactly like
[27:52] abel done offered a sacrifice
[27:55] fell down before god in worship obedient
[27:58] in every way
[28:00] but without the revelation of the word
[28:03] and the word was from the beginning
[28:05] god's plan
[28:08] oh praise god this is so good friends
[28:13] the word was from the beginning god's
[28:15] plan
[28:16] what bible was able reading
[28:24] amen the word was god's plan from the
[28:27] beginning
[28:29] even when it wasn't written yet
[28:33] it was a revelation of the word
[28:36] even before it was written what bible
[28:40] was abraham reading but abraham was
[28:45] declared righteous because he believed
[28:46] the word
[28:48] what word the word god spoke to him that
[28:51] was revealed to him
[28:52] and the hour that he was alive
[28:56] amen
[29:00] and the word was from the beginning
[29:02] god's plan
[29:03] but god revealed by revelation the very
[29:06] thing that he vindicated and punctuated
[29:08] that that was right so god revealed it
[29:10] amen when they did it
[29:12] he punctuated it was right
[29:16] not religion not an altar
[29:19] not belonging to church not making
[29:21] sacrifice
[29:22] not being sincere but by the
[29:26] revelation of the word of god
[29:29] now we should belong to church we should
[29:32] be sincere
[29:33] we should make a sacrifice right those
[29:35] are not evil things amen but cain had
[29:38] all of that but he had no
[29:42] he could not receive revelation on the
[29:44] word
[29:45] and he was the false vine abel
[29:49] amen he may not have done those things
[29:50] as well as cain did them
[29:53] he may not have been as faithful as cain
[29:55] was faithful
[29:56] to all the ordinances but one thing he
[29:58] could do was catch a revelation from god
[30:04] not making a sacrifice not being sincere
[30:07] you're supposed to be sincere
[30:10] but sincerity alone won't do it
[30:13] but by the revelation of the word of god
[30:19] why because faith is the substance of
[30:20] things hope for the evidence of things
[30:22] not seen
[30:24] praise be to god 1956
[30:28] father the hour has come all the way
[30:30] back in 56 i want you to hear this quote
[30:32] now watch him when it was a class in
[30:35] then it was class and cain come
[30:37] anointed with satan and made a great big
[30:39] classical thing
[30:40] but now abel when he come he never come
[30:42] in class but he come in revelation
[30:45] the bible said in hebrews 3 that abel by
[30:47] faith offered to god a more excellent
[30:49] sacrifice than cain and the only way he
[30:51] did it was by faith
[30:52] and faith in what the word of god
[30:56] because that's the only thing you can
[30:58] have faith in god
[31:00] had revealed to him that it was the
[31:02] blood
[31:03] and cain had a beautiful offering yet
[31:05] not covered in blood
[31:06] and abel didn't have a beautiful
[31:08] offering but it was covered in blood
[31:10] and it was according to the word and god
[31:12] recognized it
[31:13] because it was his word
[31:17] amen you realize it wasn't just the
[31:20] blood
[31:23] amen offering the blood was
[31:26] indication he received the word and when
[31:29] he believed the word he offered the
[31:31] blood
[31:32] it wasn't just the blood it was the
[31:34] revelation of the word
[31:36] and the revelation of the word had him
[31:38] bring a blood sacrifice
[31:40] and god saw that he got the word and he
[31:42] proved he was righteous
[31:44] the blood didn't make him righteous his
[31:46] faith made him righteous
[31:48] and his faith in the word of god made
[31:50] him produce a blood sacrifice
[31:52] [Applause]
[31:55] amen there's no way that you can believe
[31:58] hey there's no way that you can believe
[32:00] this message and not do the word
[32:03] right so it doesn't say i believe i
[32:05] believe but i'm not going to do now when
[32:06] cain believed he did
[32:08] when abraham believed he did amen when
[32:11] when everybody believed they did they
[32:14] obeyed the word they did what the word
[32:16] revealed
[32:16] so there's not there's no way saying i
[32:18] believe the message of the hour but we
[32:20] won't even line up to the message of the
[32:22] hour to what the prophet taught us
[32:23] that doesn't work either but the works
[32:26] are a vindication of the faith
[32:29] but the works lining up will never bring
[32:32] redemption
[32:33] lining up will never declare us
[32:35] righteous only faith will
[32:36] [Applause]
[32:39] that's why brother bram says faith and
[32:40] works as husband and wife they go
[32:42] together
[32:44] amen and it was according to the word
[32:47] and god recognized it because it was his
[32:49] word
[32:50] and today god's not watching the great
[32:52] big church
[32:53] it's built its biggest builder and the
[32:55] choir can sing and
[32:57] or all this other all this and the other
[33:00] or what class of people whether they
[33:01] were well dressed or not well dressed in
[33:03] your church
[33:04] he's not looking for such things as that
[33:06] no not by a million miles he's not
[33:09] he's watching for someone to come the
[33:11] way of the blood
[33:13] revelation
[33:16] hear what he said he's watching for
[33:18] somebody to come the way of the blood
[33:20] revelation and abel by faith
[33:24] he heard the word of god and took god at
[33:26] his word
[33:27] and by faith in the word of god god
[33:30] received him how did god receive him
[33:34] by faith in his word that's the only way
[33:37] god will ever receive
[33:39] anybody is by taking god at his word by
[33:41] revelation that god will keep
[33:44] his word so
[33:48] so now we realize that that cain
[33:51] cain could not receive revelation
[33:56] abel had something cain didn't have
[34:01] but brother ben said they had the same
[34:04] religious instruction
[34:07] they grew up in the same home with the
[34:10] same instruction from mother and father
[34:14] i personally i don't believe that they
[34:16] knew there was anything different they
[34:18] thought
[34:18] they thought adam and eve were mom and
[34:21] dad
[34:22] and they both thought the same thing
[34:25] they grew up as brothers
[34:27] they had the same teaching in the same
[34:29] home the same
[34:30] influences amen they eat the same food
[34:34] they did the same thing all the way
[34:36] through but there was
[34:38] one thing that god was going to use to
[34:40] separate the true and false vine
[34:42] and that was going to be revelation of
[34:43] the word
[34:46] and they heard the same stories over and
[34:48] over again
[34:50] and you know they they heard the story
[34:53] of well you know what the garden used to
[34:55] be like and
[34:55] we were in the garden and now we've been
[34:57] expelled from the garden because we made
[34:59] a mistake
[35:00] and can you imagine amen brother banner
[35:03] said
[35:04] abel got a revelation
[35:07] of serpent seed it wasn't
[35:11] because his mother told him
[35:16] you understand she didn't tell him
[35:19] what did they know we were told not to
[35:20] eat of this tree and we ated that tree
[35:23] and all of this happened and now it's
[35:25] coming time to offer a sacrifice
[35:28] cain knows it's time abel knows his time
[35:32] but something's bothering abel
[35:38] abel doesn't know what god wants
[35:43] cain doesn't care what god wants
[35:46] [Applause]
[35:47] cain is using reasoning to decide what
[35:50] god wants
[35:53] so cain is deciding god would like this
[35:56] kind of worship
[35:57] and but but all cain was doing was
[35:59] saying i like it god will like it
[36:03] cain was offering what he liked he was
[36:06] offering
[36:07] what he thought was beautiful he was
[36:08] offering what he thought was great
[36:13] but he wasn't offering what god wanted
[36:20] abel i mean he abel might have been
[36:23] simple-minded
[36:25] i mean if he matched all the other
[36:27] christians down through the age he was
[36:28] you know he wasn't the intellectual that
[36:30] would have been king
[36:32] but abel just something wouldn't set
[36:34] right in his heart
[36:37] it's coming time to worship god and i
[36:39] want to worship god but
[36:41] what does god want oh that's a good
[36:44] question
[36:46] what does god want you know not what
[36:49] i want to give him but what does god
[36:51] actually want
[36:54] you know there's so much worship in the
[36:56] world today
[36:57] and it's nothing more than the
[36:59] manufacture of a man's mind
[37:01] what he thinks god would want god would
[37:03] like this and god would want this and
[37:05] it's really just what he wants
[37:10] and that's cain worship according to
[37:13] reasoning according to what a man wants
[37:15] to give god
[37:16] amen but abel wanted to give god what
[37:19] god wanted
[37:20] but abel didn't know what god wanted
[37:26] so that means nobody told him what kind
[37:28] of sacrifice to give
[37:32] adam didn't tell him eve didn't tell him
[37:34] nobody told him
[37:37] so i can imagine abel just meditating on
[37:40] that
[37:42] this is just me if you'll give me that
[37:44] liberty
[37:46] just meditating what does god want
[37:49] what should i do and he could see cain i
[37:52] mean
[37:52] cain had to work a long time so it was
[37:54] no mystery what cain was doing cain was
[37:56] really laboring
[37:57] to build a nice altar and hew the stone
[37:59] out and plant the garden and the
[38:01] vegetables and tend to them
[38:02] and keep the flowers and it was obvious
[38:05] cain's working working working working
[38:06] and abel's really not doing anything
[38:12] so i'm sure kane is getting a little
[38:14] puffed up think
[38:18] surely i mean i'm working in april
[38:20] hasn't even started god's gonna
[38:21] love what i'm doing
[38:25] oh friends nothing's changed nothing's
[38:28] changed from the very onslaught of time
[38:30] till now
[38:31] nothing's changed wasn't doing anything
[38:35] and
[38:35] just just sitting there and waiting
[38:38] what are you waiting for i don't know
[38:42] why don't you just plant a garden why
[38:44] don't you just something in me
[38:48] see friends this is our life
[38:52] this is the way we're supposed to live i
[38:55] just don't know
[38:56] i'm uneasy i don't know what god wants
[39:00] i'm waiting what are you waiting for i
[39:02] don't know what i'm waiting for
[39:04] i'm just not sure we'll build an altar
[39:06] plan a garden i just
[39:08] i can't it doesn't feel right to me
[39:14] you see how ridiculous this is to the
[39:16] carnal mind
[39:17] to the intellectual but this is the life
[39:20] that we're supposed to be living friends
[39:22] this is what he's calling us to aim in a
[39:24] life led by revelation by the spirit of
[39:27] god amen
[39:28] god dealing with us not through our mind
[39:30] but through our hearts
[39:33] just don't feel right about it how many
[39:35] times have we pushed past something we
[39:36] weren't comfortable with because of our
[39:38] reasoning
[39:40] and then later regretted it how many
[39:42] times did we get a certain feeling a
[39:44] certain notion
[39:44] amen and we overrode it with reasoning
[39:47] and later we realized i missed god
[39:51] i gotta let reasoning fall away and say
[39:54] god just lead me by your spirit
[39:58] i can imagine cain or abel
[40:01] going back to mom and dad
[40:05] tell me that story again
[40:09] tell me that story again and he gets the
[40:11] same story he already got
[40:14] because the words in the bible are never
[40:16] changing
[40:18] the ink blot on paper is not changing
[40:22] so he's going back and he's hearing the
[40:24] same story and he may ask a question
[40:27] well what about this and and all of a
[40:29] sudden cain hears the story again
[40:31] and he's just not something in him it's
[40:33] just something
[40:34] there's something there you ever felt
[40:35] like there's just something there at
[40:37] your fingertips you just can't wrap your
[40:38] hand around it
[40:40] something god wants something god's
[40:42] moving in my heart there's something in
[40:44] the word i just can't seem
[40:45] to get it amen mabel may have been in
[40:48] one of those spots
[40:50] tell me the story again and okay donated
[40:52] this tree and we ated this tree and
[40:55] daddy to this tree and and you made
[40:58] aprons of fig leaves
[41:00] yes
[41:03] and you hid from god god came to you and
[41:07] then there was a judgment
[41:11] and the serpent was judged to crawl on
[41:14] his belly
[41:18] we were cast out of the garden
[41:22] and shortly after that cain came and i
[41:25] came
[41:33] abel's just going huh
[41:38] cain's like what's the big deal we've
[41:39] heard that 100 times
[41:41] just plant a garden hue out some stone
[41:43] come on it's time to worship
[41:50] kane got just enough of the story
[41:54] amen to just move forward i mean it
[41:56] didn't mean anything to him it was a
[41:57] story
[41:59] might as well made flannel graphs out of
[42:00] it and taught it to the kids
[42:02] it was just a story nothing more
[42:05] faith value you know what cain would do
[42:09] amen cain
[42:12] would only believe the literal
[42:15] interpretation of the words
[42:20] [Music]
[42:22] and cain would only take it at face
[42:24] value
[42:28] there's a lot of canes around
[42:33] but abel started thinking and meditating
[42:36] and i can imagine one day
[42:38] amen god in his sovereign grace he
[42:41] quickens the revelation to him and all
[42:43] of a sudden abel's like
[42:46] i got it don't eat the tree
[42:50] the serpent was the serpent was like us
[42:56] you fell made fig leaves cast out of the
[43:00] garden
[43:00] and we came i got it
[43:05] and what did god do what did god do and
[43:08] he runs back
[43:09] mom mom dad tell me that story again
[43:11] okay yeah i got that
[43:12] i got that buttercup what happened after
[43:14] god pronounced judgment
[43:18] well he took a lamb and he slayed it and
[43:20] he killed it he made us a covering
[43:21] i got it now i know what god wants now i
[43:25] know why
[43:26] now i know why he killed a lamb now i
[43:28] know why he shed blood
[43:29] now i know why he covered your body now
[43:31] i know what god wants
[43:34] what did abel have to do in order to get
[43:36] this revelation abel had to read
[43:38] between the lines
[43:42] abel had to catch the mysterious part of
[43:45] the story
[43:46] he had to catch the mystery that was
[43:48] laying between the details
[43:50] and when he caught the mystery laying
[43:52] between the details
[43:54] all of a sudden he caught i understand
[43:56] why we're here
[43:57] i know why we're out of the garden i
[43:59] know why god slayed a lamb
[44:01] and i know what is the acceptable path
[44:03] to god
[44:04] [Applause]
[44:05] and when abel caught that revelation by
[44:08] faith
[44:09] it proved that according to the book of
[44:11] hebrews he
[44:12] was righteous
[44:14] [Applause]
[44:17] what's the difference between the
[44:18] righteous of the unrighteous line the
[44:19] ability to receive
[44:21] revelation on the word of god
[44:26] you see friends abel's now abel's
[44:30] offering vindicated his face
[44:36] and then god vindicated his offering
[44:39] and backed it up and it all proved that
[44:42] abel was righteous see for us
[44:45] it's revelation not by church attendance
[44:50] not by being a good boy or being a good
[44:52] girl or doing everything right
[44:54] that's not it it's by revelation
[44:57] the thing has been revealed to us we
[44:59] know amen we know what the word is
[45:01] for this day and hour not for another
[45:04] day and hour
[45:05] for this day and hour we have caught the
[45:08] revelation of the word
[45:09] we know who is here we know what this is
[45:13] all about
[45:13] we know who the bride is amen we know
[45:16] what the bride is failing
[45:20] by revelation not by education by
[45:22] revelation and when the revelation
[45:24] comes and strikes the heart all of a
[45:26] sudden i get it i understand
[45:29] i know why the seals had to be opened i
[45:31] know all of these things
[45:32] why because he's revealed it to me
[45:36] we read the same story over and over and
[45:40] over again
[45:40] just like cain and abel got the same
[45:42] story over and over
[45:44] and over again but there's one time amen
[45:47] all of a sudden it wasn't just the story
[45:50] anymore
[45:51] it wasn't just the details anymore all
[45:53] of a sudden we realized
[45:55] what this whole bible is all about and
[45:57] why i'm on this earth
[45:59] and where i came from and where i'm
[46:01] going and what he's doing
[46:03] now
[46:05] [Applause]
[46:07] in the revelation amen
[46:10] produces from out from the faith
[46:14] comes the works
[46:18] and it's a clear indication of what we
[46:21] believe
[46:23] and proves that we are righteous
[46:28] let's go to hebrews 11 back to hebrews
[46:30] 11
[46:33] and verse 6. hebrews 11 and 6
[46:38] but without faith it is impossible to
[46:40] please him
[46:42] for he that cometh to god must believe
[46:44] that he is
[46:45] that he is a rewarder of them that
[46:47] diligently seek him
[46:49] without faith it is impossible
[46:53] to please him all the correct
[46:57] works in the world without faith will
[47:01] not please him
[47:04] let's just put it this way
[47:07] by intellectual understanding
[47:09] recognizing the message is true
[47:10] and reading all the message books and
[47:13] coming to church all the time
[47:16] will not please him
[47:21] it won't please him faith
[47:24] will please you
[47:27] not just doing a set of works because we
[47:30] mentally acknowledge it's probably right
[47:31] or we were taught to do this as a child
[47:33] or
[47:33] this is what we've always done or these
[47:35] are a wonderful group of people i'll go
[47:36] along with them
[47:37] that won't work it's got to be an
[47:40] individual revelation by faith and faith
[47:43] proves that you're righteous
[47:46] so without faith it is impossible to
[47:50] please him so the works won't do it the
[47:53] church attendants won't do it
[47:55] but we should attend church we should do
[47:58] good works
[47:58] we're not against any of those but get a
[48:00] revelation
[48:03] that's the thing that pleases god
[48:06] he says and i'm going to just go back
[48:08] let's go back to
[48:10] back to verse 1. hebrews 11 and 1.
[48:13] i'd like to add this now faith is the
[48:16] substance of things hoped for the
[48:18] evidence of things not seen
[48:20] that's that's become even a better
[48:22] scripture for me than it was before i
[48:23] liked it better before
[48:24] i mean i liked it good before it's the
[48:27] evidence of things not seen
[48:28] for by it the elders obtained a good
[48:30] report through faith we understand that
[48:32] the worlds were framed by the word of
[48:34] god
[48:35] so that the things which are seen were
[48:37] not made of the things which do appear
[48:41] brother branham picks up this verse and
[48:42] he says see
[48:44] god spoke
[48:47] and he had to believe his own word
[48:55] i'll make this statement i hope you
[48:56] follow my thinking and don't think i'm
[48:58] saying
[48:58] anything wrong but
[49:02] it wasn't just the spoken word that
[49:04] created everything
[49:08] it was god's faith in that spoken word
[49:10] that created everything
[49:14] because the scripture said through faith
[49:16] we understand the world's refrained by
[49:18] the word of god
[49:20] god spoke but then he had to believe his
[49:23] own word
[49:24] and it came to pass now see god
[49:28] amen was demonstrating for us what his
[49:30] children would do
[49:32] because if that's what the father does
[49:33] that's what the children should do
[49:36] and i want to say it this way brother
[49:39] branham manifesting the third pull
[49:41] speaking squirrels into existence isn't
[49:44] what
[49:44] brought squirrels into existence it's
[49:47] his faith in what he spoke
[49:51] because if he didn't believe it there'd
[49:53] be no squirrels
[49:57] that's why so many times amen we use
[49:59] prayer
[50:00] almost like a prayer book or we pray and
[50:03] it's almost like we're reading prayers
[50:04] out of a prayer book or
[50:06] our magic spell book that if we say
[50:08] these certain words
[50:09] and you can say all the words you want
[50:10] you can pray the most beautiful prayer
[50:12] but if you don't believe what you're
[50:13] saying you will not get what you're
[50:15] asking for
[50:17] there's a lot of beautiful prayers and
[50:19] it's almost like there's merit and a
[50:20] beautiful prayer
[50:21] there's no merit in a beautiful prayer
[50:24] it's not
[50:24] the words that are making a difference
[50:26] it's faith in the words
[50:28] it's faith in what we're saying faith in
[50:30] what we're asking for believing that
[50:32] god's going to give it to us because his
[50:34] word says so
[50:35] and it's faith that apprehends the
[50:37] promise not the prayer
[50:40] the prayer is an expression of our faith
[50:45] but you can have a prayer without faith
[50:48] and that prayer will produce nothing
[50:52] but a prayer that's an expression of
[50:55] faith will apprehend the promise
[50:57] because everything is apprehended by
[50:59] faith
[51:00] everything in the kingdom of god is
[51:02] apprehended by faith
[51:04] i mean how many times did jesus say be
[51:06] it unto you according to thy
[51:08] faith as thou has believed so
[51:11] let it be you know it's always by your
[51:13] faith by your faith by your faith
[51:15] he goes into a village and he heals all
[51:18] the sick and afflicted and lame and hall
[51:21] all that they brought to them he healed
[51:23] he goes to capernaum
[51:24] and he could not do their many mighty
[51:26] works because
[51:27] of their unbelief it was the same lord
[51:32] jesus with the same power and the same
[51:34] ability
[51:34] the same hands the same everything the
[51:37] difference was the faith in the heart of
[51:39] the people
[51:41] so it's not saying beautiful prayers
[51:45] amen it's not even saying what the tapes
[51:48] say
[51:51] [Applause]
[51:52] [Music]
[51:54] you were supposed to say what the tapes
[51:55] say
[51:57] but if we don't believe what the tapes
[51:59] are saying what good is saying what the
[52:01] tapes say
[52:04] we say what the tapes say amen in our
[52:07] faith
[52:07] in what we're saying amen brings it to
[52:10] pass
[52:10] [Applause]
[52:12] it's our faith we can say what the tapes
[52:14] say but that's not imputed unto us for
[52:16] righteousness
[52:18] saying what the tapes say there's no
[52:20] imputation of righteousness
[52:23] amen not even doing what the tapes say
[52:26] all right the tapes say you should be in
[52:28] church every time the door is up i'm in
[52:29] church every time the door's open
[52:31] there's no imputation of righteousness
[52:32] for that
[52:36] we understand the scriptures abraham
[52:40] believed
[52:41] god and it was imputed unto him for
[52:44] righteousness
[52:46] by faith are we saved through grace and
[52:47] that none of ourselves is the gift of
[52:49] god not of works lest any men should
[52:50] boast
[52:51] it wasn't the works it was the faith
[52:54] it's not
[52:55] just saying what the tapes say and doing
[52:57] what the tape says
[52:58] because if there's no revelation in the
[53:00] heart on what we're doing no faith it
[53:02] will not
[53:03] impute righteousness unto us
[53:07] amen that's the difference between a
[53:10] genuine revelation and intellectual
[53:12] understanding
[53:14] we can catch an intellectual
[53:15] understanding amen but intellectual
[53:17] understanding is not the substance of
[53:19] things so foreign and not the evidence
[53:20] of things unseen
[53:23] at some point the intellectual can come
[53:25] unraveled
[53:27] but the evidence and the substance will
[53:29] never
[53:30] never get unraveled new information
[53:34] won't change substance and evidence
[53:38] more details more eyewitnesses
[53:41] amen more speculation and more
[53:44] controversy
[53:45] it doesn't matter once you have the
[53:47] substance and evidence
[53:48] nothing outside is going to change
[53:50] anything because the substance and
[53:51] evidence is in here
[53:54] and i have the substance of things so
[53:55] i'm actually holding it i actually
[53:58] have it amen it's not a mist it's not a
[54:00] vapor it's a
[54:01] substance and if we have it it's just as
[54:05] real
[54:05] as real is real amen the faith that i
[54:07] have in my heart
[54:08] is more real than this natural life that
[54:11] i'm living on the earth because i know
[54:13] that this life could be snuffed out at
[54:15] any moment
[54:15] and therefore i fear no more death
[54:17] because the substance that i have in my
[54:19] heart will take me beyond the boundaries
[54:21] of human life
[54:22] and take me to the place where i came
[54:24] from from the eternal
[54:28] you realize faith overcomes every
[54:31] obstacle the scripture says this is the
[54:34] victory that overcometh the world even
[54:37] our
[54:38] faith our works don't do it
[54:41] our mind won't do it amen not no cunning
[54:44] no ability
[54:45] will ever overcome the world what
[54:47] overcomes the world
[54:48] our faith right this is the victory over
[54:51] come with the world
[54:52] if we're being overcome by the world in
[54:54] our personal life
[54:55] it shows there's something in the faith
[54:57] realm that's got to come
[54:59] higher amen because this is the victory
[55:01] that overcometh the world
[55:02] even our faith
[55:06] we've got to believe
[55:08] [Applause]
[55:09] amen revelation comes from god
[55:16] but there's got to be a receiver on the
[55:18] inside
[55:20] there's got to be a predestinated
[55:23] eternal sea gene of god on the inside
[55:26] cain didn't have it abel had it
[55:34] and in the message anointed one's at the
[55:37] end time
[55:39] it says the only way that the one that
[55:41] was receiving
[55:42] could have done anything different from
[55:44] his brother it was revealed to him
[55:47] for the bible said by faith hebrews 11
[55:49] chapter by faith abel offered unto god a
[55:51] more excellent sacrifice than that of
[55:52] cain
[55:53] which god testified that he was
[55:55] righteous
[55:56] jesus said the spiritual revelation of
[55:58] who he was
[56:00] who does man say that i the son of man
[56:02] am he said
[56:03] said peter said thou art the christ the
[56:04] son of the living god blessed out thou
[56:07] art thou simon son of jonas flesh and
[56:09] blood never revealed this to you
[56:11] my father which is in heaven has
[56:12] revealed it upon this rock i'll build my
[56:15] church
[56:15] the true revelation of the word there is
[56:18] the true vine again
[56:20] able by faith what happened when peter
[56:24] made that declaration it proved he was
[56:25] the true vine
[56:27] yeah he would later make a mistake he
[56:30] wouldn't deny the lord
[56:31] he would have to be converted amen but
[56:34] his declaration of faith
[56:35] proved that he was the true vine even
[56:38] though later he acted like he wasn't
[56:43] amen because it wasn't based on his
[56:45] conduct
[56:47] he got this revelation he said there are
[56:49] christ the son of the living god
[56:51] amen the very next thing jesus begins to
[56:53] explain to them how he must go to
[56:55] jerusalem and be
[56:56] evilly treated and persecuted and killed
[56:58] and on the third day raise again
[57:00] and peter said far be it from thee he
[57:02] took him aside and rebuked the lord
[57:05] and he looked at him and says get the
[57:06] behind me satan
[57:11] he just got a revelation of the lord
[57:13] proving that he was the righteous seed
[57:14] of abraham
[57:15] amen and he turns around and the lord
[57:17] says get thee behind me satan
[57:20] amen you see it's not based off conduct
[57:25] based off faith
[57:28] faith will absolutely produce a conduct
[57:32] but it's based off faith
[57:36] in the rapture message he said but to
[57:38] the church the bride the rapture is a
[57:40] revelation to her
[57:42] have you caught the revelation are the
[57:45] rapture cycles on
[57:47] are you being caught up word by word
[57:50] amen
[57:51] if we can't receive revelation
[57:54] guess what there'll be no translation of
[57:57] the body
[57:58] [Music]
[58:00] if we cannot receive revelation there
[58:02] will be no
[58:03] translation of the body because it's a
[58:06] revelation
[58:07] unto her so the group thing was going to
[58:11] fail that day
[58:14] the mental agreement the intellectual
[58:16] acknowledgement
[58:17] it'll all fall down on that day because
[58:20] it's an
[58:21] individual revelation amen
[58:24] that's going to bring about a
[58:25] translation of the body a change in the
[58:27] atoms
[58:30] so credit for church attendance won't
[58:34] work for a body change
[58:37] never cutting your hair won't work for a
[58:39] body change
[58:42] you understand this by revelation it's
[58:43] the only way the body's going to change
[58:45] is the only
[58:46] absolute only way is by revelation
[58:49] we better learn to operate in realms of
[58:51] in revelation
[58:53] we better get comfortable with divine
[58:55] revelation from the father
[58:56] amen and it's not good enough to say
[58:58] well my church believes that don't mean
[59:00] anything
[59:02] don't somebody ask you what you believe
[59:04] don't say my church believes
[59:06] don't say my pastor teaches or my church
[59:09] believes
[59:10] oh my goodness amen that matters for not
[59:13] what do you believe
[59:18] jesus said whom do men say that i am
[59:20] some say are liath some say
[59:21] who do you say that i
[59:25] am right who do you say this is
[59:28] what is this message amen what is this
[59:30] bride coming of christ what is who do
[59:32] you say it is
[59:34] remember judas could go along so far
[59:36] amen judas could
[59:37] amen he could believe in the
[59:39] supernatural amen he could get a part of
[59:41] the ministry
[59:42] amen he could be instructed by jesus
[59:44] christ he could heal the sick
[59:46] amen he could be the money back holder
[59:48] amen and be the treasurer
[59:50] for the ministry he could do
[59:53] everything but when it got up to the end
[59:55] the prophet of god said
[59:57] he just couldn't see that man being gone
[1:00:04] what was the separating point revelation
[1:00:08] when was judas separated out revelation
[1:00:10] he just couldn't see
[1:00:12] that man being god
[1:00:16] [Applause]
[1:00:18] amen judas was religious judas was great
[1:00:21] judas was wonderful amen judas had a
[1:00:24] fantastic ministry
[1:00:25] judas was a fantastic brother
[1:00:30] nobody was suspecting judas was a judas
[1:00:34] i mean the term judas wasn't bad it was
[1:00:36] a good term before
[1:00:39] everybody wanted to be a judas one of
[1:00:42] the twelve
[1:00:43] amen the one god trusted with the money
[1:00:45] bag amen the one with a fantastic
[1:00:48] ministry of healing and deliverance
[1:00:50] amen everybody wanted to be a judas
[1:00:53] when he went out to betray the lord amen
[1:00:56] he had such a relationship with jesus
[1:00:58] christ that when he went out to betray
[1:00:59] the lord
[1:01:00] they assumed that the lord had sent him
[1:01:02] to go buy something some bison
[1:01:03] how much relationship did jesus and
[1:01:06] judas had if that's what the disciples
[1:01:08] assumed was going on
[1:01:15] but judas just could only go so far
[1:01:21] but there come a point to the greatest
[1:01:22] revelation of all
[1:01:25] and he couldn't catch it he just
[1:01:28] couldn't see that man being god
[1:01:33] and he could betray him
[1:01:37] he could later repent but the repentance
[1:01:39] did him no good
[1:01:41] he could try but it didn't do him any
[1:01:43] good
[1:01:44] because he didn't have anything to
[1:01:45] believe with
[1:01:52] i read to you out of the god of this
[1:01:53] evil age brother said god
[1:01:55] is the word
[1:01:59] and the word is the word made manifest
[1:02:03] in this day and hour
[1:02:11] what is the word bride the manifestation
[1:02:14] of this day
[1:02:17] i just put these two quotes together
[1:02:20] let's go through it again yes sir god is
[1:02:24] the word
[1:02:25] the word is the word made manifest in
[1:02:28] this day and hour
[1:02:30] what is the word bride the manifestation
[1:02:33] for this hour
[1:02:40] did you catch it
[1:02:43] there's going to be some who go along
[1:02:44] with church order go along with holiness
[1:02:48] go along with god sent a prophet but
[1:02:50] they won't be able to go
[1:02:52] there when you begin to say my father
[1:02:56] and i
[1:02:57] are one and them other things
[1:03:00] then the shuck begins to pull away there
[1:03:03] was one place judas couldn't go
[1:03:05] judas couldn't look at that man and
[1:03:06] recognize that man was god
[1:03:08] [Applause]
[1:03:12] there's people on the earth that just
[1:03:13] can't believe that the bride is veiling
[1:03:16] the godhead that just can't believe
[1:03:19] behind that flesh
[1:03:20] is god working in this day is the
[1:03:23] manifestation of the godhead is the word
[1:03:25] amen in complete fulfillment of the new
[1:03:27] testament in this body of belief they
[1:03:29] can look at the flesh but they just
[1:03:31] can't go
[1:03:31] there
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:36] amen it's going to require a revelation
[1:03:40] friends and not an understanding
[1:03:42] not a group theology amen not a church
[1:03:44] attendance
[1:03:45] it's going to be more than saying i
[1:03:47] believe the message amen you're going to
[1:03:49] have to recognize what the message
[1:03:50] really is
[1:03:55] praise be to god and that can only be by
[1:03:58] revelation
[1:04:00] because it blows up the intellectual
[1:04:02] mind amen it's not reasonable

[1:04:08] truth of the bible

[1:07:15] that's the way it's always been right
[1:07:17] what has every believer
[1:07:19] in the bible had to believe
[1:07:23] they had to believe the word made
[1:07:25] manifest in their day and hour
[1:07:28] previous manifestations they had to
[1:07:30] believe that too
[1:07:33] but redemption amen was always brought
[1:07:35] about by believing the
[1:07:36] the message for their current day amen
[1:07:39] the word
[1:07:40] made flesh in their day that was the
[1:07:43] requirement amen to be part of the

[1:08:02] creed you promised to live by a coat of
[1:08:04] rules
[1:08:04] but christ the bible he is the word that
[1:08:08] was revealed to you
[1:08:10] and no matter what anybody says what
[1:08:12] takes place it's christ pastor priest
[1:08:14] whatever it might be
[1:08:15] it's christ in you that is the
[1:08:17] revelation that the church was built
[1:08:19] upon
[1:08:21] christ where
[1:08:24] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:08:29] that's the manifestation of the word in
[1:08:30] this hour christ in you
[1:08:32] christ and a many member bride amen the
[1:08:35] god the capstone
[1:08:36] has come down and united in an invisible
[1:08:39] union with the bride
[1:08:40] and he is here he is present now where
[1:08:43] is he
[1:08:44] he's in his bride
[1:08:47] that's the manifestation to reject her
[1:08:49] is to reject him
[1:08:51] to reject that is to reject the word
[1:08:55] because god is the word and the word is
[1:08:58] the word manifest for this day and hour
[1:09:00] what is the man what is the word bride
[1:09:02] the manifestation of this hour
[1:09:06] oh praise be to god to reject that is to
[1:09:09] reject life
[1:09:10] [Applause]
[1:09:11] that is the manifestation that's what
[1:09:13] the message is
[1:09:18] praise be to god
[1:09:26] further in christ is the mystery of god
[1:09:27] revealed and here he is today in the
[1:09:30] same manner by the same pillar of fire
[1:09:31] expressing himself
[1:09:33] vindicating himself the same revealing
[1:09:35] the mystery
[1:09:36] of god that's been hid since the
[1:09:37] foundation of the world see it
[1:09:39] paul only knew him by revelation
[1:09:42] peter knew him by revelation
[1:09:46] peter knew him in the flesh but that
[1:09:48] wasn't good enough
[1:09:50] peter knowing him in the flesh caused
[1:09:52] him to deny the lord and run out and
[1:09:53] have to repent
[1:09:55] but peter had to know him by revelation
[1:09:58] not just by flesh
[1:10:02] he walked with him talked with him
[1:10:03] therefore you can set this word
[1:10:05] now i've just said that he was the word
[1:10:08] now a scholar can sit down and read that
[1:10:10] word till he can just tie your mind up
[1:10:12] anyway see
[1:10:13] if he wants to do it because he's smart
[1:10:15] brilliant get a catholic priest or not
[1:10:17] so much that or a real good trained
[1:10:18] theologian in the bible
[1:10:20] brother a baptist or a presbyterian or
[1:10:22] something he'll make you think you don't
[1:10:24] know nothing see
[1:10:25] when it comes to talk what see because
[1:10:27] that he was
[1:10:28] known him in the flesh the word
[1:10:32] brother brennan pat's his bible he
[1:10:35] didn't say that that was interjected
[1:10:38] and knowing by what they know him by the
[1:10:41] written word
[1:10:44] the only way to know him is by the
[1:10:45] living word
[1:10:49] see they know him in the flesh the word
[1:10:52] but the
[1:10:52] only way you're saved
[1:10:56] is by know him by revelation
[1:11:00] praise be to god amen he says and who is
[1:11:04] this melchizedek
[1:11:05] i said then there's no way for god to
[1:11:08] ever get to you
[1:11:09] somebody said i don't believe in
[1:11:10] revelation he said there's no way for
[1:11:11] god to ever get to you
[1:11:12] because it's hid from the eyes of the
[1:11:14] wise and prude and revealed to babes
[1:11:16] revealed revelation revealed to babes
[1:11:18] such as will accept it learn
[1:11:20] and i said there be no way for god to
[1:11:22] get to you you close yourself
[1:11:23] off from him the whole bible is the
[1:11:26] revelation of god
[1:11:28] the whole church is built upon the
[1:11:30] revelation of god
[1:11:31] there is no other way to know god only
[1:11:33] by revelation
[1:11:35] to whom the son will reveal him
[1:11:36] revelation
[1:11:38] everything is revelation
[1:11:41] got that revelation is everything
[1:11:44] everything is revelation i'd like for
[1:11:47] you to turn to genesis 24 with me
[1:11:53] we all know this so super well but i
[1:11:55] just want to
[1:11:56] i want to read it together and talk
[1:12:00] about this
[1:12:10] genesis 24
[1:12:14] and we'll start at verse 10.
[1:12:18] this is eleazar going out to fetch a
[1:12:21] bride for isaac
[1:12:24] and he says and the servant took ten
[1:12:26] camels of the camels of his master and
[1:12:28] departed for all the goods of his master
[1:12:30] when his hand he arose and went to
[1:12:32] mesopotamia into the city of nehorn
[1:12:35] and he made his camels to kneel down
[1:12:36] without the city by the well of water at
[1:12:39] the time of the evening
[1:12:40] even the time that women go out to draw
[1:12:42] water
[1:12:43] and he said oh lord god of my master
[1:12:45] abraham i pray thee send me good speed
[1:12:47] this day and
[1:12:48] show kindness unto my master abraham
[1:12:51] behold i stand here by the well of water
[1:12:53] and the daughters and men of the city
[1:12:54] come out to draw water
[1:12:56] and let it come to pass that the damsel
[1:12:58] to whom i shall say let down thy picture
[1:13:00] i pray thee that i may drink and she
[1:13:02] shall say drink
[1:13:04] and i will give thy camel's drink also
[1:13:07] let the same be she
[1:13:09] that thou hast appointed for thy servant
[1:13:11] isaac and thereby shall i know that thou
[1:13:13] has showed kindness into my master
[1:13:16] and it came to pass before he had done
[1:13:18] speaking
[1:13:19] that behold rebecca came out who was
[1:13:21] born to bethuel son of milka
[1:13:23] the wife of nehor abraham's brother with
[1:13:26] her picture upon her shoulder
[1:13:28] and the damsel was very fair to look
[1:13:30] upon a virgin neither had any man known
[1:13:32] her
[1:13:32] she went down to the well and filled her
[1:13:34] picture and came up
[1:13:36] and the servant ran to meet her and said
[1:13:38] let me i pray thee drink a little water
[1:13:39] of thy picture
[1:13:41] and she said drink my lord and she
[1:13:42] hastened and let down her picture upon
[1:13:44] her hand and gave him drink
[1:13:46] and when she had done giving him drinks
[1:13:47] she said i will draw water for thy
[1:13:49] camels also
[1:13:50] until they had done drinking and she
[1:13:52] hasted and emptied her picture into the
[1:13:54] trough and ran again into the well to
[1:13:56] draw water
[1:13:57] and drew for all the camels and we know
[1:14:00] this story really well eliezer's been
[1:14:02] sent and brother branham's ministry was
[1:14:04] the type of eliezer eliezer brother man
[1:14:07] was sent to fetch a bride amen for the
[1:14:10] promised son and
[1:14:11] and now he's in the same ministry here
[1:14:13] and he comes to the well
[1:14:15] and he says he begins to pray oh lord
[1:14:18] prosper my journey
[1:14:20] amen and he doesn't know who the woman
[1:14:23] is
[1:14:24] he's got to go get the bride but he
[1:14:26] doesn't know who the bride
[1:14:27] is oh this is good friends
[1:14:31] the prophet of god was sent to fetch a
[1:14:33] bride but i mean there's denominations
[1:14:35] and systems and people ever
[1:14:36] who's the bride how will i identify the
[1:14:39] bride
[1:14:39] how will i know who the bride is and
[1:14:42] this eleazar he's got this problem
[1:14:44] there's probably plenty of virgins
[1:14:45] there's probably plenty of women here
[1:14:47] amen how will i know which is the right
[1:14:50] choice amen
[1:14:51] to which is the chosen bride for isaac
[1:14:54] who do i pick
[1:14:55] how do i find her you realize it's not
[1:14:58] any meanie-minding mode
[1:15:00] it's not intellectual reasoning that's
[1:15:02] going to get it done there's no
[1:15:03] choosing by a man's mind there's no
[1:15:05] saying she's probably it or she's
[1:15:07] probably not
[1:15:08] amen he was going to do something he was
[1:15:10] going to rely on the supernatural to
[1:15:12] provide a bride
[1:15:15] and he began to say not just the one
[1:15:17] that gives me drink but the one to give
[1:15:19] my camel's drink
[1:15:20] amen and when he before he was done
[1:15:22] speaking rebecca began to come
[1:15:25] i want to ask you amen why was rebecca
[1:15:28] walking to the well at that moment
[1:15:32] i don't think they had clocks
[1:15:34] [Music]
[1:15:36] i don't i mean she was probably pretty
[1:15:38] accurate at telling by the sun and the
[1:15:40] certainty i have no idea
[1:15:41] but i doubt she knew at the minute you
[1:15:43] know
[1:15:44] she just went to the well that's what
[1:15:46] she does she goes to the well
[1:15:48] maybe she just felt to go early that day
[1:15:51] or late
[1:15:53] i don't know something moved her
[1:15:57] and she went and moved eleazar
[1:16:00] and eleazar is praying a specific prayer
[1:16:03] i don't know who to pick but let the one
[1:16:08] who can catch revelation
[1:16:13] be the one
[1:16:17] let the one who can catch the unspoken
[1:16:19] part
[1:16:23] the thing that i'm not allowed to say
[1:16:30] let that be the bride your brother ben's
[1:16:32] got just as difficult a job as eliezer
[1:16:35] had he mean he's got to fetch a bride
[1:16:36] amen he's here to call out a bride
[1:16:38] to call her out of the nominational
[1:16:40] systems and call her out
[1:16:42] amen to be prepared to meet the lord
[1:16:44] amen who's it going to be
[1:16:46] how is he going to find them amen all
[1:16:48] he's got to do
[1:16:49] is give out the word amen and the one
[1:16:51] that can catch the unspoken part
[1:16:53] the one that can read between the lines
[1:16:56] the one that can receive
[1:16:57] revelation from heaven amen rebecca may
[1:17:00] not have even known she was receiving
[1:17:02] revelation from heaven
[1:17:07] because god had already
[1:17:10] chosen her and
[1:17:13] inside her is a certain nature
[1:17:18] a certain attribute
[1:17:21] seed of god
[1:17:26] and god is going to move eleazar and
[1:17:29] eliezer is going to
[1:17:30] make a certain request but what he's
[1:17:34] looking for
[1:17:35] is the one with that certain nature
[1:17:40] amen that's not just going to water the
[1:17:42] man because he asked that it'll go
[1:17:44] beyond
[1:17:45] just what he asked and see have eyes to
[1:17:49] see
[1:17:50] oh he's thirsty oh there's camels oh
[1:17:53] what was it it was a perfect setup to
[1:17:55] draw
[1:17:56] the life out of the seed that was
[1:17:58] already there
[1:18:00] so she just began to water she may not
[1:18:02] have known
[1:18:03] it might have just been an impression it
[1:18:05] might have just been a thought in her
[1:18:06] heart
[1:18:06] it might have just been a little prick
[1:18:08] in her heart
[1:18:10] how many times has this happened to us
[1:18:13] we not realize it's the it's god moving
[1:18:16] us supernaturally
[1:18:18] there had to be a supernatural element
[1:18:20] to the choosing of a bride
[1:18:23] and in this day there's a supernatural
[1:18:25] element to the choosing of a bride
[1:18:27] amen you may not have known the moment
[1:18:30] when you realized this was truth
[1:18:31] and then all of a sudden something just
[1:18:33] kept moving you kept moving you and
[1:18:35] there was
[1:18:35] some certain thing on that tape that you
[1:18:37] were just drawn to
[1:18:39] there was something going on that amen
[1:18:42] despite
[1:18:42] your intellectual reasoning despite the
[1:18:44] fear but something inside
[1:18:46] amen i know it was for me it was like
[1:18:49] something that hooked into me and was
[1:18:50] reeling me in against my will
[1:18:54] what was it there was a certain nature
[1:18:56] coming across that tape and there was a
[1:18:58] certain nature in me
[1:18:59] and they were coming together like that
[1:19:01] it was
[1:19:02] irresistible and then it wasn't
[1:19:06] intellectual
[1:19:06] because sometimes your mind is screaming
[1:19:08] no this can't be
[1:19:10] no it can't be like this but something
[1:19:12] your heart is saying
[1:19:13] amen amen
[1:19:18] amen then you come to the preaching of
[1:19:19] the seventh seal and brother branham
[1:19:21] comes up to the preaching of the seven
[1:19:22] seal and he says
[1:19:24] i feel to stop right there
[1:19:28] have the vision of the three polls and
[1:19:30] when he gets to the third poll he says
[1:19:31] now don't say nothing about this one
[1:19:34] when this one starts it'll be a
[1:19:36] total secret
[1:19:39] you explain the others don't explain
[1:19:41] this
[1:19:43] why because this is going to be the
[1:19:45] choosing of the bride
[1:19:47] and there's going to be a supernatural
[1:19:49] element to the choosing of the bride
[1:19:52] it's going to be the one that can catch
[1:19:54] the unspoken part
[1:19:58] it's going to be like abel the one who
[1:20:00] can hear the same story
[1:20:01] read the same scriptures know the same
[1:20:04] details
[1:20:05] but all the sudden in the flash he has a
[1:20:07] completely
[1:20:08] different conclusion
[1:20:11] he knew what cain knew amen all of a
[1:20:13] sudden he had a different conclusion
[1:20:15] than what cain had
[1:20:16] what was that revelation
[1:20:19] why because he had the ability to
[1:20:21] receive
[1:20:25] brother bannon says in god's provided
[1:20:27] way of healing from 1954
[1:20:31] it says now when you receive the
[1:20:32] inspiration that jesus christ died for
[1:20:34] your sickness it's
[1:20:35] the very hour that your healing has come
[1:20:37] that's right
[1:20:38] when you receive from heaven that jesus

[1:21:37] he said when you receive it the
[1:21:38] revelation something slips out of the
[1:21:40] unseen world yonder

[1:21:44] channel somewhere into your soul

[1:22:00] got it then

[1:22:18] to rejoice
[1:22:19] because it's real to you amen it's a
[1:22:22] faith as a substance of things hoped for
[1:22:24] the evidence of things not seen when
[1:22:26] that certain something begins to roll
[1:22:28] from the unseen world and roll down
[1:22:30] through a mystical channel
[1:22:31] and drop into your soul amen and you say
[1:22:34] i see it
[1:22:35] all the rejoicing that should take place
[1:22:37] friends because you realize
[1:22:38] that's the substance that's the evidence
[1:22:41] nothing will change
[1:22:42] that
[1:22:45] it's a revelation of the word it's more
[1:22:48] than an understanding
[1:22:49] it's more than an excellent mental
[1:22:51] exercise
[1:22:52] it didn't come from the preacher it came
[1:22:54] from the unseen world
[1:22:56] [Applause]
[1:22:58] amen then there's still preaching that
[1:23:00] needs to be done
[1:23:01] there's still tapes that need to be
[1:23:02] listened to but it wasn't the tape
[1:23:04] playing that did it it wasn't the
[1:23:06] preaching that did it
[1:23:07] amen that only put a hunger in your
[1:23:09] heart for it that was only an awakening
[1:23:11] amen but
[1:23:12] something had to come from the unseen
[1:23:14] world and tumbled down through a
[1:23:16] mystical channel
[1:23:17] do you believe there's still a mystical
[1:23:19] channel that can drop revelation right
[1:23:21] into your soul
[1:23:23] do you believe that there's a connection
[1:23:24] amen if you've ever had a mystical
[1:23:26] channel
[1:23:27] you still got a mystical channel a
[1:23:29] connection between you and the unseen
[1:23:31] world
[1:23:31] and it's a mystical channel that
[1:23:33] something can drop down
[1:23:35] into your soul and you say i see it
[1:23:38] not into your brain into your soul
[1:23:41] and when it drops down then your eyes
[1:23:43] begin to lighten amen your lip
[1:23:45] hung down begin to curve up to a smile
[1:23:47] you begin to rejoice because
[1:23:49] now you've got the substance you've got
[1:23:52] the evidence
[1:23:52] everything's going to be okay
[1:23:56] that's why for me amen i get so
[1:23:58] discouraged when i find myself
[1:24:00] amen falling back on old habits of
[1:24:02] complaining
[1:24:03] and old habits of feeling sorry for
[1:24:05] myself and old habits of
[1:24:07] saying woe is me my goodness there's
[1:24:09] been something that tumbled out of
[1:24:11] heaven from the unseen world
[1:24:12] and it's come down through a mystical
[1:24:14] channel and dropped into my heart
[1:24:16] and i know who i am i know where i came
[1:24:18] from i know why i'm on earth
[1:24:20] i know where i'm going god forgive me
[1:24:23] forever complaining
[1:24:24] i'm as happy as happy can be in the
[1:24:26] midst of the trial
[1:24:27] in the midst of a jail cell in the midst
[1:24:29] of a sickness
[1:24:30] nothing's going to change that
[1:24:32] revelation and who cares if i'm sick
[1:24:34] every day of my life and die
[1:24:36] nothing will change the fact i'm a son
[1:24:38] of god i'm an eternal creature amen what
[1:24:41] happens to the outside man has no effect
[1:24:44] on what's going on in the inside man
[1:24:46] that's the control tower that's what's
[1:24:48] received revelation
[1:24:49] and now you can't hurt me
[1:24:53] you can't hurt me you can't stop me amen
[1:24:56] you can put me in prison if god wants me
[1:24:58] there i'll stay if he wants me out i'll
[1:25:00] get out
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:02] read the bible a demon of sickness can
[1:25:05] enter in through a weakness in the flesh
[1:25:07] and lodge itself in my body
[1:25:09] and i can begin to get sick in the outer
[1:25:10] man and if god wants me there
[1:25:12] amen to display his character and his
[1:25:14] word i'll stay right there
[1:25:16] but if god doesn't want me there that
[1:25:18] sickness will not stay
[1:25:20] [Applause]
[1:25:21] amen and the outside man now doesn't
[1:25:24] matter anymore to me
[1:25:26] amen this thing's going to burn amen
[1:25:28] it's going to be changed
[1:25:29] it's going to go to a grave whatever's
[1:25:31] going to happen to it now is
[1:25:32] inconsequential
[1:25:34] because something tumbled down out of
[1:25:36] the unseen world through a mystical
[1:25:38] channel
[1:25:38] and logs into my heart and i am so
[1:25:40] satisfied with that revelation
[1:25:42] now it does not matter to me what
[1:25:45] happens to this body
[1:25:47] it belongs to god i'm part of the plan
[1:25:50] i'm part of the program
[1:25:54] you know why we complain so bad amen why
[1:25:57] because we get spiritual amnesia
[1:25:59] and we forget that i'm part of the
[1:26:00] program
[1:26:02] that this vessel is the one he chose
[1:26:05] to be part of the manifestation of the
[1:26:08] word in this day and age
[1:26:11] and that is the revelation of christ in
[1:26:13] this day
[1:26:15] [Applause]
[1:26:16] when we begin to feel depressed and
[1:26:19] melancholy and
[1:26:20] feel sorry for ourselves amen it's
[1:26:23] because spiritual amnesia creeps back in
[1:26:25] and we forgot that i've been born for a
[1:26:28] purpose
[1:26:28] i've been placed on this earth in a
[1:26:30] specific time i have come from god and i
[1:26:32] go to god
[1:26:33] and god is accomplishing something right
[1:26:35] this moment in my life
[1:26:37] i tell your friends that changes all the
[1:26:39] circumstances
[1:26:41] [Applause]
[1:26:42] it's joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:26:46] that's why the apostle paul and silas
[1:26:48] could sing in a prison cell
[1:26:50] because they were in the will of god
[1:26:52] they were working out the plan of god
[1:26:54] and nothing was happening to them
[1:26:56] outside of the program of god
[1:26:58] [Applause]
[1:27:00] oh we need to stay connected to this
[1:27:03] invisible
[1:27:04] channel and man it'll take care of all
[1:27:08] kinds of problems
[1:27:09] problems will come they're meant to come
[1:27:13] amen that word in you has to be on
[1:27:15] display through every kind of situation
[1:27:16] imaginable to man
[1:27:18] you're there's going to be sickness
[1:27:19] there's going to be disasters there's
[1:27:21] going to be financials there's going to
[1:27:22] be
[1:27:23] whatever's going to happen because that
[1:27:24] word in you has to be on display
[1:27:26] through every obstacle and everything
[1:27:28] the devil can throw at it there's got to
[1:27:30] be a proof that the word overcomes
[1:27:35] so now all of a sudden i don't care
[1:27:37] about the obstacle
[1:27:39] amen because now this is something god
[1:27:41] wants to defeat
[1:27:42] through this tabernacle this is
[1:27:46] something god wants to display himself
[1:27:48] mighty amen through this tabernacle he
[1:27:50] wants the word to be displayed through
[1:27:51] this tabernacle
[1:27:52] i've been bought with the price i've got
[1:27:54] my own i belong to him
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:27:58] see revelation changes everything
[1:28:02] it fixes our anxiety it fixes our fear
[1:28:05] it fixes our depression it fixes our
[1:28:08] melancholy attitude amen revelation
[1:28:10] fixes everything
[1:28:15] and you can still get down brother
[1:28:17] benham got down what brought him out
[1:28:19] revelation
[1:28:21] [Applause]
[1:28:23] amen god had to speak to him through the
[1:28:26] channel
[1:28:28] snap him out of it
[1:28:32] we can still get down but god's gonna
[1:28:35] have to speak to that channel snap us
[1:28:36] out of that recognize my life is not
[1:28:40] just a set of circumstances
[1:28:42] that's happening to me my steps are
[1:28:43] ordered of the lord
[1:28:48] hey man how about this morning just open
[1:28:51] yourself up and let something from the
[1:28:53] unseen world
[1:28:54] tumble down through a mystical channel
[1:28:55] and drop into your soul
[1:28:57] and say all is well with me everything
[1:28:59] is fine
[1:29:00] nothing's out of kilter the program's
[1:29:02] moving on and satan's not going to stop
[1:29:04] the program of god in my life
[1:29:06] because by revelation not by
[1:29:08] intellectual stimulation but by
[1:29:10] revelation
[1:29:11] i know i'm part of the program
[1:29:15] where is the word today
[1:29:17] [Applause]
[1:29:20] man it's not the flesh it's the word
[1:29:22] amen inside
[1:29:24] directing the flesh the flesh is only
[1:29:26] reflecting the life that's on the inside
[1:29:28] this ain't it it's got to be changed but
[1:29:31] the real genuine me
[1:29:32] is that attribute from god that's been
[1:29:34] quickened in the soul and it's the
[1:29:36] watchtower controlling this guy
[1:29:41] that's the word made flesh today
[1:29:44] [Applause]
[1:29:47] god is the word and the word is the word
[1:29:49] man manifest in this day and hour
[1:29:52] what is the word bride the manifestation
[1:29:55] of this hour
[1:29:58] you got it right what are we afraid of
[1:30:02] where's the problem i don't see a
[1:30:04] problem
[1:30:06] the revelation took care of the problem
[1:30:09] are bad things happening sure
[1:30:11] bad things are happening will bad things
[1:30:12] happen sure if you consider them bad
[1:30:17] maybe they just look bad but they're
[1:30:19] really good
[1:30:24] amen when they passed the decree that
[1:30:26] daniel couldn't pray anymore
[1:30:28] that looked like a bad thing oh but that
[1:30:30] was a good thing
[1:30:34] it was that very decree that was going
[1:30:36] to eliminate
[1:30:38] all the enemies that daniel had in the
[1:30:40] court of the king
[1:30:44] they had done it to eliminate daniel
[1:30:48] and god had allowed it to eliminate them
[1:30:54] amen praise be to god we should be the
[1:30:56] most secure people that have ever walked
[1:30:58] the face of the earth
[1:30:59] there should be nothing that makes us
[1:31:00] insecure no fear no
[1:31:03] no threats no amen how can you get
[1:31:06] insecure
[1:31:07] i mean you're outside man it feels it
[1:31:08] but you got to bring that subject to the
[1:31:10] inside man and say wait a second buddy
[1:31:12] we're not going to get scared we're not
[1:31:14] going to get nervous amen because i know
[1:31:16] whom i belong to i know whom i'm i
[1:31:19] belong to whose i am
[1:31:24] oh praise me to god
[1:31:27] it's the revelation
[1:31:32] something slips out of the unseen world
[1:31:33] you're under i
[1:31:35] i could say that a thousand times and be
[1:31:38] just as excited
[1:31:40] why because you've experienced it why
[1:31:41] are you so excited because you know what
[1:31:43] that is
[1:31:44] it's happened to you something has just
[1:31:47] hit where did it come from the unseen
[1:31:49] world amen it wasn't really what the
[1:31:51] preacher said
[1:31:52] it was the realization that took place
[1:31:54] in my heart
[1:31:57] something slipped out of the unseen
[1:31:59] world comes rolling down through a
[1:32:00] mystical channel somewhere into your
[1:32:02] soul
[1:32:03] that says now i see it
[1:32:10] amen
[1:32:12] jehovah jiren 1964 he says now we notice
[1:32:15] no matter what the others done how they
[1:32:17] walked away
[1:32:18] these disciples were predestinated they
[1:32:21] were ordained to eternal life
[1:32:23] no they couldn't explain it they
[1:32:26] couldn't explain it no more than the
[1:32:27] rest of them could
[1:32:28] but there was something in them that
[1:32:30] representation in heaven
[1:32:33] oh i like that they had something
[1:32:36] in them that was also representation in
[1:32:39] heaven
[1:32:41] amen they were just as secure as could
[1:32:44] be
[1:32:46] their position was already secure before
[1:32:49] the lord called them out they were
[1:32:52] secure
[1:32:55] eternal security is not hard to believe
[1:32:58] my name was written in the lamb's book
[1:32:59] of life before the foundation of the
[1:33:01] world
[1:33:02] he was the lamb slain from before the
[1:33:03] foundation of the world eternal security
[1:33:05] is not based off my calling eternal
[1:33:07] security
[1:33:08] went way back before my calling before
[1:33:11] jesus
[1:33:12] amen looked at peter and andrew said
[1:33:14] come follow me i'll make these fishers
[1:33:15] of men he's eternal
[1:33:17] his eternal destination was already
[1:33:19] secure
[1:33:21] and when we catch this revelation it
[1:33:22] should take away insecurity
[1:33:29] amen but there was something in them
[1:33:32] that that representation in heaven
[1:33:36] a thought that god had of them before
[1:33:38] the foundation of the world
[1:33:39] had manifested itself here and they were
[1:33:42] connected with god
[1:33:43] and was sure that was god's promise
[1:33:46] vindicated
[1:33:47] promised vindicated and nothing is going
[1:33:49] to change it from them
[1:33:50] that's real genuine christianity
[1:33:56] that's real genuine christianity
[1:34:01] what's real genuine christianity
[1:34:04] something in you that's representation
[1:34:06] in heaven
[1:34:08] and you're linked to god we're in his
[1:34:10] thoughts before the foundation of the
[1:34:12] world
[1:34:13] and that's real genuine christianity
[1:34:17] brother graham says in identification of
[1:34:19] christ in all ages speaking of the
[1:34:21] little woman at the well he says look
[1:34:22] at that little woman see she had fallen
[1:34:24] from god's thoughts
[1:34:26] oh i love that quote she had fallen from
[1:34:29] god's thoughts
[1:34:30] amen if you had fallen from god's
[1:34:32] thoughts guess what you're still
[1:34:33] connected
[1:34:35] you didn't fall too far you're still
[1:34:37] connected
[1:34:39] amen she had fallen from god's thoughts
[1:34:42] she
[1:34:42] could be redeemed she could be redeemed
[1:34:45] she was a subject realize
[1:34:49] she didn't become a subject she was
[1:34:52] already a subject
[1:34:57] i want to say it this way you didn't
[1:35:00] become a child of god
[1:35:03] you didn't become a message believer
[1:35:04] [Applause]
[1:35:07] because believing the message has
[1:35:08] nothing to do with your brain
[1:35:11] you realize your brain will fade away
[1:35:14] this body has to be changed
[1:35:18] you were a message believer before you
[1:35:20] realized you were a message
[1:35:24] because the message is the word is that
[1:35:27] right
[1:35:28] it's the word and you were already the
[1:35:31] word
[1:35:33] and in you was a part of the word
[1:35:37] now when i say in you as a part of the
[1:35:38] word i want to be careful how we
[1:35:40] understand that
[1:35:41] it's not like i have a chunk of
[1:35:44] something
[1:35:44] and i lop off a little block of it and
[1:35:46] now i've got this and this is different
[1:35:48] than that
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:52] brother bam described it this way go to
[1:35:54] the ocean and dip out a dip of ocean
[1:35:56] water
[1:35:57] now everything that's in the ocean is in
[1:36:00] this in a portion
[1:36:02] so we have the very dna of god
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:06] what is the dna spiritual dna what is
[1:36:08] the spiritual dna of god
[1:36:10] the word god is the word
[1:36:14] the whole word and what's in you
[1:36:17] the word but there's a portion of that
[1:36:21] word for us to display in this day
[1:36:25] but that's why it's not hard for us to
[1:36:27] believe the whole word
[1:36:29] it's already in us from before the
[1:36:31] foundation of the world
[1:36:33] it's already there by predestination an
[1:36:36] attribute of god
[1:36:37] amen every cell you got has the same dna
[1:36:42] amen every cell you've got has the same
[1:36:44] dna that makes up your whole body is
[1:36:46] made up by dna
[1:36:47] and all that information is in every
[1:36:50] cell
[1:36:52] praise be to god that's why it's not
[1:36:54] hard to believe the whole word
[1:36:56] because the believing is already inside
[1:37:00] it's already there faith by grace what
[1:37:03] is grace
[1:37:04] predestination his love for his bride
[1:37:07] he's already chosen he's already
[1:37:09] predestinated that seed has already been
[1:37:11] predetermined to come in this time
[1:37:13] its destiny is already secure eternal
[1:37:15] security
[1:37:16] is not a doctrine it's a reality
[1:37:20] and i'm living the reality of eternal
[1:37:22] security you can't make me
[1:37:25] insecure you can try to make my flesh
[1:37:28] insecure but the word will overcome that
[1:37:34] amen let's read this again she had
[1:37:37] fallen from god's thoughts
[1:37:38] she could be redeemed
[1:37:41] why she had to be somewhere to be
[1:37:45] redeemed back
[1:37:48] she could be redeemed she was a subject
[1:37:51] she had representation in heaven
[1:37:53] she turned around look at the difference
[1:37:56] between her and them preachers her
[1:37:58] priests
[1:37:59] them preachers when they saw it they
[1:38:01] said well this man is
[1:38:03] a fortune teller they didn't know the
[1:38:05] word
[1:38:08] they knew the bible
[1:38:11] but the man tells us they could take a
[1:38:13] scroll of the book of bible roll it up
[1:38:15] stick a pen
[1:38:16] and tell you all the letters and the
[1:38:17] words that that pierced
[1:38:20] they knew the bible they didn't know the
[1:38:23] word
[1:38:27] amen oh praise the god praise be to god
[1:38:32] possessing the gate of the enemy after
[1:38:33] the trial 1964
[1:38:35] if the world falls on the the word falls
[1:38:38] on the fertile ground
[1:38:39] like the little woman at the well she
[1:38:41] understood
[1:38:42] she was represented in heaven from
[1:38:44] before the foundation of the world
[1:38:46] when that light struck it she recognized
[1:38:48] it
[1:38:49] when that light struck you why did you
[1:38:51] recognize it because you have
[1:38:52] representation in heaven
[1:38:55] there's a mystical channel between you
[1:38:57] and the unseen world
[1:38:59] to receive revelation it's there friends
[1:39:02] that's where it comes from
[1:39:05] he says and who is this melchizedek then
[1:39:07] after you recognize the very word of god
[1:39:09] was eagle food
[1:39:10] then you left the other thing you have
[1:39:12] then been formed into the living image
[1:39:14] of the living god
[1:39:15] you heard from your theophany if this
[1:39:18] earthly body be dissolved we have one
[1:39:20] waiting
[1:39:22] praise god if you if you kill this one
[1:39:25] it don't matter
[1:39:26] i got another one
[1:39:29] all of this is oh this is just changing
[1:39:31] the outer garment
[1:39:32] amen you destroy this one i got another
[1:39:35] one
[1:39:36] when brother brennan went beyond the
[1:39:37] curtain of time and saw that amen he
[1:39:39] says i'll never fear
[1:39:41] death no more just from stepping from
[1:39:44] one thing to the other
[1:39:49] so what if i go bankrupt
[1:39:54] i not a child of god is god not in
[1:39:57] control anymore
[1:39:59] is he not accomplishing something
[1:40:00] through my life
[1:40:02] praise be to god we gotta let god be god
[1:40:05] and have
[1:40:06] faith have real faith not just
[1:40:09] faith i believe the bible verse this
[1:40:11] this and this now i believe the word
[1:40:15] and the word is on display the word is
[1:40:18] being fleshed out
[1:40:20] through me i believe the word it's more
[1:40:23] than just accepting a bible verse it's
[1:40:25] accepting the reality of that verse made
[1:40:27] flesh
[1:40:27] in me and i believe that word i believe
[1:40:30] that manifestation
[1:40:31] and i believe god's in complete control
[1:40:36] amen brother man says in proving his
[1:40:38] word
[1:40:39] he goes back to this woman at the well
[1:40:41] he said you've told the truth
[1:40:43] because you had five and the one you
[1:40:44] know have is not your husband
[1:40:47] watch something happen see something
[1:40:49] took life now if it hadn't
[1:40:51] been in there to begin with if she
[1:40:53] hadn't had representation from
[1:40:55] predestination
[1:40:56] it never took hold there stood priests
[1:40:59] there
[1:41:00] said this man is bl's above see no
[1:41:02] representation
[1:41:04] eternal life you always was see you have
[1:41:07] eternal life there's only one form of it
[1:41:09] that's god you were his attribute
[1:41:13] he thought of you and knowed you before
[1:41:14] the foundation of the world in his mind
[1:41:16] see
[1:41:16] she looked around what a sinful shape
[1:41:19] she was in
[1:41:20] but see he couldn't he couldn't get that
[1:41:22] priest because the priest was an
[1:41:24] educated scholar
[1:41:25] a theologian in the word but no
[1:41:27] representation in heaven see
[1:41:29] wasn't in god's thinking at all but this
[1:41:32] woman was
[1:41:35] oh friends this is the greatest thing
[1:41:37] that's ever happened to us
[1:41:39] this revelation amen that quickened
[1:41:41] inside of us to where we know
[1:41:42] that we have the substance that evidence
[1:41:44] is the greatest thing that ever happened
[1:41:45] to us
[1:41:46] because we are so secure nothing can
[1:41:48] happen we can be no more lost and god
[1:41:50] can be lost
[1:41:51] [Applause]
[1:41:54] it doesn't make us insecure i mean this
[1:41:56] revelation should bring
[1:41:58] security and the more amen the the
[1:42:01] deeper the revelation the more that
[1:42:03] unlocks
[1:42:03] it should bring a greater security all
[1:42:05] the time a greater security
[1:42:07] amen a foundation that we can stand on
[1:42:10] that all things are well
[1:42:16] this isn't this a future home brother
[1:42:19] branham
[1:42:19] is a little bit hard to follow because
[1:42:21] he's drawing on a diagram on a board i
[1:42:23] wish i had the diagram
[1:42:25] said i'd like to draw that for you just
[1:42:27] a moment now we want to get this
[1:42:29] real clear so now watch close now on
[1:42:31] this teaching
[1:42:33] now this here here is god god which is
[1:42:36] the eternal
[1:42:37] there is no one but him but in god he
[1:42:39] had attributes
[1:42:40] now this here represents the word the
[1:42:42] word of god which was made flesh and
[1:42:44] dwelt among us in the person of jesus
[1:42:46] now this here fellow here we're going to
[1:42:48] make him like this
[1:42:50] now this is called the woman at the well
[1:42:52] this is the priest
[1:42:53] pharisee and where you see this open
[1:42:55] blackboard means grace and salvation now
[1:42:58] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:42:59] word was made flesh and one among us
[1:43:01] the three stages it was attribute first
[1:43:03] was in god
[1:43:04] that he thought of himself as being
[1:43:06] human and that transmitted him down to
[1:43:08] be jesus
[1:43:10] and now if you'll ever be there you was
[1:43:12] with him then
[1:43:14] for there's only one form of eternal
[1:43:16] life and that's god and you had to be a
[1:43:18] part of god at the beginning
[1:43:20] not what you just chose down here he
[1:43:22] chose you
[1:43:24] all the father has given me will come
[1:43:26] now look at this priest here we find
[1:43:28] this
[1:43:28] his bottom part here back life back
[1:43:30] behind him
[1:43:31] his predestination back here is sinful
[1:43:35] here is hell down here now this little
[1:43:38] part in here
[1:43:39] that looks like the blackboard that
[1:43:41] represents his purity
[1:43:42] so brother branham said his back part
[1:43:44] his back life
[1:43:46] his predestination is sinful he didn't
[1:43:49] come from the thoughts of god
[1:43:53] but he said this outer part of him this
[1:43:55] is his purity
[1:43:58] catch this this is wonderful
[1:44:02] this represents his purity he was a
[1:44:04] priest he was an honorable
[1:44:06] man that represented this he was also
[1:44:08] had to be a good man
[1:44:10] or he couldn't be a priest but see how
[1:44:12] he's got it was
[1:44:13] intellectual learning now this little
[1:44:15] woman her first life up here she was a
[1:44:17] prostitute
[1:44:19] she was all marred up but way down in
[1:44:21] here her
[1:44:22] here was just a little bit of
[1:44:23] understanding
[1:44:25] i know when messiah comes see see that
[1:44:28] was there
[1:44:28] notice when jesus come and manifested
[1:44:30] the word because the word discerned the
[1:44:32] thoughts that was in the heart
[1:44:34] as hebrews 4 12 says that he would the
[1:44:36] word was a discerner of the thoughts of
[1:44:38] the heart and he came a son of man the
[1:44:40] prophet what happened
[1:44:41] the priest with only intellectual
[1:44:42] learning said it's a devil
[1:44:44] because that's what his denomination
[1:44:46] called it what did it do
[1:44:47] he had no representation so it blacked
[1:44:50] him out
[1:44:52] but this little woman had nothing to
[1:44:54] present she was filthy and dirty as
[1:44:56] could be
[1:44:58] but notice way down in her she's got
[1:45:01] representations and then she was looking
[1:45:05] for this to be made flesh
[1:45:07] and when he said go get your husband and
[1:45:08] come here said sir i have none
[1:45:10] said you have said the truth because
[1:45:12] you've got five and the one you have now
[1:45:13] is
[1:45:14] not yours you've had five that makes six
[1:45:16] you have she said sir
[1:45:18] not you're not beelzebub i perceive that
[1:45:21] you are a prophet
[1:45:23] now we know that messiah which is called
[1:45:25] christ will come and when he does he'll
[1:45:26] do this
[1:45:27] he said i am he no more doubt you didn't
[1:45:30] have to explain it
[1:45:31] she saw it she believed it away she went
[1:45:34] why
[1:45:35] what did it do to her it redeemed her
[1:45:42] she was redeemed by what faith
[1:45:46] in the present word amen what declared
[1:45:51] abel righteous
[1:45:52] faith in the present word what declared
[1:45:54] abraham righteous
[1:45:55] faith in the present word what declared
[1:45:58] noah righteous faith in the present word
[1:46:00] do you understand where does it come
[1:46:02] from faith in the present word
[1:46:04] we'll redeem back that seed
[1:46:09] he says the priest down deep
[1:46:14] had no representation but on the surface
[1:46:17] he had purity
[1:46:19] that he had gotten through intellectual
[1:46:21] learning
[1:46:22] he lived a holy life but in the back
[1:46:26] life or down in the soul was no
[1:46:27] representation
[1:46:30] over here the outward part of this woman
[1:46:32] was prostitute dirty and filthy
[1:46:36] but down inside she had representation
[1:46:40] by predestination
[1:46:43] so when the present-day truth flashed
[1:46:45] before both of them
[1:46:47] this one said it's beelzebub he was
[1:46:49] blacked out
[1:46:52] she said it's the truth she was redeemed
[1:46:57] what redeemed her faith in the present
[1:47:01] truth
[1:47:03] praise be to god friends do you realize
[1:47:05] how god is separating today he's
[1:47:07] separating by
[1:47:08] the revelation of the word amen he's
[1:47:10] bringing the revelation
[1:47:12] amen he's not done he's continually
[1:47:14] unveiling himself
[1:47:15] amen and those that can catch the
[1:47:17] revelation were in his mind before
[1:47:19] there's a mystical channel that's still
[1:47:21] open friends it's not
[1:47:22] done it didn't stop in 1965 cut the
[1:47:25] mystical channel to the unsafe
[1:47:27] and just believe that amen he's telling
[1:47:29] us what the prophet told us he's showing
[1:47:31] us
[1:47:32] what was already preached
[1:47:36] it's been preached we're not looking for
[1:47:37] a new preacher to come and bring us the
[1:47:39] message we've got the message
[1:47:41] now what is he doing he's taking amen by
[1:47:44] a mystical channel
[1:47:45] amen he's letting stuff drop down and
[1:47:47] roll down
[1:47:48] from the unseen world through a mystical
[1:47:50] channel and drop into our hearts
[1:47:52] and quicken and we say i see it i read
[1:47:55] it 10 times i've read it 100 times
[1:47:57] i've heard the tape dozens of times but
[1:47:59] when something tumbles down from the
[1:48:01] unseen world
[1:48:02] through the mystical channel and drops
[1:48:04] into the soul
[1:48:05] you say i see it
[1:48:07] [Applause]
[1:48:08] didn't you see it when you read it no i
[1:48:11] read it
[1:48:13] well what made you see it i read it and
[1:48:16] then i seen it
[1:48:18] but i thought you already read it yeah
[1:48:19] but i read it and didn't see it
[1:48:21] this time i read it and i saw it
[1:48:24] [Applause]
[1:48:25] what changed not your ability to read
[1:48:31] there was a mystical connection a
[1:48:33] mystical channel
[1:48:35] amen god didn't cut that tie when the
[1:48:37] prophet left
[1:48:39] amen they're still amen there's still
[1:48:42] the word to be fleshed out and the bride
[1:48:46] is going up
[1:48:47] word by word revelation by revelation
[1:48:50] there's still a mystical channel to the
[1:48:52] unseen world why because you've got
[1:48:53] representation there
[1:48:55] and you've got representation here and
[1:48:57] if you have representation there and
[1:48:59] representation here
[1:49:00] there's a channel how do you get the
[1:49:03] channel
[1:49:03] representation here and representation
[1:49:05] there
[1:49:08] hey amen amen has
[1:49:12] has anything ever rolled down from the
[1:49:14] unseen world and lodged into your soul
[1:49:16] and you said i see it you know what that
[1:49:17] means that means you've got
[1:49:18] representation there and here
[1:49:21] and you've got representation there and
[1:49:23] here what's going to harm you
[1:49:26] what's going to happen amen nothing what
[1:49:28] we need to do is keep the channel clear
[1:49:30] keep our mind out of it forget reasoning
[1:49:33] amen and rely
[1:49:34] on this channel to bring a spiritual
[1:49:37] revelation of the word
[1:49:38] and quit trying to figure things out and
[1:49:40] quit trying to take old thinking amen
[1:49:43] but say god
[1:49:43] you there's a representation here and
[1:49:45] there you can reveal this to me
[1:49:49] to the individual
[1:49:52] [Music]
[1:49:53] you realize revelation is to the
[1:49:56] individual
[1:49:57] [Music]
[1:49:58] it's not like we all come to church and
[1:50:00] the preacher's got the channel
[1:50:04] now the preacher should have a channel
[1:50:06] if he doesn't
[1:50:07] let's go find another preacher
[1:50:12] his channel won't do you any good
[1:50:15] his representation his revelation won't
[1:50:18] do you any good
[1:50:20] you have to have your own mystical
[1:50:22] channel that's open
[1:50:25] and unplugged by human reason
[1:50:30] what's holding back the church fear
[1:50:34] where does fear come from reasoning
[1:50:39] what's the greatest thing holding back
[1:50:40] the church today fear
[1:50:45] but if i have representation there and
[1:50:47] here
[1:50:49] what have i got to be afraid of
[1:50:54] fred i won't make it you already made it
[1:51:00] afraid i'll be deceived with a mystical
[1:51:02] channel open between you and god
[1:51:06] you realize let the fear go
[1:51:10] and say god i'm not relying on my
[1:51:11] understanding and i'm not relying on the
[1:51:13] understanding of another man but i
[1:51:14] believe i've got representation there
[1:51:16] and here and there's a channel open
[1:51:18] lord let some more roll out of the
[1:51:20] unseen world and drop into my soul so i
[1:51:22] can see it that i can see it then i can
[1:51:24] have what the
[1:51:25] little woman at the well had she wasn't
[1:51:27] relying on anybody else's story
[1:51:29] she saw it herself
[1:51:33] it wasn't these eyes it was these eyes
[1:51:35] down here
[1:51:37] what did it do it redeemed her
[1:51:43] we're in the same quote
[1:51:46] he said no more i'll read this part
[1:51:48] again no more doubt you didn't have to
[1:51:49] explain it she saw it
[1:51:51] she believed it the way she went why why
[1:51:53] did it what
[1:51:54] what did it do to her it redeemed her
[1:51:56] now watch he came to be a redeemer is
[1:51:58] that right
[1:51:58] what does redeem mean bring back why
[1:52:01] didn't he get the priest
[1:52:02] he never was up there
[1:52:06] he had no representation oh friend i'm
[1:52:09] so excited right now
[1:52:11] amen why because if you've got the same
[1:52:13] revelation the little woman at the well
[1:52:15] god that means you were there with that
[1:52:16] little woman at the well before the
[1:52:18] foundation of the world
[1:52:19] she was my sister in the mind of god
[1:52:21] theirs with the attributes we were
[1:52:23] together
[1:52:27] the thoughts of god are literally
[1:52:30] they're real they're not like our
[1:52:32] thoughts brother benham said
[1:52:34] we were there amen with with fellowship
[1:52:37] before in the mind of god
[1:52:39] amen i can get the same kind of
[1:52:41] revelation she got because i come from
[1:52:43] where she came
[1:52:44] from and guess what i can get the same
[1:52:47] kind of revelation that william branham
[1:52:48] got because i come from the same place
[1:52:52] that revelation wasn't just for a
[1:52:54] prophet that revelation was for the
[1:52:56] bride
[1:52:58] every member of the bride can receive
[1:53:01] spiritual revelation from god
[1:53:03] every member of the bride must receive
[1:53:06] spiritual revelation from god
[1:53:09] it's going to be what you believe
[1:53:12] not what jeremiah's or or what some of
[1:53:15] them say jeremiah and some say alive
[1:53:17] who cares what some of them say
[1:53:20] my church teaches who cares what your
[1:53:22] church teaches
[1:53:26] my pastor says who cares what your
[1:53:27] pastor says
[1:53:32] you know what i mean i'm not saying you
[1:53:34] shouldn't care what your pastor says
[1:53:38] but it's got to be your own personal
[1:53:41] revelation of jesus christ in your day
[1:53:45] you got to know the day you live in you
[1:53:46] got to know who you are you got to know
[1:53:48] who he is
[1:53:48] amen you got to have the message by
[1:53:51] revelation
[1:53:52] yourself
[1:53:56] i hate i hate when you talk to somebody
[1:53:59] says well we believe
[1:54:00] who's we who's the weed that's gonna
[1:54:04] answer for you
[1:54:08] we believe that just makes you feel more
[1:54:11] comfortable
[1:54:12] what that really means is i'm not really
[1:54:14] sure but i'm going with the flow
[1:54:18] i'm not real certain but the common
[1:54:20] thinking around me is this and so i'll
[1:54:21] just repeat what we think
[1:54:25] what we think our church teaches my
[1:54:27] pastor says
[1:54:29] to me that's red flags
[1:54:32] somebody doesn't have a revelation
[1:54:40] this is the way i see it god showed me
[1:54:44] amen amen it's good if we believe the
[1:54:47] same thing
[1:54:48] hopefully we do but it's got to be the
[1:54:52] individual
[1:54:57] what does redeem me bring back why
[1:54:59] didn't he get the priest
[1:55:01] you realize he was there to get his
[1:55:04] subjects
[1:55:06] what's he doing here now get his
[1:55:08] subjects
[1:55:11] he was there to get a subject he had
[1:55:13] needs to go by samaria
[1:55:18] why because there was an eternal
[1:55:20] predestinated seed there that needed
[1:55:21] some light
[1:55:23] had representation here and there but
[1:55:26] the channel had to be opened
[1:55:31] it needs to go by samaria
[1:55:34] she had come from there so she could
[1:55:38] receive the word
[1:55:41] she could be redeemed and when she got
[1:55:44] the revelation and saw it
[1:55:46] she was redeemed
[1:55:49] when you got the revelation and saw it
[1:55:50] you were redeemed
[1:55:53] a redeemed son of god why couldn't he
[1:55:56] get the priest
[1:55:59] why couldn't he get the priest he was
[1:56:02] never
[1:56:02] up there see he had no representation
[1:56:07] he come to redeem that which had fallen
[1:56:09] in the fall this got messed up with this
[1:56:11] with that girl
[1:56:12] but god had her in his thinking before
[1:56:13] the foundation of the world and he come
[1:56:15] to cleanse her
[1:56:17] she had eternal life see where the
[1:56:20] priest what did it do to him
[1:56:21] it sent him right back to his
[1:56:23] destination he had nothing to begin
[1:56:25] only intellectual learning now listen
[1:56:28] friend
[1:56:29] if the only thing you've got is just
[1:56:30] intellectual learning you get something
[1:56:32] different from that
[1:56:33] and you'll never be able to get it
[1:56:34] unless you got representation that's the
[1:56:36] reason i believe you come from the east
[1:56:38] and west north and south
[1:56:39] the word living made manifest
[1:56:43] this priest on the outside had purity by
[1:56:45] intellectual learning
[1:56:46] deep inside nothing
[1:56:50] this girl had impurity on the outside
[1:56:53] but inside she had representation
[1:56:57] she could be redeemed the priest
[1:56:58] couldn't be redeemed
[1:57:01] jesus come along and manifest the word
[1:57:03] for that day
[1:57:05] she connected to it and believed it
[1:57:08] she was redeemed he came to cleanse her
[1:57:11] he didn't
[1:57:11] care i mean i don't want to say it this
[1:57:14] way
[1:57:16] he wasn't withdrawn because of her
[1:57:18] sinful condition
[1:57:20] he didn't hesitate because her
[1:57:22] filthiness neither was he drawn to the
[1:57:25] priest because of his morality
[1:57:28] he was looking for the seed and the only
[1:57:31] way to find the seed
[1:57:32] was to present the word and the seed
[1:57:34] would believe the word
[1:57:36] and when she believed that she was
[1:57:38] redeemed when he rejected it he was
[1:57:39] blacked out
[1:57:41] it's that simple and that still goes on
[1:57:43] today
[1:57:44] every day all around us the same thing
[1:57:47] is happening
[1:57:48] amen because he is here in the form of
[1:57:50] his bride
[1:57:51] he is displaying the word for this day
[1:57:53] amen and the word for this day
[1:57:55] is separating
[1:57:57] [Music]
[1:57:58] there are some with predestination
[1:58:02] brother brahma says in the masterpiece
[1:58:05] so we realize
[1:58:06] that we're here in a negative form and
[1:58:09] as long as there's a negative there has
[1:58:11] to be a positive
[1:58:13] oh i get so excited when i think about
[1:58:16] this
[1:58:19] this life is just a negative there's got
[1:58:22] to be a positive
[1:58:23] there cannot be a negative without a
[1:58:25] positive c because
[1:58:27] it's because of the positive that makes
[1:58:29] the negative
[1:58:31] so which came first the positive or the
[1:58:33] negative
[1:58:38] there had to be a positive to make the
[1:58:41] negative
[1:58:44] so if i'm here in negative form then
[1:58:46] there's a positive form somewhere else
[1:58:48] i have representation
[1:58:55] it's the positive that makes a negative
[1:58:57] like you had a negative picture of some
[1:58:58] object
[1:58:59] there has to be an object somewhere or
[1:59:01] to
[1:59:02] or to strike the light to strike that
[1:59:04] lens or there wouldn't be any negative
[1:59:07] you get what brother bran was trying to
[1:59:09] tell us don't get caught up in
[1:59:11] photography
[1:59:12] that's not the point he's trying to
[1:59:15] explain
[1:59:16] you he's not trying to teach us
[1:59:18] photography
[1:59:21] i mean some of these kids don't even
[1:59:22] know what a negative is
[1:59:26] we were looking through a book at my
[1:59:28] grandma's house the other day and one of
[1:59:30] my kids pulled out a negative said
[1:59:31] what's this
[1:59:33] this is weird they hold up to the light
[1:59:36] i tried to explain it but it didn't make
[1:59:38] any sense
[1:59:41] so we'll do a class on what a negative
[1:59:42] is sorry guys you guys just hang on
[1:59:47] there's before you can ever make a
[1:59:49] negative there has to be an object
[1:59:51] somewhere
[1:59:52] to make the negative brother do you see
[1:59:54] what brother bram's trying to teach us
[1:59:58] you're completely secure you were secure
[2:00:01] before you ever got here
[2:00:03] before your mom and dad ever got married
[2:00:05] before you ever gleam in their eye you
[2:00:06] were completely secure
[2:00:08] you're not going to be lost he's not
[2:00:10] going to lose himself
[2:00:11] you're not going to be a cast away
[2:00:13] you're not going to be falling away
[2:00:14] you're not going to be
[2:00:15] you're not going to miss the rapture you
[2:00:18] realize what he's trying to get us if
[2:00:19] you're here in a negative form and you
[2:00:21] know that to be true
[2:00:22] the negative come there had to be an
[2:00:23] object somewhere for the lens to strike
[2:00:25] to create the negatives
[2:00:29] he's using different ways to try to tell
[2:00:31] us the same way
[2:00:33] it's the same thing like you had a
[2:00:35] negative picture of some object there
[2:00:36] had to be an object somewhere
[2:00:38] to strike the light to strike that lens
[2:00:40] or there would be any negative
[2:00:42] so when we see that our life here is in
[2:00:43] the negative and knowing that we're in
[2:00:45] the image of some life somewhere
[2:00:47] then we know that there is a positive
[2:00:48] somewhere that the light has struck
[2:00:51] and it's reflecting something here on
[2:00:53] earth and we are only that reflection
[2:00:55] the genuine object is somewhere if that
[2:00:58] isn't
[2:00:58] i'm the worst deceived man in the world
[2:01:01] i've spent my life in vain
[2:01:03] but i know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[2:01:05] that it's there
[2:01:06] that's why we're here why are you here
[2:01:10] in a negative form
[2:01:11] because there's a positive form over
[2:01:13] there that you come from
[2:01:15] you're the negative reflection of that
[2:01:17] it's already
[2:01:18] there amen if if this tabernacle be
[2:01:21] dissolved we have one
[2:01:22] already waiting eternal in the heavens
[2:01:29] you know it's not like god is gonna make
[2:01:31] an eternal celestial body for you
[2:01:33] and all of a sudden he's like this ain't
[2:01:35] working out
[2:01:38] this ain't working out he just he's not
[2:01:40] exactly hitting like i thought he would
[2:01:42] hit i must have made some mistakes
[2:01:43] hey scrap that
[2:01:46] destroy it tear it down burn it up throw
[2:01:49] it into it
[2:01:53] come on it ain't going to happen if
[2:01:56] you're hearing the negative
[2:01:57] oh praise god everything's just
[2:02:00] fine and what's he doing with the
[2:02:04] negative
[2:02:04] brother man tells in another place i
[2:02:06] know the quote but he's taking the
[2:02:07] negative
[2:02:08] into the dark room this is the dark room
[2:02:12] this earth is the dark room and he's
[2:02:13] brought us into the dark room for
[2:02:14] development
[2:02:17] because he's wanting to take us from
[2:02:18] negative back to the positive
[2:02:21] image again what is happening in your
[2:02:23] life development
[2:02:25] what are the trials development what are
[2:02:28] what is what is going on development
[2:02:30] what is every service about
[2:02:32] development what is every trial about
[2:02:34] development
[2:02:35] what's he doing he's trying to get us
[2:02:37] back into that image amen that we came
[2:02:40] from
[2:02:40] [Applause]
[2:02:43] listen to this he tells it this way
[2:02:46] birth pains 1965. a little dew drop i
[2:02:50] don't know the formula of it
[2:02:52] but maybe there's a science here see
[2:02:54] don't pay attention to the photography
[2:02:56] don't pay attention to the science get
[2:02:58] the lesson
[2:03:00] what's he trying to say about me
[2:03:06] there may be a science here i'm just
[2:03:08] going to say away
[2:03:09] i think you don't even care if the
[2:03:12] science is right
[2:03:14] the way i think it might be some kind of
[2:03:17] congested group of atmosphere come
[2:03:19] together in a dark night
[2:03:20] and it falls to the earth what's he
[2:03:23] talking about
[2:03:26] you
[2:03:28] congested bit of atmosphere and a dark
[2:03:32] night
[2:03:33] fallen to the earth was it done
[2:03:36] it's changed state
[2:03:39] it was one way and now it's come to the
[2:03:42] earth
[2:03:43] in another form
[2:03:46] do you get that can we follow what the
[2:03:48] prophet's teaching us
[2:03:51] come together in a dark night and it
[2:03:53] falls to the earth and when it does it's
[2:03:55] born in the night
[2:03:59] he's talking about us he doesn't care
[2:04:03] about dew
[2:04:05] this isn't a science lesson he's talking
[2:04:08] about us
[2:04:11] when it does it's born in the night but
[2:04:13] in the morning it's laying there cold
[2:04:14] and shivering on a little blade of grass
[2:04:16] or hanging on your clothes line
[2:04:18] but just let the sun shine out once
[2:04:21] did you notice how happy it gets it just
[2:04:24] glistens and quivers why
[2:04:26] it knows that it's that sunlight it's
[2:04:28] going to draw it back to where it was at
[2:04:30] the beginning
[2:04:32] and so is every man or woman that's born
[2:04:35] of the spirit of god
[2:04:36] there's something about it when the
[2:04:37] light spreads over us that we're happy
[2:04:40] because we know we're going back to
[2:04:42] where we come from from the bosom of god
[2:04:46] can sparkle with joy when the sun hits
[2:04:48] it of course knowing it's going to where
[2:04:50] it came from
[2:04:51] that's why at the rising of the sun amen
[2:04:54] at the preaching of the word when the
[2:04:56] seals were open
[2:04:57] it was the rising of the sun it was
[2:04:59] shalom
[2:05:00] it was good morning and what happened
[2:05:04] the sun came out amen the sun came up on
[2:05:07] a new day
[2:05:08] in all the little atmosphere that had
[2:05:10] been congealed down in the dark and born
[2:05:12] in the night
[2:05:13] into darkness you were born in darkness
[2:05:18] but when the light of the word came out
[2:05:20] to shine all of a sudden the dewdrop
[2:05:22] just starts to quiver and get excited
[2:05:24] hey this is our life this is when you
[2:05:26] come in contact with the word
[2:05:27] this is when the preaching comes forth
[2:05:29] and the power of revelation you just sit
[2:05:31] there and quiver under
[2:05:32] why you know it's this preaching you
[2:05:34] know it's this revelation that's taking
[2:05:37] me back to where i come from
[2:05:38] through the bosom of the father i just
[2:05:41] tremble and glisten and get excited and
[2:05:43] begin to dance around
[2:05:44] just like a little dew drop because i
[2:05:46] know it's this revelation
[2:05:48] it's this light that's shining in this
[2:05:50] hour that is
[2:05:51] changing me back to what i was in the
[2:05:54] beginning
[2:05:54] it's literally changing me
[2:05:59] amen brother branham said we're already
[2:06:02] raptured up
[2:06:03] he said you used to smoke you used to
[2:06:05] drink you're already in the resurrection
[2:06:07] because the life
[2:06:08] is changing this to match the word
[2:06:12] [Applause]
[2:06:13] and that light begins to shine that's
[2:06:15] why you say amen
[2:06:17] that's why you shout that's why you
[2:06:18] can't wait to get to church
[2:06:20] because you know it's this light amen
[2:06:22] when you play a tape
[2:06:23] and you begin to say amen that's the
[2:06:25] truth what's happening
[2:06:26] that is that that little bit of
[2:06:28] atmosphere it's the
[2:06:30] same thing in another form
[2:06:33] [Applause]
[2:06:35] that's the life down on the inside not
[2:06:36] the flesh the life on the inside
[2:06:39] it's not something different it went
[2:06:42] from
[2:06:43] visible invisible to visible
[2:06:46] back to invisible.
[2:06:51] see the journey
[2:06:56] come down and born in a dark night
[2:06:59] that little bit of atmosphere
[2:07:03] from the unseen world
[2:07:07] you couldn't see it before but now you
[2:07:10] see it
[2:07:13] but i want to say shalom little bride
[2:07:18] it is the rising of the sun
[2:07:22] and that word that's been risen in this
[2:07:24] day that's shining brighter than it's
[2:07:26] ever shine
[2:07:27] that's the thing that gets us trembling
[2:07:29] and excited and begin to dance around
[2:07:31] because we know we can feel it happening
[2:07:33] inside of us
[2:07:34] amen all of a sudden the molecules are
[2:07:36] getting excited
[2:07:37] things are beginning to dance about
[2:07:39] spiritually inside of us because we know
[2:07:41] we're going back to where we came from
[2:07:43] and it's the power of this light that is
[2:07:45] taking us back
[2:07:47] that's why the message came that's what
[2:07:50] we're here to do to display
[2:07:51] that we have representation
[2:07:55] there is no fear
[2:07:58] faith is a revelation
[2:08:02] but a revelation is only for a special
[2:08:04] group of people
[2:08:07] the woman at the well she could get it
[2:08:10] rebecca at the well
[2:08:11] she got it what bible did she read
[2:08:18] you see what i'm saying the woman who
[2:08:21] touched the hem of his garment she got
[2:08:22] it
[2:08:24] what scripture did she read
[2:08:27] see she had a channel open she could
[2:08:30] catch a revelation
[2:08:32] she thought within herself if i could
[2:08:35] touch the hymn of his guardian i could
[2:08:38] be made every bit whole
[2:08:41] god wants to lead us by revelation
[2:08:45] god wants to direct us friends
[2:08:49] god doesn't want your mind he wants your
[2:08:52] soul
[2:08:55] god doesn't want to lead us by our minds
[2:08:57] he wants to direct us by that attribute
[2:08:59] on the inside
[2:09:01] he wants us to get comfortable living in
[2:09:04] a world of revelation
[2:09:06] where all of a sudden something from the
[2:09:08] unseen world
[2:09:10] tumbles rolls down through a mystical
[2:09:12] channel
[2:09:16] that just explained my life that quote
[2:09:20] rolled down through a mystical channel
[2:09:23] and dropped in my soul
[2:09:24] and i said i see it
[2:09:28] brother graham said above all pray for
[2:09:30] revelation
[2:09:33] pray for revelation say god above
[2:09:36] everything else
[2:09:37] give me revelation lord i believe i've
[2:09:40] got representation in heaven i've
[2:09:41] experienced too much not to believe it
[2:09:44] i believe by faith the substance that
[2:09:46] you gave me for things hoped for the
[2:09:47] evidence that things not seen i believe
[2:09:49] i have it i've got the channel open
[2:09:51] now god help me to die out to reason and
[2:09:54] die out to my own ideas
[2:09:55] die out to old ways of thinking let me
[2:09:57] lay that down and let me focus on this
[2:10:00] open channel
[2:10:01] to receive from the unseen through a
[2:10:03] mystical channel
[2:10:04] revelation directly from you
[2:10:07] then when next time i read my bible i'll
[2:10:09] be reading along about
[2:10:11] i see it what happened
[2:10:15] it wasn't cause you got bifocals
[2:10:20] something happened that's the way he
[2:10:23] wants us to live
[2:10:25] let fear fade away let anxiety pass off
[2:10:29] the scene
[2:10:31] let the revelation of the word made
[2:10:33] manifest in this hour
[2:10:35] let it bring security to your bride
[2:10:38] say all things are well is everything
[2:10:42] well
[2:10:42] everything's well but you look like
[2:10:45] you're going through a rough time
[2:10:46] perfect all as well
[2:10:50] i'm fine it looks like things are
[2:10:52] falling apart all around you
[2:10:53] it's okay nothing's falling apart in
[2:10:56] here
[2:10:59] there's no damage between the channel

[2:11:16] life
[2:11:17] god as you constantly are trying lord to
[2:11:20] keep your bride's eyes open lord those
[2:11:22] spiritual eyes of understanding
[2:11:24] that they continue to be enlightened
[2:11:25] lord that we would not be caught up in
[2:11:27] laodicea
[2:11:29] that we would not be caught up in the
[2:11:31] natural things all around us what the
[2:11:33] carnal mind can see and what the carnal
[2:11:35] mind can understand
[2:11:37] but we ask lord that you would keep us
[2:11:39] tuned in to your frequency lord
[2:11:41] god i pray right now lord that you would
[2:11:43] take each one of us
[2:11:45] and tune our spiritual dials in you've
[2:11:48] given us a transmitter you've given us
[2:11:50] something to receive the transmission
[2:11:52] lord
[2:11:53] we've got the crystal on the inside that
[2:11:55] can pick it up like the prophet said
[2:11:57] lord i pray that you just dial the dial
[2:11:59] in
[2:12:00] dial it away from reasoning dial it away
[2:12:03] from habit
[2:12:04] dial it away from tradition dial it away
[2:12:07] from
[2:12:07] education lord and dial it right in
[2:12:10] so that that channel that's that you
[2:12:13] you've linked between
[2:12:14] us in the unseen world that it's it's in
[2:12:17] tune lord
[2:12:18] that it's in the right frequency that
[2:12:20] we're in the right channel
[2:12:22] that we can continually get revelation
[2:12:24] from you and we can live a life not of
[2:12:26] reasoning and not of
[2:12:27] mental understanding but we can live a
[2:12:29] life of revelation
[2:12:31] lead your bride by revelation you're
[2:12:33] going to take her out of here by
[2:12:35] revelation
[2:12:36] lord we need to learn to live by
[2:12:37] revelation if we're going to take our
[2:12:39] flight by revelation
[2:12:41] help us o god open our eyes that we
[2:12:43] might see lord
[2:12:45] open our spiritual understanding that we
[2:12:47] might perceive
[2:12:48] all that you're trying to do in this day
[2:12:50] we love you god forgive us lord
[2:12:53] for plugging the channel with things of
[2:12:54] the world

[2:13:18] and we can stay tied into your present
[2:13:21] revelation

[2:13:24] things that you're teaching us

[2:13:35] now lord that's given me such a joy
[2:13:37] is going to take me all the way back to
[2:13:39] where i came from
[2:13:41] i know it lord i know this is a
[2:13:43] temporary
[2:13:44] journey here to manifest your glory here
[2:13:47] to live and flesh out your word
[2:13:48] but i know that this joy that i feel i
[2:13:51] know that this warmth from this light
[2:13:53] is going to take me back home lord god
[2:13:56] i'm so happy
[2:13:58] i pray god that you give us a greater
[2:13:59] revelation
[2:14:01] minute by minute hour by hour lord that
[2:14:03] we might live in this revelation
[2:14:05] take care of your people lord as we part

[2:14:11] drop into our heart let us meditate on
[2:14:13] them day and night

[2:14:30] the love of the lord can we sing winds
[2:14:32] of faith
[2:14:34] i just want to say i love this song
[2:14:38] but there literally are two roads there
[2:14:41] are literally two roads we can work
[2:14:43] walk every day and god has never taken
[2:14:47] away
[2:14:47] free choice and
[2:14:50] all of us know what it's like to take
[2:14:54] the one by side
[2:14:56] and we know what that leads to don't we
[2:14:58] we've had problem
[2:14:59] after problem after problem by taking
[2:15:02] that wrong road
[2:15:03] but when we take the way of faith it's
[2:15:05] never led us astray
[2:15:07] it's never deceived us it's never done
[2:15:09] us wrong
[2:15:11] and i say this morning there's still two
[2:15:14] roads
[2:15:15] there's cain's way and there's abel's
[2:15:18] way
[2:15:19] i say let's take abel's way there's the
[2:15:21] priest way
[2:15:22] and there's the woman at the well let's
[2:15:23] take the woman at the whale's way
[2:15:26] and when there's the way of reasoning or
[2:15:27] is there's the way that little rebecca
[2:15:29] at the well that day she caught
[2:15:32] something that wasn't spoken
[2:15:34] she caught something that wasn't written
[2:15:36] but she caught a message from heaven
[2:15:38] because she had a channel open i said
[2:15:40] god i want that kind of channel open
[2:15:42] that every day i can catch a message
[2:15:44] from you
[2:15:45] that is some say i can have water i'll
[2:15:47] water the camels too
[2:15:49] she may not even understood what was
[2:15:51] happening amen but eliezer knew
[2:15:53] gone through that's the way i want to
[2:15:55] live friends
