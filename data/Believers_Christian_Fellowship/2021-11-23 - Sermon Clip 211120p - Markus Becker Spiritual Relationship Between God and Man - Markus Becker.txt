========================================
if the bride was in adam or eve was in adam and the bride was in christ part of christ really part of christ when god took made eve he took part of adam it's the same substance it's like when when when when when michael angelo had that little statue of moses and was hitting with the hammer brother said that was a true masterpiece because that was calvary and he said and when he was hitting it he was part of his knee was just flew away but you understand the substance of the statue and the statue of that little piece is the same substance [Applause] therefore we were reading what we were reading this morning he calls us brothers because we come from a royal family amen amen so so what happens is if the bride was in christ was in him and christ was melchizedek in theophany form in the old testament that means the bride was in melchizedek [Applause] and if in and and before there was merchandise it was the pillar of fire that means the bride was in that logos and if the logos comes out of god that means the bride was in god [Applause] nobody can preach you out nobody can preach you do you understand this message is not a sect cannot be cannot can because it speaks of the family in heaven it speaks of your theophany it speaks of modern membership and be a nice person here no no i was born to be a bride even if you leave bcf you still are bright or if you come to bcf you are bright [Applause] nobody can preach you out you are not part of a system your joy doesn't come everybody in bcf loves me your joy comes from your father [Applause]
