[0:00] remember when brother bam went to the
[0:02] side of his dying wife amen he he had to
[0:05] struggle through the flood to find his
[0:07] way to a hospital she had been
[0:09] transported and moved and and he found
[0:11] her just as she had passed away she
[0:13] walks up to her and she's already she's
[0:15] already dead hope is already gone and he
[0:17] calls her
[0:21] back you know she died for what we call
[0:26] death but brother Venom calls her back
[0:29] and the first thing she says to him is

[0:35] bringing me back to life no the first
[0:37] thing she says this why did you call me
[0:43] back oh praise God I love these things
[0:47] Amen to me this is becoming the reality
[0:50] more and more in my life I'm not afraid
[0:52] to die death is a release I'm living
[0:55] here to serve God's purpose not for my
[0:57] own pleasure not to soak up all I can
[0:59] out of this life and have fun and run
[1:01] around to amusement parks that's not why
[1:03] I'm here I am here to serve God's
[1:05] purpose but when I escape this life I
[1:08] enter into a greater life amen the real
[1:11] life what I've longed to enter into all
[1:13] my

[1:33] who's nursing a baby an 8-month-old baby

[1:38] husband that she loves dearly amen and
[1:41] when she dies and she goes on beyond the

[2:17] promise she was entering into what was
[2:19] preached and it was more glorious than
[2:21] anything she had ever experienced in
[2:23] this
[2:26] life the final thing she
