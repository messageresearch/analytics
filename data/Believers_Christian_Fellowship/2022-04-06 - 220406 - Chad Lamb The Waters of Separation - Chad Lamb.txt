to you and ask that you would take preeminence this evening in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you all and while we're standing let's take our bibles and we'll turn to the book of revelation chapter one one let you know that we took the vote of confidence for the trustees and sunday school superintendent uh this past sunday at the communion service and the congregation overwhelmingly confirmed these brothers in their offices so we thank god for that and that was a blessing also i talked about the dave wood today and sister bessie wood's surgery went really well i mean everything's going really well and she looks like she'll spend the night there tonight and go home tomorrow but the doctor was really pleased with how everything went said it went very smooth and he expects her to have a quick recovery so thank god so remember our brother jonathan he goes in uh tomorrow to have his foot reconstructed so we're praying that he has a good testimony as well amen so let's all just bind ourselves together in faith and uphold one another amen we have a few visitors i'd like to greet and then brother paul and sister norah jean from new brunswick's here again amen they were able to stay over so praise the lord they were here sunday and they're here wednesday praise god that was wonderful also rebecca simonson there she is god bless you she came for a visit so it's really nice to have her back and mankova has blocked her out for a while but she's back now so thank god for that and also i was told there's a couple from arkansas brother terry and sister pam is that you back there rose god bless you welcome it's good to have you here so yeah you never know who's going to come and visit so you're all very welcome it's a pleasure to have you amen let's look at revelation chapter 1 verse 5 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood amen you can have your seats may the lord bless us as we read his word and bless his word amen i i wanted to take for a subject today uh the waters of separation and i was meditating on this for a little while and i thought i would go another direction but i woke up this morning and i knew we were coming here and so it's been a blessing let's turn to the book of numbers and we'll get our context for this out of the book of numbers numbers chapter 19. we'll start there and if i could teach it as a sunday school get lesson again as we did on sunday and go through this and see how the lord leads but we'll begin with verse one revelation sorry numbers 19 and 1. numbers 19-1 and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which is the which the lord hath commanded saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spot where it is no blemish and upon which never came a yoke and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest and he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times and one shall burn the heifer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her tongue shall he burn and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer now let's skip down to verse 9 and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sin so this is a interesting portion of the scripture here in numbers an interesting commandment that god had given to moses and moses was instructed to take this heifer this perfect heifer to burn slay her and burn her without the camp and there's very specific instructions that he gave to what to do but we know that these ashes were to be kept outside the camp and they were to be kept by a clean man and they were they were for the congregation of the children of israel for a water separation it is a purification for sin and so i just want to look at what the prophet of god says about this because it's interesting where this came up and i came across this in the message thinking man's filter and i actually didn't expect that i was i was looking this up somewhere else and the thought came to me of waters of separation and i came in contact with that phrase that brother branham uses while i was studying something else but i went to go look it came up and brother branham really labored on this and thinking man's filter and as we go along i think we'll find out why actually by the time i got done studying i realized that was thinking this is what thinking man's filter is really about the waters of separation so in 1961 the prophet of god says in the message the basis of fellowship now we noticed that when the heifer was to be killed in the evening time before all the congregation so was christ killed in the evening time now when she was to be killed her body was to be burned with the hooves and all and it was to make a water of separation now we get we get in that over in the book of ephesians where we're washed by the water of the word the waters of separation is the word of god so now there was a water of separation given to them in the old testament that was for purification of sin but now brother brennam's taking and taking the waters of purification moving it over to the new testament into ephesians and now he's saying that that it's the waters of separation which is the word of god now let's look at that in ephesians chapter 5. ephesians chapter 5. and verse 25. ephesians 5 and 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word this is the scripture brother branham's referring to this is the washing of the water by the word this is what he's calling the waters of separation that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish now when we go to the beginning of thinking man's filter in paragraph 23 right in the beginning he goes to two scriptures and i've always enjoyed watching how brother bannon begins a sermon and what scriptures he uses and what scriptures he ties together so here in 1965 this is august 22nd in 1965 he preaches a thinking man's filter and he starts with numbers 9 9. he says we want to read this text through this scripture rather and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and shall lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation watch now for the congregation of the children of israel for a water separation it is a purification for sin notice not to everybody to the congregation of the children israel the waters of separation so it was to separate them out from the world to himself and it was only for the congregation of israel and it was a purification for sin and then he goes and he says now in ephesians the fifth chapter and beginning with the 22nd verse and he goes through and reads just a few more scriptures before where we started and reads all the way through to the bottom where he says that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word so in the beginning of thinking man's filter that message brother benham starts with two scriptures he starts with numbers 19 9 the the waters of separation which is a purification for sin and the ashes of the red heifer and then he ties that to ephesians chapter 5 when jesus will wash his bride wash his church in the water of the word cleansing it with the washing of the water of the word so we know now that the ashes of the red heifer in the and the waters of separation was foreshadowing something that's coming later so god was laying in the old testament a pattern he was laying something to foreshadow something that's coming in the future now back in the message the basis of fellowship the prophet of god says now watch this symbol here now the heifer was to be burnt and with her was to be burnt hyssop cedar scarlet was to be burnt together with the heifer now let's go back to numbers 19 and take a look at this numbers 19. and i'll just begin at verse 2. this is the ordinance of the law which is the lord hath commanded saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spot wearing is no blemish and upon which never came yoke this is super interesting it's very specific and for one they wanted a red heifer red is the color of redemption amen color of blood the color of redemption a heifer is virgin and so once once a cow is bred she becomes a cow amen but when she's young before she's bred and has a calf she's a heifer so it's showing that it must be virgin it must be red there is no spot amen that means it's perfect it's complete there's no sin and without blemish it's perfect so there must be a perfect word amen it must be absolutely perfect and it must be the color of redemption it must not have a spot it must not have a blemish and it must be virgin and then he goes on to say upon which never came a yoke it could never be under the bondage of man this there's got to be a word amen there's got to be a pure word a redemptive word without spot without blemish that has not been manhandled amen this word is so perfect amen the scriptures are so perfect amen that christ has become our sacrifice and this sacrifice brother ben tells us amen is showing christ christ is the fulfillment of this amen and it must be perfect it must be virgin it must be a pure redemption a pure word that has never been under the bondage or the control of man so god has got to provide amen a word of redemption that's perfect amen and never manhandled have we received it in this day praise god and then he says and you shall give her to elias of the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp this sacrifice was slain outside the camp where was christ's lane outside the camp outside the walls of jerusalem outside the religious order and the same thing's true today we're saying outside the camp and one shall slay her before his face an eliezer shall take the take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times and one shall burn the heifer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her tongue shall he burn so this is an absolute complete whole burning when we get the ashes of the heifer there's nothing left out hooves blood everything so the priest will take a portion of the blood go to the tabernacle and sprinkle before the door of the tabernacle seven times amen and brother ben will tell us we'll get to the quote in a minute that that represents the blood of jesus christ for seven church ages amen that as you pass into the tabernacle it's always through the blood there's one door that's christ amen before the door is seven sprinklings of blood amen that represents the blood of christ for seven church ages brings entrance into the tabernacle so everything types christ amen so so then the rest of the blood stays with the sacrifice with the hooves with the dung with everything nothing is removed and it's all burnt so that when it's burnt down when you have the ashes you have all the word amen the whole word the perfect word the virgin word the non-handled by man word complete amen verse 6 and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer brother bam says here now we're back in the message the basis of fellowship the heifer was to be burnt and with her was to burn hyssop and cedar and scarlet was to be burnt together with the heifer now notice cedar is a redwood stained wood white and red together if you've ever split cedar you know that in the middle cedar it's got a streak of red that runs up it and outside is white so it's the red running through the white and this is what he says it's is a redwood stained wood white and red together symbolizing the cross and scarlet as ram's wool died in blood so scarlet is wool died in blood and hyssop was weeds that was put in with it hyssop is what you applied the blood by remember when we talked about the passover hyssop was what they dipped in the blood and they applied the blood on the lentil and the doorpost with hyssop and brother bam told us hyssop is just a common weed amen because it just takes common faith amen not a work up not some super duper just common faith to take god at his word and believe and accept what he said to be true and that's what it takes to apply the blood so in these ashes of the red heifer is the cross the word calvary the lamb the ram the wool dyed red the scarlet and the hyssop to apply it with it's all burnt together oh i love this message sprinkle from the sins with the waters of separation oh you know what when i was a boy growing up in church amen we would read the old testament and all it was was sunday school stories and it was all about giants and swords and battles and and all of this but the prophet of god come and he gave us one word one book tied it all together and said that the old testament was foreshadowing amen the coming of christ and foreshadowed the new testament and so now all of these things represent christ amen all of them represent calvary and redemption and what's been given to us so these ashes of a red heifer are the waters of separation that separate out israel from the world and it's a purification for sin now we come back to thinking man's filter 1965 and then her body was taken and burnt it was burnt with the hoof with the skin with the intestines with the dung everything was burnt together and it had to be picked up by a clean man and had to be put in a clean place outside the congregation therefore if israel could only see the time this word of god must not be handled by dirty hands of unbelief it's got to be a clean man and if he's clean he had to come through god's filter a clean man cleans hands had to be kept in a clean place not a place where jezebels and rickies and everything partake and take communion and things when they're running around with wives and husbands and all kinds of filth going to dances and parties and wearing bobbed hair and shorts and everything else and calling themselves christians is to be kept in a clean place and handled with clean hands so where was that clean place outside the congregation amen and and since the church fell into ruin in the first church age god has kept the word amen it's been sealed it was sealed amen with seven thunders has been kept amen so that it would not be defiled it wasn't going to be kept in a congregation it was going to be defiled with all of these things but there was going to be a clean man with clean hands the clean man with clean hands was going to keep the blood and go to keep the ashes of the red heifer and keep it outside the systems of man keep it free from defilement then he says and then when israel sinned and recognized that they had done wrong then they were sprinkled with the ashes of this heifer upon them they would take and they would mix the ashes of the red heifer with water but they had to get running water they couldn't use stagnant water they couldn't use cistern water they couldn't use water men pulled up or man collected in the previous day and set in a bottle and sat in a can or pulled in a tub amen they had to have moving water living water fresh water and the water represents the word and it represents the spirit amen and whenever they were going to apply the ashes of the red heifer it must be applied with living water they're mixed together and then they become a sprinkling amen for the purification of sin so there's got to be amen a fresh word and a fresh outpouring of the spirit for each age so it couldn't be old water it had to be moving water running water living water and when they sprinkled with the ashes of this heifer upon them and that was the water of separation a purification for sin notice here it is and when israel before they could come into fellowship and in the worship they had to first pass through the waters of separation justification by faith cometh by hearing hearing the word then they entered into the congregation under those seven stripes the blood to show that something died and went before them for their sin they were separated by hearing the word the waters of separation then entered into fellowship the only place that god met a man was behind that order he wouldn't meet him anywhere else he had to come behind that order god only met israel in one place and god only meets you today in one place and that's in jesus christ and he is the word the waters of separation so what is the waters of separation jesus christ the word he's the waters of separation and his blood was shed for all seven church ages further down next paragraph he says also now we want to look at ephesians 5 26 said it's the washing of the water by the word a waters of separation what does it then the filter of god is the word waters of separation washing of the waters of separation by the word god's filter then you can't come into christ through a church filter you cannot come by a denominational filter or a creed filter there is only one filter that you can enter into that holy place that's through the washing of the water by the word the word of god is a thinking man's filter so what is a filter used for a filter is used for purification so if you have a water filter amen a water filter is used to purify the water so if water passes through the filter the filter is there to collect anything that you don't want in the water so if you have a water filtration system at home or any kind of filtration system it's used for purification purification of air purification of water purification of any other uh fluid or whatever you have are filters for purification what was the waters of separation for purification so what is this all about that god has provided something that would purify his people amen and it's a water of separation to separate us from the world god has given us his word amen and we live in a day when it's not partial word partial understanding but it's the full revelation of the full word so there's been a pure filter restored to the people again a waters of separation that has come back to the church where we know that we can be clean it's no longer guessing there's no longer hoping i know i can be clean how can i be clean by surrendering to that word amen by just submitting to it and obeying it amen we make things so complicated sometimes that that i i how do i know i ride i want to be right oh i wish i was right amen the devil can get us on my wish i was right merry-go-round and i hope that i'm right amen but there's one way that we know that we're right it's when we surrender to this word there are things that that that we may not know decisions that we have to make and and we labor over those we want to be in the will of god and we want to do right and we make the decision the best way we know how to make the decision but if we filtered it through the word if there's no word hindering us from stepping right or left we just have to go by the leading of the lord the way we feel is right to go and trust that god will help us if we're wrong but we ought not to have so much anxiety over those things because there's been a water of purification and as long as we're surrendering to the word with all that we know god will take care of the rest where we can be nervous where we should have anxiety and fear is when we know we're not right with the word when we know the prophet of god has taught the scriptures in a way taught the conduct of a believer in a way and we knowingly refuse to walk in them that's where we can be nervous that's where we can have anxiety but if we're doing all that we know to do trust the word to be the filter and trust it to be the waters of separation that's why if we believe this message amen this this word that's been given to us is a water of separation that's why we should not act like look like talk like the rest of the world we should not act like talk like look like the worldly church because it's a water of separation that has separated us out to be a peculiar people unto him and he's washing us by the water of the word so that he can have a church without wrinkle and without blemish that's god is creating for himself a church without wrinkle and without blemish how's he doing it by the revelation of his word and so how am i becoming the the bride that he wants by surrendering to the word and obeying by dropping my ideas by surrendering my will by giving up my whatever i have that's contrary to word if i'll give that up and take that word for my clothing to be my headship to be my lord to be my bridegroom and let him be the boss then i know i'm in the water of separation and i believe that if we're in that water of separation it should be noticeable that we're separated from the world it should be noticeable that we're separated from the worldly church brotherhood was telling us that through this water of separation was the only basis for going into the holy place that we cannot go into the union with christ without passing through the word of separation so there's no there's no claiming that i've been behind the veil if you haven't even passed through the water of separation if we've refused to surrender to the revealed word of the hour we refuse to lay down our ideas and lay down our life but claim we've been behind the veil and become one with christ but it's obvious that we have not if we have refused the water of purification then the only basis for us going in to the holy of holies is to come first through the water of purification so this is important it's a step that ought not to be missed in the message the world is falling apart but the man says heavenly father this is your word and we read in the bible that we are cleansed by the water of the word and we know in the old testament how they took the heifer the red heifer and killed her the whole congregation and she was burnt and when the ashes was kept outside the courts for a water of separation that the hands that handled this must be clean and i pray god as the waters of separation the word that separates us from death to life cleanse our thoughts our hearts lord if there be anything you find in us that's not just right cleanse it lord by this water of separation tonight take our sins away father we want to stand daily before you dying to ourselves that we might live in christ amen so we know that the waters of separation are grounds for entering in it's the basis for entering in but it's also a daily standing before the lord and allowing the water of separation to be purification for our sins to allow the water of the word to wash us from unrighteousness back in the thinking man's filter again he says the thinking man the thinking man's filter is the waters the of the waters of separation it's the purification from sin which is the word of god and the thinking man the man that knows he's got to stand before god knows he's got to answer for every word of the bible it'll satisfy the taste that's in your heart when when i was listening to um this thinking man's filter what always stood out to me was brother banham getting his message off a pack of cigarettes and i couldn't get past that and go back and pick up a pack of cigarettes and take the slogan off a pack of cigarettes and god give him a message of the thinking man's filter and i knew he started to tie it to the word amen but i somehow had missed his very opening scripture amen to tie it all the way back to the waters of separation for purification for sin and it is the basis for moving forward with god it's not just a good idea it's not one of those things it's a good idea to have a thinking man's filter i mean it'll be better if you have a filtration system that's not what this message was taught for it's a requirement amen it's the basis for moving forward the world has to be stripped off ungodliness has to be stripped off anything that's contrary to where it has to be stripped off to move forward with god to move forward into the tabernacle and go behind the veil we've got to pass through the filter of the word the waters of separation for purification from sin so it's not a good idea and then it's an absolute requirement so the message isn't a good idea the things that brother bam teaches those are not good concepts and good ideas they're absolute necessities for approaching god [Music] he says now further in thinking man's filter but a real thinking man that knows his soul is going to judgment will filter his taste through the word of god for all the father has given me will come to me and he'll live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god which is the waters of separation that separates us from sin for when it comes through the word we see that it's sin to disbelieve it so we just believe it and go on it's a separation from sin what is the definition of sin that the prophet gave us sin is unbelief unbelief in what unbelief in god's word so god sent us a word to wash unbelief away so many times we disbelieved because we were mistaught so god brought back the word to be a purification for all the mistaking and misunderstanding and wrong ideas that created unbelief inside of us to god is washing away our unbelief by bringing back the word and it's a purification from sin we are purified from the sin of trinitarian baptism we've been purified how do i get purified by receiving water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ what does that do it purifies me from the sin of unbelief that's left over from denominationalism god has god god has given us a purification we just have to believe it receive it accept it and let it work the work that it's intended to work because the ashes of the red heifer were the waters of separation for purification from sin that means that when the ashes of the red heifer were sprinkled upon the the individual or the vessel was unclean whatever it was sprinkled upon the ashes of the red heifer what made it clean it was cleansed or it was purified by the sprinkling and so we've received a word and if we'll just let that word sprinkle our heart the word is doing the purifying you know i talked about the the purging of of a purification of separation of a filter that separates and if we if we look at this incorrectly we can get the wrong idea we can take a concept of more works that's easy to do especially when you preach a message like this it's not that we have no works because we we have to obey is that right believers obey the word it's a requirement it's not optional it's a requirement in the scriptures that we obey the word but we can look at this as a as a means of greater works and if i do more works and i do more obedient then i become more pure no it's not our effort that creates purity it's the sprinkling of the word amen it's the word that has come back to make us pure and if we'll just stay under the washing of the word it'll wash all of that out it'll change our thinking it'll change our desires it'll change everything and it'll it'll purge us from unbelief and purge us from sin and if the word will do the purging amen it'll bring us into the right kind of life so we can get discouraged amen under this kind of preaching that oh i know i got to do better if you know that you're doing wrong then repent and if you know that you can quit doing this and quit doing it that's your reasonable service but there's so many things that we just are trapped in they meant so many things that we just keep repeating traps we keep repeatedly stepping in and what do i need i need something that will purify all of me i need something that will change my thinking change my habits change the genetics that are in my body and what will change it there is a water of purification that has come this word has come because this word isn't sterile amen it didn't come from a textbook amen this is not print on paper this is the word amen containing the thought so this word brings a life see when when they took the blood of the red heifer and they sprinkled it that was blood sprinkled amen the shedding of blood blood was sprinkled representing the seven church ages representing calvary amen but all that rest of that blood was in the ashes where was the rest of the blood the rest of the blood was in the ashes so when they would take a portion of the ashes and they would mix it with living water living water for their day fresh living water when they would mix it together in there is calvary and there is the word and there is the blood it's all in there it's got the blood which represented the life it's got the full word without blemish without spot it's got the cedar wood representing calvary it's got the rams wool dyed scarlet it's got the hyssop for the application it's all in the ashes so they had a sacrifice for that day to represent seven church ages but they had something that will preserve them through the rest of the journey and it was that ashes of the red heifer that they could get any time that they needed it to mix it with living water and sprinkle it for purification and in that was calvary and that was the blood in that was the word the sacrifice in that was the virgin in that was what was not manhandled it was all in the ashes and god has kept back his word and preserved his word and through seven church ages he'll get a fresh portion of that word and mix it with the living water for that day and sprinkle it upon the people and they'll be clean in that day why were the lutherans clean by accepting the word for their day luther smoked and drank and swore but he was purified what was he purified by what was he cleansed by by the just shall save by faith what was it it was a portion amen of that great sacrifice that was preserved for his day mixed with living water and sprinkled as the word of purification the waters of separation upon that generation and those who could receive that word were justified amen we're considered righteous by receiving that word righteousness was imputed unto them because they believed god oh this is no longer just a funny little part of the book of numbers under the message of the hour it's become living worry so the blood wasn't lost how did they get an application of that blood by going to the ashes of the red heifer and mixing it with the water and when they was applied everything was in that and it was a waters of purification for sin he said and again in thinking man's filter we thank you for the little cut up message tonight lord i didn't do it right but i pray lord that you'll make it right in the people's sight that they might see and know that it was meant for get glory out of it lord and may we have this understanding of nothing else that we are to live by the bread of the word of god filtered from god just for his children only it's separated it's a separated congregation it's for no one else it's only for those you're chosen as the red heifers waters of separation was for the congregation of israel only these this word this word that is going to be the sprinkling of purification in each age this word is only for the elect of that luther's message was only for the elected that day wesley's message was only for the elected that day and it's the waters of separation in the message the invisible union of the bride of christ the prophet says what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word the word become blood how did the word become blood because you go back to john 1 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and then john 1 14 then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us when that word was made flesh amen there was created blood put into that word that fleshed out word amen and that word became our sacrifice and died for us and bled forth so the word bled for us the word died for us so we were washed in the bleeding word and that word amen dropped seven stripes for seven church ages amen but the word was preserved amen and in each age a portion of that word was mixed with the living water for that day and when it was mixed together amen that word amen that word that bled for us that blood was fresh and the fresh outpouring of the word when the word poured out fresh it still contained the blood just like when the ashes of the red heifer were taken for purification of sin it was taken at a later date but then when it was mixed with living water amen and sprinkled over the people it became a purification of sin the sacrifice was still in it the blood was still in it everything was still in it and when god portioned out his word everything was still in it the blood was still there praise be to god so thinking man's filter is really about the ashes of the red heifer and being washed by the water of the word i want to go and finish this quote in invisible union your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you and you're washed in bleeding word the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on god and on his word this is how ephesians 5 works because he's washing us with the water of the word the waters of separation but what's in the word when all the word was in christ that word bled that word was bleeding when it was all in christ so now when that word that bled amen comes back amen in that day that you live in that word contains the blood from calvary in it and when you receive it it's waters of purification for you now it goes on in the message and things that are to be he said oh but the other one is called my father's house i'll go and prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my i'm sorry let me read that again take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house amen there you are take you out of this old earthly pest house he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists so no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists say take me there lord now listen what he says it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there oh you can take you can take two approaches to this you can look in the mirror and say well it was a good idea it was a good concept i really wanted it but when he said you have to be perfect to get there that put me on the sidelines but god cannot make a requirement for you that he doesn't keep himself because when god made a requirement for the shedding of blood he came himself to be the shedding of blood when god makes a requirement when it comes to his bride he'll fulfill the requirement for her so there is a requirement that you have to be perfect to get there but it's going to take the perfect one to come and make you perfect we were trapped into this life it was of no fault of our own it was without even our desire we were stuck into this hybrid condition from the garden of eden and god knows that we were stuck and trapped into this condition amen because we never sinned in the first place whatever i was first place i wasn't a sinner whenever i was in the first place i wasn't hybrid amen i wasn't corrupted i wasn't perverted whatever i was in the first place i believed every word of god and stood upon it in the first place so i never sinned in the first place and god's going to take me back to the first place condition but because i was trapped in this i have no hope of getting there myself no way whatsoever of getting there on my own but it's going to take perfection to get there he says he says you you and you have to be perfect to get there and the bible said so jesus said be there for perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect it's a perfect kingdom so it must be a perfect people oh praise god what a requirement god has so set his system up with requirements and all of these things that only his elect will ever make it it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand to be married to a perfect son of god now that makes perfect sense if you're going to be married to a perfect son of god you must be a perfect bride if you're going to a perfect place you must be perfect to get there everything must be perfect but i was born in perfect i still have this old cockapoo nature on the outside that's sticky what is going to happen to me how is this going to happen praise god there's a water of separation there's a water for purification to make you in this condition perfect to go there he says now now you you because you have to stand and be married to a perfect son of god and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of god which is the waters of separation that washes us from our sins now it is not good conduct that brings us to perfection it's the washing of the water by the word that brings us to perfection so in order for god to have a perfect bride to unite within the end time he had to restore a perfect word the perfect word will produce the perfect bride because there'll be a people on the earth that'll say that's exactly what i want god i surrender i die i take that as my headship take me under your control and the washing of the water of the word amen brings you into that perfect condition amen so that you can be united with this perfect son of god so god in our day has provided the waters of separation is not the day of portion part portion but this is the full word and with the full word comes the full life you cannot separate the word and the life now i'm talking about the true word you cannot separate the true word from the true life you can have words like repeating words and understanding words and reading words but that's not the person of the word the word comes with the life the person of the word so now i want to i'll keep reading here and things that are to be he said so now how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of god which is the waters of separation that washes us from our sins amen that's right the blood of jesus christ think of it the dripping bloody word amen the blood the word of god bleeding blood to wash the bride in amen yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place she was trapped into it praise god i'm just going to accept that as true amen i'm just going to say that's me he's talking about i'm not going to look in the mirror because i look in the mirror i get confused i'm looking into the mirror of the word and saying that's me that is exactly who i am and because that's me trapped in this condition he did something in this day that i could not do for myself that nobody else could do he came amen and brought back the waters of separation that has the blood of purification in it and we're purified by the bleeding word the word that bled for us has come back to us and with the purifying power of the blood which represents the life it's the life that's purifying us in the feast of trumpets brother ben says in revelations 11 calder ministry will be the ministry of moses and elias calling israel out of the jewish traditions just as the seventh angels message called the bride out of the pentecostal tradition so he's going to run a parallel between the message of moses and elijah and the message of the seventh angel and we all know who the seventh angel is so he's running this parallel he said they're to call uh the the 144 000 out of the jewish tradition just like the seventh angel called us out of the pentecostal tradition remember moses elijah is to call israel out of the old atonement of the lamb and sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice to the real living sacrifice the word what is the sacrifice the sacrifice is what frees you from sin the sacrifice is what purchase your redemption the sacrifice is what shed blood for you he's going to bring them from the old order to the real living sacrifice to the word he said well i thought he would bring him to christ it's the same thing amen well he says he's going to bring him to the real living sacrifice i expected him to say jesus christ but then he said the word what's the difference there is no difference if you bring them to the word you brought them to christ you bring them to christ you bring them to the word there's no difference that's why uh years ago i said i reject that old notion that first you bring him to christ then you bring him to the message i heard that said several times and i said if you can bring somebody to christ without the message then why do you need the message discard the message the whole goal is to get to christ so how can you bring somebody to christ before you bring him to the message you've separated the message of christ but the messenger said this message is christ christ is the word amen from genesis through revelation it's all christ so how can you bring somebody to christ and then bring them to the message that concept makes the message unnecessary unless you believe you can go higher than christ but if you come to christ how can you go higher that's the goal so so he they're going to bring them to the real living sacrifice the word and then he goes on and says and the seventh angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to what call the people the bride out of the pentecostal and world tradition to the genuine atonement what's an atonement the covering for your sins the genuine covering for your sins he's going to bring them out of the pentecostal world tradition to the genuine atonement the word what is the word the atonement what is the word in this day the genuine atonement that covers my sin when i receive the word i am receiving the blood i am receiving the life i am receiving christ amen it is a living sacrifice it is a bleeding word it has the power to wash me from my sins because what is sin unbelief what is the word doing bringing us back into faith in god [Music] amen to the genuine atonement the word christ impersonated in his word here made flesh among us praise be to god christ in christ where here in his word in person among us made flesh among us he says now in questions and answers he's going to start dealing with the foolish virgin and he says this is interesting what he says it all fits into the same picture see the gentile bride is in heaven and the sleeping virgin the gentile virgin is not to be saved during that time she's already been saved but has been rejected in the bride and she only goes through the tribulation period for a time of purification what is the waters of separation purification from sin so she must go through the time of tribulation brother ben said elsewhere to shed her own blood for rejecting the blood she has to give her own life she has to be purified by shedding her own blood but this is what he says here she goes through they only goes through the tribulation period for a time of purification because she was she has rejected christ the word for her purification so the the foolish virgin in the end time has rejected christ the word for purification that means the word is the waters of separation is the purification from sin this end time message amen has brought back the word in its fullness which is the purification of sin because sin is unbelief so now this foolish virgin rejected that so she must go through the tribulation period to shed her own blood to be for her purification well praise god i don't have to shed my own blood for purification i praise god i don't have to enter into a works program for purification praise god all i have to do is surrender to this word that's been given to us and let the word wash me from the sin of unbelief to bring back the mind of christ amen so that i lose my mind my thinking and take on the mind of christ and that it changes everything about me and brings me into an alignment with the word not by willpower but by surrender so every time i preach this i feel like i i gotta balance everything but you understand what i'm saying if you if you know to do good and don't do it it's sin we're not gonna leave the word if you know to do good and don't do it you're not gonna say well i'm waiting for the word to change me sometimes you just got to make a decision and you just got to deny yourself and just do what the word says so none of that lazy christian goofy excuses stuff so you can continue in sin and act like you're righteous the word takes care of all of that there's a scripture for all of that if you know to do good and don't do it and do it not it is sin but there's those things amen that we don't even know about ourselves there's those things that we're learning all the time in the word amen and i have to be washed from me i have to be washed amen from the condition of my first birth amen i have to come to a new birth i need the washing of the water of the word to separate me amen from everything that's unlike him and i want to lay under that word for my purification to make me a perfect bride because i've received a perfect word that has done a perfect redemption and made my soul perfect before god you may still look at brother chad and has a sticky cockapoo outside and you may see little things stick to it from once in a while but i'm not looking that anymore i'm looking down at the real me on the inside that's been born again by receiving this word and receiving the life of the word and inside amen there is a perfect man [Applause] hallelujah you say it's pretty deep in there brother tell ya it's pretty deep some days some days it's a little deeper than others amen i'm afraid but it's there i rest assured it's there and what has brought the purification of the soul amen has been purified by the receiving the word for this day brought the life of christ and a new birth to quicken the seed on the inside and brought a perfect new birth amen to correct the first birth god will take care of this old conqueror nature it's going to be it's going to be changed but there's something on the inside that is coming to perfection to a faith a perfect faith and a perfect word that's been restored to us to believe it to accept it to surrender to it i say even to the parts that you keep tripping over you still say it's nothing but the truth i believe even though i failed it yesterday and if i fail it again today that's me has nothing to do with the word it's still perfect and i still receive it and i still love it and i still want it more than anything else it's a perfect word and that word will bring us to perfection if we stay under the washing of the water but if brother bam said but if you won't stay under the word how are you going to be washed so we know that the bride doesn't go through tribulation because she's been purified by receiving the word by receiving christ now i want to look at a couple scriptures that are really familiar let's turn to first john 1. we went through this sunday but i want to look at this again real quick first john one and seven we probably could all just recite it once i say first john 1 7 but i'd like to read it for a minute if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin now we know that the light is illumination or revelation and in and the word produces light we'll get into that in a minute but if we walk in the light as he is in the light so if we walk in the light as he is in the light so wherever he is in the light we have to walk there not where the light was but where he is in the light then we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ cleanse us from all sin because it's the water of separation now in the message turn on the light he says no life can come outside of light light produces light produces life there can be no life out life outside of light natural or spiritual there must be and only light can come by the word of god god's word is the light when it's manifested let's take this principle and look at it for a minute no life can come outside of light both natural and spiritual and light only comes by the word of god so in the beginning when we go back to genesis 1 2 we find the earth shrouded in darkness so no life can come upon the earth because it's shrouded in darkness so the first thing he does is give a word that'll produce light and the very first thing he does is say let there be light now listen god does everything so perfect in this word that the very first thing his spoken word brings is light and the very first purpose of the spoken word is light and without light there is no life so the first thing he does is bring the light that will produce the life and that light is an illumination both natural and spiritual it is a revelation it is the light bulb going off it is an understanding it is a seeing so the very first thing he does a meant to bring life back upon the earth amen is he speaks a word and then there's light and then the light he begins to position the light and separate the waters and so that that light can now get to that seed so the first thing he does is give light amen so the first thing he does is give his word but then he begins to position everything so that the light can get to the seed and when the light gets to the seed it quickens the life inside the seed and the seed comes to life because the creation story is our redemption story and our salvation story but first there had to be light so god first gave his word and after he gave his word then through the bible he begins to position everything so that he can get everything in position so that the light can strike the seed and when the light strikes the seed there's already power of transformation in the seed because it's also part of the word and part of the life but that life cannot be quickened without the light so now light represents illumination of revelation from the spoken word of god said let there be light then the light manifests so when the spoken word come to manifestation it was the light that would bring the life so nothing's changed if you want the seed inside somebody to come to life then they must receive the light amen the light amen you can have all kinds of good works programs you can invite somebody to church every day but there's nothing going to bring up that life without the light of revelation of the word of god and so when god won a fully mature fully manifested bride upon this earth he had to bring the light in full power amen not diminished whatsoever he had to position through seven churches get everything moved out of the way everything in position everything pushed aside so he could get the full light of seven church ages to shine upon the seed in this day to bring it to full life and outside of that we're not coming to life so we have church systems we won't do anything we can have great big programs won't do anything we can have great moves of emotion it won't do anything but it is the light of the manifested word of god that will bring the light to the sea so if we want somebody to be born again they must receive the light of the hour the message this is the message that brings new life in this day praise god so there should be no confusion about that it's the light so let's go over to john the gospel of john chapter 1. i just recited this but i'd like to read it together i said we're going to hit these two very familiar passages of scripture that we went through last time but i want to look at them again in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men in him the word was life and that life was the illumination it was the light that brings us to life in the message there is a man here that can turn on the light the prophet of god simply says christ is the light and the light is the life and the word manifested is the light of the hour i don't know about you but i'm simple enough to understand that christ is the light and the light and the light is the life so do we want the life then you have to have the light then he says and the word manifested is the light of the hour what does that do it brings life in the message possessing the gate of the enemy after the trial so now but when jesus the son of god virgin born shed his blood the life that was in the blood was god itself god created that blood the life that was in the blood was god itself the bible said we are saved by the life the blood of god not the blood of a jew not the blood of a gentile but the life of god god created this blood cell virgin born so when when we received the blood the brother bam said the blood is it symbolizes the life the life is in the blood going all the way back to leviticus leviticus and when that blood cell was broke brother bram said it released god to come back so when you receive the blood of jesus christ it's the life of the blood that we receive so what is light life what is blood life what is the word life i mean what is the baptism the holy ghost life it's all bringing life amen it all speaks to the same thing let's go to matthew let's go over here to matthew chapter 4. i just want to read a couple more scriptures matthew chapter four matthew chapter four verse 3. it says and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command these stones to be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god how do you live by the word how do you live by light how do you live by the word how do you live by the blood what's different with these three things nothing it all goes together the prophet of god said in the message hear ye him you stay right on the word and that word is life and every time you receive the word you receive life every time you receive the word you receive light every time you receive the word you receive life every time you receive the word you receive the blood of purification the waters of separation it all is the same thing the word in this day has come to purify a bride it has come to be waters of separation to separate us from the world it has come to cleanse us from the sin of unbelief it has come to bring us into perfection it has come to bring the light that brings the life it has come to grow us into full maturity this word does it all so we must receive the word that's why man does not live by bread alone but by every word what have we received the full word by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that's what brings life that's what we live by amen this natural life that we have is only a reflection of a real life it's not even the real life but the real life comes by the word of god and so so that's why when we realize what the water of separation is what the bleeding word does what the uh pure what the genuine atonement is what the light in life is when we put all of this picture together amen that shouldn't make us embrace our bibles and our message books like never before friend amen this isn't this isn't a part-time thing this is our whole life amen the word that's been given to us was to bring a perfection in this day i mean that's why we should we should be devouring the tapes devouring the books devouring our bibles amen because it's the only thing we have to bring us to where we need to be good works won't do it better church attendance alone won't do it amen all of these things that that we try to do it'll come to none effect if we try all of that separated from the word all of our efforts will be in fame and all of our righteousness is filthy rags but god has brought something in this day like it's not been upon the earth before amen there's been a word that has been revealed and the revelation of the seven thunders the seals have been opened the full picture the full word has been given back to bring a purification to bring light to bring life to bring salvation to bring redemption to bring it all and this message should be more precious to us every day of our lives it becomes when you see things like this when i see things like this all i want to do is go sit in the corner and read a message book i just want to pick up my book i just want to read in my bible because i realize in this day this is my only hope it's the only thing i have i don't have anything else i can't do it i can't change myself i can't overcome on my own there's nothing else i can do amen but what i can do is receive the very thing that's been given to bring me to perfection to bring redemption to bring a cleansing to bring a washing to bring it all has come when he gave us back the word he gave us back everything we need to complete this journey to come to perfection it's all here and so now i don't want to neglect the very thing that's been given i say god this word is becoming more precious to me day by day let it always be that way may we always love this word and receive it as a water of washing let's go to john chapter six we'll finish with this scripture john chapter six verse 63 john 6 and 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet of nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life what are the words life what does the word bring light what is the word in this day it's the bleeding bloody word the word that bled for us there's a water of separation available to us there's a water of purification for sin that is here it is in our hands the the the light that brings life is in our hands the water of separation has been placed in our hands the water purification everything's been placed in our hands he's just asking us to receive it and surrender to it i am so beyond trying to figure anything out i tried that i come up short i'm so beyond trying to live a perfect life i tried that too and i came up short and now the only thing i know to do is to embrace the very thing that'll bring me perfection i don't know what else to do i i tried to live a better life and i failed again i tried to be more spiritual when i came up short i tried i mean i tried through discipline the fast and pray and spiritualize my way into a greater walk and i failed there too it seems like everything i tried to do i came up short there's only one thing i know to do is grab this word and hold on to it and say god this is my only hope i've got this message is it amen this message that you brought through the seventh angel is the only thing that i got that'll get me to where i need to be i just need to take it devour it feed on it stay under it let it pour over me surrender to it obey it give it time give it attention give it the best that i've got because it's the only thing that i can do that's our only option friends what else are we going to do to become a perfect bride what else are we going to do to be washed from the sin of unbelief and washed from all these prostitutes there's nothing else we can do but just stay in this word and let this word flow over us to wash it all away bring us through the filter of god's word to filter out all the wrong desire all the wrong thinking all the wrong concepts we got them from mom and we got them from dad we got them from other ministers we got them from friends we got them from our own thinking but let this word wash them out bring us to a purification of thought purification of desire purification of life by the filter he's given us which is the word in this day it's our only hope it's the waters of separation it's for purification of sin i i can give you no hope on attending this church for perfection i'm sorry it won't work i can give you no hope on doing a better job without the washing of the water of the word it's all in vain the only hope that i can give you is to stay beneath this word and let it wash all of us it'll separate us unto him it's the washing of the water of the word so that he will present to himself you know how much i would love in myself to present myself to him without blemish in my spot i'd love to get the iron out and get the bleach and say lord i present my but he will present to himself a bride how's he going to do it he sent the washing of the water of the word let's stay in it and let it wash us friends and let this revealed word in this day let it be the mighty one among us let it be the power that will transform us the word of god the life of christ in the word let it be the headship let it be the mighty one let it be great and let us be nothing i think that's the only way that we're going to get to where we need to be is when we become nothing in this christ this word becomes everything god bless you let's stand i don't know about you but i want to go home and read a message book i want to listen to that voice i want to stay under where the water is flowing there is a fresh kill of the word in this day and there's blood that's flowing from this word there's a fountain open again in the house of david for all the bethlehem dwellers are you a bethlehem dweller the house of god's bread has a fountain who is who is the bread of god christ who is the fountain christ who is open and this day the fountain is open again to all bethlehem dwellers i'm a bethlehem dweller and i want a drink from that fountain i want to stay beneath that fountain and let it wash me away amen let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word almighty god god we who are so unworthy in ourselves we are so incapable we are so unable lord to do what you desire for your bride to be and do in this age but god you never expected us to accomplish it on our own but you put a seed of faith inside of us that could believe you when you appeared in this day you put something inside of us before the foundation of the world that could connect to this fountain that's flowing fresh that could see it and could receive it god i pray that you would forgive us for our wonderings forgive us for all of our laziness lord forgive us for whatever has hindered us in the past but god our desire tonight is to stay beneath this flow to stay beneath this fountain that is flowing wide and clean with the pure water for our purification god accept us lord accept our repentance lord as we come to this word and come under this word let lord pour your word on us oh lord let the light shine in us give us a greater revelation of this word day by day let the illumination bring a greater life to us lord may we live in this light may we shine forth this light let it be the waters of separation for the purification of our sins let it for us be the washing of the water of the word that presents us back to you a bride without wrinkle without blemish god it's all you're doing but we surrender to it in jesus christ's name i surrender myself afresh tonight to you lord let this word do the work inside of me may you be glorified in it all in jesus christ's name we pray amen remember the bin make yourself ready with a sanctified love completely set apart this world is calling you to be separated for you are his [Music] make yourself ready with a sacrifice [Music] set apart this world is calling you to be separated for you are here [Music] friends i don't know how much better we could have it when god wanted a greater manifestation he brought a greater word [Music] when he wanted us to recognize what he was doing in this day he gave a manifestation that could be recorded that pictures could be taken that we could see and we could hear because he wanted to draw our attention to what he was doing because he was bringing a word for purification for perfection i don't know how much better we could possibly have it what else listen what else could we ask for if we could ask god for anything in the world what else can we ask for he's given us everything we need he's restored the word that'll bring us to the place that we're supposed to be i said thank you god and now i think the greatest thing that we can do in return is to receive what he sends and to receive it not part-time not partially but receive it with everything we've got and embrace it with our whole lives i think that's the greatest act of gratitude that we could give to the lord in this day is to take the very thing that he sent us and take it all and receive it all with joy and thanksgiving and surrender to it all to feast upon it to love it to listen to it to talk about it i think that's the greatest display of gratitude we can give to someone who's done everything for us when there was no hope he gave us his word when there was no way he gave us his word when the world was in darkness he sent a light he says rise and shine for thy light has come when there was no way that we could do anything be anything accomplish anything he sent everything we need to be what we need to be to accomplish what we need to accomplish and to be perfected i say the greatest thanksgiving to the lord is to say lord i want more of that word and i want it every day in my life i love it i surrender to it i stay beneath it i claim it as my headship i want it all [Music] let's show our gratitude to him and stay in this world i have nowhere else to point you friends i will fail you others will fail you every human being will fail you i have nowhere else to point you the only place i have to point you to is this word that's been given in this day but it's christ it can't fail what a consolation to have a place to take people to that you know won't fail oh we should be so happy satisfied we should be so secure in what god has done for us all we have to do is to receive it man god bless you god bless you as you go may the lord be with you and may be safe in your journeys those who visited from afar may god bless you as you travel we love you all in jesus name make yourself ready with a sacrifice [Music] apart this world is calling you to be separated for you are his [Music] make yourself [Music] completely set up [Applause] [Music] separated [Music] here i am [Music] oh i give all
