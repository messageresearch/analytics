[0:00] we've been going around saying I'm in
[0:03] the message I'm in the message I'm in
[0:04] the message
[0:06] and my question is where's the
[0:09] vindication
[0:10] where's the vindication
[0:12] where is the vindication
[0:14] and so let me move on to where I'm going
[0:18] because it's not all about
[0:20] walking
[0:23] no no no it's about life
[0:28] The Headstone is about life
[0:32] where those twin sisters Grace
[0:35] and love
[0:36] works on you
[0:39] and you can't have Grace
[0:43] when there is no love
[0:46] hello somebody
[0:47] and the love I'm talking about is not
[0:50] something like filial
[0:53] it is agape love
[0:56] it it so controls you you can't help
[0:59] yourself
[1:00] Hallelujah now you say what do you mean
[1:03] now what brother Branham gave us was a
[1:06] vision
[1:07] right habakkuk said when the vision
[1:09] division will speak and we know these
[1:11] things
[1:12] Hallelujah but it took a prophet to give
[1:15] us a vision
[1:17] and listen the vision we we didn't know
[1:20] where it was going to take us because
[1:21] the Bible said we haven't come this way
[1:23] before
[1:25] but now we can see the way we're going
[1:28] we can see the leadership of the Holy
[1:31] Spirit we can see that this this this uh
[1:35] position we call bride
[1:38] it's a it's a high calling
[1:41] in a wicked age like this in a terrible
[1:44] age where everything is perverted and
[1:46] going crazy
[1:48] God is calling for people to be a lamb
[1:53] is that right because when the sea is
[1:56] will open
[1:57] is that right
[1:58] John he heard a lion
[2:02] but when he turned he saw a bloody
[2:06] bleeding land
[2:08] it changed from the Lion
[2:11] to the lamb
[2:13] is that right that's why it is called
[2:16] the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:19] because only thing that's in this book
[2:21] are lambs
[2:23] and the Lamb's forfeits all of his
[2:26] rights
[2:27] Hallelujah I'm sorry you may be in the
[2:31] age of land is here which is called
[2:33] people's rights but when you come into
[2:35] this bodies you've got to strip yourself
[2:38] of every right you think you have
[2:43] Hallelujah
