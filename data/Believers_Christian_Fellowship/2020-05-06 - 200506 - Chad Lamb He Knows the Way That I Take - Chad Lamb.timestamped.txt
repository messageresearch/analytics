[0:00] my boat of Life sails on a troubled

[1:13] may bring me long but never bring me

[6:06] Lord here I
[6:12] am let your
[6:15] spirit mov Through Me Lord here
[6:21] [Music]
[6:23] I praise the lord it's good to see you
[6:27] all certainly good to be together
[6:29] every time that we can gather now in
[6:31] worship it's a precious time amen I
[6:34] think the fellowship has become sweeter
[6:36] and I think it'll become sweeter yet
[6:38] amen when we finally get through all the
[6:41] obstacles and all the hurdles and and
[6:43] the the things begin to change and we
[6:46] can get back together I got a feeling
[6:48] we're going to enjoy our fellowship amen
[6:50] it's going to be sweeter and sweeter and
[6:53] sweeter man let's take our Bibles and
[6:55] turn to the Book of
[6:57] Job job
[7:01] 23 I wanted to move in a different
[7:04] direction but the Lord wouldn't allow me
[7:06] so we're going to kind of stay in the
[7:07] same vein we've been in the last few
[7:09] services and I just have really just one
[7:11] thought really just one thing the Lord
[7:13] impressed on my heart I want to bring so
[7:15] we can be done in 15 minutes or 30 I
[7:17] don't know how long it'll take but I
[7:19] just want to share this one thought amen
[7:22] and it's not a new thought it's nothing
[7:23] deep it's nothing major but it's it's
[7:25] one of those things that the simplest
[7:27] thoughts are the most profound amen it's
[7:30] always that way with God no matter how
[7:32] simple it looks there's the things in
[7:34] the scriptures and things of God that
[7:35] are so simple you can speak it you can
[7:37] say it and you can get a child to say it
[7:39] and understand what you're talking about
[7:41] but the more you explore it the more it
[7:43] unfolds and the deeper and deeper it
[7:45] gets it's profoundly deep and and
[7:47] absolutely simple I don't know how God
[7:50] can do that but that's our God Amen
[7:52] that's the way he does and he continues
[7:54] to unfold himself so let's look at Job
[7:57] 23 we'll begin begin here job
[8:02] 23:10 but he knoweth the way that I take
[8:06] when Heath tried me I shall come forth
[8:09] as gold I want to minister on he knows
[8:12] the way that I take man let's just bow
[8:14] our heads and pray dear heavenly father
[8:17] we thank you Lord Jesus Lord we ask that
[8:20] you would just Minister Lord unto us
[8:22] Lord tonight that you would be the
[8:24] preacher Lord that you would be the one
[8:26] Lord who speaks it may be these vocal
[8:29] towards of a human man but Lord that's
[8:31] not what we want to hear from Lord we
[8:32] want to hear from you lord your spirit
[8:35] speaking through this vessel give us
[8:37] ears to hear and a heart to perceive all
[8:39] that you have for us may we receive it
[8:41] Lord and may it change us may we be able
[8:43] to glorify your name more and more in
[8:46] Jesus name we pray amen God bless you as
[8:49] your seated we're going to look at this
[8:51] scripture
[8:56] again let's go back to verse 7 and catch
[8:59] the a thought here where job is at in
[9:01] verse 7 there the righteous might
[9:04] dispute with him actually uh let's go to
[9:07] verse
[9:08] six will he plead against me with his
[9:11] great power no but he would put strength
[9:13] in me there the righteous might dispute
[9:16] with him so should I be delivered
[9:18] forever from my judge behold I go
[9:21] forward but he is not there and backward
[9:23] but I cannot perceive him on the left
[9:25] hand where he doth work but I cannot
[9:27] Behold Him He hideth himself on the
[9:29] right hand that I cannot see him but he
[9:32] knoweth the way that I take and when he
[9:34] hath tried me I shall come forth this
[9:36] goldone so what job is saying is in the
[9:39] midst of his trial uh job is going
[9:41] through a real ordeal amen does anybody
[9:43] believe that job was really in a trial
[9:46] am mean he was in the Press I mean he
[9:48] was being pressed out and everything was
[9:50] being pressed out of job and and he had
[9:52] lost so much and and yet he was
[9:54] depending on God and he gets to this
[9:56] place where he's saying I go forward but
[9:59] he not there I go backwards but I can't
[10:01] perceive him I look to the left where I
[10:03] know he's working but I can't find him
[10:05] to the right he hideth himself for me
[10:07] he's saying I don't know where God's at
[10:09] I don't know what God's doing I haven't
[10:11] gotten God's movement figured out but
[10:14] this thing I know he knows the way that
[10:16] I take I can't figure him out his ways
[10:19] are in the sea and they're past finding
[10:21] out I'm I'm not going to say I know what
[10:24] God's going to do where he's at what
[10:25] he's going to do next cuz I can't
[10:27] perceive what he's doing all around me
[10:29] but I know one thing he knows the way
[10:31] that I take and when I am tried I shall
[10:34] come forth as gold this is the beautiful
[10:37] part of this when when job is saying
[10:39] when I am tried I shall come forth as
[10:41] gold amen he's making a profound
[10:44] statement because the trying of the gold
[10:47] can never change what's not gold into
[10:49] gold amen the trying is not to change
[10:53] the trying is to purify and make gold
[10:55] more pure gold so job is not saying
[10:59] after he's tried me after he's pressed
[11:00] me after he's beaten me out after he's
[11:02] burnt me in fire all of the sudden you
[11:05] know this Clay is going to turn into
[11:07] gold that's not what he's saying when
[11:09] job says he knows the way that I take
[11:12] and after he's tried me I'll come forth
[11:13] as gold what he saying is God knew what
[11:16] I was
[11:18] before and job knew what he was
[11:21] before this is a huge statement and
[11:24] though he tries me though he tests me
[11:27] though he puts me in the Pres and he
[11:29] puts me in the fiery furnace he knows
[11:31] the way that I take and when I'm tried I
[11:34] shall come forth as gold amen job was
[11:37] talking like a
[11:38] Believer but oh what a what a hard trial
[11:41] he was in let's go from here over to
[11:44] Proverbs and I want to pick up the two
[11:46] verses that I started with on
[11:49] Sunday this is what I'm having a hard
[11:51] time getting away
[11:54] from Proverbs
[11:57] 16 and
[12:04] 32 he that is slow to anger is better
[12:07] than the mighty and he that ruleth his
[12:10] Spirit than he that taketh a
[12:12] city
[12:14] amen better than the mighty and he that
[12:17] can rule his Spirit that's the human
[12:19] spirit is better than he that can take a
[12:22] city Proverbs
[12:27] 25 skip over to proverbs
[12:29] 25 and verse
[12:33] 28 he that hath no rule over his own
[12:35] spirit is like a city that has broken
[12:38] down and without walls so there's
[12:42] there's we come to this life amen with
[12:45] the human spirit amen and this human
[12:47] Spirit we know is Fallen we come through
[12:49] a mother and father and in that through
[12:52] the the breeding and the mixing together
[12:54] we get all kinds of things that come
[12:56] down through and and then there's some
[12:57] shaping that takes place in our life
[13:00] amen that brings out more of these
[13:02] qualities or more of these undesirable
[13:04] qualities amen and and it accents them
[13:08] or highlights them for us amen but but
[13:10] if we don't learn how to possess our
[13:13] vessel amen if we don't learn how to uh
[13:15] uh to control our spirit or have
[13:18] dominance over our spirit amen it'll be
[13:20] like one with a a wall with with with a
[13:23] city with no walls that's broken down
[13:24] and defenseless because we're just going
[13:26] to be flying off the handle all the time
[13:28] are are making flighty decisions just
[13:31] based off Feeling Just based off emotion
[13:33] just based off the way that we're moving
[13:35] Amen in the spiritual realm but there's
[13:37] got to be something more solid a little
[13:39] down deeper that'll take control of the
[13:42] spiritual realm and say no we're not
[13:44] going to run over here and we're not
[13:46] going to be afraid and we're not going
[13:48] to be angry and we're not going to get
[13:49] hostile we're not going to speak nasty
[13:52] amen there's got to be something else
[13:55] amen and he that ruleth his spirit is
[13:57] better than he that taketh a city amen
[13:59] because you're going to be more powerful
[14:01] amen and you're going to be you're going
[14:02] to be a greater conqueror when you can
[14:05] conquer yourself than he that can
[14:07] conquer a walled
[14:08] City praise be to
[14:10] God I going to look at the life of
[14:13] brother Brenham just for a minute and I
[14:14] just want to say as we start into this
[14:16] that I thank God every day and I can't
[14:19] thank him enough for a wave sheath
[14:21] offering that was weighed before the
[14:22] people the first part of the word to
[14:24] come to full Harvest maturity and that
[14:26] first part of the word amen came to
[14:28] maturity in that vessel of clay and when
[14:31] the word was lifted up it was lifted up
[14:32] in that vessel and weighed before us and
[14:34] we could see a mature Son of God on
[14:38] display but thank God for 1200 tapes and
[14:41] thank God for an honest vessel that
[14:43] would stand over the pull pit and tell
[14:45] the truth about his life amen because if
[14:48] it wasn't that we would be a confused
[14:50] beat up uh disappointed group of people
[14:53] amen because he was there telling us the
[14:55] struggles he went through and his
[14:57] failures and what made him the way he
[14:59] was and the way God was dealing with him
[15:01] and the correction that he was under so
[15:03] we could realize a mature Son of God
[15:06] Amen can still make a mistake a mature
[15:08] Son of God can still get
[15:10] corrected and so I thank God for that
[15:13] amen I can't thank him enough for that
[15:15] amen because it it it really tells us
[15:17] where we're at and as God is bringing us
[15:18] to maturity he's correcting and
[15:20] correcting and correcting and he and he
[15:22] wants something that he's going to get
[15:24] out of this vessel something he knows is
[15:26] already there and he knows how the
[15:28] second circumstances to get it out amen
[15:30] and to let it come out he's got to get
[15:32] us motivated to get ourselves out of the
[15:35] way and God knows how to get us
[15:37] motivated I mean God is the master
[15:40] motivator amen remember we're on free
[15:42] moral agency so he can't do the choosing
[15:44] for you amen you've got to do the
[15:47] choosing of your own free will in this
[15:49] life but he knows how to move the
[15:51] circumstances he's the master of the
[15:53] circumstances until he can get you to
[15:56] where you hate yourself so bad in the
[15:58] the decisions you made and the
[16:00] consequences for your action till you're
[16:02] willing to make the right choice amen
[16:05] and that's his grace that's his great
[16:07] love for us he won't let us just go on
[16:10] but if we go down the wrong road he'll
[16:11] move the circumstances around until all
[16:13] of the sudden you loathe the vessel that
[16:16] you live in and you hate the way you
[16:18] think and you hate your emotions and
[16:21] amen until you're willing to say God I
[16:24] absolutely have to have you because I
[16:26] don't I mean there's nothing good about
[16:28] me know not one good thing about me the
[16:31] only good thing about me is what you put
[16:33] in there before the foundation of the
[16:34] world a c Gene that believes you and
[16:36] want you and I'm praying God that you
[16:38] would just break me down so that you can
[16:40] have your way amen and that's his great
[16:43] love for us that he will do those things
[16:46] for us I mean we come to those times
[16:48] with
[16:49] tears frustration disappointment
[16:52] discouragement but it's his grace to
[16:55] us in the message uniting time in signs
[16:58] from
[16:59] 1963 says one of my main things that
[17:02] I've has always hurt me through my life
[17:04] has been a nervous
[17:06] condition that when I get so worn then I
[17:09] get real weary I kind of feel like
[17:11] nobody cares for you know and you you
[17:14] have it too and I just happen to have a
[17:16] real overdose of it you know and it gets
[17:18] real bad sometime and I can't hardly
[17:21] it's tension and that's what does it and
[17:23] I get to a spot then that many times
[17:25] especially with so many of those visions
[17:27] and you see it gets me I I look at a
[17:29] person I think this is a vision no no no
[17:31] it isn't yes yes it is it's it's not you
[17:34] see and you you just don't realize what
[17:36] a price goes with that then you wonder
[17:39] then you get to think well then you get
[17:42] off your side and say well now what what
[17:45] have I done here I am 50 years old and
[17:47] I've done nothing for the Lord and I'm
[17:49] getting old and what's and then I mean
[17:52] at this point we're chuckling right it's
[17:55] like brother B what are you struggling
[17:56] with you've done nothing for the Lord
[17:58] I mean nobody loves
[18:01] you but it's just as ridiculous as the
[18:04] things we struggle with the questions
[18:07] that are going on in our mind am mean
[18:08] another believer if you start to express
[18:11] some of the things that you're
[18:11] struggling with another believer will
[18:13] say that's not that's not a problem
[18:15] you're okay you're fine because they can
[18:17] see they mean they're not there in the
[18:20] complex they're not there with that
[18:22] nature they're not there with all the
[18:24] bombarding thoughts and all the tension
[18:26] and all the pressures amen that are
[18:27] bringing us to the wrong conclusions and
[18:29] here we can see brother bam in the same
[18:31] place said something that's i' bothered
[18:33] me all my life amen is is a nervousness
[18:37] amen is a nervous condition and you
[18:39] think how could he be in a nervous
[18:41] condition he's got a Healing Ministry
[18:42] he's prayed for everybody amen he after
[18:45] this he he got caught up in a
[18:47] constellation of angels he's come and
[18:49] he's preached the opening of The Seven
[18:51] Seals amen he has seen that the whole
[18:53] mystery unfold and he knows what it is
[18:55] how can he still be plagued with a
[18:57] nervous condition
[19:00] Hallelujah take that
[19:03] devil because you can be still plagued
[19:06] with a nervous
[19:07] condition anxiousness anxiety depression
[19:12] uh uh frustration and anger and all of
[19:14] these things jealousy all of these
[19:16] things can still be things that are
[19:18] plaguing Us in the spirit realm and God
[19:20] is teaching us amen how to
[19:23] overcome and brother brandom had the
[19:25] same thing after the revelation of the
[19:27] seals after after uh uh he receives the
[19:30] the open book and the revelation after I
[19:32] mean Supernatural in in 1963 he says you
[19:36] know this has been one of the greatest
[19:37] years of Supernatural in my whole
[19:39] Ministry things were accumulating so
[19:42] fast out there in the desert I couldn't
[19:43] keep up with it and here he is right in
[19:45] the middle of this in August of this
[19:47] year and he's saying I'm always struggle
[19:49] with a nervous condition get the feeling
[19:50] like nobody loves
[19:52] me nobody
[19:54] cares get to thinking I'm 50 years old
[19:56] and I've not done nothing for the Lord
[19:58] Lord my oh
[20:01] mind said I'm I'm getting old then you
[20:04] just get what we used to call the blues
[20:07] some of you Brethren about my age
[20:08] remember what they used to call have the
[20:11] blues pop used to talk about it and I
[20:14] wondered what he meant and I sure know
[20:16] now what he meant so then you get the
[20:18] feeling that way which is none of it
[20:20] true it's just you you know it see you
[20:23] know it it's just you doing
[20:26] that brother Benham he he was he was
[20:28] beginning to understand
[20:31] himself he was beginning to understand
[20:34] what where his weakness was where his
[20:36] nervous condition came from and when he
[20:39] began to wear on him and he knew when he
[20:40] got tired and then and got under tension
[20:43] with all the visions that would come on
[20:44] him and he says now you know that's not
[20:47] the truth you still feel that way but
[20:50] you know it's not the truth you know
[20:52] that's just
[20:53] you and and I want to just quote you
[20:57] from James 4:7 it says submit yourselves
[21:00] therefore to God resist the devil and he
[21:02] will flee from you Amen brother bham
[21:05] couldn't help getting to feeling this
[21:07] way amen but he realized that's not the
[21:10] truth amen see the thing you cannot do
[21:12] is identify with it that's it you cannot
[21:15] identify with it you cannot believe the
[21:18] devil's lie you cannot accept it and you
[21:20] cannot repeat
[21:23] it you you you can't stop from feeling
[21:26] that way in fact when brother Brandon
[21:27] went to Mayo's clinic and they did some
[21:29] testing on his stomach because he had so
[21:31] much trouble with it because of a
[21:32] nervous condition from a boy amen he had
[21:35] so much trouble with his stomach he was
[21:37] always looking for a solution to his
[21:39] stomach problem he went to Mayo Clinic
[21:41] he went to another doctor that put a
[21:43] scope down his throat and mean he did
[21:44] all these things he was trying to find a
[21:46] solution and in mayo clinics they said
[21:48] that's the way you'll always be he
[21:50] because because you got a blend between
[21:52] Irish blood and Indian blood remember
[21:55] that he said oh I was so discouraged
[21:58] they said that's just that mix and you
[22:00] get some mixes together and it's it's
[22:02] just a mix because of the Irish blood
[22:04] and the Indian Blood come together and
[22:06] you'll always be that way and there's
[22:08] nothing wrong with you you're just
[22:09] nervous because of that and that was the
[22:12] solution Mayo Clinic
[22:15] had but I want to say
[22:17] this brother Ben's the one who told us
[22:20] that God looked after your great
[22:22] grandparents and your grandparents and
[22:24] your parents de breed this one to this
[22:25] one that's what he said this one to this
[22:27] one to get it down to your mom and dad
[22:30] amen one had to travel from this country
[22:32] to this country or from that place to
[22:33] this place to get you just the way you
[22:37] are because he he had to get the Bell so
[22:40] much tin and so much copper and so much
[22:42] lead just to get that certain Ting out
[22:44] of that Bell or out of that chime so it
[22:45] can play in his great Symphony and God
[22:48] bringing that down amen it was his
[22:50] design to get it down because there was
[22:52] something he wanted in this mix when he
[22:54] got this mix together that you would
[22:56] play a note that nobody else could play
[22:59] but because it was a perverted life and
[23:01] it was coming a perverted way amen
[23:04] through sex desire amen also along with
[23:07] that breeding to get the thing God
[23:08] wanted there came some things that
[23:10] wasn't
[23:12] desirable cuz it what couldn't be in
[23:14] Perfection because it couldn't come his
[23:16] perfect way so now as it comes down amen
[23:20] through the breeding amen he's got to
[23:22] get this one thing that he wants to use
[23:24] us for but along the way other baggage
[23:27] comes along from great grandma and Great
[23:29] Grandpa and maybe we might have got
[23:31] something God wants to use but we got
[23:33] something else that's going to be a
[23:35] hindrance to us every day of our life
[23:37] something that we're going to have to
[23:38] fight with and contend with and keep at
[23:41] Bay amen these are the things the
[23:45] message teaches us it isn't thank God
[23:48] for a message amen thank God for an
[23:51] honest messenger who would tell us this
[23:53] is a real life this is what Christian
[23:55] life is all about you don't give your
[23:57] heart to the Lord he erases everything
[23:59] off of you and now all of a sudden
[24:01] everything's perfect no everything's
[24:04] perfect between you and God the blood of
[24:06] Jesus Christ washes you away and makes
[24:08] you sinless and and free from all guilt
[24:10] but it doesn't take away everything that
[24:13] we struggle with in this
[24:15] flesh some of those things are still
[24:17] there and God helps us to overcome those
[24:20] things brother B said in Christ is
[24:24] revealed in his own word
[24:26] 1965
[24:28] I was just talking to a young Minister
[24:29] and his wife in the room just a few
[24:31] moments ago and both of them are nervous
[24:34] just like the rest of the world rest of
[24:35] the human beings on Earth I said
[24:37] remember Satan's got a Punch coming at
[24:40] you don't care who you are he's got a
[24:42] right for that one punch which had you
[24:45] rather it be that punch be blind or be
[24:47] arthritic sitting in a chair or be
[24:49] nervous see he's got somewhere he can
[24:51] punch you he's got a right to that open
[24:54] place now that's the spot you've got to
[24:57] keep covering all the
[24:59] time and to see this nervous age that
[25:02] we're living in now see brother bams in
[25:05] an interview with two people and he's
[25:06] talking to a a minister and his wife and
[25:09] he's saying now you got a nervous
[25:11] condition you've got a nervousness and
[25:12] he doesn't say let me lay hands on you
[25:14] and take that away from you and now you
[25:16] bother you no more he didn't do that he
[25:18] said we all got
[25:20] something there's something amen that's
[25:23] come through life something we struggle
[25:26] with something we fight with there's
[25:27] something there a spot an open place
[25:30] that the devil's got a Punch coming at
[25:32] us amen he said which would you rather
[25:33] it be would you rather be blindness
[25:35] arthritis I mean so you find out that
[25:37] there's something that that God has left
[25:42] there something that God could could God
[25:45] remove it absolutely but something God
[25:46] has left there and it's a place where
[25:50] the devil can punch at us and it's a
[25:52] place that we've got to keep covered all
[25:54] the time so what brother benam did in
[25:58] the in the interview there he didn't
[26:00] take it away through superpowers what he
[26:02] did was reveal the mystery of what was
[26:04] going on in their lives and he equipped
[26:07] them to fight the battle he told them to
[26:09] keep that area covered this is an area
[26:11] this is where the devil can get to you
[26:13] you got to keep it covered and if you'll
[26:15] if you'll look really close at your life
[26:17] you'll find your failures and your
[26:19] frustrations and the things that trip
[26:21] you up are always come back to the same
[26:23] thing over and over and over again it's
[26:26] not something new every time it may be
[26:28] new circumstances it may be new people
[26:31] and new names and new locations but
[26:33] you'll find if you study the pattern of
[26:35] your life the thing that keeps getting
[26:37] you is the same thing over and over and
[26:41] over
[26:42] again true amen praise God it could be
[26:45] jealousy it could be lust it could be a
[26:47] temper it could be a nervous condition
[26:49] it could be a weakness in the body that
[26:52] keeps coming reoccurring over and over a
[26:54] sickness that keeps coming back right
[26:57] God and when you when we recognize that
[26:59] pattern through our lives now we know
[27:02] that's the spot where the devil's got a
[27:03] punch with me this is what I got to keep
[27:05] covered all the time this is what I got
[27:08] to watch for this is where I have to be
[27:10] on guard amen I I've told people before
[27:13] when we've talked in the office amen
[27:14] people will struggle with something over
[27:16] and over in their lives amen and I can
[27:18] say you know take gambling for
[27:21] instance if you got somebody who's got a
[27:23] real jealous Spirit on them they really
[27:25] struggle with that jealousy you know
[27:28] brother brandham said his wife hope had
[27:30] that his first wife had that and he
[27:34] actually told his daughter Rebecca Bram
[27:35] gives us in her testimony they say
[27:37] that's why amen God took her off the
[27:39] scene he had to have MAA because hope
[27:41] couldn't handle the kind of ministry
[27:43] that brother bom
[27:45] had these things are
[27:48] amazing God and you have somebody with a
[27:51] jealous Spirit that's the area they got
[27:53] to keep covered and watch for all the
[27:54] time amen they don't have to worry about
[27:56] breaking into a gambling spirit and
[27:58] running to a
[27:59] casino like it's not even a Temptation
[28:01] it's not even a pull it's not even a
[28:03] pressure it's not anything that's going
[28:05] to trip them up or anything's going to
[28:06] fail but the devil's always going to
[28:08] work the circumstances to try to put
[28:10] pressure on that spot that he knows he's
[28:12] got an open Punch coming that's the spot
[28:15] that works it works over and over and
[28:18] over again amen and I say God reveal to
[28:20] us the place we've got to keep covered
[28:22] amen so that we know how to fight that
[28:24] devil back and resist the devil and keep
[28:26] that covered amen and keep him drove out
[28:28] of our
[28:29] [Music]
[28:31] land amen it's awesome to have a prophet
[28:36] on the scene to tell us how this
[28:39] works so this a spot you got to keep
[28:41] covered all the
[28:42] time let's go to Judges chapter
[28:45] 3 let's look at a couple scriptures here
[28:48] in
[28:56] judges
[29:07] Judges chapter
[29:11] 3 verse
[29:13] one now these are the Nations which the
[29:16] Lord left to prove Israel by them amen
[29:19] even as many of israels had not known
[29:21] all the wars of Canaan so there's a new
[29:24] crop of Israelites coming up but it says
[29:26] these are the Nations which the Lord
[29:28] left he left some Nations he didn't
[29:31] drive them all out he left some Nations
[29:34] to prove to prove Israel by them even as
[29:38] many as Israel had many of Israel had
[29:41] not known all the wars of Canaan only
[29:43] that the generations of the children of
[29:45] Israel might know to teach them War at
[29:48] least such as before knew nothing
[29:50] thereof namely five Lords of the
[29:52] Philistines and all the Canaanites and
[29:54] the sidonians and the hivites that dwelt
[29:57] dwelt in Mount Lebanon from Mount Bale
[30:00] herum Herman unto the entering in of
[30:03] HTH and they were to prove Israel by
[30:07] them to know whether they would hearken
[30:08] unto the Commandments of the Lord which
[30:11] he commanded their fathers by the hand
[30:13] of Moses amen this is amazing God told
[30:17] them he goes I'll drive out the
[30:18] inhabitants of the land I'll go before
[30:19] you and drive them out and now he gets
[30:21] into the Book of Judges and he says
[30:22] here's the Nations that I left that I
[30:25] let remain amen so so all those to prove
[30:28] those of Israel who were not in the
[30:30] original Wars of Canaan amen so that the
[30:32] Next Generation why so that I could
[30:34] teach them how to war so I could teach
[30:37] them to fight amen and God leaves some
[30:40] things behind Amen to teach us how to
[30:43] fight spiritual
[30:44] battles and and he leaves some things
[30:47] behind in us to teach us how to
[30:51] waren amen we would love for everything
[30:53] to go amen everything from the family
[30:56] tree everything to go away but God
[30:59] leaves some things to teach us how to
[31:01] war because he wants us to always know
[31:04] how to fight spiritual warfare with the
[31:06] sword of the word to take the word to
[31:08] that thing and drive it with a strong
[31:10] hand of Faith to the heart of that and
[31:12] keep driving back the enemy and keep
[31:13] driving about the enemy so we don't
[31:15] forget how to take the word and
[31:17] fight amen why because there's things in
[31:21] US amen there's an open spot in US amen
[31:24] that came through life somewhere through
[31:26] a wound through a hurt through the
[31:28] through the genetics of a mom and dad
[31:30] somehow there's something that came in
[31:32] us an open spot and where the devil can
[31:34] get a punch at us amen and God left it
[31:37] that way to teach us how to
[31:39] war so that we would know how to take
[31:42] the word not emotion not feelings but
[31:45] take the word and defeat the enemy with
[31:47] the word how to resist the devil amen
[31:49] not to resist our brothers and not to
[31:51] resist our spouses but how to resist the
[31:53] devil and see the devil flee amen you
[31:56] see this is this is the thing that he
[31:59] that he wants us to overcome amen and
[32:01] teaches us this war and so we get to
[32:03] fight this battle a lot how many gets to
[32:06] fight a lot all the time amen why so
[32:10] that we're never lazy that we're never
[32:12] dull amen that we that we never because
[32:15] there's more trials coming and more
[32:16] things coming and God is always keeping
[32:18] us sharp amen be this open spot in us
[32:21] that we have to keep covered and God is
[32:24] keeping us sharp so that we can keep
[32:26] fighting amen you know brother
[32:29] brandham he he had these this issue this
[32:32] nervousness this nervous stomach this
[32:34] nervous tension uh uh this getting the
[32:37] blues he had a rejection issue because
[32:39] he was so rejected as a child amen and
[32:41] he had all of these things and he kept
[32:43] dealing with them all the way through
[32:45] his ministry and God trained him by
[32:48] these things and taught him by them and
[32:49] he learned lessons and then he would
[32:51] come to the pulpit and share the lesson
[32:52] with us so that we could learn the
[32:54] lesson am so that what was a we weakness
[32:57] in him and what he suffered with becomes
[32:59] a blessing for
[33:02] us praise be to God brother bam comes
[33:06] through the message standing in the Gap
[33:08] and he begins to relate to us how he had
[33:10] built up a complex because he was
[33:13] rejected because they rejected the
[33:14] message he came amen and he knew he was
[33:17] going to be rejected he preached the
[33:18] seals and he said this will cost 10,000
[33:20] of my friends to leave me is that what
[33:23] he said he knew ahead of time then when
[33:25] they left him he got his feelings hurt
[33:27] and he built up a complex knowing ahead
[33:30] of time they were going to do
[33:32] it you see how see how easy this is as
[33:36] human beings if the prophet could suffer
[33:38] like this we can too and God would use
[33:41] this to teach him a profound
[33:43] lesson and it would be a good lesson for
[33:46] us he says in standing in the Gap I let
[33:48] the sick
[33:50] lay I want the Lord to tell me where to
[33:52] go and not to go that's wrong I built
[33:55] myself a complex cuz the people did
[33:56] didn't hear my message and he actually
[33:59] said if they didn't want to hear it then
[34:01] that's fine they didn't have to and I
[34:03] wasn't going to go out anymore and and
[34:06] then you know he came up with a plan his
[34:07] famous plan to go up and be a Trapper
[34:10] and a hunter and a guide uh up in
[34:12] British
[34:13] Columbia and go help Bud Southwick out
[34:16] and he was going to trick his wife into
[34:17] going you know we know the whole
[34:19] story and he come up with this plan what
[34:22] what was driving him to that rejection
[34:24] and
[34:25] nervousness reject and nervousness that
[34:28] he had plagued with as a child and had
[34:30] been with him in in in his Spirit realm
[34:33] all through
[34:34] life and you know God has
[34:37] left five Lords of the
[34:40] Philistines conscience reasoning
[34:42] affection amen they haven't gone away
[34:46] amen and he's left other nations to see
[34:49] taste smell feel and hear he he's he's
[34:51] left some enemies to keep us how to
[34:54] fight to teach us how to fight cuz a lot
[34:56] of these things are contrary to Faith in
[34:58] the word of God but he's given us
[35:00] something on the inside to fight with
[35:02] and that's Faith to believe his word and
[35:04] to take his word and to fight back not
[35:06] fight reasoning with more reasoning amen
[35:08] not fight with any of these measures but
[35:10] he's teaching us how to fight by the one
[35:12] thing that we can fight with and that's
[35:14] the sixth sense of faith faith in what
[35:17] faith in the word of God so there's five
[35:20] Lords of the Philistines are
[35:22] left he left them behind to teach us how
[35:24] to war right yeah
[35:27] praise be to God cuz brother bam fought
[35:29] his battle and he's gone all the old
[35:32] Fighters that were taking Canaan in the
[35:33] beginning one by one they're going away
[35:36] but there's a new generation and he
[35:37] doesn't want us to forget how to fight
[35:39] so he's going to make sure he's leaving
[35:40] five Lords of the Philistines behind so
[35:43] that we would know to take that word and
[35:45] resist the devil with the word not
[35:48] resisting with reasoning not resisting
[35:50] with anger amen you can't yell the devil
[35:54] away you can't scream the devil away you
[35:57] can't grit your teeth and will him away
[35:59] amen the only thing you can do is resist
[36:01] the devil and resist him with what
[36:03] resist him with the word and take the
[36:06] word and a heart of faith and a strong
[36:08] hand of faith and drive the sword of the
[36:10] word to his heart and keep driving him
[36:12] back amen and what will happen the next
[36:14] day he'll come right back because God
[36:16] wants us to know how to fight spiritual
[36:18] battles with the word because we've
[36:20] tried self-help and it failed we've
[36:22] tried thinking better thoughts it failed
[36:24] we triy a New Year's resolution and it
[36:27] failed the only thing that'll work is
[36:29] the
[36:30] word so God left five Lords of the
[36:32] Philistines so that you would try to
[36:33] make a deal with them in a New Year's
[36:37] resolution and you would try to put them
[36:39] under
[36:40] tribute by turning over a new leaf and
[36:43] and trying a new diet
[36:46] plan right or trying not to be angry or
[36:50] counting to 10 before I
[36:55] speak you see what I'm saying saying it
[36:57] fails it doesn't work and that's all
[37:00] human effort Amen to fight a condition a
[37:02] spiritual condition using a human Spirit
[37:04] human willpower human conscience human
[37:09] reasoning and the only thing that'll
[37:10] drive him back is the
[37:13] word get thee behind me Satan for the
[37:16] word does say
[37:17] amen that's it we've got to take the
[37:20] word and win this battle with the word
[37:22] so God made sure he left five Lords of
[37:24] the Philistines for us to fight brother
[37:28] Benham fought his he overcame now we're
[37:30] going to fight
[37:32] ours further on in standing in the Gap
[37:35] he said God bless you each one and we
[37:38] hope to see you again real soon till
[37:39] then will you do this one favor for me
[37:42] now both here and on tapes also you
[37:45] Brethren pray that God will place into
[37:46] my heart that something that I lost out
[37:48] there in that complex it's so easy to
[37:51] build a
[37:52] complex now listen the way brother B
[37:55] describes this he said said I built
[37:57] myself a
[37:59] complex he didn't inherit it the devil
[38:03] didn't give it to him said I built
[38:05] myself a
[38:08] complex well if you're the one to build
[38:10] it you're the one to tear it
[38:12] down build himself a complex and we got
[38:15] to be careful that we're not building
[38:16] ourselves a complex by nursing hurts and
[38:20] nursing wounds and and rehearsing old
[38:22] hurts and and keep letting the devil
[38:24] keep hitting Us in an open spot over and
[38:26] over and not realize what he's doing and
[38:28] building ourselves a complex and it's
[38:30] really the devil amen using a
[38:32] circumstance to get us in the open spot
[38:34] and we think it's the brother we think
[38:36] it's the sister or the family member or
[38:37] the nextd door neighbor and it's never
[38:40] them you understand it's never them if
[38:42] there's one thing that we can learn it's
[38:44] never my brother my sister it's always
[38:46] the devil that gets in
[38:48] between it's not my spouse my problem is
[38:51] not my spouse my problem is me this war
[38:54] is between me and my enemy amen it's not
[38:57] my enemy is not
[39:00] flesh yes my enemy is not flesh and
[39:03] blood but principalities and powers in
[39:05] Heavenly places we got to fight the
[39:08] right kind of fight CU we keep fighting
[39:09] the wrong kind of fight CU we keep
[39:12] thinking it's the guy at work amen so if
[39:14] I avoid the guy at work I'll be okay
[39:16] because the problem's the guy at work no
[39:18] the problem's not the guy at work the
[39:20] problem is the five Philistines that are
[39:21] left in your land and if it's not that
[39:24] guy at work it'll be the guy next door
[39:26] or the guy in front of you in line at
[39:28] the car washer somebody is going to find
[39:30] the devil's going to use somebody to
[39:32] find that open spot and put pressure on
[39:34] you to cause that same kind of failure
[39:36] it's not the guy at work amen it's you
[39:39] amen it's the devil working on your
[39:42] flesh amen the weaknesses that are there
[39:44] through through whatever through
[39:46] genetics or through your childhood
[39:47] they're there Amen brother brandom have
[39:50] them we've got them and now we got to
[39:52] start fighting back by the word if not
[39:55] the devil's always going to get us going
[39:56] in circles and circles and circles anden
[39:58] we're going to be tired and defeated and
[40:01] spiritually
[40:02] weakened until we recognize what the
[40:04] real battle
[40:06] is brother benam was recognizing said
[40:11] it's so easy to build a
[40:13] complex you know what happened he wasn't
[40:15] blaming anybody else for his complex he
[40:19] wasn't blaming the people that didn't
[40:20] listen to his message he wasn't blaming
[40:23] the rejection he wasn't blaming his
[40:25] childhood he wasn't blaming anything
[40:26] else for his complex he was finally
[40:28] owning it and said I buil up a
[40:30] complex and God's got to help me then he
[40:34] goes down the next thing he says he
[40:35] talks about brother wey he said I had a
[40:37] interview the other day with my brother
[40:39] wey sitting here standing here in front
[40:42] a good man but built his around the
[40:46] complex now now he's not just pointing

[40:55] spot
[40:58] yeah I mean it we love brother Brenham
[41:00] being honest but how would you like it
[41:01] if he was honest I just met him in an
[41:03] interview and now I'm going to tell
[41:05] everybody in the whole church what we
[41:06] were talking about in the interview he's
[41:07] got himself a complex he built himself
[41:09] around a
[41:12] complex praise the
[41:14] Lord he
[41:16] says he said a good man but built
[41:19] himself around a complex another kind of
[41:21] a complex did the same thing brother way
[41:23] you can so easily do it it's you just
[41:26] get a little something in your mind keep
[41:29] thinking that way go back and check it
[41:32] with the scriptures God and see if it's
[41:34] right or not and then go from there yeah
[41:37] don't lose that feeling of the people
[41:39] you must remember they're not made out
[41:41] of sawdust they're flesh and blood human
[41:43] beings and a soul pray for me all of you
[41:46] if you will God bless you now so brother
[41:49] M's asking the people to pray for him to
[41:50] help him because I need to get back
[41:52] something I've lost in building up this
[41:53] complex I've lost a feeling for the
[41:55] people and then he goes out and he
[41:57] points out brother way and that's
[42:00] important that'll be more important here
[42:01] in a minute why he points out brother
[42:03] way and what happens next cuz most of
[42:04] you know just after that just a minute
[42:07] or two after that he falls over in a
[42:08] heart attack
[42:10] dead I mean Brian might if I keep
[42:17] going or Donovan he's he's in a better
[42:19] spot that's about where brother wey was
[42:22] but you
[42:23] know all of a sudden he falls out dead
[42:26] and brother bham goes down there and
[42:28] he's been preaching about complex and
[42:30] losing the feeling for the people he
[42:31] points out brother way and brother way
[42:33] under the shock Amen brother bam says in
[42:35] the next service under the shock of
[42:36] hearing that he fell over brother Bram
[42:38] goes down and calls for his life to come
[42:40] back and he comes back to
[42:42] life and brother Brenham says that was
[42:45] to confirm that he hadn't left me and
[42:46] the ministry was to keep going brother
[42:49] bam repents in front of everybody will
[42:50] you all pray for me I got to get out of
[42:52] this complex he points out brother way
[42:54] he got the same thing all the sudden a
[42:56] minute or two later he falls over dead
[42:58] brother bham goes down and prays for him
[42:59] in the next service brother Bram said
[43:01] see he did that for me to confirm that
[43:03] he hadn't left me and the ministry
[43:05] wasn't over and he wants me to keep
[43:07] praying for the
[43:08] sick see God God's not here to punish us
[43:12] and put us on the back burner and God's
[43:14] here to use us amen but but he wants us
[43:16] to fight this good fight amen he wants
[43:19] us to overcome these
[43:24] things amen if if we could pull up the
[43:27] overhead or the PowerPoint I just want
[43:29] to I want to look at something this is
[43:31] the real the real thing that I wanted to
[43:33] get to us
[43:35] tonight this is where the Lord has
[43:38] really dropped something in my
[43:41] heart brother bham he tells this story
[43:45] and standing in the
[43:47] Gap he tells us that he had a dream and
[43:49] in that dream he and Fletcher Bry which
[43:53] is his brother-in-law which was an
[43:54] alcoholic and he was a bum buming around
[43:56] and in the dream brother Brenham was
[43:59] looking for Fletch and he found him in
[44:01] an old dump you know and there was
[44:03] ditches in there and they were had a
[44:04] fire going these bums gathering around
[44:06] and and uh Fletch was trying to find a
[44:08] place for both of them to lay down and
[44:10] sleep and he woke up and he thought
[44:11] maybe Fletch need help and he went
[44:13] looking for him and he found him and it
[44:14] wasn't it so brother Brandon moved on
[44:16] and and then he had this idea you know
[44:18] he's getting this complex because he's
[44:20] upset at the rejection because the
[44:22] people didn't hear his message and he
[44:23] goes I felt they ought to well I feel
[44:26] like they ought to as
[44:27] well but he got this complex and and
[44:30] he's driving along and he's mulling over
[44:32] this idea they stop at a cafe and you
[44:35] know he sees a he sees an old version of
[44:38] Fletch and an old version of himself
[44:40] even Billy Paul when they stand at the
[44:41] pace said dad that looks like you and
[44:43] fles and brother R said something in my
[44:46] heart
[44:47] jumped and he saw them two old bums dirt
[44:50] over their face from standing over a
[44:52] fire just got a cup of coffee and
[44:54] something just for a little bit of
[44:55] change they moved on and he got in the
[44:57] car to drive and Billy Paul fell asleep
[44:59] and all of a sudden he got this real
[45:01] funny feeling something come over him
[45:02] and he had to pull over and stopped and
[45:05] when he stopped the Lord told him to
[45:06] look and he saw this mountain
[45:08] range and here's what he said he said I
[45:10] stopped and I looked up on the mountain
[45:12] and I seen those Seven Hills now here if
[45:15] you want to see something there was
[45:17] Seven Peaks on top of the mountain one
[45:19] mountain that ran for several miles the
[45:22] last Mountain before you go into the
[45:23] other country no more Mountains after
[45:25] that
[45:26] and it was running from east to the West
[45:28] the mountain set and it was snow capped
[45:31] on top the first two small Peaks then a
[45:34] large Peak then another small Peak then
[45:35] a larger Peak then a small Peak then a
[45:37] great large long snowcap mountain and I
[45:40] said Lord I do not understand what that
[45:42] means he said how many Peaks are there I
[45:45] said there's seven how many letters in
[45:47] your name b r a n h a m m a r r i o n b
[45:54] r a n n hm
[45:59] 777 you think he wasn't ordained to be
[46:01] the seventh Church age
[46:03] messenger William seven Mariam seven
[46:07] brandom seven and if you go and look at
[46:10] his house on euwing Lane I drew drove by
[46:12] it not too long ago when we had the
[46:13] brothers from Poland here we went down
[46:15] Jeffersonville and I drove by it and all
[46:17] of a sudden it just struck me I'm
[46:18] looking at his front door and if you
[46:20] look over brother B's front entry door
[46:22] there's a there's a sharp Peak on the
[46:24] roof and the the left side only goes
[46:26] halfway down and the the right side is
[46:28] double the length he's got a number
[46:30] seven right over his front
[46:35] door boy that was a coincidence no
[46:38] because that's going to be the house for
[46:39] the seventh Church age
[46:41] messenger the seventh
[46:43] angel God had ordained it when he was
[46:45] building the house amen I can't remember
[46:47] it was like 50 or 51 something like that
[46:49] when he got the money to build that
[46:51] house so his early 50s before he had an
[46:53] understanding of the seven Church ages
[46:55] the seven Church Church age messenger
[46:56] all of that he built the house and when
[46:58] they built the house there's a perfect
[47:00] seven laying right over his front entry
[47:02] door because God knew he was the seventh
[47:06] angel before he knew he was the seventh
[47:08] angel his name is William Marian
[47:10] brandham 777 before before his mom and
[47:13] dad or anybody else knew he was the
[47:15] seventh angel God knew he was the
[47:17] seventh angel and before way back how
[47:20] long back I don't know he set this
[47:22] mountain range here and in this mountain
[47:24] range had seven Pig and brother bam says
[47:26] I don't understand he says how many
[47:29] letters in your
[47:30] name seven how many Peaks
[47:34] seven brother B said and there was three
[47:36] outstanding Peaks he said those three
[47:38] Peaks are the first second and third
[47:40] pool the first one was your first part
[47:43] of your ministry small hill then your
[47:45] first pool pretty high you know sign in
[47:48] the hand and then there was a little
[47:49] interval in there the time that I was
[47:51] taken off from being too
[47:52] tired many of you remember it and then
[47:55] come come the discernment the second
[47:56] pool now I've had another about a few
[47:58] years here of just kind of little Peak
[48:00] SE back like my Ministry wasn't yet and
[48:02] then come the third one three is a
[48:05] number of completion see the third one
[48:06] the next Peak was five number of Grace
[48:08] the next Peak was seven number of
[48:10] perfection six days shall you labor the
[48:13] seventh is the Sabbath the end of the
[48:15] week the end of time and I stopped and I
[48:17] showed it to Billy and I looked at them
[48:19] he said that let that stand if there
[48:22] ever was a doubt in your mind remember
[48:24] this place come back back here
[48:27] am so brother bam is he's in the middle
[48:31] of his nervousness of his rejection of a
[48:35] complex planning on running away from
[48:37] the ministry upset those that didn't
[48:39] hear and God's driving him down the
[48:41] right Road the right road to have this
[48:44] internal conflict he's having an
[48:47] internal conflict at the right time and
[48:50] he's driving down the right road coming
[48:52] from Canada down through Montana I think
[48:54] he's going to Arizona he amen God timing
[48:57] is impeccable and brother R had no idea
[49:00] that he was going through a conflict at
[49:01] the right
[49:03] time because he had to be here at the
[49:06] time he was going through that so he
[49:08] could see that because that was going to
[49:10] be the answer to his
[49:12] problem and so here's another picture of
[49:15] of these Seven
[49:17] Peaks and brother bam said there was the
[49:20] first High one kind of high pretty high
[49:22] he said there was the first pull and the
[49:24] second pool and then the third pool and
[49:27] from there it went on out amen and it
[49:30] said that was that was the three pools
[49:31] of my Ministry and the Lord told him his
[49:34] name is wrote in there Amen brother
[49:36] brenham's name is in this
[49:38] mountain your name is there your
[49:41] ministry is there your life is
[49:45] there my question is when did that get
[49:50] there when was that put there how long
[49:54] ago did God put those Peaks there how
[49:56] did he shape them how did he get them to
[49:58] look like that how did he get the three
[50:00] High ones how did he get the ones in
[50:01] between how did he how did he get it how
[50:04] long did it take and how long it had
[50:06] been standing there waiting for the
[50:07] moment when a prophet under turmoil
[50:10] after he preached the Seven Seals after
[50:12] he knew he was a seven Church age
[50:13] messenger after he knew he was
[50:15] Revelations 10:7 coming down the road in
[50:17] distress with a complex we get the right
[50:20] place at the right time and how long did
[50:22] it take to get him to get that exactly
[50:24] that way and in that place and how long
[50:27] had it been sitting
[50:29] there amen it's a good
[50:32] question it's a good
[50:36] question but look
[50:39] here there was a low
[50:42] spot and brother benam said that's when
[50:44] I had to leave the ministry and go off
[50:46] the field because it got too tired
[50:49] remember this and he said I made a
[50:52] mistake he said I was praying too long
[50:54] for the sick I'd stay one time eight
[50:56] days at the pull pit praying for the
[50:58] sick and just sleep behind the pull pit
[51:00] take a little food and go back and he
[51:02] said I learned that was a mistake I
[51:03] wasn't to do it that
[51:05] way so he makes he comes out with a sign
[51:09] in the hand a Healing Ministry and he
[51:12] makes a mistake with it and he gets too
[51:15] worn down and too tired and that nervous
[51:17] condition kicks up and his stomach issue
[51:19] comes back and he has to leave the field
[51:22] for a while because of all this problem
[51:26] and brother Brandon would talk about you
[51:28] know I'd made a mistake and i' gotten
[51:30] too tired but listen friends the low
[51:33] spot was already in the mountain
[51:35] range it was already there his life was
[51:39] already depicted his life was already
[51:41] told he said first that little hill
[51:44] going up in the ministry then you got
[51:45] the first pull then that low interval
[51:47] where I got too tired and then it come
[51:49] back in the second pool and then it kind
[51:51] of levels off like nothing going on in
[51:53] my Ministry like it's not yet and then
[51:55] that third big one that goes on off into
[51:57] eternity he said my his ministry his
[51:59] life was already in that mountain range
[52:02] amen I want to ask you could he skip the
[52:04] low spot no way could he have skipped
[52:07] the low spot could he have figured out a
[52:10] better way to administer the ministry
[52:12] could he have done a better job amen
[52:14] could he have learned a little
[52:17] faster Hallelujah friends what does this
[52:20] mean for us it means God's got it all
[52:22] under control he knows the end from the
[52:24] beginning he knows the low spots he
[52:27] knows the high spots he knows what he's
[52:28] going to do with you he knew what was in
[52:30] your grandmother great grandmother your
[52:32] grandmother your great grandfather to
[52:34] get it down to get a certain Ting out of
[52:35] you and he knows the bad baggage that
[52:37] came with it amen he knew there'd be a
[52:40] prophet driving down this road in the
[52:42] middle of a complex amen and the I mean
[52:45] he's right preaching in the third peak
[52:47] of his ministry and he's in turmoil on a
[52:50] complex amen because of rejection from a
[52:52] child and from a nervous condition and
[52:54] he's driving down the the road and God
[52:56] knew when he would hit that spot and he
[52:58] said stop
[52:59] here I got something I want to show
[53:02] you praise God I already knew all about
[53:06] it I knew about the low times the high
[53:09] times I knew all about it and it's all
[53:13] under
[53:15] control yes and Billy Paul
[53:19] says let that stand there's ever a doubt
[53:22] in your mind come back to this
[53:25] and remind yourself of
[53:28] this I don't know if there's a mountain
[53:30] range with my life in it we're not the
[53:33] message for the age I don't know if
[53:34] there's a mountain range for your life
[53:35] but I know one thing if you're a Seed of
[53:37] Abraham there's a star in the heaven
[53:39] that designates you and that star is
[53:41] already in position that star is already
[53:44] set it's already part of a constellation
[53:46] it's already it's already telling a
[53:48] story it's already positionally placed
[53:49] and it was set there before at the
[53:51] foundation of the world when he set the
[53:53] heavens amen before there was anything
[53:55] going on on Earth you were positionally
[53:57] placed in the heavens and nothing will
[53:59] take you out of your position the story
[54:02] has already been wrote amen we got to
[54:04] come here to make our choice on free
[54:06] moral agency but he already knows the
[54:08] end from the
[54:10] beginning we've got to suffer through
[54:12] some things to learn some things we
[54:14] couldn't have learned these things as
[54:16] Angel Angelic beings in heaven amen
[54:18] never having a fall never having
[54:20] nervousness never having a complex never
[54:22] having rejection never having any of
[54:24] these issues there things about the
[54:26] nature of God we can never realize and
[54:28] there's things about evil that we can
[54:29] never realize but God has allowed the
[54:33] backdrop of black in our lives so that
[54:35] white will stand out so that when we
[54:37] finally amen when this life is over and
[54:39] we're restored into that Fellowship we
[54:41] will have an understanding and
[54:43] appreciation we can never have any other
[54:45] way we will have a learn this is our
[54:47] school amen this is where we get our
[54:49] education this is where we learn about
[54:51] God and this is where we learn to stand
[54:53] on the word and the word only
[54:56] and through this life amen God knew
[54:59] before the foundation of the world that
[55:01] Adam and Eve would
[55:04] fall why because he knew whenever he
[55:07] built this mountain range he knew
[55:08] brother benam would hit a low spot
[55:10] between the first and second
[55:12] pool and before the foundation of the
[55:15] world when he knew that Jesus Christ was
[55:17] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[55:18] the world and he wrote names in a book
[55:21] of the lamb slain before the foundation
[55:22] of the world he knew that there would
[55:24] need to be lamb that would be slain why
[55:26] would you need a slain lamb because his
[55:28] children were going to fall requiring a
[55:30] slain lamb so before they fell he
[55:33] already made a provision for the fall
[55:35] because he knew they would
[55:38] fall brother B said he put them on a
[55:40] free moral agency knowing that they
[55:43] would make the wrong choice he couldn't
[55:45] make them do it and be righteous amen
[55:48] but he could give them ability to choose
[55:50] they would choose wrong amen why because
[55:52] there was something in the master plan
[55:54] that had to unfold because there had to
[55:56] be a lesson that we all would learn we
[55:58] had to come Fallen we had to come failed
[56:01] we had to have complexes we had to have
[56:03] problems we had to fight with
[56:05] ourselves so that we would know more
[56:07] about God in his
[56:10] word so he's left some Philistine five
[56:12] Philistine Lords in your spirit realm so
[56:16] that you wouldn't forget how to
[56:18] fight and he wants us to fight amen he
[56:21] wants us to fight and he wants us to win
[56:25] but listen he already knows the low
[56:28] spots he already knew what would happen
[56:30] in the Garden of Eden he already knew it
[56:34] he's the one who planted the
[56:36] tree of Good and Evil in the garden and
[56:41] the tree of life and he's the one who
[56:44] put Adam
[56:47] there he didn't make him do anything but
[56:49] he knew what they would do because it
[56:50] would work out for his plan why cuz
[56:53] there was a Lamb's Book Book of Life of
[56:55] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[56:58] the
[57:00] world praise be to
[57:03] God they go on they're standing at the
[57:06] road and they're looking at this and
[57:08] Billy Paul Taps him on the shoulder and
[57:10] says hey if you're ever in doubt come
[57:11] back here remember this God knows all
[57:15] about it your name's in the mountain
[57:17] your ministry is in the
[57:19] mountain then he looked on the other
[57:21] side of the
[57:23] road he said and Billy punched me on the
[57:26] shoulder he said Daddy look Eastward and
[57:28] how it ever happened I don't know but
[57:30] there on the east side of the road was
[57:32] that burning dump the same one from his
[57:36] dream where him and Fletch were in miles
[57:39] and miles from any kind of a city an old
[57:41] rubbish Heap dunch laying there on the
[57:43] left hand side of the road how he said
[57:45] how it was I don't know there was that
[57:48] burning dump the one from his dream and
[57:51] here God brings him right in between
[57:54] he's looking here at the mountain range
[57:56] he's looking here at the old dump and
[57:59] God had already told him if you go that
[58:00] way your wife will leave you blah blah
[58:02] blah all these things will happen to you
[58:03] and here he stands and he looks at that
[58:05] and he and he's rejoicing in what the
[58:07] Lord telling him and he looks over and
[58:09] there's the dump and brother brandom
[58:11] says and I'm going back on the
[58:13] field he knew what God wanted him to do
[58:16] he knew the choice to make by God's
[58:18] grace he showed him that it's all under
[58:20] control I've already decided son now
[58:23] it's your turn to de side I've already
[58:27] told the story now it's your turn to act
[58:29] out the story I've already seen it all
[58:32] now it's your turn to make the right
[58:33] choice remember Sunday we said when
[58:36] Danny Henry prophesied amen over brother
[58:38] bam he says you have chose the harder
[58:40] way you have chose the Narrow Path he
[58:42] said you have done this at your own
[58:45] choosing he said but it's the right
[58:47] choice it is my way so brother brandham
[58:52] had to pick God's way but he had had to
[58:55] have the freedom to make the choice and
[58:57] he made the choice he chose the harder
[58:59] way the narrow way but it was the right
[59:01] choice and it was God's
[59:04] choice and we are here on Earth to make
[59:07] God's choice we're here to make choices
[59:10] we've got choices we've got to make but
[59:12] we're here amen with something inside of
[59:15] us that was there when the whole scene
[59:17] was played out there's something in us
[59:19] that was in the mind of God when God
[59:20] fashioned the whole
[59:22] story and that's something in us and
[59:24] amen is is is not is not a flesh amen
[59:28] and something in US comes from God from
[59:30] the mind of God Amen was there when
[59:32] everything was played out but now it's
[59:34] in us moving us according to the word
[59:37] and mean guiding us giving us Faith to
[59:39] believe the word and now we've got to
[59:41] make a choice not off of the senses but
[59:44] by faith yes now we've got to come to
[59:48] this place where we
[59:49] recognize when you look up at the stars
[59:52] at night may it be like brother brother
[59:54] brand I'm looking at this mountain range
[59:57] say I don't know which one it is I don't
[59:59] know if it's a bright one a faint one I
[1:00:01] don't know if I can see it from here or
[1:00:02] not see it from here but one of them
[1:00:04] stars represent me because I'm a son of
[1:00:07] Abraham and as long as that star stays
[1:00:10] in its position amen nothing's changing
[1:00:13] with my position in Christ God already
[1:00:16] knew when he put that star there that I
[1:00:18] would come forth now and that star's
[1:00:21] position tells a story and that story
[1:00:23] has the story of my life written in it
[1:00:25] amen I don't know it I can't understand
[1:00:28] it but I'm living it out in Jesus
[1:00:30] Christ's name we've got to have
[1:00:32] confidence in those things we got to
[1:00:34] believe it amen because things are going
[1:00:37] to go
[1:00:39] wrong things are going to go wrong might
[1:00:42] as well get used to it things are going
[1:00:44] to go wrong because when when God
[1:00:47] designed this mountain range when he
[1:00:50] dumped it there when he when he pushed
[1:00:52] the plates together whatever he had to
[1:00:55] do to cause this range to come up and
[1:00:57] shape it through erosion he designed it
[1:00:59] with a dip between the first and second
[1:01:02] pool because he knew there would be a
[1:01:04] dip between the first and second
[1:01:08] pool and brother B said it was his fault
[1:01:11] his mistake but his mistake was
[1:01:14] according to God's
[1:01:16] plan I can't explain that I just know
[1:01:19] it's the
[1:01:22] truth that that dip was there before
[1:01:25] brother Brenham made his
[1:01:28] mistake and those two things his
[1:01:30] decision there and that dip have to go
[1:01:32] together I don't understand that but
[1:01:35] it's the
[1:01:37] truth we went through hard times but
[1:01:40] were they out of the will of
[1:01:42] God we've we've done made decisions that
[1:01:45] caus us to suffer the children of Israel
[1:01:48] Jacob's sons they made a decision that
[1:01:50] caused them to suffer and it caused
[1:01:52] their father to suffer they decided out
[1:01:55] of jealousy and hatred for their brother
[1:01:57] Joseph they decided to sell him into
[1:01:59] slavery and they sold him in the bondage
[1:02:01] and he went down and he suffered
[1:02:03] miserably under that bondage and finally
[1:02:05] was exalted to the right hand of pharaoh
[1:02:07] amen and then years later there was a
[1:02:09] famine that come CU God is the master of
[1:02:11] circumstances there was a famine that
[1:02:13] come in the land and the only solution
[1:02:15] that they had to stay alive was to go
[1:02:17] down to Egypt amen and the person that
[1:02:19] was in charge of all the Grain in Egypt
[1:02:22] happened to be the same brother that
[1:02:23] they hated in despised and sold into
[1:02:26] slavery it was their choice God couldn't
[1:02:29] make them do it they had to choose but
[1:02:32] their choice was telling the whole story
[1:02:34] of redemption right there in the Book of
[1:02:36] Genesis amen because they the Brethren
[1:02:39] the Jews amen they would hate Jesus
[1:02:41] Christ amen they would sell him out for
[1:02:43] silver amen he would go down into the
[1:02:45] dungeon he would be exalted on the
[1:02:46] throne on high and in the process he
[1:02:48] would marry a gentile bride and in due
[1:02:51] time amen when there was a famine
[1:02:53] spiritual famine in the land they would
[1:02:54] come looking for grain and they would
[1:02:56] come to Joseph and Joseph would send his
[1:02:59] wife to the Palace so that he could
[1:03:01] reveal himself to his
[1:03:02] [Applause]
[1:03:03] Brethren hallelujah how did all that
[1:03:05] happen there was human beings with
[1:03:07] complexes and hatreds and jealousy
[1:03:10] making decisions and those decisions
[1:03:12] they looked at was a mistake and it was
[1:03:14] a mistake and they suffered for it they
[1:03:17] sold their brother into slavery and then
[1:03:19] shortly after the whole nation's in
[1:03:21] slavery for 400
[1:03:23] years God keeps Good Records friends
[1:03:26] don't
[1:03:27] worry but when they get to the end of
[1:03:29] the story they they they find out this
[1:03:31] is Joseph they said oh now he'll slay us
[1:03:33] they were afraid and he says don't be
[1:03:35] afraid he said you meant it for evil
[1:03:39] your choice you meant it for evil but
[1:03:41] God meant it for
[1:03:44] good the same evil choice that they
[1:03:47] meant for evil God meant that same
[1:03:51] choice that was based off
[1:03:53] jealousy and
[1:03:55] hatred envy and strife amongst brothers
[1:03:59] that was that was the the motivation to
[1:04:02] make their choice because God meant that
[1:04:05] choice to be for
[1:04:08] good why because a couple thousand years
[1:04:11] later the Son of God is going to be
[1:04:13] there the one with the rainbow Covenant
[1:04:16] coat amen and he's going to be rejected
[1:04:18] and sold for silver and put down in the
[1:04:20] dungeon and he's going to be exalted on
[1:04:22] high and he's going to marry a gentile
[1:04:23] and he's going to come back and reveal
[1:04:25] himself to his
[1:04:28] Brethren praise be to
[1:04:31] God you know some of those past things
[1:04:33] we look back on our life the decisions
[1:04:34] we made they were wrong they were
[1:04:36] mistakes we repent of that but some of
[1:04:39] those things were tools that God used to
[1:04:41] get us where we are now some of those
[1:04:44] things are tools that God has used Amen
[1:04:47] to get us to move in his program
[1:04:49] according to his will to the place he
[1:04:51] wants us to be and we look at back of
[1:04:53] those things and we and we shudder at
[1:04:55] what we did amen but now it's time to
[1:04:57] say whatever has been has been I'm
[1:05:00] moving on with
[1:05:01] Christ I'm not going to let the devil
[1:05:03] destroy me amen because of what has been
[1:05:06] God's in control of all things he's
[1:05:08] worked everything out for his good and
[1:05:10] I'm in the place I am in the place of
[1:05:13] God and he knows the way that I take and
[1:05:15] when I am tried I shall come forth as
[1:05:17] gold praise God Amen why I was gold when
[1:05:21] I came into the trial I'll be gold when
[1:05:23] I come out of the trial I will just have
[1:05:25] some impurities moved out of
[1:05:29] me praise God let's look at Hebrews
[1:05:33] chapter
[1:05:43] 4 the book of Hebrews chapter
[1:05:53] 4 verse three for we which have believed
[1:05:56] do enter into rest as he said as I have
[1:05:59] sworn in my wrath if they shall enter
[1:06:01] into my rest although the works were
[1:06:03] finished from the foundation of the
[1:06:05] world he's imploring you to enter into
[1:06:08] the rest although he knows where you're
[1:06:09] going to wind up the works were finished
[1:06:11] before the foundation of the
[1:06:13] world let's look at
[1:06:15] Acts chapter
[1:06:23] n Acts chapter 9 verse1
[1:06:34] 15 but the Lord said unto him go thy way
[1:06:38] for he's a chosen vessel he's speaking
[1:06:40] to ananas concerning Saul who will
[1:06:43] become the Apostle Paul for he's a
[1:06:45] chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name
[1:06:47] before the Gentiles and Kings and the
[1:06:48] children of Israel for I will show him
[1:06:51] how great things he must suffer for my
[1:06:54] name's
[1:06:57] sake before he suffered God knew he
[1:07:00] would
[1:07:02] suffer and God says I will show him what
[1:07:04] great things he must suffer for my
[1:07:06] name's sake and and Saul could not say
[1:07:09] is this
[1:07:10] negotiable I mean what if I don't make
[1:07:12] any mistakes what if I'm a good boy what
[1:07:15] if I do things right God had already
[1:07:17] ordained it had to be this way and it
[1:07:20] was going to be this way so let's look
[1:07:23] at what Paul says about this in 2
[1:07:26] Corinthians I just want to look at his
[1:07:28] attitude because it means it means the
[1:07:30] world to me this is the attitude I
[1:07:32] really want to
[1:07:34] have
[1:07:36] 11:23 2 Corinthians
[1:07:47] 11:23 are they Ministers of Christ I
[1:07:50] speak as a fool I am more and labors
[1:07:53] more abundant and in Stripes above
[1:07:54] measure in prisons more frequent in
[1:07:57] deaths of of the Jews five times
[1:08:00] received I 40 Stripes save one Thrice
[1:08:02] was I beaten with rods once was I stoned
[1:08:05] Thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and
[1:08:07] a day I have spent in the Deep now this
[1:08:09] isn't a resume I would turn into an
[1:08:11] employer this isn't a list of
[1:08:13] accomplishments we would normally be
[1:08:15] looking at as a good thing to talk about
[1:08:17] but he was told before he was showed
[1:08:19] before what things he must suffer for
[1:08:20] his name's sake he knew he was going to
[1:08:22] suffer and he agreed to go
[1:08:25] anyways 26 in journeyings often in
[1:08:28] Perils of water and Perils of robbers
[1:08:30] and perils by my own
[1:08:32] countrymen and perils by the Heathen and
[1:08:34] perils in the city and perils in the
[1:08:36] wilderness and perils in the sea and
[1:08:38] perils among false Brethren and
[1:08:40] weariness and painfulness and watchings
[1:08:42] often in hunger and thirst and fastings
[1:08:44] often in cold and nakedness beside those
[1:08:47] things that are without that which
[1:08:49] cometh upon me daily the care of all the
[1:08:51] churches who is weak and I am not not
[1:08:53] weak who is offended and I burn not if I
[1:08:56] mean must needs Glory I will glory of
[1:08:59] the things which concern my
[1:09:01] infirmities he goes on down to chapter
[1:09:03] 12: 7 we go over the next chapter verse
[1:09:06] 7 and lest I should be exalted above
[1:09:08] measure through the abundance of the
[1:09:10] Revelation there was given to me a thorn
[1:09:12] in the flesh the messenger of Satan to
[1:09:14] Buffet me lest I should be exalted above
[1:09:17] measure for this thing I besought the
[1:09:19] Lord Thrice that it might depart from me
[1:09:21] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:09:23] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[1:09:25] made perfect in weakness most gladly
[1:09:28] therefore will I rather glory in my
[1:09:30] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[1:09:32] rest upon me therefore I take no
[1:09:34] pleasure in infirmities and reproaches
[1:09:37] and necessities and persecutions I take
[1:09:39] pleasure in infirmities and reproaches
[1:09:41] and necessities and persecutions in
[1:09:43] distresses for Christ's sake for when I
[1:09:45] am weak then am I
[1:09:48] strong Paul had been told you're going
[1:09:51] to suffer he knew it was already written
[1:09:53] into the
[1:09:54] script and when he walked into it he
[1:09:57] said now I will glory in these things
[1:09:59] because Christ is getting some Glory out
[1:10:01] of this he told me ahead it had to be
[1:10:03] this way if it has to be this way then
[1:10:05] I'm willing to walk this way and not be
[1:10:07] ashamed of it but I will glory in it I'm
[1:10:10] weak I am beat up I am cast about I'm
[1:10:13] rejected I'm all of these things but
[1:10:15] praise be to God he's more than enough
[1:10:17] for me and it's still according to his
[1:10:19] plan I mean can we say that I I have had
[1:10:22] trouble upon trouble I've had problem
[1:10:24] after problem but praise be to God he
[1:10:26] knew the Low Places before the
[1:10:28] foundation of the world I'm suffering
[1:10:30] because of my own decisions but hey
[1:10:32] brother brandham suffered because of his
[1:10:33] own decision but it was written in the
[1:10:36] mountain it was cast in
[1:10:39] stone before he was born before he made
[1:10:42] the choice it was already written in
[1:10:44] stone unmovable unshakable written in
[1:10:47] stone it had to happen these things has
[1:10:50] to be this way some of the things we
[1:10:53] walk through amen we just got to go
[1:10:55] through there's something we have to
[1:10:56] learn and this is the only way we can
[1:10:58] learn it there's something we have to
[1:11:00] portray there's something we have to
[1:11:02] display of the nature of Christ and this
[1:11:04] is the only way to do it and if that's
[1:11:06] the way God wants it then we have to
[1:11:08] start gloring in
[1:11:10] infirmities we have to start gloring
[1:11:12] that when I'm weak he's strong amen when
[1:11:14] I'm rejected amen he's accepted praise
[1:11:17] be to God whatever I have to go through
[1:11:19] to live this life it was scripted before
[1:11:22] the footsteps of the righteous or order
[1:11:24] of the Lord and He delighted in his way
[1:11:26] and I want to have the right attitude to
[1:11:28] say thanks be to God who keeps me
[1:11:30] through all
[1:11:31] trouble not always trying to get out of
[1:11:34] it or go around it or build a complex
[1:11:37] because of it but to say these things
[1:11:39] must need to be this way and if that's
[1:11:42] what God ordained for me then I want to
[1:11:45] say I love you Lord cuz your plan is
[1:11:48] perfect amen
[1:11:52] hallelujah I I don't know about you but
[1:11:55] I have never been able to scream at the
[1:11:59] Devil to change my
[1:12:01] circumstances to talk mean and nasty to
[1:12:03] him and to call him names right it has
[1:12:06] never changed my
[1:12:08] circumstances getting angry with him and
[1:12:10] shaking my fist at him or stomping him
[1:12:12] under my foot or calling him a dirty old
[1:12:14] nasty scoundrel has changed nothing in
[1:12:16] my
[1:12:18] life but the only thing that ever
[1:12:20] brought A Change Is to submit to what
[1:12:22] God wants and amen repent if I need to
[1:12:25] repent and take up the sword of the word
[1:12:26] and keep marching forward that's the
[1:12:28] only thing that has ever worked to
[1:12:29] defeat the Devil in my life is when I
[1:12:31] keep moving forward in the plan of God
[1:12:37] Amen praise be to God brother B says in
[1:12:41] questions and answers 1964 he said now
[1:12:44] in other words when you become a young
[1:12:46] man or a young woman and like God takes
[1:12:48] a picture of you now no matter how old
[1:12:50] or wrinkled how disfigured whatever it
[1:12:52] may be
[1:12:54] that that will wind right on down
[1:12:55] through and the body may be destroyed
[1:12:57] disfigured burnt eat up by lions
[1:12:59] whatever it is but it was made up of
[1:13:01] gases 16 elements of the earth it's
[1:13:03] calcium and potach petroleum and Cosmic
[1:13:05] light and so forth all goes together to
[1:13:07] make up the body now no matter that's
[1:13:10] the whole Earth is filled with that but
[1:13:12] now this picture is the main thing then
[1:13:15] in the resurrection those gases and acid
[1:13:17] and things come right back into the
[1:13:19] place and develops this picture again
[1:13:22] now this picture was not taken when you
[1:13:24] were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your
[1:13:27] best when was it taken before there was
[1:13:30] a foundation of the world it was put in
[1:13:32] God's Great
[1:13:33] file he's saying the picture of you at
[1:13:36] 181 19 or 20 was taken and put in God's
[1:13:38] Great file when before the foundation of
[1:13:41] the world and then the only thing it did
[1:13:44] was featured itself here for you to make
[1:13:46] your choice see then you become a
[1:13:49] servant of God him for knowing it makes
[1:13:51] him a redeemer as we been through it
[1:13:54] then that picture is absolutely this is
[1:13:57] the negative the negative part of life
[1:13:59] is where you live now and anything if
[1:14:01] there's a negative there's got to be a
[1:14:03] positive before there can be a negative
[1:14:04] therefore if this is a negative there's
[1:14:06] got to be a positive somewhere and this
[1:14:09] ain't the real thing this is only a
[1:14:10] foreshadow of the real thing that is to
[1:14:13] come now you got it so I don't care what
[1:14:16] they would do with you they cannot
[1:14:18] destroy that file
[1:14:21] amen it doesn't matter who says what who
[1:14:24] does what what actions taken it doesn't
[1:14:27] matter what happens in your life it
[1:14:29] cannot destroy that file God God has a
[1:14:33] fireproof safe he's got a bulletproof
[1:14:36] safe he's got anything proof safe and
[1:14:39] when he dropped that file of you and the
[1:14:41] picture of what you will be in a
[1:14:43] glorified condition amen and shut that
[1:14:45] file drawer it's safe and secure you
[1:14:48] will wind up in the place he's already
[1:14:50] filed away where you will be what you'll
[1:14:52] be like it's ordained to happen nothing
[1:14:55] here is going to change what's in that
[1:14:57] file in fact our life has already been
[1:14:59] written out to depict certain things
[1:15:01] that have to be portrayed in a
[1:15:03] Redemption story and we're going to have
[1:15:05] to live it out whether it's comfortable
[1:15:06] or uncomfortable whether it's Pleasant
[1:15:08] or unpleasant there are certain things
[1:15:10] we have to live out for us and for
[1:15:14] God but the key is to have the right
[1:15:16] attitude when we live it out to
[1:15:18] recognize that that picture has already
[1:15:21] been taken and it's already been filed
[1:15:23] way nothing's changing with God and
[1:15:25] nothing's changing between me and God
[1:15:28] this is just something he ordained for
[1:15:30] me to walk through and I want to do it
[1:15:33] the way Jesus Christ would walk through
[1:15:34] it amen I have the right attitude all
[1:15:37] the time
[1:15:40] amen let's look at Romans chapter
[1:15:46] 6 I'm sorry Romans chapter
[1:15:50] 8 verse
[1:15:52] 26
[1:16:06] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[1:16:08] infirmities for we know not what we
[1:16:10] should pray for as we ought but the
[1:16:12] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[1:16:14] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[1:16:17] and he that searcheth the heart knoweth
[1:16:19] what is the mind of the spirit because
[1:16:20] he maketh intercession for the Saints
[1:16:22] according according to the will of God
[1:16:25] and we know that all things work
[1:16:26] together for good to them that love God
[1:16:28] to them who are the called according to
[1:16:30] his purpose for whom he did Forno he
[1:16:33] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:16:35] the image of his son that we might that
[1:16:38] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:16:40] Brethren moreover whom he did PR
[1:16:43] predestinate them he also called and
[1:16:45] whom he called them he also Justified
[1:16:48] and whom he justified them he also
[1:16:52] glorified
[1:16:54] am before you were called you were
[1:16:58] glorified the picture of you glorified
[1:17:01] is in his
[1:17:03] file and you will arrive
[1:17:06] there cuz it just as much as it's
[1:17:09] written in the mountain the thing that's
[1:17:11] more enduring than that mountain is his
[1:17:14] word am that mountain could fade away
[1:17:17] that mountain will probably be
[1:17:18] absolutely destroyed in the final
[1:17:20] destruction of the earth when it's
[1:17:21] renovated for new heavens and new earth
[1:17:23] it might be destroyed when it's
[1:17:24] renovated for the Millennium but that
[1:17:26] what's in that file in the back part of
[1:17:28] God's mind will never be destroyed amen
[1:17:31] and if that's a testimony that will
[1:17:33] endure what about the testimony of the
[1:17:35] will and word of God it will endure
[1:17:37] forever amen and God is revealed to us
[1:17:40] that we belong to him and we're part of
[1:17:41] him and we come from him that's the most
[1:17:44] enduring testimony we could ever have
[1:17:46] amen we could have a mountain peak with
[1:17:48] our name written right in it that
[1:17:49] depicts all the highs and lows of our
[1:17:51] life amen but that could fade away but
[1:17:53] the thing that'll never change is a
[1:17:55] revelation of where we came from who we
[1:17:58] are who we belong to why we're here and
[1:18:01] where we're going to it's more enduring
[1:18:03] than that mountain
[1:18:04] range and it tells us he's already got a
[1:18:07] plan we're already part of that plan we
[1:18:09] were with him before and nothing is out
[1:18:12] of kilter and nothing is out of
[1:18:14] place and in that we can say in the
[1:18:17] worst trial in the worst time God be
[1:18:20] praised I love you for your ways are
[1:18:22] perfect
[1:18:23] amen and I don't know I go forward and
[1:18:27] he's not there I go backwards and I
[1:18:29] can't find him I move to the left and I
[1:18:32] can't discern where he to the right he
[1:18:33] hideth his way from me but I know one
[1:18:35] thing he knows the way that I take
[1:18:37] because he knew it before the foundation
[1:18:39] of the world and when I am tried I shall
[1:18:41] come forth like
[1:18:46] gold don't let the devil tell you things
[1:18:48] are out of control amen don't let the
[1:18:51] devil tell you things are out of control
[1:18:52] control don't let the devil tell you
[1:18:55] amen don't let him lie the old lies to
[1:18:58] you that God's not happy with you he's
[1:19:00] displeased with you maybe you're not a
[1:19:02] child of God because if you were a child
[1:19:04] of God he would have answered your
[1:19:05] prayer and all this would have worked
[1:19:06] out you this wouldn't be happening to
[1:19:09] you if you were weren't a child of God
[1:19:11] maybe the Lord's not pleased with
[1:19:13] you my goodness look at

[1:19:28] City to City he was pleased with Paul
[1:19:30] amen none of those things proved God's
[1:19:32] displeasure God was pleased all along he
[1:19:35] was pleased with job he was pleased with
[1:19:37] Joseph amen he was pleased with the
[1:19:39] apostles he was pleased with the

[1:39:23] struggling I'm sorry but my heart is so
[1:39:25] full brother Bam's struggling because
[1:39:28] 10,000 of his friends left him and they
[1:39:33] wouldn't hear his
[1:39:34] message the religious World wouldn't
[1:39:36] hear his
[1:39:38] message the question is how did he get
[1:39:41] 10,000 friends to start with when he was
[1:39:43] a poor little boy rejected and nobody
[1:39:45] would even talk to him it was the grace
[1:39:47] of God that had lifted him out of
[1:39:49] poverty to begin with that had given him
[1:39:51] a Ministry to start with it was amazing
[1:39:53] that that boy would have a worldwide
[1:39:55] Ministry so that he could be rejected by
[1:39:57] the whole
[1:40:00] world and mean he's feeling the
[1:40:02] rejection but missing the miracle of
[1:40:04] being able to be rejected by 10,000
[1:40:06] people that he had called
[1:40:09] friends the whole life was a miracle it
[1:40:12] was amazing it was impossible but God
[1:40:14] Did It
[1:40:17] am then when he looks at that seventh
[1:40:20] Peak
[1:40:21] he knows that's the place of his
[1:40:24] ministry when I look at that seventh
[1:40:27] Peak that's the part that belongs to me
[1:40:31] cuz that's the opening of the
[1:40:33] word praise be to God God is good to us

[1:45:54] preach very long so this isn't preaching
[1:45:57] this is storytelling preaching was
[1:46:00] short I was talking to Levi the the
[1:46:03] Amish man that uh you know we've talked
[1:46:06] about that received the message and I
[1:46:08] sitting talking to him and he he was
[1:46:11] trying to get reinstated into his church
[1:46:13] because he wants to witness to his
[1:46:14] people and he told me he said I know if
[1:46:16] I could go to your church I could go to
[1:46:18] another church and he goes but who would
[1:46:20] witness to my people who would take the
[1:46:22] message to my people he said they will
[1:46:24] only listen to an Amish they won't
[1:46:25] listen to anybody else so he's working
[1:46:28] to get reinstated in the church he now
[1:46:29] can attend and he had three ministers
[1:46:32] come and sit and talk to
[1:46:33] him and they were interrogating him and
[1:46:36] they were talking about reinstating him
[1:46:37] and he's got to go through all the rules
[1:46:39] and do all these things to get back in
[1:46:41] and when he was in prison he had wrote a
[1:46:44] I think it was a 133-page letter front
[1:46:47] and
[1:46:48] back in the the regular legal pad the
[1:46:51] white legal pad and he had drew a line
[1:46:54] in between each blue
[1:46:56] line and wrote that small 10 or 13 Pages
[1:47:00] front and back that's how much of a
[1:47:01] letter he wrote and he sent it to his
[1:47:03] dad and all the
[1:47:05] ministers and it was after he read the
[1:47:07] church age book and received the message
[1:47:08] and he realized he says I realized where
[1:47:11] our denomination went wrong and I wanted
[1:47:13] to tell my dad and I wanted to tell the
[1:47:14] minister so that we could get back on
[1:47:16] track so he wrote this document and he
[1:47:19] said I would go to the Bible and to the
[1:47:21] church age book and I go and he goes it
[1:47:23] took me 12 hours to write this he goes I
[1:47:25] was anointed to write it he goes I write
[1:47:27] it and I sent it off and he said the
[1:47:29] stuff I got back shocked me he goes I
[1:47:31] send it away joyful knowing that they
[1:47:33] were going to see the air of our ways
[1:47:34] and we're going to repent and we're
[1:47:35] going to turn the church
[1:47:38] around and he said he got hateful things
[1:47:41] back and terrible things and when he got
[1:47:43] out now he's sitting in his house these
[1:47:45] three ministers come they're talking
[1:47:46] about reinstating
[1:47:47] him and they start interrogating him and
[1:47:50] start questioning him and he says the
[1:47:53] one thing they said they said
[1:47:54] everything's good but there's one thing
[1:47:56] left they
[1:47:58] said you picked up some beliefs while
[1:48:00] you were in prison yes and he said you
[1:48:04] need to drop all of those beliefs before
[1:48:06] you instate you and he said instantly
[1:48:09] love and joy like a a a a tunnel fell
[1:48:13] down over me and he said I felt so happy
[1:48:17] am and so
[1:48:19] joyful praise be to God I wish that
[1:48:21] happened to me every
[1:48:23] time he goes and I just looked at him
[1:48:25] and he goes I smiled he goes and that
[1:48:28] really kind of shocked him a little bit
[1:48:29] he goes I smiled really big and he goes
[1:48:31] I thought count it all joy and disciples
[1:48:35] were joyful to suffer for his name and
[1:48:37] he goes and he looked at him he says
[1:48:39] this is real
[1:48:42] persecution suffering for his name and
[1:48:44] he was so happy to suffer for his name
[1:48:48] he said and instantly
[1:48:51] instantly a story out of the martyr's
[1:48:54] the martyr's mirror I think I think it's
[1:48:56] called the martyr's mirror but it's a
[1:48:57] book that's really important to the
[1:48:58] Amish it's talking about their their
[1:49:00] founding fathers and all of the Martyr
[1:49:02] ISM and all that that they went through
[1:49:03] to leave the Catholic church and start
[1:49:05] the denomination and it's a and it's a
[1:49:07] book that they all read and really
[1:49:09] important and he hadn't read it since
[1:49:10] he's 15 years old and a story came right
[1:49:12] back to a a young man that was that was
[1:49:16] protesting the Catholic church and
[1:49:17] sitting across from an interrogator
[1:49:20] and a Catholic uh interrogator and was
[1:49:23] telling him if you'll just get rid of
[1:49:25] the Bible and come back to the church
[1:49:28] will accept you back and you can live
[1:49:31] and he said in in the story that man
[1:49:34] refused and he said he was burned at the
[1:49:37] steak and he to he goes instantly that
[1:49:39] story came to my mind and he goes I
[1:49:41] remembered it in detail I remembered the
[1:49:42] man's name I remembered everything and
[1:49:44] because I was talking to them about this
[1:49:46] book that's so important to Amish they
[1:49:48] would not disagree with me at all they
[1:49:49] would disagree with scriptures but they
[1:49:51] wouldn't disagree with this book he said
[1:49:53] I told him that story and I told him the
[1:49:55] man's name and I told him what happened
[1:49:56] he said it was just like this and he
[1:49:59] says the man says I'll take my burning
[1:50:02] and Levi looked at him and says and I'll
[1:50:04] take mine
[1:50:05] too and he wasn't mad and he wasn't
[1:50:08] hateful he said it with a smile on his
[1:50:11] face he was so joyful the suffer Lord he
[1:50:14] said I'll take mine too and he said that
[1:50:16] ended the conversation they asked him no
[1:50:18] more questions and they were going to
[1:50:19] reinstate into the
[1:50:21] church keep praying for Levi keep
[1:50:24] praying for him that God will use him if
[1:50:26] there's one there he's there for that
[1:50:28] one and he knows he's going to get
[1:50:30] kicked out he knows it's not going to
[1:50:31] last forever but he's there just to pull
[1:50:34] out whoever he can pull out so pray for
[1:50:36] him but when he told me that story it
[1:50:38] hit me why can't I be like that when
[1:50:40] somebody accuses or or tries to get you
[1:50:44] know accuses makes an accusation says
[1:50:46] something off hand why can't I just be
[1:50:48] happy to suffer for his name why can't
[1:50:50] that flood of joy and love come down
[1:50:52] over
[1:50:53] me oh praise God if we just had less
[1:50:56] self we would have more of that if we
[1:50:58] quit defending ourselves if we quit
[1:51:00] being so proud and and so prideful and
[1:51:03] and if we would just get rid of that
[1:51:05] stuff we would have that joy and love
[1:51:07] that would flood our hearts and say
[1:51:08] praise God if I suffer for his name like
[1:51:11] I'm supposed to count it all
[1:51:13] joy praise be to God Amen I love him
[1:51:17] amen I love him I love everybody
[1:51:21] the ones amen the ones when I first come
[1:51:23] into the message who took me aside and
[1:51:25] in a loving way rebuked me and tried to
[1:51:27] get me to see the err of my ways and
[1:51:29] told me the message was wrong and
[1:51:31] brother Brandon went off on the end God
[1:51:33] bless him I love
[1:51:34] him you know why they caused me to go
[1:51:37] back to the Bible and to the message to
[1:51:39] prove that it was right in my heart I
[1:51:42] love them they're beautiful people am
[1:51:44] they did exactly what they were supposed
[1:51:45] to do the ones whove criticized amen
[1:51:48] that caused me to actually question am I
[1:51:50] right or am I wrong amen the ones who
[1:51:52] accuse you of doing wrong they're the
[1:51:53] ones who cause you to go back to the
[1:51:54] Lord and say Lord am I right or am I
[1:51:56] wrong they're beautiful they're
[1:51:59] wonderful I love
[1:52:01] them oh man I want to be like the
[1:52:04] Apostle Paul in perils in the Deep uh I

[1:52:12] conflict with them amen but I count it
[1:52:14] all joy and I say praise be to God I
[1:52:16] glory in my
[1:52:18] infirmities God chose us to come here at
[1:52:23] this time to magnify the word and
[1:52:26] glorify him I say that's an honor amen
[1:52:30] and if we have to go through hardship to
[1:52:32] show his word and if that's his purpose
[1:52:35] I say it's an honor amen we have to go
[1:52:38] through rejection and ridicule and Scorn
[1:52:40] and rebuke and sicknesses and turmoils
[1:52:43] if we have to go through poverty if we
[1:52:44] have to go through all of that to
[1:52:46] display his plan and his will I say it's
[1:52:49] a joy count it all joy it's a privilege
[1:52:51] the greatest privilege I've ever had is
[1:52:54] to live for him and not for me whatever
[1:52:57] he wants I want him to have his way
[1:52:59] because friends there'll be no regrets
[1:53:01] when we pass to the other side there'll
[1:53:03] not be one regret for one moment of
[1:53:06] suffering when we get to the other side
[1:53:07] we'll be so thankful we didn't back down
[1:53:09] and didn't
[1:53:11] complain and let him have his
[1:53:13] way it's already written it's written
[1:53:17] it's in the file so Let It Be and let me
[1:53:22] have the right attitude oh God and let

[1:53:40] confident that he knows exactly where
[1:53:43] you're at and he knows the way that you
[1:53:45] take I want to ask you this are you
[1:53:47] confident that after you're tried you'll
[1:53:49] come come forth as
[1:53:50] gold because you were gold deity to
[1:53:55] start with and deity has now fallen into
[1:53:58] the Earth gold deity and somebody had to
[1:54:02] dig it out of the earth and while it was
[1:54:05] in the earth it got impurities mixed in
[1:54:07] with it do we understand the story now
[1:54:11] it was gold but has been hidden in the
[1:54:13] earth and while I was hidden in the
[1:54:14] earth impurities got mixed with it amen
[1:54:17] and now God's got to bring it through
[1:54:19] some trials to strip all the impurities
[1:54:21] out of it the fiery furnace the beating
[1:54:23] uh through the
[1:54:25] smelter but it was gold before and after
[1:54:28] it's tried it'll still be gold what's he
[1:54:32] trying to do purify the gold in your
[1:54:34] life and purify the gold in my life can
