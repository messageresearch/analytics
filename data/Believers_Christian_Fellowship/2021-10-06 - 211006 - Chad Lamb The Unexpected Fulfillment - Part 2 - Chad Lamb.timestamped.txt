[6:33] let's just pray
[6:35] lord jesus we thank you for the
[6:37] privilege of being gathered here once
[6:38] again
[6:40] god as we sing this song lord you open
[6:42] our eyes
[6:44] lord we can't do it ourselves we're here
[6:46] because we want to see you
[6:48] we've come tonight because we want to
[6:50] hear your voice lord
[6:52] god we've done all that we know to do in
[6:55] preparation to make our way here to
[6:58] prepare our hearts to repent
[7:00] to lay before you lord and ask that now
[7:02] you would come and do the part we can't
[7:04] do ourselves
[7:05] may you give us the ice have to see and
[7:07] the ears to hear
[7:09] god may you reveal yourself to us in a
[7:12] greater way than ever before
[7:14] may we see you lord unveiled before us
[7:17] as you continue to unfold that
[7:19] revelation
[7:21] lord i pray you would take preeminence
[7:22] and speak your word through these lips
[7:25] that you would have absolute and utter
[7:26] control lord may we be yielded
[7:29] completely to you god and may you do
[7:32] what you've intended to do this night
[7:34] may we go from here strengthen lord and
[7:36] maybe go from here illuminated and we go
[7:39] back out into the world as bright and
[7:41] shining lights to shine forth the glory
[7:43] of this gospel
[7:45] we ask that you bless all we say and do
[7:47] for your glory
[7:48] in jesus name we pray
[7:51] amen
[7:52] and while you're standing let's turn to
[7:54] first corinthians
[7:56] chapter eight and uh i heard it was
[7:59] announced to remind everybody of the
[8:01] um
[8:03] celebration of life ceremony for brother
[8:05] john matthews so everybody's invited and
[8:07] welcome to come at 10 30 on saturday
[8:10] and it's going to be a busy week and we
[8:11] also have the youth camp out this
[8:12] weekend so the youth will be doing that
[8:14] but a crowd will be ministering there so
[8:17] be in prayer for them and for everybody
[8:18] who's involved with the celebration of
[8:20] life as well and pray for the family
[8:24] amen let's read here in first
[8:26] corinthians chapter 8 verse 2
[8:30] if any man think that he knoweth
[8:32] anything he knoweth nothing yet as he
[8:34] ought to know
[8:35] but if any man love god the same is
[8:38] known of him praise god let's be seated
[8:41] you may be seated
[8:44] this i wanted to start with the
[8:46] scripture because it means a lot to me
[8:49] i want to go into part two of what we
[8:51] were talking about on sunday and so
[8:53] there'll be just a little bit maybe a
[8:55] little bit of review
[8:57] but some things that i just have in my
[8:58] heart to go into
[9:00] and like i said don't wait for something
[9:02] new because this is just review of
[9:04] things we've been talking about for the
[9:05] last several years but i realized that
[9:08] these are things that i want to see
[9:10] better amen
[9:11] that i don't believe that i've come to
[9:13] the end of the unveiling of god and that
[9:15] there's no more to see but i want to see
[9:17] more amen and and this scripture means a
[9:20] lot to me because if you think if any
[9:22] man think that he knoweth anything he
[9:24] knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know
[9:26] i think it's a good thing for us to
[9:28] remember that whatever we know we don't
[9:30] know it like we ought to know it amen
[9:31] there's always more to know so when we
[9:34] go back over things and we review them
[9:35] again it's constantly unfolding itself
[9:38] and and so we want to see it more
[9:40] clearly so brother branham said in
[9:42] christ is the mystery of god revealed he
[9:44] said look what was once god's great
[9:46] secret great mysterious secret in his
[9:48] mind is now put in the hearts of the
[9:50] believer that is the body of christ what
[9:53] was god's once great secret in his mind
[9:55] before the foundation of the world is
[9:57] now made manifest think of it see oh my
[10:01] i'm sure we don't we don't get it well i
[10:05] can't see it the way i ought to and i'm
[10:07] sure you don't
[10:09] that's the truth
[10:11] how many can say amen
[10:13] now brother brennaman's in christ is the
[10:15] mystery of god revealed and he's
[10:16] revealing the great mystery of god and
[10:19] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[10:21] and and he's he's revealing he's
[10:24] speaking of that great mystery that lays
[10:26] under the seven seals and he comes to it
[10:28] and he says now what was
[10:30] the great mysterious secret that was in
[10:33] his mind
[10:34] is now put in the hearts of the
[10:35] believers that is the body of christ so
[10:37] brother venom saying what was once the
[10:40] great mysterious secret in god's mind
[10:41] has now been put into the heart of the
[10:43] believers in the body of christ and then
[10:45] he comes and says well i know you don't
[10:47] see it frankly i don't well he said i
[10:49] don't see it like i ought to and i'm
[10:51] sure you don't see it
[10:53] he says it's already been transferred
[10:54] into the believers but you don't see it
[10:56] like you ought to
[10:58] and so you can receive this great
[11:00] mystery but it doesn't mean we see it
[11:02] like we ought to i think there's more
[11:03] that we can see amen
[11:05] so the one thing i want to come to a
[11:08] realization on as we keep looking at
[11:10] these things and ministering these
[11:12] things as the lord leads us is that we
[11:14] don't ever want to assume that we've
[11:15] come to the end of the understanding of
[11:17] all the things that god has unveiled for
[11:19] us amen they've all been given but i
[11:21] don't think we've come to the end of the
[11:22] unveiling of all things that's been
[11:24] given
[11:25] and i think he's continually unveiling
[11:27] himself amen so there's so much more
[11:31] to see
[11:32] again in god hiding himself in
[11:34] simplicity than revealing himself in the
[11:36] same
[11:37] he said then
[11:38] and watch what he'd done he preached
[11:40] such a mighty christ coming he's
[11:42] speaking of john the baptist he's got
[11:44] his fan in his hand and his fanning his
[11:47] way i mean he will thoroughly purge his
[11:49] floors he will take up the trash and
[11:51] sweep it out yonder and burn it that's
[11:53] right he will gather up the grain and
[11:54] take it into the garner
[11:56] see he was inspired but when jesus come
[11:59] they was looking for and all the
[12:00] apostles you know they they was looking
[12:02] for a great something to come my my boy
[12:05] he's coming that's all there is to it
[12:07] boy he will be mighty he will kick them
[12:09] romans off the face of the earth he will
[12:11] make them greeks go this way and romans
[12:13] go
[12:14] go that when he come
[12:16] when he come a little humble fellow
[12:18] being pushed around from one side to the
[12:20] other what was it god hiding himself in
[12:23] simplicity
[12:25] so we talked about this last time but i
[12:26] want to keep speaking on that when john
[12:29] the baptist amen when he came we we
[12:31] talked about the prophecies before that
[12:33] was laying in isaiah 40 and malachi 3
[12:36] and in malachi 4 of his coming and when
[12:39] he come to fulfill that the fulfillment
[12:41] didn't match the intellectual
[12:43] understanding or the or the intellectual
[12:45] interpretation of what you could
[12:47] physically read in the prophecy because
[12:49] by physical reading you would come up
[12:51] with the wrong picture but when god amen
[12:53] manifested amen only those with the seed
[12:56] on the inside could receive it amen
[12:59] because it wasn't by intellectual
[13:01] putting the pieces together it was by
[13:03] the holy ghost revealing the truth amen
[13:06] so now he's here speaking he's a
[13:08] forerunner and he's speaking of the
[13:10] thing that he's forerunning and the
[13:12] thing that he's forerunning amen is the
[13:14] coming of the lord and as he's speaking
[13:15] of it he's describing him as well
[13:18] there's one coming after me i'm not that
[13:20] one but there's one coming after me
[13:22] whose shoe latches i'm not worthy done
[13:24] loose and this fan is in his hand and
[13:25] he'll thoroughly purge the threshing
[13:27] floor amen and he'll burn the shaft and
[13:30] he'll gather the wheat into the garners
[13:32] so you can imagine standing that that
[13:34] that day standing there all around john
[13:37] hearing him on the banks of jordan
[13:39] preached this they would get an image in
[13:41] their mind of what this coming christ
[13:43] would be like
[13:44] they would imagine amen a man who who
[13:48] who john in his greatest john innocence
[13:50] the powerful of a preacher as he is amen
[13:53] he's not worthy to unloose unlatch the
[13:55] buckle of his shoes and he says he's got
[13:58] his his fan and his handle thoroughly
[14:00] purge the threshing floor and burn the
[14:02] chaff and gather the wheat into the
[14:04] garner and i can imagine their hearts
[14:06] would burn at this description of such a
[14:08] mighty such a mighty one coming amen
[14:10] such a victorious one
[14:13] but when jesus come and entered his
[14:14] ministry it was nothing like what they
[14:17] imagined
[14:18] the imagination of what john said and
[14:21] the interpretation and when it come to
[14:23] manifestation they couldn't match
[14:25] intellectually
[14:27] that's why the disciples that would
[14:29] follow jesus they couldn't even really
[14:31] put two and two together and get four
[14:34] because they didn't even understand what
[14:36] was going on or what he was saying amen
[14:38] it was later i mean after the baptism of
[14:40] the holy ghost when they were able to
[14:42] start putting the scriptures together to
[14:43] what they had seen and what they had
[14:45] heard
[14:46] but at that time they didn't even
[14:48] understand some of the things that jesus
[14:50] was saying they couldn't even comprehend
[14:52] when he would begin to say unless you
[14:54] eat the flesh of the son of man and
[14:56] drink his blood you have no part with me
[14:58] and brother said they had no idea what
[15:00] he meant by that
[15:02] but you know what the carnal
[15:03] understanding of that is
[15:06] eating flesh and drinking blood but we
[15:08] know it was spiritually manifest amen
[15:10] they come into a spiritual fulfillment
[15:13] of that prophecy
[15:15] and so they wouldn't understand it till
[15:17] later but because just because they
[15:20] didn't understand it didn't mean that
[15:22] they didn't recognize this was the
[15:23] christ
[15:25] because he looked at his disciples when
[15:27] so many went away he said well you go
[15:30] also and peter says where shall we go
[15:32] thou alone has the words of eternal life
[15:35] and we believe and are sure that thou
[15:37] art christ the son of the living god he
[15:40] had that much revelation given from the
[15:42] father and he couldn't move off that
[15:44] revelation even though the other things
[15:47] that he was hearing he was not able to
[15:49] explain
[15:50] he wasn't able to place them didn't
[15:51] understand how it would happen and when
[15:54] you know can you imagine the disciples
[15:56] having to face their family
[16:00] who were there that day when jesus said
[16:02] unless you eat my flesh or drink my
[16:03] blood you have no part can you imagine
[16:06] trying to answer that question amen and
[16:08] when they when they come to them and
[16:09] says what does he mean by what does he
[16:12] mean by eat flesh and drink his blood
[16:14] you heard you heard the same thing i
[16:16] heard peter
[16:18] andrew you heard what i heard that man
[16:20] said that we got to eat his flesh and
[16:22] drink his blood now what does that mean
[16:26] can you imagine peter he has no answer
[16:28] amen he cannot tell him what it means
[16:31] amen he would find out later later by
[16:34] revelation he would be able to tell him
[16:36] what the fulfillment of that was but in
[16:37] that day he couldn't tell him what that
[16:40] was and i could imagine maybe he would
[16:42] stutter a little bit and get read in the
[16:43] face and say i don't know and say how
[16:45] can you follow a man like that that says
[16:47] things like that he says i don't know i
[16:49] mean don't what do you think he meant i
[16:51] don't know are you really going to eat
[16:53] his flesh and drink his blood i don't
[16:55] know
[16:59] but i know one thing
[17:01] that that's the christ the son of the
[17:02] living god
[17:04] i know one thing that he alone has the
[17:06] words of eternal life i can't answer
[17:08] your question i can't explain it i can't
[17:10] put the pieces together it's beyond my
[17:13] comprehension right now
[17:15] but i know that that man has the words
[17:17] of eternal life
[17:19] so we see in god hiding himself in
[17:21] simplicity
[17:23] that even john
[17:24] when john would come and speak of jesus
[17:27] in an intellectual mind would form a
[17:30] picture of what this great one must be
[17:32] like
[17:33] and when we sung this song you know
[17:36] open our eyes i want to see jesus amen
[17:40] the question is what are you looking for
[17:43] what do you expect to see amen
[17:46] when you say i want to see jesus when
[17:48] you talk to that to in a denominational
[17:50] setting people are looking to see a
[17:52] physical form and nail prints and a
[17:54] beard and long hair in a robe amen but
[17:57] but i hope that we've gone beyond that
[17:59] when we sing i want to see jesus that
[18:00] we're not looking for the physical image
[18:02] or the nail scarred hands but we're
[18:04] looking for the word made manifest
[18:06] [Applause]
[18:08] so when we sing the song what do we mean
[18:11] by the song what are we looking for
[18:14] because if we don't know what we're
[18:15] looking for amen we don't know what we
[18:18] see
[18:22] i was meditating today and i just was
[18:24] thinking i was praying
[18:26] and i said god help us to see what we're
[18:29] looking at
[18:34] help us to see what we're looking at
[18:36] we're looking at it but help us to see
[18:39] it amen
[18:40] and and you know how is it that you can
[18:42] pray a prayer like that because it's
[18:44] happened to me time and time and time
[18:46] again in the message i'll look at
[18:47] something and look at something and look
[18:49] at something and read it and read it and
[18:50] read it then all of a sudden i see it
[18:55] so i can continue to pray god help us to
[18:57] see what we're looking at
[18:59] because you've given it to us for for us
[19:01] to look at it to read it amen to ponder
[19:04] over but it takes god amen to bring a
[19:07] revelation a divine revelation from the
[19:09] father to help us to see what we're
[19:11] looking at
[19:13] they were looking at jesus but they
[19:15] didn't see him
[19:17] they were looking at the christ they
[19:19] were looking at the word made flesh they
[19:20] were looking at the manifestation for
[19:21] their day but they didn't see it
[19:24] they were hearing the words that came
[19:26] from his voice but they didn't hear him
[19:30] so you can have hearing and not hear and
[19:32] you can see and not see but but i say
[19:34] god let us see what we're looking at
[19:37] let's go to matthew chapter 11.
[19:47] matthew chapter 11 verse 1.
[19:50] we're going to read here about john
[19:58] john is the one
[20:00] who was the forerunning of the messiah
[20:02] he is the one who saw
[20:05] the dove descend upon the lamb
[20:08] he's the one who saw the sign and
[20:10] declared that this is the lamb of god
[20:12] he's the one the next day who pointed
[20:15] out and said behold the lamb of god that
[20:17] taketh away the sin of the world and two
[20:19] of his disciples left and begin to
[20:20] follow jesus this is the same one that
[20:22] said behold his fan is in his hand he
[20:25] just thoroughly purged the threshing
[20:26] floor he's the one who says there's one
[20:28] among you
[20:30] this is the same one and we get in here
[20:32] to matthew chapter 11 verse 1 and it
[20:35] says and it came to pass when jesus had
[20:37] made an end of commanding his twelve
[20:39] disciples he departed thence to teach
[20:41] and to preach in their cities
[20:43] now when john had heard in in the prison
[20:46] the works of christ he sent two of his
[20:48] disciples and he said unto him art thou
[20:51] he that shall come or do we look for
[20:53] another
[20:56] art thou he that should come or do we
[20:58] look for another this was john who
[21:01] announced as a coming
[21:04] it was john who announced his arrival it
[21:07] was john who declared that this was the
[21:08] lamb of god who takes away the sin of
[21:10] the world it was john who said there's
[21:12] one among you it was john who saw the
[21:14] sign this is the same individual and now
[21:17] he's in prison and he's sent two
[21:19] disciples to ask a question
[21:22] are thou he that should come
[21:24] or do we look for another
[21:27] jesus answered and said unto them go and
[21:29] show john again those things which you
[21:31] do hear and see
[21:34] the blind receive their sight and the
[21:36] lame walk the lepers are cleansed and
[21:38] the deaf hear the dead are raised and
[21:40] the poor have the gospel preached to
[21:42] them and blessed is he
[21:44] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[21:49] this is the key
[21:50] john
[21:52] john now
[21:53] had a question and he says two disciples
[21:56] to ask the question are you the one that
[21:58] should come or do we look for another
[22:00] and and jesus could have got all kinds
[22:03] of upset
[22:05] and said you're the one who saw the sign
[22:07] amen you were there when the holy ghost
[22:10] descended like a dove you heard the
[22:12] voice amen what do you mean am i the one
[22:14] or do i look for another and you realize
[22:16] that even john's prophecy what he said
[22:19] was coming and what he saw didn't even
[22:22] match in his own intellectual
[22:24] understanding
[22:26] even john amen the forerunner had a
[22:29] certain expectation and his expectation
[22:32] uh when he would begin to say what he
[22:35] was saying he had an expectation and
[22:37] even jesus may not have met john's
[22:40] expectation
[22:42] i hope you don't think i'm stretching
[22:43] too far when saying that because those
[22:45] are the things the prophet of god told
[22:47] us
[22:48] he said his eagle eye began to film over
[22:50] in prison and he began to question and
[22:52] begin to wonder but jesus took him back
[22:54] to the fulfillment of the word amen and
[22:56] he says he didn't say no i'm him he said
[22:59] go tell john i'm the one and go remind
[23:01] him of of what go remind him of what he
[23:03] saw and what he said no he says go tell
[23:05] him amen all of the prophecies are being
[23:08] fulfilled everything that it said i
[23:10] would do i'm doing.
[23:14] so go back and give him the word amen go
[23:17] back and tell him show him the
[23:18] manifestation of the word or the
[23:20] fulfillment of the word and then say
[23:22] this
[23:23] blessed is he who's not ashamed in me
[23:27] blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[23:29] offended i'm sorry offended in me
[23:32] and what the brother brethren was
[23:33] telling us amen what he's telling us
[23:36] in a message the uh what did he say the
[23:39] forgotten beatitude i believe that's
[23:41] what it was
[23:42] because blessed is so all the beatitudes
[23:45] are blessed is the meek and blessed is
[23:47] this but here we come later after the
[23:49] sermon on the mount said blessed is he
[23:51] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[23:53] and brother branham called this the lost
[23:55] beatitude and that is don't be offended
[23:58] in the way he comes amen
[24:00] don't be offended in the manifestation
[24:02] of the word there's a prophecy and a
[24:04] manifestation just because the
[24:06] manifestation doesn't match your
[24:08] intellectual understanding of the
[24:09] prophecy don't be offended in him
[24:12] don't be offended in him just because it
[24:15] doesn't match just because you can't
[24:16] make it match don't be offended in him
[24:20] but what did he show john the
[24:22] fulfillment of the word the
[24:23] manifestation of the prophecies
[24:26] go tell him that and tell him not to be
[24:28] offended
[24:29] in me
[24:33] malachi 4.
[24:37] let's turn back just a little bit to
[24:39] malachi chapter 4.
[24:46] now i told you we're going to continue
[24:48] on
[24:49] with sunday but i don't remember giving
[24:50] you the title again it was the
[24:52] unexpected fulfillment
[24:54] the unexpected fulfillment that's what
[24:56] john was dealing with the fulfillment
[24:59] was not what he expected
[25:01] his expectation didn't match the
[25:03] fulfillment so god had to bring him back
[25:05] to the word christ had to bring him back
[25:07] to what what are you one are you come
[25:09] for are you another and you know jesus
[25:11] didn't answer his question
[25:14] i just i love this jesus rarely answers
[25:17] a question usually he asks another
[25:19] question
[25:21] and so what he's trying to do is you
[25:23] know
[25:24] we've got to get beyond the notion that
[25:27] jesus came for everyone
[25:30] he came for his father's sheep he came
[25:32] for a sheep the lost sheep that's who he
[25:34] came for
[25:36] and in coming for them he redeemed
[25:38] everything and in redeeming back
[25:40] everything now there we there will be
[25:42] rewards given to more than just the
[25:44] sheep
[25:46] that's his mercy
[25:48] but but he was he comes and he doesn't
[25:50] say hey i'm him i'm the one i'm this and
[25:53] i'm that and let me tie it all together
[25:55] for you no he just demonstrated the word
[25:58] he just manifest the word and he let the
[26:00] spirit of god amen call out the sheep he
[26:02] was there to find the sheep but how did
[26:04] he find the sheep by manifesting the
[26:06] word
[26:07] and the manifestation of the word for
[26:09] their day is what caught the seed for
[26:11] that day
[26:13] and so when john comes and asks a
[26:14] question he doesn't slip him a note and
[26:16] say john you remember this and you
[26:18] remember that amen remember i mean no he
[26:22] said go tell john amen the lame walk the
[26:25] deaf hear the gospels preached to the
[26:27] poor go tell him this is the
[26:30] manifestation of the promise
[26:34] because that's
[26:36] that's what opens the eyes
[26:38] of the sheep of god's children
[26:41] the manifest the manifested word
[26:44] so when we come here to malachi 4 let's
[26:46] just read it verse 5
[26:48] behold i will send you elijah the
[26:49] prophet before the coming of the great
[26:51] and dreadful day of the lord and he
[26:53] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[26:54] the children and the heart of the
[26:56] children to their fathers lest i come
[26:58] and smite the earth with a curse
[27:01] as we said sunday
[27:03] people have been reading their bibles
[27:04] now for hundreds and hundreds of years
[27:06] and and there's hundreds of years of
[27:08] reading
[27:09] the bible
[27:10] they've had they've come across this
[27:12] verse and there's all kinds of
[27:14] interpretations of how this will be
[27:16] fulfilled but god interprets his word by
[27:18] bringing it to pass and when god has
[27:21] brought this to pass in our day he
[27:23] brings it to pass and a fulfillment of
[27:25] the word and that fulfillment of the
[27:27] word is to attract the elect
[27:29] and the elect will be attracted to the
[27:31] fulfillment of the word
[27:35] and so and they will not be offended
[27:38] in the way he fulfills his word
[27:41] because we're not offended that he used
[27:43] a kentuckian with a seventh grade
[27:45] education and poor grammar that doesn't
[27:46] offend me does it defend you i'm not
[27:49] offended amen that he called him out of
[27:51] kentucky and he ministered in
[27:52] jeffersonville i'm not offended that
[27:54] that by the end of his ministry most
[27:56] everybody had pulled away from him and
[27:58] thought that he was off and got off at
[28:00] the end and that he started off good but
[28:02] he wasn't doing good anymore i'm not
[28:04] offended in that because that's the way
[28:05] god chose to manifest his word and
[28:08] something in me says that's nothing but
[28:09] the truth that was the fulfillment of
[28:12] malachi 4.
[28:15] see he does it in such a way it can only
[28:17] attract the elect
[28:20] that's right
[28:25] in the message the trial we read this
[28:27] sunday but i'd like to go through it
[28:29] again in the trial from 1964 he says and
[28:32] he spoke down on the river he said as
[28:34] john the baptist was sent forth to
[28:36] proclaim the coming of christ
[28:38] i love this sentence
[28:40] i'm going to read it twice
[28:43] ask john the baptist so he's saying as
[28:44] john the baptist he's saying as then
[28:46] it'll be now
[28:48] as we did then it's going to happen in
[28:50] you as john the baptist was sent forth
[28:52] to proclaim the coming of christ at the
[28:53] end of his ministry jesus came
[28:57] when did jesus come at the end of the
[28:59] forerunner's ministry
[29:01] at the end of his ministry jesus came
[29:05] brother branham said as john the baptist
[29:07] was sent to forth run and sent forth to
[29:09] proclaim the coming of christ at the end
[29:11] of his ministry jesus came and as john
[29:13] was sent so will your ministry forerun
[29:15] the second coming of christ
[29:18] parallel tracts he's saying as it was
[29:21] here it'll be here
[29:24] let's not be offended in the way he
[29:26] fulfilled that
[29:28] [Music]
[29:32] in the message god hiding himself in
[29:33] simplicity then revealing himself in the
[29:35] same now i want to i want to go through
[29:37] that title again and again and again
[29:39] until it locks in because i've heard
[29:41] this title i've read this title we've
[29:42] discussed this title but it's taking on
[29:44] more meaning to me all the time
[29:47] since god is hiding himself in
[29:48] simplicity we got that god's always
[29:50] hiding himself in simplicity john was a
[29:53] simple preacher amen he wasn't a priest
[29:55] he wasn't this brother branham was a
[29:56] simple preacher amen peter was simple
[29:59] andrew was simple john was simple they
[30:01] were all simple
[30:03] your average joe some of them may have
[30:05] been considered below average joe
[30:08] but it was simple amen god was hiding
[30:11] himself in simplicity amen and when he
[30:14] was hiding himself in simplicity but it
[30:16] says and revealing himself in the same
[30:20] so we're comfortable with god hiding
[30:22] himself in simplicity but we've got to
[30:25] get comfortable with him revealing
[30:26] himself in the same
[30:28] because if you're going to see the
[30:30] revelation of jesus christ it's going to
[30:32] come out of the same kind of simplicity
[30:34] that he's hiding himself in
[30:36] so if he's hiding himself in simplicity
[30:38] he's really revealing himself in the
[30:41] same so why are we comfortable with him
[30:43] hiding himself in a simplicity but we're
[30:46] still looking for something big for the
[30:48] revelation
[30:51] if it's hidden in simplicity it's going
[30:53] to be revealed in simplicity when he
[30:55] hides it in something small obscure out
[30:58] of the way unnoticed he's going to be
[31:00] revealing it through the same thing
[31:03] so he's not going to hide it in
[31:04] something simple and reveal it in
[31:06] something great he's going to hide it in
[31:08] something simple and reveal it in
[31:10] something simple
[31:13] that's why brother branham had to preach
[31:15] this at the beginning of the seals
[31:18] it was ordained of god the title was
[31:21] ordained the order of the service was
[31:22] ordained what he said was ordained and
[31:24] he comes to the beginning of this week
[31:26] of services where he's going to be
[31:27] preaching the seven seals and he starts
[31:30] with god hiding himself in simplicity
[31:32] and revealing himself the same so that
[31:34] we don't miss that god always hides
[31:36] himself in a simple vessel
[31:38] and we all say amen we can read our
[31:40] bibles amen they were all simple vessels
[31:44] but don't miss that he's revealing
[31:46] himself in the same
[31:47] simple vessels
[31:53] unless you want him to stay hidden
[32:01] but he didn't hide himself to stay
[32:02] hidden
[32:03] he hid himself so he could be revealed
[32:07] but he wants to be hidden from some and
[32:08] revealed the others
[32:11] so how is he going to be revealed to
[32:12] some and hidden from others well he'll
[32:13] reveal he'll review he'll hide himself
[32:15] in simplicity so that the great and the
[32:17] intellectual and everybody else will
[32:18] miss it and it'll reveal himself in
[32:21] simplicity so the simple will catch it
[32:25] remember
[32:26] he was going to hide himself as a baby
[32:31] but he was going to hide himself in a
[32:33] stable
[32:35] and first he hid himself in a virgin
[32:37] from an out-of-way city that that's
[32:40] that's that there's nothing good spoke
[32:42] of in the bible
[32:44] he's going to hide in this little virgin
[32:46] that is a nobody
[32:49] and what's hidden in her
[32:51] christ himself
[32:53] the word himself is hidden in her
[32:55] and god is coming down uh in the
[32:58] fulfillment of the word he's coming down
[33:01] writing on a donkey amen why because the
[33:04] whole world had to be taxed amen so the
[33:06] whole world taxation was to fulfill the
[33:09] word of god to bring this simple humble
[33:11] virgin amen down on the back of a donkey
[33:14] led all the way down to bethlehem
[33:16] because the prophecy has to be fulfilled
[33:18] and she's not great enough to make the
[33:20] prophecy fulfilled so the great god is
[33:23] hiding it in a worldwide taxation
[33:27] worldwide politics is doing what hiding
[33:30] the simplicity
[33:33] so now he's come he's coming coming in
[33:35] simplicity amen and then coming down and
[33:38] being born amen not not in any
[33:41] significant place but being born in a
[33:43] stable way man and being placed in a
[33:46] manger
[33:48] so born in the stable placed in a manger
[33:50] what was it god hiding himself in
[33:53] simplicity amen but when it came time to
[33:55] reveal himself he had to get a group of
[33:58] people that would understand this hiding
[34:00] place so he went to a group of shepherds
[34:02] out in the field brother bam said
[34:04] illiterate shepherds
[34:06] and he went to those illiterate
[34:08] shepherds and revealed what was going on
[34:10] in that stable and they were simple
[34:12] enough to receive it amen
[34:14] they didn't question it they didn't have
[34:16] to go talk to the high priest amen they
[34:18] saw angels amen the angel declared to
[34:20] them what was happening they heard the
[34:21] angels singing they ran amen into the
[34:24] city to go see amen what was taking
[34:27] place in simplicity in hiding in
[34:29] simplicity amen was emmanuel and
[34:32] emmanuel was there in that form of a
[34:34] baby laying in a manger in a stable amen
[34:37] and those shepherds come in there and
[34:39] they began to worship him
[34:41] they didn't care he was a baby they
[34:43] didn't care he was in a stable they
[34:45] didn't care what his swatting claws were
[34:47] made of they didn't care he was laying
[34:49] in a manger amen they could receive what
[34:51] god was hiding in simplicity because he
[34:53] was revealing it in the same form
[34:56] [Music]
[34:58] and because they could receive it they
[35:00] were not offended in this manifestation
[35:03] so they ran into bethlehem and told
[35:05] everybody what they had seen and what
[35:06] the angels told them because they were
[35:08] not offended
[35:10] in him
[35:11] [Music]
[35:14] praise be to god
[35:16] do you think anything's different today
[35:19] nothing is different today they were not
[35:21] offended in that manifestation they were
[35:24] not offended in that fulfillment of the
[35:25] word why because they're simple amen
[35:28] they simple could hear the simple could
[35:31] receive amen because they they were
[35:33] ordained predestinated to receive
[35:38] how many people passed by
[35:41] how many people the next day would go
[35:44] into that stable to go get their animal
[35:47] lead them out feed them do whatever and
[35:49] they would see that there was a baby
[35:50] born overnight and see this woman and
[35:53] just grab their cow grab their donkey
[35:55] grab whatever and walk out and pay no
[35:57] attention
[35:59] to what was going on
[36:01] but there was there was shepherds
[36:03] running around town
[36:05] saying we saw an angel angel told us
[36:07] this we went and found it just like the
[36:09] angel said this is emmanuel this is
[36:12] messiah amen this this is the prophecy
[36:14] being fulfilled and they looked at the
[36:15] illiterate simple shepherd what was the
[36:18] simple shepherd now the mystery was
[36:20] hidden in the shepherd and revealed in
[36:22] the same
[36:23] they were revealing the fulfillment of
[36:25] prophecy amen and the people wouldn't
[36:27] receive it because of who had the
[36:29] message
[36:33] and the story repeats and repeats and
[36:35] repeats and repeats and repeats
[36:39] all the way down to this day and all the
[36:41] way into this building and all the way
[36:42] into your pew
[36:45] i guess we don't have pews but seats
[36:50] i didn't want to leave anybody out
[36:54] be hidden
[36:55] in simplicity
[36:57] and revealed
[36:59] and the same
[37:01] don't look for the hiding and simplicity
[37:03] and the revealing of something great
[37:04] you'll miss it
[37:08] in this message he says you love him my
[37:11] isn't he wonderful i hope and trust that
[37:13] the message will produce what it was
[37:15] intended to do
[37:16] that it'll get you to the place that you
[37:18] don't look for flowery things
[37:20] when you see god in greatness look how
[37:22] humble it is and then you'll see god
[37:24] don't look for him
[37:25] when elisha was back in that cave
[37:28] the smoke went across
[37:30] blood thunder lightning and all these
[37:32] kinds of sensations we've had blood in
[37:34] the face and in the hands and sensations
[37:35] and everything they've never bothered
[37:37] that prophet he just laid there but he
[37:39] heard a still small voice what was it
[37:42] the word
[37:43] lock into that what was that still small
[37:46] voice it was the word
[37:48] then he covered his face and walked out
[37:50] see that was it
[37:53] remember friend don't look for big you
[37:55] say god he speaks of great big things
[37:57] there'll come a time they'll be this
[37:59] that or the other great big things i
[38:01] hope you're catching what i'm talking
[38:03] about great big things and oh when this
[38:06] comes to pass it'll be great big like
[38:08] this and it'll be so humble you'll miss
[38:10] the whole thing and just go right on see
[38:13] you'll look back and say well that never
[38:16] did come you see you passed right over
[38:18] the top and you never even seen it see
[38:20] it's so simple and god lives in
[38:22] simplicity to manifest himself in
[38:25] greatness what makes him great because
[38:27] he can simplify himself
[38:31] now i want to go to first kings and look
[38:32] at this we've looked at it before but
[38:34] let's go to first kings 19 and look at
[38:36] elijah in the cave again
[38:42] and the reason i want to look at it is
[38:44] after i preached them on sunday i ran
[38:45] into brother emmanuel and brother
[38:48] emmanuel shared with me a quote that he
[38:49] had just heard
[38:51] and when i said brother that's good
[38:54] it had to do with this
[38:55] and he and i said send it to me so last
[38:58] night he sent it to me and late in the
[39:00] night and i read it and i got so excited
[39:02] he found several quotes on this and i
[39:04] just want to bring it to you because
[39:06] it's fresh for me
[39:08] and we thank god for using a simple
[39:10] vessel of brother emmanuel
[39:13] first kings 19 9
[39:17] and he came hither into a cave and
[39:19] lodged there and behold the word of the
[39:21] lord came to him
[39:22] said unto him what doest i'll hear
[39:24] elijah
[39:25] and he said i have been very jealous for
[39:27] the lord god of hosts for the children
[39:29] of israel have forsaken thy covenant
[39:31] thrown down thine altars and slain thy
[39:33] prophets with the sword and i even i
[39:35] only am left and they seek my life to
[39:37] take it away
[39:39] and he said go forth and stand upon the
[39:41] mount before the lord and behold the
[39:43] lord passed by and a great and strong
[39:45] wind rent the mountains and break in
[39:47] pieces the rocks before the lord but the
[39:50] lord was not in the wind
[39:51] and after the wind an earthquake but the
[39:53] lord was not in the earthquake and after
[39:56] the earthquake a fire but the lord was
[39:58] not in the fire and after the fire a
[40:01] still small voice
[40:04] and it was so when elijah heard it that
[40:06] he wrapped his face in his mantle and
[40:08] went out and stood in the entering into
[40:10] the cave
[40:11] behold there came a voice unto him and
[40:12] said what doest thou hear
[40:14] elijah
[40:16] so we know this and brother branham is
[40:18] referring to this and god hiding himself
[40:20] in simplicity and he says there was the
[40:23] great big loud uh a wind that was
[40:26] breaking the rocks and shattering them
[40:28] and there was the the fire that burnt
[40:30] through the mountain there was the the
[40:32] earthquake that shook it all amen but
[40:35] none of that moved elijah
[40:39] so he was showing that it was going to
[40:41] be in simplicity not something great not
[40:43] something big brother brandon mentions
[40:45] this and god hiding himself in
[40:46] simplicity he said but when he heard the
[40:48] still small voice what was it the word
[40:51] when he heard the word the word moved
[40:53] him like the thunder or the the wind
[40:56] couldn't move him the earthquake
[40:57] couldn't move the fire couldn't move him
[40:59] but the still small voice of the word is
[41:01] what moved him in humility to wrap a
[41:04] mantle around his face and go out to
[41:06] meet god
[41:08] and here's the one of the quotes that
[41:09] brother emmanuel sent to me he says
[41:13] in the 1960 and the unchangeable god
[41:16] says when he pulled back in the cave
[41:18] there came an earthquake outside that
[41:20] shook the cave where he was sitting
[41:22] there come a mighty rushing wind there
[41:23] came thunders and lightnings and blowing
[41:25] and it was all god but it didn't attract
[41:28] the prophet it didn't touch him somehow
[41:30] he knowed what god's power was he knowed
[41:32] god had shook the mountains and he had
[41:34] rushing winds and so forth and sent fire
[41:36] out of the heaven but he waited
[41:39] and way down inside of him came a little
[41:41] stall still voice
[41:45] where did the voice come from
[41:47] way down inside of him
[41:50] come a little still voice
[41:52] that attracted the prophet
[41:55] there was something he'd seen his power
[41:57] to do things but this time he felt his
[41:59] presence and a still small voice
[42:01] speaking into his heart
[42:03] then the prophet raised up and went out
[42:05] to the end of the cave
[42:07] what moved him the word amen what word
[42:10] the still saw voice that was down inside
[42:13] of him that was speaking to his heart
[42:17] i mean this is important because of what
[42:19] we want to what we want to look at i
[42:21] want to look at this next quote and
[42:23] we'll talk about that
[42:24] in 1962
[42:26] and thy seed shall possess the gate of
[42:28] his enemy he says the thing of it is
[42:30] like i was saying last night the
[42:32] pentecostals are waiting for a rushing
[42:33] mighty wind but they failed to hear that
[42:36] still small voice
[42:38] it's wrong to do those things they think
[42:40] as long as what's wrong to do those
[42:42] things as long as the wind is rushing
[42:45] all right
[42:48] i think as long as the wind is rushing
[42:50] as long as there's enthusiasm as long as
[42:52] there's excitement as long as we can see
[42:54] something or hear something that's it
[42:57] and here's what brother brandon said but
[42:58] that didn't attract the prophet's
[43:00] attention
[43:01] the rushing wind never bothered the
[43:03] prophet elijah in the cave the mighty
[43:06] thunders and linings and pouring down
[43:07] never attracted him but what startled
[43:09] him was that still small voice that
[43:12] something speaking with inside
[43:15] my word is truth let every man's word be
[43:17] a lie and mind be truth that's what
[43:19] attracted the prophecy and it still it's
[43:22] it'll
[43:23] and it'll still do it the word of god
[43:25] always attracts the spiritual mind
[43:27] because it's the mind of christ in you
[43:30] that knows that that word is true
[43:34] that's what peter had amen peter had
[43:36] something that could receive a
[43:38] revelation from the father that would
[43:40] say i don't understand what you're
[43:42] talking about i don't know what you mean
[43:44] amen by what if the son of man goes up
[43:47] where he come down from
[43:48] unless i eat your flesh i don't
[43:50] understand but this i know the tower of
[43:52] christ the son of the living god
[43:55] thou alone have the words of eternal
[43:56] life amen there was something that peter
[43:59] had heard and what peter heard and moved
[44:01] him
[44:02] and in here in first kings when when
[44:05] brother was describing this in the cave
[44:08] he's in the cave in and i just wanted to
[44:11] look at it this way
[44:12] he's in separation he's all by himself
[44:18] elijah is away from everybody he's all
[44:20] alone
[44:23] and he's in a cave
[44:26] and if you'll just allow me this
[44:28] flexibility
[44:30] let's just say he's in a little room
[44:37] let's just say he's in a little room all
[44:38] by himself
[44:41] and there's a lot of noise going on all
[44:44] around the room
[44:45] and the little cave
[44:47] all by himself
[44:49] with nobody else present
[44:52] and all by himself with nobody else
[44:55] present all the noise is going on all
[44:58] around him
[45:00] the wind breaking the rocks and pieces
[45:03] amen the roar of the fire as it rushes
[45:05] through the earthquake as it shakes
[45:07] everything and nothing moves him into
[45:10] action nothing brings him out of the
[45:13] cave nothing brings him out humbled amen
[45:16] but when he hears the still small voice
[45:18] with inside him
[45:21] then he comes to the end of the little
[45:24] room amen with a mantle wrapped around
[45:26] his face ready to meet god
[45:29] amen you know
[45:31] there's there's
[45:34] there's so much noise
[45:36] all around there's noise friends there's
[45:39] noise from everybody i mean everything
[45:42] is noisy
[45:43] uh there's religion is noisy politics is
[45:46] noisy entertainment is noisy the world
[45:48] everything around is noisy noise here
[45:51] and noise there and i'll tell you
[45:52] another thing everybody has an opinion
[45:58] do you agree
[46:00] i mean
[46:01] the ones closest to you even your own
[46:03] family they got an opinion
[46:05] that sometimes you don't value or
[46:07] appreciate
[46:09] everybody there's noise noise noise
[46:12] noise noise but god amen had to get
[46:15] elijah's attention and all the noise
[46:17] wasn't going to do it but when he was
[46:18] all alone back in the little cave all
[46:21] alone with nobody else present there was
[46:23] a different kind of noise that resounded
[46:25] and the noise that he heard was a still
[46:27] small voice amen
[46:29] and that still small voice he heard with
[46:32] inside of him
[46:34] and when he heard that voice
[46:37] now it was time to wrap his face in a
[46:40] mantle
[46:42] the earthquake didn't cause him to wrap
[46:44] his face
[46:46] the fire the wind it didn't cause but
[46:49] wrapping his face in a mantle is a sign
[46:51] of ultimate humility
[46:54] and when he heard this still small voice
[46:56] he wrapped his his face in his mantle
[46:59] and he went to the end of the cave amen
[47:01] to to meet god amen to meet god face to
[47:04] face but he didn't do it with pride or
[47:06] arrogancy or any of those great big
[47:08] things it was the little still small
[47:10] voice that moved him to humble himself
[47:12] and get him back in action because he
[47:14] was hiding away
[47:17] and he come out of that cave with a
[47:19] commission to fulfill
[47:21] he come out of that cave with the work
[47:23] to do he come out of that cave with a
[47:24] purpose to do for god and god took him
[47:26] and put him right back in action
[47:29] and
[47:31] and there's noise
[47:34] lots and lots
[47:36] of noise
[47:39] but
[47:40] we need to draw to the little cave
[47:44] and you'll hear somebody say this and
[47:47] somebody will say that
[47:50] listen
[47:51] don't let that move you
[47:56] there's a fire over here and there's a
[47:58] thunder over there and there's a wind
[48:00] over here don't let that move you
[48:04] because if you let that move you
[48:06] you'll be chasing the wind from
[48:09] mountaintop to mountaintop to
[48:10] mountaintop
[48:12] trying to catch that wind
[48:15] if you let the earthquake move you i
[48:16] mean you're going to be waiting for the
[48:17] next earthquake to move you amen but it
[48:20] wasn't any of that that the prophet was
[48:22] waiting for it wasn't any of that that
[48:23] god amen used to get him out of the cave
[48:26] what god used amen was the still small
[48:29] voice within sight of him
[48:32] sometimes what we need to do is get away
[48:34] from all the noise
[48:37] and i don't mean move somewhere i mean
[48:39] that sounds nice let's go to montana or
[48:41] north dakota
[48:42] i think north dakota has more pigs than
[48:44] they have humans
[48:45] sounds good to me
[48:49] but that's not what i'm talking about
[48:51] i'm talking about amen drawing aside
[48:54] amen getting along with god amen you can
[48:57] do that in a crowded room you can do
[48:59] that in a church full of people but get
[49:01] along with god and say god i'm listening
[49:03] for your voice in me amen i'm listening
[49:06] for the revelation that can only come
[49:07] from the father that you tell me this is
[49:10] the word this is the way this is the
[49:12] truth
[49:15] can't keep chasing the noise
[49:19] we got to go alone
[49:21] before god and hear his voice
[49:24] with inside
[49:27] see
[49:28] you can't accomplish this with tape
[49:30] listening only
[49:35] we can listen to tapes we can't
[49:36] accomplish this with preaching only
[49:40] all those are tools that god will use to
[49:42] speak to us but the still small voice is
[49:44] the one with inside
[49:47] down in the heart
[49:48] that's the one that moves us that's the
[49:50] revelation that comes from the father
[49:52] that's the one that's the divine
[49:54] revealer of the word
[49:56] telling you this is the truth amen this
[49:59] is right this is the way
[50:02] this is my way
[50:06] so
[50:08] so many voices
[50:10] so much noise
[50:13] but there's a still small voice
[50:18] i wonder how many times
[50:21] we've come to the message we want to
[50:23] serve the lord and
[50:25] we get alone with god and we run out
[50:27] every time something shakes
[50:32] i wonder how many times
[50:34] every time something shakes we we pop
[50:36] our head out to see what that is or we
[50:38] run to it or every time there's
[50:40] something happening we run to the
[50:41] shaking we run to the moving we run to
[50:43] the fire amen but we moved too early
[50:48] because we moved before we had our own
[50:50] revelation
[50:54] we chased the fire
[50:56] we chased the the wind we've chased the
[50:59] earthquake
[51:02] but the problem with that
[51:03] is you just keep chasing
[51:06] chasing chasing
[51:10] i wonder if we could just wait a little
[51:12] bit longer
[51:14] just get along with god and just wait a
[51:16] little bit longer
[51:18] until god drops something into our
[51:20] hearts that says this is it
[51:23] this is true
[51:25] and it'll bring us to a humility where
[51:27] we realize it wasn't me
[51:30] it wasn't anything i've done it wasn't
[51:31] anything i could think up or conjure up
[51:33] or accomplish or understand
[51:36] but i wrap myself in my mantle and i
[51:38] come to the entrance to meet the lord
[51:39] because it's all him
[51:41] now i just want him to tell me what i'm
[51:43] supposed to do and i want to go and i
[51:44] want to do what he tells me to do
[51:47] i want to be what he's called me to be i
[51:49] want to obey all he's told me to obey
[51:52] that's the fact of the still small voice
[51:57] brother branham is preaching in the
[51:58] seventh seal and i just want to go into
[52:00] the seventh seal for a little bit i
[52:01] don't intend to be long i just want to
[52:02] read some things that are familiar
[52:05] but i want to read it in this context
[52:07] he said and i had my hands out
[52:10] and all at once something hit my hand i
[52:12] don't know he's talking about the
[52:14] incident in sabino canyon with the sword
[52:16] in his hand and and he he's come to the
[52:19] seventh seal
[52:21] and in preaching the seventh seal we
[52:22] went through this before he doesn't
[52:24] preach the seventh seal the way he
[52:26] preaches the first six seals
[52:29] so i want to keep reiterating that i
[52:31] want to i want to keep talking about
[52:32] that i wanted god to keep unveiling it
[52:35] to us amen because in the first six
[52:37] seals he gave us the interpretation amen
[52:40] of what the symbol meant the symbol
[52:42] means this and what you saw there
[52:44] represents this and this is that and
[52:46] this is that and he goes through the
[52:47] scriptures and tying it all together but
[52:49] when it comes to the seventh seal he
[52:51] doesn't have that luxury because when
[52:52] you go to the seventh seal in revelation
[52:54] chapter eight there's nothing there to
[52:56] go off of
[52:58] it says there's silence
[53:01] and so he can't preach it the same way
[53:03] he preached to others because this seal
[53:05] is different in the bible
[53:07] and because the seal is different in the
[53:09] bible he can't preach it the same way he
[53:11] preached the other six
[53:13] so he's coming now and he's preaching it
[53:15] and and then he comes to this point here
[53:18] he's just went back over and then the
[53:21] sixth steal and he's went back over the
[53:23] gap between the sixth and the seventh
[53:25] and he showed chapter seven the 144 000
[53:28] and then all the saints of tribulation
[53:30] and now he's went through that and now
[53:33] he's coming to the to the seventh seal
[53:35] and when he's coming here he just says i
[53:37] feel to stop
[53:38] when he feels to stop then he starts
[53:40] talking about visions and he starts
[53:42] talking about experiences
[53:45] remember he's not preaching the seventh
[53:46] seal the same way
[53:48] he preached to six
[53:51] he says i had my hands out and all at
[53:52] once something hit my hand
[53:54] i don't know i can't say did i go to
[53:56] sleep i don't know did i go into a
[53:58] trance i don't know was it a vision i
[54:00] can't tell you only thing i can see
[54:03] is it's just the same thing that them
[54:05] angels was
[54:06] and it struck my hand and i looked and
[54:08] it was a sword and it had pearl handles
[54:09] real pretty had a guard over it with
[54:11] gold and the blade looked like something
[54:13] like chrome like silver only it was real
[54:15] shiny and it was so feathered sharp oh
[54:18] my and i thought isn't that the
[54:19] prettiest thing it just fit my hand i
[54:21] thought that's awful pretty but said hey
[54:23] i'm always afraid of them things a sword
[54:26] and i thought what will i do with that
[54:28] and just then a voice shook down through
[54:30] there that rocked the rocks it's the
[54:32] sword of the king
[54:34] and then i come out of it the sword of
[54:35] the king
[54:37] now if it said a sword of a king but it
[54:39] said the sword of the king and there's
[54:42] only one the king and that's god and he
[54:44] has one sword and that's his word that i
[54:47] live by that so help me god standing
[54:50] over his holy desk with his holy word
[54:52] laying here it's the word amen
[54:56] so what is that sword that's put in his
[54:58] hand it's the word
[54:59] and brother brandon is getting so
[55:01] excited what's he at he's at the
[55:03] preaching of the seventh seal and he's
[55:05] not preaching the seventh seal the way
[55:07] he preached the sixth so quit expecting
[55:10] him to preach the seventh the way he
[55:12] preaches the sixth
[55:14] don't read the seventh like you read the
[55:15] six read the seventh differently
[55:19] and when he's reading now when he comes
[55:21] to the seventh he says now i was in
[55:22] sabino cain i said lord what is this
[55:24] something hit my hand i looked at it the
[55:26] rocks thundered out it thundered out
[55:27] that shook the rocks it's the king of
[55:29] the sword and he says there's only one
[55:31] the king and he only has one sword and
[55:33] that's the word he said oh praise god he
[55:35] gets excited with his holy word laying
[55:37] here it's the word amen
[55:41] it's the word so what is this it's the
[55:43] word
[55:45] and now
[55:46] he goes on he says and what a day we're
[55:48] living in what a great thing see the
[55:50] myst see the mystery and the secret
[55:54] we're showing you the mystery and the
[55:56] secret what's the mystery in the secret
[55:58] it's whatever was in his hand
[56:01] it's the word
[56:04] standing there when this left me
[56:06] something just come to me and said don't
[56:08] fear
[56:08] now i didn't hear no voice
[56:12] like on the inside of me spoke
[56:18] i didn't hear no voice
[56:19] like on the inside of me spoke
[56:22] i had to just tell you the truth just
[56:24] exactly what happened something hit and
[56:26] said don't fear
[56:28] this is that third pool
[56:31] that wasn't an audible voice amen that
[56:34] was hey listen i just want to say it
[56:36] this way let's back up the to first
[56:38] kings when elijah was in the uh in the
[56:41] cave all alone all by himself he was in
[56:44] the little room all alone and there was
[56:46] fire and earthquake and there was all
[56:48] these if anybody had been in the
[56:49] vicinity around there they would have
[56:51] heard the earthquake shake
[56:53] they would have heard the thunder amen
[56:55] or the wind
[56:56] bust those rocks they would have heard
[56:57] the fire come roaring through amen but
[57:00] there was something that was spoken in
[57:02] silence
[57:07] silence
[57:08] there was something spoken in silence
[57:11] and only the one it was intended for
[57:13] could hear it and he heard a still small
[57:15] voice what was it the word where did he
[57:18] hear it down inside of him
[57:22] listen this is why this is the very
[57:24] reason why brother branham cannot tell
[57:27] you what the seventh seal is
[57:29] [Music]
[57:30] this is the reason
[57:32] he can't come and say listen here's a
[57:34] flow chart and here's a graph he was
[57:36] told amen this will be
[57:38] he was told something down inside of me
[57:41] not an audible voice but something like
[57:42] down on the inside of me said don't fear
[57:45] this is the third pool
[57:48] and when he goes this is the third pool
[57:50] he goes right back to the vision he had
[57:52] seven years ago in the vision of where
[57:54] he was trying to fish and catch those
[57:56] rainbow trout out in the deep water and
[57:58] the rain joe trout are the covenant fish
[58:00] the children of god they were in the
[58:01] deep water and he was trying to catch
[58:03] them
[58:04] and there was all kinds of preachers out
[58:06] there fishing
[58:08] catch the vision
[58:10] everybody's trying to catch fish but
[58:12] brother branham is trying to catch the
[58:14] rainbow trout in the deep water
[58:18] and he knows how to fish and he's got a
[58:21] technique and the ministers gather all
[58:23] around and he starts explaining his
[58:25] technique and that's where he got in
[58:27] trouble because he explained the first
[58:29] pull sign in the hand and the second
[58:31] pulled discernment and he spent too much
[58:33] time explaining them and on the second
[58:35] pull he pulled it too hard and caught a
[58:37] little bitty fish that was just like
[58:39] skin over the lure just like them other
[58:41] ones was catching
[58:43] so he's catching the same fish jack coe
[58:45] was catching and a.a allen was catching
[58:47] oral roberts was catching
[58:51] but it wasn't the kind of fish he was
[58:53] going after
[58:56] and he was
[58:58] and so there was supposed to be a third
[59:00] pull in the technique
[59:02] first pulled attract attention to little
[59:04] fish second pool to scare the little
[59:05] fish away amen and the third pull would
[59:08] get the big fish because when the little
[59:10] fish scattered it would get the
[59:11] attention of the big fish they would
[59:12] come closer and on the third pool they
[59:14] would get hooked
[59:15] that was the technique but he messed it
[59:18] up on the second pole
[59:20] and he got his line all tangled he said
[59:22] i pulled too hard
[59:25] and he said i heard a voice say
[59:27] don't get your line tangled
[59:29] and at first i told you not to do that
[59:32] and he said oh god i'm a stupid person
[59:34] forgive me
[59:36] he said don't get your line tangled at a
[59:37] time like this and he had line in his
[59:39] hand and then he looked and it was a
[59:40] baby shoe we went through all of this
[59:42] with the big cord he's trying to lace it
[59:44] he told him you can't teach pentecostal
[59:46] babies supernatural things leave them
[59:48] alone
[59:49] so quit trying to teach them
[59:52] that's what he was always trying to do
[59:54] explain it explain and explain it but
[59:56] the whole point of the vision is to get
[59:59] him not to explain it
[1:00:04] then he comes amen and then he's brought
[1:00:06] up on high and he sees a big tent like a
[1:00:08] cathedral amen and inside he sees people
[1:00:11] coming around and inside on the
[1:00:12] platforms a little room and people are
[1:00:14] going into the little room amen and
[1:00:15] they're going in afflicted and they're
[1:00:17] coming out whole and there's a reporter
[1:00:19] trying to ask them hey man what happened
[1:00:20] and they said i don't know they can't
[1:00:22] explain what happened but they went in
[1:00:24] one by one by themselves in the little
[1:00:26] room
[1:00:28] and they were afflicted and now they're
[1:00:30] whole
[1:00:34] i hope you're not looking for a little
[1:00:36] room somewhere under a cathedral so you
[1:00:38] can walk into it
[1:00:41] i hope you're not looking for brother
[1:00:43] ben to come back and set up a tent
[1:00:44] somewhere and build a little wooden box
[1:00:46] in there
[1:00:51] but i hope you're understanding that all
[1:00:54] of those people were afflicted what
[1:00:56] caused affliction the fall
[1:00:59] what caused the fall unbelief
[1:01:02] what's being fixed in this little box
[1:01:08] it's more than legs it's more than
[1:01:10] crutches it's more than a wheelchair
[1:01:12] it's more than that amen i don't care if
[1:01:15] i limp the rest of my life i don't want
[1:01:17] to limp spiritually anymore amen i want
[1:01:19] the unbelief washed away i want the
[1:01:21] revelation of the word to change the
[1:01:23] effects of unbelief in my life
[1:01:26] that's what caused all the affliction
[1:01:28] they come into this little room amen and
[1:01:30] what did the angel lord said i'll meet
[1:01:31] you in there amen and he saw that pillar
[1:01:33] of fire go down there and so what was in
[1:01:35] there amen it was the pillar of fire
[1:01:37] what is the pillar of fire the lord
[1:01:39] himself
[1:01:41] what is the new birth brother branham
[1:01:42] amen it's the revelation of jesus christ
[1:01:44] personally to you
[1:01:48] there was something going on as they
[1:01:50] would get in contact with christ one by
[1:01:53] one as an individual and guess what it
[1:01:55] was it was silent nobody else knew
[1:01:58] somebody on the outside has a tablet
[1:02:00] trying to write down what went on inside
[1:02:02] amen and the person coming out can't
[1:02:04] explain what went on inside but where i
[1:02:06] was afflicted now i'm home
[1:02:10] this is a spiritual fulfillment
[1:02:15] and he says
[1:02:16] he was told
[1:02:18] he said that will be
[1:02:20] your third pool
[1:02:23] that will be your third pool and you
[1:02:26] won't tell it to nobody
[1:02:30] then on salbino canyon when the voice
[1:02:32] speaks within him
[1:02:34] he said don't fear this is your third
[1:02:36] pool
[1:02:39] sabino canyon was a sword in the hand
[1:02:41] not a tent in a box
[1:02:45] do you understand
[1:02:46] he's saying this is the same thing so
[1:02:49] the sword in the hand and the tent and
[1:02:51] the little box and the lord and there
[1:02:53] it's the same thing that'll be your
[1:02:54] third pull this is your third pole but
[1:02:56] it doesn't look the same
[1:02:59] one looks like a tent with people
[1:03:00] walking an afflicted coming out whole
[1:03:02] the other one's just a sword in your
[1:03:03] hand how can that be your third pull and
[1:03:06] how can this be the third pool
[1:03:10] so when you go into the box you'll have
[1:03:11] a sword for the third pool
[1:03:14] he said the sword is the word amen it's
[1:03:16] the word what is this this is the third
[1:03:19] ball
[1:03:20] this is the very thing that will attract
[1:03:23] and catch the rainbow trout and bring
[1:03:25] him into the kingdom of god this is the
[1:03:28] very thing what is it it's the word
[1:03:31] what was the tent in the box and the guy
[1:03:33] is it's the same thing it's the third
[1:03:35] pool
[1:03:37] it's the word to the individual
[1:03:40] one person
[1:03:42] one at a time to everybody else it's
[1:03:45] silent
[1:03:49] nobody else can hear what god revealed
[1:03:51] to you all they can do is see the effect
[1:03:55] coming out of the box they could see the
[1:03:58] effect but nobody knew what happened in
[1:04:00] the box
[1:04:03] in the little room something happened i
[1:04:05] can't explain to you what happened but
[1:04:07] something happened so nobody knows
[1:04:09] what's in secret
[1:04:12] nobody heard what took place
[1:04:15] but they could see the effect
[1:04:18] and now nobody nobody knows what you've
[1:04:21] heard
[1:04:24] nobody's heard what you heard
[1:04:26] nobody knows what you know
[1:04:31] what do you mean nobody knows what i
[1:04:32] know
[1:04:34] listen
[1:04:36] nobody knows what god revealed to you
[1:04:39] about you and about this message
[1:04:43] i mean you can act like you've
[1:04:45] had an experience with god you can
[1:04:47] pretend you but no nobody heard it
[1:04:49] nobody was there no it was in silence
[1:04:58] he said now back to the seventh ceo said
[1:05:00] now i didn't hear no voice like the
[1:05:02] inside of me spoke i have to just tell
[1:05:04] you the truth just exactly what happened
[1:05:06] something hit and said don't fear this
[1:05:08] is that third pool
[1:05:10] third pool you remember it you've had so
[1:05:12] many impersonators on this what you've
[1:05:14] tried to explain but said don't even try
[1:05:16] this
[1:05:17] do you remember it how many remembers
[1:05:18] that vision why it's all over the tape
[1:05:21] and everywhere that's been about seven
[1:05:23] six seven years ago been seven years ago
[1:05:25] said don't try to explain that this is
[1:05:28] the third pull i'll meet you in there
[1:05:32] what did he just do he just tied those
[1:05:34] two things together because the sword in
[1:05:36] his hand he said this is your third pool
[1:05:38] but seven years ago he said i'll meet
[1:05:41] you in there this will be your third
[1:05:43] pool and now he said this is the third
[1:05:45] pool i'll meet you in there
[1:05:51] praise god
[1:05:54] explain all that brother ted i can't
[1:05:58] i can't
[1:06:00] not because i'm not allowed to because i
[1:06:02] can't i really can't explain them
[1:06:06] but something's thundering in my heart
[1:06:08] amen amen amen and i can't explain it in
[1:06:12] details i can't explain it mechanical i
[1:06:14] can't show you on a graph i can't list
[1:06:16] it on a powerpoint i can't get you into
[1:06:18] a place where you now realize i'm in the
[1:06:20] little room and what am i here i can't
[1:06:22] do it for you nobody can do it for you
[1:06:24] it's something that you and god alone go
[1:06:30] through you can't explain it
[1:06:34] you hear it
[1:06:36] you receive it you believe it i don't
[1:06:38] even know how to i don't even know what
[1:06:39] terms to use
[1:06:43] he says
[1:06:44] in in the seventh seal
[1:06:48] he said i'd better stop right there
[1:06:50] i just feel checked not to say no more
[1:06:52] about it you know my experience first
[1:06:54] time i read the seventh seal that was
[1:06:56] like the most anticlimactic statement in
[1:06:58] the whole world for me
[1:07:02] i was looking for him to do what he did
[1:07:04] the first six seals
[1:07:05] and when he didn't do it in the seventh
[1:07:07] year i was disappointed
[1:07:11] and i didn't see what i was looking at
[1:07:17] i was looking right at it
[1:07:19] i was reading it but i wasn't seeing it
[1:07:25] i just feel checked not to say no more
[1:07:26] about it so just remember the seventh
[1:07:28] seal the reason it was not open the
[1:07:30] reason it did not reveal it no one
[1:07:32] should know about it
[1:07:38] so are we supposed to know about the
[1:07:39] seven seal or not
[1:07:45] the reason it's not real that no one
[1:07:47] should know about it
[1:07:51] let's go back to the vision whenever you
[1:07:53] catch a statement like that don't get
[1:07:55] off in the weeds
[1:07:56] go back to the vision
[1:07:59] each one lit into a little room
[1:08:02] where the pillar of fire was
[1:08:04] by themselves
[1:08:06] they came in afflicted they came out
[1:08:08] whole without being able to comprehend
[1:08:10] what happened to them that just
[1:08:11] something changed
[1:08:14] right
[1:08:17] but brother branham says
[1:08:19] he says the reason i did not reveal it
[1:08:21] did not reveal that no one should know
[1:08:23] about it
[1:08:24] no one should know about it
[1:08:26] but when i ask you the person who came
[1:08:28] out of the little room did they know
[1:08:29] about it
[1:08:32] so no one should know about it doesn't
[1:08:34] mean
[1:08:34] nobody will ever catch the revelation
[1:08:39] but he's not allowed to explain this one
[1:08:41] like he did the other two
[1:08:46] no one should know about it and i want
[1:08:48] you to know before i even knowed one
[1:08:50] word about that that vision come years
[1:08:52] ago you remember that and here it is
[1:08:54] just as this other has slides right
[1:08:56] straight into the word exactly where it
[1:08:57] was and god knows my heart i never one
[1:09:00] time thought of such a thing as that and
[1:09:01] here it was it's later than we think
[1:09:04] oh my just sows it from god for it fits
[1:09:08] exactly in the promises of god from the
[1:09:10] end from the end of the message you
[1:09:13] notice now for the end of time message
[1:09:16] this seal
[1:09:17] so this seventh seal is the end of time
[1:09:19] message
[1:09:21] have you heard the end of time message
[1:09:23] that's what he said this seal was
[1:09:26] he's revealed all the six seals but he
[1:09:28] don't say nothing about the seven
[1:09:30] and the end time seal when it starts
[1:09:33] will be absolutely a total secret
[1:09:36] according to the bible
[1:09:39] i just like to make this statement
[1:09:42] for everybody who would say that the
[1:09:44] seventh seal is not open
[1:09:47] i would say how would you know
[1:09:52] how can you say that
[1:09:55] the seventh seal not open he says when
[1:09:57] the end time seal when it starts it'll
[1:09:58] be absolutely a total secret according
[1:10:00] to the bible when it starts it'll be
[1:10:03] absolute a total secret well the seventh
[1:10:05] seal is not open
[1:10:07] how do you know
[1:10:09] it's an absolute total secret
[1:10:14] according to the bible when it starts
[1:10:16] it'll be an absolute total secret
[1:10:19] oh praise be to god
[1:10:26] it'd be a total secret according to the
[1:10:27] bible
[1:10:29] and before knowing that remember
[1:10:30] revelation 10 1-7

[1:10:49] it's the end of time seal he calls it
[1:10:51] all these things
[1:10:52] but he says we're here we're at the end
[1:10:54] time the opening of the seventh seal
[1:10:57] but i don't think it opened oh my
[1:10:59] goodness how would you know
[1:11:02] unless you went through the little room

[1:11:08] seventh seal now how did i know the
[1:11:10] other day last sunday a week ago today

[1:11:13] humble remember god deals in little
[1:11:15] things i didn't realize what it really
[1:11:18] was talking about and now i see it what

[1:11:22] told you we're at the end of time the
[1:11:24] opening of the seventh seal how did i
[1:11:26] know a week ago when i said don't look
[1:11:28] for big things remember when we got to
[1:11:30] the end of
[1:11:31] god hiding himself in simplicity he says
[1:11:33] i hope that the message accomplished
[1:11:35] that the purpose it was spoke for to not
[1:11:37] have you look for big flowery things
[1:11:40] and now he comes and tells you when this
[1:11:43] end time seal when the seventh seal is
[1:11:45] open it'll be absolute a total secret
[1:11:47] according to the bible but he says now

[1:13:17] way you think that something like that
[1:13:18] would be revealed in the vatican but it
[1:13:20] comes like john the baptist

[1:14:13] caught up in the constellation bringing
[1:14:14] them back they were bringing him back

[1:14:48] they brought me back here for this
[1:14:50] message tonight
[1:14:53] now the voice of that great thunder and
[1:14:55] the mission that was brought here has
[1:14:57] been revealed
[1:14:59] and proven that it was of god just think
[1:15:01] now i knew not those seals and they've
[1:15:03] been revealed this week did anybody
[1:15:05] think of that of those seven angels
[1:15:07] being this
[1:15:08] being the message that has come forth
[1:15:10] them angels bring me back here for that
[1:15:16] and questions and answers from 1964 he
[1:15:19] gets a question that says have the seven
[1:15:21] thunders which equals the seven
[1:15:22] mysteries already been revealed
[1:15:25] were they revealed in the seven seals
[1:15:27] but they are are yet not known to us as
[1:15:29] the thunders yet
[1:15:31] it's a good question
[1:15:33] and the answer is no they were revealed
[1:15:35] in the seven seals that's what the
[1:15:37] thunders was about
[1:15:40] the seven thunders that had uttered
[1:15:42] their voices and no one could make out
[1:15:44] what it was john knew what it was but he
[1:15:46] was forbidden to write him but he said
[1:15:48] but the seventh angel in the days of his
[1:15:50] sounding the seven mysteries of the
[1:15:52] seven thunders would be revealed
[1:15:55] and the seventh angel is a messenger of
[1:15:57] the seventh church age
[1:15:59] so he's telling you during the message
[1:16:01] of the seventh church age the seven
[1:16:03] thunders would sound down what was that
[1:16:06] it was the seven seals that's what the
[1:16:08] seven seals was all about
[1:16:10] it was the sounding of those seven
[1:16:12] thunders
[1:16:14] again in the seven still it says seven
[1:16:16] god's perfect number seven
[1:16:18] just right down the road seven thunders
[1:16:20] uttered straight together like they're
[1:16:21] spelling out something
[1:16:24] all that time john started to write he
[1:16:26] said don't write it jesus never spoke of
[1:16:28] it john couldn't write him angels know
[1:16:30] nothing about it
[1:16:32] okay let's read this again i don't want
[1:16:34] you to get lost in the details hang with
[1:16:36] me now we're talking about the seven
[1:16:38] thunders brother branham said they were
[1:16:39] revealed in the seven seals that's what
[1:16:41] the thunders was about
[1:16:43] he said and he says uh
[1:16:47] he says listen
[1:16:50] the seven thunders that uttered their
[1:16:51] voices and no one could make it out
[1:16:53] that's what the thunders was about uh
[1:16:55] was revealed in those seals but the
[1:16:56] seventh angel in the days of his
[1:16:58] sounding the seven mysteries of the
[1:16:59] seven thunders would be revealed so in
[1:17:01] the days of the sounding of the seventh
[1:17:02] church aged messenger those seven
[1:17:04] thunders would be revealed that's what
[1:17:06] the seals was all about
[1:17:08] that's what preaching the seals was all
[1:17:09] about now listen to what he says here
[1:17:12] god's perfect number seven he knocks on
[1:17:14] the pulpit six times just right down the
[1:17:17] road seven thunders uttering straight
[1:17:19] together like they're spelling out
[1:17:20] something what does he say like spelling
[1:17:22] out something like they're trying to get
[1:17:24] you to realize something like they're
[1:17:26] trying to explain
[1:17:28] something notice at that time john
[1:17:31] started to write and said don't write it
[1:17:33] so when we see the seven thunders
[1:17:35] uttered john was told to write
[1:17:37] everything that he saw and everything
[1:17:38] that he heard so he picks up his pen to
[1:17:40] write amen and he says don't write what
[1:17:42] the seven thunders uttered he said don't
[1:17:44] write it then he says jesus never spoke
[1:17:47] of it
[1:17:49] john couldn't write it
[1:17:51] angels know nothing about it
[1:17:53] what is it it's the thing that jesus
[1:17:56] said even the angels of heaven didn't
[1:17:58] know nothing about it see he didn't know
[1:18:00] it himself said only god would know it
[1:18:09] what is the mystery that jesus said
[1:18:12] angels don't know about and he himself
[1:18:13] don't know about but only god knows
[1:18:16] let's go to mark 13.
[1:18:24] he said this is the mystery that the
[1:18:25] seven thunders were spelling out
[1:18:29] they're spelling seven in a row like
[1:18:31] they're spelling out something
[1:18:36] he says at that time john started to
[1:18:38] write it but he was forbidden to write
[1:18:39] it jesus never spoke of it remember
[1:18:42] brother benham through the seals and the
[1:18:44] sixth seal he took you back to matthew
[1:18:46] chapter 24 when they asked when will be
[1:18:48] the end of the world and the sign of
[1:18:49] your coming and all these things take
[1:18:50] place and he starts to answer him and
[1:18:52] jesus in matthew 24 takes him through
[1:18:54] six seals but he doesn't say anything
[1:18:56] about the seventh
[1:18:58] that's what he's speaking of here jesus
[1:19:00] never spoke of it john couldn't write it
[1:19:01] angels know nothing about it what is it
[1:19:04] it's the thing that jesus said even the
[1:19:06] angels of heaven didn't know nothing
[1:19:07] about he didn't know it himself and only
[1:19:10] god would know it
[1:19:12] mark 13
[1:19:15] and 28
[1:19:18] now learn a parable of the fig tree
[1:19:20] that's israel
[1:19:22] when her branches is yet tender and
[1:19:24] putted forth leaves and know what that
[1:19:25] summer is near when she's early in her
[1:19:28] nationhood
[1:19:32] so you in like manner when you shall see
[1:19:34] these things come to pass know that it
[1:19:36] is not even at the doors verily i say
[1:19:38] unto you that this generation shall not
[1:19:40] pass to all these things be done heaven
[1:19:42] and earth shall pass away but my word
[1:19:44] shall not pass away but of that day and
[1:19:46] that hour knoweth no man no not the
[1:19:49] angels which are in heaven neither the
[1:19:50] son but the father
[1:19:56] it's the mystery of his coming
[1:20:01] in the seventh seal he says now there
[1:20:02] was some reason that god let those seven
[1:20:04] voices be thundered because it must come
[1:20:08] we find that christ the lamb took the
[1:20:10] book in his hand and he opened the
[1:20:12] seventh seal but you see it's a hidden
[1:20:14] mystery no one knows it
[1:20:16] but it it's right along with what he
[1:20:18] said no one would know his coming they
[1:20:21] also would not know about the seventh
[1:20:23] under mystery so you see it's connected
[1:20:26] together
[1:20:28] what's connected together the seventh
[1:20:30] seal his the mystery of his coming
[1:20:34] and the seventh under mystery are all
[1:20:37] connected together that's the mystery
[1:20:39] that those seven thunders were spelling
[1:20:41] out there was something behind that was
[1:20:44] laying under those seven thunders there
[1:20:46] was a mystery being revealed in the
[1:20:48] preaching of the seven thunders
[1:20:51] and that mystery was the same thing john
[1:20:53] was told not to write that jesus didn't
[1:20:55] speak of that angels knew nothing about
[1:20:56] that the son didn't know but only the
[1:20:58] father himself needed
[1:21:01] let's go to revelation chapter eight
[1:21:04] i think i can just wrap up in just a
[1:21:05] couple minutes
[1:21:15] revelations 8 1 and when he opened the
[1:21:17] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[1:21:19] about the space of half an hour
[1:21:23] now let's go over to revelation 10
[1:21:26] 1 and i saw another mighty angel come
[1:21:28] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[1:21:30] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[1:21:32] face was it were the sun and his feet as
[1:21:34] pillars of fire he handed his hand a
[1:21:36] little book open and he set his right
[1:21:38] foot upon the sea and his left foot upon
[1:21:40] the earth and he cried with a loud voice
[1:21:41] as when a lion roareth and when he had
[1:21:43] cried seven thunders uttered their
[1:21:45] voices
[1:21:46] when the seven thunders had uttered
[1:21:47] their voices i was about to write and i
[1:21:49] heard a voice from heaven saying unto me
[1:21:51] seal up those things which the seven
[1:21:53] thunders uttered and write them not
[1:21:56] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[1:21:58] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[1:22:00] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[1:22:02] liveth forever and ever who created
[1:22:04] heaven and the things that therein are
[1:22:05] and the earth and the things that
[1:22:06] therein are in the sea the things which
[1:22:08] are therein that there should be time no
[1:22:10] longer
[1:22:11] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:22:13] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:22:14] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:22:16] finished as he had declared to his
[1:22:18] servants the prophets
[1:22:21] brother branham said revelations 8 1 and
[1:22:23] revelation 10 are the same thing
[1:22:28] and it's also the mystery of his coming
[1:22:36] in the seventh seal he says when will it
[1:22:38] be brother branham i cannot tell you i
[1:22:40] do not know but one of these days if we
[1:22:41] ever meet again on this earth we're
[1:22:43] going to meet yonder at the judgment
[1:22:44] seat of christ and you'll find out that
[1:22:46] in the room
[1:22:47] the revelation coming from god just like
[1:22:50] all the rest of them has
[1:22:52] what's he talking about the revelation
[1:22:54] that came to him in the room on the
[1:22:56] seventh seal was just like the first six
[1:22:59] that revelation came to me in the room
[1:23:01] just like the other ones has
[1:23:03] one of the mysteries of that seal one of
[1:23:06] the mysteries of that seal
[1:23:08] the reason it wasn't revealed it was
[1:23:10] seven thunders that uttered their voices
[1:23:13] and there it is perfectly because
[1:23:15] nothing knows anything about it wasn't
[1:23:16] even written so we're at the end time we
[1:23:20] are here
[1:23:22] what did he just get done he's finishing
[1:23:24] preaching the seven thunders and he's
[1:23:26] telling you what is that mystery it's
[1:23:28] the seven thunders and he's just
[1:23:30] finished preaching the seven thunders
[1:23:31] and he's saying we're here and he's not
[1:23:33] allowed to tell you this is that he's
[1:23:36] you've got to catch it amen and the
[1:23:38] silence of not what's being spoken there
[1:23:40] has to be a voice from down on the
[1:23:42] inside that says that is that amen
[1:23:45] that is exactly what the word said
[1:23:47] that's exactly what he's pointing to
[1:23:49] that's exactly what he's talking about
[1:23:51] but if you're waiting for him to say
[1:23:52] this is that he's not allowed to do that
[1:23:55] there's a silence still in the seventh
[1:23:57] seal and the silence and the seventh
[1:23:59] seal is only broken inside of you when
[1:24:02] the voice thunders from down inside of
[1:24:04] you
[1:24:06] it says that's nothing but the truth
[1:24:10] the breaking of the seventh seal it was
[1:24:12] broken the sounding of those thunders
[1:24:13] that was the first part of that
[1:24:15] revelation amen the seven thunders
[1:24:17] uttered out that was the first part of
[1:24:19] that which was tied to revelations 8 1
[1:24:21] which is tied to the coming of the lord
[1:24:24] but it was silence and he's not allowed
[1:24:26] to explain it
[1:24:27] he explained the first and second he's
[1:24:28] not allowed to explain this one what is
[1:24:30] it it's the word what was the preaching
[1:24:32] of those seven thunders the unwritten
[1:24:34] word amen john couldn't write it it
[1:24:36] wasn't written it was the white stone in
[1:24:38] junior jackson's
[1:24:39] dream
[1:24:41] so the line had never shown unwritten
[1:24:42] word it's the word it's the word it's
[1:24:45] the word and so now when the word comes
[1:24:47] into his hand and day by day he receives
[1:24:49] it from an angel and he comes out and
[1:24:51] speaks the word the unwritten word he
[1:24:53] shows it in the written word
[1:24:59] when he gets to the end of that
[1:25:01] he's telling you
[1:25:03] that what is it what is rev revelation 8
[1:25:06] 1 is what couldn't be spoken jesus never
[1:25:09] spoke of it in matthew 24 john was
[1:25:12] forbidden to write it
[1:25:14] the angels don't know about it even the
[1:25:16] son don't know only the father
[1:25:20] it's the mystery of his coming
[1:25:24] don't be offended in him
[1:25:28] because it's not like what most people
[1:25:29] were looking for
[1:25:32] it's not what the world was looking for
[1:25:35] brother ben said we don't look for nail
[1:25:37] scars we look for the word made manifest
[1:25:40] what is the preaching of the seven
[1:25:41] thunders the word made manifest
[1:25:45] when what was sealed is unsealed under
[1:25:47] the
[1:25:48] the mystery of god shall be finished in
[1:25:50] the voice of the seventh angel what is
[1:25:52] that amen it's the unsealing of the
[1:25:53] mystery
[1:25:56] it's the word
[1:25:58] it's the third pool
[1:26:01] it's all connected together
[1:26:05] he says
[1:26:09] i'll read this last sentence again
[1:26:11] one of the mystery of that seal the
[1:26:13] reason it wasn't revealed it was seven
[1:26:15] thunders that uttered their voices and
[1:26:18] there it is perfectly because nothing
[1:26:20] knows anything about it wasn't even
[1:26:22] written
[1:26:23] so we're at the end time
[1:26:25] we
[1:26:26] are
[1:26:27] here
[1:26:29] in the breach this is all the way back
[1:26:31] before he starts preaching the seals he
[1:26:32] preached gods and simplicity preaches
[1:26:33] the breach on revelation chapter 5.
[1:26:36] he said this seven sealed book is
[1:26:38] revealed
[1:26:39] at the time of the seven thunders of
[1:26:42] revelations 10.
[1:26:45] is the seventh seal book revealed yes
[1:26:47] has the sunday town seven thunder
[1:26:49] sounded yes what does that mean
[1:26:56] let's go to revelations chapter five
[1:27:07] verse 1
[1:27:08] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[1:27:10] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:27:12] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:27:13] seals
[1:27:15] and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a
[1:27:16] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[1:27:18] book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:27:20] and no man in heaven nor on earth
[1:27:22] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:27:24] the book neither to look their own
[1:27:26] and i wept much because no man was found
[1:27:28] worthy to open and to read the book
[1:27:30] neither to look thereon
[1:27:32] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[1:27:34] not behold the lion of the tribe of
[1:27:35] judah the root of david hath prevailed
[1:27:37] to open the book and to loose the seven
[1:27:39] seals thereof
[1:27:40] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[1:27:42] throne and the four beasts and in the
[1:27:43] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:27:45] had been slain having seven horns and
[1:27:48] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:27:49] of god sent forth into all the earth
[1:27:52] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:27:55] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:27:57] throne
[1:27:58] let's go to revelation chapter 6 verse 1
[1:28:02] and i saw when the lamb
[1:28:05] when the lamb
[1:28:07] i saw when the lamb
[1:28:09] opened one of the seals
[1:28:11] and i heard it were the noise of thunder
[1:28:13] and one of the four beasts saying
[1:28:15] come and see
[1:28:17] [Music]
[1:28:18] brother branham said in the sixth seal
[1:28:20] so now tonight we have assembled here to
[1:28:23] hear your word and as we have been
[1:28:25] studying in this certain person of the
[1:28:26] scripture that the lamb was the only one
[1:28:30] that could open the seals or to loose
[1:28:32] them
[1:28:37] who opened those seals
[1:28:40] why did he open those seals
[1:28:42] how do you know the seals were open
[1:28:44] because of the seven thunders
[1:28:47] when did you hear the seven thunders
[1:28:50] in those consecutive nights of services
[1:28:54] when he was given the revelation of the
[1:28:56] unwritten word what john was not allowed
[1:28:58] to write when he was given the
[1:28:59] revelation of the unwritten word it tied
[1:29:02] you right back to the silence from
[1:29:04] revelation chapter eight they're the
[1:29:06] same thing the revelation of the
[1:29:07] unwritten word is revealing what was
[1:29:10] done in that silence what was that
[1:29:12] silence it's his coming
[1:29:15] and i'll just ask you a couple questions
[1:29:18] are you married to the lamb
[1:29:20] is this the invisible union
[1:29:22] is the wedding here
[1:29:24] then he has to be here
[1:29:27] you can't marry somebody who's not
[1:29:28] present
[1:29:29] now is the bride pregnant with the word
[1:29:32] has he pregnanted somebody he's not
[1:29:34] married to
[1:29:36] can he marry somebody when he's not
[1:29:38] present
[1:29:39] can he pregnant somebody without being
[1:29:41] here
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:29:43] see it's it's so simple we can walk
[1:29:46] right over the top of it because we have
[1:29:48] in our mind we're looking for the
[1:29:50] denominational picture of a giant image
[1:29:53] of jesus coming down and we all stretch
[1:29:55] our hands out and we all begin to float
[1:29:57] up to him but that's a denominational
[1:29:59] idea
[1:30:02] it's not it's not the scripture it's not
[1:30:04] what brother benham told us amen
[1:30:06] he don't look for nail scars we look for
[1:30:08] the word made manifest
[1:30:14] it's the silence of the seventh seal
[1:30:21] it was silent
[1:30:26] but it was silent in the cave too
[1:30:30] but elijah heard something
[1:30:35] see
[1:30:36] the rapture is even not what we expected
[1:30:40] because brother brahm teaches us in the
[1:30:41] rapture that there's three stages to it
[1:30:43] and it's not even what we expected
[1:30:48] we were looking for something and
[1:30:50] missing what we were seeing
[1:30:53] and i want to go back to the first
[1:30:54] scripture
[1:30:56] when you think you know something you
[1:30:57] know nothing as you ought
[1:31:00] we talk about all these things and see
[1:31:01] all these things in the seventh seal
[1:31:03] what brother benham said the seven
[1:31:04] thunders and the silence and i still say
[1:31:07] we don't know anything as we ought to
[1:31:08] know
[1:31:10] i still think there's so much for us to
[1:31:11] understand there's still things i read
[1:31:13] and i don't know how it fits there's
[1:31:14] still things i read the prophet saying i
[1:31:16] still don't know what he means by that
[1:31:18] amen but one thing i know
[1:31:20] is that this is the truth amen and i
[1:31:22] know this is our lord and i know our
[1:31:24] lord is the one who opened those seals
[1:31:26] it wasn't a man it was him and he
[1:31:27] couldn't open those seals until he came
[1:31:29] forth to take the book and to lose the
[1:31:30] seals and that was the seven thunders
[1:31:33] i don't know the rest of the picture
[1:31:35] always i don't know how it will manifest
[1:31:37] in coming days i don't always know what
[1:31:39] the next step is but i know that's
[1:31:41] nothing but the truth
[1:31:44] not because somebody told me i read it
[1:31:46] and read it and i heard it and heard it
[1:31:48] but one day it was like thunder on the
[1:31:50] inside it's not something i heard with
[1:31:52] my ears but something within the inside
[1:31:54] of me said that's it amen that is it
[1:31:57] that is what he's trying to tell me
[1:32:01] and what he was saying and the
[1:32:02] revelation of my heart just began to
[1:32:04] slide together
[1:32:06] and the quotes and the scriptures began
[1:32:08] to slide together
[1:32:10] but as much as that has slid together
[1:32:12] i still say when we think we know
[1:32:14] something we know nothing as we ought
[1:32:17] there's still more to this revelation
[1:32:19] friends there's still something more
[1:32:20] amen when brother brandon said this is
[1:32:22] the first part of that of that seal amen
[1:32:25] was those seven thunders he said it
[1:32:26] unfolded in a three-part manner
[1:32:29] showing that even the opening of the
[1:32:31] seventh seal amen is not just a pinpoint
[1:32:34] prick seven seal opens closes that's all
[1:32:36] of it it's done coming of the lord
[1:32:37] period
[1:32:39] he said it unfolded in a threefold
[1:32:40] manner
[1:32:42] he said this is the first part of that
[1:32:44] seal is those seven thunders
[1:32:47] so when we think we know something we
[1:32:49] know nothing as we ought to
[1:32:51] but i say god i want to know
[1:32:54] all that i ought to
[1:32:59] i want to see what i'm looking at
[1:33:02] because what i'm looking at thrills my
[1:33:04] soul
[1:33:05] what i'm looking at is the most exciting
[1:33:07] thing that i've ever seen in my life but
[1:33:09] i want to see what i'm looking at i want
[1:33:11] to i want the eye sad to see i want you
[1:33:13] to come and reveal to me i want to see
[1:33:16] it more clearly than i've ever seen it
[1:33:17] before in my life show me more reveal
[1:33:20] more open my eyes more
[1:33:25] no matter what
[1:33:26] god does for you no matter what you see
[1:33:29] and what revelation comes don't ever
[1:33:31] stop friends don't ever stop moving
[1:33:33] forward don't ever stop seeking more
[1:33:35] brother branham tells us in the church
[1:33:36] age book above everything else play for
[1:33:38] revelation
[1:33:40] that means above everything else
[1:33:44] more than your food your job more than
[1:33:46] your health and your security pray for
[1:33:48] revelation it means more than security
[1:33:50] it means more than health if you're a
[1:33:52] you need revelation more than
[1:33:54] you need healing in your body
[1:33:56] because with this revelation you can die
[1:33:58] with eternal life inside of you and that
[1:34:00] crippled body will come back new yeah
[1:34:04] more than healing be more more than
[1:34:05] money more than food we need revelation
[1:34:09] divine revelation from the father
[1:34:12] above all pray for revelation don't stop
[1:34:15] just because now god's given me a
[1:34:17] witness in my heart i see those thunders
[1:34:18] i see the opening that was just the
[1:34:20] first part
[1:34:23] but i want to see it all
[1:34:26] this is my lord
[1:34:28] this isn't doctrine
[1:34:30] this isn't teachings this isn't neat fun
[1:34:33] things to preach
[1:34:34] this is my lord
[1:34:36] this is the you look at the book of
[1:34:38] revelation in the book of revelation
[1:34:40] starts the revelation of jesus christ so
[1:34:42] if this is the revelation of jesus
[1:34:43] christ i want to know it all i'm not
[1:34:46] happy with chapter 10.
[1:34:49] got that i don't want i want it all
