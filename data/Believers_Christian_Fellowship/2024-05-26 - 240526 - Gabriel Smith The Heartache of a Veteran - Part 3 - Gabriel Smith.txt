out and uh I'm still learning and uh I trust that um by the uh by my last breath that um I trust that I'll be pleasing to the Lord amen that's my prayer and um uh just appreciate the Lord so um I uh thankful to have have my family with me and uh brother Chad asked uh who who who uh the visitors are to staying with me and I I I had I had to stop for a minute cuz brother husto that's Big Poppy you

there'd only be one man I'd ever called daddy till I met Big Poppy and then you know for some reason it just fits you know so uh I'm happy to have them uh with us this weekend we had a wonderful time and you know I I thinking about uh our pastor you know that that's another name you know I never thought I'd be able to call another man his pastor you know um sometimes we go through hard times in life and uh the road takes unexpected twists and turns that you ain't ready for and uh I just uh appreciate brother Chad in a um in a very special way he's uh uh just a wonderful brother and uh I I'm I'm holding his hand up like Aaron and her was Moses you know I believe that's what we should do right you know uh an elder uh deserves double honor according to the scriptures and so I appreciate our pastor and so his family sister Angie and the children and all Lings I just uh brother Paul we we we got to break bread a little bit but uh we're gonna break bread on the other side brother yeah I think I think we gonna be right beside each other brother yeah we going to live next door brother yeah so praise the Lord big Poppy's going to be on one side brother Paul going to be on the other it's going to be good on be there one of these days isn't it praise the Lord let's um let's uh I just I I I I I got got something on my heart and um it's uh um you know we've been I've been looking at it for quite a while and very familiar um Joel chapter 1 um said the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of bethu hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land have this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and let their children another generation that which the palmerworm haveth left have the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath hath left ha the cankerworm eaten and that way which the cankerworm have left had the caterpillar eaten and I will restore to you the years that the Locust ha eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and I'd like to speak to you uh by the help of the Lord um on the heartache of a veteran uh part three let's just bow our heads precious Lord truly we're grateful to be gathered under the banner of your love and so thankful to be able to come before you this morning uh not in fear but in confidence in assurance that you'll speak to us in the way in which your word said you would and your children has gathered here this morning not to hear a man but to hear from you and Lord I certainly want to be one of those hearers as well and so we just just want to surrender ourselves this morning Lord each one myself the congregation Lord that we would be able to receive something from you this morning to help us along our Christian Journey we ask Lord that you would be welcome in this place that our Spirits would have that welcoming vibration Lord as your Prophet had come in contact with so many times Lord that's an unseen realm but Lord we certainly want that to be the preeminent part of our Lives Lord that we would welcome whatever would come from above Lord that we would be able to have the wisdom to speak your word and your word alone that we would have uh courage to say something that may be cutting but also there would be love behind it that would be able to bring healing Lord we want to surrender in a way that you could have the preeminence and that's my prayer I I will certainly Lord be a fool for you this morning and so I pray in the name that's above every name our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that you would have your way amen and amen praise the Lord you could be seated if you like um you know um we won't need to necessarily um refer back um to the past couple services that I have taken along this subject as it's um um not necessary um but I I know as we as Christians sometimes we um have different expectations of what the Christian walk is going to be when we uh are in the world and all of us maybe have different um depths in which we go into the world some of us may have stayed close to Mom and Dad um maybe Mom and Dad were solid Christians and they were an example in which you uh found confidence in and you never partook way out yonder into the things of the world and and eventually you came to your own testimony and your own personal experience and walk with the Lord and others of us uh maybe not have had that example and um and maybe some of us even had that example and we still went over uh that roadblock that was in the road and crawled right over the top of it or crawled underneath it and all of us have different um paths in which we uh walk this Christian Journey but we're all trying to get to the to the main goal we we're we're trying to uh find uh the path that leads to the almighty that's that's uh that's I believe uh as uh that brother brandom had told one time I believe it was brother Tony zel is Deacon believe he had a dream and uh and in that dream he was and I'm coming off of memory so forgive me if I get something wrong but it's always been something that stuck out to me that uh he he comes up to some famous uh preachers and and they tell him that that see that little man up there and I think he said in bib's overhauls and he said you need to go see him and when he got and Tony zel came to that man it ended up being brother brandham and then uh brother brandham said to him brother brother brother Tony uh uh this is as far as I can take you the prophet of God can only take it so far but but he he did only what a prophet could do and he said but you see those bloody Footprints he said follow those and and that's what we do in this Christian journey is we follow those bloody Footprints and what what what an amazing statement it could be that who would want to follow bloody Footprints but there's something on the inside of us that says I want to follow those bloody Footprints and and it goes beyond just what we can think in our mental intellect I mean thinking of what brother Alistair said it seems crazy what we what we do believe if you really think about it and but but to us for some odd reason it just makes a certain sound it rings true and and I'm thankful that I have those kind of ears that it may be crazy to the world but but it's assurance and confidence to me that that when I uh see God's word and and and and and hear that profit they just ring true together and and and it helps me it gives me Comfort I I find comfort in God's word when I'm on this Christian journey and and uh being that we're we're in the battle that we are and and we all are in a fight uh some of us may be on a Mountaintop right now and and some of us may be in a valley and and it's not uh it's it's not a a easy place to be when you're in the valley but but we all go there at some point in time in our Christian journey and if we would and if we would uh be honest with ourselves when we are in those low spots in life that's when it really is the best experience of a Christian and it doesn't seem like that at the point of time but but it's when you look back that's whenever something Rings true and you realize that that's when you grew the most it it wasn't in the service when when a mighty preacher was preaching and and you felt 10 foot tall and bulletproof but but it was when you was in the lowest Valley it was it was when you didn't feel like bride of Christ and it was when you was at the point of of brink of of giving up on God's word it it it's it's it's at the point when you lost your desire for the word oh come on somebody listen listen we we we all at some point in time or maybe it hasn't and well I said I I mean maybe there is some that always been on the mountain toop and they never been on them low valleys but but there's times in my life and in my own time my own uh I always thought why why Lord I I I can't I can't live what it's telling me to live yes you know there's there's there's times when they're on the battlefield when we got to take a knee and we didn't have that Shield at the right place where supposed to be and that Arrow got through yes sir yes I don't know about you brother but I I I I've been wounded many a time and sometimes it was self-inflicted this old man gets in the way all the time he may be 50 years old today but he still got a whole lot of [Music] vigor and sometimes I I think man I mean you're supposed to be old and you're supposed to slow down but it but Mike it just don't get no easy this old flesh is still rare in the go and and a lot of times in life this flesh is totally contrary to God's [Applause] word but that's whenever we have to have the assurance that there's something deeper on the inside and you know when we think about people that's on the battlefield you know I I I think in the hour that we live that that as you take somebody that's a true veteran you take somebody that's really been on the battlefield you you you take you take somebody that you know thank thankfully by by God's grace my my daddy was a Marine in the times uh uh Vietnam and uh uh but but he was actually station in okanawa which was a a landing plaid a jumping spot to go to take the troops from America to okanawa to Vietnam and and I'm thankful that that he was in that safe space right and and so that was his lot in life and I'm grateful for that because if that wasn't his lot in life there may not have been a brother Gabe but but you take some of those o older those soldiers that didn't stop at okanawa but went to Vietnam and and and you talk to those soldiers that was on the battlefield if if you if you ever come across somebody that's really been on the battlefield and seen their their fellow Brethren Fall by the wayside and die and spill their blood for their own country if if you've ever seen a veteran that that has had to to to to put his uh rifle or or or bear arms and take another man's life for a conviction that he had but but the vast majority of those veterans you won't hear them say nothing about it there there won't be no brag there won't there won't be no flash but when you look in their eyes what you'll see is heartache yes sir because he saw a another Soldier fall whether it was fighting on the right side or the wrong side if he's a true Soldier and a true veteran he still has a heart and a feeling for his Brethren on the battlefield and I I think that we're coming to the hour that we ought to have that same type of Heartache for those that are crossed Enemy Lines you know if you see somebody that loves to fight something's wrong if if you got that old Fighting Spirit you may want to check yourself because remember before they could enter the promised land the old Fighters had to die off and there had to be another generation that rose up that wasn't an old fighter and and it and it and it gives us uh a warning because sometimes you see people and they just love to be combative and and if we would we would realize that some you know brother branom says that whenever whenever we come in in into a conflict with somebody that that we ought to stop what we're doing and go pray so if if you're in a conflict with somebody I want to ask you brother brandom gives us the recipe and and um I'll just read it to you if if now you know uh last night I had 262 slides 262 but uh I cut it down to about 12 something so [Laughter] don't worry I'm not I'm not uh uh we're not going to go through 120 of now it just I just to me though you know um when when you see something um I I don't I don't like to um I like to just if I have 120 sides but if I just go through three but that's the only three the Lord wants you to see to me that's all that it matters and so we as Ministry we study to show oursel approved and we try to lay before the Lord but ultimately I just want you to be blessed amen I want every soul young and old to walk out of here with something that will help them on their Christian Journey because when when we not only are we're fighting here some of us are fight fighting sleep some of us already lost a battle of sleep and and and but others is is fighting right now and had a late night uh thinking of my wife she done you know spent all weekend and cooking and cleaning and washing and helping and you know what I mean sister Mama Angie she was right there with him and and so you know sometimes we have late nights and then that Sunday morning hits and the coffee just don't help right but but whether we're fighting in here or maybe where God has us so hedged off that we're just feeding right like last weekend it was so good Saturday night brother brother alist preaching and I was just so locked in my wife she I was super quiet if y'all didn't know my my my wife said thought he must be tired no I I was just so locked in I forgot to say Amen brother Brian about halfway through the service I realized I'm not saying amen but but I was just so locked in and so God sometimes gives us those moments where every distraction is cut off and it's just it's just the Lord in you and and and it's and it's powerful right and then other times you're the one thinking man everybody's getting something but me right but but you may be the one holding the sword that's fighting off all the other demon so your brother and your sister three rows back can get something if we would take that kind of approach not a defeated approach but an approach that I'm fighting for this I'm at my post of [Music] Duty you may you may be quiet as a mouse but you're at your post of Duty it it's not about how loud we can be look look when when brother Brenham said the devil ain't death the the devil look the devil ain't the devil ain't scared of how loud we can be but one thing that terrifies him is when we have faith that's that's that's when he realizes oh hey hey this guy's something different this sister's something different right but so so when we're in this battle in this thing called life brother Brenham tells us uh he says he says if I have found Grace in your sight through God you take my word on this Brethren if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he is absolutely justly I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil oh my y'all going to need to delete that Facebook app don't mention that amen don't have no veiled you know statement on Facebook don't mention that you take him to prayer before God Amen and don't take it in a way of just a selfish and say well I'm supposed to do this but notice what he says but stand with your your shoulder to his shoulder amen and stand in the presence of God our Father way of prayer should be made in the presence of God say father he's my brother and he is justly he deserves punishment because he's done me evil and I don't see why he did it then let God go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that's man's been through the devil has Twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man but but I wonder how often do we apply that true now I I no doubt guarantee that before I read this quote you knew where I was going heard the quote before but here's the thing how many times have we applied that quote since you knew it before see because a lot of times when the preacher is preaching you know the quotes we we all we we we've been in here 30 you so many times and and that's good to have those things down but is it applied when we're on the battlefield the last time somebody done you wrong did you in your mind take that quote and pull that sister shoulder toosh shoulder right yeah did you take that family member and pull him or her shoulder to shoulder when you was in the prayer closet and did you pray until until God started talking to you it's not just you look the Jesus is not a priest Catholic yeah it's not just confession and say a few obedience and help no you go to prayer and then you wait I wish I didn't delete that slide of that pin wheel but but we live in lady OA and we live in this age technology where everything is so fast but if we would apply this quote in a way I I I dare say it would transform not only your life but the lives of those around you because you know when somebody does you wrong it's not just you think about this how many times does God allow us to hurt one another amen so that not only do you learn but the person learns cuz all things will work out for good and so and so when when you wrong somebody that person has to deal with the pain of whatever was done wrong to them whether misunderstood or misjudged or whatever it may be you you didn't do nothing wrong but then you have to deal with that but then that person that done the wrong if they're a real Christian then they have to deal with that and so God works on both ends because he's molding in making us everything works out for his good sir he says you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get bed down to Earth again you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand cuz you know that he's what he's been through you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody that's right now I know I know that's a hard statement cuz some of us didn't live a sheltered life but God's word is still true no matter how B life you have had amen that's the whole point of being a Christian brother I you know when I I share I share things in my life not because I need material we got the whole message for that I mean I could just read quote after quote after quote but but to me I listen to what brother brandham says and he shares his life experiences and it helps me right cuz he's so transparent and so honest yeah and and and so to me even brother Chad coming back and me being here this past year brother Chad is you know he shared so many uh personal things and his faults and failures and it's like it is it is absolutely transform me as a person because because my pastor can be free and at Liberty to say I'm a human being then it gives me the courage to go oh yeah he's a human I am too right right and and and and so the whole thing of it is is then because remember if it was all about being perfect then Gabriel himself would come here this morning right right but Gabriel can't relate to you like brother Gabe can and and that ain't it's just God chose Fallen man that's right to minister his word but that Fallen man has to be honest of his Fallen condition and and and not be worried about pride and arrogancy and trying to be something that is not we all need the blood of Jesus Christ whether you lived a sheltered life your whole life and you you you can't relate to you know worldly things and and and and you stay close to Mama and Daddy and all those things but still in that your your Battle Is self-righteousness Right your battle your battle is is even though you were sheltered that you don't get a Hardy Spirit on you right and and think that you're just a little bit better oh my where's brother Ben huh yeah right and so and so and and so look I I'll say this this is a tough one look if if if you can go if you walk into Walmart and now all of a sudden you want to roll your cart in the seat of to the scornful which there's [Applause] much or or or or or if you think that you're just too high class you go to Myer [Laughter] hey now don't get me wrong now listen hey wifey now she don't go to Walmart like past 2:00 in the afternoon you know there's only a little window where it's safe right right but the point of it is when when we're in those when we're in those situations you ought to look at that person and see a Soul yes sir amen cuz if it wasn't for the grace of God you would be right beside them right you you know sometimes you you look and say oh they're all drugs and Dr the people listen do you know that's the only pleasure that they have amen they don't have the ears that you have to hear the gospel amen and if we would look at them people cuz you never know maybe their name is on the book because brother brandham says he says you can't stand with a mortal that's not just members of our assembly moral blanket statement right you can't stand in the presence uh stand in a in a with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir even if he is a rank Sinner and what about a brother that has made a mistake though I say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not but if he is wrong well if we take him to the throne of God stand there shoulder to- shoulder with our brother knowing he's IM mortal and maybe his destination rest upon our attitude our attitude yes sir our co-workers that one that rubs you the wrong way but maybe their destination rest upon our attitude remember those people are in your life for purpose but but but if we ain't careful remember we don't want to insulate ourselves but we have to make contact but you say brother Gabe there's heartache that goes with it I know but that's the whole point if you are The Mercy Seat why would you hide the mercy then mercy has to be given and that requires you opening yourself and making yourself vulnerable which is not easy but if we look higher then we will realize and if we're in the presence of God then we'll realize maybe their Eternal destination rest upon my attitude how I interact with them look you know you know you know you know you know sometimes we can say well they were good to me because but if you walk through life every time somebody does good and the first thing you think well come on Friends the the Way Up Is Down you say Brother G I know it's true I know that that's what the prophet of God taught us those that are good to the bride look that's why I say you got to be careful how you interact with that person cuz because the way you interact and you just fet them with the message they may have been good to you but your attitude to them makes them lose their opportunity at an entrance into heaven to be granted eternal life well they had it but they lost it because of your yeah my yeah attitude see it it goes both ways we can look at ourselves but think of the responsibility that we actually are possessors of that when we interact with people not just our assembly but every person when we're at the gas pump where when we're at the drive-thru and they get our order wrong that's when long suffering ought to shine forth when when you're at the restaurant you know what kills me is is is when Christians soon as they're there they they they start looking for opportunities to take away a tip that's shameful absolutely shameful you got pride in your life you try to justify to keep on hold of that money but let me ask you how many times did you go to work and give 100% yeah how many times did you go to work and give 30% did you go to your boss and go hey um you know today I know you paid me for eight but can you just put down two oh yeah see what I'm saying see it's all about the way we appro some of y'all didn't like that to I don't care it's the truth anyhow look hey now you understand what I'm saying I mean my whole point is friends I used to work at a restaurant and you know what when the Christians would come into the to the restaurant all the waitresses and waiters go you know why cuz they' stay forever and they never would tip it's true yeah I used I used to work at Applebees and every Sunday night everybody would complain waiters oh man the Christians oh you know they're going to Fellowship [Music] forever but what did the prophet do remember that that that waitress had a bad day brother brandham gave her extra large tip what he say he had discernment right I'm I'm I just this story comes to my mind but he knew that she had a bad day so you know what I do when I go to a restaurant I always try to make up for the person that didn't tip cuz I don't have that kind of discernment but when I go there I think Lord how many times did I loaf on a job amen how many times did I not give 100% right how many times did I do what I shouldn't be doing and found ways to not do what I should have been doing right but the thing of it is is you got to look across that person and realize maybe they had the worst day of their life oh yeah or maybe a childhood memory just came up and smacked them in the face from something for 30 years ago and you got a face that looks just like the person that hurt him now your attitude can either change them to the good or to the bad see cuz remember we're human beings and we we see things and you know uh sometimes we can look at people and just because they resemble somebody that hurt you in the past you'll treat them different but we have to be mindful of that we have to be mindful of our frailties and our shortcomings and is this okay it's all right you know because being on the battlefield is not easy and when I think of the Saints of old you know we go through schools of suffering for purpose and it's to give us uh a feeling one for the other and it's already 11:40 well so so um I uh you know you think about the children of Israel and they went through some hard times in life and the Bible tells us in numbers 14 but your little ones which ye said should be a prey them will I bring in and they shall know the land which you despise but as for you your carcasses shall fall in the wilderness and your children shall wander in the wilderness 40 years and bear your whoredoms until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness and so there was a a whole generation of young people that had to suffer for the mistakes of a previous generation and unfortunate as it may be um we we uh have to deal with those same mistakes of our forefathers and and and and it happens regardless but you know there came a time uh uh for that uh Next Generation to come up that was actually going to come in and possess the land right and and so they were going to come to um The Plains of Moab and and and Jericho was was the city that they would that they would uh come to and the walls would come we all know the story but but I I want to take you to a spot um where um there was hor that was being committed uh in the camp and uh you know um uh if we could go there it be numbers 25 and uh this is uh where where you have uh uh balum and Moab and all of them uh coming and trying to infiltrate uh the camp of Israel and um um and the the the whoredoms that they committed with the daughters of Moab and uh Israel joining himself unto B peor and the anger of the Lord being kindled and in in numbers 25 and I I'm sure you you you know the story that um they uh the children of Israel were weeping before the the door of the Tabernacle the Tabernacle of the congregation and there was a a uh uh the Next Generation by the by that came up that stood up for amongst the the those that were weeping and his name was uh Phineas uh the son of uh El Eleazar the the son of Aaron the priest and uh his grandpa was Aaron uh and and had and he uh he was zealous uh for God and and the Bible says in in numbers 25 and verse 7 and when finus the son of alos elazar the son of Aaron the priest Sol it he rose up from among the congregation and took a javel in his hand and and he went after the men of Israel into a tent and he th both of them through the man of Israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of Israel and those that died in the plague were 20 and 4,000 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying now I I want you to pay attention to what he tells him cuz Phineas gets a thus saith the Lord from the prophet he says Phineas the son of elazar the son of Aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that I consume not the children of Israel in my jealousy wherefore say behold I give unto him my Covenant of peace and he shall have it and his seat after him even the Covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his God and made an atonement for the children of Israel now I I want you to think if you had the prophet of God after you stood up and and did something that was heroic that that was as we would call it in the uh you know in in a kind of a um terminology it was a game Cher right it it was it was something that that stayed the plague and the hand of God stopped doing what he was going to do and then God tells the prophet tells you you have my not not somebody else's you have my Covenant of peace now I want you to think after that happens how light and fancy free would you be can you imagine if you had William Marian brandham come to you after you done something heroic and say thus saith the Lord John Brooks you have my Covenant of Peace wow wow now I don't know about you brother Franco hey I think brother Phineas had it had it coined before I did after that Covenant of Peace oh my all he could see was baby blue skies and white puffy clouds no doubt it was going to be a brother Phineas day every day yes of his life but but you know what happens in numbers 31 after this was stayed the plague was stayed and God gives him a covenant of Peace God tells the prophet I want you to number a thousand out of every tribe and go to war with Moab and in numbers 316 Moses sent them to war a thousand of every tribe them what how how how did his heart sink no that he said you got 12,000 why you need me I I got the hey I got the Covenant of peace but the Bible specifically says take 12,000 them and Phineas this is the very next time he has spoken of in the Bible after God gives him the Covenant of peace and immediately he sends him to war brother oh preach brother Paul preach brother Paul Amen brother amen see but Phineas has to be in the Bible because as I said at the beginning we come to this Christian walk and and we lay aside our burdens of the world and in our minds we're expecting baby blue skies that's right in white puffy clouds because of that one service where we know God gave us the Covenant the promise of Peace amen and then the very next day he sends us the war sir you know this wasn't there wasn't but a few more days and that Prophet that told him he has the Covenant of peace that prophet would be taken off the scene right how many days did he Wonder Man are you sure he said that same way we do was it just a was it just a good service that I had what what why am I in this battle I thought yes that's the problem you thought brother Gabe thought right yeah and so that's why we have to take God's word because his thoughts are higher than our thoughts and his ways am are higher than our ways his ways are past finding out but he puts people like Phineas in the Holy script so that when we go through these things because remember brother Brenham says you got to go find your character in The Bible and so the brother brandham could pick Elijah and John the Baptist right that's right mine's the thief on the cross Phineas but I found who I am and you have to find who you are you have to be able to identify and find your spot in God's word that's that's the importance of this holy script is that when we go through life we look at these characters and we go wait a minute Mama that's me yes sir right amen yes sir Phineas is a reflection cuz remember we're Kings and Priests right he was third generation Aaron was his grandpa no doubt had all kind of Stories of the prophet and in the Inner Circle and the prophet gave him had thus sayith the Lord Lord over his life right but if we really look at it if we go back let me ask you who is really fit to go on the battlefield yeah it's not the old Fighters brother Paul that's right they're not fit to go on the battlefield right but God was picking a Phineas because in order for us to fight the good fight of faith we must be possessors of the Covenant of peace right there has to be a a quietness and a peace on the inside amen there has to be a confidence and assurance that I have passed from Death unto life and and I have to be confident in my testimony and whether I I I see eye to eye with somebody else that if something raises up in you and you want to check that's right amen and I'm sure we've all at some point in time been there but once we've been on the battlefield a few times we ought to learn for that and go wait a minute that don't work and then we ought to walk with reverence and humil humity going God I I I don't want to misstep I don't care who they are I I don't want my my face to pop up on their screen at the white Throne judgment in a negative way amen right I I I want it to be all positive that I was the one there longsuffering for him I was the one there interceding for him I was the one that had the outstretched arm I was the one that was fighting for them amen and if we are not possessors of that then we need to go back and say God wait a minute I got too much fight in me I got too much criticalness in me that I need the peace that passes all understanding when you have the peace that passes all understanding look I can be just I can be just as happy with brother Alister preaching a three-part series that was mindblowing and then brother Gabe just preaches a brother Phineas Day message I am just as happy in that because I am not trying to be anybody else but what God has called me to be you because too many times we try to be something that we think we're supposed to be right we have to have confidence that I am what God has called me to be and rest in that right but you have to be comfortable with being you too many times we're worried about what we're supposed to be for everybody else and we're trying to please everybody else and listen all that is is is is you trying to put you know peacock feathers in a in a just be yourself am God Made You unique and and he made you to be you but you have to rest in that right you have to have confidence in that that I I am not trying to be any and I'm not trying to put on airs any I want to be whatever God God put all this in so that I can make that right kind of a thing and when you realize you're the only one that can make that team that's right no matter how big or little it may be that's the thing that the symphony needs amen and the symphony is not is not complete without that little thing but then we have to rest in that amen you know I I think of uh uh brother Rabbi brother brother Bram called him Rabbi lawon brother B they talk about Rabbi Lawson he said he had a Toral shell glasses and he said all he' do is he'd study all the time and he said he said brother Rabbi he said Rabbi lawon he said he didn't have no big charges but he was faithful with what God had given him and and and he says he says but he had a wife that uh he said he used used to study all the time and and his wife got angry one time and took his Bible and threw it in the fire in in a stove and burnt it up and uh brother brandom said I think uh I think she got caught up in some Christmas tree lights or something and burned up and died and you know what that Prophet says he says touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm see cuz Rabbi Lawson didn't have a great big charge but the whole point was he was faithful to the charge that God given him that's what made the difference and and and the whole I believe the whole point of it is is friends can't everybody be a general and can't everybody be a sergeant but you have to be content on being a foot soldier you have to be content on just somebody that that blocks and keeps keep that keeps keeps the man that's got the ball in his hand and right amen but the thing of it is is is because we're bride we get it misplaced look them foot soldiers is just as much Bride As the general but you have to be confident in what foot soldier God called you to be it it may just be a housewife but praise the Lord be the best housewife that it can be and then when you see your little soldiers go off and they grow up and man and you see the fact that they didn't go out into the world God they ain't all cut up and scarred up you know why cuz you was faithful to the lot that God has given you the the portion that was given you and and and if we would be mindful of that you know because when they came into the promised land God said I'm going to give it to you by lot but when they came to that River Jordan there was there was Ruben Gad and the half tribe of anasse that they was not content with the lot that God was going to Grant to them and you know the Bible says that that they um they came to to to to the River Jordan and they they they told him they said listen if if you can look at that map you you look Reuben and Gad they were supposed to go across to the promised land but but the Bible says that they came to the prophet and they go look this land over here in the plains of Moab is a good is a land that's good for cattle right and what we want to do is we're going to go across Jordan and fight for you we're going to get the land possessed but then we want to come back over here right cuz this is a land that's good for cattle right brother brandham called him borderline they would they would they would C you imagine this they would cross over Jordan taste the good of the land fight for it but then they would cross back over and go no because it was a carnal good you know they instead of taking the unconditional Covenant amen they took the they made a conditional Covenant with the prophet that's right yes I I I was talking to brother Chad last night and and uh brother Chad told me about how to fit he he said he said you know he said Ruben Gad and the half tribe of NASA they were the firstborn and what is the firstborn that's our that's us that's the Flesh and that's that's what we fight against we want conditions that's right right well I'll do this if you do that and you friend we have to be content with the portion that's lotted to us matter of fact the prophet of God said this the the prophet of God said um if I can find it yeah brother Bon says and he got this from his father-in-law when he when he married uh hope uh he says happiness does not consist of how much of the world's Goods you own but how contented you are with the portion that's allotted to you that's right remember that you know contentment is priceless when when you find contentment if you are really content in life not that we get complacent but if we're content in life it's the greatest feeling in the world to where you don't have to be in the rat race of yes sir lady osia sir but you're just at rest and and when we can find that type of Happiness to just be content God has me right where he wants me but if we're looking at our neighbor and we're looking at brother so and so sister so and so we're never going to be at peace you you know you know Phineas when when he was when he was uh fighting against Moab you know that's not the end of the story cuz when Reuben Gad and the half tribe of anasse rose up guess who was in the middle of it Phineas and and and and if you read and I know it's getting late if you read phineas's life uh and we won't hit all of this but but in your in your studies if you look at Phineas it went from Moab to his own family his is the Israelites so his so his battles intensified that's right and it got closer to home so it went from Moab somebody way out yonder balum you know denominational brother Brenham said that was denominational but now the battle is even closer because Reuben Gad and the half tribe look it it's split of tribe half tribe what do you mean half tribe where's that where is that in that's not God's family right but the River Jordan separated them and and and Phineus is Right smack dab in the middle of it because he's the one that has to go to him and go hey hey what's going on here and they're like oh no no no no we'll we'll we we'll go fight for you we we'll we'll we'll fight we'll possess the land and we'll come back and all those different things and and uh and and then and and so he was the one in the middle of it and once they did the agreement that they would fight and then go possess on the other side then Phineas said okay and and and and and and the prophet was in the middle and the prophet of God said it was okay and so they went and fought they were right smack he was right smack dab in the middle of it amen right but let me ask you who would have been better equipped to handle that confrontation in the house of God than Phineas because Phineus had the Covenant of Peace that's what made him fit to to be able to be a mediator and and when we are truly possessors of the peace that passes all understanding that gives us a heart to be able to be in the middle of Confrontation amongst our families whether it be natural or spiritual because it gives us a depth and it gives us a heart I got three people that got a heart come on now right if if if that is not our motive and objective cuz what is it about is it about to kill and steal and divide and conquer no it's about peace it's about rest it's not about to me BRS I I don't believe I don't believe that this is the hour it is the greatest battle ever fought in the mind that's true enough but in the midst of all of it I'm still at rest I I I'm by God's grace I humbly say that he he he's done something for me that I couldn't I couldn't do for myself amise God and and when you when you look and you see the hand of God in your life it it does something for you and it does something to you so when I see somebody that's in in drama or in pain it's not a seat of the scornful cuz I look at that person I go I was there at one point in time I've been there I've done that I've been down that road but but if you don't have a feeling one for the other don't don't let the trials of Life make you bitter that's right and I'm not talking about just to the gray car now I'm talking about you youngsters too because sometimes things can happen to us and if and if you let it it'll make you hard yeah it'll make you bitter it'll make you sour and you may be in your 20s listen life may have took taken terms that you didn't expect but that's when you have to rest that he knew those turns before you made them and that's the whole point of being a Christian well you say brother Gabe I'm not where I want to be well yeah that may be true but God has got you there for a purpose am God had Phineas there for a purpose and you know when you know the the amazing thing of Ruben Gad and the half tribe of anasse [Music] is it's so um overwhelming to me that when they cross you know that the River Jordan open up just like the Red Sea right and those uh hundreds of thousands of people walked across on dry land when it was the wetest season God supernaturally dried up that River bed and and they they they put they God told him take take 12 Stones and put them on the other side Reuben gadam manasse had a stone over on the other side of Jordan with their name on it and when they went back and possessed in the plains and Moab those stones didn't go with them they stayed over there what is what and it and and it's so amazing to me their confession was to be over there but they chose to be over there that's right friends you you we all are at that same spot that we can choose we can choose to be bitter or we can choose to say I am not amen you know uh uh sister Wendy uh gave me gave my wife and I a little a little picture uh in uh Wendy chain and she said uh and it says happiness is a choice it's right on the manle the fireplace love that because it's so true happiness is a choice and if you want to choose to be bitter it is your choice you say you say I've had a hard life well I I have two afterward afterwards we go set out in the vestib and we can compare and see who's the [Music] worst I guarantee I'm going to be a top five but but am I going to Relish in that no I'm choosing happiness I'm choosing to break the Cycles it's my choice God gave it to me God gave me this open book you you think about this when when when when the children of Israel when they when they got when when they they had they had a stone with their name on it that they were going to go into their in inheritance and they chose to go back you know they even had a stone placed in the in the River Jordan for a memorial right and it and and here's here's the beautiful thing it wasn't Ruben and manasse and all of them that put the stone in the River Jordan it was Joshua who is Joshua thank you yes so it was it wasn't just them doing this it was God doing it for a memorial that it wasn't just you it was me amen and and and and and when they got that they had a stone oh my god look they received a new stone that's right amen and what did God promise US he said I'll give you a new stone am with a name written on it that no man knows saying him that receiveth it and I'll give to you of the Hidden Mana is when we come to that that is our inheritance that is our adoption when we are placed in the land and and when we receive that look we what did Brother Brenham tell brother Benham told us he said he said he said uh uh he says you remember it was the pyramid where the mysterious White Rock was written on and the angels took me into that pyramid of themselves the mysteries of God known only to them that Prophet took that Pride bar and RI the lid off of that yes sir and what did he reveal my name your name he gave you a new name what that you are not the the the product of your mom and dad but you are the bride the mystical bride of Jesus Christ that's what it's all about amen he gives us a new name he changes us and he says I'll give of you the hidden manner what what is the hidden manner what is the hidden Manor that's where the bedroom is it wasn't the Mana that fell every day when when they went on the other side the Mana ceased but the hidden Mana continued on and every high priest right every priest had a right to take a handful of that hidden Mana that's right and it would supernaturally grow back afterwards and the Bible says sister that ye are a priest and you have just as much right to the hidden manner as brother Emmanuel brother Chad brother Ben brother you have just as much right sir because you are living the life of righteousness amen that's what get when what what what does brother brandham tell us when when they see that new name look they went up in they brother Bram said he went up in that pyramid and brother brandom says it it was the it was those angels had the the interpretation of that white stone that was the pyramid right those angels gave him the what was inside of that pyramid right yes sir it was once hidden but then it was revealed right what are we eating upon amen right and and and because brother benam tells us this you say well how do I know I I I I have a new name or how do I know my name's on the book brother benam tells us the reason why you know he says is it true that every Jew born since Christ that come into the world is to be saved he says no nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jew or Gentile see that's all the book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but the mystery of the book while it's calling those names you find you understand that now see the book does not say now Lil is to be saved in this time of the church age or Orman whoever it don't say Susan Smith or uh John Brooks right right no it says it says no he says it don't say that it just shows the mystery praise God Amen right unfolds the mystery of what the thing is but Emmanuel saasu John SM right put your name in there yeah don't you stop at Isaiah 53 put your name in there but we ourselves by faith believe it how do I know how how do you know it says I I'll give you to eat of the the the the hidden mana and I'll give you a white stone yes sir but but if if you take that uh Stone and and you go back to the original Hebrew it goes back to the uh ancient days of the law that when somebody was in a trial if they were condemned they would get a Blackstone if they were if they were uh uh uh uh found not guilty they were given a white stone so so when we receive this message and we are we are I'm not talking about here friends I'm talking about when it becomes real to you that that nobody sh I don't care what negative things say about brother Brown they say what they want to brother I I've done went too far I don't care I'm not look I am not looking for a perfect Prophet cuz I've already found one look I'm not looking for a perfect Pastor cuz I found one right you understand what I'm saying we're dealing with we are all human beings can brother Brandon be a human being yes sir let me ask you something you the majority of your life in another world and then come back here and see how good your memory [Music] is people sit in the seated the scornful you brother benam talked about how he said when he was on on the platform it was a minor to what he did when he was out on that's why he had to go out in in the woods in the mountains where there was no souls so nobody would pull on that gift because it was so sensitive he would go into another world and and then remember he would say he'd say you don't know how it is he said he'd look is this a vision is this a v yeah amen he he would walk through life and remember when that brother had the eye problem and he's like brother brandom uh uh you see Vision he's like yeah brother but you know I I try to get a away out here not to get away from those he's like oh I'm sorry and then boom it was that easy yeah yeah now you have that kind of a gift in your life now let I want you to recall what happened 20 years ago yeah right and I want to verbatim yeah and then I want you to go around the world preaching to thousands of people and don't you tell that story wrong yeah right I want you to say it the same way oh no no you don't have no iPad no you got a notebook but don't you make a mistake yeah amen prise God you say you say oh in the in the critics that say oh you just trying to protect him I don't need to protect brother B thank you brother matter of fact he's protecting me that's why God sent him to me that's what the protection of this message is look you but I don't know about you brother but when that sister stood up for that Prophet God that angel of the Lord came through the uh neighborhood and brought healing that's right I want to be that I want to be that kind of person that I stand for this gospel and then the angel comes down and sweeps through and brings healing in my home I tell you what if we stood up and we defended not to fight not to be critical but to stand for [Applause] truth I'm sorry I don't mean toess Lord I I just to me look I love this I all I can tell tell you is I know what I was I know what I was and I know how many times I pushed this message away and I know that I couldn't push it away it wouldn't leave me so so I all I can tell you is is how real it is to me and and and and I don't have well I know you can be dumb and not and be intellectual but I I I I I don't know I don't think I'm intellectual how about that but but but but but the thing of it is friends when when when you see the gospel unfold to you in a way I don't know brother Chad when I was was talking about there it's like everywhere you look it's it's the message I mean everywhere I mean it is just look brother brandham gave us the principles of the Gospel and it applies in every story every every every law every every precept I mean it's everywhere and it's not something that you got to try like remember when you was little and you'd have to take the B the little the little Cube and try to put it in and it ain't like you trying to have a circle and you trying to push that square in there no it's a it's a circle and It just fits right in there and you're just like my look at that and you pick up a star and whoa right you don't have to try it it does it itself but I but I but I think if we would stop trying to defend all I want to do is rest you and I you you you and sometime I got to figure out a way to stick to about 30 slides you pray for me pick the right 30 but but here's the thing here here's some I want I want to just I want to I want to show show this cuz there there's a there's a second there's a third battle that um there's a third battle that Phineas goes through and um and it's in judges um and and it's an easy search you just take Finas and running through the scriptures it'll it'll so bless you it blessed me it was so beautiful to me but not going into the background but there's another fight amongst the the children of Israel and there was a there was some whoredoms committed and a with a concubine and they cut up in 12 pieces and sent it to the 12 tribes and Benjamin was in the middle of it and and so Phineas this is the third time he's spoken of in the scriptures and and now it's even closer to home cuz it's just one part of the [Music] church and and he goes up against Benjamin and and they and they there's several that die and and he has to recalculate and and he's like whoa whoa what's going on and and so they come to to judges 20:27 and the children of Israel inquired of the Lord for the Ark of the Covenant of God was there in those days and Phineas the son of el elazar the son of Aaron stood before it in those days saying shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin yeah now I don't know about you but when I read that I see the heartache of a veteran because this is the third battle that he's in the midst of in the scripture third time he's spoken of and when he's he he he's seen loss on both sides he's seen right and wrong and then there's still confusion in the camp and he goes Lord he doesn't he doesn't approach Benjamin as somebody that don't have no no connection to him yeah right amen but when he goes before the Ark of he's not bless God I'm the high priest and I'm the anointed man of the hour and I got to hear thumbed them and yeah no but he says but he says Lord my brother Benjamin Benjamin my brother and I think we can learn a lot from Phineas because all of us are on a battlefield of some sort that's right but it's not just being in the fight but it's how are we fighting the fight God called us to fight the good fight of faith and in order to do that that that takes communion with the almighty amen and you say brother Gabe you know but but God just I'm praying and I'm not getting and and I'm struggling I don't know the answers well listen do you know I I love this you know brother bam said the almighty means that shadaa right the breasted one amen it's another easy search but if you type in that word a shi it comes up like 60 some odd times in the Old Testament but out of those 60 times do you know who says it overwhelmingly calls God elshad is job job's like 26 times out of the 60 and nobody even comes close uh as far as not even double digits like three four times so what does that tell us when God seemed the farthest away yeah he called him M Shad out the most it was when it's the darkest he said you're my strength Giver see he he wasn't referring to him as you know Elohim way out yonder and all no no no no no when he needed him the most he called him the the name that would put him the closest to him right that's right wooo and it takes Faith to do that that when everything fell apart in job's life see because God he he uses his his name he's not just God object of worship and and he's not just Elohim self-existent one and he's not just Savior and he's not just Master but no but he's also the friend amen he's the friend that sticks as closer than a brother amen but he also reever reveals himself as a shadat the breasted one right when when that baby is the most vulnerable oh some one of you one you tough Brothers say Amen put a little gravel in it too amen yeah you got to be able to draw up to him brother you the protector you the provider don't forget El Shadi don't forget to refer to him as a Shadi because no matter how tough we can be remember God may break you down to your knees he may get you in that vulnerable spot because he wants you to call him El sh right right just like job he did everything right but but he wanted to justify himself just like we do sometimes and and I just to me brotherr and I I just I hope that when you're out on the battlefield today tomorrow that you fight a little differently you young people when you're at school and with your classmates or you know your worldly family members or whatever it may be you you look you you Brothers you sisters that that never set foot in a ballroom well the next time you see somebody all tatted up and sleeved out why don't you look at them a little bit differently cuz if it wasn't for the grace of God that would be you unless you think there something you did to keep yourself clean no and we all had to come our way for a purpose that's true enough but also you've got a lot in life that you got to live and you got to look at yourself and go wait a minute I'm fighting wrong if I am a possessor of the Covenant of Peace then I need to I need to take some of phineas's points am if I if I do have that white stone if I am partaking of the Hidden Mana why am I worried about brother so and so on the internet sir right true maybe we ought to be just content with what God has given us contentment is priceless but if we're looking at everybody else you know we we live in an hour where everything's connected and as as a musicians the musicians if you would come please brother Chad um you know we live in an hour where everything is just so um we're so connected but we're so connected we're disconnected right and and and we're we've got so many things going on on us right and we have so many um channels open whether it be uh family and work and then we got social media and you know we by the time you trying to keep up with the man all I had was Facebook and I I got to the place where it's like I ain't got time I mean I don't know how y'all do Instagram and gramming I I ain't never had time to do no gramming how you gram you got time to gram man see we we got all these different and and what what all they do they all say the same thing why would you have to sign up with Facebook Instagram Snapchat y'all act like oh I don't know brother G I don't know any other social media you're all like quietly on the inside you're like this what this this but you know you know what I had to do I had to delete that thing am cuz I realized it was taking up too much of my time that's right it you get so connected to that other world like brother aliser preached you get so connected brother you play something soft you get so connected to this to the to that other the world that we lose connection with each [Music] other we don't have time to put our shoulders together in the presence of [Music] God cuz we're too busy graming we're too worried about this church over here and that church over there and the seeing how popular we are how many followers we God and we be you you know you know we we live in a brother Bon said we live in a neurotic age what would he say now brother I don't know about you I don't want no followers I didn't like that I'm thinking oo don't follow me I mean man like Facebook I think oh I got followers [Laughter] can't we call it something else but what does that do unconsciously I hit a thousand and then these young people grow up when they only got [Music] 10 now we laugh and Chuckles old but you young people you're like yeah and then we base how popular we are on how many followers we have and then our life becomes a mirage because the more crazy the more Antics we do the more funny whatever the more followers we get and then we're not trying to be ourselves we're trying to be something that's going to draw followers and we're so busy trying to bring followers to us that I wonder do we forget to follow [Music] him how many followers does Jesus have on his Facebook account is it m and Taylor Swift who has more I'm talking about genuine [Music] followers we can get so caught up you know you know there's you know there's a a a terminology now called a micro celebrity you know what a micro celebrity is a micro celebrity is somebody that's a celebrity but only in a selected little group so say say you're in the Motocross and you uh you you're a real good motorcycle and you do Motocross Crossing Motors whatever that is right so you can cross in Motors good well you you're the best Crossing of Motors there is and so you are going to be a micro celebrity in that Motocross world and everybody that's in the Motocross is going to know your name because you're the best and so Satan has so designed it where he don't even have to have Hollywood anymore he he has our phones that we have attached to us and and you say brother gab I'm not in the Motocross but what about our little niche yes [Music] sir and then we and I and then we can become popular you know you know you know you know brother B talks about Ministry preachers he always says there's three things right money women and that's the one never nobody ever talks about right money in women is easy to catch right but it's that old popularity and now in this Dynamic that we live in where it's it's all about uh being known and but but I thought the way up was down right amen I thought it was about how little we can get so that Christ could be projected in us I thought it was about us dying out to self so that when they saw you they saw Jesus not your [Music] family brother G I can't suck the double 10 in [Music] oh come on now y'all know what I'm talking about making the fishy face oh my goodness what in the world we got messy Believers making fishy faces for brother that ain't like that s hello Dr Brum he said get that hand down here and shake that hand right he said I ain't no doctor if you love me call me brother and if we're supposed to be on this battlefield called of of of lady oia I I don't know about you I I I want to die I want to die I don't want brother Gabe to be seen I'm trying so bad to kill that man I want him dead right and and that when when my brothers when my co-workers whoever comes in in contact with me I want them to see the Lord Jesus to say this there's something different about [Music] him not not how much he knows and how you can W you in the scriptures no but when when they when they come across that Prophet there was something different about him when he when when he came back and to Jefferson Villa after he preached himself seals no doubt them people was like wow what's next you imagine they' be on the edge of the seats and then what does he do he preaches his complex standing in the [Music] Gap look when when you when you think about brother brandham and his life that he lived you know we see the first second in third pool right brother Braham talked about this picture and and he you we always just want to see the three pools and the clouds and right but brother Chad said something a month or two ago brother brother Chad said brother brother Chad said that uh um he said when God put that mountain range there was highs and lows baked into them Hills amen [Music] see God knew every Valley right every flat spot brother Brown said when he looked at that he goes yeah he goes look into that the first and pool and he goes remember that flat spot he goes That's when uh I went off the field so that is his life played out in that mountain range God knew every Valley you would go through he knew every Flatline you would do he knew every Mountaintop you would be on every High spot spot every low spot every every doubt question fluster whatever it may be but once that prophet got to that third pool this is so beautiful to me after it came to the opening of the word what [Music] happened brother brandom decreased and the word increased that that mountain range doesn't keep going up but it goes down and if we really want to see the third pool do something for us what art our mountain range ought to look like people are looking for shouting and Supernaturals and all these things when you look at the manifestations of the third pool show me where it was some big show amen that's right it was a prophet of God sitting in a in a poor lady's house and she said the right words heard and and he said you say whatever you want it'll be given to you she didn't she didn't start thinking about 2024 rollsroyce and mansions on the hill but she said the right thing again and she said the salvation of my two boys you look at all those those manifestations of that three pool it was always just a handful of people it wasn't in in random Tabernacle where those things was unfolding it wasn't when he was was in Los Angeles and down in Louisiana but what it was it was it was uh it was it was uh when sister me's on the table and he's not even in the room that's right amen yes sir all those things was not for public that's right display right it was the hidden life that's right friends you got people looking for something great out and and brother B says I wonder if the people are not sufficiently impressed with the word of God I wonder if we've lost our not I'm saying you understand what I'm saying people are looking for is that Elder is is that yes is it not enough I know it's enough for me I know what it's done for me I know what I was and I know what I am now and I know the reality of Jesus Christ and I see the resurrection in my [Music] life Hallelujah when we talk about the third pool what are we looking for look it God gave us a [Music] visual brother Braham said it goes off into the Continental Divide and off into eternity but but where is it going yeah but it has to be because the Bible says the way up is down right we say brother Gabe you talking about the Frozen chosen and it's SC no I believe in the Supernatural but I believe every day that we walk in this Christian walk and we're walking a rugged everyday life to me that's the supernatural that I have eyes to see and I can see Satan all of his tactics and that word comes forth in my life and there's a little buzzer that goes off and it says you need to repent you shouldn't have said it like that you wrong and I said yes Lord I'm so sorry and I go make that thing [Music] right I just love that mountain range yeah the Bible says brother Chad Isaiah 57:15 for thus sayith the high and lofty one that haveth eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place with him that is of a contrite and humble Spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones he is the high and holy one but what does he inhabit it's somebody that's crushed it's somebody that has the heartache of a veteran that's been on the battlefield and is not trying to prove that their bride they just letting their life shine they just live in a calm and everyday life I love the Lord Jesus he's done so much for me and I and I'm hoping I can do something for one of his [Music] children I'm hoping if I can just do if Lord if I could help one of those foolish virgin let let me do it I don't I don't have to look for bride to help I just want to help [Music] somebody I know when you had have the joy of God in your heart you just want to you want to give [Music] it friends if if you don't have that and and the coldness of Lady OA has crept in the love of material things and selflove then look go find an altar and don't get up until that warmthness of the Holy Ghost comes back don't worry about [Music] lunch don't worry about nothing but that God I've got this something on the inside and I know it's not you you got to be honest with yourself is it easy no is it worth it it's worth [Music] everything when those Waters got troubl that was a time for you to step in and receive your [Music] healing brother sister don't miss your OPP [Music] opportunity don't shut down but say God I look there's too many Souls here this morning kneel at your seat raise a hand come to the altar whatever you got to do but let today be the changing spot if you've been fighting the battle wrong repent and say God I want to fight the right way I've been too critical I've been too hard I'm my job's gotten away my whatever uh all of us can raise our hands and say too much of of this world has crept in I'm let I'm letting my time get taken away with foolish things but I want to set my heart on Eternal things I'll raise both hands but we got to be honest with ourselves I don't want to look back 20 years ago and say Bo those were the days but I want to look to today and say today is the day amen today is the greatest day to be a Christian not yesterday not 50 years ago 20 years ago but today cuz we don't have 50 years ago all we have is right now could you stand with me we bow our heads [Music] precious Lord the quietness of this moment just a simple broken thought but Lord I I know you're in it and Lord could we each [Music] one be mindful [Music] of the Frailty of our minds the Frailty of our beings Lord could you make yourself more real to us today Lord that we could see that seventh Peak that third high place become real in our lives and as that profit decreased the man that you could increase God make that reality real again in us help us each one Lord you see the desires the needs of our heart the battlefield that each one of us is [Music] on I pray that your great Holy Spirit would walk the aisles [Music] and pick up the ones that's injured on the field Lord make yourself real to him as else should I [Music] might we be able to call you that today Lord You Are The [Music] Almighty Lord when you think [Music] of your opinion your belief your thought on a devil you cast them out with your own finger that's what you think about them but when it comes to one of your lost sheep you lay us on your shoulders Lord help us to surrender as you place us on your shoulders and might we realize lord it's not the demons not the Devils is the problem but it's us might we each one surrender Lord be yielded vessels Lord help us Lord to say only that which is your word and forgive us of the missteps of Life Lord help us to make the wrongs right and to have confidence and your leadership and your guidance and Lord the wrongs that need made right might you bring those paths that would cross that we could find Opportunities [Music] Lord the shoulders that we didn't bring to you of our brothers and sisters and misunderstandings Lord might we reconsecrate aresh and pull those broken friendships relationships whatever it may be Lord strains in the family in the home might we find our prayer closets and bring them before you and let you do the talking Lord that we'd come back with a heart of compassion we come back different Lord make us help us to find Time Lord to make time you know the needs of the people Lord we commit them into your hands and we ask these things to be so in the precious name the unfailing name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ [Music] amen amen God bless you [Music] J he was wounded for our [Music] transgressions and he was bruised for our ini and surely he bore our sorrow and by his stripes we are heal oh he was one for our [Music] transgression and he was bruised for our [Music] inity and surely he bore my song and by his stripes we are healed amen how many of you know that you need elhadi you need the strength to be the right kind of a soldier we need his character we need his life that means we got to die to ourselves and I so appreciate how God deals with the heart of a brother in this place brother Gabe so that he can come and deal with our hearts amen amen God has blessed our brother with a special gift and ability to get down to the heart and deal with our hearts and really Minister where we need it most and so I don't want that Ministry to go in vain but I want to open myself and say God that's what I need I need I I need that Covenant of peace to come and bring peace inside so that that when you ask me to go back and fight the good fight of faith I do it with the right approach with the right attitude with the right love in my heart amen amen I want the confirmation of what F FAS had so that I can go fight when called upon the way he would fight amen amen it so touched me I I realized I need more from elhadi I need a strength Beyond human strength cuz my human strength is failing me but I need the strength from almighty God to give me the the ability amen God bless you all it's good to be here God moved through the anointing in our brother amen let it take effect in our lives through him he invited you to pray to pray in your seat to pray where you're standing to pray at the altar but don't leave you find yourself in need of this don't leave too quick I believe when God anoints a man to go a direction it's for us for us in this room we don't want to we don't want to just move to the next day next thing for our day the next action we take the next agenda on the program but let's absorb what God has given us if you find yourself in need of prayer just pray take a few minutes and say God I needed that now bring it to manifestation in my life man just want to say God bless you we love you all and pray that God will be with each one of you and touch you in special way pray that we can see you tomorrow in the fellowship if you could just remember my mother sister Debbie and your prayers and our family this coming week we appreciate your prayers and let's just bow our heads together and thank God for the word Lord Jesus we're so thankful God that you've been so faithful to bring us your word and according to your design plan and pattern that you would anoint part of your ministry you used our brother gab and we're so thankful Lord for his willingness God we pray that you would restore strength that you would would bless him especially on this day that he celebrates his birthday may you pour back into him abundantly Lord and bless him abundantly and God the word that you brought through that vessel Lord may it change our lives God as you're molding us into your Image Day by Day Lord there's things we have to experience Lord both on the positive and the negative side so that we can recognize the truth of what our brother preached so that we can recognize the full impact of your word in your life and that we could cry out for more God I pray that you'd bless each one of us Lord with a greater portion of yourself may we draw up close to you and nurse from you the strength that we need to be the finus in this last day to be the one that will raise up that won't take the hybridization of Blended religion that won't stand by and allow sin but God that we come into a covenant of Peace that'll change our attitude that we don't go out like the previous gener generation with a fighting Spirit or a fighting attitude but we go when called upon we speak when you call upon us to speak but we do it with compassion with love with the recognition of who our brothers are God may we fight differently than humans fight May we fight this good fight of Faith as your representation on this Earth as instruments in your hand as tools that you use to stand for the truth may we do so with compassion and love and wisdom and understanding because you have opened the book you have given us the revelation of the Whit Stone we know who we are and we know we're part of that Covenant of Peace may it change every part of our life and the way we handle every situation God May the things that you brought through our brother may it become a living reality in each one of us every day for God we don't live in a fairy tale and we don't expect that everything's going to be perfect but we know what your Prophet told us that there are difficulties there are trials there are difficulties especially at the very last moment for the bride on this Earth but God you're equipping us now for that hour thank you Father help us to yield and to surrender to what you're teaching us Lord we love you help us God help us to be true true to the calling true to the commission and true to your nature we love you God and we ask you'd bless each one as we go Lord those that remain and pray Lord may you feed us on your strength may you change Us by your word may we go forth differently bless us Lord as we surrender Our Lives to you may you use us in a greater way as we leave this service and go back to our post of Duty go back to our lives and to the work and to the things you've called us to may we do so with a little clearer vision and more strength from you we love you God we ask your blessings in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you all we hope
