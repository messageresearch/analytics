[17:54] thank you musicians
[17:55] [Music]
[17:57] amen while we're standing let's turn to
[17:59] the the book of revelation
[18:01] [Music]
[18:02] and we'll begin revelation chapter 2.
[18:13] revelation chapter 2
[18:16] i'm going to read verse 7. this is the
[18:17] message to the ephesian church age
[18:20] and we're going to read
[18:21] verse 7. he that hath an ear let him
[18:25] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[18:26] churches to him that overcometh will i
[18:29] give to eat of the tree of life which is
[18:31] in the midst of the paradise of god
[18:34] you can have your seats
[18:36] amen
[18:39] now we see the promise to the at the end
[18:41] of the ephesians
[18:43] message to the ephesian age verse 7
[18:45] gives us
[18:46] the first promise and a series of
[18:48] promises
[18:50] and it says
[18:51] uh he that hath an ear let him hear with
[18:53] the spirit saith unto the churches to
[18:55] him that overcometh so there's a promise
[18:58] laying here but the promise is only for
[19:00] a certain individual and it's only for
[19:03] he that overcometh amen this promise is
[19:05] not for everybody this promise is for
[19:07] the overcomer
[19:09] he says to him that overcometh will i
[19:11] give to eat of the tree of life which is
[19:13] in the midst of the paradise of god and
[19:15] i say what a promise that is amen to eat
[19:19] of the tree of life means you're a
[19:20] partaker of eternal life
[19:23] but that's only for the overcomer praise
[19:26] god
[19:27] now brother graham says in the message
[19:28] how can i overcome
[19:30] he says watch what the overcomer is
[19:32] promised see
[19:33] now now laodicea that's the last church
[19:36] age there's going to be some overcomers
[19:38] in there watch there they now remember
[19:40] each
[19:41] each church age the one preceding it
[19:43] inherits all that the other ones offered
[19:47] so don't leave this in ephesus
[19:50] because these promises are accumulative
[19:54] so that's what he says each church age
[19:56] the one preceding it inherits all that
[19:58] the other ones offered watch up here now
[20:00] it's after they done received all these
[20:02] powers these names and everything
[20:04] written that he promised and eat the
[20:05] hidden man and all down through watching
[20:08] this last church age to him that
[20:10] overcometh i will grant to sit with me
[20:12] in my throne
[20:13] so though these promises now we're in
[20:16] the laodicean church age and
[20:18] these promises are made available all of
[20:21] the promises all the way down through
[20:22] are made available to us if we're
[20:25] overcomers amen so i want to i want to
[20:27] minister this morning on
[20:29] how to overcome
[20:32] if these promises are for overcomers
[20:34] then i'd like to be an overcomer
[20:36] because if i'm an overcomer i can eat of
[20:38] the tree of life and i can have all
[20:39] these i can be a partaker of all these
[20:41] promises through the church ages so i
[20:44] want to overcome so the question is how
[20:46] to overcome how how to overcome
[20:50] let's let's keep reading these promises
[20:52] as we go down through let's look at the
[20:53] smyrna church age in chapter 2 verse 11.
[20:58] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[20:59] the spirit saith unto the churches he
[21:01] that overcometh shall not be hurt of the
[21:04] second death
[21:06] praise god verse 17
[21:08] in the pergamus church age he that hath
[21:10] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[21:12] saith unto the churches to him that
[21:14] overcometh if you're going to find
[21:16] there's a consistent theme here let him
[21:19] that hath an ear to hear what the spirit
[21:21] saith
[21:23] so you have to be the type of person
[21:25] that has a special ear
[21:28] and not everybody has this ear
[21:31] most all human beings unless they have
[21:33] some deformity or birth defect have ears
[21:35] but this isn't the ears he's talking
[21:37] about this is a special ear to hear what
[21:40] the spirit says
[21:42] so to be an overcomer and to have this
[21:44] promise you have to be able to hear amen
[21:48] you have to have an ear to hear what the
[21:50] spirit is saying
[21:52] and then to him that overcometh amen
[21:56] will i give to eat of the hidden manna
[21:57] and i will give him a white stone and
[21:59] then the stone a new name written which
[22:01] no man knoweth save he that receiveth it
[22:04] now the thyatira church age
[22:07] verse 26
[22:09] and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[22:11] works unto the end to him will i give
[22:14] power over the nations and he shall rule
[22:17] he shall rule them with a rod of iron as
[22:19] the vessels of a potter shall they be
[22:21] broken to shivers even as i receive them
[22:23] my father and i will give him the
[22:26] morning star he that hath an ear let him
[22:29] hear with the spirit saith unto the
[22:31] churches
[22:32] sardis church age verse chapter 3 verse
[22:35] 5
[22:36] he that overcometh the same shall be
[22:38] clothed in white raiment and i will not
[22:40] blot out his name out of the book of
[22:42] life but i will confess his name before
[22:44] my father and before his angels he that
[22:47] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[22:50] saith unto the churches
[22:52] philadelphia church age
[22:55] verse 12
[22:58] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[23:00] in the temple of my god and he shall go
[23:02] no more out and i will write upon him
[23:04] the name of my god in the name of the
[23:06] city of my god which is new jerusalem
[23:09] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[23:11] god and i will write upon him my new
[23:13] name
[23:14] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[23:16] the spirit saith into the churches
[23:19] and now the laodicean church age in
[23:21] verse 21
[23:24] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[23:26] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[23:29] overcame in him sit down with my father
[23:32] in his throne
[23:33] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[23:35] the spirit saith unto the churches
[23:39] i don't know about you but i want all of
[23:41] those
[23:42] i want the white robe i want the white
[23:44] stone with a new name i want written on
[23:46] me the name of
[23:48] of god i want written on me the name of
[23:50] new jerusalem and i want revealed to me
[23:52] jesus new name
[23:53] i want to eat of the tree of life i want
[23:56] i want a white robe i want all of the
[23:59] things that are promised i want them all
[24:01] and they're all available if i have an
[24:03] ear to hear what the spirit saith and i
[24:06] am an overcomer
[24:08] so we must be overcomers that inherit
[24:11] this we have to have an ear to hear
[24:14] that's predestination amen and we have
[24:16] to be an overcomer amen that's also
[24:19] predestinated
[24:21] praise god
[24:23] amen i tell you there's such uh there's
[24:26] such a power in the revelation of
[24:28] predestination how do i know i will
[24:31] overcome i've been predestinated to
[24:32] overcome amen but it's still god is in
[24:35] partnership with man it still requires
[24:37] us in a surrendered way amen to
[24:40] surrender to god's program for the
[24:42] overcoming to come into manifestation
[24:44] i'm already ordained to overcome amen
[24:46] god's already knows the the end from the
[24:48] beginning he knows what the finish will
[24:50] be amen but i've got to get with his
[24:53] program and surrender and yield to his
[24:55] program to see the manifestation of the
[24:57] overcoming
[25:00] so if you've got an ear to hear what the
[25:01] spirit say to the churches you should be
[25:03] rejoicing amen praise god that i can
[25:06] actually hear i i'm in a generation amen
[25:09] where these this word has been this book
[25:11] has been open this word has been
[25:12] revealed and i hear it and i believe it
[25:15] and
[25:16] and it makes sense to me and i love it
[25:18] and i want it when millions don't i do
[25:21] god has given me an ear to hear what the
[25:23] spirit says
[25:25] and now i want to be that overcomer that
[25:28] inherits the
[25:30] cumulative prize
[25:32] of all the church ages
[25:35] he says now we in the in the laodicean
[25:38] he says he that overcometh will i grant
[25:40] to sit with me in my throne even as i
[25:42] also come and sit down with my father in
[25:45] his throne brother branham in the church
[25:47] age book he says see it's not on throne
[25:50] it's end throne
[25:52] in my throne in my father's throne not
[25:55] on a throne he said this is not a seat
[26:00] this is a position of power in the
[26:02] kingdom the throne is the entire realm
[26:05] of the kingdom amen it's the inheritance
[26:08] it's it's the rule jurisdiction it's
[26:11] it's the full territory of god in jesus
[26:14] christ amen and he says when i if you
[26:17] overcome in this last age amen and the
[26:20] laodicean church age if you have a ear
[26:22] to hear what the spirit says in this age
[26:24] and you that overcometh in this age i
[26:27] will give you to sit
[26:29] with me in my throne amen that means
[26:32] you'll sit in the kingdom and the power
[26:35] of position and authority with him in
[26:38] the kingdom of god
[26:40] praise be to god amen it's more than a
[26:43] seat
[26:44] it's the whole realm of christ
[26:49] amen
[26:50] in the church age book and the laodicean
[26:52] church age
[26:53] brother ben says
[26:55] now what are we to overcome he just read
[26:58] this
[26:59] the scripture that we read in revelation
[27:01] 3 21 he says now what are we to overcome
[27:04] that's wonderful i've looked at this so
[27:06] many times in in in our age and leo to
[27:09] see what is it that we're to overcome
[27:12] but listen to how brother ben puts a
[27:14] twist on this
[27:15] now what are we to overcome
[27:17] that is the normal question to ask here
[27:21] right
[27:22] if you're an overcomer you can get this
[27:23] prize what do i overcome where's the
[27:26] dragon i must slay where's the hill i
[27:28] must climb where's the race i must win
[27:30] and brother branham says this is the
[27:32] normal question to ask here but that is
[27:35] not the actual thought of this verse for
[27:38] it is not so much what we are to
[27:40] overcome but how we are to overcome
[27:44] now this is logical for does it doesn't
[27:46] matter much what we are to overcome as
[27:49] long as we know how we can overcome
[27:53] amen you can say what do we overcome in
[27:56] this last stage we can list a whole list
[27:58] of things we overcome unbelief we
[28:00] we overcome deception we overcome you we
[28:03] can make a whole list of what do we
[28:04] overcome in the laodicean church age
[28:06] brother man said that's not really the
[28:08] important part that's not the emphasis
[28:10] of the scripture amen because it doesn't
[28:12] matter what you need to overcome the
[28:15] method is always the same if you know
[28:17] how to overcome you will overcome every
[28:21] obstacle so the question that needs
[28:23] answered is how to overcome not what to
[28:26] overcome
[28:27] [Music]
[28:29] don't worry the world will supply the
[28:31] what
[28:34] we need god to give us the how.
[28:38] and when we have the how no matter what
[28:40] the enemy throws as the what we can
[28:42] overcome the what with the how.
[28:47] so i don't i don't care so much about
[28:49] the name of the what what to overcome
[28:51] name it anything you want to name it but
[28:53] if god will reveal to me how to overcome
[28:56] amen then it doesn't matter what i'm
[28:58] overcoming the same method will always
[29:00] overcome and conquer
[29:04] it goes
[29:05] it goes on to say in the same quote a
[29:07] quick look at those scriptures which
[29:08] involve the lord jesus overcoming will
[29:10] bring out the truth of this proposition
[29:13] in matthew 4 where jesus is tempted of
[29:15] the devil he overcame the personal
[29:17] temptation of satan by the word and by
[29:20] the word only
[29:21] in each of the three major trials that
[29:23] corresponded exactly through the
[29:25] temptation of the garden of eden the
[29:27] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[29:29] and the pride of life jesus overcame by
[29:31] the word he fell to the personal
[29:34] temptation of satan by failing to use
[29:36] the word
[29:37] catch that
[29:39] eve failed
[29:41] she fell in her personal temptation
[29:45] by failing to use the word
[29:48] adam fell in direct disobedience to the
[29:50] word
[29:52] but jesus overcame by the word and right
[29:55] now let me say that this is the only way
[29:58] to be an overcomer also it is the only
[30:01] way that you can know if you are
[30:03] overcoming because the word can't fail
[30:08] oh i love this last sentence we're going
[30:10] to spend a minute on this amen
[30:15] the only way to be an overcomer is by
[30:17] the word
[30:19] but it's also the only way that you can
[30:21] know that you're overcoming because the
[30:23] word can't fail
[30:25] so you can't tell whether you're
[30:27] overcoming or not by how well you're
[30:30] performing or behaving
[30:33] amen
[30:35] because we go through cycles in life
[30:37] amen things cycle and and we have our
[30:39] ups and our downs amen and we cannot
[30:42] always gauge whether or not we're
[30:44] overcoming by what's happening in our
[30:47] lives amen the only way we can know
[30:49] we're overcoming is if we're standing
[30:52] solely upon the word and we're standing
[30:54] solely upon the word it doesn't matter
[30:56] what turmoil we're in in the middle of
[30:58] our lives we are overcoming
[31:02] because the word can't fail you say i'm
[31:04] applying the word but everything's going
[31:06] wrong you're overcoming hold steady
[31:08] you're overcoming right now by saying i
[31:10] believe the word regardless of symptoms
[31:12] regardless of circumstances this is the
[31:15] word and it's the only thing for me amen
[31:17] you're overcoming right now today and
[31:20] you can be going through the worst
[31:22] situation of your life but you are
[31:24] currently overcoming
[31:26] and that is the only way to know that
[31:28] you're overcoming
[31:30] because you can't you know wake up in
[31:32] the morning and feel pretty good and
[31:33] there's no symptoms no troubles i got a
[31:35] job there's money in the bank
[31:36] everything's fine i'm overcoming that's
[31:38] no sign you're overcoming
[31:42] and so whether we're in a trial or not
[31:44] in a trial there's no sign whether we're
[31:46] overcoming the only way to know for
[31:48] overcoming is by staying with the word
[31:50] and the word only
[31:53] this is becoming such a critical message
[31:55] amen i can't get beyond preaching on
[31:57] these things amen because you know i
[32:00] don't know why it's just the way god's
[32:02] leading me but as i meditate on this
[32:04] there's so many things that we try to do
[32:07] and try to produce and we try to be
[32:08] stronger and we try to do better and we
[32:11] always try to guard ourselves and
[32:12] protect ourselves and reform ourselves
[32:14] and all of this stuff and we end up
[32:16] continually in a cycle of failure and uh
[32:20] disappointing ourselves and we've got to
[32:22] get our eyes off of ourselves and start
[32:25] focusing on the word that is god god has
[32:27] given us and stick with that word and
[32:29] overcome by the word and stop injecting
[32:32] self into the picture because that's the
[32:34] miserable failure to begin with
[32:37] so i cannot lean on self rely on self
[32:39] depend on self i've got to get self out
[32:42] of the picture and say regardless of
[32:43] myself this word is true
[32:46] amen and i'm standing with this word all
[32:49] the way to the finish line regardless of
[32:51] what happens
[32:53] that's the only way to know if you're
[32:56] overcoming
[32:57] because the word can't fail
[32:59] when i read that something lit up inside
[33:02] of me
[33:03] and said that's the deception of the age
[33:06] to get us to base
[33:08] our experiences with the lord off of
[33:11] emotions because emotions are so fickle
[33:14] i'm an overcomer today i'm a failure
[33:16] tomorrow
[33:18] i'm a failure today i might be an
[33:20] overcomer tomorrow if i'm an overcomer
[33:22] tomorrow i may only be an overcomer for
[33:23] an hour tomorrow
[33:26] then i'm not an overcomer anymore but
[33:28] this promises to the overcomer it's not
[33:30] something to play with i have to know
[33:32] how to be an overcomer because i believe
[33:35] these promises are for me and i want all
[33:37] of the promises i want to apprehend them
[33:39] all so i'm not going to play around with
[33:42] this this is something i have to know is
[33:44] how to overcome
[33:48] amen
[33:49] the devil will absolutely play games
[33:52] with you emotionally
[33:55] and if we're depending on willpower or
[33:58] emotion to gauge our level of overcoming
[34:01] amen we are going to find ourselves
[34:03] miserable frustrated and constantly
[34:06] constantly questioning
[34:09] our sonship
[34:11] our faith
[34:13] our brideship
[34:16] but we base all of these things off the
[34:18] word amen
[34:24] and
[34:25] further down in the libyan church age he
[34:27] says
[34:28] in his own personal life
[34:30] contending with himself
[34:33] he's talking about jesus now
[34:36] he's speaking of jesus christ
[34:39] in his own personal life contending with
[34:42] himself
[34:45] he overcame by obedience to the word of
[34:47] god
[34:49] jesus was contending with himself
[34:52] amen where in the garden of gethsemane
[34:54] we can see it clearly and plainly
[34:58] if jesus had to contend with himself
[35:00] what do you think you and i have to do
[35:04] it says he overcame by obedience to the
[35:07] word of god and then brother branham
[35:08] goes to hebrews chapter 5 verse 7 it
[35:11] says who in the days of his flesh when
[35:14] he had offered up prayers and
[35:15] supplications with strong crying and
[35:16] tears unto him that was able to save him
[35:19] from death and was heard in that he
[35:22] feared though he were a son yet learned
[35:24] he obedience by the things which he
[35:26] suffered and being made perfect he
[35:28] became the author of eternal salvation
[35:30] unto all them that obey him
[35:32] what was he obedient to the word of god
[35:36] so he suffered he yielded himself he
[35:39] overcame by obeying the father and
[35:42] yielding to the word and that's how he
[35:44] contended with himself and overcame
[35:46] himself amen it's not as though jesus
[35:50] didn't anymore despise the cross
[35:53] it's not that he prayed in gethsemane
[35:56] till all of a sudden he was no longer
[35:57] despising the cross or despising the
[35:59] shame of the cross it was no longer that
[36:01] he didn't love his disciples anymore and
[36:03] he no longer had a feeling for them and
[36:05] didn't want to leave them amen
[36:07] i believe he still had his desire to
[36:09] stay with his disciples i believe he
[36:10] still had love for them and concerned
[36:12] for them i believe he still despised the
[36:14] shame of the cross
[36:17] but he had overcome himself to yield
[36:19] himself to the will of god to obey the
[36:22] word of god and that was his overcoming
[36:24] that was his victory
[36:29] what was he obedient to the word of god
[36:31] now then there will not listen closely
[36:34] now then there will not be one person
[36:36] who will sit in the throne of the lord
[36:38] jesus christ unless he has been living
[36:40] that word
[36:42] your prayers your fastings your
[36:44] repentances no matter what you present
[36:46] to god none of that will gain you the
[36:48] privilege of sitting in that throne it
[36:50] will be granted only to the word bride
[36:54] as the throne of the king is shared with
[36:55] the queen because she is united to him
[36:57] so only they who are of that word even
[37:00] as he is of that word will share that
[37:03] throne
[37:05] amen
[37:07] it doesn't matter how loud you say it
[37:11] what matters is if you live it
[37:15] it doesn't matter how boldly you
[37:16] proclaim i'm this and i'm that and i'm
[37:20] what matters is if you stay surrendered
[37:22] to that word
[37:24] and you overcome by the word in the word
[37:26] only
[37:28] praise god
[37:30] in the message how can i overcome from
[37:33] 1963 it says lord jesus
[37:38] he said an hour and 15 minutes now
[37:39] standing here trying to take your word
[37:41] and explain to the people how to
[37:43] overcome you told us how it's done you
[37:45] didn't tell us but you showed how it was
[37:48] done you led us you showed us how to do
[37:50] it receive the word inside of us and be
[37:52] sure to hold to that word
[37:55] be sure the hold of that word it is
[37:56] written in every temptation but be
[37:59] humble and walk humbly then we have
[38:01] conquered through you
[38:03] through your power which has already
[38:05] conquered our enemy and the only thing
[38:07] we have to do is just walk humbly with
[38:10] humble with faith believing that and our
[38:13] badge of identification of the holy
[38:15] ghost and satan has to move so brother
[38:18] is giving us directions he's giving us a
[38:21] recipe and he's praying he's praying out
[38:23] to the lord he's saying lord you showed
[38:25] us how to do it you didn't just tell us
[38:27] but you showed us and with it is written
[38:30] amen so we have to receive the word
[38:32] inside of us
[38:35] and hold to it is written in every
[38:37] temptation
[38:39] but be humble and walk humbly
[38:42] this is the recipe this is how jesus
[38:44] lived
[38:47] then
[38:48] we have conquered through you
[38:51] through your power which has already
[38:54] conquered our enemy
[38:55] we're just tapping into the same power
[38:58] when we come humbly submissive to the
[39:00] word we're tapping into the same power
[39:02] that overcame the first time will
[39:04] overcome this time
[39:05] because i'm coming to the same thing the
[39:07] same way
[39:09] i'm coming to the same source getting in
[39:11] the same channel with the same humble
[39:14] humility the same reverence the same
[39:15] surrender amen and then i'm tapping into
[39:18] the same power that overcame back there
[39:21] will overcome today because i'm coming
[39:23] the same way
[39:26] praise be to god let's turn to matthew
[39:28] chapter 4.
[39:30] we've been through this several times
[39:32] together but i want to take a look at it
[39:34] again
[39:38] matthew chapter 4 verse 1.
[39:50] it says now
[39:51] chapter 4 verse 1 of matthew
[39:56] it says then was jesus let up
[39:59] let up of the spirit into the wilderness
[40:01] to be tempted of the devil
[40:03] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[40:05] nights he was afterward a hunger
[40:08] and when the tempter came to him he said
[40:10] if thou be the son of god command that
[40:12] these stones be made bread
[40:14] but he answered and said it is written
[40:16] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[40:19] every word that proceedeth out of the
[40:21] mouth of god
[40:23] then the devil taken him up into a holy
[40:25] city and setteth him on the pinnacle of
[40:26] the temple and saith unto him if thou be
[40:29] the son of god cast thyself down for it
[40:31] is written he shall give his angels
[40:33] charge concerning thee
[40:35] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[40:37] up lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[40:40] against the stone
[40:42] jesus said unto him it is written again
[40:44] that thou shalt not tempt the lord thy
[40:46] god
[40:47] again the devil taketh him up into an
[40:49] exceeding high mountain and showeth him
[40:51] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[40:53] glory of them and saith unto him all
[40:55] these things will i give thee if thou
[40:57] wilt fall down and worship me then saith
[40:59] jesus unto him get thee hint satan for
[41:02] it is written thou shalt worship the
[41:04] lord thy god and him only shalt thou
[41:07] serve
[41:08] then the devil leaveth him and behold
[41:10] angels come and ministered unto him
[41:13] amen
[41:14] brother franco if you could pull up the
[41:16] white board for me i'm going to use that
[41:17] here in just a second brother bam has a
[41:19] quote here in the message jesus christ
[41:21] the same yesterday today and forever
[41:23] from 1958 he says now we find him as
[41:26] soon as god came upon him he was
[41:28] anointed went into the wilderness and
[41:30] out after 40 days and defeated satan by
[41:33] the word of god what did he do he
[41:35] brought any divine promise in reach of
[41:37] the weakest of christians if he was god
[41:40] why did he let satan say if thou be the
[41:42] son of god perform a miracle here and
[41:44] show me you can do it turn these stones
[41:46] into bread and eat he said it is written
[41:48] man shall not live by bread alone
[41:50] so then the satan always tries to coat
[41:53] the word
[41:54] i love how brother brahma says that he
[41:55] doesn't say quote the word he knows what
[41:57] he's saying he coats the word amen he
[41:59] puts a little coating on it and changes
[42:01] it a little bit amen and he does it
[42:03] intentionally brother brahm said
[42:06] satan always tries to coat the word and
[42:08] went back and told him when he put him
[42:10] at the pinnacle of the temple he said
[42:12] again it is written and he defeated
[42:14] satan on the word of god that shows that
[42:16] you can defeat satan on the word of god
[42:18] no matter the word of god will defeat
[42:20] satan any place anywhere under any
[42:23] condition
[42:24] if it's in the belly of a whale
[42:27] if it's an alliance then if it's on the
[42:29] bed with a cancer or if it's laying
[42:31] yawned or bleeding to death in an
[42:32] audible accident the word of god will
[42:35] defeat satan anywhere and the weakest
[42:37] christian can use it it's your god-given
[42:40] privilege to do it
[42:42] praise god
[42:44] amen we've went through this before and
[42:47] taught on this but something new opened
[42:49] up in this message how can i overcome
[42:52] and and i want to look at that in
[42:53] addition to what we've seen before so
[42:55] when we look at the temptation amen of
[42:58] eve in the garden jesus had to overcome
[43:00] the same three types of of temptations
[43:05] and this is this is uh
[43:07] if i can mark it this way
[43:09] these are
[43:10] three
[43:12] oh i'm gonna come down here
[43:23] these are three personal temptations and
[43:25] it has to do with our flesh
[43:26] the one
[43:28] is the lust
[43:33] of the eyes
[43:37] two
[43:39] the lust
[43:42] of the flesh
[43:47] and three
[43:51] the pride
[43:53] of life
[43:55] brother ben was going to show us
[43:56] everything works in threes and when he
[43:58] come to this next one i got really
[44:00] excited because i never seen this before
[44:02] or the one i'm going to get to not the
[44:04] next one so his personal temptation in
[44:06] the flesh was attempted by the lust of
[44:09] the eyes by the lust of the flesh by the
[44:11] pride of life these are things we have
[44:13] to face and we have to overcome eve
[44:16] failed to overcome them because she
[44:17] failed to use the word
[44:19] if she would have just used the word and
[44:21] she didn't have a complicated word
[44:24] the word was simple
[44:26] do not touch
[44:29] it was simple
[44:30] don't partake of that tree it wasn't
[44:33] complex it wasn't complicated if she
[44:35] would have just used the simple words
[44:37] she had but it became complicated when
[44:40] it filtered through human reasoning and
[44:42] she began to wonder about things and
[44:43] question things instead of just simply
[44:46] using the simple word the simple word
[44:48] would have overcome the devil
[44:51] you know the devil comes so
[44:53] sophisticated sometimes amen and so uh
[44:56] when when we're dealing on the level of
[44:58] reasoning it becomes so tricky and so
[45:00] slippery and and so complicated and
[45:03] complex at times amen but if we could
[45:05] just ever get back to the simplicity of
[45:08] the word and say i don't understand what
[45:10] you're saying and i can't put all these
[45:11] pieces together but i know the word says
[45:14] this and i'm going to stay right here
[45:18] it would be a lot better for us
[45:22] all right
[45:23] then there was three things
[45:28] three things we
[45:30] must
[45:32] not
[45:33] do
[45:34] with the word
[45:36] so these go together because satan does
[45:38] all three of these in the temptation to
[45:40] jesus
[45:42] number one
[45:46] to miss
[45:50] interpret
[45:51] the word
[45:53] you should you must not misinterpret the
[45:55] word
[45:57] two
[45:59] you must not
[46:02] misplace the word
[46:04] and three
[46:06] you must not
[46:08] dislocate
[46:09] the word
[46:11] and in these three things
[46:13] when he goes to misinterpret the word he
[46:16] says thou shalt not
[46:17] dash thy foot against the stone he
[46:19] begins to quote the word to jesus thou
[46:21] shalt not dash thy foot amen but he's
[46:24] misinterpreting even the meaning of that
[46:26] scripture
[46:27] it doesn't even mean that it's not even
[46:29] referring he's telling he's telling him
[46:31] to go up on top of the pinnacle and
[46:32] throw himself off to force god to save
[46:34] him that's not even what that scripture
[46:36] is talking about
[46:38] and so the devil will try to
[46:40] misinterpret the word he'll try to
[46:42] misplace it he'll try to have jesus amen
[46:45] making food for himself in the
[46:47] wilderness but that's not the placing
[46:49] there's going to be another time for
[46:50] that in another setting
[46:52] he tries to get him to dislocate the
[46:53] word by telling him to take the kingdom
[46:56] now but that scripture that part of the
[46:58] of the prophecy doesn't fit now it'll
[47:00] fit later amen when he comes to return
[47:03] the son of david to set up the kingdom
[47:04] in the millennial reign so it's part of
[47:06] the word but it's a dislocation of the
[47:08] word
[47:10] all right and so when he he tries to get
[47:13] him by misinterpreting the word by
[47:15] misplacing the word my dislocating the
[47:17] word
[47:18] and he gets him by the tries to tempt
[47:20] him by the lust of the eyes the lust of
[47:21] the flesh the pride of life this is such
[47:23] an education for us if we'll pay
[47:25] attention because the same thing happens
[47:27] to us all the time
[47:29] he's going to try to trip us up by the
[47:31] lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh
[47:33] the pride of life he's going to try to
[47:35] get us to misinterpret the word
[47:37] to misplace the word or to dislocate the
[47:40] word
[47:41] and so we have to be we've seen the
[47:44] devil's tactics amen and so the the
[47:47] devil's tactics i love it the devil
[47:50] comes
[47:51] three ways to tempt your flesh
[47:54] lust of the eyes lest the flesh pride of
[47:56] life
[47:56] he comes with three tactics in the word
[48:00] to try to misinterpret misplace or
[48:02] dislocate
[48:04] but jesus always responds with one
[48:06] method
[48:07] one weapon the sword of the word the
[48:09] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[48:10] god it is always it is written it is
[48:12] written it is written it is written so
[48:15] the devil will try three different ways
[48:17] amen three different methods and and
[48:19] jesus always has one response and that
[48:21] one response is the sword of the spirit
[48:23] which is the word of god
[48:25] so for us we only have one response
[48:28] if we really want to have victory and be
[48:30] an overcomer amen we have to take the
[48:33] word with a strong hand of faith amen
[48:35] and drive it to the heart of the enemy
[48:37] with it is written the word says the
[48:39] prophet taught this is what god taught
[48:41] us in this day
[48:43] and if we'll take that and stand on it
[48:45] amen we will be an overcomer and we will
[48:48] know that we are overcoming because
[48:51] we're overcoming by the word
[48:54] so so
[48:56] whatever method we wanted to use for
[48:59] overcoming in the past let's throw it
[49:01] away and take the overcoming that comes
[49:03] by overcoming by the word regardless of
[49:06] the circumstances god will change the
[49:08] circumstances i don't have control over
[49:10] the circumstances if i had control over
[49:13] the circumstances i would change them if
[49:16] you have control over the circumstances
[49:18] then don't change them then there's
[49:19] something wrong with you
[49:22] but the things we face we cannot control
[49:24] we cannot change in our own power we're
[49:26] depending on god to change them i cannot
[49:29] force him to change him i cannot tell
[49:31] him how to change them i cannot bully
[49:33] god and pressure him into doing
[49:35] something according to my thinking
[49:37] i got to come humbly with the word and
[49:39] let god do what he's going to do but i
[49:41] have to have absolute confidence that
[49:43] god will do it if i just stay with his
[49:45] word and let him work it out the way he
[49:47] said he would work it out it's not my
[49:49] problem to fix now i've taken his word
[49:52] now he has to fix it
[49:56] amen how many of you have given god
[49:58] advice on what to do to solve your
[50:00] problems
[50:01] god i have this problem and i need you
[50:03] to do this
[50:05] and how many times has you solved your
[50:06] problem but he didn't do what you said
[50:08] to do he did something else and it
[50:09] worked out a lot better
[50:13] i think he's training us he wants us to
[50:16] understand how to be an overcomer how to
[50:18] be a real overcomer
[50:22] now brother branham got into three more
[50:24] things here that i want to go into we've
[50:27] taught on all this before but this one
[50:29] was new i saw this for the first time
[50:31] myself
[50:32] and the message how can i overcome
[50:34] he says his 40 days of temptation by
[50:36] god's word he overcome i want to express
[50:39] something here just for a few minutes
[50:41] satan made three major assaults upon him
[50:43] in the temptation
[50:46] three major assaults
[50:48] amen
[50:50] watch it always in them three don't
[50:52] forget it he made three major assaults
[50:55] from the highest to the lowest he tried
[50:56] his best to conquer him but he was the
[50:59] word amen what did he use himself the
[51:02] word what did christ use he used himself
[51:05] the word
[51:07] satan's three major attacks are assaults
[51:09] upon him but he met it with the word
[51:11] every attack he could make it with the
[51:13] word watch this now from the highest to
[51:16] the lowest
[51:18] he goes on he says now first he made his
[51:20] attack upon to use his great power which
[51:23] he knowed he was the word he knowed his
[51:25] position you believe he did
[51:27] this i the son of man he knowed his
[51:29] position and satan come and wanted him
[51:32] to use his own power on
[51:34] himself to feed him want to feed himself
[51:40] he was hungry a man gets hungry he can
[51:43] do almost anything he'll steal rob beg
[51:45] borrow anything he had that appetite
[51:48] remember we have to understand that
[51:49] jesus was 100 man
[51:52] and 100 god
[51:54] when he after 40 days when he was
[51:56] fasting and he says afterward he was a
[51:58] hungered he was hungry
[52:01] very very hungry amen and so now the
[52:03] temptation comes he had that appetite
[52:06] and satan used his first great major
[52:08] assault upon him to make his own power
[52:11] that he had been given to overcome with
[52:14] and use it on himself
[52:17] didn't use it on himself no he used it
[52:20] on others that's right he used it on
[52:23] others not himself it wasn't for him
[52:25] though he could have done it he
[52:27] certainly could have done it
[52:30] so let's look at this next round
[52:35] so these are three
[52:40] errors he called them three great
[52:41] assaults
[52:42] three errors
[52:49] and applying
[52:51] the word
[52:53] right
[52:57] so he tried to tempt him with lust of
[52:58] the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life
[53:00] tried to mis interpret the word misplace
[53:04] the word dislocate the word
[53:06] and he also tries to get him the error
[53:09] and the application of the word
[53:14] i love how brother branham can bring so
[53:15] much out of a passage of scripture
[53:20] first
[53:21] in the in the error
[53:23] the first thing he does
[53:25] is to use
[53:30] his power
[53:33] oh forgot the r
[53:36] you have no idea what kind of pressure
[53:37] it is to write in front of
[53:39] school teachers and good spellers
[53:44] the first was he tried to get him to use
[53:46] his power for himself
[53:49] and jesus wasn't given this position for
[53:51] himself he was given this position for
[53:53] others
[53:55] remember brother branham would be
[53:57] praying for people
[53:59] and so sick he could hardly stand
[54:01] gripping the sides of the pulpit just to
[54:03] stay up and people being healed of
[54:05] cancer deaf ears opening but he himself
[54:08] was so sick he could hardly stand up
[54:10] anymore he said the gift wasn't for me
[54:13] it was for you
[54:14] and brother ben was so faithful even in
[54:16] the messy standing in the gap when he
[54:18] began to pull back because of hurt
[54:19] feelings amen he said i let the sick
[54:22] people lay i had a gift of healing to
[54:24] take to the people and i let them lay
[54:26] and he found that he was he was
[54:27] withholding and he was wrong for doing
[54:29] that he had to get his gift back out to
[54:31] the people because the gift was given
[54:33] for the people and and that's why jesus
[54:36] came he came to redeem he came to save
[54:39] he came with great power to overcome but
[54:41] the devil tried to get him to use it on
[54:43] himself under the lust of the flesh to
[54:46] make food for himself he was trying to
[54:48] get him to use it in a carnal temporal
[54:51] way
[54:54] because god's program is eternal amen
[54:57] god he came for an eternal purpose he
[54:59] came for a word purpose for an eternal
[55:02] purpose and the devil was trying to get
[55:04] him to use his power for a temporal
[55:07] carnal amen satisfaction of the flesh
[55:11] amen to get him out of a tight spot or a
[55:14] difficult situation amen and that was
[55:17] never what that gift in power was for
[55:20] and jesus didn't take the bait because
[55:22] it was a wrong application of the word
[55:24] one god never told him to do it amen and
[55:27] and two it wasn't for him anyways it was
[55:30] for everybody else
[55:32] right praise god
[55:35] that's why you know we can have all
[55:38] these gifts but what good is it for god
[55:40] to give us a gift and us hide it under a
[55:42] bushel basket and us to have a gift and
[55:44] and we just we don't want to get out
[55:46] there because you know i i've been
[55:48] rejected before i've been criticized for
[55:50] singing i got rejected when i did this
[55:52] and and all of this listen that gift is
[55:54] not for you to stay home and enjoy in
[55:56] your private study or your private life
[55:58] if god gave you a gift or a calling or
[56:00] an office in the church it's to be out
[56:02] for everyone else it's not for you to
[56:04] enjoy as you read the word and the word
[56:06] opens to you because god's given you a
[56:07] gift of ministry amen that's not for you
[56:10] that's for the people
[56:12] god's given you a gift to sing a gift of
[56:14] writing songs he's given you a gift of
[56:16] administration a gift of help amen
[56:18] that's not for you to enjoy for your own
[56:20] personal life and benefit that's for
[56:22] others god gave that for the body
[56:24] [Music]
[56:26] amen
[56:27] and jesus came for the rest of the body
[56:30] amen and was he hurt yes was he mocked
[56:32] yes was he ridiculed yes amen was he
[56:35] rejected yes and if you go and give give
[56:38] yourself holy amen to serve the lord and
[56:40] to serve his people with what he's put
[56:42] inside of you you will be misunderstood
[56:44] rejected you will be everything under
[56:46] the sun will happen to you amen not even
[56:49] intentionally sometimes people will
[56:50] reject you or criticize you you'll get
[56:53] your heart stomped on over and over
[56:54] again but it's no right to hold that
[56:57] gift to yourself and use it only for you
[57:00] it didn't come for you it came for the
[57:01] body
[57:04] and jesus passed that temptation
[57:10] how can i overcome again further down he
[57:12] says
[57:18] he says then the second assault
[57:20] said i'll hurry just looks like the time
[57:22] just goes so fast the next great assault
[57:25] was that he made upon him that he would
[57:28] be a show-off
[57:31] and how that does hit god's servants to
[57:33] be a show-off to show what you can do
[57:38] glory to god hallelujah i'm a deliverer
[57:40] i'm so cece come up here on top of the
[57:42] temple and set down here he tempted him
[57:45] to do it now remember
[57:47] he was tempted to do it hard said now if
[57:50] you want to be something before the
[57:52] people stand up here on this temple jump
[57:54] off and i'll give you a scripture for it
[57:56] because it's written
[57:57] he'd give the angels charge over thee we
[58:00] know that that's a mis uh misplacement
[58:03] of the scripture a misinterpretation of
[58:04] the scripture
[58:06] but he gave him a scripture nonetheless
[58:08] amen i'll tell you something for sure
[58:10] that devil's so slick that if if you've
[58:12] got something in your heart you want to
[58:14] do
[58:16] for wrong reasons for fleshly self-pride
[58:20] for the pride of life the lust of the
[58:21] flesh the lust of the eyes and you want
[58:22] to do it anyways rest assured the devil
[58:25] will show you a scripture or a quote
[58:27] that will give you license to go do that
[58:30] and if you're not really honest looking
[58:32] at it it will be a misapplication of a
[58:34] quote a misplacement of a scripture but
[58:37] you'll do it anyways because it already
[58:40] fulfills something you want inside
[58:44] look at eve eve she was beguiled she was
[58:46] deceived she was deceived because she
[58:48] wanted to be deceived
[58:50] brother bam said she didn't know about
[58:52] this mystery
[58:53] replenish the earth but she wanted to
[58:55] know
[58:57] she had a desire to know amen but the
[58:59] information was held back for a period
[59:01] of time the mystery wasn't unlocked yet
[59:04] and she wanted to know amen she didn't
[59:06] know but she wanted to know so when the
[59:08] devil came and when the serpent came to
[59:11] her he began to entice her with this
[59:14] information amen your eyes will be open
[59:16] you'll be like god's doing good and evil
[59:18] it gave her a way to know she wanted to
[59:21] know
[59:22] was she deceived yes
[59:25] but she already wanted to know
[59:30] so listen
[59:31] here you have people walking through the
[59:33] garden of eden where she can walk with
[59:36] her mate adam who is a prophet she can
[59:39] walk with him she could have waited and
[59:41] asked adam
[59:42] and in the cool of the evening god came
[59:44] to walk and fellowship with his children
[59:46] she could have asked god the father but
[59:48] she didn't go to adam she didn't go to
[59:50] god amen because she was being tempted
[59:53] in something she already wanted to do
[59:56] and wanted to know
[59:59] and so he gave her an answer a solution
[1:00:02] a way to have her own desire
[1:00:06] oh i tell you friends the the hardest
[1:00:08] person in the world to overcome is
[1:00:10] ourselves the one that we look at in the
[1:00:12] mirror and if we're ever going to
[1:00:13] overcome cells we have to start being
[1:00:15] really honest with ourselves we got to
[1:00:18] get down to nitty gritty and say you
[1:00:20] know what that's just me cause that's
[1:00:22] what i want to do i'm trying to make it
[1:00:24] work out for me i'm interpreting all the
[1:00:27] little signs you know i want to go do
[1:00:29] this thing and and i've got a little bit
[1:00:31] of a check in my heart a little bit of
[1:00:32] conviction about wasting that money or
[1:00:34] wasting that time or doing this so i'm
[1:00:37] going to watch for god to give a sign
[1:00:38] all of a sudden somebody else said that
[1:00:40] and look at this it connects with this
[1:00:43] and i walked through the store and i saw
[1:00:44] in the newspaper that same word
[1:00:50] it sounds ridiculous but that's exactly
[1:00:52] what we do
[1:00:54] it's exactly what we do
[1:00:57] instead of just saying god
[1:01:00] this is what i want
[1:01:02] but i don't know that it's what you want
[1:01:05] i need a real answer
[1:01:10] it's amazing how dishonest we are with
[1:01:12] ourselves
[1:01:17] but the the funny part is
[1:01:19] deep down we know
[1:01:22] but up here we convince ourselves
[1:01:26] when down here we're not sold
[1:01:30] or maybe i'm the only one who does that
[1:01:33] but i can explain it thoroughly to you
[1:01:36] because i've been through it numerous
[1:01:37] times
[1:01:41] down here there's a little check
[1:01:44] a little no
[1:01:46] but up here in the reasoning realm
[1:01:49] i want to
[1:01:51] it's not sin
[1:01:54] right
[1:01:55] you can't say it's sin
[1:01:58] i want to do this but down here there's
[1:02:00] a little no but i will reason and reason
[1:02:03] and then all if i can find where the
[1:02:04] prophet did it
[1:02:07] where
[1:02:08] see he went fishing
[1:02:11] i can abandon these duties and go
[1:02:13] fishing
[1:02:15] if i can find where the prophet did it
[1:02:17] or i can find some some some something
[1:02:20] to give me just that little edge that
[1:02:23] little push in my reasoning mind amen to
[1:02:26] get over this nagging feeling i'll go
[1:02:28] down that path and then think that i've
[1:02:31] got an answer from the lord but deep
[1:02:33] down in your heart you already know
[1:02:37] i don't know how we can go on being the
[1:02:39] bride of jesus christ unless we start
[1:02:41] being really real
[1:02:43] really real all the way down to the core
[1:02:45] of our persons and stop playing games in
[1:02:47] our mind and stop playing games with the
[1:02:49] word and stop playing games with
[1:02:50] ourselves but get down to the
[1:02:52] nitty-gritty and say this is here i am
[1:02:54] lord this is what i've done god forgive
[1:02:57] me
[1:02:58] and lead me and let me stay in your word
[1:03:01] because he'll try to give you a word
[1:03:03] that will allow you to do what you
[1:03:04] already want to do
[1:03:08] and you know what god will let him
[1:03:11] to prove what's in our hearts
[1:03:14] and every once in a while we need to
[1:03:16] fall and bump our nose real hard to
[1:03:17] realize that i still need god and i
[1:03:20] still need to be honest with god
[1:03:23] and i'm still in fallen flesh and i'm
[1:03:25] still in a corruptable body with a
[1:03:26] corruptable mind and i need to feed the
[1:03:29] white dog and i need to stay close to
[1:03:32] christ and i need to line to this word
[1:03:33] if i ever hope to overcome in this world
[1:03:37] amen
[1:03:40] so number two
[1:03:46] is to exalt
[1:03:48] self
[1:03:52] number two is to exalt self
[1:03:57] he wanted to make him a show-off to show
[1:03:59] his authority
[1:04:01] i'm i'm going to continue in this quote
[1:04:03] but i want to throw in a couple other
[1:04:04] thoughts brother branham has from other
[1:04:06] messages in harvest time he says satan
[1:04:09] satan ever had even then watched in this
[1:04:11] one place here he coded the word
[1:04:14] even on his supernatural that he tried
[1:04:16] to get jesus to do the supernatural see
[1:04:19] being having supernatural what if jesus
[1:04:21] would have listened to him
[1:04:23] now wait you want to stay with the word
[1:04:25] do you you want to stay with the word he
[1:04:27] said it's written he'd give his angels
[1:04:29] charge concerning this any time you dash
[1:04:31] your foot against a stone they bear thee
[1:04:33] up but he wasn't dashing his foot
[1:04:35] against no stone but i'm saying it's a
[1:04:38] misapplication misinterpretation of the
[1:04:41] word that word was if he would dash his
[1:04:44] foot against him he wasn't dashing his
[1:04:45] foot against the stone
[1:04:49] amen
[1:04:50] see watch
[1:04:52] what if he would have to say stayed with
[1:04:54] it did you notice i never said he quoted
[1:04:57] the word he coded it coded it like
[1:04:59] putting an icing on a cake covered it
[1:05:01] over whitewashed it it wasn't in its
[1:05:04] right place
[1:05:06] so he quoted the word to jesus but it
[1:05:08] was a misplacing misinterpretation of
[1:05:11] the word amen to get him amen to do
[1:05:14] something to exalt himself
[1:05:17] and how can i overcome he says but see
[1:05:19] how the devil gets the devil wants you
[1:05:21] to mind him
[1:05:23] he minded only what the father said do
[1:05:25] that's right he said why satan said it's
[1:05:27] written he'd give the angels charge he
[1:05:29] said yes but it's also written
[1:05:32] there you are see he knew who he was
[1:05:35] satan did the now listen to what brother
[1:05:37] brother says the thought runs deeper
[1:05:39] than what it's wrote
[1:05:41] he's talking about the scriptures yes he
[1:05:43] used the scripture but there's something
[1:05:45] deeper you're taking it on a service
[1:05:47] level and misusing the word it's got a
[1:05:50] deeper meaning and there's a deeper
[1:05:51] understanding he said the thought runs
[1:05:53] deeper than what it's wrote it's it's
[1:05:56] inspiration the kernel is on the inside
[1:05:58] of it you see what it really is though
[1:06:01] he could have done it he didn't do it he
[1:06:03] had never paid heed to satan's
[1:06:05] proposition there he
[1:06:08] here is a good thing sometimes satan can
[1:06:10] take you and when you think that you're
[1:06:12] doing the will of god and can make you a
[1:06:14] proposition you'll far for fall for it
[1:06:17] yes sir he sure can
[1:06:20] amen and brother was showing us that
[1:06:23] it's the word but it's the word
[1:06:25] it's the word misplaced
[1:06:28] it's the word misinterpreted yes the
[1:06:31] scripture says that
[1:06:33] but that it's not this application
[1:06:37] yes the word says that but brother
[1:06:39] branham said see it's the thought that's
[1:06:41] deeper than what's wrote
[1:06:44] if we're not going to survive just if we
[1:06:47] have a surface level being able to read
[1:06:50] we need amen the word on the inside we
[1:06:52] need the interpreter of the word amen we
[1:06:54] need the life of the word on the inside
[1:06:57] so that when these things come up you
[1:06:58] could say but that's not that's not
[1:07:00] exactly right
[1:07:02] but it's a quote yeah it's a quote but
[1:07:04] it's not there's something more to that
[1:07:06] amen something inside that there's
[1:07:08] something more to that amen and then if
[1:07:10] you go to look you'll find another quote
[1:07:12] another quote another quote amen that
[1:07:14] tells you really what you ought to do
[1:07:15] and this one's a misplacing of what the
[1:07:18] brother branham said or taking it out of
[1:07:19] context or taking it out of sequence
[1:07:23] and do the same thing with the word amen
[1:07:25] somebody will give you a justification
[1:07:27] for what they do a justification for
[1:07:29] what they want you to do amen but you've
[1:07:32] got to have that kernel on the inside
[1:07:34] that can connect to what's deep in the
[1:07:36] word has to connect what's deep inside
[1:07:37] of you you'll never win this battle in
[1:07:40] the mental realm you'll fail every time
[1:07:42] because the devil will whip you around
[1:07:44] mentally
[1:07:46] but it's going to take the life of the
[1:07:48] word on the inside to recognize the word
[1:07:51] with the right life
[1:07:56] be to god
[1:07:58] so don't be so quick when somebody
[1:08:00] throws a quote
[1:08:01] and your heart's still saying no
[1:08:05] little bell going on ding ding ding ding
[1:08:07] ding but somebody's got a quote
[1:08:10] don't ignore that
[1:08:12] but i tell you too unless you're sure
[1:08:14] don't contradict what they're saying
[1:08:16] just wait don't pass any judgment
[1:08:19] don't because sometimes you get a little
[1:08:21] ding ding inside and you don't really
[1:08:23] know what it is
[1:08:24] it might be because that's right
[1:08:26] it might be because it's wrong
[1:08:28] don't throw it away just don't say
[1:08:30] anything just wait and wait for god to
[1:08:32] bring a revelation out of the word that
[1:08:34] shows you what's right and what's wrong
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:42] amen
[1:08:43] this is rubber meets the road preaching
[1:08:46] amen this is life this is not surface
[1:08:49] life this is deep life this is a bride
[1:08:52] life this is not a denominational life
[1:08:54] this is not a church life we're talking
[1:08:55] about a child of god life
[1:08:58] amen
[1:08:59] the the world amen has made church a
[1:09:03] system the world has made church a
[1:09:05] program and you plug into the system you
[1:09:07] pull into the program and you're fine
[1:09:09] amen and so they the the the devil is
[1:09:12] trying to turn the message in many
[1:09:14] people's minds into the same thing just
[1:09:16] the best program and if i plug into the
[1:09:18] best program i'll be right if i pass
[1:09:21] through the best program
[1:09:23] and i'll tell you the message is the
[1:09:25] best but it's not a program
[1:09:27] it's a person
[1:09:29] it's a person who wants to connect with
[1:09:31] you individually personally and bring
[1:09:33] the life of that person into you so that
[1:09:35] you can live this word amen it's not the
[1:09:38] best program out there
[1:09:40] it's not the best system it's not the
[1:09:42] one that will finally work if we take it
[1:09:44] as a program if we take it as a system
[1:09:47] it'll never work for us because we can
[1:09:49] only take it as a life
[1:09:53] amen but the devil's trying the same
[1:09:55] tactics he's always tried
[1:09:57] just get people to plug into a program
[1:09:59] somewhere
[1:10:01] they'll say i'm in the message
[1:10:03] i'm in the message therefore i'm okay
[1:10:08] that that doesn't compute that's
[1:10:10] denominationalism
[1:10:13] i'm in the message
[1:10:15] i was like you know i why are you doing
[1:10:18] that and i don't understand this and
[1:10:20] didn't the prophet say i'm in the
[1:10:21] message
[1:10:24] i
[1:10:25] i don't know
[1:10:27] that doesn't work for me
[1:10:30] amen
[1:10:31] i want to be in christ and i want christ
[1:10:34] in me
[1:10:35] i want to live by this word and this
[1:10:37] word only i don't want to come into
[1:10:39] these temptations and face the devil
[1:10:41] amen not knowing where i stand and
[1:10:43] having no personal christ on the inside
[1:10:45] no holy ghost amen to lead and guide me
[1:10:48] and come into a mental battle with the
[1:10:50] devil
[1:10:53] it's not going to
[1:10:56] work back to the
[1:11:00] back to the quote
[1:11:02] in um
[1:11:03] where we were reading i don't remember
[1:11:05] no true servant of god ever does that
[1:11:07] he's talking about showing off now you
[1:11:09] see a man showing off his chest out and
[1:11:11] all like that just remember there's
[1:11:13] something wrong there
[1:11:16] if somebody starts to take a gift take
[1:11:19] an ability take a talent and begins to
[1:11:22] exalt themselves and become proud in
[1:11:24] that there's something wrong there
[1:11:27] it's not right there's something wrong
[1:11:29] there amen and the prophet of god is so
[1:11:31] clear to teach us that and not just to
[1:11:33] teach us that but demonstrate that for
[1:11:35] us
[1:11:36] have you ever seen a more gifted human
[1:11:38] being in all of your life
[1:11:40] but he was so humble
[1:11:43] brother brahm didn't didn't play games
[1:11:45] didn't show off and even when he when he
[1:11:48] allowed his campaign managers to create
[1:11:50] the miracle line you know he was warned
[1:11:52] not to do it but he'd let them do it
[1:11:54] again bring your worst cases bring the
[1:11:56] miracle line they'll be and the managers
[1:11:58] were saying guaranteed healings every
[1:12:00] night amen and when brother brown didn't
[1:12:02] stop that when he was supposed to stop
[1:12:04] that all of a sudden in the in the
[1:12:06] prayer line the gift would not work in
[1:12:08] the prophet of god and it wasn't working
[1:12:11] and it scared him to death and he went
[1:12:12] to pray amen and he realized he made his
[1:12:15] mistake because god doesn't want that
[1:12:17] kind of showmanship he doesn't want that
[1:12:19] kind of i guarantee miracles every night
[1:12:21] amen how can you guarantee amen what
[1:12:24] you're depending on god to do as if it's
[1:12:26] linked to you somehow and you have
[1:12:28] control
[1:12:30] i guarantee amen
[1:12:33] and then say healings guaranteed
[1:12:35] healings every night miracle line bring
[1:12:37] your worst cases amen and god tolerated
[1:12:40] that in a season of ignorance and there
[1:12:42] was great healings and great miracles
[1:12:44] but when he corrected it he allowed the
[1:12:46] campaign managers to keep doing it and
[1:12:47] god showed who was in charge when he
[1:12:50] lifted the operation that gift from that
[1:12:51] prophet and it did not work and it and
[1:12:54] it absolutely tore up the prophet of god
[1:12:57] he went in desperation because he prayed
[1:12:59] for a girl that had barely had any
[1:13:01] hearing and when he prayed for i haven't
[1:13:03] read it recently so i may have it wrong
[1:13:04] but i believe it goes she was having
[1:13:06] problems hearing and he went to pray for
[1:13:08] her and she went completely deaf
[1:13:11] that it got worse not better then went
[1:13:13] for another one and the same kind of
[1:13:15] thing happened and he stopped and he
[1:13:16] went back in prayer and desperation amen
[1:13:19] and god was teaching the prophet a
[1:13:20] lesson that he had to learn this is not
[1:13:23] you this is me amen you're you listen
[1:13:26] you and i are not in control of god
[1:13:28] god's in control of us amen
[1:13:32] praise god
[1:13:34] oh this is a lesson to learn friends
[1:13:38] so
[1:13:39] so much nonsense about i'm the bride and
[1:13:42] i can do in this puffed up arrogant
[1:13:44] attitude amen if you if you have a
[1:13:46] revelation that you're the bride it
[1:13:48] should bring such humility such a
[1:13:50] reverence because you know there's no
[1:13:52] way you're capable of it you're not
[1:13:54] worthy of it amen left to yourself you
[1:13:56] would ruin everything god ever tried to
[1:13:58] do in you that you are the worst of the
[1:14:00] worst of the worst but it's by his grace
[1:14:02] he has made you bride and it's by his
[1:14:04] hand he does anything worth doing in
[1:14:07] your flesh is done by him so this
[1:14:09] attitude of i'm the bride amen and i can
[1:14:12] i can continue to dress in a way the
[1:14:14] prophet told us not to dress i can
[1:14:16] dabble with makeup i can i wear
[1:14:18] excessive jewelry tight clothes and high
[1:14:20] heels and put a tv back in my house and
[1:14:22] we can let marriage and divorce issues
[1:14:24] run rampant through the church because
[1:14:25] i'm the bride you've got a wrong
[1:14:27] attitude and a wrong spirit because the
[1:14:29] bride will come humble to this word
[1:14:31] because she knows that she and herself
[1:14:33] has no right to have that title
[1:14:37] you're not born with an inherent right
[1:14:39] to have that title it's the seed of god
[1:14:41] on the inside that gives you the right
[1:14:43] to bear that title and it's god it's not
[1:14:46] you
[1:14:50] if god ever lifted his hand off of you
[1:14:52] and the spirit of god ever moved away
[1:14:54] from you you would see how capable you
[1:14:56] are of controlling your flesh and how
[1:14:57] capable you are of living a christian
[1:14:59] life
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:01] if he gave you one day
[1:15:03] 12 hours from 6 am to 6 pm where the
[1:15:07] spirit would pull right out of you and
[1:15:08] leave you to your own self you would be
[1:15:11] desperate for him to come back because
[1:15:12] you would have no control over this
[1:15:14] animal that you live in
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:17] so there's no place for this arrogant
[1:15:19] attitude amen we've got to come back and
[1:15:21] say i am only what i am by the grace of
[1:15:24] god and you can say i am the bride of
[1:15:26] jesus christ he gave me a revelation
[1:15:28] there's no shame in saying this is what
[1:15:30] i am but i'm not that by me i'm that by
[1:15:33] him
[1:15:35] and i don't the life that i live now i
[1:15:38] don't live by myself amen i live by the
[1:15:41] life of the son of god who's come and
[1:15:43] lived in me
[1:15:46] please be the god
[1:15:48] that's a tactic of the devil
[1:15:52] to get us
[1:15:53] to play around with the word of god
[1:15:56] because of who we are
[1:15:59] to exalt self over the word to exalt
[1:16:02] ourselves and become proud and all of a
[1:16:05] sudden become uh seemingly in our minds
[1:16:08] untouchable
[1:16:11] i'm the bride
[1:16:12] he doesn't want me to suffer i'm the
[1:16:14] bride he wants me to be happy i'm the
[1:16:18] bride don't forget the scriptures it
[1:16:21] says if you want to reign with him you
[1:16:22] have to suffer with him
[1:16:26] amen
[1:16:30] nonsense talk like don't you think god
[1:16:31] wants you to be happy
[1:16:34] you know what i think god wants me to be
[1:16:36] right
[1:16:38] more than he wants me to be happy
[1:16:41] because true joy true happiness is found
[1:16:43] in being aligned with the word and being
[1:16:45] connected with christ amen
[1:16:47] he's not worried about my emotion of
[1:16:49] happy
[1:16:51] he's worried about my soul being right
[1:16:55] praise be to god
[1:16:57] god is good
[1:17:00] amen
[1:17:03] and going on in the
[1:17:05] same quote
[1:17:07] uh how can i overcome
[1:17:09] no servant of god is a show off of
[1:17:12] himself or try to take god's power and
[1:17:14] show himself above somebody else
[1:17:17] i love that quote
[1:17:20] i love it
[1:17:22] you remember moses did that remember
[1:17:24] that god gave him power to do whatever
[1:17:26] he wanted to do made him a prophet he
[1:17:28] walked down to that rock and he smote
[1:17:30] the rock the second time that was
[1:17:32] against god's will
[1:17:34] and god said speak to that rock don't
[1:17:35] smite it again you break all the type
[1:17:38] there the rock is only going to be
[1:17:39] smitten once but he spoke of the
[1:17:41] weakness of the word when he did that
[1:17:44] that wasn't sufficient the word was what
[1:17:46] was going on the rock was the word see
[1:17:48] and the first time he smote the rock and
[1:17:50] the waters come forth
[1:17:52] and they got thirsty again to now go
[1:17:54] back and speak to the rock it was only
[1:17:56] smitten once the insufficiency of the
[1:17:58] word moses testified to it the word
[1:18:00] wasn't right he had to be smitten again
[1:18:03] so moses went down there and smote the
[1:18:05] rock like that and said come forth
[1:18:07] didn't come forth so he smoted again he
[1:18:09] said come forth i command you to come
[1:18:11] forth and the waters come god said come
[1:18:13] up here come here you glorified yourself
[1:18:16] you took my power instead of the
[1:18:17] sanctifying me you sanctify yourself now
[1:18:20] you're not going over in the land
[1:18:23] here's moses there was none like moses
[1:18:25] moses was the was one of the greatest
[1:18:27] prophets of all time amen god used him
[1:18:30] as a deliverer god used him to bring his
[1:18:31] people to the border of the promised
[1:18:33] land give him his word amen moses was a
[1:18:36] great prophet but because he exalted
[1:18:38] himself he did not go over to the
[1:18:40] promised land because god is not playing
[1:18:42] games
[1:18:44] let's look at this in numbers chapter
[1:18:45] 20.
[1:18:51] numbers chapter 20.
[1:18:59] numbers chapter 20 and i want to read
[1:19:01] from verse 7. this is the same story
[1:19:05] numbers chapter 20 verse 7
[1:19:07] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[1:19:10] take the rod and gather thou the
[1:19:12] assembly together thou and aaron thy
[1:19:14] brother and speak ye unto the rock
[1:19:15] before their eyes
[1:19:17] and it shall give forth his water and
[1:19:19] thou shall bring forth to them water out
[1:19:21] of the rock so thou shalt give the
[1:19:23] congregation and their beast's drink
[1:19:25] and moses took the rod from before the
[1:19:27] lord as he commanded him and moses and
[1:19:29] aaron gathered the congregation together
[1:19:31] before the rock and he said unto them
[1:19:34] here now ye rebels must we fetch you
[1:19:36] water out of this rock
[1:19:39] uh oh
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:41] there's the problem right there
[1:19:44] it was me he was exalting himself and
[1:19:47] aaron
[1:19:48] and he was condemning the people and he
[1:19:50] says you rebels listen me
[1:19:52] hey moses had no power
[1:19:55] it was the word of god that was going to
[1:19:57] bring forth water it was because god
[1:19:59] commissioned it god commanded it god
[1:20:01] said so and now he injects himself
[1:20:04] instead of sanctifying god
[1:20:08] he says
[1:20:09] let's go back he says here now he rebels
[1:20:11] must we fetch you water out of this rock
[1:20:13] and moses lifted up his hand with his
[1:20:15] rod he smote the rock twice and the
[1:20:17] water came out abundantly and the
[1:20:18] congregation drank in their beast also
[1:20:21] and the lord spake unto moses and aaron
[1:20:23] because you believed me not
[1:20:26] to sanctify me in the eyes of the
[1:20:28] children of israel therefore you shall
[1:20:30] not bring this congregation into the
[1:20:32] land which i have given them
[1:20:35] amen
[1:20:36] moses
[1:20:37] he exalted himself in the eyes of the
[1:20:40] people and he made himself the deliverer
[1:20:43] of water
[1:20:45] he made himself the one who was able to
[1:20:48] bring water instead of pointing them to
[1:20:50] god he pointed to himself and i'll tell
[1:20:52] you any time you see a ministry that
[1:20:54] keeps pointing people back to themselves
[1:20:56] i have this gift and i have that gift
[1:20:58] and i'll teach you this and i'll tell
[1:21:00] you that and come to me for this i'll
[1:21:02] tell you
[1:21:03] we want to be pointing people to christ
[1:21:05] and say listen the word says amen the
[1:21:08] word says if we stick with the word god
[1:21:10] will do the word says god does god acts
[1:21:12] on his word the word i mean that that's
[1:21:14] the way we want to minister friends
[1:21:16] that's the way we want to live with one
[1:21:17] another that's the way we want to
[1:21:18] encourage one another and i say wait
[1:21:20] till i get there i'll come down there
[1:21:22] and i'll do this and i'll do that
[1:21:26] you just hold on till i'll get there
[1:21:28] we'll take care of this devil
[1:21:32] no
[1:21:33] you say listen let's stand upon the word
[1:21:35] and trust god to do what only god can do
[1:21:37] let's stay with what he gave us and
[1:21:39] trust him that this word will never fail
[1:21:42] god's mighty god's powerful god's never
[1:21:45] failed to keep his word god's never been
[1:21:47] defeated by any enemy leave yourself out
[1:21:49] of the picture and let it all be about
[1:21:51] him his word him working according to
[1:21:54] his word to deliver us
[1:21:56] if we can get ourselves out of the
[1:21:58] picture and give all glory to god amen
[1:22:00] we'll see god come on the scene and do
[1:22:02] what he's always promised to do
[1:22:06] amen
[1:22:08] now it goes on and in the message how
[1:22:10] can i overcome he says the third great
[1:22:12] assault
[1:22:13] satan offered to forfeit his kingdom to
[1:22:15] him
[1:22:16] he did satan said see these kingdoms of
[1:22:18] the world
[1:22:19] these are mine
[1:22:21] i do with them whatever i want to i'll
[1:22:22] forfeit them to you
[1:22:24] but remember
[1:22:26] he was trying to get him to forfeit it
[1:22:28] without the cross
[1:22:30] this is the third great assault
[1:22:33] if he did we'd be lost he could have
[1:22:35] took the kingdom but
[1:22:37] he must he must come back he must be he
[1:22:40] was tempted to do it now death is a hard
[1:22:42] thing he was tempted to take his liberty
[1:22:44] and be the king of the earth without the
[1:22:46] cross
[1:22:47] but if he did his subjects would have
[1:22:48] died satan would have gladly made that
[1:22:51] proposition with him but he said get
[1:22:53] behind me satan
[1:22:55] he didn't do it
[1:22:57] he came and suffered and took the hard
[1:22:59] rugged route
[1:23:00] he took the route of persecution he took
[1:23:02] the route of death
[1:23:04] are we this morning willing to do to
[1:23:06] take the same route that he had taken
[1:23:09] are we willing to die are we willing to
[1:23:11] give ourselves up to god forfeit all the
[1:23:13] world and the things to serve him
[1:23:17] so what was the third great assault the
[1:23:20] third great assault was to have
[1:23:28] victory
[1:23:31] without sacrifice
[1:23:38] he wanted to win the prize
[1:23:41] with no suffering
[1:23:43] win the prize with no sacrifice
[1:23:46] and and in this laodicean enchanted
[1:23:51] environment
[1:23:53] we live in
[1:23:55] it's people's rights
[1:23:58] and we don't want anybody to suffer
[1:24:01] nobody
[1:24:02] we don't want anybody to have a bad day
[1:24:06] so we panter to their emotions and we
[1:24:09] give in to their whims and
[1:24:11] we feed the flesh with all kinds of
[1:24:14] nonsense
[1:24:15] because people's happiness becomes the
[1:24:17] epitome
[1:24:18] of existence
[1:24:21] and nobody
[1:24:23] seemingly has the capacity to suffer
[1:24:25] anything anymore
[1:24:28] nobody has endurance
[1:24:31] i should say almost nobody
[1:24:33] because the christ seed does
[1:24:36] he tried to get christ to bypass
[1:24:38] suffering and i'll tell you friends
[1:24:41] you
[1:24:42] you just hang on the devil tries
[1:24:45] constantly to get us to bypass suffering
[1:24:50] this word
[1:24:52] the word way is a rugged way
[1:24:55] the word path
[1:24:57] is a is a self-denying
[1:25:00] difficult path to walk it'll require
[1:25:02] personal sacrifice it'll require death
[1:25:05] to self it'll require laying down your
[1:25:07] emotions amen to follow after this word
[1:25:10] amen and that goes stark against a con
[1:25:13] direct contrast to the laodicean spirit
[1:25:16] amen but the spirit of christ was
[1:25:18] willing to go through for the glory that
[1:25:19] lay ahead he was willing to follow the
[1:25:21] word and deny himself and make a
[1:25:23] sacrifice out of himself and die out
[1:25:26] completely himself to stay with that
[1:25:28] word and that brought the victory
[1:25:31] what will bring overcoming in our lives
[1:25:33] when we will deny ourselves to stay with
[1:25:36] this word when it cost us friends when
[1:25:38] it cost us relationships when it cost us
[1:25:41] peace amen when we get misunderstood and
[1:25:43] rejected for staying with the word amen
[1:25:45] nobody wants to suffer rejection nobody
[1:25:48] wants to be misunderstood everybody
[1:25:50] wants to be liked by everybody
[1:25:53] and if you're not one of those people
[1:25:55] who want to be liked by everybody then
[1:25:56] there's some disorder
[1:25:59] because everybody wants to be liked
[1:26:02] everybody wants to be loved everybody
[1:26:04] wants to be well thought of amen but to
[1:26:07] take the word way is to take the word
[1:26:08] with the lord's despised few
[1:26:12] and the devil will try one of his
[1:26:14] tactics and the temptation is try to get
[1:26:16] us to the prize without any personal
[1:26:20] sacrifice to be the bride and get all
[1:26:23] the benefits of the bride but never
[1:26:25] having to completely surrender and die
[1:26:28] to self to follow the word to get to the
[1:26:30] prize he wants us to take the title of
[1:26:32] bride pit it to ourselves keep our old
[1:26:35] lust and life and desires and not
[1:26:37] completely die out to our own thinking
[1:26:39] and our own ones amen and call ourselves
[1:26:41] bride and have the prize without the
[1:26:43] sacrifice
[1:26:45] but i tell you it does not work amen if
[1:26:48] you want to reign with them you must
[1:26:49] suffer with them you must be willing to
[1:26:51] lay it all down and it means what does
[1:26:53] it mean it means rejection
[1:26:56] it means misunderstandings it means hurt
[1:27:00] feelings it means criticism it means
[1:27:03] harsh comments oh you'll get every one
[1:27:06] of those because if you take the word
[1:27:08] the word is so contrary to man's
[1:27:10] thinking the word is so contrary to the
[1:27:12] modern era that we live in that people
[1:27:14] will think you're harsh unloving
[1:27:17] unflexible
[1:27:19] you don't care
[1:27:25] has anybody been a christian for very
[1:27:27] long
[1:27:29] you know what i'm talking about your
[1:27:32] family won't understand why you raise
[1:27:34] your children this way
[1:27:36] yeah
[1:27:37] the the people that are around you your
[1:27:38] neighbors and and co-workers and friends
[1:27:40] they they'll they'll criticize you for
[1:27:43] living the way you live they'll mock you
[1:27:45] for not being entertained by the world
[1:27:47] and because you don't know what they're
[1:27:49] talking about when they're talking about
[1:27:51] what was on tv last night
[1:27:54] when they're all laughing about
[1:27:55] something that's going around and
[1:27:57] trending on some social thing a social
[1:27:59] media thing or whatever it is and you
[1:28:02] don't know about about the latest
[1:28:04] trending two billion views of a what
[1:28:06] what i don't know i don't even really
[1:28:08] know what i'm talking about i'll show
[1:28:10] you how
[1:28:12] how good i am at this
[1:28:14] but when you're the only one in the room
[1:28:16] who doesn't know what they're talking
[1:28:17] about
[1:28:18] and they look at you like you're from
[1:28:20] outer space
[1:28:25] i say praise god if that's the worst
[1:28:27] reproach we have to bear
[1:28:30] i mean that's shameful when we have to
[1:28:31] stand in the lineup of saints that have
[1:28:33] gone before
[1:28:34] and you know
[1:28:37] peter he was crucified upside down they
[1:28:40] tried to boil james alive and and oil
[1:28:43] and and they stoned and beat paul and
[1:28:46] finally cut his head off and they say
[1:28:48] what was it like for you
[1:28:49] they made fun of me at work
[1:28:56] sometimes we can't even do that
[1:29:00] sometimes we can't even
[1:29:03] stand on the word
[1:29:05] because we don't want to be laughed at
[1:29:07] or made fun of or rejected
[1:29:09] by coworkers
[1:29:13] trying to get us to take the prize
[1:29:16] without sacrifice
[1:29:19] trying to tempt us
[1:29:21] amen to to win the prize be the bride
[1:29:25] but not have to surrender all
[1:29:29] one of the hardest things for us to lose
[1:29:31] is our reputation
[1:29:33] we guard it we protect it we defend it
[1:29:37] listen
[1:29:39] what good is your reputation
[1:29:42] i want his reputation
[1:29:44] i want to be aligned with him i want to
[1:29:46] be known as mrs jesus christ not
[1:29:48] whatever i was before let that
[1:29:50] reputation die amen let what people
[1:29:52] think of that man die amen but it's what
[1:29:55] i think of him that matters
[1:29:58] so he tried to get him to bypass
[1:30:01] bypass suffering bypass the cross and
[1:30:04] take the prize and take the kingdom and
[1:30:06] rule as the king of the world with no
[1:30:09] suffering
[1:30:10] he's going to try to get you and i
[1:30:13] to believe that we're queen that'll sit
[1:30:15] on that throne
[1:30:16] never having had to be rejected
[1:30:20] mock score and laughed at
[1:30:22] never having to surrender our own wants
[1:30:25] and give up our own ideas and cut off
[1:30:27] relationships and separate from the
[1:30:30] world and
[1:30:32] throw things away and cut off
[1:30:33] entertainment we want to keep all of
[1:30:35] that and still be a son of god and still
[1:30:38] have a right to sit in his throne
[1:30:41] that's a that's a deception of the devil
[1:30:44] but if i want to win that everlasting
[1:30:46] prize god calls for total separation
[1:30:50] from all unbelief
[1:30:52] will it hurt
[1:30:53] yes
[1:30:54] will you be misunderstood
[1:30:56] absolutely
[1:30:58] will you win the prize
[1:31:00] yes will you care when you get to the
[1:31:04] other side
[1:31:05] no
[1:31:09] you know one more quote here he says and
[1:31:11] um
[1:31:12] how can i overcome
[1:31:14] he said overcome how
[1:31:17] by taking the word
[1:31:18] the promise and humility
[1:31:21] humbly walking
[1:31:23] how can i overcome by taking the word
[1:31:26] the promise
[1:31:27] humbly
[1:31:29] walking
[1:31:30] i want to turn to daniel chapter 3
[1:31:32] together and i want to look just a
[1:31:33] couple examples as we wind down
[1:31:37] go to the book of daniel
[1:31:55] look at daniel chapter 3. if we could
[1:31:57] turn there
[1:32:03] this is the story of the three hebrew
[1:32:05] men
[1:32:06] i corrected myself from saying three
[1:32:07] hebrew children they were they were
[1:32:09] children when they went to babylon this
[1:32:11] was some time later
[1:32:13] and if you ever meet them
[1:32:14] on the other side don't call them the
[1:32:16] three hebrew children
[1:32:18] they did grow up
[1:32:20] these are the three hebrew men shadrach
[1:32:22] meshach and abednego they have to face
[1:32:24] the trial of the the king's religion and
[1:32:27] the king's idol they want him to worship
[1:32:29] before it and they refused
[1:32:31] now they're coming before nebuchadnezzar
[1:32:33] in verse 14. he said nebuchadnezzar
[1:32:35] spake and said unto them is it true oh
[1:32:38] shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:32:40] do not ye serve my gods nor worship the
[1:32:43] golden image which i've set up
[1:32:45] now if you be ready that at what time
[1:32:47] you hear the sound of the coronet the
[1:32:49] flute the harp the sack but the sultry
[1:32:51] and the dulcimer and all kinds of music
[1:32:54] you fall down and worship the image
[1:32:55] which i have made well but if you
[1:32:57] worship not you shall be cast the same
[1:33:00] hour into the midst of the burning fiery
[1:33:01] furnace and who is that god that shall
[1:33:04] deliver you out of my hands
[1:33:06] shadrach meshach and abednego answered
[1:33:08] and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we
[1:33:11] are not careful to answer thee in this
[1:33:14] matter
[1:33:15] they're saying we're not cautious we're
[1:33:17] not anxious we know exactly how to
[1:33:19] answer
[1:33:20] we're not careful to answer thee in this
[1:33:22] matter
[1:33:23] if it be so our god whom we serve is
[1:33:26] able to deliver us from the burning
[1:33:28] fiery furnace and he will deliver us out
[1:33:30] of thine handle king
[1:33:32] but if not be it known unto thee o king
[1:33:35] that we will not serve thy gods nor
[1:33:37] worship thy golden image which thou has
[1:33:40] set up
[1:33:42] i love this example because they're
[1:33:45] following the word
[1:33:47] the word tells them that they're not to
[1:33:49] bow before graven images here in a
[1:33:52] foreign land a powerful king you know
[1:33:54] and they're officials in the kingdom
[1:33:56] these are people who have had benefit
[1:33:58] and privilege of having
[1:34:00] an office in a position with the kingdom
[1:34:02] with nebuchadnezzar amen they're not
[1:34:04] poor they're not destitute they're
[1:34:06] they're living
[1:34:07] presumably a good life in babylon but
[1:34:10] now they come and face the word and when
[1:34:12] they come in contact with the word and a
[1:34:15] law to move them contrary to the word
[1:34:18] they refuse to bow and nebuchadnezzar
[1:34:20] gives them another chance and he says if
[1:34:22] you'll do if you'll bow amen it'll be
[1:34:24] well but if not you'll be thrown into
[1:34:27] the furnace and what god will save you
[1:34:29] then and they said we're not careful to
[1:34:31] answer you king and i want you to catch
[1:34:33] the the attitude that they have this is
[1:34:36] what i want to highlight so well
[1:34:38] they don't they don't get brazen and
[1:34:40] bold they don't start spitting threats
[1:34:43] and say you better not if you know
[1:34:45] what's good for you don't throw us in
[1:34:46] that furnace
[1:34:50] they don't say do you know who we are
[1:34:57] but
[1:34:57] when brother branham told us you
[1:34:59] overcome
[1:35:00] by taking the word and humility
[1:35:03] and humbly walk
[1:35:05] this is what these three did they knew
[1:35:06] where they stood on the word they knew
[1:35:08] this was contrary to the word of god and
[1:35:10] they were worshipers of almighty god and
[1:35:12] they were not going to bow before the
[1:35:14] image but they didn't have to stomp yell
[1:35:16] threaten they didn't have to they didn't
[1:35:19] have to
[1:35:20] petition they didn't have to do anything
[1:35:22] they were standing on the word they were
[1:35:23] already overcoming regardless of the
[1:35:25] results
[1:35:27] they were overcomers by staying with the
[1:35:29] word and they said we don't know god is
[1:35:32] able to deliver us
[1:35:34] out of the fiery furnace and he's able
[1:35:36] to deliver us from you he will deliver
[1:35:37] us from your hand
[1:35:39] but even if not
[1:35:41] like i can't guarantee your results i
[1:35:43] don't know what god will do i'm not in
[1:35:45] control of god god's word is in control
[1:35:48] of me
[1:35:50] i'm under the control of god's word god
[1:35:53] is not under my control just because i'm
[1:35:56] standing on his word i can't say god
[1:35:58] will do this and god will do that and
[1:35:59] you just wait and see and and he no
[1:36:03] we have to keep god as god and ourselves
[1:36:06] as his subjects amen and stand on his
[1:36:08] word and know that yeah god is more than
[1:36:10] able to deliver me and i believe he will
[1:36:12] deliver me from your hand but even if
[1:36:15] not we're not going to bow because i'm
[1:36:16] staying with the word
[1:36:19] if god never shows up if i never get a
[1:36:21] tingly feeling if there's no sensation
[1:36:23] if there's no seeming deliverance if all
[1:36:25] this trouble doesn't go away tomorrow
[1:36:27] i'm still standing on the word amen
[1:36:29] because i'm not in control of god i'm
[1:36:32] only controlling my surrender to this
[1:36:34] word god will do what god will do
[1:36:37] he's able i believe he will but if he
[1:36:39] doesn't i'm staying with the word
[1:36:42] if we could just have that attitude
[1:36:44] we're going to see some amazing things
[1:36:46] because god will do what god will do but
[1:36:48] god will share his glory with no one he
[1:36:50] won't share it with a ministry he won't
[1:36:52] share with a man he won't share with the
[1:36:54] church he'll get all the glory and he'll
[1:36:56] do it in such a way when you can come
[1:36:58] humble before him and say god i don't
[1:37:00] know the answer i don't know the
[1:37:01] solution i don't know how to fix this
[1:37:03] problem but i know your word says and
[1:37:05] i'm standing right with your word and i
[1:37:07] know that you will honor your word
[1:37:14] we've tried to figure out too many
[1:37:16] things
[1:37:18] and we've made too many bold
[1:37:20] proclamations
[1:37:22] god will this and god will that
[1:37:27] that's not the example we see
[1:37:30] when people start making bold
[1:37:31] proclamations in the bible usually the
[1:37:33] prophets of god and god had already
[1:37:34] showed them in a vision or told them
[1:37:36] that this is what will happen
[1:37:40] even mekiah makai was brought before
[1:37:42] ahab and jehoshaphat and he has a he has
[1:37:45] a different prophecy than the rest of
[1:37:47] the prophets amen and he's even
[1:37:49] reluctant to give it because they've
[1:37:50] already come and given him a warning
[1:37:52] they said now listen the messenger came
[1:37:54] to get makaya and said this is what's
[1:37:56] been prophesied and you just say the
[1:37:58] same thing
[1:38:00] and brother bannon said they were
[1:38:01] telling him brother mum said they were
[1:38:03] telling him if you want to get back in
[1:38:04] with the organization with the
[1:38:05] denomination you're an outsider just go
[1:38:07] along with this and you'll be accepted
[1:38:09] back
[1:38:11] but he's only going to stay with the
[1:38:12] word but look how he comes in he doesn't
[1:38:15] stomp in and start pushing himself
[1:38:18] around and making something special out
[1:38:20] of himself he comes in he knows what
[1:38:22] they want he knows what ahab wants he
[1:38:25] knows where his heart is and he says
[1:38:26] what do you say he says go on up
[1:38:30] that's what you want to do anyways
[1:38:33] it was only jehoshaphat who really
[1:38:35] wanted to know what the lord was not
[1:38:36] ahab
[1:38:38] so he looked at him so go on up
[1:38:40] he said did i not tell you
[1:38:43] to only speak to me in the name of the
[1:38:45] lord and mekiah says go up but i see
[1:38:48] israel
[1:38:49] as sheep with no shepherd
[1:38:53] he didn't start calling him names he
[1:38:55] didn't start saying do you know who i am
[1:38:57] and
[1:38:59] mackay is just standing there
[1:39:02] and then ahab has him thrown in prison
[1:39:03] and on the way out he said feeding bread
[1:39:06] of sorrow feeding this and that when i
[1:39:08] return he says if you return at all god
[1:39:10] never spoke to me
[1:39:14] now listen he never said there's no
[1:39:16] chance that you're coming back because
[1:39:18] you know who i am
[1:39:21] look at the humility
[1:39:23] if you come back at all god didn't speak
[1:39:25] to me
[1:39:27] look where he put himself
[1:39:31] it wasn't arrogant it wasn't brash it
[1:39:35] wasn't harsh it was just a man who was
[1:39:38] doing what god told him to do
[1:39:40] it was just a man not exalting himself
[1:39:43] but just exalting god and only only
[1:39:45] saying what god told him to say
[1:39:48] not adding a bunch of stuff to it
[1:39:50] not making himself a special person
[1:39:53] just saying if you do return
[1:39:56] god never spoke to me
[1:39:59] praise god
[1:40:01] i love the character that i see in the
[1:40:02] bible
[1:40:04] and i want that character to be in me
[1:40:07] let's go over to daniel chapter 6.
[1:40:22] now
[1:40:26] now when daniel knew that the writing
[1:40:28] was signed he went into his house and
[1:40:31] his windows being opened in his chamber
[1:40:32] toward jerusalem he knelt upon the knees
[1:40:35] three times a day and prayed and gave
[1:40:37] thanks before god as he did before time
[1:40:41] daniel now as as one of the head
[1:40:45] presidents over all the realm of darius
[1:40:48] and the medes and the persians
[1:40:50] he's got other presidents that are
[1:40:52] jealous of him and princes and they have
[1:40:54] darius sign a decree that nobody else
[1:40:55] can worship anybody else but himself
[1:40:58] amen and so so but daniel
[1:41:01] daniel didn't go storming in to the
[1:41:03] king's chamber
[1:41:05] and complain and listen new daniel is
[1:41:09] daniel is the highest ranking of three
[1:41:11] presidents that he put over his entire
[1:41:13] kingdom
[1:41:14] and he's the head of the mall
[1:41:16] and he was going to set the entire
[1:41:18] kingdom under daniel
[1:41:21] so daniel's not like you and i trying to
[1:41:23] go to the warehouse and talk to somebody
[1:41:26] knocking on the door can i have a
[1:41:28] meeting with the speaker of the house
[1:41:31] daniel
[1:41:32] that darius was going to set the whole
[1:41:34] kingdom under daniel's rule he had the
[1:41:36] whole kingdom divided amongst three
[1:41:37] presidents and daniel was the leader of
[1:41:39] them all he could have got an audience
[1:41:40] with darius he could have he could have
[1:41:43] pleaded his case he could have made a
[1:41:45] good case amen no doubt he was wiser
[1:41:47] than them all the reason he was exalted
[1:41:49] and god had given supernatural wisdom he
[1:41:51] could have made him look like fools but
[1:41:53] he didn't do anything this was this was
[1:41:55] attacking the word of god and his
[1:41:58] worship to god amen they were attacking
[1:42:00] god so he just went and did what he
[1:42:03] always did he didn't change his routine
[1:42:06] one drop
[1:42:09] he said when it was written and signed
[1:42:12] he went into his house and his windows
[1:42:14] being open in his chamber
[1:42:17] he didn't say well watch me
[1:42:21] you say i can't
[1:42:23] listen i'll tell you you stay away from
[1:42:25] all this right wing news media garbage
[1:42:29] because they're they're they're messing
[1:42:31] up people's minds making you violent and
[1:42:33] bold and brash amen to fight against
[1:42:35] this and fight against liberalism and
[1:42:37] fight against that amen daniel never
[1:42:39] never made a protest to darius he just
[1:42:42] kept serving god the way he always
[1:42:44] served god he didn't have to yell he
[1:42:46] didn't have to storm around he didn't
[1:42:47] have to start a petition he didn't have
[1:42:49] to start a news media outlet he didn't
[1:42:51] have to start blogs
[1:42:54] all he did was went in and his windows
[1:42:56] already being open
[1:42:59] you know
[1:43:00] they didn't go to have a prayer vigil on
[1:43:01] the capitol steps he just did what he
[1:43:03] always did
[1:43:05] and he prayed
[1:43:07] and he prayed towards the east because
[1:43:09] that was the commandment that he was
[1:43:10] given
[1:43:11] and solomon in his prayer and the
[1:43:13] dedication of the temple asked god to
[1:43:16] hear every prayer
[1:43:18] and daniel believed it
[1:43:20] and he went back to prayer
[1:43:22] submitting to the word of god
[1:43:24] humbly serving god and never raising a
[1:43:27] fuss about it one drop
[1:43:33] in verse 19 it says
[1:43:36] they they arrested him the king could
[1:43:38] not change his decree it was the laws of
[1:43:40] the medes and persians he could not
[1:43:41] change
[1:43:42] so he had daniel thrown in the lion's
[1:43:44] den
[1:43:45] made a sleepless night for him but he
[1:43:47] comes in the morning in verse 19 he says
[1:43:49] then the king arose very early in the
[1:43:51] morning and went in haste into the den
[1:43:53] of lions and when he came to the den he
[1:43:55] cried with a
[1:43:57] lamentable voice and to daniel and the
[1:43:59] king spake and said to daniel oh daniel
[1:44:01] servant of the living god and this thy
[1:44:04] god
[1:44:06] is thy god whom thou serve us
[1:44:07] continually able to deliver thee from
[1:44:09] the lions
[1:44:11] then said daniel unto the king o king
[1:44:13] live forever my god has sinned his angel
[1:44:16] and has shut the lion's mouths and they
[1:44:19] have not hurt me for as much as before
[1:44:21] him innocency was found in me and also
[1:44:23] before the o king have i done no hurt
[1:44:28] the question was that daniel did you
[1:44:30] overcome
[1:44:32] the question was daniel was your god
[1:44:33] abraham to deliver you
[1:44:36] and he said my god sent his angel and
[1:44:39] shut the lion's mouth it wasn't about
[1:44:41] daniel it was about god it wasn't
[1:44:43] daniel's victory daniel overcame by
[1:44:45] standing with the word when he stood
[1:44:47] with the word god stood with daniel
[1:44:50] god shut the mouths of the lions god
[1:44:52] gave him victory and god gave him the
[1:44:54] ability to overcome daniel couldn't have
[1:44:56] done anything to change his situation
[1:44:59] what could the three hebrew men do amen
[1:45:01] to keep themselves from being burnt in
[1:45:03] the fire they had no power they had no
[1:45:05] ability they could not change their
[1:45:07] circumstance only god could deliver them
[1:45:09] from that circumstance
[1:45:11] daniel there was nothing daniel can do
[1:45:14] and there was nothing daniel tried to do
[1:45:16] he just submitted himself and if god
[1:45:18] wanted him eaten by lions he would be
[1:45:19] eaten by lions listen we do too much
[1:45:22] self-preservation and we try to figure
[1:45:24] out what god wants too much and say
[1:45:26] there's no way god would want this and
[1:45:27] there's no way god would allow that and
[1:45:29] god doesn't want me to go through this
[1:45:30] and god doesn't want this to happen to
[1:45:32] me stop doing god's thinking for him and
[1:45:35] let god be god and let god do his own
[1:45:37] thinking and make his own decision about
[1:45:39] what he'll do with you
[1:45:41] he said there's no way god would let
[1:45:42] that happen to me how do you know god
[1:45:44] let daniel get thrown in the lion's den
[1:45:46] he led his three hebrew children he let
[1:45:48] jeremiah be thrown in the pit he let
[1:45:50] isaiah be sawn in half he let peter be
[1:45:52] hung upside down
[1:45:54] he let paul be beat amen with rods beat
[1:45:58] with whips he'd be stoned and left for
[1:46:00] dead he let him be shipwrecked a couple
[1:46:02] times he let him be chased from city to
[1:46:04] city what do you mean god doesn't want
[1:46:06] that to happen to you god won't let that
[1:46:07] to happen to you he's let it happen to
[1:46:09] every other christian that's come down
[1:46:11] through the ages what do you mean you
[1:46:13] know god doesn't want that to happen to
[1:46:15] you
[1:46:16] i know god doesn't want me to suffer
[1:46:18] this way i know god doesn't want this to
[1:46:19] happen to me
[1:46:21] how do you know
[1:46:24] and how dare you say that you know what
[1:46:27] god's thinking
[1:46:31] just say god
[1:46:32] if this is what you want
[1:46:34] then here i am
[1:46:36] i can't deliver myself
[1:46:38] i can't save myself i can't change the
[1:46:40] circumstances
[1:46:42] i'm totally completely in your hands
[1:46:45] i'll tell your friends if we could just
[1:46:47] stop taking things in their own hands
[1:46:49] and fall completely into his hands and
[1:46:51] let god work these things out
[1:46:55] stop assuming that we know what he wants
[1:46:58] i know he wants this and i know he wants
[1:47:00] that
[1:47:03] i was talking to another brother and i
[1:47:04] was sharing with him when i was
[1:47:06] preaching and he says you know he
[1:47:07] started referring to brother brandon
[1:47:08] brother branham is standing in the
[1:47:10] prayer line he calls the prayer line
[1:47:13] he advertises a healing meeting he calls
[1:47:15] the prayer line people are ready to come
[1:47:18] and he says now you know i'm waiting on
[1:47:20] something.
[1:47:22] now i can't say that he will come
[1:47:26] i can't say that he will come
[1:47:29] listen he had a commission from an angel
[1:47:31] to take a gift of healing to the people
[1:47:33] of the world he was working in that
[1:47:34] commission but even with an angel
[1:47:37] commissioning him to take a gift of
[1:47:38] healing to the peoples of the world he
[1:47:40] still could not control god he didn't
[1:47:43] say god's going to come on this pulpit
[1:47:44] in five minutes god's coming down you
[1:47:46] better run to this altar because god's
[1:47:48] going to come and meet you at this altar
[1:47:51] you never hear brother bam saying
[1:47:52] something like that
[1:47:54] you never you say you see him humbly
[1:47:57] saying now i don't know that will come
[1:48:01] i'm waiting
[1:48:03] you know i'm waiting on something
[1:48:07] now
[1:48:08] he's here
[1:48:11] he couldn't control god all he could do
[1:48:13] was stay in the commission
[1:48:15] all he could do is stay obedient all he
[1:48:17] could do was be reverent be humble and
[1:48:19] be in his commission and do what the
[1:48:21] angel told him to do god was going to
[1:48:22] have to do the rest
[1:48:24] brother bam said i'm not the one
[1:48:27] that that tells you those things
[1:48:29] it's him i don't know you you haven't
[1:48:32] touched me you touched the high priest
[1:48:35] he was leaving himself out of it as much
[1:48:37] as he possibly could
[1:48:41] i don't know that will come
[1:48:42] now he's come he brother said he's met
[1:48:45] me here thousands of times
[1:48:48] but he had no guarantee that he was
[1:48:50] going to meet him there again
[1:48:52] he was just trusting that he would
[1:48:55] and acting in faith that he would
[1:48:58] i want that attitude
[1:49:01] i want to stop telling what god's going
[1:49:04] to do
[1:49:05] and just start controlling myself to
[1:49:08] line up to that word and trust god to do
[1:49:10] the rest
[1:49:12] will he deliver you i don't know but i
[1:49:14] believe he will
[1:49:17] amen will he deliver you that sickness i
[1:49:19] don't know god has a plan but i believe
[1:49:22] he will because i believe his word
[1:49:25] and if god ever tells you that he has
[1:49:27] supernatural you say he's already healed
[1:49:28] me it's done it's finished and get up
[1:49:30] and walk away
[1:49:33] but if not just take him on his word and
[1:49:35] say by his stripes i'm already healed
[1:49:37] and just keep walking
[1:49:38] how do you overcome take his word take
[1:49:40] his promise and humbly walk
[1:49:44] amen
[1:49:45] don't
[1:49:46] don't become
[1:49:48] the controller of god
[1:49:51] and don't make god
[1:49:53] your servant
[1:49:56] who has to come at your beck and call
[1:49:59] but become the servant of god that comes
[1:50:01] at his beck and call
[1:50:03] that moves upon his word his commandment
[1:50:05] that surrenders to him and trust him
[1:50:08] to do the rest he's done it for moses he
[1:50:12] did it for david he did it for daniel he
[1:50:14] did it for shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:50:16] he did it for micaiah he did it for
[1:50:18] jeremiah why wouldn't he do it for you
[1:50:23] we have to stay humble
[1:50:26] and surrendered
[1:50:29] brother says again and how can i
[1:50:30] overcome he says
[1:50:32] jesus told us how to do it he overcome
[1:50:35] overcome means
[1:50:37] to stand the test
[1:50:39] to stand the test that's right like the
[1:50:42] old saints did jesus did amidst all of
[1:50:44] his enemies he stood the test everything
[1:50:46] he was tested against he stood it in the
[1:50:48] very face of sickness and him being
[1:50:50] messiah he healed them in the face of
[1:50:52] death he brought it back to life in the
[1:50:53] face of calvary his own death he
[1:50:55] defeated it by surrendering himself why
[1:50:58] by the word
[1:50:59] he said you destroy this temple and i'll
[1:51:01] raise it up in three days the word said
[1:51:03] so and in the presence of death he
[1:51:05] defeated it he overcome death in the
[1:51:07] presence of hell he defeated hell and
[1:51:09] overcome hell yes in the presence of the
[1:51:11] grave he overcome the grave why
[1:51:14] all by the word and humility
[1:51:17] oh my there's the real man there's the
[1:51:20] one to make your example he defeated
[1:51:22] everything he overcome it how did he
[1:51:24] overcome it
[1:51:26] by the by the word and humility
[1:51:30] we've talked many times about him
[1:51:31] standing in
[1:51:33] in the court a pilot standing on trial a
[1:51:37] mockery of a trial and he stood there
[1:51:39] silent because he knew it was the will
[1:51:40] of god
[1:51:42] and even when pilate slipped up and said
[1:51:44] you know i have power to save your life
[1:51:46] and i have power to take your life and
[1:51:48] all jesus said was you the only power
[1:51:51] you have is what's been given to you
[1:51:52] from above
[1:51:56] so if you have power to take my life
[1:51:58] it's because god gave it to you
[1:52:02] can we believe the same thing
[1:52:05] if you have power to take my life it's
[1:52:08] given to you from above if you have the
[1:52:10] power to throw me in jail it's given to
[1:52:12] you from above
[1:52:15] if you have the power to arrest me and
[1:52:17] imprison me it's given to you from above
[1:52:19] because i'm in the hands of god and i
[1:52:20] belong to god i'm not my own i've been
[1:52:23] bought by a price i belong to him and if
[1:52:25] he sees fit that i need in this journey
[1:52:27] to spend some time here or there or in
[1:52:29] this situation
[1:52:30] what am i going to do to change it
[1:52:33] but i'm going to stand on the word and
[1:52:34] keep believing him and i'm going to
[1:52:36] overcome
[1:52:38] by believing the word and staying with
[1:52:40] the word
[1:52:42] brother branham in this message how can
[1:52:44] i overcome he begins to talk about the
[1:52:46] palm lily and brother broom talks about
[1:52:48] the pawn lily in so many different
[1:52:49] sermons and he talks about there was a
[1:52:51] pond lily in the little pond that they
[1:52:52] drained where they built the the
[1:52:54] tabernacle branham tabernacle set there
[1:52:56] was a little pond and he always went by
[1:52:58] and he he admired the pond lily it was
[1:53:00] one of his favorite plants and one of
[1:53:02] his favorite flowers and he begins to
[1:53:03] talk about how it comes out of the muck
[1:53:06] under the dark dank uh uh pond under the
[1:53:09] stagnant waters in the muck laying in
[1:53:12] the mud at the bottom but it begins to
[1:53:13] climb its way to the light until it
[1:53:15] breaks forth out of the water amen and
[1:53:18] it begins to bloom and he said it's so
[1:53:19] beautiful after it blooms you couldn't
[1:53:21] imagine where it started from
[1:53:24] and he starts to type this to the
[1:53:26] believer and he says he that's in you is
[1:53:29] greater than he that's in the world now
[1:53:30] if you look back you're condemned
[1:53:33] when you're still in the world but if
[1:53:34] you're living above that then he that's
[1:53:36] in you has led you above the darkness
[1:53:40] like the lily he's above the darkness of
[1:53:42] the mud he's above the darkness of the
[1:53:44] muddy waters he's in the light
[1:53:46] reflecting the beauty that was put in
[1:53:48] him before he left the mud
[1:53:52] down in the mud
[1:53:54] in the seed was a beauty
[1:53:58] that he had to reflect
[1:54:00] it was already there when he was down
[1:54:03] under the water buried in the mud there
[1:54:06] was already a beautiful lily on the
[1:54:08] inside of that seed but it had to go
[1:54:10] through the process of climbing towards
[1:54:12] the sun moving towards the word of god
[1:54:14] and as it moved it began to become more
[1:54:17] like what it was on the inside and it
[1:54:19] began to reflect what was down inside of
[1:54:21] it and it came into the picture an image
[1:54:23] of a lily then it popped out and in the
[1:54:25] face of the sun it began to reflect what
[1:54:27] was inside of it already and he types
[1:54:29] that with you and i as the believer and
[1:54:31] he said you cannot look back it meant to
[1:54:33] where you came from any time you look
[1:54:35] back to the mud and the muck and the
[1:54:37] mire we came from you get condemned but
[1:54:39] you can only look to where you're going
[1:54:41] amen only look to what you're pointed to
[1:54:43] we all came from all kinds of situations
[1:54:46] from mud and muck but inside the seed
[1:54:49] that was in the mud and the muck was
[1:54:51] something that god wanted to display the
[1:54:54] reflection of his beauty
[1:54:56] and it was already there so don't look
[1:54:58] back at the muck look look at the sun
[1:55:01] and keep climbing to the side and
[1:55:03] following that word and as that word
[1:55:05] comes to manifestation it'll bring all
[1:55:07] the life that was trapped in that seed
[1:55:09] out
[1:55:11] he begins to type this with the
[1:55:12] believers we've been talking about in
[1:55:14] the old testament
[1:55:15] he says now i feel like a shouting
[1:55:18] christian
[1:55:19] what was it there by god at the
[1:55:20] beginning it pressed its way through
[1:55:22] overcome it overcome the shell it
[1:55:24] overcome the mud it overcome the waters
[1:55:26] it overcome everything and was an
[1:55:28] overcomer and reflecting the beauty and
[1:55:30] glory of god how did that lily overcome
[1:55:33] there was a life trapped down inside
[1:55:36] that when sun hit it it began to move
[1:55:38] towards the sun towards the word how did
[1:55:40] it overcome kept moving towards the sun
[1:55:44] how will we overcome keep moving towards
[1:55:46] the sun stay with the word move towards
[1:55:49] the word until the word produces what's
[1:55:51] already inside of you comes out to
[1:55:54] reflect the life that was trapped inside
[1:55:56] what do i do to overcome keep walking in
[1:55:58] the word
[1:56:00] and become what you were always meant to
[1:56:02] become
[1:56:06] he said
[1:56:07] it overcome everything it was an
[1:56:09] overcomer and reflected the beauty and
[1:56:10] glory of god
[1:56:12] that's the way every believer does
[1:56:14] that's the way noah did that's the way
[1:56:16] lot did that's the way look what a mess
[1:56:18] he was in that's the way moses did
[1:56:20] that's the way joshua did that's the way
[1:56:22] daniel did that's the way shadrach
[1:56:23] meshach
[1:56:24] and abednego did that's the way john the
[1:56:26] baptist did zacharias elizabeth that's
[1:56:29] the way simeon that's the way anna every
[1:56:31] one of them did they overcome the mud
[1:56:33] that they were around them and packed
[1:56:35] into them
[1:56:36] stuck their head above the thing and
[1:56:38] shine forth the glory of god that's what
[1:56:40] a real christian does
[1:56:43] what do i do
[1:56:45] just keep stretching towards the light
[1:56:48] just keep moving how did little little
[1:56:51] lily overcome
[1:56:52] buried in mud buried in the pond how it
[1:56:56] had no chance amen of ever being
[1:56:59] anything buried that deep below the
[1:57:01] surface of the water and in the mind
[1:57:04] except there was a seed inside
[1:57:08] and the word the light began to pull it
[1:57:12] and what you and i
[1:57:14] are to become was in us in our soul from
[1:57:17] before the foundation of the world
[1:57:19] and the light of the word is beginning
[1:57:21] to pull us keep walking in the light
[1:57:24] we don't have to figure out how it's
[1:57:26] going to happen how will i get to this
[1:57:28] how will i overcome that stay with the
[1:57:30] word our overcoming is in the word
[1:57:33] stay with the word stay in the light
[1:57:36] god will take care of the rest
[1:57:39] remember joshua now
[1:57:41] joshua is now commissioned to carry the
[1:57:43] children of israel over jordan
[1:57:46] and into the promised land
[1:57:49] and they've already got spies that went
[1:57:50] in some 40 years before and warned
[1:57:53] everybody joshua's already been in there
[1:57:55] he's seen the walled cities he's seen
[1:57:57] the giants he's seen the armament he's
[1:57:59] seen it all and now he's standing at the
[1:58:02] banks of jordan and now it's his job to
[1:58:05] cross jordan and to go into the promised
[1:58:07] land
[1:58:09] but he's got no idea how to get this
[1:58:11] army across that river
[1:58:14] but god provides a way
[1:58:17] he's in the line of duty but he doesn't
[1:58:19] know how to do it he could try you know
[1:58:21] manufacturing some sort of planking
[1:58:23] system and
[1:58:24] a bridge but god's already got a plan if
[1:58:27] it just holds steady and wait god has a
[1:58:29] way across
[1:58:31] and then they come to the first big city
[1:58:33] of jericho amen brother branham said
[1:58:35] they could have chariot races around the
[1:58:36] walls they were so thick amen there was
[1:58:38] no way that they could take it down but
[1:58:41] god said just just walk around it once a
[1:58:44] day for six days and on the seventh day
[1:58:46] go around it seven times
[1:58:48] hey you know
[1:58:50] i'm no general
[1:58:52] i'm no architect i'm nothing but
[1:58:54] there's no way that walking around a
[1:58:57] building is going or walking around a
[1:58:59] city is going to bring the walls down
[1:59:02] you realize the plan that god gave him
[1:59:05] the word that god gave him didn't seem
[1:59:08] sufficient to take care of the obstacle
[1:59:11] that was ahead
[1:59:13] the obstacle was a walled city
[1:59:15] impenetrable with no way to get over it
[1:59:17] no way to get through it but yet they
[1:59:19] had to take it out to go to the rest of
[1:59:21] the promised land and the word that god
[1:59:23] gave them to overcome that obstacle
[1:59:26] seemed completely insufficient
[1:59:30] you have a walled city
[1:59:33] what i want you to do is go take the
[1:59:35] army and walk around it and be real
[1:59:36] quiet don't say anything
[1:59:39] and then what nothing just go back to
[1:59:40] camp
[1:59:42] the next day you walk around it and be
[1:59:44] real quiet
[1:59:45] and then what do we do nothing go back
[1:59:47] to camp six days
[1:59:49] seventh day walk around it seven times
[1:59:52] and on the last time blow the trumpets
[1:59:54] and everybody shout for the mastery for
[1:59:57] the victory
[1:59:59] okay we'll do it
[2:00:01] you realize there was no logical
[2:00:04] explanation
[2:00:05] in the commandment to explain how they
[2:00:08] were going to get into that city
[2:00:11] but jo it wasn't joshua's responsibility
[2:00:14] to figure out how the walls were going
[2:00:15] to come down it was joshua's
[2:00:17] responsibility to keep the word of god
[2:00:22] sometimes we wonder
[2:00:24] you know how is it that
[2:00:26] doing all of these things that god told
[2:00:28] us to do how will it help me overcome
[2:00:30] this situation or that situation it's
[2:00:32] not us to figure out how the walls are
[2:00:34] going to come down and how deliverance
[2:00:36] will come god will take care of that
[2:00:38] the three hebrew men they couldn't
[2:00:40] figure out how they were going to be
[2:00:40] delivered daniel didn't know how he was
[2:00:42] going to be delivered no moses didn't
[2:00:45] know how they were going to get across
[2:00:46] the red sea he nobody knew how they were
[2:00:48] going to do it all they knew was the
[2:00:50] word that they were given and they
[2:00:51] walked according to that word and when
[2:00:53] they walked according to that word god
[2:00:55] provided the deliverance
[2:00:58] god has given us his word in this day
[2:01:00] amen and we're constantly trying to
[2:01:02] solve our own problems and figure out
[2:01:03] how to overcome these obstacles what we
[2:01:05] need to do is back up and just say god
[2:01:07] i'm standing with the word that you gave
[2:01:09] through a prophet i'm doing all that you
[2:01:11] told me to do and i'm trusting you to do
[2:01:13] the rest and i don't know how you'll do
[2:01:15] it i can't even envision how you'll do
[2:01:17] it so i have no suggestions
[2:01:22] because you know what happens if you
[2:01:24] suggest something in prayer and then god
[2:01:25] does it that way you said i said in
[2:01:27] prayer
[2:01:30] and we exalt ourselves again
[2:01:33] but it's better to come and say god i
[2:01:35] have no answers i have no way around
[2:01:37] this i don't have a clue what i'm doing
[2:01:38] but i'm standing on your word and i've
[2:01:40] done as far as i know i've done
[2:01:41] everything that your prophet told me to
[2:01:43] do and i'm staying as faithful as i know
[2:01:45] how to stay to your word and now i'm
[2:01:47] trusting you to bring deliverance to
[2:01:49] bring healing to bring whatever we need
[2:01:52] amen i'm trusting you to do it
[2:01:55] that's the approach
[2:01:57] that i want to have
[2:01:59] i want to read one more scripture
[2:02:02] out of exodus let's turn together to
[2:02:03] exodus 14.
[2:02:05] and we'll finish with this
[2:02:12] exodus 14.
[2:02:25] exodus 14 and 13.
[2:02:29] they're out of egypt
[2:02:31] marching to the promised land
[2:02:33] going out singing and dancing and
[2:02:35] rejoicing
[2:02:36] and they hit their first obstacle
[2:02:39] which is the red sea
[2:02:41] then pharaoh sends his army out
[2:02:44] after them to destroy them and they
[2:02:46] begin to panic and they begin to get
[2:02:48] excited and they begin to chastise moses
[2:02:51] and say why have you let us out here
[2:02:53] this is not what we told you let us stay
[2:02:55] in bondage with the egyptians lest we
[2:02:57] die in the wilderness
[2:02:58] and moses responds before god speaks
[2:03:01] anything to him moses responds and says
[2:03:03] and moses said unto the people fear you
[2:03:05] not stand still and see the salvation of
[2:03:07] the lord
[2:03:08] which he will show you today for the
[2:03:10] egyptians whom you have seen today you
[2:03:12] shall see them again no more forever
[2:03:15] and the lord shall fight for you
[2:03:17] and you shall hold your peace
[2:03:21] stand still
[2:03:24] what i want to say is moses didn't have
[2:03:26] the solution yet
[2:03:28] he just knew what god had told him that
[2:03:30] he was going to bring him to this land
[2:03:33] that they were going to go worship on
[2:03:34] that mountain he didn't know the
[2:03:36] solution he didn't know how yet god
[2:03:38] hadn't told him to take the rod and hold
[2:03:40] it up
[2:03:40] all he knew was that god would not fail
[2:03:43] on his word that we're to go worship on
[2:03:45] mount sinai
[2:03:48] but he knew that he didn't have power to
[2:03:51] deliver them
[2:03:52] and he did not have the solution to the
[2:03:54] problem but he knew who did
[2:03:58] and he says verse 14
[2:04:00] the lord shall fight for you
[2:04:03] and ye shall hold your peace
[2:04:07] when you've done all that god asked you
[2:04:09] to do and you still have no answers
[2:04:13] don't make up answers
[2:04:15] don't pretend that you know what to do
[2:04:17] when you don't know what to do
[2:04:19] don't become so bold that you start
[2:04:21] making declarations that god didn't tell
[2:04:23] you to do and you have no permission to
[2:04:24] do
[2:04:25] just stand and say god you've called me
[2:04:28] to this life you've called me to this
[2:04:30] word and i'm standing on this word and
[2:04:31] i'm in the line of duty and lord i'm
[2:04:33] trusting you to fight for me and deliver
[2:04:36] me i'm going to hold my peace
[2:04:40] until i see what you do and then i'm
[2:04:42] going to be on the other side of the red
[2:04:44] sea with a tambourine singing and
[2:04:46] dancing and talking about the great
[2:04:48] victory that you just brought
[2:04:50] because i didn't even know what to do
[2:04:53] we got family situations we have
[2:04:56] personal situations work situations all
[2:04:58] kinds of situations that we don't have
[2:05:00] the solution to but what we've been
[2:05:02] given is the word and the word is enough
[2:05:04] and if we'll stand with the word and
[2:05:05] have faith in god and stand still
[2:05:09] and watch god fight for us
[2:05:11] and have confidence in him
[2:05:13] i believe we'll see the hand of god over
[2:05:16] and over and over again
[2:05:19] what's the way to walk
[2:05:21] stay with the word and walk humbly
[2:05:25] and let's all stand musicians if you
[2:05:27] could come please
[2:05:28] brother ben if you'll come forward
[2:05:29] please
[2:05:32] i don't know why god will not give me
[2:05:35] permission to leave this subject
[2:05:37] submission and humility and surrender
[2:05:41] amen but there's a reason friends
[2:05:44] there's a reason it's a constant every
[2:05:46] wednesday and every sunday for several
[2:05:48] weeks now a reminder that if you want to
[2:05:51] go up you must go down
[2:05:53] if you want something from god you must
[2:05:55] surrender to him that is he's not
[2:05:57] looking for an arrogant bold nature he's
[2:06:00] looking for a humble submissive nature
[2:06:02] so that he can be the great one among us
[2:06:06] i said god help me
[2:06:08] help me to forsake all my thinking
[2:06:10] and just trust in you
[2:06:14] amen praise god let's bow our heads and
[2:06:17] pray
[2:06:20] lord jesus we thank you father for your
[2:06:22] word
[2:06:23] for the things that your prophet has
[2:06:25] taught us lord
[2:06:26] the wiles and the trappings of the devil
[2:06:29] and the temptation and
[2:06:30] how we always use those three
[2:06:33] those three methods lord
[2:06:35] help us to guard against it by staying
[2:06:37] with your word
[2:06:39] god forgive us lord for our wonderings
[2:06:41] forgive us for taking things in their
[2:06:44] own hand and coming up with their own
[2:06:46] solutions
[2:06:48] sorry god
[2:06:50] and i just pray father that you would
[2:06:52] help us
[2:06:53] to walk humbly before you
[2:06:56] to surrender ourselves to your word to
[2:06:58] stay with the word
[2:07:00] and have confidence that you will work
[2:07:03] the supernatural
[2:07:05] the miraculous
[2:07:06] that you will be powerful and you will
[2:07:08] be our deliverer
[2:07:09] for we have complete confidence in you
[2:07:12] so much so that we can lay ourselves in
[2:07:13] your hand
[2:07:14] and take our hands off
[2:07:16] and know that you'll do better than we
[2:07:18] could

[2:07:21] word may it live inside of us

[2:07:40] for god you're looking for a bride to
[2:07:42] reflect your character
[2:07:44] that we might be on this earth all that
[2:07:45] you were and all that you are

[2:09:42] furnace and daniel
[2:09:44] jeremiah and isaiah
[2:09:47] david and
[2:09:48] moses
[2:09:49] i was thinking of all of them and then i
[2:09:51] was thinking of jesus christ and paul in
[2:09:53] his trial and his arrest in his trial
[2:09:57] one thing you notice in all of these men
[2:09:59] is they don't get excited
[2:10:02] there's no record in the bible that they
[2:10:03] were fearful and running around and
[2:10:05] going from person to person to try to
[2:10:07] get an answer and get help and get
[2:10:09] support
[2:10:10] you don't see where they were anxious
[2:10:12] and nervous and
[2:10:16] they knew god was going to take care of
[2:10:18] them
[2:10:19] they knew who they were
[2:10:21] and they knew who god was
[2:10:22] and that was enough
[2:10:24] i was like that's what i want
[2:10:27] i don't want to face every situation and
[2:10:29] get nervous and run around and try to
[2:10:31] get a solution from somebody and an
[2:10:34] answer from somebody i just want to know
[2:10:37] who i am and i want to know who god is
[2:10:38] and i want that to be enough
[2:10:40] i want to know that i
[2:10:42] i am his child and i've surrendered to
[2:10:44] him and i'm living the life he's called
[2:10:46] me to live and trusting that he'll do
[2:10:49] everything else so that i don't have to
[2:10:50] get nervous or fearful amen
[2:10:54] moses was the first one says fear ye not
[2:10:57] don't be afraid
[2:10:59] the egyptians are coming the red sea is
[2:11:01] here i don't have the answer but don't
[2:11:03] be afraid
[2:11:05] where are we going to go i don't know
[2:11:06] how will we survive i don't know well i
[2:11:08] i don't see there's cliffs here there's
[2:11:10] water here there's an egyptian army here
[2:11:13] it looks like imminent death but but
[2:11:15] moses at that time says fear ye not
[2:11:19] don't be afraid
[2:11:21] and i want to get to that place to have
[2:11:23] that much confidence in god to not only
[2:11:25] know who god is but know who i am in
[2:11:27] christ and say i don't know what he's
[2:11:29] going to do but he's going to do
[2:11:30] something
[2:11:32] and whatever he does it's going to be
[2:11:34] amazing
[2:11:35] and i'm going to give him all the glory
[2:11:38] let's be confident
[2:11:40] let's be let's have some peace about us
[2:11:43] and not get anxious and nervous every
[2:11:45] time something goes wrong but relax
[2:11:48] and say god has always been god and he's
[2:11:50] always saved his people
[2:11:52] this isn't his first day on the job and
[2:11:54] i'm not his first child
[2:11:57] i can relax
[2:11:58] and trust in him
[2:12:00] and let him solve
[2:12:02] all of my problems
