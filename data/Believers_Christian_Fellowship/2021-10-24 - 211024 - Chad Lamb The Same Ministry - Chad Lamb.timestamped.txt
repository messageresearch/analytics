[7:32] levy family they went down this weekend
[7:35] uh for a funeral of an uncle
[7:37] and uh they just had the funeral for
[7:40] brother ezra levy's sister the week

[7:52] close to this uncle who just passed away
[7:54] even lived with him for a little while
[7:56] and so they had the funeral yesterday i

[8:10] away so there's just a lot of things
[8:13] that have been going on in the assembly
[8:14] but god has been good to us amen
[8:17] there's been a lot of loss but god has
[8:18] been good amen so we we thank god that
[8:20] he's a very present help in a time of
[8:23] trouble we thank him for his word amen
[8:25] which changes everything and changes our
[8:26] perspective on everything that happens
[8:28] around us
[8:29] everything that goes on there's
[8:31] something different about a believer
[8:33] when you know where you came from and
[8:35] you know where you're going
[8:36] and you know that you're in the palm of
[8:38] his hand and nothing can take you out of
[8:40] the palm of your hand there is something
[8:42] that changes the atmosphere around you
[8:44] whether it's in blessing or whether it's
[8:46] in sorrow when you're mourning or when
[8:48] you're rejoicing amen there's something
[8:50] that sustains you through it all and
[8:53] it's the grace of god it's nothing that
[8:54] we've done ourselves but it is the
[8:56] supernatural grace of god so we're
[8:58] thankful for that
[9:00] so that we've had heartbreaking things
[9:02] god's been good but we also have
[9:03] exciting things that happen too
[9:05] so today i'd like to announce one
[9:07] exciting thing
[9:08] i'd like to announce the engagement of
[9:10] caleb schwartz and sister caressa golden
[9:13] would you guys stand
[9:14] [Applause]
[9:19] amen god bless you
[9:23] i never saw that coming
[9:27] praise god
[9:29] we're so happy for them we're happy for
[9:30] the two of you may god bless you
[9:33] amen it's good to be a believer it's
[9:36] good to be a christian
[9:37] it's good to serve god
[9:39] through it all he's doing wonderful
[9:41] things amongst us
[9:43] let's stand again let's read the word
[9:46] we'll stand and read one portion of
[9:48] scripture
[9:49] genesis chapter 1
[9:51] verse 26
[9:52] i get a bit of a complex sometimes
[9:54] because i think i start every sermon
[9:56] either in genesis or revelation
[9:58] and i don't mean to do that it just
[9:59] happens that way amen
[10:01] but genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[10:06] and god said it and god said let us make
[10:09] man in our image after our likeness and
[10:12] let them have dominion over the fish of
[10:13] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[10:15] over the cattle and over all the earth
[10:17] and over every creeping thing that
[10:19] creepeth upon the earth
[10:20] so god created man in his own image in
[10:22] the image of god created he him
[10:24] male and female created he them
[10:27] and god blessed them
[10:29] and god said unto them be fruitful and
[10:32] multiply and replenish the earth and
[10:34] subdue it and have dominion over the
[10:36] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[10:37] air and over every living thing that
[10:40] moveth upon the earth amen god bless you
[10:43] you can be seated may the lord bless the
[10:45] reading of his word
[10:46] as we look into his word this morning
[10:49] amen
[10:50] this is such a familiar portion of
[10:52] scripture to us that that we read it and
[10:55] we know it we've been over it and over
[10:56] it but once god takes the veil off of
[10:59] his word amen these scriptures just keep
[11:01] going and going and going and it's like
[11:04] you can never find the end to it but we
[11:06] know that god when he recreated the
[11:08] earth there in genesis chapter 1 when he
[11:10] reformed it after it was void and
[11:13] darkness and the waters covered the face
[11:15] of the deep amen he he spoke his word
[11:18] and the holy ghost went to work and
[11:20] began to reorder the earth and when he
[11:22] got the earth in a certain order then he
[11:24] was going to create man in his own image
[11:26] to rule over this to have dominion over
[11:29] it and so the man had a commission and
[11:31] his commission was to multiply and
[11:33] replenish the earth and to subdue it and
[11:35] have dominion over it so he is going he
[11:38] is called to be
[11:40] a god over the earth to rule over the
[11:42] earth amen and so so now he he's working
[11:46] in this office and in this position that
[11:48] god's putting them so that's his
[11:50] commission that's going to be his
[11:52] ministry if we could look at it that way
[11:54] let's go to genesis chapter 2
[11:57] and read verse 7.
[12:01] i want to lay in a few of these
[12:02] scriptures here
[12:03] genesis 2 and verse 7
[12:07] and the lord god formed man of the dust
[12:09] of the ground and breathed into his
[12:11] nostrils the breath of life and man
[12:13] became a living soul and the lord god
[12:16] planted a garden eastward in eden and
[12:18] there he put the man whom he had formed
[12:22] so god is now taking man that he made
[12:26] and now he's placing him into a body of
[12:28] flesh and he's going to rule amen
[12:31] through this body of flesh he's going to
[12:32] be able to interact with creation
[12:34] because he's going to be made in the
[12:35] same form as the creation let's look at
[12:38] verse 15
[12:41] and the lord god took the man and put
[12:43] him in the garden of eden to dress it
[12:45] and to keep it
[12:46] verse 18
[12:48] and the lord god said it is not good
[12:50] that man should be alone i will make him
[12:52] a help meet for him
[12:55] verse 21 and the lord god caused a deep
[12:57] sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and
[13:00] he took one of his ribs and closed up
[13:01] the flesh instead thereof and the rib
[13:04] which the lord god had taken from man
[13:06] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[13:08] man
[13:09] and adam said this is now bone of my
[13:12] bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[13:15] called woman because she was taken out
[13:16] of man therefore shall a man leave his
[13:19] father and his mother and shall cleave
[13:21] unto his wife and they shall be one
[13:24] flesh
[13:25] so we know this story amen we've read it
[13:28] so many times but we know god had given
[13:31] the man a commission he had a ministry
[13:33] that he was supposed to administer on
[13:35] the earth and in that ministry he was
[13:37] supposed to multiply and replenish he
[13:39] was supposed to subdue and have dominion
[13:41] over the earth and he was supposed to
[13:44] dress and keep the garden so this is all
[13:46] the ministry of the man the ministry of
[13:49] adam
[13:50] amen but i'd like to look at a quote out
[13:53] of the pergamon church age from the
[13:55] church age book and this is the section
[13:57] that's italicized in the church age book
[13:59] because these aren't brother branham's
[14:00] words this is when the angel the lord
[14:02] told him to pick up his pen and write
[14:04] and he picked up his pen and he just
[14:05] began to write when he was done he had
[14:07] to go back and review what he had
[14:09] written and i quote from this many many
[14:11] times because i read it all the time
[14:13] because it's absolutely amazing my
[14:15] brother venom didn't come from his mind
[14:17] it came from the mind of god
[14:20] and he says here in this section of this
[14:22] pick up your pen and writing says the
[14:23] first son adam was the spoken seed word
[14:26] of god he was given a bride to reproduce
[14:29] himself
[14:30] that is why the bride was given to him
[14:32] to reproduce himself to produce another
[14:34] son of god but she found she fell by
[14:37] hybridization she caused him to die
[14:41] the second son jesus also a spoken seed
[14:44] word of god was given a bride like as
[14:45] was adam but before he could marry her
[14:48] she also had fallen she like adam's wife
[14:51] was put to the test whether she would
[14:53] believe the word of god and live or
[14:54] doubt the word and die she doubted she
[14:57] left the word she died
[15:00] from a little group of the true seed of
[15:01] the word god will present christ with a
[15:04] beloved bride she is a virgin of his
[15:06] word she is a virgin because she knows
[15:08] no man made creeds or dogmas
[15:11] and through the members of the bride
[15:13] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[15:15] of god to be made manifest in the virgin
[15:18] the word of promise came to the virgin
[15:20] mary but that word of promise was he
[15:22] himself to be made manifest god was made
[15:26] manifest so what was the promise to come
[15:29] to the virgin when it came to the virgin
[15:31] mary it was he himself to be made
[15:33] manifest it was the word it was god
[15:35] being made manifest and god is going to
[15:37] repeat that now when he gets a virgin
[15:40] bride that will be united to his son
[15:42] and when this virgin bride when they
[15:44] come to the marriage when they come to
[15:46] the marriage now she is going to
[15:48] reproduce him amen
[15:51] it's going to be his life through her
[15:53] she's going to reproduce like what what
[15:56] eve failed to do what the first church
[15:58] age failed to do this bride is now doing
[16:01] what what they failed to do what the
[16:03] commission was and so when you look at
[16:06] the the ministry that was given to adam
[16:08] adam's ministry when he was ministering
[16:10] in his ministry god said it's not good
[16:13] that you should be alone you need a help
[16:15] meet in this ministry i don't want you
[16:17] to do this by yourself in fact brother
[16:19] branham said he he tells us here uh and
[16:22] pick up your pen and right he was given
[16:24] a bride to reproduce himself to to
[16:26] multiply and replenish the earth however
[16:28] god was going to bring that to pass god
[16:30] saw fit that he needed a complimentary
[16:33] piece of himself
[16:35] he needed in order to fulfill the
[16:38] ministry to complete the commission that
[16:40] god gave him it was not going to be
[16:42] completed amen just in the single unit
[16:45] by itself but he was going to pull out
[16:48] of that singular creation of flesh the
[16:50] ingredients to make another vessel and
[16:53] he was going to unite these two vessels
[16:55] to one so that in the eyes of god they
[16:57] would be one amen so the in our eyes in
[17:00] the eyes of
[17:02] anybody who's not understanding god's
[17:04] way you can look into the garden of eden
[17:06] with your imagination and you can see
[17:08] the man and his wife running around and
[17:10] you will always see two but when god
[17:13] looked down in salt too he declared that
[17:15] they're
[17:16] one so god doesn't do math the same way
[17:19] we do math and he doesn't look with the
[17:20] same eyes we looked with
[17:23] when god saw these two united together
[17:25] as one god saw one
[17:28] it says in genesis 5 1 he says this is
[17:31] the book of the generations of adam in
[17:33] the day that god created man and the
[17:34] likeness of god made he him male and
[17:36] female created he them and blessed them
[17:39] and called their name adam in the day
[17:42] when they were created god saw no need
[17:45] to give two names
[17:48] so that means that the woman did not
[17:52] have her own ministry
[17:56] she was never we never read where god
[17:59] commissioned the woman with a ministry
[18:02] she was commissioned while she was still
[18:04] in adam amen when she was still in adam
[18:07] she was receiving the ministry she was
[18:09] receiving the commission and she came
[18:11] forth from adam to be united back to
[18:13] adam amen so that adam could complete
[18:16] the ministry that was given to him and
[18:18] in order to complete it he needed a help
[18:20] meet he needed something that would come
[18:22] from him that would be opposite but the
[18:25] same
[18:27] now remember we we've talked about this
[18:29] before and if i could just share share
[18:31] re-share this with you amen you know
[18:34] even peter re-shared some things he said
[18:36] i just wanted to stir up your minds by
[18:37] way of remembrance amen
[18:39] though you know these things
[18:42] and be well established in present truth
[18:44] but peter wanted to go over it again
[18:46] amen
[18:47] i like that scripture it gives me a
[18:49] license to go over it again
[18:51] but anything that we use
[18:54] that we take to have power if we have
[18:56] power or a force that'll work it always
[18:59] operates or at least to my my narrow
[19:02] understanding of it it operates off two
[19:05] opposing forces of the same thing
[19:07] so in order to have flow of electricity
[19:09] you have to have a positive and negative
[19:11] so are positive and negative different
[19:13] no they're two ends of the same thing
[19:15] they're both electricity
[19:18] if we're going to have hydraulic power
[19:19] that's going to move something you need
[19:21] high pressure and low pressure hydraulic
[19:23] power and high pressure and low pressure
[19:25] work together to make something work
[19:28] amen but what are they they're two ends
[19:30] of the same thing they're both hydraulic
[19:32] pressure
[19:34] if you're going to use magnetism to turn
[19:36] a motor you need positive and negative
[19:38] forces on your magnetism but it's still
[19:41] magnetism
[19:43] so god has set this world up in such a
[19:45] way that these forces that are working
[19:47] amen they're working they're the same
[19:50] thing amen but they're complementary to
[19:52] each other they're they're they're like
[19:54] opposites like male and female male and
[19:57] female is still the same thing it's
[19:59] still mankind
[20:02] a male and female giraffe is still a
[20:03] giraffe amen
[20:05] a male and female lion's a lion a male
[20:07] and female man is a man it's still it's
[20:09] the same thing but god has structured
[20:12] this he's displayed it because the
[20:14] natural types the spiritual amen and god
[20:16] is displayed in such a way amen that if
[20:19] you're going to move something work with
[20:21] something use something to have power
[20:23] amen you're going to take two opposite
[20:25] forces of the same kind of thing the
[20:28] same substance and you're going to be
[20:29] able to do some work with that amen and
[20:32] so god was doing the same thing in his
[20:34] son adam adam now was going to have a
[20:36] complementary opposing peace come out
[20:39] but not opposing in the way of opposite
[20:41] contradictory but opposing in the way of
[20:43] complementary
[20:46] so that they fit together and they
[20:48] complement one another to make a whole
[20:51] so so we see that god this is this is
[20:55] very much uh the nature of god even
[20:58] brother branham tells us in one quote he
[21:01] says because he was a father
[21:04] he had to become a son of man
[21:08] so why did he have to become a son of
[21:10] man because he was a father
[21:13] and the only way he could express father
[21:15] was to become a son of man
[21:17] so in order to express father you have
[21:19] to have son
[21:21] amen it doesn't matter any young couple
[21:23] who's married amen the man can feel like
[21:26] he's a father i'll be a good father it's
[21:28] in me to be a father but he's not a
[21:30] father till he has a son
[21:32] so in order to express father he's got
[21:35] to have something that's opposite to
[21:37] father which is son
[21:39] do you understand what i'm saying
[21:42] so now there's a picture of father
[21:44] because there's been a son amen and the
[21:47] son gets his identity from the father
[21:49] because he came out from the father so
[21:51] so now god this is how god is displaying
[21:54] himself
[21:56] god is using these these forces god is
[21:58] using male and female god is using
[22:01] father and son amen to to display
[22:04] himself to show his attributes to sow
[22:06] his characteristics to display his power
[22:09] of who he is so because he was a father
[22:12] he had to become a son of man
[22:15] brother brahm says that now brother rem
[22:17] doesn't say this but this is just what i
[22:18] say this is something that i ponder if
[22:21] he was a bridegroom
[22:23] how will he express bridegroom he's a
[22:26] bridegroom but he has no bride amen so
[22:28] how will you express bridegroom he must
[22:30] become a bride
[22:35] it's a complementary part to the
[22:37] bridegroom and it has to be in place to
[22:39] express the bridegroom because the
[22:41] bridegroom can't be expressed without
[22:42] the bride
[22:44] so when we begin to understand this we
[22:47] begin to understand our place in the
[22:49] mystery of god amen because this is the
[22:51] mystery of god being revealed and christ
[22:54] is the mystery of god revealed amen just
[22:57] like adam the first son was was a a
[23:00] revelation of a mystery of god who
[23:02] created all things was expressed in the
[23:05] son who was made in his image and his
[23:06] likeness male and female he made them
[23:09] what's male and female it's expressing
[23:11] the likeness of god
[23:13] so now god is expressing through his
[23:15] creation his likeness or a reflection on
[23:18] earth of who he is or what he is or how
[23:21] he is
[23:23] and so now because
[23:25] amen because his son
[23:28] was to be a husband
[23:30] they had to express
[23:32] a bride
[23:35] praise god
[23:37] and so this is the role that the woman
[23:39] plays in the beginning now the woman
[23:41] doesn't have her own ministry
[23:44] she is a partaker of adam's ministry
[23:47] because the commission was given to adam
[23:50] but yet she was present when the
[23:52] commission was given
[23:55] because before god told them to multiply
[23:57] and replenish she was there with adam in
[24:00] spirit form
[24:02] in theophonic form they were there
[24:04] together what brother man tells us like
[24:07] the holy ghost moving over the creation
[24:09] the invisible amen but it wasn't
[24:11] invisible to god it was only invisible
[24:13] to the material on earth
[24:16] and they were together
[24:18] in this expression male and female amen
[24:21] and that expression received the
[24:23] commandment and that commandment was to
[24:26] multiply replenish to subdue and have
[24:28] dominion over the earth and amen when it
[24:31] was expressed in flesh and put in the
[24:32] garden then it was to to to uh
[24:35] it was to keep the garden all right
[24:39] so now all of that was given you'd say
[24:42] well that was all given to adam yes it
[24:44] was given to adam that's why it's clear
[24:46] when god makes the woman and brings her
[24:48] out and unites the two back together he
[24:51] makes sure that he calls them adam so
[24:53] that the woman know what she's supposed
[24:55] to do
[24:58] if she would if god would have given her
[25:00] another name under another name she
[25:02] wouldn't have a commission she would be
[25:04] lost in the creation
[25:06] because what god gave to adam amen adam
[25:10] now must fulfill it's his ministry amen
[25:13] but but when god gave it to adam she was
[25:16] there then
[25:18] so when she comes out in another
[25:20] expression of adam she's still there to
[25:23] help fulfill the commission that was
[25:26] given because she's a joint heir of
[25:28] creation and if adam is to subdue
[25:30] creation have dominion over it she is
[25:32] also to subdue creation and have
[25:34] dominion over it
[25:37] if adam is the multiplying replenished
[25:39] she is also part of that multiplication
[25:42] for replenishment
[25:43] so now we we understand that her
[25:46] ministry is his ministry and his
[25:49] ministry is her ministry
[25:52] because we realize that the bride in
[25:54] christ have the same ministry
[25:57] it's the ministry of christ and that's
[25:59] why when we take the name methodist and
[26:01] we take the name baptism we take the
[26:03] name when we take other names brother
[26:05] brenham calls them names of blasphemy
[26:07] because under those names you get a
[26:09] different ministry
[26:12] so the methodist will have the methodist
[26:15] ministry the baptist will have the
[26:17] baptist ministry the catholics will have
[26:19] the catholic ministry and they'll be
[26:21] ministering according to a
[26:22] denominational head somewhere fulfilling
[26:24] the ministry of the baptist church
[26:27] because they took another name because
[26:29] eve was given a name after she fell
[26:32] through adultery she was given a name so
[26:35] her name is the name of blasphemy her
[26:37] name is the name of adultery
[26:40] is that right
[26:42] and so now when we take these church
[26:44] names we start to take a church ministry
[26:48] amen and that's where spiritual amnesia
[26:50] begins to set in amen and people don't
[26:52] know what they're on earth for what
[26:54] we're supposed to be doing what the
[26:56] commission is why are we here what are
[26:58] we supposed to fulfill because we don't
[27:00] take a church name we take the name
[27:02] jesus christ amen our identification is
[27:04] our headship our headship is our husband
[27:07] the husband and the wife are one unit
[27:11] so
[27:12] his ministry is her ministry
[27:15] so they have the same ministry
[27:21] brother branham says in jehovah jireh
[27:23] from 1964 he says now as sure as adam
[27:26] and eve had to be the same spirit
[27:28] christ in the church has to be the same
[27:30] spirit the same ministry
[27:33] the things that i do shall you do also
[27:35] you see what i mean they had to unite
[27:37] together flesh and blood and god had to
[27:39] come together to be one spirit and jesus
[27:42] christ in his church is one spirit
[27:45] how can the church deny creation how can
[27:47] the church deny the thing that christ
[27:49] told them to do how can we deny it and
[27:51] then say that we are of christ if you
[27:53] abide in me and my words abide in you
[27:56] ask what you will it will be given to
[27:58] you i am the vine you are the branches
[28:00] and the life that's in the vine goes
[28:02] into the branches to bear the fruit
[28:04] fruit bearers
[28:06] so brother brahma is showing us that
[28:08] that that the christ in the church is
[28:11] the same spirit the same ministry and
[28:14] that ministry together when the vine and
[28:16] the branch come together they become
[28:17] fruit bearers
[28:20] bearing the fruit of the ministry
[28:22] so i want to i want to go all the way
[28:23] back and i want to just look at a few
[28:25] excerpts from the ministry and life of
[28:26] jesus christ so let's go go back to luke
[28:29] chapter 2 and i just want to take a
[28:31] couple little snapshots here just so we
[28:33] can identify
[28:35] his ministry
[28:42] you know there are some commissions that
[28:44] have been given to men through the
[28:46] scriptures
[28:47] and there's commissions that are given
[28:49] to fathers fathers
[28:50] amen bring up your children in the
[28:52] nurture and admonition of the lord
[28:54] right
[28:56] but a man cannot do that by himself
[28:59] because he can't be a father by himself
[29:04] and then to bring up the children
[29:05] nurtured ammunition of the lord he's
[29:07] going to need a woman to help him do
[29:08] that
[29:10] is that right
[29:11] so
[29:12] so
[29:13] her ministry
[29:14] is his ministry
[29:18] is that right
[29:19] so when the scripture says fathers
[29:22] amen bring up your children and the
[29:24] nurture and admonition of the lord amen
[29:27] that automatically applies to his wife
[29:30] because his wife has has helped me in
[29:32] that ministry that's her ministry
[29:35] and you know that just because mom and
[29:38] dad don't always do the same jobs
[29:42] in the home dad has to go and he's got
[29:44] to earn he's got to earn bread by the
[29:47] sweat of his brow he's got to he got to
[29:48] go and work to provide amen so that he
[29:51] can bring up in the nurturing ammunition
[29:52] of the lord and mom is able to be there
[29:55] more with the children and she's doing
[29:56] more of these day-to-day trainings and
[29:58] things and dad's doing devotions at
[30:00] night and they're praying together and
[30:02] they're not always doing the same job
[30:06] but they have the same ministry
[30:10] to raise these children amen in the
[30:12] nurture and admonition of the lord amen
[30:14] so she doesn't need a separate
[30:16] commission she needs to understand who
[30:18] she's married to who her head is because
[30:20] her head's commission is her commission
[30:24] that's why when when when uh joshua says
[30:27] you know you serve whichever god you
[30:29] want but as for me and my house we will
[30:31] serve the lord amen nobody looked at his
[30:33] wife and said well what will you do
[30:38] she had already heard what she was going
[30:39] to do we're going to serve the lord amen
[30:42] because she was supposed to be one in
[30:44] unity with her husband amen and if her
[30:46] husband says as for me and my house we
[30:48] will serve the lord then they could look
[30:50] at her and say what are you going to do
[30:51] she's going to say i'm with him
[30:54] his commission's my commission his
[30:56] ministry is my ministry we're going to
[30:58] serve the lord amen
[31:00] and i'm going to help him do that
[31:03] praise be to god
[31:06] luke chapter 2
[31:08] let's read verse 41.
[31:17] now his parents went to jerusalem every
[31:19] year at the feast of passover and when
[31:21] he was 12 years old they went up to
[31:22] jerusalem after the custom of the feast
[31:25] this is jesus at 12 going to jerusalem
[31:27] with his parents and when they had
[31:29] fulfilled the days as they returned the
[31:31] child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem
[31:34] and joseph and his mother knew not of it
[31:37] but they supposed him to have been in
[31:38] the company
[31:40] having been in the company went a day's
[31:42] journey and they sought him among their
[31:44] kinsfolk an acquaintance and when they
[31:46] found him not they turned back again to
[31:48] jerusalem seeking him and it came to
[31:51] pass that after three days they found
[31:53] him in the temple sitting in the midst
[31:55] of the doctors both hearing them and
[31:57] asking them questions
[31:59] man i would have loved to overheard that
[32:01] conversation
[32:03] i would pay a tremendous sum of money
[32:06] right now if i could get a tape
[32:08] recording of that meeting
[32:10] [Music]
[32:11] hearing the doctors of divinity this 12
[32:13] year old boy hearing them and asking
[32:15] them questions i would love to hear the
[32:18] question he asked and and i would i
[32:20] would i don't want to tape i want a
[32:22] video because i want to see the
[32:24] expression on their face when this 12
[32:26] year old asked a doctor of divinity and
[32:27] the jewish law a question and that
[32:29] doctor goes uh um
[32:32] ah
[32:34] go play little boy
[32:41] so he was
[32:43] both sitting in the midst of the doctors
[32:44] both hearing them and asking them
[32:46] questions and all that heard him were
[32:48] astonished at his understanding and
[32:51] answers
[32:53] when they saw him they were amazed and
[32:54] his mother said unto him son why hostile
[32:57] thus dealt with us behold thy father and
[32:59] i have sought thee
[33:00] sorrowing and he said unto them how is
[33:03] it that you sought me wished you not
[33:05] that i must be about my father's
[33:07] business.
[33:09] we see from a very early age
[33:12] brother branham or not brother brennan
[33:15] jesus knew
[33:16] what his commission was
[33:18] and he knew what his father's business
[33:20] was and that he was to be about his
[33:22] father's business and what was his
[33:24] father's business his father's business
[33:26] was the word amen that's always been his
[33:28] father's business is the word that's
[33:30] still his father's business the word and
[33:32] i would say this christ is still about
[33:35] his father's business
[33:37] that's his commission amen the the
[33:39] fulfillment of the word the word for our
[33:42] day the anointed word for the season
[33:44] amen the word is still amen the father's
[33:47] business and christ is still about his
[33:49] father's business
[33:50] but if we're married to christ whatever
[33:53] is his business is our business whatever
[33:55] is his commission is our commission and
[33:57] our commission is the word amen
[34:00] if he was about his father's business
[34:01] we're to be about his father's business
[34:03] too because that's our business
[34:06] is this word
[34:08] amen
[34:11] i would actually like to
[34:13] take some of our 12 year olds to talk to
[34:14] some doctors of divinity
[34:18] i'd love to hear that conversation
[34:20] and i'd like to hear them answer the
[34:22] questions
[34:22] [Laughter]
[34:25] oh praise be to god mine because jesus
[34:28] christ was the word amen and as being
[34:30] the word he understood the word and he
[34:32] knew that that's his father's business
[34:34] was the word and the fulfillment of the
[34:35] word amen and we are part of christ and
[34:38] our business is the word and the
[34:40] fulfillment of the word amen that's why
[34:42] when we ever get confused in life and we
[34:45] start to get distracted by too many
[34:46] things of this world and we start to
[34:48] chase other dreams and other ambitions
[34:50] and other things we need to come back to
[34:52] who we really are and what our
[34:54] commission really is
[34:56] because i am married to christ in an
[34:58] invisible union this is the marriage of
[35:01] the lamb and i'm united to him and what
[35:03] he is i am my identity is in him his
[35:06] commission is now my commission i'm here
[35:09] amen to work in conjunction with him to
[35:12] pull about the ministry that the father
[35:14] has given him
[35:16] and so when i ever want to wonder what
[35:18] i'm on earth for what am i to do what am
[35:21] i supposed to do hey listen that's what
[35:23] we're supposed to do however god does it
[35:26] through you and however god uses you
[35:27] that's what we're supposed to be doing
[35:31] amen
[35:34] in the in the message the token brother
[35:36] brahman says it has to be because a
[35:38] woman and her husband become one they
[35:39] become one and so does the bride in
[35:42] christ become one the ministry of the
[35:44] bride and the ministry of christ is the
[35:46] same
[35:47] and remember these former treaties oh
[35:49] theophilus i have wrote to you that
[35:51] jesus began to do
[35:53] and then brother branham adds and
[35:55] continues to do
[35:57] let's go to acts chapter 1 and look at
[35:59] that together
[36:13] acts chapter 1
[36:15] verse 1
[36:19] the former treatise have i made of
[36:21] theophilus of all that jesus began both
[36:24] to do and to teach until the day in
[36:26] which he was taken up after that he
[36:29] through the holy ghost had given
[36:30] commandments unto the apostles whom he
[36:32] had chosen
[36:34] so brother branham is encapsulating what
[36:36] is taking place in these first two
[36:38] verses amen and when he quotes when he
[36:41] quotes the scriptures he adds an
[36:42] injunction there because he's picking up
[36:44] the truth out of verse two
[36:47] because the holy ghost is continuing the
[36:49] work
[36:51] so he reads the scripture
[36:53] he said the ministry of the bride and
[36:54] the ministry of christ is the same
[36:57] and remember these former treaties of
[36:59] theophilus i wrote to you that jesus
[37:00] began to do and continues to do
[37:04] well he misquoted that scripture i beg
[37:07] your pardon he did not misquote that
[37:08] scripture
[37:10] he understood exactly what the scripture
[37:12] was saying
[37:14] his death didn't stop him he goes on to
[37:16] say no sir he returned again not a third
[37:18] person but the same person returned
[37:20] again in the form of the holy ghost and
[37:22] to continue the work on and continues on
[37:25] said the book of acts jesus christ is
[37:28] saying yesterday today and forever
[37:29] that's the token that's the sign amen so
[37:32] now
[37:33] what he begin to do he continues to do
[37:36] and this is the beginning of the book of
[37:38] acts because brother branham said this
[37:40] wasn't the acts of the apostles this was
[37:41] the acts of the holy ghost in the
[37:43] apostles
[37:44] so it was a continuation of the life and
[37:47] ministry of jesus christ the life that
[37:49] was in him now is coming to the
[37:51] disciples and that life and ministry
[37:53] continue on so when he says oh
[37:55] theophilus all that he began to do that
[37:57] was what he began to do but he didn't
[37:59] finish all his earthly ministry while he
[38:02] was here on earth
[38:05] there's more in that ministry that's
[38:07] unfolding
[38:10] in
[38:11] in modern events made clear by prophecy
[38:13] says turning
[38:14] he says when he begins to reveal himself
[38:17] into the seed form again the same one
[38:19] that went into the ground come back
[38:21] to be the bride
[38:23] just the bride and groom is the same
[38:25] flesh and blood the same ministry and
[38:28] the same things doing just exactly what
[38:30] he'd done
[38:31] the spirit
[38:33] let's look at luke 19
[38:36] and verse 10.
[38:58] luke 19
[39:00] and verse 10 i'm sorry i went to the
[39:02] wrong one
[39:04] for the son of man has come to seek
[39:07] and to save
[39:08] that which was lost
[39:11] what am i supposed to do lord what's my
[39:13] job on this earth what have you called
[39:15] me for what i'm supposed to do
[39:17] whatever his ministry was your ministry
[39:20] is
[39:21] and he came to seek and to save that
[39:23] which was lost what am i here to do to
[39:25] seek and deceive that which was lost how
[39:27] am i going to do it not everybody has
[39:29] the same role not everybody has the same
[39:31] job not everybody's going to do the same
[39:32] thing but the ministry as a whole is out
[39:34] here looking for the last predestinated
[39:37] seed they're out here looking for the
[39:39] last sheep to come into the fold they're
[39:41] here to seek and to save that which is
[39:42] lost because it's a continuation of his
[39:44] ministry we don't ever want to lose
[39:47] sight of that one thing that i want to
[39:49] be conscious of all the time is that we
[39:51] don't get so wrapped up in in our church
[39:54] walk amen that we forget
[39:56] that the ministry of christ was the
[39:58] seeking to save that which was lost
[40:00] there was a reason you work where you
[40:02] work there's a reason you shop where you
[40:03] shop there's a reason sometimes that
[40:05] your vehicle breaks down and you go to a
[40:07] certain shop or something happens in the
[40:09] house you got to call a certain person
[40:11] in or you have interactions with
[40:12] extended family members and these things
[40:14] happen don't forget that there's still a
[40:16] purpose in your life and there's still a
[40:18] ministry of christ in your life because
[40:19] we can get so narrowed down and the
[40:21] blinders can come on that we can be so
[40:24] focused on going to church sunday and
[40:26] going to church wednesday and learning
[40:28] everything and growing and becoming more
[40:30] christ-like amen that's valid that's
[40:32] important we should be doing that but
[40:34] when we get that narrow vision we forget
[40:36] that there's a ministry of christ on
[40:38] earth today and that ministry of christ
[40:41] is in his bride
[40:44] amen and jesus went to church
[40:48] the scripture says he went into the
[40:49] synagogue as was his custom
[40:52] in nazareth his home town he went to
[40:54] church it was his custom to go to church
[40:57] and he stood up and read amen but but so
[41:00] jesus went to church jesus was in
[41:02] synagogues jesus was in worship places
[41:04] but jesus was also in the market amen he
[41:06] was also in the wilderness he was also
[41:09] by the boats of the fisherman's walking
[41:10] along amen he was interacting with this
[41:13] world because he was looking for those
[41:15] predestinated seeds those sheep that
[41:17] were lost that his father had given to
[41:19] him
[41:21] so so every once in a while it's good
[41:24] for us to be reminded that the ministry
[41:26] of christ continues on and the ministry
[41:28] of christ took place in the synagogue
[41:30] but that's not the only place that that
[41:31] the ministry of christ unfolded and
[41:33] unfolded in the synagogue it unfolded in
[41:35] the market it unfolded in the temple it
[41:37] unfolded everywhere
[41:40] so god has us placed everywhere for a
[41:43] reason
[41:45] and so you we may you know we we lose
[41:48] sight of that because we get into the
[41:49] routine of life and when we get into the
[41:51] routine of life we drive the same roads
[41:53] we go to the same stores we do the same
[41:55] thing amen but every so often god
[41:57] interrupts our routine and we have
[41:59] impact with somebody that was just
[42:01] unusual it was odd we had an opportunity
[42:02] to drop us a seat of the word we had a
[42:05] deep conversation with the family member
[42:07] things happen and they sprinkle in it
[42:09] live then we go right back to driving
[42:11] the same roads getting up at the same
[42:13] time amen eating the same meals
[42:17] going to the same restaurants and
[42:18] ordering the same things
[42:21] having the same church times and all of
[42:23] that and we don't want to forget that i
[42:25] am here amen as a continuation of the
[42:28] ministry of jesus christ and i can't
[42:30] make that happen it has to be his spirit
[42:33] through me but i've got to be conscious
[42:35] of when god is wanting to use me and not
[42:37] be so walled off and be in such blinders
[42:40] on my eyes amen that i forget that i'm
[42:42] not just here to make money and have a
[42:44] home and go to church on sunday and
[42:46] wednesday
[42:47] that i have a much broader existence
[42:50] than that a much broader purpose than
[42:51] that
[42:52] the school you go to the people you're
[42:54] in contact with the neighbors that you
[42:56] have it all matters friends it all for a
[42:59] reason and you don't know which
[43:00] conversation is going to be the one you
[43:03] don't know which neighbor is the one or
[43:05] which person in your workplace in your
[43:06] school is the one that you're there for
[43:08] you may not know until the white throne
[43:10] judgment you may not know until the
[43:12] rapture comes and we all go you may not
[43:14] know amen until it unfolds in a
[43:17] supernatural way but rest assured you're
[43:20] here in the continuation of the ministry
[43:22] of jesus christ
[43:25] it doesn't matter your job doesn't
[43:26] matter your role doesn't matter your
[43:28] status in life amen if you're a part of
[43:30] christ if you've been birthed into the
[43:32] body by the new birth then you are part
[43:34] of the ministry of christ and your
[43:36] purpose here amen is is the work and the
[43:39] ministry of your husband
[43:44] praise be to god
[43:45] i think it's good for us to back up
[43:47] every once in a while
[43:49] and re-examine these things and remind
[43:51] ourselves though you be established in
[43:53] this present truth but i want to stir up
[43:55] your minds by way of remembrance that
[43:57] we're here for more than just the the
[43:59] tunnel vision of going to work making a
[44:01] living saving for retirement
[44:04] cooking the meals going to church we're
[44:05] here for more than that and we do all of
[44:08] those things we do them faithfully
[44:10] because that's part of our commission to
[44:11] raise children unto the lord to be
[44:13] faithful in everything it gives us to do
[44:14] that's part of our commission and in
[44:16] that commission of doing the doing just
[44:18] the things that we do god has all these
[44:21] weird things that happen i don't know if
[44:23] i'm the only person that ever has weird
[44:24] encounters but every once in a while i
[44:26] have a strange encounter
[44:28] somebody asks a question somebody will
[44:30] say where do you go to church and like
[44:31] why did you ask me that i don't know i i
[44:34] i forget where i went you asked me too
[44:35] fast
[44:39] what's happening the ministry of christ
[44:41] continues on
[44:45] every once in a while you get to ask a
[44:47] doctor of divinity a question
[44:52] amen
[44:53] have you ever been in that situation
[44:55] every once in a while and it may not
[44:57] have an actual doctor of divinity on his
[44:58] wall but he's self-proclaimed i mean
[45:01] he went to his own university and has
[45:02] his own doctorate degree
[45:04] every once in a while you get to ask
[45:06] them a question
[45:08] and he gets to scratch his head and be
[45:09] astonished
[45:11] at what you say
[45:13] because he already knows everything and
[45:15] you don't know anything and all of a
[45:16] sudden you asked him a question and now
[45:17] he doesn't know how you who doesn't know
[45:19] anything can stumble him who knows
[45:20] everything
[45:22] what is it it's a continuation of the
[45:24] ministry of christ
[45:26] and it happened so
[45:28] it just slid right into life it just
[45:30] happened we didn't know how it happened
[45:32] it just happened and we didn't realize
[45:33] what it was what i want to say this
[45:35] morning is i want to bring our awareness
[45:37] to what's actually happening she is here
[45:40] she and he are one they have the same
[45:42] ministry the ministry of christ and the
[45:44] ministry of the bride are the same
[45:46] ministry and your life is not in vain
[45:48] your workplace is not uh is not just
[45:51] didn't happen haphazardly the places we
[45:53] go and the things that we go through
[45:55] there's a ministry taking place on the
[45:57] earth and we want to be aware awakened
[45:59] to that
[46:03] jesus would would preach the word to
[46:05] many and only a very few would receive
[46:07] it
[46:08] but he didn't stop preaching because
[46:10] only a very few received it
[46:13] it caused him rejection
[46:14] it caused him all kinds of difficulty
[46:17] amen misunderstandings and all kinds of
[46:20] horrible things were said about him but
[46:21] he never backed down because he was here
[46:24] to do the father's business amen
[46:26] he had a ministry he had a job he had a
[46:28] commission and he kept doing it
[46:30] regardless of what was happening around
[46:32] him and regardless of the reaction of
[46:34] the people
[46:35] and i said god help us to keep giving
[46:38] the word regardless of the reaction of
[46:39] the people because the prophet of god
[46:41] told us we're in a gleaning time amen
[46:43] we're digging around through the sheaves
[46:45] and through the cut uh cut off wheat and
[46:48] cut off barley and we're looking for a
[46:49] little bit here and a little bit there
[46:52] amen it may not be i mean half the
[46:54] people may not be ten percent of the
[46:56] people may not be one percent of the
[46:57] people you've ever talked to amen can
[46:59] actually see what you're talking about
[47:01] but it doesn't mean we're not supposed
[47:02] to be gleaning
[47:05] just because it's hard and there's
[47:06] hardly there's hardly a seed anywhere
[47:08] left on the earth does not mean we're
[47:10] not supposed to still be looking for
[47:12] that seed
[47:14] so just because brother brahm said the
[47:15] revival is over this is a gleaning time
[47:17] doesn't mean well the revival's over i'm
[47:19] going to go sit down and no you it's a
[47:21] gleaning time it takes more effort amen
[47:25] before you used to grab handfuls and cut
[47:27] them and handfuls and cut them but
[47:29] that's over with now you're looking for
[47:30] the one that got lost
[47:32] that fell through the
[47:36] cracks hey
[47:38] amen
[47:41] help us never
[47:43] to lose a burden for souls
[47:46] i pray this all the time because i get
[47:48] so burdened by other troubles
[47:51] and i get so burdened by other people's
[47:53] troubles
[47:54] and my troubles and church troubles and
[47:57] political troubles and government
[47:59] troubles and supply chain troubles
[48:04] that i don't want to forget my
[48:06] commission
[48:09] i don't want to forget this is a
[48:11] gleaning time
[48:15] and
[48:16] ruth's gleaning is what caught boaz's
[48:19] attention
[48:22] and it made her a suitable wife
[48:26] because she was a virtuous woman
[48:30] i don't want to become lazy just because
[48:33] laodicean condition is all around me
[48:38] i want to be found faithful all the way
[48:40] to the end
[48:42] i want to be found faithful
[48:44] when the door of the ark is shut if i
[48:46] don't know it shut i still want to say
[48:48] come into the ark come into the ark
[48:50] god will shut the door at some point
[48:52] he's in charge of that i'm not in charge
[48:54] of that and if he doesn't tell me the
[48:55] door is shut i don't want to say well
[48:57] the door is probably shut i want to act
[48:59] like the door is still open amen
[49:02] i want to talk to somebody as if they
[49:03] would hurt here because jesus you know
[49:06] his ministry went out and he dealt with
[49:09] pharisees and he dealt with sadducees
[49:11] and religious leaders and the elders and
[49:13] he and he dealt with the prostitutes and
[49:14] the tax collectors and and all these
[49:16] other kinds he was just looking for
[49:18] somebody that would listen and whoever
[49:20] would listen and receive he would
[49:22] receive them
[49:25] they didn't have to come from a certain
[49:27] category in life he would even he would
[49:29] even talk to nicodemus although he was
[49:31] rough on him
[49:33] nicodemus an elder and a priest amen but
[49:36] he would also talk to zacchaeus amen
[49:39] who was a swindler in a cheat
[49:44] if they would receive him he would
[49:45] receive them
[49:49] i mean
[49:51] some of these people
[49:53] let's just take for instance the woman
[49:55] who washed jesus
[49:56] feet now i'm not saying this to stir you
[50:00] up i'm saying this to stir me up
[50:02] but the woman who washed jesus feet
[50:04] simon
[50:06] couldn't believe jesus would let this
[50:08] woman wash his feet
[50:10] because the whole city knew she was a
[50:12] sinner
[50:13] and jesus said her sins are mini
[50:18] i wonder what she would look like today
[50:23] i wonder how big the plugs would be in
[50:25] her ears
[50:28] and i wonder how chopped off her hair
[50:30] would be
[50:32] and i wonder
[50:34] how dark the sleep the tattoo sleeves
[50:36] would be on her arms
[50:42] you know
[50:44] every once in a while you want into
[50:45] religious people out there they're nasty
[50:47] aren't they
[50:49] but you know who's super friendly
[50:51] the waitress with tattoo sleeves and big
[50:53] plugs in their ear
[50:56] [Applause]
[50:56] [Laughter]
[50:58] they'll talk to you they're friendly and
[51:00] when you say something about the lord
[51:02] they're like wow i never heard that
[51:04] before
[51:06] but that religious person amen they've
[51:08] got everything right they don't look
[51:09] that no tattoos no there's no nothing
[51:11] they're religious they got it all
[51:12] figured out a modern-day pharisee they
[51:14] don't want to hear anything you got to
[51:15] say they want to shut it down they want
[51:16] to call it wrong they're not friendly
[51:18] not nice i don't know why they go to
[51:20] church because they hate their lives
[51:22] they can't even smile
[51:24] can't even be nice to people
[51:28] amen
[51:29] oh god don't make me one of them i want
[51:32] to be as friendly as the girl with plugs
[51:34] in her ears
[51:35] no i don't want to put plugs in my ears
[51:38] but
[51:40] but i i i want to recognize that there
[51:43] can be a seed of god trapped in any one
[51:46] of these vessels
[51:48] any one of them can have a seat of god
[51:50] on the inside i don't want to already
[51:53] decide who will and who won't based on
[51:55] how they look jesus didn't do that amen
[51:58] he had needs go by samaria to a woman
[52:01] who had been on her sixth husband amen
[52:04] he had a woman that would come and break
[52:06] an alabaster box a prostitute one with
[52:08] many sins that the whole city knew how
[52:10] sinful she was that simon could not
[52:12] believe that he would let this woman
[52:14] jesus would go and eat with publicans
[52:16] and sinners until the pharisees would
[52:18] ask his disciples why is it your master
[52:20] eats republicans and sinners
[52:24] what is he doing i you say you say you
[52:27] think he's a prophet but look at him
[52:31] you ever hear brother dawson riley's
[52:33] testimony and brother nelson writes
[52:35] testimony he starts talking about uh
[52:38] he's up at i think it's called cherry
[52:40] lodge or something like that
[52:41] strawberry lodge or i don't know
[52:43] something like that
[52:44] and in the there was a a a woman and her
[52:48] son or adult son that bought this lodge
[52:50] and he would take hunters there and he
[52:51] would stay there and take meals there
[52:53] amen but the the her son got interested
[52:56] in hunting
[52:58] bought some dogs was gone all the time
[52:59] skipping out on work
[53:01] and his mom had to run the place by
[53:03] herself and she started hating dawson
[53:06] because she saw it was his fault and
[53:08] dawson didn't make anything any better
[53:10] he admits himself he didn't have much
[53:12] use for her anyhow
[53:15] so he warns brother brandon brother bam
[53:17] comes to hunt and they're going to go in
[53:18] and eat and he says oh she's got it
[53:20] pretty rough and he said brother says
[53:21] tell me what's going on and he told him
[53:23] the whole story and he said you know
[53:25] you'll see she'll be rough and sure
[53:27] enough they sat down and this woman
[53:29] comes over and she's she's rough she
[53:31] looks at she she turns her back to
[53:33] dawson like this and looks at brother
[53:35] brandon and takes his order and she
[53:37] looks over her shoulder goes what do you
[53:38] want
[53:45] brother and then she leaves and brother
[53:47] goes
[53:48] yeah it's pretty rough
[53:51] but dawson says by the end of the meal
[53:54] she was sitting at the table next to
[53:55] brother brandon he was talking to her
[53:57] about why she didn't go to church
[53:58] anymore she said i used to go and he
[54:00] said well that's not any good
[54:02] and by the time in the end of the
[54:03] conversation she was convinced she was
[54:05] going back to church and gonna serve god
[54:10] i wish that's where i was right now
[54:13] but i'm praying god will make me like
[54:15] that
[54:17] because if she treated me like that i
[54:19] would just not care
[54:22] but i don't want it to be that way
[54:25] i want to be different than that
[54:27] you ever hear perry green's testimony in
[54:29] perry green's testimony i think it was
[54:31] perry green's testimony they went in
[54:33] somewhere and they were getting terrible
[54:34] service horrible service the waitress
[54:36] was being just terrible and and real
[54:38] cantankerous and real nasty and and
[54:41] brother benham said brother perry let's
[54:42] leave her a real good tip
[54:45] and brother perry wasn't so much
[54:47] interested in that because they had
[54:48] pretty bad service and brother benham
[54:50] says her husband's an alcoholic and she
[54:52] had a real rough morning this morning
[54:54] [Music]
[54:58] boy instantly that changes your
[55:00] perspective
[55:04] you know
[55:05] that woman that strawberry lodge or
[55:07] wherever she was
[55:08] she may never have been a predestinated
[55:10] seed of god and never been able to come
[55:11] to the full truth
[55:13] but that didn't stop brother brennan
[55:15] from treating her good and encouraging
[55:16] her to do whatever she could with the
[55:18] word whatever her capacity was whether
[55:21] she was a penny nickel dime or silver
[55:23] dollar if she was a penny brother
[55:25] brenham wanted her to be a penny
[55:28] he didn't try to make her a silver
[55:29] dollar if she could only take a penny's
[55:31] worth he at least got her to give a
[55:33] pennies worth
[55:36] i mean the woman he left a tip for
[55:38] i mean what whatever happened in her
[55:40] life we don't know we don't know
[55:42] whatever happened in the future but but
[55:44] yet you see that brother branham prayed
[55:47] for thousands and thousands of people
[55:49] were non-elect
[55:51] and when god got when he got rebuked and
[55:53] he got chastened and standing in the gap
[55:56] brother bannon began to be upset he says
[55:57] i let sick people lay and here i am with
[56:00] the gift of healing now we know that the
[56:03] gift of healing could never make them
[56:05] born again
[56:07] and we know that the gift of healing
[56:09] that he was praying for multitudes very
[56:11] very very few of them were actually the
[56:13] elect
[56:15] and we know that that gift
[56:17] that gift was only to attract the bigger
[56:20] fish that was out there so that they
[56:22] could get hooked on the word so we know
[56:24] that that gift was never to catch the
[56:26] rainbow trout it was only to attract
[56:28] their attention
[56:30] but because he had the gift he had a
[56:32] response he felt a responsibility to
[56:35] keep the gift before the people because
[56:37] brother benham said whatever i can do to
[56:39] make somebody's life a little bit better
[56:41] that's what i want to do
[56:43] when i ask you if jesus christ was here
[56:45] on earth what would he do would he would
[56:47] do whatever he could to make somebody's
[56:49] life a little bit better i believe so
[56:53] who was who was jesus rough with
[56:56] wasn't rough with the prostitute he
[56:57] wasn't rough with the woman caught in
[56:59] adultery he wasn't rough with the woman
[57:00] of samaria at the well he was rough with
[57:03] the religious leaders who lied to their
[57:06] people
[57:07] who hid the truth and unrighteousness
[57:10] and who blasphemed the word
[57:14] and and jesus did not have much kind
[57:16] things to say about them and he didn't
[57:18] pull any punches
[57:20] but he wasn't punching zacchaeus or
[57:23] matthew or peter
[57:27] do you understand
[57:29] that
[57:30] that yeah right is right and wrong is
[57:33] wrong amen but if somebody doesn't know
[57:35] they're wrong
[57:37] how about showing them another way
[57:39] before they get condemned
[57:42] you've got people growing up in this
[57:43] generation have no clue not the first
[57:46] clue what the gospel is it's not like it
[57:48] was when i was growing up as a boy as a
[57:50] boy most everybody went to church in the
[57:52] 70s and 80s everybody had some general
[57:54] understanding of of being born in sin
[57:57] and a christ who needed to come and shed
[57:59] his blood for our redemption that
[58:01] message is lost now
[58:06] i said god help me never to become an
[58:09] old religious critic
[58:13] help me god
[58:16] you know
[58:17] just
[58:18] just by
[58:19] just by
[58:20] being christ
[58:23] and giving somebody an opportunity amen
[58:26] just to respond in a positive way to the
[58:28] word that's in you
[58:31] brother banham told us at the white
[58:33] throne judgment when you when you see it
[58:36] there in the scriptures in matthew 25 i
[58:38] believe it is the it separates them as
[58:40] the sheep from the ghosts and tells them
[58:42] when you fed me you fed me when i was
[58:44] hungry you called me when i was naked
[58:46] you visited me in prison they said when
[58:47] lord he said when you did this for the
[58:48] least of these mine brethren you did it
[58:50] unto me
[58:51] and brother branham tells us there'll be
[58:53] those who are given entrance into
[58:54] eternal life solely based on being kind
[58:58] to the elect
[59:03] my question to you is
[59:05] how many of them do you want there on
[59:07] your account
[59:10] none
[59:12] one fine
[59:13] ten
[59:14] hey remember they live outside of the
[59:16] city being non-elected but you live in
[59:18] the city but don't forget the gates are
[59:20] never closed by day or by night
[59:24] the gates are never closed by day or by
[59:26] night so that your neighbor that
[59:28] co-worker stood up for your work that
[59:30] whatever whatever whatever the situation
[59:32] amen they're allowed access into the
[59:35] city and to you anytime they want and
[59:38] when they come rolling up the city and
[59:39] you greet them and see them you're not
[59:41] going to regret taking the time to talk
[59:44] to them amen you're not going to regret
[59:46] the conversations you had the the deed
[59:48] that you did the being a good neighbor
[59:50] amen you're not going to regret not
[59:52] being a cantankerous old religious prank
[59:57] see i think what happens is we forget
[59:59] who we are
[1:00:01] spiritual amnesia creeps back in and we
[1:00:03] get back into a laodicean right back
[1:00:06] into work and back in to making ends
[1:00:09] meet and back into the troubles all
[1:00:10] around us and the news reports it's
[1:00:12] coming out and you forget this is the
[1:00:14] ministry of jesus christ the ministry of
[1:00:16] jesus christ can set free the bound set
[1:00:18] free the captives amen it is the
[1:00:20] ministry of jesus christ that will sit
[1:00:22] on the throne at the white throne and be
[1:00:24] giving entrance to some and not to
[1:00:26] others amen it's the thing that we'll be
[1:00:28] judging is the ministry of christ
[1:00:31] and here you are amen the ministry of
[1:00:33] christ is going on inside of you amen we
[1:00:36] cannot forget what power that is going
[1:00:38] on within us
[1:00:40] we cannot forget who we are
[1:00:45] what a disservice
[1:00:47] what a disservice
[1:00:50] to
[1:00:51] be so irritable you talk to nobody
[1:00:58] what a disservice
[1:01:00] i'm going to order everything online
[1:01:02] because i can't stand people anymore
[1:01:07] that's a tough temptation i'm telling
[1:01:08] you
[1:01:17] oh god's good
[1:01:21] is it a wicked world absolutely does it
[1:01:23] trouble us to walk through it absolutely
[1:01:28] but jesus walked through a whole
[1:01:31] group of infirm halt blame
[1:01:35] lame blind diseases of every kind laying
[1:01:38] by the pool
[1:01:39] of bethesda
[1:01:42] and he stepped over this one and he ran
[1:01:44] around this one and every disease
[1:01:46] imaginable every affliction
[1:01:48] and he went there because the father led
[1:01:49] him to one
[1:01:52] he prayed for that one and that one was
[1:01:54] healed and he went stepping back over
[1:01:55] bodies and walking around
[1:01:59] he went there for one
[1:02:03] amen
[1:02:05] could god lead us
[1:02:08] into some of these nasty places
[1:02:11] i'm not talking about going into vile
[1:02:12] places like bars and nightclubs and
[1:02:14] stuff like that
[1:02:16] but i mean the vile place of walmart
[1:02:22] i mean walmart has become a freak show
[1:02:28] is that right
[1:02:30] i mean you don't want to take your
[1:02:31] children in there anymore
[1:02:34] but would god lead you in there for one
[1:02:40] i just don't want to rule anything out
[1:02:43] i don't want to come up with my own idea
[1:02:46] i don't i don't want to become blind i
[1:02:48] don't want spiritual needs to creep back
[1:02:49] and i don't want to forget that i have
[1:02:52] come to this earth for a purpose and
[1:02:54] that purpose is to declare him
[1:02:57] and whatever he wants to do with my life
[1:02:59] i want to be willing to give it to him
[1:03:03] brother branham
[1:03:05] was asked a question in questions and
[1:03:06] answers on the seals he said with the
[1:03:08] bride of christ would the bride of
[1:03:10] christ have a ministry before the
[1:03:11] rapture he said sure that's what's going
[1:03:14] on right now
[1:03:15] the bride certainly it's the message of
[1:03:17] the hour the bride of christ sure she's
[1:03:19] consisted of apostles prophets teachers
[1:03:21] evangelists and pastors is that right
[1:03:24] that's the bride of christ sure she's
[1:03:26] got a ministry great ministry it's the
[1:03:28] ministry of the hour it'll be so
[1:03:30] humble
[1:03:32] the pride of a ministry absolutely it's
[1:03:34] the ministry of the hour i'd like to say
[1:03:37] this way if i could say it without
[1:03:39] offending anybody
[1:03:40] it's the only ministry of christ on the
[1:03:42] earth
[1:03:46] i mean i don't mean to offend anybody
[1:03:49] but it is where christ is
[1:03:53] he's left the denominations
[1:03:56] he's united with this bride this is the
[1:03:58] only place the ministry of christ is
[1:04:02] so when brother branham was going to go
[1:04:04] to alaska because he wanted to get away
[1:04:06] from the people because of rejection he
[1:04:08] was going to pull the ministry of christ
[1:04:10] away from the masses
[1:04:13] and god wouldn't allow him to do that
[1:04:17] i've entertained thoughts of montana
[1:04:26] but it's not right
[1:04:29] any more than it was right for brother
[1:04:30] and i understand i feel sorry for him
[1:04:33] like i would be encouraging him yeah i
[1:04:35] think you should go to alaska brother i
[1:04:37] mean
[1:04:38] no man can take what you're going
[1:04:40] through it's not possible you get away
[1:04:42] brother go take but that's not what god
[1:04:44] wanted god wanted that ministry to
[1:04:46] continue on
[1:04:48] and even if it was just
[1:04:50] to pray for the sick
[1:04:52] that would be healed and thank god for
[1:04:54] their healing and never be able to
[1:04:56] receive anything else out of the word
[1:05:01] but he still had to have that ministry
[1:05:08] pyramid church age we're back into this
[1:05:11] section further down and pick up your
[1:05:13] pen and write
[1:05:14] so those in the bride do only his will
[1:05:16] no one can make them do otherwise they
[1:05:18] have thus saith the lord or they keep
[1:05:20] still they know that it has to be god in
[1:05:22] them doing the works fulfilling his own
[1:05:24] word he did not complete all his work
[1:05:26] while in his earthly ministry so now he
[1:05:29] works in and through
[1:05:31] the bride
[1:05:33] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:05:34] for him to do certain things that he
[1:05:36] must now do but he will now fulfill
[1:05:38] through the bride that work which he
[1:05:40] left for this specific
[1:05:42] time
[1:05:44] i said god help me to be faithful to
[1:05:46] that
[1:05:47] what is that that's my commission that's
[1:05:50] my calling to be united with him for the
[1:05:53] completion of his work his ministry is
[1:05:56] my ministry
[1:05:58] his commission is my commission
[1:06:01] what god called him to do is what god
[1:06:02] called me to do
[1:06:04] because that's my husband
[1:06:07] we know colossians 1 really well but i'm
[1:06:09] going to read it again colossians 1 26
[1:06:11] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:06:14] ages and from generations but now was
[1:06:15] made manifest to his saints to whom god
[1:06:17] would make known what is the riches of
[1:06:19] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:06:21] gentiles which is christ in you
[1:06:23] the hope of glory
[1:06:25] where is christ
[1:06:27] in you that's the mystery that's being
[1:06:29] unfolded today is the is where christ is
[1:06:32] and where christ is working
[1:06:34] and and that's the hope of glory that's
[1:06:36] not the hope of your glory that's the
[1:06:37] hope of all glory
[1:06:39] is resting on christ being in you
[1:06:41] finishing his ministry
[1:06:43] all glory is hinged on this a minute
[1:06:46] it's the hope of all glory is hinged on
[1:06:48] christ finishing his ministry in you
[1:06:57] let's turn to first john chapter 3.
[1:07:00] now remember
[1:07:02] the ministry of christ and the ministry
[1:07:04] of bride is the same ministry
[1:07:08] first john chapter
[1:07:12] 3. and verse 8
[1:07:19] first john 3 8 he that committeth sin is
[1:07:21] of the devil for the devil sinneth from
[1:07:23] the beginning
[1:07:24] for this purpose the son of god was
[1:07:26] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:07:28] works of the devil
[1:07:32] brother man says in spoken word is the
[1:07:34] original seed christ was manifested to
[1:07:36] destroy the works of the devil you
[1:07:37] believe that now i can't explain all
[1:07:39] this i'm just going to go through it
[1:07:40] just quickly now hit the high places so
[1:07:42] you won't stay too long christ was
[1:07:44] manifested to destroy the works of the
[1:07:46] devil is that right you all believe that
[1:07:48] all right what was he god's word which
[1:07:50] destroys the works of the hybrid the
[1:07:52] devil is that right
[1:07:54] he was done to do that he was born to be
[1:07:56] that to destroy the works of the devil
[1:07:58] now his body is to do the same
[1:08:02] why are you here to destroy the works of
[1:08:04] the devil
[1:08:05] how are you going to do it well you know
[1:08:08] i'm not real sure
[1:08:10] but if i can just yield to him and give
[1:08:12] him preeminence he can do it through me
[1:08:15] it's not the works that i do it's the
[1:08:17] work that he does through me amen i just
[1:08:19] got to stay yielded to him and he's
[1:08:21] going to destroy the devil amen through

[1:08:45] or who we're gonna run into but it's
[1:08:47] christ in us fulfilling that portion
[1:08:49] that he left for this day
[1:08:51] it has to happen it has to be fulfilled
[1:08:54] what is he looking for in this day he's

[1:09:04] do just lead me god so that i know and i
[1:09:06] will walk in your will
[1:09:10] amen
[1:09:15] jesus
[1:09:17] in his in his earthly ministry jesus had
[1:09:20] a theme to his ministry and the theme of
[1:09:22] his ministry was the kingdom of god is
[1:09:25] at hand
[1:09:27] this is the time for the fulfillment of
[1:09:28] the promise
[1:09:30] and the traditions of your fathers are
[1:09:32] dead and keeping you from it
[1:09:35] what's the bride's ministry

[1:09:38] the promise the kingdom of god is at
[1:09:40] hand amen christ is here and the
[1:09:43] traditions of the fathers are keeping
[1:09:44] you from it
[1:09:46] we're preaching the same message
[1:09:49] it's the same thing jesus come and says
[1:09:51] you by your traditions you make the
[1:09:53] gospel of none effect the bride is
[1:09:54] saying by the denominational traditions
[1:09:56] you're making the gospel of none effect
[1:09:59] jesus is saying the kingdom of god is a
[1:10:01] hand we're saying the kingdom of god is
[1:10:03] at hand

[1:10:11] traditional understanding and come to
[1:10:13] the word
[1:10:15] his ministry was was the word our
[1:10:17] ministry is the word amen but we're
[1:10:19] preaching the same thing friends
[1:10:23] the same exact message that jesus had is
[1:10:26] the same exact message that you and i
[1:10:27] have
[1:10:29] he he said this and he said that if you
[1:10:32] watch his ministry his ministry is the
[1:10:34] same
[1:10:36] that
[1:10:37] now is the hour for the fulfillment of
[1:10:40] the promise
[1:10:41] jesus knew it he knew amen he was
[1:10:44] standing there and in him was the
[1:10:46] fulfillment of the promised word for
[1:10:48] that day he knew it he was declaring it
[1:10:51] and he was telling the kingdom is come
[1:10:53] leave the traditions leave the
[1:10:55] misunderstandings and come to the word
[1:10:58] and now the bride has been awakened to
[1:10:59] who she is and she say the promise of
[1:11:02] the hour is fulfilled it's in flesh it's
[1:11:04] right here right now it's in me
[1:11:08] but leave the traditions leave the
[1:11:10] churches amen
[1:11:12] leave all of that thinking behind and
[1:11:14] come to the word for this day
[1:11:18] it's the same
[1:11:20] message
[1:11:26] john 13 3 says
[1:11:29] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:11:31] all things into his hand and that he was
[1:11:33] come from god and went to god
[1:11:36] i ask you is that same revelation come
[1:11:38] to you
[1:11:41] the ministry of christ amen in the
[1:11:43] ministry bride is the same ministry the
[1:11:45] revelation of who he was in the
[1:11:47] revelation of who you are lining up
[1:11:53] let's go to john chapter 6.
[1:12:09] john chapter 6 and verse 38
[1:12:16] for i come down from heaven
[1:12:18] not to do mine own will
[1:12:20] but the will of him that sent me
[1:12:23] can you say that
[1:12:25] i want that to be true every day in my
[1:12:27] life
[1:12:28] when i fail i fail this but i want to
[1:12:30] come back to it and say god i'm sorry
[1:12:32] this is my commission this is what i
[1:12:34] want to do if this was the commission of
[1:12:36] my husband it's my commission
[1:12:39] if this was the commission of jesus
[1:12:40] christ it's my commission as bride of
[1:12:43] christ
[1:12:44] for i come down from heaven not to do my
[1:12:47] own will but the will of him that sent
[1:12:48] me then go down to verse 42
[1:12:52] and they said is not this jesus the son
[1:12:54] of joseph whose father and mother we
[1:12:56] know how is it then that he saith i come
[1:12:58] down from heaven
[1:13:00] oh has anything
[1:13:02] changed you say i come from god i go to
[1:13:05] god i've come down from heaven for a
[1:13:07] purpose i'm part of a ministry of christ
[1:13:09] i'm here to do the will of the father
[1:13:11] and people look at you and say but i
[1:13:13] know where you were born i know your
[1:13:14] parents i knew the house you grew up in
[1:13:16] and i know all the mistakes you made as
[1:13:17] a kid it doesn't change anything i have
[1:13:20] come down from heaven due to the will of
[1:13:22] him that sent me i am here with a
[1:13:24] purpose i'm here under a commission and
[1:13:26] i'm here to help finish the ministry of
[1:13:28] jesus christ
[1:13:34] brother branham says in the fourth seal
[1:13:38] then god come down
[1:13:41] he come down to redeem those who would
[1:13:43] come down
[1:13:45] so god knew there would be those who
[1:13:47] were coming down
[1:13:49] are you one of those who come down
[1:13:51] have you come down to do the will of the
[1:13:53] one who sent you that's the reason
[1:13:55] you're sitting here that's the reason
[1:13:56] you're in this last day that's the
[1:13:58] reason you're in the body of flesh

[1:14:02] in you're in the church you're in you're
[1:14:04] in the year you're alive you're like you
[1:14:06] mean we look around and it's not been a
[1:14:08] blessing to live in 2020 and 2021.
[1:14:12] naturally speaking you look ahead and
[1:14:15] naturally speaking the blessings could
[1:14:17] be diminishing bit by bit the comforts
[1:14:19] and all the things that we knew as norms
[1:14:21] could be going away but i tell you i was
[1:14:23] placed here for this hour
[1:14:26] i come down from heaven not to do my
[1:14:28] will i didn't pick the year i was the
[1:14:30] year i come i didn't pick the time i
[1:14:32] would come to earth i come exactly
[1:14:35] according to his will and my will agrees
[1:14:37] with his will and i'm happy to be here
[1:14:42] amen
[1:14:44] why do you say that brother chad because
[1:14:46] i've said other things and i'm repenting
[1:14:47] right now
[1:14:50] i'm happy to be here i'm happy that i'm
[1:14:53] alive in 2021. i'm happy i'm here during
[1:14:56] a global pandemic when people are losing
[1:14:58] their minds i'm glad i can walk around
[1:15:01] in my right mind when everybody else is
[1:15:03] losing their mind
[1:15:05] because when else can a light shine any
[1:15:07] brighter amen and if things are going
[1:15:09] off into oblivion and this world is
[1:15:11] plunging in the chaos i say thank god
[1:15:13] for putting me here now not when times
[1:15:15] were good but when times are bad because
[1:15:17] somebody's going to listen to what i
[1:15:19] have to say
[1:15:21] the hour is becoming right friends amen
[1:15:24] the atmosphere is becoming perfect amen
[1:15:26] to spread the gospel to get the message
[1:15:29] out
[1:15:30] people have lost confidence in a
[1:15:32] government or a health system or
[1:15:34] anything else to give them any kind of
[1:15:35] help the security has the security rug
[1:15:38] has been pulled out from under the props
[1:15:40] are falling so fast and nobody knows
[1:15:42] what to do chaos is breaking down
[1:15:44] they're having riots all over the world
[1:15:49] riots because of lacks riots because of
[1:15:51] forced vaccination riots because of
[1:15:54] restrictions
[1:15:56] governments are losing control people
[1:15:58] are losing control
[1:16:01] the supply chain i mean
[1:16:04] we're supposed to live in america the
[1:16:05] wealthiest country in the world and
[1:16:07] there's bare thing bear sections and
[1:16:09] shelves because we can't get it off a
[1:16:11] boat and on a track and on the shelf
[1:16:15] it's it's
[1:16:16] you think
[1:16:17] there's so many systems in place
[1:16:20] there's so many we went for the brothers
[1:16:22] fellowship breakfast friday amen you
[1:16:24] went up to panera and it's locked
[1:16:26] because you can't go into panera because
[1:16:27] they don't have enough people to open a
[1:16:28] dining room it's like how can you not
[1:16:30] open your dining room you're a
[1:16:31] restaurant
[1:16:34] we were driving back from coming home
[1:16:37] from uh levi yoder's last sunday from
[1:16:39] the church service and you know
[1:16:41] everything in holmes county closes at 6
[1:16:43] 00 p.m on on sunday
[1:16:46] and we're hungry
[1:16:48] we're gonna start packing a lunch
[1:16:52] closed closed closed closed dining room
[1:16:54] clothes dining room clothes dining room
[1:16:55] clothes dining room clothes and i have
[1:16:57] an aversion to paying money and eating
[1:16:59] in my car
[1:17:01] i don't think it's right
[1:17:03] you charge me all this and i have to eat
[1:17:04] i want to at least eat and you clean up
[1:17:06] afterwards
[1:17:07] [Laughter]
[1:17:11] so we're driving along and everybody's
[1:17:13] looking on their phone and this is close
[1:17:15] this is close this is closed this is
[1:17:16] closed finally we go past a gas station
[1:17:18] with a subway
[1:17:21] that was the best subway sandwich i've
[1:17:23] ever ate in my life
[1:17:26] but their dining room was open because
[1:17:27] they didn't have a dining room they had
[1:17:28] a table in the corner of a gas station
[1:17:32] and you say how in the world are we here
[1:17:36] that we can't keep fast food restaurants
[1:17:38] open
[1:17:41] i mean something that should be like the
[1:17:43] staple of staples
[1:17:46] basics that have always been in place
[1:17:49] are not in place anymore
[1:17:52] systems that have always worked don't
[1:17:53] work anymore
[1:17:55] and you recognize they say well it's
[1:17:57] because of unemployment because of work
[1:17:58] stories and labor and blah blah blah i
[1:18:00] don't care what you say i say it's a
[1:18:02] spirit of chaos that has broke out
[1:18:04] it's a spiritual atmosphere you can try
[1:18:07] to pin it to any one thing you want to
[1:18:09] pin it to but it won't work because you
[1:18:11] can't pin it to any one thing it is
[1:18:13] because you leave the word you go to
[1:18:15] chaos you leave the word you go to chaos
[1:18:18] so there is a spirit of chaos that is
[1:18:20] working in the world
[1:18:23] and now the the country with all the
[1:18:25] systems the systems won't hold up
[1:18:27] anymore they're falling apart under the
[1:18:30] spirit of chaos
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:33] things are not what they used to be and
[1:18:36] they're i i believe they're going to
[1:18:37] continue to change i could be wrong
[1:18:40] though i don't know
[1:18:42] but if they continue to change and
[1:18:44] people get more scared and more
[1:18:46] frustrated and more hopeless and they
[1:18:47] believe they lose all confidence in
[1:18:49] anything in this world i'm telling you
[1:18:51] the gleaning will get better maybe
[1:18:56] and even if you can't find any more seed
[1:18:58] you ought to be able to find somebody
[1:19:00] that'll listen to you and say what
[1:19:01] you're saying sounds right to me it
[1:19:03] sounds like the truth i think it's right
[1:19:05] and they may not be predestinated seed
[1:19:07] but i'll tell you if they can show
[1:19:09] respect to the word of god to the living
[1:19:11] jesus christ and respect it and give
[1:19:13] honor to it and if they come through
[1:19:15] that gate amen in the new jerusalem i'm
[1:19:17] going to run up and hug him and thank
[1:19:19] him for coming and tell him it's good to
[1:19:20] see him
[1:19:23] the atmosphere is getting right
[1:19:26] when everything goes wrong
[1:19:31] you know the church has always
[1:19:32] flourished under persecution
[1:19:36] when when the apostle paul god
[1:19:40] i love god he has such a way of doing
[1:19:42] things
[1:19:43] he'll use the apostle paul to strike
[1:19:45] such a heavy blow in jerusalem
[1:19:47] that it scatters the disciples
[1:19:49] everywhere preaching the gospel
[1:19:52] and then after paul's done that he'll go
[1:19:54] and save paul
[1:19:58] because he's a good tool
[1:20:00] whether he's believing or not believing
[1:20:01] he's a good tool
[1:20:04] and then god will take him to go around
[1:20:06] and minister to all those groups you're
[1:20:07] spreading the word out
[1:20:11] because when when the atmosphere got
[1:20:13] right and the trouble came to jerusalem
[1:20:16] it was just god moving the word out
[1:20:20] it wasn't a problem it was perfect
[1:20:28] the the chaos that we're under is
[1:20:30] perfect
[1:20:32] it's only a problem if we let it be a
[1:20:34] problem
[1:20:37] you know what if i can't get my favorite
[1:20:41] whatever
[1:20:42] i'll get something else
[1:20:45] god will still feed me
[1:20:48] i can't get my favorite pop tart and
[1:20:50] that's just going to ruin my life
[1:20:56] i don't like black beans i want pinto
[1:20:57] beans no more black beans
[1:20:59] come on the atmosphere is getting
[1:21:01] perfect for spreading the gospel
[1:21:03] people are needing what you have just
[1:21:06] switch whatever your favorite brand is
[1:21:08] just which
[1:21:10] and say there's no problem
[1:21:13] everything's ticking right on time
[1:21:15] nothing's out of kilter with the plan of
[1:21:17] god we're moving into chaos so fast
[1:21:20] we're seeing tribulation systems set up
[1:21:22] so quickly
[1:21:25] all of these systems and the mind
[1:21:27] control and the fear-mongering and the
[1:21:29] controlling populations that do whatever
[1:21:31] the government wants them to do and
[1:21:33] mandates and blah blah blah blah blah
[1:21:35] and travel restrictions what is this
[1:21:37] this is all pre-tribulation set up
[1:21:42] and there's nothing in me that wants to
[1:21:44] fight it
[1:21:46] because when it goes in the full-blown
[1:21:48] tribulation i won't be here anyways to
[1:21:50] deal with it
[1:21:53] we have a promise amen we're watching it
[1:21:56] go that way why fight it you're fighting
[1:21:58] against god it's like peter telling
[1:22:00] jesus be it far from you that ever
[1:22:02] suffer like that jesus was telling him
[1:22:04] exactly what was going to happen to him
[1:22:06] to fulfill the plan of god and now god
[1:22:09] has told us what's going to happen he
[1:22:10] said the holocaust was foreshadowing
[1:22:12] what's coming
[1:22:15] and before you get to the holocaust you
[1:22:16] have a government that's clamping down
[1:22:18] becoming authoritarian taking control
[1:22:20] limiting certain people's rights and
[1:22:21] doing all of that stuff to move into the
[1:22:23] holocaust so that they could pull off
[1:22:25] what they pulled off then and that's
[1:22:26] foreshadowing another some more severe
[1:22:29] holocaust that's coming
[1:22:34] oh praise god
[1:22:38] and to fight it we'll begin to be
[1:22:41] fighting against prophecy
[1:22:47] i say let the world do whatever they
[1:22:48] have to do i'm going to do what he's
[1:22:50] called me to do
[1:22:52] my ministry is the word
[1:22:55] not bringing back rights
[1:22:59] my ministry is not to preserve
[1:23:01] constitutional rights
[1:23:04] that is not my ministry i'll get caught
[1:23:07] up chasing my tail and miss what the
[1:23:09] ministry really is
[1:23:12] our ministry is the word it's the
[1:23:14] ministry of jesus christ
[1:23:16] we've got to be careful we stay focused
[1:23:18] on what the ministry is
[1:23:21] and not chase a bunch of things that
[1:23:23] it's not
[1:23:26] i say
[1:23:28] the world's falling apart again
[1:23:31] the last time brother branham preached
[1:23:32] the world is falling apart he added that
[1:23:34] part the world is falling apart again
[1:23:36] and again
[1:23:38] and again
[1:23:39] and again
[1:23:40] and what is it it's a sign of our
[1:23:43] imminent departure
[1:23:46] so
[1:23:47] we have to fight
[1:23:49] the natural man who wants to be sad
[1:23:53] and discouraged
[1:23:55] and uncomfortable we have to fight that
[1:23:58] with what prophecy has told us in our
[1:24:00] day where we're at in time and what god
[1:24:03] is doing for us through us and to us
[1:24:07] and when we can keep ourselves focused
[1:24:09] on the prophecy that came through an
[1:24:10] endtime prophet then all of a sudden you
[1:24:12] realize
[1:24:13] everything is ticking right on time
[1:24:17] there's nothing to be upset about i've
[1:24:20] got to i've got a job to do till my last
[1:24:22] breath
[1:24:24] and that job
[1:24:25] is to finish the ministry that jesus
[1:24:27] left for this day
[1:24:30] praise god
[1:24:34] oh praise the lord
[1:24:38] let's look at luke chapter 4.
[1:24:54] so
[1:24:59] luke chapter 4 verse 16.
[1:25:03] and he came to nazareth where he had
[1:25:04] been brought up and as his custom was he
[1:25:06] went into the synagogue on the sabbath
[1:25:08] day and stood up for to read
[1:25:11] i'll go down to verse 20.
[1:25:13] and he closed the book and he gave it
[1:25:14] again to the minister and sat down and
[1:25:16] the eyes of all them that were in the
[1:25:18] synagogue were fastened on him
[1:25:20] and he began to say unto them this day
[1:25:23] is this scriptural fulfilled in your
[1:25:25] ears
[1:25:27] the bride can say the same thing
[1:25:30] go to revelation 19
[1:25:32] let us rejoice for the marriage of the
[1:25:35] lamb has come
[1:25:37] and his bride has made herself ready and
[1:25:40] you can look at somebody and read that
[1:25:41] to them and you can close the scroll and
[1:25:43] you can say this day this scripture is
[1:25:46] fulfilled
[1:25:49] it's the same it's a continuation of the
[1:25:51] same ministry
[1:25:53] is being fulfilled what is it it's
[1:25:55] christ amen it's not it's not you and i
[1:25:58] in our body of flesh that's just the
[1:26:00] vessel that it's contained inside of but
[1:26:02] it's the ministry of christ amen his
[1:26:04] spirit is now here in the bride
[1:26:06] finishing the work he left for this
[1:26:08] specific time
[1:26:10] let us be focused
[1:26:12] on that
[1:26:19] let's go to genesis
[1:26:20] chapter 3.
[1:26:37] genesis 3 and 14
[1:26:41] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[1:26:43] because thou has done this thou art
[1:26:45] cursed above all cattle
[1:26:47] and above every beast of the field upon
[1:26:49] thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt
[1:26:50] thou eat all the days of thy life
[1:26:53] and i'll put enmity between thee and the
[1:26:54] woman in between thy seed and her seed
[1:26:57] it shall bruise thy head and thou shall
[1:26:59] bruise his heel
[1:27:02] all the way back in genesis chapter 3
[1:27:04] there's a prophecy
[1:27:06] of the seed of the woman that will come
[1:27:07] forth and be the one that'll bruise the
[1:27:09] head of the serpent that prophecy was a
[1:27:11] prophecy of jesus christ all the way
[1:27:13] back in the fall amen when the judgments
[1:27:15] are given there's a prophecy laying
[1:27:17] there of the coming of jesus christ and
[1:27:19] what his ministry will be in his
[1:27:21] ministry he was he was made manifest to
[1:27:23] destroy the works of the devil he was
[1:27:25] the one who was going to bruise the
[1:27:27] serpent under his heel
[1:27:30] but let's go to romans 16.
[1:27:40] romans 16 and verse 20
[1:27:45] and the god of peace shall brew satan
[1:27:47] under your feet shortly
[1:27:51] what are we seeing
[1:27:52] the prophecy in genesis 3
[1:27:55] is fulfilled in jesus christ but it's
[1:27:58] still being fulfilled and the bride of
[1:28:00] christ
[1:28:01] because that prophecy was speaking of
[1:28:03] the woman's seed and that woman's seed
[1:28:05] is christ amen and christ as jesus
[1:28:07] christ amen he bruised his head when he
[1:28:10] went to calvary but now all the way in
[1:28:13] romans paul is telling us that the god
[1:28:15] of peace shall brew satan under your
[1:28:17] feet shortly and you're like i thought
[1:28:18] he was going to do it under christ's
[1:28:20] feet and the answer is yes he is
[1:28:22] christ male and female he didn't finish
[1:28:25] all his works in his earthly ministry he
[1:28:27] left a portion to finish now and he's
[1:28:29] doing it through the bride so god and
[1:28:31] then you've got to look at this you've
[1:28:33] got to look at this scripture because
[1:28:34] this scripture is taken so many times
[1:28:37] and there's an arrogancy and an attitude
[1:28:39] that comes with this amen we're going to
[1:28:41] be stomping on devils and i'm a devil
[1:28:43] stomper and all of this stuff no the the
[1:28:45] scripture never says that you're going
[1:28:47] to stop the devil
[1:28:49] does it say that right
[1:28:51] it doesn't say you're going to bruise
[1:28:52] the devil it said the god of peace will
[1:28:55] brew satan under your feet you're the
[1:28:57] tool in his hand you're the instrument
[1:28:59] that he's going to use but you're not
[1:29:01] going to be able to do it yourself your
[1:29:03] attitude your your your willpower your
[1:29:06] mental prowess your ability with
[1:29:08] scripture is not going to do anything
[1:29:09] it's you giving preeminence to christ
[1:29:12] and the god of peace will bruce satan
[1:29:14] under your feet shortly he's going to
[1:29:16] use you but it's got to be him doing it
[1:29:18] through you it can't be you you can't do
[1:29:22] it most people don't like that kind of
[1:29:25] preaching you can't do it you're not
[1:29:26] good enough
[1:29:28] you're nothing special
[1:29:30] [Applause]
[1:29:34] oh that kind of preaching would do us a
[1:29:36] whole lot better good than all this pump
[1:29:37] up pump up pump up you're everything
[1:29:39] you're special and
[1:29:42] in the flesh you're nothing in your mind
[1:29:45] you're falling amen you physically have
[1:29:48] no capabilities amen your mind has
[1:29:50] failed and flawed amen but if you
[1:29:53] through a new birth can have another
[1:29:54] life living inside of you and if the
[1:29:56] life of christ is living in you and you
[1:29:59] can stay surrendered to that then he can
[1:30:02] he can bruise the serpent he can save
[1:30:04] souls he can find the lost he can heal
[1:30:07] the sick
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:10] we've got to align the attitude and make
[1:30:12] the attitude right amen but if i'm just
[1:30:15] expecting him to do it without using
[1:30:17] this vessel and i'm not surrendering
[1:30:18] this vessel i want god to do god to do
[1:30:20] god to do wrong attitude
[1:30:22] if i'm not depending on him and i'll do
[1:30:24] i'll do all do wrong attitude but the
[1:30:26] right attitude is god i know you chose
[1:30:28] me and i know i came down amen to do
[1:30:31] your will
[1:30:33] i know that i am here and you've called
[1:30:35] me and there's a purpose in my life and
[1:30:37] i've come to this time and i've come to
[1:30:39] this age in this body of flesh i'm here
[1:30:42] for a reason but i can't do it without
[1:30:44] you and so i'm laying my life bare and
[1:30:46] i'm asking you to come and take control
[1:30:50] and then you see two opposing forces
[1:30:52] going into work negative and positive
[1:30:54] high pressure low pressure amen
[1:30:57] and then you see power
[1:31:03] so the prophecy in genesis 3 is still
[1:31:05] being fulfilled
[1:31:08] it's being fulfilled and a bride in the
[1:31:10] end time
[1:31:13] but it's not
[1:31:14] you it's him in you
[1:31:21] let's go to first john 4.
[1:31:27] friends whenever i see
[1:31:30] the bible calls an arrogant hateful
[1:31:33] attitude
[1:31:35] there's a wrong spirit there
[1:31:38] something's not right
[1:31:42] when i see the the word
[1:31:44] bring an absolute quiet confidence
[1:31:48] with a complete dependency on god
[1:31:51] i say that's somebody who's caught a
[1:31:53] revelation on the word
[1:31:54] they know who they are they know where
[1:31:56] they came from they know why they're
[1:31:57] here and they know who's the one who has
[1:31:59] to do the work
[1:32:01] that quiet steady confidence i know god
[1:32:04] will and i know he will because i know
[1:32:06] who i am
[1:32:08] to me that's right it can't be so humble
[1:32:11] it's useless
[1:32:14] i'm nothing i'm nobody never use me i
[1:32:17] mess up all the time i'm like please get
[1:32:20] a revelation of who you are because
[1:32:21] you're wearing me out
[1:32:28] but then that let me adam let me go i'll
[1:32:31] pray out i said oh please go somewhere
[1:32:34] else
[1:32:38] but when you find that person who by our
[1:32:39] revelation knows that they're a child of
[1:32:41] god
[1:32:42] they just know in the innermost knowing
[1:32:45] and the knowing and the down in the
[1:32:47] center of knowing they know they come
[1:32:49] from god and they know they're going
[1:32:50] back to god they know this word they
[1:32:52] hear as they truth they got something
[1:32:54] that tells them true true true true
[1:32:55] truth i know this prophet is true i know
[1:32:57] this is the end time i know
[1:33:01] and at the same time they know that
[1:33:02] without him i'm nothing because the vine
[1:33:05] can do nothing the branch can do nothing
[1:33:07] without the vine
[1:33:09] and you take those two things and put
[1:33:11] them together
[1:33:12] you have a positive and negative force
[1:33:14] that's going to move something into
[1:33:16] motion
[1:33:18] you'll see mountains move you'll see
[1:33:19] things
[1:33:20] change we have to know who we are
[1:33:25] but we have to know how incapable we are
[1:33:27] to do anything without his spirit
[1:33:30] and when we can put those two things
[1:33:32] together
[1:33:34] oh what amazing things will happen
[1:33:36] friends
[1:33:42] first john chapter 4.
[1:33:55] first john chapter 4 verse 17.
[1:33:58] hearing is our love made perfect that we
[1:34:00] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:34:02] i just want to ask you do you believe
[1:34:04] we're in the day of judgment
[1:34:06] we are in the day of judgment
[1:34:10] so we may have boldness in the day of
[1:34:12] judgment that means we have boldness in
[1:34:13] this day
[1:34:15] because as he is so are we
[1:34:18] in this world
[1:34:21] whatever he is we are
[1:34:24] in this world
[1:34:27] and when will we have that kind of
[1:34:29] boldness in the day of judgment
[1:34:33] hey
[1:34:34] read the newspaper
[1:34:36] we're in the day of judgment
[1:34:39] and we're to have this boldness
[1:34:41] in the day of judgment that as he is so
[1:34:43] are we
[1:34:44] in this world
[1:34:46] this is boldness not arrogance
[1:34:49] but boldness confidence in what he
[1:34:51] showed us confidence in what he's told
[1:34:53] us
[1:34:54] that's why
[1:34:56] moses when moses comes to the conflict
[1:34:58] with janus and jambers and he throws
[1:35:00] down his rod he just did exactly what
[1:35:03] god told him to do he stared standing on
[1:35:04] the word he went to pharaoh he threw
[1:35:06] down his rod and became a serpent
[1:35:08] he couldn't anticipate what was going to
[1:35:10] happen next what happened next is two
[1:35:12] others threw down their serpents
[1:35:16] and brother branham said he didn't get
[1:35:18] scared he just stood there because he
[1:35:20] did what god told him to do
[1:35:22] that's this boldness i'm talking about
[1:35:25] he wasn't yelling at janice and james he
[1:35:27] wouldn't say get your snakes out you
[1:35:28] have no right to do that i'm the only
[1:35:30] one
[1:35:32] he just did what god told him to do and
[1:35:33] he expected god to take care of the rest
[1:35:37] and here in a few minutes his snake ate
[1:35:39] up the other two snakes and god told him
[1:35:41] to pick it up and he picked it up and
[1:35:42] now he's carrying a rod with two snakes
[1:35:44] inside
[1:35:46] did he expect that i don't believe so
[1:35:48] did he know what was gonna happen i
[1:35:49] don't think he did did god show him i
[1:35:51] don't believe he did not the way the
[1:35:53] prophet explains it
[1:35:55] i believe the only thing he could do
[1:35:57] when he got there is have confidence of
[1:35:58] who he met in the burning bush
[1:36:01] and believe what the man what that voice
[1:36:03] in the burning bush told him and he
[1:36:05] comes and he stands and does exactly
[1:36:06] what god said i believe brother and
[1:36:08] sister that we are here because the
[1:36:10] pillar of fire has called us out as
[1:36:12] individuals and commissioned us in this
[1:36:14] day and told us what to do and if we can
[1:36:16] just have confidence in the one who
[1:36:17] spoke the voice behind the voice amen we
[1:36:20] can just stand here and no matter what
[1:36:22] happens it looks good it looks bad it
[1:36:24] looks like it's working it looks like
[1:36:26] it's not working just stand still and
[1:36:28] that boldness and be confident in the
[1:36:30] one who called you
[1:36:33] and watch god work
[1:36:39] i'm going to read
[1:36:41] a couple quotes here
[1:36:44] as we wind down
[1:36:47] in christ as the mystery of god riviera
[1:36:49] says when he comes
[1:36:50] when he come on earth he was the tree of
[1:36:52] life do you believe that
[1:36:54] and rome what did they do he had to be
[1:36:56] chopped down and he was put on a tree of
[1:36:58] disgrace cursed is he that hang on a
[1:37:01] tree
[1:37:02] became a curse for the human race
[1:37:04] and now through that he brings forth a
[1:37:06] bride tree which will be the tree of
[1:37:07] life restored back to him
[1:37:10] i want you to listen to that really
[1:37:12] close
[1:37:14] through that through him being chopped
[1:37:15] down he came as the tree of life they
[1:37:18] cut it down and hung it on a cross but
[1:37:20] through that
[1:37:22] he brings forth a bride tree
[1:37:24] which will be the tree of life restored
[1:37:27] back to him
[1:37:29] so what is the what's the bride tree to
[1:37:31] be
[1:37:31] the tree of life
[1:37:36] but i thought we were talking about the
[1:37:36] bride tree
[1:37:38] he is talking about the bride tree
[1:37:40] she will be the tree of life restored
[1:37:42] back to him
[1:37:44] as husband and wife in the garden of
[1:37:46] eden
[1:37:47] oh glory to god by the same word and the
[1:37:49] same god made manifest in husband and
[1:37:52] wife the same bride tree
[1:37:54] back again
[1:37:56] in 1962 in the messenger uncertain sound
[1:37:58] he says now
[1:37:59] it was about a thousand years there
[1:38:01] there was nothing but a stump but you
[1:38:03] cannot because the life of the trees
[1:38:05] predestinated to bring forth a tree up
[1:38:08] come luther started it growing what did
[1:38:10] it do organized the husband and pruned
[1:38:11] the branches come up into methodist what
[1:38:14] did it do organized just like the mother
[1:38:16] prune the branches come one up in the
[1:38:18] pentecostals that done the same thing
[1:38:19] organize god's prune the branches but
[1:38:22] that life in the heart of that tree has
[1:38:24] to live god said i will restore for the
[1:38:27] evening lights to ripen the middle of
[1:38:29] that tree stands the heart of god that's
[1:38:31] the bride true tree to meet the
[1:38:33] bridegroom tree just like was in the
[1:38:35] garden of eden originally the tree the
[1:38:38] two trees of life
[1:38:44] when when god gave adam his commission
[1:38:47] amen there was there there was his wife
[1:38:51] with him
[1:38:53] and they received that commission
[1:38:55] together
[1:38:56] and god would take him and put him in
[1:38:58] flesh and then he would separate that
[1:39:00] flesh and separate that spirit and he
[1:39:02] would it would bring out of adam the
[1:39:05] wife the bride and he would unite the
[1:39:07] two back together and the two back
[1:39:09] together was to continue the commission
[1:39:11] he received when they were together in
[1:39:12] the spirit
[1:39:16] and the same thing is true of christ and
[1:39:17] his bride
[1:39:20] she's been separated out into another
[1:39:22] manifestation but in this other
[1:39:24] manifestation it's really him in her
[1:39:27] it's a continuation of his life
[1:39:32] and he says this restoration of the
[1:39:33] bride tree
[1:39:35] to meet the bridegroom tree
[1:39:38] just like it was in the garden of eden
[1:39:39] originally the tree the two trees
[1:39:42] of life
[1:39:45] he says in the restoration of the bright
[1:39:46] tree from 62 he says otherwise you're
[1:39:49] going to form what's known to me as a
[1:39:51] bride see all right i'll go with you and
[1:39:55] you will be a part of me you will be my
[1:39:57] bride my life will be in your body just
[1:39:59] like husband and wife as one person you
[1:40:01] and i are going to be one
[1:40:03] at that day you'll know that i am in the
[1:40:05] father the father and me i in you and
[1:40:07] you and me
[1:40:08] oh i just love that
[1:40:10] satan just gets so angry at that seed
[1:40:12] the oneness of god
[1:40:18] brother madam is talking about the
[1:40:19] restoration of the bride tree and he's
[1:40:21] saying first before he gets to that he
[1:40:23] says the husband and wife are going to
[1:40:25] be one person
[1:40:26] just like in eden
[1:40:29] and when they come to this union to this
[1:40:31] one person it'll be my life and you
[1:40:33] amen in that day you're going to know
[1:40:36] that i am in the father the father and
[1:40:38] me i in you and you and me oh satan gets
[1:40:41] so angry about that what is getting what
[1:40:44] is satan getting so angry about that you
[1:40:46] recognizing who you really are and where
[1:40:49] you came from and what is actually going
[1:40:51] on on the inside of you
[1:40:53] satan wants to keep us in spiritual
[1:40:55] amnesia he wants to keep us in lao to
[1:40:57] see in thinking he wants us to think
[1:40:59] cardinal feel carnal be troubled by
[1:41:01] carnal things he does not want us to go
[1:41:03] deeper and recognize who we really are
[1:41:06] down in the soul amen that seat on the
[1:41:09] inside
[1:41:10] he wants us to keep looking back at a
[1:41:12] birth certificate
[1:41:13] and an employment record and a home
[1:41:16] but that's not who we are the seed is
[1:41:19] who we are the seed has come to life
[1:41:21] that's the true you that's the one who
[1:41:22] is meant to be you from before the
[1:41:24] foundation of the world
[1:41:27] that's who god is identifying and that's
[1:41:29] who god is looking to
[1:41:34] he says
[1:41:35] satan gets so angry about that
[1:41:39] see the oneness of god
[1:41:41] what oneness of god
[1:41:43] because he was a father he had to become
[1:41:46] a son of man
[1:41:50] which one was god
[1:41:55] it's the oneness of god expressed in
[1:41:57] different different expressions
[1:42:00] because he was a father he had to become
[1:42:03] a son of man
[1:42:05] because in the son of man expression he
[1:42:07] expresses the father
[1:42:10] what's this the oneness of god was not
[1:42:12] the way i thought oneness would look
[1:42:16] and because he's a bridegroom
[1:42:20] he's going to have to become a bride
[1:42:24] and satan does not like you to know this
[1:42:28] he wants you to think that you're a poor
[1:42:30] old person who was born by some parents
[1:42:32] and you lived in this life and he was
[1:42:34] pitiful and and god he felt sorry for
[1:42:37] you
[1:42:38] because he saw your pitiful condition
[1:42:40] and lost and wayward and god felt sorry
[1:42:42] for you and because he felt sorry for
[1:42:44] you one day come along and he gave you
[1:42:46] an opportunity and and because you were
[1:42:48] pitiful you took him up and said yeah
[1:42:50] i'll take that and god brings you up and
[1:42:52] washed you off he felt sorry for you and
[1:42:54] and now he brings you into the kingdom
[1:42:56] and now you're lucky to be here
[1:43:00] that's what the devil wants you to think
[1:43:04] that's the way the denominations preach
[1:43:06] the gospel amen so that you're always
[1:43:08] that you're always this poor pitiful
[1:43:11] thing that was lifted up and and brought
[1:43:13] over and and and i i'm so grateful and
[1:43:16] thankful and then at some point i could
[1:43:18] always fall away and and it's always
[1:43:19] dependent on
[1:43:21] on on
[1:43:22] whatever
[1:43:24] so i got to keep doing good and i kept
[1:43:26] being good and i got to keep i got to
[1:43:28] keep going to church and i got to keep
[1:43:30] doing all these things because i barely
[1:43:32] made it and i was just this pitiful
[1:43:33] thing i was just there's nothing nobody
[1:43:35] wanted this cast away and jesus come and
[1:43:37] took me and i'm so grateful and i better
[1:43:39] be careful
[1:43:41] but in this day what god wants us to
[1:43:43] recognize is you were always the son of
[1:43:45] god
[1:43:46] before you come to this earth or you son
[1:43:48] of god in every condition you were a son
[1:43:50] of god and at some point he come to wake
[1:43:53] up the sun that was on the inside and so
[1:43:55] you could recognize where you came from
[1:43:57] who you are where you're going and what
[1:43:58] your purpose is because your purpose is
[1:44:01] to destroy the works of the devil
[1:44:04] and he doesn't want to be destroyed
[1:44:09] so he'll paint a picture
[1:44:12] and call it the gospel that's not the
[1:44:14] gospel
[1:44:20] so he said satan just gets so angry at
[1:44:22] that see the oneness of god all that god
[1:44:24] was he poured into christ
[1:44:26] and all that christ was he poured into
[1:44:28] the church there you are
[1:44:30] makes them all one
[1:44:34] look the bride are one tree of life
[1:44:37] other words like husband and wife as one
[1:44:40] christ and his bride are one
[1:44:43] same thing same spirit same works same
[1:44:45] signs everything else for the works that
[1:44:47] i do shall you do also how long all the
[1:44:48] world how much to every creature is that
[1:44:51] right
[1:44:54] now in investments he says this is 1963
[1:44:56] an investment he says
[1:44:58] and that great tree that great tree of
[1:45:00] life when he come to earth they chopped
[1:45:02] it down by a roman spear and hung it on
[1:45:03] a roman tree a cruel cursed tree but in
[1:45:06] there he redeemed a bride tree
[1:45:08] the bride tree one just like him
[1:45:12] that eve tree from the garden of eden
[1:45:13] the tree that had fallen eve in the
[1:45:16] beginning and adam walked out with her
[1:45:17] now adam comes the second adam knowing
[1:45:20] that he had that he had his eyes opened
[1:45:23] to receive his eve
[1:45:25] so there was two trees in the garden of
[1:45:27] eden and brother bam said there's two
[1:45:29] trees were the tree of life
[1:45:31] and the eve tree fell and caused adam to
[1:45:34] come with her
[1:45:35] but now there was a restoration of the
[1:45:38] bridegroom tree
[1:45:39] and that bragram tree was cut down and
[1:45:41] out of that amenity hung across out of
[1:45:43] that would come a bride tree and that
[1:45:46] bride tree would be the tree of life
[1:45:47] restored back to him again as husband
[1:45:49] and wife
[1:45:51] let's go to revelation 22.
[1:45:56] this is not new to us but i want to
[1:45:57] review it right now while we're here
[1:46:00] revelation 22
[1:46:02] is a picture of the of the city of god
[1:46:05] with the throne of god
[1:46:07] and 22 is going to be describing the
[1:46:09] river of life and
[1:46:11] in chapter 22 verse 1 and he showed me a
[1:46:14] pure river of water of life clear as
[1:46:17] crystal proceeding out of the throne of
[1:46:19] god and of the lamb
[1:46:20] and in the midst of the street of it and
[1:46:22] on either side of the river catch that
[1:46:24] word either
[1:46:27] and on either side of the river was
[1:46:29] there the tree of life which bear 12
[1:46:32] manner of fruits and yielded her fruit
[1:46:36] her fruit every month and the leaves of
[1:46:38] the tree refer the healing of the
[1:46:40] nations so now we're talking about the
[1:46:43] tree of life amen in the new jerusalem
[1:46:45] and there's a river of life flowing down
[1:46:47] from the throne of god and on either
[1:46:50] side of this river of life is the tree
[1:46:52] of life so if the river of life is
[1:46:54] flowing right down through the center of
[1:46:56] this church on this side is the tree of
[1:46:58] life
[1:46:59] that right
[1:47:01] and on this side is the tree of life
[1:47:06] when you look as a human being you would
[1:47:07] look at that saying that's two trees but
[1:47:09] the scriptures called it the tree of
[1:47:11] life
[1:47:12] it's one tree amen because if you go
[1:47:15] down under the river of life there's one
[1:47:18] root ball there's one origin there's one
[1:47:20] beginning and out of that first amen
[1:47:22] what we've seen through the gospels is
[1:47:24] one side comes the restoration of the
[1:47:26] tree of life the bridegroom trees come
[1:47:28] up amen and then on the other side comes
[1:47:31] the bride tree amen and they were linked
[1:47:33] all the way back before the foundation
[1:47:35] of the world amen and they've come up
[1:47:37] and it looks like two separate creations
[1:47:39] but it's two of the same thing
[1:47:43] and then they grow together in the
[1:47:45] canopy and come back together where you
[1:47:46] can hardly distinguish the two again the
[1:47:49] two become one at the end of time
[1:47:52] a root ball underneath two trees coming
[1:47:55] up which is one tree and two
[1:47:57] manifestations growing back together at
[1:47:59] the top and what's coming right out of
[1:48:02] the middle of this tree is the there's
[1:48:04] the water of life the river of life life
[1:48:07] is coming from the tree of life
[1:48:10] male and female coming together tree of
[1:48:13] life her
[1:48:15] her fruit
[1:48:19] she yields 12 manner of fruit her fruit
[1:48:23] and the leaves of this tree
[1:48:26] are for the healing of the nations
[1:48:30] you know what brother bam called you as
[1:48:31] a believer he said you're a leaf on that
[1:48:33] tree of life
[1:48:35] you're here for the healing of the
[1:48:36] nations
[1:48:38] because those who come
[1:48:40] amen to that city from outside the city
[1:48:42] are not elect predestinated seed there
[1:48:45] are people who were granted entrance
[1:48:46] into eternal life with the white throne
[1:48:47] judgment and some of them were granted
[1:48:50] interest because of how they treated the
[1:48:51] word when it was in bride form
[1:48:56] why
[1:48:57] because you're a leaf on the tree of
[1:49:00] life
[1:49:01] and the bride is the restored tree of
[1:49:03] life
[1:49:05] and when they when they come to you now
[1:49:08] as the tree of life and they receive a
[1:49:10] leaf from you now
[1:49:13] it'll give them a right to receive a
[1:49:15] leaf from the tree of life in that city
[1:49:18] god keeps everything in continuity
[1:49:20] friends it's the same whether it's the
[1:49:22] big picture or the macro uh a picture or
[1:49:24] the micro picture it's the same thing
[1:49:26] over and over and over again what
[1:49:28] happened in eden we see all the way here
[1:49:30] in revelation 22 those two trees grow
[1:49:32] back together again a restoration of the
[1:49:34] tree of life
[1:49:37] as male
[1:49:38] and female
[1:49:42] and from between them
[1:49:44] those two manifestations or maybe out of
[1:49:47] their belly
[1:49:49] will flow a river of living water
[1:49:52] the scripture keeps telling us the same
[1:49:54] thing over and over
[1:49:56] and over again
[1:49:58] life comes from the body
[1:50:04] we're not here
[1:50:06] we're not here
[1:50:08] for what most people think we're here
[1:50:10] for
[1:50:12] our 70 80 90 years on this earth is not
[1:50:16] it really isn't for what most people
[1:50:18] spend all their lives trying to achieve
[1:50:22] but we're really here
[1:50:25] to receive life
[1:50:27] and give the opportunity to receive life
[1:50:32] we're here for life
[1:50:34] that's why we're here
[1:50:36] we're here to receive his life
[1:50:38] and we're here to dispense his life
[1:50:43] and if we don't keep that in focus
[1:50:46] we'll get frustrated about the stock
[1:50:47] market
[1:50:49] we'll get bent out of shape about gas
[1:50:50] prices
[1:50:52] we will lose our minds when we can no
[1:50:54] longer get our favorite product in the
[1:50:56] store
[1:50:57] but if we keep in focus that we're here
[1:51:00] for life
[1:51:02] to dispense life
[1:51:04] to be a leaf on the tree of life
[1:51:06] to be the bride tree the tree of life
[1:51:09] restored back to the bridegroom tree
[1:51:10] again
[1:51:13] if we keep our focus on that
[1:51:15] if gas goes to ten dollars a gallon
[1:51:19] he'll either give me money for gas or
[1:51:21] he'll give me strength in my legs to
[1:51:22] pedal the bike
[1:51:26] but it's not going to change why i'm
[1:51:28] here
[1:51:30] it's not going to change my purpose it's
[1:51:32] not going to change whose hand i'm in
[1:51:33] it's not going to change anything about
[1:51:35] my life if anything things are about to
[1:51:37] get more exciting friends
[1:51:42] because you're going to have people all
[1:51:43] around you who want answers
[1:51:46] there's going to be people all around
[1:51:47] you who want to know what is going on
[1:51:49] why does this collapse why is the world
[1:51:51] falling apart what's going to happen and
[1:51:53] you can say i know why the world's
[1:51:55] falling apart
[1:51:57] and they can say what is this because
[1:52:00] eve wouldn't obey all the word amen
[1:52:02] she disobeyed all the way back in the
[1:52:04] garden of eden amen and she committed
[1:52:07] adultery with a being called the serpent
[1:52:09] and brought a hybridization into mankind
[1:52:11] and god had to come and shed his own
[1:52:12] blood because the blood of man was
[1:52:14] polluted amen and when he shed his own
[1:52:16] blood to restore us back to everything
[1:52:18] we lost but the rejection of that will
[1:52:20] send us into chaos like it was when they
[1:52:22] fell in the beginning
[1:52:27] and you know what
[1:52:30] you'd be like somebody could say that
[1:52:32] sounds crazy
[1:52:34] but i've had people send me conspiracy
[1:52:37] theories on what's going on with the
[1:52:38] vaccine and what's going on in the
[1:52:40] government
[1:52:41] and what i said makes more sense than
[1:52:43] anything those conspiracy theories and
[1:52:45] people are out there watching that by
[1:52:46] droves and believing that if to believe
[1:52:48] that why won't we try the truth amen
[1:52:51] why don't we just try the truths amen
[1:52:53] they're going to believe in all kinds of
[1:52:55] of weird societies and few people
[1:52:58] controlling the governments of the world
[1:53:00] and they drink blood out of a human
[1:53:01] skull and they
[1:53:05] why waste your time watching that
[1:53:06] nonsense we already know what it is
[1:53:10] it's a spirit it's an antichrist spirit
[1:53:12] it was working in heaven it was working
[1:53:15] in eden it's working now
[1:53:18] the world is under a spirit of chaos
[1:53:20] amen because they've rejected the word
[1:53:25] so you've got people at your work amen
[1:53:27] that'll get on youtube and they'll watch
[1:53:29] a conspiracy theory that is absolutely
[1:53:31] ludicrous
[1:53:35] so if they'll listen to that just give
[1:53:37] them the word amen it's
[1:53:39] it doesn't sound any weirder than what
[1:53:40] they've been listening to
[1:53:44] that's nothing but the truth
[1:53:47] they're searching for answers and
[1:53:49] they're willing to grab ahold of any
[1:53:51] nonsense to try to make sense of what
[1:53:52] they're seeing because what they're
[1:53:53] seeing no longer makes sense
[1:53:56] but listen friends you know the
[1:53:58] conspiracy theory
[1:54:00] it was the conspiracy that started in
[1:54:02] heaven
[1:54:04] that conspiracy has spilled down the
[1:54:06] earth and that conspiracy continues on
[1:54:07] today but you've got the secret amen
[1:54:10] you've been you've been in the bed
[1:54:12] chamber of the king of darkness you know
[1:54:14] his plans and you know what he's doing
[1:54:16] and you know how he comes as a white
[1:54:18] horse and then on a red horse then on
[1:54:19] the black and then the pale horse rise
[1:54:21] of it all you know his game plan you
[1:54:22] know his tactics you know how he works
[1:54:24] cause the seals unfolded the whole plan
[1:54:27] you already know the conspiracy you
[1:54:29] don't need a youtube channel you don't
[1:54:31] need a video you know exactly what's
[1:54:33] going on
[1:54:36] so if somebody sells you some nonsense

[1:54:40] me try this one on you
[1:54:45] and no matter what he says yours is no
[1:54:48] more different sounding than his is
[1:54:51] only yours is true
[1:54:54] and somebody just might believe it
[1:54:59] praise god
[1:55:02] i love god i love his word
[1:55:06] it unravels our foolishness
[1:55:08] as human beings our childishness
[1:55:11] it unravels the whole thing

[1:55:16] stick with it
[1:55:18] he's given us the revelation of the word
[1:55:20] he's opened the seals to show us the
[1:55:22] plan of satan let's stick with that and
[1:55:25] let's say that
[1:55:32] i'm gonna read this next quote
[1:55:36] in the restoration of the bride tree
[1:55:41] the bridegroom tree without the female
[1:55:44] don't bear fruit
[1:55:46] so he's got to have a bride tree
[1:55:49] she has got to be born the same material
[1:55:51] the word made flesh
[1:55:52] in the tree
[1:55:54] hope you get that it's the same life in
[1:55:56] this female tree the bridegroom as it
[1:55:57] was in the bride the works that i do
[1:55:59] shall you do also is that right
[1:56:02] amen
[1:56:04] let's go to second corinthians
[1:56:07] almost done i just want to read a couple
[1:56:09] more scriptures
[1:56:17] second corinthians chapter five
[1:56:30] second corinthians 5 17
[1:56:38] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[1:56:40] a new creature old things are passed
[1:56:42] away behold all things are new
[1:56:44] and all things are of god who hath
[1:56:46] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[1:56:48] and have given to us the ministry of
[1:56:51] reconciliation
[1:56:53] so god has reconciled us to himself by
[1:56:55] the minister of jesus christ and given
[1:56:57] to us the ministry of reconciliation
[1:56:59] that's why he said we received right
[1:57:01] life now we dispense life he's given to
[1:57:03] us through jesus christ reconciliation
[1:57:05] now he's given us the ministry of
[1:57:06] reconciliation
[1:57:08] to reconcile others we were reconciled
[1:57:10] so we can reconcile
[1:57:12] we were given life so we can give life
[1:57:16] 19
[1:57:18] to wit that god was in christ
[1:57:19] reconciling the world unto himself
[1:57:22] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[1:57:24] and hath committed unto us
[1:57:26] the word of reconciliation
[1:57:29] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[1:57:31] as though god did beseech you by us
[1:57:34] he's saying god is calling to you right
[1:57:36] now
[1:57:37] through us
[1:57:39] god is beseeching you he's given the
[1:57:41] word of reconciliation to us we're
[1:57:42] ambassadors for christ and we're we're
[1:57:45] god is he is beseeching you by us
[1:57:49] we pray you in christ's dead that means
[1:57:52] in place of christ
[1:57:55] to be reconciled to god
[1:57:58] paul is saying
[1:58:01] we are god speaking to you
[1:58:03] and we are here in the place of christ
[1:58:06] telling you to be reconciled to god
[1:58:09] what is that the ministry of christ in
[1:58:11] you
[1:58:13] this is what we're on earth for this is
[1:58:14] why we're here

[1:58:42] second thessalonians
[1:58:45] 2 and 7.
[1:58:47] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:58:49] work
[1:58:50] only who and now letteth will let
[1:58:53] until he be taken out of the way
[1:58:55] this word let means to hold back
[1:58:58] so the mystery of iniquity
[1:59:00] does already work only it's being held
[1:59:03] back
[1:59:05] it's being resisted it's being it's
[1:59:08] being pushed back
[1:59:10] amen
[1:59:11] it's being pushed back until
[1:59:14] he be taken out of the way so it and
[1:59:16] only he who now letteth will let until
[1:59:18] he be taken out of the way so the
[1:59:20] mystery of iniquity is working but it's
[1:59:22] being restricted it's being inhibited by
[1:59:24] something it's being inhibited by the
[1:59:26] one who now led us
[1:59:29] and he who lives will now let tell he be
[1:59:31] taken out of the way but i want you to
[1:59:33] listen to how brother branham reads this
[1:59:34] scripture in the first seal in this in
[1:59:37] your seals book he says for the mystery
[1:59:39] of iniquity death already worked
[1:59:40] deceivers you see deceiving the people
[1:59:42] off into something see only he god
[1:59:46] that letteth will let until he the
[1:59:49] church christ the bride be taken out of
[1:59:51] the way
[1:59:53] who's he
[1:59:55] it's he god it's he the bride
[1:59:58] [Music]
[2:00:00] he's the one who's resisting he's the
[2:00:02] one who's holding it back amen that
[2:00:03] full-blown beast thing can't break into
[2:00:05] full power until the bride gets out of
[2:00:07] the way she's now letting it she's now
[2:00:10] holding it back who's holding it back he
[2:00:13] is
[2:00:14] until he the church christ the bride be
[2:00:17] taken out of the way amen as long as
[2:00:20] you're here you're holding that thing in
[2:00:22] check amen you're keeping it can only go
[2:00:24] so far amen but when god is done
[2:00:27] redeeming the last one that he can
[2:00:28] redeem when everything is finished he's
[2:00:30] going to take it out of the way
[2:00:34] and nothing will resist that
[2:00:36] antichrist spirit then the spirit of
[2:00:37] iniquity
[2:00:40] who's he
[2:00:41] where is he
[2:00:43] till he
[2:00:44] brother ben said the church
[2:00:46] christ
[2:00:47] the bride
[2:00:50] it's not you
[2:00:51] getting on a facebook forum and typing
[2:00:54] and holding back the devil
[2:00:57] it's not you calling up some government
[2:00:59] officials it's not you holding it back
[2:01:02] it's him in you that's holding it back
[2:01:05] the spirit that is in the bride is
[2:01:07] holding that thing in check till god can
[2:01:09] finish doing what all he has to do and
[2:01:11] then now he'll take it all up amen and
[2:01:14] when the spirit goes up that life goes
[2:01:16] with it because the the tree of life is
[2:01:18] taken
[2:01:20] back and then the spirit of iniquity
[2:01:23] breaks out
[2:01:27] i say while i'm here
[2:01:30] i want to be imploring you in god's dead
[2:01:34] i want to be speaking to you in christ
[2:01:35] said be reconciled to god
[2:01:38] i want to be here doing what i'm here to
[2:01:41] do until he takes me out of the way
[2:01:43] but i don't want to stop until he takes
[2:01:46] me out of the way
[2:01:47] i don't want to quit giving leaves off
[2:01:50] of the tree of life
[2:01:52] i don't want to quit giving an
[2:01:53] opportunity for somebody to come and
[2:01:55] drink of the water of life that's why
[2:01:57] all the way at the end of revelation 22
[2:01:59] you say the spirit and the bride say
[2:02:01] come
[2:02:02] let him as thirsty come and drink of the
[2:02:04] water of life freely i want to be giving
[2:02:06] that call as long as i'm here
[2:02:09] for somebody to come and drink
[2:02:12] brother brandon said in christ is the
[2:02:14] mystery of god revealed he said the
[2:02:15] church is the blood of christ by the
[2:02:17] spirit
[2:02:18] because the life is in the blood
[2:02:21] that's the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:02:23] that baptizes us into his body that
[2:02:25] recognizes only his body his flesh
[2:02:28] his word
[2:02:30] as long as she is here and he's with her
[2:02:32] that life of that blood is here
[2:02:35] as long as that life of that blood is
[2:02:37] here amen something is letting the
[2:02:39] spirit of iniquity
[2:02:42] but when it all goes
[2:02:47] i said god help me to be a clear voice
[2:02:49] until that time
[2:02:50] help me not to slack off lord help me
[2:02:52] not to get lazy help me not to get
[2:02:54] self-focused self-absorbed worried about
[2:02:56] self but help me to realize i've only
[2:02:58] got a few years to do what you put me on
[2:03:00] this earth to do and i want to be found
[2:03:02] faithful
[2:03:06] let's turn to proverbs 11.
[2:03:09] i want to finish with this musicians if
[2:03:10] you could come please
[2:03:12] brother ben if you make your way up
[2:03:15] i want to finish with this scripture
[2:03:18] proverbs chapter 11.
[2:03:30] proverbs 11 and verse 30.
[2:03:35] proverbs 11 and 30
[2:03:37] the fruit of the righteous
[2:03:39] is a tree of life
[2:03:41] and he that went with souls is wise
[2:03:44] praise god
[2:03:48] how do you bear fruit the bridegroom
[2:03:50] can't bear fruit without the bride
[2:03:53] the bridegroom can't bear fruit without
[2:03:55] the bride tree
[2:03:57] but when the two come together
[2:03:59] she can yield her fruit
[2:04:01] and the fruit of the righteous
[2:04:03] is a tree of life
[2:04:06] the fruits that you bear which is the
[2:04:07] life of christ in you when you and
[2:04:09] christ come together
[2:04:10] it bears fruit
[2:04:12] and the fruit that you bear
[2:04:14] is a tree of life
[2:04:16] somebody can see that fruit of
[2:04:17] righteousness
[2:04:19] somebody could be attracted to the life
[2:04:21] of god
[2:04:22] i say god
[2:04:24] help us to stay faithful
[2:04:26] let's all stand
[2:04:36] i have no idea what will happen next
[2:04:39] some of the conspiracy theories might be
[2:04:41] true
[2:04:41] they might be wrong they might be
[2:04:43] partially true i have no idea
[2:04:46] but
[2:04:47] it really doesn't matter
[2:04:49] to me
[2:04:51] that's one thing i've never understood
[2:04:53] how
[2:04:54] knowing what the illuminati is doing
[2:04:56] will change my life in one drop because
[2:04:58] i have no power to change it
[2:05:00] so if i figured out what the illuminati
[2:05:01] is doing next what does it matter
[2:05:05] how am i going to change it
[2:05:07] they're going to do it anyways and then
[2:05:09] i can say i knew they were going to do
[2:05:10] that what does it matter
[2:05:12] you're still under the effects of it
[2:05:15] so why worry about that i know what
[2:05:17] god's doing in this day and that's what
[2:05:19] really matters
[2:05:21] i know where life is and i know where
[2:05:22] the fountain of life is and i know where
[2:05:24] the tree of life is and i know where you
[2:05:26] can go to get fruit off of that tree and
[2:05:27] i know where there's leaves amen off of
[2:05:29] that tree i know where there's an
[2:05:30] opportunity to come in contact with
[2:05:32] jesus christ i know where the source is
[2:05:34] i know where christ's ministry is and i
[2:05:36] know what to bring people to i know
[2:05:38] where i'm standing in the in the water
[2:05:40] of life and i can say to somebody come
[2:05:42] come come to where i'm at because i'm
[2:05:44] drinking from this water of life and you
[2:05:46] can drink too amen if you'll just get
[2:05:49] rid of all of your old understanding and
[2:05:51] drop all of the traditions of the
[2:05:52] fathers and come to the fountain of life
[2:05:54] and drink
[2:05:57] it doesn't matter if you figured out
[2:05:59] what biden's going to do next it doesn't
[2:06:01] matter i'm telling you friends it does
[2:06:03] not matter if you can figure out who's
[2:06:05] really pulling the strings in the white
[2:06:07] house and who's really in control who
[2:06:09] cares i know who's in control of the
[2:06:11] whole thing there's another layer over
[2:06:13] that and another layer over that and
[2:06:15] when you go to the top that's my father
[2:06:17] amen
[2:06:18] [Applause]
[2:06:19] and the prophet told me ed nothing's out
[2:06:22] of cater everything's ticking just right
[2:06:24] on time so why am i wasting all my time
[2:06:26] figuring out what the white house is
[2:06:28] going to do and what the senate is going
[2:06:29] to do and what they're doing in europe i
[2:06:32] don't care my commission is to give life
[2:06:35] amen my commission is to call to the
[2:06:37] water of life i am standing here in
[2:06:40] christ dead bidding you to be reconciled
[2:06:42] to god because we've been given a word
[2:06:45] of reconciliation
[2:06:48] let's not get distracted friends
[2:06:51] it could get crazier yet
[2:06:57] the world is falling apart again
[2:06:59] i've said this before or could get more
[2:07:01] normal
[2:07:02] and then crazier
[2:07:04] who knows i don't know i'm not in the
[2:07:06] business of predicting
[2:07:08] but one thing i know for sure
[2:07:11] is god has given us a word of
[2:07:12] reconciliation
[2:07:14] and a ministry of reconciliation
[2:07:17] and that's what my whole life needs to
[2:07:18] be focused on
[2:07:20] that's what we need to be given over to
[2:07:22] and if we'll be doing that regardless of

[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:11:35] [Laughter]
[2:11:38] i'd just like to share one more thought
[2:11:42] when the disciples went into the upper
[2:11:44] room before the feast of pentecost
[2:11:48] they were fearful
[2:11:50] uncertain what would happen next didn't
[2:11:52] know what to do or how to do it
[2:11:54] they were fishermen
[2:11:56] tax collector
[2:11:58] women
[2:12:00] all kinds of different
[2:12:01] if we would know what all they were it
[2:12:03] would be interesting to know where all
[2:12:04] they came from and what they were
[2:12:07] they were fearful of the authorities and
[2:12:10] uncertain of what would happen next
[2:12:13] but after they received that life that
[2:12:15] was promised to come
[2:12:17] in the baptism the holy ghost and they
[2:12:18] were quick in the life they ran out and
[2:12:21] began to preach and peter stands up to
[2:12:23] preach the gospel and begins quoting the
[2:12:25] scripture
[2:12:26] and peter never apologizes
[2:12:29] for who he is
[2:12:32] peter doesn't say now uh i i know you
[2:12:34] probably expected somebody else to be
[2:12:36] the spokesman i i did too
[2:12:39] i'm nothing
[2:12:40] he was so excited about what he had he
[2:12:43] just gave it out amen he wasn't looking
[2:12:45] at himself he wasn't apologizing for
[2:12:47] being illiterate he wasn't apologizing
[2:12:49] even if he misquoted the scripture he
[2:12:51] wasn't apologizing for not being able to
[2:12:52] say it right he had the word he had the
[2:12:55] life and now he's giving out the word
[2:12:57] and the people are taking the word
[2:13:00] amen
[2:13:01] these these men who were
[2:13:03] nobodies in society they didn't have
[2:13:06] pool they didn't have rank they didn't
[2:13:07] have support amen they weren't anything
[2:13:10] but they when they came to life and they
[2:13:12] recognized who they were amen all of a
[2:13:14] sudden it didn't matter that i was a
[2:13:16] fisherman it didn't matter that i have
[2:13:17] no money it didn't matter what other
[2:13:19] people thought of me all that mattered
[2:13:21] is i've got the word of reconciliation
[2:13:25] and it's i have it
[2:13:27] i'm not questioning the word
[2:13:30] see so many times the devil gets us to
[2:13:32] look in the mirror
[2:13:33] and we look at inabilities and we look
[2:13:35] at shortcomings and we look at all these
[2:13:38] things we look in the mirror and we have
[2:13:40] the word of reconciliation and then we
[2:13:42] just lay the word of reconciliation
[2:13:44] down because of what we see in the
[2:13:45] mirror
[2:13:46] [Music]
[2:13:48] don't let the devil pull that trick on
[2:13:50] you it doesn't matter if you're a child
[2:13:52] a man a woman it doesn't matter if
[2:13:54] you're literate or illiterate it has no
[2:13:56] there's that doesn't matter what matters
[2:13:58] is have you received the word of
[2:13:59] reconciliation and is that life in you
[2:14:02] if that life's in you then give it out
[2:14:06] we don't have to apologize for who we
[2:14:07] are
[2:14:10] peter
[2:14:11] we don't have any record that peter had
[2:14:13] an inferiority complex
[2:14:16] and wouldn't preach he just went
[2:14:18] preaching
[2:14:19] then they arrested him they hauled him
[2:14:21] into the to the council and they began
[2:14:23] to threaten him and questioning amen he
[2:14:25] didn't apologize they knew that they
[2:14:27] were ignorant unlearned men they brought
[2:14:28] him in to question him he didn't get mad
[2:14:30] at them he didn't cower to them he he
[2:14:33] wasn't looking at himself he was looking
[2:14:35] at what god had done for him he was
[2:14:37] looking at the word that he was holding
[2:14:40] the devil trips us up by getting us to
[2:14:42] look at ourselves forget about yourself
[2:14:44] it's not about you it's about him
[2:14:48] [Music]
[2:14:49] have confidence in what he's done and
[2:14:51] have confidence in who he is
[2:14:53] don't have confidence in your flesh
[2:14:55] and don't let lack of confidence in your
[2:14:57] flesh cause you not to give out the word
[2:14:58] of reconciliation
[2:15:01] just give it out
[2:15:03] well i can't i can't quote the scripture
[2:15:05] i can't find it in my bible
[2:15:07] so what
[2:15:10] just give the word
[2:15:12] just share what's in your heart
[2:15:14] god will work through it god worked
[2:15:16] through peter
[2:15:18] you worked through james he worked
[2:15:19] through john worked through matthew he
[2:15:22] worked through the mall
[2:15:23] what we need to do is realize who we are
[2:15:25] and what's been placed in our hands and
[2:15:26] forget about everything else
[2:15:30] don't feel inferior don't feel second
[2:15:32] class
[2:15:34] you've been called to be the bride of
[2:15:35] jesus christ
[2:15:36] if you know what your husband thinks
[2:15:37] about you what does it matter what
[2:15:39] somebody else thinks
[2:15:42] what does it matter if the whole
[2:15:43] sanhedrin doesn't want to listen to
[2:15:45] peter because they think that peter's
[2:15:47] uneducated and unlearned and has nothing
[2:15:49] to say his wisdom blew theirs out of the
[2:15:51] water
[2:15:53] they listened to stephen stephen just a
[2:15:56] deacon in the church he preached he
[2:15:58] preached a message that started all the
[2:16:00] way back in genesis and brought it all
[2:16:01] the way through to their day and he
[2:16:04] totally unraveled them with the message
[2:16:06] that he preached
[2:16:08] [Music]
[2:16:09] why because the word
[2:16:11] will defeat anything
[2:16:14] it's the word that we have it's the word
[2:16:16] that we're manifesting it's the word
[2:16:18] that he's called us the the be
[2:16:21] stop
[2:16:22] worrying about you
[2:16:25] look at the real you
[2:16:27] the word
[2:16:29] how can i be a tree of life i've done
[2:16:31] i've done
[2:16:33] it's not what you've done it's what he's
[2:16:34] done
[2:16:36] it's not what you will that's what he
[2:16:37] willed it's not what you said it's what
[2:16:39] he said
[2:16:41] we've got to we've got to be sure of who
[2:16:44] we are
[2:16:45] we've got to be sure of this word that
[2:16:46] we're holding in our hands
[2:16:49] and if we are
[2:16:50] it's really
[2:16:52] it's really the only thing that matters
[2:16:55] if we could just walk that way the way
[2:16:56] the disciples walk
[2:16:58] they could take peter and john and they
[2:17:01] could beat them and tell them not to
[2:17:03] preach anymore in jesus name and they
[2:17:05] would run back to the house and they
[2:17:06] couldn't wait to tell the people that
[2:17:08] they got beat
[2:17:10] and they rejoiced that they were
[2:17:11] considered worthy to suffer for the
[2:17:13] gospel's sake
[2:17:14] [Music]
[2:17:15] friends that's a totally different
[2:17:17] mindset
[2:17:19] i mean when somebody at work makes fun
[2:17:21] of us we go home and cry to our wife and
[2:17:22] can't hardly take it
[2:17:24] peter and john ran back and said guess
[2:17:26] what they beat us
[2:17:29] i'm so thankful we've been found worthy
[2:17:31] to suffer for this precious word's sake
[2:17:33] for our lord
[2:17:35] that is not carnal thinking
[2:17:38] that's a whole
[2:17:40] different way of thinking
[2:17:42] i said god take your word
[2:17:45] and give us a whole new way of thinking
[2:17:48] and a whole new way of seeing
[2:17:50] and that way we can complete the
[2:17:52] ministry
[2:17:53] that you didn't finish
[2:17:54] in your earthly journey
[2:17:56] but that portion that you reserved to do
[2:17:59] now in and through the bride is going to
[2:18:01] take a different kind of thinking it's
[2:18:02] going to take the mind of christ
[2:18:05] i say god give us your mind
[2:18:07] so that we can think
[2:18:08] differently and god bless you let's bow
[2:18:11] our heads and pray
[2:18:12] [Music]

[2:18:15] privilege o god
