[3:37] Still praying as

[3:57] my faith on hand.
[4:05] a higher place
[4:08] than I have found.
[4:11] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[4:15] ground.
[4:18] My heart has no
[4:21] desire to stay.
[4:25] Where doubts arise
[4:28] and fears dismay,
[4:32] though some may dwell
[4:36] where these abound.
[4:39] My prayer, my aim is higher ground.

[5:29] the joyful sound.

[5:36] ground.

[15:05] Amen. How many believe he will according
[15:08] to his promise? Phyllis. Amen. And as
[15:11] you can see, we have a guest minister
[15:12] this morning. Amen. Brother Ruben Matany
[15:15] from Romania. And uh God just worked out
[15:17] all the circumstances last minute. And
[15:20] uh he's he's able to be with us and it's
[15:22] quite a blessing. We didn't know it,
[15:24] didn't confirm it till Friday night, so
[15:26] I couldn't tell you earlier, but it's a
[15:28] pleasant surprise. Amen. He he and his
[15:30] brother Norbert, they drove up from
[15:32] Cincinnati last night in a snowstorm.
[15:34] Amen. And it was worse down there than
[15:35] up here. So, we're glad they arrived
[15:37] safely. They got in about 9:30 uh last
[15:40] evening, but we're just glad that
[15:42] they're here with us. Uh brother Ruben's
[15:45] father, Gabriel Matany, is a good friend
[15:48] of mine. I've been to Romania, been with
[15:50] them, been in their home, been in
[15:51] Reuben's home before. Amen. And uh they
[15:54] they're quite friends of ours. And many
[15:56] of you will remember brother Gabrielle
[15:57] was here 3 years ago and ministered here
[15:59] and uh was quite a blessing to the
[16:01] assembly here. And so now Reuben's here.
[16:04] Reuben, this is his first time in the
[16:05] United States. He never dreamed of being
[16:07] here and God just worked out all the
[16:09] circumstances. Norbert's been here
[16:10] several times. God bless you, brother
[16:12] Norbert. His his work brings him over.
[16:14] He's got a client in Cincinnati. He sees
[16:16] from time to time. And when he's there,
[16:17] he drives up and visits with us. So,
[16:19] he's been here a few times. But for
[16:21] Reuben in the back, he told me, he said,
[16:23] "If you would have told me a month ago,
[16:24] I would have come, I wouldn't have
[16:25] believed you. But God just worked it
[16:27] out. And so, I'm just thankful that he
[16:29] can be here with us and he could take
[16:31] the service for us. And we just pray
[16:33] that God will bless him." Amen. I've
[16:36] watched Brother Ruben when I've been in
[16:37] Romania several times. He's a workhorse.
[16:41] Amen. He's always working. He's the
[16:43] audiovisisual technical guy. He's
[16:45] associate minister and he's the main
[16:48] camp director for their camp they do
[16:49] every summer. So this brother works and
[16:51] he's a big help to the saints there in
[16:53] Romania. And he's a blessing to his
[16:55] local church. And so we thank God for
[16:57] him. And he's young. He's 34 years old.
[16:59] So I asked him, I said, "You've been
[17:00] preaching what, 5, 6 years?" No, 17
[17:02] years. He started when he was 17, 18
[17:04] years old. So I was like, "Wow, praise
[17:06] God." You can never underestimate
[17:09] anybody. Amen. So I've also asked him to
[17:12] take the youth meeting this afternoon
[17:13] and share some of his experiences. Amen.
[17:16] With our young people. So we're looking
[17:18] forward to that. Also want to say we
[17:21] appreciate Brother Joseph again for
[17:22] cleaning up the parking lot. This has
[17:24] been an active winter so far, brother.
[17:26] Amen. It's been a blessing.
[17:32] Amen. And when he volunteered to help,
[17:33] he was taken once, twice a year, like
[17:35] the last few. He didn't know it was
[17:37] going to be a full-time job. And then
[17:38] brother Elmer Schwarz came by early this
[17:40] morning and resulted. And then when I
[17:42] pulled in, Brother Dean and Xavier were
[17:44] going around and hitting walks and
[17:45] spots. So I just appreciate those
[17:47] brothers making it easy for the rest of
[17:49] us. I thank God for watching over us.
[17:51] And I'm so glad the storm ended early
[17:53] last night. I was so happy. Thank God.
[17:56] Amen. You know how I feel about Saturday
[17:58] night snowstorms. Amen. But God is good.
[18:01] So, we're just going to invite brother
[18:03] Ruben to come. We want him to be able to
[18:04] relax, but his ability to relax depends
[18:06] on our ability to pull. And I know how
[18:09] it is when he can slip into that channel
[18:11] where he's no longer in control and
[18:12] God's flowing cuz we're feeding. Amen.
[18:15] That's when it'll become comfortable for
[18:17] him. So, I want to help him get into
[18:18] that spot early. Amen. So, God bless
[18:21] you. We're going to invite him with the
[18:22] song with the Riley.

[27:11] what's happening but to this morning I
[27:13] want to encourage you from the Bible
[27:15] Paul says the race is set
[27:20] &gt;&gt; not but somebody it's God himself
[27:24] &gt;&gt; who is out of time I want to take I I
[27:26] want to if you want to take in
[27:28] consideration
[27:29] Eternity is not influenced by time.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Time is affected by external factors.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; Time is affected by a lot of things. But
[27:39] eternity cannot be touched.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; So there is something the author and the
[27:48] finisher of our faith. Amen. Blessed be
[27:51] the name of the Lord.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; I like this. I like this Bible from
[27:55] David. David realized David went through
[27:57] a lot of struggles.
[27:59] David had a was a man of of of battles.
[28:03] David had a lot of sorrows, a lot of and
[28:05] at the end he realized he lifts up his
[28:07] hand and he realized humanly I cannot
[28:11] keep myself. I cannot keep my faith. I
[28:14] cannot keep my belief. And he says the
[28:17] Lord shall preserve.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; In Romania we have a custom uh if you
[28:23] want to preserve, we make some pickles.
[28:25] You had to put some ingredients that
[28:27] would preserve the vegetables
[28:30] &gt;&gt; and whatever is coming those vegetables
[28:34] uh are preserved
[28:36] &gt;&gt; uh in order to resist all through the
[28:38] year.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; There is some ingredients and the
[28:42] receipt to preserve those vegetables.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; And there is something special to
[28:47] preserve the bride in this age. You
[28:50] cannot be preserved by any other belief
[28:53] only by the message of the hour by the
[28:55] revealed word. This will preserve you
[28:58] till the end and the rapture will not be
[29:00] a surprise for you.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; You expect it
[29:04] &gt;&gt; because God is not coming for and he is
[29:06] who God is not coming for volunteers.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; He's coming for son and daughters of
[29:11] God. Right.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; So if God is prepared,
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; you are also prepared.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; God
[29:16] &gt;&gt; because God is is blessed be the name of
[29:19] the Lord. So I love this. He shall
[29:20] preserve thy soul.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. And if we believe not
[29:27] this fle this flesh is always an
[29:29] unbeliever.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Don't try to make him believer.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; You have to declare war with this.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; You cannot this is not our friend.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Don't look for enemies around. Yeah,
[29:41] &gt;&gt; this is our brother Bram said this is
[29:43] our greatest enemy
[29:45] &gt;&gt; but there is something stronger
[29:47] &gt;&gt; than this flesh. So sometimes you know
[29:50] we got discouraged because we have a lot
[29:52] of thoughts in our mind and the problem
[29:54] is we don't identify the source of the
[29:56] thoughts
[29:57] &gt;&gt; and sometimes you got discouraged oh
[29:59] lord I maybe I thought bad about this
[30:01] brother or sister or we had some you
[30:04] know the the problem is we have to
[30:06] identify the source
[30:08] &gt;&gt; and say lord I don't want to have these
[30:10] thoughts I don't want to have this
[30:12] greater is he that is in me
[30:14] &gt;&gt; amen
[30:14] &gt;&gt; and once you identify the source you are
[30:17] overcomer
[30:18] So if you want to be overcomer this
[30:20] morning, let's let's look to Jesus the
[30:23] author and the finisher of our faith.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Now to understand in human life there
[30:29] are several things and I can I can call
[30:31] it author or creator or manufacturer. A
[30:34] manufacturer a it's a company or
[30:37] business they make some products some
[30:39] some things. A creator is somebody who
[30:42] brings something new in existence or an
[30:45] author is something or or a a creator or
[30:48] maybe a writer.
[30:50] But I want to what I want to highlight
[30:52] in human life we trust the manufacturer
[30:58] by the products they make.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; So I never if you if you go and buy a
[31:04] car you don't you don't drive after one
[31:06] year and bring it back and say I don't
[31:08] like this. you buy, you go and search
[31:11] for a car because you trust that
[31:13] manufacturer and you believe that that
[31:16] will fit your need.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; When you go to a shop, you look for a,
[31:21] for example, a chocolate. You look for a
[31:24] special brand because you trust that and
[31:26] you know this is good.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; You don't go to the shop and try every
[31:31] chocolate brand and this is they will
[31:34] take you out from the shop soon.
[31:37] you and this this I want to say this
[31:39] trust on the manufacturer or on any
[31:42] brand is built from is built from I can
[31:46] call it uh from the word somebody told
[31:49] you this is good
[31:50] &gt;&gt; and you started to trust that word
[31:54] &gt;&gt; so basically basically when you take a
[31:57] book you don't read it first and then
[31:59] you say oh I don't like it I give it
[32:00] back people search for books for a
[32:04] special with a special author because
[32:06] they trust trust that they trust that
[32:08] author and say, "Oh, I want to read
[32:09] those books from that auth
[32:17] they they trust that author." Is that
[32:19] right? So basically basically the
[32:22] product we trust the product of the
[32:25] manufacturer
[32:26] &gt;&gt; and because of that we give credit to
[32:30] the manufacturer and say this is a good
[32:32] brand, this is a good company. uh
[32:35] sometimes we have some I don't want to
[32:37] say but from other countries some lower
[32:40] products you don't trust them that's
[32:42] right say I don't want that but you have
[32:44] something good said yes I trust
[32:47] &gt;&gt; so so our story start with another outer
[32:51] &gt;&gt; that is Jesus
[32:54] &gt;&gt; and I I I like it when when the angel
[32:56] came to brotherham the first thing he
[33:00] wanted to identify his source and the
[33:04] And and he said because the source the
[33:07] source is very important. You trust the
[33:10] source and you know if things come from
[33:13] a certain source or manufacturer that
[33:16] things are good.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; So we learned that the Bible says there
[33:21] is a faith
[33:23] whose author and finisher is Jesus.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So we
[33:31] say when the angel of the Lord came to
[33:32] brother Arab he said don't be afraid I
[33:35] coming with a I'm coming with a message
[33:38] from the presence of God.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; This message is not is not from a source
[33:45] of a of a human.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; It's from the presence of God.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; It's from the presence of God. Blessed
[33:51] be the name of the Lord. Brother Abraham
[33:53] says in super sign there was one named
[33:56] Moses who believed in a supernatural
[33:59] God. He met him and talked to him in a
[34:01] supernatural way at a supernatural bush.
[34:05] Uh had a supernatural fire on a on a
[34:08] bush. He got a supernatural message.
[34:11] He got a supernatural message.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; One man going down, one man invasion,
[34:17] take over Egypt, a supernatural message.
[34:21] But it was from a supernatural God.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we tend to make this message
[34:26] natural.
[34:28] Don't degrade the message.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Let it be supernatural.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; A natural message cannot be can can't be
[34:36] understood by natural people.
[34:39] Supernatural message can be understood
[34:41] by supernatural people.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; So don't make this message natural.
[34:46] Amen.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; You cannot prove a supernatural message
[34:50] to a natural people
[34:52] &gt;&gt; because they want always to figure it
[34:54] out everything because supernatural is
[34:57] overnatural.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; You cannot prove supernatural with
[35:00] natural because then you you you lower
[35:03] the quality. Leave the message
[35:05] supernatural
[35:06] &gt;&gt; because the message makes you a
[35:07] supernatural people, a supernatural
[35:10] race. That's why Hebrews says we have
[35:13] come closer to a supernatural church.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; There is a super there is a crowd of
[35:19] witnesses. The church of the
[35:22] &gt;&gt; first born.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; That church of the firstborn is a church
[35:26] made of supernatural people out of sons
[35:29] and daughters of God. So don't try to
[35:33] lower them the quality of the message,
[35:36] the quality of revelation. Keep it
[35:38] supernatural. Sometimes we tend to prove
[35:41] the message but the message is already
[35:43] proved
[35:44] &gt;&gt; because
[35:46] because you are not a you you are not a
[35:50] natural man with a with an with a
[35:52] heavenly experience. You are a
[35:55] supernatural being having a natural
[35:58] experience but not losing the the the
[36:01] purpose and the plan of God. And that's
[36:04] why Satan is asking himself, what's
[36:06] happening? How eternity can drop down in
[36:10] a body called time? But I'm so happy.
[36:14] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[36:16] Whatever God does
[36:18] &gt;&gt; for for for
[36:20] his for his supernatural people, he
[36:22] could not send a natural message.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; He sent them a supernatural message. So
[36:28] in in this morning I want to encourage
[36:30] you don't sometimes we hear and if you
[36:34] are honest with us and uh sometimes we
[36:37] try that we pretend we understand
[36:39] everything but sometimes inside of us
[36:41] maybe we have some struggles but this
[36:44] morning tell to your struggles you don't
[36:46] need to understand because it's
[36:48] supernatural
[36:49] &gt;&gt; because he that is in me this message is
[36:52] for him
[36:54] &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of the lord a
[36:56] supernatural message sent to
[36:58] supernatural race supernatural bride and
[37:01] natural cannot defeat supernatural.
[37:03] That's right.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; There is no power around to defeat the
[37:07] supernatural because that's above
[37:09] &gt;&gt; and everything what is above is higher
[37:11] is stronger is greater and this message
[37:13] is greater than your unbelief. This
[37:15] message is greater than your problem.
[37:17] This message is greater than your
[37:18] struggle and this me and the rapture
[37:21] cannot be stopped. Brother and sister
[37:24] your I want to be respectful but your
[37:27] unbelief cannot stop the the rapture
[37:30] &gt;&gt; because if in this we have a lot of
[37:32] struggles he remains a believer he
[37:36] cannot deny himself
[37:38] &gt;&gt; and the rapture is not for for just
[37:40] somebody the rapture is for sons and
[37:43] daughters of God
[37:44] &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of the lord
[37:47] &gt;&gt; amen happy this morning
[37:49] &gt;&gt; amen amen 11:1 says what is faith.
[37:54] Sometimes we have an understanding that
[37:55] faith is like a we put it from a shelf
[37:59] and we we we ask God give me faith faith
[38:01] faith. This is other church have this
[38:04] mentality. They're praying for faith.
[38:06] Give me faith. Give me faith. But we
[38:08] want to say this morning Hebrew 11 it's
[38:11] the chapter of the overcomers. And it it
[38:14] says by faith by faith by faith. None of
[38:18] them
[38:19] none of everybody of them have something
[38:23] in common and is that faith and that
[38:26] faith was not taken from a shelf. They
[38:29] were born with that faith
[38:31] &gt;&gt; and that their birth uh shows the
[38:35] reality. Blessed be the name of the
[38:37] Lord. So Hebrew 11:1 says
[38:41] faith is the substance.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. the evidence of things not seen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Now this word substance stands for for
[38:51] the
[38:52] essense is like the chemical is the
[38:56] core.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; So God cannot be cannot uh go God is he
[39:04] always believes
[39:05] &gt;&gt; in God there is no unbelief.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Right? So, brother Bram says and and we
[39:11] will read this quote, "God believes for
[39:13] you."
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't believe for us, but
[39:16] God believes for you.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; What a special people to to this
[39:20] morning.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Glory. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[39:23] I I hope somebody is not somebody's
[39:26] happy because there is a author and a
[39:28] finisher of our faith.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. He
[39:32] shall preserve my soul.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I thought we lost. We are
[39:36] lost. Sometimes we thought we will we
[39:38] will uh give up but we cannot give up
[39:42] &gt;&gt; because you are himself
[39:44] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says he cannot deny
[39:46] himself.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. Amen.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that we have a sure
[39:52] salvation?
[39:53] &gt;&gt; And Paul comes and he says for the early
[39:57] change early age for the early change he
[40:00] said you cannot understand but it will
[40:03] it will come a group of people that we
[40:06] will present you perfect.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; We will we will we will come come to
[40:11] this soon. Blessed be the name of the
[40:12] Lord. But Abraham says in a trumpet
[40:15] gives an uncertain sound. There he
[40:17] remained upon that word showing us an
[40:20] example. Uh he says I have given you
[40:25] time is running fast so we want to I
[40:28] have given you an example and that is an
[40:30] example that we should uh we should be
[40:33] perfectly put our trust in the word of
[40:36] God.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Put our trust in the word in the word of
[40:41] God. Let everything else be alive.
[40:44] Let every that's the one thing that's
[40:46] certain. God made the promise. God is
[40:49] going to keep the promise. They say how
[40:52] can these things happen.
[40:54] How can a how how he get a bunch of
[40:57] people together with rapturing grace to
[41:00] go up. I don't know how will he will do
[41:03] it. It's not my business to ask how he
[41:05] will do it. It's my business just to be
[41:08] ready for it.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; He promised it. is going to happen.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Fortified with his church by the word.
[41:16] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[41:18] Ephesians church age brother says her
[41:21] righteousness is in his righteousness.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Her attributes are his own attributes.
[41:28] Her identity is found in him.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we look around and we try to
[41:35] identify with that that that and it says
[41:39] still not working. But when you start to
[41:41] identify with the message,
[41:43] &gt;&gt; it comes to rest.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; So if you want to come to rest tonight,
[41:47] this morning try uh
[41:51] uh surrender and identify in him. Your
[41:55] identity is found in him. Blessed be the
[41:58] name of the Lord.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; So we want to look for for this subject,
[42:02] the author and the finisher of our
[42:04] faith. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[42:06] the the the the author is not stand just
[42:10] by by a composer that he he he he he do
[42:15] something but this word in Greek is uh
[42:18] archaos and this is this this stands for
[42:22] uh author captain captain or prince
[42:27] or a person who is originator and
[42:30] founder
[42:32] your fate is not from from you your
[42:35] phrase Your faith is coming from a
[42:37] different source. It's is the the
[42:40] founder. It's God.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; The eternal brothers describes God the
[42:45] eternal fountain of God who was filling
[42:48] the universe. He stepped in a in a body
[42:51] called logos in a body called uh in a in
[42:54] a light body and all that was in God
[42:58] poured was poured in Christ. Blessed be
[43:01] the name of the Lord. And the pillar of
[43:03] fire is the originator of our faith.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; I want to highlight pillar of fire is
[43:11] light.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Have you ever saw somebody uh that uh
[43:16] darkness to take over light
[43:19] &gt;&gt; but the Bible says light have overcome
[43:21] darkness.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; And but the Bible says your children are
[43:25] from the light.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your father is the light.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; That's why if you are part of the logos,
[43:33] your light cannot be shut down.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Whatever problem comes in your life,
[43:38] whatever sit situation, you will kept
[43:41] shining.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Tell to your darkness around, I will
[43:45] keep shining.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Tell to the world around, I will keep
[43:49] shining. Even if your family is not a
[43:52] good condition, say to yourself, I will
[43:54] keep shining because the source of my
[43:57] light is not a natural light because
[44:00] this will fade out. But if the source is
[44:03] the pillar of fire, you cannot be
[44:06] defeated.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; You cannot be defeated. And even if you
[44:09] go to trials this morning, you cannot be
[44:12] defeated. And sometimes we try we try uh
[44:16] we try proofs but in the time of Noah he
[44:19] could not have proof. They was looking
[44:22] for clouds no clouds they were looking
[44:25] but what was the proof? The end.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; And the proof of the message will be the
[44:30] transformation.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; So even if this morning you don't have
[44:34] something that you can rely this on this
[44:36] flesh re does trust. I I know this
[44:40] message will result in the
[44:42] transformation which will result in in
[44:44] in in eternity.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; That's why don't don't sometimes we are
[44:49] we are in in in human sometimes we try
[44:53] to relay on something and you say oh I
[44:56] felt I felt good I felt safe tomorrow
[45:00] maybe you fall down break the leg then
[45:03] you are bad you know our experiences
[45:06] affects our bodies. But the inside
[45:10] &gt;&gt; it cannot be affected by natural things
[45:13] &gt;&gt; because it's just supernatural.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; It's it's coming from the presence of
[45:18] God.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; So the out I like to highlight this the
[45:22] out and the finisher is the same.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Sometime churches tense that God is the
[45:28] author but the church is the finisher.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; And they come and they say yes it's good
[45:33] but we will show how to finish the race.
[45:36] But I have a message that showed me how
[45:37] to finish the race. And if you want to
[45:39] make sure you will be finished the race,
[45:41] look to him. The author and the finisher
[45:44] of your faith.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; I'm happy that the my faith is what not
[45:48] start not started in a church because
[45:51] churches can come and can go but your
[45:53] faith in the message of the hour have
[45:55] not started because if started with end
[45:58] but if it's coming from eternity will
[46:00] never end.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the lord. Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; So I want to highlight something in
[46:06] Hebrew 12:12. Author and the finisher.
[46:10] In other words, upon your faith is not
[46:13] an intervention.
[46:15] Faith doesn't need a human intervention.
[46:19] He the Bible Paul wanted to want to
[46:22] highlight to show the complete work, the
[46:25] complete vision of God. He's the author
[46:27] and the finisher. In other words, he is
[46:30] in control from the beginning to the
[46:32] end.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Can you understand why brother Abraham
[46:35] says God is incomplete
[46:38] &gt;&gt; without you?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Because if somebody of you is missing,
[46:42] then his work is not complete.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; And he cannot afford
[46:47] &gt;&gt; just to think how precious you are in
[46:49] the sight of God. people around maybe
[46:51] don't give nothing on you but God give
[46:53] everything on you
[46:54] &gt;&gt; because it's about it's his work in in
[46:57] in in on on in in in charge is his work
[47:01] his word in charge not your word
[47:04] &gt;&gt; so Bible says he's the author and the
[47:07] finisher
[47:09] &gt;&gt; of our faith
[47:11] &gt;&gt; that's why your faith cannot dim out
[47:15] &gt;&gt; and can your faith is the same blessed
[47:18] be the name of the lord
[47:19] So when you look this shows a complete
[47:21] work a complete vision a complete
[47:23] purpose and the our the author
[47:28] said from the beginning it is finished.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; So when he looked to the faith that he
[47:35] placed in in this church
[47:38] &gt;&gt; he said they will be overcomer till the
[47:42] end.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; And we never knew this. A church came to
[47:46] us and says you have to raise your hand
[47:48] to be and that's all good but when the
[47:52] message the revelation came to us he
[47:54] said you was always saved
[47:57] &gt;&gt; you are not saved you know if if I just
[47:59] come and tell you you are always saved
[48:02] sometimes it looks strange but we when
[48:04] we go slowly and realize the perfect
[48:06] plan of God the perfect plan of
[48:08] salvation
[48:09] &gt;&gt; then you you realize it's not your
[48:12] salvation
[48:14] &gt;&gt; God is coming to Moses. Israel is
[48:16] Israelis was in at the Red Sea and God
[48:19] is looking to them and said why are you
[48:22] crying? Why are you uh like uh why are
[48:26] you tearing for the why are you doing
[48:28] this this
[48:30] not I have taken you
[48:33] &gt;&gt; and I will take you in the land.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord I thought we will have to take
[48:39] us to the land.
[48:41] But God said to Moses,
[48:43] &gt;&gt; "What's all this crying and all the
[48:45] &gt;&gt; I'm taking to the land."
[48:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Bram said, "People
[48:51] are fighting against the will of God."
[48:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Let's let's just let's just step on this
[48:59] boat of grace, the message of the hour,
[49:02] &gt;&gt; and surrender to it completely.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; This will take you through.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[49:09] Amen. Amen. So we want to see uh
[49:14] there is not intervention at the
[49:16] beginning. I will start I'm the author.
[49:20] Somebody will have to handle some things
[49:22] and then I will finish.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; God is not repairing things.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Because if you repair something then
[49:29] he's not God.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; So you cannot be repaired
[49:34] &gt;&gt; because if I mean your salvation
[49:37] &gt;&gt; it's a finished work. Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; And Paul is Paul had a revelation. He
[49:41] met the pillar of fire and he says I
[49:43] come you to
[49:45] make you no he said I come to declare.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; So we have also declaration.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Declaration. Amen. So
[49:57] the author said it is finished. This
[50:01] means it has full warranty.
[50:05] They have, you know, uh for commercial
[50:09] things they they invented extended
[50:11] warranty but this still expires
[50:15] because they know they they know that
[50:17] the things will break.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Sometimes they pretend ah lifetime
[50:22] warranty but this still not really works
[50:27] &gt;&gt; because everything what is in time
[50:29] depends on external factors
[50:31] &gt;&gt; on external conditions.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Right?
[50:34] But this faith
[50:36] &gt;&gt; have an author because of the source.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; It cannot be stopped.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; It cannot be removed.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; It cannot be changed.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; It stand.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Somebody say this morning, I will stand.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; I will stand. Oh, blessed be the name of
[51:00] the Lord. Do you know why? So we
[51:02] understand but Abraham says all hell is
[51:05] against this revelation.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; But you this morning if you look around
[51:10] you are for this revelation.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; So that mean you are so powerful and
[51:15] sometimes we think we are overwhelmed.
[51:17] We are over but if you can resist to all
[51:20] hell
[51:21] &gt;&gt; because it's not you it's greater he
[51:24] that is in you.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the lord. Yes.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; So, so
[51:30] this faith have the author because of
[51:33] the source. That's why we can sing
[51:36] blessed assurance.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed assurance, blessed salvation, it
[51:42] belongs to me.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[51:46] other thing that I want to highlight
[51:47] when in this in this products uh selling
[51:50] society,
[51:52] there is a
[51:54] uh uh uh when when you buy this ex
[51:58] extended warranty, you are having rest
[52:02] till you have this warranty. But once
[52:04] your fridge is out of warranty, you pray
[52:07] not to break the fridge because you are
[52:10] not covered. So in warranty is peace.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; You you you to be honest sometimes after
[52:18] we we buy something and after 5 years we
[52:21] would like to break to get a new one.
[52:24] Sometimes it happens you know you look
[52:27] you don't break some electricity power
[52:29] to this is you know but
[52:34] as long as you have warranty you have
[52:36] peace
[52:37] and you know not you are taking care of
[52:41] the product. You just you have a hotline
[52:44] and you call the manufacturer, take your
[52:46] fridge and bring a new one because and
[52:49] you say because it's in warranty. It's
[52:51] in
[52:53] &gt;&gt; warranty. Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; The company is responsible
[52:57] to have it up and running till it's in
[53:00] warranty.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; But when the warranty break up, you lost
[53:04] your piece. You always check the light
[53:06] in the fridge is going good. Next time
[53:10] you lost your peace, you your life's
[53:12] become in struggle.
[53:14] But we but we have
[53:18] your your faith, your trust in the
[53:20] message of the hour. This is guaranteed.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; This will not vex out.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Because this is coming from a source
[53:30] that is the pillar of fire, the logos.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; So you are not going out from warranty.
[53:36] It's guaranteed eternity. Amen.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; In the message of the hour, eternity is
[53:41] guaranteed. That's why we can say we can
[53:43] tr our eternity what Abraham says our
[53:47] eternity it's it lays on the word of
[53:50] God.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; So are you are you happy tonight?
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Uh this this morning we have not just an
[53:58] extended warranty we have an eternal
[54:00] guarantee. Yeah,
[54:01] &gt;&gt; God will take as we read, God will take
[54:04] care of your incoming and of your
[54:07] outgoing.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Basically, this message of the hour made
[54:12] us to look to him and to make this
[54:16] message makes us to worship him because
[54:18] he made the things so perfect. He made
[54:21] things so great
[54:23] &gt;&gt; and sometimes humanity mind cannot grasp
[54:26] it but inside of you is saying nothing
[54:29] else but the truth. Blessed be the name
[54:31] of the Lord. Brother Abraham says in
[54:33] four words is faith expressed. And he
[54:37] promised you the same thing. If you
[54:39] could believe that would happen. If you
[54:41] can't believe it, it just won't happen.
[54:44] Now, brother Bram says, I cannot make
[54:47] you believe. Neither can you make
[54:50] yourself believe. Sometimes we
[54:54] we we we tend to believe that our
[54:57] experiences
[54:58] oh yes I believe because once you said
[55:02] this is not a matter of belief because
[55:04] you have a proof.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; So if you have a proof it's not a belief
[55:07] because the Bible says in Hebrew 11
[55:09] faith is the things not seen.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; So brother Abraham says God has got to
[55:16] give it to you.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; It's a gift of God to believe.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not your faith, God faith.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Your intellectual faith might believe
[55:27] it, it fine. But unless the faith of God
[55:29] is down in your heart, see your int
[55:32] intellectual faith can accept it. Do
[55:35] that and just keep having it on all your
[55:38] heart until God reveals it to you.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Let's slow down.
[55:46] Faith needs
[55:48] revelation.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So re brother Abraham says until
[55:53] God's revealed it to you. See just keep
[55:56] believing until God does reveal it to
[55:59] you.
[56:01] So
[56:03] brother says not until God's give it to
[56:05] you or until you receive it. He just
[56:08] reveal it.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; That means it's already in you.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, what you need for the
[56:15] rapture, it's already in you.
[56:20] It's already in you.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; That's why we we we we needed the word,
[56:26] the revelation to present us the perfect
[56:30] work of God.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh Psalms 102:26 says, Psalms 26,
[56:37] they will perish, but you remain.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; They will all wear out like a garment,
[56:45] like clothing. You will change them and
[56:46] they will pass on. But you remain the
[56:49] same
[56:50] &gt;&gt; and your ears
[56:53] will never end.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; He remains the same.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Aren't
[57:01] you happy this morning?
[57:03] Psalms 125 verse1 says they that trust
[57:07] in the Lord shall be as mount Zion which
[57:12] cannot be removed but abide forever.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; You cannot be removed
[57:20] because God cannot be removed
[57:22] &gt;&gt; and if you are a part of him God cannot
[57:24] afford somebody to miss because then
[57:26] he's not God. So I want to say it in
[57:29] irreverence
[57:31] but God father Abraham said God needs
[57:34] you more than you need him. We don't
[57:38] take it in granted but this make us so
[57:40] humble to realize how great he is that
[57:44] he he he he he became in a me
[57:47] multi-member body
[57:49] &gt;&gt; and he needs you.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Don't don't run from the plan come to
[57:54] the purpose of God.
[57:56] Brother Bram starts the sermon in he
[57:59] that is in you and he says uh paragraph
[58:02] 55 brother says in he that is in you 63.
[58:05] Now the text from that tonight I would
[58:08] like to use as a text and he says the
[58:11] title he that is in you and then he says
[58:15] something and on this I wish to build
[58:19] faith.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He that is in you and on this I
[58:26] wish to build faith
[58:28] &gt;&gt; because all the other things will will
[58:30] fade out. But if you have faith, if your
[58:33] faith relies on he that is in you,
[58:37] &gt;&gt; sir.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; You are saved because you have something
[58:43] in you
[58:44] &gt;&gt; that is a part of God.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have faith because
[58:49] because he that is in you.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; You will be raptured not because you are
[58:55] good
[58:56] &gt;&gt; because many people are good. The
[58:58] neighbors are good
[58:59] &gt;&gt; but you will be raptured because of he
[59:01] that is in you.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; And we didn't know this but the message
[59:04] of D came in our way.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; And he said you are not a child of child
[59:09] of Abraham. You are child of the living
[59:11] God.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:13] Build your faith on he that is in you.
[59:16] Build your salvation on he that is in
[59:18] you. Build your trust in God on he that
[59:21] is in you. And if Satan comes to your
[59:23] mind and say, "Oh, you will not make
[59:25] it." You can say, "This will not make
[59:27] it." But this will make it.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Because he's coming for his own.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; None of them will be lost. He's coming
[59:35] for his own. Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; And this morning, we base our salvation
[59:40] on he that is in us.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; We based our eternal uh destination on
[59:46] he that is in us.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; And we know as glory to God, you cannot
[59:51] be lost because God cannot be lost.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Trust it. It's okay this morning.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Just a little encouragement. And I know
[1:00:00] brother Chad, we enjoyed his ministry so
[1:00:01] much in Romania. But just a little
[1:00:04] encouragement under his under his
[1:00:06] ministry to say this message is nothing
[1:00:08] but the truth.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; And the the thing is if he began this
[1:00:15] good work in you.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; He will finish it.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Don't try to finish it.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Don't try to I mean it's good to be
[1:00:27] honest. this this this man we have to
[1:00:29] keep it under laws and regulations
[1:00:31] because this otherwise can go in
[1:00:33] troubles but inside of you look to he
[1:00:38] that is in you
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; because he that is in you he that began
[1:00:42] this work he will finish it
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Lord I thought that that that is a
[1:00:47] struggle to finish to make the rapture
[1:00:50] but the message of the hour came on my
[1:00:52] way and you told me it's a finished work
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; amen Amen. Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; That's that's why blessed be the name of
[1:00:59] the Lord.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Psalms 121,
[1:01:03] you cannot uh bow your your eyes. You
[1:01:07] have to lift your eyes.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; 121 verse1 says, I will lift my eyes.
[1:01:14] And when you lift your eyes, you will
[1:01:17] get help.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; So this message is not an earthly
[1:01:22] message,
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; is a heavenly message. Amen.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; That's why don't try to search the
[1:01:28] message down. Lift your eyes
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; and the message the help
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; is coming. The Bible says I will lift my
[1:01:36] eyes upon heels from
[1:01:39] sorry my reading is not so good but I
[1:01:41] will say it in my words from where my
[1:01:44] help comes.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; So your solution further the problem is
[1:01:50] the message of the hour
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; is the revealed word of God. Yeah,
[1:01:54] that's right.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; My verse two, my help come from the Lord
[1:01:59] for he had made heaven and the earth.
[1:02:02] This is in Israel. It's called the
[1:02:04] blessing of the the one who is on
[1:02:06] journey
[1:02:08] and the Israel is on is on a natural
[1:02:11] journey but the bride is on a spiritual
[1:02:13] journey.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; So the one who you can apply this on
[1:02:18] your spiritual journey.
[1:02:21] He will not suffer thy foot to be moved.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; You cannot it cannot be enough strong
[1:02:30] storm to in order to move you
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says he will not
[1:02:36] suffer thy foot to be moved.
[1:02:39] And he he continues he that kept they
[1:02:43] will not slumber.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; The thing is that I like it's all about
[1:02:49] him. Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; And we look to ourself and we can say,
[1:02:53] "Mama, that's me."
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Basically, in you is the perfect work of
[1:02:58] God. In you is a is an eternal purpose.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; The Bible says here, he will keep me.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; So now sometimes you think I shall not
[1:03:09] be moved. I shall not be moved. But
[1:03:11] that's a reality.
[1:03:13] You will not be moved. You are just like
[1:03:15] a tree standing on the water.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Behold, he that kept Israel shall
[1:03:24] neither slumber nor sleep.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Verse five, the Lord is thy keeper.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; The Lord is thy shade upon the right
[1:03:33] hand. The sun shall not smite thee by
[1:03:37] day, nor the moon by night. The the Lord
[1:03:40] shall preserve thee from all evil.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; We cannot stop the evil. This is all
[1:03:47] around us.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; But you are preserved from it.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; The Lord shall preserve you from all
[1:03:54] your unbelief
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; from all your struggles, from all your
[1:04:00] fails,
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; the Lord is still preserving you.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; And I think we have a testimony and this
[1:04:06] is all if the Lord would not be on our
[1:04:09] side where we would be.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; But we want to make the Lord is our
[1:04:14] side. That's why we are here. Amen.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; And tomorrow we can say the same thing.
[1:04:19] We will be tomorrow there because the
[1:04:21] Lord is in our side
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; and we will be till the rapture standing
[1:04:25] because the Lord is on your side.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[1:04:29] Lord shall preserve thy soul.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; So he have some ingredients
[1:04:37] so powerful that this earth cannot
[1:04:41] destroy.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He cannot be touched, cannot be
[1:04:45] removed. The light cannot go out.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; My God is stronger. My God is greater.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; He's greater than all your needs. He's
[1:04:55] greater than your your your your doubts.
[1:04:57] He's greater than your whatever you go
[1:05:00] through. He is in control.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. He is
[1:05:05] in control. Tell you to your condition
[1:05:08] tonight, this morning, he is in control.
[1:05:12] So now as we spoke these things uh Paul
[1:05:15] says in Colossians
[1:05:18] uh Colossians 1:28
[1:05:20] whom he preaching
[1:05:23] every man and teaching every man in all
[1:05:25] wisdom that we may present
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; the the message of Der is not changing
[1:05:33] seed.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; It's not changing species.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; It's just presenting you.
[1:05:40] That's why sometimes
[1:05:42] people come in the message go in the
[1:05:45] message that but you you stay
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; in our minds you have questions sure
[1:05:53] because it's this flesh
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; but inside of you is there's no question
[1:05:57] about the message
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; sometimes you know all these things we
[1:06:02] go through and we have some doubts
[1:06:04] always and and Satan comes to you and
[1:06:06] say you see you are doubting tell Satan
[1:06:09] this morning. I'm not doubting this
[1:06:11] message
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; because he that is in me believes this
[1:06:14] message
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; and my Bible says he cannot deny himself
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; and I will stand faithful till the end.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Because not I am faithful. He is
[1:06:23] faithful as in he's faithful in me
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; and he he if he's in you this morning
[1:06:28] he's faithful.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Tell your problems my my God is faithful
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; and he's not somewhere he's right in
[1:06:36] you.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:06:40] that we may present every man perfect in
[1:06:43] Christ Jesus.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Another translation,
[1:06:48] the Amplified Bible says, "We proclaim
[1:06:51] him.
[1:06:53] We don't proclaim us."
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; This message is proclaiming him.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; And he is in you.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:07:03] This says we proclaim him. warning.
[1:07:08] This for us is a warning. Sometimes when
[1:07:10] you see a warning, you take attention.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Bible says this message is a warning. is
[1:07:15] is trying to attract your attention
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; and instructing every this is the
[1:07:20] amplified Bible uh warning and
[1:07:22] instructing everyone in all wisdom
[1:07:25] that is with comprehensive insight into
[1:07:28] the word and purpose of God so that we
[1:07:31] may present every person
[1:07:34] not half
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; not just a part complete in Christ.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; That's why the message came to present
[1:07:43] the finished work of God. Amen.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; And in this we rejoice.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Because we know
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; it's already done.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; The battle is over.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; We have only some, as brother Bram said,
[1:07:56] some days have to pass.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; But you know your destination.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Your faith have a different source.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; The author and the finisher. And the
[1:08:09] guarantee of our faith is not expiring.
[1:08:11] Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; It's have an eternal warranty, an
[1:08:15] eternal guarantee. It will never go out.
[1:08:19] It will always stand.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; So this will not make this will not
[1:08:25] change
[1:08:27] is is is not here that we may we will
[1:08:31] make you complete. We may change you in
[1:08:34] completion. We may add you. We may
[1:08:36] include you. This sounds like some
[1:08:39] churches
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; but not the message.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; We may try to convert you to be
[1:08:45] completed. We may try to convince you.
[1:08:51] This is not how it works.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; The message came to present the bride.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Behold
[1:08:59] the the bride.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; The bride has has made herself ready.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Abraham says the
[1:09:08] highlight of my ministry
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; is to clothe
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; in the word the bride.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; It is it is a high thing to present.
[1:09:25] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:09:29] Present uh to present is related to
[1:09:32] something that is finished. Sometimes in
[1:09:35] our lives many times uh we say my
[1:09:38] presentation is not finished in school
[1:09:41] or in in work my presentation is not
[1:09:43] finished. This this refers to an to to
[1:09:47] uh to to refers to a job that is not
[1:09:50] finished.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; When you present something you present a
[1:09:54] finished project.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; You you present a finished work. You
[1:09:58] present a finished plan. Usually
[1:10:00] presentation is related to something
[1:10:03] complete.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; We we we say I and we already say
[1:10:09] sometimes I cannot show you or I cannot
[1:10:11] present you because it's not yet done.
[1:10:14] But when it's done you are coming full
[1:10:16] of joy to your wife. I say darling let
[1:10:20] me present what I've did. And for sure
[1:10:23] she will say you need something to
[1:10:25] repair there or to just there.
[1:10:28] This happens but it's good that together
[1:10:31] the husband and wife make a good a
[1:10:34] perfect a complete work. Amen. So but
[1:10:38] some we say come I want to present you
[1:10:41] because I'm done. So when you when you a
[1:10:45] project or when a thing is done you you
[1:10:47] don't come say oh I finished it please
[1:10:52] you are happy because it's finished
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; you are happy because it's completed
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; and you are happy because you say I done
[1:10:59] it.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; My wife didn't believe me I can make it
[1:11:02] but I've done it.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; I want to prove her I made it.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; You see you are ready to present. Amen.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; And the message, glory, are you happy
[1:11:12] this morning?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour came to present
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; a finished work of God.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; And God is full of joy when he's looking
[1:11:20] to you in this dark age. He knows it is
[1:11:24] finished.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; And and Bible says he is waiting. So the
[1:11:29] enemy will be under your feet.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; The message is not just relating
[1:11:35] something. is not just describing,
[1:11:38] it's presenting.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; David is it says in the Bible in Psalms,
[1:11:45] your word gave me life.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; I I don't if you want I can search it,
[1:11:53] but if you search, your word gave me
[1:11:55] life.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Your word gave me life. And we can say
[1:12:00] we can we can recognize there is not not
[1:12:03] a quality of life like in this message.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; If you go out is a chaos.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; But I love this message. This gives a
[1:12:12] standard to our kids,
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; to our families, to our relationships,
[1:12:17] to our everything.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; It's the highest form of life. Yeah,
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry for the kings from all the
[1:12:26] world, but they don't have this quality
[1:12:28] like you have it.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Because it's a quality of supernatural
[1:12:33] life.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; It's a qual. It's the life of God.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we feel a little bit humbled
[1:12:40] because we don't dress like them. We
[1:12:43] don't do things like them. But you
[1:12:45] should feel honored
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; because none of them have the quality of
[1:12:49] life that you have,
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; the quality of the family that you have.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; You don't when you leave home, you are
[1:12:55] not afraid. Oh, it will be a problem
[1:12:58] with my wife. You are you are in rest
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; because you know the message is built on
[1:13:04] trust.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; The message is built on on on the work
[1:13:07] of God. Amen.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; So Paul says, I come to present the plan
[1:13:13] of God. The full purpose full means that
[1:13:17] doesn't need to be adjusted. Full need
[1:13:21] full means completed.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; It's already done. It is finished. Full
[1:13:27] means ready.
[1:13:29] Full means ready.
[1:13:32] That's why Amen. Blessed be the name of
[1:13:35] the Lord. Amen. Sometimes we we we got a
[1:13:39] struggle and and say, "Oh, I have to be
[1:13:41] ready to receive the Holy Ghost. I have
[1:13:43] to be ready to be baptized. I have to
[1:13:46] make myself ready." But God needs you
[1:13:50] like he needed Mary because brother says
[1:13:53] in the church ages, the word will be in
[1:13:55] in the bride like what it was in Mary.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; How he became he stepped in Mary
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; by saying let it be according to thy
[1:14:06] word. Yeah.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Opening yourself completely,
[1:14:10] surrendering yourself to the word, it
[1:14:13] will change your life.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Don't try you to make because then when
[1:14:17] you go in heaven, you will you will
[1:14:19] expect a diploma.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; I made it.
[1:14:25] But we understand from the message, not
[1:14:27] you made it.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; He made it in you.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; That's why we sing he deserve all the
[1:14:32] glory and the honor because it's his
[1:14:34] work. It's his per purpose. It's his
[1:14:37] plan. It's he from the beginning to the
[1:14:40] end.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; So now it makes sense. He's the author
[1:14:43] and the finisher of our faith.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; There is no place for human
[1:14:47] intervention. There is no place to some
[1:14:50] to some unbelief because it's him from
[1:14:53] the beginning to the end.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, we ought to give him all the glory
[1:14:56] and honor. Yes sir.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; But uh Paul says in Acts 20:27,
[1:15:02] "For I have not shunned to declare unto
[1:15:06] you all the counsel of God." Another
[1:15:09] amplified Bible says, "For I did not
[1:15:11] shrink from declaring
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; to you the whole purpose and the plan of
[1:15:18] God."
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; We are living a declaration.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So a declaration
[1:15:26] a declaration is referring only to a a
[1:15:30] special category of people. That's
[1:15:32] right.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; For example, the declaration of Abraham
[1:15:36] Lincoln regarding the slavery, the
[1:15:40] emancipation of proclamation issued in
[1:15:42] January 1st one 1863 was uh which
[1:15:47] declared the enslaved people to be free.
[1:15:51] The declaration was made only for the
[1:15:54] people that that were in slavery.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; For in people in Romania, this
[1:16:00] declaration, oh, so you would say, oh,
[1:16:03] how nice it is. But it didn't really
[1:16:06] meant to us nothing.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; But for the people that were there in
[1:16:10] condition and the declaration came to
[1:16:12] them, it meant everything
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; because that made them free. And the
[1:16:18] declaration of the message
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; is is is not speaking to everybody. But
[1:16:24] if it spoke to you, that means it is for
[1:16:27] you.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; And he declared you. You are not just
[1:16:31] the church. You are a bride.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; And the bride is his wife. And his wife,
[1:16:38] he will share the glory with him. He
[1:16:41] will be together. We will reign together
[1:16:43] with him.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. A
[1:16:46] declaration given by so and and we want
[1:16:50] to consider a declaration is given by an
[1:16:53] authority.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; This message is the highest authority.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; So if the message declared you free
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; there is no higher authority to declare
[1:17:03] you different.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm happy. We are declared by
[1:17:08] the highest authority. It is finished.
[1:17:11] It's already done. the that the the the
[1:17:15] how is this song it's over it's already
[1:17:17] done amen blessed with the highest
[1:17:20] authority we have among us is the pillar
[1:17:23] of fire is the logos amen then is no one
[1:17:26] know how we are authority then brother
[1:17:28] says all hell is against this message
[1:17:30] but they cannot stop this message
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; they can try it but they cannot stop it
[1:17:35] because if if God is with us we have the
[1:17:39] majority hallelujah Oh, what a special
[1:17:43] people.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; They're in the White House. No such
[1:17:46] people like people people like you
[1:17:48] because they are from a human authority.
[1:17:50] They are from a country authority. But
[1:17:52] you was declared by a supernatural
[1:17:55] authority but by a not a tiny authority
[1:17:58] by an eternal authority. You was
[1:18:00] declared free.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is this this life that we
[1:18:06] are living. This is not your end.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; It's just the beginning. Brother Bram
[1:18:12] says you take with you the character.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; That's my let's let's don't fight
[1:18:18] against it. Let's say Lord let your
[1:18:21] character let your word be mold in the
[1:18:23] mangers of my heart.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Your
[1:18:27] journey start uh just starts in the in
[1:18:32] to eternity. But Abraham says, "We just
[1:18:35] made we just made eternity is like a is
[1:18:39] like a a circle. We just made a little
[1:18:43] going out
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; and the going in."
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; But the psalm says he is taking of your
[1:18:49] going out
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; and of your going in.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; There is something to be afraid. Is
[1:18:55] there is something to be scared? You
[1:18:58] know we cannot serve God by fear because
[1:19:00] if their fear we there is no love
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; because when you love a person if you if
[1:19:07] you if you fear that that person is
[1:19:09] doing something that's not anymore love
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; that's that's that's just a a contract
[1:19:16] you I do this and I give you this you
[1:19:19] know but our relationship is God is not
[1:19:22] is not is not uh is not based on a
[1:19:26] contract it's based on family. It's
[1:19:29] based on source. It's based on eternity.
[1:19:32] And we don't we don't love him because
[1:19:34] he will he will throw us in in hell. We
[1:19:36] love him. But Abraham just think what
[1:19:38] statement even if he puts me in hell, I
[1:19:41] will still love him.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; This means hell cannot stop the love to
[1:19:45] God.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; There is no Paul says there is nothing
[1:19:49] can separate.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; There is nothing can separate.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Tell tonight I cannot be separated from
[1:19:56] God. Amen.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Because I'm coming from him and I go
[1:19:58] back to him.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; I cannot be separated. I will go all the
[1:20:02] way.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; All the way.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name. All I will go
[1:20:06] all the way
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; because it's him. He cannot deny
[1:20:10] himself.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; He cannot deny me. Oh, blessed be the
[1:20:13] name of the Lord.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; So we we learn a declaration can be
[1:20:17] given by an authority.
[1:20:20] And to declare, Paul says, "I uh I I I"
[1:20:25] He says in in uh in Acts 20:27, uh he
[1:20:28] says, "I I didn't step back. I didn't I
[1:20:32] want I I come to declare the word
[1:20:35] purpose and the plan of God."
[1:20:39] So we have a declaration.
[1:20:42] You are free.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; You are not saved in one day. you always
[1:20:49] was saved.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; And if this declaration sets you free
[1:20:54] from all denomination thinking from all
[1:20:58] whatever it is, it set you free because
[1:21:01] we have saw the rising of the sun
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; and he that he he he was set free.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So I I
[1:21:12] imagine when these people what meant to
[1:21:15] them the declaration that declaration
[1:21:17] made them free that in January 1, 1863
[1:21:21] at the rising of the sun you will be
[1:21:24] free and they will they they were
[1:21:26] looking to the problem like no power
[1:21:29] anymore because the declaration had a
[1:21:32] stronger power than the power that was
[1:21:34] slaving them. So whatever there is no
[1:21:37] enough power in hell to stop the little
[1:21:40] bride because you are coming from a
[1:21:42] higher authority.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; So when these people saw the uh were
[1:21:47] looking to the calendar that they knew
[1:21:50] is coming a day when my declaration in
[1:21:53] is coming in full power and nobody could
[1:21:56] stop that declaration because it was
[1:21:58] given by the president of the country
[1:22:00] and there was no uh powerful man. He was
[1:22:05] he signed it
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; and our Lord Jesus signed at Calvary. He
[1:22:09] said it is done. It is finished and he
[1:22:13] is now resting on the full purpose and
[1:22:16] the full plan of God. He paid the price.
[1:22:20] He paid the price and the g the way back
[1:22:22] to the garden of Eden. It is open and
[1:22:26] now it is life. We are uniting together
[1:22:30] with the tree of life and he is coming
[1:22:32] in our in in our soul and there is a new
[1:22:36] invisible union taking place in you. Him
[1:22:40] and you are one.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:22:45] This is my story. This is your story.
[1:22:48] This is the bride story. The message is
[1:22:50] setting you free. That's why you cannot
[1:22:52] denominate this. You cannot put it in a
[1:22:55] box. You cannot put it because it's a
[1:22:57] it's a supernatural authority is coming.
[1:23:00] The angel said, "I'm coming from the
[1:23:03] presence of God."
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; This Oh, glory.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody says, "Praise the Lord."
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; So, we see we see Paul is coming to de
[1:23:14] to declare
[1:23:15] and and brother Rams said, "I want he he
[1:23:19] came to declare us." Amen. He came to
[1:23:22] declare. I love that. He says, "I saw
[1:23:25] you there."
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; He He declared the finished work of God.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. And we
[1:23:33] are we know that by his grace, we will
[1:23:36] be there.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says in Christ is the
[1:23:42] mystery of God revealed. The new birth
[1:23:46] is Christ is a revelation.
[1:23:50] God revealed to you this great mystery
[1:23:53] and that's a new birth.
[1:23:57] What are you going to do when you get
[1:24:00] all the group together? Where the
[1:24:02] revelation is perfectly in harmony and
[1:24:06] God expressing
[1:24:08] it through his word by the same actions,
[1:24:12] the same things he did making the word
[1:24:15] manifest. And brother Abraham says, "Oh,
[1:24:19] if the church only knew its position, it
[1:24:24] will one day."
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Is declared.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; It will one day.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; I'm included in that. I will one day.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; And
[1:24:35] and then brother Brand says, "Then the
[1:24:38] rapture will come."
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; No, he says, "Then the rapture will
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; go."
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:45] when it knows what it is.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; So we want to take a little time here.
[1:24:54] Then the rapture will go when it knows
[1:24:58] what it is. Sometimes you know we have a
[1:25:02] they made some movies with the rapture
[1:25:04] with planes flying and when this happens
[1:25:07] but the problem is we have to know what
[1:25:09] is the rapture. Abraham says the rapture
[1:25:12] will go when it knows what it is.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; God coming for his own.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; This is the rapture.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; And then you know that the rapture is
[1:25:25] already in you.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; You are the bride coming of Christ.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; The rapture is in you.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; That's why don't try to act as I I read
[1:25:37] the quote in in the beginning. We have a
[1:25:39] supernatural message. You cannot act
[1:25:41] like a natural with having a natural
[1:25:43] message because the people that have a
[1:25:46] natural message, they will stay.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; But if you have a supernal image, you
[1:25:50] have to go.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; So you are you cannot stop. You can
[1:25:54] greet them, but you are on your way from
[1:25:57] revelation to revelation.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; You cannot stay in the same condition.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; In the church ages,
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; that's all good. We need it. But we need
[1:26:06] something more.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need the message of the
[1:26:09] capstone. We the message of the of of of
[1:26:12] the uniting.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Because we are on the way to go.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; So don't don't stop and say this is
[1:26:21] enough.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Ask for more revelation.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; We need more of him. We need more of
[1:26:26] him. We need more of him.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; The rapture will go when it knows what
[1:26:30] it is.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; My what a privileged people we are.
[1:26:34] Amen.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; You know the the worst thing is to wait
[1:26:37] something and don't know what it is.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Like my daughter, I spoke with her this
[1:26:42] morning. What you what you bring me that
[1:26:44] she was agitated just I tell what what
[1:26:46] you know but when you I tell her she
[1:26:48] have an expectation she know what to
[1:26:51] wait for. She she is in peace because
[1:26:54] this is belong it just coming closer and
[1:26:56] closer closer to you.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; So the glory transformation belongs to
[1:27:02] you. It is given to you and it's coming
[1:27:05] coming closer.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Can you feel day by day we feel him
[1:27:09] closer?
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Abraham says when you
[1:27:12] recognize the message of the hour being
[1:27:16] eagle food you have heard from your
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; theophony.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my. What blessed be the name of the
[1:27:25] Lord. What a special people. The rapture
[1:27:28] will go.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; The rapture is in me.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; And the rapture cannot take place
[1:27:36] without you.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Because you know what it is. It's that
[1:27:41] part of God that will be taken.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; He cannot deny himself.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; If uh the BI Bible says in he says God
[1:27:53] is not a man to forget.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; He cannot forget you.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He always have you on his
[1:28:03] mind.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; That's why he is thinking at you all the
[1:28:07] time.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; He's thinking at you. You are precious
[1:28:12] in his sight. Oh glory. You know this
[1:28:15] message made us to to to to love him
[1:28:19] more.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Say Lord thank you. Lord thank you for
[1:28:22] what you done for me. Lord thank you for
[1:28:25] the revelation of the hour. Thank you
[1:28:27] for the word. Otherwise we would be just
[1:28:30] some wanderers uh longing for an
[1:28:32] experience and then after next week we
[1:28:35] would like to have another experience
[1:28:37] and when you look to this person oh they
[1:28:39] maybe have another oh we want like this
[1:28:41] we want like that but once you know what
[1:28:44] it is the rapture you know it is in you.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; You don't look anymore around you look
[1:28:51] to him.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And he is in you.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And all your expectation is not
[1:28:57] from an experience. All your expectation
[1:28:59] is from him
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; because he's the author and the
[1:29:03] finisher.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Expect from him. Expect from God.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; And he is coming your way.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. He says
[1:29:13] in future home of of uh of heavenly
[1:29:17] bridegroom and the earthly bride, you
[1:29:19] wasn't saved on one day.
[1:29:22] You you know if I would make I would
[1:29:23] come and make a testament you was not
[1:29:25] saved one day maybe you will see I agree
[1:29:28] or not agree but once we go through
[1:29:31] these steps then we say you know that's
[1:29:34] why we need revelation more and more of
[1:29:36] him because as he declares his word
[1:29:40] darkness go fade away and when is light
[1:29:43] coming light more and more light you can
[1:29:45] see and you can be presented the perfect
[1:29:47] plan of God blessed be the name of the
[1:29:49] lord
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; brother Abraham says In victory day
[1:29:52] 630421
[1:29:55] he says here
[1:29:59] he says now don't fail this to get this
[1:30:03] so we don't want to fail it when you
[1:30:06] have a trial or a test it shows the
[1:30:08] grace of God has found you have found
[1:30:11] favor with God and God believes that you
[1:30:15] will stand the test
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; sometimes you think Oh, it would be nice
[1:30:22] in the time of Paul or when we would
[1:30:24] leave in other church age just to go and
[1:30:27] maybe eat by a lion or just very fast.
[1:30:31] But you know
[1:30:34] God believes for you in this age.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; God believes that you will stand the
[1:30:40] test.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; So you are coming in this message is not
[1:30:44] by mistake.
[1:30:46] Your coming in this message have a
[1:30:48] purpose and it's not a purpose of a man.
[1:30:51] It's the purpose of God.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Just just think God believes that you
[1:30:56] will stand the test.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; And your coming and your outgoing is a
[1:31:01] test
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; because it's not your word or my word in
[1:31:06] in in the situation in the game. It's
[1:31:10] God's word.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; And God believes for his word. God
[1:31:15] believes that you will stand the test.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Now we understand 2 Timothy 2:13. If he
[1:31:24] we believe not yet he abide faithful
[1:31:27] because he cannot deny himself.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; You realizing that he is basically from
[1:31:34] the beginning to the end is his purpose
[1:31:37] is his it is him in us. Christ in us the
[1:31:43] hope of glory.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:31:48] What Abraham says in the rapture, "And
[1:31:49] if Christ is in you, he can't deny his
[1:31:53] own word."
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; So let's read it once again. If Christ
[1:31:58] is in you, he can't deny his own word.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; That means Christ believes in you.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. don't try you to believe because
[1:32:08] this is with mathematic
[1:32:11] physic it always try to put things
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; and sometimes
[1:32:17] one day say now I believe the message
[1:32:18] and tomorrow some newcomers oh now how
[1:32:22] it is
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; you know this is human flesh
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; but brother says if Christ is in you he
[1:32:29] can't deny his own word
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; that's why your faith cannot Stop
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; because Christ you cannot stop because
[1:32:38] light you cannot stop.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; How darkness is how strong is the is the
[1:32:43] night when the sun in full authority
[1:32:45] comes.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; The night is running.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; And one of these days this this darkness
[1:32:53] have to run around us
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; because the sun
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; he's coming in full in full power. He's
[1:33:01] coming in full authority.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. at all by the Bible says by one
[1:33:08] second we will be changed.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; The problem is the change is not
[1:33:14] starting from from outside.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; It's starting from inside
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; and you cannot if you see a woman that
[1:33:23] is waiting a baby, you cannot see from
[1:33:26] outside only after later.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; But she knows
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; in her that she
[1:33:33] is carrying a seed.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; You you not always have a proof outside
[1:33:39] you
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; but you have the proof inside. Is him
[1:33:43] that who does the work. It's him that
[1:33:46] believes this message.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; It's not an an external experience. It's
[1:33:53] an internal experience.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; God is uniting with his bride.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Father
[1:34:01] Abraham says in Jehovah Gyra
[1:34:04] what you scared about.
[1:34:08] He says if we are Abraham's seed it is a
[1:34:11] finished product. Those who he forneew
[1:34:14] he called. Those who he called he
[1:34:17] justified. Those who he has justified he
[1:34:20] has already glorified.
[1:34:22] What are you scared about?
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; And I I will I will jump. But but he
[1:34:29] says here, this is just God's seed
[1:34:34] materializing.
[1:34:36] That's all. His words coming down.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; I love this quote.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Not a word of a man.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; God's word coming down.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; He spoke it
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; and he found place in me.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] So
[1:34:55] human understand human
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; uh sheep understand sheep
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; God understand God
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; God speak to a man they don't understand
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; because it's not the same level
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; God understand God
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; attribute to attribute
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; that's why Christ is speaking to you and
[1:35:19] you understand his words
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; because he understand himself self
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; because he cannot deny himself.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 55:11 says, "So shall my word be
[1:35:31] go forth out of my mouth. It shall not
[1:35:35] return unto me void."
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; You have not a half salvation. You have
[1:35:41] a full salvation.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; But it shall accomplish that which I
[1:35:45] please, and it shall prosper in the
[1:35:48] thing where I I sent it.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not here because you want
[1:35:53] it. You are here because you was sent.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; And if if he sent you, say, Lord, this
[1:36:02] morning, please strength me.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Please help me to press on because all I
[1:36:09] want is to please your desire.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; It was your desire to be in this
[1:36:14] generation. Lord, help me go all the
[1:36:18] way. Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; And he he loves when we
[1:36:23] we recognize that he is from the
[1:36:26] beginning to the end.
[1:36:28] He always tried to show Israel and tell
[1:36:31] Moses, Moses, why you are they are
[1:36:33] crying, not I have brought you out, not
[1:36:37] I will take you in. Don't try to make
[1:36:40] your own. Rely on me. Trust in me.
[1:36:44] God wanted
[1:36:47] God. Brother Bram says you give God a
[1:36:50] purpose.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we take the in one of the
[1:36:54] quotes brother says give the chance to
[1:36:57] God. Sometimes we don't give chance to
[1:36:59] God. say I want to make but this morning
[1:37:02] you say Lord many times I took your
[1:37:04] chance from my family from my life but
[1:37:07] this morning I want to give all that I
[1:37:10] have to you all my situations my
[1:37:12] conditions all that I have you are all
[1:37:16] that I need
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; you are my only only refuge
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; I was listening this morning future home
[1:37:25] of heavenly bridegroom the heavenly
[1:37:27] bride and brother Abraham said did you
[1:37:29] Ever think now bride that I what it will
[1:37:33] look like it is prepared and designed by
[1:37:37] the divine architect.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; I like this.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; I said that spoke to my heart. Divine
[1:37:43] architect.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; It's not a natural architect.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; It's a divine architect.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:37:51] Aren't you happy this morning?
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:54] As we we go closer to the end, we I just
[1:37:57] want to close with the Kingsman
[1:37:58] redeemer. And when a man loves a woman
[1:38:03] and marries her because she's just
[1:38:05] pretty,
[1:38:07] there will be an end to that.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; So sometimes,
[1:38:13] Amen. If you have reasons to trust God,
[1:38:19] lay the Bible says, lay all your
[1:38:22] reasonings down
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; and look to him,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; the author and the finisher of your
[1:38:27] faith.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; And brother Abraham says, "But when a
[1:38:31] man finds a woman that he loves,
[1:38:36] he don't know why."
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; But loves her.
[1:38:43] You don't know why you follow this
[1:38:45] message. You don't know why what beliefs
[1:38:48] were.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Why why you believe it? You don't have a
[1:38:51] reason.
[1:38:53] I I believe because I think you there is
[1:38:58] something more to it.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Don't put I I will I will continue. He
[1:39:04] says he don't know why. In in other
[1:39:07] words, you don't have and I say it in in
[1:39:10] in respect, but you don't have a natural
[1:39:13] proof.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; You don't have it.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; You just cannot explain it, but it's in
[1:39:19] you.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; And she finds a man that she loves no
[1:39:28] matter how he looks like. He loves her.
[1:39:31] She loves him. That's an eternal mate in
[1:39:35] glory. Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; This is the response
[1:39:39] between your relationship with the
[1:39:41] message. You are an etern eternal made
[1:39:44] in glory with Christ to the world.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; That or nothing else can ever separate
[1:39:52] them.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; You because you cannot God separate God
[1:39:58] because then he is not God.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:02] that earth can never separate them
[1:40:05] because they are from eternity
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; and they stepped out in a space of time
[1:40:12] and will return back to eternity.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Eternity has dropped down in a body
[1:40:17] called time then goes back right back up
[1:40:20] into eternity. It cannot perish.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Your relationship with God, it cannot
[1:40:26] perish. If the magicians can come up
[1:40:30] your
[1:40:32] family relationship with God, it cannot
[1:40:34] perish
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; because it's not based on natural
[1:40:38] things. That's right.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; It's not based on experience. It's based
[1:40:42] on the finished work of God.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; It's based on what God did.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; And God, he says in in in Luke, will he
[1:40:53] find faith?
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:58] He is find searching for faith.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; He's in other means in other words
[1:41:07] he's searching for himself.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; That's why faith is included in him.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Faith it is a part of him.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; He's searching for his own.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; That's why you have rapturing faith.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; It is in you.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you didn't know
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; till the voice of the mama eagle cried
[1:41:28] out
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; and told you you can fly.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; You can you can
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; you can uh overcome gravitation.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Nobody thinks that we can do it but in
[1:41:43] you lace
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; a special uh ability. One day you will
[1:41:49] step out
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; and you can be overcome gravitation.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Nothing can hold you down.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Things that now looks hard on your life,
[1:42:03] this cannot hold down you.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Because you have a a different author
[1:42:08] and a finisher
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; of your faith.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; And this is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him this morning?
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Don't you find rest in him?
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Don't you find peace in him?
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Can you sing this song? He's all I need.
[1:42:23] Is that true?
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; He's all we need.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Many times we think we need a lot of
[1:42:29] things, but the response to eternity is
[1:42:33] him.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; The response to your troubles is him.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; He's all all I need.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when when you make him the
[1:42:42] king of your life when he you make him
[1:42:46] he's taking responsibility and say I
[1:42:50] will take everything
[1:42:53] I will take care my child just tell me
[1:42:56] that I am all I need and you gave him
[1:43:01] the highest possibility to take to take
[1:43:04] care of you. Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; So don't want you just surrender to him
[1:43:08] and say Lord from this day on you are
[1:43:12] all I need.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; You are all my answers. You are all my
[1:43:17] conditions is you. And in order to make
[1:43:21] the rapture is you.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; You are all I need. May the Lord bless
[1:43:26] you all. Shalom. Shalom. Brother Chad.
[1:43:30] He is all
[1:43:33] I need.
[1:43:35] He is all
[1:43:38] I need.
[1:43:42] Jesus
[1:43:44] is all
[1:43:46] I need.
[1:43:51] He all
[1:43:54] I need.
[1:43:57] He all
[1:43:59] I need.
[1:44:03] Jesus
[1:44:05] is all
[1:44:07] I need.
[1:44:10] Once more.
[1:44:12] He all
[1:44:15] I need.
[1:44:17] He all
[1:44:20] I need.
[1:44:24] Jesus
[1:44:26] is all
[1:44:28] I need.
[1:44:33] He's all
[1:44:36] I need.
[1:44:38] He all
[1:44:41] I need.
[1:44:44] Jesus
[1:44:47] is all
[1:44:49] I need.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad he's all you need?
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz he is everything. He's all in all.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Are you encouraged?
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; You encouraged to face the day. You
[1:45:05] encouraged to keep pressing on because
[1:45:07] it's all him
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; and he cannot deny himself. I was so
[1:45:11] blessed by the word today. So thankful
[1:45:13] that God sent our brother our way. Amen.
[1:45:15] I needed a boost of encouragement. And I
[1:45:17] need to be reminded this really isn't
[1:45:19] about you and I. It's about him.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. from the beginning to the end.
[1:45:24] He's the author and he's the finisher,
[1:45:26] the completer, the perfector of our
[1:45:28] faith. Amen. I loved what the brother
[1:45:31] said. He said something early on that
[1:45:32] blessed me. Said God is not coming for
[1:45:35] volunteers.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we feel like we did a
[1:45:40] good thing because, you know, we said,
[1:45:41] "I I'll do it." Listen, he didn't come
[1:45:43] to to He didn't come to all the women in
[1:45:45] Israel say, "Anybody volunteer to be a
[1:45:47] virgin bride?" He came to the one he
[1:45:48] already predestinated.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he wasn't waiting for Esau and
[1:45:53] Jacob to see which one would volunteer.
[1:45:54] He said, "No, I've already chosen uh uh
[1:45:57] uh uh Jacob and not Esau." Amen. He
[1:46:00] wasn't coming for volunteers. He was
[1:46:02] coming to his own, the one he
[1:46:03] predestinated. And he wasn't asking you
[1:46:05] to volunteer one day, I'll volunteer to
[1:46:07] be bride. He already chose you to be
[1:46:09] bride.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember brother Abraham Myra
[1:46:13] said one time and he said, he goes, "I'm
[1:46:15] not a pastor. I'm not a preacher." Amen.
[1:46:17] Because I wanted to be. He goes, "I'm a
[1:46:19] victim of God's will.
[1:46:22] Hey, listen. I'm so happy to be part of
[1:46:24] God's bride that we're a victim of his
[1:46:26] will. He chose, Amen. before the
[1:46:29] foundation of the world. And I'm happy
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; and thankful.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what happens to
[1:46:35] volunteers in war, they start deserting
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; when it gets too bad.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's good we didn't
[1:46:42] volunteer because when the battle gets
[1:46:44] hot and heavy, we might desert. But we
[1:46:46] didn't volunteer. He volunteered us.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; He chose us. And I'm so glad that he who
[1:46:51] started a work, he's going to finish the
[1:46:54] work.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; The other statement that he made that I
[1:46:56] wrote down quickly that blessed me so
[1:46:58] much and brother Benham said, "All hell
[1:47:01] is against this revelation."
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; The revelation of who the bride really
[1:47:06] is. The revelation, the message came to
[1:47:08] peel back the amnesia so that we can see
[1:47:11] the plan of God.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Said, "All hell is against this
[1:47:14] revelation." But then he said, "Look
[1:47:15] around. You're all believing it. That
[1:47:18] means you're already resisting all of
[1:47:20] hell.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; All the power of hell can't stop you
[1:47:25] from believing what all hell is against,
[1:47:27] but you believe it anyways. So the
[1:47:29] revelation inside each one of us that's
[1:47:31] a gift from God is more powerful than
[1:47:34] all the power of hell already.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amenise
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; by what? By grace.
[1:47:43] You are saved by grace through faith.
[1:47:46] And that is not of yourself. That is a
[1:47:49] gift of God. I'm so thankful. And
[1:47:52] brother Brandham said, "And this
[1:47:54] revelation is the bride stand." She's
[1:47:56] not standing on her strength. She's not
[1:47:58] standing on her abilities. She's not
[1:47:59] standing on her works. She's just
[1:48:01] standing on this revelation of who he is
[1:48:04] and what he's done and who we are in
[1:48:07] him.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. All he's asked us to do is just
[1:48:10] trust him. God is good.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's bow our heads and thank
[1:48:15] the Lord for the word today. Lord Jesus,
[1:48:17] I'm so thankful for for all that you
[1:48:19] spoke.
[1:48:21] And God, I'm so thankful that we don't
[1:48:25] have to look to the natural for proof or
[1:48:27] evidence,
[1:48:28] but God, this is a supernatural message.
[1:48:32] And you've given us the faith to
[1:48:33] believe. It's your faith planted in our
[1:48:37] souls because you cannot deny yourself.
[1:48:41] God, I'm so thankful, Lord, that we're
[1:48:43] not looking to anything temporary or
[1:48:46] weak like ourselves and our own flesh,
[1:48:48] our ability to choose, our willpower to
[1:48:51] stay to it. Lord, our mind, Lord, we're
[1:48:54] not depending on any of that because
[1:48:55] that's all weak. That's all natural.
[1:48:59] But Lord, what we're depending on is an
[1:49:01] eternal guarantee
[1:49:03] from an author, a manufacturer that has
[1:49:06] a reputation that your product will
[1:49:08] never fail.
[1:49:10] Lord, your product of predestination, of
[1:49:12] grace, of faith, your plan, Lord, from
[1:49:16] before the foundation of the world,
[1:49:17] it'll never fail. It has an eternal
[1:49:20] guarantee.
[1:49:21] And so now we can not have we can we can
[1:49:24] rest and let anxiety just go away
[1:49:28] because Lord, it'll never fail. Your
[1:49:30] plan will never fail. Your purpose will
[1:49:32] never fail. But you've given us a
[1:49:35] guarantee. And we have faith in you, the
[1:49:39] author and the finisher of our faith.
[1:49:42] You started it, you'll finish it. You
[1:49:46] didn't ask us to start it. You didn't
[1:49:47] ask us to stay stay in it. You didn't
[1:49:49] ask us to finish it. You just asked us
[1:49:52] to believe. And it's even you in us
[1:49:55] believing.
[1:49:57] God, help us to rest in what you've
[1:49:59] done. Help us to rejoice in what you've
[1:50:02] done. Help us to walk with a smile on
[1:50:04] our face every day. For we know within
[1:50:07] us the secret of your predestinated plan
[1:50:10] and the power of the supernatural.
[1:50:13] And God, may you grant us greater
[1:50:15] revelation day by day. That the natural
[1:50:18] eyesight would give way to the spiritual
[1:50:21] eyesight. That by revelation, by the
[1:50:23] gift of revelation, we will see more
[1:50:25] clearly every day this plan that you've
[1:50:28] unveiled, that you've unfolded. Lord,
[1:50:30] may it be Isab in our eyes. So our
[1:50:32] vision can become 2020 crystal clear
[1:50:35] that we can see what has always been and
[1:50:37] what always will be. And God, may there
[1:50:40] we rest and rejoice and abide. We love
[1:50:45] you. We thank you for all you've done.
[1:50:47] We pray you bless our brother Ruben and
[1:50:49] his home church, his family, and
[1:50:51] everyone. Lord, that you'd watch over
[1:50:53] him in the rest of his travels and as he
[1:50:55] goes home and this afternoon as he
[1:50:56] ministers to the youth. Pray that you
[1:50:58] use him once again. and and may you
[1:50:59] replenish his strength and may you bless
[1:51:01] him for you've used him to bless us. And
[1:51:04] while we thank you for this morning and
[1:51:06] for this time, may we walk out of here
[1:51:08] encouraged and strengthened by the
[1:51:10] revelation of the word. And may we be
[1:51:12] more yielded than we've ever been before
[1:51:15] and that more surrendered than we've
[1:51:17] ever been before that you might do the
[1:51:19] work that you've left for this day that
[1:51:21] you might do it in us. We love you. We
[1:51:24] thank you, God, and ask for your
[1:51:26] blessings over all that was said. In
[1:51:28] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends.

[1:51:38] I need.
