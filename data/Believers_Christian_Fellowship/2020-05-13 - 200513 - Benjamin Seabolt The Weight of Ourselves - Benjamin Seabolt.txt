TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] when when i found the joy of reaching your heart when my will becomes enthralled in your love when all things that surround shadows is is [Music] as brother ben comes let's just sing this song lord my heart is open won't you come inside fill up all my [Applause] i is is foreign day praise the lord it's good to be here with you this evening we encountered a great privilege and a great honor i'd rather be in my seat but you all know how that works but i was just thinking as we were singing that song that is really dangerous words to say to the lord that you've opened all the windows and you've opened all the doors and come inside it's very dangerous words to say to the lord unless you mean it because when you say that he'll do it and we better be prepared for him to do that so but we know that we're gathered with a group of people that can say that from their heart and they can say that and that can mean that uh regardless of the the pain and the consequences and the inconveniences that that might cause them that that's truly their heart's desire so let's take our bibles and let's turn to psalm 19 thank you musicians we'll read a portion of scripture here and then let you have your seats just happen to be in the house of the lord this evening i have a thought here that i would like to present for the sake of a title we're going to call it uh the weight of ourselves and we'll maybe that'll be a little bit more clear to you once we get to these other scriptures but the the title would be the weight of our self and psalm 19 verse 14 just one verse here says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer let's just pray together precious lord jesus we just want to pause here a moment and thank you once again for this privilege to be here lord father we hold these times very dear and even more so as time would go on and they would be more sacred to us father may we never take it for granted that we would be able to gather together and to be able to see each other lord and to physically gather around your word lord we would just ask now that as we would come to this great juncture of the service father lord we stand here as a man that is completely incapable of doing what's been tasked with doing lord there is nothing good within myself father there is no capabilities there's no intellect there's nothing that i have to present to the people to help them or to encourage them lord but we just come here based on your word and based upon a gift that you've placed lord and we just ask for you to come and have the preeminence and do that which only you can do lord for it's only the lamb that can take the book and to and to loose the seals father lord we just stand here as a vessel and nothing more so we just asked that you would come and take the preeminence and both the speaker and the hearer and that your supernatural divine purpose for this service will be accomplished here this evening we commit ourselves to you with thanksgiving in jesus christ's name the bride says amen god bless you as you would have your seat so if you look at this portion of scripture i started to title this god don't stutter but i thought that might sound a little redneck so i didn't title with that but the psalm here says let the words of my mouth end so we immediately go to a conjunction so it says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord so we realize that if that is the prayer that david is having here he's saying let the meditation of my uh let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable that means that you can actually have the right words coming out of your mouth with a wrong heart and you can fool a lot of people with that you might even fool yourself with that but you can't fool him with that so david recognizes this paradox that he's in and he's he's offering a sincere prayer to the lord that i don't want to just talk right i don't want to just act right i don't want to just look right but i want to be right and i want my heart to be right because as much as a paradox is having the right words coming out of your mouth with a wrong heart it's even more of a paradox you can have the right heart and everything else be wrong and you'll still be okay the heart is the important part and the heart is what only god can get to a minister can stand here he can present the word he can present the message but the heart is something only god can get to we can fool each other we can fool the minister but we we can't fool god and if we're his seed we're not going to fool ourselves he's going to let us know something's off and this is you know this is heart heart surgery as a figure of speech but i guess it's applicable physically as well but this is this is a heart surgery of heart surgeries because again you can set under the inspired preaching of the word and you can look right and you can act right and you can even do right but yet your heart won't be right and only you will know that and that would be an awful condition to be in and only you would know that unless there is a gift that god would allow to come and speak to you to make that known a gift of discernment or a word of knowledge or whatever the case may be unless god would supernaturally come and bring that to your attention to let you know you're not fooling everybody you could set in that condition so we have we have to look at this very seriously because at the end of the day if we're counting on anybody else but ourselves to get us right it's not going to work because it's going to come to the point in time here i go with the doomsday preaching already i made it about five minutes so i'm improving but it's going to come to the point in time saints that we're not going to have somebody to lean on it's going to be an individual affair it's going to be an individual walk we're not going to be able to run and cry to the pastor we're not going to be able to run and cry to another minister we may not even be able to run and cry to our spouse it's going to come to that time and david i think recognizes this and that's why he's saying lord don't just let the words of my mouth be right but let the meditation of my heart be right because david knows if he can get to that point that he's going to be just fine so let's skip over let's skip back brother to genesis 26 and i want to look at a couple scriptures here i'll just be you know very very opaque with you and and very clear with you this evening i've got two scriptures that i know that he wants me to tie together and after that whatever happens happens um so we may be here for 15 minutes we may be here for three hours i don't know but i know that we're supposed to tie these two scriptures together and the rest of it's up to you all so i would present that as a challenge um you know i'm not here with an agenda i'm not here to present a thought to you or to teach you something if you have a need from the lord tonight get it um that's that's all that i can say so um you know i stand here and and i'll do my best but you know sometimes sometimes it's very clear what we're to teach and what what percent and sometimes that does take three hours you all are we're aware with me but you know it's sometimes it's just the direct opposite of that sometimes you have a a couple of scriptures and and you just have to go with that so we'll tie these together and uh and see what happens but in genesis 26 verse 12 we know this story very very familiar because it it speaks directly of us and our age we know this is elegies are going to fetch a bride for isaac but in verse 12 it says and he said oh lord this is eliezer speaking o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham you'll notice the intent that eliezer begins with he's he is asking something of god but he's not asking it for himself i wonder sometimes if our prayers aren't answered because we're always praying for ourself brother branham says a gifts not even for the person with the gift but the gift he said his gift was for other people he said the same thing about jesus that he was there to serve other people he says eternal life was living for others i'm not saying we can't pray for ourself we should pray for ourselves i do quite a bit of it but i'm just wondering if there's not another channel that we should get into and eliezer is is representing that channel here to us he is coming with a purpose he is coming speaking to god but he's not even wanting anything for himself he's wanting something for his master abraham so you'll notice that not only are the words coming out out of his mouth correct but the meditation of his heart is correct this is not a selfish desire to be quite frank if eliezer was selfish he wouldn't have been one he wouldn't have been wanting to find a wife for isaac because that diminishes his portion in the scripture if he would really think about that this is a suicide mission because once he finds the bride for isaac he's done it you'll notice eliezer didn't have a problem with that he wanted what his master wanted and that was his prayer show kindness unto my master abraham behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy picture i pray thee that i may drink and she shall she shall say drink and i will give thy camel's drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for my servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou has showed kindness unto my master and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebecca came out who was born to bethel son of milka this the wife of nahor abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder and the damsel was very fair to look upon i want to stop here for a second go back to this first thing this uh this verse 15. i find this amazing that but as and it came to pass before he had done speaking i mean this is a this is a channel saints this is actually a millennial channel because in the millennium we know that as we would think something and before we would speak it the need would be met look at the position that he is in before he even finishes his prayer before he's done speaking this these things start coming into action and this bride presents itself and i would say that to bring attention to a fact that we have to be very careful of how we view the people that's went before us because we know as we're coming down to the very last closing seconds of time that there's been generations before us that never walked in the fullness of the message they had they received portions of the message coming down but they never they don't see what we see and some of them went off the scene by by way of the grave but you'll notice that god cared for those people so much that he put their place in the scripture here because there was a people on the face of this earth that before our prophet got done speaking before his ministry ended they were believing him and they were walking with him and they were acting with that and god cared so much about that that he put that nugget in there because it would have been just as easy for the scripture to say and after he got done speaking that rebecca showed up but god laid that in there for that generation that went before us so let's not be critical of that let's recognize that for what it was and be thankful for what it was because no matter what weight that generation carried before us even if it was just a slight weight of holding that message up it's allowed us to be in the position that we're in and that was important to god so much so that he would lay that type in there and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her picture and came up and this is the scripture that i'm basing all of this on that was just really caught my attention because whenever i see redundancies in the scripture i know that god don't stutter and he's saying something for a reason so it comes here to verse 16 and it says the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her so it begs the question what's the difference if no man's known her she's a virgin if she's a virgin no man has known her so is god just filling up ink blots on paper does he stutter does he think we need to hear it twice or is there something he's wanting to catch our attention with let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord so we know that we're rebecca in this situation so as rebecca is coming to this well she is in she is in a certain condition and this is the same condition that we as the bride of jesus christ must be in in order to have to meet isaac and to go into the marriage to be even called by the messenger to be accepted by the messenger and the condition that she came to that well in was she was fair to look upon she was a virgin and no man had known her obviously there's children present we're in a mixed audience i don't want to go into graphic details there but it obviously shows that a person that a woman can be a virgin and be known by a man think about how awful that would be you come you get married to a lady you're there your first week you go out to a restaurant and she orders whatever her favorite is the guy sits down on the table next to you and he says oh i'm gonna make up a name so susie i see that chicken and dumplings is still your favorite he already knows something about your wife see what i'm saying that this woman is already known by another man and we can go through a list of examples i'm not going to go through that but it may be what her favorite collar is it may be whether she likes daisies or daffodils it may be whatever whatever the case may be but the point is rebecca was not in this condition rebecca was not a flirter rebecca was a virgin and she had not flirted with any other man there was no other man that knew her there was no other worldly entertainment that knew her she was a virgin and no man had known her satan did not know what her vices were satan did not know what her weaknesses were she was in a pristine condition she had not been out flirting with the world she had not been out flirting with anything else she was in a pristine condition awaiting the arrival of the messenger that would introduce her to her husband so we can we notice here that there is there can be a difference because obviously the the virginity that is that's a physical physical act so even besides of a physical act that woman can be known and like i said what a condition that would be for a man to take to take a wife and every every man in the community knows every all of her secrets and everything about her and what she likes and what she don't like known by everybody in the community but yet physically technically a virgin see this is the point that david was getting at with his prayer david didn't want to be in any type of condition like that he wanted his words to be right he wanted his his heart to be right he wanted to look right he wanted to act right and he wanted to be right and he didn't want all of everything on the surface being okay and underneath being full of adultery being known by every vice that came along by every tactic of the devil that came along by every little switch and sway he wanted to be in a pristine condition so i feel that this is this was laid in the scripture purposely because if you'll go to hebrews 12 with me hebrews 12 and verse 1 you'll see that paul picks this very thought up so we've seen it in psalms we've seen it in genesis but now we come we come to hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 and it says wherefore seeing we also are encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god so there in verse 1 you see paul picks up this same thought and he says not let's not just lay aside every sin that besets us but he says let's lay aside every weight so now because he's differentiating between this we can realize that you can be in a sin free condition but yet completely weighted down completely weighted down by the cares of the world completely weighted down by yourself and that's where my title it came from because you know this is a this is a good scripture to preach holiness on right i mean we could take this scripture and just you know as they say shuck the corn with it you know preach preach holiness good but that's that's not my intention here my intention here is i want you to look at these scriptures because i think it's important as we move forward we have to understand what's going on with us because i am thoroughly convinced that i'm standing before a group of people who is not interested in sin but yet your trials you and i both know your trials and your tribulations are getting heavier and heavier and harder and harder and more precise and more precise to your breaking point why is that if you are free from sin because paul says let us lay aside every weight that so easily besets us and the sin he's he paul is wanting us to recognize that there there is a condition that we can come to as sin free and we know as we know that that is just unbelief we can believe the word we can be living the word we can be acting the word we can be talking the word but yet within ourselves within our dna with our within our genetic hybrid makeup there can be weights within that that can beset us and that can keep us from manifesting what christ is wanting us to manifest and that can keep us out of the pristine condition that rebecca was in so this is this is not you know a scripture that i want to take and start hacking you know hacking holiness and you know hacking away at chris or christianity and you know you know making you feel condemned or bad that's that's not my intention here my intention is just to make us recognize that there's two parts there there is two parts and i'm convinced as i said that i'm with a group of people who's not interested in living in sin i'm convinced that i'm with a group of people who is seeking out any sin that would be in their life and quickly repenting of that and getting that out of the way but yet things just get tougher and tougher and harder and harder so we have to we have to stop and we have to recognize what is that that's pressing on us if it's not sin what is it that's pressing on us and i wonder sometimes if that's not simply the weight of our self the weight of our genetic the weight of hybridization as it came has come down through our family trees and understand that these weights these weights may have very some of them may have very good qualities for certain situations certain situations that quality that is there in your genetics and in your dna can be very beneficial but yet in another situation it can be absolutely detrimental and that's why we've got to come back to david's prayer to let the meditation of my heart be acceptable because we've got to recognize that something that with within us in our makeup can be right and it can be right and it can be right and god can use it here and he can use it here and he can use it here and then all of a sudden there'll come a situation here and we'll find ourselves beating our head against the wall because we've leaned to our genetic makeup because we've seen it work and we've seen god use it and there's nothing wrong with it it's not sinful it's simply the weight of our self and god is going to make sure that he strips that away from us so that we do not lean on any of that and that we lean solely on him and that it's by revelation that we're leaning on him not past experience so paul clearly differentiates that there is a difference there and he's and he's doing that so that we would know see our again the situation we find ourselves in is unlike any other because it's it's not just enough to overcome this age and to overcome laodicea we are in a position that we have to overcome ourself even in a sinless condition you understand what i'm saying when i say a sinless condition we know that we're in hybridization and we're going to fight that till the day that our atoms change but as far as a desire for sin or a desire to do to do wrong or being okay with that that is not there but we've got to move a step farther and we have got to examine ourselves and again that's going to be limited from a minister that's going to be limited of how god can do that that's going to be an individual examination and that's the only way that it'll work let's go to ephesians 5 27 and you'll see this trend continue in the scripture ephesians 5 verse 27 says that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle why is it so important that it don't have a spot or a wrinkle why isn't it okay just to be spot-free i mean if i come to you and i say brother brother and sister you are spot-free you would probably feel pretty good about yourself right but then i say but you're full of wrinkles well you just told me i was spot free but you're full of wrinkles but the scripture differentiates so it's almost one of those things it's like i'm just never good enough i'm completely spot-free i stand before god i mean how many would like to have that testimony i stand before god completely spot-free and he says good job now go iron out the wrinkles that's the point that we're called to and that wrinkle is not a spot the spot is a sin the spot is a blemish the spot is something wrong that needs cleaned out the wrinkle how do you get a wrinkle in a garment by not using it that's the only way to get a wrinkle in a garment if you're wearing that garment the wrinkles are going to fade out the reason we get wrinkles is our faith is not an action the word is not in action the word is not being worn on a daily basis it's been folded up and put in a drawer somewhere and it gets wrinkles that shirt may be spotless no ketchup on it no mustard no baby slobbers but if it's tucked away folded up nice and neat in a drawer what good is it and when you get that shirt out in a spotless condition it has wrinkles in it that don't bother me might bother some of you but in a spiritual sense that bothers god because he says i will have a church without spot blemish without a desire for sin without sin in their lives without flirting with the world and she will be without wrinkle she will be manifesting my word she will not just be talking about it she will not just be acting like it she will be wearing it on a daily basis there's only one thing that gets wrinkles out and that's heat i'll take that back there's two things heat and pressure heat and pressure so i want to go back to what i was saying earlier this is not to condemn anybody this is not to rip anybody up one side and down into the other this is to maybe help you understand what is going on and what is going to keep going on and get more intense with your individual walk god is going to get the wrinkles out and that is going to be heat and that is going to be pressure and you will be in a sinless condition when the heat and the pressure comes what that's going to do is two things it's going to drive you to your knees and you are going to make sure you don't have any spots on you and then you're going to want god to deal with whatever wrinkle that is and you're going to want him to iron that out as quickly as possible because the longer the iron sets on there the hotter it gets and the more pressure it gets that does not mean that you are in a sinful condition just because you are dealing with heat and pressure in your individual walk you may be perfectly spotless before god and god is simply wanting to get a wrinkle out of that hybrid nature that has come down through your tree that may not even be any fault of your own and confusing as it is that he may be able to use nine out of ten situations for his glory and it will be automatic to you and you'll never even think about it but in this situation you'll lean on automatic and you'll lean on your your condition your genetic condition and it's not him doing it it's just your genetic makeup and he won't tolerate that that's not what he's after what he's after is a complete surrender from each and every one of us that he is doing everything in every situation so he will deal with those wrinkles and a wrinkle i can't emphasize is enough a wrinkle is not a spot so when the heat and the pressure comes i'm not saying that we shouldn't go to our knees and we shouldn't check our life because we should we should but after we have checked our lives and we've made sure there's not a spot there quit dumping bleach on a wrinkle it's not going to work you don't need two drops of the blood of jesus christ one drop will suffice don't question do not question the integrity of your heart once you've checked it and once you've covered that with the blood brother branham says so many times we get confused that it's god punishing us about stuff and it's not that at all he's simply as with job he was simply wanting job to ask him a question job went through all of that because god wanted to ask him a ques he wanted god wanted job to ask him a question i mean that's mind-boggling to us but everything job went to was to get him to the point that he would ask that question of the god so it wasn't that job backslid it wasn't that job got out in sin job knew where he stood we should be the same second peter 3 14 it says wherefore beloved seem that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless without spot and blameless john 14 verse 14 if ye shall ask anything in my name i will do it and if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you why is it with you good enough why does he have to be in you or does god stutter he dwelleth with you and he will be and he shall be in you with you is not good enough saints with you is not good enough if you'll go back to genesis you don't have to turn there but if you'll go back to genesis that is actually the condition eve was in because the scripture says that she took and she gave also to her husband with her adam being with eve did not keep her adam had to be in eve that was the only thing that would prevented that so now jesus comes and he picks this thought up this principle up and he gives us a word for it because these conditions that we've just listed here of rebecca being a virgin neither had any man known her laying aside every sin and every weight being without spot without wrinkle being blameless these are not something that's going to be accomplished with him just being with us this is only going to be accomplished by him being in us you can look right act right and talk right if he's with you but your heart will never be right unless he is in it and you may be the only one that knows that but he's given us a word to meet the challenge he has given us a way to make that work i will be with you even in you first john 3 18 says my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth and hereby we know that we are of truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us not or i'm sorry for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards god and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight this is a condition given to answered prayers if your heart condemn you not then we have confidence towards god this is the scripture brother branham picks up um or the thought that brother branham picks up in perfect faith he says and now we're going to turn to mark saint mark the 11th chapter and we're going to begin to read about the 22nd verse of the 11th chapter of saint mark and many of you know this scripture it's very familiar it was the scripture i was thinking on when those squirrels when he said to me about those squirrels those was the very scripture i was thinking about it's been a puzzle he said if ye say not if i say but if you say now let me read jesus answering said unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall doubt and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he ask therefore i say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses now faith this is brother brandon speaking now faith is based on forgiveness then so we just we just had a teaching on how faith worketh by love but faith which works by love is based on forgiveness how profound that is and it ties right into that scripture if our heart condemner condemn us not then we have confidence see if we have spots on our life we're not going to have confidence towards god we have to get the spots out of our life we have to get the blemishes out of our life we have to allow him to get those out of our life but when it comes to wrinkles that are in our life wrinkles on our garment that does not need the bleach anymore that just needs heat and pressure and that needs a confidence towards god so don't go back and start re um like i said re-dipping it in bleach if you're trying to get a wrinkle out don't go back and start questioning whether your heart is condemning you or not if your heart's condemning you deal with that problem but once you have dealt with that problem we have to accept the fact that we now have confidence towards god because if if his blood and his forgiveness is not enough to take care of that if you repenting of whatever it is that he has checked you in your heart if you repenting of that is not enough to cover that i i beg you to tell me what will i mean do we have a plan b do we have another option is there's can you fast long enough to make it go away can you pray harder or more or whatever the case may be to make it go away say if we get on our knees and we repent and we ask for forgiveness we've got to leave it there we've got to leave it there because as soon as you pick that up john 14 will never work for you john 14 will never work for you and you will never get rid of the wrinkles in your life when you're constantly dealing with spots that don't even exist you will never allow him to deal with the wrinkles in your life if you keep wanting to throw it in bleach and deal with the spots let the spots be deal dealt with let them be in the past god is not i am convinced i am i am standing before a group of people that god is not interested in dealing with your spots he's dealt with them saints i believe you dealt with them before you came through the doors god is at the point he is wanting to deal with our very dna makeup he is wanting to deal with the very wrinkles that our genetics is throwing at us and he is wanting to iron those out and i'm going to tell you something saints you will never withstand the heat and the pressure that he is going to use if your heart is condemning you you will go mentally insane you will have an emotional breakdown you have got to leak as that song says you got to take it to the cross and leave it there you have got to allow him to deal with our wrinkles and quit questioning whether they're spots or not you have better get serious with him and deal with the heart issue once and for all and once you've dealt with that leave it alone allow him to use the heat and the pressure to deal with the wrinkles because that's what he's wanting to deal with brother branham says now faith is based on forgiveness then and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place where we could really see the apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger and it's just laying right at the door we see it we want to see more of it we want it in such a flow that it'll be a help to us us flow out to others remember jesus never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was sent for this is why it's so important that we deal with the spots of our life we let them go we allow god to use his heat and his pressure to deal with the wrinkles in our life because it may not really even be for your benefit this is a body move it's an individual walk yes but it is a body move and god is going to use your brothers and your sisters to iron out your wrinkles [Music] so this goes back to john 14. how can god use your brother and your sister to iron out your wrinkles when you saw them do xyz two weeks ago are they forgiven or are they not forgiven brother branham says faith is based on forgiveness that is forgiveness for you that is forgiveness for your brothers and your sisters because that is the very tools like it or don't like it it doesn't matter to god that is the tools that he is going to use to iron out your wrinkles he is not going to come down on a cloud as the fairy tale picture cloud you understand what i'm saying he's not going to float down on a cloud wave a little magic wand over you with a little nice iron and softly pat them out it's going to be the body that he has chose to come in it is going to be the form he has chose to come in we know what form that is saints we can't understand it it's a paradox yes but your brothers and your sisters and you are the form that god has chose to come in that is the form that he's going to use to iron out your wrinkles and my wrinkles his blood will take care of the spots i don't need you for my spots his blood will take care of my spots but there are things that are so ingrained i'm just being honest with you there are things that are so ingrained in my dna and my genetic makeup that i think they're right and everybody else is looking at them and be like that is so far left left field it's not even funny saints it's our genetics and our makeup the scripture says every man thinks in his own eyes thinks he's right it is going to take a brother and a sister who is honest with us to be able to identify that and bring that to our attention instead of getting angry about it we should be thankful if you've got a brother or a sister who will be honest with you you should be thankful get mad at him if if you want to for a little bit but at the end of the day you should be thankful that god has allowed a form to be on the face of the earth that will bring you into a perfect condition it's the form he's chosen to use saints allow him to use the form that he wants to that is the form that he will speak to us in that he will that he will bring to our understanding wrinkles that are in our makeup it's so important that we that we have faith in that and there's no way we can have faith in that if we don't believe that those people are forgiven if we don't believe that we are forgiven and forgiveness does not take a long time we're all well aware with the story about the little girl in the prayer line who smoked cigarettes she's in the prayer line she's a smoker she repents of it she stands before the prophet and he cannot see it that's how long it takes how long a time span you want to put on that i don't know i'm going to say maybe a nanosecond or less but it's a real quick process so now if the prophet tries to rebuke her for that he's telling god something that god has already forgot so now god thinks his prophets went insane because he's trying to tell him this little girl's got sin in her life and god has no idea about it that's how it works saints you'll not understand that but you have to accept it you have to accept it it's the only way as as the pressure in your and my individual walk increases it is the only way that you will keep a sane mind you have got to accept what he's done for you you have to accept it and you've got to leave it there and you have to accept that for your brothers and your sisters as well because god is going to use our brothers and sisters in a way moving forward and he has been but even more so moving forward to get the wrinkles out of each and every one of our lives we've got to have confidence in that process for ourselves and for our brothers and sisters brother branham says in the church age book we need to call on god for revelation more than anything else in the world very very familiar portion there but look at what he says after that we have accepted the bible we have accepted the great truths of it but it is still not real to most people because the revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened the bible says in second corinthians 5 21 that we have become the very righteousness of god by our union with jesus christ did you get it it's remember this is right this is the first thing he says right after he says we need to call on god for revelation more than anything the very first thing he goes to that we have been made the very righteousness of god by our union with jesus christ did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of god himself by being in christ it says that he jesus became sin for us it does not say that he became sinful but became sin for us that by our union with him we might become the righteousness of god if we accept the fact and we must that with him i'm sorry that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our union with him have become the very righteousness of god listen what he says next to reject one is to reject the other to accept the one is to accept the other so it's not optional it is not optional if you are trying to accept the fact that i mean just the gospel in its rawest purest simplest that he became sin for me and was nailed to a cross and shed his blood for my salvation if you accept that fact you must also accept the fact that you are now spotless blameless wrinkle-free the very righteousness of god to reject that is to reject the fact that he died on the cross for you and i know that's just you know if we want to say christianity 101 but that is it in its raw form if we're going to accept one we have to accept the other if we reject the latter because of our dna makeup and how we just can't wrap our mind around that and how we failed you know 14 times two weeks ago to reject one is to reject the other and the reason that that is so important is if you can't accept one and you can't accept the other you will never accept the form that god has chose to come to you and i in in this day and you will never accept the form that he is using that he is trying to use to get the wrinkles out of our life to get us to perfection iron sharpeneth iron that is the form he's chose to use we have to have a we have to have a complete confidence in what the prophet says here if we're to move forward as he's wanting us to move forward to reject one is to reject the other 1961 revelation chapter five the first part of that series brother branham makes a statement he says and so many times we hunt for god and we look for god and if god was just everywhere and if he had a great big throne sitting up here somewhere everybody would believe in god then if god set up on a big throne here somewhere say he sits in this certain certain city and here he is this is god and you go to him he can just turn it like that why everybody would believe him this sounds like a wonderful thing to me this is what job was wanting remember this was job's prayer he says if there was just a man i could find if there was just a man in flesh if there was just a man somewhere if there was just some way i could contact him if i could just lay a hold of him if i could just tend to tangibly find him this is what job was after this is what job was looking for job just wanted to make direct contact with god brother braham says everybody would believe him then faith would be void so as wonderful as that would be and as much as i would like that it's impossible for god to grant that to us because that would not be pleasing to him because the scripture already says that without faith it's impossible to please god faith worketh by love faith is based on forgiveness faith cannot have a god setting right there on a throne that i can go to and he can snap his fingers and make everything work okay there's no faith involved and for this little hiccup that's in time that is what god is after he is after faith he is after faith that's what he's after he says we wouldn't have to have any faith at all then you see that would be that this is my favorite part of this quote that will be in the millennium praise the lord let's just stop reading there and let's get to the millennium but now he's calling and trying to find out those who it looks mysterious and dark and you don't know how to do it maybe i'm the only one in that condition maybe i'm the only one that's ever experienced that it's mysterious it's dark i've got no clue how to deal with this that's the people god's looking for but by faith we believe it we believe that's the reason this is so if you take that quote and you take that back to the scripture in ephesians is in ephesians 5 27 that he might present himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle amen how is he going to get a glorious church without spot or without wrinkle he's calling trying to find out it looks mysterious and it looks dark and you don't know how to do it but by faith we believe it that's how he's going to have a church that's without spot and without wrinkle is he's going to have a people that have a revelation of god's love to them that their faith will work by and they will understand and have a revelation of forgiveness for themselves and for their brothers and sisters that's how that's going to work that's how that we are going to be able to get rid of the weight of ourselves which is the weight that's holding us on this earth he's dealt with the sin problem we have got a full word and a full word brings deliverance for any kind of sin we have the word in its fullness we we have no excuses for sin we have the full word we believe the full word remember sin is just unbelief in the word if we believe the full word why should we question whether we have sin in our life or not it's not that we're not going to make mistakes repent of them wash the spots out let him deal with the wrinkles because that's what he's wanting to deal with and i think i've said it 100 times now but understand how he's going to deal with those wrinkles you don't get to pick how he deals with the wrinkles and unfortunately we don't get to pick how long the iron sets on there we don't get to pick he's the one with the iron in the hand he's the one that's going to move it back and forth he's the one that's going to decide how much pressure it needs on there the point that i'm saying that is i don't want you to beat yourself up or question where you stand with god when the heat and the pressure comes it's going to come it's not god being angry with you it is god simply wanting to iron out a wrinkle that you may or may not even know exists in your life you may not even know the wrinkle was there until everything's said and done with again look at what brother brandon says he says it looks mysterious it looks dark i cannot see what's going on here but i have to have faith in the one who has the iron in his hand i want to look at something real quick as we would come to a close we're very familiar in the scripture that god has seven compound names the seven compound names of jehovah and we know that the seven compound names of jehovah are found in jesus christ and we know that the fullness of the word coming in our day and our time was to manifest the fullness of jesus christ so therefore by default the fullness of the word being manifested in our day in our age is going to manifest the seven compound names of jehovah jehovah jireh the lord will provide a sacrifice i'm going to give a disclaimer before i go through these i'm probably not going to pronounce all of these correctly you can look them up yourself jehovah jireh the lord will provide a sacrifice do we want that manifested do you know what that means yeah it means you're at some point in time going to need a sacrifice that's not going to be a pleasant experience jehovah rapha the lord that healeth thee do we want the fullness of the word manifested do we want jesus christ on full display do you know what that means maybe i should have titled this sermon do you know what that means that means at some point in time you're going to need a healer do you want jesus manifested in his fullness jehovah shamma the lord is present do you know what that means that means most likely when you're getting some of those wrinkles ironed out you are going to get to the point you question where in the world is god is he even here do we want jesus christ fully manifested do we want jehovah shamma manifested jehovah shalom the lord is our peace you get my drift do we want it manifested are we opening the doors are we opening the windows do we really mean what we say remember his name which we took in baptism his name is his characteristics it's not just a verbalization david picked that up he's see david said let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart see you can be dunked in the pool however many times you want and jesus christ verbalized over you however many times you want but his name is his characteristics and if you've taken his name in baptism that's a public declaration that you want his name manifested through you do you know what that means jehovah nisi the lord is our banner that means you're going to be going into some wars and you're going to need him to fight those battles that's what that means do we want jehovah nisi manifested do we want it manifested in its fullness because you realize what that means is you can't fight that battle see most of us a lot of us myself included we're okay with the battles coming that we can handle that's the spots that's not what he's after what he's after is the wrinkles what he's after is the condition that you're going to be put in that you can't fight that battle anymore and now he has to manifest on your behalf nine of the ten battles you might have been able to fight just fine just because of the way you're made number 10 will totally destroy you if you try to if you try to rely on yourself you will come to the point that you need jehovah and easy jehovah reija the lord is my shepherd as the musicians come the lord is my shepherd oh that sounds so nice that's wonderful do you know what that means that means you are going to come to the point that you finally recognize you have absolutely zero ability to lead yourself do we want the fullness of the word manifested do we want the fullness of the word manifested jehovah tiscanu the lord is our righteousness that means at some point in time you're finally going to come to the recognition that everything that you've got to offer is nothing but filthy ranks we know that intellectually but do we really know it brother branham says we know the bible we've read the bible we know these things but the revelation of it is lacking god is going to make sure that the revelation of it is not lacking are we willing to allow him to do that do we want that fullness manifested do we know what that means to us as an individual do we really want to be free from the weight of ourself the paradox of that is we can set we can ask that question and we can say yes because we really don't even know what the weight of ourself is yet it's going to take conditions to bring that out do you understand what i mean we are undoubtedly each and every one i'll just speak for myself sitting here with conditions in our life that we that we're completely wrong in i mean completely messed up in completely wrong a situation will arise and we will handle it completely wrong and we'll be like why in the world did i do that but it'll be that condition that he will use to bring us to the recognition we still have a wrinkle there it's it's almost like a catch-22 we can ask that question and we can say yes amen that's what i want but when it comes when it comes as the as time is fading out and the heat and the pressure is so intense when it comes these seven compound names are going to start being manifested and that's not going to be none of these are pleasant conditions saints here i go with the doomsday preaching again sorry but none of these understand none of these are pleasant conditions but yet we have them laying in our life and and a lot of times we're completely ignorant to them until a condition arises that brings them out and that's what's forthcoming and that's what he's after and that's when we're really going to have to ask ourselves do we mean what we say do we really want the seventh seal revealed do we really want the fullness of god may manifest in my flesh it's a tough question it's going to be tough situations none of these are going to come with easy situations it's impossible these are tough situations these are characteristics that are only brought out under tough situations and i'll just want to leave you with this because this is this is really what i want to emphasize rebecca came before eliezer and she was a virgin and no man had known her just because things get tough just because things get hot just because things start squeezing just because it's an intense pressure that does not change the fact that you are the spotless virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ allow him to iron out the wrinkled saints that does not change your position with him allow him to do what he wants to do in the way that he chooses to do it and this is going to require faith to reject one is to reject the other to accept one is to accept the other let's just pray together precious lord jesus we just want to pause here to end this service lord and thank you for your word father thank you for your truth thank you for these things that you have laid in the scriptures and in the message for us that as we would come to the closing moments in time that we would have an understanding lord of what is going on around us and even more importantly what is going on within each and every one of us lord and as you have laid out these these requirements in your word for your bride to be spotless and to be blameless and to be wrinkle-free we recognize lord that there's no way we can meet those conditions but you would quickly come and you would lay another word in there that that i will be with you and even in you lord and it's to that that we look and it's to that that that our faith is in and our hope is in lord because we don't have any other option lord we recognize the seriousness of what you're wanting to do and what forms you're wanting it to do it in lord of hybrid flesh that that is not made to withstand the pressures that are coming not made to withstand the trials and the tribulations that not only are coming but that we're going through lord and that we have going through lord we are we are incapable and i think that's what you're wanting us to understand lord may we come and may we die afresh and may we may we remember the name that we took when we got buried in baptism before you lord and may we have a fresh understanding and a fresh recognition that we didn't just take that name verbally lord but we took that as the characteristics that you wish to display through our flesh and lord may we accept that and may we allow you even as confusing as a dark and mysterious as the situations may be may we allow you to manifest the fullness of your name in us lord for we we know that we have a promise once you do that lord and it's that promise just as jesus despised the cross but endured it for the promise that laid ahead it's that promise that we endure these things that we look forward to lord lord we look forward to that millennial reign lord once you have accomplished what you want to accomplish with us and we give ourselves completely over to that lord we pray that we would just take these words lord it's not been presented in a dynamic way lord i don't want to to fake dynamics or enthusiasm it's a serious thing lord but we pray that you would just take it and make it a reality to myself and to the people lord that we would manifest that which you desire we thank you for this time lord we pray your blessings on the people in jesus christ's name amen god bless you brother go ahead brother you are more [Music] me is set free [Music] [Music] me who are you amen let's all stand i just want to say god is the master at doing heart surgery and then i marvel and when i watch god work what i see you know we talked about preeminence and we talk about the second fold of the great threefold plan of god and that second poll was to have preeminence in a people and he's doing that now but that means he wants to have preeminence in me and preeminence means absolute control absolute total control and that's what god's doing he's working it all out to where he gets absolute total control that we don't just have a knee-jerk reaction and do what we've always done but that he takes control and does what he wants in every situation and then he's perfecting his bride he's using all the circumstances around us to perfect his bride but i say god have your perfect way in me amen i i'm i'm tired of myself amen i'm tired of the weight of myself amen and i just if if i just had a switch where i could just flip it off i would take the switch and i'd flip it off but god hasn't made it that way he wants it under his control and i say praise god we've come to this life for training we've come here training for reigning we've come here to learn about god we've come here to understand what the seven redemptive names of god are all about amen because we would experience it in the negative to watch god come through on the positive i say praise be to god then when he was talking about the nature i started thinking that that quote we hear so many times your greatest strength is also your greatest weakness and i was thinking while he was while he was ministering there about a police dog a police dog is aggressive right do you want an aggressive dog as a police are you going to take down a criminal he's got to be aggressive he's got to have grit he's got to have determination he's got to be a little bit ferocious and you breed that into the nature because you want that nature because he's gonna face down a criminal and have to bring it down amen and that's a wonderful thing they bred it to get it that way amen but they don't want that police dog dragging down little old ladies and little kids and you understand i mean we the that trainer wants a certain thing in that dog but he wants that under absolute complete control because he well there's got to be a mind a greater mind that can discern a situation that can bring that nature under control so it's only used the right way and god has put so many ingredients in us to get us a certain way amen bread it into us amen but that thing without control can be the very thing that'll destroy everything around us it'll destroy situations and destroy relationships and the very thing that god wants to use for his glory can absolutely be destructive if we're not in absolute control of the holy ghost and so there's times that he'll let us go ruin something just so we'll end up hating everything about us and saying god you've got to take control of us i don't know what i don't know what to do i don't know which end is up i don't know what to do without your leadership how many of you can say god i want you to have control of me i want you to i want to know when you say go i want to go when you say stop i want to stop i want you to have control of me amen i think that's what preeminence is all about just appreciate the word i appreciate the sincerity i appreciate the depth of an individual walk where god will come down and start dealing with this individually when nobody else around us will understand what we're going through and understand what god's teaching us because the lesson isn't for them it's only for me and if i try to explain it won't even make sense to you because what god is doing is working something out at me and i know exactly what he's doing and i can't even get anybody else to understand it that's how personal this is becoming i say thank you lord for dealing with me as an individual i want to go back and i just jotted down a note is something that i found interesting back early on when he talked about eliezer's prayer how it was a selfless prayer and he was praying for somebody else and how god answered that before he was even done praying she was on the scene and it just reminded me of a testimony that i just saw just i think just two days ago i was watching uh brother billy paul's testimony and in brother billy paul's testimony he was talking about they were out camping and brother billy had been really nervous and he was having he was nervous he was struggling with his nerves from the meetings and they were out grilling some steaks and brother branham knew that he was nervous and he took his hat off just for a second and prayed and he put his hat back on and billy noticed him doing it and billy said he ate his meal he felt good and after the meal was over they were sitting around talking and brother branham said now you all know billy's been real nervous he was nervous when he got here to cam and he says before we ate i just prayed a little prayer and asked god lord would you bless billy and help him to enjoy his meal enjoy his time here and that nervousness he says you saw what a big meal he ate and brother billy said it went he was he enjoyed himself he said then brother branham pulled up took off his boot took off his sock and pulled up his pants and showed a great big black and blue swollen ankle he said a week ago or more than that he said i sprained my ankle real bad and i've prayed for it every night since then and it hasn't got healed and he says see that gift is not for me it's for others i thought what a testimony here the prophet i mean you've been there where you've prayed day after day deliver me deliver me deliver me and nothing moves but brother branham couldn't doubt the gift he couldn't doubt his who he was in christ he couldn't doubt his salvation he couldn't doubt that he had a gift of healing for the nation's peoples of the world he couldn't doubt his commission he couldn't down anything even though it wasn't working on him he was being tested to have faith it was still a gift for others amen maybe sometimes what we need to do is quit focusing on us amen quit worrying about what we're going through and just start praying for somebody else and if that other person will start praying for us maybe the gifts are here for one another just let it crisscross all over the building all over the body of christ amen i'll pray for you and you pray for me amen i've got confidence in your prayers i've got confidence in the gifts that are in you and i've got confidence in who i am in christ and it's for a person and i got confidence if i intercede on your behalf god will meet your need but when it's not working for my ankle i can't lose confidence that i can still pray for you if it's not working for you don't you lose confidence that you can still pray for me we're here for one another i just thought that was a good testimony someone said i love you god bless you amen god's going to have preeminence there will be a bride under complete control there will be a bride amen when he says sick him she'll go after that devil sink her teeth in and not let go and then when she's faced the next the same devil the next day she lunges to go after and he says sit and she'll sit amen there's going to be a bride under complete control and god's working it all out right now and i say god just have me under your control lead me by your spirit that's all i want is to be pleasing to you that's all i want is to be pleasing to you amen god bless you we love you let's just let's just dismiss let's just sing a song [Music] you gotta sing songs [Music] he's got it all [Music] he's got it all in control he put that reassurance he's got it all my father knows what i need [Music] my father knows what i need he knows what's best for me my father knows is i put my life in his hand he's got it all in control he's got it [Music] all he's got it all in control [Music] fears and make your life [Music] jesus [Music] is by the fire of yours praise me though [Music] oh worthy you are worthy [Music]
