[1:55] let's take our bibles and turn to
[1:57] galatians chapter four
[2:00] i'd like to continue with the thought
[2:02] from sunday this will be the seed of
[2:03] promise part two
[2:06] and we'll read from galatians
[2:08] chapter 4.
[2:11] and i'm going to not do all the
[2:12] scripture reading that we did last night
[2:14] i'm just going to pull out a couple
[2:15] nuggets and we'll go through those as we
[2:17] get started
[2:19] but we'll start here with galatians 4
[2:21] and verse 28.
[2:24] now we brethren as isaac was
[2:27] are the children of promise
[2:29] amen i hope that means a whole lot to
[2:31] you amen
[2:32] we brethren
[2:34] and paul is talking to the the new
[2:37] testament church jew and gentiles all
[2:39] those that have gathered amen and by
[2:41] faith in jesus christ and been born
[2:43] again by a spirit it says now we
[2:45] brethren so we're included in that we
[2:47] brethren amen
[2:48] now we brethren as isaac was
[2:51] are the children of promise that's a
[2:54] good place to be amen you can all have
[2:56] your seats keep your bibles open here to
[2:58] galatians let's turn back to galatians
[3:00] chapter three
[3:01] we did some lengthy bible readings on
[3:04] sunday but i'm just going to pull just a
[3:06] couple highlight scriptures
[3:08] out of that
[3:10] in galatians chapter 3 verse
[3:13] 6.
[3:16] yeah
[3:17] even as abraham believed god and it was
[3:20] accounted to him for righteousness
[3:22] know ye therefore that they which are of
[3:24] faith the same are the children of
[3:26] abraham
[3:27] and the scripture foreseeing that god
[3:29] would justify the heathen through faith
[3:31] preached before the gospel unto abraham
[3:33] saying indeed shall all nations be
[3:35] blessed so then they which be of faith
[3:38] are blessed with faithful abraham
[3:40] it's amazing how the apostle paul can
[3:43] take the old testament and preach it in
[3:45] such a way that he's telling us that god
[3:48] already knew that the heathen would be
[3:50] justified by faith when he called
[3:51] abraham
[3:53] you know the the jews didn't understand
[3:55] this but but because he had met christ
[3:58] in the arabian was taught the scriptures
[4:00] by the lord himself by revelation paul
[4:02] could reach back there into the old
[4:04] testament that they all had and he could
[4:06] show his current dispensation was laying
[4:08] there all along
[4:10] he said now i read verse 7 again
[4:13] i'm going to read this starting in verse
[4:15] 6. even as abraham believed god and it
[4:17] was accounted to him for righteousness
[4:20] know you therefore that they which are
[4:22] of faith the same were the children of
[4:24] abraham so if you can believe like
[4:26] abraham believed that you're a child of
[4:28] abraham
[4:29] and the scripture foreseeing that god
[4:31] would justify the heathen through faith
[4:33] preached before the gospel unto abraham
[4:36] saying in thee shall all nations be
[4:38] blessed so now when he's saying in thee
[4:40] shall all nations be blessed the jews
[4:43] would take that in a natural way and
[4:45] because that they were the natural seed
[4:46] of abraham because of their nation all
[4:49] nations would be blessed amen but paul's
[4:52] taking that scripture and he's using
[4:54] differently than they've used it for
[4:56] generations and for hundreds and
[4:57] hundreds of years now he's taking that
[5:00] and saying in you because you had the
[5:02] capacity to believe there is going to be
[5:05] a promised seed come through you abraham
[5:07] amen and you are justified by faith with
[5:10] an imputation of righteousness and your
[5:12] seed will have the same thing
[5:15] but not natural lineage a spiritual
[5:18] lineage of faith and that's how all
[5:20] nations are blessed in abraham because
[5:22] the promise that went to abraham would
[5:24] go into all nations when they would find
[5:27] faith the same faith that abraham had
[5:30] when it was found wherever it's found
[5:32] amen that same faith amen makes you a
[5:35] child of abraham
[5:38] so the apostle paul amen his preaching
[5:41] is absolutely revolutionary it's dynamic
[5:45] it's nothing like they had ever heard
[5:47] before amen
[5:49] amen i say that and you know why i say
[5:51] that i say that over and over again
[5:53] because brother branham came and he took
[5:54] the scriptures and he preached away in
[5:56] such a way that baffled theologians it
[5:58] dumbfounded all of those that had been
[6:00] through seminary and had been taught the
[6:02] scriptures and had read it a certain way
[6:04] and then a certain common understanding
[6:07] of the scriptures and brother branham
[6:09] comes along and takes those scriptures
[6:11] and uses them in such a way that
[6:13] absolutely bamboozles the religion of
[6:15] the day and and the religious leaders of
[6:17] the day but that's exactly what paul did
[6:21] and this is what he's doing here in the
[6:22] scriptures and he's saying
[6:25] indeed shall all nations be blessed so
[6:27] then they which be of faith are blessed
[6:30] with faithful abraham
[6:32] let's turn over to verse 16.
[6:35] same chapter chapter 3 verse 16 now unto
[6:38] abraham and his seed where the promise
[6:39] is made he saith not unto seeds as of
[6:42] many but as of one and to thy seed which
[6:46] is christ so now we're looking at the
[6:48] promise that's coming through the seed
[6:49] of abraham and he's not talking seeds
[6:52] because it won't be all the children of
[6:54] abraham because abraham had many
[6:55] children amen but he's coming through
[6:58] the seed of abraham which is christ
[7:02] praise god
[7:04] now let's look at verse 28
[7:08] there is neither jew nor greek there is
[7:10] neither bond nor free there is neither
[7:12] male nor female for you are all one in
[7:15] christ jesus if you be christ then are
[7:18] you abraham's seed and heirs according
[7:21] to the promise
[7:23] praise be to god
[7:25] brother of says in the message modern
[7:27] events may clear by prophecy
[7:29] it says now we are supposed to be the
[7:31] royal seed of abraham isaac was the
[7:33] natural seed but the faith seed
[7:35] catch that the faith seed the faith in
[7:38] the promised word the promised word
[7:40] don't miss it was that royal seed that
[7:44] was the seed abraham's faith
[7:47] we being dead in christ where abraham's
[7:50] seed heirs with him according to the
[7:52] promise so what he says here is that was
[7:54] the seed was abraham's faith amen
[7:57] abraham believed god and it was
[7:59] accounted unto him for righteousness and
[8:01] so now we're looking at a faith seed
[8:03] that's coming down
[8:05] amen brother branham goes on to say
[8:08] here in three kinds of believers these
[8:10] are two quotes that we read sunday we're
[8:11] just reviewing
[8:13] he that receiveth my words and believeth
[8:15] on him that sent me has already passed
[8:17] from death to life but can you receive
[8:19] the word first can you receive the word
[8:21] all the word all of christ christ is the
[8:25] anointed word he is the word anointed
[8:29] christ means the anointed one the
[8:31] anointed word for that day made manifest
[8:34] the savior the redeemer so lock that in
[8:37] as a definition of christ and never
[8:39] forget that we know christ is the word
[8:41] but brother man said christ means the
[8:43] anointed one the anointed word for that
[8:46] day made manifest amen so that is christ
[8:50] and that's why when we go back to verse
[8:51] 16 it says now to abraham and to his
[8:54] seed where the promise is made he saith
[8:56] not into seeds as many but as of one
[8:59] into thy seed which is christ and so
[9:02] it's the lineage of christ the faith
[9:05] seed that's coming down through that is
[9:07] going to be the one that's obtaining
[9:09] these promises and christ is the
[9:11] anointed word for that day
[9:14] made manifest
[9:16] let's look at this in hebrews hebrews
[9:18] chapter 11.
[9:23] verse 24
[9:26] hebrews 11 and 24
[9:29] by faith moses when he come to years
[9:32] refused to be called the son of
[9:34] pharaoh's daughter
[9:35] choosing rather to suffer affliction
[9:37] with the people of god than to enjoy the
[9:40] pleasures of sin for a season
[9:42] esteeming the reproach of christ greater
[9:44] riches than the treasure in egypt for he
[9:47] had respect unto the recompense of the
[9:49] reward so this is one of those
[9:50] scriptures where brother branham picks
[9:53] he picks out the scripture and he gains
[9:55] an understanding of what christ or who
[9:57] christ is what christ is because he
[9:59] could see that moses was esteeming the
[10:01] reproach of christ greater riches than
[10:04] all the treasures in egypt amen but but
[10:07] when when you come to this modern
[10:09] understanding of jesus christ and the
[10:11] manifestation of christ amen everybody
[10:13] when they talk about christ is talking
[10:15] about the dispensation when jesus came
[10:18] in the fullness of flesh and was a man
[10:20] on this earth the man from nazareth and
[10:22] they call that christ amen but now
[10:25] the apostle paul is saying that that
[10:28] moses esteemed the reproach of christ
[10:30] that was that was hundreds and hundreds
[10:32] of years before
[10:34] so christ was there back in moses day
[10:37] and moses could esteem the reproach of
[10:39] christ greater riches he could value the
[10:42] reproach of christ greater than all the
[10:44] treasures of egypt so christ was all the
[10:46] way back there in moses's day
[10:49] so this is how brother branham can make
[10:50] the statements that he can make amen
[10:52] that christ is the anointed word made
[10:54] manifest in that day and when moses
[10:57] caught the revelation of that day amen
[10:59] he would rather bear that reproach than
[11:01] all the treasures in egypt
[11:04] because that was christ the word may
[11:06] manifest in that day
[11:10] praise be to god
[11:14] i'm going to have to restart
[11:16] my computer
[11:18] so
[11:19] so we don't ever want to forget this
[11:21] this is really really important to hold
[11:23] on to because if we can't follow brother
[11:25] branham in that thinking then we're
[11:27] going to be lost in so many statements
[11:29] that he's making and we're going to
[11:30] misplace things in the wrong place let's
[11:33] go to john
[11:35] john chapter 1 the gospel of john
[11:36] chapter 1. super familiar scripture but
[11:39] i just want to read these together
[11:45] john chapter 1
[11:47] verse 1.
[11:50] in the beginning was the word
[11:52] and the word was with god and the word
[11:55] was god
[11:56] the same was in the beginning with god
[12:00] all things were made by him and without
[12:02] him was not anything made that was made
[12:04] in him was life and the life was the
[12:06] light of men
[12:08] and when we go to verse 14 it tells us
[12:10] in the word was made flesh and dwelt
[12:11] among us so the word um was part of god
[12:15] the word was was was god and was with
[12:18] god amen it was in the beginning with
[12:21] god and all things were made by the word
[12:24] and that word was life and that life was
[12:27] the light of men and that word was made
[12:29] flesh so when you look at that word
[12:31] coming down through you can see christ
[12:33] is the anointed word for that day that
[12:36] word as it comes into manifestation is
[12:38] christ is christ is christ is christ all
[12:41] the way down to jesus christ
[12:43] and when it comes in jesus christ it's
[12:45] all that word made flesh everything
[12:48] bundled into one and in that word is
[12:51] also the bride word
[12:54] so male and female is there everything
[12:56] is there
[12:57] in that manifestation so let's go to
[13:00] first john
[13:02] we'll go back past hebrews
[13:05] go to 1st john
[13:07] chapter 5.
[13:15] i did not finish laying my foundation on
[13:17] sunday so i'm still technically laying a
[13:19] foundation
[13:22] first john 5 and 7 for there are three
[13:25] that bear record in heaven the father
[13:28] the word
[13:29] and the holy ghost
[13:32] so where's christ
[13:36] the word the word amen what is christ
[13:39] that word made manifest in the day is
[13:43] christ
[13:45] amen and so that that becomes very very
[13:48] important brother rem says in the
[13:49] message turning on turn on the light in
[13:52] the beginning was the word the word was
[13:53] with god and the word was god hebrews 13
[13:55] 8 he is the same yesterday today and
[13:59] forever we've talked about this
[14:01] statement before but let's think about
[14:02] this for a minute he's the same
[14:04] yesterday today and forever but when you
[14:07] read down through the bible amen the
[14:09] characters are changing the story's
[14:11] changing the circumstances are changing
[14:13] he's at one point he's working with all
[14:16] of mankind amen now he's working with
[14:18] just one family amen now he's moving on
[14:21] to the gentiles both jew and gentile and
[14:23] he's moving on to a gentile bride he's
[14:25] the dispensations are changing amen the
[14:28] characters are changing the
[14:30] circumstances are changing
[14:32] but yet he's jesus christ the same
[14:34] yesterday today and forever and christ
[14:37] was back there amen in moses day christ
[14:40] was that rock that followed them through
[14:41] the wilderness
[14:43] so how is christ the same yesterday
[14:46] today and forever because christ is
[14:49] always the word made manifest in the day
[14:52] so whenever the words made manifest in
[14:54] the day that's christ amen and then we
[14:56] come to another dispensation and the
[14:58] word is made manifest that's christ we
[15:00] move to another dispensation and the
[15:02] word may manifest that's christ jesus
[15:04] christ the same yesterday today and
[15:07] forever
[15:09] so now the test for the seed has always
[15:12] been the ability to believe god when
[15:15] he's manifesting when christ is being
[15:17] manifest in your day that portion of the
[15:20] word allotted to your day when you can
[15:23] catch that revelation and catch that
[15:26] word and identify with that it
[15:28] identifies you as part of that word
[15:32] it's the word coming to the word it's
[15:34] the two uniting together amen and so and
[15:37] so now it's been jesus christ the same
[15:40] yesterday today and forever
[15:44] that's why
[15:46] there's so many things that i want to
[15:48] share my i just have so much on my heart
[15:50] i'm just going to trust that god will
[15:52] help me
[15:53] help me do this he said hebrews 13 8
[15:55] he's the same yesterday today and
[15:57] forever it's the word of god always
[16:01] it was christ and noah
[16:03] it was christ and moses it was christ
[16:06] and david that looked up as a rejected
[16:09] king upon the city where 800 years later
[16:12] christ sat there weeping over a city
[16:14] being a rejected king just like david
[16:15] was it's always the spirit of christ
[16:18] so brother man was saying it was christ
[16:21] that was a noah that was christ that was
[16:23] in moses that was christ that was in
[16:25] david jesus christ the same yesterday
[16:27] today and forever
[16:31] but not in the same body
[16:34] that he was in in nazareth
[16:38] not in the same figure
[16:41] not in the same actions
[16:46] but he is the same because it's the word
[16:48] of god made manifest in that day
[16:50] which makes him the same
[16:52] in every day
[16:55] praise god
[16:57] i'm just pausing because i don't know
[16:58] exactly where to go amen
[17:00] there's so many so many things along
[17:02] these lines that i want to share
[17:07] let's start here i'm going to draw a
[17:08] picture brother franco if you can help
[17:09] me pull this up
[17:11] i'm going to i'm going to redraw what we
[17:13] drew some time ago with this this line
[17:16] and i'm going to label it again and then
[17:17] i want to break it down a little bit
[17:19] smaller
[17:20] here but while i'm doing that let's turn
[17:22] to first corinthians chapter 12.
[17:27] first corinthians chapter 12.
[17:39] okay first corinthians
[17:42] 12
[17:43] and 12.
[17:47] for as the body is one and half many
[17:49] members and all the members of that one
[17:51] body being many are one body so also is
[17:56] christ
[17:58] now paul did not say
[18:00] christ is like a body with many members
[18:05] right
[18:06] he's he's listen to carefully saying
[18:09] for as the body is one
[18:11] and half of many members and all the
[18:13] members of that one body being many or
[18:16] one body so
[18:17] also is christ so what is christ christ
[18:22] is a many-membered body
[18:25] sometimes we say a many many body and
[18:28] when we say a mini-member body we look
[18:30] at we think about the church or the
[18:31] bride and then christ over here and
[18:33] there's christ and there's a
[18:34] many-membered body but this is the body
[18:37] of christ so the life of christ goes
[18:38] into the body of christ and christ is a
[18:41] many-membered body
[18:43] that is the manifestation of the word
[18:46] for this hour christ is a many-membered
[18:49] body
[18:51] so so sometimes we get the wrong images
[18:54] in our mind amen by language amen so we
[18:56] talk about a body as if the body's here
[18:59] and then christ is here and this is the
[19:01] body of christ
[19:03] but in the end time they've been unified
[19:05] friends
[19:07] and now christ is a many member body
[19:12] so i want to serve christ in my day i
[19:14] want to find christ in my day whereas i
[19:17] want to find jesus christ the same
[19:19] yesterday today and forever i'm telling
[19:21] you today christ is a mini-membered
[19:24] bride
[19:25] that is christ amen that is the
[19:27] manifestation of the word that is the
[19:30] that is christ the word made manifest
[19:32] the anointed word for this day
[19:35] praise god
[19:37] let's go to hebrews chapter 2.
[19:48] so many directions i want to go in
[19:50] i can't pick one
[19:52] hebrews chapter 2
[19:57] and verse 10
[19:58] hebrews 2 and 10.
[20:00] for it became him for whom are all
[20:03] things and by whom are all things and
[20:05] bringing many sons into glory to make
[20:07] the captain of their salvation perfect
[20:09] through sufferings
[20:11] for both he that sanctifieth and they
[20:14] who are sanctified are all of one
[20:19] praise god
[20:20] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[20:22] call them brethren saying i will declare
[20:24] thy name unto my brethren in the midst
[20:27] of the church will i sing praise unto
[20:29] thee and again i will put my trust in
[20:31] him and again behold i and the children
[20:33] which god hath given me amen so when he
[20:37] he he made the captain of our salvation
[20:39] which is jesus christ perfect through
[20:41] suffering for both he that sanctifieth
[20:43] and they who are sanctified are all of
[20:46] one amen we all come from god we are all
[20:49] children of god amen
[20:52] i'm going to try to go back here and
[20:55] use this thing correctly
[20:59] okay
[21:00] before we we drew a line across here
[21:09] we drew the cross on the line
[21:11] and and i came up here and i and i just
[21:14] put a circle here like this and i just
[21:17] put the mind of god
[21:21] or something like that
[21:24] and that thoughts of god is coming down
[21:27] into manifestation on this line
[21:30] it's going back to god but not just back
[21:33] to his mind it's going to be going back
[21:35] to all that he thought in his mind
[21:36] before so it's not just going back to
[21:39] the mind of god but it's going back to
[21:41] the image god had his thought his
[21:43] perfect thought from before the
[21:45] foundation of the world so that
[21:46] redemption is running in a cycle and
[21:49] it's coming back to the materialization
[21:51] of that thought amen
[21:53] and so now on this line of the mind of
[21:56] god the thought of god when when the
[21:58] thought of god comes forth amen and
[22:00] comes into manifestation it becomes the
[22:02] word of god amen and the word of god is
[22:05] the thought of god expressed so as it
[22:08] comes down this line it begins to
[22:10] express
[22:11] amen
[22:13] it is expressed
[22:16] in individuals
[22:18] these individuals come from the thought
[22:20] of god
[22:21] let's just write on here
[22:25] noah
[22:30] abraham there's many more you can fill
[22:32] that that line up but what i want to
[22:35] what i want to show if i can just god
[22:37] will help me
[22:39] this
[22:41] this line coming down through here
[22:45] is the word
[22:50] it's the thoughts of god coming into
[22:52] manifestation it's the word
[22:54] adam was the word
[22:57] noah was the word
[22:59] abraham was the word
[23:01] if i could write it
[23:03] if you just let me
[23:05] maybe
[23:07] do this in my own way it may not
[23:10] i don't know any better way to do it
[23:12] than this
[23:14] it's also
[23:16] uh it's the word
[23:18] it's christ
[23:22] it's the lamb's book of life
[23:30] it's also the tree of life
[23:35] it's also the stream of life
[23:43] and
[23:44] and i hope that doesn't stumble anybody
[23:47] but it's the thought of god coming into
[23:50] manifestation in each age
[23:52] which is the word of god
[23:54] which is christ the anointed word for
[23:57] that day which was the eternal thought
[24:00] of god coming into
[24:02] expression because god had a plan before
[24:05] the foundation of the world and we know
[24:07] that god had mapped out his plan before
[24:09] the foundation of the world and it's so
[24:11] perfect because we know jesus christ was
[24:13] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[24:14] the world so because jesus christ was
[24:16] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[24:18] the world god foresaw that there would
[24:20] be a need for a lamb slain before the
[24:22] foundation of the world so he foresaw
[24:24] the fall
[24:26] so god understood what was going to be
[24:28] coming down through time and what was
[24:30] going to be coming into manifestations
[24:32] and as it was coming down
[24:34] it
[24:35] i'll just do some more drawing
[24:39] this half
[24:43] is the restoration of the bridegroom
[24:46] tree
[24:48] to here
[24:50] right because the masterpiece fell on
[24:52] the garden of eden god was going to
[24:53] restore first he restored the male so
[24:56] the old testament is the restoration of
[24:59] adam until we finally come to the last
[25:01] atom because we don't need another atom
[25:03] when we come to the last atom
[25:06] but then over on this side
[25:09] in the new testament
[25:11] we have the bride tree
[25:14] restoration
[25:16] until at the end you have the
[25:17] restoration of the tree of life male and
[25:19] female back to the garden of eden again
[25:23] and what is that it's all the word amen
[25:26] it's all christ amen and the word is
[25:29] life amen the word is eternal life
[25:33] so so i i don't mean to stumble anybody
[25:37] with my drawings this is just my way of
[25:39] explaining what i'm seeing what i'm
[25:41] understanding because we get images in
[25:44] our mind we see things like a piece of
[25:46] paper a book and and there's a book and
[25:49] and the book is is got writing on it
[25:52] because god had to write it down because
[25:53] he was going to forget who was in the
[25:55] book
[25:57] you see these are symbols for us to
[25:59] understand certain things i don't
[26:01] believe that god i don't believe that
[26:02] god was ever going to forget who was
[26:04] written in that book
[26:06] so i don't think he wrote it down for
[26:08] memory or to keep the name secure amen
[26:11] god foresaw what it means when you see a
[26:14] book a book that sealed is god already
[26:16] knew before the foundation of the world
[26:18] who is part of that word who the seed
[26:21] line is and he was already sealed before
[26:23] the foundation of the world amen
[26:25] so so
[26:27] uh god is not waiting for the seals to
[26:29] come off to find out who's in the book
[26:33] god knows who's in the book amen but
[26:35] when we see a book written and sealed
[26:37] before the foundation of the world it's
[26:39] showing us the symbol the symbology of
[26:42] that is showing us that god already knew
[26:45] who was in that book before the
[26:47] foundation of the world
[26:49] and so god knew
[26:51] where his word would fall and where it
[26:54] would come into manifestation where his
[26:56] seed would fall in what age and he
[26:58] predestinated which seed would fall and
[27:00] then where it would fall what attributes
[27:02] would fall in what age and what would be
[27:04] expressed in each age
[27:07] and he started um after adam fell
[27:09] restoring back the image of a son amen
[27:13] that's why the old testament is male all
[27:15] right and then at calvary he smote him
[27:18] under the rib and took out the
[27:19] ingredients for the female amen and he
[27:22] brought a bride united a bride back to
[27:24] him but we know she fell and there's
[27:26] been a restoration process through the
[27:27] seven church ages to restore back the
[27:29] bride tree to unite the two back
[27:31] together amen that's why the new
[27:33] testament is female amen so now you have
[27:36] the bible which brother branham called
[27:38] the book of redemption which is the book
[27:40] of life
[27:43] so the bible's the book of life the
[27:45] bible is the book of redemption
[27:48] right the bible is the mind of god
[27:50] expressed
[27:52] it's all the same thing and so now
[27:56] okay
[27:57] so the bible
[27:59] is the book of redemption right
[28:01] the bible amen is an expression of the
[28:04] mind of god it's the word of god which
[28:06] is an expression of the thought of god
[28:09] but but
[28:10] before the bible was written god had
[28:13] already declared it in the
[28:14] stars so god had already written it
[28:17] because god had already wrote his bible
[28:20] amen before it began to manifest on the
[28:23] earth it was already finished in god's
[28:25] mind so god put a witness in the stars
[28:28] that i already know what's going to
[28:30] happen and i've already have it
[28:31] determined
[28:33] that right
[28:34] so god has a lamb's book of life sealed
[28:36] because he already knows who his seed is
[28:40] okay so now then he writes it in the
[28:43] pyramid form so we know he's got the
[28:44] same thing that's in the heavens in the
[28:46] pyramid form now as god begins to work
[28:50] his plan amen
[28:52] what was in his mind comes into
[28:53] manifestation over thousands of years
[28:56] bit by bit as it's coming forth what is
[28:59] he doing on earth but he is he is
[29:02] writing on earth in the lives of human
[29:06] beings what is written in the stars and
[29:08] what is written in the stars what was
[29:10] first thought in his mind so what's in
[29:12] the stars is in the pyramid is now in
[29:15] noah
[29:20] before
[29:21] it was written in the bible
[29:25] so that makes noah living word
[29:30] amen
[29:31] and then after noah would live the word
[29:34] amen abraham would live the word moses
[29:38] would live the word amen then god would
[29:40] tell moses to write it down so moses
[29:43] wrote down what was expressed in living
[29:45] word what was god doing he wrote his
[29:48] bible in the heavens he wrote his bible
[29:51] in the pyramid but he's been writing his
[29:53] bible through human life
[29:58] and through the stream of human life has
[30:00] been coming the christ seed the faith
[30:03] seed been moving down through and god is
[30:05] writing his bible in the lives of his
[30:09] children
[30:12] that's why when we get to this day we're
[30:13] written epistles
[30:16] living epistles written of god
[30:19] so
[30:20] so
[30:21] we
[30:22] we've been taught so many things brother
[30:24] venomous shared with us so many things
[30:26] and he'll use all kinds of language all
[30:28] kinds of terminology all kinds of ways
[30:31] of describing but he's describing the
[30:33] same thing over and over again with
[30:36] different terms with different
[30:37] terminologies with different analogies
[30:39] with different parts of the scriptures
[30:40] but it's all telling us the same story
[30:44] that that there has been a a thought
[30:47] that god had something he wanted to
[30:49] achieve a desire that god had as an
[30:52] expression and the entire bible
[30:55] this is what brother brahm tells us in
[30:57] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[30:58] the entire bible is what is expressing
[31:02] what god has wanted to achieve
[31:05] what's the entire bible expressing the
[31:07] entire bible is expressing the thought
[31:09] he had before the foundation of the
[31:11] world when there wasn't a molecule or a
[31:12] speck of stardust or anything else amen
[31:15] god had a plan he had an idea he had a
[31:18] design of expression where he would
[31:20] express himself and as he expressed
[31:22] himself he would become
[31:27] he would become from invisible to
[31:28] visible he would become from uh
[31:31] intangible to tangible
[31:33] and as he was expressing himself he was
[31:35] becoming amen and becoming what was he
[31:38] becoming he was becoming a family he was
[31:41] becoming himself in multiple form amen
[31:44] so that he could fellowship with his
[31:45] attributes his attributes with him his
[31:47] attributes with one another amen as god
[31:49] was writing his bible and living
[31:51] epistles and living uh human beings what
[31:54] was he doing he was expressing himself
[31:57] god was becoming
[32:00] his thought was now coming into
[32:01] manifestation
[32:06] oh praise god
[32:08] all right let's try this see if i can do
[32:10] this praise god it worked
[32:14] all right
[32:16] let's go back to our line
[32:22] i always draw calvary in here
[32:24] one it's a it's a good uh
[32:26] differentiation between old testament
[32:28] new testament but also because that we
[32:31] would come in a fallen condition because
[32:33] of what adam did and because we were
[32:35] coming in the flesh and now our flesh
[32:37] was hybrid and fallen amen there had to
[32:39] be a price paid for everything on this
[32:42] line
[32:44] amen and for everything that would be uh
[32:47] associated with everything on this line
[32:49] let's just put it that way
[32:51] so everything that god created fell amen
[32:54] in this in this creation and this
[32:56] dispensation fell when adam fell and
[32:59] everything that fell when adam fell when
[33:01] christ came as the last adam and shed
[33:03] his blood he redeemed back everything so
[33:05] he purchased back everything and that's
[33:08] why you always have to have a calvary no
[33:10] matter where you are on the line you
[33:11] have to have a calvary
[33:14] so when you were all the way back amen
[33:16] when you were all the way back here
[33:21] okay when you're all the way back here
[33:24] and noah's dispensation
[33:27] you have to have a calvary
[33:30] that didn't look good
[33:32] noah's dispensation you have to have a
[33:34] calvary
[33:36] but noah wasn't alive for calvary
[33:40] but noah
[33:42] amen could receive the word of god for
[33:45] his day
[33:47] and when noah received the word of god
[33:49] for his day he became the expression of
[33:52] that word for his day and he connected
[33:54] himself with the life of that word
[33:58] and when he connected himself by
[34:00] receiving the word and manifesting the
[34:02] word he became connected to that word
[34:05] amen and as that word's moving down
[34:07] through then you have
[34:10] you know an abraham
[34:13] abraham needs a calvary
[34:15] moses needs a calvary david needs a
[34:18] calvary they all need a calvary amen but
[34:21] none of them are here amen to actually
[34:24] watch jesus die at calvary and say i
[34:27] believe that word amen but what they did
[34:30] is they believed christ and received
[34:32] christ in their day and when they
[34:34] received christ they attached himself to
[34:37] the life of that word the life of christ
[34:39] that was moving down through they caught
[34:40] it in their age and now when all of that
[34:43] life is bottled up into one human being
[34:46] amen what noah attached himself to and
[34:49] what moses attached and tells you what
[34:51] abraham attached himself to and what
[34:53] david attached himself to was now
[34:55] standing in the sacrifice
[35:00] all of that word was in him
[35:03] and so everything that was represented
[35:06] in the thought of god in the word of god
[35:08] was in jesus christ and when he paid the
[35:10] price of redemption he redeemed
[35:13] everything that was connected to that
[35:15] line
[35:17] now listen
[35:18] i don't want to stumble you
[35:20] but i'm just going to
[35:22] write this over here
[35:27] i was on that line too
[35:31] now that line hadn't come into
[35:33] expression yet that's what's happening
[35:35] now
[35:38] but i was in christ when christ was here
[35:41] because if i'm part of the word and part
[35:43] of the thought and part of the lamb's
[35:44] book of life i had to be in that
[35:46] expression of flesh when the word was
[35:48] made flesh
[35:49] and that's what brother branham tells us
[35:51] we don't have to pay for our sins
[35:52] because i already paid for my sins when
[35:54] i was in him on the cross
[35:58] so in the thought of god remember god is
[36:00] the one who invented time time means
[36:03] nothing to god when we stretch out a
[36:05] timeline we say this happened first and
[36:07] this happened next and then this
[36:08] happened and way over here thousands of
[36:10] years later they'll come a chad they'll
[36:12] come up brother bob they'll come brother
[36:14] brian they'll all be down here amen and
[36:17] we don't know what's going to happen to
[36:18] them till we get down over here that's
[36:20] not how god thinks amen when god looked
[36:22] down on calvary hey listen god didn't
[36:25] have to wait to look down on calvary to
[36:26] know that you and i would be redeemed
[36:28] before there was a molecule he looked
[36:31] down on calvary and when he looked down
[36:33] on calvary back then he saw you and i
[36:36] all bundled up into that word amen
[36:38] because that word was the very life of
[36:41] god made manifest in this world
[36:46] and he was given created blood and that
[36:48] blood was shed for you and i and it was
[36:51] shed for everyone that was in that
[36:54] thought
[36:57] so
[36:59] although
[37:01] i wasn't there
[37:04] to stand at calvary and say i believe
[37:07] that i'm standing over here a couple
[37:09] thousand years later and i still believe
[37:11] it
[37:14] because that's christ
[37:16] but remember oh
[37:19] praise god
[37:21] there has to be a christ in my day too
[37:26] and i've got to be connected to that
[37:28] christ
[37:32] right
[37:34] and if i'm connected to this christ
[37:37] i'm connected to this christ
[37:42] but what if
[37:44] i refuse my connection to christ
[37:47] and i will not receive the life of
[37:50] christ the manifest word in my day how
[37:52] am i linked to calvary
[37:58] so
[38:01] let's go back here
[38:04] so when we were looking at the the book
[38:06] of life
[38:07] if i could just draw an arrow here
[38:10] and say this is the lamb's book of life
[38:18] or the life of the lamb
[38:22] as it's coming down through
[38:24] in each dispensation it's the word made
[38:27] manifest which was the life of the lamb
[38:30] it's made manifest in each age and each
[38:32] dispensation
[38:34] now
[38:35] all around this line
[38:39] are all kinds of names we already took
[38:41] off abraham we had the three brothers
[38:44] who were in a coalition with him
[38:47] right
[38:48] off david we had he had a friend hiram
[38:51] who was also solomon's friend and helped
[38:53] him build the temple
[38:55] we come down through here and we've got
[38:57] you know peter
[38:59] we've got paul
[39:01] we've got uh
[39:03] seven church ages
[39:06] and the messengers and all the true seed
[39:08] in those seven church ages we've got
[39:09] them all down through there but attached
[39:11] to all them like we took paul and we we
[39:13] talked about the centurion that saved
[39:15] his life there was a centurion that
[39:17] saved his life in jerusalem when they
[39:18] were beating him there was another
[39:20] centurion that took care of him along
[39:21] the journey to rome amen and provided
[39:23] for him to continue in his ministry and
[39:25] protected his life there and obeyed him
[39:27] and all these other things so so there
[39:29] was people associated with paul amen we
[39:32] came down here i'm just going to draw it
[39:33] again we had demas well sorry demas
[39:37] demas was a fellow minister associated
[39:39] with him and in the ministry and through
[39:42] the seven church ages you had
[39:44] you had
[39:46] all kinds of individuals all kinds of
[39:48] names that were associated to this right
[39:51] all the way down through
[39:54] don't try to read those because there's
[39:55] nothing there
[39:58] but but what we're showing is they were
[40:01] they were they were uh
[40:03] attached to or an association
[40:06] amen with that life of christ it was
[40:09] coming down through and that's why
[40:11] this is this is ties in with the being
[40:15] seed of abraham because when you go to
[40:17] genesis chapter 12 in genesis chapter 12
[40:21] amen god comes to abraham and says amen
[40:24] he comes to abraham and i want to i want
[40:27] to ask you this question
[40:29] what did abraham do
[40:31] to get god's attention
[40:35] what did abraham do did he build a
[40:36] temple did he i mean what record do we
[40:38] have that abraham did anything to get
[40:40] god to come down all we know is abraham
[40:43] was living like everybody else was
[40:44] living he was doing what everybody else
[40:46] was doing in life and god come and said
[40:49] abraham amen i want you to leave here
[40:51] and i want you to go to a place i tell
[40:53] you to go to i'm choosing you amen it
[40:56] had nothing to do with abraham it had
[40:58] everything to do with god and the
[40:59] thought he had of abraham before the
[41:01] foundation of the world
[41:03] it didn't matter at that time how many
[41:05] idols abraham was worshiping it didn't
[41:07] matter what abraham was doing amen
[41:09] because abraham was a
[41:11] thought of god a gene of god from before
[41:13] the foundation of the world that was
[41:15] expressing in the day he was living and
[41:17] god had to get him and move him into
[41:19] position because he was part of the plan
[41:21] of redemption he was part of the book
[41:25] so god comes to him amen of no merit of
[41:29] his own that's why amen when you when we
[41:32] come to this revelation of abraham and
[41:34] abraham's seed and you see how god
[41:37] called abraham it should help us relax
[41:39] so much because we're always struggling
[41:42] with am i good enough am i good enough
[41:44] am i good enough and abraham wasn't good
[41:46] enough abraham was foreknown by god god
[41:48] didn't come to abraham because abraham
[41:50] was good enough god came to abraham
[41:52] because god already knew there would be
[41:54] an abraham abraham was the next
[41:56] expression on that line amen and there
[41:59] had to be abraham coming his season come
[42:01] in his time or else the rest of christ
[42:04] would not unfold
[42:07] so he's got to get abraham and he's got
[42:10] to get abraham in position amen with no
[42:12] abraham the plan stops because remember
[42:16] it was already finished in the mind of
[42:18] god and it's already written in the
[42:20] stars of heaven and it's already in
[42:22] stone in the pyramid so now god can't do
[42:26] anything else but get abraham in
[42:28] position
[42:31] because god is not rearranging the stars
[42:34] if the plan is fixed from before the
[42:36] foundation of the world he's not
[42:38] unsealing the book unrolling it and
[42:40] rearranging the names amen and the
[42:43] portion of the book of life called the
[42:44] lamb's book of life it was fixed and
[42:46] sealed before the foundation of the
[42:48] world
[42:50] so because of that
[42:52] god comes to abraham not on the merits
[42:55] of abraham but on the merits of god his
[42:58] thought and his word expressed
[43:02] so he gives abraham
[43:04] and and he brings abraham into position
[43:07] but when he brings abraham into this
[43:08] position there's a great dispensational
[43:11] change that's taking place because
[43:14] before god had he hadn't selected out an
[43:17] individual people or an individual
[43:19] nation god was had all humanity and one
[43:22] lump amen and he was he was dealing with
[43:24] them and when he saw that the corruption
[43:26] of man was was uh wicked and his
[43:29] thoughts were evil all the time and the
[43:30] imagination of his hearts were evil he
[43:32] was going to destroy all of mankind
[43:35] is that true
[43:38] he was going to destroy not just mankind
[43:40] he was going to destroy everything off
[43:42] the earth he was going to stall the
[43:43] earth he was going to destroy everything
[43:45] is that true
[43:47] but then he found one
[43:50] do you think he just found him
[43:55] or do you think he already knew he was
[43:56] there amen
[43:58] and he found noah righteous in all the
[44:00] earth amen and he takes noah and noah is
[44:03] righteous and we know righteousness is
[44:05] imp imputed righteousness because noah
[44:08] believed god and the evidence that noah
[44:10] believed god was that gigantic ark
[44:12] behind him
[44:14] so noah was righteous in his generation
[44:17] amen and so noah amen was critical to
[44:21] the plan of god going forth because god
[44:23] in his justice has got to destroy the
[44:25] earth amen but he finds one in this
[44:28] righteous line one in this seed one on
[44:31] the uh one part of his word a part of
[44:33] his thought that's on the earth an
[44:35] expression of the lamb's book of life an
[44:37] expression of christ
[44:39] is it okay if i use all those terms
[44:43] and he finds that
[44:45] and now
[44:46] what did i do with my pen
[44:48] oh it's up here
[44:51] now
[44:52] through noah
[44:54] because of now of noah
[44:59] the earth is saved
[45:08] because
[45:10] there was an attribute of god on earth
[45:13] because
[45:15] there was an attribute from the book of
[45:17] life
[45:18] because there was part of god's thought
[45:21] god's seed on the earth at that time god
[45:24] could work through that individual and
[45:27] that individual would become salvation
[45:30] to the earth and salvation to the
[45:32] creation
[45:34] because all the animals were going to
[45:36] die without the ark
[45:39] and all humanity would die without the
[45:41] ark and the birds would die without that
[45:44] ark amen so noah coming and expressing
[45:47] christ in his day the word amen he
[45:50] obeyed the word and he created the ark
[45:52] which was the manifestation of the word
[45:54] of god
[45:57] and that manifestation of the word of
[45:58] god became salvation to creation
[46:06] that's why
[46:09] i say
[46:10] that this line
[46:11] is the lamb's book of life
[46:15] then that which is associated
[46:18] around that i'm gonna draw my
[46:21] my circle again
[46:28] is the book of life
[46:34] now
[46:35] just follow me in this thought
[46:39] brother benham says there's a portion or
[46:42] a section of the book of life that's
[46:43] called the lamb's book of life
[46:46] he says it's all the lamb's book of life
[46:48] he has all these different terminologies
[46:50] he said it looks like it's two books but
[46:52] it's really not it's one book
[46:55] but in this book is a record of the seed
[47:00] and that's that red line and all that's
[47:02] on that line now coming down through you
[47:05] can't as it's coming down through you
[47:07] can't tell that's the seed because
[47:10] you all you see
[47:12] is abraham
[47:14] all you see is noah you see is moses but
[47:16] you don't see the life that's working
[47:18] down through that
[47:20] so back behind it i'll say it this way
[47:22] back behind moses was a life of christ
[47:26] behind abraham was the life of the word
[47:28] or the life of christ amen behind david
[47:31] was christ behind all of this was christ
[47:34] and you saw when you looked you saw a
[47:37] man you saw no one you saw moses and you
[47:40] saw abraham and you saw david and you
[47:42] saw these men but you didn't realize
[47:44] that that was god writing in flesh that
[47:48] same bible he wrote in the heavens
[47:52] and we saw flash but we didn't see
[47:55] christ
[47:58] until the opening of the seals and when
[48:01] the seals open we recognize where christ
[48:03] was all along amen
[48:07] because god was writing his word
[48:10] in the lives of flesh human beings who
[48:12] were manifesting that word god was
[48:14] writing his bible remember what we have
[48:18] here came after it was expressed on the
[48:21] earth
[48:23] or after the prophet gave us prophecy
[48:25] then it was recorded after amen after
[48:28] paul's ministry began paul began to
[48:30] write epistles right right so they were
[48:32] writing it was happening it happened
[48:34] then moses wrote what happened so so
[48:37] this is a record of god manifesting his
[48:41] word in human beings
[48:44] that's our bible
[48:47] so you could say that that line is the
[48:48] bible
[48:50] is that right yes
[48:53] so all that's around that associated
[48:55] with that
[48:56] amen
[48:57] just like in noah's dispensation
[49:01] because of noah
[49:03] it could receive life
[49:07] i'll say it maybe i'll word it
[49:09] differently
[49:11] if you take the book of life that circle
[49:14] i draw
[49:15] and take out the seed life
[49:18] you have no life
[49:21] and all the same names will be there
[49:25] but if you take out the seed life
[49:28] there's no life but in the lamb's book
[49:31] of life because there's a section of the
[49:34] record of the seed which is the mind of
[49:36] god which is the thought of god which
[49:37] are the attributes of god which are the
[49:39] seed genes of god which is god himself
[49:41] broken up into forms
[49:44] because that's contained in the book of
[49:46] life
[49:47] now everything in the book of life can
[49:50] have life because of the stream of life
[49:53] that's in the book of life
[49:55] but if you take the stream of life out
[49:57] there's no life
[50:01] i hope you understand
[50:02] so i hope you don't think that i'm just
[50:04] just
[50:05] off my rocker
[50:07] but then those who are re those who are
[50:11] saved in the book of life who are not
[50:13] necessarily the seed gene of god the
[50:16] seed thought of god amen they're coming
[50:19] in under a covenant that god made with
[50:22] abraham because now when he chose
[50:23] abraham listen for no
[50:26] good earthly reason he chose abraham
[50:30] there was no good earthly reason for him
[50:32] to choose abraham there was a good
[50:33] heavenly reason but there was no good
[50:35] earthly reason
[50:36] but he chose abraham and before abraham
[50:39] could do anything before abraham obeyed
[50:42] his first commandment god said hey let's
[50:45] go to let's go to genesis 12 and just
[50:47] read it let's go to genesis 12.
[50:50] because i don't want to just quote it i
[50:52] want to read it together
[51:03] genesis 12 verse 1
[51:07] now the lord had said unto abraham get
[51:09] thee out
[51:11] of thy country and from thy kindred and
[51:13] from thy father's house unto a land that
[51:15] i will show thee
[51:16] god had
[51:18] god had already showed him this
[51:21] before because this is what he said the
[51:23] lord had said
[51:26] but before he could fully obey that tyra
[51:28] his dad took him and lot and took him
[51:31] from ur up to hiran amen and so brother
[51:34] bam tells us he didn't fully obey the
[51:36] voice of god
[51:38] because he went with his daddy and went
[51:40] with a lot and so now tyra dies amen but
[51:44] then it tells us tyra dies here at the
[51:46] end of chapter 11 but chapter 12 says
[51:48] now the lord had said the lord's not
[51:50] saying again it's telling us what the
[51:52] lord had said before
[51:54] this was before abraham obeyed
[51:57] are you with me before abraham obeyed
[52:00] the word the scripture says now the lord
[52:02] had said unto abram get thee out of thy
[52:05] country and from thy kindred and from
[52:07] thy father's house unto a land that i
[52:08] will show thee and i will make of thee a
[52:11] great nation and i will bless thee and
[52:13] make thy name great and thou shalt be a
[52:15] blessing and i will bless them that
[52:17] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[52:19] thee and in thee shall all the families
[52:21] of the earth be blessed
[52:24] praise god amen that that covenant with
[52:28] abraham is a new kind of covenant that
[52:32] god has not made yet before amen he had
[52:35] a covenant with adam if you don't eat
[52:37] this amen it'll be fine if you eat this
[52:39] you'll die adam broke the covenant he
[52:42] made a covenant with noah amen noah
[52:44] couldn't keep the covenant the
[52:45] generation after noah they went to build
[52:47] the tower of babel and started a false
[52:49] religion and started all of this stuff
[52:51] and god come down and because he swore
[52:53] he would never destroy all flesh again
[52:55] amen he couldn't destroy him in the
[52:56] tower of babel so what he did was
[52:58] confounded their languages and separated
[53:00] them
[53:01] and after he confounded their languages
[53:04] and separated them he pulls out one
[53:08] and he says i'm going to start
[53:09] redemption
[53:11] right here
[53:13] and he tells abraham
[53:15] you're going to be for a blessing
[53:19] and i will bless them that bless you
[53:21] and curse them that curse you
[53:25] and we are still under that same
[53:27] blessing all the royal seed from that
[53:30] day on the faith seed from that day on
[53:32] are under that blessing
[53:34] and that has everything to do with the
[53:36] book of life
[53:39] right
[53:40] because when we get up here to demas
[53:42] when demas forsook paul
[53:47] when demons forsook paul
[53:49] his name was removed from the book of
[53:51] life
[53:53] we know that right here we had judah
[53:56] or judas
[53:58] judas walked with jesus was a partaker
[54:00] in the ministry a true ministry gifts of
[54:02] healing we know all of that his name was
[54:04] in the book of life
[54:06] but because
[54:07] he cursed christ and fought against
[54:10] christ
[54:11] his name was removed from the book of
[54:12] life
[54:15] well whose names remained
[54:17] brother branham said
[54:19] like nicodemus
[54:21] and gamaliel
[54:23] who helped the children of israel in a
[54:25] time and stood up for them what did
[54:27] gamaliel do remember when they were
[54:29] persecuting the christians after the
[54:31] resurrection of jesus christ after
[54:32] pentecost they were persecuting the
[54:34] christians and gamaliel said leave them
[54:36] alone
[54:38] he said if it's of god you'll find
[54:40] yourself fighting god if if it's not
[54:42] it'll come to not that's all he did
[54:46] and brother branham said perhaps it's
[54:48] gamalia and nicodemus that are those
[54:50] that have their names on the book of
[54:51] life because he stood up for the elect
[54:53] of god what was he standing up for he
[54:55] wasn't standing up for peter he wasn't
[54:57] standing up for john he was standing up
[55:00] for that life that was in peter that
[55:02] life that was in paul
[55:05] and and nicodemus too who was a help and
[55:08] and and stood up for jesus in the
[55:10] council
[55:12] and he said something like is it right
[55:14] amen to persecute a man without a trial
[55:17] first or condemn a man with no trial and
[55:20] they looked at him and said are you one
[55:21] of his disciples too he stood up for
[55:23] christ and brother branham used those
[55:25] two as an example who could be in the
[55:27] book of life
[55:30] and so you realize
[55:34] if christ was not expressed in that day
[55:39] what would those two men do
[55:42] to have a chance at life
[55:45] i hope you follow me
[55:48] you take the lamb's book of life
[55:51] and you remove the record of the seed
[55:53] there's no life
[55:56] but because of the record of the seed
[55:59] now
[56:00] there's a chance for life
[56:06] and
[56:08] well i just don't know any other way to
[56:09] say it just say it that way
[56:12] so now
[56:13] what are you doing here on this earth
[56:15] amen
[56:17] under the blessing of abraham you're
[56:18] here to be a blessing amen
[56:21] there's a manifestation of christ in
[56:23] this day amen and not everybody is is
[56:27] ordained in the foreknowledge of god to
[56:29] be part of that seed life amen but
[56:31] because god started dealing amen with
[56:34] humanity in a certain way under abraham
[56:37] amen now there's a blessing that can
[56:39] come under that covenant which we're
[56:42] still part of there's a blessing that
[56:44] can come amen to those that will bless
[56:46] that life amen but there's a curse that
[56:48] will come to those that will curse that
[56:50] life
[56:52] so now we see
[56:54] that the the those in the book of life
[56:57] they receive life
[57:00] because of their association or their
[57:02] conduct or action towards the record of
[57:06] life of the record of the lamb's life
[57:10] god's life the life of the seed
[57:13] that's contained in the book of life
[57:17] that's what gives them life because
[57:21] brother brahma tells us that they don't
[57:23] already have eternal life
[57:26] only that seed that's on that line are
[57:28] the only ones that already possess
[57:30] eternal life
[57:32] but they're they're allowed to come into
[57:35] eternal life at the white throne
[57:36] judgment based off what they did with
[57:39] the word that they came in contact with
[57:43] amen
[57:44] so
[57:45] praise be to god
[57:48] where do we go from here
[57:50] oh
[57:51] let's draw another picture
[57:56] so
[58:00] let's go back to this line
[58:03] i'm just going to be on this half
[58:07] so when we come to abraham
[58:16] god
[58:17] is
[58:19] he is writing on earth
[58:22] in the life of abraham
[58:24] what he's already written in the stars
[58:26] in heaven
[58:30] and so now
[58:32] as abraham's moving
[58:35] whatever's happening to abraham
[58:38] god is watchful over abraham's life
[58:42] he knows what's happening with abraham
[58:45] because it's critical what happens to
[58:47] abraham is critical to god's plan of
[58:50] redemption
[58:51] the restoration of the masterpiece
[58:54] and and so god's eye is on abraham
[58:57] because what happens to abraham matters
[59:01] oh my goodness there is no way we're
[59:02] going to get anywhere close
[59:06] all right
[59:07] i'm going to read this quote this is
[59:08] really familiar we've been reading this
[59:10] for quite some time out of crisis the
[59:11] mystery god revealed he says now you see
[59:13] the seals when he was in his mediator
[59:15] work back there redeeming but someday he
[59:18] comes forth to get this book that he's
[59:19] redeemed
[59:20] and all that's in this book would be him
[59:22] for that's the believer the words in the
[59:24] book and the word
[59:26] is him
[59:28] so that's what was expressed in each day
[59:31] or each age the words in the book and
[59:33] all that's in that book would be him
[59:37] all right
[59:42] all right let's go to genesis chapter 12
[59:45] or we're here in genesis chapter 12.
[59:47] let's go to verse 10.
[59:51] i'm going to try to finish up with this
[59:53] thought here
[59:56] and there was a famine in the land and
[59:58] abram went down into egypt to so join
[1:00:01] there for the famine was grievous in the
[1:00:03] land
[1:00:04] and it came to pass when he was come
[1:00:06] near to enter into egypt that he said
[1:00:09] unto sarah his wife behold now i know
[1:00:11] that thou art a fair woman to look upon
[1:00:14] therefore it shall come to pass when the
[1:00:16] egyptians shall see thee that they shall
[1:00:18] say this is the this is his wife and
[1:00:20] they will kill me but they will save
[1:00:22] thee alive
[1:00:24] say i pray thee thou art my sister that
[1:00:26] it may be well with me for thy sake and
[1:00:28] my soul shall live because of thee
[1:00:31] and it came to pass that when abram was
[1:00:33] coming to egypt
[1:00:34] that the egyptians beheld the woman that
[1:00:36] she was very fair
[1:00:38] and the princes also of pharaoh saw her
[1:00:40] and commended her before pharaoh and the
[1:00:42] woman was taken into pharaoh's house
[1:00:44] and he entreated abram well for her sake
[1:00:47] and he had sheep and oxen and asses and
[1:00:49] men servants and maidservants and shias
[1:00:51] and camels and the lord plagued pharaoh
[1:00:54] in his house with great plagues because
[1:00:57] of sarai abram's wife
[1:00:59] and pharaoh called abram and said what
[1:01:02] is this that thou has done unto me why
[1:01:04] does thou not tell me that she is thy
[1:01:06] wife
[1:01:07] why said thou she is my sister so i
[1:01:10] might have taken her to be my wife now
[1:01:12] therefore behold behold thy wife take
[1:01:14] her and go thy way and pharaoh commanded
[1:01:17] his men concerning him and they sent him
[1:01:19] away and his wife and all that he had
[1:01:22] now when we look at this story
[1:01:24] we see
[1:01:25] we see that
[1:01:26] abraham now goes down into egypt which
[1:01:29] is a place he's not supposed to be
[1:01:32] because god told him to sojourn in that
[1:01:33] land
[1:01:35] and the land of promise but he left
[1:01:37] because the time of famine he went down
[1:01:39] into egypt to sojourn in egypt and while
[1:01:42] he was there he tells his wife we read
[1:01:44] the whole story and so pharaoh takes her
[1:01:46] into his home amen and then god begins
[1:01:49] to curse pharaoh with plagues
[1:01:54] now pharaoh didn't know he was doing
[1:01:56] anything wrong
[1:01:58] and abraham wasn't abram that i wasn't
[1:02:01] doing anything right
[1:02:06] but god
[1:02:08] already had a plan written in the stars
[1:02:11] which came from the thought in his mind
[1:02:13] before the foundation of the world which
[1:02:14] was reflected in the stars which was
[1:02:16] reflected in that pyramid and god can't
[1:02:18] change his plan and that plan comes down
[1:02:22] here
[1:02:23] on the plan
[1:02:24] that part of abraham
[1:02:27] is sarah
[1:02:29] they're connected together
[1:02:32] they are one in the mind of god
[1:02:35] and out of this union is going to come
[1:02:38] in isaac
[1:02:39] because isaac
[1:02:41] is in the stars
[1:02:44] because isaac was in god's mind
[1:02:47] because isaac was on the lam's book of
[1:02:48] life
[1:02:50] so he was in the stars so he's in the
[1:02:52] pyramid
[1:02:54] so isaac has to come forth from abraham
[1:02:56] and sarah so god god is not looking down
[1:03:00] there and saying oh poor sarah she don't
[1:03:02] want to be in that fix i feel sorry for
[1:03:03] sarah it's not that kind of thought god
[1:03:06] is protecting his own word amen god is
[1:03:09] watching after his word and he's
[1:03:11] guarding his word and he's plaguing
[1:03:13] pharaoh because of his word amen it
[1:03:16] wasn't that pharaoh was such a rotten
[1:03:18] guy and did a horrible thing pharaoh
[1:03:20] hadn't done anything wrong as far as he
[1:03:22] knew
[1:03:24] but god was watching over his word
[1:03:26] because that word can't change
[1:03:29] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:03:30] forever god has to bring forth his word
[1:03:33] so isaac has to come forth from the
[1:03:35] bowels of abraham through sarah his
[1:03:38] lawful wife these two have already
[1:03:40] become one in the mind of god and now
[1:03:42] from there has to come isaac so god is
[1:03:44] protecting sarah not because he felt
[1:03:46] sorry for sarah he's protecting sarah
[1:03:48] because of his word
[1:03:53] so
[1:03:54] so then
[1:03:55] oh praise god let's keep going let's go
[1:03:58] to genesis 20. i want to do this quickly
[1:04:01] last time i told you how long i was
[1:04:02] going to preach and i'm not going to do
[1:04:03] that anymore
[1:04:05] because it just makes me say things that
[1:04:07] aren't true and i feel guilty afterwards
[1:04:09] and i have to repent i'm just not even
[1:04:11] going to do that
[1:04:13] but there's just you just bear with me
[1:04:14] for a few minutes there's a really
[1:04:15] important thought i want to get to and
[1:04:17] share with you before we move on genesis
[1:04:19] 20 and verse 1
[1:04:22] and abraham journeyed from thence toward
[1:04:24] the south country and dwelled between
[1:04:26] kadish and sure and and sojourned in
[1:04:28] gerar and abraham said of sarah his wife
[1:04:31] she is my sister and abimelech king of
[1:04:32] gerard sent and took sarah
[1:04:35] but god came to abimelech in a dream by
[1:04:37] night and said to him behold thou art
[1:04:38] but a dead man for the woman which thou
[1:04:41] hast taken for she is a man's wife and
[1:04:43] abimelech had not come near her and he
[1:04:45] said lord will thou slay also a
[1:04:47] righteous nation
[1:04:49] said he not unto me she is my sister and
[1:04:51] she even she herself said he is my
[1:04:53] brother and the integrity of my heart
[1:04:55] and the innocency of my hands have i
[1:04:57] done this and god said unto him in a
[1:05:00] dream yea i know that thou didst this in
[1:05:03] the integrity of thy heart for i also
[1:05:05] withheld thee from sinning
[1:05:07] against
[1:05:08] me
[1:05:12] he did not stop abimelech from sinning
[1:05:15] against sarah
[1:05:18] that's not why he came down to him in a
[1:05:20] dream that's not why he smote them with
[1:05:24] curses and closed their wombs because
[1:05:25] that had already taken place at this
[1:05:26] time
[1:05:28] he had he had come down to speak to him
[1:05:30] in a dream abimelech was not what
[1:05:32] abraham was abraham was the seed line
[1:05:36] abimelech was not but abimelech was
[1:05:38] righteous because he wasn't doing this
[1:05:40] intentionally
[1:05:43] and because abimelech was righteous
[1:05:46] god came to him
[1:05:48] and said you're but a dead man
[1:05:51] you're under a curse
[1:05:53] the wounds are already shut up in your
[1:05:55] nation and you're going to die because
[1:05:58] you've taken a man's wife and he says
[1:06:00] you know the integrity of my heart he
[1:06:02] told me he lied to me
[1:06:04] and god says i know the integrity of
[1:06:05] your heart that's why i kept you from
[1:06:08] sinning against me what was he doing he
[1:06:11] was protecting his word because isaac
[1:06:14] had to come from sarah and abraham
[1:06:16] amen and so abimelech didn't know it but
[1:06:20] bhimalek was standing in opposition to
[1:06:22] the word of god he was going to hinder
[1:06:25] the word he was going to stop the word
[1:06:27] he was going to derail the word so god
[1:06:29] comes down supernaturally injects
[1:06:32] himself into the situation because he
[1:06:34] has to manifest what's in his mind he
[1:06:36] has to manifest what's written in the
[1:06:38] last book of life he has to manifest
[1:06:39] what's written in the stars do you get
[1:06:41] what i'm saying
[1:06:43] so now god has to come down he has to
[1:06:46] play he has to warn he has to speak
[1:06:48] because he's got to preserve this womb
[1:06:50] because it's this is his plan and from
[1:06:53] there the word is coming forth
[1:06:56] to stop that word from coming forth
[1:06:59] brings a curse and brings death
[1:07:03] even though abimelech wasn't aware of it
[1:07:06] even though pharaoh wasn't aware of it
[1:07:09] they weren't doing it intentionally but
[1:07:11] to come against the word even
[1:07:13] unintentionally will bring death because
[1:07:16] the word is life and to come against
[1:07:18] life is death
[1:07:21] so the movement of life in that day was
[1:07:24] coming from abraham through sarah unto
[1:07:27] isaac and that was the movement of life
[1:07:30] and to stop that would bring death and
[1:07:32] curses upon you
[1:07:35] so god was coming down to protect his
[1:07:37] word
[1:07:42] god
[1:07:49] i want to read one more let's go to
[1:07:51] genesis 22.
[1:07:56] i hope this gets clearer and clearer
[1:07:59] and clearer
[1:08:02] genesis 22
[1:08:04] and 6
[1:08:07] and abraham took the wood of the burnt
[1:08:09] offering and laid it upon
[1:08:11] isaac his son and he took the fire in
[1:08:13] his hand and a knife and they went both
[1:08:15] of them together and isaac spoken to
[1:08:17] abraham his father and said my father
[1:08:20] and he said here am i my son
[1:08:22] he said behold the fire and the wood
[1:08:25] but where is the lamb for the burnt
[1:08:26] offering
[1:08:28] and abraham said my son
[1:08:30] god will provide himself
[1:08:32] a lamb
[1:08:34] for a burnt offering
[1:08:36] so they went both of them together
[1:08:39] and they came to the place which god had
[1:08:41] told him of and abraham built an altar
[1:08:43] there and laid the wood in order and
[1:08:45] bound isaac his son and laid him on the
[1:08:47] altar upon the wood
[1:08:49] and abraham stretched forth his hand and
[1:08:51] took the knife to slay his son and the
[1:08:53] angel the lord called unto him out of
[1:08:55] heaven and said abraham abraham and he
[1:08:58] said here am i he said lay not thine
[1:09:00] hand upon the land neither do thou
[1:09:02] anything unto him for now i know that
[1:09:04] thou fearest god seeing that thou hast
[1:09:06] not withheld thy son thine only son for
[1:09:09] me
[1:09:10] and abraham lifted up his eyes and
[1:09:12] looked and behold behind him a ram
[1:09:14] caught in the thicket by his horns and
[1:09:16] abraham went and took the ram and
[1:09:17] offered him up for a burnt offering
[1:09:19] instead of his son and abraham called
[1:09:22] the name of the place jehovah jireh as
[1:09:24] it is said to this day in the mount of
[1:09:26] the lord it shall be seen
[1:09:29] let's turn over to hebrews chapter 11.
[1:09:35] hebrews chapter 11 and verse 17.
[1:09:45] hebrews 11
[1:09:47] 17
[1:09:49] by faith abraham when he was tried
[1:09:52] offered up isaac
[1:09:54] and he that had received the promise
[1:09:56] offered up his only begotten son
[1:09:58] of whom it was said that in isaac shall
[1:10:00] all the seed be called
[1:10:02] accounting that god was able to raise
[1:10:04] him up even from the dead from whence
[1:10:06] also he received him
[1:10:08] and a figure
[1:10:11] listen
[1:10:13] abraham was given a commission
[1:10:16] abraham's told to go
[1:10:19] and kill isaac
[1:10:22] but abraham
[1:10:24] is a seed of faith
[1:10:27] abraham
[1:10:28] received isaac as from the dead with a
[1:10:31] pro by a promise
[1:10:34] and he knows that god has said in isaac
[1:10:37] so thy seed be called and that is the
[1:10:39] word of god that cannot change
[1:10:42] so now
[1:10:43] this is the word of god
[1:10:47] and he's told to go and kill isaac
[1:10:51] so abraham by this stage in his journey
[1:10:54] he's learned not to question he's
[1:10:55] learned to obey
[1:10:57] so he's going in obedience and as
[1:10:59] they're walking up in obedience he's
[1:11:01] taking his son he's taking the fire he's
[1:11:03] taking the wood he's got everything for
[1:11:04] a sacrifice and isaac looks and says dad
[1:11:07] we've got everything for a sacrifice and
[1:11:09] he says listen he says where is the lamb
[1:11:12] and he says god shall provide himself a
[1:11:15] lamb
[1:11:17] amen what is he saying
[1:11:19] god has to take care of this amen i'm
[1:11:22] going up here he's going up with every
[1:11:24] intention of slaying his son but hebrews
[1:11:26] tells us that he believed that god even
[1:11:28] if he slays him god can raise him up
[1:11:30] from the dead because he knows that in
[1:11:32] isaac shall thy seed be called isaac
[1:11:35] must live god cannot kill his own word
[1:11:39] isaac's not just abraham's son isaac is
[1:11:41] the manifested word of god and the seed
[1:11:44] of abraham was going to be called
[1:11:45] through isaac isaac cannot stay dead
[1:11:48] isaac's got to come back to life and
[1:11:50] that's the faith that abraham goes to
[1:11:52] mount moriah with
[1:11:54] he so
[1:11:56] knew that god had preserved sarah
[1:11:58] stopped him in pharaoh's house stopped
[1:12:00] him in a bemalex house and he knew that
[1:12:02] this is the promised seed that in isaac
[1:12:04] shall thy seed be called not in ishmael
[1:12:06] but in isaac and he knew by this stage
[1:12:09] in the journey he has come to perfect
[1:12:11] faith and he knows now that god's word
[1:12:13] will never fail and that even if i slay
[1:12:16] him god will raise him up from the dead
[1:12:18] because in isaac shall my seed be called
[1:12:22] so he's going there with a heart perfect
[1:12:24] in faith and perfect obedience to god
[1:12:27] not knowing what will happen but
[1:12:28] believing god will raise him up
[1:12:34] so what did god do
[1:12:36] i want to ask you a question
[1:12:39] did god provide abraham a ram
[1:12:43] and the thickets
[1:12:45] no he did not
[1:12:46] god provided himself a ram and the
[1:12:49] thickets
[1:12:52] that ram was not for abraham and that
[1:12:55] ram was not for isaac that ram was for
[1:12:58] god amen because god cannot kill his own
[1:13:00] word amen he's got to offer a substitute
[1:13:03] and he offers the substitute because
[1:13:04] he's already said in isaac shall thy
[1:13:06] seed be called god provided himself a
[1:13:09] lamb
[1:13:11] is that what the scripture says
[1:13:14] here's what brother branham says about
[1:13:15] that
[1:13:17] and possessing the gate of the enemy
[1:13:18] after the trial did you ever think where
[1:13:20] did the ram come from remember the
[1:13:22] country is full of lions and wolves and
[1:13:24] jackals and the sheep devouring beast
[1:13:26] and how far back from civilization was
[1:13:28] he and then up on top of the mountain
[1:13:30] where there is no water and he had
[1:13:32] picked up the stones all around to make
[1:13:34] the altar where did that ram come from
[1:13:36] but it wasn't a vision he killed the ram
[1:13:38] it had blood what did he say god is able
[1:13:41] to provide for himself a sacrifice
[1:13:45] god was preserving his word with this he
[1:13:48] created a ram in the thickets to
[1:13:51] preserve his word
[1:13:53] he supernaturally injected himself into
[1:13:57] the situation amen to preserve the word
[1:14:01] oh praise be the god
[1:14:04] he said how are you going to come out of
[1:14:05] that chair
[1:14:07] how is that child going to get
[1:14:08] well are you from that chair are you
[1:14:11] from there you heart you with the heart
[1:14:12] trouble whatever's the matter god is
[1:14:15] able to provide himself amen abraham
[1:14:17] believed that the patriarch stayed true
[1:14:19] to the promise and he gave the promise
[1:14:21] that your seed because you believed my
[1:14:23] word and regardless of what the
[1:14:25] circumstances your seed shall possess
[1:14:27] the gate of the enemy
[1:14:29] why every enemy that come up is a figure
[1:14:32] against abraham the enemy of she's too
[1:14:34] old i'm too old all this and everything
[1:14:36] else he still stayed right true to that
[1:14:38] promise
[1:14:39] now the man that possesses that faith
[1:14:42] still will take god's word regardless of
[1:14:44] circumstances now if you can't do that
[1:14:47] then you're not abraham's seed that's
[1:14:49] the faith that abraham had his seed
[1:14:52] abraham was so convinced
[1:14:56] that god would keep his word and that
[1:14:59] isaac was a manifestation of that word
[1:15:01] he was going up there to obey god he was
[1:15:04] not going to disobey god he was going to
[1:15:06] obey god and when isaac asked him the
[1:15:08] question where's the lamb he said god
[1:15:09] will provide for himself a lamb
[1:15:12] i don't know and he even believed when
[1:15:14] we read hebrews he even believed in
[1:15:15] himself that if he slayed him god would
[1:15:17] raise him up from the dead but one thing
[1:15:19] abraham did not believe is he did not
[1:15:22] believe that isaac would die and stay
[1:15:24] dead
[1:15:25] because he believed the word of god and
[1:15:28] that was the word for that hour
[1:15:32] and god injected himself
[1:15:35] in the situation
[1:15:37] provide
[1:15:40] oh praise god
[1:15:55] down here we got a bride
[1:15:59] that bride
[1:16:01] is the manifestation of the promised
[1:16:03] word for this hour
[1:16:06] she is part of the book of life
[1:16:09] she is a record of that seed
[1:16:11] she is the restored tree of life as the
[1:16:13] bride tree
[1:16:15] she is all of those things
[1:16:19] listen do you believe that
[1:16:22] do you believe you're part of that
[1:16:25] then nothing can defeat that in your
[1:16:28] life
[1:16:30] it's not because god feels sorry for you
[1:16:33] it's not because you have a sweet
[1:16:35] disposition and god feels sorry for you
[1:16:37] so he's going to heal you and he's going
[1:16:38] to deliver you and he's going to provide
[1:16:40] for you god is watching after his word
[1:16:42] in you amen how many times in your life
[1:16:44] has god supernaturally injected himself
[1:16:47] in your situation to stop you from
[1:16:49] something to heal you to deliver you to
[1:16:51] change the circumstances supernaturally
[1:16:53] what was that it wasn't god feeling
[1:16:55] sorry for you it was god watching over
[1:16:57] the dispensation of his word for this
[1:16:59] hour
[1:17:00] you have to be here you have to do
[1:17:02] whatever the stars say you're going to
[1:17:04] do you have to do it here
[1:17:07] do you believe one of those stars
[1:17:08] represent you
[1:17:10] amen do you believe that you're in the
[1:17:12] lamb's book of life do you believe that
[1:17:13] you were in the thoughts of god and he
[1:17:15] already forced all you would do then
[1:17:16] you're going to do it in no plan of the
[1:17:18] devil nothing you can decide or anybody
[1:17:21] else can decide will ever stop that plan
[1:17:23] from moving forward god will
[1:17:25] supernaturally inject himself into the
[1:17:27] situation he'll change kingdoms he'll
[1:17:29] move circumstances he will move
[1:17:31] mountains literally to keep that word
[1:17:34] progressing forward
[1:17:38] oh
[1:17:40] like i said before there's so much of my
[1:17:41] heart i'm just going to wrap up with
[1:17:43] this thought
[1:17:44] we take this thought and we look at the
[1:17:45] apostle paul as the apostle paul was
[1:17:47] coming down through he was the
[1:17:49] manifestation of the word for that day
[1:17:50] he was an old testament prophecy of you
[1:17:53] shall be enlightened to the gentiles
[1:17:56] and he had to go to the gentiles and he
[1:17:58] had to take the message of grace
[1:18:01] he was the vessel nobody else was
[1:18:04] how many times did god inject himself in
[1:18:06] the situation to rescue paul
[1:18:10] because paul had to keep manifesting
[1:18:12] what was already written in god's mind
[1:18:15] what was in the land's book of life what
[1:18:17] was in the story you get the point
[1:18:20] you can't rearrange the stones in the
[1:18:21] pyramid
[1:18:23] you can't move the stars around
[1:18:25] so what does god have to do he comes
[1:18:27] down and injects himself in the
[1:18:29] situation amen to keep his plan moving
[1:18:31] forward
[1:18:33] but listen god also did not encase paul
[1:18:36] in a bubble
[1:18:38] and nothing ever happened to paul
[1:18:40] paul was beaten
[1:18:42] paul was stoned and left for dead
[1:18:44] but it was god who raised him back up
[1:18:47] paul was put in prison but it was god
[1:18:48] who opened the doors
[1:18:51] paul was besieged in the city but it was
[1:18:52] god who helped him get over the wall and
[1:18:54] escape
[1:18:55] amen
[1:18:57] it was demon forces that tried to sink a
[1:18:59] ship in a storm amen but it was god who
[1:19:00] preserved his life through the sunken
[1:19:02] ship
[1:19:03] amen it was a devil that caused the
[1:19:05] snake to bite him in the hand but it was
[1:19:07] god who kept him from having any effect
[1:19:09] of the venom and shook it off
[1:19:12] paul was bitten beaten paul was bitten
[1:19:14] paul was hungry amen paul was rejected
[1:19:17] paul was he was beaten with whips he was
[1:19:20] beaten with rods
[1:19:22] god didn't encase him in a bubble and
[1:19:24] say nothing's ever going to happen to
[1:19:26] you neither did he brother branham
[1:19:29] but when brother branham was shot god
[1:19:30] saved his life
[1:19:34] when he had an amoeba that would take
[1:19:35] his life god healed him
[1:19:37] why there was a plan there was he was
[1:19:40] expressing of god's word of god's
[1:19:42] thought and that had to come to fruition
[1:19:44] god had to inject himself on the scene
[1:19:46] amen and this isn't a perfect life like
[1:19:49] i'm the word of god i'm an expressed
[1:19:50] word of god nothing will touch me you'll
[1:19:52] get sick you'll get tired you'll be in a
[1:19:55] car wreck you'll lose money
[1:20:00] is that right
[1:20:02] did that happen to brother branham
[1:20:04] was he in a tax case
[1:20:08] was he shot
[1:20:09] was he sick
[1:20:11] did he get rejected
[1:20:13] did he get the asian flu
[1:20:15] did he have people steal his property
[1:20:18] why didn't god stop all of that amen
[1:20:21] it's all part of god's plan god's
[1:20:22] molding his character he's manifesting i
[1:20:24] don't know what all he's doing god is
[1:20:26] doing something but any time that
[1:20:28] prophet gets into a life-threatening
[1:20:29] situation that'll end the manifestation
[1:20:31] of god god turns it around heals him
[1:20:34] restores him delivers him moves him
[1:20:36] forward nothing will stop the plan of
[1:20:38] god from moving forward
[1:20:40] nothing can conve defeat god's word
[1:20:44] but that same prophet who was delivered
[1:20:46] and delivered and delivered died in a
[1:20:48] car crash
[1:20:51] that same prophet apostle paul who was
[1:20:54] saved out of shipwreck saved from the
[1:20:56] snake bite saved from the beatings saved
[1:20:59] from the mobs
[1:21:01] he was beheaded in rome
[1:21:05] because until your purpose is fulfilled
[1:21:08] in this earth you can't leave this earth
[1:21:11] and anything that will hinder your
[1:21:13] purpose in manifesting your portion of
[1:21:15] the word god has got to move it out of
[1:21:17] the way so that you can continue to
[1:21:19] manifest the word
[1:21:21] i mean we get the wrong concept of being
[1:21:23] a child of god on the wrong concept of
[1:21:24] being in the word we get this concept
[1:21:26] and now i don't know why i'm suffering
[1:21:27] with the sickness if i can just get over
[1:21:29] there maybe i'm not even a believer cast
[1:21:31] that devil off of you amen and read your
[1:21:34] bible
[1:21:37] god doesn't insulate his word god
[1:21:39] doesn't insulate the vessels carrying
[1:21:41] his word from any trouble amen even
[1:21:43] jesus got tired in his earthly ministry
[1:21:48] brother branham said he groaned with a
[1:21:49] headache
[1:21:52] so god is not here to we're the word and
[1:21:54] he insulates us
[1:21:55] and
[1:21:56] packs
[1:21:57] you know downy feathers all around and
[1:21:59] nothing this is the life of the word
[1:22:02] nothing bad ever happens to them
[1:22:04] no we're all subject to this life and
[1:22:06] there's a learning process that comes
[1:22:08] through being subject to this life and
[1:22:10] coming into a cursed fallen condition so
[1:22:12] that we can learn redemption we can
[1:22:13] learn healing we can learn salvation we
[1:22:15] can learn deliverance so that we can
[1:22:17] know god like we could never know god
[1:22:19] any other way and god is not going to
[1:22:21] take all that from us because that also
[1:22:23] serves a purpose
[1:22:26] but the troubles don't define us
[1:22:29] the troubles only mold us and push us
[1:22:31] into expression
[1:22:34] but anything that would stop the
[1:22:36] progress of god's word god will defeat
[1:22:39] it every time
[1:22:42] and so
[1:22:44] the reason i'm saying all of this
[1:22:47] is so that we can relax
[1:22:52] do you believe that you were in the mind
[1:22:54] of god before the foundation of the
[1:22:55] world and you're part of this bride in
[1:22:56] this last day
[1:22:59] and i'm going to tell you to relax
[1:23:03] god's got it all under control have
[1:23:06] faith and believe god if something's
[1:23:08] going to take your life say it's not
[1:23:09] going to take my life unless god's
[1:23:11] purpose will be done on this earth that
[1:23:13] devil's got to go i don't believe god's
[1:23:15] done with me i believe i got more life
[1:23:16] that thing has got to go
[1:23:20] but remember when the apostle paul got
[1:23:22] to the end of his life he wasn't
[1:23:23] dreading death
[1:23:25] apostle paul said i've run my race i
[1:23:28] finished my course now there's a crown
[1:23:29] of life waiting for me
[1:23:32] he was he was happy to move on and i
[1:23:35] tell you if a seed or attribute of god
[1:23:37] has come to the end of his manifestation
[1:23:39] on this earth why does he want to stay
[1:23:41] here any longer
[1:23:43] let's move on let's not be afraid of
[1:23:46] anything let's not be worried about
[1:23:48] anything let's commit it to god and keep
[1:23:50] moving forward because we're here to
[1:23:52] express the life we're here to be the
[1:23:54] manifestation of the word don't let
[1:23:56] anything trip you up stumble you stop
[1:23:58] you amen climb over it and keep moving
[1:24:01] on god will inject himself
[1:24:02] supernaturally to stop anything from
[1:24:04] hindering the word
[1:24:06] just keep moving forward friends
[1:24:09] the promises of abraham are upon you
[1:24:13] because we're abraham's faith seed the
[1:24:15] promises the blessings of abraham are
[1:24:18] all here amen that line of life is still
[1:24:20] moving here god is still doing something
[1:24:22] there's still something to be expressed
[1:24:24] and nothing is going to stop that
[1:24:26] expression amen so now we need to start
[1:24:28] praying with faith saying god i believe
[1:24:31] your word that by your stripes i'm
[1:24:33] healed and this thing is hindering me
[1:24:35] and being what you called me to be
[1:24:38] i say pray with faith pray with
[1:24:42] understanding pray knowing amen that
[1:24:45] that we are what god has called us to be
[1:24:48] we're here for a purpose amen and
[1:24:50] nothing can enter that anything that's
[1:24:51] hindering it he's got to take care of it
[1:24:56] don't be afraid
[1:24:58] don't be fearful
[1:25:01] don't let your mind wander when troubles
[1:25:03] come just read the bible
[1:25:06] troubles always come
[1:25:08] look at joseph he had lots of troubles
[1:25:12] hated of his brothers thrown into a pit
[1:25:14] sold into slavery goes into potiphar's
[1:25:16] house lied about cast back in the prison
[1:25:19] forgotten there
[1:25:22] for years
[1:25:23] is that right
[1:25:25] but was any of that not according to the
[1:25:27] program of god
[1:25:29] and could any of that stop the vision
[1:25:32] that god had showed him in the dream
[1:25:34] from coming to pass where he would be
[1:25:36] lifted up on high and the sun and moon
[1:25:38] would bow to him and the eleven sheeps
[1:25:40] would bow to him nothing could stop that
[1:25:42] because that was already written in the
[1:25:43] stars
[1:25:45] so when he goes down he's still not
[1:25:47] defeated when he comes up he's not
[1:25:49] defeated he goes back down he's still
[1:25:51] not defeated because there's already
[1:25:54] been a dream given of the mind of god
[1:25:57] and nothing can stop it from coming to
[1:25:59] pass
[1:26:01] when he's in the prison he's still
[1:26:04] the word to be expressed
[1:26:06] he still has got to be exalted
[1:26:09] at some point
[1:26:12] god has got a plan for you and i
[1:26:14] there is a plan for this bride in the
[1:26:16] end time and nothing is going to stop it
[1:26:20] nothing will stop the manifestation of
[1:26:22] jesus christ and bride forming this day
[1:26:24] if there's anything in our lives that
[1:26:26] are holding us back or hindering it i
[1:26:28] would curse that thing in the name of
[1:26:29] jesus christ and commit it to god
[1:26:32] and i would tell god this thing is a
[1:26:34] this thing is shackles on my ankles lord
[1:26:38] holding me back from what i believe you
[1:26:40] called me to be and what you've called
[1:26:42] me to express and i'm asking in the name
[1:26:44] of jesus christ by the blood that was
[1:26:46] shed at calvary that purchased for me
[1:26:48] healing and redemption and deliverance i
[1:26:50] pray that you would remove it for me so
[1:26:51] that i can run free to manifest this
[1:26:53] word
[1:26:55] see too many times we're praying our own
[1:26:57] will our own desire i don't want to feel
[1:26:59] sick anymore i don't want to feel bad
[1:27:00] anymore i want to have more blessings i
[1:27:02] want to have more money i want to do
[1:27:04] this amen but that's not the right image
[1:27:07] the right image is god i'm here for a
[1:27:09] purpose i'm here to manifest your life
[1:27:11] and this thing is hindering me would you
[1:27:13] remove it so i can run the race amen
[1:27:17] amen brother said if you say you want to
[1:27:19] be healed what do you want to be healed
[1:27:21] for
[1:27:22] what are you going to do once you're
[1:27:23] healed are you going to waste it on on
[1:27:25] selfish living or you want to be healed
[1:27:27] for the kingdom work amen
[1:27:29] once we dial in our understanding to
[1:27:31] realize i am here for a purpose
[1:27:34] god foresaw me here before the
[1:27:36] foundation of the world there's a
[1:27:37] portion of the manifestation of christ
[1:27:39] for me to portion out and live in this
[1:27:41] day amen if there's anything that's
[1:27:43] stopping that i am going to condemn it
[1:27:46] i'm going to curse it i'm going to stand
[1:27:47] against it in the name of jesus christ
[1:27:49] because it's stopping me
[1:27:51] from staying in my posted duty
[1:27:55] god's called you to be a mother
[1:27:58] and there's something hindering you i
[1:28:00] say cast it down in the name of jesus
[1:28:01] christ
[1:28:02] say god you called me to nurture these
[1:28:05] children and raise them and this thing
[1:28:06] is afflicting me attacking me i curse it
[1:28:08] lord so that i continue to do what you
[1:28:10] called me to do
[1:28:11] if you're a daddy who god has called to
[1:28:13] provide for a child amen and sickness is
[1:28:15] striking you i would curse that thing in
[1:28:17] the name of jesus christ and say god
[1:28:19] you've called me to be a father of these
[1:28:20] children you've placed them under my
[1:28:21] care and i need healing i need help to
[1:28:24] go and work
[1:28:26] i need a job i i need this situation
[1:28:28] amen what are we doing amen we're here
[1:28:31] amen to be an expression of that book of
[1:28:33] life
[1:28:35] and nothing can stop that expression
[1:28:39] nothing can hinder that until our time
[1:28:42] is done
[1:28:44] and when our time is done
[1:28:47] who wants to stay anyhow
[1:28:52] if god has done
[1:28:53] and you're you've done all that he
[1:28:55] foresaw in his mind for you to do and
[1:28:57] all that was written in your star and
[1:28:59] the position it was in and it's done all
[1:29:01] that it was to do who wants to stay
[1:29:03] anyhow
[1:29:06] i just want to do what he's called me to
[1:29:07] do in this age
[1:29:09] and i want to understand
[1:29:11] that just as god was watching over
[1:29:13] abraham watching over you
[1:29:16] just as much as he saw when abraham went
[1:29:18] down to pharaoh's house and something
[1:29:19] was going to stop that word
[1:29:21] just as much as he watched pharaoh he's
[1:29:23] watching you i'm watching abraham he
[1:29:25] watching you
[1:29:26] just as much as he protected that woman
[1:29:28] sarah he's protecting you
[1:29:30] just as much as he watched abraham amen
[1:29:33] when abraham went down to gerrard he had
[1:29:35] his eyes on that situation i mean he let
[1:29:37] it go so far and when it got to the
[1:29:39] point where it was about to go wrong he
[1:29:41] injected himself and he took care of it
[1:29:43] he'll do the same thing for you
[1:29:45] how many of you can say you've seen god
[1:29:47] do that in your life supernaturally
[1:29:49] inject himself
[1:29:50] to turn you into a direction to stop
[1:29:52] something to bring deliverance to bring
[1:29:53] a healing why did he do it because you
[1:29:55] had pretty blue eyes and because you had
[1:29:57] the nicest smile he did it because of
[1:29:59] he's watching over his word
[1:30:03] he's keeping us
[1:30:05] because of his word he's watching over
[1:30:07] his word
[1:30:09] that's why i say it's good to be his
[1:30:11] word
[1:30:12] it's good to be part
[1:30:14] of that lamb's book of life
[1:30:17] god bless you let's all stand
[1:30:21] so many more things that's on my heart
[1:30:22] to share but we'll just pray that god
[1:30:24] will help us
[1:30:25] come sunday with that
[1:30:28] oh the more that i read the more i read
[1:30:30] the bible the more it comes alive amen

[1:30:53] so settled
[1:30:54] that god is watching over us

[1:31:20] ever let these things be preached lord

[1:31:56] over that and nothing will stop it
