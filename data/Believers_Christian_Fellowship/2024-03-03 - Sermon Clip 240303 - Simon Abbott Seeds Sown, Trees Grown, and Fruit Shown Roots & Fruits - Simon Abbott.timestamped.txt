[0:00] so now here we have this is the bride
[0:03] and she's kind of walking up these
[0:06] steps the Revelation is growing so as
[0:10] we're as we're going through these
[0:11] Church ages this this this Revelation is
[0:15] growing
[0:17] reation is growing it's growing we can't
[0:20] help it we we can't help it what is it's
[0:22] the tree that tree that's growing in us
[0:24] the seed is becoming more and more
[0:26] mature and now we get to a point here
[0:29] and here we have have
[0:33] 1963 we have
[0:35] 1963 and now here we have this is the
[0:40] rapture
[0:42] Rapture this
[0:44] one so now we know what the point of the
[0:47] Rapture this Revelation level has to be
[0:50] here it has to be here
[0:55] okay but we are right now and I'm just
[0:58] you know we're looking for the Lord's
[0:59] coming every day we know that but we're
[1:01] saying that we're here right now this is
[1:04] us us it's not the US I'm sorry it's
[1:08] just
[1:09] us this is now so we see this kind of
[1:13] time period look here here it's been
[1:16] this time
[1:17] period you
[1:21] know seals were broken back then nobody
[1:24] really knew what it was on about true
[1:27] it's true let's be honest see he opens
[1:31] the eyes of
[1:33] understanding at a specific point in
[1:37] time when the Lord was walking with him
[1:39] he was preaching the words and the whole
[1:41] time he was the word and yet they didn't
[1:45] have a clue what he was talking about
[1:46] although something on the inside was
[1:49] burning but they didn't even know what
[1:51] it was but it was just it was just like
[1:52] that deep calling to deep I don't
[1:54] understand it but I just believe it Lord
[1:55] but there's a specific time when his
[1:57] when they open their eyes amen it's
[2:01] beautiful and you know Revelation is
[2:04] given it can only be given we know the
[2:06] scripture Simon blessed out th Simon by
[2:08] Jonah not the to but the Father which is
[2:10] heaven Revelation is only given it can't
[2:14] be
[2:15] learned see and the rure the revelation
[2:19] of actually who we are and what it's all
[2:22] about has come kind of
[2:24] nowish am you know it's only now that
[2:27] we're truly seeing who we are mate I'm
[2:29] telling you the first time that I
[2:31] because I mean when we when the Lord
[2:32] brought us out from where we came from
[2:34] and and the Lord began the ministry it
[2:35] was on the back of who we are because I
[2:38] could kind of see who we are I was kind
[2:40] of getting wo hang about how can we be
[2:43] the bride of Christ if we're him the
[2:45] word says that the two shall no longer
[2:47] be Twain but one therefore that makes us
[2:50] kind to him that's what brother was
[2:51] saying back there but no one ever dared
[2:53] to say it because you being a man make S
[2:55] God they crucified the Lord Jesus for
[2:57] saying that they would have crucified
[2:58] the bride for doing that well and and if
[3:00] the Lord does not come there'll be no
[3:02] flesh saved why because the false Vine
[3:03] will crucify the bride for saying that
[3:05] you are God that's who we are that's
[3:08] where we are and the Revelation only
[3:09] just come now it's only just come now
[3:13] why mate these is the last days of the
[3:15] last days we are in the last day I tell
[3:18] you we are so
[3:19] close
