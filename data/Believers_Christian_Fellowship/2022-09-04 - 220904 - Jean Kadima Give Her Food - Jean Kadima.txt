I'm gonna take again my Liberty as I always do but I am I feel good about that Liberty uh partially because the pastor already touched that subject when I was preaching it in Pittsburgh it was actually preaching it here a little bit touching it here so praise God for that okay Mark 5 22. and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death I prayed thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live let's jump to uh verse 35 from there and 35 while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house Satan which said thy daughter is dead thy troubleless thou the master any further as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he said and the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid trade only believe and he suffered no man to follow him save Peter and James and John the brother of jams we know it takes the three witness hope law hope faith and love and verse 38 and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth the multitude and then that wept and wailed greatly and when he was coming he says unto them why make he this adult and Weep the damsel is not dead but slippeth and they loved him to scorn but when he had put them out all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damself and them that were with him and entered in where the demsa was lying verse 41 and he took the demsa by the hand and said unto her which is being interpret themsel I say unto thee Rye arise and straight away the damself arose and walk and she was of age of 12 12 years and they were astonished with a great astonishment and he charged them straightly that no man should know it and commanded that something should be given her to eat amen and that's our Focus this morning God bless you you may take your seat so as you can see I have highlighted the last sentence there where Jesus commanded them to give her something to eat and I take took my subject there and I say my job my subject is give her food that's it give her food that's the the subject and um this I cannot remember how this comes to came to me a preacher will tell you very strange things happened so I just came and I thought about uh you know Lima Ohio and then I went to Pittsburgh and preached a little bit uh one angle of it but you see God can hit you with something when you read the Bible read the word but not reading it like you're reading a newspaper so when you read it with meditation you want God to speak to you something can just hit you and God starts building it I at the end it was something else uh for me so and I see that that's how the prophet used to read the Bible that's the way he did and I was looking at a a scripture in Luke 7 7 36 we have brother Branham is talking about this invitation he had to go to Simon uh Simon the Pharisee and where he said verse 36 and one of the Pharisees desire him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought in Alabaster Box of ointment and stood At His Feet be behind him whipping and begin to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kisses feet and anoint them with ointment well brother Brahm takes that scripture and find us something that is not actually there and you find a paid Courier in that scripture he say to go to invite Jesus so Simon the Pharisee would have sent a courier a paid Courier to go and give the message to uh to Jesus and he zero in a focus on that person who will bring to Jesus the the invitation where do you find the paid carrier here the prophet could see it because the way you read the Bible is between the lines and God just inspired him who brought the invitation to you to Jesus and he starts dramatizing he say he came and arrived and went to Jesus and give a node to Jesus and politely Jesus also gave the note back he said my master Simon the Pharisee has sent me to give you this invitation so you can come to his house and have a dinner is a very important man it would be great if you show up thank you and Jesus said sure he always when he's invited he will come so and the brother Brandon focused on his message for a while on this person but the Bible is not talking about him he says is is like on that that time in that time if you want to go and invite someone you send a paid Courier you know FedEx you know UPS and it's you know uh Amazon the children are saying you forget Uber Eats and whatever so you said you send the carrier and whatever I'm focused on this person who went and gave the message then the prophet says the message the meanest man in Santa Maria he say this now and then after that The Courier must have turned his back and walked away and breathe breathe a breath of satisfaction he had done something great and brother man I'm focused on it how can a person go to the word Med flesh and turn his back that's what is what is there is what you do in the flesh at that time it has an implication on the spiritual it goes back the same way it came in but a person cannot come to the world and remain the same even the death when they met the death met Jesus he was he did not remain the same but this man give his message to his uh the message of his boss and turn his back and goes back to his denomination goes back to the system of man-made system after come in contact of them with the message of the hour Ned flesh and brother Branham will focus on this and dramatizing oh and he say this and sometimes people come sick and get healed and then walk away thinking that they have achieved exactly the main thing that they came for the best thing is to come for uh for is to find him as a savior is to know him know him is life right he is in your life have the Assurance but today that's not what people do so I'm just skipping and but I'm saying this now we find that this Courier turn is back upon the Lord Jesus as far as the scripture does not give that he ever ask a pardoning of his sins or anything that he walked away back down to his master the Pharisee now they they there's something wrong with this story here it's absolutely something wrong it doesn't make ends meet there's something wrong indeed how can you turn your back on the word of God of your time well so he could read between lines so that's how we need to read the word that's how we read the Bible he went back to his system he didn't feel any change he didn't feel like something was there I thank God you and I have recognized the word and we stay with the word so you see there are things like this the uh all over the Bible that we should never read it the way we used to read it absolutely not so so let's go back to our story here and he he took the damselves by the hand mark five say unto her talitakumi maybe the way that's the way they say it which is being interpreted themselves I say unto thee arise and straight away the dams arose and walked and she was of the age of 12 years and they were astonished with great astonishment in shut them straight that no man should know it and commanded that something should be given to her to eat and I say give her food amen so that it's not isn't strange that she was dead and she came in contact with Jesus and then she arose and become alive again but yet Jesus said this is good but give her food all right so where where you are present she doesn't need the food to live why do you ask us to give her food no no no it's Jesus the God made the nature and nature obeyed to God she was maybe she spent days without eating drinking and if she does not eat she's going to return back where she came from That's the Law of God nature obey to God so that way say give her food otherwise she's going to go back where she comes from where does he she come from she comes from men made systems the graveyard of denomination spirit that's where she comes from so if you don't give her food she's going to return where she came from give her food don't give her psychology don't give her wisdom give her food and what food the word of her time amen [Music] amen spiritual food in a due season it's not their food it's not the church so-called food it's the bride food it's spiritual food in season it would make them sick at their stomach is too rich to for them see you can't do it for the children it's bread it's alive it's Christ the same yesterday today and forever okay give her who the damself who is the demsa the bride why is this show she's is she is she so young because it's a virgin see me of the church and if you don't give it to her she's going to go back return to where she came from but don't give her your own ideas hey man don't give her the philosophy of this world a psychology of this world is nothing wrong with it but not on the pulpit it's nothing to go in the cabinet somewhere with the doctor but she the bride should not be given psychology he won't help her don't give her another time of food give her the food of today any other food will not help her anything else will not help our young people it will not help our older people entertainment is good but you won't help them what they need is to to go to come up higher there God has put all the ingredients that the church need what you need you individual all the ingredients all the things that you need is in that food therefore you cannot provide them with any other food but that food but let me tell you she has to eat too it's not just provide for her Jesus said give her food but it implies that she is she has to eat amen she has to chew on it amen she has to meditate on it otherwise he's gonna die but the Lord said give her food but it means she has to consume that food chew on it meditate on it amen apply it that the solution solution to all our problems to a solution to all the issues and find in the word of God give her food not man wisdom that's why brother Branham say to uh to the preachers however they say oh Pastor that's your job they eat food not a mad and monarchs ship food God's words but she needs to eat you know if she doesn't eat what's going to happen brother Branham went into a restaurant you know what happened he saw a woman with a blue hair whatever mascara how they call it manicure whatever she had but when I was discussed but the prophets say that God spoke to him and told him don't condemn her in a demonology he say religion dream he say you know what that woman slipped out of that seat there in that restaurant we had a prayer meeting like you never heard in your life and she came to Christ what was it don't condemn them tell them the gospel this is what I have found in being working as a missioner you know you find that people can even you know oppose you say things have a resentment it's just because the they don't know you just assured them love and give them the word then you see they turn around what happened we we love for the Kadima what happened why do you love him suddenly don't condemn them then give them the word amen amen that is so good everybody they're hungry they're hungry they don't know so give them food and then when you become friends amen praise God hey man ah My my what where can I read ah where can I read let's just read what it what is there okay the restoration of the bride all the bugs that hell can turn loose on her will never stop her no communism uh Catholicism and nothing else will stop it I will restore saith the Lord all the men made Roman trees will never hang it there all the graves will not keep it there all the big denomination of stones laying at the door will never keep it in there so what happened she was in the graveyard spiritually speaking but when the word came nothing could keep her in that place in those stones but when she comes out of him she needs to continue with food to sustain her life but not any food he must be God's food it must be ship food Eagle food not any other word will do will answer to this condition that we're living in young people all people that will not work it must be the word of this day well let me let me work you up it must be the Eighth Day message if it's just right there it won't do anything you have to operate go a little bit upper higher that will keep the young people [Music] amen everybody is with me amen that's exactly right God has a provided way it has thrown golden nuggets in this message you throw here through there he knows you need it so it happened like you stumble on it no you didn't you throw it he knew you're gonna come over there anyway but any other thing will not work I I hope you understand I I guess you understand yeah it's a message no but the message has to come higher big to meet the challenge the challenge is so strong the demons that come with all the anger they need the word that of that level and every time people rejected The Eighth Day message sorry to say that when they do they die because that's what happened that's what Jesus said Jesus say give her food if you don't give her food they die God help us we need to say these things who knows who will hear it has to be the word of this day because you see as the preacher sometimes you wonder you know before you know you wonder why why is it that brother Branham redrew the church ages or the angel of the Lord just redo it and then he redo and he made loud this year completely black all right that but I am still here so you see all these things you're thinking I'm here it's total chaos what that means but the reality is you're not in love this year you go a little higher in eight days where everything is bright and there you see everything so how can you feed people with the loud decision message it won't work hey man oh God help us whatever talks about what happened another mystery you see when it goes to India it goes to when he went to Africa India he had a thousands of thousands people they were uh they gave the heart to the Lord and when he came here he said to people when they received the Holy Ghost they just act like you and I right and then strengthing happened denomination did not want to help to be associated with him therefore this all these people had came to listen to brother Branham gave their heart to the Lord what did they do after brother pranam left back in the denomination back in the temple isn't taking side with Jesus I cannot read it but I can just read here there was no church nothing I could do there was nobody to give to them the measure I believe there was not even Pentecostal denomination will cooperate with me and all these those Souls probably drifted right back in the thick with genes and Buddhism and whatever more they come they come from no place to put them what is shame that is disgrace because I had no cooperation because of the stand that I take it said just beyond me I don't have an answer about it they seem to have received the Holy Ghost but denomination you know uh did not want to cooperate what's going to happen they're going to go back they have to worship is that right God always sort them out you know God will sort it at the end but look what is the most important receiving the holy ghost or the word Jesus did not have the Holy Ghost when he was going to the Cross but he sustained him he was the word the word sustained him I don't know how to explain this this people went back to they have to go somewhere therefore if any person reject the word they're going back God help us yeah are you with me give them food and let them eat food it will change them it will mold them it will transform them he will make them new creatures it's the word of this time this level amen it's over issues is solve our issue the question that we have in our mind God has already thrown answers in the message everywhere this answer the problem that really uh hurt us the most in this age is emotional questions give her food in the food there is answer to emotional questions we had emotional questions in our time but we were a little bit distracted because we were in survival mode we need to put food on the table that's a great achievement the rent job that was so emotional questions were like in a back seat today in a developed country uh tell each other that you provide for him meal or his mail they don't know what you're talking about yeah dad go to work to get your food yeah but we were a little bit distracted so that we will not focus on emotional Grace today you have to address them with the word the solution is in the word just keep eating eat the food of your time there is an answer there and many people have even asked questions for our time brother Branham let's take a question question and answer four brother Branham when some somebody gets on steps on my toes this might be a good one steps on my toes as the old saying is my temper eyes how can I overcome these things I know the the Lord will have to do it but what can I do in my heart I don't want this thing what about an answer sweeten your temple with prayer then make up your mind that's answer that's the solution is that all yeah that's all what do you want something more straighten your spirit quieten that the human spirit with prayer before you can speak and act that's all and the word of God when it comes to us we need to say Amen to it not just say can I measure up to this word that was said no don't do that just say Amen to it and God give me the grace to apply it because that's the solution there is no other solution but if I'm saying I don't guess there's too many people in this building ever had any more temper than I did to begin with I had a mouth mashed all the time and I've taken a lot of my meals out of a straw oh my it kept going it kept going and he tell you one day a woman insulted his mother as he was doing just his job as a utility in a utility company turning off the uh the mirror whatever they call them and that woman laughed at him he said it did not feel anything he said the form the former me would have bitten that woman even though I don't believe in violence in a woman I would have done it but when I look back I didn't even feel anything and the things of God that's how they happen you look back and say oh when where this Temple went amen I used to where is it gone God took it because you took the word you ate the food that was provide for you you took it and God gave you the solution and today God help us you see God it really doesn't want his children to go the way of Cain that's the problem Cain was told this is the solution this is the atonement is the blood I said oh no and well uh that's it what else can God give you this is the provided way and that's why the word is screaming to is the god children stay with the world what else can you get if it's not the word it's something very simple but that's what it has to be it has to be simple amen sometimes we don't tell people that a Christian sometimes need to cope with tough situation when we say overcome overcome that thing it does not always mean it's going to go away sometimes it's just you have to cope with it you have to keep it under the blood it overcome means that okay ignore it take a different position and we need to say the things because the word has them here for a purpose Christ is the reveal is revealed in his own word I was talking to a young Minister and his wife in the room just a few minutes ago and both of them are never nervous just like the rest of the world the rest of the human beings on Earth I said remember Satan got a Punch coming at you I don't care who you are he got a right a right to want that one punch so if it's to be nervous that the punch he has God gave it to him so what you need to do overcome what is or overcome sometimes is to cope put it under the blood because God may decide not to take it away oh that's hard to say but that's true but Abraham suffer all ears every seven years with a stomach pain tension and all that thing God God why do you do this to me why don't you take it away he never took it away do you know when he took it away one month before his death he said he won't bother you anymore that was kind of God has a sense of humor you know yeah one month later he was gone because God knew being under tension will help his ministry painful but yes but he will help his ministry there are things that God want us to overcome when we say overcome sometimes I'm just using I'm poor in language I would call it to cope with it that's it whether when I'm saying that the devil has a right to give you one punch a good one you know young people you understand what I'm talking about a good punch he has the right you know so you say which had your uh which had you rather be that punch be blind that's a punch be an arthritic um sitting in a chair or be nervous I would take be nervous that's what it is see it's got somewhere he can punch you he got you right to that one place now that the spot you got to keep covered all the time you see it's a nervous age we're living in yes but the prophet tells us it has to be ah it has to be in God's terms provided God's provided way for this day so God has made a way for us God loves his children he loves his people you want to help them you want to help you more than you you want help if you can't just get that in your heart God's more willing to help you than you are to help yourself young people grown up everyone all the people God wants to help us but he has a way and that's the only way that will work is true this way you must come to his term not your terms his terms you wanted a certain way my problem I want the solution this way but that's what Cain say I want food take it or living is that right my way no it's God terms and sometimes they're very simple the only thing you say is amen Lord Now give me the grace to apply it but he he gives it to you this way and like Naman dipped in the dipping in the waters of Jordan why he said the water's up in this country was much cleaner and better but that was not what the prophet say deep here he dipped once leprosy still there six times it was still there he had to obey and come God's way and when he fully obeyed God's way the leprosy left [Music] that provide way not always a good we will not always what we expected it's away and all these Solutions are in the word but I want to tell you that God knowing when you and I will be living what time what the issues will be the upper rise the standard don't tell me standard is the code of conduct the standard is the greater revelation where all the candlesticks are lightening up everything becomes clear amen give them food give her food who the bride message the Rapture three things happen a voice a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears now Jesus does all this of all three of them I don't want to be in trouble Jesus that's all you see yeah we should not be afraid of the word Jesus does all these three three of them as is descending in descending of three of them but we are just afraid well well let's just stay with the shout okay okay let's just stay with a shout a shout what is a shout it's the message going forth first the bra living bread of life bringing forth the bride that's what have the solution the ingredients everything that we need to sustain our life to serve him to serve him until the body change that's what we need the bread of life a solution to all problems amen so Jairus daughter was uh she was dead therefore she needs what a Revival she's dead really dead in denominations in the system of men not what you need a Revival what will rise hurt from death are you with me yes okay the bride has not had a Revival yet dead right there's no big they're not being a Revival there no manifestation of God to steal the bride yet we are looking for it now it will take those seven Thunders standards back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised now watch what make this Jairus girl waking up is to come in contact with Jesus but Jesus Will was speaking you know the normal language he's staying people get up only the mother and and the father come with me Peter John James come here and he start talking and he goes all this is speaking let's say speaking in English right okay you go go go here and then suddenly he turned and said uh Jean fee left twice Italy oh oh no brother John what did you say there that's the point Jesus spoke in other tongues that the need and interpretation the Bible say what Jesus said needed an interpretation and that what woke up the woman the word that is saying need a prophet to give the interpretation no wonder I spoken French if you're wondering what did he say wake her up he has to speak in a message a message that John was told to seal up until the the messenger of the last age to appear only that will wake her up nothing else now listen this is not me saying continues no she was dead what need to work her up is those Thunders John has to seal them amen and now if the church would forget their Creed and forget their dog and just take the Bible please the promise then it will be become effective to them but your tradition and you keep going amen what worked her up the bride the very thing that work era keep her alive is that right it's not sufficient to to wake up but you have to keep to be alive something that sustained your your life is the same word that wake you up amen yes sir amen brother Branham is talking I will change gears a little bit here now wow I could talk about I'm just told I just told you about the uh they're speaking in time that the word that worked her up and that's what the prophet say the seventh seal when he say that I have received it in three three fourth manner and he will say that it's the is it thunders behind the Revelation Dan it will say the secret coming that the thing that Angels did not know then he will say is the third pole is that right and then he will say in sambino Canyon he told me in sambino Canyon he said this is the third pole and and and one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there is the one thing that cannot interpret I cannot interpret because it's in unknown language is in unknown language you need a prophet to give the interpretation is the message of the hour amen it is those standards it's the third pool is all that it's a bundle of thanks but she need to eat to sister in your life I want to just change gears a little bit here ah looking at the Jairus story I remember brother Branham his his mother was very sick and brother Branham is praying to God to tell him what is going on and God is not answer him and brother Brown says you know when is for somebody else it will talk to me but when is my own issue our sweat he won't answer me and he said the gift is not my gift it is God a gift it will even tell us that I just want to have one gift one a gift and that gift is to relax myself and let God use me not standing on God's way that the only gift I have it's good that the prophets say this we know there are nine gifts of the Spirit and five-fold Ministry but the Lord doesn't want us to remain in that level thinking about the gift that way because a gift if it belongs to you you can use it the way you want if it's something that was given to you for you to use you can use it any way you want you want to go to near Alaska you go to Alaska you want to go and uh grow up your bird you go you know grow up your bear and fish hunt and all the things but it's not the gift is God are you with me God uses it where you want to use this when he wants to use it you cannot say my gift will operate in Cleveland God said Pittsburgh you're Cleveland is not your gift but brother Branham is giving us the way of understanding gifts you say we have only one gift we can ask for basically this is me is to relax and to let God is it that the gift I have the rest that's God I just relax myself that the gift I have and I will ask all the church everybody let's relax ask God for the gift of relaxing and let him because what it will do we don't know he may not fit the backs of nine gifts what God will do may not fit there or gift of speaking in time prophecy uh healing he may not even fit that whatever you want is God when was creating those animals how can you take it and fit it in the Box how can you do it it was not or you will say gift of Miracles no it was a returning back to the Garden of Eden Adam being restored it doesn't fit in the nine gift of the spirit so whatever God wants to do if I just relax so gift we should not ask for gift if there is a gift we can ask is ourselves to just relax and stop all the our let me just call it nonsense stop all these things and relax say stop our ambitions what do we want to do and sometimes you say our stuff so we can get everybody can grab something yeah I know my stuff and just relax and let him and that's the biggest problem is him to find somebody somebody who can completely relax to God of Will and do what he asked him to do then God will do the rest and the rest that he will do cannot We cannot put in in the boxes of gifts anything you want it will do amen oh my that time is running okay what Abraham says when his mother was uh sick is asking God what happened to my mother what can I do the gift is not for him the gift is for other people if you come to him you have a dream it will tell you oh you forget this portion of your dream it means this it means that okay and he will tell you though don't say it this is what happened this is whatever you forget this you forget that I come to his own mother sick no God does not answer him he cried to him at some point he said Lord help me here this is my mother he say he goes into uh coming home in the testimony of a true witness you say coming home I thought I went and stood in the room I pick up a Bible a new Bible I say Lord you uh you are God you don't have to tell me what you do and I just wonder if you kept the reason you did that taking her she was already dead taking her was it was it because to keep from breaking my heart if so who do you comfort me with your word now when he has a problem one day he had a recurring dreams of it he sees himself going back to the uh utility company and constantly and sometimes the bills will just disappear and he was what's going on Lord did I do something wrong tell me tell me but God is next answer him then he said I will just take my Bible this is a man who sees the Visions all the time but it's not for him he said okay well I will take my Bible okay oh in this Bible there must be a character that has just my situation let me open it and he opened he was on Eliza looking for Rebecca praise God you will wonder if he was his gift he will use it when he wants if you have money you won't go to McDonald's and get something you know but he was not ears yeah um you say and I did it you know how you take a Bible and just put it open like that you want to understand why his mother died I just took my fingers and ran down turn it open Matthew 9 Great Big Red Letters sticking out and she is not she's not dead but slippeth and first thing my eyes fell on the scripture when I looked down that of course not I don't want to use the Bible for a Ouija board you know we just don't do that but I was so tore up at that time I believe in that God let me see that because what followed proved it right that night of course I was Restless a rest it was a Restless uh was a restless night so but when I'm saying what I was doing with the Bible was not I was not playing like luck with the Bible I was desperate I was torn why did you take my mud without even tell me what is going on when he did it God tells him that his mother a character is in the Bible it is in a Jairus daughter that's your mother that's you her the bride she is a part of the Bride she's not dead she's sleeping let's encourage him he say this ah he said and the more the next morning got up I guess it was about eight o'clock in the room eight or maybe maybe later I begin to see children coming in they bringing in crippled children from everywhere look like it made about a city block wide and about two city blocks and just Afflicted children on the left side on the right side where people seated and and all along looked like it was up high so what happened is seeing a vision of a stadium and a children's Afflicted people are coming and and it's kind of a stadium run down then come up again in the back end to keep the very back people from not seeing they they could look forward uh forward at age while I was standing with a blue suit I thought now this is strange I'm standing in the room at home here but here I am in a blue suit and uh I was leading songs I was reading the singing bring them in bring them in making both sides thing bring the little ones to Jesus bring them in from the world of sin and he say and there was a renowned lady entered the back of the stadium somewhere another I knew that it was she was coming in but she started coming up through the audience and I was just keep leading the songs bring them in and I I said this side sing bring them in this side bring them in like that bring the Wonder ring once to Jesus I was going to pray for all this Lolo Afflicted children and sick and this lady came and went to the Box unlike in the theater where is like where the celebrities sit or a president box oh you know what I mean in that kind of place to to my left and the lady was just just got it and she turned around to the other people that was there I just bow her head I noticed she was dressed kind of old-fashioned and the lady turned around to bow to me just before and I I walked in the puppet then to preach and just as she held her head down I turned around and let DC to this to her and when I raised my head she raised up facing me to Mama elabrana and she looked at me and smiled she was young real young and the great thundering voice shook the place the words came and said do not worry about her she's like she was in 1906. amen and when the vision left me I looked to see thou what 1906 was that was the ear she was a bride to my father Jairus daughter the bride it was a type of the mother she's part of the Bride the bride of Christ what this tells you God when he was re writing the word he had you in the mind not only is he say to brother Branham you want comfort you want Comfort open the Bible he opens the Bible is it the generous daughter she's not dead she is sleeping then he had a vision in the vision he sees his mother and he say she is like she was in 1906. 1906 this is when she became the bride well 1909 Ella Branham was just a child she was 15 years old when she got uh William Brennan is that right 1906. how old was she you have to take -3 if she was 15 then -3 she was 12. 12 years old how old was the Chinese daughter 12 years old when was she married at 12 brother when I'm continued saying my mother was a child herself giving birth I know I know you are quiet yeah yeah I know it was terrible yeah I know I know our mothers have my mother was married 15 years old at that time that's the knowledge people had can I say it my mother-in-law sister Julian was married at 14. people understand things later right but yeah she was 12 for bride now when you go back and look at Jairus story you will find her maybe the the those who wrote the Gospel like a look Mark and Matthew the way they refer to Jairus daughter is kind of different they they say child they they say Lulu a girl or they said maiden maiden is actually a woman of marriage Aid but all this they will inspire maybe for us this morning to see how God Comfort is Prophet with a character in the Bible that was exactly the mother 12 years old bride and Jerry's 12 years and is at 906 strange that is the beginning of the the last Church age her life was written in the Bible your life is written in the Bible amen you are part of the word therefore you can't deny the word Therefore your life is spelled it spells something it spells out something sometimes you don't understand but you are writing something like Jesus writing on on the floor on the ground you are drawing a pattern your life as you living and obeying to God serving him you are actually writing something it's a pattern you don't know what you are talking about what what is happening sometimes you feel miserable but God looks at Ella Branham what she had to fulfill in her life even the day she she's dying she's telling brother Brennan uh Billy I see you yes Mom I'm here I see you you are old Billy you are very old what did you see she sees Elijah the prophet and our own son is Elijah the prophet is old he has long hair he has long beard he's holding her transferring her from this world to the other world oh what a life but she went through a lot of things married at 12 a baby at 15 husband alcoholic to add 10 children but her life was so important to the eyes of your father and my father 42 years she became a wider 42 living as a widow for 25 years but God sees our character in the Bible she was playing that part but she did not know do you know what part you're playing you are playing a great important part [Music] Christian we have to be encouraged we have to be angry we don't want to be arrogant but in the same time we cannot be walking like like you know we are miserable because our life is riding down something a pattern that we go we don't know why we're going this way we are writing down something amen sometimes it's hard if you look at this woman you will see that oh she went through a lot and she went to God doesn't care like what happens because this has to write something it's a prophecy that is being fulfilled just like Brother Carlos preaching we my son and I was we're like whoa we look at each other on Wednesday we had a good time good time oh my it's good when the Holy Ghost entertain us young people entertain you not Hollywood you can be screaming yourself in a room in the wood like crazy because the Holy Ghost is entertaining here hallelujah it's so good it's such a great time when he entertains you amen you cannot give that life for anything in the world amen amen and The Vision World you see at the end of her life sees her as a celebrity she she sit in that you know Cornwell big great people president where they they stand yet you say oh my life is miserable oh me what this woman did not see Ella Branham what did not say she's so so much but she had a great price in God's eyes amen look uh Luke mark and Matthew they all talk about this girl and whatever says that she was a um the she was as the to be very young to be very young is a sign of urgency like brother Brennan one day I think he was going to Jamaica Kingston he had a dream in that dream he saw himself ah he saw himself sitting with a 17 years old girl him a 50 years old man sitting there like like the doing courtship looking at each other in eyes looking down he said when he woke up he said I screamed I say I'm going to Backside what am I doing with this girl 17 years old then he started even describing the girl even in some places they say she was not attractive you know her sister so and so the daughter of so and so remember that he will say he will describe even her lips how strange the only bread of Brenham can say that if he was here you will not see that sister the next service she's gone and he will say you know sister I think it was a brother Jack Moore daughter she could be in the service you know her she's not very attractive but and she was sitting with me but once you know the symbology of this is like she is not attractive button can say it I cannot say it any no nobody else can say it God has given to brother Brahm that ability that's why he took care of him when he was only seven years old he said don't drink don't smoke it was not he was trying to protect his liver or his lungs don't go after women at 70 years old everybody will be up and down and say how dare you tell a seven years old it is but God does whatever God wants to do he was not trying it was not protecting the the body of this boy he was protecting his mind yes our mind uh our mind is corrupted but God wants to limit the corruption on the mind of this boy because of the ministry that he will have therefore he can say just no shalanta that uh she's a beautiful woman there is an attractive woman here and he will just go with pure in his mind it has nothing to do with he's just saying fact this is yeah if his mind was corrupted how many visions that he had no how many think he sees he sees people in the rooms in the bedrooms in the doctor's office he sees this all kind of sickness he sees them he can tell you what you have if his mind was corrupted how could he say it and we all need a clean mind gotta help us so he could say that and he he woke up and said what is it he said the vision was that girl 17 years old was a little church the girl was a virgin just a child and that meant the Virgin sea of the church and the Three City Blocks up the hill was a three days I would Minister in Kingston okay Kingston Jamaica I don't remember the town and taking the little virgin Church by my Ministry from where she was on higher in the things of God until it shook the entire Island that's why you have to describe her once it takes her those three days she he mature she'd get the beauty of Jesus if it was me I would not I cannot say it the prophet has to say it thank God for the pure mind thank God for that that he can say things just without you know too much of Balancing Act and he took the damself by the hand and say unto her the uh which is being interpreted demsa I say unto thee your eyes and straight away the damselves and walked for she was the age of 12. and they were astonished with great astonishment and he tried them straightly that no man should know it and commend that something should be given her to eat when the Lord said that to his ministers it must be the word the word with all the ingredients the word of this time the bride age message The Eighth Day where there is no Darkness how can God leave us in our loudness here people don't you understand it's bringing the standard a little higher Eleanor High why the love of the demons have changed too yeah that's right anything else will not work our emotional issues will not find a solution without the true word of God again I will repeat God throw Golden Nugget in the message for you to go and pick it up for the preacher to pick it up when you come Sunday Wednesday they just throw it to you amen question is an answer when a person realized that has he has an inferior complex or some sort of complex how may he overcome this so should I be he was the only child who caused this in his early youth the person seems to be very educated brother Branham goes straight to the answer when you feel like you have a complex take exact exactly the opposite okay if if you are always wanting your way that one little brat you see you see how problem talk without even thinking about it little brat if I say it everybody will go to brother Chad's office no more brother Kadima okay if you are always wanting your way that one little brat that wants to always have everything your way turn right back around turn that right back around and give everything you got to the other well you feel like your type of ah complex is me me me me hey do the country oh yeah it's that simple yes that simple just to do the country this person doesn't like me uh they don't this person okay this brother doesn't like me this sister doesn't like me okay do the country go to that brother and sister say God bless you brother do the contrary do the opposite the prophet called it to do the vice versa thank God for them yes just go just go you see the problem is you are standing in God's way right your ambition your ego he said just go hi brother hi sister God bless you oh she always when when I approached she just give me a look man the prophet said to the country okay well are you able or okay I have to say it very you know because some people will not get the principle like me I am a picture person I'm visual when I say these things is to give the people that have the visual like me they are detailed oriented rather than principle oriented yeah go and set yeah hi Brenda even say I love you I love you brother I love you sister many people do it here it's wonderful yeah yeah the devil said well you say you love her but you don't no I'm confessing I am confessing I love you my brother my soul said that I love you my mind corrupted Maybe doing some tricks on me yeah if you are selfish and you want to hold everything then start giving away what you you got see whatever just go the vice versa that's the way to overcome anything is antidote my old southern mother used to say air off the back the dog back is good for the bite what is it idiom grammar teacher is that an idiom or something like that wow so you see just do the other way around and that's what it is not easy of course it's not easy but the first thing you say to the word of God is amen once you say Amen to it you say God do you know me I am this flesh you know what it is this mind of me you know what it is but I will apply what you say because that the solution so God has given us a word and he has commanded the ministers to preach that word to bring that food even have raised the standard Isaiah 59 19 so they shall so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West in his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him that standard is not a code of conduct it's not like by six o'clock you'll be in a bed it is the word God derived raised the word pray for anybody who want to stay here because the bride has been called to go a little higher okay so why higher because that's where the ingredients are the golden nuggets all the things that we need to sustain our life that's where they are so why do you stay here okay no no no it's the eight days where Jesus scream whoever need to drink come and drink freely amen it's that day we're living in amen oh my oh my do you love him amen okay I'm winding down spiritual adoption and and may I take this moment to say this my friend the entire Church of the Living God is built assembly upon the spiritual revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ no matter how educated you are how smart you may be how well you may think you know the Bible said and knows it to just a lot better than you but only through the revelation God through the Holy Spirit your true revealed to you that it saves You by his grace and if he will reveal to you this morning by the revelation of this is the end of your suffering this is the end of your sickness all Devils out torment will never shake this Foundation though every doctor say it's wrong for Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail it though I would be against it will be against it yet it cannot Prevail for when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will raise the standard against it every time what's tender the word the word of this time the world now we are God we are given that duty to always give her the food this spiritual food the food in the season but she must eat it we need to give her she need to take it and eat it but when I'm out maybe uh wind down with this uh finish with this maybe the musician can start coming God God bless you let's uh so he say this watching the bride walking they are walking and uh they're looking at him is like on a platform the bride is coming then you will see the bra the Church of the world coming oh she will step out of she will be out of Step a few of them in the back were not working according so it's not just walking but it's keep working it's not just working it's not just a rise from death but it's to remain alive it's not just working but it is keep walking are you with me and he say here and then I I now listen to what whatever I'm saying I have to watch her she will get out of step with the word if I don't watch when she passes by if she gets by maybe it will be my time ah let me just read it from my notes Here uh you can move it to whatever you want to do brother uh oh sorry about it okay I'm good maybe it will be time um when it will be my time when I'm over here when I'm finished whatever it is saying that I have to keep watching her if I don't watch her she will go out of Step and there was getting back trying the best those getting back the the girls the the ladies that were walking in the Rhythm the there was getting in line because they was looking out somewhere else instead of looking at William Branham the messenger of the time they were looking somewhere else because they were looking somewhere else watching out the church just that just went out into chaos I have to watch her are you with me let me change this how will brother Branham watch upon the bride when is Journey by the Venom's journey is over is that what he says maybe it will be my time when I'm over when I'm finished whatever I will keep watching her because she need the food but she needs to eat to stay in line how will he do it that not is a Ministry that's your ministry that's my Ministry I'm gonna read it differently how I will have to say I will ride this Trail again because I have to watch over her she will get out of steps if I don't watch her if the preachers Don't Preach the word she will come out

up amen we were dead and trespasses and sin and stuck in all kinds of worldly ideas and carnal thoughts of man but is that voice that woke us up but I'm also so glad that God told the prophet you stay here and make these tapes amen get all the good vegetables stored up in the storehouse because we're going to need it in the future and here we are in the future and there's a storehouse full of what we have need of to give us strength and overcoming this day amen now that he the voice that woke us up is the same voice that said feed her and he told the prophet stay behind and make all these days and then at the opening of the seals he gave us the secret ingredients for overcoming in this day by giving us the revelation of the word I say praise God it's hey I don't know if you remember I'm gonna I'm gonna say some bad stuff about myself but I used to watch TV a lot growing up we didn't know we weren't in the message I was raised on television but there was a commercial about Prego I don't know if you remember Prego but Prego had all the good ingredients in it and their catch line was it's in there they would say does it have this it's in there does it have this it's in there everything we have need of to overcome the enemy and all of his trappings is in the message amen the word of God has been unfolded the Bible has been open the seals have been taken off the word has been unveiled Christ has unveiled to his bride well you have need of it's in there amen our brother John amen by the by the ministry that God placed in him he was able to pull some of those things about complexes and things we wouldn't even imagine that the answer is in the message amen if we'll just take it in Simplicity and say God I believe that and you can even say I don't know how that will work can you imagine being the one who wrote out the question I mean they they wrote out the question for questions and answers I need something profound I have a complex I'm not able to get over it I need this is the prophet of God who can tap into the back part of God's mind I need an answer from God and wrote out their question and sincerity he read it out and he says just do the opposite just do the opposite you realize this was a prophet of God sent to us in this day to give us the mind of God and the solution to our problems if we could just take it in the simplicities delivered don't question it don't overthink it amen don't rationalize it just say God if that's the answer that you provided through this end time Prophet I'm going to take it in faith that it'll work to solve my problems I don't know how it doesn't make sense logically I don't need it to make sense logically I just want to have faith in your provided way and trust that however you connect the dots and make it work you'll make it work in my life because I believe in your provided way amen everything we acquire in the kingdom of God is acquired by faith anyways not by comprehension not by understanding
