TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know why we have emotion because god made us that way but when satan comes along and he offers you something that looks like an experience with god but it's actually just a motion you just experienced a bait and switch well i wanted god but what i got was emotion well how do we know look at what it produces look at what it produced we just read in the beginning of service because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life he's saying it's not an easy thing to find and he says beware of false prophets they'll come in in this way they'll come in with a lot of emotion oh but brother i feel this must be god give it the word test right we've learned that haven't we can we say amen to that we've learned to give it the word test everything we do we give ourselves we give everything else give it the word test i i think that's god i think it is well brother i know when god speaks to me oh do you really how about when the prophet of god was flying and and god grounded his plane and he's standing there he's going down the street god is that you and there's a policeman on the other side he stops and he looks in the window and he's embarrassed because he's just wandering around and he's there he's praying he says lord is that you the prophet of god who's spoken to god many many many times he's saying lord is that you if he questioned himself why would we not why do you think he shared that testimony with us that we might make that moment and verify it lord is this you because if it's just emotion the destination is going to be a motion it's going to be a zeal it's going to be a passion it's going to be a pride of life yes i am going to achieve or are you because if god chooses to have us fail we will fail but when we get to the point where i said lord i don't know what is up and what is down i don't know which way to go i want to be confident but lord i don't even know where to be confident but lord would you teach me he says oh my son my daughter i've just been waiting for you to ask
