TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's beyond Redemption you he says now think about what he says put a George Washington or an Abraham Lincoln in every County it can't come back that means you cannot bring it back by politics because of George Washington Abraham lincol in every County I mean wow that would be a change that would probably bring a lot of changes but you can't bring it back by politics that's why the magum movement is an Antichrist I I I say that I mean I I may have offended people but I don't mean to offend you but the prophet of God says she'll never come back she'll never rise again says she's Beyond Redemption so how can we believe that we can make America great again when the prophet of God has condemned it and said it'll never come back so there's not a candidate there's not a party there's not a Grassroots effort that can ever bring it back if so then the prophet of God was wrong y That's why we as the bride we don't need to have anything to do with any Politics the devil has it all under his control we don't need to worry about it so listen I I I just want to tell you I'm your brother and I love you and I'm not here to offend anybody I'm just here to tell you what I believe to be the absolute truth of this message and I don't mean to be offensive I don't mean to say things hard I just want to talk to you as a brother brother and I want to talk to you as a pastor and a shepherd of this local church and and say let's be led and G Guided by the word not by emotion not by politics not by our feelings and not even by our own desires because our own desires would want a better country our own desires would want morality our own desire listen friends uh when you look at when you look at uh when you look at two parties and you look at their platform and you look at what their stand for how can you not like policies on the right how can you not how can you agree with a strong National border how can you dis agree with parental rights to make decisions about gender choices for their children how can you not agree with how can you not agree about religious liberty how can you not agree about economic plans it it there's so many things that in the natural sense we would agree with and see as right and good and in line with what is righteous but don't forget the deception is always what's close not what's far away so be very very careful that we don't attach ourselves to something amen that is claiming to be able to do something that God said's not possible am God sent us a prophet for a reason he opened our eyes for a reason to keep us free to be a free people and to stay free amen
