[6:02] bow our heads and pray together
[6:05] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[6:07] jesus for the privilege of being here
[6:10] god that you have granted us lord safe
[6:12] passage lord to this place
[6:14] where we can come together and worship
[6:16] you in spirit and in truth and it's all
[6:19] by your grace lord not anything we have
[6:21] done but you've ordained it before the
[6:23] foundation of the world
[6:25] we are so grateful lord
[6:27] we just pray today lord that you would
[6:29] bless our efforts lord as we worship you
[6:31] as we give ourselves over to you and
[6:33] surrender and lift our voices and sing
[6:36] of your glory and your goodness i pray
[6:38] lord that you would abide in the praises
[6:40] of your people and god that you would
[6:42] use the foolishness of preaching to save
[6:45] our souls
[6:46] that you would speak to us the living
[6:48] word lord of eternal life god the word
[6:51] that will bring us into the position you
[6:53] foreordained us to be in in this last
[6:55] day
[6:56] all right i pray you take this vessel
[6:57] unto your control
[6:59] and that by the power of your spirit you
[7:01] would speak through a gift you've placed
[7:02] inside and that you might be the great
[7:05] shepherd that would come and feed your
[7:06] sheep with your own hand for we give you
[7:09] preeminence now
[7:10] have your way among us lord in jesus
[7:13] christ's name we pray
[7:15] amen
[7:17] and god bless you
[7:18] it's really really good to be in church
[7:20] today
[7:21] and we missed a couple services and
[7:25] you know sister angie got sick and she
[7:27] kept getting sicker and we finally gave
[7:29] her a cover test and she tested positive
[7:31] for kovitz so we had to isolate and do
[7:34] all of those things and the rest of us
[7:36] felt fine none of the rest of us got
[7:37] sick we were just stuck
[7:39] but not sick
[7:41] so but we appreciate all your prayers
[7:43] and then she was actually quite sick she
[7:46] got it kind of hard for four or five
[7:47] days and she was down and out and so we
[7:50] appreciate your prayers we appreciate
[7:51] the cards the text and then all your
[7:54] love and your concern and the meals that
[7:55] you brought it was a real blessing for
[7:57] us and we thank god the lord healed her
[7:59] she's about 100 percent now feeling
[8:02] really good
[8:03] and i'm glad she's feeling good because
[8:05] i was a homeschool mom for a few days
[8:08] and that is a really tough job amen
[8:12] and uh
[8:14] yeah
[8:15] i won't say anymore
[8:17] you you mothers and homeschool moms you
[8:19] have jewels in your crown in heaven i
[8:21] guarantee it amen and i was willing to
[8:24] pluck some of mine out and give them to
[8:25] her to decorate hers more after that few
[8:28] days of being a homeschool mom so
[8:30] i was ready to go back to being a pastor
[8:32] amen
[8:33] may god bless you all we appreciate you
[8:35] and so for us it's a real privilege it's
[8:37] a real
[8:38] it's a real treat to be here this
[8:39] morning with you and and we were the
[8:41] most excited and then when i saw the
[8:43] snowstorm was coming i said no no no no
[8:46] no no i can come back to church now
[8:49] don't do this
[8:50] so we thank god god was really good to
[8:52] us and really merciful so we appreciate
[8:55] that
[8:56] amen let's while we're standing take our
[8:58] bibles and turn to matthew chapter four
[9:02] while we're turning there i just want to
[9:04] uh show our appreciation for brother
[9:06] steve miller he's probably still out
[9:07] plowing but if you get a chance thanking
[9:10] him and he's plowing the snow so that we
[9:12] can come in the parking lot and also
[9:14] want to say you know whenever we have
[9:16] weather like this we usually say this
[9:17] every winter but i haven't said it yet
[9:19] because we thought we were going to have
[9:20] a winter with no snow
[9:22] but
[9:23] you know if you're uncomfortable getting
[9:25] out don't push yourself if you're not
[9:27] comfortable driving and the conditions
[9:29] and we continue to have service amen as
[9:32] long as we can get enough people
[9:33] together to have a serviceable stream
[9:35] amen so don't ever push yourself beyond
[9:37] your comfort level or get out there and
[9:39] feel obligated amen we're going to keep
[9:41] the doors open if we can unless it's
[9:43] just unsafe for everybody so that we can
[9:46] still have a service and still stream to
[9:47] those who weren't able to make it i saw
[9:50] some of you have driven quite a ways god
[9:51] bless you amen may the lord bless you
[9:53] for that
[9:55] and also i just wanted to let you know
[9:57] it was on the overhead but brother glenn
[10:00] tamblington called me yesterday to give
[10:02] me
[10:03] the details for the memorial service for
[10:05] sister lori they'll have that memorial
[10:07] service this coming saturday at 3 30
[10:10] there's information on the bulletin
[10:11] boards it'll be live streamed from their
[10:14] church and i know many of you would want
[10:16] a chance to to see that
[10:18] also i want to
[10:20] just mention to you to remember sister
[10:22] nancy morrow and her family and prayer
[10:25] you know brother john passed away
[10:26] yesterday
[10:28] and uh yeah you know sister nancy has
[10:30] gotten coveted and then brother john had
[10:31] gotten it and he had to go to the
[10:33] hospital and he started when he got in
[10:35] he started doing really well we
[10:36] responded to the auction really well he
[10:38] was doing good for about two days and
[10:40] then he started to decline and we went
[10:43] in there and talked to him and we prayed
[10:44] with him
[10:45] and
[10:46] he just he just fell off really really
[10:48] fast and one day he just totally turned
[10:50] around so we went in with the family and
[10:52] we prayed and we said lord
[10:54] you know our brother is 91 years old you
[10:56] know he's lived beyond the promise god
[10:59] has been good to him and he said lord
[11:01] we'd love to see you raise up our
[11:02] brother because we believe in healing
[11:04] but if it's your time to take him home
[11:06] we just pray that you take him home
[11:07] peacefully that he wouldn't linger in
[11:09] between you know sometimes you know the
[11:12] people would linger in such a terrible
[11:14] condition especially with covet
[11:16] and we prayed that prayer and after we
[11:18] prayed that prayer it was no time just
[11:20] within a day i believe it was that he
[11:22] passed away peacefully
[11:24] you know so we thank god that there
[11:26] wasn't a struggle wasn't a long-term
[11:28] struggle and our brother has gone to his
[11:30] reward
[11:32] amen he's blessed and he's happy but
[11:33] remember the family there'll be a
[11:35] memorial service this weekend we don't
[11:37] have all the details yet but as soon as
[11:38] we get those we'll send it out on email
[11:41] and text everybody so that you'll know
[11:43] it'll probably be saturday but but we're
[11:44] going to put those details together in
[11:46] the next day or two so just remember
[11:49] sister nancy especially
[11:52] also remember brother tim aaron as he
[11:54] recovers from his knee surgery just a
[11:56] little over six weeks ago he had one
[11:57] knee done now just six weeks later he
[12:00] had another knee done so i'm really
[12:02] excited to see the brother walk in these
[12:04] doors amen with two knees without the
[12:06] pain he had without a walker amen and it
[12:09] may take some time for him to get the
[12:11] full strength but we're praying that the
[12:12] lord will take him there quickly and to
[12:14] see him walking without pain in his
[12:16] knees would be a real treasure a real
[12:17] treat a real victory so remember him as
[12:20] he recovers remember his family sister
[12:22] janet i'm sure is tired she's been
[12:24] taking care of him for one knee surgery
[12:26] and then through the other and nursing
[12:28] is not easy i had a little taste of it
[12:31] i don't want to be a nurse or a
[12:32] homeschool mom
[12:35] so praise god
[12:37] amen god bless you brother nathanael i
[12:39] feel cheated that you're there and i'm
[12:42] here i would rather be there and you're
[12:43] here but but god bless you it's good to
[12:45] have you and sister charity and the kids
[12:47] here it's just good to be in church amen
[12:50] it's good to be back together whenever
[12:52] you lose that privilege for a couple
[12:54] services boy it's really nice to get
[12:56] back together again
[12:58] while we're standing i like to read out
[13:00] of matthew chapter four
[13:02] and i'd like to preach on the temptation
[13:04] of christ this morning and i really feel
[13:07] to just take some time and teach amen
[13:10] this is so familiar to us we know it so
[13:11] well but it just i don't know it's just
[13:13] been stirring in my heart i was reading
[13:15] through it out of luke in my just my
[13:17] personal devotions a month or two ago
[13:20] and it just struck me in a real unique
[13:22] way and i started looking at it and it
[13:24] opened up to me a little more so i just
[13:26] want to go through this whole familiar
[13:28] story and see what's there for us but
[13:30] let's read it here in matthew chapter 4
[13:32] verse 1.
[13:36] amen
[13:37] then was jesus led up of the spirit into
[13:40] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[13:42] devil
[13:43] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[13:45] nights he was afterward a hungered and
[13:47] when the tempter came to him he said if
[13:49] thou be the son of god command that
[13:52] these stones be made bread
[13:54] but he answered and said it is written
[13:56] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[13:58] every word that proceedeth out of the
[14:00] mouth of god
[14:01] then the devil taketh him up into a holy
[14:03] city
[14:04] unto the holy city and setteth him on a
[14:06] pinnacle of the temple
[14:08] and saith unto him if thou be the son of
[14:10] god cast thyself down for it is written
[14:13] he shall give his angels charge
[14:15] concerning thee and in their hands they
[14:17] shall bear thee up lest at any time thou
[14:20] dash thy foot against the stone
[14:22] jesus said unto him it is written again
[14:24] thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
[14:28] again the devil taketh him up into an
[14:30] exceeding high mountain and showeth him
[14:32] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[14:34] glory of them and saith unto him all
[14:37] these things will i give thee if thou
[14:39] wilt fall down and worship me
[14:41] then saith jesus unto him get the hint
[14:43] satan for it is written thou shall
[14:45] worship the lord thy god and him only
[14:48] shalt thou serve
[14:49] then the devil leaveth him and behold
[14:51] the angels came and ministered unto him
[14:55] may and god bless you as you have your
[14:57] seats and may the lord bless his word
[15:00] this morning
[15:02] amen i want to go if we could we're
[15:04] going to look at a few scriptures and
[15:06] we're going to get over to luke but
[15:07] let's go to genesis chapter 3
[15:10] together genesis chapter 3
[15:14] verse 6 we're going to look at the
[15:16] temptation of the woman by the serpent
[15:19] and we know that the serpent was
[15:20] incarnated by satan himself amen satan
[15:24] was working through the serpent to
[15:26] deceive the woman
[15:27] and so here we see
[15:29] this temptation on the earth i would say
[15:32] this first
[15:34] temptation in this dispensation
[15:36] amen of time and he says in genesis 3 6
[15:40] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[15:42] good for food and that it was pleasant
[15:44] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[15:46] make one wise she took of the fruit
[15:48] thereof and did eat and gave also into
[15:50] her husband with her and he did eat and
[15:53] the eyes of them both were open and they
[15:55] knew that they were naked and they sowed
[15:56] fig leaves together and made themselves
[15:59] aprons
[16:00] amen let's turn from there to james
[16:02] chapter one
[16:18] james chapter 1 verse 13.
[16:23] let no man say when he is tempted i am
[16:25] tempted of god
[16:26] for god cannot be tempted with evil
[16:28] neither tempteth he any man but every
[16:31] man is tempted when he is drawn away of
[16:33] his own lust and enticed
[16:36] then when lust hath conceived it
[16:38] bringeth forth sin and sin when it is
[16:40] finished bringeth forth death
[16:42] so the scripture in james is telling us
[16:44] clearly that every man is tempted when
[16:46] he's drawn away of his own lust the lust
[16:49] is already in you amen if you go to sin
[16:52] you're drawn away of your own lust
[16:56] and and when lust hath conceived it
[16:58] bring forth sin and when sin when it is
[17:00] finished bringeth forth death
[17:03] so it's all based on lust
[17:06] and lust is just a desire
[17:09] lust doesn't have to be evil in the
[17:11] bible this word that is translated into
[17:14] lust is not always in an evil
[17:16] connotation it can be good or evil so
[17:18] this word that we see for lust in the
[17:20] bible is also interpreted desire and so
[17:23] when jesus told his disciples i have
[17:25] desired to eat this supper with thee
[17:28] when he goes to the last supper with
[17:29] them that's the same word so all it
[17:32] means is a desire amen and so our
[17:35] desires we're tempted by our own desires
[17:39] and when those desires don't match the
[17:40] word of god amen they lead us away from
[17:43] the word of god are contrary to the word
[17:45] of god and when those desires conceive
[17:48] they bring forth allah bring forth sin
[17:50] and sin when it brings it will bring
[17:52] forth death when sin is concluded it'll
[17:54] bring forth death
[17:56] so we we have these desires and these
[17:59] desires are can be good or they can be
[18:02] evil but it's the desires that lead us
[18:04] into temptation
[18:06] let's look over here at first john
[18:08] while we're back in this part of the
[18:10] bible first john
[18:12] chapter 2
[18:17] and verse 15.
[18:23] it says love not the world neither the
[18:25] things that are in the world if any man
[18:27] loved the world the love of the father
[18:29] is not in him
[18:31] for all that is in the world the lust of
[18:33] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[18:36] pride of life is not of the father but
[18:39] is of the world
[18:40] and the world passes away in the lust
[18:42] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[18:44] god abideth forever
[18:47] so we know that this lust is wrong lust
[18:50] what leads us to to sin amen is what's
[18:53] of the world is the lust of the eye the
[18:56] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[18:58] and the pride of life i'll read that
[19:00] again verse 16 for all that is in the
[19:02] world the lust of the eyes the lust of
[19:05] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[19:06] pride of life is not of the father but
[19:09] is of the world so this kind of love is
[19:12] a lust is a worldly lust this kind of
[19:15] desire this lust of the flesh lust of
[19:17] the eyes and the pride of life is of the
[19:20] world and is not of the father and the
[19:23] world will pass away and the lust
[19:24] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[19:27] god abideth forever
[19:30] amen brother branham tells us in the
[19:32] laodicean church age
[19:34] out of the church age book a quick look
[19:36] at those scriptures which involve the
[19:38] lord jesus overcoming will bring out the
[19:40] truth of this proposition and matthew 4
[19:44] wherein jesus is tempted of the devil he
[19:46] overcame the personal temptations of
[19:49] satan by the word
[19:51] and by the word only
[19:53] i want you to hold on to that he
[19:55] overcame by the word and by the word
[19:57] only he didn't need anything else to
[20:00] defeat the temptations of the devil at
[20:03] his time of tempting but the word in the
[20:05] word only he didn't need the word and
[20:07] supernatural gifts he didn't need the
[20:10] word and and and experience it he all he
[20:12] needed was the word
[20:15] oh i love that
[20:16] something exciting
[20:18] to me because if if the word was enough
[20:22] then the word is still enough
[20:26] if the word was enough there the word is
[20:28] still enough here and if and if if the
[20:32] word would defeat the devil there the
[20:33] word will defeat the devil here so
[20:36] brother brown tells us that jesus showed
[20:38] us how we could overcome and he put it
[20:40] in the hands of the weakest christian
[20:42] and because he didn't use his
[20:44] supernatural abilities he didn't use his
[20:46] supernatural gifts what he used was it
[20:48] is written showing that any christian
[20:51] can use the word and defeat the devil
[20:54] anytime anywhere any place under any
[20:57] condition amen
[20:59] so so we don't have to have super gifts
[21:01] amen amen gifts are part of the church
[21:03] it's part of the experience of the new
[21:05] testament church and brother bannon said
[21:07] those gifts are there to keep the church
[21:08] clean
[21:10] but we don't need the gifts to defeat
[21:12] the devil what we need is the word amen
[21:15] that's why i think you know we can
[21:18] oh
[21:19] lord help me
[21:21] it is so
[21:22] it is so easy
[21:24] to to to get
[21:26] the wrong mindset and go in the wrong
[21:28] direction and have the wrong desire when
[21:31] we start seeking gifts and supernatural
[21:33] things and tangible things to see and
[21:35] things we feel and sensations and all
[21:37] that because those things are wonderful
[21:39] amen those experiences are one that have
[21:41] been wonderful to us they become anchors
[21:43] in our life in different places in our
[21:45] life amen but those those in themselves
[21:48] are not enough to defeat the devil amen
[21:50] there's many a gifted man that has
[21:52] fallen by temptation
[21:55] there's many a man that's been very
[21:56] gifted and had
[21:58] mighty works in their life and in their
[22:00] ministry and power and demonstrations
[22:02] and all of that and have fallen into sin
[22:04] and fallen into ruin showing that the
[22:06] gift was not enough but the word is
[22:07] enough amen and he defeated him by the
[22:10] word and the word only and it's amazing
[22:12] that at the end time what would be
[22:14] restored to us at the end time remember
[22:17] the gifts were restored under the
[22:18] pentecostal revival amen but what was
[22:21] restored in the bride's revival was the
[22:24] fullness of the word so the gifts came
[22:27] back in the pentecostal revival because
[22:29] they belong in the church they're part
[22:31] of the new testament church it's part of
[22:33] the word and must be there amen but in
[22:35] order for the ultimate victory over the
[22:38] temptation the complete victory over the
[22:40] devil requires the word only so at the
[22:43] end time it's not a pentecostal revival
[22:46] it's the bride's revival and the bride's
[22:48] revival is the restoration of the word
[22:50] back to the church so the church can
[22:52] have a complete victory over sin
[22:55] [Applause]
[22:58] if the gifts were enough amen the
[23:01] pentecostal revival in this restoration
[23:03] of the gifts at azusa street would have
[23:05] been the final
[23:06] move to bring rapturing faith to
[23:09] overcome all the world amen but it
[23:12] wasn't the final move the final move
[23:14] come under malachi 4 when the headship
[23:16] was restored back to the body when the
[23:18] word came back and that was the final
[23:21] thing the church needed to have ultimate
[23:23] absolute complete victory in this day
[23:27] praise be to god
[23:31] so he said
[23:35] i'm going to go on here
[23:37] matthew 4 when jesus is tempted of the
[23:39] devil he overcame the personal
[23:40] temptations of satan by the word
[23:43] and by the word only in each of the
[23:45] three major trials that corresponded
[23:47] exactly to the temptation
[23:49] exactly to the temptation of the garden
[23:52] of eden
[23:53] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[23:55] eye the pride of life jesus overcame by
[23:59] the word
[24:01] john tells us all that is in the world
[24:04] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[24:06] eye and the and the pride of life jesus
[24:08] overcame all that was in the world
[24:11] these were the things that eve was
[24:13] tempted by and foul these were the very
[24:16] same things the temptations of jesus
[24:18] corresponded with the same temptations
[24:20] of eve in the garden of eden so jesus
[24:22] was here reconciling what was lost by
[24:25] the fall in the garden he was
[24:26] reconciling by facing the same three
[24:28] temptations which is all that's in the
[24:30] world
[24:32] and he overcame them by the word
[24:36] amen let's read that again for by the in
[24:39] each of the three major trials that
[24:41] corresponded exactly to the temptation
[24:43] in the garden of eden the lust of the
[24:45] flesh the lust of the eye and the pride
[24:46] of life jesus overcame by the word
[24:49] he fell to the to the personal
[24:51] temptation of satan by failing to use
[24:54] the word
[24:55] adam fell in direct disobedience to the
[24:57] word but jesus overcame by the word and
[25:00] right now let me say that this is the
[25:03] only way
[25:05] sorry this is the only way to be an
[25:07] overcomer also it is the only way that
[25:09] you can know if you're an overcomer
[25:11] because the word can't fail the only way
[25:14] to be an overcomer is by the word what
[25:16] do we have today the restoration of the
[25:19] word we have the ingredients for
[25:20] overcoming
[25:23] so we should be above all people most
[25:25] thankful
[25:30] hebrews 4 15 i'll just read it to you
[25:33] hebrews 4 15 says for we have not a high
[25:36] priest which cannot be touched with the
[25:38] feeling of our infirmities but was in
[25:40] all points tempted like as we are yet
[25:43] without sin
[25:45] in all ways he was tempted like we are
[25:48] in all the temptation the world can
[25:49] offer but he never deviated from the
[25:52] word he never disbelieved
[25:54] let's go back to luke chapter 4
[25:57] and i want to pick up this temptation in
[25:59] the wilderness
[26:01] over here in luke
[26:10] chapter 4
[26:11] and we'll begin at verse 1.
[26:15] and jesus being full of the holy ghost
[26:17] return
[26:18] returned from jordan was led by the
[26:20] spirit
[26:22] into the wilderness being 40 days
[26:24] tempted of the devil and in those days
[26:26] he did eat nothing and when they were
[26:28] ended he afterward hungered
[26:30] and the devil said unto him if thou be
[26:33] the son of god command the stone that it
[26:35] be made bread and jesus answered him
[26:37] saying it is written that man shall not
[26:40] live by bread alone but by every word of
[26:42] god
[26:43] and the devil taketh him up into a high
[26:45] mountain
[26:46] showed unto him all the kingdoms of the
[26:48] world in a moment of time and the devil
[26:50] said unto him all this power will i give
[26:52] thee and the glory of them for that is
[26:55] delivered unto me and to whosoever i
[26:57] will give it if thou therefore wilt
[26:59] worship me all shall be thine
[27:02] and jesus answered and said unto him get
[27:04] thee behind me satan for it is written
[27:06] thou shalt worship the lord thy god and
[27:08] him only shalt thou serve
[27:11] and he brought him into jerusalem and
[27:13] set him on a pinnacle of the temple and
[27:15] said unto him if thou be the son of god
[27:17] cast thyself down from hence for it is
[27:20] written he shall give his angels charge
[27:22] over thee to keep thee
[27:24] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[27:26] up lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[27:28] against a stone and jesus answered and
[27:31] said unto him
[27:32] uh unto him it is said thou shall not
[27:35] tempt the lord thy god and when the
[27:37] devil had ended all the temptation he
[27:39] departed from him for a season
[27:43] i like that word for a season
[27:46] he didn't depart forever just because he
[27:47] had victory he departed for a season
[27:50] now i want to look at this word tempted
[27:52] if we go back up to verse 2 it says
[27:55] being 40 days tempted of the devil this
[27:57] word tempted means to try to prove to a
[28:00] save to examine these are the ways it's
[28:02] used in the new testament to tempt and
[28:05] the definition they give from the
[28:06] concordance is to try whether a thing
[28:08] can be done to attempt to endeavor to
[28:11] try to make a trial a test for the
[28:14] purpose of ascertaining his quan
[28:16] quantity or what he thinks or how he
[28:19] will behave himself so this temptation
[28:22] is a test to see how he'll respond to
[28:26] see how he'll handle this situation it's
[28:29] a test to prove or to quantify or to
[28:32] qualify whatever you're testing in this
[28:35] in this instance they're testing the son
[28:37] of god the son of god is being tested to
[28:39] see what's in him and what what what he
[28:42] is amen how he'll react
[28:44] and then when we get down to to verse 13
[28:47] he said the devil had ended all the
[28:49] temptation this word temptation
[28:51] means an experiment attempt a trial a
[28:55] proving
[28:56] the trial of a man's fidelity integrity
[28:59] virtue constancy also an enticement to
[29:02] sin temptation whether arising from the
[29:04] desires or from the outward
[29:06] circumstances in eternal temptation to
[29:08] sin so it's a trial approving jesus amen
[29:13] after he was filled with the holy ghost
[29:14] amen he was led into the wilderness to
[29:17] be tempted of the devil amen so the
[29:19] baptism of the holy ghost the indwelling
[29:22] of the holy ghost for jesus put him
[29:23] straight into a trial to be tempted of
[29:26] the devil
[29:27] it wasn't amen i should say it this way
[29:31] the the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[29:33] did not equate to then everything going
[29:36] perfect and no more trials and more no
[29:37] more temptations and everything no the
[29:40] baptism holy ghost now equipped him to
[29:42] go face to trial amen and brother
[29:45] branham said this happens to every
[29:46] believer after you're filled with the
[29:48] holy ghost then the trials really start
[29:50] coming down upon you
[29:53] amen so jesus goes to the wilderness to
[29:56] be tempted to be tested to be proved
[29:58] amen to find out as it says in here the
[30:01] fidelity the integrity the virtue the
[30:04] constancy that is within to prove him as
[30:07] a son of god
[30:09] amen
[30:11] so he overcame
[30:13] everything that he fell by
[30:15] brother franco if we could pull up the
[30:17] white board i'm going to draw this out
[30:20] real quickly
[30:23] if i can
[30:25] i will try
[30:28] i like this whiteboard app because
[30:30] really what i should have done is made a
[30:31] powerpoint
[30:33] but this is a cheap way to do a
[30:34] powerpoint it's easier for me
[30:38] amen
[30:39] so we have
[30:41] what did i do
[30:45] so we have
[30:49] three
[30:52] temptations
[30:54] brother branham said they directly
[30:56] correspond with the temptations
[30:59] of eve
[31:00] so you have lust
[31:05] of the flesh
[31:09] and for eve
[31:14] for eve
[31:15] she saw
[31:16] that the tree was good for food
[31:21] right
[31:23] for jesus
[31:28] he was asked
[31:29] to turn the stone
[31:32] into bread
[31:35] why
[31:36] he had fasted 40 days and was hungered
[31:39] so it was the
[31:41] lust of the flesh
[31:44] then number two
[31:48] is the lust
[31:51] of the eyes
[31:54] for eve
[31:56] she saw that the tree
[31:59] was
[32:00] pleasant
[32:05] to the eyes
[32:08] for jesus
[32:12] he showed him all the kingdoms
[32:18] of the world
[32:21] and their glory
[32:25] and the third one we have
[32:28] is the pride of life
[32:32] for eve
[32:35] the tree
[32:36] would make one wise
[32:42] and for jesus
[32:45] and brother brahm gets into this a
[32:47] little bit later
[32:49] was to
[32:50] prove
[32:53] his sonship
[32:58] by a miracle
[33:03] all right so these are
[33:06] and brother bam said there's a direct
[33:07] correspondence between the the three
[33:10] temptations of evil the three desires or
[33:12] lust that she had and what jesus
[33:14] overcame
[33:16] in the wilderness
[33:17] and he goes on to say in the message how
[33:19] can i overcome from 1963
[33:22] in the days of daniel's time there were
[33:24] four overcomers that could stand the
[33:25] test of fire and lion
[33:27] now we're expected to be tested that's a
[33:29] good lesson my brother back there also
[33:32] he that come with the god must first be
[33:33] tested tested what with the word that's
[33:36] god's test you believe it he that cometh
[33:39] to god must be tested that only shows a
[33:41] true child then see be tested and when
[33:44] the test comes you can't overcome unless
[33:47] there's a test given to you and when the
[33:49] test is given it's to see whether you
[33:51] can overcome or not and jesus said to
[33:54] him that overcometh the test the test is
[33:56] the greatest thing that ever happened to
[33:58] you i believe it's written in scripture
[33:59] peter said our trials are
[34:01] worth more to us than precious gold it
[34:04] is a testing time it's one good evidence
[34:06] to us that god is with us when we're
[34:08] tested for all children of god are
[34:10] tested and tried
[34:13] so if we're all going to be tested eve
[34:15] was tested jesus was tested brother
[34:17] benham said we'll be tested i think it
[34:19] behooves us to look at who failed the
[34:21] test and who passed the test and learn
[34:24] from jesus the example that how we
[34:26] should pass the test but not just how we
[34:28] pass the test also the tactics of the
[34:31] devil when he brings the test so i'm
[34:34] going to look at the tactics of the
[34:36] devil and i want to look at how jesus
[34:38] overcame those tactics because we're
[34:40] told that we must be tested and he came
[34:42] as an example for us hey listen in
[34:45] reality folks when
[34:46] brother branham said that if you are
[34:49] expressed attribute of god a seed gene
[34:51] of god then you were in jesus christ
[34:53] when he walked this earth amen that's
[34:55] why you don't have to pay for your sins
[34:57] you already paid for them when you were
[34:58] in that body in calvary
[35:01] so that means you already passed this
[35:04] test in the wilderness in that body
[35:07] amen and so now the testing is coming
[35:11] amen the bride is being tested as well
[35:14] she's being tested what with the word
[35:15] how she overcoming with the word amen
[35:18] it's a word test for a word bride to
[35:21] prove that shall stay with the word and
[35:22] the word only
[35:25] and so brother graham said every child
[35:27] is tested
[35:29] man i want to look at galatians chapter
[35:31] 5 because i i view this as a critical
[35:36] scripture for what we're talking about
[35:38] in galatians chapter 5.
[35:46] galatians chapter 5
[35:49] and let's start with verse 16.
[35:54] this i say then walk in the spirit and
[35:57] you shall not fulfill the lust of the
[35:59] flesh
[36:00] i think this is a critical spirit for
[36:02] what a critical scripture for what we're
[36:04] talking about walk in the spirit and you
[36:07] shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[36:10] what do we need to do we need to get in
[36:11] the spirit and we need to walk in the
[36:13] spirit we need to get in the sphere and
[36:14] stay in the spirit amen
[36:17] we need the we need the baptism the holy
[36:19] ghost but we must stay in the spirit and
[36:21] stay in the spiritual realms and stay
[36:23] under the influence of the spirit and we
[36:26] will not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[36:27] because that's what he fell by that's
[36:30] what everybody has fallen by these three
[36:33] examples of all that is in the world the
[36:35] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[36:37] and the pride of life that's all that is
[36:39] in the world and it's not of the father
[36:41] amen and and how do we overcome it
[36:43] because if we walk in the spirit we
[36:45] shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[36:48] so this is a critical scripture
[36:50] verse 17 for the flesh lusteth against
[36:53] the spirit and the spirit against the
[36:55] flesh and these are contrary to one to
[36:58] the other so that you cannot do the
[37:00] things that you would
[37:02] so i say praise god amen god has given
[37:05] us his spirit not in partial measure but
[37:08] in format full measure amen the portion
[37:11] that was in jesus christ amen that day
[37:13] that he went to the test that same
[37:15] portion has been poured out to the bride
[37:17] universal today amen the same life that
[37:19] was in christ is the same life that's
[37:21] here
[37:23] and if you walk in the spirit you shall
[37:24] not fulfill the lust of the flesh so
[37:26] it's it's this is when we start to teach
[37:28] on this we're not coming up with an abcd
[37:31] formula for overcoming no none of this
[37:34] works if you're not in the spirit amen
[37:36] and if you're in the spirit you'll not
[37:37] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[37:41] because we're going to find out the dev
[37:43] that the devil's tactics are so subtle
[37:45] amen they're so deceptive amen they're
[37:48] not they're not simply detected that
[37:50] there's no way that you're going to
[37:51] overcome unless you're in the spirit
[37:53] unless the spirit of god amen is
[37:56] discerning in you unless the spirit of
[37:58] god is the interpreter of the word in
[38:00] you unless you've got the spirit of god
[38:02] which is the life of the word amen to to
[38:05] give you the correct understanding of
[38:07] the word without that you'll never
[38:09] overcome this temptation
[38:12] so you have to walk in the spirit
[38:17] that walk in the spirit to me
[38:20] it denotes a constancy uh uh uh uh you
[38:23] know walk in the spirit is not be filled
[38:26] with the spirit because you can be
[38:28] filled with the spirit and then walk
[38:29] another way but this walk in the spirit
[38:32] shows a daily life it shows a constancy
[38:34] a consistency a walking in the spirit
[38:37] all the time and you shall not fulfill
[38:39] the lust of the flesh amen and if we'll
[38:41] just really
[38:42] be honest with ourselves and really
[38:44] think about our own lives it's those
[38:46] times that we've been filled with the
[38:48] spirit of god but when we begin to walk
[38:50] with other things amen that we get
[38:52] tripped up in the lust of the flesh amen
[38:54] but if we would walk in the spirit we
[38:56] should not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[38:58] amen what has been given to us is an
[39:00] opportunity that no other age has had
[39:02] amen when the fullness of the word came
[39:05] the fullness of the life of that word
[39:06] came with it and we can walk with that
[39:08] life amen
[39:11] and i think we for for me
[39:15] it's worth the effort friends it's worth
[39:17] the diligence it's worth the sincerity
[39:20] to me god has been really dealing with
[39:22] me later lately that i want to be in the
[39:25] spirit like i don't just want to take
[39:27] for granted
[39:28] amen that i've been sealed i'm sealed to
[39:30] the day of my redemption i believe that
[39:32] with all of my heart but i want a
[39:34] greater earnestness i want a greater
[39:36] devotion to god god has been dealing
[39:38] with me in these realms that i don't
[39:39] give him a cheap devotion because my
[39:42] salvation was not cheap amen the
[39:44] sacrifice of christ was not cheap amen
[39:47] those who have sacrificed their lives
[39:49] before me to lay down the word through
[39:51] the church ages to lay down the word
[39:52] that we have in our bible it wasn't
[39:54] cheap it wasn't without effort it wasn't
[39:56] without i mean it's a real sacrifice of
[39:58] life so why would i take everything
[40:01] that's been given to us in this time and
[40:02] offer god a cheap devotion my spare time
[40:05] 15 minutes here or a service there i
[40:07] don't want to give him a cheap devotion
[40:09] i want to be devoted to him
[40:12] and so god has really been
[40:15] just dealing with me in prayer and
[40:17] dealing with my life i want to be in the
[40:19] spirit amen and to be in the spirit i've
[40:22] got to say no to other things and i've
[40:24] got to turn from other things i've got
[40:26] to be diligent and sincere i have to put
[40:28] forth effort i have to be decided and
[40:31] determined to do what i'm going to do on
[40:33] a daily basis to walk in the spirit
[40:36] because i can listen to a message or i
[40:38] can listen to
[40:41] whatever
[40:42] news podcast on something i i i'm
[40:45] interested in or trying to learn
[40:46] whatever it might be amen i'm not
[40:48] talking about good versus evil i'm
[40:50] talking about just diligently saying
[40:53] amen i've got to walk in the spirit and
[40:55] give christ my whole life because the
[40:57] second great fold of his threefold plan
[40:59] is to have preeminence that's first
[41:01] place that's the right to rule inside of
[41:04] his bride
[41:06] and he's a gentleman he doesn't take
[41:08] what's not given to him
[41:11] so i want to give him a greater devotion
[41:14] because i want to walk in the spirit i
[41:16] want to live a spirit life i want to
[41:18] walk in the spirit i want to be directed
[41:20] by the spirit i want to walk into the
[41:21] spirit and not fulfill the lust of the
[41:23] flesh
[41:27] and so when jesus testing time come he
[41:30] showed us
[41:31] that he was in the spirit the spirit was
[41:33] in him
[41:35] john had seen the holy ghost in the form
[41:37] of a dove descend and rest upon him and
[41:40] immediately amen the spirit led him into
[41:43] the wilderness to be tempted but he was
[41:45] walking in the spirit and he was able to
[41:47] overcome
[41:48] all that is in the world
[41:51] in that temptation
[41:54] brother brahm said in the message the
[41:55] god of this evil age in 1965
[41:58] we find now this evil age is to prove to
[42:00] satan she is not like eve
[42:03] oh we've preached on that before but why
[42:05] is the world so evil to prove that she's
[42:08] not like eve
[42:10] why is it you've come in the darkest
[42:13] time
[42:14] in human history why is it that you've
[42:16] come at the pinnacle of satan's eden why
[42:19] are you here in satan's eden why are you
[42:21] here in the darkest time why to prove
[42:23] that you're not like eve
[42:27] we find out this evil age oh praise god
[42:30] this evil age is not to give satan
[42:32] victory this evil age is not not not
[42:35] god's defeat or the defeat of the word
[42:37] this evil age is to prove
[42:40] to satan she is not like eve
[42:42] that she is not that type of woman and
[42:45] she will be tried by his word the bride
[42:48] as adam's bride was tried by the word
[42:51] and adam's bride believed every bit of
[42:52] the word all but confused on one promise
[42:55] and he's the same yesterday today and
[42:57] forever today see
[42:59] but failed on one promise under the
[43:01] temptation of the enemy face to face and
[43:03] now the people that's called for his
[43:05] name of course is his bride she has come
[43:08] in contact again by the same thing not
[43:10] by just denominational truth or
[43:12] something but every word
[43:16] you know when when eve
[43:18] was in the garden amen adam and the
[43:21] woman were in the garden of eden she had
[43:24] the full word for that day
[43:27] she had the word she needed for
[43:29] overcoming she was equipped with
[43:31] everything that she needed to defeat the
[43:33] devil in all of his tactics
[43:36] and she had the full word for her day
[43:38] amen and she let down on the full word
[43:42] amen because of their desire because of
[43:45] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[43:47] flesh the pride of life she let down on
[43:50] the word when she let down the word
[43:52] that's how the fall came into to being
[43:54] and jesus christ was here on earth to
[43:56] reverse what eve had lost there so he
[43:58] faces down the same three things and
[44:01] overcomes them by the word amen
[44:03] so eve was given everything she needs to
[44:06] overcome we have been given everything
[44:08] we need to overcome and everything we
[44:11] need to overcome is in this word
[44:14] that is why amen for me there is no
[44:17] watering down the message there is no
[44:19] neglecting the message there is no
[44:21] making excuses for the way brother
[44:22] bradham taught a scripture there is no
[44:25] there is no cleaning up the message amen
[44:28] god brought that man to bring us the
[44:30] correct interpretation of the word with
[44:33] divine vindication so that we would have
[44:35] everything we need in this day to
[44:37] overcome the devil and if you start
[44:39] playing around with that word amen you
[44:41] start correcting a prophet and you start
[44:43] saying well he didn't really mean that
[44:45] in that scripture he he kind of misused
[44:47] that or he meant he meant millennium
[44:50] when he said this
[44:53] you start to do that you're going to
[44:55] start to deteriorate your ability to
[44:57] overcome the devil and all of his
[44:59] tactics
[45:02] amen
[45:04] now don't don't
[45:06] don't go farther than i'm going with
[45:08] that because brother benham said well i
[45:10] had that wrong or i made a mistake there
[45:12] and that was not 700 it was 7 000.
[45:14] listen we're not talking about those
[45:16] things but the way brother branham
[45:18] teaches a scripture and when he uses
[45:19] that scripture he knows what scripture
[45:21] he's using amen he knows where to place
[45:24] it in time he's not misplacing that
[45:26] scripture he's not misplacing that word
[45:28] amen he knows exactly what he's doing
[45:33] that's like when he comes to the uh
[45:36] choosing of a bride ameni he starts with
[45:38] two scriptures at the beginning of
[45:39] choosing of a bride he starts with
[45:41] eleazar going and fetching a bride for
[45:43] isaac then he goes right to the seventh
[45:46] vile angel pouring out his vial and in
[45:48] that message he preaches the choosing of
[45:51] a bride and at the end he says oh
[45:52] capernaum oh capernaum what is it it's
[45:55] the seventh angel pouring out the vial
[45:57] he wasn't out of kilter with the word he
[46:00] knew exactly where he was he was using a
[46:02] scripture that tied to the seventh vial
[46:04] angel and he was there fulfilling it at
[46:07] the end of that message saying oh
[46:09] capernaum capernaum
[46:13] so we don't want to we don't want to
[46:15] deviate from this message that's brought
[46:17] us back to the correct understanding of
[46:20] this word
[46:23] because eve had everything she needed
[46:26] we've been given everything we need
[46:28] but tell me where you got it if you
[46:31] didn't get it from this message
[46:35] i found some truth on the internet and i
[46:37] found this teeth bible teacher and
[46:40] if listen
[46:43] if you didn't get it from this message
[46:44] how do you know it's pure
[46:46] [Music]
[46:48] how do you know
[46:50] it'll defend you in the day of trial how
[46:52] do you know
[46:54] and i hope that you understand this
[46:56] better as i go on
[46:58] how how true that this statement is
[47:03] he goes on in this quote
[47:05] let me just back up here
[47:08] he said the bride will be tested by the
[47:09] word just like adam's bride was tested
[47:11] by the word she has to come in contact
[47:14] again by the same thing not by just
[47:15] denominational truth or something but
[47:17] every word
[47:18] for in the beginning of the bible man
[47:20] was given the word of god to live by one
[47:22] word misinterpreted
[47:24] by a man called satan and a person of an
[47:26] animal called the serpent satan and a
[47:28] person could talk to eve and
[47:30] misinterpret the word to her and was
[47:32] lost see it must be
[47:34] every word
[47:37] see what was the serpent doing what was
[47:39] satan doing in the serpent he was saying
[47:41] yes i know he said but but think about
[47:44] it i mean he didn't really mean that
[47:46] you'll not surely die amen
[47:50] but i have heard that same voice do that
[47:54] same thing with things brother branham
[47:56] taught
[47:58] things he taught on marriage and divorce
[48:00] amen things that that he taught on oh
[48:03] you just name all kinds of subjects that
[48:05] he taught i've heard that same voice
[48:07] take this beautiful message that was
[48:09] given to us and start trying to to say
[48:12] well i know he said but
[48:18] amen if you start listening to that
[48:20] voice you're going to lose the wall of
[48:21] protection amen you're going to lose the
[48:23] very thing that's been given to us to
[48:25] overcome the devil in this day
[48:29] amen
[48:30] so i want to look at
[48:32] uh three things that the devil tempted
[48:36] jesus by
[48:43] one
[48:46] the first was
[48:52] his position
[48:56] as the son of god
[49:02] he knew that he was hungered he had been
[49:04] 40 days in fasting and afterwards he was
[49:07] a hunger
[49:08] and he says if thou be the son of god
[49:12] turn this stone into bread
[49:15] and brother branham says here and god's
[49:17] power to transform from 1965
[49:20] satan tried and tried again to spray it
[49:22] he took him up and said if you if you
[49:25] are what you say you are then do some of
[49:27] this healing here for me show me how you
[49:30] can do it turn this bread and this stone
[49:33] into bread let's see you like take a
[49:35] dive because the scripture says you'll
[49:37] do it
[49:38] you see them religious devils today
[49:40] still saying the same thing
[49:43] what are they doing to brother branham
[49:44] if you've got the power to heal let me
[49:45] one said let me take a little girl and
[49:47] cut her hand and we'll stand here in the
[49:48] midst of the brother and you heal her
[49:51] it's the same devil if there is such a
[49:53] thing as divine healing here lays
[49:55] brother so-and-so let's see you heal him
[49:57] that same devil stood at jesus at the
[49:59] cross said if thou be the son of god
[50:01] come down off the cross
[50:03] the word said he was the son of god the
[50:05] spirit proved he was the son of god
[50:07] isaiah 9 6 was fulfilled and the other
[50:09] night many of you in the broadcast heard
[50:11] how that we give 60 some odd scriptures
[50:13] almost i believe about proving what that
[50:15] the scripture said that that was him
[50:18] so
[50:19] jesus knew who he was amen he he had his
[50:23] identity given to him by a revelation
[50:26] from the father he knew who he was but
[50:28] the first attack that the devil brings
[50:31] is an attack against his sonship his
[50:33] position in god and he said then he says
[50:37] if you be
[50:39] if you be the son of god
[50:41] turn this stone into bread because
[50:43] you're hungry
[50:45] amen
[50:47] but jesus never took the bait
[50:50] because what's he trying to do the devil
[50:53] amen is trying the devil in this tactic
[50:57] he's trying to get you to look somewhere
[51:00] other than the word for your sonship
[51:04] if thou be the son of god turn the stone
[51:06] into bread if thou be the son of god
[51:08] come off the cross
[51:10] you understand
[51:12] and so jesus amen never took the bait
[51:15] because if he would have went down that
[51:17] line then he would have never been able
[51:19] to find ultimate security in his
[51:22] position and his sonship because it
[51:24] would have been from one hoop to the
[51:25] next hoop that now if you're the son of
[51:27] god and if he would have turned the
[51:28] stone into bread which brother branham
[51:30] said i believe he could have he could
[51:32] have if he would have turned the stone
[51:33] in the bread then the devil can ask the
[51:35] same question in the next circumstance
[51:37] that he has a need
[51:39] and then the next time he has a need the
[51:41] same it's an endless cycle of questions
[51:43] because he's looking to manifestations
[51:46] as evidence of sonship and jesus was not
[51:48] going to take the bait to go to
[51:50] manifestations as evidence of sonship
[51:52] his evidence of sonship was a revelation
[51:54] of the scriptures
[51:57] [Music]
[52:00] you have to have
[52:01] an individual encounter with god who
[52:04] reveals to you your position in him and
[52:07] he will reveal that to you out of the
[52:10] scriptures
[52:12] so that your faith is based on your
[52:14] experience and the word amen
[52:19] so jesus had had an experience with god
[52:21] just before this when the when the
[52:24] spirit as a dove in the form of a dove
[52:26] descended and rested upon him he had his
[52:28] experience he had his revelation he had
[52:30] the scriptures he knew who he was we
[52:32] know because at 12 years old when he was
[52:34] when he was speaking with the with the
[52:36] the doctors of law and the scribes and
[52:38] the pharisees amen and mary came and
[52:41] said my father and i thought he was
[52:43] tears amen he says didn't you know i
[52:45] must be about my father's business he
[52:47] knew at 12 years old that he was the son
[52:49] of god amen
[52:53] so he knew he was he had an experience
[52:56] with god
[52:57] and he didn't need anything else to
[53:00] prove his sonship and he didn't need to
[53:02] prove his sonship to anybody else
[53:09] oh this is look at the tactics how many
[53:11] times has the devil come to you you're
[53:13] sick you need this you pray and and and
[53:16] god forbid amen you take the bait and
[53:19] you pray and god has another plan for
[53:21] your life and he doesn't give you that
[53:23] job he doesn't change these
[53:24] circumstances he doesn't heal you
[53:26] immediately and you go on and continue
[53:28] sick and all of a sudden you've taken
[53:29] the devil's lie his misinterpretation of
[53:32] the word and you've taken that and now
[53:35] because it didn't come to pass now
[53:36] you're questioning your sonship based
[53:38] off a manifestation and you've totally
[53:40] walked away from the word amen that's
[53:42] right
[53:46] the bride's going to stand on the word
[53:49] and the word only
[53:53] brother says in the message to see jesus
[53:56] from 1954 it says and we see satan then
[53:59] tell him said now if you be the son of
[54:01] god let's see you do a miracle for me
[54:03] now i'll give you something to do and if
[54:05] you do it i'll believe you're the son of
[54:08] god in so many words now here you're
[54:10] hungry now you can turn these stones
[54:12] into bread nothing bad about nothing bad
[54:14] about that you make them bread and eat
[54:16] and sit down there and eat and turn them
[54:18] stones to bread and
[54:20] oh i'll believe you
[54:22] do you think he would have believed him
[54:24] no
[54:26] you can't make a deal with the devil
[54:28] because he never keeps us into the deal
[54:32] i'll believe you and i'll never i'll
[54:33] never question your sonship again
[54:37] you pray this one time and if god moves
[54:39] supernaturally according to your prayer
[54:41] i'll never question your sonship again
[54:45] you lay hands on your daughter and she's
[54:46] healed from fever this time i'll never
[54:49] make you doubt your sonship again
[54:53] he's a liar and the father of it amen
[54:56] don't take the bait don't step into that
[55:01] if if god will he listen
[55:04] oh
[55:05] manifestations are never equal to
[55:08] sonship
[55:15] praise god
[55:18] he says now you're hungry turn these
[55:20] stones into bread turn them stones of
[55:22] bread and i'll believe you why jesus
[55:24] could have done that i believe but he
[55:26] said it's written man shall not live by
[55:28] bread alone he just found out satan did
[55:30] that he wasn't meeting moses that time
[55:33] he said it's written man shall not live
[55:35] by bread alone but by every word that
[55:37] proceedeth out of the mouth of god look
[55:40] at what jesus said he said a man doesn't
[55:43] need bread only but what he needs is
[55:46] every word that proceedeth out of the
[55:48] mouth of god amen i don't need the bread
[55:51] amen to live i live by the word
[55:55] i don't need the bread and then also
[55:57] tell me where you see in the scriptures
[56:00] amen where do you see in the nature of
[56:02] christ and the servants of god where do
[56:05] you see that they take a gift and they
[56:07] use a gift for themselves
[56:09] to ease their suffering to benefit
[56:11] themselves amen brother brahm said his
[56:14] gift wasn't for him he would stand at
[56:16] the pulpit and his stomach would be
[56:17] wrenching and he'd be so sick he could
[56:19] hardly stand and have to grip the pulpit
[56:21] to keep praying for people and he says
[56:23] but the gift wasn't for me it was for
[56:25] you
[56:27] amen and so you see that jesus now
[56:30] is is conducting himself in the nature
[56:33] of the word amen because the nature of
[56:35] the word the servants of god always
[56:38] sacrifice themselves amen for the word
[56:40] and for others they don't ever take a
[56:43] gift of god and use a gift for self
[56:45] vindication or for self pleasure self
[56:49] satisfaction amen self uh preservation
[56:53] or self blessings
[56:55] so when you see a man start taking and
[56:57] using a gift and that gift becomes his
[56:59] vindication amen you see that there's a
[57:02] man there who's insecure about his
[57:04] position in christ because he needs the
[57:06] vindication of a gift to prove
[57:10] his sonship
[57:13] and the devil can twist that insecurity
[57:16] so easily
[57:18] that's what he was trying to do with
[57:20] jesus he first comes to him and he tries
[57:22] to find if there's any insecurity in the
[57:24] sonship because if he finds an
[57:26] insecurity in the sonship he can twist
[57:28] him so easy because what what do we want
[57:31] more than anything in this world i want
[57:33] to be a son of god amen there's
[57:34] something in me that craves to be a son
[57:36] of god i want to please the father i
[57:38] want to be a son of god i want to be
[57:40] connected to him and if there's an
[57:41] insecurity about that the devil will
[57:44] come in and manipulate that insecurity
[57:46] so easily
[57:48] so that was his first attempt with jesus
[57:50] but he found out jesus didn't even care
[57:52] for his own life what he cared for most
[57:54] was every word that proceedeth out of
[57:56] the mouth of god because a son of god
[57:58] wants every word that proceedeth out of
[58:00] the mouth of god
[58:02] it's more than our daily bread it's more
[58:05] than this natural life to us when this
[58:07] natural life is over that word will
[58:08] carry me to the real life amen
[58:11] this one's just a shadow of a shadow of
[58:13] a shadow
[58:20] so he said it is written man shall not
[58:22] live by bread alone but by every word
[58:23] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[58:26] skipping a paragraph he goes on to say
[58:28] so he found out that he had met a little
[58:30] more of a student than he was
[58:33] and so finally taking him on the
[58:35] pinnacle of the temple and out into the
[58:37] mountain
[58:38] and tried to tempt him in every way
[58:40] through the word but jesus would not
[58:42] clown for satan and he doesn't yet
[58:47] you don't have to dance to his music you
[58:49] don't have to respond to his questions
[58:53] listen the devil was always trying to
[58:55] get jesus to move from his position over
[58:58] to the devil's position so he was always
[59:01] coming with goofy questions
[59:04] you know by what authority do you uh why
[59:07] by what authority do you do this in the
[59:08] temple when you turned over he says well
[59:10] i'll ask you a question you answer my
[59:12] question or answer he never felt the
[59:14] need to prove to anybody anything
[59:17] he never got pulled out of his
[59:20] commission of his calling he never had
[59:22] an insecurity that the devil could
[59:24] manipulate to pull him away from his
[59:26] purpose in life he stayed true to that
[59:28] purpose and when they would ask him a
[59:30] question he would just give him an
[59:32] answer or said you know you answer me
[59:34] and i'll answer you and they couldn't
[59:35] answer him and so he said neither will i
[59:37] answer you
[59:39] well i mean what is it that makes us
[59:41] feel the need to answer every goofy
[59:43] question about the message and every
[59:45] doubt and every question somebody has
[59:47] and somebody says well there's no you
[59:49] can't find any birth certificate for
[59:50] brother branham i don't care if you
[59:52] can't find a birth certificate what does
[59:53] that matter to me
[59:55] and i'm not going to go hunting for a
[59:57] birth certificate i'm not going to go
[59:58] through records and try to find one what
[1:00:00] does the birth certificate prove anyways
[1:00:02] amen i'm after the word amen that
[1:00:05] prophet was called of god and ordained
[1:00:08] to restore the word back to the church
[1:00:10] it was the word it was always the word
[1:00:12] it was the headship it was christ that's
[1:00:14] the whole purpose of the message not
[1:00:16] when somebody was born not where they
[1:00:18] lived not how many people fell off a
[1:00:19] bridge not any of those things the whole
[1:00:22] purpose was always christ himself
[1:00:24] returning to the church the fullness of
[1:00:26] the word uniting with the body that's
[1:00:28] always been the message
[1:00:32] if you can't find a birth certificate
[1:00:33] what does it have to do with that
[1:00:36] you see so what's the need to answer the
[1:00:38] silly questions there's no need to end
[1:00:40] they say
[1:00:41] you know
[1:00:43] i can't even think you know you answer
[1:00:44] this question i'll answer your question
[1:00:47] i don't even know what to ask him i just
[1:00:49] said i don't have time sorry
[1:00:51] i can't answer that
[1:00:54] email why
[1:00:56] because i'm enjoying the message
[1:00:59] which is union with my lord
[1:01:02] and the message how can i overcome from
[1:01:04] 63 says when he came to that show off
[1:01:07] with jesus he said get up on the temple
[1:01:09] here and jump off he said it is written
[1:01:11] don't tempt the lord thy god see he met
[1:01:13] him with the word
[1:01:15] and every major assault
[1:01:17] no true servant ever tries to show
[1:01:20] himself off with god's power
[1:01:24] he he if he does he loses right then
[1:01:30] no servant of god
[1:01:33] ever tries to show himself off with
[1:01:35] god's power
[1:01:38] you know
[1:01:40] any gift that we have and any power
[1:01:42] that's been given to us to overcome
[1:01:44] amen it's not our victory it's god's
[1:01:47] victory
[1:01:49] it's not our vindication it's the
[1:01:51] vindication of his word
[1:01:53] it proves that he's faithful to his word
[1:01:55] it doesn't prove anything about us
[1:01:57] because i mean how many people that were
[1:02:00] not predestinated seed of god could
[1:02:02] believe the word of god and receive
[1:02:04] healing in the prayer line of brother
[1:02:05] brennaman and prayer of multitudes of
[1:02:07] other christians and they they're not
[1:02:10] they're not predestined not see genes of
[1:02:12] god they're not children of god at all
[1:02:14] but they can they can believe a promise
[1:02:16] and by that promise amen they can
[1:02:18] receive healing amen that's not their
[1:02:20] vindication that's god's vindication
[1:02:23] that his word is true so god's gifts and
[1:02:26] god operating his gifts by his spirit
[1:02:28] are never our vindication as a people or
[1:02:31] as an individual it's always god's
[1:02:33] vindication that his word is true
[1:02:37] and so when god brings his word to pass
[1:02:39] in you and you somehow get credit for
[1:02:41] that and it becomes a vindication then
[1:02:43] somehow you've added yourself into the
[1:02:46] mix amen and you've gone between god and
[1:02:48] god's manifestation and you're diverting
[1:02:51] some credit away from god unto yourself
[1:02:54] and brother baby said when you do that
[1:02:55] you lose right there
[1:02:57] because as soon as you do that amen the
[1:03:00] devil will find there's a weakness
[1:03:03] that's the spot where i can get him to
[1:03:04] fall
[1:03:09] let's look in matthew chapter 7.
[1:03:22] matthew chapter 7.
[1:03:31] and verse
[1:03:33] 22
[1:03:38] many will say to me in that day lord
[1:03:40] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:03:43] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[1:03:45] in thy name done many wonderful works
[1:03:48] and then will i profess unto them i
[1:03:50] never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:03:52] work iniquity
[1:03:54] so tell me if you can have confidence
[1:03:58] in gifts
[1:04:01] tell me if you have confidence and
[1:04:02] manifestations this group jesus you know
[1:04:05] jesus never denied that they did any of
[1:04:07] this
[1:04:08] and i've said to you before here they
[1:04:10] are at the white throne judgment i don't
[1:04:13] believe anybody is lying to christ at
[1:04:15] the white throne judgment
[1:04:17] i don't think they made this up i don't
[1:04:18] think this is i don't think they're they
[1:04:20] know good and well that they didn't heal
[1:04:22] the sick and they didn't cast out devils
[1:04:24] but they're saying jesus didn't we no
[1:04:25] nobody is trying to pull anything over
[1:04:28] if there's one place there's going to be
[1:04:29] absolute honesty it's going to be at the
[1:04:31] white throne judgment
[1:04:33] and here they are saying lord did we not
[1:04:35] amen cast out devils did we not heal the
[1:04:38] sick did we not do many wonderful works
[1:04:40] in thy name and jesus never denied their
[1:04:43] works and i believe that they did them
[1:04:47] but he said depart from me i never knew
[1:04:49] you ye that work iniquity
[1:04:52] so so you can we we
[1:04:55] jesus never falls for the devil's bait
[1:04:58] these people when they come to jesus
[1:05:00] they had a false security they had a
[1:05:02] false sense of sonship amen because now
[1:05:05] they're they're looking to jesus at the
[1:05:07] white throne judgment and they're saying
[1:05:09] listen hey hey we cast out devils
[1:05:13] i'm your son i mean we're on your side
[1:05:15] uh we cast out devils we healed the sick
[1:05:18] in your name and then your name did many
[1:05:19] wonderful works he said depart from me i
[1:05:22] never knew you
[1:05:24] so you see themselves they thought that
[1:05:26] they were justified they thought that
[1:05:28] they were right amen because they could
[1:05:30] look at a string of works and those
[1:05:32] works were their testimony that they
[1:05:34] were right
[1:05:37] it doesn't work friends so don't take
[1:05:39] the devil's bait
[1:05:40] that's a temptation of the devil to get
[1:05:43] you and i to doubt our position in
[1:05:45] christ and who we are in god's economy
[1:05:48] amen based off whether we can or can't
[1:05:50] or we do or don't or there's a
[1:05:51] manifestation or something works and
[1:05:53] trying to tempt us that way amen we
[1:05:56] shouldn't be tempted that way we should
[1:05:58] have a confidence in who we are by our
[1:06:00] experience with god and the scriptures
[1:06:03] that he's given us and we could go back
[1:06:04] to the scripture and say by his stripes
[1:06:07] i am healed
[1:06:09] the rest is up to him amen at calvary he
[1:06:12] saved me he washed me clean he filled me
[1:06:15] with the spirit the rest is up to him i
[1:06:17] don't have to perform amen to get
[1:06:20] anybody convinced and i certainly don't
[1:06:22] need to convince myself
[1:06:25] see the only reason you need to convince
[1:06:27] somebody else is if there's really a
[1:06:28] need to convince yourself
[1:06:32] but let's go back to the word and say
[1:06:34] god give me a foundation in your word so
[1:06:36] i no longer feel a need to convince
[1:06:38] myself
[1:06:40] so that i'm convinced
[1:06:42] of who i am in you
[1:06:45] by your word
[1:06:49] i want to
[1:06:51] go back to luke chapter 4.
[1:06:55] i want to go to the
[1:06:56] second temptation we're not done but
[1:06:58] we'll come back there's so many things i
[1:07:01] want to say and i'm so afraid that i'm
[1:07:02] going to forget them i'm just asking god
[1:07:04] to bring out what he once brought out
[1:07:08] amen
[1:07:12] matthew chapter 4
[1:07:14] verse 5
[1:07:16] and the devil taking him up on a high
[1:07:18] mountain showed him showed unto him all
[1:07:21] the kingdoms of the world in a moment of
[1:07:23] time
[1:07:24] i want you to catch that wording
[1:07:27] he showed unto him all the kingdoms of
[1:07:30] the world
[1:07:31] in a moment of time
[1:07:33] and the devil said unto him all this
[1:07:35] power will i give thee in the glory of
[1:07:37] them for that is delivered unto me and
[1:07:40] to whomsoever i will give it
[1:07:42] if that if thou therefore will worship
[1:07:44] me
[1:07:45] all shall be thine
[1:07:46] and jesus answered and said unto him get
[1:07:49] thee behind me satan for it is written
[1:07:51] thou shalt worship the lord thy god and
[1:07:53] him only shalt thou serve
[1:07:58] brother bam says this in the second seal
[1:08:01] now listen carefully to what he says
[1:08:03] satan took jesus up to a high mountain
[1:08:05] and he showed him
[1:08:07] all the kingdoms of the world that ever
[1:08:09] was
[1:08:10] or ever would be in a moment of time
[1:08:15] he showed him past
[1:08:18] present and future
[1:08:22] what kind of eyesight was this
[1:08:25] and what kind of mountain was this
[1:08:29] brother branham said in the message
[1:08:30] three witnesses from 1951 when jesus was
[1:08:33] taken up on a high mountain by satan he
[1:08:35] let him look down through the stream of
[1:08:37] time
[1:08:38] and showed him all the world and the
[1:08:40] kingdoms thereof
[1:08:42] and said their mind is that right and
[1:08:44] i'll give them to you if you fall down
[1:08:45] and worship me is that right jesus
[1:08:47] knowed he'd inherit them anyhow he said
[1:08:50] get thee hints satan and then over in
[1:08:53] revelation said rejoice ye heavens and
[1:08:55] ye holy prophets for the kingdoms of
[1:08:57] this world have become the kingdoms of
[1:08:59] our lord and his christ
[1:09:03] in 1953
[1:09:05] he said in the message resurrection he
[1:09:07] says and then he took him upon the
[1:09:08] pinnacle of the temple and then he taken
[1:09:10] him from there upon a mountain and
[1:09:12] here's what shocks
[1:09:13] we people brother i said this is a
[1:09:15] shocking statement here's what shocks me
[1:09:17] people and he showed him all the
[1:09:18] kingdoms of the world in a moment of
[1:09:20] time
[1:09:22] just think of that in other words he
[1:09:24] just opened up and he saw all the
[1:09:27] kingdoms of the world united states
[1:09:32] was the united states around
[1:09:34] in a.d
[1:09:35] 33 or a.d 30
[1:09:40] russia
[1:09:41] great britain
[1:09:42] all of them
[1:09:45] see what what we read these we read
[1:09:48] these stories so much they become common
[1:09:51] but we don't realize that this
[1:09:53] temptation was a supernatural temptation
[1:09:57] you realize if jesus is going to be
[1:09:59] tempted now think about this when god
[1:10:01] was going to have an adversary he had to
[1:10:03] have a worthy adversary so god did not
[1:10:06] create a wimp to be his adversary to
[1:10:08] prove his greatness but god got a worthy
[1:10:10] adversary to show how wonderful he was
[1:10:13] meaning that satan has power satan has
[1:10:16] rights satan has wisdom satan has beauty
[1:10:18] satan has talent satan is loaded down
[1:10:21] with every gift he can be loaded down
[1:10:23] with because god needs a worthy
[1:10:25] adversary
[1:10:26] that's why when we start calling him
[1:10:28] names and start start trashing the devil
[1:10:31] it shows we have absolutely no
[1:10:33] understanding because if god needed a
[1:10:35] worthy adversary to show his greatness
[1:10:37] and all his attributes and we make him a
[1:10:39] puny little wimp that we can stomp on
[1:10:40] and spit on and call nate and he's dumb
[1:10:43] and he's stupid he don't know nothing
[1:10:44] he's ugly and he smells bad
[1:10:46] [Music]
[1:10:49] what kind of worthy adversary is that
[1:10:53] but he was made in beauty and splendor
[1:10:56] and perfection he was given every gift
[1:10:58] that could be given he had the highest
[1:10:59] rank of an angel that an angel could
[1:11:01] have before he fell amen he is deceptive
[1:11:04] he is beautiful he is wise
[1:11:08] he has powers and abilities
[1:11:12] and so now when jesus is coming to a
[1:11:14] temptation it's not the same way amen
[1:11:17] it's not that god's going to give him
[1:11:18] little pretend temptations
[1:11:21] just do this little pretend temptations
[1:11:23] to prove that your son of god we know
[1:11:24] it's all fake and
[1:11:26] we're just going through the motions
[1:11:29] we're playing some sort of game okay uh
[1:11:32] i make the bread i'm not going to make
[1:11:33] it bread
[1:11:35] okay not scene two no this was a real
[1:11:38] temptation
[1:11:40] and when we look at this temptation it
[1:11:42] was supernatural amen it was beyond
[1:11:45] nature amen he was lifted up in matthew
[1:11:48] 4 says in an exceeding high mountain
[1:11:52] and in the exceeding high mountain he
[1:11:55] showed him
[1:11:56] all the kingdoms of the world in a
[1:11:59] moment of time
[1:12:01] like a twinkle of the eye
[1:12:03] listen this is not natural if it is tell
[1:12:06] me which mountain he stood on where he
[1:12:08] could see all the nations at that day
[1:12:12] and all the nations in the past and all
[1:12:15] the nations in the future all the way to
[1:12:16] the united states russia and great
[1:12:18] britain show me where that mountain is
[1:12:20] so we can go stand on it
[1:12:23] it wasn't a natural mountain amen it
[1:12:25] wasn't natural vision but the the second
[1:12:28] deception that he came with
[1:12:32] was vision
[1:12:36] and the supernatural
[1:12:44] listen friends the devil is super
[1:12:47] deceptive
[1:12:50] deceptive
[1:12:52] this was jesus
[1:12:55] conquering
[1:12:57] what eve failed in
[1:13:00] these weren't light trials these weren't
[1:13:02] just little things this was a real
[1:13:05] temptation
[1:13:07] and when
[1:13:08] when
[1:13:10] when satan came to jesus
[1:13:13] to present him
[1:13:15] this
[1:13:16] this
[1:13:17] this uh proposition
[1:13:20] did he come with a
[1:13:22] long tongue hanging on mouth and horns
[1:13:24] and a fork stick
[1:13:26] i wonder this is just me i'm not going
[1:13:28] to give you the answer because i don't
[1:13:29] know the answer but it's a curious
[1:13:31] question in what way was he presented to
[1:13:34] jesus
[1:13:35] and in what form and in what image and
[1:13:38] what did it look like did it look like
[1:13:40] something evil or would it look like
[1:13:41] something good
[1:13:44] because he we know that the satan comes
[1:13:47] as an angel of light
[1:13:49] and he comes to jesus and he takes him
[1:13:52] on an exceeding high mountain and listen
[1:13:55] this was not everest
[1:13:58] mount everest is supposed to be i think
[1:14:00] that if i'm not
[1:14:01] i'm not good in school and geography but
[1:14:03] i think everest is the highest peak in
[1:14:05] the world
[1:14:06] is that right does anybody know
[1:14:07] geography
[1:14:09] this wasn't mount everest
[1:14:11] this was another kind of exceedingly
[1:14:13] high mouth this was taking place in the
[1:14:15] spiritual realm friends this was a
[1:14:17] spiritual trial these were spiritual
[1:14:19] supernatural vision and things that were
[1:14:22] taking place jesus was carried in a
[1:14:25] vision supernaturally and to an
[1:14:27] exceeding high mountain and on this
[1:14:29] mountain in a moment of time he could
[1:14:31] see every nation that has been that is
[1:14:34] and that will be all the way down to now
[1:14:36] and he was offered the power of them and
[1:14:38] the glory of all of them if he would
[1:14:40] worship this being that was able to show
[1:14:42] him all of that
[1:14:44] [Music]
[1:14:47] see
[1:14:50] this is what began to strike me so deep
[1:14:52] when i was doing my devotions i've read
[1:14:54] the story and read this story and read
[1:14:56] the story and did not realize the impact
[1:14:58] of what i was reading
[1:15:00] how deep this deception was
[1:15:03] how supernatural and spiritual it was
[1:15:05] how good it would have looked how how he
[1:15:08] would have been lifted up into vision
[1:15:10] and listen
[1:15:11] no doubt jesus had seen visions before
[1:15:13] this and my question is would this
[1:15:15] vision be much different than the
[1:15:17] visions he'd seen before or would it be
[1:15:19] similar
[1:15:20] because does the devil do things
[1:15:22] completely different or does he copy
[1:15:27] all right so the devil copies what god
[1:15:30] does
[1:15:31] and if god could show jesus a vision and
[1:15:34] carry him away supernaturally now the
[1:15:36] devil is doing the same thing the father
[1:15:39] has done
[1:15:41] now satan is carrying him away in a
[1:15:44] vision to an exceeding high mountain and
[1:15:46] listen i want you to think differently
[1:15:48] about mountain and not think physical
[1:15:50] because mountain in the bible many times
[1:15:52] represents a kingdom or a nation
[1:15:54] when jesus casts saying out he cast him
[1:15:56] out of his holy mountain
[1:15:58] amen when the stone was cut out of the
[1:16:00] mountain without hands it comes down and
[1:16:02] smote in the feet the image and it grew
[1:16:04] into a great mountain that filled all
[1:16:06] the earth that is not a natural mountain
[1:16:08] that is the kingdom of christ
[1:16:11] so an exceedingly high mountain amen he
[1:16:15] took him out the devil took him into an
[1:16:17] exceeding high mountain and showed him
[1:16:19] all the kingdoms of the world and saved
[1:16:21] their mind this is just my personal
[1:16:23] belief amen that he jesus or satan took
[1:16:26] jesus up amen to the supernatural
[1:16:29] dominion of satan that he has over every
[1:16:32] nation and over all the earth because
[1:16:34] satan has a kingdom this is satan's
[1:16:36] kingdom this is satan's eden
[1:16:39] and he took him to an exceeding high
[1:16:41] mountain means this mountain is over
[1:16:44] every other mountain
[1:16:46] so he took him to the pinnacle of his
[1:16:48] kingdom amen to the top amen and he
[1:16:51] showed him in a moment of time past
[1:16:53] present future all the power and all the
[1:16:55] glory of all of these natures that this
[1:16:58] was a supernatural
[1:17:00] i would say it this way
[1:17:02] mimicking
[1:17:04] supernatural vision supernatural
[1:17:07] experience that the devil gave jesus
[1:17:09] christ
[1:17:12] i hope you don't feel like that's too
[1:17:14] far out on the limb
[1:17:15] because that's exactly what happened
[1:17:18] that's why friends when this word came
[1:17:20] we've got to stick with this word
[1:17:23] because god can give vision and
[1:17:25] supernatural experience and satan can
[1:17:27] give vision and supernatural experience
[1:17:29] how will you know the difference if we
[1:17:31] don't have the true interpretation of
[1:17:33] the word
[1:17:33] [Applause]
[1:17:35] tell me any false system false move
[1:17:38] false doctrine that doesn't have
[1:17:39] supernatural that goes along with it
[1:17:41] that they claim is a vindication
[1:17:45] i mean you take any of the religions of
[1:17:47] the world you take any of the
[1:17:49] denominations that started out hey
[1:17:51] listen you you know
[1:17:54] it's got to be appealing friends it's
[1:17:56] got to be a copycat amen you can't trick
[1:17:59] somebody amen with counterfeit money
[1:18:01] that doesn't look anything like the
[1:18:02] money you're trying to replace it with
[1:18:04] but if you want to have good counterfeit
[1:18:06] you've got to get it as close to the
[1:18:07] original as possible without being the
[1:18:09] original and listen the devil has got
[1:18:12] counterfeit gifts he's got counterfeit
[1:18:14] vision he's got brother man said
[1:18:15] counterfeit
[1:18:17] he he said devils can drink blood out of
[1:18:20] a human skull and speak in tongues and
[1:18:21] interpret it
[1:18:24] that doesn't mean god can't
[1:18:27] god's the original
[1:18:29] there's an original tongue's an original
[1:18:31] vision an original supernatural an
[1:18:33] original laying on it there's original
[1:18:34] of everything
[1:18:36] but the devil he brings counterfeits and
[1:18:39] the counterfeits are for deception so if
[1:18:42] it's deception it's got to be so close
[1:18:44] that it could deceive the elect if it
[1:18:46] was possible
[1:18:50] oh praise be to god
[1:18:53] this temptation in the wilderness that
[1:18:55] jesus overcome was far more than what i
[1:18:57] thought it was all my life
[1:18:59] all my life i've read it like like
[1:19:03] i don't know a children's story out of a
[1:19:04] sunday school coloring book
[1:19:07] satan said make these stones bread i
[1:19:09] will not
[1:19:13] you know my image was very childish very
[1:19:16] immature amen and take him up i don't
[1:19:19] even know what i used to think about an
[1:19:20] exceeding high mountain seeing all the
[1:19:21] kingdoms of the world i don't even know
[1:19:23] what i used to think about it but i tell
[1:19:24] you what i used to think is not what i
[1:19:26] understand now
[1:19:28] that if that had happened to you you
[1:19:30] would have a very difficult time knowing
[1:19:32] is this god or is this the devil i mean
[1:19:33] what is going on here amen i mean i i've
[1:19:36] been given a supernatural experience
[1:19:38] where i've been carried out of the
[1:19:40] natural world up into exceeding high
[1:19:42] mountain into a supernatural realm and
[1:19:44] i've been given vision in a moment of
[1:19:45] time to see every nation the glory and
[1:19:47] the power of that nation from the
[1:19:49] beginning of time all the way to the end
[1:19:51] of time amen you would have a very
[1:19:53] difficult time knowing whether that was
[1:19:55] the devil or if that was god
[1:19:59] and jesus had to first face that to
[1:20:02] overcome that to reverse what was done
[1:20:05] in the fall
[1:20:06] and how did he overcome it he overcame
[1:20:09] it by the word friends
[1:20:14] there was listen
[1:20:16] if i could just put it into my own words
[1:20:18] and just this is my own words
[1:20:21] but there was just something just wasn't
[1:20:23] right about it
[1:20:27] it didn't have that ring to it
[1:20:32] there is something i mean it looked good
[1:20:37] it looked right
[1:20:39] and what was he showing him he was
[1:20:41] showing him what he was predestinated to
[1:20:44] listen the devil was not showing him
[1:20:47] something that he didn't have a right to
[1:20:48] the devil was not showing him something
[1:20:50] that was not his inheritance he was not
[1:20:52] showing something that didn't already
[1:20:53] belong to him
[1:20:55] it's not like he was trying to convince
[1:20:57] jesus to do something that was way out
[1:21:00] in left field jesus was born to be the
[1:21:03] son of david to rule all the nations of
[1:21:06] the world and to have all their glory
[1:21:07] and honor and power directed towards him
[1:21:10] that's what will be in the millennium
[1:21:13] so the devil was not
[1:21:15] oh i could say the devil was not way out
[1:21:19] in left field with this the devil was
[1:21:20] coming right down the word line
[1:21:23] he was coming right down the promise
[1:21:26] right down the inheritance he was coming
[1:21:28] right down it looked like he was right
[1:21:30] down the middle with this but there was
[1:21:31] just a little curve to that ball because
[1:21:34] it wasn't the nature of the word it was
[1:21:37] the word it was the destination this was
[1:21:40] the right person but it wasn't right
[1:21:43] because because jesus was not destined
[1:21:45] to have anything without first paying
[1:21:47] the price for it there had to be
[1:21:49] redemption there had to be
[1:21:50] reconciliation there had to be suffering
[1:21:52] amen so that he could have all of that
[1:21:55] and all of us with him when he had that
[1:21:58] so it was it would look good it was
[1:22:01] right in so many ways
[1:22:05] but he was trying to offer him the
[1:22:06] kingdom with no suffering
[1:22:11] and brother branham said jesus was or
[1:22:13] satan was content to let him have it
[1:22:17] because if jesus would have taken what
[1:22:20] was right what he had a right to what he
[1:22:22] was predestinated for what was his
[1:22:24] inheritance
[1:22:26] if he would have taken it before his
[1:22:28] time
[1:22:29] he would have disrupted the whole plan
[1:22:31] of god
[1:22:33] so although it was the word
[1:22:35] you had to know the rest of the word to
[1:22:38] know if this was the correct timing for
[1:22:40] this word
[1:22:42] it wasn't that it wasn't the word it
[1:22:44] wasn't that it wasn't supernatural it
[1:22:46] wasn't that it didn't look good but it
[1:22:48] didn't fit the whole plan of god you
[1:22:51] have to know the whole mind of god to
[1:22:53] know if this fits or not
[1:22:58] so
[1:22:59] so
[1:23:02] jesus is looking at this and
[1:23:04] this is just brother chad again
[1:23:06] it just doesn't have that certain ring
[1:23:10] there's just something
[1:23:11] odd about this
[1:23:14] and
[1:23:15] i don't know
[1:23:17] if he thought of other scriptures i
[1:23:18] don't know what came into his mind
[1:23:20] but here's what brother brenham said and
[1:23:22] how can i overcome
[1:23:25] the third great assault satan offered to
[1:23:27] forfeit this kingdom to him he did satan
[1:23:29] said these
[1:23:31] see these kingdoms of the world these
[1:23:33] are mine i do with them whatever i want
[1:23:35] to i'll forfeit them to you
[1:23:37] but remember he was trying to get him to
[1:23:39] forfeit it without the cross
[1:23:42] if he did
[1:23:43] we'd be lost
[1:23:46] so why was the devil so content to give
[1:23:48] jesus his kingdom and his right to rule
[1:23:51] because if he gave it to jesus and jesus
[1:23:53] took it and the rest of the attributes
[1:23:55] of god would be lost and no redemption
[1:23:57] then the devil would have the ultimate
[1:23:59] victory because god would then be lost
[1:24:03] because if the attributes of god are
[1:24:05] lost god is lost the word has failed
[1:24:07] satan becomes ultimate victor over all
[1:24:10] of the creation of god
[1:24:12] he was content
[1:24:14] and listen don't forget this
[1:24:16] the person who gives you something is
[1:24:18] the one who has more power than you
[1:24:21] that's why he said i'll give this to you
[1:24:23] if you worship me because that's the way
[1:24:24] it has to work amen the one who gives it
[1:24:27] to you has more power than you the one
[1:24:29] who gives you something becomes your
[1:24:31] head
[1:24:34] and i don't know how long jesus thought
[1:24:36] about this i don't know what scriptures
[1:24:38] went through in mind i don't know
[1:24:39] anything really
[1:24:42] but
[1:24:43] there are things that that are just
[1:24:44] interesting to think about
[1:24:47] he said he was trying to get him to
[1:24:48] forfeit without the cross if he did we'd
[1:24:50] be lost he could have took the kingdom
[1:24:53] but he must come
[1:24:54] but but he must come back he i'm sorry
[1:24:57] yeah he could have took the kingdom but
[1:24:59] he must come back he must he was tempted
[1:25:02] to do it now
[1:25:03] is that what brother ben said he was
[1:25:05] tempted to do it listen this test
[1:25:07] doesn't mean anything like if you want
[1:25:09] to give me an entrance exam to
[1:25:11] university don't put on the test one
[1:25:14] plus one equals
[1:25:17] this is the entrance exam to harvard
[1:25:20] find the noun in this sentence
[1:25:26] know
[1:25:27] you know
[1:25:28] what state is columbus in
[1:25:34] that's not the kind of test jesus went
[1:25:36] through
[1:25:38] brother bram said he was tempted to do
[1:25:40] it
[1:25:41] listen he was in a human body that felt
[1:25:43] every pain that you feel that feel heat
[1:25:46] feels cold feels hunger feels headache
[1:25:48] feels everything that you feel he felt
[1:25:50] in that body and when he went 40 days
[1:25:52] with no food he was afterward or
[1:25:53] hungered he was hungry after 40 days of
[1:25:55] no food
[1:25:56] and when the devil said turn the stone
[1:25:58] into bread and he had the power to do it
[1:26:00] don't think there was no temptation
[1:26:02] there this was the temptation
[1:26:05] and brother branham said when it comes
[1:26:06] to these kingdoms he said he was tempted
[1:26:09] to do it
[1:26:12] think about the reasoning listen the
[1:26:14] devil is a master of reasoning
[1:26:16] if you're the king of all the world then
[1:26:18] you set the laws you can make the whole
[1:26:20] world follow god's word you can bring
[1:26:22] all of this to line with god's word
[1:26:25] and he could have
[1:26:28] he could have begun ruling with a rotten
[1:26:29] iron rod of iron right then
[1:26:33] but if he had there would be no
[1:26:34] redemption for the elect seat of god
[1:26:37] there would be no reconciliation of what
[1:26:39] had fallen before amen it would just be
[1:26:42] him ruling with a rod of iron but his
[1:26:44] brethren would be lost the rest of the
[1:26:45] attributes the family of god would
[1:26:47] remain lost
[1:26:48] and brother branham said
[1:26:50] he was tempted to do it
[1:26:54] i believe brother brandon
[1:26:58] death is a hard thing he was tempted to
[1:27:00] take his liberty and be the king of the
[1:27:03] earth without the cross jesus was
[1:27:06] literally tempted
[1:27:10] now listen you say wow what if it
[1:27:13] happened to you
[1:27:15] what if you are lifted up into a
[1:27:19] supernatural realm and placed on an
[1:27:20] exceeding high mount what did that
[1:27:22] kingdom look like what all they see we
[1:27:24] don't know but in a moment time you see
[1:27:26] past present future glory power all of
[1:27:29] it and it's all handed to you and you
[1:27:31] could be the king of it all amen don't
[1:27:33] think that you wouldn't be tempted amen
[1:27:36] jesus was tempted
[1:27:38] the bible says he was tempted in every
[1:27:40] way like we are
[1:27:42] that's what makes him a faithful high
[1:27:43] priest
[1:27:45] he was tempted to take his liberty and
[1:27:47] be the king of the earth without the
[1:27:48] cross
[1:27:49] but if he did his subjects would have
[1:27:51] died
[1:27:52] satan would have gladly made that
[1:27:53] proposition with him but he said get
[1:27:55] thee behind me satan
[1:27:57] he didn't do it he came and suffered and
[1:27:59] took the hard rugged route he took the
[1:28:01] route of persecution he took the route
[1:28:03] of death
[1:28:04] are we this morning willing to do to
[1:28:07] take the same route that he has taken
[1:28:11] are we willing to die are we willing to
[1:28:13] give ourselves up to god forfeit all the
[1:28:15] world and the things to serve him see
[1:28:18] now he failed to do it willingly to
[1:28:20] forfeit it satan was
[1:28:22] to him but he didn't he didn't do it
[1:28:25] though jesus was tempted he overcame for
[1:28:29] us
[1:28:30] although he was tempted he overcame why
[1:28:32] did he overcame he overcame so you could
[1:28:35] be redeemed
[1:28:38] he overcame for us he endured all
[1:28:40] temptations for me and for you he could
[1:28:42] have took it right then but what did he
[1:28:44] take the other route for so that we
[1:28:46] could come be with him and if he paid
[1:28:49] such a price as that then how little
[1:28:52] would we be not to take it when remember
[1:28:55] there's nothing here anyhow
[1:28:58] so now jesus was tempted but he took the
[1:29:01] route now listen
[1:29:03] let's just bring this down home amen how
[1:29:05] many times oh my goodness how many times
[1:29:08] are we tempted to do something that's a
[1:29:10] little deviation from the word and from
[1:29:12] the plan of god but it's not something
[1:29:14] that's completely wrong
[1:29:17] amen well you know what about what about
[1:29:20] uh
[1:29:21] i don't know even i don't what about
[1:29:23] taking a job amen and taking that job
[1:29:26] moves you away from fellowship or takes
[1:29:27] you away amen from church or takes your
[1:29:30] family away and you say but you know
[1:29:32] i've got to support my family it looks
[1:29:34] like god gives this to me but you know
[1:29:36] the word says don't forsake the
[1:29:37] assembling together of yourselves you
[1:29:39] know that that is the word and it
[1:29:41] doesn't mean that you never never have
[1:29:43] to work a job never miss a service i'm
[1:29:44] not talking about that but i'm just
[1:29:45] talking about a principle brother ben
[1:29:47] brought this out and i thought it was so
[1:29:48] good the principle of it not the law but
[1:29:50] the principle
[1:29:52] you can take in a relationship you know
[1:29:54] this relationship is forbidden by god
[1:29:56] the prophet speaks against it amen but
[1:29:58] what you can do is then you can start
[1:30:00] praying about it
[1:30:04] and don't think the devil can't give you
[1:30:06] supernatural experiences to tell you
[1:30:08] that that's okay
[1:30:10] don't you think that circumstances won't
[1:30:12] start lining up or you'll have a dream
[1:30:14] as a confirmation or somebody will call
[1:30:17] you up and say you know i was thinking
[1:30:18] about so-and-so or all right have you
[1:30:20] ever thought of employment over here
[1:30:21] don't you think that the devil cannot
[1:30:24] work in the supernatural and you think
[1:30:26] it's god giving you the permission to go
[1:30:29] against his scriptures
[1:30:31] because it was supernatural but because
[1:30:34] it was supernatural is no right to go
[1:30:36] against the word of god
[1:30:40] so we can look at jesus temptation but
[1:30:42] what about our temptation
[1:30:44] what about the things that come to us
[1:30:46] what about when we know good and well
[1:30:48] the prophet taught this the word of god
[1:30:50] is against it the scripture says but you
[1:30:52] know what i'm going to go to prayer
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:56] why if you go to prayer you better be
[1:30:58] praying that god gets that desire out of
[1:31:00] your heart so your desire matches his
[1:31:02] word don't go to prayer to ask god for
[1:31:05] permission to do something his word
[1:31:06] forbids
[1:31:11] listen i mean this works in all kinds of
[1:31:13] circumstances
[1:31:15] i mean
[1:31:17] i mean if you want to leave one job to
[1:31:18] go to another but god hasn't given you
[1:31:20] permission to leave that job it's not
[1:31:22] wrong to leave a job to go to another
[1:31:24] that's not sin
[1:31:26] but we want to be led by the spirit we
[1:31:28] want to be led of god we want to ask god
[1:31:29] god do you want me to leave this job and
[1:31:31] go to this other
[1:31:33] and you can pray about that until you
[1:31:36] get supernatural signs
[1:31:40] and what is it
[1:31:42] really
[1:31:43] you'll pray until something matches your
[1:31:45] own desire
[1:31:48] that's why brother branham said you have
[1:31:50] to first get neutral
[1:31:53] when you go to pray
[1:31:56] there are things that are forbidden
[1:31:58] there's things that there's decisions we
[1:32:00] make we just need god's leadership and i
[1:32:02] understand that but we have to first get
[1:32:04] neutral
[1:32:06] and that's a hard thing to do
[1:32:09] i mean i it's gonna probably take a lot
[1:32:11] of prayer to get neutral
[1:32:14] and then let god lead either way but
[1:32:16] there are some things that are
[1:32:17] specifically forbidden
[1:32:20] preached against by the prophet spoke
[1:32:22] against in the word
[1:32:24] but because we still desire it we'll
[1:32:27] begin to pray for it
[1:32:30] and then when and i've seen it so much
[1:32:33] till it's just so odd to me somebody
[1:32:35] will say you know i was praying about
[1:32:36] that and you know i i wanted to do this
[1:32:40] or that and all of a sudden i looked up
[1:32:42] on a billboard i saw a word and that
[1:32:43] word was in the title of the company i
[1:32:45] want to go work for and i said that's a
[1:32:47] sign
[1:32:50] what it was is an expression of your
[1:32:52] desire you wanted it to come to pass so
[1:32:56] you looked for anything that would give
[1:32:58] you a vindication for it to come to pass
[1:33:00] and then you said it's of the lord but
[1:33:02] don't think the devil doesn't know that
[1:33:04] too and the devil can work
[1:33:05] supernaturally he can anoint people to
[1:33:08] say things to you he can anoint people
[1:33:09] to call you amen
[1:33:11] he can he can give all kinds of
[1:33:12] supernatural experiences and you say oh
[1:33:15] it's the lord it's the lord if it
[1:33:17] matches the word
[1:33:20] but i'm going to say something more than
[1:33:22] that
[1:33:25] it's the word it's the lord if it
[1:33:27] matches the nature of the word
[1:33:30] i'm going to get into that next
[1:33:35] so
[1:33:36] praise god
[1:33:38] let's go back to luke chapter 4.
[1:33:40] i want to go ahead and get into this
[1:33:50] luke chapter 4
[1:33:54] verse 9
[1:33:56] and he brought him to jerusalem and set
[1:33:58] him on the pinnacle of a temple and said
[1:34:00] unto him
[1:34:01] if thou be the son of god cast thyself
[1:34:03] down from hence
[1:34:05] for it is written he shall give his
[1:34:07] angels charge over thee to keep thee
[1:34:10] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[1:34:12] up lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[1:34:14] against the stone
[1:34:15] and jesus answered and said unto him it
[1:34:18] is said thou shalt not tempt the lord
[1:34:20] thy god
[1:34:23] look at verse 9 and he brought him up to
[1:34:25] jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of
[1:34:28] the temple
[1:34:30] what did that journey look like
[1:34:33] were they walking through the wilderness
[1:34:34] and then they had to get you know a
[1:34:36] couple days journey to get jerusalem
[1:34:38] when they got to jerusalem they get some
[1:34:39] ladders out and start climbing up the
[1:34:40] pinnacle and the devil's dragging him up
[1:34:42] on the next next ladder you know he's
[1:34:44] pushing jesus up okay get on to the next
[1:34:49] these are supernatural temptations
[1:34:52] they have supernatural elements to them
[1:34:55] they have things that human beings can't
[1:34:57] do themselves
[1:34:59] attached to them
[1:35:01] he brought him up he he took him to
[1:35:03] jerusalem hey listen
[1:35:05] this was not just in the spirit
[1:35:09] because he said cast yourself down his
[1:35:11] flesh had to be there
[1:35:13] how did he carry him i don't know but
[1:35:16] maybe he could copy a mechanism of god
[1:35:18] where he could carry philip away
[1:35:21] and philip could show up miles away i
[1:35:23] don't know how he did it but the devil
[1:35:25] is a copycat of god
[1:35:27] and we know philip disappeared after
[1:35:29] baptizing the ethiopian eunuch and he
[1:35:31] found himself over far away in joppa
[1:35:34] and now all of a sudden they're in the
[1:35:36] wilderness being tempted and he carries
[1:35:38] him to jerusalem and sets him on the
[1:35:40] pinnacle of the temple this cannot be
[1:35:42] this is just me but i don't believe it
[1:35:43] could be just spiritual because he said
[1:35:45] cast thyself down amen so you don't dash
[1:35:48] your foot so your body is not injured
[1:35:50] there's a promise that angels will
[1:35:52] protect your physical body from injury
[1:35:54] it had to be his physical body on the
[1:35:56] physical pinnacle in physical jerusalem
[1:35:59] how did he get him there
[1:36:02] what a temptation what if you found
[1:36:04] yourself on top chase tower
[1:36:07] you're at home you're eating cereal
[1:36:11] you're standing there on top of
[1:36:13] the tallest building in lima
[1:36:17] and somebody's quoting scriptures to you
[1:36:26] doing something a human being can't do
[1:36:32] i shall say it this way the devil is
[1:36:34] super deceptive
[1:36:43] let's go to
[1:36:44] hold your place in luke 4 but let's go
[1:36:46] to psalms 91.
[1:37:02] psalms 91
[1:37:04] 11.
[1:37:09] for he shall give his angels charge over
[1:37:11] thee
[1:37:12] to keep thee in all thy ways
[1:37:14] they shall bear thee up in their hands
[1:37:16] lest thou dash thy foot against the
[1:37:18] stone
[1:37:21] did the devil quote a true scripture
[1:37:24] did he quote it correctly
[1:37:26] and was he speaking about the right
[1:37:28] person
[1:37:32] the devil is super i just want to say i
[1:37:35] hope you catch this he is super
[1:37:37] deceptive
[1:37:40] so much so that he could deceive the
[1:37:42] very elect if it were possible
[1:37:45] this is why the message had to come to
[1:37:47] break that power of deception
[1:37:50] that is exactly why we cannot play games
[1:37:52] with the message
[1:37:54] we cannot alter it to our liking we
[1:37:56] cannot change what the prophet taught we
[1:37:57] cannot change what he said we cannot
[1:37:59] change the scriptures he used if you do
[1:38:02] you're going to fall by deception of the
[1:38:04] devil because he is super deceptive
[1:38:07] and i'm going to look at the third
[1:38:09] deception
[1:38:10] that he uses
[1:38:19] the third deception that the devil uses
[1:38:21] an indentation of scripture
[1:38:24] so when it comes to you the devil can
[1:38:26] use
[1:38:28] your position in christ as a temptation
[1:38:32] vision and supernatural experiences
[1:38:34] and the scripture
[1:38:36] all to get you off of the word
[1:38:39] now listen
[1:38:41] how are you going to do that yourself
[1:38:44] you've got to have the baptism the holy
[1:38:46] ghost and you've got to walk in the
[1:38:47] spirit
[1:38:48] listen i hope after this morning's
[1:38:50] message more than anything in your life
[1:38:52] you'll cry out for god to fill you with
[1:38:54] his spirit and keep you walking with the
[1:38:56] spirit because there is no way to
[1:38:57] overcome these kinds of deceptions with
[1:38:59] our own mind and our own strength and
[1:39:01] our own will we will fall prey to them
[1:39:03] every single time amen but god has sent
[1:39:06] something in this age that has never
[1:39:08] been in any previous age and it's here
[1:39:10] to give the bride victory if she'll just
[1:39:12] rely on it believe in it stand by it
[1:39:15] walk in it amen be filled with the
[1:39:17] spirit walk in the spirit and stay with
[1:39:19] this word
[1:39:24] brother branham said
[1:39:26] in victory day
[1:39:27] should he come to the day that satan
[1:39:29] took him up on a mountain and he showed
[1:39:31] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[1:39:32] said i'll make you a king now you say
[1:39:34] you're the son of god and you got power
[1:39:36] i'll give you i'll give you the ruler of
[1:39:38] all nations just what the antichrist is
[1:39:40] trying to do to be today but there was a
[1:39:42] v-day he found right through it said if
[1:39:44] thou be the son of god
[1:39:47] there come a time when he was challenged
[1:39:48] by the word if thou be the son of god
[1:39:50] command these stones to be made bread
[1:39:52] see and you're hungry now eat them see
[1:39:54] if you're the son of god you can do it
[1:39:56] he could have that's right but there had
[1:39:58] to be a v-day he won the victory over
[1:40:01] that temptation
[1:40:02] he said now you can be a great person
[1:40:04] you can show yourself what you are took
[1:40:07] him the pinnacle of the temple said drop
[1:40:08] off i'll quote the scripture to you it's
[1:40:10] written
[1:40:12] he'll give the angels charge over thee
[1:40:13] lest at any time and i dash thy foot
[1:40:15] against the stone and bear thee up look
[1:40:17] at that theologian that satan is
[1:40:23] see
[1:40:24] get thee behind me satan came the word
[1:40:26] it was v day he come to every
[1:40:30] v day
[1:40:32] in 1950 he said believe us down this say
[1:40:34] remember jesus had all the qualities of
[1:40:36] the father in him do you believe that
[1:40:38] sure he did all the fine gifts of god
[1:40:40] was in in christ his son for he was the
[1:40:43] offspring of god but notice when he met
[1:40:45] satan for your example he never used any
[1:40:48] gift on him when satan come to him he
[1:40:50] said it is written man shall not live by
[1:40:52] bread alone but by every word proceedeth
[1:40:54] out of the mouth of god satan caught him
[1:40:57] again upon the pinnacle of temple jesus
[1:40:58] said it is written and he took him up to
[1:41:00] the top of the mountain and jesus said
[1:41:02] it is written see it is written
[1:41:04] that was the victory it is written
[1:41:09] you know
[1:41:10] brother branham tells us
[1:41:12] brother brown tells us about
[1:41:15] the showdown amen in israel when ahab
[1:41:18] and jehoshaphat were going to go up
[1:41:19] together the war and there was all the
[1:41:21] prophets of ahab and they began to
[1:41:22] prophesy and they give a prophecy and
[1:41:24] they all consented to the prophecy but
[1:41:26] but uh
[1:41:28] jehoshaphat asked for another prophet
[1:41:30] and they got makaya and mekiah got the
[1:41:32] true word of the lord and he came down
[1:41:34] amen and he gave him the true word of
[1:41:36] the lord and listen
[1:41:38] zedekiah the head of that the
[1:41:40] ministerial association the head of
[1:41:41] those prophets he looked at him he said
[1:41:44] where went the spirit of god when it
[1:41:45] went out for me
[1:41:47] listen zedekiah had received a spirit
[1:41:52] it was a lying spirit
[1:41:54] and god permitted it to come down
[1:41:58] he asked
[1:41:59] micaiah saw on a vision he said there
[1:42:01] was a a conference in heaven and and and
[1:42:04] god was saying how can i bring my word
[1:42:06] to pass brother branham dramatizes and
[1:42:07] shows us he said how how can i bring my
[1:42:10] word to pass and a lying spirit said i
[1:42:11] can go down and be a lying spirit in the
[1:42:13] mouth of his prophets
[1:42:14] and god said that'll work you go
[1:42:17] and so listen
[1:42:19] zedekiah and those prophets received a
[1:42:22] spirit and a supernatural experience
[1:42:27] and that spirit and that supernatural
[1:42:29] experience
[1:42:31] was a confirmation of a scripture that
[1:42:33] came from moses
[1:42:36] that this section of the land that the
[1:42:38] syrians had taken away belonged to them
[1:42:41] they had scripture for it
[1:42:44] and they had a supernatural experience
[1:42:46] to go with it
[1:42:52] but micaiah
[1:42:56] uh i'm going to make a statement but
[1:42:58] just listen to what i'm saying and don't
[1:43:00] misinterpret it
[1:43:02] macayah
[1:43:04] so those the lying spirit used the
[1:43:07] scripture
[1:43:09] and a supernatural experience
[1:43:12] mikaya used the word
[1:43:16] you can have the scripture without the
[1:43:18] word
[1:43:20] but you can't have the word without the
[1:43:22] scripture
[1:43:25] many times the scripture has been used
[1:43:28] to get people to move away from the word
[1:43:31] it's a misuse of the scripture to get
[1:43:33] people to leave the word amen they had
[1:43:35] the scripture and makaya had the word
[1:43:38] because he was looking back to the
[1:43:40] previous prophet that was before and
[1:43:42] that prophet put a curse upon them and
[1:43:44] said this is going to be a curse and the
[1:43:46] vision that mackay had matched the word
[1:43:51] which also matched the scripture that
[1:43:53] moses gave because they're looking at
[1:43:55] one scripture but but uh elijah when he
[1:43:58] put a curse on ahab was referring to
[1:44:00] another scripture that as long as you
[1:44:03] keep my commandments i'll keep you in
[1:44:05] the land but when you forsake me you'll
[1:44:07] lose the land amen and so they were
[1:44:10] looking at a scripture here you have two
[1:44:12] scriptures
[1:44:14] both of them true scriptures both of
[1:44:17] them come from moses
[1:44:19] but the true prophet gets the right
[1:44:21] application of the word for the season
[1:44:24] that they are in and mekiah checks his
[1:44:26] vision with the prophet of that day
[1:44:28] because the prophet of the day has the
[1:44:30] right application for the word for that
[1:44:32] season
[1:44:36] zedekiah in them had the word but it was
[1:44:38] out of season
[1:44:41] wrong application of the word
[1:44:45] here's what brother branham
[1:44:46] said about micaiah in them
[1:44:51] he said let me tell you something god
[1:44:52] has a purpose for everything stay with
[1:44:54] the word what the bible says stay with
[1:44:55] it it's god's urm and thumb
[1:44:58] and old micaiah the prophet stayed on
[1:45:00] the word of god walked down there just
[1:45:02] as boldly as a lion
[1:45:04] that night the lord gave him a vision he
[1:45:05] knowed where he was standing and watch
[1:45:07] oh brother the others had a vision too
[1:45:12] brother brown said the others had a
[1:45:14] vision to yeah they had received a
[1:45:15] spirit
[1:45:17] and where did this where did the spirit
[1:45:18] come from from the presence of the lord
[1:45:21] was that spirit in the presence of the
[1:45:23] lord
[1:45:24] that the lord telling me it could go
[1:45:26] there was a spirit that came from the
[1:45:27] presence of the lord it wasn't the
[1:45:28] spirit of the lord
[1:45:31] but that spirit came down to them and
[1:45:34] they had a vision
[1:45:36] and they they had scripture
[1:45:40] the others had a vision too but their
[1:45:42] vision didn't compare with the word of
[1:45:44] god
[1:45:46] but they had scripture but it wasn't the
[1:45:48] word
[1:45:50] oh i hope you catch that
[1:45:52] i mean everybody claims to be a bible
[1:45:54] believing church
[1:45:56] this is the bible believing church this
[1:45:58] is a bible believing church this is a
[1:45:59] bible believing church when they preach
[1:46:01] when ministers stand up and
[1:46:02] denominations and sex and and cults and
[1:46:05] everything all over the world they'll
[1:46:06] read to you scriptures amen but just
[1:46:08] because you read scriptures doesn't mean
[1:46:10] you have the word amen in order to have
[1:46:12] the word you have to have the right
[1:46:13] application of those scriptures in its
[1:46:15] season
[1:46:16] and how will you get that without a
[1:46:18] vindicated prophet in your day to bring
[1:46:20] the right application of the scriptures
[1:46:22] and it sees it and when you have that
[1:46:24] you have the word when you have the word
[1:46:26] you have the mind of god amen
[1:46:30] so zedekiah had a spirit and vision and
[1:46:34] scriptures mecha had a spirit and vision
[1:46:38] and scriptures
[1:46:40] the difference was the prophet for that
[1:46:43] age had brought the right application of
[1:46:44] the word and the vision and the
[1:46:46] scriptures macau had matched that
[1:46:48] prophet's ministry
[1:46:53] he says the others had a vision too but
[1:46:54] their vision didn't compare with the
[1:46:56] word of god but micaiah's was with the
[1:46:58] word of god because elijah which had the
[1:47:00] word of god the prophet the seer had
[1:47:03] already said what would happen to ahab
[1:47:05] so how could mackay say something good
[1:47:07] was going to happen when the word of god
[1:47:09] said bad was going to happen
[1:47:11] see he was with the word
[1:47:17] oh praise god
[1:47:19] brother brahma also says in absolute he
[1:47:21] had a vision they had a vision too but
[1:47:24] the vision didn't compare with the word
[1:47:27] and the message won this from 1962
[1:47:30] he says satan took him up there and said
[1:47:32] it's written just like he said to eve it
[1:47:34] is written it is written jesus said it
[1:47:36] is also written it's written he'll give
[1:47:38] his angels charged over thee the bible
[1:47:40] said see boy he's a scholar who's he
[1:47:43] talking about he's talking about the
[1:47:45] devil
[1:47:47] boy he's a scholar it's written he'll
[1:47:48] give his angels charged concerning thee
[1:47:50] lest thou dash thy foot against the
[1:47:51] stone and bear thee he said it's also
[1:47:54] written thou shall not tempt the lord
[1:47:55] thy god
[1:47:58] see
[1:47:58] although
[1:47:59] there was a scripture out of psalms 91
[1:48:03] that promised physical protection for
[1:48:05] jesus for the son of man when he came
[1:48:07] lest he dash his foot against his own
[1:48:09] there was angels surrounding him to keep
[1:48:11] him going amen those angels were not
[1:48:14] there at the will and direction of
[1:48:16] christ they were there at the will and
[1:48:17] direction of god
[1:48:20] so jesus says listen he brought him up
[1:48:23] to the pinnacle of the temple he said
[1:48:25] cast itself down amen because of this
[1:48:27] scripture amen he's trying to get him
[1:48:29] once again to prove something by by a
[1:48:32] miracle to show what he is by a miracle
[1:48:35] using the scriptures amen but jesus
[1:48:37] didn't fall for that because that
[1:48:39] scripture was not there for jesus to use
[1:48:41] at his whim that scripture was there for
[1:48:44] god to bring protection to that body
[1:48:46] until it could get to the cross
[1:48:49] see there's many such scriptures that
[1:48:51] are there promised for you and i
[1:48:55] if you think about the promise that
[1:48:56] brother branham gave us the promise that
[1:48:59] said amen nothing can harm a child of
[1:49:02] god until his purpose on earth is
[1:49:03] finished
[1:49:05] now god has already ordained your birth
[1:49:06] god has already ordained your death
[1:49:09] is that true
[1:49:10] is that the word
[1:49:13] if you begin to take that to your own
[1:49:15] will
[1:49:16] and begin to live recklessly
[1:49:19] and dangerously and no value to your own
[1:49:22] life say hey i can't die anyway so god's
[1:49:24] purpose is done with me i'll just do
[1:49:26] this and i'll just do that and i'll
[1:49:30] i'll drive 150 miles an hour on a
[1:49:31] motorcycle because i can't go before my
[1:49:33] time
[1:49:35] well the truth is you can't go for four
[1:49:36] year time but you can limp the rest of
[1:49:38] your life by playing with god's word
[1:49:43] see there's all kinds of scriptures like
[1:49:45] that in the bible amen but those
[1:49:47] scriptures are for god to use at his
[1:49:50] will and discretion not for you to force
[1:49:52] god into a your will and discretion
[1:49:55] that's why he looked at the devil and
[1:49:56] said the scripture also said don't tempt
[1:49:58] god that word 10 means to test or to
[1:50:00] prove i'm not here to test god and his
[1:50:03] faithfulness to his word and make god do
[1:50:05] something amen that word was there for
[1:50:07] god to use at his will at his discretion
[1:50:10] when he saw fit that's not for me to
[1:50:12] force his hand at my will in my
[1:50:14] discretion
[1:50:17] and you see the word can be preached in
[1:50:18] such a way that makes us we do this and
[1:50:21] god has to do that and god has to do
[1:50:23] this for us and god
[1:50:25] god hasn't got to do anything according
[1:50:27] to your will and desire
[1:50:30] god does it according to the purpose
[1:50:31] that he's laid that word there for not
[1:50:33] for you to hijack it to your own purpose
[1:50:36] to vindicate yourself and prove
[1:50:37] something to the world
[1:50:41] although the word's true and it has a
[1:50:43] true application for you
[1:50:46] but we're not to tempt god
[1:50:48] by his word
[1:50:52] so
[1:50:54] before i move on
[1:50:58] he tempted him by his position
[1:51:00] as a son of god he tempted him by vision
[1:51:03] and supernatural and he tempted him by
[1:51:05] the scriptures
[1:51:07] what kind of temptation do you think
[1:51:09] you're going to face
[1:51:14] listen to what brother branham said i
[1:51:16] love this quote
[1:51:18] out of restoration of the bride tree in
[1:51:19] 1962.
[1:51:21] so when that same group of men sent a
[1:51:23] lady down and said brother branham if
[1:51:26] the aims of the lord told you the angel
[1:51:28] lord you know his picture here there if
[1:51:30] the angel of the lord told you that
[1:51:32] we'll believe it she's talking about
[1:51:34] water baptism in jesus name
[1:51:36] in chicago the ministerial association
[1:51:38] had a problem with baptist water baptism
[1:51:39] in jesus name they sent this woman as a
[1:51:41] delegate down to say brother branham if
[1:51:43] you'll just tell us the angel of the
[1:51:44] lord told you that we'll believe it
[1:51:47] and listen to what brother bram says
[1:51:49] i said anybody that a minister or group
[1:51:52] that would be that weak
[1:51:54] if the angel of the lord said if the
[1:51:56] angel said anything contrary to this
[1:51:59] word it wouldn't be the angel of the
[1:52:01] lord
[1:52:02] [Music]
[1:52:03] it doesn't mean an angelic figure a
[1:52:06] being of light a spirit wouldn't come to
[1:52:08] you and tell you amen the right way to
[1:52:11] baptize you know if a light pillar of
[1:52:13] light shows up and the foot of your bed
[1:52:15] tonight and wakes you up and says the
[1:52:17] true interpretation the scripture is the
[1:52:19] baptized and the name of father and of
[1:52:21] son and of holy clothes according to
[1:52:23] those titles amen you could reject that
[1:52:26] wholeheartedly no matter how much
[1:52:28] tingling was all over your body no
[1:52:30] matter how bright the light was no
[1:52:32] matter how deep and rich the voice was
[1:52:34] you could reject it based on the word of
[1:52:36] god
[1:52:44] brother branham says in the way of a
[1:52:45] true prophet of god in 1962
[1:52:48] it says one day satan come like that
[1:52:50] like christ
[1:52:52] crowned golden slippers on stood there
[1:52:55] he's talking about an instance out of
[1:52:56] the life of saint martin
[1:52:59] golden slippers on stood there and said
[1:53:02] blazes of fire all around him said don't
[1:53:04] you recognize me martin i'm your lord
[1:53:06] worship me
[1:53:08] martin looked at him
[1:53:10] there is something wrong there
[1:53:13] this is where i get that statement i
[1:53:15] made it just didn't have that certain
[1:53:19] sound
[1:53:21] like i mean it looked all right and i
[1:53:23] mean it was blaze of fire there was a
[1:53:25] figure there crown everything it was
[1:53:27] really there
[1:53:29] supernatural experience really there and
[1:53:32] saying martin do you recognize me i'm
[1:53:33] your lord my brother brahman says he
[1:53:35] looked and he says uh he makes this
[1:53:38] statement he says
[1:53:40] uh there's just something wrong there
[1:53:44] it just wouldn't settle in martin's
[1:53:46] heart it was a true vision he was seeing
[1:53:48] it it was glorious it was beautiful but
[1:53:50] something just wasn't right
[1:53:54] he said martin can't you recognize me
[1:53:56] i'm your lord and savior said worship me
[1:53:58] he said that three times and martin
[1:54:00] looked around he seen christ would be
[1:54:02] crowned by his people at the coming he
[1:54:04] wouldn't be wearing gold slippers he
[1:54:06] said get thee away from me satan
[1:54:09] boy wouldn't pentecostals eat that up
[1:54:14] a bright shining angel
[1:54:19] he goes on this is another quote from
[1:54:22] anointed ones at the end time in 1965 on
[1:54:24] the same story he said i want to show
[1:54:26] you how deceiving the devil is
[1:54:28] one day he was sitting in a study
[1:54:31] up come a mighty angel crown on his head
[1:54:33] golden shoes on lace around his garments
[1:54:35] of gold said martin do you know me he
[1:54:37] said i'm your lord and savior i'm the
[1:54:39] one that saved you worship me martin but
[1:54:41] that prophet knowing there was a little
[1:54:43] something strange there
[1:54:45] he kept looking at him
[1:54:47] listen
[1:54:48] you wake up in the middle an hour i
[1:54:50] think he was at his desk riding and
[1:54:51] appeared before and said worship me you
[1:54:53] would feel pressure to get up to be
[1:54:55] obedient to drop on your knees but with
[1:54:57] martin just something wouldn't settle in
[1:54:59] his heart something was just wrong and
[1:55:01] he kept looking at him and three times
[1:55:03] he said martin i'm your lord worship me
[1:55:06] martin i mean listen you you think
[1:55:08] you've been through temptation before
[1:55:10] this is the temptation
[1:55:12] who doesn't want to worship the lord who
[1:55:14] wouldn't want an appearance of jesus
[1:55:16] before him that they could bow at his
[1:55:17] feet and worship him i would give an
[1:55:19] unfathomable about the money to be able
[1:55:21] to do that
[1:55:23] and who would want that opportunity and
[1:55:25] not worship
[1:55:28] but here's martin just looking at him
[1:55:32] he says it again children of god are
[1:55:34] strange creatures
[1:55:37] he says it again
[1:55:39] martin i'm your lord worship me
[1:55:42] i don't know
[1:55:46] he says
[1:55:48] martin i'm your savior
[1:55:50] jesus christ worship me don't you know
[1:55:53] me martin
[1:55:54] martin kept looking at him the scripture
[1:55:56] running through his mind he said satan
[1:55:58] get away from me
[1:56:00] he said you've got a crown on your head
[1:56:01] and the word of god says his saints will
[1:56:03] crown him at the end of the age wouldn't
[1:56:04] that have been pentecostal bait watch
[1:56:06] that word brother that's where it pays
[1:56:12] second corinthians 11 14 tells us it
[1:56:14] says no marvel for satan himself is
[1:56:16] transformed into an angel of light
[1:56:20] he doesn't come looking wicked he comes
[1:56:22] as an imposter he comes in deception
[1:56:25] looking like the real thing he's he
[1:56:28] spent millenniums and millenniums of
[1:56:30] time before there was time he spent time
[1:56:33] impersonating the genuine what how do
[1:56:36] you think he brought a deception over
[1:56:38] the angels two-thirds of the angels in
[1:56:40] heaven how did he bring that deception
[1:56:42] unless he spent all his time mimicking
[1:56:44] the genuine
[1:56:46] he didn't come at something different he
[1:56:47] comes copying the original
[1:56:53] then brother branham says in the message
[1:56:55] satan come down in the garden of eden as
[1:56:57] an angel of light
[1:57:02] what was he doing and he was bringing
[1:57:04] more light
[1:57:08] praise god
[1:57:11] brother brahm says
[1:57:13] when jesus nazareth was here on earth he
[1:57:15] never used his power yet he was god
[1:57:17] manifested in flesh he never uses power
[1:57:19] when satan come against him
[1:57:21] he said it's written
[1:57:22] he had to do that because eve broke down
[1:57:24] on that and what eve lost christ
[1:57:27] regained
[1:57:28] where eve let down christ fortified
[1:57:30] again
[1:57:31] it is written man shall not live by
[1:57:32] bread alone it is written thou shalt not
[1:57:34] tempt the lord thy god it is written it
[1:57:36] is written what is it he stayed with the
[1:57:38] original artillery
[1:57:40] but eve let down she began to listen to
[1:57:42] reason
[1:57:43] you want artillery stick with the
[1:57:45] original word
[1:57:49] amen
[1:57:51] i want to look at one more thing here as
[1:57:53] we wind down to a close
[1:57:56] i want to look at three more things
[1:57:58] what am i doing wrong
[1:58:04] okay that works oh there it goes
[1:58:08] okay let me write this down
[1:58:15] brother branham said there's three
[1:58:17] things that you must not do with the
[1:58:19] word
[1:58:21] you must not
[1:58:23] miss
[1:58:28] you know once we get past two syllables
[1:58:30] i get nervous writing up here
[1:58:33] you must not
[1:58:35] misplace
[1:58:38] and you must not
[1:58:41] dislocate
[1:58:45] this is the way to handle the word of
[1:58:46] god or to mishandle the word of god
[1:58:50] he says here
[1:58:52] in christ is revealed in his own word
[1:58:54] from 1965
[1:58:56] now in order to study the scriptures
[1:58:58] paul told timothy study it rightly
[1:58:59] dividing the word of god which is truth
[1:59:03] them is three must in the scripture and
[1:59:05] using god's word there's three things
[1:59:07] that you must not do
[1:59:09] now let's study those for the next ten
[1:59:10] minutes three things that you must not
[1:59:12] do and all out in the land wherever you
[1:59:14] are across the nation be sure to put
[1:59:16] these down in your mind if you haven't
[1:59:18] got a pencil you must not do these
[1:59:20] things
[1:59:21] we tell you all the time how you must do
[1:59:23] now i'm going to tell you what you must
[1:59:25] not do
[1:59:26] you must not misinterpret the word
[1:59:29] you say well i believe it means this it
[1:59:30] means just what it says it needs no
[1:59:32] interpreter
[1:59:34] and you must not misplace the word
[1:59:37] and you must not dislocate the word
[1:59:40] and if we would do either of these it
[1:59:42] throws the whole bible in a confusion
[1:59:44] and in a chaos
[1:59:46] brother brahma goes on further down in
[1:59:48] this message he starts to explain these
[1:59:50] so i'm going to read this as he explains
[1:59:51] him
[1:59:52] if anybody misinterpret jesus christ in
[1:59:54] the bible of not being god himself
[1:59:57] making him the second person or one god
[1:59:59] out of three this would upset every word
[2:00:01] in the entire bible
[2:00:03] it would break the first commandment you
[2:00:04] should not have any other god before me
[2:00:07] all right it would make the whole
[2:00:09] christian race a bunch
[2:00:11] of pagan worshipers worshipping three
[2:00:13] different gods
[2:00:15] see what kind of a bible you'd have then
[2:00:17] it'd make us what the jews say we are
[2:00:19] said which one of them gods is your god
[2:00:21] see see
[2:00:22] you mustn't misinterpret the bible
[2:00:25] where jesus himself is the
[2:00:26] interpretation of the bible when he's
[2:00:28] made manifest in the age that that that
[2:00:30] the part of his body is being manifest
[2:00:33] if it's a hand age it must be a hand
[2:00:36] it can't be a head age if it's a voice
[2:00:38] age well then it can't be a foot agency
[2:00:41] and now we're at the i age and now next
[2:00:43] is him himself
[2:00:46] see seeing prophetic so after the
[2:00:48] prophetic comes the knowledge that
[2:00:50] understanding the word the headship he
[2:00:52] himself after this seeing which is
[2:00:55] prophetic ministry of malachi 4
[2:00:56] revelation 10 7 after that is he himself
[2:01:02] see down through the age we started off
[2:01:04] from the foundation from the first
[2:01:05] church age when the seed went in the
[2:01:07] ground the complete seed then it come
[2:01:09] out through the feet luther come back
[2:01:11] out through wesley then the pentecostals
[2:01:13] the tongues and the lips see now it's in
[2:01:15] the eyes prophetic of malachi 4 and so
[2:01:17] forth and now there's nothing else left
[2:01:19] for it to come but him himself to step
[2:01:22] into that because that's the last thing
[2:01:24] there is
[2:01:25] the next is the intelligence and we have
[2:01:27] no intelligence of our own it's his
[2:01:30] we have no side of our own how can a man
[2:01:32] foresee these things he can't do it it's
[2:01:33] god himself it's becoming to a place
[2:01:36] he's governed the body all the way
[2:01:37] through then the complete body of christ
[2:01:39] is revealed in the form of a bride that
[2:01:42] was taken out of his side like adam did
[2:01:44] at the beginning like adam was rather at
[2:01:47] the beginning
[2:01:48] this is christ coming into this
[2:01:49] manifestation
[2:01:52] now he's going to go on this is where
[2:01:53] he's going to start explaining the other
[2:01:54] two
[2:01:55] yes god this would set the whole bible
[2:01:57] in a confusion break the first
[2:01:59] commandment and make a god a pagan god
[2:02:01] of three
[2:02:02] it would just ruin the whole picture of
[2:02:04] the bible so you must not misinterpret
[2:02:06] the bible now that's just one thing
[2:02:08] then every scripture in the bible has
[2:02:10] the same application you've got to set
[2:02:13] it in its place and to misplace it you
[2:02:16] might make him god in one age and the
[2:02:18] next age you'd make him a history to
[2:02:20] misplace him
[2:02:21] so you mustn't misplace the scripture he
[2:02:23] is god all the time
[2:02:26] if you made him today a god of history
[2:02:28] that was back yonder and he isn't the
[2:02:29] same today what you're going to do with
[2:02:31] hebrews 13 8 see he's the same yesterday
[2:02:34] today and forever
[2:02:35] now see what this would do and what it
[2:02:37] has done is already done it make him
[2:02:39] deny his own word to misplace the
[2:02:41] scriptures
[2:02:43] to dislocate the scriptures you might
[2:02:45] put his body together wrong
[2:02:48] this is so good
[2:02:50] to dislocate the scriptures you might
[2:02:51] put his body together wrong the foot
[2:02:53] where the head should be or something
[2:02:55] see other words you might have jesus
[2:02:57] teaching moses message or even wesley
[2:03:00] teaching luther's age you might now rh
[2:03:02] teaching pentecost the pentecostal
[2:03:04] message you see what a mess it would be
[2:03:06] in pentecost has already shown its
[2:03:08] colors luther has already shown his went
[2:03:10] off into denomination it died right
[2:03:12] there the age struck there it went
[2:03:16] so i want to look at this over here
[2:03:19] in the temptation
[2:03:22] in the temptation
[2:03:24] of jesus christ in the wilderness the
[2:03:27] devil did all three
[2:03:29] so
[2:03:30] jesus faced three temptations
[2:03:32] that that were directly representative
[2:03:35] of the three that eve fell by
[2:03:37] by lust of the flesh lust of the ice
[2:03:39] pride of life
[2:03:40] there was three temptations that come to
[2:03:42] jesus amen tempted by a sonship tempted
[2:03:46] by vision and supernatural and tempted
[2:03:48] by scripture
[2:03:49] and now these three things that you
[2:03:51] don't do with the word satan did all
[2:03:54] three of them in this temptation
[2:03:58] he misinterpret
[2:04:00] he misinterpreted the word
[2:04:02] let me write this down here
[2:04:07] he made sonship
[2:04:11] equal
[2:04:13] to miracles
[2:04:16] or manifestations
[2:04:24] now i'll ask you the question
[2:04:25] do sons have manifestations
[2:04:29] yes
[2:04:31] must they have manifestations yes the
[2:04:33] word has to be made manifest in your
[2:04:35] life
[2:04:38] but he made sonship equal to miracles
[2:04:41] as in if you have miracles then you're a
[2:04:43] son of god and that is a
[2:04:45] misinterpretation of the scripture
[2:04:50] okay he misplaced the word
[2:04:56] let me make that better
[2:05:02] he promised
[2:05:07] angelic protection
[2:05:15] he promised angelic protection
[2:05:18] in a way god didn't promise it
[2:05:23] it was the word of god it was a true
[2:05:26] word of god for that manifestation for
[2:05:29] that person
[2:05:31] but he tried to get christ to force
[2:05:35] god's hand and applying that scripture
[2:05:38] by jesus's own will to prove that jesus
[2:05:41] was somebody special and was who he said
[2:05:43] he was
[2:05:45] that was a misplacing of that scripture
[2:05:49] we see another example of this when
[2:05:51] jesus has brought the woman that was
[2:05:52] caught in adultery
[2:05:54] when the woman that was caught in
[2:05:55] adultery was brought to jesus they come
[2:05:58] to her and said this woman was caught in
[2:06:00] adultery in the very act like they found
[2:06:02] her in the act of adultery
[2:06:05] you cannot commit adultery by yourself
[2:06:09] it takes two people
[2:06:11] so that she was caught in the very act
[2:06:12] of adultery but they just bring her and
[2:06:14] they bring no man
[2:06:17] and then they apply the scripture but
[2:06:19] they misplaced the scripture
[2:06:22] because they said
[2:06:23] the law says she's worthy to be stoned
[2:06:26] but they've misapplied the scripture
[2:06:28] because the scripture says that she and
[2:06:31] the man she commits adultery with are
[2:06:33] supposed to be stoned together
[2:06:36] and so jesus so easily picks up on the
[2:06:38] devil's deception because though it was
[2:06:41] a true word it was a misplacing of the
[2:06:44] true word because you had to have the
[2:06:46] two culprits together and when they were
[2:06:48] together you had to have witnesses when
[2:06:50] you had witnesses then you could do the
[2:06:52] stoning so here they're bringing the
[2:06:54] word but they're misplacing it in a
[2:06:56] wrong application they're trying to trap
[2:06:59] jesus by the scripture they bring
[2:07:01] another temptation by the scripture but
[2:07:04] jesus amen knows the scripture knows the
[2:07:08] nature of the scripture and knows that
[2:07:10] this is a misplacing of the scripture
[2:07:12] and he doesn't take the devil's bait
[2:07:16] there are so many things that are
[2:07:18] promised to you and i but do not let the
[2:07:20] devil misplace them
[2:07:27] and dislocate the word
[2:07:31] tried to get him to have a kingdom
[2:07:38] before sacrifice
[2:07:43] that would dislocate the word of god
[2:07:46] was it was he to be
[2:07:49] listen if you if you go
[2:07:50] if you go all the way over to revelation
[2:07:52] chapter 11 under the sounding of the
[2:07:54] seventh trumpet he says now the kingdoms
[2:07:57] of this world have been to become the
[2:07:58] kingdoms of our god and is christ will
[2:08:00] jesus christ inherit all the kingdoms of
[2:08:02] the world absolutely that word that
[2:08:05] prophecy that scripture was for him it
[2:08:08] was him but the devil tried to dislocate
[2:08:11] the word and tried to get him to bring
[2:08:14] the millennium before
[2:08:16] the sacrifice before the reconciliation
[2:08:20] and before the full redemption
[2:08:23] was it the word yes was it dislocated
[2:08:26] yes and when you dislocate the word amen
[2:08:28] you break the word and the power of god
[2:08:31] amen you're using word but you're using
[2:08:34] i should say this way you're using the
[2:08:35] scripture but you're using the scripture
[2:08:37] to move somebody off the word
[2:08:41] because he was dislocating he was
[2:08:43] getting things out of kilter
[2:08:49] praise be to god
[2:08:52] so
[2:08:53] when we look at this temptation
[2:08:55] in the wilderness it's so much more than
[2:08:57] just a sunday school story jesus goes he
[2:09:00] says no the word the word the word no
[2:09:02] these were real temptations he was
[2:09:03] tempted to take the kingdom
[2:09:06] he was tempted amen to prove that he was
[2:09:08] a son of god he was tempted by hunger he
[2:09:10] was tempted by these things but what was
[2:09:12] the devil doing the devil was doing the
[2:09:14] same thing he's always done with the
[2:09:16] word he misinterprets he misplaces and
[2:09:18] he dislocates
[2:09:20] but what is he tempted by your sonship
[2:09:23] my vision in supernatural
[2:09:25] and
[2:09:26] by the scriptures
[2:09:29] i say friends
[2:09:31] without this message
[2:09:33] what would be our chance
[2:09:36] when we look at what christ has overcome
[2:09:39] and and who was that i want to ask you
[2:09:41] who was that withstanding that
[2:09:43] temptation in that day that was the
[2:09:45] fullness of the word made flesh
[2:09:48] and the fullness of the word amen that
[2:09:51] that was full of the spirit of god led
[2:09:54] into the wilderness to be tempted of the
[2:09:55] devil that fullness of the word with the
[2:09:58] full life of the word was there to
[2:10:01] withstand amen the lust that are in the
[2:10:04] world the lust of the flesh the lust of
[2:10:06] the eyes the the pride of life and he
[2:10:08] was there to withstand the misplacing
[2:10:10] misinterpreting this locating and
[2:10:12] dislocating or misinterpreting
[2:10:14] mislocating dislocating
[2:10:16] of the word
[2:10:18] and how did he overcome he was the
[2:10:20] fullness of the word
[2:10:25] so what is the bride manifestation
[2:10:30] it's the full measure of the word all
[2:10:32] brought into a capstone ministry and a
[2:10:34] bride in the end time
[2:10:37] with the full measure of the word the
[2:10:39] headship that has been restored to a
[2:10:42] people on this earth with the full life
[2:10:45] of that word there to bring it correctly
[2:10:47] into correct manifestation
[2:10:50] if we don't have that
[2:10:52] we won't pass the test
[2:10:55] but this bride has to be tempted like
[2:10:57] adam's bride tested like adam's bride
[2:10:59] was tested and what will she be tested
[2:11:01] by shall be tested by the word
[2:11:06] listen don't think because you've got a
[2:11:08] scripture that you can do anything you
[2:11:10] want
[2:11:11] that scripture can't be misinterpreted
[2:11:15] can't be misplaced and can't be
[2:11:17] dislocated
[2:11:18] well brother chad how will i know if
[2:11:20] it's misinterpreted misplaced or
[2:11:22] dislocated i'll tell you real simple
[2:11:25] find out what the prophet said about
[2:11:27] that scripture
[2:11:28] go back to the message and find out what
[2:11:30] the prophet said about this doctrine
[2:11:32] this teaching this circumstance in life
[2:11:35] this scripture find out what he taught
[2:11:37] and when you find out what he taught you
[2:11:39] will find the application of the word in
[2:11:42] the right season in the right
[2:11:44] application with the right
[2:11:46] interpretation for the day that you're
[2:11:47] living
[2:11:51] don't play with this message
[2:11:53] don't cut pieces off don't cut the edges
[2:11:55] don't trim it up don't make it palatable
[2:11:57] don't make it more appealing don't make
[2:11:59] it more appetizing this message is the
[2:12:02] same thing that was standing there that
[2:12:04] day when jesus was withstanding the
[2:12:06] temptation in the wilderness that same
[2:12:08] manifest that same life that was in that
[2:12:11] manifestation that same life is here
[2:12:13] withstanding the same thing in this day
[2:12:15] and what is it it's the message the
[2:12:17] message is christ amen the message is
[2:12:20] the full measure of christ the full word
[2:12:22] with the full thought of god with the
[2:12:24] full life of the word that has come back
[2:12:26] to a people
[2:12:29] and without that we won't have victory
[2:12:31] we've got to lay in the message amen lay
[2:12:33] in the presence of the son bake all of
[2:12:35] the greenness out of us until we can
[2:12:38] overcome all that's in the world the
[2:12:39] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[2:12:42] and the pride of life how will we do it
[2:12:44] when we walk in the spirit
[2:12:49] we walk in the spirit
[2:12:52] you shall not fulfill the lust of the
[2:12:54] flesh
[2:12:56] how will i walk in the spirit
[2:12:58] jesus says the words
[2:13:01] that i speak unto you
[2:13:03] they are spirit
[2:13:05] and they are life
[2:13:07] this spoken word in this end time has
[2:13:10] brought the spirit the life of god the
[2:13:12] life of the word the life of christ you
[2:13:14] call it whatever name you want it's the
[2:13:16] same thing
[2:13:17] it has brought that full life not
[2:13:19] partial it was partial luther's day it
[2:13:22] was partial in wesley's day this is not
[2:13:24] a partial day that's why wesley could
[2:13:26] believe false things luther could
[2:13:27] believe false things they could do wrong
[2:13:29] things it was partial that day they were
[2:13:32] still being tripped up by scriptures
[2:13:33] they were still being tripped up by
[2:13:35] mislocations misinterpretations
[2:13:36] dislocations of the word but not today
[2:13:39] today is a different day the word has
[2:13:41] come to defeat the devil in all of that
[2:13:44] so he can bring the final victory when
[2:13:46] the the christ was restored amen by by
[2:13:49] standing the test the bride has to come
[2:13:51] in contact again by the same thing to
[2:13:53] stand a test by the word and when the
[2:13:55] groom is restored and the bride is
[2:13:57] restored then the eden will be restored
[2:14:03] the devil is fighting like crazy to keep
[2:14:05] this bride
[2:14:07] from completely overcoming
[2:14:10] he's holding on as long as he can if he
[2:14:12] can get you to take a promise before
[2:14:14] it's time he'll let you have it i'll
[2:14:15] give you my whole kingdom if you'll just
[2:14:17] take it out of order
[2:14:19] i'll give you powers amen i'll make you
[2:14:21] the best preacher on the planet if
[2:14:22] you'll just preach this land
[2:14:25] i'll make you write songs like nobody
[2:14:27] will believe if you just take this
[2:14:28] little slam on the word
[2:14:31] don't think that the devil can't he
[2:14:32] can't take god's gifts and twist them
[2:14:34] and manifest them
[2:14:40] say no devil
[2:14:42] i want this message and it's the only
[2:14:44] thing i want
[2:14:45] and i want god to help me see it right
[2:14:47] amen with the right interpretation with
[2:14:49] the right spirit with the right nature
[2:14:51] amen amen god is so good to us he didn't
[2:14:53] drop a book out of heaven amen the
[2:14:56] seventh seal the seven church age and
[2:14:58] 1400 messages amen to say okay here's it
[2:15:00] is i hope you get it right but no he
[2:15:02] gave us the word there was a vessel that
[2:15:04] word came through that would reflect the
[2:15:06] very word that he was speaking so we
[2:15:08] could see the reflection of the word and
[2:15:10] the wave sheep that was waved over the
[2:15:11] people so that we wouldn't just have
[2:15:13] word to fight over and argue over but we
[2:15:15] would see the nature of the word on
[2:15:17] display so when anything comes amen no
[2:15:20] matter with what scriptures no matter
[2:15:22] what manifestations if it doesn't have
[2:15:25] the same nature that was displayed in
[2:15:26] that wave sheet i'm not accepting it as
[2:15:28] the message
[2:15:34] listen we are the most privileged people
[2:15:35] that have ever walked on this planet
[2:15:41] god has so made sure that we would have
[2:15:43] the word
[2:15:44] but not just the rhema word but he would
[2:15:47] express it in a life amen the first part
[2:15:51] of the field to come to harvest maturity
[2:15:53] that word matured in that prophet and
[2:15:56] god lifted that and waited for the
[2:15:57] people so you could say the same word
[2:16:00] that fraud produced that maturity if i
[2:16:02] will lay in the presence of this son
[2:16:04] which is this manifested word
[2:16:07] and bake all the greenness out of me i
[2:16:09] can live that life and if the word i
[2:16:11] believe brings a different life i would
[2:16:13] check the word something's
[2:16:14] misinterpreted something's mislocated
[2:16:16] something's dislocated
[2:16:21] but i want
[2:16:23] i want to have
[2:16:25] the correct word
[2:16:27] because the correct word brings the
[2:16:29] correct life
[2:16:31] and i want to live the life of jesus
[2:16:33] christ because that's what this message
[2:16:36] came to produce
[2:16:40] the scriptures can sound so good we've
[2:16:42] got this scripture in this scripture and
[2:16:44] it gives you 10 scriptures to support my
[2:16:46] idea
[2:16:48] but you're nasty and you're hateful
[2:16:51] you're divisive
[2:16:55] something
[2:16:57] you you can be preaching like a house on
[2:16:59] fire and bringing tons of scrotching
[2:17:01] quotes and scriptures but you're
[2:17:02] divisive and nasty and hateful and
[2:17:05] condemning and something in me is
[2:17:07] standing like martin looking at jesus
[2:17:08] christ going something's not right
[2:17:11] like
[2:17:12] the scriptures are true and the quotes i
[2:17:14] believe but but
[2:17:17] what's wrong with you
[2:17:20] why won't you respond what's wrong with
[2:17:22] you why won't you shout amen and you're
[2:17:24] sitting like martin going um
[2:17:27] i the scriptures yeah those are good
[2:17:29] scriptures
[2:17:31] yeah that's a true quote but
[2:17:34] something's not right
[2:17:39] have you ever experienced that
[2:17:42] but i say god make us right from the top
[2:17:44] to the bottom inside and out amen you've
[2:17:47] brought a word with the spirit to bring
[2:17:49] the right manifestation so that we can
[2:17:51] be whatever he was we are in this earth
[2:17:54] make it manifest in me let me see this
[2:17:57] message the right way take the scales
[2:17:58] off of my eyes give me the right
[2:18:00] revelation amen let me take this message
[2:18:03] in this scripture the word that you've
[2:18:05] given to us and give us the right
[2:18:07] interpretation
[2:18:08] the right placement
[2:18:10] the right location so that we can
[2:18:12] manifest the right life
[2:18:16] i don't want anything other than that
[2:18:18] it can be deep it can be simple i don't
[2:18:20] care give me the life
[2:18:23] it can take hours it can be 30 minutes i
[2:18:25] don't care give me the life
[2:18:28] give me a word that produces the life of
[2:18:30] jesus christ that will reproduce his
[2:18:32] very life and nature in me and i will
[2:18:34] say that's more than scripture that's
[2:18:35] the
[2:18:37] it's word than quotes that's the word
[2:18:39] it's more than scriptures that's the
[2:18:40] word because it has that ring to it amen
[2:18:46] brother bram says in christ the mystery
[2:18:48] god revealed he says in there there
[2:18:50] would be a time come forth when he would
[2:18:52] express himself in fullness of his
[2:18:54] godhead deity through his church
[2:18:56] have the preeminence in this church oh
[2:18:58] my the anointed man now the anointed
[2:19:01] people oh my to bring back the anointed
[2:19:03] bride and bridegroom anointed by why
[2:19:07] accepting what eve turned down
[2:19:09] what did eve turn down the word what do
[2:19:11] you accept the word what word did eve
[2:19:14] have the full word for her day what word
[2:19:16] do you accept the full word for your day
[2:19:20] by accepting what eve turned down
[2:19:22] and adam
[2:19:24] coming back with the anointing of the
[2:19:25] word because he said my spirit my word
[2:19:28] is spirit see anointed with the word
[2:19:31] what eve turned down listen to this what
[2:19:33] eve turned down he comes back and we
[2:19:36] accept
[2:19:38] he didn't say it comes back
[2:19:41] this wasn't just scriptures coming back
[2:19:44] it was the person of the word who came
[2:19:45] back
[2:19:46] what did eve leave eve left christ
[2:19:49] because christ is the word when she left
[2:19:52] the word she left christ
[2:19:55] and that's why brother branham says it
[2:19:57] this way what eve turned down christ the
[2:20:00] word
[2:20:00] he comes back has he come back he comes
[2:20:04] back friends he's here accept him don't
[2:20:07] turn him down don't do what eve did he's
[2:20:09] come back now accept him in the full
[2:20:11] measure of his word with the full light
[2:20:15] he comes back and we accept see how that
[2:20:17] hybrid condition again just exactly what
[2:20:19] he'd done eve he told eve don't you do
[2:20:22] this and don't you do that and you can
[2:20:23] do this and that and satan said oh you
[2:20:26] know but she turned around and listened
[2:20:28] to him
[2:20:29] but the eve in this last day is not
[2:20:32] going to do it
[2:20:36] because
[2:20:38] she's smarter stronger can read faster
[2:20:43] has better churches and
[2:20:46] even this last day is not going to do it
[2:20:48] because she's predestinated not to
[2:20:52] oh
[2:20:53] it was never dependent on you
[2:20:57] when god looked down through the stream
[2:20:58] of time and he knew that you would come
[2:21:00] at this end time to finish the work he
[2:21:02] was never leaving at all to you to
[2:21:03] manufacture in your flesh he was saying
[2:21:06] i know what to do amen there's a seed of
[2:21:09] me laying in there and that seed will
[2:21:12] only respond to the word so what i will
[2:21:14] do is i will bring a word that will
[2:21:16] bring this seed to life and the more
[2:21:18] word that i push in the more life will
[2:21:20] come out so when i bring the full word i
[2:21:23] will push out the full life amen he was
[2:21:26] not depending on you doing better
[2:21:28] working harder trying again he was he
[2:21:31] was totally satisfied that at the end of
[2:21:33] this age when i bring this word down
[2:21:36] that life that's inside of that soul
[2:21:38] will reflect this light that's coming
[2:21:40] here
[2:21:43] but even the last day is not going to do
[2:21:45] it
[2:21:46] because she's predestinated
[2:21:49] not to do it yes sir god's going to do
[2:21:51] it
[2:21:53] how's he going to do it in you
[2:21:56] but it's not you it's him
[2:21:58] him and you
[2:21:59] what do i do brother chad walk in the
[2:22:02] spirit
[2:22:03] it's here it's available it's coming
[2:22:06] with the message feed on the message
[2:22:08] feed on the word of god devour the bible

[2:22:12] word listen to the preaching of the word
[2:22:14] receive the spirit walk in the spirit
[2:22:16] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[2:22:18] the flesh
[2:22:19] he's brought the fullness of the spirit
[2:22:21] to give us a full measure
[2:22:24] of overcoming power
[2:22:26] even the last day's not going to do it
[2:22:28] because she's predestinated not to yes
[2:22:29] sir god's going to do it he knows he'll
[2:22:32] have it he said his church will be
[2:22:34] without spot or wrinkle she's going to
[2:22:36] stand there in the splendor of him
[2:22:40] his word made
[2:22:41] manifest
[2:22:44] how many are glad he said he's going to
[2:22:46] do it
[2:22:47] it's by predestination you could never
[2:22:50] try hard enough to make it happen
[2:22:54] what's he asking you to do he's asking
[2:22:56] you to surrender
[2:22:58] to believe and give yourself over give
[2:23:01] him preeminence and if you can give
[2:23:03] preeminence to this word the life of
[2:23:05] this word can come in and live its own
[2:23:07] life out of you
[2:23:09] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[2:23:11] fulfill
[2:23:13] the lust of the flesh
[2:23:15] amen let's all stand
[2:23:18] musicians if you'll come
[2:23:23] i just want to say this as we close
[2:23:31] the correct interpretation of the word
[2:23:33] if i
[2:23:34] i'm just i i've made statements today
[2:23:36] this is just my understanding the way i
[2:23:38] can express it and they may not be 100
[2:23:40] accurate and i may express it a
[2:23:41] different way in the future but but just
[2:23:43] hear me
[2:23:45] the correct interpretation of the word
[2:23:50] to me
[2:23:51] is expressed in the nature of the word
[2:23:57] why can i believe this message so much i
[2:23:59] see it tied through the scripture all
[2:24:01] the way front and back forward sideways
[2:24:03] up and down
[2:24:04] i see that
[2:24:06] but but i see what that revelation did
[2:24:09] to that man
[2:24:14] and that man was
[2:24:16] born in sin
[2:24:18] that man had complexes
[2:24:20] that man fell he made mistakes he even
[2:24:23] told us listen
[2:24:25] you want to see how deceptive uh
[2:24:28] deception is the deception of the devil
[2:24:30] brother banham was struggling with
[2:24:32] rejection a rejection complex and being
[2:24:34] rejected after preaching the seals and
[2:24:36] he was struggling under all that and
[2:24:37] feeling depressed and he had himself
[2:24:40] convinced by a little voice in his head
[2:24:44] telling him that prophets don't act this
[2:24:46] way the old prophets of old in the old
[2:24:48] testament they lived out in the
[2:24:49] wilderness they got a message from god
[2:24:51] and they stomped out and delivered their
[2:24:53] message now listen that was the devil
[2:24:56] tempting him
[2:24:59] that was the devil tempting and how was
[2:25:01] he tempting him by the scriptures
[2:25:07] listen the devil's not going to come and
[2:25:08] bring you a pack of cigarettes and say i
[2:25:10] want you to stumble today
[2:25:12] we're too far down the road for that
[2:25:15] that was how we stumble when we first
[2:25:17] believed
[2:25:19] but then he brings those things away and
[2:25:20] breaks that away from him and now the
[2:25:22] devil his tactics are getting more
[2:25:24] deceptive and more deceptive and more
[2:25:26] deceptive
[2:25:29] but he comes to brother branham and says
[2:25:31] you're not even acting like the old
[2:25:33] testament prophet you're a prophet
[2:25:35] that's true
[2:25:37] the old testament prophets lived
[2:25:38] separated they would just march in and
[2:25:40] give their messenger that's true too
[2:25:42] so were the scriptures correct
[2:25:45] was he was he calling a a man a true
[2:25:48] prophet was he correct in that
[2:25:50] designation yeah the devil had truth
[2:25:54] but he didn't have all the truth
[2:25:57] and brother branham
[2:25:59] brother brahm is so honest
[2:26:02] he comes in standing in the gap and he's
[2:26:04] telling us
[2:26:05] that sounded pretty good to me
[2:26:09] and was willing to bring a deception to
[2:26:12] his wife to pull the plan out because he
[2:26:14] was seeing the wisdom in the scriptures
[2:26:17] and he was a prophet and this is
[2:26:18] prophets in the bible i'm going to do
[2:26:20] what the prophets do in the bible and
[2:26:21] here's what he told us he said really
[2:26:24] i was doing that for myself because i
[2:26:26] wanted to hunt and fish
[2:26:30] lust of the flesh
[2:26:33] how's brother man being tripped up lust
[2:26:35] of the fl he had desires he wanted to
[2:26:38] get away from the pain
[2:26:40] and go to what brought him pleasure
[2:26:44] how do you and i get tripped up the same
[2:26:46] exact way
[2:26:48] and the devil uses scriptures and he
[2:26:50] points to well you know brother
[2:26:52] so-and-so did this and remember that
[2:26:54] story in the bible and remember you know
[2:26:56] martin luther thought it was okay to do
[2:26:57] this
[2:26:59] it sounds silly but that's exactly what
[2:27:01] happens to us
[2:27:04] but brother man was honest enough when
[2:27:06] god spoke to him and called him out he
[2:27:07] was honest and i'm saying really that
[2:27:09] was my own desire
[2:27:11] i he was giving over to that voice
[2:27:14] because it matched the desire he had in
[2:27:15] his heart and and god come to him and
[2:27:17] corrected him and gave him the correct
[2:27:20] word for his season and placed the word
[2:27:22] in him he says you've got more gifts
[2:27:24] than that
[2:27:25] and these other gifts can't be expressed
[2:27:27] that way
[2:27:29] he brought him more of the word
[2:27:32] i say god
[2:27:34] keep me right
[2:27:36] you've promised that i'll not fail
[2:27:40] by predestination
[2:27:43] now god
[2:27:45] help me
[2:27:46] help me to see right help me to believe
[2:27:49] right help me lord god help me to lose
[2:27:53] my desire for all these other carnal
[2:27:55] things that take my time and attention

[2:28:35] expose you exposed the tactics of the
[2:28:38] devil
[2:28:39] you laid him bare you opened up all the
[2:28:41] falsehood and the lies and the deception
