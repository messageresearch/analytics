[0:02] [Music]
[0:07] lift it
[0:14] and up
[0:18] this thirsting of
[0:21] my soul
[0:26] bread of heaven
[0:42] fill
[0:44] [Music]
[0:56] my
[1:05] [Music]
[1:10] is
[1:24] oh
[1:38] praise the lord amen it's good to see
[1:40] you all today
[1:42] wonderful the devil don't like us tries
[1:45] to send a snowstorm every saturday
[1:48] but he loses amen while we're standing
[1:51] let's take our
[1:52] bibles and turn to john chapter 5
[1:55] and read verse 39. we're continuing on
[1:59] in the same
[2:00] vein of thought that we've been in this
[2:02] scripture says search the scriptures
[2:04] for in them you think you have eternal
[2:06] life and they are they which
[2:08] testify of me while you're stating let's
[2:12] turn to matthew 13
[2:14] and read one more portion of scripture
[2:17] before we see it in matthew
[2:19] chapter 13. and i'm like to begin
[2:23] at verse 10.
[2:35] matthew 13 10 and the disciples came and
[2:37] said to him
[2:38] why speakest thou unto them in parables
[2:41] and he answered and said unto them
[2:42] because it is given unto you to know the
[2:44] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
[2:46] but to them it is not given for
[2:49] whosoever hath to him shall be given
[2:52] so if in order for you to understand the
[2:54] mysteries of the kingdom you already
[2:56] have to have something
[2:58] amen you already have to have sin
[3:00] because to him that hath
[3:02] it shall be given amen and
[3:05] and he shall have in more abundance but
[3:08] whosoever hath
[3:09] not from him shall be taken even
[3:13] take away even that he hath so this is
[3:15] very strange language very strange
[3:17] terminology
[3:18] because if you have if you already have
[3:21] then you're going to receive it shall be
[3:23] given that you shall have more abundance
[3:26] but whosoever hath not from him shall be
[3:30] taken away
[3:31] even that he hath so he has something
[3:34] but he doesn't have the right thing amen
[3:36] it's not that he didn't have anything
[3:38] but he didn't have the second group
[3:39] doesn't have what the first group has
[3:41] amen
[3:42] and that's the seed of god amen that's
[3:44] the predestinated election that come
[3:46] from god so if you have it more will be
[3:48] given if you don't have it
[3:49] even what you have will be taken away
[3:52] hallelujah
[3:53] verse 13 therefore speak i to them in
[3:55] parables because they
[3:57] they seeing see not in hearing they hear
[4:00] not
[4:01] neither do they understand praise the
[4:04] lord let's bow our heads
[4:06] their heavenly father we thank you lord
[4:08] for your word
[4:09] it is so rich and so precious to us lord
[4:12] and we just appreciate every time that
[4:14] we get to gather together like this
[4:16] and now we ask all that you would come
[4:18] on the scene in such a supernatural way
[4:20] and do what only you can do by using the
[4:23] foolishness of preaching to save the
[4:24] lost
[4:25] i pray that you move the man out of the
[4:27] way and take this vessel of clay lord
[4:29] and
[4:29] use it for your glory speak your eternal
[4:31] words lord through these lips
[4:33] and that you might be glorified forever
[4:35] we give ourselves to you and ask that
[4:37] you would have preeminence this morning
[4:39] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[4:42] you can be seated
[4:46] so so we find out that jesus
[4:49] intentionally
[4:51] taught in parables amen it was
[4:54] on purpose and intentional that he
[4:56] taught parables
[4:58] because there's only a certain group
[5:00] who's intended to know the mysteries of
[5:01] the kingdom
[5:02] amen so there is a group who's intended
[5:04] to know and a group who's not intended
[5:06] no
[5:07] and the group who should know already
[5:09] hath
[5:10] and the group is not intended no does
[5:12] not already have
[5:14] it's that simple amen and so if
[5:17] you find yourself in the category where
[5:20] you have something and the mysteries are
[5:21] being opened to you you should be the
[5:23] happiest person
[5:24] on this planet because that doesn't come
[5:26] to everybody amen
[5:27] that's a very special position that you
[5:29] didn't put yourself in
[5:30] that you didn't work yourself up to you
[5:32] have nothing to do with it
[5:34] god had predestinated before the
[5:35] foundation of the world and if god is
[5:38] revealing his mysteries to you and it's
[5:39] opening up
[5:40] not in a way that i'm just going to
[5:42] repeat what somebody else says but i
[5:43] see the picture amen it's real it's a
[5:46] reality to me
[5:47] i see it and i'm part of it amen that
[5:49] should make you sing and shout and dance
[5:51] and be happy
[5:52] every day of your life amen because even
[5:55] here if every day is a treachery and
[5:56] every work day is hard
[5:58] and sickness and strife and financial
[6:00] issues hit you all the time
[6:02] nothing can take away what you already
[6:04] have amen nothing can stop the mysteries
[6:07] from being unlocked in your life
[6:08] and after this life of toil and pain and
[6:12] suffering is over
[6:13] you go back to that which you came from
[6:16] hallelujah so the message isn't a new
[6:19] form of belief it's not something else
[6:21] it's not something that's a little bit
[6:23] better or a little bit higher
[6:24] it's more than that it's christ amen
[6:27] and it came to reveal christ
[6:32] that's why the message came to reveal
[6:34] you to yourself
[6:38] amen what is the opening of the seals
[6:40] revealing christ
[6:43] who was identified in that opening in
[6:44] the fields
[6:46] it says first seal i'm going to i'm not
[6:49] going to call you church i'm going to
[6:50] call you bride
[6:52] so that you'll understand hallelujah
[6:56] amen if you've been unveiled under those
[6:58] seals you should be happy
[7:00] happy happy
[7:03] brother brahm says in the kinsman
[7:05] redeemer
[7:07] 1960 says and this story was written in
[7:11] all the old manuscripts when they were
[7:13] segregating the bible the holy men when
[7:15] they were trying to put it together in
[7:16] the old testament
[7:17] this book of ruth was one of the
[7:19] outstanding books
[7:20] that they accepted so we've been through
[7:23] tamar
[7:23] we've been through rahab and now we're
[7:25] going to begin to look at ruth
[7:27] he said ruth was one of the outstanding
[7:29] books that they accepted why
[7:31] if it's just a love story why would the
[7:33] writers and ancient sages accept this
[7:35] book as inspired
[7:37] because there's a hidden revelation in
[7:39] it
[7:40] amen there's a hidden revelation
[7:43] amen the book of ruth is just another
[7:45] parable in the bible
[7:47] and you can read it and read it and read
[7:49] it and miss the parable
[7:50] but if you have the mystery will be
[7:52] revealed to you
[7:54] hallelujah there's a hidden revelation
[7:57] in it and then this hidden revelation
[8:00] you catch the real meaning and it'll
[8:02] bring you real close to god
[8:04] i'm excited to read ruth and i pray my
[8:08] whole soul this morning that god will
[8:10] catch every heart so spellbound
[8:12] till he'll reveal himself just what he
[8:14] is in this story
[8:15] what he is to you how to accept him
[8:19] and then you once see it it's so simple
[8:22] you wonder how you ever went over the
[8:23] top of it
[8:24] amen but it can only be revealed by the
[8:27] holy spirit
[8:28] and that's the amazing part of the
[8:31] mysteries being revealed i mean you go
[8:33] back and
[8:34] comb through the bible and the words
[8:36] haven't changed
[8:38] the print there's not a new version
[8:40] there's not an updated release
[8:42] it's the same king james bible that
[8:44] we've been reading since 1611.
[8:48] the ink on the paper is not changing
[8:51] but the bible's becoming new
[8:54] it's changing for me but it's not
[8:56] changing amen
[8:58] so i must be changing if it's the same
[9:02] and i'm seeing it different reading it
[9:03] different
[9:04] the change is not here the change must
[9:06] be right here amen
[9:09] hallelujah i'm so thankful for that so
[9:12] thankful every time we read through it's
[9:13] a new book
[9:15] every time we go back to the word it's
[9:16] constantly unfolding and opening and
[9:18] unfolding
[9:19] that shows that the bride is maturing
[9:21] that she's growing into her
[9:22] predestinated position
[9:24] because if you go back to the message
[9:26] again and it's the same message you've
[9:27] read a dozen times
[9:28] you go back to the word it's the same
[9:30] word you've read a thousand times
[9:32] you've stopped growing
[9:35] i said god don't ever let me stop
[9:37] growing amen god keep opening up your
[9:40] mysteries keep revealing yourself to me
[9:41] that it's new
[9:42] all the time that it's fresh every time
[9:45] i pick it up it's like
[9:47] i know i've read this message i know i
[9:49] put those marks on that book
[9:51] but that's like i've never read this
[9:53] portion before
[9:55] it's as if it's the first time all over
[9:57] again
[9:59] oh talk about talking about keeping
[10:01] people excited about coming to church
[10:03] you don't have to do a program you don't
[10:04] have to pull people or lay a guilt trip
[10:06] on them to come to church
[10:07] all they got to do is come and see the
[10:09] word open the breaking of bread
[10:11] and they'll come back amen the seed of
[10:13] god will come back week after week after
[10:15] week
[10:15] because that's the most exciting part of
[10:17] our lives
[10:19] is to see the word broken and open and
[10:22] unveiled
[10:25] hallelujah
[10:28] amen he goes on to say
[10:36] now many reading the bible read it just
[10:39] stand up and read a page and read a page
[10:42] you'll never get it
[10:44] because it's in riddles and jesus thank
[10:48] god for making it like that said you've
[10:49] hid it from the eyes of the wise and
[10:51] prudent and we'll reveal it
[10:52] and reveal it to babe such as we'll
[10:54] learn as i've often said and mrs branham
[10:57] sitting back there this morning
[10:59] but when i'm overseas she'll write me a
[11:01] letter she'll say dear bill
[11:03] i'm sitting here tonight with the
[11:04] children i'm thinking of you
[11:06] and she'd go ahead and write what she's
[11:08] going to do but i love her and i know
[11:10] her so well i can read between the lines
[11:15] i know exactly what she's saying whether
[11:17] she writes it on here or not
[11:19] because i know what she's saying why is
[11:22] that
[11:23] that's a close contact we're one
[11:26] and she knows my nature i know hers
[11:30] so now brother ben can take a letter
[11:32] that his wife is written in when he's
[11:34] overseas
[11:35] and she'll write a letter amen and she
[11:38] wants to convey to him
[11:39] certain things certain emotions certain
[11:42] feelings certain longings that she's
[11:44] having for him
[11:44] but she doesn't want anybody who picks
[11:46] up the letter to know her deepest
[11:48] desires and longings and
[11:50] all that she's really trying to convey
[11:52] it might be embarrassing it might make
[11:54] her blush a little bit
[11:56] so she writes it in such a way that only
[11:59] he knows the message she's trying to get
[12:02] across
[12:04] and how does she know that he's going to
[12:06] get the point
[12:08] of what she's saying is because they're
[12:10] so close
[12:11] he knows her nature she knows his nature
[12:13] and she knows how to word it in such a
[12:15] way
[12:16] that he's going to get it amen and
[12:17] that's exactly how god has written his
[12:20] bible
[12:20] it is a love letter amen and he's
[12:22] written it in such a way
[12:24] that you could read it and read it and
[12:26] read it and read it
[12:28] and never get the point
[12:33] the point is not the kids have went to
[12:35] bed and i'm all alone
[12:38] that's not the point the point is i'm
[12:40] missing you wish you were here beside me
[12:43] but you could read it and read it and
[12:45] read it and never
[12:46] get the point amen but if you've come
[12:48] into that
[12:49] union that oneness that closeness and
[12:52] you know his nature
[12:53] he knows your nature now you're not
[12:55] reading it like a textbook you're not
[12:56] reading it like it's written to somebody
[12:58] else
[12:59] you're reading it like it's written just
[13:00] to you right now today
[13:03] and that's how we have to read the bible
[13:05] not as though it was written to those
[13:06] that were that were back in
[13:08] in palestine when they first cross over
[13:10] jordan he didn't write it for them he
[13:12] wrote it for us
[13:14] oh he wrote that those were instructions
[13:16] given to them in the exodus journey
[13:18] no those are instructions given to you
[13:20] in your journey
[13:23] amen and then you know what he's saying
[13:26] to us
[13:28] if we could go to matthew chapter one
[13:31] and keep going forward in this thought
[13:34] that we're in
[13:40] i love reading this and it feels like
[13:42] we've been out of it for a couple weeks
[13:43] now so i want to
[13:44] jump right back in and do a little
[13:46] review and move forward
[13:48] matthew chapter one says the book of the
[13:50] generation of jesus christ
[13:52] the son of david the son of abraham
[13:55] abraham begot isaac and isaac begot
[13:57] jacob and jacob begot
[13:58] judas and his brethren so you notice it
[14:01] doesn't mention
[14:02] any of the brethren and only mentions
[14:04] judas from this point on we're only
[14:06] going to follow
[14:07] judah's lineage because he was
[14:10] prophesied that out of judah judah will
[14:12] have the scepter
[14:13] out of judah will come the law giver so
[14:15] if i would like to read the
[14:17] two verses that state that if we could
[14:18] go together to genesis 49
[14:21] we read this several weeks ago but i
[14:22] just want to lay it in here
[14:25] again as a review genesis 49
[14:30] so we can understand why the lineage is
[14:33] following
[14:34] judah
[14:38] genesis 49
[14:45] and verse 8.
[14:52] this is as israel as jacob's beginning
[14:54] to bless his children one at a time and
[14:56] speak over them he comes to judah in
[14:58] verse 8 he says judah thou
[15:00] art he who thy brethren shall praise thy
[15:03] hand shall be in the neck of thine
[15:04] enemies thy father's children shall bow
[15:06] down before thee
[15:08] judah is a lion's wealth from the prey
[15:10] my son thou
[15:11] art gone up he stooped down he couched
[15:14] as a lion
[15:14] and as an old lion who shall rouse him
[15:17] up the scepter shall not depart
[15:19] from judah nor a lawgiver from between
[15:22] his feet until shiloh come
[15:24] and unto him shall the gathering of the
[15:26] people
[15:27] be so here of all the 12 children this
[15:30] is the one
[15:31] who's going to have the scepter the
[15:33] lineage of the lawgiver the kingly race
[15:35] is coming or the kingly line is coming
[15:37] through judah
[15:38] now if we turn over the first chronicles
[15:41] we'll pick this up again first
[15:43] chronicles chapter 5.
[15:48] so you have samuel king's chronicles
[15:51] first chronicles
[15:57] chapter 5 and we'll read verse 1 and 2.
[16:02] so first chronicles 5 1-2
[16:05] now the sons of reuben the firstborn of
[16:07] israel for he was the firstborn but for
[16:10] as much as he defiled his father's bed
[16:13] his birthright was given unto the sons
[16:15] of joseph
[16:16] the son of israel and the genealogy is
[16:19] not to be reckoned after the birthright
[16:21] so now the the birthright was rubens as
[16:24] the firstborn
[16:25] but it was transferred from reuben who
[16:26] was the firstborn of the first woman
[16:28] leah
[16:29] the first wife and it was transferred
[16:31] and given
[16:32] to the firstborn of the second wife
[16:34] rachel
[16:36] and rachel was the one that he was jacob
[16:38] was after from the beginning he'd never
[16:40] wanted to marry leah
[16:41] he wanted to marry rachel and that's
[16:43] important because brother brenham said
[16:45] god from before that foundation of the
[16:47] world always wanted a gentile bride
[16:50] it was god's desire from the beginning
[16:52] to have a gentile bride amen
[16:55] but in order to get the gentile bride he
[16:57] had to come and redeem
[16:58] leah first work the seven years for leah
[17:01] and afterwards he could get a gentile
[17:03] bride
[17:04] rachel and then after he got rachel then
[17:05] he had to work seven more years
[17:07] for rachel go through the seven church
[17:09] ages amen but at the end of seven years
[17:12] amen then joseph is born and joseph is
[17:14] the firstborn
[17:16] amen of the desired wife let's put it
[17:19] that way
[17:20] and so when reuben sinned reuben had to
[17:22] sin reuben had to fail
[17:24] because god's plan has to be displayed
[17:26] here so when reuben falls in sin
[17:28] the birthright doesn't go from him to
[17:29] levi the second born no it goes
[17:32] down to rachel's firstborn who is
[17:36] joseph who's the type of christ
[17:39] who gets the firstborn birthrights so
[17:41] then we go to the next one next verse
[17:44] verse 2 for judah prevailed above his
[17:46] brethren
[17:47] and of him came the chief ruler but the
[17:50] birthright was joseph's so now judah
[17:54] who is the fourth born uh uh
[17:57] first born of jacob f fourth born of
[17:59] israel is
[18:00] the deliverer and he's the kingly lion
[18:03] who is the deliverer
[18:04] one two three four four is god's number
[18:07] of
[18:08] deliverance amen so we find that the
[18:10] king is going to come through the fourth
[18:12] born
[18:12] and this number four is going to run all
[18:14] the way through the bible
[18:16] just like the number seven and all these
[18:18] other numbers
[18:19] so so we just say this in a way of
[18:20] review this is why
[18:22] we're coming down through judah because
[18:24] matthew is describing the coming of the
[18:26] king
[18:27] because you have matthew mark luke and
[18:29] john the number four again
[18:31] you have four cherubims around the
[18:34] throne of god
[18:35] around the mercy seat and there's four
[18:36] faces on each one the lion
[18:38] the ox the man and the eagle and matthew
[18:41] is the lion gospel amen so it starts off
[18:45] with the lineage of the king
[18:48] and perfect everything in this bible is
[18:51] perfect amen
[18:52] so we start the beginning showing now
[18:54] we're coming the the covenant the
[18:57] covenant to abraham the covenant to
[18:58] david
[18:59] now we know we have jesus christ amen
[19:01] the son of abraham the son of david
[19:04] why is it jumping around by hundreds of
[19:06] years because he's showing there's two
[19:07] covenants here
[19:08] there's a covenant that abraham's seed
[19:11] shall possess the gates of his enemy
[19:13] shall possess all things and it's really
[19:15] a restoration
[19:16] promise of everything adam lost
[19:20] is given to abraham's seed so christ is
[19:22] coming as abraham's seed
[19:24] and the son of david amen and david was
[19:27] promised
[19:28] that forever you shall have a son sit on
[19:31] the throne
[19:32] so now these two covenants are coming
[19:34] together
[19:35] in jesus christ it's beautiful
[19:39] so this this matthew is the lion
[19:43] gospel it's the coming king gospel
[19:46] and it starts off with the heritage the
[19:48] lineage of the king
[19:51] so then we go the the verse three and
[19:53] judas begot pharas and
[19:55] zerah of tamar and pharaohs begot ezram
[19:58] and ezram begot aram
[19:59] and aram begot a meena dab and a meenada
[20:02] begot nayasan
[20:03] and naasan begot salman and solomon
[20:05] begot boaz
[20:07] of rahab and we just went through rahab
[20:10] the harlot of jericho
[20:13] amen and boaz begot obed
[20:17] of ruth amen so this is where we're at
[20:19] now ruth we've talked about tamar
[20:22] we've talked about rahab and now we
[20:24] would like to spend a little time
[20:26] talking about ruth but as we get into
[20:28] ruth
[20:29] you find out that rahab and ruth are
[20:32] tied together in fact they're all tied
[20:33] together this lineage is very linked and
[20:35] we're going to get in
[20:36] to many ways of that in the future maybe
[20:38] not today but
[20:39] in the future but i want to back up and
[20:41] cap off rahab to move
[20:43] in to ruth because you can't you can't
[20:46] understand what's going on a ruth
[20:48] without understanding what happened
[20:49] with rahab and there's there was there
[20:52] was
[20:53] a quote that i just completely missed
[20:55] last time we ministered
[20:57] and i couldn't believe it when i got
[20:58] back and said i missed that and it was
[21:00] my favorite one of the whole message
[21:02] so i'd like to share that with you so we
[21:04] find out when
[21:05] when they crossed over when the nation
[21:08] of israel crossed jordan to go in and
[21:10] possess the land
[21:11] the first obstacle they come to is the
[21:13] great big denomination of jericho
[21:16] and they had confidence in their walls
[21:17] and it says jericho was straightly shut
[21:20] up because of the children of israel
[21:22] none went out and none came in
[21:24] so they really drew their denominational
[21:26] lines and they said we're not going to
[21:27] hear any of your heresy we're not going
[21:29] to hear any of your false doctrine
[21:30] they had shut the doors to the revival
[21:33] to the truth that was coming into the
[21:35] land
[21:36] but it was too late there had been two
[21:38] spies already slipped in
[21:40] brother brennan said it must have been a
[21:41] couple tape boys got in there and played
[21:43] a tape
[21:44] and rahab heard the message and believed
[21:47] and so rahab was given because she
[21:50] believed
[21:51] amen she was given a true token that her
[21:54] whole household could be saved
[21:56] but her household was not automatically
[21:59] saved by her token
[22:01] they had to believe her and come under
[22:03] her token
[22:05] amen it wasn't a magic spell that she
[22:08] had where she could go
[22:09] jingle the token and say oh my family's
[22:12] saved
[22:12] no the instructions were all that are
[22:16] in your household and brother graham
[22:17] said the household of
[22:19] faith and then so she had to get out
[22:22] there and share the message amen
[22:24] and she had to share and they had to
[22:26] believe rahab
[22:29] rahab held the token and in all of
[22:32] jericho now when the spies leave
[22:34] and the spies go out now amen now
[22:38] and all of jericho there's one little
[22:41] humble woman
[22:42] that's holding the secret of salvation
[22:45] from the oncoming judgment
[22:47] and that little woman is holding the
[22:49] secret amen
[22:50] in order to come in order to come to the
[22:54] place where you can be saved from the
[22:56] judgment that's about to strike
[22:57] you had to hear what this little woman
[23:00] had to say
[23:01] and you had to believe her
[23:04] now think of how hard that would be in
[23:06] the day you live in jericho
[23:08] not the mayor not the governor not the
[23:11] priest
[23:11] not the wise men not the scholars the
[23:14] harlot
[23:15] in jericho that everybody knew is the
[23:17] harlot she's now the one holding the
[23:19] secret
[23:20] she's now got the message and a true
[23:22] token
[23:23] and she's telling you the way to escape
[23:25] and pending judgment
[23:26] and you had to listen to the humble
[23:29] little harlot woman from jericho
[23:33] why would we think it's so strange that
[23:35] you have to hear what the bride is
[23:36] saying in this day
[23:38] to escape the appending judgment why
[23:40] would that be so complicated it's
[23:41] already happened
[23:43] i mean there's a humble little woman
[23:45] that's outcast amen
[23:47] amen the denominations are shut up
[23:49] against
[23:50] israel hallelujah
[23:53] but there's a little woman that knows
[23:56] the secret
[23:58] and by faith amen by her expression of
[24:01] faith she was given a true token
[24:03] so that anybody that would come under
[24:05] this token could be saved
[24:08] hallelujah so then we know that they
[24:10] cross over and
[24:11] they circle now they've got to go
[24:13] through the church ages you know so now
[24:14] they circle six times six days
[24:16] they circle once amen one time each day
[24:20] but when they come to the seventh day
[24:22] or the seventh church age there's got to
[24:24] be seven
[24:25] circlings around the city because
[24:29] all seven ages have to be explained in
[24:32] the seventh
[24:34] all that was left off all the mysteries
[24:37] and everything that the reformers had
[24:38] left off through the church ages
[24:40] now has to be explained so around we go
[24:44] seven times amen tying together all the
[24:47] loose ends from
[24:48] all the previous church ages in the
[24:50] seventh and after
[24:52] seven times around then the seven
[24:54] priests
[24:55] with the seven trumpets all blow
[24:57] together as one blast
[25:02] and then the walls come crashing then
[25:03] the people shout join them and shout
[25:05] and then the walls come crashing down
[25:08] but this is the quote that i wanted to
[25:10] share with you
[25:12] and i left it off in in 1963 in the
[25:14] seventh seal
[25:15] it says notice but when the seals were
[25:17] announced
[25:18] they were all in one great divine thing
[25:21] to call out a group of people
[25:23] there was one trumpet sound and seven
[25:26] seals were broke
[25:29] see if you go back to joshua 6 and i'll
[25:31] just read it to you
[25:32] joshua 6 20 says so the people shouted
[25:35] when the priests blew with the trumpets
[25:37] and it came to pass when the people
[25:39] heard the sound of the
[25:41] trumpet when they were all to bless
[25:45] all seven priests amen representing the
[25:48] seven church age messengers
[25:49] because each church aged messenger
[25:51] sounded a trumpet
[25:53] brother branham told us they broke a
[25:54] seal they sounded a trumpet when when
[25:56] their message was refused they went off
[25:57] the scene and a plague poured out
[26:00] so now each one sounded the gospel
[26:03] trumpet to gather into elect and declare
[26:05] war
[26:05] spiritual warfare so now we have the
[26:07] seven priests
[26:08] amen all blasting with the trumpet the
[26:11] full
[26:12] the full word from seven church ages all
[26:15] sounding at once
[26:18] and when they they heard the sound of
[26:20] the trumpet and the people shouted with
[26:22] a great shout and the wall fell
[26:24] down flat so the people went up into the
[26:26] city every man straight before him
[26:28] and they took the city so now on the
[26:31] seventh seal he says notice
[26:32] but when the seals were announced they
[26:34] were all in one
[26:36] great divine thing to call out a group
[26:38] of people there was one
[26:39] trumpet sound and the seven seals were
[26:42] broke
[26:43] same thing's happened in our day we've
[26:45] come now and now watch broke down the
[26:47] denominational walls in our life it's
[26:49] the revelation of the seven seals
[26:51] amen those walls are broke flat and what
[26:54] did you have to do
[26:55] for your trinitarian understanding for
[26:57] your false uh your false understandings
[27:00] of the blood and false understandings
[27:02] of baptism and false understandings of
[27:04] godhead what did you
[27:05] have to do for that wall to be broken
[27:07] down in your mind
[27:09] all you had to do was hear the trumpet
[27:11] recognize its jubilee
[27:12] and shout amen the victory all you had
[27:15] to say is amen
[27:16] that's nothing but the truth you didn't
[27:19] have to
[27:20] do anything else you just had to
[27:21] recognize that certain
[27:23] sound and when you recognized the
[27:25] certain sound
[27:26] then you had to amen and shout and
[27:29] rejoice
[27:30] in jubilee with the trumpet and say
[27:32] we're free
[27:33] victory is ours
[27:35] [Applause]
[27:36] and the walls of denomination started
[27:38] crumbling all around us
[27:42] hey amen and then verse
[27:49] 21 joshua 6 goes on to say and they
[27:51] utterly destroyed all that was in the
[27:53] city both
[27:54] man and woman young and old and oxen
[27:56] sheep and ass
[27:57] and the edge with the edge of the sword
[27:59] but joshua had said unto the two men
[28:01] that had spied out the country
[28:03] go into the heartless house and bring
[28:04] out against the woman and all that she
[28:06] hath
[28:07] as you swear unto her this is the part i
[28:11] wanted to get to as we bridge over
[28:13] to the next section
[28:16] brother bram says in the message the
[28:17] token from september of 63
[28:20] so when god's wrath destroyed that big
[28:22] city the token sign held her house
[28:24] safely
[28:26] amen what the sign was on her token
[28:29] or the token was on her house when the
[28:31] rest of the city shook to the ground
[28:33] what was it
[28:34] what was it joshua the messenger of god
[28:37] now listen carefully this next statement
[28:40] god
[28:40] himself recognized his messenger's
[28:44] message
[28:48] that should make you really happy amen
[28:52] god himself recognized
[28:55] his messenger's message
[28:58] and if god amen as he's collapsing walls
[29:02] and bringing down a mighty city
[29:04] if god could hold amen this little house
[29:08] up and preserved while everything else
[29:10] was falling flat
[29:11] under his destruction if he could do
[29:13] that why did he do that for
[29:15] because of the messenger's message was
[29:17] believed by faith in this little house
[29:20] would hold it up and god honored her his
[29:23] messenger's message if god honored it in
[29:27] that day will god honor in this day amen
[29:29] that's why you can stake your soul on it
[29:32] you can rest assured that god will honor
[29:34] this messenger's message amen
[29:36] because god called the messenger god
[29:37] vindicated the messenger
[29:39] god anointed him to preach it's not our
[29:41] job to figure out where he's right
[29:43] and where he's wrong and where he made
[29:44] mistakes it's our job to believe
[29:47] the messenger's message and god himself
[29:50] will honor the messenger's message
[29:54] amen it's not for rahab to say well
[29:57] i think joshua was a little bit wrong i
[30:00] think when those two spies came
[30:01] amen they played that tape there was a
[30:03] little there was a little misstep
[30:04] there my goodness it wasn't her job
[30:09] it wasn't her job to preach it it was
[30:12] her job to believe it
[30:15] it wasn't her job to sort it out it was
[30:16] her job to believe it
[30:19] and she believed it it's not our job to
[30:22] correct the prophet
[30:25] it's not our job to use intellect and
[30:27] understanding
[30:28] in a concordance to correct him
[30:32] hallelujah it's our job to believe
[30:36] believe the message and god
[30:39] will honor his messenger's message
[30:44] that message promises a rapture and a
[30:48] catching away a translation
[30:50] before the first bomb falls
[30:53] you think god's going to fail to honor
[30:55] his messenger's message
[30:57] amen so all i want to do is believe the
[31:01] message
[31:02] stick with the message because god
[31:04] called him vindicated him
[31:06] backed him up told him what to preach
[31:08] revealed the word to him and i'm going
[31:09] to believe it
[31:12] and rest my soul there
[31:16] hallelujah goes on to say why
[31:18] and what in the message why it had to be
[31:20] shepherds from december
[31:22] 64. and another reason i might say
[31:24] notice the babe was born in bethlehem
[31:26] which bethlehem and the hebrew
[31:29] interpretation as we had a couple
[31:30] years ago here bethlehem means house of
[31:32] god's bread
[31:34] and we proved in the scripture he could
[31:36] not come any other place bethlehem was
[31:38] founded
[31:39] by rahab and her husband rahab was a
[31:42] heart at that a general quartered
[31:43] from the israelite army and after they
[31:45] had taken jericho and by faith she
[31:47] believed the message of god
[31:49] in her condition and she was saved this
[31:52] is the part i love
[31:53] by faith she believed the message of god
[31:57] in her condition she didn't have to get
[32:01] out of her condition than believe
[32:03] she believed in her condition as a
[32:06] harlot in the city amen
[32:08] she didn't have to clean her life at
[32:09] first she didn't she believed it amen
[32:12] and she was saved hallelujah
[32:17] and then we know that that afterwards
[32:19] she was taken out of the camp
[32:21] and out of the camp of israel out of the
[32:23] camp with the nomination she separated
[32:25] out
[32:25] and solomon goes out of the camp of
[32:27] israel and he finds her outside the camp
[32:30] and the two are united together because
[32:32] we find christ
[32:33] outside of the camp he went out of the
[32:35] camp we have to come out of the camp
[32:37] and we unite with him outside the camp
[32:40] and now she went from the harlot in
[32:43] jericho
[32:44] to the wife of solomon and solomon
[32:49] by birthright is the next in lineage
[32:53] for the kingly line of judah so judah's
[32:57] moving down first born to first born to
[32:59] firstborn the firstborn
[33:00] he's moving all the way down and now we
[33:02] come to solomon and solomon
[33:04] is the prince of the house of judah and
[33:06] the prince of the house of judah is the
[33:08] one who finds rahab
[33:09] outside the camp and marries her so
[33:11] instantly she
[33:12] changes from harlot to princess
[33:17] hallelujah have you made that change
[33:19] amen
[33:20] have you made that change from
[33:21] denominational or worldly person amen
[33:24] to a princess amen hallelujah it might
[33:27] take in rehab a little bit of time to
[33:29] get accustomed to that but she was going
[33:30] to have to get accustomed to that
[33:32] and quit acting like the harlot and
[33:34] jericho and start acting like the
[33:36] princess in judah because that's who she
[33:38] was
[33:38] and what made her that was marriage made
[33:41] her that
[33:42] she couldn't make herself that all she
[33:44] could do was believe the message when
[33:46] she believed the message
[33:47] amen the message saved her and brought
[33:49] her out of the camp
[33:54] you believe the message the message will
[33:56] save you and bring you
[33:57] out of the camp of men's ideas out of
[33:59] the camp of your own ideas
[34:00] out of the camp of worldliness and
[34:02] that's where you meet christ amen
[34:05] in an invisible union with christ that's
[34:08] where you're
[34:09] changed rahab couldn't say
[34:12] i'm no longer the harlot i'm a righteous
[34:15] woman
[34:16] treat me better treat me with respect
[34:18] she couldn't do that in her own marriage
[34:20] she had no merit that was able to change
[34:23] her condition
[34:24] amen now realize it was faith
[34:27] in the message of god that brought her
[34:30] salvation in the day of destruction
[34:32] and that faith caused her house to stand
[34:34] when all others fell
[34:35] and that faith was what obligated the
[34:38] servants of god
[34:39] to take her and bring her out of the
[34:41] camp
[34:44] and out there she meets solomon
[34:48] the prince of the house of judah and
[34:51] married to him and that's when
[34:54] everything in her life changes
[34:57] do you see yourself yes
[35:00] everything changes now her
[35:04] title changes her characteristics change
[35:08] i don't think someone would stand by and
[35:10] let somebody call his little bride a
[35:12] harlot
[35:13] right i think and brother bam said he
[35:16] was a general in the army
[35:17] i think you would be looking for a big
[35:19] fight
[35:21] if you would bound badmouth rahab from
[35:23] that point on
[35:25] because she wasn't rahab the harlot she
[35:27] was mrs solman
[35:30] miss salman benjuda
[35:32] [Laughter]
[35:36] nobody was going to say anything to her
[35:39] she got preferential treatment
[35:42] then she would come into the land and as
[35:44] joshua would divide the land there was a
[35:45] portion that was given to solomon
[35:47] and that portion that was given to
[35:48] solomon happened to be bethlehem amen
[35:51] and so rahab and her husband founded
[35:53] bethlehem
[35:54] bethlehem is the house of god's bread so
[35:57] out of bethlehem is coming god's bread
[35:59] that's why christ the manna that came
[36:02] from heaven that bread that came down
[36:03] from heaven
[36:04] had to be born in bethlehem how was
[36:07] bethlehem founded
[36:08] it was founded by rahab and solomon
[36:12] now you're starting to see the love
[36:13] letter of the bible come together like
[36:15] never before it's brother man said this
[36:18] is one story
[36:20] it is one story amen so this
[36:23] is why this is why because
[36:27] rahab married solomon and solomon was
[36:29] given the land that's bethlehem
[36:31] because of that that forced caesar
[36:35] to tax the whole world so why was there
[36:38] a taxation on the whole world
[36:40] because rahab and solomon settled in
[36:42] bethlehem that's why there was a
[36:43] taxation of the whole world
[36:46] the whole world is moving according to
[36:48] god's plan
[36:51] uh secular governments are moving to to
[36:56] bring about god's plan
[36:57] amen because christ had to be born in
[37:00] bethlehem
[37:01] because bethlehem was founded amen by
[37:04] this
[37:04] gentile woman who was married to the
[37:07] prince of judah
[37:10] and that was going to force caesar
[37:12] caesar probably didn't even know why he
[37:14] was doing it maybe the circumstances god
[37:16] worked out worked it out to where that
[37:18] was a reasonable choice
[37:19] that made sense and maybe that caused
[37:21] political turmoil in his day
[37:23] maybe there was a section in the senate
[37:25] that was against him in a section that
[37:26] was for him and he had to take a stand
[37:29] and say we're going to do this taxation
[37:31] why does he have to do all this
[37:33] what's happening because the manna has
[37:36] to come
[37:36] from the house of god's bread
[37:40] right in line right where it's supposed
[37:42] to come
[37:44] it's beautiful friends it's beautiful
[37:48] but the band preached in december of 63
[37:50] why little bethlehem
[37:51] and he says and then this rahab after
[37:54] she was spared she got all of her people
[37:56] in
[37:57] everything that was under the cord was
[37:59] saved just like when god in egypt
[38:01] when all was under the blood was saved
[38:03] all was under the scarlet cord was saved
[38:05] all under the blood of jesus is saved
[38:07] all out from under it is lost and is
[38:09] ready for destruction
[38:11] and we find out now in doing this
[38:14] then we understand by history that she
[38:16] courted some general
[38:18] i don't know his name right now in
[38:20] israel and she finally married this man
[38:22] and they settled up there
[38:23] near near this little place and here
[38:26] solomon was one of the founded bethlehem
[38:29] shia gentiles connected with it to begin
[38:32] with a gentile rahab the harlot
[38:34] now we find out that solomon founded
[38:35] this little city of bethlehem
[38:37] and he got boaz and boaz was the one who
[38:40] married ruth
[38:41] and another gentile and we're following
[38:43] this lineage now
[38:44] ruth she got she was a moabite and she
[38:47] married boaz and came into his little
[38:49] city
[38:50] just in barley season oh if we had time
[38:53] this morning
[38:53] to own that i'd i'd owe my wife six
[38:56] dresses because he promised his wife he
[38:57] wouldn't go long
[38:58] he'd buy her a dress i've never made
[39:02] that promise
[39:06] they said now to dwell on the subject
[39:08] naomi represented the orthodox church
[39:10] was
[39:10] went away on the account of a famine
[39:12] went over into the land of moab
[39:14] like the scattering of israel all out
[39:16] among the nations and then she come back
[39:18] she brought back ruth to moabite and she
[39:20] returned just in barley season
[39:22] just the gathering in the first barley
[39:25] that is that gentile church coming to
[39:26] god just at barley season again
[39:29] what a beautiful picture there and then
[39:31] she and boaz
[39:33] being married and their famous son obed
[39:34] was begotten there and
[39:36] also born and then his son great son
[39:38] jesse came from obed
[39:40] there also he begot david his son the
[39:42] king david came out
[39:44] so brother branham is telling the story
[39:45] of bethlehem but he's got to go back to
[39:47] solomon and rahab and
[39:48] then shortly after that you have boaz
[39:51] and ruth and then it comes down to david
[39:54] but he says in the breach
[39:58] now look at the book of ruth gives a
[40:00] beautiful picture of this
[40:02] how boaz and naomi had lost the estate
[40:06] you know you heard me preach on that
[40:07] haven't you raised your hands up if you
[40:09] heard me preach on it
[40:10] boaz had to become a redeemer and he was
[40:13] the only one that could
[40:14] he had to be a kinsmen and near kinsmen
[40:17] and redeemed naomi
[40:18] he got ruth that was jesus boaz typing
[40:21] christ
[40:22] and when he redeemed israel he got the
[40:23] gentile bride
[40:25] so brother branham really quickly there
[40:26] explains the whole book of ruth very
[40:28] quickly
[40:28] he says now it's about a kinsmen
[40:30] redeemer boaz has got to redeem naomi
[40:33] the jewish church and when he redeems
[40:35] naomi he gets the gentile bride and
[40:38] that's what the book of ruth
[40:39] is about amen it's amazing
[40:42] that the book of ruth let's just turn to
[40:44] ruth ruth chapter one
[40:48] it's amazing that the book of ruth is
[40:51] the
[40:52] eighth book of the bible it's gonna tie
[40:55] in very good
[40:56] to the number eight amen
[41:02] let's read ruth chapter 1
[41:08] verse 1. we may not read the entire book
[41:10] but we're going to read
[41:12] quite a few passages there's four
[41:15] chapters in the book of ruth and they're
[41:17] divided out really well
[41:20] in four phases of ruth's journey and
[41:23] we're going to get into that
[41:25] but chapter 1 verse 1 it says now it
[41:28] came to pass
[41:29] in the days when the judges ruled that
[41:31] there was a famine
[41:33] in the land and a certain man of
[41:35] bethlehem judah went to sojourn
[41:37] in the country of moab he and his wife
[41:40] and his two sons and the name of the man
[41:43] was elimelech
[41:44] in the name of his wife naomi in the
[41:46] name of his two sons
[41:48] melon and chileon ephrathites of
[41:51] bethlehem judah and they came into the
[41:53] country of moab
[41:54] and continued there and
[41:58] elimelech naomi's husband died and she
[42:00] was left and their two sons
[42:02] and they took them wives of the women of
[42:04] moab the name of the one was
[42:06] orpah in the name of the other ruth and
[42:09] they dwelt there
[42:10] about 10 years and melon and chileon
[42:13] died also both of them
[42:15] and the women was left of her two sons
[42:17] and her husband
[42:19] so we set the scene here in the book of
[42:20] ruth and we find out that that
[42:22] there was a time of famine in the land
[42:25] amen
[42:26] because this is going to type the church
[42:27] ages really well because the church ages
[42:29] come
[42:30] in a type of famine in the land and what
[42:32] they do is they begin to
[42:34] leave the promised word and the first
[42:36] church age
[42:37] and start adding their own
[42:38] interpretations and own ideas
[42:40] and starting denominations and
[42:42] nicolaitanism and all that begins to
[42:44] come in
[42:44] amen be because they're never to leave
[42:47] that promised land
[42:49] and the church was never to leave the
[42:51] pure word
[42:54] they began to journey out to try to find
[42:56] what bread
[42:59] they left the house of god's bread
[43:03] in a time of famine to go look for bread
[43:07] this is amazing why would there be a
[43:10] famine in the house of god's bread
[43:12] you know it doesn't give us record of
[43:16] anybody else leaving
[43:19] now we realize boaz would have been
[43:22] there
[43:22] solomon or boaz saul and boaz is
[43:25] solomon's son
[43:26] so at the same time this famine is going
[43:28] on solomon may be alive
[43:30] boaz most certainly is alive at that
[43:32] time but
[43:33] they don't leave the land somehow
[43:37] god was able to sustain them through
[43:39] this hard time
[43:40] but elimelech wasn't willing to go
[43:43] through the hardship
[43:44] amen he was looking for an easier way to
[43:47] get bread
[43:48] and so he was willing to leave the house
[43:51] of god's bread
[43:52] to go into moab which is a type of
[43:54] denominations
[43:55] [Applause]
[43:57] and what is the denomination a man
[43:59] adding his own interpretation to the
[44:01] word of god
[44:03] and then what do they do when they have
[44:05] it all figured out and they have their
[44:06] own interpretation then what did they do
[44:08] they built a nice little wall around it
[44:11] so that they don't
[44:12] lose what they found and they don't grow
[44:15] any more from there
[44:19] now we got to be careful because it's
[44:20] easy to say denominations and baptism
[44:22] but we've got to realize we can do the
[44:24] same thing
[44:26] it is so easy for us to do the same
[44:29] thing the same failures the same faults
[44:31] that's happened year after year
[44:32] generation after generation don't think
[44:34] that the devil now after the opening of
[44:36] the seal says i'm not going to touch
[44:38] that bride
[44:38] amen he's going to use the same tactics
[44:40] that have always worked
[44:42] he's going to try the same tactics and
[44:44] where is he working
[44:45] he's trying to work in the elect amen
[44:48] he's not working brother said he's not
[44:50] working in the bar room amen he's not
[44:52] working on the street corner
[44:53] he's trying to disrupt god's plan
[44:58] so you got to be careful that you know
[45:00] god
[45:02] god allows these hard times to come
[45:07] just to test the people god
[45:11] loves to prove his people god
[45:14] loves to prove who's his and who's not
[45:16] who has faith and who does not and we
[45:18] have to remember
[45:18] faith must be tested and a faith that is
[45:22] not tested is a faith that can't be
[45:24] trusted
[45:26] i've got faith i trust in faith we'll
[45:29] find out whether you can trust in your
[45:31] faith when the hard time comes
[45:33] when the testing comes and you had great
[45:35] faith when the testing comes
[45:37] and you run away you didn't have what
[45:39] you thought you had
[45:42] and sometimes god will do that to his
[45:43] children so they realize
[45:45] what i have is not sufficient and i've
[45:48] got a substitute but what i need is the
[45:50] real thing
[45:52] amen so don't don't mourn if you've been
[45:54] there we've all been there amen
[45:56] that's the grace of god to expose that
[45:58] we're standing on a false foundation
[46:00] so that we'll drive to the real thing
[46:02] and say god i'm not going to be
[46:04] satisfied
[46:04] till i get the real thing amen the faith
[46:07] that will endure
[46:08] every trial every hardship every phase
[46:11] of my life
[46:12] has to be founded on faith in god's word
[46:14] amen
[46:15] if i've got an intellectual faith if
[46:17] i've got to hand me down faith amen if
[46:19] i've got faith like i caught the flu i
[46:21] just rubbed off from
[46:22] those around me that's not going to
[46:24] stand the test but i need the one
[46:26] that'll stand the test amen
[46:28] and boaz did not leave the house of
[46:31] god's bread
[46:32] amen in time of famine
[46:35] elimelech did it's amazing
[46:41] brother ben says in kinsmen redeemer
[46:43] from 1960
[46:45] now this story starts out something on
[46:47] the manor as a lovable sweet woman her
[46:49] name was naomi
[46:51] which means pleasant alimonleck was her
[46:53] husband means worship pleasant worship
[46:55] was her family
[46:56] they had a son molon one of the that
[46:59] means sickness and
[47:00] chilean the other meant weary gloomy
[47:02] sadness there was the family
[47:05] and they came a famine in the land of
[47:07] israel
[47:08] and the first mistake a jew ever makes
[47:10] is leave that land
[47:13] god gave them that land when abraham was
[47:15] given that land god told him not to
[47:17] leave that land
[47:18] and when he made a mistake and went down
[47:19] into guerrer got in trouble
[47:21] a jew is never to leave palestine
[47:24] that's his lotted place
[47:27] mother man says in the message the
[47:29] comforter from 61 he said
[47:30] i live by the word jesus said it's
[47:32] written man shall not live by bread
[47:34] alone but by
[47:35] every word that proceedeth out of the
[47:36] mouth of god and this is it
[47:38] and that is given to us as a heritage
[47:40] it's our heritage
[47:42] the word oh god let us think of it in
[47:44] deepness
[47:45] in the deepness of it our heritage our
[47:48] inheritance
[47:49] amen our land is the word of god amen
[47:52] and in the first church age they never
[47:54] should have left it
[47:56] they never should have left it to seek a
[47:58] more clear understanding
[48:01] amen even peter says some things that
[48:04] paul
[48:04] writes are hard to be understood
[48:08] so men wanted a clearer understanding
[48:12] we don't need a clear understanding we
[48:13] need faith to believe it amen
[48:15] and we need a holy ghost revelation not
[48:17] a clear understanding
[48:19] the clearer understanding comes with the
[48:21] holy ghost revelation
[48:22] it is a clearer understanding
[48:26] sometimes we try to substitute the work
[48:27] of the holy ghost by a teaching session
[48:30] or a seminar
[48:31] amen that's not going to do it the work
[48:33] of the holy ghost
[48:34] is to give you a clear understanding
[48:36] [Applause]
[48:38] a revelation and it's amazing brother
[48:40] branham says
[48:41] we're talking about the book of ruth he
[48:43] says when we see it we're going to see
[48:44] the plan of god in there
[48:46] and it's so simple we're gonna wonder
[48:47] how we ever missed it
[48:49] because it's written in riddles amen and
[48:51] when the riddles are revealed you find
[48:53] out
[48:53] it's so simple not complex
[48:57] super simple and it's been laying right
[48:59] there and been breezed over for
[49:01] generations
[49:03] but it's simple so now we find out
[49:08] they go they leave their portion of land
[49:11] that's been given to them
[49:14] amen once god gives it to you
[49:17] he expects you never to leave it
[49:20] that's why sometimes i wonder when
[49:22] people say i got a revelation of this
[49:25] you name the subject whatever it is i
[49:26] got a revelation of this
[49:28] and a few weeks later they're willing to
[49:29] leave that revelation to go to another
[49:31] one
[49:32] if god gives you a revelation don't ever
[49:35] leave it
[49:36] if god gives you a portion of the word
[49:38] he gives you a place to rest
[49:40] don't leave it don't go anywhere else
[49:42] stay right there
[49:44] amen hallelujah
[49:48] so so elima like left looking for
[49:51] easier bread and he went into the
[49:55] denominations looking for
[49:57] easier bread
[50:00] and there see there's consequences for
[50:03] leaving the land
[50:06] amen and there they have two sons
[50:09] and the two sons are named sickness
[50:13] what what brother of him say sickness
[50:19] and weary gloomy sadness
[50:22] sickness and gloominess or sadness
[50:25] the the the reference in my scofield
[50:28] bible says
[50:29] sickness and pining so
[50:33] why did they name their sons sickness
[50:35] and pining
[50:38] why did they name them that name brother
[50:40] branham said there's a lot to a name
[50:43] why did they name them sickness and
[50:44] pining amen
[50:46] i don't know brother bem doesn't say but
[50:48] maybe it has something to do with the
[50:50] hardship
[50:50] in the land because the famine was
[50:53] affecting them
[50:54] amen and they were looking at
[50:55] circumstances not at the promise
[51:00] because if you're looking at the promise
[51:02] amen everything's wonderful everything's
[51:04] joyful
[51:05] amen but everything is going wrong in
[51:07] your life i'm not looking at my
[51:08] circumstances i'm not looking at the
[51:10] scene
[51:11] i'm looking at the unseen i'm looking at
[51:13] the promise and everything is perfect in
[51:15] my life
[51:17] everything i'm going through was
[51:18] ordained before the foundation of the
[51:20] world
[51:20] and it's bringing me into a position god
[51:22] wants me to be in
[51:23] everything in my life is perfect
[51:26] [Applause]
[51:27] the bad days are perfect there's things
[51:30] that god wants me to conquer
[51:31] overcome put under my feet and if he
[51:34] wants me to be an overcomer he's got to
[51:36] give me something to overcome
[51:37] and if he wants me to rise above
[51:39] something there's got to be something to
[51:40] rise above
[51:41] and if he wants something under my feet
[51:43] he's got to give me something to put
[51:44] under my feet
[51:46] and we look at the fulfilling of these
[51:48] promises
[51:49] because it's a promise for us to be
[51:50] overcomers is that right
[51:52] it's a promise for things to be put
[51:54] under our feet is that right
[51:56] so fulfilling the promise god gives you
[51:58] trials and tribulations to keep his word
[52:02] amen you mean this trial
[52:05] yes god's keeping his word
[52:08] so that you can be the overcomer because
[52:10] the promises are to him that overcometh
[52:14] and god wants to make sure you get the
[52:16] promises
[52:17] so you've got to be him that overcometh
[52:20] so now
[52:21] in the in the famine when there's no
[52:23] more view
[52:25] of the promise of god amen there's
[52:28] children that are born in bethlehem
[52:30] that are named sickness and pining
[52:36] hallelujah i say they missed a
[52:39] revelation somewhere
[52:41] something was wrong in the understanding
[52:43] somewhere
[52:45] you're living in bethlehem
[52:49] you're living in the house of god's
[52:51] bread out of
[52:52] bethlehem shall come a governor that
[52:54] shall rule the people
[52:56] you're in the place you're in the place
[52:58] solomon brought rahab amen and built the
[53:01] city
[53:01] off of this great story that's taken
[53:03] place in the house of god's bread
[53:05] and you're naming your children sickness
[53:08] and pining
[53:12] so there's a lack of revelation
[53:16] how are you doing well you know
[53:20] i got problems and things are going
[53:21] wrong and it doesn't seem like
[53:23] anything's going right
[53:25] you're in the house of god's bread
[53:28] you're in christ
[53:29] you're in the word the word has been
[53:30] revealed in this day you're smack dab in
[53:33] the middle of it
[53:33] how can you be talking like that amen
[53:36] you should be saying
[53:37] everything's clicking just right on time
[53:39] god's timepiece is moving just right in
[53:41] my life amen
[53:42] there's some things that i'm going to
[53:43] get to overcome here recently and i'm
[53:45] working on a few more testimonies today
[53:49] hallelujah amen because we've got a
[53:51] revelation we know the truth brother
[53:53] madam's told us these things they're not
[53:54] mysteries to us
[53:55] anymore they're absolute facts in our
[53:58] life we know that nothing happens to a
[54:00] child of god unless it first crosses
[54:02] god's sacred desk and he signs off on it
[54:04] amen there's nothing happening to you
[54:06] that god has not permitted to happen to
[54:09] you
[54:09] and it's all for the kingdom of god
[54:14] so with that revelation we don't have
[54:16] problems we've got victories in motion
[54:19] amen
[54:19] we've got overcoming that's taking place
[54:22] now amen
[54:23] there's going to be mighty things that
[54:24] are taking place
[54:28] don't name your children sickness and
[54:30] binding
[54:32] name them victors and conquerors and
[54:35] overcomers but don't name them sickness
[54:38] and pining
[54:40] hallelujah so now down in the land
[54:43] moving away from the promised land out
[54:46] from where they belong
[54:48] now these boys each marry moabitis girls
[54:52] and so that we know orpah and ruth come
[54:54] on the scene
[54:55] and and melon marries ruth and chilean
[54:58] mary's orpah
[55:00] and we know the father dies then the
[55:02] sons die
[55:04] and so now we come through the first
[55:06] three church ages and now we've come to
[55:08] the dark ages for naomi
[55:11] amen the the three have died she's here
[55:14] in the dark ages
[55:15] nothing's working out but she hears
[55:19] there's bread
[55:20] in bethlehem and god is going to start a
[55:24] restoration process
[55:26] back because there was four insects
[55:30] that ate the bride tree down
[55:33] and brought it right to thyatira to the
[55:35] dark ages where there was nothing left
[55:37] but what was in the root
[55:39] but then through the next three church
[55:42] ages he brings it back
[55:45] then after the church ages he caps it
[55:47] with fruit amen
[55:48] so there's four stages down and there's
[55:50] four stages back
[55:54] so hold on to that number four because
[55:55] we're going to see it here in ruth
[55:57] let's look at ruth one and six
[56:04] and she arose with her daughters-in-law
[56:06] that she might return from the country
[56:08] of moab for she had heard in the country
[56:09] of moab
[56:10] how that the lord had visited his people
[56:12] and living and giving them bread
[56:15] she heard about luther's revival amen
[56:18] the words coming back that just shall
[56:20] live by faith amen
[56:22] and giving them bread wherefore she went
[56:24] forth out of the place where she was and
[56:26] her two daughters-in-law with her and
[56:28] they went on the way to return into the
[56:30] land of judah
[56:32] and naomi said unto her two
[56:33] daughters-in-law go return each to her
[56:35] mother's house
[56:36] the lord deal kindly with you as ye have
[56:38] dealt with the dead and with me
[56:40] the lord grant you that meant that you
[56:43] may find rest
[56:44] each of you in the house of her husband
[56:46] then she kissed them
[56:48] and they lifted up their voice and wept
[56:50] and they said unto her
[56:51] surely we will return with thee unto the
[56:54] people
[56:55] now now let's pay close attention what's
[56:57] happening here
[56:58] there naomi's decided to go back there's
[57:01] now a return
[57:02] to the land a return to the word that is
[57:04] going to take place
[57:06] and in this there's there's two vines
[57:09] there's two women there's two churches
[57:11] there's the false vine and the true vine
[57:13] there's
[57:13] there's there's the the foolish virgin
[57:15] and the true virgin all right
[57:17] and the wise virgin so now she looks at
[57:19] them and says now
[57:20] you stay here amen you stay in the
[57:23] system you stay
[57:24] and all of this i'm going back i've
[57:26] heard there's a restoration going on
[57:27] i'm going back and they both lifted up
[57:30] their voices and wept
[57:32] and they both said we'll go with you
[57:38] amen they both made a declaration
[57:43] we're going with you we want to go back
[57:46] to the word
[57:47] we want to go back to the house of god's
[57:49] bread and they both declared they wanted
[57:51] to go
[57:53] then naomi says in verse 11. well let's
[57:56] let's read it again verse 10.
[57:57] and they said unto her surely
[58:00] not just i'm thinking about it i've
[58:03] considered it
[58:04] it's impossible no surely we will return
[58:07] with thee
[58:08] unto thy people so they both make a sure
[58:11] declaration
[58:12] surely we will return with you unto your
[58:14] people
[58:16] and naomi said turn again my daughters
[58:18] why will you go with me
[58:20] are there yet any more sons in my womb
[58:23] that they may be your husbands turn
[58:26] again my daughters
[58:27] go your way for i am too old to have a
[58:29] husband and if i should say i have hope
[58:32] if i if i should have a husband also
[58:34] tonight and should also bear
[58:36] sons would you tarry for them till they
[58:38] were grown
[58:39] would you stay for them from having
[58:41] husbands name my daughters
[58:43] for agree with me much for your sakes
[58:45] that the hand of the lord has gone out
[58:46] against me
[58:47] and they lifted up their voice and wept
[58:49] again and orpah kissed her mother-in-law
[58:51] but ruth clave under her
[58:54] and she said behold thy sister-in-law is
[58:57] gone
[58:58] back unto her people unto her trinity
[59:02] doctrine
[59:05] my sister in law hath gone back into her
[59:08] people
[59:08] unto her gods return thou after thy
[59:11] sister-in-law
[59:12] and ruth said entreat me not to leave
[59:14] thee or to return from following after
[59:16] thee
[59:17] for whither thou goest i will go whither
[59:19] thou lodgest
[59:20] i will lodge thy people shall be my
[59:22] people and thy god
[59:24] my god where thou diest will i die and
[59:27] there will i be buried
[59:28] the lord do so to me and more also if
[59:31] but death part thee and me
[59:33] when she saw that she was steadfastly
[59:36] minded to go with her
[59:38] then she left speaking unto her
[59:44] i want to tell you this is exactly what
[59:45] god does
[59:48] to the tea this is the hand of god
[59:53] they no doubt love their mother-in-law
[59:57] after so many years of living in their
[59:59] household they would
[1:00:00] they would dearly love them and and
[1:00:02] orpah amen and ruth
[1:00:04] they had made a sure declaration surely
[1:00:07] we will return with you and she tried to
[1:00:09] get him to stay back she goes return to
[1:00:11] your mother's house
[1:00:12] the lord deal kindly with you for the
[1:00:13] way you've dealt with the dead and with
[1:00:15] me
[1:00:15] and returned back and they both wept
[1:00:18] they they raised up their voice they
[1:00:19] wept
[1:00:20] and they said surely we will return with
[1:00:22] you into the land
[1:00:24] but then naomi starts to describe the
[1:00:27] hardship that you'll have to suffer
[1:00:31] i don't have any more husbands for you
[1:00:33] to marry
[1:00:35] if i would have a husband today and i
[1:00:38] should conceive in my old age
[1:00:40] and bring forth would you wait and keep
[1:00:42] from having husbands until they were
[1:00:43] grown and could take you
[1:00:45] well there's no she's saying there's no
[1:00:47] hope for you
[1:00:50] there is no chance for you to have your
[1:00:52] hopes and dreams there's no hope for you
[1:00:54] for marriage there's no hope for you for
[1:00:56] children there's no hope for your own
[1:00:57] family
[1:00:58] naomi is saying it's a hopeless cause if
[1:01:01] you come with me
[1:01:02] you have to die
[1:01:06] you have to give up all your hopes and
[1:01:08] all your dreams to follow after me
[1:01:12] and orpah said i love you kissed her and
[1:01:15] left
[1:01:18] and went right back to her gods
[1:01:22] why because there she could live her
[1:01:24] life
[1:01:25] there she could follow her dreams there
[1:01:28] she could have her successes
[1:01:30] she could marry she could raise children
[1:01:32] she could find
[1:01:33] her own satisfaction in her own desired
[1:01:37] life back there
[1:01:39] but ruth was not that way ruth didn't
[1:01:41] care
[1:01:42] if she never got married again ruth
[1:01:44] didn't care if she never brought forth a
[1:01:45] child
[1:01:46] ruth says where you go i go where you
[1:01:48] sleep i sleep
[1:01:49] where you die i die god do unto me and
[1:01:53] more so if odd but death separate you
[1:01:55] and i
[1:01:56] what was ruth doing she was declaring
[1:01:58] that she was the seed
[1:02:00] orpah was not it doesn't matter what you
[1:02:02] have to go through
[1:02:03] amen when when god called paul and then
[1:02:06] he told ananias
[1:02:07] go tell him what things he must suffer
[1:02:09] for my name's sake
[1:02:11] god let off by projecting the suffering
[1:02:16] and paul said i'll do it well it proved
[1:02:19] it proved that paul
[1:02:21] wasn't a lexied of god and ruth's
[1:02:23] declaration
[1:02:24] do you think ruth had it figured out do
[1:02:25] you think she knew what life was going
[1:02:27] to be like
[1:02:27] she didn't have anything figured out but
[1:02:29] she knew one thing
[1:02:30] something in my heart says this is right
[1:02:33] amen i've got to go back to bethlehem
[1:02:35] i've got to go back to the house of
[1:02:37] god's bread
[1:02:37] and i know it's right amen i don't
[1:02:39] understand it but i know it's right and
[1:02:41] where you go i'll go where you live i'll
[1:02:45] live amen
[1:02:47] your god will be my god where you die
[1:02:49] i'll die
[1:02:53] and naomi says
[1:02:57] when she saw verse 18 when she saw that
[1:02:59] she was steadfastly minded
[1:03:02] to go with her then she left speaking
[1:03:05] unto her
[1:03:07] sometimes you know we wonder why i give
[1:03:10] my heart to the lord and
[1:03:11] i come to the message and i i know that
[1:03:14] it's true and i'm going to go along with
[1:03:16] it i'm going to go all the way
[1:03:17] and all of a sudden everything comes
[1:03:20] against me
[1:03:24] it's trying to find out if you're orpah
[1:03:25] or if you're ruth
[1:03:29] and you realize you're going to start
[1:03:30] losing friends
[1:03:32] and you're going to start losing family
[1:03:35] and people are not going to like you so
[1:03:36] much
[1:03:38] and you're going to be rejected by the
[1:03:40] way you wear your hair and the way you
[1:03:41] dress your clothes and the way
[1:03:43] you want to raise your children
[1:03:47] we're going to find out who's orpah and
[1:03:48] who's ruth
[1:03:51] because orpha will kiss her and say i
[1:03:52] love you
[1:03:54] you've been good to me i think the world
[1:03:56] of you
[1:03:57] you're right you're probably right but
[1:04:00] it's not for me
[1:04:02] and we'll go back to our gods
[1:04:06] ruth couldn't explain it something
[1:04:08] burning on the inside amen
[1:04:11] look at what ruth said i mean ruth
[1:04:13] didn't just say
[1:04:14] she didn't repeat the faith surely i'll
[1:04:16] go with you right
[1:04:18] she already said that it didn't work for
[1:04:20] orpah naomi wasn't going to believe
[1:04:22] surely i'll go with you
[1:04:23] no now she was expressing the deep
[1:04:26] desire in her heart
[1:04:27] where you go i go where you live you all
[1:04:29] live where you die i'll die
[1:04:31] when your god shall be my god
[1:04:35] that was something deeper than ruth's
[1:04:37] mind and it was
[1:04:38] it was deeper than her emotions orpah
[1:04:41] was going to go along because she loved
[1:04:43] her mother-in-law
[1:04:45] but we found out that orpah loved
[1:04:48] herself more than she loved her
[1:04:49] mother-in-law
[1:04:51] and she loved herself more than she
[1:04:53] loved bethlehem
[1:04:54] the house of god's bread but it wasn't
[1:04:57] so with ruth
[1:04:58] ruth had a love that wasn't based off
[1:05:00] what i get
[1:05:04] see we're going to follow this message
[1:05:06] it's going to be the ruth kind of love
[1:05:07] that we've got to have
[1:05:09] because it's not about what i get
[1:05:13] it's about what i know is true
[1:05:18] what in me says this is right and i'm
[1:05:21] willing to give
[1:05:22] my life for it amen if i lose my family
[1:05:24] if i lose my friends
[1:05:26] if i lose my reputation if i lose my job
[1:05:29] whatever i have to lose amen this is
[1:05:32] where i'm going to stay
[1:05:33] regardless of what happens to me because
[1:05:35] it's right
[1:05:38] amen so after that she went through the
[1:05:41] testing phase
[1:05:42] then naomi said okay i won't say
[1:05:45] anything else i won't persuade you
[1:05:46] because when you come to the truth
[1:05:47] you've got to go through a testing phase
[1:05:50] and it's of gone orpah failed the test
[1:05:53] ruth passed the test
[1:05:57] brother benham said in revelation
[1:05:59] chapter 5 in 1961 he says now
[1:06:02] now we want to give one more little
[1:06:04] illustration on the fifth verse here
[1:06:06] and then we'll start over get our sixth
[1:06:08] verse and start off now i want you to
[1:06:10] notice in the plan of redemption how god
[1:06:12] foreshadowed it
[1:06:13] he worked it out perfectly in ruth and
[1:06:15] boaz that's where we ended up last
[1:06:17] sunday
[1:06:18] now i want to begin right here now today
[1:06:20] on ruth
[1:06:22] and boaz now there is four stations
[1:06:25] or four junctions in ruth and boaz
[1:06:29] so remember the number four four
[1:06:31] cherubims
[1:06:32] four faces four gospels for the number
[1:06:36] of deliverance
[1:06:37] judas the fourth son of israel i mean on
[1:06:40] and on and on we could go
[1:06:42] four stages of restoration of the wheat
[1:06:43] plant four stages of restoration of the
[1:06:45] bride tree
[1:06:46] the number four so ruth happens to be in
[1:06:49] four stations
[1:06:51] the first is ruth deciding that's what
[1:06:54] we just read about
[1:06:55] ruth deciding how many ever heard
[1:06:58] me preach the message let's see your
[1:07:00] hand
[1:07:03] well all of you i guess i've heard i've
[1:07:04] had it here and i had it on tapes and so
[1:07:06] forth ruth first
[1:07:08] she had to decide whether she was going
[1:07:09] to go into this land or not with naomi
[1:07:11] she had to make a decision then after
[1:07:13] she got there the next thing she had to
[1:07:15] do was serve in the field of boaz out
[1:07:17] there barefooted gleaning behind the
[1:07:18] reapers serving
[1:07:20] and then after she had found grace in
[1:07:22] boaz's site then she had to wait till
[1:07:23] boaz has done the kinsmen redeemership
[1:07:25] to take back all new and all naomi lost
[1:07:28] in order to bring in ruth
[1:07:29] the moabite and then the next stage is
[1:07:32] ruth rewarded
[1:07:33] so we have ruth deciding ruth serving
[1:07:36] ruth resting
[1:07:37] ruth rewarded you have justification
[1:07:40] sanctification
[1:07:41] the baptism of the holy ghost and the
[1:07:42] holy ghost itself
[1:07:45] amen you have the the stalk
[1:07:48] the torso the shock and the wheat
[1:07:51] you've got the same thing over and over
[1:07:53] again ruth rewarded now watch ruth
[1:07:55] deciding perfectly
[1:07:56] oh if anybody said that the bible isn't
[1:07:59] inspired there's something wrong with
[1:08:00] them
[1:08:01] every word of it's inspired every word
[1:08:03] of it fits right together
[1:08:05] just like a dovetail on a plank it just
[1:08:08] goes perfectly to get
[1:08:09] together like the cogs on a mighty wheel
[1:08:11] turning just
[1:08:12] time to the millionth of a second just
[1:08:14] exactly
[1:08:15] right that's the word of god amen
[1:08:19] brother ben said in the masterpiece 64
[1:08:21] he said now there
[1:08:23] here life was the life
[1:08:26] that was in the husk the stalk the
[1:08:27] tassel the house
[1:08:29] all gathers into the seed and the life
[1:08:31] that was in the stalk
[1:08:32] one went to make the other justification
[1:08:34] made a way for sanctification
[1:08:36] sanctification made a way for the
[1:08:38] baptism in the holy ghost the baptism of
[1:08:40] the holy ghost made a way for the holy
[1:08:41] ghost
[1:08:42] itself to come right down in perfection
[1:08:45] back to the word again
[1:08:46] to manifest itself so we look at ruth
[1:08:49] we're going to see ourselves in the four
[1:08:50] chapters of ruth ruth deciding
[1:08:53] ruth serving ruth resting and ruth
[1:08:56] rewarded
[1:08:58] this is the path of the church ages but
[1:09:00] it's also our path
[1:09:02] we're going to find the same thing
[1:09:08] praise the lord
[1:09:12] so brother bram says here in
[1:09:15] blind bartimaeus from 1959 if you'll
[1:09:17] just stay with the holy spirit stay on
[1:09:19] his hands
[1:09:20] he loves you well enough to come to you
[1:09:22] and bless you and save you
[1:09:23] then stay on his hands don't you
[1:09:26] remember jesus teaching about the unjust
[1:09:28] judge
[1:09:28] how he said i fear neither god nor man
[1:09:30] but the woman torments me day and night
[1:09:32] crying after me how much more will god
[1:09:35] give to them the holy spirit who cry
[1:09:36] after him day and night
[1:09:38] we got faith to believe that god can do
[1:09:40] it and we'll do it let's take hold of it
[1:09:42] and hold on
[1:09:43] just don't let it go stay right with it
[1:09:46] if it don't come now it'll come ten
[1:09:48] minutes later
[1:09:49] hours later two weeks later a month
[1:09:51] later no matter when it comes
[1:09:53] i gotta hold and i'm going to stay with
[1:09:55] it amen
[1:09:56] that was ruth she got a hold of
[1:09:58] something real and then she was going to
[1:10:00] stay with it
[1:10:01] now ruth wasn't just a fly-by-night
[1:10:03] making a quick decision
[1:10:04] ruth had 10 years to watch this
[1:10:09] right ruth had 10 years to watch and she
[1:10:13] watched
[1:10:14] she she no doubt watched the life and
[1:10:16] heard naomi talk about the homeland
[1:10:18] then they only talk about the stories of
[1:10:20] of how that bethlehem was founded amen
[1:10:23] and the stories of jericho
[1:10:24] and the exodus march and what god had
[1:10:26] done in egypt amen this wasn't a fly by
[1:10:29] night a quick decision
[1:10:30] that she had made she had lived in this
[1:10:31] household under naomi
[1:10:33] and these two boys for quite some time
[1:10:36] but it came time for her to make
[1:10:38] her decision remember a lot of the young
[1:10:41] people here are raising the message amen
[1:10:43] they've heard about the exodus they've
[1:10:45] heard about the miracles they've heard
[1:10:46] but there comes a time that you've got
[1:10:48] to make your decision
[1:10:50] and god many times is going to bring you
[1:10:52] to face your decision amen
[1:10:54] and you got to choose am i going to be
[1:10:56] orpah or am i going to be ruth
[1:10:59] amen what's inside of me amen when i
[1:11:02] heard
[1:11:03] man when i heard about the exodus when i
[1:11:05] heard about christ
[1:11:06] when i saw the cloud picture when i
[1:11:08] heard about the opening of the seals
[1:11:10] what's happening inside of me amen
[1:11:13] what's stirring in me and when it comes
[1:11:15] down to decision time amen
[1:11:17] it's something more than just well you
[1:11:20] know i don't want to separate from mom
[1:11:22] and dad
[1:11:22] and you know i've got a lot of friends
[1:11:24] that go there and you know the message
[1:11:26] is probably true
[1:11:27] that's not going to work friends amen
[1:11:29] there's going to come a time that you'll
[1:11:30] end up kissing the message and walking
[1:11:32] away
[1:11:35] but there's got to be something more
[1:11:37] something real
[1:11:38] amen something with life in it something
[1:11:41] that persistence
[1:11:42] something that's got grit something that
[1:11:44] will hold on brother man said
[1:11:45] faith he has muscles and hair on its
[1:11:47] chest is not something that's weak and
[1:11:49] wishy-washy and flips around
[1:11:51] faith says it's mine and that's the
[1:11:53] response ruth had
[1:11:55] you're not going to shake me off
[1:12:00] let's go back to the land orpah says yes
[1:12:02] let's go back
[1:12:04] rue says yes let's go back she says wait
[1:12:07] a minute
[1:12:08] you're not going to have anything you're
[1:12:10] going to lose everything
[1:12:11] orpah says i love you but i'm going back
[1:12:15] to moab and she tells ruth she says your
[1:12:18] sister-in-law is gone
[1:12:19] now you go and ruth says no
[1:12:22] way you
[1:12:25] can't get rid of me we've got to have a
[1:12:29] certain kind of resolve something inside
[1:12:31] of us
[1:12:31] that says no matter how many times i'm
[1:12:33] tested no matter what goes wrong in my
[1:12:35] life no matter how many names that i've
[1:12:37] been called
[1:12:38] how many times i get sick after i
[1:12:40] believed
[1:12:42] how many trips to the hospital doesn't
[1:12:43] change anything i'm
[1:12:45] going to have it because god promised it
[1:12:47] i'm going to stick with the message
[1:12:49] because it's the truth and god's going
[1:12:51] to honor his messenger's message and i'm
[1:12:53] going to be under the true token
[1:12:56] you're not going to shake me off amen
[1:12:58] you get to the point where you say
[1:13:00] god you're not going to shake me off
[1:13:04] hallelujah you think how could you say
[1:13:05] something like that that's what he's
[1:13:07] looking for
[1:13:09] jacob he crossed the river in a time of
[1:13:11] trouble amen
[1:13:12] and he met a man and he wrestled with a
[1:13:14] man all night
[1:13:15] [Applause]
[1:13:16] and he messed messes with the man and
[1:13:18] afterwards he names the place
[1:13:19] penile or pineal or whatever he names it
[1:13:22] which means
[1:13:23] he says for i have seen god face to face
[1:13:27] so this man was god in flesh
[1:13:32] and he wrestles with a man all night and
[1:13:35] it comes to the break of day
[1:13:36] and the man says let me go and jacob
[1:13:40] says
[1:13:40] i will not amen
[1:13:44] who's he talking to
[1:13:47] who's he wrestling with amen if god
[1:13:49] wants to come push me down i'll just
[1:13:51] fall over
[1:13:51] he's not pushing me off of my promise
[1:13:54] amen if god brings a win to try to move
[1:13:56] me off
[1:13:57] i'll resist the wind
[1:14:00] here comes a man wrestling they wrestle
[1:14:02] all night
[1:14:03] amen and he comes to break a day let me
[1:14:06] go
[1:14:09] i will not let you go until you bless me
[1:14:18] maybe this message isn't for you
[1:14:21] maybe you're not a lex seed and maybe
[1:14:23] god won't fill you with the holy ghost
[1:14:26] i will not let go
[1:14:28] [Applause]
[1:14:29] until you fill me with the holy ghost
[1:14:32] what is god looking for
[1:14:34] amen what was it amen that angel didn't
[1:14:37] strike him dead that man did not strike
[1:14:38] him dead that god in flesh didn't kill
[1:14:40] him
[1:14:41] didn't ruin his life he blessed him
[1:14:46] and he changed his name from jacob sir
[1:14:48] planet to
[1:14:49] israel because thou art a prince with
[1:14:51] god because
[1:14:52] thou has prevailed
[1:14:56] who did he prevail over he prevailed
[1:14:58] over
[1:14:59] god when god was trying to shake him
[1:15:01] away and discourage him amen
[1:15:03] who did ruth prevail over ruth prevailed
[1:15:06] over
[1:15:06] naomi when naomi was trying to shake her
[1:15:09] away
[1:15:10] and when naomi says she saw that she was
[1:15:13] steadfast
[1:15:15] minded she left off trying to convince
[1:15:18] her
[1:15:19] maybe god's looking for steadfast
[1:15:22] mindedness
[1:15:24] somebody says you have to accept me
[1:15:29] because i believe it you have to take me
[1:15:32] because i believe it
[1:15:34] i have to be one of them because i
[1:15:36] believe it and i will
[1:15:38] not turn it loose
[1:15:43] and and the story of jacob was in
[1:15:44] genesis 32.
[1:15:48] he says he wrestled with him and he said
[1:15:50] let me go for the day breaketh and he
[1:15:52] said i will not let it go except thou
[1:15:53] bless me
[1:15:55] and he said and then what is thy name he
[1:15:56] said jacob and he said thy name shall be
[1:15:58] called no more jacob but israel
[1:16:00] for as a prince hast thou power
[1:16:04] with god that word power with god
[1:16:09] is not just like like you're really
[1:16:12] strong
[1:16:14] that's endurance and persistence
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:17] you have endurance and persistence with
[1:16:20] god
[1:16:24] hallelujah friends sometimes we have to
[1:16:27] have
[1:16:28] endurance and persistence with god
[1:16:36] praise god i know that's the truth
[1:16:42] your faith will be tested and god wants
[1:16:44] it that way
[1:16:45] he god loves to prove his children
[1:16:48] he's not looking he what is he looking
[1:16:51] for he's looking for character
[1:16:53] what kind of character a character like
[1:16:55] unto his own
[1:16:56] character and what is it it's the seed
[1:16:59] inside that's rising up and saying it's
[1:17:01] mine
[1:17:02] it's mine it's mine where'd that seed
[1:17:06] come from
[1:17:07] came from god god
[1:17:10] when he created the world spoke and he
[1:17:13] had to believe his own words
[1:17:17] so what god operates by faith
[1:17:20] is that right god spoke and he had to
[1:17:23] believe his own word so god operates by
[1:17:25] faith
[1:17:25] it's a law he himself operates by so
[1:17:28] what is he looking for
[1:17:29] christ says when i come into the world
[1:17:30] will i find faith
[1:17:33] what's he looking for he's looking for
[1:17:36] steadfast-minded
[1:17:38] faith hallelujah
[1:17:42] don't shake off so easy god will you
[1:17:45] heal you
[1:17:45] yes it's in the word i'll heal you but
[1:17:48] you're gonna get sicker
[1:17:50] [Laughter]
[1:17:52] the promise is sure you're healed you're
[1:17:54] already healed but you're gonna feel
[1:17:55] worse
[1:17:56] and then we're going to add another
[1:17:58] symptom and another diagnosis
[1:18:01] now what are you going to do now what
[1:18:03] are you going to believe
[1:18:05] lord i went up for prayer i believed you
[1:18:07] were going to heal me i was anointed
[1:18:08] with all
[1:18:08] i kept the word i did exactly what you
[1:18:10] said was going to happen
[1:18:12] and now i got sicker well it must not
[1:18:14] have worked
[1:18:16] i guess i'll just ask the doctor for
[1:18:18] more pills
[1:18:20] no he's going to test you
[1:18:24] to find out if you believe your own
[1:18:26] confession
[1:18:28] do you believe i believe if i've got to
[1:18:32] go back to the doctor 100 times you're
[1:18:34] still going to heal me
[1:18:36] amen if i got to be sick 100 more days
[1:18:39] you're still going to heal me
[1:18:40] because you said so you've promised it
[1:18:42] i've kept your word
[1:18:45] so you're no longer jacob but israel for
[1:18:49] as a prince thou has power with god
[1:18:51] and with men and has prevailed
[1:18:57] sometimes we just have to endure and
[1:19:00] prevail
[1:19:01] with god brother venom said
[1:19:04] i know what it's we're talking about
[1:19:06] this story here and he was talking about
[1:19:08] jacob wrestling he says
[1:19:10] i know what it's like to wrestle with
[1:19:11] god i've done it many a time myself
[1:19:15] praise the lord brother branham had to
[1:19:17] wrestle it out
[1:19:19] but his faith prevailed i want to look
[1:19:23] at
[1:19:23] second kings if we could just skip over
[1:19:25] a couple books to the right to second
[1:19:27] kings chapter two
[1:19:31] let's pop over here and have a quick
[1:19:33] look at something
[1:19:38] i remember under ruth deciding
[1:19:43] she had to make her decision she had to
[1:19:46] operate by faith and she had to be
[1:19:48] steadfast-minded but she was going to go
[1:19:50] into four stages of restoration
[1:19:53] first his decision then serving
[1:19:56] then resting then rewarded but i want to
[1:19:59] look at a similar thing over here in
[1:20:01] second kings 2 verse 1.
[1:20:04] and it came to pass when the lord would
[1:20:05] take up elijah unto heaven by a
[1:20:07] whirlwind
[1:20:08] that elijah went with elisha from gilgal
[1:20:12] and elijah said unto elisha terry here i
[1:20:14] pray thee
[1:20:15] for the lord has sent me to bethel and
[1:20:17] elisha said unto him
[1:20:19] as the lord liveth and as thy soul
[1:20:20] liveth i will not leave thee
[1:20:22] so they went into bethlehem so here
[1:20:25] we're coming to the
[1:20:26] the same thing now you have to realize
[1:20:28] when we get here
[1:20:29] that elijah has already been told by god
[1:20:33] to anoint elisha to be prophet in his
[1:20:36] room
[1:20:37] in his place and he's already walked by
[1:20:39] him when he was plowing with 12 yoke of
[1:20:40] oxen and thrown
[1:20:41] the mantle over him and then elisha left
[1:20:44] and his father and mother he come to
[1:20:45] follow elijah
[1:20:46] so elisha is ordained to be the prophet
[1:20:50] instead of elijah he's the right one
[1:20:54] amen it's already spoken by an angel
[1:20:56] elijah knows elijah's already called him
[1:20:59] already threw the mantle on him to call
[1:21:00] him into the ministry
[1:21:02] now he comes in but now elisha's going
[1:21:05] to go through his testing time
[1:21:08] and elijah says i'm there in gilgal
[1:21:12] and he says i'm going to go to bethel
[1:21:15] you stay here
[1:21:17] now elijah has been the master the whole
[1:21:20] time
[1:21:21] get this elijah is the master
[1:21:25] elijah's the boss elisha's the servant
[1:21:27] elisha is the one who pours water on his
[1:21:29] hands
[1:21:30] he serves elijah when elijah says go
[1:21:34] he goes light says come he comes now
[1:21:37] elijah says
[1:21:38] you stay here elisha says
[1:21:41] not on your life
[1:21:44] as we read it we're going to find out
[1:21:46] why as we move down through
[1:21:50] verse 3 and the sons of the prophets
[1:21:52] that were at bethel came forth to elisha
[1:21:55] and said unto him
[1:21:56] knowest thou that the lord will take
[1:21:57] away thy master from thy head today
[1:22:00] and he said yea i know it
[1:22:04] hold ye your peace
[1:22:07] elisha knew that god was going to take
[1:22:09] elijah
[1:22:10] and elisha was not going to separate
[1:22:13] from elijah
[1:22:15] no matter what elijah said
[1:22:19] ruth was not going to separate from
[1:22:21] naomi no matter what naomi says
[1:22:24] naomi's been the mother-in-law naomi's
[1:22:26] called the shots naomi told the girls
[1:22:28] hey you're fixing dinner tonight hey i
[1:22:30] want you to do the dishes
[1:22:33] and now now the same one who's been the
[1:22:36] matriarch of the home the
[1:22:38] same one who's called the shots in the
[1:22:39] home now is saying go back to your
[1:22:41] mother and say no
[1:22:44] then try it again so go back to your
[1:22:45] mother and and orpha says okay
[1:22:47] and ruth says no
[1:22:51] praise god you got to realize there's
[1:22:53] something in
[1:22:54] a believer that's different than the
[1:22:55] rest of the world there's something in a
[1:22:57] believer that reflects
[1:22:58] back the very nature of god to god and
[1:23:00] god wants to see it and if god's got to
[1:23:02] try to shake you off a little bit he'll
[1:23:04] try to shake you off a little bit
[1:23:06] just like jesus did with the woman who
[1:23:07] had a sick daughter and she comes up
[1:23:09] she's a gentile woman
[1:23:11] comes to the table stands behind the
[1:23:13] lord says lord will you heal my daughter
[1:23:15] and he ignores her as though she had not
[1:23:18] spoken
[1:23:20] orpah would have left
[1:23:23] say well he doesn't want to talk to me
[1:23:26] i prayed but i didn't hear anything back
[1:23:29] i went to the church that day and i said
[1:23:30] lord would you speak to me through that
[1:23:32] preacher so i know it you and i didn't
[1:23:33] hear one thing
[1:23:35] i guess it's not for me i'll go back
[1:23:38] but that woman didn't give up she said
[1:23:40] again lord
[1:23:42] would you heal my daughter and he looked
[1:23:45] at her and he says
[1:23:46] it's not meat to give the children's
[1:23:49] bread to dogs
[1:23:52] he ignored her then called her a gentile
[1:23:54] dog
[1:23:56] and said i can't do it it's not good for
[1:23:59] me to give you the meat
[1:24:02] orpah would have been long gone now here
[1:24:05] comes a ruth test
[1:24:07] here comes an elisha test i'm not
[1:24:10] supposed to give you
[1:24:11] this bread it's not good for me to give
[1:24:13] you what belongs to the children to dogs
[1:24:16] he says yay lord i'm a dog
[1:24:21] but even the dogs get the scraps that
[1:24:23] fall the crumbs that fall from the
[1:24:24] master's table
[1:24:29] and jesus was so blessed by her
[1:24:32] faith that he healed her daughter
[1:24:37] what's he looking for this kind of faith
[1:24:41] this persistent wrestling with the lord
[1:24:44] himself
[1:24:45] to overcome to have power with god and
[1:24:48] man
[1:24:48] and prevail that's what he's looking for
[1:24:51] you wonder why sometimes you pray and it
[1:24:52] goes the opposite direction
[1:24:54] because you've got to prevail you've got
[1:24:57] to hold on
[1:24:58] amen it feels like he's taking 100 miles
[1:25:01] an hour around the curve
[1:25:02] and you're hanging on to dear life and
[1:25:04] it's just your fingertips just holding
[1:25:05] on to the car door
[1:25:06] and what's he trying to do to see if
[1:25:08] you'll hang on
[1:25:11] amen are you persistent are you
[1:25:13] persevering do you believe
[1:25:14] are you here for the benefits are you
[1:25:16] here for the friendships are you here
[1:25:17] for the camaraderie or are you here for
[1:25:20] christ
[1:25:20] [Applause]
[1:25:22] you're here because i'll get a good
[1:25:23] family out of there are you here because
[1:25:24] i'm looking for a good spouse
[1:25:26] why are you here with christ why is it
[1:25:29] for benefits
[1:25:29] or what if you say you're never going to
[1:25:31] get married you're never going to have a
[1:25:33] husband you're never going to have
[1:25:34] children
[1:25:34] it's never going to work out what do you
[1:25:36] want to do
[1:25:38] i'll go back ruth says where you die
[1:25:42] i'll die
[1:25:44] if i have nothing i have if you have
[1:25:46] nothing i have nothing
[1:25:48] i'm going where you're going
[1:25:51] now we come to elijah and elijah and
[1:25:53] elijah's going to be taken up
[1:25:55] and it's testing time for elisha and
[1:25:56] elisha is a type of the bride
[1:26:00] verse 4 and elijah said unto him to
[1:26:02] elisha tarry here
[1:26:04] i pray thee for the lord saith unto me
[1:26:06] to jericho
[1:26:08] the lord sent me to jericho and he said
[1:26:10] as the lord liveth and as thy soul
[1:26:12] liveth i will not
[1:26:14] leave thee so they came to jericho
[1:26:18] it came to the point where elijah
[1:26:20] couldn't fight elisha
[1:26:23] okay if you want to come come
[1:26:26] it come to the point where naomi
[1:26:28] couldn't fight ruth
[1:26:30] it's come to the point where christ
[1:26:32] can't fight his own bride
[1:26:34] he can't shake her off because she
[1:26:35] believes no matter how many wins
[1:26:37] no matter how many times she shakes
[1:26:39] she's still there
[1:26:41] she believes now how many times things
[1:26:43] go wrong she's still there
[1:26:44] she believes
[1:26:52] verse five and the sons of the prophets
[1:26:53] that were at jericho came to elisha and
[1:26:55] said unto him
[1:26:56] knoweth thou that thy lord will take
[1:26:57] away thy master from the head
[1:26:59] i mean it gets worse for elisha elijah
[1:27:02] says go away
[1:27:02] elisha already knows elijah's gonna be
[1:27:04] taken away elijah says you get away
[1:27:06] amen and then they go from gilgal to
[1:27:09] bethel and then all the preachers out of
[1:27:10] beth will come and says you know the
[1:27:12] lord's going to i know i know i know
[1:27:13] leave me alone
[1:27:16] then they go from bethel and he says i'm
[1:27:18] you stay here in bethel i'm going down
[1:27:20] to jericho
[1:27:21] amen you stay behind he says no i'm not
[1:27:24] going to leave thee
[1:27:25] amen and so before they leave all the
[1:27:28] preachers
[1:27:28] amen and bethel come up and say hey you
[1:27:30] know you know that that
[1:27:32] i know i know hush leave me alone
[1:27:35] god's going to make sure there's plenty
[1:27:36] of people to tell you it's not going to
[1:27:38] work
[1:27:39] plenty of people to confirm what the
[1:27:41] lord's already trying to do the lord is
[1:27:42] trying to shake you off
[1:27:44] trying to get to get you to see if
[1:27:45] you're going to hold on to your faith to
[1:27:47] believe it or not
[1:27:47] and all of a sudden you're sick another
[1:27:49] week you're sick another month
[1:27:51] and then everybody in the church has a
[1:27:52] herbal concoction for you
[1:27:59] everybody's got a home remedy or a
[1:28:01] method or a certain doctor or somebody
[1:28:03] amen and all the preachers start coming
[1:28:05] along amen
[1:28:06] not that that's not good and not that
[1:28:08] god can't help you that way but god's
[1:28:09] gonna lead you by
[1:28:10] faith by faith and if there's a vitamin
[1:28:14] or
[1:28:15] a supplement that will help god will
[1:28:16] lead you by faith
[1:28:18] not by experiment
[1:28:21] so now everybody's going to come up and
[1:28:23] you need this and you need that and you
[1:28:24] need this
[1:28:25] and you walk out of church with bag
[1:28:27] loads of stuff that you need
[1:28:29] and sometimes you just need to shake it
[1:28:30] off and believe the first thing he
[1:28:32] dropped in your heart
[1:28:33] that by his stripes i am healed and if
[1:28:35] god gonna lead me somewhere
[1:28:37] through a doctor's end of medicine god's
[1:28:39] going to lead me there
[1:28:42] amen we're not against doctors we're for
[1:28:44] them but in their place by
[1:28:46] faith led of the lord by faith
[1:28:50] elisha goes along and now now
[1:28:53] not only does he have elijah against him
[1:28:57] now all the prophets are telling the
[1:28:58] same thing elijah says stay behind i'm
[1:29:00] not going to lay behind
[1:29:01] he comes over and says you know that
[1:29:02] he's going to go would you all leave me
[1:29:04] alone i believe the word
[1:29:06] i'm staying right here so he goes to
[1:29:09] jericho
[1:29:14] he says yes i know it hold your peace
[1:29:16] verse 6.
[1:29:17] and elijah said in them terry i pray
[1:29:19] thee hear
[1:29:20] for the lord has sent me to jordan. now
[1:29:22] he's saying terry i pray
[1:29:24] he's saying would you please stay here
[1:29:29] what are you going to do elijah's always
[1:29:32] been
[1:29:33] the boss would you please stay here
[1:29:37] elijah said unto them terry i pray there
[1:29:40] pray thee three here for the lord has
[1:29:42] sent me to jordan
[1:29:43] and he said as the lord liveth and as
[1:29:45] thy soul liveth i
[1:29:47] will not leave thee and they too went on
[1:29:50] and 50 men of the sons of the prophets
[1:29:52] went and stood to view afar off
[1:29:54] and they too stood by jordan and elijah
[1:29:57] took his mantle and wrapped it together
[1:29:59] and smote the water
[1:30:00] and they were divided hither and thither
[1:30:03] so that they too
[1:30:04] went over on dry ground and it came to
[1:30:07] pass
[1:30:07] when they were gone over that elijah
[1:30:09] said unto elisha
[1:30:11] ask what i shall do for thee before i be
[1:30:13] taken away from thee
[1:30:15] and elisha said i pray thee let a double
[1:30:18] portion of thy spirit
[1:30:19] be upon me and he said thou hast asked a
[1:30:22] hard thing nevertheless
[1:30:24] if thou see me when i am taken from thee
[1:30:26] it shall be so unto thee
[1:30:28] but if not it shall not be so and it
[1:30:31] came to pass as they still went on and
[1:30:33] talked
[1:30:34] now behold there appeared a chariot of
[1:30:36] fire and horses of fire and parted them
[1:30:37] both asunder
[1:30:38] and elijah went up by a whirlwind into
[1:30:40] heaven and elisha saw it and he cried my
[1:30:43] father
[1:30:44] my father the chariot of israel and the
[1:30:45] horsemen thereof
[1:30:47] and he saw him no more and he took hold
[1:30:49] of his own clothes and rent them in two
[1:30:50] pieces
[1:30:51] he took up also the mantle of elijah
[1:30:53] that fell from him and went
[1:30:54] back and stood by the bank of jordan and
[1:30:57] he took the mantle of elijah that fell
[1:30:58] from him and smote the waters and said
[1:31:01] where is the lord god of elijah and when
[1:31:03] he also had smitten in the waters they
[1:31:05] parted hither and thither
[1:31:06] and elisha went over
[1:31:10] they had a perfect a perfect testing
[1:31:12] ground for elisha the bride
[1:31:14] elijah says i'm in gilgal but i'm going
[1:31:18] from gilgal
[1:31:19] we're going from justification to
[1:31:20] sanctification
[1:31:22] we're going to see there's four stages
[1:31:24] in this journey just like there's four
[1:31:25] stages in ruth
[1:31:26] just like there's four stages of the
[1:31:28] restoration amen
[1:31:30] four stages of deliverance i'm in gilgal
[1:31:32] but i'm going to bethel you stay
[1:31:34] i'm not staying i'm going with you we go
[1:31:36] to bethel
[1:31:37] the lord sent me to jericho you stay
[1:31:39] behind i'm not staying behind
[1:31:42] as the lord liveth i will not leave thee
[1:31:45] then we're in bethel but we're going to
[1:31:47] go to jericho stay behind
[1:31:48] i will not stay behind
[1:31:51] i'm going where you're going then he
[1:31:54] says
[1:31:55] and jericho i'm going to jordan stage
[1:31:57] four
[1:31:59] i'm going to jordan i pray thee
[1:32:02] would you please stay here he says as
[1:32:05] the lord liveth i will not leave thee
[1:32:08] elisha is going to go all the way
[1:32:11] through
[1:32:12] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:32:15] of the holy ghost
[1:32:16] and is going to cross jordan
[1:32:18] supernaturally
[1:32:21] separated out alone
[1:32:25] with elijah to receive
[1:32:29] her commission amen
[1:32:33] they get separated out they went behind
[1:32:36] the veil
[1:32:37] of the jordan river they're beyond the
[1:32:40] veil
[1:32:41] where nobody else is there but them too
[1:32:44] no school of the prophets nothing else
[1:32:46] because the holy ghost made a way for
[1:32:48] the baptist holy ghost made a way for
[1:32:50] the holy ghost itself and now they cross
[1:32:52] the veil of jordan and went into the
[1:32:54] secret chamber
[1:32:55] and now he says if you see me go ask
[1:32:59] what you will
[1:33:00] that's what elisha was looking for the
[1:33:02] whole time
[1:33:04] for the commission for the promise for
[1:33:06] the mantle to fall
[1:33:08] what mantle the mantle that covered the
[1:33:10] holy ghost that covered elijah for that
[1:33:12] same mantle to fall back on elijah
[1:33:16] there was already a promise when he
[1:33:18] called him he threw the mantle over his
[1:33:19] shoulders amen
[1:33:20] but now he's looking for it across the
[1:33:24] veil
[1:33:26] he goes to jordan he says you see me go
[1:33:28] up that's what you really says i want a
[1:33:30] double
[1:33:31] portion what do you think the bride gets
[1:33:36] when the capstone comes with shoutings
[1:33:38] of grace
[1:33:40] grace you've got double grace
[1:33:43] there's a double portion coming to the
[1:33:45] bride and now
[1:33:46] now the mantle falls he goes back
[1:33:50] now the elisha ministry now the bride
[1:33:53] goes back to jordan
[1:33:54] and says where is the god of elijah
[1:33:57] with that mantle smacks the water and it
[1:34:00] parts and it crosses on dry land
[1:34:04] see you've got to go through the four
[1:34:06] stages
[1:34:08] and not get shucked off anywhere
[1:34:13] won't you stay here in justification
[1:34:16] i'm not staying in justification i'm
[1:34:18] going to sanctificate
[1:34:19] i want you to stay in sanctification you
[1:34:21] got a clean lie if you've cleaned up
[1:34:22] your life just stay
[1:34:23] i'm not staying in sanctification i'm
[1:34:25] going to the baptism holy ghost well now
[1:34:26] you've got gifts in your life you've
[1:34:28] got tingly sensations you felt the
[1:34:30] presence of the lord want you to stay
[1:34:31] there i'm not staying there
[1:34:32] i want he himself amen i don't want his
[1:34:36] gifts amen i don't want just his gifts i
[1:34:38] don't want just his friends i want
[1:34:39] he himself
[1:34:44] hallelujah and ruth wasn't willing
[1:34:47] to stay behind in moab wasn't willing to
[1:34:50] go back
[1:34:52] where you go i'll go
[1:34:55] where you live i'll live will you die
[1:34:57] i'll die your god shall be my god
[1:35:01] nothing but death shall separate us
[1:35:04] when naomi saw that she was steadfastly
[1:35:07] minded
[1:35:08] she left off trying to convince her
[1:35:12] comes a time where god realizes we're
[1:35:14] steadfastly minded
[1:35:18] we've got to be willing to go through
[1:35:19] the test
[1:35:21] we've got to be willing to endure
[1:35:24] we've got to be willing for somebody to
[1:35:27] try to shake us off
[1:35:32] the devil ever come to you and said you
[1:35:33] know it's probably not for you
[1:35:37] you ever have thoughts that come and
[1:35:39] says well you must not be elect
[1:35:44] what's what kind of response is god
[1:35:46] looking for
[1:35:49] yeah you're probably right
[1:35:54] no whatever i'm going on
[1:35:57] [Applause]
[1:35:58] [Laughter]
[1:36:00] it'll never work for you you're probably
[1:36:02] never going to get what they got
[1:36:04] whatever i'm going anyways
[1:36:07] nothing shall separate me nothing shall
[1:36:09] stop me
[1:36:10] i'll believe this message to my dying
[1:36:12] breath and whatever god reveals i'll
[1:36:14] accept it and i'll walk it and i'll stay
[1:36:16] in it
[1:36:16] until op but death separate me from this
[1:36:19] life of believing this word
[1:36:23] that's what god's looking for friends
[1:36:26] that was
[1:36:27] ruth in her first phase her deciding
[1:36:30] it wasn't an easy thing it wasn't a
[1:36:32] quick decision
[1:36:33] it was a real decision based off faith
[1:36:38] and she committed and when she committed
[1:36:40] she moved into the land
[1:36:43] praise the lord we didn't get nowhere
[1:36:47] but we went a lot of places
[1:36:50] let's all stand man we love you all
[1:36:54] it's good to be home it's good to be
[1:36:57] back we love you all so much
[1:37:04] i think lord willing will probably
[1:37:05] continue on with ruth on wednesday
[1:37:08] so be praying i mean we still have ruth
[1:37:10] serving
[1:37:11] ruth resting ruth rewarded and i was
[1:37:14] super excited about getting me into more
[1:37:16] of it today
[1:37:17] but we'll get into it god bless you
[1:37:19] don't let nothing shake you off of this
[1:37:21] word
[1:37:22] don't don't let circumstances or doubts
[1:37:26] or
[1:37:26] fears or worries shake you off with this
[1:37:28] word if you've not gotten to the place
[1:37:30] that you want to be just hang on
[1:37:32] amen just refuse refuse
[1:37:36] to be denied refuse to give it up
[1:37:39] if you see it in the word and you know
[1:37:41] that it's true
[1:37:42] then hang on to it for dear life and
[1:37:44] refuse to give it over amen
[1:37:47] and it doesn't matter who says what to
[1:37:49] you amen
[1:37:50] it doesn't matter what the school of the
[1:37:51] prophets are saying it doesn't matter
[1:37:53] i'm going to stay with it until until
[1:37:56] what until
[1:37:57] this word comes to pass in my life
[1:37:59] because that's what the bride is doing
[1:38:01] for the translation
[1:38:02] of the body there's a promise that our
[1:38:04] atoms are going to change amen and it
[1:38:06] doesn't matter how many times we try to
[1:38:08] get shook
[1:38:08] off of that promise my atoms are going
[1:38:11] to change
[1:38:13] and i'm going to hold on to it and stay
[1:38:15] with it and confess it
[1:38:16] and believe it until not until the next
[1:38:20] obstacle not until
[1:38:21] i get shook off but until my atoms
[1:38:24] change hold on
[1:38:28] until i'm healed hold on until i'm
[1:38:30] delivered hold on until
[1:38:31] this promise that's promised to me by my
[1:38:34] god
[1:38:35] is come to pass in my life
[1:38:38] there's no quitting no turning back
[1:38:41] i say thank god ruth had something that
[1:38:44] ruth didn't put there
[1:38:48] elisha had something that elisha didn't
[1:38:50] put there
[1:38:52] the gentile woman that come behind the
[1:38:54] table
[1:38:56] of jesus and disciples she had something
[1:38:58] that she didn't put there
[1:39:00] cornelius had something that he didn't
[1:39:03] put there
[1:39:04] he had something that was there before
[1:39:06] the foundation of the world
[1:39:09] and it's only that seed that has the
[1:39:11] ability to hold on to the word
[1:39:13] it's not you and i it's not these hands
[1:39:15] it's not this mind
[1:39:16] it's not our willpower but there's
[1:39:18] something in us that will
[1:39:20] not be denied amen because it's part of
[1:39:23] the word and it's believing the word
[1:39:26] and it'll believe despite all it'll
[1:39:29] believe
[1:39:31] how many believes how many is going to
[1:39:34] lose a few fingernails holding on
[1:39:38] amen let my scars in heaven amen maybe
[1:39:41] it won't be stoning or battling from a
[1:39:43] lion and
[1:39:44] in the coliseum but maybe my scars are
[1:39:47] chipped fingernails from holding on to
[1:39:48] the promise
[1:39:50] when god himself was trying to jerk it
[1:39:52] out of my hands
[1:39:54] you mean god would do that absolutely
[1:39:56] god would do that
[1:39:58] when god himself would try to snatch it
[1:40:00] from me jerk it from my hand

[1:40:03] what you got what you're made of if you
[1:40:05] reflect his character
[1:40:06] and you hold on to it and your
[1:40:09] fingernails are going to be a mess when
