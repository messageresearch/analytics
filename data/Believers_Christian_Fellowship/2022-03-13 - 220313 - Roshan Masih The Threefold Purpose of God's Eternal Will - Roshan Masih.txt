restrictions in the pandemic has shut down travel but now it's starting to open up and we're starting to see some of the brothers come back through and brother roshan is certainly a very good friend of ours one that's been here several times and we've benefited from his ministry so we're excited to have him preaching today he'll also be taking the wednesday night service for us and he's preaching

christ i pray amen may the lord bless you all so it's a privilege to come again and i thank you brother chad and his family for their loving spirit and hospitality and for all of you praying for us and helping the work we are doing there so may the lord bless you all so before we say it i would like to read to scripture from the bible those both scriptures are found in the new testament first i would like to read revelation 22 17 and then we will read from the book of galatians and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that here say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely and another scripture galatians 1 15 16. when it pleased god who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me through his grace to reveal his son in me so may the lord add his blessings upon the reading of his word you may be seated please god bless you again i have few things in my mind i was studying the messages lately and that's what i would like to share with you and i hope that it will be a blessing to all of us and that's about what god is doing now in the present tense we know that whatever god does there is a purpose and there is nothing without the purpose and we are here on this earth to fulfill that purpose and god has called us for a purpose that's what i'm going to preach this morning the eternal will of god's purpose or uh there is a three poor purpose of god's eternal will and that will is revealed to us that his will might be fulfilled in us so we have read here that in the last days bride as she eat the word eat the book she becomes the word and when she become the word whatsoever she speak the spirit is speaking through heart the bride so the bride and the spirit are saying the same thing because they both are one and then we read here paul is saying that when it pleased god who set me apart from my mother's womb so he said he set me apart he chosen me and the purpose that he chosen me is that he may reveal his son in me amen and we know that when god created everything in the beginning in the book of genesis chapter one and two we see the creation of god and a god who is full of wisdom he created everything according to his plan because when god started to create things he had a plan behind it and according to his plan and purpose he started to create things different things god is a creator and he can make everything in one day but he did not create everything in one day he created things in six days and he chose and planned and decided what to make what the and whatever he created it was his own expression the water is his expression he is a water of life when he created tree he is the tree of life when he created flowers he is the road of sharon so everything he created amen was his own expression everything in the universe was expressing him he created a lion before line comes on the earth it was already in heaven and god created something which was already in heaven that line which is in heaven on earth may be the expression of which is in heaven because we see there are four uh cherubims there one is like a man so whatever god was making visible it was an expression of invisible things and then god on the sixth day created man and the bible says god created man in his own image and in his own likeness so now sixth day god created man and man matches him everything god created was god's expression god was showing himself in the animal life through the plant life through the merry life different lives but it was all god he is everything he is the creator and he is the creation everything is he himself his own expression and when man came on the earth it was god's full expression in his own image and in his own likeness and when god created man god rested because now there was something who can practice the authority for god there was some one who can represent him because man was created to express god amen so that was the purpose of man on the earth in the beginning that man will be god's expression and the man may represent god amen that's the purpose god created and when there was a perfect man in perfect unity with god and then god rested that's what when in the millennium reign and now the word has opened to us and we are becoming the word as we eat the word and when we will come into the perfection of in the stature of perfect man then god is going to rest we will be at rest in the millennium so we see that god's purpose in creating man was for man to express god and represent him that is for man to be his expression and his representation this man this means we were created in a way that matches him so that he can enter into us though all his creation is expressing him but the man is created after his own likeness and he can enter into us and we can be full complete expression of god because only the man is after his own likeness and image amen so that's how the bible begins man and god in perfect unity man and god working together and we have six thousand years of history of man and god working together since the creation so we can see that the bible is a book full of christ from genesis to revelation and we can also say that the bible is a book full of men from genesis to revelation so god's great purpose from genesis to revelation is that man and god may come together and work together and we may be his expression representation on the earth from the time of creation god has always been going on he never stopped and he does not want us to be stopped or stagnated or make a line or draw a circle but he wants us to go move further all the time and god is going on going on going on from genesis to to revelation he has never stopped he is working on his goal to achieve it because god created man and the plan was god's plan was that man might be his complete expression but man failed he fell god god could do it in adam and eve but they fell and then god's purpose never defeated so it started with other people from genesis to revelation he is going on to achieve his purpose and want to fulfill his plan the bible says the brabranum said the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible so whole bible is telling us about one goal one purpose and that goal and purpose is god's plan and the entire bible is an expression of that one goal one plan amen and that plan he has he has a plan and according to his plan he created everything and this plan he uh and with this plan he has an aim and a goal and that that plan was a mystery what he wanted to do why he has created everything why he created the universe why he created heavens and all they all declares him but why he did this it was a mystery it never been told to anyone it was in his mind he was all alone in the beginning with his plan with his thoughts and the bible says ephesians 3 9 to 11 and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god so that mystery was hid where it was hidden in him he did not tell to anyone it was hidden in himself he never disclosed he never tell to anyone he kept it secret in himself sometime you also don't tell something to anyone so it is kept secret in you so that's how god kept it secret and that secret was in god's mind he did not tell to anyone the bible says which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the meaningful wisdom of god amen so the bible says according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord so god had a plan had a goal and that was hidden in him he kept it secret since the word began and ephesians 1 8 9 another scripture so i am going to read many scripture and i know that we all love to read the bible amen ephesians 1 8 9 wherein he had abandoned toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself so we have read two verses here ephesians 3 9 11 and ephesians 1 8 9. so the verses of we have read here shows us that god has an eternal plan according to ephesians 3 11 and according to ephesians 1 9 that plan is the mystery of his will that's what i'm going to preach this morning that's what we are talking about he says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself so he had a plan he had mystery and that mystery purpose locked in himself never told to anyone what he wanted to achieve what is his will and this plan is the mystery of his will it is something unknown to man and now i'm quoting christ is the mystery of god revealed there was a mystery that was in the back part of god's mind mind never been to told anyone it was hidden in god and said and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and by the grace of god we will see it this morning in the light of the message of da'awah amen so what is the mystery of god he had mystery and it was hidden in him god's mystery was kept in silence in the times of the ages romans chapter 16 25 now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began so according to the scriptures god has a plan and he wanted to achieve something and that was kept secret it was in silence never been told to anyone so this mystery was hidden in god's heart and was nor to reveal to anyone since the world began the bible says so in the past generation god did not tell people or did not tell anyone the reason why he created all things and the bible says he created all things by jesus christ amen it is ephesians 3 5 but why god created everything by jesus christ ephesians 3 5 but why he created everything he did not tell to anyone he did not open it and ephesians 3 5 says which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men so everything was in his great mind in his thoughts as an attribute and he kept it secret and he appointed a time for it and where according to his appointed time he started to give out this mystery little by little because if you open everything at once our human mind cannot grasp it we cannot take it because god is a great god infinite god eternal and we cannot understand even when we read the message and is talking about behind the curtain of time when it went beyond there so they are telling prabranam many things and he did not know about those things he is still learning there so even when we get there we will learn amen so god started to give out his mystery little by little little by little amen so then paul says roman 16 26 but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith amen so when god started to reveal this mystery little by little then it was made known it was preached the man who caught the mystery but branham said what is the plan when god opened the mystery the seal there is a man messenger the angel of the aid so he caught the mystery and when he caught the mystery then he after he got the revelation he started to proclaim that message to the people so then people knew what god is doing amen that's all god's plan is unfolded in all throughout all the ages little by little so when it was made known it was preached the bible says preach unto the gentiles believed on in the world so god started to give out his mystery little by little he started to give out the mystery to his prophet to his seer to his saints all the people in the old testament and throughout the egypt and god revealed this mystery to paul messenger to the first churches and when god revealed this mystery to paul he was going on the road to damascus and that's where he met the pillar of fire and after that great experience he went to arabia in the desert and one day he was caught up in heaven and they did not tell to anyone after 14 years of his experience he wrote in the bible that i know one man was caught up in third heaven so when he was caught up in heaven god revealed this mystery to him amen ephesians 3 3 2 5 how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery so now the paul is talking as i wrote a four in few words whereby when he read he may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of man as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit and then ephesians 3 9 and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been healed in god who created all things by jesus christ so here we see there was the mystery and god had a plan and that was hidden in god but then god started to give all this mystery and paul received the revelation of that mystery amen and that mystery was hid in god and when god started to reveal this mystery then coalition of colossians colossians 2 2 says that that mystery of god is christ so god's mystery is christ that was his that was hidden in god amen from the work again from the very beginning god kept something secret and he did not tell to anyone and then when it started to reveal to the people it revealed that christ is the mystery collision two two what is christ is the mystery that one god wanted to become a man that was the mystery that was never been to told anyone to two colossians that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love that unto all reaches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ so hence the mystery of god is christ and christ is the mystery of god revealed so the mystery that was hid in god was christ jesus and that mystery was that god will become a man one day he will come into flesh that was never told to anyone nobody knew about it but when it revealed paul caught that mystery and he started to give or to the church because that is the plan of redemption there is someone to receive or catch that mystery and when he catch the mystery seal is open the mystery is unfolded and the angel of the eighth is there to catch the mystery then he proclaimed then he started his message then it is given to the church to the people amen galatians 2 9 4 in him dwelt all the fullness of the godhead burden and i want to put here in in the words of the prophet am i'm going to quote and know earth it not bubranam said whether it is god the father god the holy ghost whether it is the angels principalities powers dominions whatever it is all things run by him all things consist by him he is all the fullness of all things all the fullness of earth all the fullness of heaven all the fullness of god all the fullness of angels all the fullness of time all the fullness of eternity everything dwelt in him amen that's what bubranam said so everything dwelt in him in christ jesus angels god father holy spirit earth heaven eternity time us amen everything so god's eternal will is that all things in heaven and on earth be headed up in christ that's his eternal will that's his eternal power purpose that is what he wanted to achieve in us amen ephesians 1 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in other words christ is to be the head over all things amen when this happens when christ becomes the head over all things then in everything everything in the universe will express the lord that is god's eternal will god's will is for christ to be the centrality of all things and for all things to be subject to christ so that he may be had over all things colossians 3 11 says christ is all and in all he is the principal theme of the entire bible bubranam said if he is the principal theme of the bible he should be the principal theme of our talking of our singing and we know that we are here for his service and he is the principal theme of our gathering here he should be because he is all and in all he is everything he is the principal thief he is the head over everything amen colossians 1 18 that he himself might have the first place in all things that is god's eternal will and purpose that's christ may take the preeminence in us first place in all things galatians 1 18. so i'm reading lot of scriptures yeah and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen he might have the preeminence and concerning this mystery ephesians 3 6 says that christ jesus that in christ jesus the gentiles are we are the gentiles he is the mystery he is the plan of god and he is everything he is all in all and in him we the gentiles becomes fellow heirs and fellow members of the body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel so we becomes the part of that mystery god is amen always working towards this goal and we as we are in christ we becomes a part of christ and we become the little christ amen because we are in him we are his part and he is our part and we are his part ephesians 1 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen when the fullness of time when the fullness of jesus comes he will head up all things in christ jesus the things in the heavens and the things on the earth this means that all things will be gathered together in one place and will be crowned with the name of christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named amen what is the mystery that christ may become our head and he may be all in all that everything must come under his subjection when when god becomes man and he comes in the flesh in the form of jesus christ and once he becomes jesus christ a man god in the flesh then what he is going to do he will gather everything in that person which is in heaven which is on earth everything will be gathered in that person because that person is god we have just read brahmana says that he is the father the father is in him the holy ghost is in him amen he is the fullness of everything and when god becomes man jesus christ then everything will be gathered in him then he will become the head of everything everything will come under his subjection when he comes in the body of jesus christ and that's why the bible says in the name of jesus every knee should bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth philippians 2 10 amen so god's great plan is that everything he will gather up in one in the lord jesus christ that is his great goal great purpose that his great eternal will that's what he want to achieve and that's what he is doing in order to reach this goal he has to go on and on with every step of the lords going on there is always something new but ranam said that gold is expressed in the lives of the believers amen throughout the bible from genesis to revelation everywhere so with people like adam noah abel abraham moses david there was always a new step of the lord's going on because god never stopped from genesis to this day he is working amen jesus said my father is working so his own work he's at work he's working amen so god when god is working he's working in men he needs us god needs people to work god needs our operation that's why god wants to gain us and when he gain us a group of people totally submitted to him then god can choose that person so god worked in christ god what in the apostles god worked in abraham noah eliza moses all the prophets but brahm said in all the believers in their characters he was showing his great purpose his great goal he wanted to achieve amen so god worked himself in different different scenes and in the saints throughout the ages and he is working in us also amen the goal and direction of god's work are absolutely the same it never changed he's god who never changed but the odd word manifestation the outward form of god's word completely different in every age however the principle way content and purpose of god's word are absolutely one and the same message tells us that there is only one work god desires to do through all the israel only one word one goal one purpose the unique work that god has been doing throughout the death is to work himself into us into man when god works himself amen into us what we manifest what we express is different from individual to individual when god worked himself into luther what was manifested through him was justification and when god worked himself into wesley what was the manifestation sanctification and when god worked himself into pentecostal what was manifested through them that was a different manifestation they spoke in tongues amen but everything is doing is a furtherance of the same thing here's the next move next step but every time the expression the manifestation is different in every person or in every eighth amen so god's work in each person is manifested in a different way the same god is working but he is manifested in different ways through different people because god is god of varieties thus we cannot imitate spiritual things but can only follow the inner principle when there is a life life cannot be manufactured life like my children they are the extension of my life so the same life but now in another form and when there is a life it cannot be imitated like if you want to make statue or amazes you can make maybe hundreds of hundreds they can be same and looks alike but when it comes to the life it cannot be the same your children are you are like the extension of the same life but even if you will they cannot be like you they will manifest the same life in different way so god is life jesus christ is life that life is working in us and into us every time god comes in us and he manifests himself express himself in a different way that's why the spiritual things cannot be emitted we cannot imitate or there is always different like what god is doing here is different and what god is doing in india is different same goal same purpose everything but the manifestation is different it is according to the need of the people amen that's why you have to come to the church because you are playing a part and now you preach one sermon maybe 10 times you cannot preach the same sermon though you have notes everything but if you preach here it will be different according to the people and when you preach the same sermon different place it will be different according to the people because people play the part that's why we need to come to the church and when you place your part you get what you expect and god meet your needs according to your need amen so life cannot be imitated life cannot be imitated life cannot be manufactured so god when he started to manifest himself in truth luther it was different manifestation but the same god same purpose same goal but university was different and when brother branham came it was a great healing revival and mysteries was open everything it was same god same purpose same god goal but different manifestation amen so now let's talk little bit about paul because paul the first messenger is saying that god chosen me separated me from the womb of my mother why to reveal his son in me that's why we have been called god has not separated us from our job or our school or our college but god has separated us from the foundation of the word we are chosen in him amen and then he called us so he says when it pleased god who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me through his grace to reveal his son in me amen paul was a great religious person he followed jewish religion a religion which was established ordained and given by god god came down and give the commandments and instruction that was the only true religion on the earth and paul was following that religion and he was so jealous that he do not want to see anyone beside what he believed so he was killing christians persecuting them and one day he met pillar of fire and when that pillar of fire struck him he fell down and because he saw something in heaven and he heard a voice which saying saul saul why you persecuting me why did you persecute me because the source of the voice was in heaven so he asked lord who are you and the lord said i am jesus and in paul's intention and in paul's thinking he was persecuting someone who was on earth and he never though he though he heard that i am jesus to whom you are persecuting but still there is a question how he can persuade someone who is in heaven and the first time god intervened paul god revealed to him that i and my people are one i am one with the believers believers and i are one amen that's what be revealed to paul he caught the visa he received something amen and jesus is saying that if you persuade the believer you persecute me and the poor paul who was a great religious person who was filled filled with all the doctrines all the righteousness whatever because he said am percy is so pharisees he was a sincere person he was following something which was ordained by god but still that was not god's eternal purpose so god intervened many times sometimes we are gathered around some doctrine and we preach those things and we love to talk all those things which are good nothing should say against them but christ is not a doctrine trash is a tricep life what is this message which is given to us he said christ is revealed in his own word what are those seals what is open christ revealed himself so this message we have received is not a bunch of doctrine this is not israel that's why when he's preaching on the seventh seal said don't make any ism leave it as it is because the seventh healing jesus christ himself coming down in us that he may many self himself into us in his own way he's the life but what we did we took something and separated ourselves and this is this this is this those all things are the truth all is truth because truth being given to us through the message and but somebody took little part of the truth and he separated from brethren and somebody took little part of the truth but this whole message amen we have to read the whole book this whole message is good this whole message is the revelation of jesus christ so when we preach something or draw a line then we are stuck we are stagnated and then god comes and intervene that's what happened in in the life of paul he was so religious he was sincere and he was doing following something which was given by god himself but that was a great hindrance for him sometimes good things becomes hindrance things which are related to god things related to christ becomes hindrance when we stuck or when we stop never we should not stop never god is going all the time so we must go with him truth is always marching on amen so when god met paul god revealed that i am one with my people amen and the great hindrance was something which was given by god because they took it as doctrine they took it as a religion this message is not given us to make a religion or doctrine or ism the message is given to live life because this message is life life has been restored in the church that we may express him that's paul says that he chosen me to reveal his son enemy amen so god's revealing of his son to us is in us and not outwardly but inwardly christ's will in us is the center of god's plan god's plan is to reveal christ into you to make christ your life and your everything at one time saul was fully occupied and jealous for the jewish religion the jewish religion we are talking that which was the best religion but that was not god himself god's eternal plan is that god work himself into us amen philippians 3 7 8 and paul says but what things were given to me those icons counted laws for christ those things were good you are doubtless and i count all things but laws for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that i may be in christ so he says i count all those things but done means rubbish that i may win christ paul said i count all those things done what things good things religious things he was so sincere following what was given by god and he said to gain christ i left all those good things i caught them but dunk those good things so we have to see god's plan that he does not want us to make religion only his plan is for us not to make us formal or any kind of religious person but we want us to make christians and branham said christians means christ life a christian is a christ man a man filled with christ a man mingled with christ a man lost in christ amen so that's god's plan is to reveal his son in us so that we can be conformed to the image of his son god's intention and god's plan is not just for us to be religious good spiritual or knowledgeable uh of the scripture but god's plan is for us to be filled with christ to be occupied projected saturated permeated blended and mingled with christ that we may be the full expression of him this is is an is of personal life this is the is to display the token token is christ life has come back in the church and that life must be on display because that's god's will that's what god wants to do in us today is not the age of formalities today is not the age of religion today is the age of the living christ and the living members know the christ in teaching and doctrines by the christ in life the christ as a life-giving spirit that we may become the flow of that life we are not merely fellowshipping concerning uh salvation or spirituality but we are dealing with god's eternal purpose we need to realize that this is our golden time to be used by god the lord needs you as a channel through which he can carry out his move that he may express himself that we may be the full manifestation of his life that's god's purpose we need to realize that we are here for nothing not for any doctrine not for any ism but we are here hundred percent for christ jesus on and when that christ jesus in i is in us amen then we can express him that this message has come to us to recover restore christ himself to be realized by us as everything christ himself is our knowledge our teaching our doctrine our revelation our regulation our form of a gifts of our power everything is christ and that's why prabhanam said when the word is opened those seals are opened he said those seeds are christ himself amen if you have christ you have everything because the christian's life is not a matter of religion of teaching of forms of regulation or of gifts but a matter of christ himself christ in us hope of glory but branham said if you do everything you do everything and missed that life you missed everything you do everything like paul you follow the doctrine you preach the listen you pay ties and you are involved in all the activities church activities preaching whatever if you missed that life you missed everything so that life should be in us that's why the polls paul says but what things were gained to me those i counted laws for christ and i caught them but dang because paul was brought to the realization that the only gain in the universe was christ himself whatever we do on earth our job our authorities our success whatever we do nothing is counter but whatever we do for christ remains forever and ever even a cup of water amen so we see that uh all the things he countered as laws were good things but those things were not christ himself that's why we should always keep ourselves in direct contact with christ then we will be one with christ in reality and when we are one with christ in reality and then when we will meet the people we will not give them any doctrine any forms any regulation but we will give them christ that's why brahmana said i am afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to christ we are getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to christ he is the only one and the only one that has life he that has the son has life amen so when you have that life christ is our life and when we have that life the token in us and when we will meet the people then we will impart christ to them we will give life to them we will not give any doctrine any religion we will impart eternal life to the people because as a believer as a minister our our job is to [Music] bring people close to god as a minister our job because the people think that we are close to god and our job is to bring god closer to the people and then peop bring people close to god that they may be united together that's our job we are not here to represent ourselves we are not here to represent any church we are not here to represent any doctrine anything but we are here to represent christ jesus that was his purpose to bring adam amen that's the greatest thing could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that he said the son of god so when we mingle with him when we are one with him when we are united with the word when he is in him we are in him and he is in us we become the living manifestation of the written word and when we become the manifestation of the word as we receive the word of the earth then we become the manifestation we bring out that life we become the channel the source the flow of that life and then that life is imparted to the people that's what god wants philippians 1 20 and 21 according to my earnest expectation and who that in nothing i will be put to shame but with all boldness as always even now christ will be magnified in my body whether through life or through death for to me to leave his christ that's what paul says paul said that for him to leave was christ this means that we need to leave christ paul's life was to leave christ he lived christ because christ was in him and we cannot leave christ if he is not in us galatians galatians 2 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live that not i but christ lived in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me so we are living christ and this living of christ is for us to magnify him to make him larger in others eyes the christian life is a life that leaves christ i want to quote one quote says and if the life of christ is in the church of christ then it is god to have the character of christ it will produce the life of christ if the life of the spirit of christ is in the church it has to produce that life because the life that is in you makes your character it means the people should see christ in us we christians should live a life that leaves christ and magnifies him because in the book of timothy paul says that they may lay hold on eternal life and that is jesus christ so god's ultimate intention is to work himself into us so that we may express him and represent him however there is only one way that this can be accomplished god must come into us to be our life it cannot be impersonated it cannot be imitated that's what prophet said christ must come in us then become our life today there is a great need for christian to see that god's intention is to make christ life to us that is his eternal will and god is always working on this goal amen and that goal or purpose is in three four let me read the mystery of god righteous the mystery of god revealed what is his threefold purpose manifest himself his self in jesus christ to come into the body by jesus christ number one number two to have the preeminence to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he lived in people number three to restore back eden bring back that which was lost when he brings back eden which was lost then it is for all things to manifest christ so what god is achieving want to achieve prophet said he does these things in three steps first he was all alone and he hid in himself that he wanted to become a man that's jesus christ and but branham said what god was he poured himself into christ that christ may be the full expression and full manifestation of god and when christ jesus came he said son can do nothing except he see the father first doing so christ was in total submission god had preeminence in the body of christ and what god was he poured himself into christ and brother branham says the first part is manifest himself in jesus christ to come into the body by jesus christ and when he came in the body in jesus christ he had preeminence in that body that is the first step god came in christ and then he goes forward because he never stopped that what christ was he poured himself into the church that's our part that's what we are living christ in us that he may have the preeminence in the church in his body of believer that's what we are living now jesus christ in us that he may reveal his son in us that we may become the living manifestation of the written word that we may be his representative on the earth that we may be under his total submission because when he becomes jesus christ he gathered everything which is in heaven and which is on earth in that body in that person in that one place christ jesus amen we are here to fulfill that power that's why i have read revelation 22 17 spirit and the bride say come when christ comes in us pour himself into us then we becomes the final voice to the final is god speaks god manifests himself into us through us he does his own work through us and he speaks through us we become his voice and said his voice is like many water people multitudes that's what we are here for to fulfill the second part to fulfill the second fourth we are living now in the second fourth we are living now in in the second fold of his great plan and purpose and that is his eternal will that we may come under his total submission amen said he needs one person who is totally surrendered and submitted to god he can do much can accomplish much in that one person the problem is we are not manifesting christ instead we are manifesting many other things we are manifesting the society we are manifesting worldly things and there are a lot of things but his eternal will is we may become written epistle we may be the living representation that is why he created adam and then when he take the preeminence in us when we become the world and we are under his total subjection then he takes us and goes to [Music] the malini eden and what he does there then in the millennium he is the head over everything everything is under his subjection in the millennium amen so that is why brother branham said jesus christ is god's threefold purpose jesus christ is god's threefold goal jesus christ is god's threefold mystery jesus christ is god's threefold purpose jesus christ is the principal theme of the entire bible in other words it is for christ to be had over all thing and in this second fold second purpose of his will it is for men to be like christ to have his life and his glory amen and god will eventually reach his goal one day all things will manifest christ so i'm closing before closing i am telling that god came in jesus and he showed the preeminence and then christ came in the church he wanted to show the same kind of preeminence to the world to the people we are his victory he is looking for a church sin cannot stand there virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ a glorious church filled with christ and before he store the eden because the whole bible is in three steps three full purpose three-fold plan three 4 goal god accomplished his plan in three steps and now this is the second step and in this step he want us to come under total subjection and christ may become our head as it is ephesians 4 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ in the millennium all things will be will become subject to him and we are headed up under him everything that he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him so god's plan has to do with the whole universe whole universe everything will come under his subjection in the millennium reign he's the king over everything but before it happens he wanted to show that preeminence that had ship in the body of believers in the church in us he he does not carry this work directly he does not go directly in the millennium but before that there are a bunch of people they are gathered by the message of the hour and they are the one who caught the revelation the mystery of god's threefold purpose god's threefold plan and they know what he wants to done with the world and the word is in them and they give the preeminence to the world they come under total submission to christ so god or jesus christ now in this second world he brings the church which is christ's body under the authority of christ's headship he shows in us that we are in complete submission he shows to satan to the word that we are his voice under the millennium reign he will be the head of everything but before that he wanted to show this in you his headsheet in me because when once he become man then he brings everything under his subjection jesus christ that is his eternal will but the question is is he your head is he the head of your house is he the head of your job is he the head of your life is he the head of your everything do we give the preeminence to god what are our priorities are we in total submission to christ that's what our part that's what god wants to do that he made his life in us and when he does that becomes into that kind of perfect unity then we will go to rest with god so this is very serious question is he the head of whatever we do because that's god's eternal will that he may be the head the church his body he may take the preeminence in us let's pray as we bow our heads you can think about it christ jesus is god's threefold purpose christ jesus is god's threefold mystery now that mystery is in us and we must the bride reveal this mystery which is christ jesus dear heavenly father we want to thank you for your word and we see that great plan which is revealed and unfolded by the message of the hour and we see that this plan is that you want to come in the body of the believer you wanted to have the preeminence in them so lord i pray give us grace to empty ought ourselves and fill us with your holy spirit more and more we want to be your living expression your manifestation on the earth we want to express that life because this is your original purpose that's why the man was created to represent you take the preeminence among us we submit ourselves into your hands and we are thank you we thank you for whatever you are doing in our lives and we pray that your divine purpose your divine will may accomplish in our lives help us lord we thank you for everything lord thank you for this church the congregation and may they come more closer to you in your fellowship and they may be written a pistol read by all men we may magnify your name in whatever we do we want to magnify your name before the people through our lives when they see our lives they glorify you the father which is in heaven and without you we can do nothing and you are that life and your prophet said that life cannot be impersonated we need you lord come in us and use us according to your perfect will and your perfect will may be done in our lives so we commit everything into your hand and take this word and whatever you want to do lord put this word in the hearts of the people because this is the vital need according to the hour the time we are already late help us together bless us together and bless our own coming meetings in the name of jesus christ i humbly pray amen so may the lord bless you and thank you so i give the service back to brothers thank you god bless you [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] let's all stand [Music] i don't know about you but i was greatly edified by the word and i was also challenged amen i you know i want to i've given him my life but i want to give him more of my life i want to go deeper in those things and my commitment to him and my surrender how many of you believe that you died out and gave all to christ but then you find out that there's more to die out to and then you find out there's more to die out to and then as time goes on you find out there's more to die out to well this morning i found out there's more to die out to but you know what whenever i hear it all i want to do is give him everything i really want to die out and i believe you do too i want christ to have preeminence in me it's the call of the age it's the purpose of the second fold it's where we're at it's the cry that's in our heart lord take more of me as i give up more will you take more i believe that's where the bride ought to be not in pride not in arrogance but in that constant saying god i want to die paul said i die daily i want to die daily and i want him to have preeminence if that's the second fold of his great purpose if that's the point that we're at now then there's nothing nothing more important than him having preeminence in you and i there is nothing that supersedes that so that should be the thing that matters most to us in life than anything else not what we'll do next or our job or our plan but the thing that should be front and center and foremost on our mind is god please have preeminence in me and take out anything that's hindering that preeminence i want you to have first place oh i appreciate the lord i appreciate god and i appreciate our brother roshan for yielding to the lord and being an instrument that god can use be praying for him for the service this afternoon with the youth and for wednesday night amen we've got plenty to think about pray about much that we can meditate on but we thank god for his word today amen let's just bow our heads and thank him for the word lord jesus we thank you for being faithful to your promised lord that wherever two or three are gathered you'll be in their midst and we know we were you were here lord and we recognize you in the breaking of bread god we thank you for a call where you called us to come higher lord i'm so thankful that you've not stopped working on us lord and you've never stopped in your great purpose and your plan but that that word is moving on it's moving it's continually moving as you fulfill your purpose and it's moving in each one of us individually day by day lord today there was a great move where you moved us a little further into submission further into death to self further into yielding to you preeminence and lord we're thankful that this word is moving on help us not to miss the moving as you move your bride but let us be step in step with your plan and let us move as you move us lord into a greater submission take us lord take us as individuals take us as a body of believers into your complete control have your way with us and fulfill your purpose in our lives and bless our brother roshan and use him greatly lord restore all that he gave out lord and bless him for the the service that he yielded to us today as being the vessel that you could use we pray to bless him back home and all that his efforts and all that he does bless his church and his family and continue to use him for your glory we yield ourselves into your hand as we part from here let this lesson lord not fade away but may it be deep within us lord and a commitment that lasts our life we ask it in jesus christ's name amen god bless you friends certainly good to be here with you this morning and to
