God bless you all you may be seated just for a little while uh thanks brothers and sisters we are so happy to be this evening again in the house of the Lord and uh it's always a a little task on me to present a report I don't know if I will ever get used to it but we'll be able to try it uh this evening so again as uh most of us here know that I was away for about three three weeks actually 20 22 days in uh in the Congo it's uh in central Africa with brother Bley Williams so we we did get they were planning to go together but we didn't uh travel the same day because uh some hiccups came and uh Lord was able to put us together um just one one day apart so brother Franco okay it's already there that's uh our traditional uh slide for the Congo report so brother burle and I were supposed to leave on a certain Tuesday can remember August 13th and uh before just want to give that before we even get started so we we the the enemy attacks us already uh by Sunday uh brother Bley is calling me in the in the afternoon almost evening that you know what he could not make it on Tuesday because he's a self-employed uh uh contractor construction business he had something to finish up on Tuesday so I had to stay online with the airline companies for almost a couple of hours just to try to accommodate instead of him living on Tuesday he would live on Wednesday and these are three flights different flights schedulings so I had to stay there on on the phone for about a couple of hours on Sunday evening and so we were able to make the change which uh just for one day it cost us an extra $800 more just to Move It from Tuesday to Wednesday so that was on a Sunday so we're able to tackle that so I knew that I was going to be traveling on Tuesday by myself and uh brother Burley would be uh following on Wednesday usually takes about a day and a half to get there I would leave on Tuesday and arrive on Wednesday late late night and he would leave on Wednesday and arrive uh Thursday late night so Monday morning I woke up early I start uh um finishing up my packings so you will be able to see some of my packings afterwards and then um by 11 a.m. a little thought came in my mind Hey go grab the your passport then I can have it ready so I I left my packings in the garage I went to check for my passport I couldn't find it I couldn't find it so uh just uh shook myself out of that I said I don't want to be nervous let me give us maybe another hour I'll go back and try to to find where I put it usually I can remember by memory where I put some uh documents in my in my closet so I couldn't U I couldn't find it and I kept on U packing and then a couple of hours I went back to check I couldn't find it I start combing all the documents I could find all the passport for my entire family but I couldn't find mine so a trial started that Monday afternoon I was shreding said what are we going to be doing because brother Burley we are just uh got his day fixed to be traveling on Wednesday he doesn't know the area he never been there so at least I must I have to be there but now I cannot find my passport so the entire day I combed every place looked almost every place I couldn't find my passport this was from afternoon until night time I called the airline companies I said um cannot find my passport would you be able to at least uh keep reschedule my trip maybe a couple of months later because even if I have to order a new passport it would take weeks I don't know maybe 8 weeks or 12 weeks so I called brother Berle I said brother ble I know that we're going to be canceling this this trip that was around 700 p.m. and uh so it was just uh a hard trial on us so call those uh airline companies please hold on our tickets we'll see what we could do so we prayed together and uh I just know that uh I was going to be back here on Wednesday for service just let everybody know that we couldn't we couldn't make it I I lost my passport and almost at 10: at night when I knew that every every Hope was gone so I I I stopped even packing I said there's no need to to do that so uh it's those things that happened so some something just told me go in one of the the suits in the in the closets I I checked it almost everything I combed everything for some reason I went back to the same suit the second time and I just put my my hand in the pocket I was able to find my passport so it was almost close to 11:00 p.m. so we we I did call brother burle I said I know that we're going to be traveling brother Bley said it's going to be a good good it's going to be good meetings so that's uh what I went through that Monday it was a hard trial so just uh knowing that the enemy was attacking so they we're here and that's uh brother Burley so this is on Thursday so I arrived a day early on Wednesday so he followed up uh on Thursday after we picked him up uh from the airport so we uh we lodged at this brother's home brother Paul every time I go to the Congo he has accommodation so I can stay in his house has a bigger house he probably puts maybe five or six ministers there each in every room so he's a wonderful brother there so that's uh on Thursday and uh so I put this the ministry meaning that I have three sections once uh the ministry preaching and the second um section is uh what the church here and the people have contributed to help other churches in the Congo and the third one is just the charity among orphans and elderly widows and people that are in need so the ministry this is a first meeting we had I don't have too many pictures about the the meetings with brother Bley together but uh this is one of uh the the first meeting we had on a Friday evening at brother Rogers sorry that's the picture there uh brother Roger is on the far left close to me he he's been here twice with his wife he's a minister he's a pastor so we did speak at his church and uh this is the following day I think on a Saturday at the church you can recognize this is the church that uh BCF provided a roof and uh just to finish up the the entire building there so we had a wonderful meetings there on Saturday on Sundays I don't have a PCT I don't have pictures but um after we we got uh brother ble and I was translating we got uh speaking there so is there walk walking up the hill so we dropped him there we had a a car the car could not drive that little Hill there so had to come out uh get out the car could uh the driver could drive by himself and then we had to catch up so he completely worn out there yeah okay and on on Monday so we had um we had uh a day of rest so we went in town and then visited one of my uh biological brother so went to get pictures with some of his uh uh the guards at his place there and then we continued uh the meetings brother berley and I um the following week uh this was on a Tuesday on Wednesday we did I don't have a picture with brother very was speaking since we were at the pulpit so but this is the pastor um he's been in the US before a couple of times I did um interpret for him one time at the the voice of God um in Jeffersonville so we also spoke at his church uh but he he wanted two Services that's the reason I had to stay uh after brother B left to speak at his church on Sunday as well so I didn't want to let us go so then on Thursday we traveled uh to a nor northern northern Province Northeastern province of the Congo it just little video there so getting out of the airplanes um then then we had uh the pastor in town Pastors in town that came to to visit us in the hotel so that's in in town there very I cannot drive there very no it's uh kind of chaotic but uh so that's uh the church we we went to speak first on uh on the following day on Friday so the first two weeks brother Bley kept me busy because I did the the translation so after he left then I was able to to speak with with another translator as [Music] well yeah people are excited by the word of God and then uh that's at brother berle's um room there close to to the lake and uh him and I with the the pastor of the the church the one who invited us who brought in other ministers and these are some of the tablets uh the BCF I don't have probably I should have probably 12 that were given away but I have only a couple of pictures uh tablets with all the full messages uh given to ministers there and then after brother Bley left I did speak to a couple places uh at the this church and also we had um a how would I say outside um reach out um out campaign or something so did speak people came uh was on Tuesday we had uh because we had asked one of the church to call their neighbors so a lot of people uh came we could not contain them in the building so the Church decided to get the the chairs out so people could gather outside so we did speak that uh evening until it was late and um I think over 25 people came uh came and gave their heart to the Lord yeah willing to embrace the message they were from other denominations but they were um me the pastor they said they're seeing clearly that the word of God is uh is the truth of the hour yeah so we stayed there almost until 9:00 so started probably 5:30 until 9:30 that evening and that's still the same place and then uh we did visit brother dooka who has uh this the brother in in the middle there he's preached here at the BCF before maybe 20 years ago 21 years ago I think and uh so we did visit him but uh we didn't put him in the in our schedule we couldn't preach that this church it was too late so next time okay so that's uh Outreach um services and now we go to church support there's a there are a couple of churches that we provided a little funds just to help them instead of being outside under the rain they can just get inside so this is the little place so they have uh 10 roof and uh also the walls um a few people are meeting there twice a week and also on Sunday three times a week I would say a little place there and then there's another church if you remember I spoke to this place in June it was outside so uh the we did provide them with funds to get uh some uh little structure so people could be uh worshiping inside so they're building it uh that's the little place and uh then we had another area um among the refugees there are probably thousands of them so the church uh you remember this one the last time we went so we provided also the church BCF and um all your donations we provided the roof they are working on it and that's how it looks now actually inside and outside much different also provided with the benches sitting benches so people could come and gather inside this is uh uh the pastor and uh one of his deacons there beside that then we go to charity we have a couple of videos on the charity side is uh these among the the orphans and uh the elderly that are sick so that's uh my my room there in the garage so getting up preparing to get uh clothing and to be ship to be taken with me uh in the suitcases I don't take them in the boxes I just take them out of the boxes put in the suitcases and and uh pay for them so some people would recognize this yeah I know Priscilla seol could see that and her brothers and then so we also provided with the funds from the church and the donations the the brothers and sisters are among the the refugees couple of hundreds families we did provide some uh Provisions they they don't have any any income nor resources we did provide things like rice and beans and cooking oil and salt anything that's could be provided to them and probably soap and this is the pastor himself he's doing that with this little Transportation there he could do that maybe 20 times has to drive maybe in the mountains for probably 15 miles one way so has to come with this guy and pick up whatever they can pick go deliver but very um serving when you we were asking him how many are very vulnerable in the church maybe they don't have any means at all that we can focus on those he will tell you my entire church I want everything we we're we're receiving we want to divide to every each individual each family together so very very wonderful for brother so and these are the people that uh brothers and sisters that were lining up just uh before receiving the provisions for their families and uh so and they are all of them very grateful that we were there that you sent us that you did provide for them even in the natural so you provided a food for them and uh and above all the word of God we shared with them they are very very grateful for and um sell them that's a little orphanage was almost couldn't even look at it so we had to renew the paint and just to help some 46 kids in the area there were no parents at all so somebody was able to put them in a shelter so we were uh just trying to give it maybe a little little paint there inside and we also did provide over um 40 beds and 40 mattresses and food and whatever they have need of even uh school supplies because the schooling school is started last week so we were just a little help to them so see the kids sitting in their new beds there and uh so they are there saying hi to you guys and thanking you for sending us there and then there's a this sister um she is a daughter of a of a deacon in a certain Church in the area so she lost her hearing and Her speech when she was 3 years old because she had some kind of infection and then she never spoke and nobody had had helped her to learn the sign language so couple of times I went there I would see her sitting in the congregation in front there but not really moving just staring and then afterward I asked her father the father told me that's her his daughter and asked all her condition so he told me about her condition so what we did a couple years ago I did hire uh a tutor who can teach her a sign language and even teach her how to be able to write and uh I bought her a cell phone months back she but she lost it so I bought a new one with this cell phone she's able to communicate with with her family members now she can put words and she can tell them what she wants what they can communicate now so she's uh much more independent that they didn't even know what she could mean other than broken uh sign language so she she's happy yeah and this these are some of the Widow sisters and I know that some Widow sisters and some brothers and sisters he have uh uh given their donations to them and they were happy to receive some uh clothing and some food so I have a little video there for them I only have one church but we had uh we gave to three churches uh widows sisters we numbered them uh probably 40 47 sisters just to just give them a little smile and uh providing for [Music] them thanks brother Franco for uh taking up the whole load here yesterday other the Frank was working putting those things together I have too many pictures too many videos but just to condense them and Franco is and Sister Amy God bless you for all you do and then from there I went to went also to the um a nursing home um where I did speak to that non Catholic none and I did give her the the tablet for the message I said please read it listen and let me know so that's where we we are there so she's is there she came to just wait for us yeah it's just uh beautiful there when you go but uh she's doing a great job she's there 24/7 for them sometimes they wake up in the middle of the night they just seeing the sacrifice and the love I said you should have more than that should have the message yeah yeah so she's become a friend she said for people that visit there she said every time you come here every all all the the patients are are excited just so you can say a word to them so so I'm giving her the tablet there with the Charger and that's that's you they have to listen to it all right from there we went also so couple of orphanages I didn't put all the videos here but this is one of them also where we we visited those are uh they are from Italy and they are Catholic none they they help the people there watch over the orphans and elderly yeah and then we had a chance because we provided some beddings there for the girls even for the boys so I was able to go into one of the the girls' bedroom I said show me your bed just to make sure that everything was well done so I was sitting in on her bed together so with uh with the N with other kids inside so we're in a one of the the bedroom there so she did her bed bed and uh so we did provide the bed the pillows and the sheets and she was happy that uh we're able to provide that for for other kids as well and then we also did one place brothers and sisters providing for clothing and this is the area that um people have been displaced uh by Wars uh it's you you could just put you can never put your your mind around it's it's just beautiful so we went there and visiting brothers and sisters and we brought them some clothing and some food so they were there were together just letting brothers and sisters that send clothes that they arrived so we're able to to dispatch them to give them [Music] I'm troubled [Music] there so they fit everybody so so everybody got his size or her size yeah okay and beside that we also uh did uh some those Huts were too tiny we did help some of the Believers to get a little maybe accommodated some Huts that would make more sense to them so they can uh they can live inside with their families that's something big but just to help them to to Shelter From The Heat and from the rain and yeah some things like that after you see this we'll read the scripture here you will see that you are rich we are rich not only in uh in in in the cornal way but even in the spiritual way that's why we go there just to share as uh we might read it together this is in the book of Timothy I I finished up with it uh first of Timothy the reason we go there and probably we do what we doing um first Timothy chapter 6 thanks brother Franco chapter 6 verse1 17 says charge them that are rich in this world not only financially or materially but uh the word we have here is very rich for us charge them that are rich in this world that they be not highminded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the Living God who gives us richly all things to enjoy that they do good so Paul is speaking to those uh um um those Rich that they do good that they be they be rich in good works so although we're rich even in words we want to use the words to do good to to to distribute it that they be rich in Good Works ready to distribute willing to communicate laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life so as we go there not only for uh what we're doing for in for the charity as we go in the churches there to share the word of God we have we very rich fed in this place and just seeing what we have if I hold it something will burst within me we can take just a little subject very simple you take up there there are people that in the message but never heard about that and then the confession start opening up and people just receiving birth spiritual birth so we are rich not only materially but spiritually that's the reason we go there to do good works to distribute to communicate meaning to to share the news the gospel the message that we have all right God bless you thanks for U your prayers your love your support your donation thanking our pastor and the vision that he has and all of you guys God bless you again I would never say it enough thank you let's stand and read a portion of the the word and just please pull we have 30 minutes kids go to school tomorrow uh just pull in the 30 minutes something could be said all right let's go to the Book of Genesis chapter 24 should be familiar with this this is uh Abraham Abraham sending Al is or to fetch a bride a wife for his son Isaac let's read through verses then uh Genesis 24 let's read from 50 2455 56 and this is uh elazar speaking and he said unto them speaking to uh Rebecca's family Rebecca's father mother and brother and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the Lord has prospered my way send me a way that I may go to my master and they said we will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth and they called Rebecca and said unto her will thou go with this man and she said I will go let's uh bow our heads and pray together precious Lord we or here father standing father on your promises that one of them said that where two or three are gathered in my name in their midst I will be and Lord we we have come to this Junction of the service father we were able to share uh little in a broken way uh the the trip how you protected and watched over us how father you answered the prayers of your beloved children here father praying for us day and night supporting us holding us father in their hearts and Lord we thank you for all that you have done for for us father and we thank you Lord that you would bless each and every one of them father for all this love you have uh just put within us now Lord we're turning to the reading of the scripture Lord you Al alone are the one who can interpret it for us and give us a portion a morsal of bread this evening that as we will live here father we will know that you have spoken to us and something father could just be beneficial to our walk we love you we thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you may be seated so we're going to be taking a little scripture here um a little title the title is uh the seed bride will be willing it's a lot of will there the seed bride will be willing in the subtitle because this is too big I will go with this man you will see that Abraham and as we we'll read in Genesis 24 Abraham here is sending Eleazar meaning that he God gave him a promise of of a son and the son was born let's read it first so we can get the the the context of it and 24 let's start from the the uh verse one and Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things now as we're reading this chapter 24:1 Abraham is old here and well stricken for the second time for the second time he's been old before he's been well stricken before now he got renewed both now he's old again meaning he knows both side of the of the river so Abraham here is after God has had blessed him had called him he was old before and gave him a promise of a son and then we know how through the the the years Isaac was born now the time came that Isaac had grown up and uh Abraham remembered that his seed was to carry the generation to carry for uh um his his family so he is looking finding to find a wife for his son now he's not calling his son to say hey Isaac you come here I know you are at the age now it's time for you to find a mate for you no Abraham knows the best way to find a wife for his son he's omitting it to a servant the Elder of his servants and the prophet of God says that elzar represent the holy spirit so even as parents when we have our children at the age we can never even say hey I want you to marry this I want you to do this we have an elazar which is the holy spirit it's we are calling on the Holy Spirit dealing with him praying him sending the Holy Spirit you are the one who is entitled to find a mate for my son a for my my my daughter so Abraham is doing that as we we read won't read the whole chapter but we're going to be reading a couple of places and you will find that as now he is making his servant swear to ensure that he does exactly what Abraham wants him to do because Abraham has been in in relationship with his Lord you will see that the servant here is finding more more every time that AB Abraham's Lord is the faithful one so he is sending his servant and bringing him to to take an oath and then the servant Eleazar knowing that he was to make preparation to get the camels to get the jewels to get the bracelets to get everything ready the gold he knew that it would be easier easier to find a woman but his question was he was looking for the woman who would be willing to follow him not follow Abraham not follow Isaac but who would follow him elazar himself we remember that the prophet of God would said get the people to believe you it's always been like that so the the equation here was that elazar is coming let's read it at verse 5 let started four but Thou shalt go unto my country and to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac now Abraham was living in one city where God asked him to go live in where the Canaanites were he couldn't find a wife there for his son so he had he knew that within here there's nothing there's no one who would uh who would be who would be carrying in the seed that has been promised through through me he's sending him to his brother's house five and the servant said unto him per Adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me me that's that's the key the key word there to follow me right so finding a woman was easy because he has too many camels and and and the gifts everybody would all the women would be attracted of the the gifts and the the camels but he knew that the the the the secret the mystery was finding one that would be willing to follow me as I am is I am to listen to whatever would tell her to to to be listening and hearing from myself amen and then we're moving in um let's move to verse 8 and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee that's Abraham talking then thou shall be clear from this my my oath only bring not my th uh thither thither again and the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swear to him concerning that matter 10 and the Serv vant took 10 camels we know he's getting them uh 10 camels of camels of of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to Mesopotamia into the city of nahor and he made his camels to kneel down with without the City by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water the prophet of God says in the evening time that the woman the bride for Isaac was to be found now we he comes to verse 14 excuse me and uh with I it's going to be broken but God knows how was going to take it it it it comes that in the verse 14 we we see that the the servant himself will start praying amen cuz he knew that the task was a Divine task Abraham was following the leading of the Lord now Abraham my master had made me swear so this I I I must be in the line with all his Lord is commanding so he's praying in the 13 He said behold I stand Here by the whe of water in the daughters of the men of the City come out to draw water and let it and let it come to pass that the damsel this is his prayer his request the damsel to whom I shall say let down the picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camel drink also we can we we can say it again that and she shall say drink and she shall say I will give thy camels drink also because the mystery was that the willingness was to come from the woman herself it was the woman herself who was to to reveal what she was willing to do for the camel for this man he he could have asked any woman at the the at the world that evening the woman would not prevent from giving him water they would give him to drink but the key was there was only one who would be able after she gives you water to drink she will also say I will also give water to the camels amen remember that the camels that's the word of God she was serving so the camels all the camels were not drinking the same amount of water they were not drinking the same amount of water some camels could have been probably harsh to to to give water to so she had to pass a test of every word she had to pass a test of every word so meaning that her by her own desire her own willingness she was to give water to each camel they were not drinking the same amount of water but we we'll go to move that quickly to listen to what the prophet of God is uh telling us this is in the message of time of decision so all of this hopefully God will help me to be able to present it as uh as I was uh looking at it so Rebecca after she met this man she had some Revelation from the father that this man is having is carrying something precious the camels were precious Rebecca didn't go to any other gifts that were there bracelet bra bracelets and and other Jewels they were there she could see them maybe on the camels but her her her first thought was these camels a revelation that if I can serve these camel let's read the prophet first in the time of decisions uh preached 1959 the prophet of God says you know we have been forced to make decisions there are times when we have to come to the place where we got to say yes yes or no that's just in human life there's a time where we cannot stand neutral so you will see that as elazar was visiting meeting this Rebecca this beautiful daughter as he he was going there he was searching hunting for a character that's right and this character was going to be reflected in the Free Will of the woman herself the testing was to see whether she is willing not being forced sometimes in the church you have to force somebody to to show him that you have to repent brother don't you see that you did this that you have to repent or a sister but a true Bride s something inside that when something is wrong they detect it by themselves by the free will they know how to detect it and the prophet of God says there's a time where we cannot stand neutral and if God shall permit I don't believe that we will be able to leave this church tonight in the same condition we did when we come into it he said we cannot remain the same and the time had to come for Abraham the great patriarch patriarch and servant of God to make a decision and this decision was that he was to decide just on who his son Isaac that he' waited 25 years for and had received him as one from the dead knew that he was called and separated messenger there was a time come when he had to make the decision so the prophet of God is staring with Abraham showing how Abraham had to make his decision first and then his servant has to make a decision to stay with what Abram said and then the last decision is coming to the woman who has been chosen to be a wife to Isaac and he said you see God Don't Make God don't make all of our decisions there's many times that God doesn't tell his Prophet just what to do talking about Abraham because they have to make the decision if there is a there is no decision that we have to make just wait every move on God then there is no overcoming on our part meaning that in life we've got to make decisions because if we don't make any decision the decision is going to be sh whether we overcome a situation or not the same time decision in in the same message time of decision he said then they said let her make her own decision that's where you stand tonight all of us we know that after we will go back to to 50 uh 2458 when they called Rebecca and they called Rebecca and said unto her will thou go with this man and she said I will go this is after she had already passed the test of giving water to the camels now they came there came a last decision that they have to ask her if she was willing to go because her family wanted her her to stay for 10 more days but be something happened within her that she knew that she had passed all the test that there was nothing else to wait for once this bride has passed the test that she has fulfilled every scripture there's not even one second she will be delayed for the Rapture she will not wait he said that's where you stand tonight make your own decision then they call called Rebecca and said will you go with this man or do you want to stay around a little while to see whether you really want to do it she said I will go she was ready amen her decision was quickly made she knew there's something been leading her so she was led by something that the time she went to give water is the prophet of God said that when the angel the the servant elasa was praying the Angel Beat him 30 minutes ahead and to bring Rebecca on the way as she came there something Supernatural from God inspired her to do what she was doing and to respond exactly the way she responded according to the prayer of the servants she said I will go she was ready her decision was quickly made she knew there's something been leading her she knew something had happened to her and she knew that it was God and she was satisfied so her decision her willingness it was not something forced by anybody it was through the Revelation from God and within that decision she was satisfied she wanted to go quickly oh God if the church could only make that decision right quick I know some of us here maybe or all of us here we've got some decisions to make in life as we're sitting here in our family maybe some family fuse that we have to put things in order or some decisions whatever God is calling us to do God said that there's the prophet of God says that if the church could only make that decision quick and the only way we can make that decision is if we're willing to surrender all to God Amen what a clear-cut decision in the message that their eyes were opened some of them are not in order but who can go Rebecca didn't know what Isaac looked like but it was love anyhow see she didn't know what he looked like she just had to go the type she SE him and loved him she was willing to go anyhow no matter what he looked like in the same message he said Rebecca which was to be the wife of this noted noted promised uh wed son when she was called on the final test so when they were asking her or you're ready to go or you willing to go this was a final test to see if she would be that woman that wife that would be uh going following the messenger to her husband Isaac let me read it again and Rebecca which was to be the wife of a this noted promised waited son when she was called to the final test or of a strange man that she never seen before only she seen the working of the Holy Spirit and when her parents could not fully decide whether she should go with this stranger or not to be uh the wife of a man that she had never seen she was brought to the final test well will get the damsel and let her speak will hear from her mouth whether she will go she will she will go yes or no that's the way it's brought to all the seed of God amen so all the seed of God will come to this final test in our life whether we will follow this word the messenger that's right to take us to Christ whether we will follow every word that this messenger has brought to us it's got to be the prophet of God says it's got to be your mouth declaring it not in private it's got to be your mouth declar Dearing that I believe this message I believe this messenger he was sent for me and you will be doing it willingly it's got to be your mouth God wants to hear from you God wants to hear from you when you declaring it willingly Lord I am willing to follow the messenger this message amen so when she was put to the test she never hesitated a a minute she said I will go she was fully persued that's the people that God can use the people that God can use those are are fully persuaded that this message is the truth and I know it's taking me to my husband Christ and the prophet of God says why she the the Abraham had to only find somebody from his K his Kindred because they were blood relative that's right and the prophet of God is going to be interpreting that for us he said and look quickly as soon as she heard about Isaac before she had ever saw him she said I will go why she was a blood relative to him see thou was Abraham's brother child Isaac and Rebecca were first cousins blood relation showing that the church in the last days will be blood relation to Christ for the very God that predestinated Christ was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world the church itself its name was put on the book before the foundation of the world world and Rebecca as soon as she heard of Isaac there was something in her that pulled her straight to him though she hadn't SE him or nothing she wanted to go by her own choice probably will make it clear so there's always a choice a testing for every seed the prophet of God says it started there with Abraham Abraham himself he was tested he was willing to follow the word of God to the end that's the reason he could even call his his servants Eleazar that what you are about to do for my son to go find a wife for him you have to do it according to what I believe I believe in God Jacob was also tested and the prophet of God says in hearing receiving and acting now we find that the birthright meant everything to Jacob we're going to see how the seed line is always willing and when you are committing yourself to be willing to do something there is always a a reproach for you because you're taking up a responsibility once you said I am willing in whatever you want to be willing to do it's a responsibility you are taking upon yourself so the word is so simple I will but it's heavy in the Declaration it has something Concrete in it he said now he didn't care for nothing this is Jacob for nothing else but that Birthright he didn't care what it cost him if it was a mess of page he was glad to give it to Esau so it is so is it with any man or woman that has been ordained to eternal life that God has called to eternal life is willing to sell out anything of the world to obtain that birth right so Jacob Jacob showed that also he was willing to do anything to get that birth right Moses also brother brother says that Moses when he was in Egypt uh taught by his mother when he tried to kill one Egyptian he ran away he said be because Moses has not come fully to give himself willingly to God but when he met the pillar fire in the burning bush the prophet of God says that therefore Moses Drew up with a willing heart to understand and God spoke to Moses and said said take off your shoes for the ground that you stand on is is Holy Ground Moses removes his shoes and God talked to Moses Moses learned more 5 minutes in the presence of that fire than he than he had learned in 40 years of education and the prophet of God says that then we find after that that Moses after meeting the pillar of Fire Moses then was willing Moses took a decision and when we come to a point that we are willing God can do something with us God can use us so God wanted to show us that the bride the true bride of his son Isaac the true bride of his son the Lord Jesus Christ is going to be committed in commission once she gets to a point that she is willing to give it all amen we know that uh the lamb the prophet of God says now the lamb is a very gent uh gentle little fellow is is speaking about David first he said why did he choose David in the message Shepherd David was always talking about uh Still Waters and Green Pastures he was the psalmist that wrote songs and played on his harp to the glory of God and he must have been something he must have been something about David tending sheep he must have been a real sheep Herer did you notice one time there was a bear run and got one of his sheep and he killed that bear and a lion run in and got one of and he caught that be uh lion by the beard and took a knife and killed that lion see it was sacrificing for his sheep willing is also a synonym of sacrifice we will see that later on if we have a few more minutes and if he was willing to lay down his life for the Sheep he was willing by him willing to lay down his sheep he was sacrificing for the Sheep he was atire of the Good Shepherd he was the son of David you know the real Shepherd the king shepherd and the prophet of God speaks about a little uh a little sheep that was lost somewhere and then he went to pick up that sheep I can read it somewhere here he said and I come by and sin way up about a half a mile was a whole herd of sheep now he he had laid right there and the the crows would have been picking his eyes pretty soon so there was a ship lost there separated from the from the the herd and the prophet of God approached the the the the little fellow he picked him up in the arm he never refused he laid real really quiet I picked him up in my arm first time perhaps a human being had ever had their hands on him but he was gentle he was willing to be led that's the nature of a sheep and the prophet of God say comparing our nature to be the nature of a sheep he was willing to be led he was willing to be helped a Christian should be led I hope you see he was willing not to try to resist or to kick back or to bite Lambs don't kick back they don't bite they just humble themselves we see the same thing when Solomon when David was about to to pass away David calling all his uh the people in his uh in in Palace calling his all his sons he's speaking to to Solomon but God is as Solomon is going to be praying now for God to give him wisdom so he can carry on the the plans of his father David it's going to be in the book of Chronicle we'll see that God is to Chronicles I can read it to 2 Chronicles 7 uh 17 154 for now I have chosen a Sanctified this house that my name that's God speaking that my name be there forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually but God is going to give to Solomon the key for him to succeed for him to inherit All His blessings said and as for thee if thou will walk before me meaning that if you are willing yourself not somebody forcing me not me telling you if you are willing to walk before me as David thy father walked and do according to all that I have commanded thee and shall observe my statutes and my judgment then will I established the Throne of thy kingdom we see the same pattern with Ruth a couple more minutes or just building up we see Naomi headed back to the Homeland after losing her husband and her sons with a two daughters uh daughter in-laws orpa is staying behind she wanted to come but she stopped but Ruth was willing by her own self her own desire to go all the way amen and because God saw that she was willing reserved her a great blessing before her the prophet of God says that Ruth was willing to forsake her Idols willingness to forsake her past life willing to forsake her people willing to forsake everything and return with Naomi no matter what the circumstances was she was willing to go that's the way every man that comes to Christ must first be willing regardless in uh letting off the pressure the prophet of God says that if somebody is being haunted maybe he committed maybe a crime somewhere he didn't intend to he wants to be in in the House of Refuge first has to be willing to go in and even after he comes in they let him in he has to be willing to remain there because if he's not willing to remain there they're going to catch him one day the only time that we're not willing from our free will God sees this as a refusal right in the book of Isaiah it says God told Isaiah 1:18 420 he said come now and let us Rasen together sayith the Lord though your sins be as scth they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as War if ye be willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the land now the opposite of not be willing from God it's a refusal he said but if you refuse meaning if you are not willing anytime we are not willing to serve God we're not from our own will to serve in reality we are refusing right anytime we are not obedient in reality we are Rebels yeah right he said if you be willing in obedient you shall eat the good of the land but if you refuse meaning if you you are not willing amen and re and you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the Lord has spoken only Pharaoh was the one who was not willing you will see that every time God will send Moses to get his people out Pharaoh was not willing and God hardened his heart for that because he knew that he would not letting them go so I'm just skipping here so the prophet of God says that few more minutes maybe 3 minutes he's showing us himself how Jesus Christ who is God himself to save you and me he had to be willing to do that he said he was not obligated no one forced him he was not obligated to do that it was of his own free will that he would come and give his life for you and me and the prophet of God says that he humbled himself and that's what makes him great to me that's what makes him real to me is to think that he was willing to come down here and not be some great somebody take some great name or something like that he made himself humble and be be became a servant to all of them thus my Lord Jesus that's the one I love that's the one I want to give my life entirely to serve him the prophet is willing seeing that the Lord has given himself willingly so that should trigger something in every every seed of God that we should be willing to render him a service even when he was invited to Simon knew what he was what was going to happen there he was still willing to go there he was in where wherever he was invited he would show up willing to go there even one day there was a leper in the Book of Matthew Who Came To Worship Him and say Lord if thou will thou can make me clean he was willing because that was a scripture he said and Jesus put forth his hand and touch him and say I will I'm always willing to help in this evening he's here willing to do anything for you and me amen and the only thing we can do as we stand the time it's broken up it's u in in the the Hebrew chapter the prophet of God says he didn't have to talking about Jesus but he was willing to I'm so glad that so glad of that unto you that our God is willing look what if what if he wasn't longsuffering what if what is the fruit of the spirit love joy uh Faith peace longsuffering that's a part of God that is in you willingness is longsuffering and the prophet of God says that this is a part of God that is within you it's only in Believers the willingness prise God he said and can forbearance forbearing one another's burden forgiving one another is God for Christ's sake forgive you the spirit of God in you make makes you that way and then when God was here on Earth and became you became sin that him taking your sin bore it for you and paid your penalty for it God is longsuffering for bearing our burden something to share but for the time I know that the prophet of God says that speaks about uh uh his friend who was a Deadshot who had a little whistle to bring up uh a baby uh door he said that what when that mother deer who heard a sound of a a baby in trouble when she showed up she was facing the open of uh opening of that that gun she was not afraid the prophet of God says because her baby she thought that her baby was in danger and she was willing to put put her life on the line and that was the nature of God the nature of the children of God they are willing with their own free will to serve their God God bless you let's uh have a word of prayer before brother Chad comes precious Lord we thank you again father this evening that you again gathered with us through the service and Lord we thank you for the time you have allowed us to worship you even

of her that knew it was the only way for her it was right oh I'm so glad God some put something in US amen it's not our willpower our strength or our wisdom We Stand just like Rebecca we didn't know we didn't know she didn't know she didn't go to the well knowing what was going to happen that day she didn't know how she didn't know how to be chosen how to be elect she didn't know when she was watering the camels I don't even think she had any idea and halfway through she might have been like why did I volunteer to do [Music] this but it was God working in her life amen and when when the
