pray amen amen God bless you we're going to have you take your seats for just a minute thank you musicians man I just had a couple of an anouncements and a couple of Updates this want to say I forgot to let you all know that brother Benjamin was going to be preaching for brother Jean kadeema I had it my mind for the end of June not the end of May so I I made a mistake there I always like for us to know so that we could be agreeing with him and praying so that was that was my fault I'm going to try to do better amen just pray for me also uh want to let you know that uh the um uh Church age book Bible study for tomorrow night's canceled there was an email that went out for that uh Lord willing will pick it up next Thursday June 6th and continue on every other week rotation from there uh like I said Lord willing just let you know that the funeral for my mom's husband Butch height will be uh this Friday so this Friday we'll be traveling down we'll be going all day we'll be down from early till late and uh I got a call this afternoon from my aunt my father's sister that my my uh Grandma my dad's side and my grandma lamb is um her health is failing and they're not expecting her to live and so they've called in hospice and so we're in a bit of a trying time as a family so we would just appreciate your prayers uh this is uh my my dad's mother and she's been a grandma that I've been very very close to she's a very dear and precious grandmother to me and if you remember maybe a year ago maybe not quite a year ago I asked you to remember in prayer because she had a problem with that was like a stroke and had a lot of complications the Lord completely delivered her from that and she was able to come back in her right mind she had good health she was spunky and pepy once again and we all had a chance to visit with her over the last several months and it's been the grace of God and we've been thankful for that uh about two or three months ago they found that she had cancer and they were going to do an operation uh to remove her kidney because the cancer was in her kidney but they did another scan and before they did the operation and found that it had spread into the abdomen and then uh to the lungs and they did a biopsy and they found that it was a a um a cancer that had M metastasized and had grown and uh she opted herself not to have any treatment and she's ready to go she's lived a good full life and so she's surrendered to the will of God and and so we're just praying that if this is her time that God will just let her go peacefully with no struggle she's been a good grandma to me the best I said before the best a boy could ever have and so I'm just praying that the Lord will undertake for her and let her pass peacefully from this life to the next and that he'll reward her abundantly for what she's done for our family amen God is good amen so we appreciate your prayers for that amen let's all stand together let's turn to the book of Ephesians chapter 1 man I want to let you know also that brother Emanuel saasu will be leaving for uh Congo tomorrow he'll be gone for just over two weeks he'll be back Friday June 14th so I know we appreciate your prayers and I'd like to have prayer for him with the ministering Brothers before uh we leave here this evening so if I forget that one of you Brothers flag me down amen me we want to welcome all the visitors we know we got a few it seems like uh Arizona has showed up in Lio Ohio this week so there's a couple sisters visiting with sister Mari they're here today and uh they're also from brother Ron Peterson's church so praise God it's good to have Arizona here amen just bring us Sunshine not rain right amen God bless you all let's look here at Ephesians chap 1 verse 9 while we're standing says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself amen God bless you as you take your seats may the Lord bless the word amen I see Cheryl s Martin sister and brother-in-law here God bless you it's good to have you guys here as well amen we have so many visitors sneaking and we have to try to keep up amen uh this is the scripture that we used last Wednesday when I ministered we took the title The Mystery of his will and for tonight I'd like to take the mystery of his will part two I didn't intend to have a part two when I preached part one I thought that was just it it was a standalone message there was some things in my notes that I didn't get to but that's okay that often happens but uh I thought I was done I was off to studying something else and enjoying it but as I was meditating and as I was reading and studying God kept opening it up and bringing me back to the unfinished portion so by the grace of God I pray that he helps us get to that part whatever he wants for tonight so that we can understand the mystery of his will in our lives I'd like to do like we did last time and pick up the context of this back in uh chapter 1 starting in verse three let's go back to verse three and read read through this here blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will this is where it gets really exciting I highlight it every time and I probably will as long as I'm alive and God allows me that he has predestinated us to what to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will that does something for me does something down to the root and core of me that it wasn't what I desired it's what he desired it's not my will it's his will and that's why if he can reveal to us the mystery of his will it'll take all our problems away because the mystery of his will was determined before the foundation of the world and in this day he sent a prophet to open up the mystery or the secret of his will his will was not just for me to come and have an ordinance and be a good boy and try to be a Christian and do nice things on the earth it's much deeper than that amen it's gone far beyond you know Christian denominational teaching his will wasn't to have nice people amen who would reflect his word and be nice on no he he wanted his family amen to be expressed himself to be expressed as a family and come to an adoption amen where he could place them as his sons and daughters and position them with power and authority on this Earth that's the mystery of his will that you're not just here Amen to be a nice person you're here Amen to come into adoption Amen to have his signate ring placed on your finger and the checkbook in your hand to be a son and daughter of God on this Earth that's the mystery of his will praise God and he determined that according to the good pleasure of his will amen verse six to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved I am not trying to get his acceptance he made me accepted in the beloving so thankful in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counil of his own will who's working it out he is that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ amen so so as we look at this we're just doing this just a quick review I'm going over this scripture and a couple uh uh quotes and then we'll launch into this other thought that I have for today as we look into the adoption I I read this quote last time adoption part three from 1960 he he quotes this scripture that we just read in verse 9 he said having made known to us the mystery of his will but he injects another thought he said make known to us the mystery of his will to adopt us according to the good pleasure which he has purposed in himself amen you say I'm trying to make it to the adoption amen he's already determined that you're coming to the adoption that's the Hiser of his will to adopt us amen according to the good pleasure which he has purposed in himself he purposed this himself before the foundation of the world how many understands it I said oh God I want to understand it help me to fully understand it so that it can change my life and have an effect every day of my life in the in the message the seed shall POS the and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy he says just like we find in in the Old Testament testing trying and then placing a son adoption placing the son after he's already a son been born into the family he's a son then he would be tested and tried and raised up by tutors and see how he comes out and then he's placed positionally equal almost to his father now listen this is what we've been this is what we've been predestinated unto this process is what we've been predestinated unto we come into the world spiritually BL mind having spiritual Amnesia with our minds darkened alienated from the things of God because we were born wrong so we were born in sin amen so we come with the sin nature and our minds are darkened to these things amen that's why he must begin to reveal to us the mystery of his will because our mind are darkened to the very purpose why we come on this planet so we come and we try to live a life and we're doing whatever we can do amen we're learning by our senses contacting this world gaining knowledge and understanding by the things we touch and feel but none of that amen is is putting us in contact with what God brought us here for that's just our contact on this Earth to live a fleshly life amen but he sent a message in this day amen he sent his word to us to bring us back in contact with the mystery of his will so that we would know what our purpose is on this planet CU if we don't know what our purpose is we don't know what to do in our lives we don't know what decisions to make because our decision decisions are based on our purpose at least they should be and then that purpose now is when you're awakened and you're born amen when you're born again as a son you're a son you're awakened to the fact that you're a son but now you go into child training now you go into the the the your walk with the tutor which is the Holy Ghost and he tutors you along in the word and he's bringing you through the lessons in life through the tri and tribulations in life and the reason that the mystery of his will is so important to us is because it gives purpose to trials and tribulations cuz if not they just become discouragements to us they become things that that that Whittle away at our at our nerves and they deteriorate our resolve and and before you know it we're all broke down and beat down and crumpled up because we didn't see the purpose in the trials and in the testings we saw a life of of conflict we saw a life of affliction and we begin to feel sorry for ourselves because I've went through this trouble and I've went through that trouble and self-pity comes in and the devil want you to feel sorry for yourself because he doesn't want you to understand the purpose of the trial and if you feel sorry for yourself you've missed the purpose the very fact that we could feel sorry for ourselves because we went through hard times means that we're still stuck in an Earthly realm we're still stuck in a human spirit that we need the spiritual amnes you to break away amen we need the darkness that's we're under to break away so that we can see this trial's never here to hurt me this trial's here to promote me because he's moving me to adoption so the Holy Ghost is there and listen not every not every lesson was a pass it wasn't like the tutor come through and it was 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% go to adoption not even the point the point of the tri and listen I I'm not I'm not worried about showing up in heaven with a perfect scorecard you know my this here's here's my report you know a a a a no listen there's a whole bunch of FS you know f f f f f and then he says well go back and try it again amen you're not disqualified from being a son amen but you got to go back because you got to learn this to be able to handle the power that's going to be placed in your hand so there's no it's not like the modern school system there's no moving them along amen the Holy Ghost doesn't just move you along amen you've got to learn the lesson amen so then if we don't understand the purpose of our life the purpose of the trials they become meaningless and our life becomes aimless and then all of a sudden everything becomes a discouragement amen and that's life for all of us we get discouraged things pile up they come in hot and heavy sometimes and you get beat down you get tired you get discouraged but none of it is for Destruction not one of it is to destroy us but it is to try us it is to test us with the intention listen I'm going to say it and just hang on fasten your seat belts with the intention that you will fail some of them yes the test in Eden was meant to be failed did it serve God's purpose God couldn't make them fail he put them on free m they failed on their own but the intention was to put them in a situation where they were likely to fail knowing that they would fall do you think you've ever been put in a situation do you think God would do a thing like that why would God do something like that only if he wants to reveal himself to you as a deliverer and a savior and a God who forgives and a God who heals wounds and amen maybe God will put you in the circumstances knowing you're likely to fall and we say God why would you do that it hurt me so bad it caused me so much grief and so much trouble amen because he's the one amen who's got the bomm of Gilead he's the deliverer he's going to bring something out of the word to life that you would only understand if you had failed in that test anden that's the reason like like nobody wants to hang out with somebody who got everything right I don't even want you to be my friend you had a perfect score through life you never messed anything up you had no failure you didn't do anything wrong listen I don't want to hear it I just don't want to hear it amen I mean you can keep talking but my mind's probably somewhere else because the reality is that wasn't the point right the point of the test in the trial was not the perfect Mark the point of the test in the trial is because he wants to put you in position almost equal to the father and he cannot put people born the way we were born in that position to handle the spoken word unless there's a character there that can handle that when the time comes it's irresponsible for him to do so as irresponsible it is for a man to turn over the family farm and the family business to a son who's spoiled and selfish and has no vision and no self-discipline that would be irresponsible to handle all the assets and all the wealth of the family over to a son like that that would be foolishness amen the same way it would be irresponsible for God to hand over the authority and power and the power of the word that he's putting into the bride and putting into her hands in the end time unless a me she had the character to be able to handle that without destroying herself or others so the point now is to come to the adoption and so the the position is so important it requires the trials and the testings that's why I think I'm so thankful for a prophet I I can't ever thank God enough that he came and opened his word in this day there's no way for us to know these things friends I mean we could take some shots in the dark and there's some Godly men who've been able to study the word and under the anointing of the Holy Ghost with gifts and their life they've picked pieces of this out and they've had some of this amen with even through the church ages they've had some of this understanding amen the problem was it was fragmented across the church ages and fragmented across groups amen but it would it took a prophet in this day to pull all the fragments all those truths together to make one picture so we could see the picture of the will of God clearly and I'm so thankful for that Amen in adoption part four brother B says the mystery of his will and remember how we hung on that how many was here this morning he's referring to what we just read out of part three let's see how we stuck on that the mystery of his will now it's not just a little thing then it's a mystery God's will is a mystery so God's will is a mystery mystery means something that's hidden hidden or secret so God's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of God for his or herself God's mystery that's what we labored on last time is knowing that who I am in Christ because that's his mystery that's his secret of his will concerning me and that'll change my life amen that'll change the way I live my life once I catch that Revelation now let's go to Romans 8 and we read this scripture last time and we're going to read it again and place it in here at the beginning Romans 8 Romans 828 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren so now he was that was the first born among many Brethren and the first one to come to adoption but but those whom he fornew that's his elect seed Those whom he forew he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so we are predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ according to the the the the uh good to the pleasure of his will the good pleasure of his will but that predestination is also to be conformed into the image of his son because when we come to adoption we'll be looking just like Jesus Christ amen amen and so this is where brother Ben preaches the message stature of a perfect man to be conformed to the image of his son to be to to to move in all things unto the head which is Christ and to the stature of a perfect man unto Christ so we're coming to the very image of Jesus Christ reflected back through a many-membered bride through each one of us so let's go to second Peter chapter 1 and now let's look at this uh scripture that brother brandom used when he went to stature of a perfect man and started talking about the divine nature second Peter chap 1:3 second Peter 1 and3 according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to Glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so now I can be a partaker of the divine nature not my nature doctored up but the divine nature amen so that I can be a partaker of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so I've got to escape corruption that came through lust remember how Eve was deceived through lust so you desired she had to he created desire she had to desire something and she had to desire something and move amen outside of God's boundary he had for her and so that corruption entered the world through lust so we having escaped that we can be partakers of his divine nature and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ so now as we look at the divine nature brother Brandon breaks it down into these to these uh seven qualities or seven characteristics with the Capstone of divine love being charity the eight and and he says add to your faith virtue so faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance so knowledge is Godly knowledge virtue is strength that that the strength that comes from God faith is the faith of God knowledge is God's knowledge Temperance is self-control patience is is longsuffering is being able to wait and endure and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness which is brotherly love and to brotherly kindness charity which is perfect love this is the divine nature this is what we're being grown into this is what we're being groomed into this is the goal this is the destination the destination is not so that you can become a a prideful powerful arrogant know-it-all superum being amen you're to be a superum being but superhuman being doesn't necessarily mean a superhero like the world consider superhuman superh human means above human and I want to be superhuman I want to be above human CU human is terrible it's Afflicted with selfishness and pride and arrogancy and bitterness and contempt and strife and and so I want to become superhuman amen not as a self- elevated where where I'm we become this this this overarching all powerful uh menacing superhuman uh uh Marvel comic hero as Christians I don't think that's what he's looking for I don't know I don't think that's what the super race is to be that's not what Jesus was when he was here he was lowly he was Meek he was humble did did he have power yes he had power but that was power under control and he held it down could he have let it out yes but he held it down and he subjected himself to the will of the father and he only did that which the father showed him so what could he have been right the question is what could brother Brenham have been we've talked about this before we all know if he would have just taken that gift and used it any way he wanted and the reality is he he he had a gift amen and that gift could have taken him places and it could have opened doors for him amen but he himself had to learn to hold it down and not use it for himself but use it for the glory of God and Jesus had to learn to hold his gift and his power in and only use it by the will of God for the glory of God according to the word of God and not for his own self-purpose right and so when we come to this quote here there is only one way provided by God for anything this is from July of 1963 he said his word is always the truth always the truth his believing children believe for it and cry for it until his word is Vindicated in his word is always his will I want you to catch this and just think of this his word is always his will so now we're talking about the mystery of his will and we know according to the word the mystery of his will is that he's predestinated us unto adoption of sons that we would that we would be conformed into the image of his son that we would come to the stature of a perfect man and move to adoption we know that that's the mystery of his will for our lives and we need that to become a reality to us amen by Jesus Christ revealing himself personally to us but also the mystery of his will amen is revealed in the revealing of his word because his word is always his will so I want to know the will of God concerning my life first find out if you're part of this bride or not amen and then you know the will then you know you in his mind before the foundation of the world you know you're part amen of the things we've already been talking about but then I want to find his will for my everyday life his will is his word his word is his will so now if I want to find his will I must find the word amen in live and reflect the word and if I live the word I'm living the will of God Amen he says his word is always his will if you want to know what the will of God is find it in the Bible it's God's word now listen anything contrary to it is perverted so God is not God is Not uh predestinated us into the adoption of sons to live a perverted life that's not what we were for ordained to do we weren't foreordained for the perversion we were foreordained to manifest the word so his word is always his will anything contrary to it is perverted he says in second Corinthians 13 you don't have to turn there I'll just quote it real quickly 2 Corinthians 13:7 I'm sorry 138 for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth the Apostle Paul now is talking and in in brother B just told us that God's word is his will I want to know his will it's his word amen so I know if I'm contrary to the word I'm automatically out of the will of God because if the word's been perverted at all that's not the life he's called me to but but uh Paul says we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth amen this becomes the reality of Our Lives as we move to a adoption that we are not called to do anything against the truth but we are called only for the truth in John 17:17 Jesus said sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth so we can do nothing against the truth means we can do nothing against the word but only for the truth or for the word because his word is truth and that word truth in John 17:17 is the word logos we've talked about it many times we all know it but just in review it's the word translated into word uh most often than not in the Bible it's this logos was the word that the Greek word behind the scripture in John 1:1 in the beginning was the word logos and the Word was with God logos and that's the word it's used uh uh 330 times in the New Testament but in the definition of it it says a word uttered by a living voice embodies a concept or idea so now brother brandham brought this definition to us he brought it and he says it's the word that contains the original thought this is a very specific word amen when we talk about word we're not just talking about amen the the what's written on paper because what's written on paper can be read and taken anywhere your intellect will take it so your own understanding of what you read and you read a sentence out of the Bible amen you can have four different people from four different walks of life or four different places on the planet they read the the same verse out of the Bible and they come with four different understandings of that and so it means that that they read the words but they didn't necessarily get the word because if they got the word it contains the thought of God with the word that's logos amen and in the beginning was logos not just words on paper amen but the very thought of God that was moving into a manifestation amen that's why word is the thought as it becomes man manifested amen as it begins to take form that is word that's why when brother Alistair was here and he preached on the word he says what did God say what language did God speak in when he said let there be light who was there to hear the word who can tell you was it English was it Hebrew was it this or that or do was there anything audible that we would even consider audible with the ears that we have now when we say spoke or audible amen we we're we're we're thinking from our own perspective down here on Earth as if what the only the only spoken word amen is only something that I can hear with the vibrations that are hitting the drums in my ears amen but there was no drums in any ears when he said let there be and we know that speech sometimes is different than what we consider speech amen what we call speech is speech amen but the the Bible in the Psalms as it describes the heavenlies amen it says they speak a language amen and it goes out all over the their speech is heard by all the world Amen what what speech do the stars give that hits your eardrum amen but they're speaking of the glory of God they're speaking of the handiwork of God Amen their voice utth out the things of God their speech goes to the ends of the world praise God so this word is so much deeper it can be represented on paper it can be represented audibly as what we call audibly it can be represented amen through signs through wonders through through Miracle it can be represented in many ways amen but what it is is the thought of God coming into manifestation that is this word amen and it embodies the concept or idea so this is the this is the thing that becomes so important because if I get the audible part that hits my ear and then I go to act that out in life and the way I act it out is not according to God's thought then I did not get the logos although I got words I got what we would call words I did not get the logos because now my actions are different than God's thinking when he spoke that word or when he had a prophet speak it or when he had men of old put it down and pin it out on a scroll amen whatever was in God's mind am is the word the thought becoming the word the word must contain that thought in order to be logos this is why this is why you can read and you can read and you can read and you can read but without the spirit of Revelation amen we're not going to get any further than the denominations are getting and there's nothing wrong with reading and there's nothing wrong with respecting the word and I believe God will even honor those who do it sincerely amen but we need more than the ability to read we need more than just the great translation of the Bible brother Brenham says so much what we need is the spirit of Revelation to tap us back into the mind of God and God in his Mercy amen he sent down a voice in our day the voice of God Amen that could tap into the back part of God's mind and bring the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication so that we don't have to question what God meant by this verse you just go back and find what the prophet said because the prophet was the mouthpiece of God he wasn't his own mouthpiece he was the mouthpiece of God and so now this is why in my life I'm not trying as a a as as a Christian who's been predestinated into the adoption of children to be conformed into the image of Christ who is the anointed word amen so I've been predestinated to come into the image of the anointed word amen so that's why I'm not here in this life to contradict the prophet or to correct the prophet or to change what he said or to make it more malleable to my station in life amen because I'm here to get the thought behind the word and how am I going to do it with my own intellect we need a we needed a voice at the end of time we needed the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication amen praise God oh praise the Lord you know I'm just going to inject this this isn't anything I was had on paper or notes or thoughts but you know how brother Alistair come here last weekend and he preached on Dimensions seven dimensions God's in the seven sixth Dimension and and shows the three that we live in the fourth dimension amen being a a dimension of communication of Science and The Fifth Dimension right how many believes that that was the truth now you go prove to me what The Fifth Dimension is by the Bible verse find a Bible verse that explains what The Fifth Dimension is amen I mean don't get me wrong the Bible is everything to us it's the word of God but you realize unless brother Alistair believed that brother benam was right on his teaching and dimensions he could have never came and preached that he could not have preached that message without a prophet unless brother brandham had tapped into the mind of God and understood the mentions and could bring it into our realm and preach the mentions he couldn't you cannot prove what The Fifth Dimension is by the Bible but once you know what the Fifth Dimension is you can see it all through your Bible amen the Bible vindicates the teaching the Bible backs it up and supports it because you find it all over the place amen but you can't come to that conclusion with your intellect and Bible verses alone it takes a prophet Amen to come and bring it to us and he unlocks something out of the word and for us to receive it we have to believe that that is the mouthpiece of God and if we're always questioning that mouthpiece and I have to prove everything he says amen by the Bible or I can't accept it then brother Alistair could not have preached Dimensions amen because what was he doing that was the word of God what made it the word of God because I could find ink blotches that M no what made it the word of God is it was the thought of God being expressed it was the word of God and it matched perfectly with the word that he gave us so that it could be confirmed so you could go to your Bible so that you could see it so you could understand it so that it becomes clear amen don't get me wrong I don't believe in something that's not in the Bible I don't believe something that's just jointed with God's word it's got to be perfectly in Harmony and unity with the word but we have to understand what word really is what the word of the Lord actually is it's the thought of God being expressed praise God yes and that is what we live by yes sir that is what we're supposed to manifest we're supposed to become the Living Word manifested the manifested word and if I'm going to be the manifested word there has to be a continuity a l a linear thought from thought to expression to manifestation that has to be right in harmony with one another so now that the expression in my life is in harmony with the word that was expressed a spoken word and written word amen which is in harmony with the thought of God I can't get any of this disjointed for me to become the word made flesh there has to be a continuity between those three amen and his word is his will amen Amen brother bam says in wisdom versus Fai I'm going to quote many places out of wisdom versus Faith it's a message I've been going through very slowly over the last week or more and I've been enjoying it so much and so I've got quite a few quotes out of there it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word was in God it was God it was his thoughts that was in him always there so what was the word it was his thoughts that was always there God's thoughts is as Eternal as God is that ain't skim milk brother see here it comes God's thoughts was his word in the beginning that's in eternity now when beginning first started time in the beginning was the word God's thoughts and the Word was with God and the Word was God see listen to this his thoughts is what he was so what was God his thoughts and then as God started to to come into manifestation it says in the beginning was the word the beginning of what the beginning of the thoughts coming into expression was the word and that word took form as a logos and brother benam explained it as a pillar of light or a pillar of fire and in that was all the thought of God contained in there now when when that was the beginning in the beginning was the word now it moves from thought to expression as it's expressed that's word I don't know if there was anything audible that took place then amen but what happened was he spoke what do you mean he spoke he expressed his thought became expressed and God spoke right and it manifest as a pillar of fire amen so his thought is what he was so now as that logos now came down the word the full embodiment of the word or the full thought of God as word now came down and was manifested in one vessel that's Jesus Christ amen that man became the manifested word we on the same page so you have uh the the thought God Alone the logos the word or the thought being expressed Jesus Christ the word made flesh is the manifested word we're on the same page if Jesus now begins to act any way different than the thought of God he had when he's alone now the manifestation is untrue it's wrong it's false word amen so the will of God for his life was for him to be the perfect reflection of the thought of God Amen and that's what he was but that was not to stop with him now that's moving down into his bride amen let's go to First Peter chapter 4 we should be close here at second Peter let's go to First Peter 1 Peter chapter 4 or sorry 1 Peter chapter 1 no I'm I'm wrong 1 Peter chapter 4 1 Peter 4:1 for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for that for he that hath suffered In the Flesh ha ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God so this is is God's purpose amen that you no longer live the rest of your life uh uh Time In the Flesh to the lust of men that's how we lived before but to the will of God so how do I live to the will of God his word is his will amen what word the word that's been restored to us in this end time by the grace of God we now have his will anden if you want to know the will of God you've got 1200 tapes I I I suggest you start combing over them to find the will of God amen amen amen now let's go to First John first John chapter 2 1 John chapter 2:15 John says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of the pride of life is not of the father but it is of the world and the world passes away with the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever amen I'm so glad that God has made the mystery of his will known in our days so that we have we have the will of God to look at so that we can subject ourselves to it and surrender and say oh God come and make that Word Alive in me I surrender to it I choose it I I give up my own desire and I take that revelation of the word to manifest in my life amen because he that doeth the will of God abideth forever you know how frustrating this scripture is if you don't know the will of God and if you've got 40,000 denominations all telling you a different version of the will of God oh thank God for his Mercy in our day thank God for his grace to bring his word what his desire is for a bride how he wants to dress walk talk amen how to conduct their Church how to conduct ourselves in church how to deal with their families how to raise their children how to how to work in the workplace amen I'm so glad that God has brought his mind to us and made this book live so that we can live the book I'm so thankful amen and there's nothing in me wants to change it alter it amen or do away with it I just want to surrender to and say oh God let that word that you've restored in our day Let It Be Alive in me and help me to give up the lust of the flesh amen the pride of life the lust of the eyes and just do your will amen back in wisdom versus Faith he says Jesus noted by faith in the revelation of God's word in his own predestinated life amen God knowed it by faith and he's saying that Satan knowed it intellectually so he's comparing and contrasting the two in the but listen he noted by faith in the revelation of God's word in his own predestinated life so now how did he know it by faith he knew it by faith in his own predestinated life listen what he says Glory I hope that soaks Plum into your heart Jesus knew who he was Satan was wondering Jesus knew who he was but Satan was wondering if thou be praise God he knowed that he was a predestinated creature of God that God himself was manifested in him it wasn't him doing the works it was the father that dwelt in him amen now listen to to Jesus when he talks to and when he when he talks to the Pharisees he talks to the those in religion in that day he said it's not me that doeth the work but it's the father that dwelleth in me see he's subject to the will of God he's subject to the thought of God and he realizes that he's not doing anything on his own of his own accord amen he's only doing as the father leads and as the father equips and as the father supplies he's giving us a perfect example amen he says now he goes on he says let the devil fly with all of his theology Jesus Satan knew it he knew the word now he could quote the scripture boy just like a walking Bible he's talking about Satan he's not talking about Jesus here he's talking about Satan he he knew the word but he didn't know the [Applause] logos you understand now Satan knew it he knew the word now he could quote that scripture boy just like a walking Bible he could just quote it like that and brother B snaps but Jesus Stood Still for he knew where he was standing he know that he was predestinated was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he knowed he was that person oh brother he that has an ear let him hear he know that he was predestinated for that and that's the way he knew the word see and it worked how did he know the word he knew the word from his predestinated position that's how he knew the word he knew the word by knowing who he was and by knowing who he was gave him the revelation of the word he couldn't do it vice versa Satan knew the word but he didn't know Jesus's position he was wondering amen let's go to Matthew chapter 4 I tell you what Satan may be wondering about you and I but we better not be wondering amen may God give us a revelation of of who we are amen Matthew 4 uh Matthew 4:1 then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward a hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread of alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen then the devil taketh him up into a holy city and sth him on a pinnacle of the temple and saith un him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against the stone I want you to stop right there verse six Satan quoted the Bible nearly verbatim you want to know that something that's odd is when Jesus quotes the Bible he hardly ever quotes it verbatim he always changes something and it changes it to match the application for the day but Satan didn't change anything he quoted it just like it was written in the Old Testament you know who else handled the scripture the way Jesus did the Apostle Paul handled the scripture he would quote but rarely would he quote and he didn't quote Whole sentences or whole scriptures sometimes he pulled out just fragments and sometimes he didn't quote it verbatim but you know who quoted it verbatim without a mistake was Satan when he was quoting it to Jesus we need more than intellect more than quoting scriptures more than reading we need a revelation of the thought of God behind the word to know how to apply the word that's why Jesus could pull a fragment amen that David was saying not say all that was David was saying but just a fragment of what David said apply it to himself and apply it to that day and the devil would be like wait wait a minute no no no no you didn't quote the whole verse and you didn't use that in context and that applies to David it didn't matter because he had the original thought behind the word and he knew that it applied to him amen that's why all of this religious intellectual using of the Bible it's not going to work we've not been called to be Bible students we've not been called to become theologians we not become to called to make the message intellectual we're just here to believe the word to accept what a prophet brought and believe it for the truth and say that's nothing but the truth brother Brandon amen you know who else doesn't quote verbatim you know who else use fragments is you know who else seems to pull it out of context the prophet of God for this day he uses the scripture the same way Paul used the scripture and the same way Jesus used the scripture but the Pharisees quoted exact and Satan quoted it [Applause] exact God God made it so only revelation will cut through not intellect not theology not study it's only going to be Revelation that Taps you back into the thought of God so now verse six is a beautiful quote from the Bible right and it happens to be true it's not even used wrong as far as the application to Jesus right yeah cuz it's referring to him oh don't you love it to be so close it to De see the very elected he was using the word quoting it right and even applying it to the right person verse 7 Jesus said unto him it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God Amen Jesus quoted the scripture Satan quoted the scripture whose scripture wins the one that has the thought amen verse eight again the devil taketh him up unto an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and sayith unto him all these things will I give thee if thou Willl Fall Down and Worship me then saith Jesus unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him there there's several things in here that I want to highlight Jesus first knew who he was that is so important when he gets into a a a scriptural debate with Satan it's really important that he already knows what he is because D Satan's not sure who he is amen but but Jesus is sure of who he is and because he's sure of who he is he doesn't have to take any of the bait that Satan is offering him and Satan starts off by saying if thou be the Son of God Amen this is the first Temptation because now what he's trying to do is he's trying to get Jesus to use the word to vindicate himself he said well doesn't the word vindicate him yes the word Vindicated to be the Son of God he said if you don't believe on me believe on the works that I do do not they tell you who I am but that was done by the will of the father not his own will he did that he did nothing L the father showed him so he was never to take the word to vindicate himself although the word would vindicate him he wasn't supposed to take the word to vindicate himself cuz he was supposed to stay submissive to the leadership of the father and only only do what the father showed him so here Satan listen Satan's trying to get him to take the word to vindicate himself because he is the word the word will vindicate him he has all power and authority he can do it all but he would have done it outside the will of God therefore it wouldn't have been the thought of God and therefore it would have been perverted word he had to know who he was so that he wouldn't take the devil's bait the devil may try to get you to prove prove your bride of Christ where's your testimonies what have you done lately listen I don't need need any of that to prove who I am I Know Who I Am by revelation God vindicates his bride with his word the word vindicates amen it's been Vindicated in our lives over and over and over again but but there's all kinds of denominations with all kinds of vindications and they're off the word amen I don't need a Vindication amen what I need is a revelation because who am I trying to prove my brideship too I don't need to prove it to you if I can convince you I'm bride that doesn't matter I'm the one who needs to be convinced that I'm bride I'm the one who needs to know because if I convince you and still have a question in my heart that I'm going to be working all the time to try to convince you and you and you and you I'm bride and if you all agree then somehow I can quiet the question mark that's in my own heart but it will never stop amen you'll constantly be on the devil's treadmill trying to take the word and force it and prove it amen to vindicate that you're the Son of God right that's why the first revelation is the greatest Revelation that God can reveal to you that you're part of his mind you're part of his thoughts you're C gen of him that you're part of his plan from the beginning and then you don't need to prove anything to anybody and so what if nobody believes your bride that doesn't matter the only one that matters is me because I don't have to convince God he already knows the only one who needs to know on this Earth is me I don't need to convince my wife I don't need to convince my children I don't need to convince anybody else I'm the one who needs convinced of who I am amen and amen and those of you who' had Supernatural Vindication Supernatural manifestation in your life you know the truth amen you can have the most Supernatural thing take place in your life and 10 15 years down the Lo Road amen everything in your life can be coming falling apart amen and things can be going wrong and everybody can be turning against you and you yourself can make a mistake and the devil will still whisper in your ear you think you're a bride yes so at that stage that Vindication still doesn't hold he's still questioning who you are there's got to be something deeper than that it's got to be way down in the soul amen something he can't root out or Reason [Applause] away because he can also point out do you remember the brother he hadn't experienced real similar and look he fell away he doesn't believe the message anymore his family's in ruin and he's becoming this or that yes yes he's the master that's why we can't use anything that the devil tries to tempt us with we can't mishandle the word for selfish reasons so first he tried to get him to vindicate self with the word would the word vindicate him yes did God want the manifestation word to vindicate him yes but it was going to be done according to God's will as God showed him what to do not of his own accord that's right amen then he says you're hungry just get yourself in bread prove that you're the son of man and take care of yourself at the same time there's the second trap trying to take care of ourselves of our flesh man hey I'm not here to provide for myself I'm a sheep and I have a Shepherd I'm a wife and I have a husband so that's another Temptation with the word then he comes and he he quotes him the Bible beautifully and said this verse applies to you he gives his angels charge concerning thee that lest you should Dash thy foot against the stone that's a scripture concerning you and that's the truth he said so now throw yourself down off of this Temple to prove that you are the Fulfillment of this scripture my goodness when you back up and think about it it's ludicrous but this is what he's doing tempting because Jesus had to be tempted to prove that he would stay with the word according to God's will so he was giving him the word he was giv him a true word and a word that applied to him and he was trying to for he was trying to get Jesus to force God to manifest and vindicate him by throwing him off of a pinnacle and making God then who becomes subject to whom who's the Lord amen and who's the servant now if he climbs up on a pinnacle because of the scripture and thrust himself throws himself down forcing God Amen to make this scripture work in his life listen that's not the way it works friends we're not the ones to dictate how this will come to pass we're not the ones that dictate amen what is the application of he gives his angels charge concerning thee unless thou Dash thy foot upon a stone I'm not the one to bring it to pass by my own reasoning or intellect or Temptation Of The Devil I'm here to wait for God to bring that to pass any way he wants it's a true scripture it applies to me I believe God will bring it to pass but I have no idea how he wants to prove that listen and if I take my own mind to to vindicate myself and to force God to do something for me amen now I've become the dictator of the word and I've become the one who dictates how it's going to be made manifest yes and I'm not interested in that because I've messed up everything else in my life life and I sure don't want to mess this up so he tries to get God to force God to vindica him I think that's so Sinister and to the last one was he offered him the kingdoms of the world and he tried to get him to promote himself outside of God's time and outside of God's will this is the temptation in the wilderness what kind of Temptation do you think we face you say you know I was never in the wilderness 40 days and I was never hungry and I never had Satan made Stones no he's done this to you over and over and over again the same exact Temptations to promote self outside of God's time and will to protect self outside and provide for self outside of God's time and will and to prove self yes yes we have to get away with the things of the world and the lust thereof and do the will of God again in wisdom versus Faith he says Jesus know it by experience he know it by Revelation he know that he was the son of God and that was to come into the world he knowed his standing he knowed he was born in this world for that purpose and that's the reason the word of God could work through him because he knowed what he was is it Jesus says it is written said Jesus yes sir Satan couldn't tempt him no sir he is past that but Jesus was the word his faith in the knowledge of his that he was the word what did Jesus have faith in he had faith in the knowledge of hisself that he was the word what is the bride supposed to be the word what are we supposed to have faith in that we're the word that we are God's thoughts made manifest in this life and there's nothing I have to prove there's nothing I have to do all I have to do is follow his word and follow his will and he will do everything that he's promised to doen but I can't get ahead of his program Jesus was the word his faith in the knowledge of his that he was the word listen just like Moses why Moses knew who he was Moses knew he was God's servant knowed he was called of God he know what he was going to do that's the reason he wasn't scared what Satan said Satan tried to tempt him scare him out of it but no Moses knew where he was standing Moses couldn't do anything but what God said he couldn't do anything outside of what God told him to do he had no ability to do anything else when God told him to throw a rod down it turned into a serpent and he said go do it before Pharaoh all he could do was throw a rod down and watch it turn into a serpent when The Magicians did the same thing he had nothing else to say because God told him nothing else to say he could couldn't inject his own thoughts and start making excuses and reasons why it didn't work all he had to do was sit still and wait because he did what God Said do listen that's the greatest lesson for all of us God has sent his word in this day he has unveiled the word he's told us who we are and he's told us what he wants us to do he's given us his word all we need to do is Faithfully apply that word and Obey it and just wait and let God do what he's going to do when it doesn't happen the way we think it's going to happen our else happens that we didn't expect that's not time to start making excuses and start coming up with reasoning that's the time to just keep our mouth shut be quiet and wait because I did this because the prophet said do it I did it because you revealed it in your word I did it because you said the bride this is what the bride is supposed to do that's why I did this now I'm waiting for you either tell me what to do next or work it out I don't know what else to do so Moses knew we need to know further down he says if Jesus defeated Satan upon fa the faith catch clearly what he says if Jesus defeat and S upon the faith knowing who he was he was a predestinated creature are you ready what about the predestinated Bride of Jesus Christ now you believe the bride is predestinated this is what he said Jesus defeated Satan upon the faith knowing who he was what is the faith of our day really what is the faith it's I have faith in God's word and I have faith in God and I have faith in Jesus Christ and I have faith in all these things but listen many people in the world will say the same things that you say but really what gave what gave Jesus the power to overcome the Temptation is he had faith in the word of God which was himself faith in his allotment faith in his portion faith in who he was by God's predestinated plan and how is the bride going to overcome the devil in this day the same thing right you can have faith in all the other people you want faith in my mom and dad faith in my pastor faith in brother brandham faith in this faith in that faith in the Bible faith in all of this but if you have no faith in who you are yes how are you going to stand The Temptations in this hour Faith listen this is not this is not uh self-inflated this is the reality I have to believe in what God said about me I have to believe it I have to accept it as true if I continue doubting and excusing it away I'm never going to get anywhere it's always going to be two steps forward two steps back it's always going to be success and failure I've got to I've got to come to terms with the reality of what this message says and who it's for and what it's supposed to produce in the paman church age in the church age book brother brandham has a section in there where he talks about the time the angel of the Lord told him to pick up his pen and write and you know it really well but I'm going to read just a small section and he says notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father Father John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it amen praise God therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word the question is how did we get the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word that came through a prophetic gift that's how we know that that we we've got it through the message of the hour that's how we know the mind of Christ and what he wants done with the word because he's restored the word the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise not even Satan quoting scriptures to you and saying if you're bride make this scripture work if you're bride do this let me see you do this and I'll believe you're bride are you kidding me as soon as I do that you won't believe you'll give me something else to do I'm not I'm too tired to follow that path I'm exhausted I'm just going to believe the word as soon as you start jumping through the devil's Hoops you know he'll be like okay all right I if you do if you perform this word if this word comes to pass then you're bride you jump through oh I'm bright well no no really there's another scripture and he moves it higher and then he moves it high and then he sets it on fire now jump through that one right it's a NeverEnding Trail to nowhere if God's given you a revelation amen of who you are and it's settled in your heart then let it stay settled in your heart don't question don't worry don't fret just obey the word take the mind of Christ that was given to us through the message of the hour amen through the opening of the word and take the mind of Christ and let it be your mind upon the word and live it just surrender to it just obey and the parts that you can't seem to get Just Surrender and say God you've got to make this work in me cuz I'm struggling and then let him come and perform the word and just stick with that he said I'm going to read this again those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still why is it no one can make them do otherwise it's because they don't need to do otherwise listen I I hope that I can get this home I hope I can get this one point driven home right now they don't need to do otherwise because Jesus didn't need to do otherwise he only needed to do what the father told him he didn't have anything to prove he didn't have to protect himself defend himself promote himself there was no part of self that he had to engage amen for himself he was totally surrendered to the hand of God and whatever God wanted for him is what he surrendered himself to why is it they can't make her do otherwise is because she doesn't need to do otherwise because she doesn't have to prove protect promote defend herself she just stays behind the wall of the word and she lets her husband take care of it that's where the deception is is trying to create in you a need trying to create in you and I an insecurity and a need to we need to prove vindicate promote but God came with an open book and he came himself to take away all our insecurities he brought a prophetic gift in our day a gift that there's never been anything recorded like it in the history of mankind Vindication upon Vindication upon Vindication and then word upon word upon word why did God do such a thing in this day he did it to take away your and I insecurity because why he brought this message to his bride well how do I know I'm bride do you believe the message he brought this message to his bride am I bride question is do you believe the message have you received it do you believe it with all your heart and why question if you're bride Just Surrender to it you can't receive it you can't believe it in your soul unless you're predestinated to believe it don't let Satan put Hoops out here for you to jump through to prove who you are I'm there's no proving God's revealed to me the message I just believe it and I didn't believe it because I even wanted to I believed it because I couldn't help but believe it there was something inside of me believing when there was something outside of me questioning and doubting there was something inside of me believing at the same time at the same time I was saying this can't be true there was something inside of me saying that's nothing but the TR amen so no one can make them do otherwise I mean even if somebody puts a gun to your head and say deny water baptism in jesus' name it's like I mean pull the trigger as fast as you can I'm going to the sixth Dimension he's taken away all my insecurity he's given me the revelation of even where I go to when I leave this body like what what are you going to do to somebody who's been given the full picture I mean I what a privilege I would deny it so fast amen praise God it's going to be this easy Lord I didn't realize but you realize nothing no one can make her do otherwise and I I don't mean to make light of that but there's more Tri than that coming there's more pressures and more deceptive just like Satan coming to Jesus but what we need is a revelation of who we are that that we are part of the good pleasure of his will to bring us to adoption and now what does he want me to do in this life he's already revealed it in the message all I need to do is take the mind of Christ concerning the word and let my life reflect that word that simple let's not make it complicated let's keep it simple they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep Still They Know listen here's another key phrase they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride the work which he left for this specific time so what works do you have to do surrender because it's a work he left for himself to do he just needs my body am in Christ is the mystery of God revealed the prophet says now you can see now the end time message why it's rejected now no denomination but the revelation of his mystery see no denomination the revelation God is not known by the nomination he is known by Revelation look God in his body Christ and Christ in his body the bride oh oh oh my God made manifest in Christ Christ made manifest in the bride and as God took from the body of Adam the woman and she fell then God has took from the body of Christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a bride out that won't fall by denomination or Creed no sirve but she is coming back with the pure unadulterated word of God being manifested I hope every man that hears this tape and every woman will understand that she is the second Eve but if she is not breaking and spoiling her skirts of Purity and Holiness to her husband she'll stay with his word regardless of what anybody says you can have all the ecumenical moves you want to and all the affiliations why because she's realized she is the word that word and me are the same and there's nothing else I need now everything I need I already have he's already revealed it to me amen whatever he chooses to manifest is what he needs I hope you understand what I'm saying whatever he needs to manifest through my life is what he needs because he left a work for this specific time to do it and through the bride but he's already given me everything I need right am the revelation of who I am amen says but Christ's mystery God revealed but this mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride that's the only one could see it now ask you the question are you bride amen I just want to go on record saying the devil's a liar God's word is true amen Colossians 1:25 says says whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory it's not me it's Christ in me it's not my works it's his works it's not my will it's his will it's not my word it's his word I'm just part of it and I believe it by faith and I'm resting in it that's why the bride can do nothing against the truth but for the truth because she's part of the truth which is the word Thy word is truth she's part of the truth that's why she'll surrender her life and just Manifest this word and take what the prophet said take the word that's been restored and just live it amen Christ is the mystery God revealed one last quote but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it that's her stand what am I standing on that he chose me in him before the foundation of the world according to the good pleasure of his will he has predestinated me to the adoption of sons amen and I'm standing on the mystery of his will revealed to me there's nothing else I need to stand on that's our stand man God bless you as you stand to your feet musicians if you'll come brother Ben if you'll please come amen let's just bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for this word that you have given to us God it's more precious than we could ever realize our intellect ual capacity has failed we have failed as human beings to actually comprehend what it is that you've given to us we cannot grasp it we cannot imagine it in all humanistic ideas and thoughts and reasonings there is no way we can come to the full gravity of what has been placed inside of us but God there's a faculty that's beyond intellect there's Faith that's down in the soul that says I don't understand it I cannot explain it but I know it's nothing but the truth that you have before the foundation of the world you knew that we'd be standing here in this day you knew Lord the that you knew the fight we would fight you knew the resistance we would have you knew the tactics of the enemy you knew the deception of the age you knew it all and so what you did is you portioned a portion of yourself for this age and you put a portion of yourself inside of our souls the ability to believe and God you've come to us now and you've quickened it Lord by your own Spirit you've brought us to life and You' brought us the revelation of the word and there's something inside of us that says it's the truth God that's our stand this message this revealed word this identification of who we really are we are a part of this word which means we are a part of your thoughts which means we are a part of you because you were your thoughts and when you moved in the love formed the word we were there when you moved into flesh In the Flesh of your son we were there God now that portion that you identified for expression is here now in our Tabernacles of Flesh God and you have given us the revelation of this by your mercy and by your grace God let that be our stand Let It Be The Firm Foundation We Stand upon let it be the solid rock of revelation of who you are and who we are in you let it be an unmovable foundation and though the waves beat and the storms come Lord may it not be moving off this Foundation because this is a solid rock that goes all the way back to your thinking God the devil's trying all kinds of tactics but Lord we reject them all in the name of Jesus Christ help us to stay with the [Music] Simplicity of obedience and surrender to the voice in our age help us Lord to listen to obey to surrender our will to your will help us father God to receive the truth your mind that you have delivered to us help us to eat the open book and become the book to become one with it in nature in thought May the divine nature take control of us as we move into adoption and may we take your word and just receive it by faith and may we live it according to that divine nature not our old nature not living it Lord with arrogance not living it with pride not living it with hatefulness but Lord let us flesh out this beautiful word with your divine nature behind it pushing it out according to your will for Lord we believe that that is the day we live and we believe that that is our portion of the word to live let it live in US we surrender ourselves to you we pray God that you would take us may you change us Lord into your very image may you finish your work that you left for this specific time may you finish it in and through us and God give us the foundation of Faith to Hold Steady to keep quiet to be still while we wait for you to finish the work God help us not to get ahead of the program there's where e fell but Lord You've predestinated us not to fall Lord you predestinated us for this stand help us go on reveal to every individual the mystery of your will so that we have the

first line it reminded me you know the last scripture brother Brenham reads in wisdom versus Faith he says now let's come to the conclusion of the matter let's go to Zachariah he says not by might nor by power but by my Spirit sayeth the Lord amen there's nothing for us to do but for us just to surrender just to surrender just to give up the desires of the flesh the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life die out to it and just follow his word which is his will that's all that he's asking us to do he'll do the rest he'll Supply everything it's not by power nor by might but by my spirit sayeth the Lord praise God this he determined to do before the foundation of the world according to the good pleasure of his will you don't need to add to it you don't need to doctor it up you
