[10:26] Lord God we're asking that as we take
[10:29] this word and begin to read it I pray
[10:31] that you would Lord that you would come
[10:33] on the scene and you would break the
[10:35] bread of life that you would take over
[10:37] lord and you would sow the seed of your
[10:39] word into every heart and life and bring
[10:42] forth a Bountiful Harvest where we turn
[10:45] our hearts and our attention towards you
[10:47] to hear from you it may always say and
[10:49] do be pleasing to you almighty God we

[10:55] all that you would take preeminence
[10:57] Among Us in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[11:01] amen may God bless you this evening
[11:04] let's take our Bibles while we're
[11:06] standing and turn to Ephesians
[11:09] certainly good to be here again with you
[11:10] this evening as you can see we changed
[11:13] the curtains behind us in preparation
[11:14] for the wedding this weekend so be in
[11:16] prayer for all the things that are
[11:18] coming together for that and be praying
[11:20] for brother Daniel sister Caitlin and
[11:22] all that are helping and all the plans
[11:24] that need to cohese amen but we're
[11:27] looking forward to that also want to let
[11:29] you know that brother Emmanuel sabasu
[11:31] will be preaching this Sunday for us so
[11:34] I'm anxious to hear from him what the
[11:36] lord has laid on his heart so be praying
[11:38] for him as well
[11:40] um also I was going to ask for the cow
[11:42] to take the prayer request and give a
[11:44] testimony of past Sunday when he went to
[11:46] preach in Junction City so we'll just
[11:48] let you close the service in prayer and
[11:49] give a testimony at the end of service
[11:51] so I got a little sticky note here so if
[11:53] I forget just somebody yelled at me amen
[11:55] because I'd like to hear what what the
[11:58] Lord did there
[11:59] I mean let's read Ephesians chapter one
[12:01] together
[12:02] if we could
[12:04] Ephesians chapter 1 and let's read it
[12:08] from verse 3.
[12:10] blessed be the God and father of our
[12:12] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[12:14] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[12:17] places in Christ
[12:19] where we blessed in Heavenly places in
[12:22] Christ
[12:24] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[12:27] before the foundation of the world that
[12:30] we should be holy and Without Blame
[12:31] before him in love I love this I'm going
[12:34] to read this again according to have
[12:36] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[12:38] the world we were chosen in Christ
[12:40] before the foundation of the world
[12:43] so that
[12:45] we should be holy and Without Blame
[12:48] before him in love
[12:51] praise be to God verse 5 having
[12:54] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[12:57] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[12:58] according to the good pleasure of his
[13:01] will
[13:02] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[13:04] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[13:06] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[13:09] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[13:10] sins according to the riches of his
[13:12] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[13:16] and all wisdom and Prudence having made
[13:18] known unto us the mystery of his will
[13:20] according to his good pleasure which he
[13:23] purposed in himself
[13:26] who did it you or him
[13:29] amen God bless you as you're seated
[13:33] I love this passage of scripture
[13:36] he chose us in him before the foundation
[13:38] of the world that we should be holy and
[13:41] Without Blame before him in love this
[13:44] means his love was extended to us before
[13:48] and we chose us in Christ before and now
[13:52] we are seated in Heavenly places in
[13:54] Christ amen that's where our blessing
[13:55] abides and so we were always in him we
[13:59] were chosen in him we are blessed in him
[14:01] amen and and for a title tonight I'd
[14:04] like to take secure in him
[14:07] secure in him and when we look at the
[14:10] the this passage of scripture
[14:13] he chose us
[14:17] he hath chosen Us in him he God chose us
[14:23] he predestinated us
[14:26] according to the pleasure of his will
[14:30] him again
[14:33] to the praise the glory of his grace
[14:36] him again
[14:39] he hath made us accepted in the Beloved
[14:42] it's him again
[14:45] Amen in whom we have Redemption through
[14:48] his blood the Forgiveness of sins
[14:51] according to the riches of his grace
[14:54] wherein he hath abounded towards us in
[14:57] all wisdom and Prudence having made
[14:59] known unto us the mystery of his will
[15:01] according to his good pleasure which he
[15:04] hath purposed in himself
[15:08] amen the thing is did you want to be
[15:10] part of God or to God want you to be
[15:12] part of him amen did you come up with a
[15:15] plan or did God already have a plan was
[15:17] it your will or his will was it your
[15:19] pleasure or his pleasure
[15:21] was it your effort or his grace amen
[15:23] when we read this passage of scripture
[15:25] all glory goes to God Amen but also all
[15:29] of my worry needs to begin to fade away
[15:31] because he chose me and him before the
[15:33] foundation of the world Amen how could I
[15:36] be lost or how could I I not come into
[15:38] the pleasure of his will
[15:41] so it's all gone it's all what God
[15:43] predetermined it's all what God
[15:44] predestinated it's all what he foreknew
[15:47] and he designed in this thinking before
[15:49] the foundation of the world and now this
[15:52] plan of God is unfolding itself amen and
[15:54] it's unfolding itself in our lives and
[15:57] and now the revelation of the hour has
[15:59] broke Amen to bring us back and do the
[16:02] proper understanding of what he did and
[16:04] who we are and how secure we are in him
[16:08] I was securing him before the foundation
[16:10] of the world I'm secure in him now amen
[16:13] by predestination
[16:16] amen
[16:18] praise God
[16:20] brother bam says and the message is this
[16:23] the sign of the answer that's how we can
[16:26] never die because we was always
[16:30] that's amazing what a concept you can
[16:32] never die because you always were
[16:35] amen now he's not talking about this
[16:36] body of Flesh that you dwell in that can
[16:38] die
[16:39] but you know when Lazarus as a Son of
[16:42] God when Lazarus died amen Jesus as
[16:44] Lazarus sleeps
[16:46] he didn't even say Lazarus died because
[16:48] Amen in the the Heavenly economy Lazarus
[16:51] was not dead because Lazarus life
[16:53] continued on in another Realm
[16:56] so in God's perspective Lazarus never
[16:58] died amen Lazarus just changed
[17:01] dimensions
[17:03] but then they didn't understand they
[17:05] said oh If he if he if he sleepeth he'd
[17:08] doeth well and he says no Lazarus is
[17:10] dead and brother bear said he had to
[17:11] speak in a language they would
[17:13] understand they only understood an
[17:15] Earthly language not a Heavenly language
[17:18] amen so so Lazarus could never die amen
[17:21] he could just change dimensions
[17:23] praise God so he says and that's how we
[17:26] we can never die because we all we was
[17:28] always we're a part of God The Offspring
[17:32] of God and he's the only Eternal thing
[17:33] there is
[17:35] amen you can no more die than God can
[17:38] die
[17:40] because you're Eternal with him
[17:43] this is not and once again we're not
[17:45] talking about the man in the mirror
[17:47] we're not talking about the body of
[17:49] Flesh we're not talking about the carnal
[17:51] side but we're talking about that
[17:53] attribute that was with God in his
[17:55] thinking in his mind before the
[17:56] foundation the world that's actually a
[17:58] part of God a gene of God Amen that is
[18:01] the original you or the what he intended
[18:03] to be you and come into a proper
[18:05] expression of that Gene amen If the fall
[18:09] hadn't happened but because of the Fall
[18:11] now that Gene had fallen into flesh that
[18:14] has now fallen and can't give the proper
[18:17] expression
[18:19] of that Gene
[18:21] amen amen but will come back to
[18:24] Perfection
[18:26] in the change of the body
[18:29] amen
[18:30] praise God so I want to read again and a
[18:34] message sir we would see Jesus he said
[18:35] and then remember if you ever was in
[18:37] God's thinking you're all you'll always
[18:40] be there
[18:42] if you've got eternal life you are
[18:44] expressed you are the expression or the
[18:47] attribute of his thought for this age
[18:51] if not you there is only one eternal
[18:53] life and it always existed and you and
[18:56] his mind existed before there was a
[18:58] world that's the reason he said he chose
[19:01] you before the foundation of the world
[19:02] it isn't what we think what somebody
[19:05] else thinks it's what God Eternal you
[19:07] always was see in his thinking
[19:10] and so now it really doesn't matter what
[19:14] we think
[19:15] I mean I know it matters what we think
[19:16] but what we think can't change what he
[19:19] thought
[19:21] so we have all kinds of thoughts about
[19:23] ourselves and sometimes we have
[19:24] self-doubt and we have I mean sometimes
[19:26] people are afflicted with self-hate or
[19:28] self-disappointment or discouragement
[19:30] about self and we have all kinds of
[19:32] thought about self and we doubt
[19:34] ourselves sometimes we doubt our motives
[19:36] sometimes we we doubt amen our Salvation
[19:39] there's so many self-doubts but it
[19:40] doesn't matter how many doubts you have
[19:42] it'll never change what God thought and
[19:44] God never doubted about you one day
[19:47] amen that's just the carnal Realm of the
[19:50] human mind amen that that that is uh
[19:53] come wrong coming to the Earth wrong
[19:55] amen and shrouded in darkness amen that
[19:58] that doesn't really matter I say it does
[20:01] matter but it doesn't really matter an
[20:03] eternal destination because that was
[20:05] already in God's thinking and God
[20:07] doesn't change his mind
[20:09] but what we need to do is we need to
[20:11] recognize amen by a New Birth by the
[20:14] quickening of the seed and by a
[20:15] revelation a genuine Revelation from God
[20:18] we need to see ourselves in the light of
[20:21] the scripture not in our own thinking
[20:24] and we need the mind of Christ amen to
[20:27] take away spiritual Amnesia so that we
[20:29] can begin to think right and speak right
[20:32] and all of those self those self things
[20:34] can go away because it's the wrong self
[20:36] we're thinking about
[20:39] amen praise God
[20:42] that is if you're a child of God
[20:45] Amen in the smyrnan church age out of
[20:48] the church age book brother bam says
[20:51] what a stumbling block this is to so
[20:53] many people like Israel they wonder if
[20:55] God really loves them how can God be
[20:57] just and loving if he stands by and
[21:00] watches his people suffer and then he
[21:02] goes to Malachi chapter 1. verse one to
[21:05] three and he quotes it here the burden
[21:07] of the word of the Lord to Israel by
[21:09] Malachi I have loved you saith the Lord
[21:12] yet we say
[21:14] wherein hast thou loved us
[21:16] was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the
[21:19] Lord yet I love Jacob and hated Esau and
[21:21] laid his mountains as Heritage waste for
[21:23] the dragons of the Wilderness now
[21:25] brother remember says you see they could
[21:27] not figure out God's love they thought
[21:30] that love meant no suffering they
[21:32] thought that love meant baby with
[21:33] parental care but God said that his love
[21:36] was elective love
[21:39] that's how God can love you when you're
[21:41] unlovable
[21:43] when you're living in an unlivable way
[21:46] in an unlovable condition God can love
[21:48] you because his love is expressed by
[21:50] election
[21:52] but God said his love was elective love
[21:54] the proof of his love is election
[21:58] that no matter what happened his love
[22:00] was proven truly by the fact they were
[22:02] chosen unto salvation
[22:06] amen
[22:07] I I love the the Simplicity of this but
[22:11] it's so complicated in human emotional
[22:13] realms
[22:14] we make it so complicated because of the
[22:17] way we feel about things but the way we
[22:19] feel about things is not a reality
[22:23] because our feelings change all the time
[22:25] amen about everything we we love a hobby
[22:29] for a while amen and then we get all
[22:31] engrossed in it and we love it and then
[22:33] we don't love it anymore we love a
[22:35] certain sport or a certain activity we
[22:36] don't love it anymore we love a certain
[22:38] thing a certain restaurant we don't love
[22:40] it anymore
[22:42] that's human term human emotions are so
[22:45] fickle you can't base I mean I could be
[22:47] loving my day
[22:50] and if five minutes later I could be
[22:52] hating my day
[22:54] so the the feelings we have is nothing
[22:57] to base our Salvation on our Eternal
[22:59] destination based on feelings because
[23:01] feelings are so fickle but God Amen
[23:04] before the foundation of the world chose
[23:06] by election amen and now that election
[23:09] is being manifest and who he's drawing
[23:12] to himself
[23:15] because we were chosen unto salvation
[23:17] amen and you never find God God finds
[23:19] you you never run after God God draws
[23:22] you the father draws you to to Christ
[23:25] amen and so now that he's expressing his
[23:29] love amen by election a proof of his
[23:32] love is election so the proof of his
[23:35] love is not whether our day goes well or
[23:37] our day goes bad or we have blessings or
[23:39] or we have sufferings amen none of that
[23:41] amen is as a testimony of how much God
[23:44] loves us or how much he dislikes us amen
[23:46] his love is proved by election
[23:50] praise God
[23:52] and
[23:53] uh in the message the message of Grace
[23:57] from 61 he says think of it love and
[23:59] grace is sisters twin sisters
[24:02] I love this thought love and grace is
[24:04] Twin Sisters you can't have Grace
[24:07] without having love
[24:08] they're twin sisters that's exactly
[24:10] right before you can have Grace you have
[24:12] to have love
[24:14] before you have Grace you have to have
[24:16] love
[24:19] before you can actually show somebody a
[24:21] favor you love them right or wrong you
[24:22] have to love them anyhow or you can't so
[24:25] love and grace is the same thing they're
[24:27] just twin sisters that's all love and
[24:29] grace and you can't see one without the
[24:31] other God so loved the world he gave his
[24:34] only begotten son he shed his grace
[24:36] abroad in our hearts through the Holy
[24:37] Ghost there's just nothing can do
[24:39] without working one with the other so
[24:41] before you have Grace you have to have
[24:43] love amen so you say I'm saved by grace
[24:45] means God loves you
[24:47] it means God loves you you have to have
[24:50] love before Grace and if you're saved by
[24:52] the grace of God Amen and and and you
[24:55] have the faith to access that Grace amen
[24:59] then that faith is not of yourselves it
[25:01] is a gift of God Amen in the very Faith
[25:03] to to access the grace shows that he
[25:06] loved you before
[25:09] and he's not changing his mind
[25:12] amen because it was fixed eternal
[25:15] so let's go to Romans chapter 8.
[25:25] Romans chapter 8
[25:28] and we'll begin reading at verse 31.
[25:37] Romans 8 31 what shall we then say to
[25:40] these things if God before us who can be
[25:44] against us
[25:46] he that spared not his own son but
[25:48] delivereth him up for us all how shall
[25:50] he not with him also freely give us all
[25:53] things
[25:54] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[25:55] God's elected is God that justifieth who
[25:58] is he that condemneth it is Christ that
[26:00] died yea rather that is risen again who
[26:02] is even at the right hand of God who
[26:04] also make intercession for us who shall
[26:07] separate us from the love of Christ
[26:10] shall tribulation or distress or
[26:12] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[26:14] Peril or sore that is as it is written
[26:17] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[26:19] long we are counted as sheep for the
[26:21] slaughter nay and all these things we
[26:23] are more than conquerors through him
[26:25] that loved us
[26:28] how did you conquer because he first
[26:30] loved me amen and his love is eternal
[26:33] and his love is proved by election
[26:37] so no matter what's happening nothing
[26:40] will separate us from the love of God
[26:41] none of these circumstances none of
[26:43] these none of these happenings amen none
[26:46] of that will separate us from the love
[26:47] of God and we are more than conquerors
[26:50] through him that loved us
[26:52] amen
[26:54] for I am persuaded that neither death
[26:57] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[27:00] nor powers nor things present nor things
[27:02] to come nor height nor depth nor any
[27:05] other creature shall be able to separate
[27:07] us from the love of God which is in
[27:09] Christ Jesus our lord
[27:13] praise God
[27:16] let's turn quickly to John chapter 17.
[27:32] let's go to John chapter 17.
[27:36] verse 26.
[27:39] John 17 26 I have declared unto them thy
[27:43] name and will declare it that the love
[27:46] we're with thou has loved me may be in
[27:49] them and I in them
[27:52] where is that love going to be in you
[27:56] and where is Christ going to be in you
[27:59] amen amen what is that when Christ comes
[28:02] in you amen it it quickened you to the
[28:05] love of God and you recognize your
[28:07] election and that God always loved you
[28:10] in the love of God abides in you
[28:13] amen
[28:14] Christ is God's expression of love
[28:17] and he's coming in US
[28:21] in verse let's go back to verse chapter
[28:23] 14.
[28:33] Verse 18 14 18. I will not leave you
[28:37] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[28:40] little while and the world seeth me no
[28:42] more but you see me because I live you
[28:45] shall live also at that day you shall
[28:47] know that I am in my father and he and
[28:50] me and I in you
[28:52] where will we be in him
[28:55] where will he be in US
[28:58] where will the father be in him
[29:02] so if the father is in him
[29:05] and I'm in him and he's in me
[29:12] that puts us right back
[29:14] into the love of God
[29:16] where we always have been amen
[29:19] praise God let's turn to First John
[29:22] chapter 4.
[29:26] so many things in the Bible that are
[29:28] being expressed to us amen are not
[29:32] intellectually conceivable
[29:38] so
[29:40] if the father is in him
[29:44] then he's in me but I'm in him
[29:48] now listen mechanically that just
[29:50] doesn't make sense
[29:52] who's inside of who amen but but we're
[29:55] not looking at things mechanically amen
[29:57] we're not here to understand things
[29:59] logically or or intellectually we're
[30:02] here to receive them by faith and he's
[30:04] speaking in a way that'll unlock a
[30:06] believing in our heart and we'll
[30:08] recognize hey it's all wound up in one
[30:11] amen
[30:13] how does it work I don't know
[30:16] but it works
[30:17] I don't need to know
[30:19] let's go look at first John chapter 4.
[30:26] first John chapter 4 verse 19.
[30:32] we love him because he first loved us
[30:36] the question is when did you first love
[30:38] us when he chose us in him
[30:40] before the foundation of the world
[30:42] amen and and and before he could have
[30:45] Grace he had to have love so then when
[30:48] he expressed his grace his grace is an
[30:50] expression of his love
[30:52] so we receive Grace amen we've received
[30:55] his love amen because he loved us before
[30:56] and so now we have the capacity to love
[31:00] him because he first loved us
[31:04] so if we say we love him amen it's only
[31:07] evidence that he loved us first
[31:11] then the message adoption brother Graham
[31:13] says I don't live true to my wife
[31:15] because I think she'll divorce me
[31:17] I live true to my wife because I love
[31:19] her
[31:20] it's a legal position that we have taken
[31:22] that we love one another first before it
[31:24] could be there it had to be love I love
[31:26] her although I believe if I done
[31:27] something wrong she'd forgive me I still
[31:29] wouldn't do it anyhow I love her
[31:32] that's the way it is with Christ
[31:35] if I live I'm 50 if I live to be 90 or
[31:38] 100 have another 50 years to preach and
[31:41] I never preach a time go down and sit on
[31:44] the river I'm saved anyhow
[31:47] God saved me by his grace unmerited of
[31:50] anything I ever could do did do or
[31:53] anything else I preach because I love
[31:55] him and I love his people
[31:57] so brother Branham is so good at
[31:59] bringing this back into a relationship
[32:01] it says now amen I don't have to do
[32:05] anything to Merit God's love because I
[32:07] had his love before the foundation of
[32:09] the world
[32:10] so I don't have to earn it work my way
[32:12] up to it I don't have to be appeasing or
[32:14] please him in some way to earn his love
[32:16] I had his love before the foundation of
[32:18] the world
[32:19] amen
[32:21] amen but now I love him because he first
[32:26] loved me and now because I love him
[32:29] there's nothing I need to do in the way
[32:32] of Works to earn his love amen or or to
[32:35] or to Merit salvation amen but now
[32:38] because I love him amen now I want to do
[32:41] things that please him not so that he'll
[32:43] love me and save me but because he loved
[32:47] me amen he extended his grace to me and
[32:49] saved me because he first loved me and
[32:51] now there's a reciprocation in my heart
[32:54] that loves him and now my works is not a
[32:57] merit to attain anything in God my works
[33:01] are simply a love token back to him
[33:05] praise God
[33:07] and so now you know we've been talking
[33:09] on this line for uh several Services now
[33:11] how does kills legalism because legalism
[33:14] to me legalism kills Freedom amen
[33:17] because now everything we do we do to
[33:19] get
[33:20] we do because we do out of fear of like
[33:24] I'm afraid of if I don't do this I'll be
[33:27] lost if I don't do this I'll be rejected
[33:29] if I don't do this a curse will come in
[33:30] my life
[33:32] or if I do this I'll be blessed if I do
[33:35] this I'll receive if I do this I'll get
[33:37] and when we when we come that way then
[33:40] there's really no unselfish love
[33:45] because all of our love is based on
[33:48] ourself
[33:50] so legalism is a disaster
[33:55] because if if my wife only did for me
[34:00] because she was afraid I would reject
[34:02] her that she's not doing for me because
[34:04] she loves me she's doing for me for her
[34:09] or if one of my children only comes and
[34:12] does an act of kindness and service to
[34:14] me so that in the next breath they can
[34:16] ask for five bucks to go do something
[34:20] then they never brought me a cup of
[34:23] coffee because they loved me they
[34:24] brought me a cup of coffee because they
[34:26] love themselves
[34:29] that makes sense
[34:31] so now that this the genuineness of
[34:35] Revelation amen takes us back into the
[34:38] genuine love of God that I don't need to
[34:40] do anything to earn his love neither can
[34:43] I do anything to remove me from his love
[34:45] my I'm secure in him
[34:49] from before the foundation of the world
[34:51] so now that's without Merit amen now now
[34:54] listen we're not taking away of the
[34:56] whole of the whole issue in this life of
[34:58] cause and effect amen the things we do
[35:01] there'll be in effect and we'll suffer
[35:02] consequences and all that that has
[35:04] nothing to do with God's love for us
[35:05] that has everything to do with our
[35:06] education in this life
[35:08] so that we learn how things work amen
[35:11] but it has nothing to do with God's love
[35:12] for us
[35:14] okay
[35:15] so now
[35:17] legalism is a selfish love
[35:20] it's a self-centered selfish love
[35:25] and I would say this too liberalism is
[35:27] as well
[35:29] liberalism is a self-centered love
[35:33] because it takes all God's love and
[35:35] focuses it on you
[35:37] and now you can do anything because God
[35:39] loves you and God will Overlook
[35:40] everything I do because God loves me but
[35:42] there is no love back to God
[35:45] and no Selfless Love Back to God
[35:49] so legalism is self-centered love
[35:52] liberalism is self-centered love
[35:55] but brother mantos truth is always right
[35:57] down the middle
[35:59] we love him because he first loved us
[36:01] and now his love is expressed in Grace
[36:05] amen and salvation election is the
[36:08] evidence of his love and all that he did
[36:10] amen and sinning has only begotten son
[36:12] into the world to suffer and die in my
[36:14] place so that I could be reconciled back
[36:16] to him these are all expressions of his
[36:18] love for me amen now there's such a love
[36:20] in me I want to express love back to him
[36:23] not to get something not for fear of
[36:25] losing something but just because I love
[36:28] him
[36:30] I don't pray to earn points
[36:34] it's not a frequent Shopper card
[36:37] I don't read my Bible read the message I
[36:39] don't do that to earn something with God
[36:43] I just love to commune with him
[36:50] right amen
[36:55] how do you think a wife feels
[36:58] when her husband starts spending a lot
[36:59] of time with her asking if he can take
[37:01] her to dinner and pours her a cup of
[37:03] coffee and and and and and asks if he
[37:05] can rub her feet
[37:08] and she's all sudden she feels loved and
[37:10] cared for and a few minutes later he
[37:12] says um the guys were talking about
[37:14] going on a fishing trip and
[37:16] I was wondering what you thought about
[37:18] all of a sudden
[37:21] you just deflated the whole thing she
[37:24] realized you're only showing her love so
[37:26] that you can go do something
[37:28] you're wanting to appease her
[37:31] and get get her sympathetic towards you
[37:35] because you're not sure how you it's
[37:37] completely self-centered
[37:40] and it will not equal love to her
[37:44] and if you and if you think I'm lying
[37:46] ask your wife later
[37:49] it will not equal love and in fact it'll
[37:52] have the adverse effect and I wonder how
[37:54] all of our our actions towards God how
[37:57] God views it amen
[37:59] and and sometimes I get tired of myself
[38:01] I don't like myself but what I want to
[38:03] do is I want to love God because God
[38:05] first loved me
[38:06] I want to serve him out of pure motives
[38:09] out of a pure heart and pure desire I
[38:11] want to serve him when nobody's looking
[38:12] I'm going to serving when there's nobody
[38:14] counting and there's nobody keeping
[38:15] score and I want to love him anyways
[38:20] amen why because he first loved me
[38:24] and now God has taken away all of our
[38:27] insecurity by the revelation of the hour
[38:29] I don't have to doubt whether I'm saved
[38:31] I don't have to doubt whether he loves
[38:33] me I don't have to doubt whether I'm
[38:34] secure I don't have to doubt whether
[38:35] I'll make it in the Rapture or not he's
[38:37] taken away so much doubt amen so that
[38:39] I'm not plagued by all of these
[38:41] pressures amen the revelation of the
[38:43] hour took pressure off the bride so that
[38:46] the bride could be a genuine bride and
[38:49] just express love back to him
[38:51] not out of all these fears and these
[38:53] torments and these uncertainties and
[38:55] insecurities amen the message came to
[38:58] take away the bride's insecurity
[39:01] and the real true revelation of the
[39:04] scripture amen was restored to us to
[39:06] bring back a genuine Security in Christ
[39:10] so that now I'm free free free
[39:15] to do what's in my heart
[39:19] and if I have the right heart what's in
[39:22] my heart is to serve God with all of my
[39:24] heart
[39:25] because it's a peace of God lodged down
[39:28] in my soul amen when it comes to life
[39:30] under the baptism the holy ghost that
[39:32] peace of God is magnetized to God
[39:36] and all these two things can do is pull
[39:39] one another together
[39:41] amen it's the word in me it's the word
[39:44] outside of me amen it's Christ in me
[39:47] it's Christ outside of me and these two
[39:49] things are magnetized towards one
[39:51] another if we can take all the
[39:53] roadblocks out of the way amen there's a
[39:55] natural there's a natural attraction to
[39:58] pull the seed back to the originator
[40:02] but there's always religious roadblocks
[40:04] in the way amen and the message came to
[40:06] remove all of these roadblocks
[40:10] so that we can be free
[40:13] to be who we were always intended to be
[40:16] let's go to Romans chapter 4.
[40:28] so I've said before and I it has really
[40:30] been on my heart
[40:33] if we preach the message in such a way
[40:35] that it creates an insecurity
[40:38] then I believe we're doing a disservice
[40:42] through the message of the hour
[40:44] if it if it makes you uh afraid that
[40:49] you'll never make it and I'm not talking
[40:50] about preaching that brings Godly
[40:51] conviction
[40:53] because if we're if we're not living the
[40:55] word if we're off the word we need to be
[40:57] convicted of that
[40:58] so that the the enemy in our life can be
[41:01] exposed and be rooted out because it's
[41:03] hindering us from our expression of love
[41:04] so I'm not talking about that but I'm
[41:07] talking if we keep preaching in a way
[41:08] that brings insecurity amen and and if
[41:12] and if I preach in a way that creates an
[41:14] insecurity
[41:16] many times it's because of my insecurity
[41:21] if I if I need you to need me so that I
[41:26] feel good about myself then I will
[41:28] preach in a way that creates a need in
[41:31] you for me
[41:33] you need to hear me I've got the
[41:36] Revelation if you stick with me you'll
[41:38] be okay amen and many times preaching
[41:41] that way all I'm doing is covering my
[41:44] insecurity
[41:46] and I'm creating an insecurity to cover
[41:49] an insecurity
[41:52] and to me that's deadly
[41:55] that's why I said God help me
[41:58] I pray all the time God help me Heal Me
[42:00] restore me give me the right Revelation
[42:02] so that I know regardless of whether I'm
[42:05] accepted by everyone or rejected by
[42:07] everyone that doesn't make any
[42:09] difference on who I am
[42:11] and and I have to constantly remind
[42:13] myself of that amen because there's
[42:15] times amen if I if I need my gift to
[42:20] equal salvation
[42:22] think about this if I need to have an
[42:26] effective Ministry to be saved
[42:29] then I have to create uh the illusion of
[42:34] effect
[42:36] whatever I believe is effective
[42:39] would that be through legalism to get
[42:41] everybody to look right amen then I'm
[42:43] going to preach legalism if everybody
[42:45] looks right I feel like I have an
[42:46] effective Ministry because I need an
[42:48] effective Ministry to feel like I'm
[42:49] right
[42:51] this makes sense
[42:54] if I feel like an effective Ministry is
[42:56] is looking the part or dynamic uh uh
[43:00] manifestations of the spirit I'll preach
[43:02] all of that to get whatever I feel like
[43:05] is effective amen and when I see that it
[43:08] brings the security back to me because I
[43:10] have effective Ministry if I have an
[43:12] effective Ministry I must be a Son of
[43:14] God chosen of God and be in right
[43:15] standing with God
[43:17] which could be completely opposite from
[43:19] the truth
[43:23] so parents can do this same thing to
[43:26] their children
[43:28] right so we have to be careful that
[43:31] we're always carrying the word from a
[43:34] position of security not insecurity
[43:37] that as a father we instruct our
[43:39] children amen not because I'm worried
[43:41] about what anybody else in the church
[43:43] will see in my son or daughter but I
[43:46] care about their soul
[43:48] and I'm ministering the word to the soul
[43:51] because what happens with them doesn't
[43:54] change my position with God
[43:58] does that make sense
[44:00] so it's why we we always and when
[44:02] dealing with one another amen we always
[44:04] want to deal in the word from a position
[44:07] of security knowing who we are and no
[44:10] matter what this person thinks about me
[44:11] or feels about me it can hurt it can
[44:14] cause me uh emotional distress but it
[44:16] cannot change God's love for me
[44:20] amen and and you know there's sometimes
[44:23] when you're preaching and there's things
[44:25] that you have to hit on the things you
[44:27] have to preach and people get quiet
[44:30] right
[44:31] because sometimes they need to be quiet
[44:37] and if I'm insecure in the Revelation
[44:39] God's given me then all of a sudden I
[44:41] need a response from the people amen so
[44:44] then I then that oh I'm going to get in
[44:47] trouble but I just don't know how else
[44:48] to say things
[44:49] then I will go to catchphrases and
[44:52] Cadence
[44:53] to get amends
[44:55] because the amen makes me feel good and
[44:58] people are amen and Cadence
[45:00] not content
[45:03] does that make sense
[45:06] and sometimes
[45:08] amen we need to sit quiet and catch the
[45:11] content
[45:14] so that we can say Amen
[45:17] and I'm just like everybody else I love
[45:19] to hear amens it makes me feel good this
[45:21] response there's a pool and talk when it
[45:23] goes dead quiet I'm unnerved
[45:26] it it frazzles me I wonder what's going
[45:29] on but sometimes it's just the subject
[45:32] you're dealing with that people are
[45:33] sitting and absorbing and it has to be
[45:35] that way and I have to be confident
[45:36] enough in my position with God and who I
[45:38] am that whether quiet or loud I want to
[45:41] take and Minister the word
[45:44] if not I always end up ministering the
[45:46] same way same way same way to get the
[45:47] same results because it makes me feel
[45:49] good
[45:50] but I don't want to stand here to make
[45:51] me feel good in fact I don't stand here
[45:53] and make me feel good I can tell you
[45:54] that
[45:55] Beyond any shadow of a doubt
[45:58] so that's why our security must be in
[46:00] him and nothing else
[46:02] not in people's opinion of me not in my
[46:05] standing in the church not not in in in
[46:08] whatever he thinks of my family not with
[46:11] what everybody thinks of my Ministry or
[46:13] my gift or my whatever amen my security
[46:16] must be in him and if my security is in
[46:19] him alone now I can have a reciprocal
[46:22] love and all the works I can do can be
[46:24] without false motive they can be genuine
[46:30] Hey listen I don't think any of us there
[46:32] are 100 yet but that's what I'm striving
[46:34] for
[46:35] that's my goal amen I may not have
[46:37] hitting that perfect all the time but
[46:39] that's what I want amen I want my love
[46:43] gifts to God to be genuine and without
[46:45] false Merit or without false motive
[46:50] I want to serve him because I love him
[46:53] not to get something not to impress
[46:55] somebody not because I'm I'm afraid of
[46:57] losing something but just because I love
[46:59] him that's to me pure religion
[47:04] that's genuine affection for God and
[47:07] that's really what I want with all of my
[47:08] heart and so like I said I may fail that
[47:11] a thousand times over but it's what I
[47:13] want
[47:13] it's when I'm present towards and I
[47:15] believe that's what's available in this
[47:17] age with the message that we have
[47:19] I believe the revelation of the hour
[47:21] amen came to take away the scare in this
[47:24] fear
[47:25] brother said I want to take away the
[47:27] scare and this fear you don't know who
[47:29] you are you're not will be but you are
[47:31] now the Sons and Daughters of God and if
[47:34] you are now the Sons and Daughters of
[47:35] God you don't have to try to be you are
[47:37] now
[47:39] why because he designated you that
[47:41] because you were part of him you were in
[47:43] his thinking before the foundation of
[47:44] the world he loved you there and he
[47:46] still loves you here
[47:49] amen
[47:50] so now we don't have to put on a show
[47:52] for anybody
[47:53] we don't have to perform
[47:56] listen if you put peacock feathers in a
[47:58] crow and call it a peacock it's still a
[48:01] Crow
[48:04] and if you put peacock feathers in your
[48:05] children
[48:07] to make them look like a believer
[48:09] but they're not converted they're still
[48:12] unconverted
[48:18] now I still believe in holding a
[48:19] standard in our home
[48:21] but what they need is conf they need to
[48:24] be converted
[48:25] not reformed they don't need to be
[48:27] conformed
[48:29] into the image of the church they need
[48:30] to be conformed into the image of Christ
[48:33] by a conversion
[48:35] so that's why we want to speak not to
[48:37] the flesh we want to speak to the seed
[48:39] we want to speak to the soul when we
[48:41] instruct our children we don't instruct
[48:43] them so that we can look good in front
[48:44] of everybody else we instruct them
[48:45] because we want to give instruction to
[48:48] the seed on the inside and see if we can
[48:49] Quicken it
[48:50] we want to teach them the ways of God
[48:52] the knowledge of God the word of God
[48:54] Amen so that we can draw a life from the
[48:57] inside out
[48:59] not from the outside
[49:01] amen
[49:04] praise God listen did I return to Romans
[49:07] 4
[49:08] all right let's read Romans 4. Romans 4
[49:11] verse 9.
[49:15] cometh this blessedness then upon the
[49:17] circum circumcision only or upon the
[49:20] uncircumcision also
[49:22] for we say that Faith was reckoned to
[49:24] Abraham for righteousness
[49:26] how was it then reckoned when he was in
[49:28] circumcision or an uncircumcision not in
[49:31] circumcision but in uncircumcision
[49:33] and he received the sign of circumcision
[49:36] a seal of the righteousness of the faith
[49:39] which he had yet being uncircumcised
[49:41] that he might be the father of all them
[49:43] that believe though they be not
[49:45] circumcised that righteousness might be
[49:47] imputed unto them also so the imputation
[49:50] of righteousness wasn't for Abraham only
[49:51] it's for us
[49:54] for for what he believed God and it was
[49:57] imputed him for righteousness what do
[49:59] you need to do for the imputation of
[50:00] righteousness believe God
[50:03] let's keep reading here and the father
[50:05] of circumcision to them who are not of
[50:07] circumcision only but who also walk in
[50:09] the steps of the Faith of Our Father
[50:11] Abraham which he had being yet
[50:13] uncircumcised so what Paul is dealing
[50:15] with here is he's dealing with the Jews
[50:17] and with the Gentiles circumcised and
[50:18] uncircumcised and he says when was Faith
[50:21] reckoned to Abraham amen when he was
[50:24] uncircumcised before he came to
[50:25] circumcision he believed God imputed at
[50:29] the end of righteousness and he gave him
[50:31] a seal of his faith and the Seal of his
[50:33] faith was circumcision
[50:35] amen and now amen uh Paul tells us that
[50:39] the true circumcision the true Jew is
[50:40] not one circumcised in the flesh but the
[50:42] one who circumcised in the heart
[50:45] so now the true circumcision amen is the
[50:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:49] and the baptism Holy Ghost is our seal
[50:52] unto the day of our Redemption amen but
[50:54] what is God sealing God Amen is sealing
[50:57] us because of the faith
[51:00] because we believe
[51:03] the question is how do We believe We
[51:07] Believe by Grace how do we get by Grace
[51:09] it's of no merit of our own amen it's
[51:11] because of his great love where we loved
[51:13] us amen always before the foundation in
[51:15] the world he chose us in Christ amen in
[51:17] his grace amen is extended to us and by
[51:20] Grace he's given us Faith to believe and
[51:22] by faith to believe he declares his
[51:24] righteous when he declares those
[51:25] righteous and sees that we have genuine
[51:27] Faith then he seals our faith with the
[51:29] circumcision of the baptism of the Holy
[51:31] Ghost
[51:34] how hard did you work for that
[51:41] you see
[51:43] it's not something you
[51:45] work and work and working working work
[51:47] to get
[51:48] Abraham didn't work and work and work
[51:50] and work and work and work and work to
[51:51] get to see you
[51:53] what he did is he took God at his word
[51:55] he believed God
[51:56] and his actions testified that he
[51:58] believed God
[52:00] and God gave him the Seal of his faith
[52:06] amen
[52:08] praise God
[52:10] we'll get into more of that in a minute
[52:14] and in the breach brother Venom said
[52:16] another thing a seal signifies is
[52:18] ownership
[52:20] so Abraham believed we believed God it
[52:23] was imputed him for righteousness and
[52:25] God sealed his faith
[52:27] with the Seal of circumcision
[52:30] if we believe God now listen Abraham it
[52:33] didn't say Abraham believed in God
[52:35] Abraham believed God
[52:38] and to believe God is to believe the
[52:40] present tense truth of God to believe
[52:42] what God is saying and doing right now
[52:46] so he believed God
[52:48] and it was imputed in the Horizon as he
[52:51] was justified by faith through Grace
[52:53] by the grace of God he was given the
[52:55] ability to believe by faith amen now
[52:58] he's Justified declared righteous and
[53:01] then after that God put a seal God gave
[53:04] him a seal of circumcision
[53:07] for us when we believe God God now will
[53:11] if he recognizes our faith he'll seal it
[53:14] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[53:17] he will do it
[53:22] praise God
[53:24] another thing a seal signifies is
[53:26] ownership the seal has a mark on it
[53:28] shows ownership
[53:29] so it shows who you belong to
[53:31] when you're bought by the blood of Jesus
[53:34] Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost you
[53:36] no longer belong to the world or
[53:37] anything pertaining to the world you are
[53:39] owned by God
[53:41] and another thing is a seal is a
[53:44] security
[53:47] seal means you are secured
[53:50] now you that don't believe in eternal
[53:52] security I don't know but a seal
[53:55] signifies security to its destination
[53:57] woe unto that guy that would try to
[53:59] break that seal and the Holy Spirit seal
[54:01] cannot be broken
[54:04] what is a seal a seal shows ownership
[54:06] amen if you're sealed by the Holy Ghost
[54:09] you belong to God Amen and a seal also
[54:12] is security to its destination amen and
[54:15] that's why that seal will not be broke
[54:17] until I die and when I die I go to my
[54:20] theophany or when my body changes I and
[54:22] I meet my theophany amen that's when
[54:24] that seal will be broken for me
[54:26] until then I'll be under the Seal of God
[54:30] amen let's keep going and I got a few
[54:32] comments I want to make but I want to
[54:33] read a few other things and the message
[54:35] the baptism of the holy spirit says well
[54:38] you say now brother Branham I guess once
[54:40] and Grace always in grace that brings a
[54:42] lot of disgrace
[54:43] but when a man or woman has been born of
[54:45] the spirit of God old things have passed
[54:47] away All Things become new and he's been
[54:50] birthed and blessed by the Eternal God
[54:52] and they can no more perish than God
[54:55] himself can perish
[54:57] why because you were with God before
[54:59] it's God's love expressed to you amen
[55:03] and and if you have faith where did you
[55:05] get Faith
[55:07] it's a gift of God
[55:09] it's Ephesians 2 8 if you have faith to
[55:12] believe the word for your day where did
[55:14] you get that Faith amen you got that
[55:16] faith by grace amen by Grace amen we're
[55:19] saved through faith and that not of
[55:20] yourselves it is a gift of God who gave
[55:23] you the faith to believe it came from
[55:25] God because he chose you in him before
[55:27] the foundation of the world
[55:29] you believe there
[55:30] so now you're here when the word comes
[55:33] to you you believe here amen
[55:35] and when you believe in a genuine faith
[55:38] in the genuine word of God Amen and you
[55:41] come God's provided way and God
[55:43] recognizes your faith when he recognizes
[55:45] your faith as genuine Faith he will put
[55:48] a seal upon you and that seal is the
[55:51] Holy Ghost
[55:53] and it shows he owns you and you're
[55:55] sealed to your destination
[55:59] praise God
[56:01] huh
[56:06] so
[56:07] there's a a message that I was looking
[56:10] at and studying there's a little bitty
[56:13] short message in 1964 and July 5th 1964.
[56:18] and it's a little recorded message
[56:19] called private interview
[56:22] if you haven't listened to it I
[56:23] encourage you to go listen to it
[56:25] and in private energy brother Branham is
[56:27] just before he preaches uh the
[56:29] Masterpiece in 1964.
[56:31] he has an interview a private interview
[56:33] with with Georgia Bruce
[56:37] and I just took a couple excorts out of
[56:39] that because I love the way brother
[56:40] Benham deals with this sister
[56:44] and and it it breaks out the
[56:47] conversation between sister Georgia and
[56:49] brother Branham
[56:50] and sister Georgia Bruce says brother
[56:53] Brandon most of all I want the
[56:55] experience that I've been sealed in the
[56:57] Holy Ghost
[56:58] and if God will reveal it to your heart
[57:02] she's questioning whether she's been
[57:04] skilled or not and she's asking God to
[57:06] reveal it to brother Branham so brother
[57:07] Branham can tell her
[57:10] here's what he says
[57:12] I believe with all my heart that you are
[57:14] a real born-again believer sister Bruce
[57:17] praise God
[57:20] how could that Spirit just leave
[57:23] when you get sick you get weary you're a
[57:26] nervous type person this is what I love
[57:29] this woman comes to brother Ben and
[57:30] brother Branham already says he says a
[57:33] few things in there that I'm not going
[57:34] to get into but he he's already saying
[57:36] amen I see your life I watched your life
[57:39] as your Shepherd if I thought there was
[57:40] anything wrong I'd let you know I've
[57:42] watched you for years sister and I've
[57:43] seen the Lord Heal you and brother
[57:45] Brandon now he makes a statement I
[57:46] believe with all my heart that you're a
[57:48] real Born Again believer sister Bruce
[57:51] but then he begins to tell her what
[57:53] she's struggling with
[57:54] what she's struggling with is not that
[57:57] she's not born again
[57:58] what she's struggling with is her own
[58:00] nervous nature
[58:03] and her own nervous nature is creating a
[58:05] question in her mind but there's no
[58:07] question in brother branham's mind
[58:09] there's no question in God's mind
[58:11] there's only a question here because
[58:12] she's a nervous type person
[58:15] this is what I love the proud of God Is
[58:17] So explaining amen what's going on in
[58:20] this sister's life amen so that she can
[58:22] get over this flesh
[58:26] so he says
[58:28] he says when you get sick you get weary
[58:31] and you're a nervous type person
[58:34] Bruce says yes
[58:36] and you get things on your mind see
[58:38] little bitty things it just keeps
[58:40] building up both ways you're going to
[58:42] talk about the positive and negative
[58:43] both ways you'll get somebody on your
[58:45] heart you want to pray for them and get
[58:46] up and pray for you can't rest till you
[58:48] get that person prayed for that's you
[58:50] then take on the other side Satan Maybe
[58:53] Might present something that you and out
[58:56] this way see and then then see you
[58:59] you're a nature and God works and Satan
[59:02] works then when Satan tries to make you
[59:04] believe that you're Nazi you keep
[59:06] building this and maybe this and this
[59:08] and don't look at yourself sister Bruce
[59:13] says the devil's playing on that nervous
[59:15] nature you have God uses it and the
[59:18] devil uses it because when you get
[59:19] somebody on your mind you can't get them
[59:21] off your mind it just rolls around your
[59:22] mind till you get up and pray for him
[59:24] and then it gets off your mind but that
[59:26] same thing the devil uses to torment you
[59:28] and it begins to get you to down and
[59:30] then you say maybe this and now this and
[59:31] you start adding everything together
[59:35] I love this
[59:37] so glad God allowed this to be on tape
[59:41] and delivered for us
[59:45] he says now don't look at yourself
[59:47] sister Bruce
[59:49] this is an amazing piece of advice let's
[59:51] go to Colossians chapter one
[59:59] Colossians chapter 1
[1:00:03] and verse 19.
[1:00:11] Colossians 1 and 19.
[1:00:16] for it pleased the father that in him
[1:00:18] should all fullness dwell
[1:00:20] and having made peace through the blood
[1:00:22] of his cross by him to reconcile all
[1:00:24] things unto himself by him I say whether
[1:00:27] they be things in Earth or things in
[1:00:28] heaven and you that were sometimes
[1:00:30] alienated in enemies in your mind by
[1:00:32] Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled
[1:00:34] in the body of his flesh through death
[1:00:36] to present you holy and unblameable and
[1:00:40] unprovable in his sight
[1:00:45] listen
[1:00:47] the reason
[1:00:49] that he suffered and died on Calvary is
[1:00:52] so that he can present you
[1:00:54] holy and unblameable and unreprovable in
[1:00:59] his sight
[1:01:00] not by your actions or deeds but by his
[1:01:03] action indeed
[1:01:06] but I want to look at this carefully
[1:01:08] between verse 21 and verse 22 because
[1:01:11] there's there's a truth here that
[1:01:13] brother Brennan points to if you look at
[1:01:15] the word reconciled at the end of verse
[1:01:16] 21 and and I'll ask you is there any
[1:01:20] punctuation there
[1:01:21] period comma
[1:01:23] anything nothing
[1:01:25] so that means 21 and 22 are the same
[1:01:28] sentence
[1:01:29] there's no punctuation there's no change
[1:01:31] of thought
[1:01:33] so let's keep reading and you were
[1:01:35] sometimes alienated in enemies in your
[1:01:37] mind by Wicked Works yet now Hatha
[1:01:39] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[1:01:41] through death
[1:01:42] so where were you when he died you were
[1:01:46] in the body of his death
[1:01:49] that's why brother Ben said when he went
[1:01:51] to Calvary you were in him
[1:01:54] amen so you were reconciled you and you
[1:01:58] were enemies in Wicked Works yet now
[1:01:59] hath he reconciled in the body of his
[1:02:02] flesh you were there
[1:02:05] through death to present you holy and
[1:02:07] unblameable and unreprovable in the
[1:02:09] sight brother Benham said God already
[1:02:12] made me pay for my sins when I was in
[1:02:14] him there
[1:02:15] and God doesn't make a man go to
[1:02:17] judgment twice there's no devil jeopardy
[1:02:19] with God is what brother bam says amen
[1:02:21] he doesn't make a God good a man go to
[1:02:23] judgment twice amen it's already been
[1:02:26] paid for amen and I'm already standing
[1:02:28] in judgment now what I choose what I
[1:02:31] believe in my expression amen and
[1:02:32] already declares whether I'm just or
[1:02:34] guilty amen but my my faith in the word
[1:02:37] of God has declared me righteous amen
[1:02:40] because of imputation because of Grace
[1:02:43] giving me Faith to believe the word
[1:02:48] amen
[1:02:49] and so all my wrongs was paid for there
[1:02:52] where was I there
[1:02:55] I was in him
[1:02:58] in his mind
[1:03:00] so I was Secure in the mind of God
[1:03:03] is that eternal security absolutely
[1:03:07] I was Secure in his thoughts before the
[1:03:09] foundation in the world
[1:03:11] then I was in him at Calvary
[1:03:15] and now I'm secure in him at Calvary
[1:03:20] and now I'm in him spiritually by the
[1:03:23] baptism of Holy Ghost he's in me and I'm
[1:03:25] in him and I'm still securing him I'm
[1:03:28] securing him there I was insecuring him
[1:03:30] there and I'm insecuring him here
[1:03:34] because of what he's done and provided
[1:03:36] for me
[1:03:37] now let's look at verse 21 again
[1:03:40] uh verse 22 sorry in the body of his
[1:03:42] flesh through death to present you holy
[1:03:44] and unblameable and unreprovable in his
[1:03:47] sight if
[1:03:49] you continue in the faith
[1:03:51] why because if you discontinue the faith
[1:03:54] it shows that you never had faith
[1:03:56] because faith is a revelation the sea
[1:03:58] was never quickened because that seed is
[1:04:00] the word and can only agree with the
[1:04:01] word
[1:04:02] so this is this is clear so this is not
[1:04:05] once you make a declaration and once you
[1:04:07] make a statement then you're it forever
[1:04:09] know your life after that will declare
[1:04:11] if that was genuine or not
[1:04:13] because you can say things and you can
[1:04:15] have experiences and you can you can
[1:04:17] have all kinds of emotions and workups
[1:04:19] and all kinds of things that happen amen
[1:04:22] but if it doesn't stick that wasn't it
[1:04:25] because it's a new birth a regeneration
[1:04:27] a new life and that new life continues
[1:04:29] on not that you don't backside make
[1:04:31] mistakes have feelings that's not what
[1:04:33] I'm talking about but that new birth
[1:04:34] that Holy Ghost will bring you back to a
[1:04:36] quick repentance and you keep moving
[1:04:38] down the path
[1:04:41] so if you walk away amen it shows that
[1:04:46] it wasn't for you
[1:04:48] so as he says
[1:04:51] you were reconciled in the body of his
[1:04:52] flesh through death to present you holy
[1:04:54] unblameable and reproval and insight if
[1:04:56] you continue in the faith
[1:04:58] not if you keep doing good deeds no
[1:05:01] you're continuing to face shows what's
[1:05:03] inside of you
[1:05:05] and if that seed was inside of you then
[1:05:07] that seed was inside of him at Calvary
[1:05:10] same thing
[1:05:12] praise God
[1:05:14] if you continue in the faith grounded
[1:05:16] and settled and be not moved away from
[1:05:18] the hope of the Gospel which you have
[1:05:19] heard and which was preached to every
[1:05:21] creature which is under heaven where of
[1:05:23] I Parliament made a minister
[1:05:26] Amen brother bam says in the message the
[1:05:28] God of this evil age he says in God's
[1:05:30] Own thinking God the great spirit in the
[1:05:32] beginning before there was a beginning
[1:05:33] he was gone and did you know you were in
[1:05:36] him then
[1:05:37] if you're a Christian now you was in him
[1:05:40] then
[1:05:41] and if that be so the whole God had
[1:05:43] bodily shaped up in the person of Jesus
[1:05:45] Christ and when Jesus died at the cross
[1:05:47] I died with him for I was in him then
[1:05:51] I like reading this he's got the
[1:05:54] authority to make a statement like that
[1:05:55] amen I don't have the authority to make
[1:05:57] a statement like that
[1:05:58] but praise God he unlocked the mystery
[1:06:01] so that the bride can declare the
[1:06:03] mystery
[1:06:04] when Jesus died at the cross I died with
[1:06:06] him for I was in him then for he was the
[1:06:08] fullness of the word manifested knowing
[1:06:11] that we would be manifested later
[1:06:13] and we was at Calvary with him
[1:06:17] I was Secure in him in his thinking I
[1:06:20] was Secure in him at Calvary I'm secured
[1:06:22] by the new birth in him now
[1:06:26] we was at Calvary with him we went in
[1:06:28] the grave with him we raised with him
[1:06:30] and in Resurrection and now we've
[1:06:32] ascended by his Spirit to the throne of
[1:06:34] grace sitting together in Heavenly
[1:06:35] places in Christ Jesus always I'm secure
[1:06:38] in him in Heavenly places now
[1:06:41] and he's in me
[1:06:43] and the father's in him
[1:06:45] and I'm in him
[1:06:48] praise God
[1:06:50] let me go back to the interview with
[1:06:52] sister Bruce
[1:06:53] the next David sister Bruce makes it
[1:06:55] says but
[1:06:56] she says listen
[1:06:58] but I've never had an experience that I
[1:07:01] have been filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:02] that I could put my foot on
[1:07:07] I love this
[1:07:12] all right notice this ordinarily a human
[1:07:14] being is born in sin shaped and iniquity
[1:07:16] come to the world speaking lies that's
[1:07:18] the nature of a human being that was
[1:07:21] your nature
[1:07:22] it changed once but what changed it
[1:07:25] and sister Bruce says Christ
[1:07:27] there you are sister that's it
[1:07:34] I want to read that again
[1:07:37] because it might have just skimmed over
[1:07:38] top the heads
[1:07:40] it's so simple
[1:07:43] she says I want to read her question
[1:07:45] again
[1:07:46] but I've never had an experience that I
[1:07:48] have been filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:49] that I could put my foot on she's not
[1:07:51] saying she hasn't had any experiences
[1:07:53] she doesn't have one she can put her
[1:07:54] foot on and say this is it
[1:07:59] I've never had an experience that I have
[1:08:00] been filled with the Holy Ghost that I
[1:08:02] could put my foot on
[1:08:04] all right notice this ordinarily a human
[1:08:06] being is born in sin shaped and iniquity
[1:08:07] come to the world speaking lies that's
[1:08:09] the nature of a human being Sister Bruce
[1:08:12] says yes that was your nature it changed
[1:08:15] once but what changed it she says Christ
[1:08:19] there you are sister see that's it
[1:08:23] then he goes right to the scripture he
[1:08:25] that heareth my words and believeth on
[1:08:27] him that sent me hath eternal life and
[1:08:30] shall not come to the Judgment but hath
[1:08:31] passed he hath past tense past from
[1:08:34] Death To Life Saint John 5 24 Jesus
[1:08:37] speaking see
[1:08:39] look where brother Branham takes her
[1:08:41] confidence immediately brother Brenham
[1:08:43] never says did you speak in tongues did
[1:08:46] you have this experience did you have
[1:08:48] that immediately brother Branham asked
[1:08:50] her if her nature changed she said who
[1:08:52] changed it she said Christ then he goes
[1:08:54] right to the scriptures because he has
[1:08:56] to give her security that will not
[1:08:59] change
[1:09:03] he has to give her something her faith
[1:09:06] can rest upon and Faith only rests upon
[1:09:09] the word of God
[1:09:11] emotional things come and go but the
[1:09:13] word of God doesn't change
[1:09:17] so he goes right to the scripture he
[1:09:18] that heareth my words and believing on
[1:09:21] him that sent me half
[1:09:22] Eternal you already have it amen
[1:09:25] and shall not come to the Judgment but
[1:09:27] past tense pass from death into life
[1:09:30] praise God
[1:09:31] here's what brother remember says in the
[1:09:33] message of God's preparation from 1954
[1:09:35] he said but look
[1:09:37] if you've gotten if you've got not
[1:09:39] brother Branham but if you've got thus
[1:09:41] saith the Lord
[1:09:42] just let the storms howl
[1:09:45] and you say I got saved brother Madam I
[1:09:47] I know I did because I felt real good
[1:09:50] the devil can beat you around the stump
[1:09:53] every day on that
[1:09:55] because at some point you'll feel really
[1:09:57] bad
[1:10:01] and at some point you'll make a really
[1:10:03] bad mistake
[1:10:08] he said the devil will beat you on a
[1:10:09] stump every day on that I'm not saved
[1:10:12] because I feel real good I'm not saved
[1:10:14] because I shout I'm not saved because I
[1:10:16] see Visions I'm not saved because I
[1:10:18] preached the gospel I'm saved because
[1:10:21] I've met the conditions of God's word
[1:10:26] and he goes right into the scripture
[1:10:28] he that heareth my words and believeth
[1:10:30] on him that sent me has everlasting life
[1:10:33] the devil can't beat you around on that
[1:10:36] that's thus saith the Lord meeting him
[1:10:39] right in the face
[1:10:43] praise God
[1:10:45] where did brother man go to the
[1:10:47] scriptures amen where is the foundation
[1:10:49] in the word amen what has God done for
[1:10:51] us he's open to us the word
[1:10:54] so that we can have a security that
[1:10:56] nothing else will bring everything else
[1:10:58] can be doubted the word can't be doubted
[1:11:02] now
[1:11:06] praise God
[1:11:08] I'm saved because I meet the condition
[1:11:10] of God's word I have come God's provided
[1:11:13] way I believe not because I tried or I
[1:11:17] want to but I just believed
[1:11:19] amen and then I changed
[1:11:23] God did something something brother
[1:11:26] Graham says something actually happened
[1:11:27] it's not it's not like you say well I
[1:11:30] believe that you just keep moving on and
[1:11:31] there's absolutely no change in life
[1:11:33] amen that's not what brother Bear's
[1:11:35] talking about there has to be a change
[1:11:37] amen the seed Quicken a new birth a
[1:11:39] transition something on the inside
[1:11:41] actually has to change
[1:11:44] that's the experience of the new birth
[1:11:46] is a change
[1:11:48] amen so it's not like a a a a
[1:11:51] Reformation or a mental agreement and we
[1:11:54] come to the statutes of the church or
[1:11:56] even the the teachings of the message
[1:11:58] and now we come and we line up with all
[1:12:00] of that but if there's no change on the
[1:12:02] inside then there's not a change there's
[1:12:03] got to be a change on the inside
[1:12:07] Hallelujah
[1:12:09] that's what brother Ben said to Sister
[1:12:10] Bruce you changed you changed didn't you
[1:12:16] in the masterpiece
[1:12:18] brother Branham has this interview with
[1:12:20] sister Bruce and he goes immediately out
[1:12:22] and he preaches the Masterpiece and in
[1:12:23] this quote he's referring back to his
[1:12:25] interview with sister Bruce
[1:12:27] says now we find that the antelopean
[1:12:29] world came along and destroyed the whole
[1:12:30] thing because the covenants that was
[1:12:32] made was made conditionally if you will
[1:12:34] not do this or if you will do that God
[1:12:36] the great sculptor seen that man could
[1:12:38] not could not keep a covenant he just
[1:12:40] can't do it there's just no way at all
[1:12:43] on the interview a few moments ago he's
[1:12:46] speaking about sister Bruce's interview
[1:12:47] on the interview a few moments ago I was
[1:12:49] speaking to a person in the room that's
[1:12:51] present now said but brother Branham I
[1:12:54] have so many things I know that's wrong
[1:12:56] and a Godly little woman and what she
[1:12:58] said to brother bear says but brother
[1:12:59] Branham I make so many mistakes
[1:13:02] that was her objection brother pointed
[1:13:05] to her changed life pointed to the word
[1:13:06] but her objection to what brother man
[1:13:09] I'm saying was but I make so many
[1:13:11] mistakes
[1:13:12] now look at what he says here he's
[1:13:14] referring back to the interview
[1:13:16] I said but look sister you don't look at
[1:13:19] yourself
[1:13:21] it's just what your desire is and what
[1:13:24] you try to do and if you really love the
[1:13:26] Lord you try to serve him with all your
[1:13:28] heart and then all your mistakes is hid
[1:13:31] in the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:34] see he made a way
[1:13:37] Amen brother manmaster she said I make
[1:13:39] some mistakes he says yeah but what's
[1:13:41] your desire she says I loved him with
[1:13:43] all my heart he said that's what he's
[1:13:45] looking at
[1:13:46] he's looking at what you are on the
[1:13:48] inside not what you are on the outside
[1:13:50] God can take care he's already taken
[1:13:53] care of this Fallen flesh and the Fallen
[1:13:56] flesh condition and all that goes with
[1:13:58] it he's looking at what you genuinely
[1:14:00] are on the inside
[1:14:02] that's what matters and the new birth
[1:14:04] brings the genuine seed to a genuine
[1:14:07] life that's what he's looking at and it
[1:14:10] changes your desires from what it was
[1:14:12] amen now everything in you wants to love
[1:14:14] him and please him and serve him with
[1:14:16] all of your heart
[1:14:17] and though you make mistakes like sister
[1:14:19] Bruce did she makes a lot of mistakes
[1:14:21] those you make a lot of mistakes amen
[1:14:24] you realize that that's what the blood
[1:14:25] is for amen may he make a lot of
[1:14:27] mistakes but it doesn't change my desire
[1:14:29] and I hate my mistakes
[1:14:33] before I loved my mistakes
[1:14:37] or at least I had no problem walking in
[1:14:39] them continually at least now I've got
[1:14:41] to turn from I got to make it right I've
[1:14:43] got to repent I gotta tell God I'm sorry
[1:14:45] I I can't just go on like that anymore
[1:14:48] why because my desires have changed
[1:14:54] amen
[1:14:56] in the message the conflict between God
[1:14:58] and Satan from 1962 the prophet says
[1:15:00] don't reason
[1:15:02] don't try to reason it
[1:15:05] it hasn't got no reasonings you just
[1:15:07] believe it
[1:15:09] you don't reason a thing because
[1:15:11] remember the only way that you can
[1:15:12] accept God Is by faith not by reasons
[1:15:15] not by understanding not able to explain
[1:15:18] you don't explain nothing you believe
[1:15:20] something
[1:15:21] I love that
[1:15:25] he says
[1:15:26] not what you feel Jesus that Jesus never
[1:15:29] said did you feel it he said did you
[1:15:31] believe it that's right you just believe
[1:15:33] what God Said I can't explain to you how
[1:15:35] how the greatest miracle that I can
[1:15:38] think of is a man who just like take a
[1:15:41] pig and tell that pig you know you're no
[1:15:44] more a pig you're a lamb and he becomes
[1:15:47] a lamb that would be hard to believe
[1:15:50] well it's the same thing takes place
[1:15:52] when you become converted from a sinner
[1:15:54] to a Christian
[1:15:55] it changes your own opinions it changes
[1:15:59] your own will it changes everything
[1:16:01] that's in you and it brings you into
[1:16:04] another life and gives you another
[1:16:06] spirit that bears forth another record
[1:16:10] then your old life has to die and then
[1:16:12] the new one has to be born again
[1:16:14] and then you see you're no more the
[1:16:16] creature you was at all that's when you
[1:16:18] become behind the blood fortified with
[1:16:20] the word don't try to explain nothing
[1:16:22] just believe it and go on
[1:16:24] how does it work I don't know it just
[1:16:26] works something changed in me and now
[1:16:28] all I want is to serve God and please
[1:16:30] him and every time I fail I'm miserable
[1:16:33] at my failure
[1:16:34] do I fail yes I fail amen sister Bruce
[1:16:38] failed brother Branham failed amen
[1:16:40] everybody fails
[1:16:43] that's why I've said over and over I'm
[1:16:45] so glad that we had a prophet that was
[1:16:47] honest that would stand in the Pulpit
[1:16:48] amen and tell about lying to the uh
[1:16:51] lying to the to the lawyer he would talk
[1:16:54] about when he told God God you owe me an
[1:16:56] explanation he would tell us about
[1:16:57] standing in the Gap when he wanted to
[1:16:59] fulfill his selfish desire and run away
[1:17:01] from the ministry and run away from the
[1:17:02] people and God's rebuke he told us all
[1:17:05] of that and you know why he told us all
[1:17:06] of that because he didn't need you to
[1:17:08] have a good opinion of him to be saved
[1:17:13] foreign
[1:17:14] he didn't need to leave look perfect in
[1:17:17] your eyes to equal salvation he didn't
[1:17:19] need you to put him on a pedestal he
[1:17:22] could knock his own pedestal out and
[1:17:23] come crashing down because it changed
[1:17:25] nothing with him and God
[1:17:29] he could be honest because his mistakes
[1:17:31] didn't change who he was
[1:17:36] I think it's amazing amen we were so
[1:17:38] afraid to be honest about where we are
[1:17:41] and honest about our mistakes and honest
[1:17:43] about that listen that has nothing to do
[1:17:45] with who I am who I am I am by
[1:17:47] Revelation by faith amen by what God has
[1:17:50] done for me not what I've done
[1:17:53] and I made a whole load of mistakes
[1:17:57] still making them
[1:17:58] daily
[1:18:00] but praise God Amen you know
[1:18:04] the Bible says confess your faults to
[1:18:07] one another
[1:18:09] and pray for one another
[1:18:10] confess your faults to one another and
[1:18:12] pray for one another
[1:18:13] well if they know what I have fault
[1:18:15] still think this and then listen it
[1:18:18] doesn't matter what they think
[1:18:20] I mean it matters we don't want to we
[1:18:22] don't want to throw stumbling stones at
[1:18:23] people's feet we understand we have to
[1:18:25] have wisdom we can't just be Reckless
[1:18:28] but I'm not here to preserve my
[1:18:30] reputation I have no reputation
[1:18:33] and if I feel like I need to preserve my
[1:18:35] reputation I'm in the wrong mental state
[1:18:39] brother Branham didn't try to protect
[1:18:41] his reputation
[1:18:43] amen and I'm so glad that he was honest
[1:18:46] are you glad he was honest
[1:18:48] it gives me a whole lot of hope so so
[1:18:50] sister Bruce said I made a lot of
[1:18:52] mistakes brother Ben said he's not
[1:18:53] looking at that
[1:18:54] he's looking at your desire I make a lot
[1:18:57] of mistakes I'm glad he's not looking at
[1:18:58] that he's looking at my desire so now
[1:19:00] I'm not afraid of my mistakes
[1:19:04] because there's already been an advocate
[1:19:06] there's an advocate with her father
[1:19:07] there's already a blood atonement
[1:19:08] there's already something to take care
[1:19:10] of it
[1:19:11] and so fearful of that I'm not so
[1:19:13] fearful to make mistakes not so fearful
[1:19:15] somebody finding out my mistakes not so
[1:19:17] fearful because it's my reputation in
[1:19:19] the eyes of man are not what I'm
[1:19:21] concerned about my reputation my the
[1:19:23] thoughts that God has towards me that's
[1:19:24] what I'm really concerned about
[1:19:27] and I as a as a i as a person and I hope
[1:19:31] us as a bride we want to move above the
[1:19:34] carnal above all of this stuff and get
[1:19:37] up to where we have a genuine Revelation
[1:19:38] and recognize Hey listen we fail we make
[1:19:42] mistakes but God's not looking at that
[1:19:44] he's looking at the desire in my heart
[1:19:49] amen
[1:19:51] and then we don't have to be so worried
[1:19:53] about looking perfect in the eyes of
[1:19:54] everybody else
[1:19:57] we don't have to be under such pressure
[1:20:00] that nobody ever sees me make a mistake
[1:20:02] and I never do anything wrong listen
[1:20:05] don't put peacock feathers in a crow
[1:20:10] a sheep Bears wool
[1:20:13] a peacock puts out peacock feathers
[1:20:18] a born-again Believer lives lives a
[1:20:21] Christian Life
[1:20:22] and he doesn't have to worry about his
[1:20:24] mistake along the way that mistake along
[1:20:27] the way cannot offset what God's done
[1:20:29] for him and also should not change his
[1:20:31] whole life
[1:20:33] we should be bearing wool
[1:20:35] amen how do you bear wool brother Chad
[1:20:37] don't think hard you don't try hard the
[1:20:40] Sheep all it does is live and wool comes
[1:20:42] out
[1:20:43] all the peacock does is eat and live and
[1:20:46] the peacock feathers come out amen so
[1:20:48] listen what what a Christian Life is the
[1:20:51] natural byproduct of being a Christian
[1:20:55] it should come as a natural life
[1:20:58] so there shouldn't be so much pressure
[1:21:00] to look a certain way or to have a
[1:21:02] certain speech or to say a certain thing
[1:21:03] or use certain phrases and act like we
[1:21:06] know certain things and understand
[1:21:07] certain doctrines we shouldn't be under
[1:21:09] that pressure amen what we should be is
[1:21:11] free to know that God before the
[1:21:13] foundation of the world has determined
[1:21:15] who I am and by faith I believe and I
[1:21:17] connect back to what was in God's mind
[1:21:21] and now whatever I need to know he'll
[1:21:23] reveal it to me
[1:21:25] whatever whatever I I need to do he'll
[1:21:29] reveal it to me I just want to live a
[1:21:31] consecrated humble Christian Life and
[1:21:34] let wool come out
[1:21:37] not worry so much as well is that not
[1:21:39] wool is it the right color wool
[1:21:41] just live a Christian Life
[1:21:44] in the message paradox
[1:21:48] he says
[1:21:50] for instance I believe that every
[1:21:52] born-again member of the body of Christ
[1:21:54] is a paradox in themselves
[1:21:56] I believe each one of you methodists and
[1:21:58] Presbyterian and Lutheran that never had
[1:22:00] the experience had never had experience
[1:22:03] the baptism the Holy Spirit was in a
[1:22:04] formal church that did not believe in
[1:22:06] the genuine New Birth and has now
[1:22:08] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:09] is a perfect example of a paradox
[1:22:12] because something happened to you that
[1:22:14] changed your whole being
[1:22:16] and anyone can look at that and know
[1:22:18] what a paradox is a miracle and unless
[1:22:21] that happens you cannot be a Christian
[1:22:25] unless that happens you cannot be a
[1:22:28] Christian
[1:22:29] there must be a paradox for you to
[1:22:31] become a Christian because no one can
[1:22:33] change a spirit in a man and give him a
[1:22:36] new birth outside of God
[1:22:41] I can't give it to you
[1:22:43] I can't I can't do anything all I can do
[1:22:46] is invite you to seek God all I can do
[1:22:49] is invite you to surrender your life
[1:22:51] invite you to seek after him invite you
[1:22:53] to receive the Holy Ghost all I can do
[1:22:55] is give the word and invite you to
[1:22:57] receive the word and invite you Amen to
[1:22:59] die to yourself and take the word that's
[1:23:01] all I can do but I cannot give it to you
[1:23:04] God is the only one who can give it to
[1:23:06] you no minister no Ministry nothing can
[1:23:09] give it to you only God can give it to
[1:23:11] you
[1:23:12] all a minister can do is show you the
[1:23:14] way show you the path and invite you to
[1:23:17] surrender all and invite you to cry out
[1:23:19] to God invite you to ask God to fill you
[1:23:22] invite you to receive it
[1:23:24] but that's as far as we can go
[1:23:28] amen
[1:23:32] no one can change a spirit in a man and
[1:23:36] give him a new birth outside of God
[1:23:40] alone is the only one can do it and it's
[1:23:43] a miracle how that God can take a man's
[1:23:45] thinking and his ways and his life and
[1:23:47] everything and change it from what it
[1:23:49] was to what it can be what he can make
[1:23:52] it
[1:23:53] over and over brother Brown talks about
[1:23:55] this experience of the new birth he's
[1:23:57] talking about a change something that
[1:23:59] changed changed and didn't change back
[1:24:01] but changed
[1:24:03] a new creature a new creation one that's
[1:24:07] heart is in line with the word and
[1:24:09] following after the word
[1:24:10] from here
[1:24:12] on out
[1:24:14] I said God that reality that was in your
[1:24:17] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:24:19] make it a reality to each of us
[1:24:23] my security
[1:24:25] is in his thinking
[1:24:27] I'm securing him at Calvary
[1:24:30] I'm secure now seated in him in Heavenly
[1:24:33] places in Christ Jesus and I'm secure
[1:24:36] with him in me
[1:24:39] praise God let's all stand
[1:24:42] musicians if you'd please come
[1:24:53] praise God
[1:24:57] amen
[1:25:00] are you happy
[1:25:03] are you thankful that God brought us
[1:25:06] a messenger that can give us
[1:25:08] the mystery that was in the back part of
[1:25:10] God's mind and take all the loose sins
[1:25:13] that had gotten lost through these these
[1:25:15] these these two thousand years and tie
[1:25:17] them back together so that we won't be
[1:25:19] stuck in this scare and this darkness
[1:25:21] and this misunderstanding but we would
[1:25:23] know who we really are
[1:25:26] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:25:29] by grace
[1:25:32] that we were there
[1:25:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:25:38] and if we started there we're going to
[1:25:40] wind up there
[1:25:42] if we begin there to start our journey
[1:25:43] we're going to finish our journey there
[1:25:45] and now all the things that happen in
[1:25:47] between God has already made a way to
[1:25:49] take care of those things but I came
[1:25:51] from God and I'm going back to God how
[1:25:53] do you know brother Chad because I
[1:25:54] believe it in my heart
[1:25:57] I don't have a certificate I can't can't
[1:25:59] give you a DNA test from this physical
[1:26:02] blood amen there's nothing I can do to
[1:26:04] prove to anybody else amen the only
[1:26:06] evidence I have is faith because faith
[1:26:08] is a substance of things hope for the
[1:26:10] evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:26:12] so the only evidence that I carry is my
[1:26:14] faith that he's unlocked in my heart
[1:26:16] that I believe and I know that he's
[1:26:18] changed me
[1:26:20] I know what I was and I know what my
[1:26:21] desires were and I know how incapable I
[1:26:24] was of taming this flesh
[1:26:27] but I know what he did for me and I know
[1:26:29] the change that took place in my life
[1:26:31] and now because he first loved me all I
[1:26:35] want to do is serve him in love
[1:26:39] pure love
[1:26:42] unselfish love
[1:26:45] amen God bless you thank you ever song

[1:29:04] come my way and I'm so appreciative what
[1:29:06] a solid rock we're standing on in the
[1:29:08] hour in which we're living we better not
[1:29:09] take it for granted I just wanted to
[1:29:12] give you a little update from last
[1:29:13] Sunday service it was a real honor and
[1:29:16] privilege to be able to go down to
[1:29:17] Junction City and um we went down on
[1:29:20] Saturday night and got there was about
[1:29:23] two hours and 45 minutes away and I
[1:29:25] didn't want to be late so we went down
[1:29:27] Saturday night and had some fellowship
[1:29:28] with the brother that evening for about
[1:29:30] three hours and wonderful Fellowship
[1:29:32] that evening with the brother and then
[1:29:34] went to church that morning and on the
[1:29:36] way there you know just following the
[1:29:37] directions and as we're pulling up
[1:29:39] there's a great big church I'm like wow
[1:29:42] they reserve a church or something cars
[1:29:44] everywhere we're pulling in there and
[1:29:45] there's a little garage off to the side
[1:29:48] by a little house and saw brother Wesley
[1:29:50] and that was church and it made me
[1:29:52] excited I got real happy and I said you
[1:29:54] know here's a little three-car garage
[1:29:55] kind of simple real simple the inside
[1:29:58] was some a whole bunch of chairs and a
[1:30:02] whole bunch of hungry Hearts sitting
[1:30:04] there ready for the word a little
[1:30:05] propane heater trying to knock the heat
[1:30:07] off the room and off the air and I says
[1:30:09] this is just about right God hiding
[1:30:12] himself in Simplicity revealing himself
[1:30:14] in the same way and you know it just
[1:30:16] follows the pattern there was no end
[1:30:18] that could it could be welcome in and he
[1:30:20] was pushed out of all the great big
[1:30:21] places and he found himself in a little
[1:30:24] hungry heart you know and found himself
[1:30:26] at a a well one day with a woman that
[1:30:29] was an unrighteous woman but in her
[1:30:31] heart she was Desiring to serve God we
[1:30:33] had a wonderful wonderful time you know
[1:30:37] me I'm about a one-hour preacher maybe 1
[1:30:39] 10 I guess maybe if if things are
[1:30:41] pulling right and I went two hours and
[1:30:43] got halfway through my notes on just a
[1:30:45] little thought on let there be light and
[1:30:47] taking the light and it's God's word
[1:30:49] separating light from the darkness and
[1:30:50] Genesis and then into John and that life
[1:30:53] was manifested as the light and now it's
[1:30:55] walking in the light as he is in the
[1:30:56] light and by God's grace that light came
[1:30:58] my way so I could stand there as a
[1:31:00] witness of the light and express that
[1:31:03] light the best that I could do and I was
[1:31:05] just happy and honored that God would
[1:31:07] give me the opportunity to put a little
[1:31:09] water on some seeds that have been sowed
[1:31:10] and they're really coming to life it was
[1:31:13] really fun brother Wesley showed up and
[1:31:16] brother Brock showed up and a couple
[1:31:18] surprises there so we had a nice little
[1:31:20] 30 35 something people in there and it
[1:31:23] was a wonderful wonderful time and the
[1:31:25] brother Arvin at the end he's like my
[1:31:27] only prayer is brother I don't want you
[1:31:28] to leave and I was like well I'm sorry I
[1:31:30] got a whole bunch of young people at my
[1:31:32] house I got to get back to so we had a
[1:31:35] wonderful time keep them in prayer
