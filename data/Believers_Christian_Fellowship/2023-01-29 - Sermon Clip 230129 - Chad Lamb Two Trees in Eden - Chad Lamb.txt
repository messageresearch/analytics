TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I only want to sow Christ seed the true word the revelation of the true word I don't want to mix my own thoughts I don't want to add my own and listen there's no way that we're going to get away from Human preaching and in human and that's called the foolishness of preaching because it is absolutely foolish if there's any way to make something bad ineffective broken and prone to failure is put it in humanity I mean tell me which Corporation runs perfect which government entity runs perfect which home runs perfect which one of you are perfect the the most likely the way to make something prone to failure is put it in Fallen Humanity put in their hand but yet God has put preaching of the word he's put himself on partnership with man and he's made preaching of the word his method and we can't get away from that but yet it's prone to failure and then Paul you know Paul instructs ministers to take what he's taught them and pass it out to others he's instructing Timothy to instruct what you've learned and share it with others that they may also be faithful teachers and so Paul is administering uh uh admonishing ministers that go out and Minister the word knowing that they're prone to failure and you know what they're supposed to preach what Paul preached is that what brother Brandon preached he preached what Paul preached but he didn't stand up and just read the book of Romans Romans chapter 1 chapter 2 that's the morning service come back we'll read chapter 4 chapter 5. he preached what Paul preached but he preached amen by inspiration through a human vessel the spirit of God working and it was prone to failure amen but he was preaching what Paul preached and now to preach the message is not just to stand up and read a list of quotes say amen and we all sit down because I'm so afraid of failing that all I can do is say verbatim What the prophet said and nothing else that's not preaching but God uses human vessels prone to failure amen and then he starts doing Supernatural things as he brings his word and he begins to do it in such a way that you can say that is not my brother up there because he doesn't know what happened yesterday what's going to happen tomorrow the decision I have to make this after he doesn't know these things now I'm watching God in a failed vessel through a weak method come in a perfect way and Minister the word to me and it's dangerous and prone to failure and has failed millions of times but it's still his method
