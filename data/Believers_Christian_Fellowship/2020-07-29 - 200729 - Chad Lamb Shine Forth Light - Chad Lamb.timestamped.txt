[0:26] all through life's turning
[0:33] from earth to glory
[0:39] i only have
[0:44] to be like

[0:52] to be like jesus
[1:00] to be like jesus
[1:07] on earth i love
[1:13] to be like
[1:21] all through life's journeys
[1:28] from earth to
[1:33] glory
[1:36] i only
[1:44] [Music]
[1:49] what a goal to have in life i think that
[1:52] is the goal friends
[1:54] i mean let's just uh bow our heads and
[1:56] pray before we read
[1:59] lord jesus we thank you father that
[2:02] you've put inside of us a desire to be
[2:04] like you
[2:06] not the model after the world lord not
[2:08] to model after a
[2:09] sports hero or a figure a figurehead or
[2:13] a political figure or
[2:15] some star that the world calls a star
[2:17] but god you've put it in our heart to be
[2:19] like you
[2:21] and we know to be like you we have to be
[2:23] like the word lord
[2:25] so you've come in this day and revealed
[2:26] the word so we knew what to be like
[2:29] god we ask now that you would take this
[2:31] word and further unveil it to our hearts
[2:34] lord
[2:34] that we might be more like you that
[2:37] you'd have preeminence among us that you
[2:38] would take control
[2:40] and god that we would yield ourselves in
[2:42] a greater way to you
[2:44] lord that all willfulness would fade
[2:46] away all selfishness and self-desire
[2:49] lord would we'd lay it on the altar lord
[2:51] and you would strip it from us
[2:53] then we might be a clean vessel that you
[2:55] can use for your glory
[2:57] while we just pray that you would have
[2:58] greater preeminence than you've ever had
[3:00] in us as individuals
[3:02] that you'd shine forth the light of your
[3:04] glory in a greater way
[3:06] god take control of this service take
[3:07] control of these lips lord
[3:09] speak your eternal words lord to the
[3:11] hearts of your people
[3:13] we receive your word in jesus christ's
[3:15] name we pray
[3:16] amen while we're standing just before
[3:19] we're seated let's take our
[3:21] bibles and turn to the book of
[3:22] revelation
[3:24] we'll read from revelation verse 21
[3:27] and i'd like to take a subject title
[3:31] shining forth light
[3:32] and it's um if we can do it maybe in the
[3:35] way of a bible study i got a lot of
[3:36] scriptures i'd like to read together
[3:38] so keep your bibles handy but it's a
[3:40] simple thought it's not a complex
[3:42] thought it's a simple thought
[3:44] but it has deep impact deep meaning
[3:47] it's it's amazing how simple thoughts
[3:49] run deep
[3:51] and so i i want to look at this together
[3:53] and just take some time here for this
[3:54] wednesday night
[3:55] and look at this subject revelation 21
[3:58] verse 9.
[4:00] revelation 21-9 and there came unto me
[4:02] one of the seven angels which had the
[4:04] seven vials full of the seven last
[4:06] plagues
[4:07] and talked with me saying come hither i
[4:09] will show thee the bride
[4:11] the lamb's wife and he carried me away
[4:13] in the spirit to a great and high
[4:15] mountain and showed me that great city
[4:17] the holy jerusalem descending out of
[4:20] heaven from god
[4:22] having the glory of god and her light
[4:25] was likened to a stone most precious
[4:27] even like a jasper stone
[4:29] clear as crystal so i want to hone in on
[4:32] this last verse
[4:33] having the glory of god and her light
[4:37] her light was like unto a stone most
[4:40] precious even a jasper stone
[4:42] clear as crystal you can be seated
[4:47] so this is a verse 11 is
[4:50] is where i want to draw our context
[4:54] for our text and i want to spend some
[4:56] time on this
[4:57] and i want to look at a couple things
[4:59] because
[5:01] it's interesting that it would say her
[5:03] light is likened to a stone
[5:05] most precious because the stone doesn't
[5:08] have light
[5:10] and that's what's interesting about this
[5:11] is what caught my attention
[5:13] in this scripture and i think it's
[5:14] written this way specifically for a
[5:16] reason
[5:16] because the stone doesn't have any light
[5:18] of his own
[5:20] because the only light that a stone
[5:21] would have even as we think stone
[5:24] we think rocks out there but but if we
[5:26] think of gems
[5:27] gems are also stones diamonds gems
[5:30] rubies emeralds all of these other
[5:32] stones
[5:32] and these stones don't have lights of
[5:34] their own but they reflect light
[5:37] it's reflected light and so when we look
[5:40] at the light or the brilliance or the
[5:41] luster
[5:42] of a diamond or of an emerald of a ruby
[5:45] amen
[5:46] what it is what's sparkling our eye and
[5:48] what is catching our attention and the
[5:49] light or the fire
[5:50] that is coming from this gem is actually
[5:53] light that's reflected back
[5:55] out of the gem it's light that has come
[5:57] in and light that's reflected back out
[6:00] and so i think it's interesting that her
[6:02] light is likened to a stone
[6:04] which means which means she's reflecting
[6:07] light
[6:09] likened to a stone most precious even
[6:11] like a jasper stone
[6:13] clearest crystal and uh there's a few
[6:17] few things we want to gather out of that
[6:18] that i found to be most interesting
[6:20] if i could just make a few notes i'll
[6:23] give you a few of my notes
[6:25] jasper if you look at jasper jasper's
[6:28] one of the stones that's mentioned
[6:30] it's a gem that's mentioned in the bible
[6:32] several times
[6:33] but but one of the times that jasper's
[6:35] mentioned is in the breastplate that
[6:37] aaron wore that had the 12 stones
[6:39] representing the 12 tribes of israel and
[6:42] so
[6:42] this jasper stone we know is the 12th
[6:45] stone mentioned
[6:46] it's on the fourth row it's the third
[6:48] gem on the fourth row
[6:49] making it the twelfth amen and it
[6:51] represents each of these stones
[6:53] represent one of the tribes
[6:54] amen and this stone represents benjamin
[6:57] or the last tribe
[6:59] and it's funny now that we've come down
[7:00] to the end of time the end of the
[7:02] gentile dispensation
[7:04] and right at the very end there'll be a
[7:06] revelation of the bride
[7:08] a revelation of new jerusalem and her
[7:11] light
[7:11] will be not the first not the second not
[7:14] the third but the last amen
[7:16] little benjamin jasper jasper
[7:20] is an interesting word in the hebrew
[7:22] because jasper
[7:23] is taken from a root word and that root
[7:26] word
[7:27] means to polish polish
[7:30] i don't think there's any mistakes here
[7:32] that we we've come to the end
[7:35] to the very end of time the end of the
[7:37] gentile dispensation the end of the
[7:38] church ages
[7:39] and there's going to be a manifestation
[7:41] or a revelation of this great city and
[7:43] brother branham would preach about this
[7:45] in future home
[7:46] amen the new jerusalem the pyramid
[7:48] shaped city amen
[7:50] and and even in future home brother
[7:52] brennan would come to a place where he
[7:53] said
[7:54] i i'd like if it'd be all right i could
[7:56] drop a little something here
[7:58] amen that's good words those are good
[8:00] words when he says something like that
[8:02] you know the radars go up the antenna
[8:04] goes up you'd like to drop a little
[8:06] something and he's talking about the
[8:07] dimensions of this city
[8:08] that'll be after the millennium in the
[8:11] new heavens and new
[8:12] earth the city that descends and rests
[8:14] over top the mountain that'll push up
[8:15] in palestine and he's describing in 1500
[8:19] miles this way and this way and 1500
[8:21] miles high
[8:22] and he's describing it thoroughly but
[8:23] then he says if you'd like i could drop
[8:25] a little
[8:26] something here and he's looking at those
[8:27] that have gathered into the church to
[8:29] hear the message
[8:30] and he says it's about what's
[8:32] represented here right now
[8:34] we have people gathered from maine to
[8:36] saskatchewan amen from the rocky coast
[8:38] of maine down
[8:39] down into uh georgia and he's showing
[8:41] about 1500 miles represented here
[8:44] and brother venom is showing that this
[8:46] city is already reflected on earth
[8:50] the city is already being reflected on
[8:52] earth amen because brother brahm told us
[8:54] that
[8:54] our life here is only a reflection of
[8:56] that life over there
[8:58] amen what's over there is being
[8:59] reflected here said if there's a tree
[9:01] struggling to live here it shows there's
[9:03] a tree over there
[9:04] that doesn't struggle to live but
[9:05] there's a man struggling to live here
[9:07] it shows there's a man over there that
[9:09] doesn't struggle to live
[9:10] this life is a reflection of that life
[9:15] i got something for you that will make a
[9:17] few of you excited i just came across
[9:18] today
[9:19] brother ben said these things on earth
[9:20] are reflection of those things over
[9:22] there
[9:23] he said listen even spiders and lizards
[9:26] and snakes
[9:28] are representing demons over there
[9:32] that'll make my girls happy they hate
[9:33] spiders
[9:35] it's okay to hate them because they
[9:36] represent something evil
[9:40] that's why you don't like snakes
[9:44] amen praise god so brother branham is
[9:47] teaching us a lesson
[9:48] in this life there's a reflection going
[9:50] on of that one over there
[9:52] even reflection of some evil things
[9:55] so that brother is telling us in future
[9:57] home that there's a representation or a
[9:59] reflection or a type
[10:01] of that city being expressed on the
[10:03] earth
[10:05] and so we want to look at that when we
[10:06] see this that now we've come to jasper
[10:08] to the last stone
[10:10] and this jasper like i said comes from
[10:13] the root word means to polish
[10:16] this stone is not it's not
[10:20] taken just out of the earth and
[10:23] placed as a gem it's taken out of the
[10:26] earth
[10:27] and it's polished and the act of
[10:30] polishing it or what's called cutting
[10:32] cutting a gem or cutting a diamond
[10:34] the act of cutting it amen is what what
[10:37] really gives it the ability to reflect
[10:40] back light and all of the color and all
[10:41] the brilliance and all the luster and
[10:43] all the fire
[10:44] amen is in the cutting but but
[10:47] i looked it up to see they don't
[10:49] actually cut a diamond if you look at a
[10:51] diamond they don't actually cut a
[10:52] diamond
[10:53] they call it cutting a diamond but what
[10:54] they actually do is
[10:56] polish it and then polish it and polish
[10:58] it and grind it down
[11:00] amen and that's how they get all the
[11:01] angles
[11:03] all those little angles on that diamond
[11:05] amen they've got a wheel that spins
[11:07] that's got diamond dust on it
[11:09] amen and does iron sharpen its iron
[11:12] diamond sharpener diamond amen they
[11:15] place it on the wheel and they begin to
[11:16] cut
[11:17] this diamond in the shape amen and when
[11:19] the master craftsman amen he's got a
[11:21] plan in his mind
[11:22] it's already drawn out what this diamond
[11:24] will be and then he took the rough
[11:26] diamond
[11:27] out of the earth and it was given to a
[11:28] master craftsman and that
[11:30] craftsman amen he could see what kind of
[11:33] diamond that he could get out of this
[11:34] shape
[11:35] amen and he begins amen in order to get
[11:38] this
[11:38] diamond to reflect back in its full
[11:40] luster and brilliance
[11:42] its full capacity the maximum capacity
[11:45] to reflect light
[11:46] amen there has to be material taken away
[11:49] not material added
[11:54] god has plucked us out of the earth as
[11:56] his rare gems that are in the earth
[11:58] amen and what he's got to do is he's got
[12:00] to grind away
[12:02] amen some excess material that came from
[12:05] mom and dad or grandpa or grandma
[12:07] or wherever it came because there's
[12:09] already in his mind
[12:11] he knows the potential of this gem and
[12:14] what it can do
[12:15] what it can be and how it can shine and
[12:17] the master craftsman is working
[12:20] tirelessly day and night to grind away
[12:22] or to
[12:23] polish amen this jasper stone is
[12:25] polished stones that's in this new
[12:27] jerusalem
[12:29] we've come into this earth amen well
[12:31] i'll say like this in a rough condition
[12:34] or in a rough shape but god knows where
[12:36] every gem is lying he knows where every
[12:38] stone in this new jerusalem is lying
[12:40] amen and he finds the stone amen in his
[12:43] hand
[12:44] he begins to polish or remove material
[12:47] remove willfulness remove selfishness
[12:51] remove complexes
[12:55] and what's he trying to do he's trying
[12:57] to get this
[12:58] stone which is stone is revelation
[13:03] he's trying to get this stone to reflect
[13:06] back light
[13:07] in a brilliant way in a beautiful way
[13:12] and this new jerusalem comes down
[13:16] like a jasper stone
[13:19] a great revelation from god a jasper
[13:22] stone
[13:23] clears crystal it's amazing there's a
[13:26] lot of ways that you can
[13:28] rate gems and clarity is one of them
[13:31] diamonds are the same way but this
[13:34] jasper stone
[13:35] it's it's really interesting the way the
[13:37] bible writes this
[13:39] because the jasper stone is not really a
[13:41] clear stone it's not one of the
[13:43] the clear stones but it's the right word
[13:45] because it comes from the root to polish
[13:47] because this stone
[13:48] is going to have to be polished this new
[13:49] jerusalem had to be shaped had to be
[13:51] formed
[13:52] had to be polished and then it's clear
[13:55] as crystal
[13:56] and then when you look at this word
[13:57] clear as crystal i started to reflect on
[14:00] that
[14:01] and clear is crystal means there's
[14:03] nothing to hinder the reflection of the
[14:06] light
[14:08] there's no self
[14:11] there's no cloudiness there's no self
[14:14] there's
[14:15] nothing to diminish the reflection of
[14:18] light
[14:18] and that is what god is looking for when
[14:21] he brings his new jerusalem down
[14:22] as a bride ordained for her husband he's
[14:25] looking for some
[14:26] a stone amen that's been taken off the
[14:28] earth that has been polished and
[14:30] polished and polished
[14:31] and it's a stone that is clear as
[14:35] crystal see that's what jesus christ was
[14:38] he was a stone that was clear as crystal
[14:40] because there was no
[14:42] willfulness in jesus christ that would
[14:44] hinder the will of god
[14:46] i mean you see him in gethsemane
[14:48] battling it out there's a battle between
[14:50] the will
[14:51] he had a will jesus christ had a will
[14:53] that he had to surrender
[14:54] to the will of god amen and he would
[14:58] jesus christ proved in gethsemane that
[15:00] he was clear as crystal
[15:03] because there was no willfulness no self
[15:04] will no self desire no selfishness
[15:07] amen that would hinder the plan of god
[15:09] and that's this new jerusalem coming
[15:11] down
[15:12] like a jasper stone a polish stone clear
[15:14] as crystal
[15:15] and now when we see that we see the goal
[15:17] that god has in his mind
[15:19] and i say this friends this the goal
[15:21] that god had in his mind has in his mind
[15:22] for you and me
[15:24] this is the goal that he has in his mind
[15:27] for you and me
[15:28] amen it doesn't matter how deep and dark
[15:30] and mysterious we were
[15:32] when we were laying in this earth it
[15:33] doesn't matter what deep dungeon he
[15:35] plucked us out of
[15:36] what deep mind out of what myri clay
[15:39] or what stony place that he pulled us
[15:41] out of amen it doesn't matter he knew
[15:44] where we were
[15:45] he knew what we were made of and he
[15:46] knows what our potential is
[15:48] and his goal is to have a jasper stone
[15:50] clear as crystal
[15:51] to do what to shine her light
[15:56] what light do you and i have that we're
[15:58] gonna shine the only light that we have
[16:00] is to reflect his light
[16:04] and his light is his word amen and the
[16:07] thing that the bride is reflecting this
[16:08] day
[16:09] is his word
[16:13] see brother branham says in in the
[16:16] message question and answer is law
[16:17] having a shadow
[16:19] said all things of shadows and types
[16:21] when god made the heavens and the earth
[16:23] he made the moon to shine in the absence
[16:26] of the sun to give light while the sun
[16:27] was gone
[16:28] a beautiful type of christ in the church
[16:30] the church is the moon
[16:31] to give the light to the world while the
[16:33] sun is gone
[16:35] see what i mean a lesser light amen and
[16:37] then otherwise the moon and the sun is
[16:39] husband and wife as christ in the church
[16:40] is husband and wife
[16:42] the wife being the weaker vessel only
[16:44] gives a smaller light
[16:45] in the absence of her husband and the
[16:47] church can only
[16:48] make manifestations of the holy spirit
[16:51] and remember
[16:52] the moon cannot give any light of her
[16:53] own and when you see the moonlight it's
[16:55] not the moonlight it's the reflection of
[16:57] the sunlight
[16:59] but the bible refers to the moon giving
[17:01] her light
[17:03] right and it's it's same same
[17:05] terminology
[17:06] the moon giving her light and brother
[17:08] batman tells us it's not her
[17:09] light it's reflected light off of the
[17:11] sun and what is the moon the moon is a
[17:13] rock
[17:15] a stone representing the bride
[17:18] a stone that is reflecting the light
[17:20] from the sun
[17:21] amen the original light reflecting off
[17:24] of this stone
[17:25] or this revelation of the bride of wife
[17:27] amen is reflecting back to earth
[17:29] amen so this concept is not is
[17:32] is not new to us we understand this
[17:35] brother brethren taught it to us the
[17:36] scriptures declare it
[17:39] and let's let's look at our scripture
[17:40] again in verse 21 revelations 21
[17:45] 18. and the building of the wall of it
[17:49] was jasper and the city was pure gold
[17:52] like unto clear glass we come back to
[17:55] the same thing it's pure gold it's deity
[17:59] deity tabernacled in humanity
[18:03] but deity pure gold
[18:07] pure deity clear as glass
[18:11] so when we start thinking about gold
[18:13] it's not like the gold you have around
[18:14] your finger
[18:15] this is deity that's clear
[18:19] glass clear is glass no that means
[18:21] there's nothing to obstruct
[18:23] the view of the light nothing
[18:27] nothing to diminish the light whatsoever
[18:31] this city when this city comes down and
[18:33] rest upon the earth
[18:34] there'll be nothing nothing in the
[18:37] construction of this city
[18:38] that will diminish the light from
[18:40] shining out from the city one io to one
[18:42] drop
[18:43] and and and furthermore i would say just
[18:46] like in a diamond
[18:47] amen this is just brother chad but just
[18:50] like in the diamond
[18:51] amen that diamond the reason that you
[18:53] get luster and shine
[18:54] is because there's all those angles on
[18:56] the diamond amen and when the light
[18:58] comes in it reflects
[18:59] back and forth through the diamond until
[19:01] it shoots out
[19:03] right and that's what gives it sparkle
[19:06] and luster
[19:07] and what they call fire that comes out
[19:08] and all the colors that come out
[19:11] because the colors are in the light
[19:14] the seven colors of the rainbow are in
[19:15] the light amen but the light when it
[19:18] comes in is
[19:18] white light and reflects around now
[19:21] different panels
[19:22] amen in this diamond starts showing
[19:23] different colors of light and different
[19:25] flashes and different sparkles
[19:26] as you move it around and then because
[19:28] it's cut to do that
[19:29] it's cut to fully display what's in the
[19:32] light
[19:35] amen not not just like a mirror to
[19:38] signaling off but this stone
[19:39] amen where the light will come through
[19:41] the stone and and bounce back and forth
[19:43] in the stone and come
[19:44] out brilliant bright amen shining forth
[19:48] in all angles
[19:50] i think the bride is the show the
[19:52] fullness of the word in all angles
[19:54] all seven church ages all seven colors
[19:56] everything reflecting back the
[19:58] full word of god on display
[20:04] clear his glass verse 22
[20:08] and i saw no temple therein for the lord
[20:10] god almighty in the lamb or the temple
[20:12] of it
[20:13] and the city had no need of sun neither
[20:15] of moon to shine in it
[20:17] for the glory of god did lighten it and
[20:19] the lamb
[20:20] is the light thereof
[20:24] see this city was going to shine forth
[20:27] her light but her light
[20:31] is the light of god and the lamb is the
[20:34] light thereof
[20:37] and the nations of them which are saved
[20:40] shall walk in the light of it
[20:42] and the kings of the earth do bring
[20:43] their glory and honor into it
[20:46] see this light was to shine forth unto
[20:49] the nations of the earth
[20:51] come into the city and and god is the
[20:54] light thereof the lamb is the light
[20:56] thereof
[20:57] god lightens it but the lamb is the
[20:59] light thereof amen we know that the lamb
[21:01] sits at the top amen the capstone that's
[21:03] come down the throne is at the top
[21:05] of this great pyramid amen and the light
[21:07] comes down through
[21:08] and reflects out of the city amen and
[21:11] shines to the kingdoms of the world
[21:14] what does that mean brother chad that's
[21:16] the role that we're supposed to be
[21:18] playing
[21:18] right now this is the job of the bride
[21:21] in this day
[21:22] come to the jasper stone the last stone
[21:25] the polish stone
[21:26] amen with the lamb amen the headstone
[21:28] connected to the body the capstone has
[21:30] come
[21:30] down and what was the capstone the
[21:33] fullness of the word that was coming
[21:35] amen to be manifest and that fullness of
[21:37] the word the body
[21:38] the head would rest upon the body and
[21:41] the body would become the manifestation
[21:44] of the headship the head amen didn't
[21:47] manifest the body
[21:49] manifest what's in your head what comes
[21:51] from your mind
[21:52] acts out in your body and that's the
[21:54] same thing that's supposed to be
[21:55] happening now
[21:56] that the the capstone has come amen
[21:58] christ has come
[22:00] the light has come the word has come the
[22:02] full illumination of the full word of
[22:04] god has come
[22:05] and now is supposed to be shining down
[22:08] amen through this city
[22:10] that's on earth now reflecting that city
[22:12] that's coming
[22:15] and through seven church ages been
[22:17] polished polished
[22:18] polished polished polished but it's got
[22:21] to come to the place
[22:23] where it is clear as crystal
[22:28] to shine this light of the lamb
[22:32] brother bam says in revelation chapter 4
[22:35] from 1961
[22:36] how would you all like to see him
[22:38] sitting upon his glory
[22:40] let's turn over in revelation 21 10
[22:42] right quick and just look
[22:43] at him here and he carried me away in
[22:46] the spirit to a great high mountain and
[22:47] showed me the great city the holy
[22:49] jerusalem descending out of heaven from
[22:50] god
[22:51] having the glory of god having the glory
[22:53] of god and her light
[22:54] was likened to a stone most precious
[22:57] like a jasper as clear as crystal
[22:59] her light the the light who is the light
[23:02] and the city had no need of sun because
[23:03] the lamb was the light thereof
[23:05] jasper sorry to stone the glory of god
[23:07] is jesus christ
[23:09] the glory of jesus christ is his church
[23:13] catch that the glory of god is jesus
[23:16] christ
[23:17] the glory of jesus christ is his church
[23:21] so when jesus christ came on earth amen
[23:24] god had made himself a body to dwell in
[23:26] the light came the holy ghost came the
[23:29] light connected to that body and he was
[23:31] living his light through that body
[23:33] and jesus christ became the glory of god
[23:37] but now jesus christ fulfilled his role
[23:40] but who's going to shine forth the glory
[23:42] of jesus christ
[23:43] but the glory of jesus christ is the
[23:45] church
[23:47] is the bride is new jerusalem
[23:50] let's turn to first peter
[23:58] first peter chapter 2.
[24:07] first peter chapter 2 verse 4
[24:11] to whom coming is unto a living stone
[24:14] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[24:16] god
[24:17] and precious he all he also has
[24:20] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[24:23] house a holy priesthood to offer up
[24:24] spiritual sacrifice
[24:26] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[24:29] so we know he was the first stone to
[24:31] come
[24:32] the cornerstone then from that
[24:34] cornerstone
[24:35] all the other stones were were put
[24:38] together and he says it's living stones
[24:40] and stones that are alive
[24:41] fleshed out alive on this earth living
[24:44] stones
[24:44] or let's put it this way living
[24:47] revelations of the word
[24:49] we say that way a stone represents a
[24:51] revelation and we have to recognize
[24:54] that we as an individual an individual
[24:56] in our size
[24:58] selves are a living stone in this temple
[25:01] and a living stone is a flesh a live
[25:04] revelation
[25:04] of the word in this day not we could say
[25:08] the bride is the brightest the brightest
[25:10] and that's absolutely true
[25:11] but it's got to come down to the
[25:12] individual that i
[25:14] have to be a living stone in this temple
[25:16] i have to be polished as a
[25:18] as a jasper stone i have to be clear as
[25:21] crystal
[25:22] i have to be shining forth the light i
[25:25] have to be
[25:26] a revelation of this word it's not good
[25:28] enough
[25:29] to be near the revelation in this word
[25:31] it's not good enough to be in a church
[25:32] that preaches the revelation of this
[25:34] word
[25:34] but god's goal is for me as an
[25:36] individual stone to be
[25:38] a revelation of this word
[25:42] amen
[25:46] go down to verse 6 wherever also it is
[25:50] contained in the scripture behold i lay
[25:52] in zion a chief cornerstone
[25:54] elect precious and he that believeth on
[25:56] him shall not be confounded
[25:57] until unto you therefore which believe
[26:00] he is precious but unto them which
[26:02] be disobedient the stone which the
[26:03] builders disallowed
[26:05] the same has made the head of the corner
[26:08] and a stone of stumbling and a rock of
[26:10] offense
[26:11] even to them which stumbled at the word
[26:13] being disobedient whereunto
[26:14] also they were appointed so in this
[26:17] great temple
[26:18] in this great pyramid the cornerstone
[26:21] the first stone
[26:22] amen jesus christ came and fleshed the
[26:24] cornerstone
[26:25] by off that cornerstone was built amen
[26:28] the whole building
[26:29] but he's become the head of the corner
[26:31] or the capping stone
[26:33] when the capping stone comes the light
[26:35] comes
[26:36] when the light comes the light's meant
[26:38] to shine out of the city
[26:40] unto the kings of the world
[26:44] let's go to first john i want to hit
[26:47] several scriptures right here in a row
[26:58] see when when we begin to speak like
[27:02] this
[27:03] you know we've preached this way we've
[27:05] talked this way we've hit this from
[27:06] every angle that we can hit
[27:08] but but sometimes it becomes abstract
[27:11] thoughts i think
[27:13] i think it can sometimes become concepts
[27:16] or or analogies or thoughts like
[27:20] this is what it's like and this
[27:22] represents
[27:23] uh in some way this represents the truth
[27:25] amen and
[27:26] and i wanted to move from there and show
[27:28] that that these these aren't just
[27:29] concepts amen these aren't just phrases
[27:32] of speech that come in the message but
[27:33] this
[27:34] is how the bible speaks this is what the
[27:36] bible says
[27:37] this is what the bible is describing
[27:40] what our lives are supposed to be like
[27:41] and what our individual lives are
[27:43] supposed to be doing it's got to move
[27:45] from concept to manifestation
[27:47] it's got to move from phrases to a life
[27:50] and if we keep it as phrases and a neat
[27:52] concept and
[27:53] oh yeah the bride is like that city and
[27:55] i see the light coming down
[27:56] and shining out oh yeah that's neat
[27:59] that's neat it's not
[28:00] neat amen it's imperative that it takes
[28:02] place on the earth
[28:05] and we can't keep putting in the future
[28:07] and putting in the future
[28:08] and someday that city will come down
[28:10] some that that city is
[28:12] upon earth now amen the lamb has come he
[28:15] is here
[28:16] living in his temple living in his city
[28:18] amen
[28:19] in within the living stones who are
[28:21] supposed to be
[28:22] amen polished to perfection and clear as
[28:25] crystal
[28:26] shining that light not their self will
[28:28] not their self-desire
[28:30] not their selfishness amen but shining
[28:32] his light
[28:33] from the head down out every single one
[28:36] of these stones
[28:40] i mean it's not it's not acceptable to
[28:43] say
[28:43] oh i saw that light shining through
[28:45] brother bantam it's only acceptable when
[28:47] the light shines through you and i
[28:50] that we reflect her light all of her
[28:53] collectively together
[28:54] individually every individual shining
[28:57] collectively shining forth the light
[29:00] it's got to move away i meant from the
[29:02] idea to the reality
[29:07] that's my greatest desire for my life
[29:09] amen to take
[29:10] amen what god has revealed and let the
[29:13] revelation
[29:14] bring a manifestation
[29:18] first john 1 5
[29:21] this then is the message which we have
[29:23] heard of him and declare unto you
[29:25] that god is light and in him is no
[29:28] darkness
[29:29] at all god is light
[29:32] so when we start talking about light
[29:33] we're talking about god and when we talk
[29:35] about this this light shining it's gone
[29:38] amen there's no darkness in him at all
[29:40] amen so
[29:41] anything that would darken the light is
[29:43] not god
[29:45] we put it that way anything that would
[29:46] diminish the light
[29:48] anything that would obscure the light is
[29:50] not god
[29:51] because there's no darkness in him at
[29:53] all he is light
[29:56] he is love he is the word
[30:00] these are all equal to the same thing
[30:03] that's why the word is light
[30:06] that's why the light is the life of men
[30:10] so when you say the word you could just
[30:12] as easily be saying
[30:13] the life you could just as easily be
[30:15] saying the light
[30:17] you could just easily be saying god we
[30:20] gotta
[30:20] we can't separate these things in our
[30:22] mind and make them different categories
[30:24] well this is god
[30:25] and this is the word and this is light
[30:27] and this is life
[30:28] god is life god is light god is the word
[30:32] the word is light the word is life
[30:35] the light is life do we understand
[30:38] that's how important this is when when
[30:41] the word was restored to us at the
[30:42] opening of the word
[30:43] friends that's not just another concept
[30:45] amen that will start a new movement
[30:47] amen but that was god himself amen
[30:49] making himself manifest to his people
[30:51] and how will he be manifest in this
[30:53] world he's only got
[30:55] one place to shine and that's through
[30:57] this city
[31:01] there's no darkness in him at all let's
[31:03] turn to the gospel of john chapter 8.
[31:10] i don't want to fly through this i'm
[31:11] trying not to fly through it
[31:14] i want to read these scriptures
[31:18] they're familiar we know them
[31:22] quite well but i want to read through
[31:24] them together
[31:28] john chapter 8 verse 12 then spake jesus
[31:30] again unto them saying
[31:31] i am the light of the world he that
[31:34] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[31:37] but shall have the light of life
[31:42] he said i am he i am the light
[31:45] of the world now when jesus was speaking
[31:48] amen if you would have uh been alive in
[31:52] that day
[31:53] you would have thought that the light of
[31:55] the world was the s-u-n that comes up
[31:57] and crosses every day
[31:58] and but but but jesus is speaking of the
[32:01] real light
[32:03] the real light the real life brother
[32:05] said the first the first light that ever
[32:07] shined on the earth was spoken word
[32:08] light
[32:10] and that spoken word light created a
[32:12] sunlight
[32:13] the sunlight is only reflecting a
[32:16] greater light
[32:17] it's only typing another light and jesus
[32:19] says that light that you see that ball
[32:21] of fire that crosses that's not the
[32:22] light of the world
[32:23] he said i am the light of the world
[32:27] i am the light of the world why he was
[32:30] the word
[32:31] made flesh and the word is the light
[32:36] because light has to do with
[32:38] illumination or understanding
[32:40] or revelation
[32:45] let's go to john chapter 9
[32:49] verse 5. jesus says as long as i am in
[32:53] the world
[32:54] i am the light of the world
[33:00] brother bam says with the message who is
[33:03] jesus
[33:04] he's going to make an analogy here he
[33:06] says some time ago i was writing along
[33:07] with a famous doctor of divinity
[33:10] and he preaches the gospel in seven
[33:12] languages and we were talking about god
[33:14] and his attributes and i was speaking
[33:15] about it
[33:16] i said it's like a diamond god is
[33:19] i like this analogy it's like a diamond
[33:22] god is
[33:24] see and then these gifts that you speak
[33:26] of so they're they're just reflections
[33:28] of god's love and i said like in africa
[33:30] the president of the mind and kimberley
[33:32] was one of my ushers in the line
[33:34] he taken me through the diamond mines
[33:35] and kimberly why you can find them
[33:37] laying on the street but you dare
[33:38] keep one unless it's cut it has to be
[33:41] cut
[33:42] so then a great big diamond it doesn't
[33:44] have the fire in it
[33:45] when you find it no it's got to be cut
[33:47] for that
[33:49] it doesn't have the fire in it amen but
[33:51] it's got the potential to have the fire
[33:53] in it but it's going to be cut for that
[33:55] because the fire comes at the reflection
[33:57] of light
[33:58] after it's cut and that was god and he
[34:01] had to be wounded for our transgressions
[34:03] and bruised for our iniquities
[34:05] he is the big diamond and then when you
[34:07] cut a diamond did you ever notice
[34:09] you cut it in a three corner shape and
[34:11] the sun against the
[34:12] that will reflect seven colors he's
[34:14] talking about a prism now
[34:16] and looking red through red looks white
[34:17] did you know that right red through red
[34:19] that's the blood the red blood
[34:21] god's looking at a red center through
[34:22] red blood turns him white he is
[34:25] he is in the heart you see and so now in
[34:28] that
[34:28] said god chipped cut bruce to reflect
[34:31] these rays
[34:32] as it hits the great word of god
[34:34] reflects what god is
[34:37] brother man would take the
[34:41] take even the type of jesus christ being
[34:43] the great diamond
[34:44] and he had to be cut and bruised
[34:48] scourged and beaten to reflect back the
[34:51] light of the word
[34:52] and if jesus christ had to go through
[34:54] that process he wasn't sin born friends
[34:57] what's our process going to be like
[35:01] probably like jasper polish stone
[35:06] let's go over to john 14 now
[35:12] in verse 8.
[35:19] now philip saith in him lord show us the
[35:21] father and it sufficeth us
[35:23] jesus said to him i have been so long
[35:26] time with you
[35:27] and yet hast thou not known me philip
[35:30] he that hath seen me hath seen the
[35:32] father and how sayest thou
[35:34] then show us the father believe us thou
[35:37] not that i am in the father
[35:39] and the father in me and the words that
[35:41] i speak unto you i speak not of myself
[35:43] but the father that dwelleth in me
[35:45] he doeth the works see it's the same
[35:48] concept
[35:49] brother jesus wasn't saying hey hey hey
[35:52] it's all me no he's saying i am
[35:55] reflecting a light it's not me
[35:57] it's the father that's in me reflecting
[35:59] out
[36:01] and he came as an example of a son of
[36:04] god
[36:04] and that example was going to continue
[36:07] on and he came and he said
[36:08] hey it's why do you ask to see the
[36:11] father
[36:13] have i been so long with you that you
[36:14] don't know me amen it's not me this
[36:17] light isn't me he said i'm the light but
[36:19] it's the father
[36:20] in me because jesus christ was the glory
[36:24] of the father
[36:27] but who's the glory of jesus christ
[36:30] so what's the bride shining jesus christ
[36:33] it's not me it's jesus christ
[36:35] in me it's not me it's the word shining
[36:38] in me
[36:38] reflecting back out of me it's not me i
[36:41] don't do any works i have no works that
[36:43] i can do
[36:44] amen if there's anything that i do it's
[36:45] him reflecting back out of me
[36:47] because he took me out of the earth and
[36:49] he's polished and polished and polished
[36:51] and polished and polished so that he
[36:53] could get something
[36:54] when he would shine light in word in he
[36:56] can get a reflection of word to come
[36:58] back out
[37:00] see cain amen was not a precious gem
[37:03] but abel was understand
[37:07] you know you know what diamond is made
[37:09] out of
[37:10] carbon carbon
[37:14] just regular carbon amen you wanna know
[37:16] what carbon is
[37:17] burn anything take a piece of wood and
[37:19] burn it down to black ash that's carbon
[37:23] it doesn't have luster it doesn't shine
[37:25] amen but that
[37:26] carbon amen when it gets caught in the
[37:28] earth through tectonic plates or
[37:30] whatever there's great heat and pressure
[37:32] friction and pressure put on it
[37:34] it presses it together under extreme
[37:36] heat and pressure and it
[37:37] crystallizes and turns it into a rough
[37:39] diamond
[37:41] and then that diamond is plucked out of
[37:43] the earth and then it's then it's shaped
[37:45] and man it's cut and it's polished
[37:46] amen until it can give back the luster
[37:48] and the shine
[37:50] well you can have
[37:54] two beings made out of the same material
[37:58] of the earth
[37:59] carbon and carbon but they can be
[38:02] nothing alike
[38:05] flesh and flesh this vessel's fleshed
[38:08] this vessel's flesh carbon and carbon
[38:11] but one god has prepared amen and god
[38:15] has sent it to the earth and it's a
[38:17] precious gem
[38:18] abel was a precious gem cain was nothing
[38:21] but carbon
[38:25] and they went through a process
[38:28] a process of time when they knew that
[38:30] they were going to have to bring worship
[38:32] amen
[38:32] and they come to the to the gate at the
[38:34] east of eden
[38:35] and they they were going to bring
[38:37] worship amen but abel
[38:39] abel was cut by revelation
[38:45] and abel oh this is so good if we could
[38:48] catch it
[38:49] when the commandment came when the
[38:51] knowledge came or the understanding
[38:53] however it came
[38:54] that god required a sacrifice and god
[38:57] wanted to be worshipped
[38:58] amen cain amen he began to develop his
[39:02] own way of worship his his own desire to
[39:04] worship god in his own plan for proper
[39:07] worship
[39:07] and when cain began to worship amen what
[39:10] he
[39:11] what he gave back to god was not a
[39:13] reflection of the word
[39:16] it was just a reflection of his mind and
[39:19] his desire
[39:20] and his thoughts and his carbon thinking
[39:24] but abel amen when abel gave back to god
[39:28] when abel took a lamb and when abel
[39:32] slit its throat and shed the blood amen
[39:35] abel
[39:35] did that by revelation he had a
[39:38] revelation from
[39:39] god of what happened in the garden of
[39:41] eden amen and that revelation
[39:44] produced a work
[39:47] amen you realize he didn't outwork cain
[39:50] cain outworked him but his works were
[39:53] accepted and cain's works were rejected
[39:56] because what abel reflected back to god
[39:58] amen was
[39:59] revelation based on revelation he
[40:02] received
[40:03] that revelation came into the cut gem
[40:06] and when it reflected back out it shined
[40:09] through the brilliance of obedience by
[40:11] revelation
[40:13] and when he slayed the lamb it proved
[40:16] that he got it
[40:18] god gave him the revelation amen but
[40:21] when he actually took the lamb
[40:22] and when he actually slayed the lamb and
[40:24] shed the blood
[40:26] it proved that this was a gem the light
[40:29] came in
[40:30] the light reflected around inside and
[40:32] the light came back out
[40:33] and brilliance and in beauty of
[40:35] obedience to the revelation of the word
[40:39] that's why sometimes we get individuals
[40:42] who get so
[40:43] confused sometimes about obedience and
[40:46] then they start to look at legalism and
[40:48] obedience legalism has nothing to do
[40:50] with it it's obedience by revelation
[40:53] amen that's why sometimes you'll see
[40:56] amen a brother or sister i mean they're
[40:58] always walking the edge of the line
[41:02] always you know my my skirt goes past my
[41:05] knees brother venom said the knees and
[41:07] but you see it's so tight and clingy
[41:09] that it shows the form off and shirt the
[41:12] same way
[41:15] and they say but brother brown said i
[41:17] got the quote but you realize there's
[41:20] no revelation of what he was talking
[41:21] about he wasn't talking about a skirt
[41:24] below the knee he was talking about your
[41:26] virtue and your femininity and holding
[41:28] on to that virtue
[41:29] as a sacred trust god gave you and
[41:31] covering your body and keeping it for
[41:33] god and for your husband
[41:36] but when all we saw was the rule or the
[41:38] ordinance or the
[41:39] we we got the word what was that word
[41:42] that word was a bright and shining light
[41:44] but when that word hits
[41:46] carbon
[41:49] corbin doesn't know what to do with the
[41:51] word so they take their own willfulness
[41:53] and own desire
[41:54] and own selfishness and give back to god
[41:57] amen something that came from their own
[41:59] intellect
[42:01] i'm keeping the word i obey i did what
[42:04] the quote said i did what the pastor
[42:06] said
[42:06] but you can see it's all over there's a
[42:08] seductiveness
[42:10] there's a there's a blurring of the
[42:12] lines there's an unclear
[42:14] there's an unclear sound the trumpet's
[42:16] giving and a man who who will live his
[42:18] life
[42:18] on the edge with entertainment and
[42:20] worldliness and won't just kick out the
[42:22] trash but he'll say well brother ben
[42:24] said this and
[42:25] this and that you realize that that's
[42:27] somebody who hasn't yet
[42:29] got the cut down right who hasn't gone
[42:31] where they can take that word come
[42:33] in and bounce it around in my heart amen
[42:35] and bring it back out and brilliance
[42:37] and luster and fire and shine of
[42:40] obedience by
[42:42] revelation that was the difference
[42:45] between cain and abel
[42:46] amen cain he didn't understand amen and
[42:50] when god gave him the word
[42:52] god gave him the commandment god said
[42:54] just do like your brother will do and
[42:56] he'll be fine with you
[42:57] amen he began to despise the commandment
[43:00] because he had no revelation
[43:02] amen the light was hitting him
[43:05] but there was nothing in him to take the
[43:08] light
[43:08] in and to reflect the light back out
[43:12] he was hit by the light god gave him
[43:15] commandment
[43:16] god told him what to do and then he goes
[43:18] and talks to abel
[43:22] the bible doesn't record the
[43:23] conversation but i got a funny idea
[43:28] that abel just shared his revelation
[43:32] so now cain has the word of god
[43:35] he's got word with abel's revelation
[43:40] and he hates it and he kills abel
[43:46] why because he had nothing the word
[43:49] could hit him all day long
[43:52] but there was nothing in him he wasn't
[43:55] of the right material
[43:57] and he wasn't shaped in the right way to
[43:59] take that light of the word
[44:01] in and let it reflect here and reflect
[44:04] here and
[44:05] search out his own heart
[44:08] and come back out of the stone
[44:12] as fire and brilliance and light
[44:18] see the thing that people who are trying
[44:20] to serve god or lacking more than
[44:22] anything is revelation
[44:25] you see it i see it so many times and it
[44:27] breaks your heart because then
[44:29] when you when you start to see somebody
[44:31] going off to the side
[44:33] and getting off the word and they're
[44:35] walking that edge
[44:37] and you start to come down and and
[44:39] preach on that edge because we still
[44:41] have to
[44:42] amen and all of a sudden it set you can
[44:44] watch it
[44:45] it sets up a war of will
[44:50] it sets up a warfare of self-will and
[44:53] all of a sudden there's a
[44:54] there's a i want to be right amen the
[44:57] preacher's saying this and and the
[44:58] message says
[44:59] but it also says this and this person
[45:01] over here told me that brother brown
[45:02] said this
[45:04] and all of a sudden amen it becomes a
[45:06] war of self-will
[45:08] somebody who's trying to serve god who
[45:10] wants to be right
[45:11] who's hearing the word amen but they're
[45:13] struggling and there's a war that's
[45:15] taking place
[45:16] amen and you realize the whole issue is
[45:19] a lack of revelation
[45:21] we would just catch a revelation of why
[45:23] the prophet said that why the word says
[45:25] that
[45:25] amen it becomes a non-issue then all of
[45:28] a sudden you're like
[45:28] god cut me cut me cut that out of me oh
[45:32] god if that's the kind of worship you
[45:34] want i get it i understand
[45:36] i understand why you're asking me to do
[45:38] this and wear this and not wear that and
[45:40] not go these places
[45:41] i get it now because i'm supposed to be
[45:44] clear as crystal
[45:46] because i'm supposed to actually not be
[45:48] a church member but i'm supposed to be
[45:50] you
[45:50] in this earth i get it now
[45:54] amen i thought i was just supposed to go
[45:56] to church and conform to the church
[45:58] and be part of the church and if i
[46:00] conform to the rules of the church i was
[46:01] okay
[46:02] amen missed it wrong revelation
[46:05] it's not about the church that's why
[46:07] people will change churches to find a
[46:09] church that will allow them to do what
[46:11] self-will wants to do
[46:15] and i don't mean that in any mean way i
[46:17] don't mean that
[46:18] sarcastically at all but you can see
[46:20] that's what's happening they're
[46:21] uncomfortable under a certain thing
[46:23] and they'll find a place where they're
[46:24] more comfortable amen instead of just
[46:26] saying
[46:27] what does god give me a revelation of
[46:30] what you want in this
[46:31] hour i want to lay down my life not
[46:33] preserve it i want to give everything up
[46:35] and if that's what you want
[46:37] show me in your word what you want
[46:43] see it's about receiving the light
[46:48] but also about reflecting the light
[46:53] jerusalem new jerusalem was a city come
[46:56] down as a bride adorned for a husband
[46:59] like polish stone clear as crystal
[47:04] and the light from the throne shone out
[47:06] through the city and
[47:08] lighted the world
[47:11] but the only way that was possible is if
[47:14] each stone was clear as crystal
[47:19] see the light could come
[47:24] but if all you had was regular stone
[47:26] blocks
[47:29] the world doesn't get any light
[47:36] we're not here to be part of the church
[47:42] we're here to be as jewels
[47:46] to take the word it's amazing you can
[47:48] take the word sometimes in a simple
[47:50] thought
[47:52] and a simple thought something that you
[47:55] read in the scripture or a preacher will
[47:56] say or
[47:57] brother graham say a simple thought will
[47:59] come in and it will start reflecting
[48:01] bouncing back and forth inside
[48:04] and all of a sudden when it comes back
[48:06] out in your life that simple thought
[48:08] works over here and works here and works
[48:10] here and works here and now i start to
[48:11] show it in this
[48:12] red color and green color and this blue
[48:14] and
[48:16] why because by revelation it's not just
[48:19] this is the rule i do this rule but the
[48:21] revelation now comes this is a principle
[48:25] this is god's mind this
[48:28] is god's desire and if this is god's
[48:30] mind here
[48:31] what about here and if this is god's
[48:33] attitude here what about here and all of
[48:35] a sudden the light comes in
[48:36] and starts doing all this number inside
[48:39] and it comes out
[48:40] it comes out bright it comes out shining
[48:42] it's on fire
[48:45] because it's reflected back to the world
[48:51] see brother branham says here i want to
[48:53] read out of christ is the mystery of god
[48:55] revealed
[48:56] if i could just read a couple quotes
[48:57] that blessed me today
[48:59] it said all those things typed him
[49:02] he's talking about old testament types
[49:04] just in time
[49:05] but yet the mystery was hid then men
[49:08] didn't know what they were doing
[49:09] they only knew that they were led by the
[49:11] spirit to do something
[49:13] now holding it back in the last days for
[49:16] the great revelation
[49:18] all through the old testament those men
[49:19] were moved by the spirit of god david
[49:21] and noah and
[49:22] abraham and jeremiah not even fully
[49:24] realizing what they were moved by they
[49:26] just knew they were moved by the spirit
[49:27] because god was
[49:28] holding it back for the last days to be
[49:30] a great revelation
[49:34] i hope you don't think he's still
[49:35] holding it back
[49:39] but expressing it expressing himself in
[49:42] moses
[49:43] and david and joseph and elijah on down
[49:45] through
[49:46] you could take each one of those
[49:47] prophets and bring their lives out and
[49:49] show it expressed
[49:50] jesus christ perfectly exactly yet
[49:53] never giving a secret in full waiting
[49:56] waiting for to make it known in the last
[49:58] days as he promised
[50:00] waiting for it to be fully comprehended
[50:08] see god was holding it back
[50:12] so he could show it here and he showed
[50:15] it here
[50:16] and he let a little bit out and a little
[50:18] bit out and a little bit out
[50:21] and then jesus christ came and he was
[50:23] the full reflection of that whole word
[50:26] the whole testament and it was and it
[50:28] was let out a little here and a little
[50:30] here and a little
[50:30] but jesus christ comes on the scene and
[50:32] he's letting out the whole
[50:34] the whole mystery of the old testament
[50:36] was that god would come in flesh
[50:41] but that wasn't the end of the mystery
[50:44] then come forth the bride
[50:46] and and he's letting a little out
[50:49] through luther a little out
[50:50] through wesley a little out through
[50:52] pentecost but holding back
[50:54] the great mystery the great secret to
[50:56] the end time
[50:57] never letting his secret out in full
[51:00] amen
[51:00] but at the end of time amen he would let
[51:03] his full secret out
[51:04] when when it can be comprehended after
[51:07] it's been expressed here and expressed
[51:09] here and expressed here
[51:10] and every type in the bible was
[51:11] expressing it and every character was
[51:13] displaying it
[51:14] and through seven church ages amen
[51:16] they've been building it up amen but at
[51:17] the end of time
[51:18] when it's time now to be fully
[51:20] comprehended amen now he takes the seals
[51:24] and he peels the seals away and he
[51:26] reveals what's been the mystery all
[51:28] along
[51:28] the mystery all along is that god wants
[51:31] to be
[51:34] flesh
[51:36] god wants to be flesh and he was flesh
[51:39] and
[51:40] jesus christ and he's becoming flesh in
[51:42] his bride
[51:45] adam and eve amen pre-typed it they
[51:49] showed it in a time
[51:50] now the whole plan has to be to get the
[51:53] last adam jesus christ and his bride eve
[51:56] back to an eden condition again it's
[51:58] been the whole mystery all the way
[51:59] through but god waits till the end of
[52:01] the time
[52:01] and takes the seal off of his mystery
[52:03] and when he takes the seal off the
[52:04] mystery
[52:05] he brings down a revelation that is the
[52:08] capstone
[52:09] friends it is the light it is the full
[52:11] gospel it is the full word it is the
[52:13] full mystery unveiled
[52:14] and now that mystery is to shine down
[52:17] through the stones
[52:20] which stones this stone right here that
[52:24] mystery has to be displayed right here
[52:28] see when you take water baptism in jesus
[52:31] christ's name you're showing the mystery
[52:36] when when when we believe amen malachi 4
[52:39] we're showing the mystery
[52:41] i mean when we walk in obedience to this
[52:43] word we're showing the mystery when we
[52:44] denounce trinitarianism we're showing
[52:46] the mystery
[52:49] it's the word that has to be on display
[52:51] and in manifestation
[52:53] brother bram goes on to say he says the
[52:56] revelation it is christ's way of making
[52:58] himself known to his church
[53:01] how the revelation the revelation is how
[53:04] he makes himself known to his church
[53:07] this is so important because what does
[53:09] the message come for to bring us a
[53:10] revelation of jesus christ
[53:12] of the whole mystery christ this title
[53:15] is christ the mystery of god revealed
[53:18] the whole mystery of god is revealed in
[53:20] christ amen and now how does christ make
[53:22] himself known to his church
[53:23] by revelation
[53:30] he says because it's just gradually let
[53:33] loose
[53:34] as it did down through the prophets and
[53:36] till it was
[53:37] perfectly made known that godhead bodily
[53:39] in christ
[53:41] and now the christ in the church is just
[53:44] being made known
[53:46] brother branham now he's been peeling
[53:48] back the mystery and he's showing
[53:49] amen it was god bodily in christ that
[53:51] was the mystery in the old testament
[53:53] name that made known
[53:54] and now the christ in the church is just
[53:57] being made known
[53:58] the whole thing is the revelation of god
[54:01] to take eve back to her right position
[54:03] again with her husband
[54:04] and god is the husband of the church and
[54:06] the church is his bride
[54:10] he says but when christ takes you over
[54:12] he'll express
[54:13] that word right through you
[54:18] he'll express his word right through you
[54:22] when your sister refused to cut your
[54:24] hair anymore it's christ reflecting his
[54:26] word through you
[54:27] not the rule not the law but the
[54:29] revelation of what hair represents
[54:32] and by revelation when the light comes
[54:34] and bounces around and reflects
[54:36] back amen now it's not a struggle not to
[54:38] cut my hair
[54:39] it's a privilege not to cut my hair
[54:41] because i understand
[54:43] why god has given me the revelation
[54:47] it's a privilege for me to act like a
[54:48] gentleman it's a privilege for me to act
[54:50] like a lady
[54:51] amen not by the rule but by the
[54:53] revelation
[54:54] amen and the revelation is the way he
[54:56] makes himself known to his church
[54:58] and when christ takes you over he'll
[54:59] express that word right through you
[55:02] because it's him he is the word and then
[55:04] you can see the expression
[55:06] of christ then you can see
[55:10] the expression of christ i'm going to
[55:12] read two more places
[55:15] his church is himself
[55:19] revealed
[55:27] philip could look at jesus and say show
[55:30] us the father
[55:32] but jesus was the father revealed
[55:35] or expressed
[55:39] and the glory of god was jesus christ
[55:42] and the glory of jesus christ
[55:43] is his bride his church
[55:46] is himself revealed
[55:50] that's why if we can't see him in bride
[55:53] form we're missing him
[55:57] but if we say we have him in bright form
[56:03] but the form that we see him in is not a
[56:06] cut stone
[56:10] you realize
[56:13] if it's not the right stone if it's not
[56:15] the right gem
[56:18] it doesn't give the right reflection
[56:22] not everything that's self-labeled bride
[56:24] is bride
[56:28] but god knows who his bride is god knows
[56:31] where his gems are
[56:33] and god knows how to get him in the
[56:34] right shape and god knows how to pour
[56:37] light into them so that what he gets
[56:41] back is brilliant light a reflection of
[56:44] the light
[56:46] and so it becomes her light what is her
[56:49] light
[56:50] her light is his light reflected through
[56:53] her
[56:54] that's her light what is her light
[56:57] her light is the word that we receive by
[57:00] revelation
[57:02] put into flesh and acted out in this
[57:04] world is
[57:05] her light
[57:09] his church is himself revealed
[57:15] but the revelation came through the
[57:17] blood through jesus christ was the blood
[57:19] of god creative blood in the womb of
[57:21] mary
[57:21] and paul knew him by revelation that's
[57:24] how we know him today
[57:26] is the only way you could know him not
[57:29] say i'm methodist
[57:30] that means nothing i'm baptist that
[57:32] means nothing i'm catholic that means
[57:34] nothing
[57:34] but by the revelation that god has
[57:36] revealed the word to you
[57:38] he is the word and the word how listen
[57:41] close how you know it's revealed
[57:48] i'm going to read it real slow
[57:52] not by a label you give yourself
[57:56] not by i'm methodist i'm baptist i'm a
[57:59] message believer i'm bride
[58:01] those are just words it may be so it may
[58:05] not be so
[58:06] it's not the words
[58:09] that means nothing i'm catholic a
[58:11] methodist
[58:12] that means nothing but by the revelation
[58:14] that god has revealed the word to you
[58:19] he is the word how you know it's
[58:22] revealed
[58:24] it lives itself and expresses itself
[58:27] through you
[58:31] how did you know it was revealed to abel
[58:36] because of what abel did with the word
[58:39] it's simple it's simple
[58:43] how do you know that it wasn't in cain
[58:46] because what cain did with the word
[58:52] god made it simple and now there's no
[58:55] explaining this away there's no ability
[58:58] to say
[58:59] but brother chad if you knew my past and
[59:01] if you knew the abuse of this and if you
[59:03] knew
[59:03] this no it's not you it's him in you
[59:08] it's not you so you can't be the excuse
[59:11] you can't say well i had a hard life and
[59:13] my dad was authoritarian
[59:15] and it's made me this way and i've got
[59:16] this complex you realize you've missed
[59:19] it amen you've got to be
[59:20] a a jasper stone a polish stone say god
[59:24] amen there's some things that are making
[59:25] it hard for me to reflect this word
[59:27] i'm laying back on your wheel would you
[59:29] just grind some more away
[59:31] because it's got to be you reflecting
[59:33] through me because i
[59:34] can't do it
[59:37] remember we receive how do you know it's
[59:39] a revelation how do you know it's
[59:41] revealed to you
[59:41] amen how you know it's revealed it lives
[59:45] itself and expresses itself
[59:47] through you it's not a life you live
[59:50] it's a life he comes in
[59:51] and lives through you
[59:55] it comes back down
[59:58] it comes back down
[1:00:02] to what the word that comes in
[1:00:06] it really comes down to how the word
[1:00:07] reflected back out
[1:00:12] you can have two people sitting here the
[1:00:13] same message
[1:00:15] and they'll walk away with two
[1:00:16] conclusions
[1:00:18] oh that man is just brother that man's
[1:00:20] just picking on women
[1:00:22] [Music]
[1:00:23] he's just a woman hater that was one
[1:00:25] conclusion
[1:00:26] then you have somebody else and says god
[1:00:28] was speaking to me and showing me a
[1:00:30] beautiful position i have in his word
[1:00:34] same message same preacher preaching the
[1:00:37] same thing
[1:00:38] that light hits one person amen it's
[1:00:40] carbon amen
[1:00:42] or it may be a gym that's not finished
[1:00:44] being polished yet
[1:00:45] amen but it hits another person and that
[1:00:47] other person hears something totally
[1:00:49] different
[1:00:49] because they catch more than words that
[1:00:51] are being spoken but they catch the
[1:00:53] revelation
[1:00:54] amen of what god is saying
[1:00:58] somebody will walk away and say he was
[1:01:00] you know that
[1:01:01] that preacher he's always picking on
[1:01:03] this and he's always picking on that or
[1:01:04] you could say
[1:01:05] that was jesus christ trying to show me
[1:01:07] that i'm not
[1:01:08] of this world and these world's
[1:01:10] attractions shouldn't attract me
[1:01:12] amen i should be attracted to the word
[1:01:17] and it just depends on what material is
[1:01:20] there
[1:01:21] and how long it's been in the master
[1:01:23] jim's craftsman's hand
[1:01:25] to shape it back and when the word comes
[1:01:27] in amen
[1:01:28] it bounces around and it reflects back
[1:01:30] in the brilliance of a revelation
[1:01:32] in the beauty of a revelation amen
[1:01:35] that's obedience that's a pleasure
[1:01:37] that's obedience that's a pleasure to
[1:01:39] watch
[1:01:40] that's obedience that blesses everybody
[1:01:42] else amen
[1:01:43] you can see i mean you can see what's
[1:01:46] going on in somebody's heart sometimes
[1:01:50] let's go to matthew chapter 5. we'll
[1:01:52] just read a couple more scriptures
[1:02:05] matthew chapter 5
[1:02:09] verse 14. jesus speaking the disciples
[1:02:13] says ye are
[1:02:14] the light of the world we already read
[1:02:17] the scripture says god is the light
[1:02:20] jesus already said he's the light now
[1:02:23] jesus is looking at his disciples saying
[1:02:25] you're the light you're the light of the
[1:02:29] world
[1:02:30] a city i wonder what city he's talking
[1:02:33] about
[1:02:36] a city that is set on a hill cannot be
[1:02:39] hid
[1:02:40] neither do men light a can don't put it
[1:02:42] under a bushel
[1:02:44] but on a candlestick and giveth light
[1:02:47] unto all
[1:02:48] that are in the house let your light so
[1:02:50] shine before men that they may see your
[1:02:52] good works
[1:02:53] and glorify your father which is in
[1:03:00] heaven
[1:03:02] let's go to galatians chapter one i want
[1:03:04] to catch just a couple scriptures
[1:03:06] and then we'll wrap up
[1:03:11] galatians chapter one
[1:03:17] verse 15.
[1:03:20] paul the apostle speaking that says but
[1:03:22] when it pleased god
[1:03:24] who separated me from my mother's womb
[1:03:25] and called me by his grace
[1:03:28] what did he do he found a gem in the
[1:03:31] earth and he pulled it out
[1:03:34] to reveal his son and me
[1:03:38] to reveal his son and me
[1:03:43] he separated him from his mother's womb
[1:03:45] and called him by grace he pulled him
[1:03:47] out of the earth by grace
[1:03:49] to do what to reveal his son not to him
[1:03:53] but in him what did he pull you out of
[1:03:57] the earth for
[1:03:58] to do the same thing why did he separate
[1:04:00] you from your mother's womb why did he
[1:04:01] call you by his grace
[1:04:03] to reveal his son in you not to you but
[1:04:06] in you
[1:04:10] to reveal the son in me that i might
[1:04:12] preach him among the heathen
[1:04:14] immediately i conferred not with flesh
[1:04:16] and blood neither went i up to jerusalem
[1:04:17] but then
[1:04:18] but they were two apostles before me but
[1:04:20] i went into arabia and returned again to
[1:04:22] damascus
[1:04:23] what did he do when he got separated
[1:04:25] from his mother's womb when he was
[1:04:26] plucked out of the earth when he was
[1:04:27] taken into the hand
[1:04:28] he didn't go get ideas from men
[1:04:32] amen but he went to the hand of the
[1:04:34] master craftsmen
[1:04:35] who took him into the wilderness in
[1:04:36] arabia and began to cut the stone
[1:04:39] because what did he want to do he wanted
[1:04:41] to cut away all the
[1:04:43] extra stuff that was built up around the
[1:04:45] apostle paul
[1:04:46] to cut him down to his full potential so
[1:04:48] that god could pour the light in paul
[1:04:51] and what would he get out of paul he
[1:04:52] would get brilliance and luster and
[1:04:54] flashes of light
[1:04:57] because paul he told paul
[1:05:00] in acts 13 said i have set thee to be a
[1:05:04] light
[1:05:04] to the gentiles i have set thee
[1:05:08] to be a light to the gentiles that thou
[1:05:10] should be for salvation to the ends of
[1:05:12] the earth
[1:05:12] how was paul light paul was light
[1:05:15] because he was reflecting the light of
[1:05:16] jesus christ
[1:05:22] we know that light comes
[1:05:26] by revelation even the scripture speaks
[1:05:29] it this way ii corinthians
[1:05:36] not done with our bible study we'll add
[1:05:38] a couple more verses here you can go
[1:05:39] over when you get home
[1:05:41] or tomorrow second corinthians 4
[1:05:45] and 6.
[1:05:49] for god who commanded the light to shine
[1:05:51] out of darkness has shined
[1:05:53] in our hearts to give the light
[1:05:56] of the knowledge of the glory of god in
[1:05:59] the face of jesus christ
[1:06:02] what is that light revelation
[1:06:05] the light of the knowledge amen in the
[1:06:08] face of jesus christ
[1:06:09] let's go to ephesians chapter 1.
[1:06:16] ephesians chapter 1 and verse 17.
[1:06:22] that the god of our lord jesus christ
[1:06:24] the father of glory may give unto you
[1:06:25] the spirit of wisdom
[1:06:27] and revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:06:29] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:06:31] enlightened
[1:06:32] that you might know what is the hope of
[1:06:34] his calling and what is the riches of
[1:06:36] the glory
[1:06:37] of his inheritance in the saints so he's
[1:06:40] even telling us
[1:06:41] that your eyes being open is what is a
[1:06:44] revelation his knowledge is
[1:06:46] understanding is the opening of the eyes
[1:06:48] to letting the light in
[1:06:49] so now let's turn to matthew 6 and read
[1:06:51] matthew 6.
[1:06:58] matthew chapter 6.
[1:07:07] verse 22 the light of the body
[1:07:12] is the eye now
[1:07:15] when we read this i don't want you to go
[1:07:17] to a wrong understanding
[1:07:21] many times this scripture can be taken
[1:07:22] and say be careful what you look at
[1:07:24] because
[1:07:25] what you see the light of the body but
[1:07:27] this eye
[1:07:28] in the bible represents understanding or
[1:07:31] knowledge or revelation or illumination
[1:07:34] so read it that way the light of the
[1:07:36] body
[1:07:38] is the revelation or understanding
[1:07:42] is the eye the eyes the eyes of your
[1:07:44] heart being enlightened your eyes being
[1:07:46] open
[1:07:47] eye salve being rubbed in the eyes you
[1:07:48] read this all through scripture
[1:07:50] i've given you i said that you might see
[1:07:52] what is that eyes have to see to see the
[1:07:54] revelation of the word
[1:07:55] what is your eye enlightened by by the
[1:07:57] knowledge of jesus christ so the i
[1:07:59] is revelation and understanding the
[1:08:02] light of the body
[1:08:03] is the eye if therefore thine eye be
[1:08:06] single
[1:08:06] that word means focused
[1:08:11] if the eye be focused
[1:08:14] the whole body shall be full of light
[1:08:18] but if thine eye be evil the whole body
[1:08:20] shall be full of darkness
[1:08:23] if therefore thy light that is in thee
[1:08:24] be darkness how great
[1:08:26] is that darkness god has come in this
[1:08:30] day to give us the isab to open our eyes
[1:08:34] so that the the light
[1:08:37] can come through the understanding and
[1:08:39] fill our hearts
[1:08:41] and through the revelation we can
[1:08:43] receive the light amen and that
[1:08:45] light can be reflected out by revelation
[1:08:48] that's why the messages come in this
[1:08:50] hour amen without the revelation there's
[1:08:52] darkness if you look back
[1:08:54] in luther's life luther couldn't live
[1:08:56] the life we're called to live because of
[1:08:57] the revelation luther had
[1:08:59] luther's revelation was limited and in
[1:09:01] limited revelation there was limited
[1:09:03] life
[1:09:04] wesley's revelation was limited limited
[1:09:06] revelation limited
[1:09:07] life amen the reflection couldn't be
[1:09:09] full until the full light came
[1:09:12] but now the full light has come to take
[1:09:15] the scales off of our eyes
[1:09:17] to give us the revelation of the whole
[1:09:18] mystery so that we can be
[1:09:20] focused in our body full of light
[1:09:23] and when we get full of light then the
[1:09:25] light reflects back in a full
[1:09:27] manifestation of jesus christ
[1:09:29] that's why the messages come that's why
[1:09:31] we read our message books over and over
[1:09:33] and over again
[1:09:34] amen because it's not us it's him and us
[1:09:37] amen it's not
[1:09:37] it's not what we've done but we've got
[1:09:39] to focus our eyes
[1:09:41] single our vision focus our eyes that
[1:09:43] have been opened down to the word
[1:09:44] and the word only and fill our hearts
[1:09:47] full of the word
[1:09:49] and then reflect back the same
[1:09:54] brother brahm says in questions and
[1:09:55] answers in 1964
[1:09:59] he said on top of mount zion we'll set
[1:10:00] the lamb
[1:10:02] and the city will need no light for the
[1:10:04] lamb is the light thereof
[1:10:06] and above the lamb will be the father
[1:10:08] which is the logos god the great light
[1:10:10] the eternal light that shines just above
[1:10:12] the throne
[1:10:13] and jesus will not be on his father's
[1:10:14] stone he will be on his throne
[1:10:16] and the father will hover over the sun
[1:10:18] which the father and son will be one
[1:10:22] and then god became material in a man
[1:10:25] called jesus christ which was a son
[1:10:29] this son gave his life that he might
[1:10:31] bring other sons
[1:10:33] that god might become tangible
[1:10:38] the purpose was so that god could become
[1:10:40] tangible
[1:10:42] how could god become tangible god can
[1:10:45] become
[1:10:45] tangible in you and i
[1:10:50] so that the reflection of our lives is
[1:10:52] god
[1:10:54] the way we have conversations at work
[1:10:58] is god the way we work is god
[1:11:02] the way we live our life is god the way
[1:11:04] we dress
[1:11:05] the way we act the way we worship the
[1:11:07] the way we raise our families the way a
[1:11:09] husband and wife conducts themselves
[1:11:10] with each other what is it
[1:11:12] it's god becoming tangible to the world
[1:11:15] so that they can see the light
[1:11:16] reflecting back out of the city
[1:11:19] and this light is the light in the whole
[1:11:21] earth amen we're here to shine forth
[1:11:23] this light
[1:11:24] after we've been clear as crystal clean
[1:11:26] by the blood of jesus christ
[1:11:28] polished by the hand of the lord shining
[1:11:30] forth the light from the caption that we
[1:11:32] received
[1:11:32] it's got to be a life not a concept not
[1:11:35] a conversation
[1:11:37] not a wednesday and sunday club it's got
[1:11:39] to be a
[1:11:40] life it's got to be a life in the
[1:11:43] simplicity
[1:11:45] and the simplicity of not cheating on a
[1:11:49] time card at work
[1:11:51] i mean simplicity of not cheating at
[1:11:55] school
[1:11:55] not lying to mom and dad i mean and the
[1:11:57] simplicity
[1:11:58] of a husband and wife living in harmony
[1:12:00] and showing each other mutual respect
[1:12:02] and honor
[1:12:05] you see we can say what we want to say
[1:12:10] we can say we believe all of the word
[1:12:14] but when abel believed the word you
[1:12:17] could see it
[1:12:21] when jesus christ received the word the
[1:12:23] revelation of what god wanted in that
[1:12:24] day
[1:12:25] you could see it when paul received the
[1:12:28] word
[1:12:29] you could see it it reflected back the
[1:12:33] word
[1:12:35] when we receive the word and we reflect
[1:12:38] back
[1:12:39] hatefulness and strife arrogance
[1:12:43] anger and strife families at odd
[1:12:47] wrong reflection i say god
[1:12:52] cut me polish me
[1:12:55] polish me again lord i've received your
[1:12:58] light
[1:12:59] now let the light come out let me single
[1:13:02] my eye of revelation down on your word
[1:13:07] isaiah 60 verse 1 says arise
[1:13:10] shine for thy light for thy light has
[1:13:13] come
[1:13:14] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[1:13:16] thee
[1:13:17] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[1:13:18] earth and gross darkness the people but
[1:13:20] the lord shall arise upon thee
[1:13:22] and his glory shall be seen upon thee
[1:13:25] and the
[1:13:25] gentiles shall come to thy light and
[1:13:27] kings to the brightness of thy rising
[1:13:32] in the message future home brother
[1:13:33] behind says the city with the throne
[1:13:36] in top and they need no light for the
[1:13:39] lamb and the lord god is the light
[1:13:41] thereof see
[1:13:42] the lord god is the pillar of fire that
[1:13:44] followed the children of israel through
[1:13:45] the wilderness and he ascended up on the
[1:13:47] throne
[1:13:48] in the perfect kingdoms the kingdom that
[1:13:51] jesus is to surrender to the father that
[1:13:52] god might be all
[1:13:54] and in all jesus sets upon his throne
[1:13:56] here
[1:13:57] as our joseph and the king is that light
[1:14:00] that will be on the top of mount zion
[1:14:02] and his holy light
[1:14:04] will flood the entire city
[1:14:09] when is that supposed to happen friends
[1:14:12] when is that supposed to happen that's
[1:14:15] supposed to happen
[1:14:16] right now don't kick it off
[1:14:20] right now say lord
[1:14:24] revelations 21 i see myself there
[1:14:30] i'm one of those living stones you
[1:14:33] separated me from my mother's womb you
[1:14:35] call me by your grace
[1:14:36] amen and you took me out in the
[1:14:38] wilderness
[1:14:40] away from everything i ever knew and you
[1:14:42] shaped me by this word
[1:14:44] and you've placed me into a body and now
[1:14:46] my job is to let the headstone
[1:14:48] revelation
[1:14:50] where is the throne at the top where is
[1:14:53] the capstone at the top
[1:14:54] what shape is that cloud in capstone
[1:14:57] what is it then when you turn it to the
[1:14:58] side
[1:14:59] head face head of christ what is it it's
[1:15:01] the same thing
[1:15:02] it's the full revelation of the word of
[1:15:05] the whole bible that has come
[1:15:07] down upon the church and now that whole
[1:15:09] word is to shine down and
[1:15:11] fill the city which is the bride and
[1:15:14] shine
[1:15:15] out of the city into the earth
[1:15:20] see there's been a connection made
[1:15:26] and now the light's got to shine out
[1:15:30] we can point to the capstone
[1:15:33] we can point to the prophet who pointed
[1:15:35] to the capstone
[1:15:37] the forerunner the coming of the lord
[1:15:39] the word the
[1:15:40] opening of the seals the third pool
[1:15:44] but if it never comes down to abel
[1:15:48] making the right sacrifice what does it
[1:15:50] matter anyways
[1:15:53] you understand we can see we can say
[1:15:57] we can repeat phrases we can speak words
[1:15:59] we can
[1:16:00] we can pair it like coming in i mean it
[1:16:02] comes in it can come back out
[1:16:04] amen but if it never manifests the life
[1:16:07] of jesus christ
[1:16:09] if this word isn't taken up and
[1:16:12] collected
[1:16:13] and put inside of our heart and come
[1:16:15] back out as honesty when we drive
[1:16:17] honesty with our spouses uh harmony in
[1:16:20] our families
[1:16:21] love amongst the brethren if it doesn't
[1:16:25] come
[1:16:26] out the life of the word then we need to
[1:16:29] go back to the polishing wheel and get
[1:16:30] polished some more
[1:16:36] cain cain ended up getting the same word
[1:16:40] able god
[1:16:42] but he couldn't reflect it back abel got
[1:16:45] the
[1:16:46] revelation in simplicity and in
[1:16:48] simplicity he could reflect it back
[1:16:52] i said god don't let me over complicate
[1:16:54] your word and your purpose
[1:16:57] what is your purpose that i would
[1:17:00] reflect you
[1:17:03] in the grocery store at the gas station
[1:17:08] at a family gathering at work
[1:17:12] with strangers with friends that i
[1:17:15] would reflect you that i
[1:17:18] would be this city said on the hill that
[1:17:22] men would see my good works and glorify
[1:17:24] my father which is in heaven
[1:17:25] that's the whole purpose made it too
[1:17:29] complicated sometimes
[1:17:31] when it should be easy
[1:17:34] too much too much self
[1:17:38] too much cloudiness in the in the jasper
[1:17:41] stone
[1:17:43] oh but praise god he knows how to get it
[1:17:46] out
[1:17:47] he knows how to polish it trials
[1:17:50] tribulations
[1:17:51] difficulties distresses are all god
[1:17:54] smoothing the stone making it perfect to
[1:17:58] display him
[1:18:00] let's all stand musicians if you kill
[1:18:02] him
[1:18:06] when i read revelation 21 i see
[1:18:09] something that has to take place on the
[1:18:11] earth
[1:18:12] i see something that is taking place on
[1:18:14] the earth and i see myself as part of it
[1:18:17] and i say i may not i may not be happy
[1:18:19] with my performance
[1:18:21] but it's not my performance that matters
[1:18:24] it's his performance
[1:18:26] and i said god take your word
[1:18:30] take your word shine it in my heart
[1:18:33] and reflect it back out so that my life
[1:18:37] is not like cain's life but my life
[1:18:41] is like abel's man let's sing
[1:18:44] if we have a song oh i know
[1:18:47] the time is near where everything
[1:18:52] that i hold dear lay before the holy
[1:18:57] consuming fire
[1:19:01] all my works and all my deeds
[1:19:05] every prayer set on my knees we'll lay
[1:19:09] before
[1:19:10] the holy consuming
[1:19:14] fire all i
[1:19:17] want to see is jesus
[1:19:24] all i want to see is him in me
[1:19:31] all i want to see is jesus
[1:19:37] [Music]
[1:19:40] shining through me
[1:19:45] hurt in self-inflicted pain
[1:19:52] [Applause]
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:20:00] words of knowledge in his name
[1:20:03] and healing hands to touch the lame
[1:20:07] lay before the holy
[1:20:10] consuming fire
[1:20:13] but all i want to see
[1:20:18] jesus
[1:20:22] all i want to see is him
[1:20:26] in me
[1:20:29] all i want to see is
[1:20:32] jesus
[1:20:37] shining through me
[1:20:42] and hear him say
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:58] one
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:12] all i want to see is
[1:21:17] jesus
[1:21:19] all i want to see is him in
[1:21:24] me all i want to see
[1:21:28] is jesus
[1:21:34] shining through
[1:21:36] me praise the lord
[1:21:41] when you look at that beautiful diamond
[1:21:44] that's a sparkle fire colors as you move
[1:21:47] it
[1:21:48] it's amazing
[1:21:51] but if you ask the diamond what did you
[1:21:53] do
[1:21:54] to be so beautiful the diamond would
[1:21:57] have to confess and say i didn't do
[1:21:59] anything
[1:22:01] i didn't do anything i didn't put myself
[1:22:03] here
[1:22:04] i didn't make myself a diamond i didn't
[1:22:06] shake myself
[1:22:08] and i wasn't the origin of the light the
[1:22:10] light shined in me
[1:22:12] and if we could see ourselves that way i
[1:22:14] didn't put myself in this earth i didn't
[1:22:16] make myself bride
[1:22:17] i didn't decide to be a child of god god
[1:22:20] before the foundation the world made
[1:22:22] that choice
[1:22:22] i didn't save myself i didn't pluck
[1:22:24] myself up i didn't choose myself
[1:22:26] he did and then he amen through through
[1:22:29] the abrasive nature of life
[1:22:31] has taken and polished and polished and
[1:22:34] polished and polished
[1:22:35] and if you see a reflection if you see
[1:22:37] anything beautiful in my life
[1:22:39] i can take zero credit for it
[1:22:42] it wasn't what i did amen it's what he
[1:22:45] did
[1:22:45] it wasn't what i'm capable of amen i was
[1:22:48] just laying there in the dirt i was
[1:22:50] laying there
[1:22:51] in the rocks amen but he chose me
[1:22:54] he pulled me out he shaped me he shined
[1:22:57] the light inside of me
[1:22:59] i could be stuck in darkness somewhere i
[1:23:01] could be laying in the mind
[1:23:03] of denomination somewhere but god has
[1:23:06] done this work
[1:23:07] and if you see anything anything in my
[1:23:09] life that's beautiful
[1:23:10] anything that's attractive in the nature
[1:23:12] of christ it's nothing i did it's what
[1:23:15] he did
[1:23:20] that's the way i want to live my life
[1:23:23] i want to live my life in such a way
[1:23:26] that when people come in contact
[1:23:28] and then they recognize there's
[1:23:29] something different there it's shining
[1:23:31] it's sparkling
[1:23:32] it's glowing but i have the humility to
[1:23:34] understand
[1:23:35] that if there's something beautiful
[1:23:37] taking place in my life it has nothing
[1:23:39] to do with what i've done
[1:23:41] it has everything to do with what he's
[1:23:42] done with me
[1:23:46] paul couldn't take credit moses couldn't
[1:23:49] take
[1:23:50] credit nobody could take credit brother
[1:23:52] branham refused to take credit
[1:23:55] why because it's the revelation it's the
[1:23:56] reality a real revelation will not allow
[1:23:59] us to get puffed up
[1:24:00] amen to become vain and become
[1:24:02] egotistical
[1:24:04] with a proper revelation you can't go
[1:24:06] there
[1:24:08] because you realize if i had my own way
[1:24:10] i'd have destroyed my life
[1:24:13] but i didn't have my own way god had his
[1:24:15] own way
[1:24:17] and he wants to take our lives and he
[1:24:20] wants to make it a beautiful reflection
[1:24:22] of his word
[1:24:23] so that my every thought my every action
[1:24:26] my every word becomes
[1:24:27] jesus christ jesus christ jesus that's
[1:24:30] the goal friends that's what he wants to
[1:24:32] do
[1:24:32] and i'm just happy with the process
[1:24:35] you find yourself back in arabia again
[1:24:37] sometimes we find ourselves back in
[1:24:39] arabia
[1:24:40] just rest and relax because the master
[1:24:42] jim allah just
[1:24:43] has you in his hand and he's just
[1:24:45] putting another cut on to get a little
[1:24:47] more luster out
[1:24:50] putting you back down and getting a
[1:24:52] little more and next time we find
[1:24:53] ourselves in trials and
[1:24:55] conflicts and stresses it's time to just
[1:24:57] relax into his hand and say god
[1:24:59] you want to get something beautiful out
[1:25:01] of this life i'm yielding to you lord
[1:25:03] have your way
[1:25:05] make me what you want me to be your god
[1:25:09] let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:25:13] lord jesus while we just preach a simple
[1:25:17] thought lord
[1:25:19] take your scriptures and see what you
[1:25:22] want to do is flood us with a light and
[1:25:26] you've done that through the message
[1:25:27] lord
[1:25:28] you've given us your word
[1:25:32] god we just asked that you would just
[1:25:34] move
[1:25:35] out all the impurities that you would
[1:25:38] cut away lord everything that's not like
[1:25:40] you
[1:25:41] that you would shape us into the gems
[1:25:43] that you want for your crown
[1:25:45] that you would make us lord that city
[1:25:48] set on a hill
[1:25:50] that jasper stone that's been polished
[1:25:53] to perfection
[1:25:55] polished by your word polished by
[1:25:57] conflict
[1:25:58] polished by troubles and tribulations
[1:26:00] polished
[1:26:01] by a life in this world that would
[1:26:03] polish us
[1:26:04] to an image you had of us before the
[1:26:06] foundation of the world
[1:26:09] god you're not losing us you're not
[1:26:12] abusing
[1:26:12] us but you're shaping us into that image
[1:26:15] you had of us before the foundation of
[1:26:17] the world
[1:26:20] god i want to know that i've got the
[1:26:21] right revelation
[1:26:23] and you told us how will i know i've got
[1:26:25] the right revelation
[1:26:27] when it begins to live its life through
[1:26:29] me
[1:26:29] [Music]
[1:26:30] by the reflection lord we love you we
[1:26:34] ask that you would take us and mold us
[1:26:35] into your very image
[1:26:37] use us for your glory cleanse our hearts
[1:26:41] purify us
[1:26:42] and make us shine forth a true
[1:26:44] reflection of your life in this day
[1:26:47] in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:26:50] amen god bless you saints we love you
