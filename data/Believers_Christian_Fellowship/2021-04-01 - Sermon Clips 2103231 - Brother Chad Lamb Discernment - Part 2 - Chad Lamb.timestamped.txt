[0:02] under man he got that in christ jesus
[0:05] second was preeminence in a body of
[0:07] believers a bride he's doing that
[0:10] now how he wants prisoners
[0:14] he wants people totally surrendered
[0:17] to him no will of their own no
[0:20] thought of their own no selfishness no
[0:22] other desire
[0:23] only desiring him he wants what he wants
[0:27] is he wants the right kind of bride he's
[0:29] never had the right kind of bride
[0:32] god wanted the right kind of son and he
[0:34] never had the right kind of son until
[0:35] jesus christ came along
[0:37] and now that son has to have the right
[0:38] kind of bride and that's what he's
[0:40] looking for in this day
[0:41] and that's going to be his achievement
[0:43] because he has already purposed that he
[0:45] will have upon the earth the right kind
[0:47] of bride
[0:49] and that right kind of bride will be a
[0:51] reflection of the character of christ
[0:53] because christ was in total surrender to
[0:55] the will of the father
[0:56] now the bride will be total surrender to
[0:58] her headship christ
[1:05] what are you supposed to be doing on
[1:06] this earth
[1:08] that period
[1:14] that is we judge everything on god's
[1:16] great goal and god's purpose in our life
[1:18] we bring everything back amen when we
[1:20] lose
[1:21] focus of what god's purpose is in our
[1:23] life and what god's trying to achieve in
[1:24] this hour
[1:25] we can get caught up in all kinds of
[1:27] nonsense and confusion
[1:29] but we need to step back for a minute
[1:31] and say what is the
[1:32] whole plan of god what is god trying to
[1:34] do in this hour what is the seventh seal
[1:36] what does it have to do with me
[1:38] and what am i supposed to do when i wake
[1:40] up tomorrow morning
[1:42] and i say for god in order to god to
[1:45] fulfill his purpose
[1:46] that he had in the back part of his mind
[1:48] before the foundation of the world
[1:50] what he wrote the whole bible for and
[1:51] what he typed every character in the
[1:53] bible did
[1:54] for him to have that in your life
[1:55] tomorrow morning will be for you to wake
[1:57] up in the morning and say god this is
[1:59] your day not mine
[2:00] this is your life not mine i die fresh
[2:02] again i lay myself on the altar i don't
[2:05] want my way i don't want
[2:06] my desire i want only yours let your
[2:08] word and your word
[2:09] only rule in my life and then we will be
[2:12] starting the day
[2:13] in the seventh seal we will be starting
[2:16] our day
[2:17] in the bible we'll be starting our day
