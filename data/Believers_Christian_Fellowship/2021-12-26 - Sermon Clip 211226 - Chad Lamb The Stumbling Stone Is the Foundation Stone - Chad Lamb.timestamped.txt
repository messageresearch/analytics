[0:00] and the message the identification of
[0:02] christ in all ages the prophet of god
[0:03] says you've told the truth you've had
[0:05] five and the one you're living with now
[0:07] is not yours he's out of john 4 the
[0:09] samaritan woman at the well
[0:11] look at that little woman see she had
[0:12] fallen from god's thoughts
[0:15] did that little woman come from
[0:18] did she come from parents in samaria i
[0:21] mean she was called a samaritan but
[0:22] that's only this dimensional amen that's
[0:25] only a title that works for this
[0:27] dimension where did she come from she
[0:29] didn't come from samaria she didn't come
[0:31] from a mother and father who were
[0:32] samaritan she didn't come from sakkar or
[0:35] whatever city she was in she had fallen
[0:37] from the thoughts of god
[0:40] there was something down inside of her
[0:43] amen that was in god was in the thoughts
[0:45] of god and then fallen she had fallen
[0:47] from the thoughts of god and landed amen
[0:50] as a little baby given to two little
[0:52] parents in samaria and she had the label
[0:54] of being sumerian but she wasn't a
[0:56] sumerian she was a daughter of god
[1:00] that's why we're not americans
[1:03] we're not americans we're not germans
[1:05] we're not africans we're not whatever
[1:07] nationality that you might be that's not
[1:09] who you are amen if you're a child of
[1:11] god you've fallen here from the thoughts
[1:13] of god
[1:15] amen and god is bringing his word to try
[1:17] to collect back all of his thoughts amen
[1:20] and with what for millions of people has
[1:22] been a stumbling stone called the
[1:23] message of the hour a prophetic gift
[1:25] that's been on the earth through a man
[1:26] named william branham who brought us
[1:28] back in contact with a living jesus
[1:30] christ for many it's a stumbling stone
[1:33] for you it's a sure foundation it's a
[1:35] precious stone amen it's a rock that you
[1:37] can base your whole life upon
[1:40] its foundation goes clear back to the
[1:43] mind of god where you tumbled from is
[1:45] where this rock came from
[1:47] and where this rock is rooted to amen
[1:49] for some they've stumbled over the
[1:51] message and stumbled over the prophet
[1:53] and stumbled over the signs
[1:56] but for those who have fallen from the
[1:58] thoughts of god amen he sent that very
[2:01] word to expose the thoughts of many's
[2:03] hearts
[2:05] oh sometimes it's not a bad thing to
[2:08] have the thought of your heart exposed
[2:10] sometimes it's even exposing it to you
[2:12] god is bringing this word to peel away
[2:14] layers that don't belong to you layers
[2:16] of hybridization layers of
[2:18] denominational thinking he's bringing
[2:20] the word what's he trying to do he's
[2:22] trying to expose what's in your heart so
[2:25] you can see what's in you
[2:28] we've lived so long in the intellectual
[2:31] realm being taught and being trained and
[2:33] coming through life and having
[2:35] circumstances and experiences and bible
[2:37] training but he sent a powerful word in
[2:40] this day to penetrate past the mind to
[2:42] get down into the heart amen so that he
[2:45] can see there's something there that
[2:47] fell from the thoughts of god
