[11:57] [Music]
[12:06] let's pray together
[12:09] precious lord jesus we just want to
[12:12] come by you
[12:14] by way of prayer lord
[12:17] once again as we would come to this
[12:18] juncture of the service father to where
[12:20] we would
[12:22] make that step lord from the things that
[12:25] we can do to the things that we cannot
[12:28] do father
[12:29] for we've by your grace and your mercy
[12:32] you've given us strength to
[12:33] get out of bed and get in our vehicles
[12:36] and assemble ourselves here together
[12:38] lord and we've came and we've sang the
[12:41] songs of zion and we have worshiped you
[12:43] by praises father but
[12:46] now we come to the point to where the
[12:47] bread must be broken lord
[12:50] and we know lord that there is not a man
[12:52] capable to do this
[12:54] lord even though we would want to or
[12:57] would try to and do all that we could
[12:59] father
[13:00] only the lamb can take the book and
[13:02] loose the seals
[13:04] so father we would just commit ourselves
[13:05] to you both speaker and here
[13:07] here this morning
[13:09] and we would ask that you would come and
[13:11] take the uppermost seat lord and have
[13:13] preeminence and come and do
[13:15] only that which you can do lord that
[13:17] your divine purpose for this service
[13:19] will be fulfilled here this morning we
[13:21] commit ourselves to you and love you in
[13:24] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[13:26] would pray the bride says
[13:29] amen god bless you this morning it's a
[13:32] very fitting song for the scripture that
[13:34] i want to
[13:36] read here this morning so if you'll
[13:38] take your bibles and
[13:40] turn to john 3 and 16
[13:45] i would like to
[13:49] start there
[13:51] as you're turning i have a whole list of
[13:53] disclaimers that i have to give you
[13:54] before i
[13:56] preach this service
[13:58] but the first thing i want to tell you
[14:00] is god does love you
[14:03] and i love you
[14:05] and the third disclaimer most
[14:06] importantly is you're not allowed to get
[14:08] up and walk out
[14:10] and you're not allowed to throw things
[14:11] at me when i tell you what my title is
[14:14] so i want to preach this morning on god
[14:16] don't care
[14:18] and i know that may sound a little
[14:20] offensive and uh
[14:21] probably
[14:23] different than you've ever heard john 3
[14:25] 16 preached before
[14:27] but it is what it is
[14:29] and i asked the lord for a couple weeks
[14:32] to give me a different title but he just
[14:33] told me he didn't care
[14:35] so
[14:37] i'm kind of stuck with it
[14:39] but there's a spiritual principle laying
[14:41] underneath of that phrase god don't care
[14:44] and i think if you'll be patient with me
[14:46] and just give me a little bit of grace
[14:48] this morning that once we get to the end
[14:50] of this you're going to see a
[14:52] principle that will help us this morning
[14:55] and this is not targeted against anybody
[14:58] it's i'm not mad about anything
[15:00] this is actually something that god has
[15:02] been dealing with me uh for probably six
[15:05] or seven years now this thought has been
[15:07] stuck in my mind and then for about the
[15:10] last year and a half it uh
[15:13] really has been stirring within me and
[15:16] here we are now that i finally get to
[15:18] preach it so it's uh it's not something
[15:20] that happened last week i'm upset about
[15:22] like i with god as my witness i have no
[15:25] knowledge of any situation that i'm
[15:27] going to preach about this morning
[15:29] so if god hits you it's god hitting you
[15:31] it's not it's not me
[15:33] um and if god is dealing with us then
[15:35] we'll just allow him to deal with us as
[15:37] he sees fit but let's read this
[15:39] scripture and brother franco if you
[15:41] wouldn't care to do the lights like you
[15:42] did the last time that would really help
[15:44] me thank you
[15:46] um
[15:47] john 3 16 very common we all knew this
[15:49] but let's read this
[15:52] it says for god so loved the world
[15:55] that he gave his only begotten son
[15:58] that whosoever believeth in him should
[16:00] not perish
[16:02] but have everlasting life and if you'll
[16:04] turn now to revelation 13.
[16:12] revelation 13
[16:15] and verse 8.
[16:21] revelation 13 and verse 8 says
[16:25] and all
[16:27] that dwell upon the earth
[16:29] shall worship him
[16:31] whose names are not written
[16:34] in the book of life of the lamb
[16:37] that was slain from the foundation of
[16:39] the world god bless you as you would
[16:40] have your seats this morning
[16:42] so as we had approached this
[16:45] topic of god don't care let's go back to
[16:47] the book of genesis
[16:50] and i think we can
[16:51] have a picture start forming to us
[16:57] of what we're trying to expound let's go
[16:59] back to genesis 3.
[17:08] genesis 3 and
[17:11] let's go to verse 1.
[17:13] it says now the serpent
[17:17] the serpent was more subtle
[17:19] than any beast of the field
[17:24] god did not have to allow that serpent
[17:26] to be more subtle than any beast of the
[17:28] field
[17:30] god knew that that was the only seed
[17:32] that could cross with the seed of the
[17:33] woman
[17:34] but he allowed
[17:37] the serpent to be more subtle
[17:39] than any beast of the field
[17:43] so you might say that god did not care
[17:47] that the serpent was the smartest one
[17:49] out there
[17:50] even knowing
[17:52] that that was the only beast that could
[17:54] cross with the woman god still didn't
[17:56] care enough to make him a dumb one
[18:00] allowed him to be more subtle than any
[18:02] beast of the field
[18:05] and he said unto the woman yea hath god
[18:07] said you shall not eat of every tree of
[18:09] the garden
[18:11] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[18:12] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[18:14] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[18:16] which is in the midst of the garden god
[18:18] hath said you shall not eat of it
[18:19] neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
[18:22] and the serpent said unto her unto the
[18:24] woman ye shall not surely die for god
[18:28] doth know that in the day that you eat
[18:30] thereof then your eyes shall be open and
[18:32] you shall be as gods
[18:34] knowing good and evil
[18:36] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[18:38] good for food and that it was pleasant
[18:40] for the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[18:41] make one wise she took of the fruit
[18:46] thereof and did eat
[18:48] i think we would all agree that
[18:52] the omnipotent all-knowing all-powerful
[18:57] self-existing one
[18:59] elohim jehovah
[19:02] god almighty
[19:05] could have stopped this from happening
[19:09] he had created all things all heavens
[19:12] all earth
[19:14] he had created the beast of the field he
[19:16] had created the serpent he had created
[19:18] the woman
[19:21] i don't think we're so naive to think
[19:24] for a second that god couldn't have
[19:26] stopped this
[19:29] but god didn't care to stop it
[19:33] god didn't care to stop it
[19:35] because
[19:36] god had a plan
[19:40] and god had attributes
[19:42] and characteristics
[19:44] and expressions
[19:46] that he had to have this fall for
[19:50] so could he have stopped it sure he
[19:52] could have stopped it
[19:54] this is god almighty
[19:56] the creator of all things
[19:59] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[20:01] good for fruit food and that was
[20:03] pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be
[20:04] to to be desired to make one wise
[20:07] she took of the fruit thereof
[20:10] and god did not care to stop her
[20:14] she gave also unto her husband with her
[20:19] i think once again we could agree
[20:22] that god could have stopped him
[20:25] this was a direct son of god god had
[20:28] created adam by his spoken word
[20:31] and he wasn't even deceived
[20:35] but still god did not stop him
[20:42] and did eaton gave also unto her husband
[20:44] with her
[20:45] and he did
[20:46] he brother branham said that
[20:50] even before the bible was formed the
[20:52] word of god
[20:53] was written in the heavens
[20:56] he said adam was not deceived because
[20:58] adam knew that a dishonorable woman
[21:00] should not be lived with
[21:04] even before the scripture was written
[21:06] that a dishonorable woman should not be
[21:07] lived with adam knew that because it was
[21:10] a principle of god and brother branham
[21:12] says the word of god was eternal the
[21:13] word of god was written even before it
[21:15] was formed and put into the pages of the
[21:16] bible so adam not being deceived
[21:20] walks out
[21:22] and does something against the word of
[21:23] god that god could have clearly stopped
[21:28] but god didn't care
[21:31] because god had a plan
[21:35] and god
[21:36] had to express himself
[21:41] let's continue to genesis 4.
[21:49] genesis 4 8
[21:51] reads and cain talked with abel his
[21:53] brother
[21:55] and it came to pass when they were in
[21:57] the field that cain rose up against abel
[21:59] and his brother
[22:00] and slew him
[22:03] once again i'm going to ask you the
[22:05] question could god have stopped this
[22:10] abel had just caught a divine revelation
[22:13] from god
[22:14] of how
[22:16] and when
[22:17] to worship god
[22:20] and he had performed this in so much
[22:21] that god was pleased with this and
[22:23] accepted a sacrifice and a few moments
[22:26] later
[22:27] god didn't care enough to keep him alive
[22:32] this is stunning to think about this
[22:36] you say why
[22:37] why
[22:38] abel had forsaken everything he'd
[22:40] forsaken his own mind forsaken his own
[22:42] ways forsaken his own family he had
[22:45] forsaken the story that his mom and dad
[22:47] had told him
[22:48] brother brandon said his mommy and daddy
[22:50] told him it was apples it was fruit
[22:58] forsaken everything caught a divine
[23:00] revelation from god
[23:02] acts upon it and god is so pleased he
[23:05] accepts that sacrifice rejects cain
[23:10] but then a few moments later
[23:12] will allow cain
[23:14] to slay his brother
[23:17] why
[23:19] why didn't god care
[23:23] because god had a plan
[23:26] and god had expressions
[23:29] that had to move forward
[23:33] let's skip to noah i won't make you turn
[23:35] there in your bible i think you're
[23:37] getting the point
[23:39] noah
[23:40] it receives instructions from god
[23:44] and he says that's fine
[23:46] i don't understand but i'll do it at
[23:48] your word
[23:50] and for a hundred and twenty years
[23:54] god did not care that noah got made fun
[23:56] of
[24:00] a hundred and twenty years
[24:04] i would say that's longer than any of us
[24:06] have been alive
[24:11] so longer than any of us have been alive
[24:14] noah would come and preach a message
[24:16] and get made fun of be called insane
[24:19] have brother bran says they threw stuff
[24:21] at him they threw rotten fruit at him
[24:25] for a hundred
[24:26] and twenty years
[24:29] god did not care
[24:33] and we get upset if we have a bad week
[24:36] or a bad day
[24:38] for a hundred and twenty years
[24:41] god did not care to intervene
[24:44] and make them stop making fun of his
[24:45] prophet make them stop throwing stuff at
[24:47] his prophet
[24:50] 120 years is a long time since
[24:54] to be made fun of and have rotten fruit
[24:55] thrown at you like if you're doing
[24:57] something you enjoy maybe that's not a
[24:59] long time
[25:02] you go to abraham let's turn to chapter
[25:05] 12.
[25:10] chapter 12 verse 1.
[25:15] now the lord said unto abram
[25:20] get thee out of thy country
[25:22] and from thy kindred and from thy
[25:24] father's house
[25:26] and to a land that i will show you
[25:32] i dares to say that abraham loved his
[25:33] father
[25:35] loved his land
[25:37] loved his kindred
[25:40] and god did not care
[25:46] he said get out
[25:49] leave all that you love i don't care
[25:52] i have a plan
[25:53] i have attributes and characteristics
[25:56] that i'm going to express
[25:58] get out
[26:01] he did not ask abraham how that made him
[26:03] feel
[26:06] he didn't ask him if he liked it he
[26:08] didn't even ask him if he was agreeable
[26:09] to it
[26:12] god did not care
[26:15] he said
[26:17] get out
[26:21] skip over to genesis 13
[26:24] verse 7.
[26:28] so abraham leaves like god told him we
[26:31] know there's a little hiccup he took a
[26:32] lot with him
[26:34] but we come to 13 7 it says and there
[26:36] was strife between the herdsmen
[26:38] of abram's cattle and the herdsmen of
[26:40] lot's cattle and the canaanite and the
[26:42] perizzite dwelled then in the land
[26:47] abraham has forsaken his family he's
[26:49] forsaken his country he's forsaken his
[26:51] land he's on his way to where god has
[26:53] told him to go
[26:56] and god don't even care enough to keep a
[26:58] family feud from happening
[27:03] because god had told him to leave
[27:05] everything
[27:07] and abraham dearly loved a lot
[27:10] but god didn't care
[27:14] so he says that's fine you've
[27:16] compromised with my word you've brought
[27:17] your nephew with you i'll allow the
[27:20] church to split
[27:24] god didn't care about the church split
[27:28] god said get out
[27:30] and he didn't care about anything else
[27:32] he didn't care about abraham's feelings
[27:34] he didn't care about lots feeling there
[27:36] was i don't know how many of hundreds of
[27:38] people involved in this situation
[27:41] and the only thing god cared about was
[27:43] he had told abraham to separate yourself
[27:45] and get out
[27:50] so god didn't care about the family feud
[27:52] he didn't care about the church split
[27:57] we move farther into the story
[28:00] and sarah comes up with this genius idea
[28:02] to have the baby brought forth by hagar
[28:08] and god don't even care enough to stop
[28:09] it
[28:11] because god was going to express what
[28:14] happens when you compromise with the
[28:15] promise i've made you
[28:17] and here we would be thousands and
[28:19] thousands and thousands of years later
[28:22] and he's laid this in the scripture for
[28:24] us to remember when we put our hand to a
[28:27] promise of god and we try to make it
[28:29] happen and we try to use our will and
[28:31] our ideas this is the result
[28:34] ishmael
[28:35] a wild man brother branham said
[28:38] unregenerable
[28:40] meaning he cannot be born again
[28:44] his hand the scripture says would
[28:46] constantly be against his brother
[28:51] do we think for an instant god could not
[28:53] have allowed that to not happen
[28:57] he was speaking to abraham on a daily
[28:59] basis he could have simply said don't do
[29:01] that
[29:03] but god didn't care enough to keep it
[29:06] from happening
[29:10] when we look at these situations and
[29:12] know
[29:13] that god could have prevented this but
[29:15] didn't
[29:17] then we have to ask ourselves why
[29:21] and in the why
[29:23] is how we will come to understand
[29:26] as much as our feeble minds will allow
[29:28] us to understand what god is trying to
[29:31] do
[29:34] so sarah
[29:36] deviates from the word
[29:40] hagar produces ishmael
[29:42] [Music]
[29:44] and god shows what interjecting man's
[29:46] ident to his promise
[29:48] does
[29:50] we move farther in genesis we come to
[29:52] jacob and esau
[29:54] i got one question for you
[29:56] when we look at jacob
[30:00] how much trouble
[30:02] would have would god have saved
[30:06] if he would have just let jacob been
[30:07] before born before esau
[30:14] just that one thing just that one little
[30:16] deviation just allow jacob to be born
[30:20] before esau
[30:22] and like
[30:23] we don't even talk about jacob
[30:26] jacob's got no problems
[30:27] he's first in line for the birthright he
[30:29] does not have to do everything that's
[30:31] written in the scripture about him
[30:34] and all his shenanigans and deceit
[30:38] like that's gone
[30:41] just let him come out first
[30:43] do we think for a second that god could
[30:45] not have allowed jacob to be born first
[30:47] but he didn't
[30:49] so because he didn't and all of this
[30:51] falls apart we have to ask ourselves why
[30:56] why
[30:58] why did god not care
[31:01] he remember he says before you were
[31:04] formed in the womb jacob have i loved
[31:07] and esau have i hated
[31:09] but he still didn't care enough to let
[31:11] jacob be born first
[31:15] god didn't care
[31:19] everything that's written in there about
[31:21] jacob jacob would lie to his prophet
[31:24] daddy
[31:25] and would have would take sheepskins and
[31:28] put it on his arms all the trouble and
[31:30] the effort that he would go through
[31:33] all of this could have been
[31:36] simply diverted
[31:38] by allowing him to be born first
[31:46] look at joseph
[31:50] god loved joseph
[31:53] he was born a special person
[31:57] and god so endowed him with spiritual
[32:00] gifts
[32:02] to where it was marvelous and the things
[32:04] that he would see and prophesy
[32:06] was incredible but god would pour
[32:10] all of these gifts and this love and
[32:12] this anointing on joseph
[32:16] but he wouldn't give him enough sense to
[32:17] keep his mouth shut about it
[32:22] he would give him eve all of these gifts
[32:26] and all of these visions
[32:29] but he didn't care enough to tell him by
[32:31] the way you might want to keep your
[32:32] mouth quiet about that
[32:34] so now he would come and he would start
[32:36] expounding these things to his brothers
[32:38] and to his parents
[32:41] and they
[32:42] throw him in a pit
[32:44] act like he's dead
[32:45] sell them into slavery send them to
[32:47] egypt
[32:49] and all of that could have been avoided
[32:52] had god cared enough
[32:54] to say
[32:55] just keep that part about them bowing
[32:57] down before you to yourself son that's
[32:59] just for me and you
[33:03] but it begs the question why
[33:05] god would do all of this
[33:09] but yet he wouldn't allow him enough
[33:11] sense you might not want to tell him
[33:13] that part of the story it's of god it
[33:15] will come to pass but just
[33:17] leave that part alone
[33:21] he comes to moses
[33:25] moses is born to deliver
[33:27] he's predestinated of god to fulfill
[33:29] this plan
[33:33] moses is in the mind of god he's an
[33:35] attribute of god he's coming to deliver
[33:37] god's people
[33:39] but god don't even care enough
[33:42] that a few years before he's born he
[33:44] allows the king to issue this decree
[33:46] that all the man child hebrew
[33:48] that are born
[33:50] they're going to be killed
[33:53] he sets him up for failure to begin with
[33:59] this is unusual is it not
[34:01] how simple it would have been for god to
[34:03] have withheld
[34:06] that king's order
[34:08] until moses is born he's grown
[34:13] but god had a plan
[34:17] and god had to express certain things
[34:21] so he allows this king
[34:24] to declare
[34:26] just prior to moses being born
[34:29] all the hebrew man shall kill him throw
[34:31] him in the river
[34:37] so we see god supernaturally intervene
[34:40] and he spares moses
[34:43] he raises him up in pharaoh's house
[34:48] and
[34:48] just when it looks
[34:51] like
[34:52] oh
[34:53] now i see what you did lord
[34:55] now i understand
[34:58] you slipped him in to destroy from
[35:00] within now i've got it now i see
[35:04] right before this transpires
[35:07] god doesn't care enough and he lets
[35:09] moses lose his temper and slay an
[35:11] egyptian
[35:13] completely ruins everything that he had
[35:15] just put together
[35:20] so he comes to the pinnacle comes to the
[35:22] position god's called him to
[35:24] and god don't even care enough to keep
[35:26] him there
[35:27] lets it all fall apart
[35:29] lets him lose his temper murder a man
[35:32] and be run out of the country
[35:43] he comes back down to egypt
[35:45] after he's been on the backside of the
[35:47] desert for 40 years
[35:50] he's now in position he's now ready his
[35:52] character has been formed
[35:57] he's been back there with his lovely
[35:59] wife
[36:01] molding him
[36:04] and god has him prepared now he tells
[36:06] him this is what i want you to do these
[36:08] are the signs
[36:09] go and do it
[36:11] moses says i'll go
[36:13] walks down before pharaoh gives his
[36:15] message
[36:16] they resist his message he says that's
[36:18] fine i got one for you
[36:20] throws his stick down
[36:23] that'll teach
[36:24] you see god is with me
[36:29] and god doesn't even care enough
[36:32] to keep the from being impersonators
[36:34] there
[36:37] and they throw their stick down and do
[36:38] the exact same thing that moses did
[36:41] you would think after everything moses
[36:44] had went through up to this point
[36:47] that god would at least care once he's
[36:49] got there and given his message
[36:52] he would make sure everything goes
[36:53] smooth
[36:55] but god don't care
[37:00] god allows there to be impersonators
[37:01] there janice and jambruce
[37:04] does everything moses can do
[37:09] see he had showed moses and he had told
[37:11] moses this is what i want you to do and
[37:13] this is what i'll do
[37:16] but he never told moses everything
[37:19] see we have got to come to terms with
[37:22] the fact
[37:24] god is not obligated to tell us
[37:27] everything
[37:31] the sooner we come to terms with that
[37:32] and the sooner that we're able to
[37:34] operate
[37:35] and walk in that
[37:37] the better off we're going to be
[37:40] so moses fortunately was so broken by
[37:43] this time due to his relations with his
[37:45] lovely wife
[37:48] that he says
[37:51] i don't know what to do
[37:53] i've done what he told me to do and here
[37:55] they are and they do everything that i
[37:57] can do
[37:58] i guess i'll just do what i do when i
[38:00] get in and argue with my argument with
[38:02] my wife and i'll just stand here and be
[38:04] quiet
[38:08] and it worked
[38:11] it worked
[38:13] god supernaturally moves on the scene
[38:15] moses is rod or a serpent at that time
[38:19] swallows up the other serpents moses
[38:21] takes it back up
[38:24] but god did not care enough to keep
[38:27] moses
[38:28] from that uncomfortable situation
[38:34] you look at naomi
[38:39] naomi god did not care enough about
[38:42] naomi to keep her from leaving the
[38:43] promised land
[38:44] she had made a decision i'm going to go
[38:46] and do this there's no food here i'm
[38:47] going to break the word and i'm going to
[38:49] go outside of the promised land and try
[38:51] and get some food and god did not care
[38:54] enough to keep her this is naomi the
[38:56] friend of ruth
[38:57] who god was going to use to bring boaz
[38:59] on the scene and express
[39:02] one of the most beautiful pictures of
[39:04] redemption in the entire bible and the
[39:05] written word that we have now
[39:08] but we have all of that because god did
[39:10] not care about naomi
[39:13] he did not care enough about naomi to
[39:15] keep her in the promised land he let her
[39:17] go
[39:19] she lost everything saints she left with
[39:21] her husband her uh son-in-law and her
[39:24] sons and her daughter-in-law and she
[39:26] came back with ruth
[39:29] she lost everything and god for the sake
[39:31] of me and you
[39:33] to have that story in the bible
[39:35] didn't care enough about her to keep it
[39:37] from happening
[39:40] you go to david
[39:44] there's a list with david
[39:47] there's a list
[39:49] he comes and he anoints him
[39:52] king over israel
[39:56] but he don't even care enough to keep
[39:57] saul from trying to kill him
[40:01] i mean david's already got it rough
[40:02] enough i would think he's the littlest
[40:04] he's the ruddy fella his own daddy don't
[40:06] even want him to be king
[40:10] yet god supernaturally moves on the
[40:11] scene and anoints him but he doesn't
[40:14] care enough
[40:15] to keep saul from trying to kill him
[40:18] he never told david that portion
[40:20] he just said i'm anointing you king
[40:24] oh by the way saul is going to hate you
[40:25] and try to kill you every day for the
[40:26] next however many years he never told
[40:28] him that
[40:33] david comes to the pinnacle he's king
[40:36] the people love him he's in position to
[40:39] move israel forward
[40:41] and god rips the kingdom from his hands
[40:44] sends them out he's getting spit upon
[40:46] cursed
[40:48] rips it from his hands
[40:51] because god has got to express
[40:54] the portion of a rejected king
[40:58] to prepare the people
[41:00] for when he comes in the form of jesus
[41:02] christ
[41:03] god does not care enough about david to
[41:05] keep the kingdom from being ripped from
[41:07] him even after everything he's went
[41:10] through to get to that point
[41:15] he doesn't care enough to keep him from
[41:17] numbering the people
[41:21] we we
[41:22] acknowledge the fact that god could have
[41:24] kept all of these people from all of
[41:26] these things right
[41:28] but he doesn't
[41:32] but he doesn't he allows him to number
[41:35] the people and bring a curse upon the
[41:36] country
[41:37] he allows him to commit adultery
[41:41] and have an innocent man murdered
[41:44] just to fulfill his lustful passions
[41:46] that he can't keep in control god allows
[41:48] that
[41:50] totally preventable
[41:52] but god allows it
[41:54] you go to samson god
[41:57] has anointed samson from a baby
[42:01] to destroy philistines
[42:04] but he don't care enough to keep him
[42:05] from this one woman
[42:08] everything that he did in samson's life
[42:10] but he don't care enough to keep him
[42:12] from this one woman why
[42:14] why does he not care
[42:16] because god wanted me and you to know
[42:19] the results of not giving our heart
[42:21] completely to him
[42:24] no matter what anointing no matter how
[42:26] much he touches us no matter how many
[42:28] supernatural things he does in his life
[42:29] he says remember samson
[42:32] and he did not care enough about samson
[42:34] because he cared about me and you
[42:37] enough to make us aware to write it in
[42:40] the scripture this is what happens when
[42:42] you fail to give just a small portion of
[42:44] your heart to me
[42:48] amen
[42:54] look at job
[43:01] let's turn to job
[43:10] just about took off preaching there so i
[43:12] got to slow down
[43:14] i'm not
[43:15] not quite ready to preach yet i still
[43:17] want to teach a couple things
[43:20] but i'm fixing to
[43:36] we'll read in job soon as i can get to
[43:38] job
[43:40] let's go to
[43:42] job one and six
[43:51] yeah job one verse 6.
[43:54] now there was a day when the sons of god
[43:56] came to present themselves before the
[43:58] lord and satan came also among them and
[44:01] the lord said unto satan whence cometh
[44:03] thou then satan answered the lord and
[44:05] said from going to and fro in the earth
[44:07] and from walking up and down to it and
[44:09] the lord said unto satan
[44:11] has thou considered my servant job
[44:17] oh thanks
[44:19] thanks
[44:21] i give you thanks for all you've done
[44:25] lord i was been a good boy
[44:28] i was doing all that you commanded me to
[44:30] do i was covering for my children i was
[44:32] doing everything right
[44:35] and job's not even lying like if we have
[44:37] to say that then it may or may not be
[44:39] true but
[44:40] job's not lying
[44:42] he had the he had the proof
[44:45] i have been a good boy i am doing
[44:47] everything right
[44:49] and you don't care enough about me just
[44:51] to leave me alone
[44:53] you've got to bring me up before satan
[44:56] why
[44:58] why
[45:00] god could have picked anybody
[45:02] i assure you there were a lot of people
[45:04] doing a lot of things wrong that
[45:06] deserved satan's attention in that day
[45:11] but the one man who doesn't
[45:14] god don't care enough about him to keep
[45:16] satan from him
[45:20] go to job 2.
[45:25] and as if that wasn't bad enough
[45:29] he told satan you can touch everything
[45:30] but don't touch him
[45:33] if that wasn't bad enough god didn't
[45:34] care we go to chapter 2 and he says
[45:36] again there was a day when the sons of
[45:38] god came to present themselves before
[45:39] the lord and satan came also amongst
[45:41] them to present himself before the lord
[45:43] and the lord said unto satan from whence
[45:45] cometh thou when satan answered the lord
[45:47] and said from going to and fro in the
[45:49] earth and from walking up and down in it
[45:51] and the lord said unto satan
[45:53] hast thou considered my servant job
[46:00] mercy goodness
[46:05] i'm sure job is at the point he's asking
[46:08] the question
[46:09] god
[46:10] why do you not care about me
[46:14] i am doing everything you've told me to
[46:16] do i am doing everything for my children
[46:18] you've told them to do just in case they
[46:20] don't do it
[46:22] i am doing everything right i have been
[46:24] a good boy i'm all i've already lost my
[46:27] children i've already lost houses and
[46:29] lands and sheep i've lost everything but
[46:31] myself
[46:34] and now
[46:36] he gives satan permission to touch his
[46:38] body
[46:39] god did not care
[46:42] how job felt
[46:44] because god had things he needed to
[46:46] express
[46:52] god allowed everything to come job's way
[46:55] except for death
[46:59] i want to move on to the next one
[47:01] and this is the one that god started
[47:03] dealing with me five or six years ago
[47:05] jonah
[47:11] god
[47:12] speaks directly to jonah tells him
[47:14] something to do
[47:16] jonah goes and gets on the wrong ship
[47:19] we assume it's because he's backsliding
[47:23] how do you know don't maybe he just read
[47:25] his ticket wrong that day
[47:28] and got on the wrong ship like maybe the
[47:30] ship was at the wrong port
[47:32] i don't know
[47:33] we assumed that he backslid on god
[47:36] brother branham said that he's always
[47:37] stood up for jonah that he wasn't
[47:39] backslidden that he was in the will of
[47:40] god
[47:41] how do we know that there wasn't a typo
[47:43] on his ticket how do we know that the
[47:44] ship hadn't parked in the wrong port but
[47:47] what we do know is there came a point in
[47:49] time
[47:50] that jonah recognized i'm on the wrong
[47:52] ship
[47:54] and in order
[47:56] for these people on this ship to be
[47:58] spared
[48:00] bind me hand and foot and throw me
[48:02] overboard
[48:07] why
[48:12] why
[48:15] this is god's prophet
[48:17] why would god let's just say he did
[48:19] backslide why would god allow him to
[48:21] backslide
[48:22] let's say he didn't backslide and he
[48:24] just got on the wrong ship why would god
[48:26] allow him to get on the wrong ship
[48:30] why would god allow the storm to come
[48:32] he's the master of the winds
[48:38] jonah says bind me hand and foot and
[48:40] throw me over
[48:41] i'm quite certain that at that point in
[48:44] time in jonah's life he was not sitting
[48:46] there whistling a tune how great thou
[48:48] art
[48:49] and thinking
[48:51] i am getting ready to express the very
[48:53] life of christ to be bound nailed to a
[48:57] cross be in the grave for three days and
[48:59] resurrected i'm quite positive that is
[49:02] not what was going through jonah's mind
[49:04] i'm pretty certain what was going
[49:06] through jonah's mind was god why do you
[49:08] not care about me
[49:13] but god allow it
[49:16] and that's bad
[49:18] like
[49:20] being tied hand in foot and thrown off a
[49:22] boat in the middle of a stormy sea this
[49:24] is not good
[49:25] this is bad how many wants to sign up
[49:27] for that
[49:28] how many wants to sign up to be i don't
[49:30] even want to be hogtied number one let
[49:32] alone thrown in the water hog todd let
[49:34] alone to be swallowed by a fish and
[49:37] spend three days in the fish's belly in
[49:40] seaweed
[49:43] this is bad
[49:45] and god don't care
[49:48] but as bad as that is i've got one worse
[49:51] for you
[49:54] jonah
[49:55] the prophet of god
[49:57] has now had to spend the last i don't
[50:00] know how many thousands of years
[50:03] being known
[50:06] as the backslidden prophet
[50:13] tommy handed foot
[50:14] throw me in the sea give me three days
[50:16] in this in the whale's belly in the
[50:18] fish's belly
[50:20] don't let me spend thousands of years
[50:22] being known as the one to backslid on
[50:24] god
[50:27] but god didn't care
[50:29] it's stunning to think that god did not
[50:31] care enough about
[50:33] jonah's well-being to keep him from
[50:35] being bound hand and foot and thrown
[50:37] into the sea
[50:39] to be swallowed by a fish
[50:42] to spend three days
[50:44] in a in a fish's belly
[50:49] to be resurrected
[50:52] vomited up onto the beach
[50:56] god did not care
[51:00] i do not find any portion in the
[51:02] scripture to where he came and he said
[51:05] jonah how you feeling today
[51:09] do you concur with this plan that i have
[51:14] do you like this are you happy
[51:18] because god knows
[51:21] there is people in nineveh that will
[51:23] repent if i do something a certain way
[51:28] and there is no record in the scripture
[51:30] to where he said
[51:31] excuse me
[51:32] my prophet jonah
[51:34] these people over here will repent if i
[51:36] do things this way would you like to do
[51:38] that because jonah's answer would have
[51:40] been no
[51:41] just like mine and your answers would
[51:43] have been no
[51:46] that's why god didn't care
[51:48] god did not care
[51:51] what jonah felt
[51:52] thought or even if he concurred with it
[51:55] and like i said that portion is bad
[51:57] enough
[51:58] but now
[52:00] if you come and you ask jonah
[52:04] you get on the wrong ship
[52:07] and a storm comes
[52:10] you'll be bound hand and foot
[52:12] thrown into the sea
[52:15] and i will spare the rest of the lives
[52:17] on that ship
[52:19] are you willing to do that
[52:23] maybe
[52:26] what happens to me after i'm thrown in
[52:27] the sea
[52:31] what if i tell you that all of the men
[52:33] on that ship will be converted
[52:36] if i do that
[52:38] now he's got jonah's attention
[52:41] you tell me one other way that the men
[52:43] on that ship read the scriptures they
[52:45] were converted saints
[52:47] they bound him hand and foot they threw
[52:49] him into the sea and the next portion of
[52:51] the scripture the storm ceases and they
[52:52] says jonah's god is our god
[52:56] you tell me one other way that that that
[52:59] shipload of men was going to be
[53:01] converted
[53:03] you tell me
[53:06] but god never told jonah that
[53:08] and he never asked joan if he agreed
[53:09] with that
[53:13] but back to the first phase of that
[53:17] god tells him just say pre-adventure god
[53:19] tells him all of this
[53:21] and he tells him you'll go through all
[53:22] of that the men on the ship will be
[53:24] converted nineveh will repent in
[53:26] sackcloth and ashes and i will save an
[53:28] entire nation
[53:32] are you willing to do this
[53:35] maybe he's got his attention
[53:37] now he knows i'm going to survive the
[53:39] sea
[53:40] i'm going to survive the wealth it's
[53:41] about the fish's belly
[53:44] god's going to save the men on the ship
[53:45] god's going to save this entire country
[53:48] like it's starting to even out here
[53:52] but jonah after you do all of that i'm
[53:54] going to give you the reputation of a
[53:55] backslidden prophet for thousands and
[53:57] thousands and thousands of years
[54:03] god did not care about jonah's
[54:05] reputation
[54:06] to this day god does not care about
[54:08] jonah's reputation what god cared about
[54:11] was jonah doing what he told him to do
[54:14] and what he cared about
[54:18] more than he cared about jonah's
[54:20] reputation
[54:22] and jonah's comfort and well-being what
[54:24] he cared about
[54:26] was the men on that ship
[54:30] and was the the people in nineveh
[54:34] because god knows there is only one way
[54:36] to get to these men on the ship and
[54:37] there is only one way
[54:39] for this country of nineveh to repent
[54:43] look at all of the things that god did
[54:46] not care about about a just and
[54:49] righteous man this was not an
[54:52] this was not a sinner
[54:55] this was not a bad person
[54:57] this was god's prophet
[55:01] and look at all the things that god did
[55:03] not care about
[55:05] you say why
[55:06] i'll tell you why
[55:08] because god does not truly care about
[55:11] anything
[55:12] that does not have an eternal quality
[55:17] joseph jonah's comfort does not have an
[55:20] eternal quality to it
[55:23] i hate to
[55:24] pop your bubble but yours doesn't either
[55:28] mine doesn't either
[55:32] i'm not even god's prophet jonah is what
[55:34] jonah was
[55:35] and his comfort
[55:38] was not relevant to god's plan
[55:42] god
[55:43] did not care and does not care
[55:47] about anything that does not have
[55:50] an eternal
[55:52] element
[55:53] i'll say it this way so you don't get
[55:55] mad at me
[55:56] anything
[55:58] anything
[56:00] that god truly cares about
[56:03] has an eternal element to it
[56:06] i would be a fool to stand here and tell
[56:08] you that god does not care
[56:10] about every
[56:12] aspect of your life because we know he
[56:14] does
[56:15] every aspect saints
[56:18] we know he cares about us
[56:21] god
[56:22] cares about us so much
[56:27] he cares about things we don't even know
[56:29] about yet
[56:32] god cares about us saints
[56:34] it's just a title to catch your
[56:36] attention to make you think and because
[56:38] god wouldn't give me another one
[56:43] god cares
[56:46] but we better come to terms with what he
[56:48] cares about truly
[56:53] because there's rough roads coming
[56:54] saints
[56:56] there is rough roads coming i know that
[56:59] may not be popular to preach but i'm
[57:00] going to preach it anyhow
[57:02] we have not seen it yet
[57:04] there are rough roads coming
[57:08] and
[57:09] we had better be comfortable with the
[57:11] fact that god does not care about our
[57:13] comfort
[57:14] he does not even care about you say we
[57:17] are the bride of jesus christ he will
[57:19] protect my reputation no he will not i'm
[57:22] just telling you he's not going through
[57:23] saints
[57:24] if he cares to protect your reputation
[57:27] he will protect your reputation if
[57:29] protecting your reputation serves his
[57:31] purpose he will protect your reputation
[57:34] but what if allowing your reputation to
[57:37] go down the tubes serves his purpose
[57:41] you say that would net
[57:45] i bring to you exhibit a jonah
[57:50] god
[57:51] does not care about your reputation he
[57:53] does not care about my reputation unless
[57:57] he needs to preserve that reputation for
[57:59] his plan
[58:02] god does not care about your health he
[58:04] does not care about your financial
[58:05] status he does not care about your house
[58:08] he does not care about your
[58:09] relationships he does not care about
[58:11] your sons your daughters he does not
[58:13] care about anything
[58:16] as much as
[58:18] he cares about expressing himself
[58:21] getting the preeminence and redemption
[58:25] that is what was in the back part of his
[58:28] mind and that is what everything else
[58:31] is subject to
[58:33] does he care about your health oh my
[58:36] goodness yes he cares about your health
[58:38] how many times has he touched us in our
[58:41] health
[58:44] does he care about our well-being
[58:47] the angels of god are encamped about us
[58:50] as we would go up and down the road
[58:52] saints
[58:54] we
[58:55] we come driving down the road
[58:57] and are almost in an accident
[58:59] in a crash
[59:01] until we realize god cares about us and
[59:04] he prevented that
[59:05] what we fail to recognize is the hundred
[59:10] that we never even recognize that he
[59:12] kept us from
[59:14] that's how
[59:16] that's how much he cares
[59:18] as i said he cares about things you
[59:20] don't even know about
[59:23] there were 200 million demons loosed
[59:26] upon who
[59:28] the bride
[59:30] do you think you left your house and
[59:33] came to this assembly this morning and
[59:35] you didn't pass at least one or two of
[59:37] them
[59:41] and you didn't even know it
[59:44] but god so intimately cares about us
[59:47] that he knew about it
[59:49] and he cared
[59:50] and he prevented whatever maliciousness
[59:53] that they had planned
[59:56] from raising its head
[1:00:00] saints he cares
[1:00:02] he cares more than we can ever imagine
[1:00:07] but remember in the back part of his
[1:00:08] mind he had a plan
[1:00:11] and everything that he cares about
[1:00:14] has to be subject to that plan
[1:00:17] because that is what he truly cares
[1:00:19] about
[1:00:21] to express himself
[1:00:23] to get the preeminence
[1:00:25] and redemption
[1:00:27] he will forsake caring about everything
[1:00:31] else
[1:00:33] before he forsakes caring about that
[1:00:39] jonah is the one that astounded me most
[1:00:45] because
[1:00:47] we spend
[1:00:48] i'm just preaching to myself now saints
[1:00:51] i'm not preaching to anybody else
[1:00:54] we spend so much time
[1:00:56] and effort and energy
[1:00:59] trying to keep our own reputation
[1:01:04] and i'm not saying that's wrong
[1:01:07] like we should care about our reputation
[1:01:11] we should i'm not telling you not to
[1:01:13] care about your reputation
[1:01:17] but if you think and i think for a
[1:01:19] second that we can keep our reputation
[1:01:21] we are sadly sadly mistaken
[1:01:26] even the scripture says unless god keeps
[1:01:29] the city
[1:01:31] the watchman watcheth in vain
[1:01:36] if we will acknowledge the fact that god
[1:01:39] cares about things that we don't even
[1:01:42] know about and prevents them from coming
[1:01:44] our way
[1:01:45] that in and of itself should make us
[1:01:48] realize we have no capability to keep
[1:01:51] our own reputation
[1:01:53] because we don't know what's coming next
[1:01:56] how do we prepare to save my reputation
[1:01:59] from what we don't even know is coming
[1:02:00] next
[1:02:02] and we also have to realize that there
[1:02:05] are multitudes and multitudes and
[1:02:07] multitudes of
[1:02:08] examples in the scripture of where god
[1:02:10] did not tell everybody the whole story
[1:02:15] so he'll tell you the beginning of the
[1:02:16] story and you'll get a picture in your
[1:02:18] mind and fill in the rest of the story
[1:02:21] and take off running
[1:02:23] and then the story's not like what you
[1:02:24] thought it was
[1:02:26] and now you have no way to preserve your
[1:02:28] story that you made up
[1:02:31] or your reputation or your well-being or
[1:02:33] your comfort or your health or your
[1:02:34] financial status or your housing status
[1:02:37] because god told you a little blip of
[1:02:39] the story and then you filled in the
[1:02:40] rest of the story that is not god's
[1:02:42] fault
[1:02:45] that's your fault that's my fault that
[1:02:48] was joseph's fault that was jonah's
[1:02:50] fault that was all of these other
[1:02:51] people's fault
[1:02:53] that he told them a part of the story
[1:02:55] and they filled in the rest of the story
[1:02:57] and then they're standing there thinking
[1:03:00] why don't you care about me
[1:03:04] what they should really say is why don't
[1:03:05] you care about my version of your story
[1:03:11] god don't care about your version of his
[1:03:13] story he cares about his story and here
[1:03:15] is his story
[1:03:17] expressing himself
[1:03:19] getting the preeminence and redemption
[1:03:23] that's what god cares about
[1:03:28] daniel this was a man so righteous that
[1:03:31] he prayed three times every day
[1:03:33] so that the public would see him
[1:03:36] god didn't even care enough to keep him
[1:03:37] from getting thrown in the lion's pit
[1:03:43] the three hebrew children men three
[1:03:46] hebrew men
[1:03:51] i don't care what scheme you come up
[1:03:54] with i don't care what you do we are
[1:03:56] going to keep the word of god
[1:03:59] like if there's anything to make god
[1:04:01] care about you and build a hedge about
[1:04:02] you and keep you i don't know what else
[1:04:04] there would be
[1:04:05] i am giving my entire life to god and to
[1:04:08] keep his word i don't care what you do
[1:04:09] to me i'm going to keep the word of god
[1:04:13] i don't care if throw them in a fiery
[1:04:15] furnace
[1:04:17] god did not care enough to keep them
[1:04:20] from the fiery furnace saints he didn't
[1:04:21] even care enough to keep them on the
[1:04:23] steps of it
[1:04:24] he made them walk all the way up the
[1:04:26] plank and get thrown in the fiery
[1:04:28] furnace before he came on the scene
[1:04:31] could he not have came on the scene
[1:04:33] prior to that
[1:04:34] could he not
[1:04:36] could he not he was he's almighty god he
[1:04:39] can come on the scene whenever he wants
[1:04:44] but they had already made the
[1:04:45] declaration
[1:04:47] he's able to spare us but i don't care
[1:04:49] whether he does or not
[1:04:51] we will not deviate from the word of god
[1:04:55] god says wow
[1:04:57] that's impressive i wonder if they
[1:04:59] really mean it
[1:05:01] so here they go
[1:05:03] billy boppin up the ramp
[1:05:05] the guards start falling over dead
[1:05:08] no retraction
[1:05:13] this is not a story saints
[1:05:17] remember they get to the top and the
[1:05:19] guards are dead
[1:05:23] i'm not the sharpest horn in the shed
[1:05:25] but maybe you turn around and
[1:05:28] go back this way
[1:05:32] no saints they went in
[1:05:35] on their own accord
[1:05:36] and said whether he'll deliver us or not
[1:05:39] i don't know but he's able
[1:05:41] and if he does it we will still not
[1:05:43] deviate away from the word
[1:05:45] and god did not care in fact he gave
[1:05:48] them every out possible
[1:05:53] he gave them every
[1:05:55] opportunity
[1:05:57] to not
[1:05:58] put him to the test
[1:06:03] and they didn't take the easy way out
[1:06:05] they went in
[1:06:08] and then i'll ask you the question did
[1:06:10] god care
[1:06:13] did god care
[1:06:15] oh he cared
[1:06:16] saints he cared don't think for a second
[1:06:20] that he wasn't on his way the minute
[1:06:22] that he saw them going up the plank
[1:06:24] don't think for a second that he had not
[1:06:26] already left and was on his way he was
[1:06:28] on his way saints of god this was his
[1:06:30] children
[1:06:32] but god had to express himself and god
[1:06:36] had to have the preeminence which he got
[1:06:38] at the top of the plank and now god has
[1:06:41] to redeem this fallen nation
[1:06:44] and you tell me how is he going to
[1:06:46] redeem this fallen nation if these
[1:06:49] children don't go through on his word
[1:06:52] and he shows up as the fourth man in the
[1:06:53] fire to where the king would look and
[1:06:56] he'd say you better count them again
[1:06:59] something's wrong here
[1:07:02] numbers are off
[1:07:07] and the nation is converted by three men
[1:07:11] totally sold out to god who god didn't
[1:07:15] even care about their comfort or not
[1:07:22] let's look at jesus let's turn to isaiah
[1:07:38] isaiah 53.
[1:07:43] and before we read isaiah 53 i'm going
[1:07:45] to quote john 3 16 to you again
[1:07:50] for god
[1:07:54] for god so loved the world
[1:08:01] for god
[1:08:02] so loved the world
[1:08:07] that he did not care about his only
[1:08:08] begotten son
[1:08:11] you say that's not what it says that is
[1:08:12] what it says
[1:08:16] you say well how can you say that
[1:08:19] because god so loved the world
[1:08:25] if he was willing
[1:08:27] to give his son
[1:08:30] for the world
[1:08:31] that means he cared more about the world
[1:08:33] than he did his son
[1:08:35] if you take a dollar out of your wallet
[1:08:39] and you go and you give that dollar for
[1:08:41] something that means you cared more for
[1:08:43] that something than you did for that
[1:08:45] dollar
[1:08:47] or else you would have never taken the
[1:08:49] dollar out of your pocket
[1:08:52] god so loved you and me
[1:08:58] that he didn't even care about his only
[1:08:59] begotten son
[1:09:03] that
[1:09:04] whosoever believeth on him
[1:09:07] should not perish
[1:09:10] but have everlasting life
[1:09:13] isaiah 53 who hath believed our report
[1:09:16] to whom is the arm of the lord revealed
[1:09:18] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:09:20] tender plant
[1:09:24] why can't he be a strong tree
[1:09:28] why does he have to be a tender plant
[1:09:30] this is god's son
[1:09:36] a tender plant
[1:09:38] as a root out of dry ground this is
[1:09:40] god's son why can't he be well watered
[1:09:45] he hath no form or comeliness
[1:09:49] this is god's son
[1:09:51] why can he not be attractive
[1:09:56] and when we shall see him there is no
[1:09:58] beauty that we should desire him
[1:10:01] this is god's son
[1:10:05] why no beauty
[1:10:07] why does not why does god not care
[1:10:09] enough to make his own son beautiful
[1:10:15] god did not care enough to keep him from
[1:10:17] being despised
[1:10:20] rejected of men
[1:10:24] god did not care he let him be a man of
[1:10:26] sorrows
[1:10:28] god did not care he allowed him to be
[1:10:31] acquainted with grief
[1:10:34] god did not care enough that even when
[1:10:37] he would put him through all of that we
[1:10:40] would hide our faces as it was from him
[1:10:45] he would allow him to be despised
[1:10:49] he esteemed him not god did not care he
[1:10:53] surely
[1:10:54] bore our griefs
[1:11:01] he carried our sorrows
[1:11:06] we did esteem him stricken smitten of
[1:11:08] god smitten of god
[1:11:11] and afflicted and god
[1:11:13] did not care
[1:11:16] verse 5 he was wounded for our
[1:11:18] transgressions and god did not care
[1:11:23] could god have stopped that brother
[1:11:26] branham says the trees were lined with
[1:11:28] angels
[1:11:29] one twitch of his finger and this show
[1:11:31] was over
[1:11:32] and god did not care to stop it
[1:11:38] he was wounded for our transgression god
[1:11:41] did not care enough he allowed him to be
[1:11:43] bruised for our iniquities
[1:11:48] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:11:51] him and god did not care
[1:11:56] god did not care and so much he allowed
[1:11:58] the entire iniquity of the whole world
[1:12:01] to be laid upon him
[1:12:10] his stripes
[1:12:13] for our healing
[1:12:15] got allowed to happen
[1:12:17] god allowed it
[1:12:19] he did not care to stop it
[1:12:24] he was oppressed and god did not care he
[1:12:26] was afflicted
[1:12:28] and god did
[1:12:29] not care
[1:12:33] he opened
[1:12:34] up his mouth
[1:12:37] not
[1:12:38] open not his mouth he would god would
[1:12:41] put him through all of this he would
[1:12:43] allow all of this transpire
[1:12:45] and just at the point in time to where
[1:12:47] he would maybe want to raise his head
[1:12:48] and say father stop he says hush
[1:12:52] i don't care
[1:12:57] i don't care
[1:13:00] this is my will
[1:13:02] this is my plan
[1:13:07] i wonder saints just at that moment when
[1:13:09] he had enough remember he was 100 man
[1:13:12] he was 100
[1:13:14] god
[1:13:15] i wonder just at that point in time
[1:13:18] when all of this is laid upon him
[1:13:22] i wonder
[1:13:24] if maybe
[1:13:25] he wanted to say something
[1:13:30] i wonder just when he was right about to
[1:13:33] raise up and said father i wanted to but
[1:13:35] i can't
[1:13:37] i wanted to but i can't
[1:13:40] i wonder just prior to that
[1:13:43] if god
[1:13:44] the father looked down and he would say
[1:13:45] hush
[1:13:47] hush
[1:13:50] i care about benjamin sibo more than i
[1:13:52] care about you right now
[1:14:01] god did not care saints
[1:14:04] he allowed this to happen
[1:14:06] and i ask you the question why
[1:14:11] there is only one
[1:14:13] reason why he would allow this to happen
[1:14:16] remember this is not me and you this is
[1:14:18] the only begotten son of god
[1:14:23] that god turned his face as it was from
[1:14:26] him
[1:14:27] why
[1:14:29] for the sake of me and you
[1:14:33] for the sake of expressing himself
[1:14:36] for gaining preeminence in a man
[1:14:39] and redeeming
[1:14:40] me and you
[1:14:44] yet he opened not his mouth
[1:14:47] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[1:14:49] and as sheep before his sheer as his
[1:14:50] dumb he opened not his mouth he was
[1:14:53] taken from prison god did not care and
[1:14:56] from judgment and god did not care
[1:14:58] who shall declare his generation uh oh
[1:15:03] 90 degree turn
[1:15:07] because up to this point at statements
[1:15:10] this is what happened this is what
[1:15:12] happened this is what happened this is
[1:15:13] what happened this is what god has
[1:15:14] allowed this is what god has allowed and
[1:15:16] there is no part of god caring about
[1:15:18] this
[1:15:20] but now god cares about something
[1:15:23] because he's asking a question
[1:15:26] i have allowed all of this
[1:15:29] did he care saints oh my goodness the
[1:15:32] earth trembled he cared so much the sun
[1:15:35] hit its face he cared so much the whole
[1:15:38] cosmos fell apart he cared so much
[1:15:43] he cared
[1:15:45] but he didn't care as much as he did
[1:15:46] about me and you and about this purpose
[1:15:48] that was being served
[1:15:50] but now now he goes through this list
[1:15:54] of everything
[1:15:56] that he allowed to happen
[1:15:58] and now
[1:15:59] he mentions something he cares about
[1:16:04] i have allowed all of this to happen
[1:16:08] who will declare this man's generation
[1:16:14] now
[1:16:16] god
[1:16:16] truly cares about something
[1:16:20] because this
[1:16:21] is the eternal value
[1:16:24] of everything that he has just allowed
[1:16:27] now
[1:16:28] god reveals to us what he truly cares
[1:16:30] about
[1:16:32] what god truly cares about
[1:16:35] who will declare
[1:16:37] his generation
[1:16:40] i have allowed all of this to happen
[1:16:42] read through that when you go home
[1:16:44] nothing is good up until this point
[1:16:46] everything is bad everything is
[1:16:48] uncomfortable he is stripped naked he is
[1:16:51] whipped beyond recognition he has run a
[1:16:53] spear through his side
[1:16:56] and god did not care as much as he wants
[1:16:58] as he did about who it is
[1:17:01] going to declare this man's generation
[1:17:06] you would think after going through this
[1:17:07] the question would be and who will stop
[1:17:09] this who will intervene who will make
[1:17:11] this go away but it's not
[1:17:14] it's who will declare this man's
[1:17:17] generation
[1:17:26] for he was cut off out of the land of
[1:17:27] the living for the transgression of my
[1:17:29] people was he stricken
[1:17:32] and he made his grave with the wicked
[1:17:34] and with the rich in his death because
[1:17:35] he hath done no violence neither was
[1:17:37] there any deceit in his mouth
[1:17:39] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him it
[1:17:41] pleased the lord to bruise him
[1:17:48] it pleased the lord to bruise him
[1:17:51] saints
[1:17:53] god
[1:17:54] was not happy to bruise him
[1:17:58] he was not enjoying the bruising
[1:18:03] he took no pleasure
[1:18:06] out of the bruising
[1:18:09] but it was pleasing to him
[1:18:14] you say that makes absolutely no sense
[1:18:17] you're right it does not make any sense
[1:18:19] whatsoever unless you catch the
[1:18:21] revelation
[1:18:23] that what he was pleased by was the
[1:18:26] effects of the bruising
[1:18:29] because the effects of the bruising was
[1:18:31] allowing him to express the attribute of
[1:18:34] being a savior
[1:18:36] and it was allowing him to gain
[1:18:37] preeminence in a man and the effects of
[1:18:40] the bruising that he was pleased by was
[1:18:42] the redemption process that was going on
[1:18:51] did god care about the bruising yes he
[1:18:54] cared about the bruising saints but he
[1:18:56] did not care as much
[1:18:59] about the bruising
[1:19:00] as he did
[1:19:02] about what that bruising was going to
[1:19:03] purchase
[1:19:08] this should make us walk humbly just i
[1:19:11] mean this is the gospel 101 saints this
[1:19:14] is the raw baseline elementary gospel
[1:19:17] this should make us walk humble
[1:19:20] every day of our life
[1:19:23] god cared more about my redemption than
[1:19:27] he did about his only begotten son
[1:19:31] if that does not leave you flabbergasted
[1:19:35] i don't have anything else to offer
[1:19:38] if that is not profound to you i've got
[1:19:41] nothing else to give
[1:19:43] this is not
[1:19:45] an innocent sheep this is not a animal
[1:19:48] this is not even a good person this is
[1:19:52] the only begotten son of god
[1:19:56] that god gave for your redemption
[1:20:00] he cared more about you
[1:20:03] than he did about his only begotten son
[1:20:06] i'm here to tell you saints i love each
[1:20:08] and every one of you
[1:20:10] and there's some of you i'm not going to
[1:20:12] say all because i would really have to
[1:20:14] analyze it if i said all
[1:20:16] but i'm going to say most of you i would
[1:20:17] give my life for
[1:20:20] hey i'm just being real
[1:20:23] i'm just being real
[1:20:27] maybe
[1:20:28] not the most gracious but i'm just being
[1:20:30] real
[1:20:31] some of you i need to talk with a little
[1:20:33] bit more before i'm going to say that
[1:20:36] but most of you i know you and i know
[1:20:38] your character and i would give my life
[1:20:40] for you
[1:20:42] if it came push to shove i would
[1:20:48] but as much as i love you and as much as
[1:20:50] i would do that don't ask me to give
[1:20:51] william for you
[1:20:55] or seth or banaya
[1:20:57] i'll give myself
[1:21:00] don't ask me to give one of my boys
[1:21:04] not going to happen
[1:21:07] now think about what god did for you
[1:21:10] you parents you know what that means
[1:21:13] i'll give myself
[1:21:16] i will give myself
[1:21:19] but don't ask for one of my sons
[1:21:23] but god allowed all of this to take
[1:21:26] place to his son
[1:21:29] for you
[1:21:32] and in so much and don't ask me to
[1:21:34] explain this because i can't but i
[1:21:35] believe it but insomuch we know that
[1:21:37] this wasn't just god's son it was his
[1:21:39] son because it came out of god but this
[1:21:41] was god's son his only begotten son and
[1:21:44] this was god himself
[1:21:47] so he gave himself
[1:21:49] and his only begotten son
[1:21:58] and we would get puffed up because we
[1:21:59] know a little bit of doctrine
[1:22:03] and we know who the seventh angel is
[1:22:06] and we know what the seals mean and the
[1:22:08] thunders and the church ages
[1:22:10] lord have mercy on us
[1:22:12] [Music]
[1:22:14] have you given yourself
[1:22:17] have you given your only begotten son
[1:22:18] for this gospel
[1:22:21] we should be humble every day of our
[1:22:23] life
[1:22:25] take that into context
[1:22:27] and realize
[1:22:29] god did not hold out anything
[1:22:32] he did not care about anything
[1:22:36] more
[1:22:37] than he cared about you and me
[1:22:40] he literally
[1:22:42] gave
[1:22:44] everything
[1:22:48] because he cared about me
[1:22:50] and you
[1:22:55] we and thou shalt make his soul an
[1:22:57] offering when thou shalt make his soul
[1:22:59] and offering for sin
[1:23:01] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[1:23:03] his days and the pleasure of the lord
[1:23:05] shall prosper in his hand he shall see
[1:23:07] the travail of his soul and shall be
[1:23:08] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[1:23:11] righteous servant justify many
[1:23:14] for he shall bear their iniquities
[1:23:18] therefore will i divide him a portion
[1:23:20] with the great and he shall divide the
[1:23:21] spoil with the strong because he hath
[1:23:23] poured out his soul unto death and he
[1:23:25] was numbered with the transgressors
[1:23:28] and he bear the sin of many and made
[1:23:30] intercession
[1:23:31] for the transgressors
[1:23:35] god allowed all of this and did not care
[1:23:39] in so much that as christ is hanging on
[1:23:42] the cross he declares this
[1:23:45] he says god why do you not care why do
[1:23:47] you not care why hast thou forsaken me
[1:23:51] if you've forsaken something you don't
[1:23:52] care about it anymore
[1:23:54] that's what he's asking what my god
[1:23:57] my god
[1:23:58] why hast thou forsaken me
[1:24:02] why do you not care about me anymore
[1:24:04] since we think we get lonely but i'm
[1:24:06] going to ask you this there has never
[1:24:08] been a person that was as lonely as
[1:24:09] christ jesus at this point in time
[1:24:13] when we get so lonely we can still rest
[1:24:16] and know that god cares about us
[1:24:20] he declares
[1:24:21] why do you not care about me anymore
[1:24:24] this was a man put in a position that
[1:24:27] heaven could not accept him
[1:24:32] heaven could not accept him because he
[1:24:33] is bearing
[1:24:35] sin and the iniquity and the
[1:24:37] transgressions and those 200 million
[1:24:40] million demons are all stuck on him and
[1:24:42] he's burying them all and heaven cannot
[1:24:44] accept him
[1:24:48] and he goes to hell and they don't even
[1:24:49] want him there
[1:24:52] you think you're alone i assure you as
[1:24:54] lonely as you
[1:24:57] hell will still want you
[1:25:01] this was a man that was so alone
[1:25:04] heaven could not accept him and hell
[1:25:06] didn't even want him
[1:25:08] that's lonely saints
[1:25:10] and god didn't care
[1:25:13] he allowed that to be laid upon him
[1:25:17] so that when me and you
[1:25:19] come to those points and times in our
[1:25:21] lives when we think we're alone
[1:25:25] we can never get to the point to say god
[1:25:27] my god why hast thou forsaken me
[1:25:30] there was one man that god ever turned
[1:25:32] his back on completely
[1:25:35] and that was his son
[1:25:37] and he only did that
[1:25:38] for mine and your sake
[1:25:41] do not ever accuse god of turning his
[1:25:43] back on you saints it's a slap in the
[1:25:45] face to what he did to his son
[1:25:47] god has never turned his back on you god
[1:25:49] will never turn his back on you he says
[1:25:52] heavens and earth will pass away my word
[1:25:54] will not pass away
[1:25:56] what is the word
[1:25:57] [Applause]
[1:26:00] brother brandon says what is the
[1:26:01] believer the words in the book
[1:26:04] heaven and earth will pass away my word
[1:26:06] will not pass away i will be with you i
[1:26:09] will be in you even until the ends of
[1:26:11] the earth
[1:26:13] i will never leave you i will never
[1:26:15] forsake you do not accuse god of
[1:26:17] forsaking you
[1:26:19] no matter what
[1:26:21] little imp of hell is sitting on your
[1:26:23] shoulder giving you depression and
[1:26:25] giving you anxiety and giving you
[1:26:27] loneliness that is a demon that is a lie
[1:26:30] of the devil
[1:26:33] one man
[1:26:34] god turned his back on and that was only
[1:26:37] for the sake of me and you
[1:26:40] heaven couldn't take him and hell didn't
[1:26:42] want him he goes to hell and they kicked
[1:26:44] him out
[1:26:45] they said get out of here don't come and
[1:26:47] torment us
[1:26:50] get out get out go back wherever you
[1:26:52] came from
[1:26:57] you say why would god allow all of this
[1:27:00] why would god
[1:27:02] go so far
[1:27:05] as not to care
[1:27:07] about his only begotten son
[1:27:09] let's turn to revelation 5.
[1:27:28] revelation 5
[1:27:31] god did not care about anything else as
[1:27:34] much as he cared about revelation 5.
[1:27:37] brother branham says the most sublime
[1:27:39] portion of scripture in the bible
[1:27:42] if it's the most sublime portion of
[1:27:44] scripture in the bible i'm going to
[1:27:46] venture to say this is what god cares
[1:27:48] most about
[1:27:49] and everything else he does not care as
[1:27:52] much about even though he cares about it
[1:27:55] he cares saints
[1:27:58] nobody can leave here this morning and
[1:27:59] say brother ben told me god don't care
[1:28:01] i did
[1:28:03] but i'm telling you he does care
[1:28:05] about everything
[1:28:07] but he don't care about everything as
[1:28:10] much as he cares about revelation 5.
[1:28:13] revelation 5 verse 6
[1:28:15] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[1:28:18] throne and of the four beasts in the
[1:28:19] midst of the elder stood a lamb as it
[1:28:21] had been slain that's the portion of
[1:28:23] scripture that we just spent a half an
[1:28:24] hour on isaiah 53.
[1:28:28] so when it says as a lamb slain don't
[1:28:30] take that as just simple oh it was a
[1:28:32] lamb slain remember isaiah 53.
[1:28:37] as it had been slain having seven horns
[1:28:38] and seven eyes which are the seven
[1:28:40] spirits of god sent forth unto all the
[1:28:41] earth and he came and he took the book
[1:28:44] out of the right hand of him that set up
[1:28:45] on the throne and this is what god cared
[1:28:48] about
[1:28:52] this is all that god cared about because
[1:28:56] within this is the very essence and
[1:28:59] being an expression and character of god
[1:29:03] to express himself
[1:29:04] to have the preeminence
[1:29:06] and to bring redemption
[1:29:08] brother branham says
[1:29:10] all redemption
[1:29:12] hinged
[1:29:14] on this lamb taking the book
[1:29:17] john was weeping
[1:29:19] doesn't anybody care
[1:29:21] doesn't anybody care doesn't anybody
[1:29:23] care
[1:29:24] but there was one who cared saints
[1:29:27] more than anything in the world
[1:29:30] and remember this was not this was not a
[1:29:33] book saints this was not a book that was
[1:29:35] in his hand
[1:29:37] what is in his hand what is written in
[1:29:39] his hand what did jesus declare is in
[1:29:41] his hand
[1:29:43] me and you are in his hand
[1:29:50] i
[1:29:51] understand what i say when i say this i
[1:29:53] could take a lot of verses out of isaiah
[1:29:55] 53 and make it read this way
[1:29:58] god sent his only begotten son
[1:30:01] into the world and they did everything
[1:30:03] imaginable unto him because he cared
[1:30:05] about me and you being redeemed
[1:30:09] that is what isaiah 53 says
[1:30:13] that is what revelation 5 says
[1:30:17] because
[1:30:18] the lamb that was slaying
[1:30:21] the price for the book was a slain lamb
[1:30:26] remember what we said if you give a
[1:30:27] price for something that means that that
[1:30:29] price
[1:30:31] was you did not care about that price as
[1:30:34] much as you did about the something amen
[1:30:39] do we see the seals differently now
[1:30:41] do we see ourselves differently now
[1:30:44] do we understand what god is going to
[1:30:46] care about
[1:30:49] this is what he cares about
[1:30:52] the most sublime portion of scripture
[1:30:56] he did not care about anything as much
[1:30:59] as he cared about me and you saints and
[1:31:03] our redemption
[1:31:04] everything was secondary to that
[1:31:10] 1963
[1:31:12] in a message called he cares do you care
[1:31:16] boy wouldn't that been a lovely title
[1:31:19] brother ram says jesus cared enough for
[1:31:22] the message of today
[1:31:26] jesus cared enough about the message for
[1:31:30] cared enough for the message of today to
[1:31:33] bring these same things to pass as he
[1:31:35] said till he died
[1:31:37] and rose again to send them by the holy
[1:31:40] spirit
[1:31:47] jesus cared
[1:31:51] more
[1:31:51] about you hearing the truth than he did
[1:31:55] about the life of his only begotten son
[1:31:58] that is what the prophet said
[1:32:03] oh lord
[1:32:05] and we
[1:32:07] will leave it laying on a shelf
[1:32:10] and
[1:32:11] go to worldly entertainment
[1:32:15] and we
[1:32:16] even worse will listen to it and say
[1:32:20] that might be his opinion
[1:32:24] even worse will say i know brother
[1:32:26] branham said but
[1:32:31] let me read this to you again
[1:32:33] jesus
[1:32:35] also known as god
[1:32:38] cared enough
[1:32:40] for the message
[1:32:44] which i'll remind you came through one
[1:32:46] vessel brother branham
[1:32:49] of today to bring these same things to
[1:32:51] pass as he said
[1:32:53] as he said till he died
[1:32:57] he died
[1:33:01] he died for those tapes saints
[1:33:05] literally
[1:33:07] he died for those tapes and those books
[1:33:13] not for the plastic
[1:33:15] not for the paper
[1:33:17] but for the effects
[1:33:19] that they would have on your mind life
[1:33:26] he died and rose again to send them by
[1:33:28] the holy spirit the comforter to show
[1:33:30] his ministry today that he's still alive
[1:33:33] he cared enough
[1:33:35] won't we care
[1:33:37] that's the thing won't we care
[1:33:40] he died for this ministry
[1:33:43] there it is point blank
[1:33:46] why did christ go to calvary you can say
[1:33:48] well he went for this he went for that
[1:33:50] he went for my healing he went for my
[1:33:52] he died
[1:33:54] for this ministry
[1:33:57] this ministry as defined by this prophet
[1:33:59] was two things to re return the faith of
[1:34:02] the fathers to the children
[1:34:05] and to preach the mysteries of the seven
[1:34:07] thunders which are the mysteries of the
[1:34:09] seven seals
[1:34:11] brother bran says that was his ministry
[1:34:15] christ went to calvary to restore your
[1:34:19] faith to the faith of the apostolic
[1:34:20] fathers and he went to calvary so that
[1:34:23] the seals could be loosed and you would
[1:34:25] know the spiritual principles that laid
[1:34:27] under those for your redemption
[1:34:29] to defeat to defeat satan
[1:34:33] brother branham says that is what he
[1:34:34] went to calvary for that is what he died
[1:34:36] for was there other things that he died
[1:34:38] for was there other things included in
[1:34:40] that absolutely but as pertaining to me
[1:34:42] and you here in this age and this day he
[1:34:46] died
[1:34:47] so that me and you could hear brother
[1:34:49] branham's voice
[1:34:52] and the effect that that voice would
[1:34:54] have on us
[1:34:56] that's what he died for
[1:35:01] there was a wise man that once said
[1:35:03] don't ever take this message lightly
[1:35:07] don't take it for granted
[1:35:10] saints what has been given into our
[1:35:11] hands the literal blood of jesus christ
[1:35:14] has been given into our hands
[1:35:17] the message the bleeding bloody word
[1:35:21] what god truly cared about
[1:35:24] he gave into our hands
[1:35:28] he died in order that the holy spirit
[1:35:30] could be here in this day to show these
[1:35:32] things he cared for you he cared to
[1:35:35] bring it here he cared to make the
[1:35:37] statement he cared because he loved you
[1:35:39] he cared enough to do it to send the
[1:35:41] holy spirit to do this to make this
[1:35:43] ministry today
[1:35:46] i remind you of revelation 13 8
[1:35:49] and all that dwell upon the earth
[1:35:52] shall worship him
[1:35:56] except for those who cared about
[1:36:00] amen
[1:36:01] whose names are not written in the book
[1:36:04] of life of the lamb
[1:36:06] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:36:13] look at the disciples
[1:36:16] these were the disciples that forsake
[1:36:18] forsook everything
[1:36:21] and god didn't care enough about any of
[1:36:23] them except for john
[1:36:25] to make sure they weren't martyred
[1:36:29] after
[1:36:30] after
[1:36:32] after they had forsaken everything and
[1:36:34] given themselves completely to the word
[1:36:38] he still never kept him from being
[1:36:39] murdered
[1:36:42] he let peter be crucified upside down
[1:36:46] and didn't care
[1:36:48] even prophesied beforehand
[1:36:55] let stephen be stoned to death
[1:37:00] stephen
[1:37:01] a righteous man who had done nothing
[1:37:04] wrong
[1:37:05] living the word for his day
[1:37:07] god didn't care enough to keep him from
[1:37:08] being stoned to death you know why i'm
[1:37:10] going to tell you why because he cared
[1:37:11] more about paul than he did stephen
[1:37:16] brother brandon says paul never got over
[1:37:18] that
[1:37:19] affected him in so much that he wanted
[1:37:22] to be a martyr
[1:37:24] you tell me who god cared more about
[1:37:26] paul or stephen
[1:37:28] he cared about them both equally we know
[1:37:30] that
[1:37:31] but don't think for a second that he
[1:37:32] cared more about steven's well-being and
[1:37:35] his comfort than he did about the
[1:37:36] eternal effect that it would have on
[1:37:38] paul
[1:37:39] that's what he cared about in so much he
[1:37:41] would allow him to be stoned to death
[1:37:47] because he cared about paul
[1:37:50] and then he gets to paul and he allows
[1:37:51] him to be shipwrecked
[1:37:52] i don't know how many times
[1:37:56] allows him to be hungry allows them to
[1:37:58] be cold
[1:37:59] wet
[1:38:02] stoned left for dead beaten
[1:38:05] whipped
[1:38:08] this is his first church age messenger
[1:38:10] like if there's anybody he's going to
[1:38:12] care about you would think he would care
[1:38:14] about his first church age messenger
[1:38:17] god don't care
[1:38:18] even so much he told him beforehand i'm
[1:38:20] going to show you what things you must
[1:38:21] suffer for my name's sake
[1:38:24] so if god didn't care
[1:38:27] about stephen because he cared about
[1:38:28] paul and god didn't care about paul in
[1:38:31] so much as he
[1:38:33] cared about
[1:38:37] maybe me and you
[1:38:40] this is the first church age messenger
[1:38:42] and god would allow him to have all of
[1:38:44] these things transpired in his life
[1:38:47] for mine and your benefit
[1:38:53] he ended up getting his head cut off for
[1:38:55] the gospel saints
[1:38:57] the first church age messenger
[1:39:02] and we had a bad day at work
[1:39:04] somebody made fun of us
[1:39:06] one of our friends said something mean
[1:39:08] somebody didn't shake her hand
[1:39:11] i got a cold
[1:39:13] i got covered
[1:39:16] i got the monkey pox
[1:39:19] paul had his head cut off
[1:39:30] i was going to title this quit your
[1:39:31] whining but chad used that a couple of
[1:39:33] weeks ago so i can't type
[1:39:35] he took my title i've quit your whining
[1:39:38] i'm not preaching you that preaching to
[1:39:40] you i'm preaching to myself saints how
[1:39:41] silly we are
[1:39:42] how silly we are
[1:39:45] we know what the message says we know
[1:39:48] what the gospel says we believe it and
[1:39:50] then something in our life goes sideways
[1:39:52] and our immediate reaction is god do you
[1:39:54] not care about me
[1:39:57] paul had his head cut off
[1:40:02] we are not a church-age messenger
[1:40:06] like this is the first church age
[1:40:08] messenger if anybody has a right to
[1:40:10] complain outside of jesus christ i would
[1:40:11] think paul would have a right to
[1:40:12] complain
[1:40:16] don't you care about me
[1:40:17] like i've already been shipwrecked three
[1:40:19] times do i really have to be shipwrecked
[1:40:20] another do i really have to be stoned
[1:40:23] and left for dead
[1:40:26] like he had a list of things he could
[1:40:28] hold up and say enough's enough please
[1:40:31] we don't have that like i'm not
[1:40:33] disputing there's some of us been
[1:40:35] through some rough things
[1:40:36] but when you take your list and hold it
[1:40:38] up to pause we'd kind of just want our
[1:40:40] list up and throw it away
[1:40:43] why is the question why would god permit
[1:40:47] this why would god not care about these
[1:40:50] individuals
[1:40:52] in so much that he would care about me
[1:40:54] and you more
[1:41:01] let's look at brother branham
[1:41:05] hang with me i'm going to wrap this up
[1:41:07] tight
[1:41:08] and quickly
[1:41:09] so don't go to sleep on me stay with me
[1:41:12] we're coming to a close
[1:41:14] look at brother branham look at our
[1:41:16] messenger
[1:41:17] we looked at paul he's the first church
[1:41:19] age messenger
[1:41:20] but now come to the seventh church age
[1:41:21] messenger this is the seventh vial angel
[1:41:24] this is the seventh church age messenger
[1:41:26] i mean the list goes on and on and on
[1:41:28] this is the one that revealed the
[1:41:29] mysteries to john
[1:41:31] i mean his credentials his resume is
[1:41:34] quite astounding
[1:41:38] but god didn't even care enough to give
[1:41:40] him a decent house to be born in
[1:41:45] god didn't care enough
[1:41:47] to where in the winter when it would get
[1:41:50] cold his eyes would get matted shut from
[1:41:52] the cold
[1:41:53] and his mommy would have to bring up hot
[1:41:55] cone grease
[1:41:56] and rub it in his eyes just to get his
[1:41:58] eyes open and god didn't care
[1:42:02] he wouldn't even allow him to have a
[1:42:04] good pair of shoes to go to school in
[1:42:08] do you think for an instant that god
[1:42:10] could not have had him born in a palace
[1:42:13] with 20 pairs of shoes and 20 changes of
[1:42:16] outfits
[1:42:18] you tell me why god did not care
[1:42:21] didn't even have a good pair of shoes to
[1:42:23] wear to school didn't even have a good
[1:42:25] pair of clothes didn't even have a shirt
[1:42:28] wore his jacket
[1:42:30] couldn't take his jacket off god didn't
[1:42:33] even care enough that when he went to
[1:42:34] school he would sit there by the stove
[1:42:36] and sweat bullets and he couldn't take
[1:42:38] his jacket off because he didn't have a
[1:42:39] shirt underneath
[1:42:46] i'm
[1:42:47] going to venture to say that he got made
[1:42:48] fun of at school
[1:42:53] and god did not care
[1:42:55] you say well how can you say that
[1:42:56] because god didn't stop it
[1:42:58] did god care oh my goodness god carried
[1:43:01] saints those people were going to find
[1:43:03] out one day how much god cared
[1:43:08] but god didn't care enough to stop it
[1:43:12] god didn't care enough
[1:43:14] to where
[1:43:16] he would try to be a gentleman and carry
[1:43:18] a little girl's books home from school
[1:43:20] and he would get beat and his teeth
[1:43:23] mashed in
[1:43:25] by a group of bullies
[1:43:28] and god didn't care enough to stop it
[1:43:31] he would go home and said that's fine
[1:43:33] you'll beat me up i'll teach you a
[1:43:35] lesson he would go home and get his gun
[1:43:41] this is the seventh angel remember
[1:43:43] get his gun
[1:43:47] ambush them on the those that same group
[1:43:50] of boys ambush them on the way back from
[1:43:52] school
[1:43:55] not crazy
[1:43:57] not a wild man
[1:44:00] very focused
[1:44:02] and said they start freaking out oh he's
[1:44:05] going to kill us oh he's going he says
[1:44:06] stop it knock it off enough of that
[1:44:09] you're all going to die face it like a
[1:44:11] man get out here and see who's first
[1:44:13] he's not pulling punches saints he is
[1:44:15] not joking he is not pretending in so
[1:44:18] much he would tell him quit acting silly
[1:44:20] and acting like a bunch of sissies
[1:44:23] you know what you did to me
[1:44:25] i'm going to kill you here's my gun get
[1:44:27] in the line
[1:44:29] god didn't care
[1:44:33] this is not a story saints
[1:44:36] this is the seventh
[1:44:38] angel
[1:44:40] this is my and your prophet
[1:44:44] and god would allow him to be tormented
[1:44:47] and abused
[1:44:49] to the point that he would want to
[1:44:51] murder
[1:44:52] children
[1:44:54] we read about these kind of people in
[1:44:56] the newspapers and don't see it on the
[1:44:58] news nowadays
[1:45:04] i don't know that they'd had a school
[1:45:05] shooting up to that point how would you
[1:45:06] like to be following a prophet as the
[1:45:08] first school shooter
[1:45:12] you say all of that would never happen
[1:45:13] dad
[1:45:15] it almost did
[1:45:17] and it would have amen if god didn't
[1:45:20] care enough to stop it
[1:45:25] but now
[1:45:27] god looks down and at this point we'll
[1:45:29] say maybe he wasn't paying attention
[1:45:32] he was allowing all this to take place
[1:45:33] he didn't care
[1:45:35] because he never raised his hand about
[1:45:37] it but now all of a sudden
[1:45:41] he has taken it into his own hands to do
[1:45:43] something
[1:45:45] and now
[1:45:48] this has no eternal value linked to it
[1:45:53] and god says oh
[1:45:55] no
[1:45:56] i care
[1:45:58] not going to allow that to happen
[1:46:00] go ahead and pull the trigger
[1:46:02] pull it keep pulling it pull it till you
[1:46:04] empty your gun and he did
[1:46:07] and god wouldn't let fire
[1:46:10] why would god not care about everything
[1:46:13] leading up to that event but now he
[1:46:15] would care in so much that he won't let
[1:46:16] the gun go off those boys were worthy of
[1:46:18] it
[1:46:21] they were worthy of what they did to
[1:46:23] that prophet
[1:46:24] not even just a prophet just as a boy
[1:46:26] take his take his status away from him
[1:46:29] take his scriptural position away from
[1:46:30] him
[1:46:31] even if he's a rank sinner
[1:46:33] they still deserved it for what they did
[1:46:34] to him
[1:46:38] he never deserved anything they did to
[1:46:41] him
[1:46:42] and god permitted it
[1:46:44] they deserve everything that they got
[1:46:46] coming their way and god won't permit it
[1:46:49] you tell me why
[1:46:53] i'll tell you why
[1:46:55] is because god looked down and he said
[1:46:58] that does not serve benjamin siebold a
[1:47:00] purpose
[1:47:04] no
[1:47:05] you're not going to do that
[1:47:11] he lets a man poison the only friend
[1:47:14] that he has in the world
[1:47:16] his hunting dog
[1:47:18] prince
[1:47:21] like
[1:47:22] if going to school and getting made fun
[1:47:24] of every day is not enough
[1:47:26] not having good shoes not having clothes
[1:47:29] you've got nothing
[1:47:31] you've got nothing you know what you get
[1:47:33] for christmas you get an orange
[1:47:40] we come to reality we're spoiled to
[1:47:42] death
[1:47:44] this is the seventh angel and only only
[1:47:46] thing he gets for christmas is an orange
[1:47:51] but god
[1:47:52] would
[1:47:53] allow him not allow him to have all of
[1:47:55] this
[1:47:57] but yet he's got one friend in the world
[1:48:00] fritz
[1:48:02] two he had his horse sorry
[1:48:04] so he's got two friends
[1:48:08] he would allow a man to poison his
[1:48:11] hunting dog his best friend his only
[1:48:14] friend
[1:48:15] and kill him
[1:48:18] and god did not care enough to stop it
[1:48:25] brother branham had a bit of a temper
[1:48:27] he wanted to kill all their school
[1:48:28] children
[1:48:31] well guess what he wants to do to the
[1:48:32] man who poisoned his dog
[1:48:36] he says don't worry fritz i promise you
[1:48:38] i'll get him
[1:48:41] now let me let me tell you a little
[1:48:42] something about for those those of you
[1:48:44] that don't have a hunting dog
[1:48:48] you do not break a promise to a hunting
[1:48:49] dog
[1:48:52] has anybody ever read the book where the
[1:48:54] red fern grows
[1:48:59] you may make a promise to a person and
[1:49:01] break it
[1:49:02] and be sorry for it and not mean to have
[1:49:05] broke it you may do that
[1:49:07] but i'm here to tell you for those of
[1:49:08] you that don't have dogs
[1:49:10] you do not make a promise to a hunting
[1:49:12] dog and go back on it
[1:49:14] period
[1:49:18] he says fritz i promise you i'll get him
[1:49:19] i'll catch him out there and i will run
[1:49:21] him over he's going to make it look like
[1:49:23] an accident
[1:49:25] but he promised
[1:49:26] his hunting dog he was going to kill
[1:49:28] this man
[1:49:31] do not think for an instant he was not
[1:49:32] going to follow through on that
[1:49:34] do not think for an instant take it from
[1:49:37] somebody who knows
[1:49:39] you don't promise a hunting dog
[1:49:41] something if you don't mean it
[1:49:44] he meant it saints and he was going to
[1:49:48] do it
[1:49:48] but god said nope i care
[1:49:50] i don't care about all the torment you
[1:49:52] went through i don't care that you just
[1:49:53] lost your best friend
[1:49:56] but you're not going to kill that man in
[1:49:58] fact i'm going to let you be used to
[1:50:00] convert him
[1:50:04] and the story had a happy ending
[1:50:11] he didn't care enough
[1:50:13] to where he would have let he would let
[1:50:14] his hunting buddy blow his legs off with
[1:50:16] a shotgun
[1:50:22] god could have kept that from happening
[1:50:24] saints could he not have
[1:50:26] why did he not
[1:50:31] he allowed his barber to dump acid on
[1:50:34] his head
[1:50:39] do we think for an instant that god
[1:50:40] could not have allowed that to happen
[1:50:43] that he could have prevented that but he
[1:50:45] didn't
[1:50:46] he allowed his barber to dump acid on
[1:50:49] his head
[1:50:52] he allowed him to lose his wife and baby
[1:50:58] could god have had mercy and intervened
[1:51:02] yes yes
[1:51:04] yes but he didn't
[1:51:08] you want to know why
[1:51:12] because march of 1963 is a date on the
[1:51:15] calendar that cannot be moved
[1:51:19] this is the time that the lamb himself
[1:51:22] is going to descend from heaven and
[1:51:24] loose the seals
[1:51:26] that i will remind you
[1:51:28] all redemption hinges on
[1:51:32] march of 63. and it cannot be moved
[1:51:36] but there's one asterisk
[1:51:39] is god has to do this through a man
[1:51:41] because he's declared that's how he's
[1:51:43] going to do it
[1:51:44] and now god has from the time this boy
[1:51:47] is born
[1:51:48] 1909
[1:51:51] to 1963
[1:51:54] let's take away 12 years for the age of
[1:51:56] accountability
[1:51:57] if my math is right he has roughly 40 to
[1:52:00] 42 years
[1:52:02] to get this vessel
[1:52:04] into a condition that the lamb himself
[1:52:08] can step into it and break the seals
[1:52:14] that's why i never got by with anything
[1:52:17] that's why god never had time to deal
[1:52:19] with him me and you we can make a
[1:52:21] mistake god will deal with this over a
[1:52:22] course of years and years maybe whatever
[1:52:24] it is depending on the
[1:52:26] whatever it is
[1:52:29] march of 63 cannot be moved
[1:52:32] and this vessel
[1:52:34] is the vessel i'm using and it has to be
[1:52:36] in a condition that i can step into it
[1:52:39] in march of 63. i got 42 years
[1:52:42] to mold and to shape this vessel to
[1:52:45] where the mind of christ is in it
[1:52:48] to where when its mother-in-law would
[1:52:50] come and say you get back into that
[1:52:52] parsons just
[1:52:54] you be a good boy don't you be out there
[1:52:55] running around with them crazy people i
[1:52:57] don't want my daughter a part of that
[1:53:00] he learned that lesson one time
[1:53:03] god didn't have time for him to learn it
[1:53:05] again
[1:53:06] you want to know why
[1:53:08] because of my redemption
[1:53:11] if that vessel misses march of 63
[1:53:15] everything is lost including me and you
[1:53:20] and the world
[1:53:23] i'm not making that up that's what john
[1:53:25] said
[1:53:27] everything is lost
[1:53:30] if by march of 63 this vessel is not of
[1:53:33] a character that the lamb can descend
[1:53:35] and step into it
[1:53:42] god didn't care enough to keep his wife
[1:53:44] and baby
[1:53:45] you say god cared brother branham said
[1:53:48] it was like he pulled a sheet down on me
[1:53:50] and said i don't want to hear you
[1:53:54] that is god not caring
[1:54:00] did god care saints absolutely he cared
[1:54:02] do you think that did not grieve god
[1:54:04] absolutely no doubt it broke his
[1:54:06] heart but god cared more about your and
[1:54:10] my redemption that he cared about his
[1:54:12] wife and his baby
[1:54:17] thanks saints what he has given us
[1:54:20] think of what he has done for us
[1:54:22] think of the cost
[1:54:25] to bring this to us
[1:54:31] he didn't keep him from getting
[1:54:33] worked into
[1:54:35] a mental state that he tried to commit
[1:54:36] suicide twice
[1:54:38] once by gun once by electricity
[1:54:41] could he have kept him from getting to
[1:54:43] that stage absolutely but he didn't
[1:54:45] he was a completely broken man
[1:54:48] so broken that he wanted to leave this
[1:54:50] earth and god wasn't even allowed god
[1:54:51] didn't even care enough to allow him to
[1:54:53] leave
[1:54:58] he comes to the pinnacle of his ministry
[1:55:02] and god uses him the land himself uses
[1:55:04] him to break the seals
[1:55:07] and prior to that god reveals to him
[1:55:09] when you do this tens of thousands of
[1:55:12] people you thought were your friends are
[1:55:13] going to leave you
[1:55:18] you know where i'm going with that one
[1:55:21] god did not care
[1:55:24] told him in advance
[1:55:26] tens of thousands of your friends are
[1:55:28] remember this is a man who didn't have
[1:55:30] any friends now has tens of thousands
[1:55:33] and they're going to leave him
[1:55:35] because what god has told him to preach
[1:55:39] now we see what god cares about
[1:55:44] the entire religious realm turns his
[1:55:46] back on him walks away from him labels
[1:55:49] him a fanatic
[1:55:52] and god did not care
[1:55:55] god didn't care to when he does all of
[1:55:57] this he is a good and he is a faithful
[1:55:59] servant his
[1:56:00] character is in such a
[1:56:03] spot that god can literally
[1:56:07] put the power of the spoken word on his
[1:56:09] tongue and say whatsoever you say that's
[1:56:11] the way it'll be
[1:56:15] and god don't even care enough to keep
[1:56:16] him from getting killed by a drunk
[1:56:18] driver
[1:56:22] because god knows that the first elijah
[1:56:24] went to chariot
[1:56:25] that elijah's got to go into chariot i
[1:56:27] got to make sure benjamin seabolt don't
[1:56:29] miss it
[1:56:31] let him go in a chariot
[1:56:34] do you think for a second god could not
[1:56:35] have allowed him to have a peaceful
[1:56:37] death in his sleep
[1:56:38] or just took him
[1:56:41] but he says no he's got to go in a
[1:56:43] chariot
[1:56:45] benjamin siebel's got to make sure all
[1:56:47] the types and shadows line up i got to
[1:56:49] make sure he don't miss it
[1:56:56] all of that
[1:56:59] all of the disciples
[1:57:01] all of the martyrs through the dark ages
[1:57:04] paul irenaeus all of the church age
[1:57:07] messengers
[1:57:08] all of brother branham's life
[1:57:13] all of that
[1:57:15] god cared less about that than he did
[1:57:18] about mine and your redemption
[1:57:20] because he gave
[1:57:21] all of that
[1:57:23] for it
[1:57:32] church age book brother branham says
[1:57:34] think it not strange concerning the
[1:57:35] fiery trials that are to try you
[1:57:37] that is what peter said
[1:57:39] is it strange that god wants us to
[1:57:41] develop a christ-like character that
[1:57:43] comes through suffering no sir and we
[1:57:46] have we all have trials
[1:57:48] we are all tried and
[1:57:51] and the son sons not one but goes
[1:57:53] through that
[1:57:54] the church that is not suffering is not
[1:57:57] being tried has not got it and is not of
[1:58:01] god
[1:58:03] you say yeah our pastor just read that
[1:58:05] wednesday
[1:58:06] yeah i know
[1:58:08] god would deal with a man for five years
[1:58:11] hard for a year and a half giving him
[1:58:13] inspiration to preach something and then
[1:58:15] he won't care enough to keep somebody
[1:58:17] from preaching the wednesday before
[1:58:21] god don't care about anything
[1:58:23] when it comes to our comfort and our
[1:58:25] well-being and what we want and what we
[1:58:27] think should happen
[1:58:30] the church that is not suffering that is
[1:58:33] not being tried has not got it it is not
[1:58:36] of god
[1:58:37] now this special condition and summer
[1:58:39] near must be applied hang on tight we're
[1:58:41] going to go fast now and wrap this up
[1:58:43] must be applied to every age there is no
[1:58:45] age free from it there is no true
[1:58:46] believer free from it this is of god
[1:58:49] this is the will of god it is needful we
[1:58:52] need the lord to teach us the truth that
[1:58:54] we are to suffer and be christ-like in
[1:58:55] doing it the cloudy skies and storms of
[1:58:58] life are no signs of god's disapproval i
[1:59:01] i could probably preach this every time
[1:59:03] that i minister from now until god takes
[1:59:05] me off the scene if you will grasp this
[1:59:07] it will change your life saints
[1:59:09] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[1:59:12] no signs of god's approval
[1:59:14] disapproval
[1:59:16] meaning no external circumstance is a
[1:59:21] sign of god's disapproval
[1:59:27] that if you
[1:59:28] will understand that will alleviate 90
[1:59:32] of your mental battles
[1:59:35] because that's what we do we see an
[1:59:36] external circumstance we immediately
[1:59:38] take it to the spiritual realm and say
[1:59:39] what's wrong with me
[1:59:42] the prophet said nothing
[1:59:45] it's no sign of anything
[1:59:48] if anything it's a sign that you're a
[1:59:49] son or daughter of god and you're being
[1:59:51] tried
[1:59:52] and that's needful
[1:59:54] be comfortable with it because god don't
[1:59:56] care
[1:59:58] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[2:00:00] no sign of god's disapproval neither are
[2:00:02] bright skies and still water sign of his
[2:00:04] love and approval his approval of any of
[2:00:07] us is only in the beloved
[2:00:10] election his love is elective which he
[2:00:13] had for us before the foundation of the
[2:00:15] world what can any external circumstance
[2:00:18] do to change a predestinated elective
[2:00:21] love of god for you
[2:00:24] nothing
[2:00:25] so if nothing can change that and god
[2:00:29] don't care about it why should we care
[2:00:31] about it
[2:00:33] but why do we spend 90 of our time
[2:00:35] trying to fix external circumstances
[2:00:38] that are making us uncomfortable
[2:00:42] that's what we do saints i said we i
[2:00:44] didn't say you i said we i do it every
[2:00:46] day see external circumstance try to fix
[2:00:49] it for my comfort
[2:00:53] and it's no sign of anything
[2:00:58] you see they could not figure out god's
[2:01:00] love that's the problem
[2:01:02] they thought that love meant no
[2:01:04] suffering they thought that love meant a
[2:01:06] baby with parental care but god said his
[2:01:08] love was elective love the proof of his
[2:01:11] love is election period
[2:01:14] that no matter what happened what
[2:01:17] happened what happened that covers a lot
[2:01:19] of things no matter what happened
[2:01:23] his love was proven truly by the fact
[2:01:25] they were chosen unto salvation he may
[2:01:28] commit you to death
[2:01:30] i thought you was telling me how much
[2:01:31] god loved me
[2:01:35] he may commit you to death
[2:01:38] as he did paul he may commit you to
[2:01:40] suffering as he did job that is his
[2:01:42] prerogative he is sovereign but is all
[2:01:45] with a purpose
[2:01:49] the purpose is what he cares about
[2:01:52] not the external circumstances
[2:01:56] if he did not have a purpose then he
[2:01:58] would be the author of frustration
[2:02:00] and not of peace
[2:02:02] his purpose
[2:02:03] is that after we have suffered
[2:02:06] a while
[2:02:07] we would be made perfect
[2:02:09] be established
[2:02:11] strengthened
[2:02:12] and settled
[2:02:15] i've spent a long long long time telling
[2:02:17] you what god don't care about
[2:02:20] let me take a short time and tell you
[2:02:21] what he does care about
[2:02:24] you
[2:02:25] being made perfect
[2:02:28] being established
[2:02:31] being strengthened
[2:02:34] and being settled
[2:02:36] i'll read it this way
[2:02:39] would be made perfect in his word
[2:02:42] established in his word
[2:02:45] strengthened in his word
[2:02:48] and settled in his word
[2:02:52] that's what he cares about
[2:02:55] and he will forsake everything else to
[2:02:58] accomplish that
[2:03:00] god of this evil age brother branham
[2:03:02] says what would god call a people out of
[2:03:04] this age for
[2:03:05] out of this evil age
[2:03:08] the reason is
[2:03:09] is to try her how many wants to be
[2:03:12] called of god
[2:03:15] come on put your hands up you know you
[2:03:17] do
[2:03:18] it is a trick question but go ahead and
[2:03:20] fall for it
[2:03:22] how many wants to be called of god
[2:03:26] why would he do that in this evil age
[2:03:29] the reason is
[2:03:31] is to try her
[2:03:34] when she has made manifest been tried
[2:03:37] been proven
[2:03:38] proved to satan like it was at the
[2:03:40] beginning so shall it be at the end he
[2:03:43] says we find now this evil age is to
[2:03:46] prove to satan
[2:03:48] she is not like eve
[2:03:52] so if you want to be called you want to
[2:03:53] be chosen
[2:03:56] it's because god wants to use your
[2:03:58] vessel to prove to satan you're not like
[2:04:01] the first steve
[2:04:02] that's the purpose of him calling you
[2:04:05] and choosing you
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:07] you say well i just wanted him to love
[2:04:09] me he does
[2:04:10] i just wanted to heal me he will
[2:04:13] i just wanted to take care of my
[2:04:14] finances he will
[2:04:16] i just wanted him to he will
[2:04:19] he will he will he will he will
[2:04:23] unless it doesn't serve his purpose and
[2:04:24] then he don't care
[2:04:28] if it serves his purpose to prove to
[2:04:30] satan that you're not like eve
[2:04:32] he will
[2:04:35] and she will be tried by his word
[2:04:38] the bride as adam's bride was tried by
[2:04:40] his word christ is revealed in his own
[2:04:43] word 65 there ain't going to be no more
[2:04:45] big sweeping revivals this nation will
[2:04:47] never receive it you might have an
[2:04:49] intellectual gathering but i mean a
[2:04:51] spiritual revival we have seen all of it
[2:04:53] i hope you're catching it
[2:04:58] i'm saying it in such a way that i hope
[2:05:00] you will get it
[2:05:02] see
[2:05:03] it's
[2:05:04] over a fine minister said a while ago
[2:05:07] said brother branham if i could just
[2:05:08] have the joy of the lord in my heart i
[2:05:10] said son the revival is over
[2:05:15] that's encouraging
[2:05:18] i just want the joy of the lord in my
[2:05:20] heart it's over son forget about it god
[2:05:21] don't care
[2:05:24] brother branham is not saying that this
[2:05:25] man can't have the joy of the lord in
[2:05:27] his heart what he's doing is he's
[2:05:28] recognizing what this brother is saying
[2:05:31] the brother is saying i want a big
[2:05:32] sweeping revival like we've had through
[2:05:35] the 50s
[2:05:36] brother brown says it's over you better
[2:05:38] have the joy of the lord in your own
[2:05:39] heart you better have your own revival
[2:05:42] son the revival's over
[2:05:48] see
[2:05:49] now the stabilizers have been put on the
[2:05:52] ship
[2:05:53] okay now he's putting us in a mark in
[2:05:55] time
[2:05:57] revival's over
[2:05:58] big sweeping revival's gone never to be
[2:06:00] no more
[2:06:02] stabilizers have been put on the ship
[2:06:07] joyous times wonderful times revivals
[2:06:10] joy of the lord in my heart
[2:06:12] over
[2:06:13] stabilizers on the ship
[2:06:16] not the sharpest tool in the shed but i
[2:06:18] can pretty much guess what's coming
[2:06:21] you do not put stabilizers on a ship
[2:06:23] unless there's a storm coming
[2:06:26] brother branham declares the revival age
[2:06:28] is over
[2:06:30] storm's coming
[2:06:32] but
[2:06:33] the stabilizers have been put on the
[2:06:35] ship
[2:06:36] great fearful waves are out here before
[2:06:38] us
[2:06:39] but we know just beyond that wave yonder
[2:06:42] this is 65 end of his ministry saints
[2:06:45] he's declaring great fearful things are
[2:06:48] ahead of us
[2:06:49] but we know just beyond that wave yonder
[2:06:52] we're nearing the shore just stay
[2:06:55] stable
[2:07:00] stay
[2:07:01] stable
[2:07:03] just stay in the word
[2:07:09] those two are linked together if you are
[2:07:12] not in the word you are not going to be
[2:07:14] stable
[2:07:17] let it stay stable when you see all
[2:07:20] these great big old clouds around us
[2:07:22] storms coming and atomic bombs and
[2:07:24] everything else they're talking about
[2:07:26] but our stabilizer is right straight in
[2:07:28] the word god said it would be here we'll
[2:07:31] crest every one of them he did not say
[2:07:33] that god will make them smooth he says
[2:07:35] stabilizers are on the ship we will
[2:07:38] crest every one of them
[2:07:40] i'll break it down for you just in case
[2:07:42] you're not getting it
[2:07:44] the trials are going to come
[2:07:46] they are going to be great they are
[2:07:48] going to be fearful they are going to be
[2:07:50] real
[2:07:52] and god does not care to take them away
[2:07:58] but he has given you stabilizers
[2:08:02] to put on your vessel
[2:08:04] that you will crest every one of them
[2:08:06] you may gurgle water for a little bit
[2:08:11] but you will crest every one of them
[2:08:14] you may go under them
[2:08:16] but you will come out of them
[2:08:19] they are going to come you will go
[2:08:21] through them you may be under them
[2:08:24] but at some point in time god will say
[2:08:26] enough is enough and i've accomplished
[2:08:28] what i'm after and you will crest that
[2:08:30] wave
[2:08:32] if and only if
[2:08:34] you have put the stabilizers on your
[2:08:35] ship
[2:08:39] how many want stabilizers
[2:08:46] yes we'll go right over the top of them
[2:08:48] yes indeed they they cannot sing us sink
[2:08:50] us they cannot drown us you put us in
[2:08:53] the grave we'll come out again whatever
[2:08:55] it might be let it come if i live i live
[2:08:58] to the glory of god if i die then i die
[2:09:00] to the glory of god
[2:09:01] you
[2:09:02] i will remind you you do not put
[2:09:04] stabilizers on a ship when everything is
[2:09:06] calm
[2:09:08] unless
[2:09:09] you see a storm coming
[2:09:13] you are not going to get a free pass on
[2:09:16] all the troubles that the world faces
[2:09:17] saints
[2:09:19] they're coming they're real they're
[2:09:21] going to hit you as the bride of jesus
[2:09:22] christ just as they hit them and more so
[2:09:27] that's the reason we've been given
[2:09:28] stabilizers
[2:09:31] we have been given stabilizers for our
[2:09:33] health issues
[2:09:36] god may not care about our health issues
[2:09:38] for a little bit we have a promise he
[2:09:40] will heal us he does not say when he
[2:09:42] does not say how
[2:09:43] and if he has a purpose for a health
[2:09:45] issue to come by your way
[2:09:48] he'll let it come and he will not care
[2:09:50] if he has a purpose for a loved one
[2:09:52] passing he will let that loved one pass
[2:09:56] it's not an easy thing but if hit serves
[2:09:58] his purpose he will allow it to happen
[2:10:00] and he will not care enough to turn his
[2:10:02] hand for it
[2:10:04] because he has a plan
[2:10:06] and he is going to express himself he is
[2:10:08] going to get the preeminence and he is
[2:10:10] going to have your redemption
[2:10:16] if your job issue
[2:10:19] needs to serve his purpose
[2:10:21] he'll raise an issue if your financials
[2:10:24] need to serve his purpose
[2:10:25] he will not care
[2:10:30] i'm here to tell you that god does not
[2:10:32] care about money issues he does not care
[2:10:34] about economies collapsing he does not
[2:10:36] care about
[2:10:37] corrupt political systems
[2:10:42] it is serving his purpose
[2:10:44] he does not care about wars he does not
[2:10:46] care about famines he does not care
[2:10:48] about natural disasters it is serving
[2:10:50] his purpose
[2:10:51] and if it does not serve his purpose he
[2:10:53] will put a stop to it
[2:10:56] he does not care about pandemics he does
[2:10:58] not care about immorality here's a
[2:11:00] shocker for you he doesn't even care
[2:11:01] about false doctrines about around the
[2:11:02] message
[2:11:07] unless it does not serve his purpose and
[2:11:09] then he'll squish it
[2:11:11] real quick
[2:11:13] but if it serves his purpose
[2:11:16] he'll allow it
[2:11:18] you say god wouldn't that's what he did
[2:11:20] to israel
[2:11:22] he said i have raised you up false
[2:11:24] prophets
[2:11:25] to see if you will go after them instead
[2:11:27] of the word
[2:11:29] think he won't do that to us saints
[2:11:32] he will do it
[2:11:34] think false doctrines around the message
[2:11:36] as new
[2:11:39] it's been in every age around every
[2:11:40] message
[2:11:41] and god didn't care enough to stop it
[2:11:44] because he had a purpose
[2:11:47] god don't care about church splits
[2:11:50] god does not care about false ministries
[2:11:52] god does not even care about great
[2:11:54] fallings away
[2:11:57] he'll allow it to happen
[2:11:59] why
[2:12:00] to express himself
[2:12:02] to get the preeminence in you
[2:12:04] and to restore you to eden
[2:12:11] john 13 verse 1 as the musicians come
[2:12:17] john 13 verse 1 now before the feast of
[2:12:19] the passover when jesus knew that his
[2:12:21] hour was come that he should depart out
[2:12:22] of this world unto the father having
[2:12:24] loved his own which were in the world he
[2:12:26] loved them unto the end and supper being
[2:12:28] ended the devil now having having now
[2:12:30] put into the heart of judas iscariot
[2:12:33] simon's son to betray him
[2:12:36] you all said you wanted stabilizers a
[2:12:38] little while ago here's your stabilizers
[2:12:42] jesus knowing that the father had given
[2:12:44] all things into his hands
[2:12:46] and that he was come from god
[2:12:48] and went to god
[2:12:53] he rises from supper laid aside his
[2:12:55] garments and took a towel and girded
[2:12:57] himself after that he poureth water into
[2:12:59] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[2:13:01] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[2:13:02] wherewith he was girded
[2:13:04] i want to remind you that judas got his
[2:13:06] feet washed
[2:13:10] the one that betrayed him
[2:13:17] you think for a second he didn't know
[2:13:19] who he was the scripture declares he
[2:13:20] knew who he was
[2:13:23] but he lets him sit right next to him at
[2:13:25] dinner he'll stop and give to him
[2:13:28] he'll wash his feet
[2:13:30] he'll do all of these things knowing
[2:13:32] he's a thief at heart and he's the one
[2:13:33] to betray him
[2:13:35] why
[2:13:36] why
[2:13:37] why how easy it would have been just to
[2:13:39] kick him out
[2:13:43] god
[2:13:44] knowing this was the one that was going
[2:13:47] to fulfill this was satan incarnate
[2:13:51] and god didn't even care enough to keep
[2:13:53] him away from his only begotten son
[2:13:56] why because god had a plan
[2:14:01] jesus comes to that revelation
[2:14:04] and he doesn't even care enough to keep
[2:14:06] him from the last supper
[2:14:09] why
[2:14:11] because the stabilizers have been put on
[2:14:13] the ship
[2:14:15] verse 3
[2:14:17] jesus knowing that the father had given
[2:14:20] all things into his hands
[2:14:22] what were those all things
[2:14:27] me and you saints
[2:14:29] what's in his hands read the scriptures
[2:14:31] what's in his hands we're engraved in
[2:14:34] the palm of his hands let me read it to
[2:14:37] you this way jesus knowing that the
[2:14:40] father had given him benjamin seabolt
[2:14:45] in his hands
[2:14:47] my life is in his hands saints
[2:14:50] my life is in his hands and on his mind
[2:14:53] when he makes this decision
[2:14:56] knowing that god had given him the
[2:14:58] redemption of benjamin seabolt
[2:15:00] put your name in there
[2:15:04] and that he was come from god and went
[2:15:06] to god
[2:15:08] stabilizers on the ship
[2:15:12] he rises from supper
[2:15:14] and washed the devil's feet
[2:15:19] we get a revelation we came from god and
[2:15:21] are going to god and we sure don't wash
[2:15:22] our disciples the devil's feet sometimes
[2:15:24] we're so haughty we won't even wash our
[2:15:26] brother's feet
[2:15:29] how pride and prideful and arrogant we
[2:15:31] can be
[2:15:33] somebody will do something to rub us a
[2:15:35] little the wrong way
[2:15:36] we'll fall out of fellowship with them
[2:15:39] speak evil of them won't shake their
[2:15:41] hand won't wash their feet avoid them
[2:15:47] jesus knowing this was the incarnate
[2:15:49] devil
[2:15:51] washed his feet
[2:15:54] based on the revelation
[2:15:56] that all things are in my hand
[2:15:58] i come from god and i'm going to god
[2:16:01] the reaction and the response and the
[2:16:04] result
[2:16:06] he humbled himself
[2:16:08] and washed satan's incarnate feet
[2:16:13] we have no right to be proud for about
[2:16:16] anything
[2:16:18] we have no right to react in a negative
[2:16:21] way
[2:16:22] if we get our feelings hurt
[2:16:25] none
[2:16:32] i would remind you
[2:16:35] at the very very very beginning
[2:16:38] the scripture says in ezekiel
[2:16:41] it says thou art the anointed cherub
[2:16:43] that covereth and i have set thee so
[2:16:45] thou wasted upon the holy mountain of
[2:16:46] god that was walked up and down in the
[2:16:48] midst of the stones and fire that was
[2:16:49] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[2:16:51] thou was created
[2:16:52] till iniquity was found in thine heart
[2:16:56] now let's go back to the very very very
[2:16:58] very very beginning of when god didn't
[2:17:00] care
[2:17:02] do you think for a second that god
[2:17:03] didn't know he had didn't have iniquity
[2:17:05] in his heart
[2:17:07] he created him anyhow
[2:17:11] he's the creator he can choose what he
[2:17:13] does and does not create what he does
[2:17:15] and what he does not allow but at the
[2:17:17] very beginning this is the original sin
[2:17:20] this is the beginning of things going
[2:17:22] sideways
[2:17:24] and god didn't care enough to not create
[2:17:26] him
[2:17:26] even knowing that iniquity would be
[2:17:28] found in his heart
[2:17:30] why
[2:17:32] we stand in this day and in this age
[2:17:35] with the knowledge and the truth that no
[2:17:37] other age have had has things
[2:17:40] now
[2:17:41] we can look at our lives
[2:17:44] in the face of the open book and
[2:17:46] recognize
[2:17:48] god has permitted all of this
[2:17:50] in the scripture he has permitted all of
[2:17:52] this in my life
[2:17:55] because he cares about expressing
[2:17:56] himself
[2:17:58] getting the preeminence in my life
[2:18:00] and my redemption
[2:18:03] anything that comes along your way that
[2:18:05] you think god doesn't care about chances
[2:18:08] are he don't
[2:18:10] as much as he cares about using that
[2:18:12] circumstance to express himself
[2:18:16] to get the preeminence in your life
[2:18:18] and for your redemption
[2:18:23] you know why
[2:18:27] because god cares more about the person
[2:18:29] he's going to use you to redeem than he
[2:18:31] does about you
[2:18:36] that's the pattern saints why didn't he
[2:18:38] care about stephen because he cared
[2:18:40] about paul why didn't he care about paul
[2:18:43] because he cared about the churches why
[2:18:45] didn't he care about those churches
[2:18:46] those martyrs
[2:18:48] because he cared about the next church
[2:18:49] age why didn't he care about that church
[2:18:51] because he cared about the next one
[2:18:53] why doesn't he brother bran says we pray
[2:18:56] for comfort and peace and god in his
[2:18:58] wisdom gives us the best he has to offer
[2:19:01] why
[2:19:03] [Music]
[2:19:05] if we are the bride of jesus christ
[2:19:07] elected before the foundation of the
[2:19:09] world would he not care
[2:19:11] about us and our comfort and our peace
[2:19:17] it's because there's still somebody that
[2:19:18] needs redemption
[2:19:20] and if that means
[2:19:22] him bringing an inconvenience by your
[2:19:24] way a health issue by your way
[2:19:28] running your reputation
[2:19:32] if that means he has to do something
[2:19:34] that's uncomfortable in your life
[2:19:37] for you to express his attributes and
[2:19:40] his characteristics in order to attract
[2:19:44] one of his children
[2:19:46] for their redemption
[2:19:48] do not think for a second that he won't
[2:19:50] do it
[2:19:54] it's been the pattern
[2:19:56] that's why he didn't care about the one
[2:19:57] before is because he cared about the one
[2:19:59] after
[2:20:00] it's not that he didn't care about the
[2:20:01] one before saints but he cares about the
[2:20:04] one before
[2:20:06] and he'll get the stabilizers on their
[2:20:08] ship
[2:20:09] and then he'll let the waves come
[2:20:11] why
[2:20:12] to express himself let's stand together
[2:20:14] to express himself
[2:20:18] to get the preeminence
[2:20:21] and to facilitate redemption
[2:20:26] that is what god truly cares about and
[2:20:29] he will forsake everything else
[2:20:32] to accomplish that
[2:20:34] that is what he had in the back part of
[2:20:36] his mind
[2:20:38] now the challenge for us is whether we
[2:20:41] really believe that or not
[2:20:43] whether we're going to operate by that
[2:20:45] or not because it's easy well i won't
[2:20:47] say it's easy it's not been easy to
[2:20:49] preach it
[2:20:50] but i've preached it i've got it off my
[2:20:51] heart and i hope you've taken it in the
[2:20:53] way that i've tried to express it it's
[2:20:54] not a
[2:20:55] condemnation and it's certainly not
[2:20:57] trying to tell you that god does not
[2:20:58] care i've
[2:21:00] told you that god cares about every
[2:21:02] intimate detail of your life
[2:21:04] even things that you don't know about
[2:21:06] but now
[2:21:08] can we conduct ourselves by that
[2:21:11] revelation
[2:21:13] or when we walk out of the doors and on
[2:21:15] monday everything goes sideways
[2:21:18] are we going to start asking him why he
[2:21:20] don't care
[2:21:22] why he's forsaking us
[2:21:24] why he's allowed this
[2:21:30] if you'll look at every one of the
[2:21:31] church ages
[2:21:33] in the book of revelation
[2:21:34] there's a common theme
[2:21:36] and the common theme is god comes and he
[2:21:38] tells them i know
[2:21:44] he knows saints
[2:21:45] there is nothing in your life or my life
[2:21:48] that has snuck up on god
[2:21:50] if he knew everything in the church ages
[2:21:54] what chance do you think there is that
[2:21:56] he doesn't know what's going on in your
[2:21:59] life right now
[2:22:01] and he'll come and he will tell you the
[2:22:03] same thing that he told them
[2:22:06] i know
[2:22:09] i know
[2:22:10] what did he do
[2:22:12] every day and every night tens of
[2:22:16] thousands of times through the prophet's
[2:22:18] life
[2:22:19] people would come on the platform and he
[2:22:21] would tell them what's going on in their
[2:22:23] life
[2:22:26] why so that that person
[2:22:28] brother says the vision does not heal
[2:22:30] you it makes you aware of the presence
[2:22:32] of god
[2:22:33] what made them aware of the presence of
[2:22:34] god was the god speaking to them and
[2:22:37] telling them i know
[2:22:39] i know you have this i know you have
[2:22:41] that i know this i know this i know i
[2:22:44] know i know i know
[2:22:47] if god knows and we truly believe he
[2:22:50] knows
[2:22:53] it should humble us to put ourselves
[2:22:54] back in the position we belong in
[2:22:58] he knows
[2:23:00] he's my father
[2:23:01] i know where i came from i know where
[2:23:03] i'm going
[2:23:04] he'll deal with it appropriately
[2:23:07] that was the purpose of all those tens
[2:23:10] of thousands of examples not to mention
[2:23:13] all of the scriptures we have
[2:23:15] the purpose
[2:23:17] i'm here to tell you this morning saints
[2:23:19] you think you're going through some
[2:23:21] stuff and you may be in fact i would
[2:23:23] probably say you are and it's real and
[2:23:26] it has a real effect on you and i can
[2:23:28] tell you in the name of the lord he
[2:23:30] knows
[2:23:34] and it is not to destroy you it is to
[2:23:36] express himself it is to get the
[2:23:39] preeminence in your life
[2:23:41] and it is for your redemption or
[2:23:44] maybe even the redemption of somebody
[2:23:46] else
[2:23:48] one saw was worth ten thousand worlds
[2:23:52] if one soul was worth ten thousand
[2:23:54] worlds do you not think it's worth a
[2:23:55] little bit of our discomfort
[2:23:57] and trials and
[2:23:58] tribulations ten thousand worlds
[2:24:04] i think we can have a little bit of
[2:24:06] discomfort and trials to express an
[2:24:09] attribute of god for him to use for an
[2:24:11] eternal purpose
[2:24:13] without complaining about it
[2:24:16] brother branham says the decision the
[2:24:18] real decision is whether we'll conduct
[2:24:19] ourselves with joy amongst these trials
[2:24:22] he says that's how we show our love back
[2:24:24] to him his love is set
[2:24:26] it's undisputable it is unmovable it is
[2:24:28] not going to change he loved us brother
[2:24:30] brandon said he proved that he loved us
[2:24:32] because he brought his truth by your way
[2:24:34] did he bring his truth by your way
[2:24:36] if he has brought his truth by your way
[2:24:39] it is his proof you are elected and he
[2:24:41] loves you
[2:24:43] your response is only one thing to
[2:24:46] conduct yourself with joy or
[2:24:49] unpleasantly amongst the trials that he
[2:24:51] sees fit to bring by your way
[2:24:53] it's the only decision only option out
[2:24:55] there
[2:24:57] and i'll just remind you if god has an
[2:24:59] eternal purpose for the things you're
[2:25:01] going through
[2:25:02] he's not going to care about the
[2:25:04] temporal sufferings that you're going
[2:25:05] through and if he doesn't care about it
[2:25:08] why should we i say that we back up a
[2:25:11] step
[2:25:13] refocus
[2:25:14] on the eternal plan and purpose of god
[2:25:17] that has been delivered to us
[2:25:19] expressing christ
[2:25:21] having christ the free giving christ the
[2:25:23] preeminence
[2:25:25] and redemption for ourselves for our
[2:25:28] family and for this lost world that we
[2:25:29] live in
[2:25:31] and let everything else
[2:25:33] be brought subject to that
[2:25:36] and conduct ourselves with joy
[2:25:41] amongst those things
[2:25:47] two last comments brother branham said
[2:25:49] joseph was the type of perfection i've
[2:25:52] quoted this here before but i'll remind
[2:25:53] you brother branham said he was the type
[2:25:55] of perfection because joseph conducted
[2:25:57] himself as such when things went
[2:25:59] sideways
[2:26:00] he never said why
[2:26:02] he never complained
[2:26:04] he simply asked god please reveal to me
[2:26:07] what part of your foreknowledge you are
[2:26:09] revealing and expressing through me
[2:26:10] right now
[2:26:13] that is a whole nother level of saints
[2:26:17] i pray that god gets me
[2:26:18] there i know he's trying
[2:26:21] i pray that i can yield to that and come
[2:26:24] to that point because our atoms are not
[2:26:27] going to change until we do
[2:26:29] we have got to come to that point before
[2:26:32] our atoms are going to change the last
[2:26:34] comment that i want to make is this if
[2:26:35] you'll just play something softly please
[2:26:40] all things
[2:26:42] are working together for good to them
[2:26:45] that love the lord
[2:26:47] or they're not
[2:26:51] they either all are
[2:26:54] or they're not you say well you don't
[2:26:56] know i made the bad decision it was my
[2:26:57] fault i did this all things
[2:27:00] all things include your bad decisions
[2:27:03] and your mistakes
[2:27:06] all things
[2:27:08] self-inflicted
[2:27:10] or not self-inflicted
[2:27:13] all things
[2:27:15] work together
[2:27:16] for good
[2:27:17] to them that love the lord
[2:27:19] and are called according to his purpose
[2:27:21] it is either true or it's not true you
[2:27:24] need to answer that question before you
[2:27:25] walk out of them doors
[2:27:27] it either is or it isn't
[2:27:31] the last thing that i'll tell you
[2:27:33] is the lamb is either on the throne or
[2:27:36] he's not
[2:27:40] the lamb is either in control or he's
[2:27:43] not
[2:27:46] the lamb being in control does not
[2:27:48] deviate with your bad decision your
[2:27:52] wrong decision your bad mistake
[2:27:56] you may suffer for it
[2:27:58] not going to dispute that
[2:28:00] [Music]
[2:28:01] there may be scars from it it may have
[2:28:04] very bad effects for you and other
[2:28:06] people not disputing any of that but
[2:28:09] either it's working together for good
[2:28:11] for your purpose
[2:28:13] or another purpose that god has
[2:28:15] or it's not
[2:28:17] either the scripture is right or it's
[2:28:19] wrong either the lamb is still in
[2:28:21] control on the throne or he's
[2:28:24] not i say we leave this building by
[2:28:27] bringing those 200 million million
[2:28:30] demons
[2:28:31] subject to those stabilizers
[2:28:36] and if you will do that you will be
[2:28:38] settled
[2:28:39] you will be established you will be
[2:28:42] strengthened
[2:28:43] and you will be stable
[2:28:46] for what lays ahead
[2:28:49] because the waves are coming let's pray
[2:28:52] precious lord jesus
[2:28:54] lord we thank you for this time that
[2:28:56] you've given us lord
[2:28:58] lord we thank you for truth
[2:29:00] lord and i've been
[2:29:02] so lengthy lord i try every time not to
[2:29:04] be but
[2:29:06] it just happens lord i i apologize for
[2:29:09] not being more efficient lord
[2:29:12] father but i pray
[2:29:14] that you would take the words that's
[2:29:15] been spoken
[2:29:17] and i pray more importantly that you
[2:29:19] would take the spiritual principle that
[2:29:20] you wanted to express here this morning
[2:29:23] and that you would reveal it to your
[2:29:24] people
[2:29:26] the way you wanted it revealed i pray
[2:29:28] that they would be able to look past the
[2:29:29] vessel and look look past the delivery
[2:29:33] and see the spiritual principle and
[2:29:35] truth that lays there and lord i pray
[2:29:36] that you would take that and you would
[2:29:38] establish it in our hearts
[2:29:40] that we would move forward
[2:29:43] an example of perfection as you declared
[2:29:45] in joseph
[2:29:47] lord that we would move forward
[2:29:48] established
[2:29:50] settled
[2:29:51] strengthened and stable
[2:29:55] so that when the waves that are coming
[2:29:57] comes
[2:29:58] we're not tossed to and fro like
[2:30:00] children lord
[2:30:03] but we're rooted and
[2:30:05] grounded
[2:30:07] and we conduct ourselves
[2:30:09] the way that we should
[2:30:11] and we express ourselves
[2:30:14] the way that we should that we allow you
[2:30:16] to have the preeminence lord for we know
[2:30:18] that you are using us
[2:30:22] for the redemption of others
[2:30:25] to bring the truth
[2:30:26] that you died for
[2:30:28] to others
[2:30:30] lord
[2:30:31] what attraction would there be
[2:30:34] to the world
[2:30:36] as if the gospel we have causes us to
[2:30:39] fall apart the same way the world does
[2:30:42] every time something goes sideways
[2:30:44] lord may you come and supernaturally
[2:30:47] change us and allow us to conduct
[2:30:50] ourselves based on this revelation that
[2:30:52] you've given us
[2:30:53] we ask this in the name of the lord
[2:30:55] jesus christ praising you for all things
[2:30:58] and giving you the glory
[2:31:00] in jesus christ's name
[2:31:02] amen
[2:31:03] god bless you saints we're going to sing
[2:31:06] you'd be dismissed as you will i do
[2:31:08] apologize for being lengthy i did not
[2:31:10] mean to do that but
[2:31:13] i'll probably say it again next time i
[2:31:14] preach
[2:31:16] but i don't mean to be
[2:31:18] but i want to
[2:31:19] make sure you get what's on my heart
[2:31:22] i've delivered my heart i pray that
[2:31:23] you've seen
[2:31:25] what god is after
[2:31:27] and i pray that it's a blessing to you
[2:31:30] you just pray that god makes me more
[2:31:31] efficient
[2:31:32] god bless you saints let's sing together
[2:31:34] brother
[2:31:36] solomon concluded all his vanity
[2:31:44] now my heart believes that it is true
[2:31:52] it took me all this time to find reality
[2:32:01] all i ever really want is you
