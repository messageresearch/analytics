TRANSCRIPT
========================================
brother branham in church already says that's why we don't have a bunch of singing and a bunch of carrying on a bunch of testimonies he said maybe if you're in a special meeting and have an outstanding testimony somebody got saved or something share that but not just a bunch of testimonies and testimony meetings he said i see those things get out of hand and the people get so wore out their wore out before the word comes so what's brother branham doing in the church or is he saying don't testify don't sing he's saying keep the main thing in focus and that's the preaching of the word all the church order is about the word having preeminence that's why when brother branham preached church order he said this is this is to branham tabernacle at such and such a number 8th street and 10th street so he's saying this church order is to this church because brother branham teaches the sovereignty of the local church because you can't take brother branham's church order and make it fit every church you have to be the same kind of people in the same kind of location with the same physical structure i told you this with brothers in india i went to church one time to a church an official church a gathering of people an official church in malawi and they gathered every sunday under a mango tree i said how do you put a deacon at each door when you have church under a mango tree how do you keep the kids from running through the sanctuary between services don't run by the mango tree see what brother branham was showing when we got to watch him set his church in order at eighth and penn street he gave us an example he gave us a pattern he gave us something and we caught the purpose behind it now whether you have church in your home or you have church under a mango tree or you have church in a designated sanctuary you can take what the prophet brought and bring it in to accomplish the same purpose because your vision is higher than the rule because i've seen a whole lot of rule keeping that's nothing more than legalism and everybody feels good about the rule we kept all the rule but the dove wasn't welcome in that service and his feet didn't come down and rest so what was the point of keeping all the rules if the dove didn't come and the word didn't have preeminence we kept all the rules but we preached a false doctrine we didn't give the word preeminence so it's not about the rule it's about the concept it's about the principle about giving honor unto a prophet who was here to order the church to put the church back in order just like elijah put the put the worship back in order amen brother venom preaches over and over and over every church is sovereign and you cannot change that doctrine in the message
