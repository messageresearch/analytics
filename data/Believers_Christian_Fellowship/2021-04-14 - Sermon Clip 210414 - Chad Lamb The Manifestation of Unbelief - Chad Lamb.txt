TRANSCRIPT
========================================
christ-like ripeness is not only understanding a revelation of the mysteries of god but the revelation of the mysteries of god should produce something in our lives not an intellectual with an intellectualism so that we know something that's debatable we can debate and know something more than somebody else that's not the reason that he tore the seals off he meant so that he could show us the great mystery of god but he gave us the revelation of his great mystery because the revelation was to produce something and what was that revelation amen it was the rising of the sun amen and the rising of the sun was here to bake all the greenness all the immaturity out so that we can bake into the likeness of jesus christ as mature seed and so the revelation amen the predestination the revelation of our position with god coming from god returning to god being seated in heavenly places the election of the bride the calling out of the bride the bride at the end time all of these revelations should produce something in us and it shouldn't have us running around saying god where are you don't you recognize god can't you see what's happening don't you care there should be another revelation and say god i know you know me and i know you know where i'm at and i know you had a plan before the foundation of the world and i know i'm here as an instrument that you can work through and i'm trusting you in the middle of this trial because you're my heavenly father and you've deemed fit for me to walk this let me walk as an overcomer lord forgive me for forgive me for being fearful forgive me for my anxiety amen let me recognize your love from you lord let me see the seals torn away afresh right now in this trial he may not tell you the next step or how he's going to get you out of it or how deliverance will come but it doesn't matter if we can just go back and see what we were with him before the foundation of the world where we're going to what his purpose is right now then doesn't matter anymore what's happening will it be difficult yes will the flesh not like it of course not amen will the circumstances make you weary make you tired absolutely but those are things for us to overcome because he has already proved his love for us
