[0:00] You know, I told my
[0:04] wife, I said,
[0:06] "Honey," I said, "I want you to repeat
[0:08] after
[0:09] me." She said,
[0:13] "Okay." I She looked right at me, said,
[0:16] "Honey." She said,
[0:17] "Honey, as of today, as of
[0:21] today, all of my arsenal, all of my
[0:25] arsenal, I'mma destroy it. I'mma destroy
[0:28] it. That's okay. Do y'all know what that
[0:34] mean? Some of you
[0:37] don't. In the military term, arsenal
[0:40] mean stored up weapons.
[0:44] Military term stored up weapons.
[0:51] So what that means, husband and wives
[0:53] got arsenal.
[0:57] Oh, you like
[0:59] Oh, you
[1:00] do. When she if she offend you or do
[1:03] something that wasn't right, said, "I
[1:05] ain't going to say nothing
[1:07] now. I'll wait for later." You just
[1:11] stored Arsenal.
[1:18] Oh, I didn't like what he did, but I
[1:20] ain't going to say nothing.
[1:23] I'll wait later. You put it in your
[1:25] arsenal.
[1:29] And it's wrong. Yeah. Amen.
[1:33] Some of you got bazookas, dynamite,
[1:35] grenades, and everything in your ar
[1:40] and you just waiting for the argument to
[1:42] come up. Which one going to be the right
[1:44] one to pick?
[1:47] What you think happening when you and
[1:48] your wife have a disagreement and you
[1:51] trying to explain something and the
[1:52] other one be going like, "Mhm." Yeah.
[1:55] Mhm. They're not listening to you.
[1:58] They're just while you're saying that,
[2:01] they're looking in their arsenal which
[2:03] one they going to use to come back at
[2:06] you.
[2:07] You know that's wrong. Yeah.
[2:10] You're laughing, but it's wrong.
[2:15] Got to lay it down. Amen.
[2:18] The best way to kill that arsenal is
[2:21] don't let stuff build up.
[2:25] Hello. Don't let it build it up.
[2:29] But there is a
[2:31] wisdom to that side.
[2:35] Sometimes you can discern that didn't
[2:37] really mean
[2:38] that. But that has to be addressed. I'll
[2:42] just wait for later to address it
[2:44] because right now ain't it ain't going
[2:46] to happen. That's not putting in the
[2:48] arsenal for an attack, but waiting for
[2:51] the right time to deal with the
[2:54] situation.
[2:56] But when you just storing them all up,
[2:58] oh, I'll wait. I know he going to come
[2:59] back. He going to say something or
[3:02] she That's wrong. Amen.
[3:07] Praise the Lord.
