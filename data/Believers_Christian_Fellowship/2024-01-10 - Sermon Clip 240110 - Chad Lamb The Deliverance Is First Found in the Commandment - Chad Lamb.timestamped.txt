[0:00] there's so many times that we get into
[0:02] problems in our families we get into uh
[0:04] trials let's say we get into a marital
[0:06] situation where there's marital strife
[0:08] and and then all of a sudden we need
[0:09] deliverance we cry out to God save our
[0:11] marriage save our Deliver Us help us and
[0:14] we go to the pastor we go to counsel we
[0:16] do whatever we can we get everybody
[0:19] praying that's
[0:21] wonderful but the Deliverance was
[0:23] already in the Commandment yeah amen if
[0:26] you go back to Ephesians and just take
[0:28] what Paul the Apostle said right
[0:30] husbands love your wives as Christ loved
[0:33] the
[0:37] church wives see that you reverence your
[0:41] husbands no matter what kind of trouble
[0:43] you find yourself in and no matter what
[0:45] kind of problem comes your way if we'll
[0:47] just work it back to the word I
[0:49] guarantee there's a breakdown in that
[0:51] Simplicity of that Commandment that the
[0:53] Apostle Paul we broke it down somewhere
[0:56] either that man did not love his wife
[0:58] the way Christ loves the church or that
[1:00] wife was not reverencing her husband and
[1:02] it brought a breakdown in the family and
[1:04] we we could call it all kinds of things
[1:05] we stress because of work and the
[1:07] finances are this and the kids are that
[1:09] no the reality is somewhere we stopped
[1:11] obeying the word and when we left the
[1:13] word amen we left the protection of the
[1:16] word and now we got all kinds of tension
[1:18] and strife when what we need to do is
[1:20] repent and come back to the word and God
[1:22] will bless his
[1:24] word
[1:26] amen amen we we we come to the stage
[1:29] where we have teenagers and and the
[1:31] whole world expects that teenagers are
[1:33] problems they're all problems listen I
[1:35] have raised five teenagers and they've
[1:37] been no problem
[1:39] whatsoever and it's not because I'm
[1:43] smart has nothing to do with that but I
[1:46] absolutely believe the word of God that
[1:48] there's a promise in that word amen and
[1:50] if I do what the scriptures tell me to
[1:52] do in discipline and requiring obedience
[1:54] keeping them in the word keeping the
[1:56] atmosphere in my home I believe with all
[1:58] my heart that God will keep the devour
[2:00] away from my door I believe with all my
[2:02] heart amen you know I'm speaking in
[2:05] generalities I know that bad things can
[2:07] happen and difficult situations I don't
[2:08] want anybody feel condemned but the
[2:10] reality is God has made us promises and
[2:13] if we stay behind the word it has to
[2:15] work friends it's got to work and we can
[2:18] say what do I do about my rebellious
[2:20] child they won't listen to me they won't
[2:22] do anything I say they won't the problem
[2:25] was not 16 17 the problem started at 12
[2:29] months 18 18 months when you didn't do
[2:31] what the Bible said to train a child in
[2:33] the way should go and when he's older
[2:35] he'll not
[2:37] depart brother R said it's not child
[2:39] delinquency it's parent
[2:41] delinquency is the problem so you can
[2:44] see it's the simple obedience to the
[2:47] word of God and letting the word shape
[2:49] our lives that is protecting us from so
[2:52] much trouble amen I mean we can just
[2:54] look around we are a spared
[2:58] people I don't know I mean and most of
[3:01] you have jobs have families have
[3:05] associations outside the framework of
[3:07] the
[3:08] church and you see the catastrophe that
[3:11] are striking lives
[3:13] everywhere not just rebellious children
[3:16] now children addicted to
[3:18] drugs at young age promiscuity amen all
[3:22] kinds of horrible things that people are
[3:24] dealing with and we don't have to deal
[3:25] with it why don't we have to deal with
[3:27] it he man was it cuz we're a better
[3:29] people cuz we're smarter cuz we're wiser
[3:31] because we got our ducks in a row it has
[3:33] nothing to do with that this is simply a
[3:35] product of obedience to the word of God
[3:37] we have come to the word we have
[3:39] practiced the word and the word has
[3:41] produced the results that he promised it
[3:43] would be produce it's not a mystery it's
[3:46] a
[3:48] reality
