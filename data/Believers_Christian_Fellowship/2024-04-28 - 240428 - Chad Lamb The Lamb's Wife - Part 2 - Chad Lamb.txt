then the weekend after that is special meetings with Alistar Francis for uh Friday Saturday and Sunday so be prepared to flip your calendar from May to June real fast cuz may is going to breeze on by but uh there's a lot happening and I'm excited about it all and so I just wanted to uh keep reminding us of those things so we don't lose track of those and ask you to be in prayer for all of that and so we look forward to iten let's all stand and uh let's turn to the book of Ephesians together I want to welcome welome all our visitors and I see sister Carolyn Kai's parents back there God bless you it's good to have you both with us again amen and anybody else who visiting God bless you let's look at Ephesians chapter 5 Ephesians chapter 5 verse 30 for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church man God bless you may you may have your seats may the Lord bless us as we look into his word and may he give us eyes of understanding amen amen I'm going to continue on with the thought I had from a little while ago on the Lamb's wife this will be the Lamb's Wife Part Two it's quite a a bit of a different direction than we were in before but these things have been on my heart actually for several months and I've just been waiting for God to kind of give the right inspiration where I felt comfortable preaching on it and so God started dealing with me a lot this week and and so I want to just do a quick review uh of last time and we went to the uh quote on choosing of a bride it says again the kind of woman that a man would choose will reflect his Ambitions and his character if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character and what he ties himself to shows truly what's in him a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for wife it shows what's down in him no matter what he says outside watch what he married so we see that works in the natural but also that's working spiritually because God is going to choose a bride that's going to reflect his very nature amen and many of us look at that and say well why would he choose me and how could he choose me I've got all these bad characteristics but he's not choosing you based off your genetics necessarily he's choosing you based off a seed that's down inside and he knows the potential that's laying inside each one of us and the potential is there to reflect his very life because it is his life that's trapped inside further down in the same message he said but you know you have to plan look Pray when you're choosing for we see by this the Word of Promise she the bride that a man would choose is going to reflect his character it reflects what's in him a little further down he says now then when we change back now for a moment to the spiritual side when you see a church that's in the world acts like the world participates in the world partaking of the world counting God's Commandments as if they never had wrote them then you can just imagine Christ ain't going to take a bride like that could you imagine taking the modern church today for a bride not my Lord uh I could hardly see that no remember now a man and his wife are one and so that's what we want to look at that's what we started looking at last time is is is Christ and his bride are one and if Christ is a lamb he can only marry a lamb he couldn't marry anything else a lamb must marry a lamb so this bride must become a lamb praise God let's turn to Romans chapter 8 together Romans chapter 8 in verse 29 for whom he did for for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren so God by predestination knew the bride that he would choose and he's predestinated us amen he's predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ and he's also predestinated us to be conformed to His Image praise God how many are you thankful that he decided before the foundation of the world that we would be conformed to his image and that he predestinated us unto adoption because if it was left to us there's no way we would ever have made it we couldn't have made it we were doomed to fail from the from our birth cuz our birth came wrong we were wrong with the wrong nature with the wrong desires Born In the Flesh amen we were in enmity with God our minds were alienated from the things of God we had a darken mind amen we come hating the things of God but God had a seed planted down inside of us and he knew how to bring the light in the right seed season to Quicken that seed because there's where for predestination is that's what his for knowledge was knowing where that seed would land and the potentials that are in that seed and he knew what seed we had for what day we lived in so we may feel totally inadequate to face the challenges of the day but the adequacy is not in your mind the adequacy is not in your willpower the adequacy is in the seed that lays down inside of you because he knew what seed would come forth in what hour so we got to quit we got to quit looking at at ourselves and saying I can't that that that's true absolutely we can't amen but With God all things are possible he said I am the vine you are the branches if you IDE in me amen so he's going to bear fruit from what because we're connected to the vine the Vine's bringing life through the branches and bearing the fruit he's not asking the branches to do it all on their own he's only asking the branches to stay connected to the vine praise God amen so now all the potential lays in the seat and he's going to have a wife and that wife is going to come to manifestation in the end time and she is coming into manifestation amen she's already standing on her feet she's maturing into what into the very image of the Lamb it'll be Mr and Mrs lamb praise God Amen let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 this is where I'm going to take a little turn and a little deviation so that that is our review review's over amen Now we move forward and like I said I'm going to if if you'll just bear with me it's Sunday morning we got a little bit of time and I don't say that to strike fear and Terror into everyone's heart but I want us to relax cuz I'm going to go around the cowshed so if you'll let me go around the cowshed to get to my point let's just stay on the journey together and let's enjoy it together amen I think it's a little Cal shed so I think we'll be okay Ecclesiastes 3 verse 1 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time uh and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to swow a time to keep silent and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace boy that's an interesting scripture to read right now when we're talking about the Lamb's wife but if you'll let me go around the cowshed we'll find out that this applies exactly to the thought and the desire I have to share what's on my heart we know that in Ecclesiastes the preacher who is Solomon is writing from the from the wisdom from the things he's seen and he recognizes there's a time there's an appropriate time for different action we don't always have the same action or the same reaction in every situation or in every time but but there's a time there's a Time to to plant there's a time to pluck up there's a time to Ren there's a time to sew amen there's a Time For Peace there's a time for war and and there's times amen for different kinds of action and different kinds of reaction and so we want to look at that a little bit now and I'm going to to begin speaking about the four anointings amen that were over the church ages and and we're going to talk about that uh for just a little bit of time now in the fifth sea brother B says now notice as the Antichrist went forth on his Beast of ministry God sent forth a beast to combat it now watch then every time the Beast rode on his horse the Antichrist rode on his horse on his Beast to announce his ministry God sent his Beast also in his own Mass to announce his combat to it now the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises a standard against it and so when the enemy went out as an antichrist God sent a certain type of power out to meet him and so down through the church ages as the enemy would try one tactic God would have a power or an anointing that would come over the church amen that would combat that tactic of the enemy amen but there's a time and a season for everything so when the enemy would switch his horses and move his tactic a little further God would bring another anointing or another power to the church amen to comat that anointing and this combat was going down amen and and you couldn't stay amen just in the previous anointing or you wouldn't have the power to overcome amen this new challenge to the church but you must move with the the anointing with the with the power that God is sending in its season in its time and in that time amen you would have overcoming power that was supplied by the Holy Ghost as God sent a power to combat the power of the devil amen so there was a season in a time for all of these things to manifest when when when we go uh in the fifth seal again I'm going to read another quote out of the fifth seal he said but when we get to the fifth seal there's no Beast now just notice and when he opened the F seal I saw under the altar right quick there's no beast and Beast represents power we know that there's no living creature now one of those creatures we find out in studying in the Revelation in the church is one of them was a lion the other one was an ox the other one was a man the other one was an eagle we find out in the church ages that those four beasts meaning four powers was gathered around the Acts of the Apostles just the way the Tabernacle in the wilderness so now he's going all the way back and he's starting to show us these four powers that were with the church amen were the same four powers amen that were gathered around the Tabernacle in the wilderness amen and they were gathered around the book of Acts so we're going to talk about that you understand it cuz I won't I won't take time to go into it we draw it out here and showed just exactly so we're going to do do the same we're going to take a look at those things he's referring to but I want you to catch this statement he makes they were watching over this the lamb and the word to perform the word so what were they watching over they were brother M called them Throne guards they were guards around the Throne of God and these four cherubs these four anointings or these four beasts or Powers were always around the Throne of God Amen and what they were doing he says here he said they were watching over the lamb and the word to perform the word just as they did the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy place in the wilderness and so forth now we even positionally showed by the tribal colors of Israel how many heard the seven Church ages I guess most have notied that even the nature of the Beast was exactly a tribal emblem which the 12 tribes set for are three tribes on each side and the four Beast set and watch these tribes from all four ways and when we went and got the gospels and showed exactly when you enter into the ark they was a guarding the AR Arc the Covenant and we find out that the Covenant of the new church its representation on Earth was the Holy Spirit the blood had sent back to us the Holy Ghost and the four beasts represented the 12 tribes of Israel as it watched and find their natures and taken the same nature and bring it to each one of these four gospels exactly was exactly the same one talked to the lion the other the ox the four gospels there it is the four gospels is the protection of the holy spirit so here he's talking about these four powers of these four anointings again and he's referring to them to the four gospels watching over the Holy Ghost so I want us to turn if we could together to Revelation chap 4 in in Revelation CH 4 we see in in chapter 4 that John was caught up into heaven through an open door he sees one sitting on the throne and he sees the whole he sees the whole scene of the throne room and in verse six he said and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like under Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third Beast had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle and the fourth Beast and the four four Beast e had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come so we see these these four beasts are around the throne and this is what brother B's referring to they're always around the throne amen we find these four beasts are called cherubims and we find them in Ezekiel Ezekiel chap 1 we're not going to turn there but you can jot it down Ezekiel 1:6 6 to 10 refers to him and Ezekiel 10: 14- 15 so we also know that cherubs were placed amen at Eden when man was cast out of Eden the cheram were placed there with a flaming sword he placed cheram amen there he didn't say how many he placed he just placed them there with a flaming sword to keep the way of the tree of life and so they were keeping or guarding or protecting the way of the tree of life so once again brother B told us that that there was a throne in Eden and in that Throne Amen in Eden was where they would come to worship and that's why the the boys Cain and Abel came to the Eastern Gate of Eden because there was a throne back there but they couldn't get back there because of sin but there was cherubims there to prevent them from getting back to the tree of life but they were keeping the way of the tree of life so that the way of the Tree of Life wouldn't be lost who was guarding it who was keeping it it was cherubims and Heaven who's around the throne these four chams and so and he refers to it to the gospel in the books of Acts and he throws it all the way back to the Tabernacle in the wilderness so we're going to draw that out but I just want to read one more quote here in The Sixth Seal he says and father today we stand here by your grace and it's not because that it's a special people but it's because just like the day of the lion or the ox or the man it's the eagle time so he's telling us what time what a anointing is for our age it's the eagle anointing it's the eagle time it's the anointing of the hour it's it's the time that we're living in it's the working of the holy spirit for this particular time to prove that Jesus is not dead that the things that he said that he would do just before evening lights went out so we find that brother Benham says now this this Eagle time these four beasts now the anointing for the hour is the eagle anointing it's Eagle time the anointing for this hour and he says it's the working of the holy spirit amen so it's the Holy Spirit working in a specific way in each age amen so I'm I'm going to brother Franco if you could turn on the Whiteboard for me I'm going to uh draw this out and once I draw this out then I'm going to try my best to tie this together and get back to the Lamb's wife what does this have to do with the Lamb's wife I hope you're asking yourself that question because when I started studying this I started asking myself the question how am I going to get this back full circle back around so when we when we look here at Revelation uh chapter 4 verse 6 it says round about The Throne were the four beasts so they're surrounding the throne when you go over to chapter 6 it says chap CH 6:1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the beasts saying come and see verse three and when he opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see uh we go go on down uh verse 6 and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the I'm sorry not not that one verse 5 and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and verse 7 and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast came come and see so as we go through the opening of the seals amen it shows that these anointings amen have to do with the seals and have to do with the church ages and after each seal was open they're saying come and see for the first four seals so the these anointings are really important so let me see if I can just draw this out so when we when we have the throne in heaven we have a throne in heaven and round about The Throne we have the lion the oxx the man and the eagle these are the cherubim they're in heaven they're they're worshiping God constantly and and these are four anointings but we know that these are the four anointings are the four ways in which the Holy Ghost is working through the church ages so don't separate it from the Holy Ghost amen this is going to this is something that I I hope I can explain we we'll get to it in a minute so this is the picture in heaven and I drew them this way for a certain reason you'll find out as we go on because when Moses led the children out of Egypt there was a tabernacle on Earth and on Earth we had a Tabernacle in the wilderness and in the Tabernacle was a holy of holies and in the holy of holies was the Ark of the Covenant and in the Ark of the Covenant was the hidden Mana amen and and and there also was the two tables of stone so there was the word and in there was the word and there was the the bread of life if I could say it that way and this was God's Throne on Earth and he he had camped around he had Specific Instructions on the way the nation of Israel would Camp around this he would have so many tribes three tribes on the south three tribes on the north three tribes on the East three tribes on the west and they always had to camp in a specific order and there was a leading tribe on each side and that leading tribe on each side each had a banner amen and that Banner each had a representation that each had a representation of an animal and so on this side uh was Judah Judah camped on this side and judah's emblem was the lion over here was Ephraim I got to make sure I spell Ephraim right Ephraim and and his emblem was an ox over here we had Dan on the North side and Dan was an eagle and over here was Reuben and Reuben was a man and so when God placed the children of Israel in their tribal order around his throne around his throne on Earth you had the lion ox man and Eagle cuz as they would set their camp and put their standard up they would have this emblem on the standard so God was reflecting on Earth what was in heaven and you could not get to God's Throne unless you came through these anointings am remember they were watching over the word watching over the lamb and the word to perform the word amen so they had to keep the way what were they doing on Earth they were keeping the way Amen to life amen because God was back there the shikina glory of God was back behind the veil he said I will meet you back here the shakina glory will come between the wings of the cheram Over The Mercy Seat and so God had a mercy seat he had a throne he had a place on Earth to meet them and these four anointings were keeping the way to life because in here in here was the word which is the Covenant he gave Moses which was two tables of stone and in here was the hidden Mana which was bread and this hided Mana never spoiled in the presence of God so it is symbolic of the bread of life that's what's on the throne that's what need these anointings are guarding and they're keeping the word amen because nobody could get to that Throne unless they pass through this anointing so they were keeping away everything that would defile everything that was corrupt everything that wasn't coming the word way they would keep it away but every trueborn Israelite that was coming according to God's way amen they kept the path open they kept the way to come to meet God so let's go back to this one so when we when we go to the throne in heaven when they look at the throne in heaven when John sees it he sees one sitting on the throne amen and we know on the throne in the hand of him is a book and this is The Book of Life so what are they guarding they're guarding the word they're guarding life they're they're around the Throne of God it has to do with life it has to do with the lamb because the lamb sits on this Throne it has to do with with eternal life so let's keep going now brother bam tells us that there's a book of Acts and this is the Holy Ghost dispensation when Christ said I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you the person of Life himself will come to to the believer but he said surrounding this brother B said were the gospels and it was Matthew Mark Luke and John and brother tells us even the natures of the Gospel the natur of the Gospel matches these anointing there's an anointing on each gospel and over Matthew you have a lion anointing because the lineages start off showing us this is the lineage of the king the king is now coming amen Mark is the sacrifice it's the ox Luke was written by a physician it's the wisdom and cunning of a man and John is the eagle anointing because John starts off where the others start off amen there was a man in the wilderness or a lineage and John starts off in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God it's an eagle anointing amen so you see these same Powers these anointings of the Holy Ghost over these Gospels protecting the way to what this is also a throne and this is also life eternal life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so these things have to do with life they have to do with eternal life I I want to draw if I can one more I got I got so much stuff now remember we're going around the cowshed so just let's go around around the cou and let's grab all these pieces and see if God can put them together for us when when Christ descended on high he sent gifts to man and those gifts were for the perfecting of the church until we all come into the unity of the faith so then God sent a fful Ministry and in that fful Ministry he said we have Apostles I'm sorry I've got to erase this oh man I got to figure out how to do this it worked I am so you know if brother Simon was here he would already be doing amazing things on this I'm thrilled because I can erase a messed up Mark God help us Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers brother Bon would even go to explain to us that these five full Ministries fall under these Beast anointings so the the Apostle is the lion anointing they are they have the authority like a lion and they're bold these were the apostles who wrote the New Testament who started the New Testament Church who went out and so that's the anointing of the Apostles in in the the prophet anointing and the Evangelist anointing both fall under the ego according to brother banam and this is Vision they have clear perspective even the Evangelist brother B says flies high and operates under this moving of the eagle anointing because they can move as they see spirits in the congregation and begin to address stuff and so the Evangelist moves under the eagle anointing said the Pastor is the ox which is labor and sacrifice and the teacher moves under the man anointing which is Godly wisdom and understanding so even even the the anointings of the Holy Ghost that are upon the ministry gifts match these four anointings and everything has a season and a time and a place there's a time for the Evangelist and a time for the Apostle there's a time for the pastor there's a time for the teacher amen remember everything has a time and has a place everything has a position and these four anointings don't forget are the anointings of the Holy Ghost working in a certain specific way in an age or in a person now we look at these anointings now over the church ages so we had in the first church under the apostles it was the anointing of the lion but then in the Dark Ages we under the anointing of the ox then in the Reformation we were under the anointing of man and now in the end time it's the eagle the prophetic so even over the church ages there's these four anointings which is the anointing of the Holy Ghost specific to a specific purpose all right are we all on the same page we dropped a bunch of nuggets there listen I'm not going to go deep into this this is not about a bunch of uh minutia I just wanted you to see these anointings were all they've been here the whole time amen and what they're always doing is watching over the lamb and the word to perform the word and keep the way to life they've always been doing the same thing they're doing the same thing in heaven they're doing the same thing on earth they were doing the same thing in Israel they were doing the same thing in the gospels they're doing the same thing in the anointings over the fivefold ministry the fivefold ministry is here Amen to watch over the lamb and the word to perform the word and to keep the way to life praise God to keep everything that defiles away amen but to keep the path open for everybody that wants to come as a true born Christian Son of God Amen so it's the same thing over and over and over and God he doesn't change the anointings he keeps using the same anointings over and over and over again amen because these are you could say these are four uh H I hate to say it this way but just bear with me these are four aspects of the Holy Ghost are four faces of the Holy Ghost amen but then brother Benham comes in in in uh the revelation of Jesus Christ out of the church age book and he says ever since then people have failed to realize that there is just one God with three offices or manifestations they know there is one God according to scripture but they try to make it the Fantastic theory that God is like a bunch of grapes three persons with some same definity shared equally by all but it plainly says here in Revelation that Jesus is that which is that which was that which is to come he is the alpha the Omega which means the he is a to z or all of it he is everything the almighty he is the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the bright and Morning Star the righteous Branch the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost he is God almighty God one God so we find out it's all God Amen when you look in heaven amen God is sitting on his throne in heaven and around before him is seven spirits around him is these four beasts then there's 24 elders and and then you have a lamb and you have all of these things and a mighty Angel but really it all came out of him amen it's all him and Christ is God and everything is in him he's the A to Z he's the all of it so what are these four anointings they're the four anointings of the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it's Christ returning to his church it's the it's the power and spirit of Christ working in certain ways through certain ages or through certain Ministry gifts because the fivefold Ministry it's not their own Ministry it's the ministry of Christ we don't want individual Ministry we want the ministry of Christ but Christ sent gifts himself to the church and now he's working through a fivefold Ministry to feed his Sheep amen but it's the ministry of Christ but the ministry of Christ is coming in five different facets to to work in different ways in the church under four of his anointings okay so that means now we're coming back to the lamb to the lamb that means in the lamb is a lion ox man and Eagle you think that's fair to say in the lamb is the lion ox man and Eagle When Jesus Christ was here on Earth Amen in the son of man Ministry 2,000 years ago amen he displayed all four of the those anointings but yet he was the Lamb of God come to take away the sins of the world when he was introduced by John the Baptist John the Baptist didn't introduce him as liono man and Eagle he introduced him as the Lamb of God and he always was the Lamb of God his Earthly Journey was as the Lamb of God but as the Lamb of God Amen he exhibited the full nature of God and the full attributes of God and the full attributes of the power of the Holy Ghost was manifest in him so you can look in Jesus as life and you can see lion ox man an eagle amen can we just turn to some scriptures together and look at that let's go to John Chapter 2 and there's a reason I'm going through this and we'll just let the cat out of the bag because if we don't look at the word and whole we get such a simplistic idea of things and we say that Jesus Christ is this way amen he's the lamb he's this way so we must be this way but when Jesus was here he was very dynamic in his personality and in his ministry and he operated many different ways in different circumstances and God the nature of God now in one man cannot come down and be simplistic to the way that he was just this one facet or this one this one way that I want Jesus to be no he's the full gamut all wrapped up in the one he was the fullness of the godhead bodily poured into one vessel and he was manifesting all the power all the manifestation all the characteristics so we don't want to narrow our vision down but we want to see the lamb and all of his glory and all of his power and John 2:3 says and the Jews Passover was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and Changers of money sitting and when he had made a scorge of small Co cords he drove them out of the temple and the sheep and The Oxen and poured out the Changers money and overthrew the tables and said unto them old does take these things hence uh make not my father's house a house of merchandise now I'm going to read this again I'm going to read just one verse and I want you to think of a lamb when he had made a scorge that's a little whip of small cords he drove them out of the temple and the sheep and The Oxen and poured out the Changers money and overthrew the tables are you thinking lamb no way or are you thinking lion are you thinking the king are you thinking the authority that came into the temple to purge it and clean it but was he still the lamb yes he was still the lamb he was the Lamb of God he was he was the the Son of God Amen he was here in a son of man Ministry but inside of him was was also a lion he was a lion of the tribe of Judah amen let's go to John 19 John 19 verse 16 then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucify ified and they took Jesus and led him away and he bearing his cross went forth into a place that's called the place of the skull which is called in Hebrew galtha where they crucified him and two other with him on either side one and Jesus in the midst he was the lamb the sacrificial lamb he was under the anointing of the ox a beast of burden and of sacrifice let's go to Luke chapter 20 Luke Chapter 20 Luke 20 verse 21 and they asked him saying Master we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly neither accept thou the person of any but teach us the way of God truly is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar or no but he perceiving their craftiness and said unto them why tempt you me show me a penny whose image and subscription hath it they answered and said Caesars and he said unto them render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesars and unto God the things which be gods and they could not take hold of his words before the people and they marveled at his answer and held their peace that's the cunning of a man amen he's under the man anointing there now let's go back to John chapter 1 John 1:47 Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith of him behold an Israelite indeed indeed in whom is no guile Nathaniel said unto him whence knowest thou me Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee I saw thee he's under the eagle anointing the prophetic anointing and we know that he was the great prophet that Moses was speaking to when that Prophet comes a prophet like unto me so Jesus was under the the lion anointing the ox anointing the man anointing and the eagle anointing but the whole time he was a lamb so in the lamb are also these four Powers Yeah amen amen why because they're they're part of the Holy Ghost they're part of the power of God they're part of the demonstration of God and he was the fullness of the godhead bodily we got many other examples in Jesus's Ministry he he says the we we've got him at the woman at the well Discerning the woman's life and she says I perceive that you're a prophet because he says what he says go fetch your husband she says I have none he says what you've said is right because you've had five and the one you have now is not your own and she say I perceive you to be a prophet amen what is that that's an eagle but he's Still the Lamb amen when they brought the woman caught in adultery amen they tried tempt him and trapped him with this woman in adultery and quoting Moses's law and what does he do he totally unravels their whole plan by writing something in the sand amen he writes something he stands he tells them that you are the without sin cast the first stone he goes back to writing in the sand whatever he's doing I don't know but he's absolutely unraveling their plan they had a tight plan to get him trapped in this thing amen and and when he when he rose amen he rose and he acted like he was surprised he said woman where are thine accusers is there no one to accuse you he said none my Lord he said neither do I accuse you go and S no more what was he it was the cunningness of a man dealing with them and he would deal with them out of the scriptures and they would say Amen what about the resurrection of the dead he says don't you know the word amen that he's the he's the God he's the he's the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he's not the god of the dead but he's God of the living and he kept unraveling until they got to the place where they would ask him no more questions praise God he discerned their thoughts he healed their sick in John chapter 8 he looked at the Pharisees and he said you're of your father the devil now remember he's a lamb see the reason I'm saying this is when we think lamb in Lamb nature amen we start thinking just Meek and just humble But realize in the lamb was these four anointings Amen in the Holy Ghost are these four Expressions perfect amen even Jesus was acting the part of a pastor he acted the part of an evangelist he acted the part of a prophet he acted the part of a pastor he acted the part of a teacher why because it was all in him he he in Matthew 15 he says Jesus called us disciples and them said I have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now 3 days having nothing to eat and I will not send them away fasting L they faint in the way he he cared for the people wanted to make sure they had something to eat so he worked a miracle in the breaking of Loaves and Fishes why because he had compassion on the people then on the Pharisees he called them Devils amen some were blatant Sinners some were some some were hidden Sinners and he exposed exposed their sin and called them Whited seers with hidden sin some had open sin and he openly forgave them of their sin amen why he he is the fullness of God and the fullness of God is not this simplistic little narrow Vision the fullness of God has all these manifestations amen let's go to Proverbs 26 I hope and pray that these meanderings and ramblings come together in your heart to start to paint a picture Proverbs 26 before I read this just want to say you know how brother Benham would say that the the the the difficult that the Pharisees and some of the religious leaders had in the day Jesus was there is that sometimes he was so rough with them and and he was unpredictable they couldn't control him and brother R even used the analogy they would say now this man he tears up the temple he tears on the religion he speaks evil of your preachers amen but but what about your kind old priest I mean he fed you when you were poor and he took care of dad when he was out of work and when you were sick he gave you money and they start trying to show that the nature of Jesus Christ was the wrong kind of nature amen praise God maybe it's just a whole lot more complex than our simple minds want to frame it right we want to make him this or we want to make him that but maybe the fullness of the godhead has the full expression of God sometimes God's a lion and sometimes God's an ox and sometimes God's an eagle amen sometimes God's a man yes am amen what are these anointings doing watching over the lamb and the word to keep the word what are they doing they're keeping the way of life keeping the path to life and so maybe it's not so simple the question is when should you be a lion and when should you be an ox and then when should you be a man and then when should I thought I was supposed to be a lamb you are supposed to be a lamb be the lamb like he was the lamb yeah amen but how now how am I supposed to act in every situation let's go to Proverbs 26 now verse 4 Proverbs 26:4 answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou also be like unto him verse five answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise as his own conceit so am I supposed to answer a fool or not answer a fool let's read it again answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou be like unto him answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own conceit I'm confused do I answer a fool in his folly or do I not answer a fool in his folly maybe there's a time to answer and a time not to answer maybe in everything there's a time in a season maybe there's a time to speak and maybe there's a time to refrain from speaking maybe there's a time to love and there's a time to hate maybe there's a time of war and a time of Peace maybe there's a time for everything amen and maybe there's an anointing of the Holy Ghost for every need yeah when it's time to speak when it's time to answer questions when it's time to refrain from answering maybe there's a holy ghost anointing that can match the need for the me the moment that we're in amen you can say you know H you can say but we're under the eagle anointing absolutely we're under the eagle anointing but even under the eagle anointing the the great prophet Eagle of our day under the eagle anointing sometimes took the ox anointing remember when he was standing in the wings of a meeting ready to go out on the platform and there's somebody out there telling a lie about he couldn't make it his brother's sick and and he's standing out there amen the prophet should have exposed the a but the ox suffered suffered the reproach because he didn't want to hurt that man's Ministry amen but then when they got challenged in Chicago by all those ministers who were challenging on his teaching of serpent seed and godhead and brother benam was really nice to him but he says you know now any of you who've got question just won't you take your Bibles and come stand alongside of me and let's talk and later when he got back to his church he says he said nobody come he said they were smarter than I thought they were sometimes he would take the challenge sometimes he would pass sometimes he would expose what was going on in somebody's life sometimes he wouldn't say a word when Gordon Lindsay came to give him documents that would take away his tent and cause him to lose his magazine he signed the documents knowing exactly what was happened there was a brother with him he told him before Gordon Lindsay got there all that was happening he signed the documents let him go as he was walking out the door he said wait a minute brother Lindsay can you imagine that man's heart heart it probably hit the floor and bounc back he says won't you come preach for us sometime sometimes he would hide someone's sin sometimes he'd expose somebody's sin times he would rant and sometimes he would smooth over praise God Amen brother B says in the Masterpiece said notice here the life that was in the husk in the stalk and the tossel and the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stalk went one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself if the fullness of the Holy Ghost is returned then all the power and anointings of the Holy Ghost is here am Amen brother bam tells us after he got done preaching the seals and the Revelation series he's telling us that God now has a throne and that Throne is in the heart of man he said that Throne came into the heart of man on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came into the human heart now there's a throne and there's Throne guards around the throne the four gospels amen are leading the way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost right the four anointings over the fivefold ministry are leading people to the baptism of holy ghost in Union with Christ what are they doing these four anointings are ushering people into the presence of the Tree of Life the four gospels and the four anointings amen and the four anointings of where the Tre other Church ages they were all doing something they were all empowering the church to overcome a a discrepancy that was coming in their day or Antichrist Spirit there was another anointing that would come in every age to combat that anointing and the whole time what they were doing they were bringing the church out of the Dark Ages and bringing them back to where the Holy Ghost was once again enthroned in the heart of his church what were they doing they were keeping the way of the tree of life and they were ushering where once those choms and at the Gate of Eden were were keeping them from the tree of life amen now they're ushering man back into the tree of life and these anointings over the church ages and anointings over the fivefold ministry and the anointings of the Holy Ghost and the anointings over the gospel are trying to bring us back into Union with God Amen and when we come back into Union with God we come back to a marriage of the lamb in order to be married to the lamb you have to be a lamb and these anointings are bringing us back to a lamb nature to be United back with the lamb so you have Mr and M is lamb again I thought I was under an ego anointing that's the anointing of the age this is the anointing of the prophetic this is the anointing of Clear Vision this is the anointing when the word has been unfolded and we clearly see the word from beginning to end we're under an eagle anointing but don't forget that eagle anointing is still there to push you back into the presence of the Lamb because he wants you to sit on his throne with him and he wants to sit on the throne of your heart with you so that you can come to an invisible union he wants us to come back to fullness not partial am fullness brother brandham I just want to show some examples from The Prophet's life because he was this he was this uh this portion of the prophecy that came to full manifestation before our eyes we get to see a mature adopted son of God and he was the Great Eagle for our age he was under the eagle anointing do you believe that the eagle anointing was the anointing on brother brenham's life yes but do you realize also that there was other powers that worked in his life at other times for specific needs brother B made a statement now he says and now he got a question on questions and answers in the seals now I just it goes to show that people without the baptism and not called to the office a minister has no business to be in the pool pit somebody asked him a question and he didn't like the way it was phrased that's right he said I could take that person now by the help of God and tie them in such a knot and make their head swim I don't care what and he stops says now I don't mean now that don't sound right right forgive me I didn't mean that Lord I felt him check me on that I didn't mean to say it that way I'm sorry I believe that the Holy Spirit could reveal to that person some secret that sounds better here you have the prophet of the age if anybody's got a right to rail down amen the call down fire from heaven on false teaching and he and he does it many many times not to individual people but he does it to the age and to the denominations but here he comes to a place where he starts to take that same how dare this person how dare you take the word and I could tie him in knots and all of the sudden the spirit of God checks him amen why because there's more anointings than just the eagle anointing at work in the Holy Ghost and he begins to repent he said then the next thing he says this is what I want to start paying attention to said just like tuning an instrument when you do something wrong you can tell it as a Christian said you do something wrong he didn't like that he was so tuned in to the spirit of God that when he did something that God didn't like amen he caught it and he began to repent and said he didn't like that I mean I thought the prophet of an age would have the right to say whatever he wants and straighten out everything that's no he had to be a lamb more than just an eagle he had to be a lamb and in the lamb was all four anointings he goes on brother brandham it's amazing how when he begins the rail on one individual the spirit of God checks him just stops him in his tracks and the Lord didn't like that but then he comes to the indictment and he begins to rail on the whole age amen and he starts to scream out I indict this generation and he starts to say some rough things about the generation this sin loving gener I am this cursed sin loving generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ where was all that soft I shouldn't have said well maybe the Holy Ghost could show him a better way to everything there is a season and in a time and in a place a time to speak a time to refrain from speaking remember brother B was talking about that time that he was in the meetings and the the young couple was kissing and and and making love in the front row and he had been told before a great test was coming because we know that the Elisha Ministry the Elijah Ministry failed that test before when Elisha called the she Bears to come down and and now the God speaks to him and says whatever you say and and then uh now he now he's watching this couple and he's upset about what they're doing but he looked down at him and he says says I looked down there I said I forgive you now listen that's exactly what he wanted amen but the eagle anointing yeah the eagle anointing came to bring the word to bring separation and bring judgment upon the Earth that's why God had him throw a stone in the air and start a little Whirlwind and go and judgment striking the West Coast because his ministry his ministry was to come and call out a bride out from among the denominations Amen to be a separate people and it was also to begin the wrath of God and the judgments for those who rejected amen but yet here he stands and the anointing of Elijah and says I forgive you which was not happening in the Old Testament they were bringing judgment and curses and railings and judgment but now under the same anointing of the same Prophet Elijah anointing he looks down and says I forgive you and that's what God wanted for That season amen praise God here's another one do you remember when brother Benham had a friend take his rifle and Bor it out to be a weatherbe sent it to sent it to weatherbe and had it bored out and he took it down to the rifle range and when he shot it there was too much pressure there wasn't enough clearance they messed up on the Machining and it exploded it put a bunch of shrapnel in his eye and around his eye almost took out his vision he said it was the hand of God that protected him was a what the doctor told him blew the barrel out to the 50 yard line blew the bolt he said to the deer pin I don't know where the deer pin was and he talks about that he talks about that story and then he comes a little bit later after he tells that story to the church and he makes this statement he says now I know the spiritual application to it there are three of us in this room right now that knows what it is and it raised the hair on your head but I wouldn't tell no one just these three people for a confirmation now it's all right it's it's all right God knowed all about it and forewarned it and everything else and we know it it was partly my fault and I had something I took up for a man one time when I should not have took up I I I could have just shook the liver out of him instead of doing it I had to pay for it that's all right it's me and it's forgiven now and we'll go on wow he looks down at a couple doing wrong and he says I forgive you he goes the rail on a man that that's got the wrong Doctrine and asking a question and God checks him and shouldn't have said it like that the Lord didn't like it he comes to the to the indictment he starts railing on the whole generation and and and it's like it's back and forth and up and down and when are you rough and when are you soft and when do you forgive and when do you don't forgive and now there's a man amen that had done something wrong and brother bham St took up for him defended him protected him when he shouldn't have he should have shook the liver out of him and because he took up for the man when he should have corrected the man God allowed this accident to happen is what brother B said it was my fault yeah and God showed him it was his fault cuz he shouldn't have done that are you confused when do you answer a fool according to his family when do you not answer a fool according to his folly I want to propose to you that there's absolutely no intellectual way to figure this out there is zero way there's no textbook there's no manual there's no Creed there's no code of conduct well we will ever figure out how God wants us to act in every situation amen and I think it's supposed to be that way because if we come into a uniformity of cond cond and we find out in this situation you act this way and in this situation you act this way then all of a sudden we'll just go through the motions we all become a little robots little 10 soldiers but God wants to manifest himself in his bride the same way he manifest himself in Jesus Christ and in Jesus Christ was the lamb but in the lamb was the fullness of the godhead bodily and sometimes he spoke and sometimes he didn't speak and sometimes he judged and sometimes he forgave amen sometimes he healed sometimes he didn't heal yeah many times brother Brandon would pray for people with the phone they'd be healed he would fly out or drive out to somebody pray for them they'd be healed and then sometimes God would stop him and say don't go amen here's another one you remember brother brandham said one time he went to the Pentecostal uh there was a Pentecostal preacher and the Pentecostal preacher wanted to uh introduce his wife to brother brandham and he saw her in her tight clothes and her makeup and all these things and jewelry whatever I don't remember the full description and and and brother B said I thought you told me your wife was a saint she looks more like a haint to me this is the man who got corrected for saying I could take the Bible and tie that man in knots and God didn't like that yeah now a man introduces his wife and he says I thought you said she was a saint she looks more like a haint to me now I I don't know about you but I if I said that and you overheard me what would you think of me brother Chad's not a good pastor he should have never said that that's not the way you're to handle that we're supposed to have a lamb nature maybe we're too quick to judge each other based off our own Paradigm we get in our mind the way Christ would operate in every situation but listen it's way more complex than you and I could ever figure out the the nature of God is so deep and so complex and so diverse and there's so many things God's trying to accomplish maybe there is a time to correct and maybe there's a time to refrain maybe there's a Time amen like brother brandom said he he he made a quote one time I'm not going to quote it right I could bring it here but I've never brought it to the pull pit but it's I laugh every time I read it brother R said if you got a good gospel Pastor it'll take take the gospel and hold his children down and spank them right good with it this is a quote if you want me to I can put it on the overhead he said then you'll find a a a a church that's an order where people want to come and the spirit can move pastor's not supposed to hold his children down in space think him right good with the Bible unless sometimes he is and then maybe sometimes he's not supposed to maybe sometimes he should be patient but maybe sometimes he's too patient maybe there's times a daddy should be patient maybe sometimes a daddy's too patient you see what I'm saying we we judge people so quick yes they should have never said that to their child they never should have said that to that brother I know that was wrong but the way he said it that that how do you know that wasn't exactly what God wanted and how do you know that wasn't exactly what was needed how how can you say what you needed was an ox anointing when God was calling for a lion I I'm to the place now where I I don't want to touch God's anointed I don't know what God's doing I'm to the point where I don't have it figured out friends I don't know what should happen in every conversation in every situation but I do know one thing that we're going to have to completely depend on the leadership of the Holy Ghost and God is going to have to take control of his bride if she's going to operate to the same level that Jesus Christ operated in his Earthly Ministry she's going to have to be just as surrendered to the will of the father amen so that when brother when when Jesus Christ walks down through the pool of Bethesda he will tiptoe around sick people and infirmed and B motherss with babies and'll go to the one God said and do that and that only no matter what everybody else thinks how could you do that how could you walk past that b you didn't even pray for you didn't even stop and talk to her and tell her that you wished her baby would get how could you be the Lamb of God you weren't sweet enough you weren't kind enough you weren't hard enough you tolerated too much you didn't tolerate enough God help us am it's all I can say is God help us amen how do you know that that Mom and Dad aren't handling that situation in their home exactly the way God wants them to handle it amen it may be wrong I don't know how do you know that that the minister who comes and preaches a soft easy message wasn't exactly what God wanted or if he comes and he preaches a raing hard message wasn't exactly what God wanted right and how how many times we go out and says he never should have said that never should have done that that was wrong and maybe it was what God was calling for and if we say that what have we said about the spirit of God could we be calling a holy thing Unholy right I hope you're sufficiently impressed that this is way more complicated than a human brain will figure out amen am our brains are not going to figure out that our years of experience are not going to figure this out our knowledge of of quotes are not going to figure this out it's going to take the direct leadership of the Holy Ghost brother venam tolds that man your wife you said she was a saint she looks more like a hint to me I mean if I was standing there when he said that I would have found some excuse to walk away it's just me I would have blushed I would have walked away and and thinking my goodness how could he say something like that there was things brother Bram said they're in marriage and divorce that I don't know that I could ever say over a pullit describing a woman of the world and how low she can be and the names he used was it right or was it wrong was he right was it the anointing of the Holy Ghost or was he wrong what if somebody else comes and does that are they right or are they wrong it's a good question I personally am tired of being a know- it all I want to go back to being a know nothing I want to go back to the security of just trusting God saying God I don't have it figured out I'm uncomfortable with this I'm not going down that path but I don't know I'm not touching it I'm letting you sort it all out yeah amen here's another one brother manam says here some time ago a man met me out here aside I had a Pianist here had a little uh had a little short little skirt and wasn't just exactly I guess just right and the lady had short hair and she was just a babe in this way and she was playing the piano and a man met me out there just tearing me to Pieces said and you're a Pentecostal preacher and let that woman sit up there with short hair and just going on like that everything well I said I think the woman has a good spirit in her I certainly do not agree with that you know I don't agree and he says and I think that any woman now he comes down a little bit later in the quote I think that any woman that's motherly and godly and a sisterly ought to go to such a person and with sweetness of the spirit just sit down and talk to that lady and if she's of God the holy spirit will understand those things and she'll correct herself but when you really quickly condemn her and drive her away you might harm that Young born baby see I wouldn't condemn the person God so there brother brandham was even allowing a Woman Who Wasn't dressed right with short hair playing the piano somebody condemned him but he says but she's got a good spirit she's just a baby in the way and I wouldn't condemn her or harm her and then he talks to the man whose wife was playing the piano with makeup and jewelry and he said she's a ha yeah you see the circumstance are totally different and the response is dictated by the circumstances and by the leadership of the Holy Ghost brother Bram didn't want to discourage that newborn baby he wanted her to learn he wanted her to be right but he didn't want to discourage her when the other one was the uh a minister's wife who had been who knows how long in the church should have known better to everything there is a season and a time a time to speak and a time to refrain from speaking so you just go and figure out when to speak and when to refrain and you let me know how it goes you tell me when to answer a fool according to his folly and then tell me when not to answer a fool according to his folly you know what's shameful some of you are in the room right now trying to figure the answer to that question thinking well in this circumstance or in give it up just quit just stop and recognize this isn't an intellectual exercise this isn't years experience this is the leadership of the Holy Ghost memorizing scriptures won't solve this problem it's going to take the spirit of God directing our mouths directing our mind moving Us by his Spirit that's the only thing that's going to work brother Bram said in the paman church age said those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time amen so is God going to work in and through the bride absolutely how is that going to happen she will do only his will amen we've got to get to a place where he's got preeminence and we absolutely surrender our thinking our feelings amen there's been times you you've been there too many of us we've been times where God is moving us to say something to somebody and it's like a pushing force behind you and you do not want to say it you do not want to question the brother or sister or or tell them that you disagree or or something said in a in a conversation and you want so bad to let it go cuz it's against your person personality you don't want to create a fuss you don't want to hurt their feelings but there's something driving you inside and and something saying say it say it say it and and you have no option but to say it Hey listen that's where we've got to be under absolute control where he has preeminence there's been times in the pull pit where I've had that same thing something inside of me a voice saying say it say it and I'm swallowing it down and swallowing it down and swallowing it down cuz I don't want to say say it and shamefully there's been times I was too afraid to say it and had to repent afterwards because I failed God because of my personality my fear of hurting feelings yes we may have to get beyond our personalities and our fear of hurting feelings we may have to get beyond our concept of what is appropriate and not appropriate our own concept remember we all have our own concept maybe we need to be completely totally dependent on God Amen for everything brother benam says now here you are a person I'm preaching the word saying that he is not dead he's alive he's alive and promised to identify himself in our flesh human flesh like he did back there all that God was he poured into Christ did we see it manifest he was the lamb who acted like a lion in the temple who acted like the eagle who we saw all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church that's him Christ in us and he wants to be expressed just like he was 2,000 years ago amen where does he want to be expressed he wants to be expressed in you and in me what's it going to take preeminence amen Lord I've decided that I want to express you this way I want to I want to marry the the young couples bury the dead kiss the babies that's the way I want to express you I want to always be friendly always be nice don't ever use me for correction I don't want to do that don't ever use me to take a stand at work I don't want to do that either I only want to be used like this I don't think that's the way it should be he says in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same Jesus in The Bride form same power same church same thing same word the same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head here and all that life that come through here through the church age all that life that come through here picked up its people and now it's forming into the head for a Rapture what is it the same Jesus in Bride form that means all the power all the anointing all the demonstration it's all here amen then he says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said Satan said oh but she turned around and listened to him but that even the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to do it yes God's going to do it he knows he'll have it he said church with will be there withouts spot or wrinkle she's going to stand there in the Splendor of him his word made manifest she'll be a token to the world Amen why because it was his word his mind his idea his desire his expression through me amen now I want to come back to the lamb he's a lamb we have to be a lamb I think sometimes in our own thinking we think well you have to have a lamb nature well if you have a lamb nature then you don't ever say anything rough if you have a lamb nature you never stand against anything you're just Meek and get pushed that's not Christianity that's not the Holy Ghost all those other four anointings are mixed in the lamb the lamb is the fullness the lamb was Jesus Christ the Lamb of God and in him was all that manifestation and we saw it in the prophet in our day what do you think we'll see in our day I have to be a lamb's wife I just have to be super nice to everybody and really sweet and no matter what's said right or wrong and no correction no my goodness you know what will happen to us if we stay there we'll be off the word in no time amen but sometimes he's got to come like a lion and stand for the word sometimes you got to come with a man and take the scriptures and expose the evil and and and totally pull it apart sometimes he comes as the ox where we just suffer and let it go because that's the right thing to do right there sometimes the eagle comes and can see from the end to the beginning of this situation and it's all got to be the bride but she has to be the lamb right so then I started really thinking what does it mean to be a lamb maybe it's so much more complex than what I thought I thought if she's a lamb she's just going to be I mean just just kind of there say anything not do anything but that's not the way he was when he was the lamb and it's the continuation of his ministry right and what was poured into him he's now poured himself into us so what should it look like it might look like what it looked like when he was here it might look like what it looked like in the prophet of the age who was under the eagle anointing but exhibited all the anointings maybe it's going to look the same way so what makes her a lamb we go back to the Token message Jesus was baptized by John and the Bible said and he saw the spirit of God like a dove coming down upon him therefore if if it would have been a wolf or if it would have been any other animal the nature of the dove could not have blended with the nature of the wolf neither could the nature of the dove blend with any other animal but the lamb and those two Natures come together then they could agree with each other further down in the token he says what if the dove had come down instead of being a lamb there would have been some other animal like a lion a man an eagle I hope you catch just stay you may not catch it but you will stay with me it would have quickly took its flight and went back but when he found that nature that he could blend into it just became one then the dove led the lamb and notice it led the lamb to slaughter now the lamb was obedient to the dove no matter where it led it was willing to go amen what makes her a lamb like he was a lamb because she never raises her voice she never criticizes anybody she never brings a correction she that's not what makes her a lamb what makes her a lamb is because wherever the dove leads she humbly follows amen she doesn't snarl she doesn't growl she's Meek and humble to the dove amen that's what makes her a lamb Matthew 4:1 says then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil what made Jesus a lamb wasn't that he didn't speak out against evil that he didn't correct the wrong that he didn't call the phes a den of Thieves and he didn't call them whiteed seers and and he and he called them of their father the devil it wasn't because he was a lamb that he was so quiet no he was a lamb because the lamb was totally submissive to the father and he was led like a lamb by the dove which was the spirit of God and he followed like a lamb follows the dove that's what made him a lamb and what will make his wife a lamb because she has the same nature he has the same thing was in him now he's poured himself into her it's the same Jesus now in Bride form doing the same acting the same the same word this is what the prophet told us and now what will distinguish the lamb and make her Mrs lamb what will make her a lamb also is because she'll follow the dove brother brandham preached a message on the wings of a snow white dove and in that message he was preaching about going to Sabino Canyon and having the sword put in his hand and then 3 days later he said he went down another Trail and the Lord told him to lay his hands on a rock and he was bare chested had no shirt on and and and the Lord spoke to him and said what's that under your heart and he set back and in white quarts was written the word Eagle in white quarts and here's what he says I want you to catch what he says I was so excited I run home I got a camera and I came back the next day and took the picture of it I was still it still there wrote In The Rock White Eagle Dove leading Eagle why because the the dove leted him down the right path both days and the dove was leading the eagle and he comes further down in his prayer at the end of the service he said dear God I thank you for these things father you give Noah the sign you gave the world the sign and you gave me a sign and the next day seeing that eagle flying oh God there's a message coming forth now and I pray God that you'll let the dove lead granted Lord It's led me to Faith I never had before the dove leading the eagle think about this look at the contrast and the character of these two birds the eagle is an aggressive bird it rips it tears it it flies solo it's independent it's aggressive it's a killer yeah right it's got to be led by the dove amen or else it'll go wrong what do you think leads the lion the dove what do you think leads the ox the dove what do you think leads the man the dove if you isolate any one of these anointings and try to operate in that anointing without the leading of the dove you'll destroy somebody's life you say this is I'm just under a line anointing if you're not being led by the dove and you take and add and mix your own personality in with that you'll destroy somebody acting like an apostle somebody who's got the word and an authority on the word and you'll start a whole new segment of unbelief amen you take the man's annoying say I'm a teacher and I've got this figured out and I can put this together but you're not being led by the dove I mean you'll absolutely sww the wrong seed into the people's hearts you do the same thing I'm under the eagle anointing we're Eagle people we ate the book to prophesy again that's absolutely the truth this bride is under an eagle anointing she must prophesy again but only by the leading of the dove the white dove leading the eagle not not her own thinging not saying we're Eagles and I just blasted yeah I stood down there in the corner of the Baptist Church and everyone that came out I told him did the dove lead you there and did the dove say condemn and criticize there are times the dove will lead you to speak and most of the time when you don't want to speak right when you can't wait to say it it's probably a good indication you shouldn't amen next time I the first open door I what makes her a lamb like he's a lamb not our own ideas get those ideas out of our head the fful ministry is the ministry of the Lamb it's the Min Ministry of Christ but it comes under individual anointings if the the Evangelist is just raking you over the coals does it mean it's not the spirit of Christ working through him that's not the lamb the lamb doesn't talk that way well ask the Pharisees if the lamb talks that way go ask Peter if the lamb ever talks that way when Peter turned when God turned around to Peter when Jesus turned around Peter and said get thee behind me Satan amen you tell me if the lamb ever talks that way or not go back and read the gospels the bride shouldn't this and we shouldn't that we should we should do exactly as the dove leads us to do there's a time for everything a time to speak and a time to refrain from speaking a time to Rend and a time to sew that was render a time to plant and a time to pluck out what's been planted guess what God sends the right anointing by the leadership of the dove to meet every need in our lives and as we walk in this earth in this end time May that Dove lead us may we be the lamb led by the dove little lambs the Bride of Jesus Christ led by the same Dove that led our Prophet by the same Dove that led Jesus Christ Our husband and let's not criticize each other anymore if there's a problem and you think somebody was too rough or too just go talk to him about it just go tell them hey I don't understand why you said that or did that or and you may find out that they didn't want to do that they did it because they felt like the Lord wanted them to do that and then you can still be confused about it and you can still not feel right about it but I would I would advise you not to speak against it unless it's off the word let's go to Romans 8 I want to finish with Romans 8 Romans chapter 8 verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God you know what we need more than anything in the world is the leadership of the dove we need need God more than we needed him ever before we need him every moment of Our Lives I need that little buzzer that was in brother Brandon when he started the rail against that man and he felt that that wasn't right and stopped right then and said he that that didn't please him he didn't like that I got to have that in my life I'm begging for God to put that in Greater measure in my life I'm not going to make it on my own I can't take my own idea or my own leadership I can't take just every inspiration I fall under cuz you get with different Brothers you'll get different Inspirations I need the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and the leadership of the dove to come and make me match his desire for me that moment and what he had me do in the last time I was in this situation may not be what he has me do the next time I'm in the situation I need the dove we need the dove we come to a time of desperation friends where where we should be fearful to make a move without God's leadership in our lives there's no textbook there's no manual no Creed what what are we going to do answer not a fool according to his folly next verse answer a fool according to his foly when do I do which just as he leads every circumstance is different God is trying to accomplish something different through each one sometimes maybe if I answered that fool according to his folly he would just take me down a path of folly and I would become like him there's no good but maybe that poor man's caught in foolishness and God wants to open his eyes now I answer a fool according to his folly that he wouldn't be deceived by his own conceit God knows what will work and what won't work yeah amen says cast not your Pearls Before Swine for they trample Under Foot and turn and ren you how do I know if they're swine or not swine well brother Chad if you use this formula and you if you watch you can tell really we're going to go back to that kind of nonsense I saw their eyes and when they resisted I I don't know I haven't got it figured out and every time I thought I did I embarrassed myself thank you God that embarrassed myself thank you God that he let me get embarrassed and he let me fail so that I stopped trusting in my own inspiration I want the dove to lead this lamb I want to be a lamb not not that I am afraid to speak When God says speak I want to speak when he says speak when he wants me to correct I want to correct when he wants me to console I want to console when he wants me to smooth it over I want to smooth it over when he wants me to Bear it I want to Bear it I want to do whatever he want wants me to do but I cannot in myself figure out what I'm supposed to do intellectually I want to be a lamb and be led by the dove and if he wants to anoint me as a lion and say something I'll say it if he wants to anoint me as an eagle to expose him I'll expose it if he wants me just to Bear it I'll bear it but it's going to have to be his anointing in me and his leadership under that anointing or else I'm going to get embarrassed again I'm going to hurt somebody what makes her this is just me friends what makes her a lamb what makes her a lamb is not because she is this syrupy sweet and always nice and everybody's always okay and we're all one that's not what makes through a lamb what makes through a lamb is she's led by the dove and she's totally submissive to the leadership of the Holy Ghost to me that's what makes her a lamb cuz that's what made Christ a lamb and she's willing to surrender her thoughts her dreams her Ambitions her ideas her Creeds and lay it all down to follow the dove even if it leads us into the Wilderness to be tempted by the devil the lamb follows the dove amen let's all stand together I've said it many times and I'll say it again and I'll say it probably for the rest of my days on this Earth but this this message is no joke this isn't a formula this isn't Church attendance this isn't a new set of doctrines this is literally the life of Jesus Christ to be display in people on the Earth people who take the nature of the Lamb people who follow the leadership of the dove it's got to come to full manifestation and he's prophesied it will in this day and he sent everything we need for it to manifest his word is here in full measure his spirit's returned measure Christ himself is here to take his bride by the hand and walk her all the way home what does he need he needs somebody willing to give it all up and surrender and take the nature of a lamb and follow him amen that's what I want I know that's what you want amen let's bow our heads together and pray dear heavenly father I thank you Lord God we know that the lamb has a wife you showed us in the scriptures Lord Lord that the lamb has a wife and we've been told Lord by your Prophet that this is the invisible Union of the bride of Christ that you're uniting with her Lord and if you're a lamb she must be a lamb and Lord if you're I'm your bride I have to be a lamb God forgive me for what I've tried to do in the past forgive me for my own thinking but God I surrender to you aresh come and Lead Me by your Dove Lord God I pray that you would give me a sensitivity to your spirit more than I've ever had before God would you soften my heart would you make me Lord tuned in to your dial God help me to push away all the distractions of the world and all the influences of the world that I might hear your voice Lord that I might move when you say move when I speak when you say speak that I'll refrain from speaking when you tell me to refrain that if it must be corrected I'll correct it if you want me to leave it go I'll leave it go God I have to have your leadership Lord I pray God you come and mold this vessel into your likeness and make me a lamb let your spirit speak to me Lord lead me God let the dove lead this little lamb help me Father without you we can't make it God without you we're hopelessly lost without you we're a failure to begin with but God with you all things are possible come and finish your word in this vessel come and complete complete what you left for this day completed in me I yield myself to you I open my heart and I invite you to come and take full possession let your Dove Lead Me lead your people Lord help us as a people to grow in your very likeness to be surrendered to you in every way to bring every thought into captivity to The Obedience of you Lord may we cast down all reasonings and every High thought may we push aside Lord everything that's a habit or our our old thinking or our own understanding may we may we Just Surrender it all to you and allow you to come and give us your mind and may you work through us we surrender to you Lord we yield as your wife as your bride come and take possession and use us For Your Glory finish the work that you left for this day finish it in US Lord help us Lord to surrender and stay out of the way and just follow you as you lead we ask it in in Jesus Christ's name amen amen was the eagle led by the dove if the eagle wasn't led by the dove it would just rip and tear and rip and tear but the eagle was led by the dove were the apostles in the lion anointing were they led by the dove they were led by the dove in the great age of sacrifice when they were surrendering their lives were they LED by the dove they were led by the dove in the great Reformation when man would print Bibles and start to defeat the lies of the Enemy by the word of God did the LI did the dove lead the man in the Great Eagle age we know the dove was leading the eagle he's still leading the Eagles the eaglets the Messi the dove is still here to lead amen I just want to surrender God
