[8:56] [Music]
[9:03] praise god he's worthy friends
[9:07] he's worthy to be praised let's just bow
[9:09] our hands before we read
[9:11] the lord jesus we thank you father we
[9:14] thank you god for the privilege that we
[9:16] can say
[9:18] that we're your children that from
[9:20] before the foundation of the world
[9:21] you've called us lord to this life
[9:24] you've placed us here by your own
[9:26] purpose you've awakened something within
[9:28] us to recognize who we are
[9:30] not as nothing that we did nothing of
[9:32] our own merit or ability lord but it's
[9:34] all you we acknowledge that lord and we
[9:37] just want to say with gratitude we love
[9:39] you lord
[9:40] we love you for your plan we love you
[9:42] for your wisdom we love you for your
[9:43] strength
[9:44] we love you for what you're doing in our
[9:46] lives and we pray that you would help us
[9:47] to stay yielded to that lord
[9:50] that we could stay surrendered lord it
[9:52] would never be
[9:53] us lord or our will or our wants or our
[9:55] desire but it'll always be you taking
[9:57] preeminence
[9:58] a greater preeminence day by day in your
[10:01] bride
[10:02] for god that is your purpose that is the
[10:04] plan you had before the foundation of
[10:06] the world
[10:07] to have a bride a preeminence and a
[10:09] bride
[10:10] to become a bride god i pray that you
[10:13] would help us lord today to hear your
[10:14] word may you come and speak
[10:16] as only you can speak nor may you break
[10:19] the bread of life to us
[10:21] lord that we may receive it as we read
[10:23] the word lord we pray you bless it lord
[10:25] as we
[10:25] preach i pray it'd be more than a man
[10:27] lord but the man would die
[10:29] and move off to the side and that you
[10:31] would take control
[10:32] and or that you would use the power of
[10:34] your holy ghost to minister this word to
[10:37] us
[10:37] that you would bring it to life inside
[10:39] of us we give you preeminence
[10:42] we love you we give you your place in
[10:45] jesus christ's name
[10:46] we pray amen amen while we're standing
[10:50] let's take our bibles and go to romans
[10:52] chapter 8.
[10:56] romans chapter 8.
[11:03] we'll read a couple scriptures there
[11:05] just before we're seated
[11:07] i also heard that brother joseph and
[11:09] sister rebecca
[11:11] benjamin are here this morning where are
[11:13] they at
[11:14] god bless you the new couple's here yep
[11:17] god bless you we're proud of you
[11:18] thankful for you being here
[11:20] you guys had a nice long honeymoon so
[11:23] we're glad that you're back
[11:25] praise god amen everybody make sure you
[11:28] shake their hands and say hi to him
[11:30] because
[11:31] rebecca's going to be moving you know
[11:33] out to new jersey
[11:35] and so i'm glad you came to see us again
[11:37] before you went to new jersey god bless
[11:38] you both
[11:39] i also want to remind you we have
[11:40] communion service today so we'll be
[11:42] announcing that
[11:43] at the end as well amen let's read this
[11:47] scripture
[11:48] and we'll be seated romans 8 29. romans
[11:56] 8 29 for whom he did for
[11:58] know he also did predestinate
[12:01] to be conformed to the image of his son
[12:04] it's my favorite part of that scripture
[12:07] you know we we want to be like jesus we
[12:09] want his life and us
[12:10] and we want all of those things and
[12:12] sometimes it seems like such an
[12:14] impossibility you know
[12:16] born in hybridization raised in laodicea
[12:19] uh tainted by the wrong thinking the
[12:22] wrong thoughts wrong teaching wrong
[12:24] training
[12:24] all of these years and we think it's
[12:27] somehow in us we can think it's an
[12:29] unsurmountable goal but when we're
[12:31] looking from the carnal side it
[12:32] absolutely is we're looking from our own
[12:34] ability there's no way
[12:36] that we'll ever attain to be like jesus
[12:39] but we're not looking at it from a
[12:40] carnal side we need to be lifted up on
[12:42] eagle's wings to a heavenly perspective
[12:45] and know that that let's read it again
[12:47] for whom he did for no
[12:49] that's me that is us friends he also did
[12:52] predestinate
[12:53] to be conformed to the image of his son
[12:56] he predestinated us to be like jesus
[12:59] we've been predestinated
[13:01] to be conformed into the image of his
[13:03] son it's not our efforts it's not our
[13:05] will and of course
[13:06] we give all our efforts we give all our
[13:07] will but it's by his
[13:09] predestination that we've been we will
[13:12] be conformed into the image of his son
[13:15] that he might be the firstborn among
[13:17] many brethren
[13:18] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[13:21] he also called
[13:23] whom he called then he also justified
[13:27] who he justified then he also
[13:31] glorified are you hoping to be glorified
[13:34] no i've already been glorified amen
[13:37] let's
[13:38] let's just have our seats amen
[13:41] i want to keep your place in this
[13:43] scripture don't lose it but i want to
[13:45] share with you a testimony real quick
[13:46] while we're seated i got a uh
[13:49] lengthy message from brother jeeva
[13:51] ratnam marlapudi
[13:52] you remember he's a our friend from
[13:54] india who was here with us
[13:56] last year and the year before that he
[13:58] visited with us and everybody knows him
[14:00] as the brother with the really hard name
[14:02] with the jiva rotten marlaputi and i
[14:05] practiced it for i don't know how many
[14:06] times so i could say it
[14:07] and it kind of rolls off your tongue
[14:09] nice now
[14:11] but you know i let you know several
[14:13] weeks ago that he had been diagnosed
[14:15] with coven 19 he and his whole family
[14:17] and the doctor had had said there was no
[14:20] more hope for him
[14:21] and that he miraculously made a
[14:22] turnaround well he just
[14:24] friday sent me this text and he followed
[14:26] up with a phone call
[14:27] but i'll read a portion of this to you i
[14:30] said all praises to our lord
[14:32] all praises to our lord for the lord
[14:34] healed me all glory and praises to the
[14:36] name of the almighty for he brought me
[14:38] out of the bed of death
[14:40] may the name of my salvation be
[14:42] glorified that he granted me the
[14:43] privilege to share with you my
[14:45] deliverance from sickness
[14:47] the lord is so merciful only his
[14:48] sovereign grace held me
[14:50] with his precious holy hands my health
[14:52] deteriorated dreadfully in a couple of
[14:54] days
[14:55] that the doctor said to my son to leave
[14:57] the hope
[14:58] but his love made me complete whole
[15:01] amazingly
[15:02] in a very short period of time that the
[15:04] same doctor astonished and admitted
[15:06] it is nothing but the miracle of god
[15:10] the same doctor told his son give up
[15:12] hope the same doctor who said it was a
[15:14] miracle of god
[15:16] i believe it is his grace and the
[15:17] precious prayers offered
[15:19] i heartfully thank you for the most
[15:21] important help which i have seen today
[15:23] that on
[15:23] august 19th you in church prayed for me
[15:27] especially
[15:28] your prayers are answered and turned my
[15:30] family from the drastic disaster
[15:32] to me to a tremendous testimony i write
[15:35] deep from the bosom of my heart i am
[15:37] very
[15:38] grateful amen i just want to share that
[15:40] with you because we prayed together as
[15:42] an assembly and
[15:43] god miraculously turned that situation
[15:46] around
[15:46] that the hindu doctor who said there's
[15:48] no hope said
[15:50] this is nothing but a miracle of god
[15:52] amen so i appreciate
[15:54] your prayers and continue to pray for
[15:56] our brother marla booty
[15:57] he's got some damage to his lungs from
[16:00] the coven 19. he's still suffering with
[16:01] that
[16:02] and the doctor said after a week or two
[16:04] he said he can
[16:05] he can slowly slowly start preaching
[16:08] that's how brother marley put him slowly
[16:09] slowly
[16:10] he can start preaching and then
[16:11] gradually work his way up so
[16:13] i know brother marla booty i doubt he'll
[16:15] slowly slowly
[16:16] start preaching so let's just pray that
[16:18] the lord will completely heal him
[16:20] restore his lungs so that he can
[16:22] continue to do what the lord has called
[16:24] him to do
[16:26] and then i'm going to look at this
[16:27] scripture in romans 29 and
[16:30] uh or i'm sorry verse chapter 8 verse 29
[16:33] and then i'm going to look especially at
[16:34] verse 30.
[16:36] and verse 30 i want to go over this
[16:38] again moreover whom he did predestinate
[16:40] them he also called so
[16:43] [Music]
[16:44] he called you but he called you because
[16:46] he predestinated you
[16:49] and whom he called then he also
[16:51] justified
[16:52] and whom he justified then he also
[16:55] glorified
[16:56] now see this is a finished work from
[16:58] before all of these things are spoken
[17:00] in past tense it's not that someday
[17:03] we're hoping
[17:04] to move to glorification amen in the
[17:06] reality is we
[17:07] understand reality with a carnal mind we
[17:10] we are looking to a future glorification
[17:12] to live in a glorified body
[17:14] amend to come to the fullness of
[17:16] redemption but in the mind of god it's a
[17:19] finished work it's already done
[17:21] god's not wondering what we will do he's
[17:23] not
[17:24] curious about what we will do or where
[17:26] we'll wind up or
[17:28] or how things are going to come out in
[17:29] the end god already knows that he
[17:31] settled that before the foundation of
[17:32] the world
[17:33] we he foreknew us he predestinated whom
[17:36] he prayed destiny he called
[17:37] whom he called he had justified whom he
[17:40] justified
[17:41] he hath already glorified amen and
[17:43] brother branham teaches
[17:44] us about true justification amen in case
[17:47] you're wondering this is part three play
[17:49] sons part three
[17:51] uh but who true justification brother
[17:54] bam says
[17:55] is just as if you've never done it and
[17:57] brother
[17:58] brother baby even goes on to tell us he
[17:59] said you never did it in the first place
[18:01] the real you the true you
[18:02] you come through hybridization he said
[18:04] in no fault of your own
[18:07] now we've done things since then that
[18:08] were our fault i mean we've made
[18:09] mistakes we failed
[18:11] we have to repent to that but but coming
[18:13] coming
[18:14] in hybrid flesh was no fault of our own
[18:16] amen coming in a fallen nature with in a
[18:18] fallen condition was no fault of our own
[18:21] amen but back in the beginning in the
[18:22] mind of god the attribute of god the
[18:24] real
[18:25] us who we were intended to be all along
[18:27] amen
[18:28] that attribute never sinned to begin
[18:30] with
[18:31] it can't disbelieve it can't unbelieve
[18:33] the word i mean you can't disbelieve the
[18:35] word
[18:35] amen it believes the word it never
[18:37] failed to begin with
[18:38] amen and through a new birth amen you're
[18:40] awakened back to the reality of who you
[18:42] really are
[18:43] that seed that real you the true you
[18:45] from before the foundation of the world
[18:47] has sprung to life amen and he brings
[18:50] you to an understanding or a realization
[18:53] of the justification where with he's
[18:54] already justified
[18:56] you before the foundation of the world
[18:57] how can he do such a thing
[18:59] because in his mind he had a lamb slain
[19:02] from before the foundation of the world
[19:03] amen so we could be justified from
[19:05] before the foundation of the world
[19:08] but whom he justified then he is also
[19:11] glorified so praise god
[19:15] my glorification is secure the change in
[19:18] my body my position
[19:20] my future home all of that that is
[19:22] secure
[19:23] and brother vamp told us we read this
[19:25] quote where he says i'm not
[19:26] i'm not saying this to the the mess up
[19:29] doctrine i'm saying to straighten it out
[19:30] to get rid of this scare this scare that
[19:33] i'm not going to make it to scare that i
[19:35] won't make the rapture the
[19:36] the fear that somehow i'll fail and mess
[19:39] up and i'll mess up
[19:40] really bad on the day that jesus decides
[19:42] to take everybody home
[19:46] you know that's that's all
[19:47] denominational thinking that's all
[19:48] denominational ways of
[19:50] of holding people in fear and using fear
[19:53] and using human emotion
[19:55] amen to try to coerce people to live a
[19:57] good life and
[19:58] amen but we don't we don't we're not
[20:01] brothers that we're not reformers
[20:03] we're not here trying through a an aaa
[20:06] program or something like that trying to
[20:09] convince you
[20:10] to live for god trying to persuade you
[20:12] to to
[20:13] to stay true to the word of god and
[20:16] somehow through
[20:17] emotional mechanisms the to guilt you in
[20:20] or fear you
[20:21] in to living a life for jesus christ
[20:24] but no the gospel comes amen the opening
[20:27] of the seals comes
[20:28] to peel away the mystery of our life so
[20:30] that we know who we are
[20:32] amen to free us from bondage to free us
[20:35] from
[20:35] fear to free us from the works mentality
[20:39] that i have to earn something from god
[20:41] amen to deliver us from that so that we
[20:43] can be free to be who we were always
[20:45] meant to be
[20:46] amen it's a natural outflow
[20:49] of the soul and so brother brown came to
[20:54] dismiss all of that amen so that we're
[20:57] not
[20:57] we're not trying to to scare the
[21:00] teenagers amen
[21:01] and you know scare them to death you
[21:03] know you smoke that cigarette amen the
[21:05] lord could take us all away the moment
[21:07] you've got that between your fingers
[21:11] but i've sat through preaching like that
[21:12] when i was a kid
[21:16] you know you want to go out and you want
[21:18] to go run the roads
[21:19] and but you know
[21:22] if i'm predestinated if he foreknew me
[21:25] for destiny he called me he chose
[21:27] me he's ju he's already justified me and
[21:30] he's already glorified me
[21:33] and when you come into that kind of
[21:35] reality i mean not the reality in your
[21:37] mind but when that reality strikes that
[21:39] seed on the soul and comes to life
[21:41] you realize i mean there's nothing else
[21:43] i want of the world there's nothing else
[21:45] i want to do or want to have
[21:47] all i want is him the one the one who i
[21:49] belong to who i came from who i'm part
[21:52] of
[21:52] amen it just releases me to be what i've
[21:55] always
[21:56] meant to be amen that's why
[22:00] it's so good to understand some of these
[22:02] things
[22:04] we've i'm not going to make it i've
[22:05] already made it
[22:07] i'm just living out fleshing out what
[22:09] god once lived out and fleshed out for
[22:11] this time
[22:12] this portion in this time but also i
[22:15] like to look at this scripture in a way
[22:17] so we can understand what salvation
[22:19] really is
[22:20] true salvation amen true justification
[22:23] because those whom he's truly justified
[22:25] he is already glorified
[22:28] so it's not it's not like this you know
[22:32] you can have justification and and then
[22:34] you can maybe have sanctification
[22:36] and then the baptism of holy ghost but
[22:38] it all comes together to equal the new
[22:40] birth
[22:41] you can brother bam said you you can you
[22:44] can come to justification without
[22:45] sanctification he's really teaching us
[22:47] the progress through the church ages
[22:50] but but if justification we come to a
[22:53] place of understanding justification or
[22:55] receiving christ for our sins
[22:56] but never move on into sanctification my
[22:59] question is is that true justification
[23:03] we move into justification but we refuse
[23:05] to move into the baptism holy ghost
[23:07] was that true sanctification
[23:10] see for those who are predestinated
[23:15] those who he's saving out of this
[23:18] generation
[23:19] those who are part of his bride amen
[23:22] they're
[23:22] they're justified and they're already
[23:24] glorified
[23:27] so they never come to a place of
[23:29] justification and just camp out and sit
[23:32] there
[23:32] amen because in god's mind it's already
[23:34] finished they've gone all the way
[23:38] so when we justified them he's already
[23:41] glorified that's
[23:43] true justification true justification
[23:47] so we we know that god finished the work
[23:49] god did it all
[23:51] god's placed us god's got a plan for us
[23:53] there is no scare let all the scare go
[23:55] away and
[23:56] brother bam said the key to operating or
[23:59] living the christian life is rest
[24:01] right the key to operating every gift is
[24:03] rest amen the key to living the
[24:05] christian life
[24:06] is rest amen not always striving to be
[24:08] something
[24:09] but resting in who i am and trusting him
[24:12] to do whatever he wants to do with me
[24:17] let's go to hebrews chapter 4. let's
[24:20] read a couple scriptures quickly
[24:30] together
[24:42] hebrews chapter 4 verse 3 for we which
[24:45] have believed
[24:46] do enter into rest as he said as i have
[24:49] sworn in my wrath
[24:51] if they shall enter into my rest though
[24:53] the works were finished from
[24:54] the foundation of the world so he's
[24:57] telling us to
[24:58] enter into this rest but he's saying but
[25:00] it was finished before the foundation of
[25:02] the world
[25:03] you know and sometimes i i don't want to
[25:06] misunderstand i think sometimes in the
[25:08] past i've had this misunderstanding of
[25:09] moving into rest
[25:11] amen because as you move into rest now
[25:13] there there's no more
[25:14] trying there's no more effort there's no
[25:16] more but that's not the way it was when
[25:18] the children of israel moved across
[25:20] jordan and they went into their land of
[25:22] rest their land of promise
[25:23] amen and he moved him in the rest he
[25:25] says you'll go in
[25:26] you'll go in there brother ben said
[25:28] that's crossing jordan it's a type of
[25:29] the baptism the holy ghost
[25:31] amen but you'll fight for every inch of
[25:33] ground
[25:34] so how can you move into rest but still
[25:36] fight amen
[25:37] and you know for me it's it's israelites
[25:40] moving from
[25:41] a people with no land a people with no
[25:44] identity a people
[25:45] with just a promise but no position
[25:48] a people who have a promise in their
[25:50] life amen but but no land
[25:53] no nation no homeland no territory
[25:56] amen and then slavery and in bondage and
[25:59] god brought them out
[26:00] from being a people with no position and
[26:02] no place was just a promise
[26:04] and then they brought him out of the
[26:06] bondage and slavery of egypt and he
[26:07] moved him over
[26:08] and he moved him into the promised land
[26:10] amen this is going to be your rest this
[26:13] is going to be your place of rest
[26:14] but there's no more wondering who you
[26:17] are when the promise will be fulfilled
[26:19] and what's our nation what's our land
[26:21] what's going on we already know
[26:22] all of that we know our position we know
[26:26] the word we know the land
[26:27] amen it's been given to us and yes you
[26:29] have to fight for every inch of it but
[26:31] this is our rest this is our striving
[26:34] it's the end of our striving to
[26:35] determine who we are whether or not
[26:37] we're a christian or not
[26:38] whether or not we're a believer or not
[26:40] whether or not we're a child of god or
[26:41] not
[26:41] that we're coming to a rest in the soul
[26:44] on those things
[26:45] i know who i am by the grace of god i
[26:48] know what he made me by the grace of god
[26:50] he's positioned me in this age he's
[26:52] positioned me in this body of flesh
[26:54] he's positioned me with whatever gifts
[26:55] and whatever abilities and whatever he
[26:57] wants to accomplish
[26:58] he did it he put me here and i'm resting
[27:01] in that
[27:03] am i still striving against yes i'm
[27:05] striving amen am i still laboring in the
[27:07] word yes we're laboring the word
[27:09] are we still pushing back the enemy
[27:11] pushing back to evil for us
[27:13] absolutely but in my soul i've come to a
[27:16] place of rest because of my
[27:17] identification
[27:19] i'm not wondering amen i've been i've
[27:22] been put
[27:22] back in contact amen with that mind that
[27:25] i was a part of from before the
[27:26] foundation of the world that can
[27:28] properly identify me and place me in the
[27:30] word
[27:32] so now we moved into the land amen not
[27:35] to
[27:35] not to sit down and take naps and
[27:39] not that kind of rest not to
[27:42] never try fight back an enemy not even
[27:45] not even the kind of rest where you
[27:46] don't even plant corn
[27:48] anymore or milk a cow anymore
[27:51] or build a house or cut firewood it
[27:54] wasn't that kind of rest friends
[27:57] we've moved into rest although the works
[27:59] were finished before the foundation of
[28:00] the world but we moved into a place
[28:02] of identification moved into a homeland
[28:06] into a heritage and a place prepared
[28:08] amen we've been identified at the end of
[28:10] the age of who we are
[28:12] we're not wanderers anymore we're not
[28:14] slaves in denominational bondage
[28:16] we've been brought out with a mighty
[28:17] hand and placed solidly
[28:19] into the territory of the holy ghost
[28:23] the word has been opened to us the
[28:25] territory's been expanded amen
[28:27] and now we're moving in that with a rest
[28:29] on who we are
[28:32] oh i i mean who am i my lutheran and my
[28:34] baptist i mean which one's right
[28:36] what should i be which doctrine should i
[28:38] align to we're free from all those
[28:40] wanderings
[28:41] we're free from all those kind of
[28:43] questions that we've been moved into a
[28:45] land
[28:46] a heritage acts 15 18 says known unto
[28:50] god are
[28:51] all his works from the beginning of the
[28:53] world
[28:55] so all of his works
[28:58] but he does brother bram says he put
[29:01] himself on partnership with man
[29:03] he works in and through man
[29:06] so known unto god were all his works
[29:08] from the beginning of the world
[29:09] but for god to do his works now he's
[29:11] going to do it in and through man
[29:15] so if he's going to do it in and through
[29:16] man if i'm part of that plan and god's
[29:19] got a work to do in and through me
[29:21] amen then the things that i'm going to
[29:23] do he knew
[29:24] before the foundation of the world
[29:27] so i need to rest in him
[29:31] let's go to first corinthians chapter
[29:32] 12.
[29:34] i have a lengthy reading here but i want
[29:35] to lay this foundation down and then
[29:37] move on
[29:47] there's several things i want to get to
[29:49] and i don't want to miss any of it
[29:51] first corinthians chapter 12 verse 1.
[29:54] now concerning spiritual gifts brethren
[29:56] i would not have you
[29:57] ignorant you know that you were gentiles
[30:00] carried away into these dumb idols even
[30:02] as you were led
[30:03] wherefore i give you to understand that
[30:04] no man speaking by the spirit of god
[30:06] calleth jesus accursed
[30:09] that's an interesting scripture
[30:13] no man speaking by the spirit of god
[30:17] calleth
[30:18] jesus accursed
[30:22] amen jesus
[30:25] we know that that jesus
[30:28] has a body on earth is that true
[30:32] and what's that body's name jesus
[30:38] and i just want to say it this way no
[30:40] man speaking by the spirit of god
[30:42] calleth jesus accursed
[30:46] in whatever form he comes in
[30:50] and whatever vessel he chooses to use
[30:52] wherever his spirit abides wherever he
[30:55] is no man calleth that speaketh of the
[30:59] spirit of god
[31:00] calleth jesus a curse that's why we have
[31:02] to be so
[31:03] careful how we speak about brothers
[31:07] and sisters in christ and that no man
[31:11] can say that jesus is lord
[31:13] but by the holy ghost amen now
[31:17] there are diversities of gifts but the
[31:19] same spirit
[31:20] and there are differences of
[31:21] administrations but the same lord
[31:23] and there are diversities of operations
[31:25] but it is the same god which worketh all
[31:27] in all
[31:28] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[31:30] given to every man
[31:31] to profit with all for the one is given
[31:34] by the spirit the word of wisdom
[31:36] to another the word of knowledge by the
[31:38] same spirit to another
[31:40] faith by the same spirit to another the
[31:42] gifts of healing by the same spirit
[31:44] to another the working of miracles to
[31:46] another prophecy to another discerning
[31:48] of spirits
[31:49] to another diverse kinds of tongues to
[31:51] another the interpretation of tongues
[31:53] but all these work at that one and the
[31:55] self-same spirit dividing to every man
[31:58] severally as he will for as the body is
[32:01] one and has many members and all the
[32:03] members of that one body being many are
[32:05] one body
[32:06] so also is christ for by one spirit are
[32:09] we all baptized into one body whether we
[32:12] be jews or gentiles
[32:13] whether we be bond or free and have been
[32:16] been all made to drink
[32:18] unto one spirit for the body is not one
[32:20] member
[32:21] but many if the food shall say because i
[32:24] am not the hand i am not of the body
[32:26] is it therefore not of the body if the
[32:28] ear shall say be
[32:29] because i am not the i i am not of the
[32:31] body is it therefore not of the body
[32:34] if the whole body were an eye where were
[32:36] the hearing
[32:37] if the hole were hearing where were the
[32:39] smelling but now hath god set the
[32:41] members every one of them in the body as
[32:43] it had pleased him
[32:45] and if they were all one member where
[32:47] were the body
[32:48] but now are they many members yet but
[32:51] one body
[32:52] and the eye cannot say unto the hand i
[32:54] have no need of thee
[32:55] nor again the head to the feet i have no
[32:57] need of you
[32:58] name much more those members of the body
[33:00] which seem to be more feeble
[33:02] are necessary and those members of the
[33:04] body which we think to be less honorable
[33:07] upon these we bestow more abundant honor
[33:09] and our uncommonly parts have more
[33:11] abundant comeliness
[33:13] for our comely parts have no need but
[33:15] god has tempered the body together
[33:17] having given more abundant honor to that
[33:19] part which lacketh
[33:20] that there should be no schism in the
[33:22] body but that the members should
[33:24] have the same care one for another and
[33:26] whether one members suffer
[33:28] all the members suffer with it or one
[33:30] member be honored
[33:31] all the members rejoice with it now ye
[33:33] are the body of christ and members in
[33:35] particular
[33:36] and god has set some in the church first
[33:38] apostles secondary prophets thirdly
[33:41] teachers
[33:41] after that miracles than gifts of
[33:43] healing helps
[33:44] governments diversities of tongues are
[33:47] all apostles
[33:48] are all prophets are all teachers are
[33:51] all workers of miracles
[33:52] have all the gifts of healing do all
[33:54] speak with tongues
[33:56] do all interpret but covet earnestly the
[33:58] best gifts
[33:59] and yet show i unto you a more excellent
[34:02] way
[34:03] though i speak with the tongue of men
[34:04] and angels and have not
[34:06] love charity divine love
[34:09] capstone love the love of god
[34:13] i am become a sounding brass or tinkling
[34:15] symbol
[34:16] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[34:18] and understand all mysteries
[34:19] and all knowledge and though i have all
[34:21] faith so that i can
[34:22] remove mountains and have not love i am
[34:26] nothing and though i bestow all my goods
[34:29] to feed the poor
[34:30] and though i give my body to be burned
[34:32] and have not charity
[34:33] it profiteth me nothing
[34:37] he went through great lengths to explain
[34:39] to us that we're a body and in that body
[34:41] not all members of your body have the
[34:43] same job they don't have the same office
[34:45] they don't function in the same way
[34:47] but yet we're very satisfied that each
[34:49] portion is there
[34:51] we're very happy that a finger does what
[34:53] a finger does and a toe what a
[34:54] does a toe and a heart and a liver and
[34:57] all of these things we're very satisfied
[34:59] with the way god has constructed things
[35:00] that every part is necessary
[35:02] amen in fact we give abundant more honor
[35:05] to that part which lacketh like if we're
[35:07] lacking something
[35:08] amen that's the part that we really
[35:09] would like to have if i'm missing an arm
[35:11] i would love to have an arm
[35:13] so so we've been fashioned this way we
[35:16] don't all have the same gift we don't
[35:18] all
[35:18] operate the same way we don't have the
[35:20] same administrations in the same
[35:22] operations we don't have all of these
[35:23] things the same way
[35:25] amen but but that's the way god designed
[35:27] the body of christ so that every member
[35:29] is a joint that supplieth
[35:31] but he says do all speak with tongues do
[35:33] all this to all but i
[35:34] i say covet earnestly the best gives but
[35:37] i show you a more excellent way
[35:40] let love be the motivation let the love
[35:42] of god and love of the
[35:44] brethren love of the bride of christ be
[35:45] the motivation for us to find our place
[35:48] and to work in our place it's not about
[35:50] a position
[35:53] if when i'm talking about play sons i
[35:55] really want to get down to
[35:56] it's not so much about a position amen
[35:58] as it is about
[36:00] the love of god he said what do you mean
[36:03] because anything i do i do for him amen
[36:05] any position he gives me i i give back
[36:08] any skill talent ability everything
[36:11] health whatever he gives me i give back
[36:13] to him because i love him amen i serve
[36:15] because i love him
[36:16] i'm not here to hold a position because
[36:18] i need a title or i need some the
[36:20] accolades that come with a title or a
[36:22] position or a gift or a calling
[36:24] amen i'm here to do what he calls me to
[36:26] do when he calls me to do it because of
[36:28] love
[36:30] and i'll give myself for the body amen
[36:33] because that
[36:34] body is him on earth amen and if i love
[36:37] him
[36:37] and i don't love my brethren then i'm a
[36:39] liar if i say that i love him but i
[36:41] don't love the brethren i'm a liar
[36:43] so i give my gift freely i give my
[36:46] ability my time my strength
[36:47] amen we give it to one another freely
[36:50] because of
[36:52] charity amen
[36:54] sometimes we see abuses they men of
[36:56] gifts
[36:58] people individuals with gifts and men
[37:01] and they they don't realize that gift is
[37:03] operated by love and the gift is not
[37:07] it's not a
[37:08] hierarchy you know it's not a
[37:12] it's not a system of ranks or degrees
[37:16] or stars or merits or or stripes
[37:22] i'm two stripes i'm a deacon
[37:26] someday i'll be three stripes and be a
[37:28] trustee
[37:30] four stripes song lyric you know that's
[37:33] carnal thinking
[37:35] we've got to erase that sometimes i
[37:36] wonder in the judgment of rewards
[37:40] i wonder if it won't be shocking
[37:42] sometimes
[37:45] and so i mean i think you know once we
[37:47] get to the judgment of rewards there'll
[37:49] be no jealousy there'll be no envy
[37:50] there'll be no strife there'll be no
[37:51] hatred
[37:52] because the judgment of rewards is for
[37:54] those who've been redeemed and raptured
[37:55] and their bodies have been changed
[37:57] so there's not going to be any of that
[37:58] but i still think it could be a little
[38:00] amazing
[38:02] when somebody who seemingly did so much
[38:05] upon the earth and had
[38:06] such a a ministry you know maybe a
[38:08] worldwide ministry or a gift to write so
[38:10] many songs or
[38:11] are seeing like like something and got
[38:14] all kinds of praise and accolades we're
[38:16] told all the time how wonderful they
[38:17] were doing serving everybody
[38:20] but i wonder if there may not be a shock
[38:22] at the judgment of rewards
[38:23] when the one when the widow who put the
[38:25] widow's might in receives abundantly
[38:28] overflowing
[38:29] way more than the one who appeared to be
[38:31] doing great works upon the earth
[38:33] [Music]
[38:35] because to whom much is given much is
[38:36] required
[38:38] amen so if you're given much in the way
[38:40] of talent or ability
[38:42] then much is required amen and now you
[38:45] can't
[38:45] you know some people in certain areas
[38:48] can do more with half effort than others
[38:50] can with their whole efforts
[38:53] but when it comes to the judgment of
[38:54] rewards amen god's going to judge
[38:57] according to the mode of intention of
[38:59] the heart
[38:59] amen and what he gave us and what we did
[39:02] with what he gave us
[39:05] and so i'm i'm i'm anxious to see
[39:10] the widow who gave the widow's mind
[39:14] or the brother or sister who spent hours
[39:16] in prayer and intercessory prayer for
[39:18] brothers and sisters and never
[39:19] nobody else knew about it on the
[39:22] judgment of rewards
[39:24] when christ heaps upon them rewards i
[39:26] think we'll
[39:27] all whistle and shout and rejoice
[39:30] because we'll see the equity of god amen
[39:32] we'll see the perfect judgment of jesus
[39:34] christ
[39:35] amen we won't be jealous we won't be
[39:37] envious we won't even be ashamed
[39:40] you realize that we won't be you won't
[39:42] be ashamed that she got more and you got
[39:44] less and
[39:44] he got more you won't be ashamed because
[39:47] you've come to a
[39:48] perfect understanding you've come to a
[39:50] perfect body hybridization carnality
[39:52] self-will
[39:53] self-love will be gone and you'll be
[39:55] like oh yeah lord that was good
[39:57] she deserved all of that give her more
[40:00] lord give her more
[40:03] give him more lord and when god gives
[40:04] you your portion you'll say
[40:06] yes lord i didn't even deserve this but
[40:08] thank you lord
[40:10] but sometimes i wonder when we get to
[40:12] that judgment of rewards
[40:13] they're going to be a true equity like
[40:16] we have never seen on the face of this
[40:17] earth a true judgment a true
[40:19] righteousness
[40:20] a true equity god will reward
[40:24] and so i i long for that
[40:28] i long for that i long i would long for
[40:31] uh me to be able to move away from
[40:34] carnality in a greater way
[40:37] to where i could just do things out of a
[40:39] pure heart of love
[40:41] i long for that in myself i long for the
[40:45] freedom
[40:46] to get away from uh from
[40:49] fear or worry about people's opinions or
[40:53] or or being misunderstood or any of
[40:57] those
[40:57] carnal things that trouble us in our
[40:59] mind i'd love to move away
[41:01] and just with a pure heart of love do
[41:03] exactly what he calls me to do
[41:05] whether it's noticed or not noticed with
[41:07] anybody ever knows it or doesn't know it
[41:09] whether it's big or small seemingly in
[41:11] our eyes whether it gets you know
[41:13] great recognition or no recognition
[41:14] where it brings back a great reward or
[41:16] no reward i just want to have a pure
[41:18] heart of love give exactly what he's
[41:20] called me to give
[41:22] and i know god keeps good records i'm
[41:24] not worried about that he'll take care
[41:25] of that i just want to give what he's
[41:27] calling for
[41:29] with pure mode of pure intention of pure
[41:31] heart
[41:33] brother bram said in the message
[41:34] influence
[41:36] he says we notice we got so many billy
[41:39] grahams today
[41:40] but you see god never made but won billy
[41:42] graham
[41:44] that's all and you just as you're just
[41:47] as important as billy graham oral
[41:48] roberts or any of those famous men
[41:50] you're just as important until you get
[41:52] out of your place and then you're no
[41:54] good at all
[41:55] [Music]
[41:57] i love that i'd like to bring this home
[42:00] but i'm not going to
[42:02] because i could start naming names we
[42:05] just talk about
[42:06] our brothers and sisters in the message
[42:08] starting naming ministers or
[42:09] our great singers or all this and i'll
[42:11] say you're just as important as brother
[42:12] so and so and immediately mine would go
[42:14] well i haven't done what he's done and i
[42:15] don't have a gift like that
[42:18] you're just as important as sister this
[42:20] or that
[42:21] and immediately our minds we start this
[42:25] judging and that's where we air jesus
[42:27] said you air judging yourself among
[42:28] yourselves
[42:30] measuring up to one another we don't
[42:32] measure up to one another we measure up
[42:34] to the word amen
[42:35] we measure up to the will of god as
[42:37] planned in our life amen in our ability
[42:39] to surrender that we do not measure up
[42:41] to one another
[42:44] an immediate i could name names if i
[42:46] start naming names
[42:48] i'm not going to don't get nervous
[42:51] you're like no i mean no that's a great
[42:53] but oh no that's an amazing system no
[42:56] so when brother ben says billy graham we
[42:59] get what he's saying but bring it home
[43:03] you're just as important you're
[43:04] predestinated to be conformed into the
[43:07] image of the son
[43:10] you've been predestinated unto adoption
[43:13] predestined to adoption what's adoption
[43:15] the placing of a sign
[43:16] a position that god had for you a work
[43:18] for you to do something for you to
[43:19] accomplish for his will
[43:20] from before the foundation of the world
[43:22] you've been predestinated unto
[43:24] placing a son to your position
[43:27] and nobody else can take that position
[43:29] said
[43:30] any of you he says you're just as
[43:32] important as billy graham or roberts any
[43:33] of those famous men
[43:35] you're just as important until you get
[43:36] out of your place and then you're no
[43:38] good at all
[43:40] you're a hindrance to those men and
[43:43] you're a hindrance to yourself
[43:44] and the kingdom of god stay in your
[43:46] position stay what god made you
[43:48] and see then you'll operate right as
[43:52] paul is not
[43:53] paul as paul it's not nothing new paul
[43:56] taught the same thing said
[43:57] if your hand shall say to the eye
[43:59] because i'm not of the eye or the ears
[44:01] say to the nose
[44:02] i'll no more be an ear because i'm not
[44:04] the nose or something
[44:05] you can't do that see it all fitly sets
[44:08] together and moves as one great union
[44:11] and we mustn't try to impersonate anyone
[44:13] just be what you
[44:14] are see and that's the way god made you
[44:16] you never fashioned yourself and
[44:18] remember
[44:19] as much as we ministers would like to
[44:21] take billy graham's place
[44:22] we cannot do it neither can billy graham
[44:24] take your place
[44:25] see we each one has something to do the
[44:28] common little fellow here and
[44:29] maybe a janitor the little woman that
[44:31] may be a housewife
[44:32] the greatest minister on the face of the
[44:34] earth could today
[44:36] could not take your place you god had a
[44:39] purpose in making you what you are
[44:41] and you just served god in the way that
[44:43] he made you see
[44:44] and i think if you would just do that
[44:46] the wheels would roll a lot easier
[44:49] yes it would if we would do that not and
[44:52] not get lifted up
[44:54] see it's not in order for me to really
[44:57] make
[44:58] progress my body's got to function
[45:02] every joint must supply and it doesn't
[45:05] matter
[45:06] how well my brain is working if my
[45:08] nervous system is not working with the
[45:10] brain
[45:10] if it takes a day off the brain may be
[45:13] fine but the body's doing nothing
[45:16] right white blood cells organ liver
[45:20] filters i mean
[45:21] how many people you think about your
[45:22] liver
[45:24] and the function it does on a daily
[45:26] basis but it wouldn't take very long for
[45:28] you to realize it took the day off
[45:31] two days off three days off and then
[45:32] you're dead
[45:34] so this is the example we have in the
[45:36] scripture and brother i was talking
[45:37] about this we
[45:38] the wheels would roll a lot better if we
[45:40] would just all stay in what god made us
[45:42] and stay with what god gave us and
[45:44] whatever he puts in our hand
[45:46] whatever it is it doesn't matter i mean
[45:48] it doesn't matter if it
[45:49] seems insignificant to you or i if he
[45:52] put it in your hand for you to do
[45:53] do it with all your mind amen do it unto
[45:56] the lord
[45:56] do it with pure love in your heart do it
[45:58] for your brothers and sisters
[46:01] and then the wheels will roll a lot
[46:02] faster
[46:05] let's turn to galatians i'm still laying
[46:08] a foundation
[46:10] galatians 1 doing a little review and
[46:13] then we'll jump into where i want to be
[46:22] galatians chapter 1 verse 13.
[46:25] paul's speaking here he says for you
[46:28] have heard of my conversation in time
[46:30] past in the jews religion
[46:32] how that beyond measure i persecuted the
[46:34] church of god and wasted it
[46:35] and profited in the jews religion above
[46:37] my
[46:38] many mind equals in my own nation being
[46:40] more exceedingly zealous of the
[46:42] traditions of my father
[46:43] but when it pleased god who separated me
[46:46] from my mother's womb
[46:48] how did paul come on this earth
[46:52] by the will of mother and father by the
[46:53] will of god
[46:55] who separated him from his mother's womb
[46:57] it was god who separated from his
[46:59] mother's womb
[47:00] and when paul was doing all that paul
[47:02] was doing god knew all about it because
[47:04] it was god who had separated him from
[47:06] his mother's womb
[47:08] but he says but when it pleased god who
[47:11] separated me from my mother's womb
[47:12] and called me by his grace to reveal
[47:16] his son in me then i might preach him
[47:19] among the heathen immediately i confer
[47:21] not with flesh and blood
[47:22] so the whole point that i want to draw
[47:24] out of that is the fact that god
[47:26] knew paul's birth god knew when he would
[47:28] come on the earth
[47:29] god knew he would be the messenger to
[47:31] the first church age he knew he'd be the
[47:32] apostle to the gentiles he knew he'd be
[47:34] the enlightened to the gentiles
[47:36] god knew what where he was he knew what
[47:39] he was doing
[47:40] and he knew exactly in this program when
[47:41] to inject himself and pull paul out of
[47:43] that
[47:45] saul at that time he separated from the
[47:47] mother's womb and called him by his
[47:49] grace
[47:49] amen it wasn't paul's uh it wasn't his
[47:53] great ability
[47:54] in the jews religion that said oh god
[47:56] says you know that's a man i could use
[47:59] paul was ashamed of the way he acted
[48:02] before he was ashamed
[48:04] of how wrong he was and how he rejected
[48:06] christ and what he had done
[48:07] he wasn't looking at that looking back
[48:09] saying you know because i was zealous
[48:10] and i did all these things
[48:12] god says oh man that's a man if i can
[48:14] get him on my side he could really do
[48:15] something for me
[48:17] but paul had to go out and unlearn all
[48:19] of that and count it as dung so he could
[48:20] finally do something
[48:21] for which he was born and placed on this
[48:23] earth to do
[48:26] his gift was misplaced his efforts were
[48:28] in the wrong spot
[48:29] his zeal was was misguided but god was
[48:32] going to bring him back home by
[48:34] his grace not by paul's effort but by
[48:36] his grace
[48:38] brother beam says in adoption part 3
[48:40] from 1960
[48:42] and then god gave his children new birth
[48:44] by the baptism of the holy spirit
[48:45] they came right near it when they
[48:47] cleansed themselves up in the nazarene
[48:49] pilgrim holiness
[48:50] then came into the experience of
[48:51] pentecost at the baptism of the holy
[48:53] ghost the restoration of the gifts
[48:55] they went for speaking with tongues and
[48:57] interpreting tongues and
[48:58] giving gifts of healing and miracles and
[49:00] signs and wonders begin to accompany
[49:02] them
[49:02] now their children now their children
[49:06] they're god's children they're
[49:07] positionally in christ they become
[49:09] children by birth and the new birth and
[49:12] the conversion itself is the holy ghost
[49:14] so i say this to to back up on something
[49:16] i said last time
[49:18] uh i've heard it taught before that that
[49:20] that you're converted and you're saved
[49:22] and then you work your way up to the
[49:23] baptism of the holy ghost but brother
[49:25] branham is tying those two things
[49:26] together
[49:28] at the beginning and then you're a
[49:29] newborn babe amen amen and then you grow
[49:32] into adoption
[49:33] into a placing but you don't you don't
[49:35] you're not saved and converted you're
[49:37] converted when you receive the baptism
[49:38] of the holy ghost
[49:41] and then you grow into adoption
[49:44] you're not brother says you're not even
[49:46] converted till you get the holy ghost
[49:49] so you can't say you're converted
[49:51] without the baptism holy ghost how are
[49:53] you going to get the baptism in the holy
[49:54] ghost without the word
[49:56] without the message of the hour how will
[49:58] you get the baptism holy ghost
[50:01] how will you have how will you have the
[50:02] evidence of the baptism of the holy
[50:04] ghost without the word for your age
[50:07] how will you have a word birth without
[50:08] the word
[50:11] how will that word for your age wake up
[50:14] a seed for your age if you haven't heard
[50:15] the word for your age
[50:18] so you're not even converted till you
[50:20] get the holy ghost that's what the
[50:22] scripture said jesus told peter when now
[50:24] are converted
[50:26] so so i just want to reinforce that
[50:28] because i've heard it taught before and
[50:30] for years i
[50:31] i misunderstood myself because you can
[50:33] see things brother ben says and you can
[50:34] lean it this way and lean it that way
[50:36] he says it like this it says it like
[50:37] that but he's really clear on this point
[50:40] that the new birth your conversion is
[50:43] the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:45] and then you're just started that's not
[50:47] the finish line you just started you're
[50:49] a newborn babe in christ
[50:50] and you grow up in christ
[50:54] let's read it in romans 8 again romans
[50:56] chapter 8
[50:57] let's read this scripture to reinforce
[50:59] this point
[51:05] romans chapter 8
[51:12] verse 15.
[51:15] romans 8 and 15 for you have not
[51:18] received the spirit of bondage again to
[51:20] fear
[51:22] but you have received the spirit of
[51:23] adoption whereby we cry
[51:26] abba father the spirit of adoption
[51:29] is what brings you into adoption
[51:32] you receive the spirit of adoption the
[51:34] baptism holy ghost a new birth
[51:36] and the spirit of adoption will bring
[51:38] you although it's the governor it's the
[51:40] tutor it's the instructor
[51:42] that brings you all the way into
[51:43] adoption to your place in christ jesus
[51:47] so let's read that again for you have
[51:49] not received the spirit of bondage again
[51:50] to fear but you have received the spirit
[51:52] of adoption
[51:53] whereby we cry abba father the spirit
[51:55] itself bearing witness with our spirit
[51:57] that we are the children of god
[52:00] amen let that sink in deep
[52:04] now let's move on from there i've laid
[52:07] all these pieces together as a
[52:08] foundation i want to start building on
[52:09] of that today
[52:11] uh because i want to start talking about
[52:13] the this is a
[52:14] play suns part three but i want to start
[52:16] talking about the power
[52:18] that comes with position the power of
[52:19] your position
[52:21] and i don't care what position it is
[52:22] there's a power that comes with position
[52:26] let's look at the message influence from
[52:28] 63
[52:29] now we find out though a good man
[52:31] blessed of god
[52:33] but if god blesses you stay in the
[52:35] category that god has blessed you in
[52:38] if it's a housewife remain a housewife
[52:41] if it's a business remain in that
[52:43] business reflecting god
[52:45] and whatever god has called you to let
[52:46] it be that because he wants you to be a
[52:49] real housewife to reflect your influence
[52:51] upon another person
[52:52] that wants to be a good housewife well
[52:55] he made it so simple
[52:57] i mean what am i doing here what am i
[52:59] you're influencing this is the message
[53:01] influence
[53:02] you're influencing somebody else's life
[53:04] amen just work in the calling
[53:06] amen give your whole heart we got to
[53:07] give our whole selves to the calling
[53:09] where
[53:09] we've been called so he says if you're a
[53:12] good businessman
[53:14] let your life so be that it will reflect
[53:16] jesus christ in your business with
[53:18] honesty and integrity
[53:19] and with the things that really mean
[53:21] something because somebody is watching
[53:23] your life
[53:24] you're influencing somebody god has to
[53:26] have a real housewife
[53:28] god has to have a real teenage in school
[53:30] god has to have a real minister
[53:32] a real businessman somebody that will
[53:34] reflect him because there they see
[53:36] in you christ no matter what the rest of
[53:38] the world has got to do
[53:40] that has not one thing to do with you or
[53:42] i we are responsible to god for
[53:44] our lives and for our experience with
[53:46] christ
[53:47] he goes on to say in adoption part three
[53:50] he says
[53:51] what am i talking about here at branham
[53:53] tabernacle you've had your chance
[53:55] when a man once is anointed with the
[53:56] holy ghost to be adopted into the family
[53:58] of god
[53:59] to be positionally placed by the father
[54:01] and set into a service out there
[54:03] into his purpose of life or what god is
[54:06] calling for
[54:07] his walk must be holy holy holy unto the
[54:10] lord
[54:11] holy holy holy oh you you must turn
[54:14] aside to this
[54:15] holy holy holy unto the lord oh you must
[54:18] believe all that elder said this
[54:20] but holy holy holy unto the lord let his
[54:24] word be first
[54:25] let it be everything that there is and
[54:26] settled in your heart your walk
[54:28] must be in the word holy holy
[54:32] unto the lord see when we're called and
[54:34] positionally placed
[54:36] we're called amen to take that position
[54:39] by the word
[54:40] like we said before you may have been
[54:42] married before
[54:43] your conversion but but before your
[54:45] conversion you were just trying to be a
[54:47] good husband trying to be a good wife
[54:49] you were just living by the world
[54:51] standards doing what you could to be
[54:52] good to one another
[54:53] but after your conversion amen then
[54:55] you're you're called to be
[54:57] a mental word husband a word wife a word
[55:00] mother a word father
[55:01] a word teenage in school brother benham
[55:05] going to realize if we could just look
[55:07] at ourselves as as
[55:08] as as doing what god called us to do
[55:11] completing his life upon this earth
[55:13] amen he he fulfilled in his earthly
[55:15] journey the portion that he was
[55:17] supposed to fulfill but he said he left
[55:19] a portion
[55:21] and that is to be fulfilled in and
[55:23] through the bride
[55:25] so there's a portion that's already
[55:27] fulfilled but there's a portion left
[55:29] yet unfulfilled that we in this life are
[55:32] supposed to fulfill
[55:33] and he wants to be known as a body he
[55:36] wants to be known in body form
[55:38] many member body form so he's got to
[55:41] have somebody that will take their place
[55:43] as a son not just the son of god but a
[55:46] son in a house
[55:47] under a natural father to be a daughter
[55:51] to be a daughter of a mother to be a
[55:52] daughter to show what a god daughter is
[55:55] like
[55:56] you realize he needs a teenage in school
[55:58] to show what jesus christ was like when
[56:00] he was a teenager walking 2
[56:02] 000 years ago he needs an obedient child
[56:05] at 12 years old that would subject
[56:07] himself to joseph and his mother
[56:11] so that so that this life this world can
[56:13] see what a 12 year old jesus christ was
[56:15] like because there's going to be a 12
[56:16] year old on this planet that's
[56:18] demonstrating what the life of jesus
[56:19] christ was like then
[56:22] in obedience to a father why does it
[56:23] matter if i obey mom and dad
[56:25] because you're called to live the life
[56:27] of jesus christ in your flesh now and if
[56:30] you're a 12 year old and a 13 you're on
[56:32] a 14
[56:32] wherever you're at you're called to
[56:34] manifest jesus christ at that age
[56:37] and when jesus christ was 12 years old
[56:39] he was subject to his parents
[56:43] when jesus christ was a teenager what do
[56:45] you think his life was like
[56:48] amen so now we're here in this life amen
[56:52] our position wherever he's put us
[56:54] wherever he has placed us
[56:55] wherever we're at in whatever age
[56:57] whatever gender whatever rank whatever
[56:59] file whatever
[57:00] job and occupation and status in life
[57:02] married
[57:03] single widowed widower retired working
[57:06] it doesn't matter what the title is this
[57:09] is a place that god before the
[57:10] foundation of the world
[57:12] saw us and he wants to be manifest
[57:16] through us in that position
[57:21] praise god and if that's god's plan
[57:26] if that's god's will amen then tell me
[57:29] what can stop that will
[57:32] some devil bringing sickness some devil
[57:35] bringing confusion some devil bringing
[57:37] strife
[57:37] can it stop that no that's god's plan
[57:42] see brother branham says in
[57:46] in questions and answers from 61
[57:50] look what it puts me before when i'm up
[57:52] there before the public look at that
[57:54] what about one error on that see because
[57:57] i trust him
[57:58] i trust him someone say are you afraid
[58:00] to make a mistake brother branham
[58:01] no no i ain't afraid of a mistake i
[58:04] believe him
[58:05] he's my protection i'm ordained to do
[58:08] this
[58:09] so i'll stay right there
[58:12] you know brother branham what he was
[58:14] doing was risky
[58:16] calling a prayer line all the sick
[58:19] people in wheelchairs cots and all of
[58:21] this
[58:21] and they're asking are you afraid
[58:23] basically are you afraid that it won't
[58:24] work
[58:24] you'll make a mistake in discernment are
[58:26] you afraid you'll discern and you'll
[58:27] discern wrong and everybody out there
[58:29] will say oh he got that wrong
[58:30] he says why would be i be afraid i'm
[58:32] ordained to do this
[58:35] brother didn't put himself in that
[58:36] position he didn't choose it for himself
[58:38] he didn't make all the circumstances
[58:40] work out so he could be standing there
[58:42] he was ordained by god to stand there so
[58:44] he know it wasn't him
[58:46] the discernment wasn't him amen it was
[58:49] it was christ in him
[58:50] it was god amen working through his
[58:52] flesh he was so
[58:53] certain that he had with a seventh grade
[58:55] education growing up in kentucky
[58:57] finishing his growing up in southern
[58:59] indiana
[59:00] when nobody but the local people in the
[59:02] local town knew who he was
[59:05] ministering amen just a small ministry a
[59:08] revival just in his local town
[59:10] started a pastor in a dinky little
[59:12] church
[59:13] on the corner of eighth and penn street
[59:16] how did a man with no education
[59:18] no denomination no no coordination
[59:20] amongst ministers no financial backing
[59:24] how did he get a worldwide ministry with
[59:26] a gift of discernment displayed
[59:28] on a platform why would he be afraid he
[59:30] had nothing to do with himself being on
[59:32] that platform
[59:34] he had nothing to do with the gift of
[59:36] discernment if god's given you ability
[59:38] to sing
[59:38] amen and sing for his glory or to write
[59:40] a song or to preach a sermon
[59:42] or do whatever he's called you to do
[59:44] don't be afraid in that thing because
[59:46] you didn't give it to yourself god gave
[59:48] it to you
[59:49] if you can just surrender it to him amen
[59:51] you don't have to be afraid
[59:53] amen and i don't have to be afraid that
[59:56] that i'm going to sing this i'm going to
[59:57] mess up
[59:58] sing it for the glory of the lord
[1:00:00] [Music]
[1:00:01] i'm afraid i'm afraid to get up there
[1:00:03] and preach i'm afraid i'll trip over my
[1:00:05] feet
[1:00:05] i've done that enough that you should be
[1:00:07] fine by now
[1:00:12] brother branham did it enough we should
[1:00:13] all be okay with that
[1:00:18] see if god's called us to do something i
[1:00:20] mean if god
[1:00:23] if god has called you to be a wife
[1:00:27] don't start saying what if i'm not a
[1:00:28] good wife what if i may
[1:00:30] call you to be a husband what if i if
[1:00:33] that if
[1:00:33] if you're walking in the footsteps of
[1:00:35] the lord you believe your footsteps are
[1:00:36] ordained of the lord
[1:00:37] and if that's your next step take it
[1:00:39] with confidence if god's bringing a baby
[1:00:41] into your life
[1:00:42] and all of a sudden you've got turmoil
[1:00:43] about would i be a good mother would i
[1:00:45] be a good father am i able to do this
[1:00:47] if god has allowed it erase all the fear
[1:00:49] and say god has
[1:00:50] called me to be a mother god has called
[1:00:52] me to be a father
[1:00:54] god has called me to be a grandfather
[1:00:57] husband wife brother sister
[1:01:00] laborer a mechanic technic whatever
[1:01:03] god has called me to this
[1:01:06] we've got to let the scare go away
[1:01:09] because that's just the natural part of
[1:01:11] humanity
[1:01:12] will it be there yes but you got to push
[1:01:14] against it
[1:01:16] you can't just i mean you can't just be
[1:01:18] like well i mean i've never been nervous
[1:01:20] a day in my life i knew what i was
[1:01:22] called to
[1:01:23] then you're not a human being
[1:01:26] but you've got to push those things
[1:01:28] aside and say god called me to this
[1:01:31] i'm not doing this for myself
[1:01:34] you know so many times i think we lose
[1:01:37] confidence in what we're doing because
[1:01:38] we know our own selfish motives
[1:01:41] i worked it out i made it happen i got
[1:01:43] this and i strive for that
[1:01:45] but if we could just relax and let god
[1:01:47] take charge and you find yourself in
[1:01:49] places you never expected to be
[1:01:50] you find yourself and you realize the
[1:01:52] footsteps of the lord or righteousness
[1:01:54] or lord i didn't get here because of my
[1:01:56] skill i didn't get here because
[1:01:57] because i i'm so wise i saw three steps
[1:02:00] down the road and i mean plans
[1:02:01] i'm in this position because god put me
[1:02:03] in this wherever you are
[1:02:06] whatever family you were born into
[1:02:09] if you're a child amen if you're if
[1:02:11] you're a child living at home
[1:02:12] you're in the place god wanted you to be
[1:02:15] now you must live in that position as
[1:02:17] jesus christ would live in
[1:02:18] without fear oh because my family's this
[1:02:21] and my family's dad things won't work
[1:02:23] out
[1:02:23] god knows what house you're going to be
[1:02:25] in he separated
[1:02:26] saul from his mother's womb he watched
[1:02:30] over him
[1:02:30] waiting for the time that he was going
[1:02:31] to pull him into his commission
[1:02:34] you know god's not god's not worried
[1:02:37] about where you are
[1:02:40] your family status or or your
[1:02:42] educational status or
[1:02:44] or your whatever it might be god's not
[1:02:47] worried about that
[1:02:48] he has designed it friends he's allowed
[1:02:50] it things are
[1:02:51] permitted to be the way they are so that
[1:02:53] he can get the ultimate glory
[1:02:57] i said before i come from a broken home
[1:03:00] multiple breakings and re-breakings
[1:03:03] statistically
[1:03:08] i should have a broken home
[1:03:11] but god put me where i am there is no
[1:03:13] statistic
[1:03:14] for that
[1:03:18] you may have you may have breast cancer
[1:03:20] that runs in your family from great
[1:03:21] grandma to grandma i got three aunts
[1:03:23] with and that
[1:03:24] that has nothing to do with you you stay
[1:03:26] in god's position
[1:03:27] and you don't accept those things
[1:03:28] because god has called you
[1:03:31] i'm a daughter he wanted me born in this
[1:03:33] family that doesn't mean i have to
[1:03:34] accept all of that this is my position
[1:03:36] this is where i am and i'm not going to
[1:03:38] let the fear of those things torment me
[1:03:41] you say mental health runs in my family
[1:03:43] then let mental health run through the
[1:03:44] rest of the family but not through your
[1:03:46] you're part of that family
[1:03:49] you understand don't be fearful where
[1:03:52] god but you have confidence god put me
[1:03:54] here
[1:03:54] if god put me here to overcome breast
[1:03:56] cancer cancer then i'll overcome it
[1:03:59] if god put me here amen to overcome some
[1:04:02] emotional disorder
[1:04:04] or some mental disease amen if god put
[1:04:06] me here for that then he's going to have
[1:04:07] victory through me but he knows where he
[1:04:09] put me and i'm not afraid of where he
[1:04:10] put me
[1:04:14] brother brennan was born under into an
[1:04:17] alcoholic
[1:04:19] his father was an alcoholic he helped
[1:04:22] his dad
[1:04:23] make the moonshine
[1:04:26] and his dad kept trying to get him to
[1:04:28] drink
[1:04:31] you can't get a worse situation than
[1:04:33] that friends
[1:04:35] but god knew where he was god watched
[1:04:38] over his gift
[1:04:39] god took care of his seed
[1:04:43] see once we realize who we are
[1:04:48] when that's awakened in us all the scare
[1:04:51] goes away
[1:04:52] all the fear just subsides just fight it
[1:04:55] back god knows the path i take he knows
[1:04:57] the way that i take
[1:04:59] he knows the plans that he has for me he
[1:05:01] knows what he's trying to accomplish
[1:05:03] and i want to be i want to have faith
[1:05:05] and i want to be bold and i want to have
[1:05:07] confidence in the place he's put me
[1:05:12] i want to finish this quote from
[1:05:13] questions and answers
[1:05:15] he said are you afraid you'll make a
[1:05:17] mistake brother baby said oh no no
[1:05:19] i ain't afraid of mistake i believe him
[1:05:20] he's my protection i'm ordained to do
[1:05:23] this
[1:05:23] so i'll stay right there if god's
[1:05:26] ordained you to do something
[1:05:27] then he's your protection see he will
[1:05:31] protect you if he sent you
[1:05:32] he'll back up your word you're an
[1:05:34] ambassador then you're an ambassador
[1:05:35] with the gift of tongues you're an
[1:05:36] ambassador with the gift of
[1:05:37] interpretation you're an ambassador with
[1:05:39] the gift of discernment
[1:05:40] the three of you see see what i mean
[1:05:42] then what have you got
[1:05:43] you got a solid church see if god's
[1:05:46] called you then god will back you up
[1:05:49] you don't have to prove anything you
[1:05:50] don't have to convince people you don't
[1:05:51] have to
[1:05:52] you don't have to you don't have to put
[1:05:53] an army of supporters together
[1:05:55] amen if god has called you he'll back
[1:05:57] your word up
[1:05:58] god has called you to a gift he'll back
[1:06:00] that gift up as god has called you to an
[1:06:02] office he'll back you up in that office
[1:06:04] wherever god has called you he'll back
[1:06:05] you up in that
[1:06:09] i mean you there's all these things i
[1:06:12] mean there's
[1:06:13] there's so a part of our life that
[1:06:16] that we don't realize the natural things
[1:06:19] that we're called to
[1:06:20] are part of god's expression and
[1:06:23] sometimes we want to separate spiritual
[1:06:25] things from natural things
[1:06:26] but if you're a child of god how can you
[1:06:28] separate spiritual things from natural
[1:06:30] things
[1:06:32] there's no separation in our occupation
[1:06:35] and in our education and in our family
[1:06:37] life at home and
[1:06:38] there's no separation from the spirit of
[1:06:40] god from natural things
[1:06:42] because while you're doing natural
[1:06:43] things it's the spirit of god alive
[1:06:44] inside of you it's the seed of god
[1:06:46] that's sprung to life it's a portion of
[1:06:48] god himself living in this tabernacle or
[1:06:50] flesh
[1:06:50] how are you going to separate the
[1:06:52] spiritual and the natural
[1:06:54] well this is just my natural work but my
[1:06:56] spiritual work is you better make your
[1:06:57] natural work your spiritual work
[1:07:02] because in that natural world god put
[1:07:03] you in contact with individuals
[1:07:05] he put your life on display in certain
[1:07:07] ways there's certain things he's trying
[1:07:09] to get out
[1:07:10] of that situation amen people you talk
[1:07:12] to people who see you
[1:07:14] people who interact with you amen the
[1:07:16] way you carry yourself the reputation
[1:07:18] that you carry
[1:07:19] it's all god wanting to be on display
[1:07:23] so we got to quit separating and
[1:07:25] categorizing our life
[1:07:27] well this part is natural this is carnal
[1:07:29] this is spiritual
[1:07:30] this is my spiritual gift this is my
[1:07:32] natural gift
[1:07:35] make your natural gift your spiritual
[1:07:37] gift be a
[1:07:39] son or daughter of god and whatever you
[1:07:41] do
[1:07:44] said but i said are you afraid he's my
[1:07:46] protection
[1:07:49] he's my protection i'm ordained to do
[1:07:52] this
[1:07:53] so i'll stay right here
[1:07:56] i've i've heard people before you know
[1:08:00] they'll express
[1:08:01] they're nervous you know if if if their
[1:08:03] husband now
[1:08:04] he gets called up to be a deacon or a
[1:08:07] trustee or
[1:08:08] a preacher and all of a sudden the wife
[1:08:09] would become nervous but i don't know if
[1:08:11] i could be a preacher's wife
[1:08:13] a good a good preacher's wife i don't
[1:08:15] know if i could be a good deacon's wife
[1:08:18] well if you're married to that man and
[1:08:21] god called that man then you're a good
[1:08:22] preacher's wife
[1:08:24] you're a good deacon you're you're
[1:08:26] whatever if you're supposed to support
[1:08:28] that man
[1:08:29] amen and whatever god god calls that man
[1:08:31] to do then you are
[1:08:32] tailor made for that position have
[1:08:36] confidence have faith amen don't don't
[1:08:38] doubt where god has placed you because
[1:08:40] when we start with these doubts and
[1:08:41] these questions
[1:08:42] we start to pull back from what god has
[1:08:44] called us to do and what god has called
[1:08:45] us to be
[1:08:47] we start to question ourselves and our
[1:08:49] abilities
[1:08:50] we start to say things like i can and i
[1:08:52] and i can't
[1:08:53] well of course you can't
[1:08:57] that's good he can
[1:09:00] he'll never ask you to do something that
[1:09:03] he won't
[1:09:04] that he will not give you the ability to
[1:09:06] do
[1:09:08] let's look at first samuel let's go all
[1:09:10] the way back and look at first samuel i
[1:09:12] want to look at a couple examples in the
[1:09:18] scripture
[1:09:21] first samuel 17.
[1:09:32] first samuel 17 and 34.
[1:09:38] we all know the story so well but i
[1:09:39] can't help but read it
[1:09:41] and david said unto saul thy servant
[1:09:43] kept his father sheep and there came a
[1:09:45] lion
[1:09:46] and a bear and took a lamb out of the
[1:09:48] flock
[1:09:49] and i went out after him and smote him
[1:09:51] and delivered it out of his mouth
[1:09:53] and when he arose against me i caught
[1:09:55] him by his beard and smote him
[1:09:57] and slew him thy servant slew both the
[1:10:00] lion
[1:10:00] and the bear and this uncircumcised
[1:10:03] philistine shall be as one of them
[1:10:05] seeing he hath defied the armies of the
[1:10:08] living god
[1:10:10] david said moreover the lord that
[1:10:12] delivered me out of the paul the lion
[1:10:14] and out of the paw of the bear
[1:10:15] he will deliver me out of the hand of
[1:10:17] the philistine and saul said unto david
[1:10:19] go
[1:10:19] and thy lord be with thee and saul armed
[1:10:22] david with his armor and he put
[1:10:24] put on a helmet of brass upon his head
[1:10:26] as he armed him with a coat of mail
[1:10:28] and david girded his sword upon his arm
[1:10:30] when he has saved to go for he had not
[1:10:32] proved
[1:10:32] him and david said unto saul i cannot go
[1:10:35] with these for i have not proved them
[1:10:37] and david put them off him and he took a
[1:10:39] staff in his hand and chose him five
[1:10:41] smooth stones out of the brook
[1:10:43] and put them in a shepherd's bag which
[1:10:45] he had even a script
[1:10:47] and his sling was in his hand and he
[1:10:49] drew near to the philistine
[1:10:52] see god called david as a shepherd
[1:10:56] is that right he gave him victory
[1:10:59] as a shepherd but now when the challenge
[1:11:02] of goliath comes
[1:11:03] david didn't put himself in that
[1:11:05] position and then god
[1:11:07] god anointed his dad he moved his dad to
[1:11:10] tell him to go
[1:11:11] take these cheeses and these breads and
[1:11:12] he goes up at the same time goliath
[1:11:14] makes his boast and
[1:11:16] he doesn't go out there and just run out
[1:11:17] and kill him he just starts asking
[1:11:19] questions
[1:11:20] real logical questions like why are you
[1:11:22] guys scared
[1:11:24] sorry i'm not supposed to say a scared
[1:11:26] that's bad grammar
[1:11:29] i was raised from people out of kentucky
[1:11:35] why are you so afraid what well
[1:11:38] i mean is there a reward for somebody
[1:11:39] who'll kill this guy
[1:11:43] and he gets put into a position by god
[1:11:46] god works all of this out he stands
[1:11:48] before the king and
[1:11:50] and and the king doesn't ask him have
[1:11:52] you ever killed a giant before
[1:11:54] because the answer is no how many times
[1:11:58] have you done this how many battles have
[1:11:59] you been
[1:12:00] in i mean how many times have you have
[1:12:02] you fought another regular sized person
[1:12:08] no but god put me in position as a
[1:12:12] shepherd
[1:12:13] and while i was in my position doing
[1:12:16] what my father told me to do
[1:12:18] a lion came in and grabbed one of the
[1:12:21] lambs
[1:12:22] and i smote him and took the lamb out of
[1:12:24] his mouth the bear came in then
[1:12:25] and i smote him amen can you imagine
[1:12:29] growing up and and all the brothers
[1:12:32] talking about how strong they are you
[1:12:34] know he's the youngest
[1:12:36] and all the brothers showing how big a
[1:12:38] rock they can throw and
[1:12:39] the other ones showing how much they can
[1:12:41] lift and how fast they can run
[1:12:43] and they're looking at dave and what can
[1:12:45] you do and david can't do anything to
[1:12:47] match them
[1:12:48] and they talk about oh if if i ever got
[1:12:50] a chance i could kill a bear i'd kill a
[1:12:52] lion
[1:12:53] can you kill a bear you know what the
[1:12:56] question
[1:12:57] the question is can you i'll ask you can
[1:12:58] you kill a bear
[1:13:00] can you kill a bear can you kill a lion
[1:13:04] the answer is yes
[1:13:08] if god's ordained you to it if it's
[1:13:11] standing in the way of your purpose in
[1:13:13] god
[1:13:15] you can kill a bear you can kill a lion
[1:13:18] david may not have known he could he may
[1:13:20] not have been going around saying i'm
[1:13:22] killing
[1:13:22] i can kill a bear and i can kill a nine
[1:13:24] foot man too
[1:13:28] see we don't know what we can do
[1:13:32] but we know one thing god can't fail
[1:13:34] whatever he's
[1:13:35] called me to in the position i'm in if
[1:13:38] there's a challenge that comes to that
[1:13:40] position
[1:13:40] then the god in me can overcome that
[1:13:42] challenge
[1:13:44] if it's sickness i mean if it's if what
[1:13:46] it doesn't matter
[1:13:47] what comes into our family our household
[1:13:49] as families amen
[1:13:51] mom and dad you can stand against it
[1:13:52] amen because that's your position
[1:13:55] it doesn't matter what spirit tries to
[1:13:57] move through dad you can stand against
[1:13:58] that spirit in opposition to that spirit
[1:14:00] you can defeat that giant of whatever
[1:14:02] that spirit is
[1:14:03] trying to come into your home because
[1:14:05] that's your position
[1:14:07] you may never have known that you could
[1:14:09] do it before you may not have known
[1:14:11] amen that you could lay hands on the
[1:14:12] sick and they'd be healed you may not
[1:14:14] have ever known you can raise the dead
[1:14:15] until you get to the position where
[1:14:17] the dead needs raised in front of you
[1:14:19] and you're the vessel gods chose to do
[1:14:21] it
[1:14:23] i mean we don't go around saying i can
[1:14:25] kill a bear i can kill a lion
[1:14:27] i can kill a giant i can raise the dead
[1:14:31] but in my post of duty if that's what
[1:14:34] god has ordained before the foundation
[1:14:36] of the world
[1:14:37] we can do all that more not by our
[1:14:40] strength not by our ability
[1:14:42] but just by being in the position he
[1:14:44] puts us in he brings us into
[1:14:46] circumstances and situations that
[1:14:48] there's no way around
[1:14:49] we just have to face it we have to have
[1:14:51] faith and confidence in where he's put
[1:14:53] us
[1:14:55] how many times amen how many times
[1:14:58] have we seen supernatural healings where
[1:15:01] a mother will lay her hands on her baby
[1:15:03] and pray for it and the baby's healed
[1:15:06] they may not always make testimonies we
[1:15:08] may not always write it out
[1:15:09] and put it up here because it's such a
[1:15:11] common occurrence
[1:15:14] what is it it's divine healing it's
[1:15:17] divine healing
[1:15:18] how many times does divine healing take
[1:15:20] place in our homes in a week's time
[1:15:23] how many times is an enemy a devil
[1:15:26] of whatever sickness you want to name a
[1:15:28] devil of flu amen a devil of bronchitis
[1:15:31] a devil of fever whatever devil you want
[1:15:34] to call it how many times in your home
[1:15:35] has a devil come to attack in your home
[1:15:38] and you stood up with your little sling
[1:15:40] shot of faith and you defeated that
[1:15:42] devil
[1:15:42] amen and it may never have made a praise
[1:15:44] report it may not be something you go
[1:15:46] and brag about
[1:15:46] because it becomes so much a part of our
[1:15:48] life
[1:15:50] that's a natural outcome what is it it's
[1:15:53] god on display
[1:15:54] it's christ in you i mean it's you
[1:15:56] standing in your position as a mama with
[1:15:58] a baby as a daddy with a family
[1:16:02] trusting in god i remember i've told
[1:16:06] this testimony before but i remember one
[1:16:08] time when
[1:16:10] our oldest daughter brandon was sick she
[1:16:12] had a lot of
[1:16:13] congestion and and post nasal drip and
[1:16:17] she had been through weeks of coughing
[1:16:19] weeks
[1:16:21] and she we could see her getting weaker
[1:16:23] darkness around her eyes she would lay
[1:16:25] down for a nap
[1:16:26] cough cough cough cough lay down at
[1:16:27] night cough and it was really wearing it
[1:16:30] was really
[1:16:30] exhausting we prayed and it seemed like
[1:16:33] that thing wouldn't move
[1:16:36] and we it's terrible when you see your
[1:16:39] little toddler getting weaker
[1:16:41] they're not playing like they normally
[1:16:42] play they're lethargic they're laying
[1:16:44] around
[1:16:46] and there was a day angie was home i was
[1:16:49] off at work
[1:16:50] late later down she's up there and she's
[1:16:52] laying down and all of a sudden starts
[1:16:54] that coughing
[1:16:55] and she's you could just see her little
[1:16:57] body jerking while she's coughing trying
[1:16:59] to sleep
[1:17:01] and we've been giving her benadryl just
[1:17:03] to stop the coughing so she could rest
[1:17:04] and
[1:17:05] and angie grabs the benadryl she goes to
[1:17:07] run upstairs
[1:17:08] and she's praying said god you can heal
[1:17:10] her why is she going through this
[1:17:13] and before she puts that first foot on
[1:17:15] the step something spoke in her heart
[1:17:17] and said
[1:17:17] if you believe me to heal her why are
[1:17:18] you giving her the benadryl
[1:17:21] and angie turned around and threw it in
[1:17:22] the trash can
[1:17:24] and she stopped coughing and never
[1:17:26] coughed since
[1:17:29] who else would intercede for that little
[1:17:31] toddler
[1:17:32] who else would implore god for that baby
[1:17:36] see you're not just a mother you're a
[1:17:39] mother of that child
[1:17:41] you're saying you're not just a father
[1:17:44] you're a father of
[1:17:45] that child you're not just a husband or
[1:17:47] a wife you're not just a son or daughter
[1:17:49] you're not just a brother or sister but
[1:17:51] you are specifically placed in the life
[1:17:53] of certain people
[1:17:54] amen and god is wanting to use you and i
[1:17:57] amen to do what we can do
[1:17:58] for the body of christ he wants to work
[1:18:02] through us
[1:18:03] david was a shepherd amen now when david
[1:18:06] comes
[1:18:06] to fight a bigger battle amen he comes
[1:18:09] now to fight a man now to fight a
[1:18:11] goliath
[1:18:12] and then saul tries to arm him and tries
[1:18:14] to give him armament he says i can't
[1:18:16] prove these
[1:18:16] and so what does he take he takes his
[1:18:19] staff shepard's staff
[1:18:20] he takes his bag shepherd's back takes a
[1:18:22] sling shepherd's sling
[1:18:24] amen what worked before will work again
[1:18:27] the way god called him is the way god
[1:18:29] called him he called him to be a
[1:18:31] shepherd over his father's sheep
[1:18:32] amen but he had been anointed to be king
[1:18:34] and now he comes up and he sees the
[1:18:36] sheep of his great father god
[1:18:38] and now there's a great lion roaring out
[1:18:40] there goliath rory
[1:18:41] trying to take god's sheep and what's he
[1:18:43] doing he's just doing the same thing
[1:18:45] he's always done
[1:18:47] and he's doing it the same way he's
[1:18:49] always done it
[1:18:50] trusting god amen trusting in his
[1:18:53] position
[1:18:54] he says that uncircumcised philistine
[1:18:56] what is he saying with that statement
[1:18:58] he's positioning himself he's
[1:19:00] uncircumcised
[1:19:01] i'm circumcised if i'm circumcised then
[1:19:04] i'm part of the promise of abraham
[1:19:06] the promise of abraham was that we will
[1:19:08] possess the gates of our enemy
[1:19:10] there is no way an uncircumcised
[1:19:12] philistine can defeat
[1:19:14] that promise of god what was he doing
[1:19:17] he was he was placing himself solidly in
[1:19:20] the promise in the word
[1:19:25] he he went to face him
[1:19:28] not as a great general not in full armor
[1:19:31] man not as a great
[1:19:32] soldier he went and faced him as a child
[1:19:36] of abraham under an abrahamic
[1:19:39] promising covenant with a circumcision
[1:19:42] as his seals the covenant
[1:19:44] and confidence that god will not fail to
[1:19:47] keep his word
[1:19:48] because i'm in my position
[1:19:52] there's a power that comes with being in
[1:19:54] position
[1:19:56] david had already been anointed to be
[1:19:58] king
[1:19:59] that thing was working in his life he
[1:20:02] couldn't stop it
[1:20:05] brother branham says in the 1957 on his
[1:20:08] india trip report
[1:20:10] so that's the same thing that took place
[1:20:11] in finland when i raised that dead boy
[1:20:13] you've read the story certainly that's
[1:20:16] right he's god
[1:20:17] he don't tell his servants all things
[1:20:19] but when he wants to use you
[1:20:21] he can put his hand on you take you here
[1:20:23] and do it
[1:20:24] if you'll just be humble and stay in
[1:20:27] your position
[1:20:30] don't ever ever try to find out what you
[1:20:34] can do for the kingdom of god
[1:20:36] just do what he's put in your hand and
[1:20:38] anytime he wants he can pick you up and
[1:20:40] move you anywhere he wants
[1:20:42] just be humble and stay in your position
[1:20:45] he can make more glory out of it
[1:20:47] than all the devil dabbling along you
[1:20:50] can do or i can do
[1:20:51] that's right abide in your calling and
[1:20:53] stay in there till god's ready to move
[1:20:55] you somewhere
[1:20:56] that's right
[1:21:00] 7 you don't have to turn there i'll just
[1:21:02] read it amon 7 verse 14
[1:21:04] then answered amos and said to amaziah i
[1:21:07] was no prophet
[1:21:08] neither was i a prophet's son but i was
[1:21:11] a herdman
[1:21:12] and a gatherer of sycamore fruit
[1:21:15] and the lord took me as i followed the
[1:21:17] flock and the lord said unto me go
[1:21:19] prophesy unto my people
[1:21:21] israel praise god
[1:21:25] amos i'm not a prophet i'm not the son
[1:21:28] of the prophet
[1:21:29] i don't come from a lineage of preachers
[1:21:31] i don't come from a lineage of singers
[1:21:33] i don't come from a lineage of
[1:21:34] songwriters or whatever you you just
[1:21:36] attach anything you want to that
[1:21:40] i don't come from that i mean i'm just a
[1:21:42] herdsman
[1:21:43] i'm just an auto mechanic
[1:21:46] uh i'm just a i'm just a mailman
[1:21:51] i'm just a retiree i'm just a
[1:21:54] whatever label you want to put amos
[1:21:57] wasn't looking for a position
[1:21:59] he knew what his position was he was
[1:22:02] doing what god called him to do
[1:22:03] but when god needed a man to go and
[1:22:05] prophesy god knew where to find him
[1:22:09] amos wasn't running around out of
[1:22:11] position looking for something to do
[1:22:13] he stayed in whatever god gave him to do
[1:22:15] until god told him what to do
[1:22:18] just stay all this carnal denominational
[1:22:22] trying to fill roles fill
[1:22:25] spots and and and find good fits and uh
[1:22:29] forget all of that jocking for position
[1:22:34] or
[1:22:34] you know not that we do that but that's
[1:22:36] just a that's a denominational mentality
[1:22:41] just do what god's called us to do
[1:22:44] whatever he's called us to do i remember
[1:22:48] i used to be a technician for industrial
[1:22:50] equipment
[1:22:52] and i remember so many times
[1:22:55] i'd be working and i'd be working late
[1:22:57] i'd be working overtime
[1:22:59] this whole manufacturing plan is shut
[1:23:01] down and they can't do anything till we
[1:23:02] get this piece of equipment running
[1:23:04] a lot of pressure intense but this was
[1:23:07] what god gave me to do to support my
[1:23:08] family
[1:23:09] i knew this is the job he gave me i knew
[1:23:11] this was my position
[1:23:13] amen even before i would think about
[1:23:15] changing jobs i could get no liberty in
[1:23:16] my spirit to switch jobs
[1:23:21] and so many times i had no idea what to
[1:23:25] do
[1:23:28] but i would go i would go to get another
[1:23:30] tool out of the truck that i didn't need
[1:23:34] and as i'm walking the really what i
[1:23:36] need is to get away because i have no
[1:23:37] idea what to do
[1:23:39] and i'm going to go get a tool and i'm
[1:23:41] walking over there and i'm praying i'm
[1:23:43] praying the whole time
[1:23:45] what is that carnal work no that's my
[1:23:46] that's my work
[1:23:50] this is where god put me this is the
[1:23:52] mechanism he's choosing to feed my
[1:23:54] family at home
[1:23:55] amen this is my position this is my
[1:23:57] place
[1:23:59] i begin to pray god i don't know what to
[1:24:01] do i
[1:24:02] don't know how to fix this my family's
[1:24:03] at home it's 10 o'clock i want to go
[1:24:05] home i
[1:24:07] this is life
[1:24:11] i've been walking to the truck and get
[1:24:13] it go to get this tool that i really
[1:24:15] don't need
[1:24:18] and all of a sudden out of the blue
[1:24:21] i'll have a thought that says check that
[1:24:25] check this and i don't even know
[1:24:28] i mean why checking that would relate to
[1:24:30] the problem i don't know
[1:24:32] but i can't tell you how many times i'd
[1:24:34] go back and check that
[1:24:35] and that would be the solution to the
[1:24:36] problem
[1:24:38] was that carnal was that carnal work
[1:24:42] no i was in my position and i was asking
[1:24:44] god to help me because i was doing what
[1:24:46] he told me to do
[1:24:47] and god was supplying answers answers
[1:24:50] answers what was it
[1:24:51] it was it was carnal of course it was a
[1:24:53] manufacturing plan
[1:24:54] they had to send out so many 10 000
[1:24:56] widgets an hour they wanted to make more
[1:24:58] money
[1:24:59] but for me it was more than just carnal
[1:25:01] work it was the thing god gave me as a
[1:25:03] son of god to do
[1:25:04] it was the thing that was in my hands
[1:25:06] and i had confidence that if i needed
[1:25:08] help i could ask god for help and god
[1:25:10] would give me help i can't tell you how
[1:25:12] many times he did
[1:25:13] until i got to the place where i would
[1:25:15] get raises and i would get promotions
[1:25:17] and i would get
[1:25:17] special jobs and special requests
[1:25:19] because they thought i was a really good
[1:25:21] technician
[1:25:25] and they wouldn't believe my secret
[1:25:26] weapon but my secret weapon is
[1:25:28] desperately praying out to god god i
[1:25:30] have no idea what to do would you help
[1:25:32] me
[1:25:34] you've all experienced it you know
[1:25:36] whether you're a
[1:25:37] a programmer or whatever you get into
[1:25:40] positions you're getting binds even
[1:25:42] whether you're trying to do a repair or
[1:25:43] a remodel there's things you just don't
[1:25:45] know how to do
[1:25:46] and all of a sudden out of nowhere the
[1:25:48] solution comes
[1:25:50] i ask you was it out of nowhere
[1:25:54] or is god intimately familiar with where
[1:25:57] we're at
[1:25:59] and what we're doing and how we're doing
[1:26:02] it
[1:26:06] i mean you hear testaments all the time
[1:26:09] you have a mother with a sick baby she
[1:26:10] doesn't know what to do she can't
[1:26:11] console it
[1:26:12] she can and all of a sudden she'll get
[1:26:14] an idea
[1:26:16] take it outside go for a ride
[1:26:22] and it'll be the thing that works where
[1:26:25] did that come from
[1:26:27] it wasn't the international journal of
[1:26:29] medicine
[1:26:33] but you can trust god to give you
[1:26:37] answers in your time of need you can
[1:26:38] trust god
[1:26:39] amen to put you in the right position
[1:26:41] wherever he's put
[1:26:43] you can trust god there is no carnal
[1:26:45] work for a child of god
[1:26:48] everything we do let's do it for him
[1:26:52] let's do it and obedience to him let's
[1:26:54] do it i mean let's do it to display to
[1:26:56] the world
[1:26:57] what would it be like if jesus christ
[1:26:59] was a mother
[1:27:00] what would it be like if jesus christ
[1:27:02] was an earthly daddy with children what
[1:27:04] would it be like
[1:27:05] amen how can we display that what would
[1:27:07] it be like if jesus christ worked in
[1:27:09] this office cubicle i'm in right now
[1:27:11] if he was a nurse if he was a doctor
[1:27:13] what would it be like amen if that's
[1:27:15] that's the way we want to live amen and
[1:27:18] if we're living that way for him
[1:27:19] i promise you he'll supply your needs
[1:27:22] he'll give you
[1:27:22] answers he'll give you solutions to your
[1:27:24] problems
[1:27:27] and sometimes he lets the problems come
[1:27:29] so he can give you the solutions so you
[1:27:32] have the confidence
[1:27:33] that you're where god wants you to be
[1:27:38] brother brahman says and god has a
[1:27:39] provided way so when moses threw his rod
[1:27:42] down
[1:27:43] and those fellows standing there with
[1:27:44] supersensory perception
[1:27:46] through their rods down done the same
[1:27:48] thing that moses done
[1:27:49] only moses was following the line of god
[1:27:52] and what happened there's nothing the
[1:27:54] man could do
[1:27:55] he fulfilled his duty when you do
[1:27:57] everything that you can do in the line
[1:27:59] of duty then it's
[1:28:00] god's business to provide a way
[1:28:03] god will provide for himself a sacrifice
[1:28:07] brother baby said god will provide
[1:28:09] himself a sacrifice he's taking
[1:28:11] right back from the words of abraham
[1:28:13] when abraham is walking with
[1:28:15] with isaac up to mount moriah to
[1:28:17] sacrifice his son his son says hey where
[1:28:19] is the lamb we've got the fire we've got
[1:28:21] the knife but where is the sacrifice he
[1:28:23] said god will provide himself a
[1:28:24] sacrifice
[1:28:26] why because he was walking in the line
[1:28:28] of duty he was obedient to god
[1:28:30] he didn't know how god would do it what
[1:28:31] he would do he presumed we pick up in
[1:28:33] the new testament he presumed that god
[1:28:35] would raise isaac from the dead
[1:28:38] but he spoke those faithful words god
[1:28:40] will provide
[1:28:41] because all i can do is what he tells me
[1:28:43] to do all i can do is what he's given me
[1:28:45] to do
[1:28:46] he's got to do the rest and god told
[1:28:49] moses to throw down the rod
[1:28:51] it'll become a serpent take up the rod
[1:28:53] amen it'll become a
[1:28:54] take it take it back up it'll become a
[1:28:56] rod he told him that he told him to show
[1:28:58] that sign to pharaoh
[1:28:59] but he didn't tell him what janus and
[1:29:01] jamborees would do
[1:29:04] he just threw it down it turned into a
[1:29:06] snake and then those two threw it down
[1:29:08] and they turned into snakes amen and all
[1:29:10] of a sudden all
[1:29:11] eyes are on moses like what now we can
[1:29:14] match your sign
[1:29:15] but there was nothing moses could do
[1:29:17] there was nothing he could explain
[1:29:18] there was nothing he could say well you
[1:29:20] know but you know mine's a little bit
[1:29:22] bigger than yours
[1:29:26] all he could do was hold still
[1:29:29] and he held still then it was god's duty
[1:29:32] to back that up because he did what god
[1:29:34] told him to do
[1:29:40] moving on brother said improving his
[1:29:41] word 1965
[1:29:43] and we find out that joshua knew
[1:29:47] if night come they'd slip around and get
[1:29:49] with another and
[1:29:50] get their cells together and make
[1:29:52] another big army and he'd have a rough
[1:29:54] time
[1:29:54] with them the next day he didn't know
[1:29:56] what to do so he
[1:29:57] looked up to god he needed help and he
[1:30:00] needed that son to stand still
[1:30:02] so he just commanded that son to stand
[1:30:03] still said for moon you hang over
[1:30:06] agilent move until he and not move until
[1:30:08] like
[1:30:09] he commanded him and the moon and the
[1:30:11] sun stayed still for 24 hours
[1:30:13] when joshua fought the battle and
[1:30:14] conquered the enemy because he was right
[1:30:16] in the line of duty
[1:30:18] he had a right to do it because he was
[1:30:20] obeying god's commandment
[1:30:23] you think about what joshua did joshua
[1:30:26] stopped all the laws of nature
[1:30:30] whatever laws keep the solar system in
[1:30:32] motion and keep things moving
[1:30:34] whatever laws keep all that moving
[1:30:36] joshua
[1:30:37] just superseded all of those laws and
[1:30:39] took absolute control
[1:30:41] over the universe to stop the sun from
[1:30:43] moving
[1:30:46] but why did he have confidence in doing
[1:30:47] it because he was in his post of duty
[1:30:50] he was doing what god told him to do god
[1:30:52] said you go
[1:30:53] in there and you kill all of them
[1:30:57] and in order for him to accomplish what
[1:30:59] he had to accomplish
[1:31:00] he could not let that sunset right now
[1:31:02] because he knew they would get together
[1:31:04] and they
[1:31:04] banned themselves together with another
[1:31:05] army he needed more time
[1:31:07] when he needed more time something in
[1:31:09] him raised up
[1:31:10] enough faith to say moon you stand still
[1:31:13] sudden you don't move
[1:31:14] amen and it obeyed the voice of a man
[1:31:19] brother man says this this way and as
[1:31:21] long as you're in the line of duty
[1:31:23] keeping god's word doing just what he
[1:31:26] told you to do
[1:31:27] marching by the orders of god you've got
[1:31:29] a right to say to that mountain be moved
[1:31:33] god keeps his word if you say to this
[1:31:36] mountain be moved
[1:31:37] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:31:39] that what you said will come to pass
[1:31:41] you can have that what you said jesus
[1:31:43] said that in saint mark 11 22
[1:31:45] that's the truth i know that's the truth
[1:31:47] it's god's word and that proves that
[1:31:49] it's the truth
[1:31:50] we're just afraid sometimes we get to a
[1:31:53] place where afraid he won't keep that
[1:31:55] word
[1:31:55] he will keep that word he said he would
[1:31:58] do it
[1:31:59] now we find now we find that's true he
[1:32:02] proved it
[1:32:04] i want to keep reading this and then the
[1:32:06] next quote
[1:32:07] it goes with this quote out of the
[1:32:09] message of paradox
[1:32:11] because the bible said here it was never
[1:32:13] a time before a sense like it that god
[1:32:15] hearkened to the voice of a man
[1:32:17] you say oh if i if i knowed we just
[1:32:19] lived in that day
[1:32:20] jesus said in saint mark 11 24 if you
[1:32:23] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:32:25] doubt in your heart but believe that
[1:32:26] what you said will come to pass
[1:32:28] you can have what you said still grace
[1:32:31] and the paradox on down into our age
[1:32:33] sure
[1:32:34] that moon and sun stood still until
[1:32:36] joshua fought his way through
[1:32:37] with israel and avenged themselves upon
[1:32:39] their enemy why it was in the line of
[1:32:41] duty
[1:32:42] now if you'd go out here and say
[1:32:44] mountain move i want to show you i can
[1:32:46] do it
[1:32:46] it won't do it
[1:32:50] but if it's in the line of duty when god
[1:32:53] has commanded you to do something like
[1:32:54] he said to moses why cry to me
[1:32:56] speak to the children people today is
[1:32:58] crying all the time lord what next what
[1:33:00] next
[1:33:01] just speak and go forward that's right
[1:33:03] god has commissioned us to do something
[1:33:05] let's do it
[1:33:06] don't stand around and think about it
[1:33:07] say how can it happen well this that
[1:33:09] makes any difference if god said do it
[1:33:11] do it anyhow he's still the god of
[1:33:13] miracles
[1:33:15] i like reading those quotes together
[1:33:17] because brother man said if you don't
[1:33:18] doubt if you're in the line of duty
[1:33:19] you've got a right to say to that
[1:33:21] mountain leaf but he says if you're
[1:33:22] going to say to the mountain move
[1:33:24] just so you can show that you did it he
[1:33:26] said that mountain will go nowhere
[1:33:29] if if there's any if there's any bit of
[1:33:32] self glorification involved you you can
[1:33:35] just
[1:33:36] might as well save your breath if
[1:33:39] there's any amount
[1:33:40] or self-justification ourself
[1:33:45] you just might as well save your breath
[1:33:49] you know so many times
[1:33:54] we want something to happen to prove to
[1:33:57] everybody else who we are
[1:34:02] we're looking for our own vindication
[1:34:07] but god vindicates his word he's not
[1:34:10] here to vindicate you as a human being
[1:34:12] he's here to vindicate maybe you as the
[1:34:14] word
[1:34:15] the word in you but he's not here to
[1:34:18] vindicate you as a human being so you
[1:34:19] can be some great person so you can be a
[1:34:21] super gifted this or that
[1:34:24] that's better than everybody else he's
[1:34:26] not going to do that friends that's the
[1:34:27] wrong motive
[1:34:28] if we've got that motive in our heart oh
[1:34:30] lord let them see
[1:34:31] let them see
[1:34:35] if we're talking about the winning of
[1:34:36] souls yeah let them see so they'll
[1:34:37] believe that's one thing
[1:34:38] but let them see for my sake
[1:34:43] see it's not about having selfish
[1:34:44] motives amen sometimes we see some
[1:34:47] miraculous things happen in private
[1:34:51] mountains move sometimes privately
[1:34:56] not for a show not not
[1:35:00] to be seen not for self-glorification
[1:35:02] but sometimes when we come against
[1:35:04] obstacles amen
[1:35:05] god begins to move mountains in our
[1:35:07] lives mountains and our minds
[1:35:08] mountains and our own our own
[1:35:10] consciousness begins to move things or
[1:35:12] even do supernatural things for us
[1:35:14] amen alone in the privacy amen of our
[1:35:17] own lives and the privacy of our own
[1:35:19] thoughts
[1:35:19] so that we can keep moving forward in
[1:35:22] the commission and plan he's moved us
[1:35:23] in not to make us a great person
[1:35:27] in the eyes of the other believers not
[1:35:28] to make us a great super something
[1:35:32] i mean the reason that he could do so
[1:35:34] many miraculous things through brother
[1:35:35] branham is brother branham was so
[1:35:37] incredibly humble
[1:35:40] that over and over and over and over and
[1:35:43] over again he could do the miraculous
[1:35:45] through him he could do he could do
[1:35:46] things that hadn't been written about
[1:35:48] since bible times
[1:35:49] and never in the quantity that they were
[1:35:52] displayed
[1:35:55] but the man was so humble and he had
[1:35:57] such a position
[1:35:58] god commissioned him through that and
[1:36:00] god was vindicating his word to that man
[1:36:02] but he was able to stay
[1:36:03] so humble he didn't get elevated by the
[1:36:05] miracles
[1:36:08] say god make me that humble that you can
[1:36:10] do something through me
[1:36:12] that you have the freedom to do
[1:36:13] something through me
[1:36:16] i wonder sometimes if our own pride
[1:36:19] and self-desire hinders god from working
[1:36:22] miracles in our lives because of what we
[1:36:24] would do with the testimony
[1:36:29] i don't want my attitude my selfishness
[1:36:32] my self-love
[1:36:33] to hinder god in any way but i wonder if
[1:36:35] god would like to move more mightily
[1:36:38] if he knew he had a people that was as
[1:36:40] humble as that prophet who would never
[1:36:41] take credit for it
[1:36:43] who would after miracle upon miracle
[1:36:46] upon miracle would get up in front of
[1:36:48] everybody and says
[1:36:49] oh i failed god corrected me the other
[1:36:51] day and
[1:36:54] i'm sorry for saying that about that
[1:36:56] brother
[1:37:00] see i sometimes i wonder if god's not
[1:37:03] desiring to show himself
[1:37:05] more and more supernatural ways but we
[1:37:07] haven't come to the maturity yet to
[1:37:09] handle it
[1:37:12] i believe in all the supernatural
[1:37:13] everything i believe
[1:37:15] i believe that i can walk on water
[1:37:19] peter did unconverted
[1:37:23] by faith if god ever if i ever need to
[1:37:25] in my commission in my calling if god
[1:37:27] ever quickens the faith to me i can walk
[1:37:29] right on water
[1:37:31] i can disappear and reappear 100 miles
[1:37:33] away amen
[1:37:36] philip did why can't i
[1:37:39] i believe i could kill a lion by
[1:37:41] grabbing him by the beard and smiting it
[1:37:44] i just never needed to
[1:37:48] daddy can you kill a giant yes i can
[1:37:50] kill a giant
[1:37:52] i just never met one that needed killing
[1:37:59] you see it's about being in position
[1:38:03] an imposition when god needs to show
[1:38:06] himself when god needs to vindicate when
[1:38:08] god
[1:38:08] needs to move when god needs a victory
[1:38:11] he'll allow the circumstances to work
[1:38:12] out where you get pinned in and you have
[1:38:14] no way
[1:38:17] moses got pinned in children of israel
[1:38:19] got pending they had no way but through
[1:38:21] the sea
[1:38:21] and he said speak and go forward he's
[1:38:23] going to do a miracle but they were in
[1:38:24] the po
[1:38:25] they were in the line of duty they were
[1:38:26] doing what god had called them to do
[1:38:28] amen they were they were hemmed in
[1:38:29] between the mountain and the sea and an
[1:38:31] army that was coming to kill them
[1:38:32] amen but god had already told them you
[1:38:35] will go over there and you will bring
[1:38:36] them back to worship on this mountain
[1:38:38] this will be a sign to you that i spoke
[1:38:40] to you you'll go get them and you'll
[1:38:41] bring them back to this mountain amen
[1:38:44] there was no seed no
[1:38:45] army no fire no flood there was nothing
[1:38:47] that could stop that word from coming to
[1:38:49] pass
[1:38:50] god moses was walking in the line of
[1:38:53] duty he was doing exactly what god had
[1:38:54] told him to do he was following the
[1:38:56] pillar of fire
[1:38:58] so in that condition god was obligated
[1:39:00] to move those waters away
[1:39:04] but me myself i want to live the kind of
[1:39:07] life
[1:39:08] were never secretly in my heart i'm
[1:39:11] saying
[1:39:12] move mountains so i can show that i did
[1:39:14] it don't
[1:39:15] ever want that attitude god root that
[1:39:18] thing out of me
[1:39:24] i don't ever want to hinder the plan of
[1:39:26] god
[1:39:27] because of me because i want glory
[1:39:31] i want a testimony i want to tell
[1:39:33] somebody everything that's happened in
[1:39:35] my life
[1:39:35] somehow you know we'll just say
[1:39:40] judas had testimonies
[1:39:43] healings and miracles and you know judas
[1:39:46] walked with the lord and judas had all
[1:39:48] that and judas was still
[1:39:49] lost you know
[1:39:53] i i don't want that i want god to get
[1:39:56] all the glory
[1:39:59] and say god help me to stay in my
[1:40:00] position faithfully
[1:40:02] humbly wherever you put me let me do
[1:40:05] with all my heart
[1:40:06] and if a giant comes up and there's no
[1:40:08] way around over
[1:40:09] i'm just going to say you'll take the
[1:40:10] giant if the mountain comes up and i
[1:40:13] can't go around and i can't go under and
[1:40:15] i can't go over
[1:40:15] then i'm going to believe that you're
[1:40:17] going to move the mountain
[1:40:19] because i'm doing what you told me to do
[1:40:21] david believed he could kill the lion
[1:40:24] not because of the strength in his arms
[1:40:25] but because he was the one responsible
[1:40:27] for that lamb
[1:40:29] who else was going to get the lion who
[1:40:32] else was going to get the bear
[1:40:33] who else was there to do it david was
[1:40:35] the one that's there to do it
[1:40:36] sometimes god puts us in position so
[1:40:38] that we'll be the one who has to move
[1:40:41] we're the one who has to pray we're the
[1:40:43] one who has to believe
[1:40:44] we can't go get anybody else there was
[1:40:46] nobody for david to get
[1:40:47] god put him in a position to where he
[1:40:50] was going to manifest himself
[1:40:52] through david and god is going to get us
[1:40:55] in positions friend where he can
[1:40:56] manifest himself through us
[1:40:58] amen but it's going to be when we're
[1:40:59] operating in our position in our calling
[1:41:01] where god has placed us
[1:41:03] don't get nervous when things start to
[1:41:05] become difficult don't get upset when
[1:41:07] impossibilities confront us if you're in
[1:41:09] your post of duty no matter what it is
[1:41:12] then let your faith start to rise
[1:41:14] because i'm doing what god called me to
[1:41:15] do
[1:41:16] this thing has to move
[1:41:19] i i am commissioned amen i'll tell you
[1:41:22] what
[1:41:22] sisters if you're a mother with little
[1:41:24] children to take care of and the devil
[1:41:26] comes in and knocks you off your feet
[1:41:27] with sickness
[1:41:28] you fight that devil and say devil i
[1:41:30] resist you in the name of jesus christ
[1:41:32] my family needs me right now
[1:41:36] what are you doing you're praying your
[1:41:37] position amen
[1:41:39] not lord make me better so i don't feel
[1:41:41] bad brother
[1:41:42] says you want to be healed what do you
[1:41:43] want to be healed for
[1:41:45] tell god the purpose what are you going
[1:41:47] to do with your healing
[1:41:48] why do you need a healing what is it in
[1:41:50] the kingdom of god that will be
[1:41:51] accomplished by your healing amen is it
[1:41:53] just because you don't want to be sick
[1:41:55] or is it because i've got a duty to
[1:41:57] perform as a mother i got a duty to
[1:41:59] perform as a father
[1:42:00] i need my health god i'm depending on
[1:42:03] you to move this mountain
[1:42:04] in jesus christ's name devil flee from
[1:42:07] me because i gotta get up and make
[1:42:08] supper
[1:42:13] my children need me my husband needs me
[1:42:15] my wife need me
[1:42:21] you understand confidence and position
[1:42:24] confidence in where god put me
[1:42:25] confidence in what i'm supposed to do
[1:42:30] what is it jesus christ
[1:42:33] as a grandpa as a daddy as a mother as
[1:42:36] an
[1:42:37] aunt as a brother or sister in christ
[1:42:40] it's jesus christ what can stand against
[1:42:43] him
[1:42:45] as long as it's him what can stand
[1:42:47] against him
[1:42:49] if it's you and i then you know
[1:42:52] we're pretty weak in our own flesh but
[1:42:55] if it's him and
[1:42:56] us who can stand against that if it's
[1:42:58] what he wants to accomplish in us
[1:43:00] who can stop it
[1:43:06] i'm going to skip over here i'm going to
[1:43:08] read this quote
[1:43:11] god doesn't call a man to judgment
[1:43:13] without first warning him
[1:43:14] from 1963. brother bram says it was down
[1:43:18] in memphis where i met this little
[1:43:20] colored woman you know
[1:43:21] standing out there you heard me tell
[1:43:23] about it you know her her boy had
[1:43:25] venereal disease and
[1:43:26] she had this man's shirt tied around her
[1:43:28] head and leaning over the bench like
[1:43:29] that
[1:43:30] and the lord stopped that plane there
[1:43:32] and wouldn't let it go somehow
[1:43:34] and they told me come and get and the
[1:43:36] holy spirit said take a little trip
[1:43:38] and go down this way brother brennan was
[1:43:40] flying and
[1:43:41] something happened to the plane or a
[1:43:43] storm or something and he landed in
[1:43:44] memphis and
[1:43:45] he couldn't take off they had to spend
[1:43:46] the night in memphis so they put him in
[1:43:49] a hotel
[1:43:49] the next morning he's going back there's
[1:43:51] a certain time he's got to get back to
[1:43:52] catch his flight
[1:43:53] and when he's going back the lord tells
[1:43:56] him to turn right or to walk
[1:43:57] on or something like that and he looks
[1:43:59] and he's standing there looking in the
[1:44:01] store window at something the lord tells
[1:44:02] him to move on
[1:44:04] and he's realizing now that he's going
[1:44:06] to miss his fight the time's going on
[1:44:08] he's going to miss the time he's
[1:44:09] supposed to be there
[1:44:10] but the lord's time to keep walking and
[1:44:11] keep walking and keep walking
[1:44:13] he's getting further and further away
[1:44:14] from the airport and finally he just
[1:44:16] resigns himself to well i miss the
[1:44:18] flight
[1:44:20] and while he's walking he comes to a
[1:44:22] gate he says we're in the little shanty
[1:44:23] part of town
[1:44:24] there's a woman leaning over the gate
[1:44:26] with a man's shirt tied around her head
[1:44:29] he goes on with the story he said i went
[1:44:34] uh walked down through there singing i
[1:44:36] thought oh my my plane's about ready to
[1:44:38] leave
[1:44:40] i kept i kept saying moving on kept on
[1:44:42] going kept on going
[1:44:43] just the early part of my ministry i
[1:44:45] looked leaning across the fence there in
[1:44:47] that little bitty
[1:44:48] shanty little place there there was an
[1:44:49] old sister standing there
[1:44:51] she looked like one of these sisters on
[1:44:52] the aunt jemima pancakes
[1:44:54] great big fat cheeks you know and her
[1:44:56] hair her shirt brought him
[1:44:57] on back she leaned across the gate like
[1:45:00] and was singing that little song
[1:45:02] i forget the name of that little song
[1:45:03] but she was singing a little pentecostal
[1:45:05] shoddy song a little jubilee and i just
[1:45:08] quit singing i got pretty close and i
[1:45:09] walked by
[1:45:10] and she was standing there and tears
[1:45:12] running down them big fat cheeks i
[1:45:14] wanted to hug her
[1:45:15] she said morning parson i said auntie
[1:45:18] what'd you say
[1:45:19] she said i said good morning parson i
[1:45:21] said how'd you know i was a parson

[1:45:35] uh oh here it is
[1:45:36] see she said yes sir said did you ever
[1:45:39] read the story in the bible parson about
[1:45:41] the shunammite woman
[1:45:43] i said yes auntie i've read it she said
[1:45:45] i was with the eyes that kind of woman
[1:45:47] she said
[1:45:48] and i asked the lord to give me a baby
[1:45:50] and me and my husband
[1:45:51] and i'd raise it for him now lock that
[1:45:54] into your mind
[1:45:56] this woman had asked the lord to give
[1:45:58] her a baby and she'd raise that baby for
[1:46:00] him
[1:46:03] she said he did he give me the baby said
[1:46:05] i raised it fine boy
[1:46:07] said he got with the wrong company
[1:46:08] parson he got a bad disease and said
[1:46:10] he's laying in there dying
[1:46:12] he's been dying for about two days now
[1:46:14] he ain't even come to himself for two
[1:46:15] days
[1:46:16] the doctor man was here and said he
[1:46:18] can't live said he's dying
[1:46:20] it was a social disease he said i
[1:46:22] couldn't hardly stand to see my baby die
[1:46:25] and i prayed all night and said i said
[1:46:27] lord

[1:46:30] shunamite woman was but said where's
[1:46:31] your elisha
[1:46:36] she knew what part she was playing she
[1:46:40] knew she had prayed for a baby and
[1:46:41] guarded miraculously
[1:46:43] supernaturally by his divine grace had
[1:46:45] given her a child and she promised to
[1:46:46] raise that for the lord
[1:46:47] and now she could position herself with
[1:46:49] that baby laying there dying
[1:46:51] and she said lord i'm that woman in the
[1:46:53] bible but i
[1:46:54] need an elisha
[1:46:59] and said i went to sleep and i dreamed a
[1:47:01] dream that i was standing here at this
[1:47:02] gate and i seen you coming down the
[1:47:04] street with the little hat kind of
[1:47:05] sitting on the side of your head
[1:47:07] but there's only one thing said said

[1:48:31] when i got out there two and a half
[1:48:32] hours late they were just making the
[1:48:34] last call for the flight think of it
[1:48:36] think of it the god through the faith of
[1:48:39] a poor ignorant woman didn't know how to
[1:48:41] write her own name
[1:48:42] but her faith brought a plane out of the
[1:48:44] sky and put it on the ground if we can
[1:48:46] only be led by the spirits
[1:48:50] what moved god that was a woman in her
[1:48:53] god-given position
[1:48:54] imploring to god for the baby that god
[1:48:56] gave her
[1:49:00] who else would play pray for that boy i
[1:49:02] want to ask you who else were going to
[1:49:03] be praying for that who would intercede
[1:49:05] for his soul
[1:49:09] that wasn't just a boy and she wasn't
[1:49:11] just a mama
[1:49:12] she was the mama and that was her son
[1:49:16] you realize that was her position
[1:49:20] her position in christ she prayed for a
[1:49:23] baby for her and husband to have him she
[1:49:25] promised to raise it for him
[1:49:26] that was her position god had anointed
[1:49:29] her god had blessed her to be a mother
[1:49:31] and in the in the answer to her prayer
[1:49:34] gave her this son
[1:49:35] this son now was her commission it was
[1:49:37] her job
[1:49:38] given to her by god to raise this boy to
[1:49:41] serve the lord and she raised him she
[1:49:42] did her part she did her job
[1:49:44] she raised him a fine boy but after she
[1:49:46] did her part
[1:49:47] this boy got with the wrong crowd
[1:49:50] got a bad disease was laying there dying
[1:49:53] but now she goes
[1:49:54] all the way back to her original prayer
[1:49:58] that god would give me a son give me a
[1:50:01] baby and i'd raise it for the lord and
[1:50:03] god
[1:50:03] give me the baby and now she knows her

[1:52:50] brother bem says in the message super
[1:52:52] sign
[1:52:54] here he heard something coming up the
[1:52:56] road he's talking about shamgar
[1:52:59] here come a thousand philistines armored
[1:53:01] spear swords hanging at their side
[1:53:03] trained men
[1:53:04] trump trump right up the road they come
[1:53:06] little shamgar stood there
[1:53:08] what could he do he was a farmer
[1:53:11] he wasn't a soldier he didn't have
[1:53:13] nothing to fight with
[1:53:14] he looked settled in the corner and
[1:53:15] there was a ox goad
[1:53:17] you know what that is any of you
[1:53:18] kentucky not to know when you're plowing
[1:53:20] a stick that you punched the ox along
[1:53:22] with
[1:53:23] there was an oxycode sitting there in
[1:53:24] the corner and looked over there it
[1:53:26] probably had a little piece of brass on
[1:53:27] the end of it there to knock off the
[1:53:28] dirt off the plow and
[1:53:30] punch the ox along as they went along
[1:53:32] there he sat in the corner he stood and
[1:53:33] looked coming up the road
[1:53:35] he didn't have training time to go train
[1:53:37] how to duel you know
[1:53:38] how to use this ox code or sword but he
[1:53:40] remembered one thing
[1:53:42] i believe that he was a circumcised
[1:53:44] israelite he was the seed of abraham
[1:53:46] he had a right to the promise that he
[1:53:48] would possess the gate of any enemy
[1:53:50] amen both sides he told rebecca the same
[1:53:52] thing and abraham the same thing
[1:53:54] there he was the seed of that couple and
[1:53:56] he had a right to it for he was
[1:53:57] circumcised
[1:53:58] he was an israelite he was a seed of
[1:54:00] abraham he had the promise of god that
[1:54:02] he would possess
[1:54:03] any gate of any enemy hallelujah the
[1:54:06] spirit of god come on him and he took
[1:54:07] that ox code and slew that thousand
[1:54:09] philistines yes why
[1:54:10] because he had super strength and
[1:54:13] convincing and concerned he says in the
[1:54:14] same story
[1:54:15] you say brother benham i'm the least in
[1:54:17] the church i'm just a little bitty
[1:54:19] fellow
[1:54:19] but remember when he ascended on high
[1:54:22] see you were raised with him
[1:54:25] see we're talking about positional
[1:54:26] placing
[1:54:28] where is your position seated in
[1:54:30] heavenly places
[1:54:32] in christ jesus
[1:54:38] he goes on to say if you're the skin
[1:54:41] on the bottom of the feet every devil is
[1:54:44] underneath
[1:54:45] you
[1:54:48] i'm the lowest of the lowest i don't
[1:54:51] care if you're the skin
[1:54:53] on the bottom of the feet every devil
[1:54:57] is under you why because your position
[1:55:00] is in christ see when we're in our
[1:55:04] position we don't have to cower down
[1:55:06] we don't have to be fearful we don't
[1:55:08] have to be nervous we don't to be afraid
[1:55:09] if god's called me here and this is the
[1:55:11] obstacle i'm facing
[1:55:13] then i'm believing god to do a work of
[1:55:14] miracle i'm moving forward by faith
[1:55:17] i'm going on amen i'm believing because
[1:55:19] god said
[1:55:20] this is my wife this is my husband this
[1:55:22] is my child amen this is
[1:55:24] my niece my nephew my whatever my
[1:55:26] brother my sister i'm moving on in faith

[1:55:30] position he put me in this is the
[1:55:32] calling we're with he called me
[1:55:33] i'm moving on by faith i don't care what
[1:55:37] the obstacle is i don't care
[1:55:38] what great big giant is standing over
[1:55:40] there boasting i'm moving by faith
[1:55:42] because this is where god put me i
[1:55:44] didn't put myself here
[1:55:46] god put me here amen
[1:55:49] and i'm trusting god to move me all the
[1:55:51] way through
[1:55:54] he said you're on the skin on the bottom
[1:55:56] of the feet every devil is underneath
[1:55:57] you that's right exactly the church
[1:55:59] whereas the head
[1:56:00] is the is the body is with it and if we
[1:56:03] were buried died buried in christ and we
[1:56:06] are raised with him in his resurrection
[1:56:07] and set in heavenly places
[1:56:09] in christ jesus and with and with in
[1:56:12] every fire of hell under us amen
[1:56:14] right no matter how little you are every
[1:56:16] devil is under you why
[1:56:18] our great conqueror has conquered every
[1:56:20] sin
[1:56:21] everything every sickness every death
[1:56:23] itself that's right we are more than
[1:56:25] conquerors in him
[1:56:26] only thing we're seated with him in his
[1:56:28] throne looking to him as he looks over
[1:56:29] the father that's it
[1:56:31] it's there all right shamgar had gotten
[1:56:34] enough of it he said
[1:56:35] i'm convinced that he's gone i am
[1:56:37] concerned with my
[1:56:39] with my family you know what he did he'd
[1:56:41] taken that ox code and jumped out there
[1:56:42] in the middle of the road and he slew
[1:56:44] 600 philistines what was shamgar
[1:56:48] a farmer you know what was more
[1:56:50] important
[1:56:52] he was the seed of abraham
[1:56:55] he was a seed of abraham farmer
[1:56:59] not just a farmer if you're a farmer
[1:57:02] you're a royal seed of abraham farmer
[1:57:06] not just a farmer
[1:57:09] and he was a daddy
[1:57:12] and he was a husband the man dramatizes
[1:57:16] the story over and over and over again
[1:57:18] he says he looks over and he sees his
[1:57:20] wife in a ragged old dress hardly a
[1:57:22] dress at all
[1:57:23] and his hungry little children over
[1:57:24] there ragged he said maybe this year
[1:57:26] we'll have enough wheat to put up that
[1:57:28] we won't starve to death this winter
[1:57:31] then he heard trump trump trump coming
[1:57:34] down the road what was the philistines
[1:57:35] coming
[1:57:36] they were going to take the last bit of
[1:57:38] his grain what he worked so hard for
[1:57:40] and he was concerned for his family he
[1:57:42] was a he was a daddy it was his
[1:57:44] responsibility to take care of them
[1:57:47] it was his responsibility to feed for
[1:57:49] them and provide for them
[1:57:51] to keep his wife and keep his children
[1:57:55] and he looked out and they were coming
[1:57:56] to take what god had given him he was an
[1:57:59] israelite positionally placed
[1:58:01] by moses and by joshua in the land that
[1:58:04] he was in
[1:58:04] he had a right to that land he had a
[1:58:06] right to the promise of abraham being an
[1:58:08] israelite a seed of abraham
[1:58:10] he had a right amen to possess the gate
[1:58:12] of every enemy and all of a sudden
[1:58:14] all this truth started clicking to him
[1:58:18] and when it all come down faith come to
[1:58:20] the surface and he grabbed what he had
[1:58:22] he didn't have to go become something
[1:58:24] else he took a farmer's implement
[1:58:26] and with a farmer's implement he
[1:58:28] defeated every philistine devil that was
[1:58:30] coming to take what was his
[1:58:33] david didn't need a sword and a spear
[1:58:34] david need what was it what his
[1:58:36] occupation was
[1:58:37] he was a shepherd he used shepherd tools
[1:58:39] to kill a giant
[1:58:40] event shamgar used farmer tools
[1:58:44] i hope you get what i'm saying you don't
[1:58:45] have to become nothing different to
[1:58:47] defeat the devil
[1:58:48] whatever you are you can use mother's
[1:58:50] tools father's tools
[1:58:53] to defeat every devil you don't have to
[1:58:56] be anything different
[1:58:56] you don't have to do anything different
[1:58:58] all you have to do is have confidence
[1:59:00] i'm seated in heavenly places in christ
[1:59:02] jesus
[1:59:02] no matter how low i go in the body of
[1:59:04] christ i'm over
[1:59:06] every devil that comes against me
[1:59:10] and all i'm doing in this life is what
[1:59:12] he told me to do
[1:59:15] i'm just abiding in the place he put me
[1:59:18] he made me of this and he made me that
[1:59:20] he made me a man he made me a woman he
[1:59:22] he he made me married he made me single
[1:59:24] he made me whatever
[1:59:25] wherever you are is where god's put you
[1:59:29] what else can you do but abide where
[1:59:31] he's put you
[1:59:33] and you don't have to move if i move to
[1:59:35] this i'll defeat that devil if i become
[1:59:37] a
[1:59:40] no god allow the devil to come take your
[1:59:43] wheat
[1:59:44] then you're the one to drive them out
[1:59:48] samgar also he didn't say oh man
[1:59:51] if i could go get a bunch of my friends
[1:59:54] send out a telegram
[1:59:57] if i could go if we could just if i
[1:59:59] could get some of the levites to come
[2:00:00] down
[2:00:01] if i could just find me the high priest
[2:00:04] if i could just go get a preacher
[2:00:08] no the the levite does what the levite
[2:00:10] does the farmer does what the farmer
[2:00:12] does
[2:00:13] the daddy does and when it comes he
[2:00:16] didn't need
[2:00:17] a priest robe he didn't need an ephod
[2:00:21] all he needed was a farmer's implement
[2:00:24] and
[2:00:24] faith in his position and he had to
[2:00:27] become concerned about what was going on
[2:00:29] and something in him had to rise up and
[2:00:31] say it doesn't have to be
[2:00:33] this way anymore
[2:00:37] see if we get out of position brother
[2:00:39] ram said you're no good at all
[2:00:41] in fact you become a hindrance to
[2:00:43] everybody else's position
[2:00:45] but if you'll stay in position you don't
[2:00:46] have to be anything different
[2:00:49] to win the battle to see the miracle
[2:00:52] to drive back the enemy all we have to
[2:00:54] do is believe
[2:00:56] in who we are and let's read this last
[2:00:59] scripture together
[2:01:01] first corinthians 1.
[2:01:13] first corinthians chapter one
[2:01:19] musicians if you can make your way up
[2:01:22] like if you can come on up first
[2:01:24] corinthians chapter 1 verse 26
[2:01:29] nope i'm in second first corinthians
[2:01:34] chapter 1 verse 26
[2:01:39] for you see your calling brethren how
[2:01:41] not many wise men after the flesh
[2:01:44] not many mighty not many noble are
[2:01:46] called
[2:01:48] but god hath chosen the foolish things
[2:01:49] of this world to confound the wise
[2:01:52] and that god has chosen the weak things
[2:01:54] of this world to confound the things
[2:01:55] which are mighty
[2:01:57] and the base things of the world and the
[2:01:58] things which are despised
[2:02:00] as god chosen yea in the things which
[2:02:02] are not to bring them not the things
[2:02:04] that are
[2:02:05] that no flesh should glory in his
[2:02:08] presence
[2:02:09] but of him are you in christ jesus who
[2:02:11] of god has made unto us wisdom
[2:02:13] and righteousness and sanctification and
[2:02:15] redemption
[2:02:16] that according as it has written he that
[2:02:18] glorieth led him glory
[2:02:21] in the lord
[2:02:24] you can say i'm nothing special that's
[2:02:27] exactly who he chose
[2:02:30] not the wise he chose the foolish things
[2:02:33] not the wise not the strong not the
[2:02:34] mighty
[2:02:35] but he's chose regular farmers and
[2:02:38] shepherds
[2:02:39] and herdsmen amos
[2:02:42] shepherd david shepherd
[2:02:46] shamgar farmer if you read through the
[2:02:49] bible and you look at some of the most
[2:02:51] miraculous things that ever took place
[2:02:53] some of the most supernatural events
[2:02:56] there are times when god would inject
[2:02:58] himself into somebody's normal
[2:03:00] everyday life jesus came to the woman at
[2:03:03] the well when what was she doing she was
[2:03:04] fetching water to go cook and clean
[2:03:08] rebecca came to the well now the eiser
[2:03:10] met her there to have an encounter that
[2:03:12] would forever change her life i mean
[2:03:14] what was she doing she was going doing
[2:03:15] her part
[2:03:16] as a virgin in the house getting the
[2:03:18] water for the household
[2:03:20] what was moses doing when he met the
[2:03:21] pillar of fire he was hurting his
[2:03:23] father's his father-in-law's sheep and
[2:03:26] goats

[2:03:31] into everyday life
[2:03:33] somebody in position doing what they're
[2:03:34] doing and god found them
[2:03:36] god worked through them so many miracles
[2:03:39] so many miracles we read in the bible
[2:03:41] are common people doing common things
[2:03:43] and all of a sudden the crisis hit and
[2:03:45] god uses that crisis to work a miracle
[2:03:48] it wasn't always i mean there are times
[2:03:51] that that an angel would appear when
[2:03:53] somebody's fasting and praying and
[2:03:55] seeking god daniel was laboring in
[2:03:57] prayer when an angel came to him
[2:03:58] but so many times an angel came to them
[2:04:01] when they were just living their life
[2:04:03] supernatural injected just an ordinary
[2:04:06] routine common
[2:04:07] everyday life just doing what god called
[2:04:09] them to do
[2:04:10] doing what position they were in and
[2:04:12] when it was 10 come came time for the
[2:04:13] supernatural god did it
[2:04:16] or in the normal routine of life amen
[2:04:18] they come up against crisis they come up
[2:04:20] against disaster
[2:04:21] they come into great need in god through
[2:04:24] that
[2:04:25] amen through their position through them
[2:04:27] god works a miracle that gets noticed by
[2:04:30] all we want god to do supernatural
[2:04:34] things in our lives don't we
[2:04:36] we want to see god move in our lives we
[2:04:38] want to see
[2:04:39] amen every miracle amen that's available
[2:04:42] every promise that's in the book is ours
[2:04:45] how's he going to do it amen it's not
[2:04:47] going to be at a super duper camp
[2:04:49] meeting
[2:04:51] super duper this it's going to be when
[2:04:54] individuals
[2:04:55] in their position meet a need and god
[2:04:57] raises faith up
[2:04:59] by the word of god to take that land
[2:05:01] back
[2:05:02] take that one back take this one back
[2:05:04] and we'll see god move
[2:05:06] supernaturally in our lives don't look
[2:05:08] for somebody else to do it
