========================================

He says now just like a little dew drop. He said if I understand I don't know too much about chemistry but it must be that it's the congealing of humidity or atmosphere and when the night gets cold and dark it falls from heaven and drops upon the ground. It's fell from somewhere. Listen, I love this because he's talking about you. Amen. This little dew drop on a blade of grass in the morning. He said it fell from somewhere. It existed somewhere else. But I want you to understand this. It existed somewhere else in another form. Amen. It was vapor in another form. Now it's changed form to come into a manifestation upon the earth. He's talking about you. And he says, "I don't understand the chemistry of this." Now he's talking about uh uh mechanically. He doesn't understand the chemistry of the dew drop, but I can say everything he's saying is true about me. And I may not understand the spiritual chemistry of it, but I know it's true. Amen. I may not be able to explain it on on on scientific uh scriptural or or spiritual science. I don't know. But it's the truth. Amen. So, it's the congealing of humidity or atmosphere. And when the night gets cold and dark, it falls from the heavens and drops upon the ground. It's fell from somewhere. But the next morning, before the sun's coming up, it's laying there, the little fellow shivering. But just let the sun come up. Watch it go to shining. It's happy. Why? The sun is going to call it right back to where it came from. That's why this is the rising of the sun. This is shalom. This is good morning. This bright sunlight that's come at the opening of the seals at the at the breaking of the message in our end time. That sun is up to what? To call us back home to change us into another state so that we can go back to where we came from. Amen. Amen. So, it's laying there in the cold dark night just shivering, but the sun comes up and it goes to shining. It's happy. Listen, it's shimmering and shining and happy reflecting the light, but it's still a dew drop on the grass. It's still on this earth. It's still a dew drop on the grass, but it begins to shimmer and reflect the light and get happy because it knows this light is taking me back home. It may not happen right now. Now it might be 5 minutes from now, an hour from now, two hours from now. The time doesn't matter. It knows when it feels the light that I'm going back home. And it can shimmer and shake and be happy and glow in the light of God. That's us on this earth right now. We know we came from somewhere. And in a cold, dark night, amen, something congealed and came together and we've been planted here on the earth. Amen. in the darkness of of obscurity, in the darkness of false religion, in the darkness of of a mind alienated from God. Amen. But praise God, as we laid here in another form, there was the rising of the sun. And when we felt that son of this message kiss us, amen, all of a sudden, we begin to shimmer and reflect the light and get excited and get happy. And you can say, "What are you happy about?" You're not vapor. You haven't had a change of the body. You're still stuck on earth because I know that this sunlight's taking me back to where I was before. And this light will change my state.
