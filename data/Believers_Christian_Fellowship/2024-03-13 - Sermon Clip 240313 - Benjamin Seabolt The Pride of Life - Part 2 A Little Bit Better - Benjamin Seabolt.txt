========================================

this will just apply to the ministering Brothers nobody else this will apply to Brothers if we ever set foot behind this pull pit with the intentions of exposing another Minister we're a Pharisee amen and we're on our way out amen I wish I could tell you that I've never done that amen but I have Amen in righteous inding Nation with the word of God and with quotes and in what I said I was right but the way I said it was wrong you say well we never know we never picked up on it it doesn't matter whether you did or whether you didn't I know here remember Saints the standard has been adjusted the standard has been adjusted the truth Tru has been revealed as we would stand together only the truth can set us free but the truth can't set us free if we won't let it if we'll slam the door in its face and we say that don't apply to me or we whitewash a situation that we did I believe in my heart of hearts there's nobody in this building who's wanting to go out and live in sin and wanting to go out and live in dirt and smut and those things I believe that but remember remember that's not the level we're called to saints that is not the level we're called to we are called to be the very image of Jesus Christ on this Earth and that is going to require us to get real with God get real with ourselves first and realize that we've got some problems and that we are not okay even thinking you're okay is a problem because that is the problem we are going to have to a come to a real honest conference with ourselves and with God and search our lives and see as as the song says see if there be any wicked way in me and if there is reveal that to me that I can repent of that God forbid any of us would walk out of these doors and find ourselves in that leoan condition wretched blind naked that's bad but that's not the worst the worst is knoweth it not we have a word to know we have a word that can reveal to where we can truly know if we're right or not don't forsake it yes Lord don't cover stuff up be real with God be real with yourself
