[10:56] we thank god you know it's a scary time
[11:00] for the world but it's a wonderful time
[11:02] for the bride of christ
[11:04] the world is growing in anxiety but god
[11:07] is continually doing something with us
[11:10] that we're not we don't fear to bring
[11:12] children into this earth
[11:14] because we know that god has a plan for
[11:15] each one and god has a plan for us
[11:18] we don't fear the things that are coming
[11:20] our way because god has already told us
[11:22] he's got a plan for his bride
[11:24] and she will crest every wave amen
[11:28] doesn't mean there won't be waves amen
[11:30] but the outriggers are put on the
[11:31] stabilizers on the ship
[11:32] and this bride this church of god will
[11:34] crest every wave
[11:36] and we see big waves coming but praise
[11:38] god he's given us his word
[11:40] and with his word came the fullness of
[11:42] his spirit and with christ's life in us
[11:44] amen this ship won't sink
[11:48] god is good amen also at the end of the
[11:51] service we'll have a baptism
[11:53] our brother chuck williams has decided
[11:55] he wants to
[11:56] he feels god pulling him him and i had a
[11:58] good conversation yesterday and god's
[11:59] drawing him and he wants to surrender
[12:01] all
[12:01] and he wants to take the lord's name and
[12:03] water baptism so we're very very excited
[12:05] for their family
[12:07] and for his testimony also i want to
[12:10] greet
[12:10] alana is alan and adam here there they
[12:13] are
[12:14] mr and mrs preston god bless you it's
[12:16] good to have you back
[12:18] [Applause]
[12:21] i know that they were here last week but
[12:23] i wasn't here to say mr and mrs preston
[12:25] and i've been looking forward to saying
[12:27] that for a couple weeks now
[12:29] amen god is wonderful is he not and
[12:32] while we're standing let's take our
[12:33] bibles and turn to the book of
[12:36] revelation
[12:39] revelation chapter 12.
[12:49] this message is a message that i
[12:52] preached
[12:54] out in des moines the saturday night
[12:56] that i was there with brother isaiah and
[12:57] his group
[12:58] and i i think i ministered on everything
[13:02] in my notes at one point or another
[13:05] but it seems like god just put it all
[13:07] together amen and i want to just
[13:08] minister it all in
[13:09] and one thought at least the way the
[13:12] lord's leading me
[13:13] and there's so many things here that i
[13:16] want to know more
[13:17] i want god to shine more light on all i
[13:20] know to do is walk in the light he gives
[13:22] and step forward and trust god
[13:24] to illuminate the next step but i want
[13:26] to minister on reconciling heaven and
[13:28] earth
[13:29] i'm going to look at revelation 12 7.
[13:34] and there was war in heaven michael and
[13:36] his angels fought against the dragon
[13:39] and the dragon fought and his angels and
[13:41] prevailed not neither was their place
[13:43] found any more in heaven
[13:45] and the great dragon was cast out that
[13:47] old serpent called the devil
[13:48] and satan which deceiveth the whole
[13:50] world he was cast out in the earth and
[13:52] his angels were cast out with him
[13:55] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[13:56] heaven now has come salvation and
[13:58] strength and the kingdom of our god and
[14:00] the power of his christ for the accuser
[14:02] of our brethren is cast down
[14:04] which accuses them before our god
[14:07] day and night and they overcame him by
[14:10] the blood of the lamb
[14:11] and by the word of their testimony and
[14:13] they loved not their lives
[14:15] unto death let's bow our heads and ask
[14:18] the lord to bless the reading of his
[14:19] word lord jesus
[14:22] we thank you god for this word that
[14:23] you've given to us
[14:25] god it is so precious and so dear to us
[14:29] and god you went through great lengths
[14:30] lord in a manifestation of this hour to
[14:33] vindicate this word
[14:35] so that we would trust the word that
[14:36] you've given to us
[14:38] so that you would open the book for us
[14:40] lord and give it to us and that we might
[14:42] eat it lord
[14:43] and when we eat that lord we can
[14:45] prophesy again
[14:46] and i pray god that you'd help us to
[14:48] speak your word to live your word to
[14:50] manifest this word in the fullness of
[14:53] its power
[14:54] we ask that you bless everything that we
[14:56] would say and do and may you have
[14:57] preeminence among us
[14:59] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[15:02] you can have your seats
[15:08] amen i appreciate you praying for me my
[15:11] coughing is getting
[15:12] much much better i know how these
[15:14] allergy things work and it tends to have
[15:15] a path for me and that's just a
[15:17] little weakness in my body that i have
[15:19] to deal with but as i said god has been
[15:21] tremendous this year and has blessed me
[15:23] and given me help
[15:24] and i just trust that god's going to
[15:26] continue to help me so i appreciate your
[15:27] prayers
[15:28] amen we see here now i want to look at
[15:32] this last verse again
[15:33] verse 11 and they overcame him by the
[15:37] blood of the lamb
[15:38] and by the word of their testimony and
[15:40] they love not their lives
[15:42] unto death i think this is wonderful
[15:45] that the believer does not love his life
[15:47] unto death that he'll die to himself to
[15:50] take the word
[15:51] he'll die to himself to let this word
[15:53] live and then he'll surrender all
[15:57] in the message that day on calvary the
[15:59] prophet of god said sin did not start on
[16:02] earth
[16:03] sin started in heaven lucifer the devil
[16:06] was a condemned creature for his
[16:07] disobedience before he ever struck the
[16:09] earth
[16:10] sin began in heaven this is so important
[16:13] to note
[16:14] there's a reason brother branham goes
[16:15] through this so much and so much
[16:17] you know god has given us so much in
[16:19] this message that it has taken us
[16:21] decades amen to begin to see
[16:23] what god has already given amen he's
[16:26] given it to us and he's continually
[16:27] unfolding his word
[16:29] amen and i just want to make this
[16:30] statement this is completely off a
[16:32] sidebar i think it's a sidebar
[16:34] of what i intend to say this day but you
[16:36] know as god is continually revealing his
[16:38] word to us and unveiling
[16:40] amen he came and he delivered the
[16:42] message to us through a prophetic
[16:44] ministry
[16:45] and that message was able to to open the
[16:48] book amen and show us what
[16:50] god had written in the word and what he
[16:51] intended by that word
[16:53] and that message amen did that for us
[16:55] but the message is still unfolding
[16:57] itself there's
[16:58] treasures that are in there that lay
[17:00] undiscovered amen maybe somebody had
[17:03] found them but but
[17:04] we ourselves are continually seeing more
[17:06] and more and more
[17:07] and it's it's the unveiling of god and
[17:10] when the message came
[17:11] god did not have to give us a new bible
[17:13] the message came to illuminate what was
[17:14] already in the bible
[17:16] and god now doesn't have to bring us a
[17:18] new message amen god finished the work
[17:20] through the prophet but he's continually
[17:22] unveiling what he's given us out of this
[17:24] word
[17:26] and if god continues to do that amen we
[17:29] should see a continuation of the life of
[17:32] christ on the increase amen not the
[17:34] decrease
[17:35] because every denomination as they
[17:37] denominate you'll see
[17:38] generational slip
[17:41] think about every movement of god you
[17:43] see generational slip
[17:45] amen there was a generation that caught
[17:47] amen the fresh revelation from god they
[17:49] were feeding on the fresh manna
[17:51] it changed their lives it transformed
[17:53] them amen and then they would start a
[17:54] movement they would start a denomination
[17:56] to protect this thing that god gave them
[17:58] but then you can see generation by
[18:00] generation it slips
[18:01] until the wesleyan movement the
[18:03] methodist movement is nothing like the
[18:05] methodist movement was
[18:06] when it was first formed john wesley
[18:10] amen he would he would do be doing
[18:13] flip-flops in his
[18:14] grave if he knew what the methodist
[18:15] church was allowing and what they were
[18:17] participating in
[18:19] same thing with the pentecostal fathers
[18:21] in azusa street in 1906 they would just
[18:23] they would be grieved to know end to
[18:25] know what was happening with the
[18:26] pentecostal church and movement
[18:28] amen but it's because god was continuing
[18:31] to unveil
[18:32] and they quit moving with the light and
[18:34] they've been begin to digress
[18:36] but this day is not supposed to be like
[18:38] any other day amen
[18:40] this is a day when god has brought the
[18:42] fullness of his word
[18:43] and we are to take the book and eat the
[18:45] book amen
[18:46] and if doing so and if god is continuing
[18:49] to reveal himself
[18:50] in this message in this word then we
[18:52] should not see a generational slam
[18:55] but we should be seeing a generational
[18:56] climb that every generation in this
[18:59] message should be growing in revelation
[19:01] and the growth in revelation should
[19:03] produce more of the life of christ
[19:06] and we shouldn't get comfortable with
[19:08] things digressing amen
[19:10] that's not what the word came for the
[19:12] world came to bring us into a perfect
[19:14] rapturing condition
[19:16] we shouldn't see morality slipping we
[19:18] know we shouldn't see holiness slipping
[19:20] we shouldn't see our family lives
[19:21] slipping we shouldn't see per
[19:23] we should not see slipping but we should
[19:26] see by the revelation of the word in
[19:27] this hour
[19:28] a steady climbing to the likeness of
[19:30] jesus christ
[19:31] amen so that the whole harvest comes
[19:33] into the same maturity that we saw in
[19:35] the wave
[19:39] so it's not time to get comfortable with
[19:41] slippage
[19:43] that's a sign of denomination
[19:47] it's a sign that a denominational spirit
[19:49] has slipped in somewhere
[19:51] and i saw god keep us from that
[19:54] keep us steadily pursuing after god
[19:58] climbing word by word revelation upon
[20:01] revelation more into his likeness day by
[20:04] day
[20:08] sin began in heaven
[20:11] it didn't start on earth it began in
[20:13] heaven
[20:16] and we're still on that message that day
[20:18] on calvary
[20:19] sin began in heaven where god put the
[20:21] angels
[20:22] and so forth upon the same bases that he
[20:24] put human beings on
[20:26] knowledge the tree of knowledge the tree
[20:27] of life and the tree of knowledge
[20:31] you think well that didn't start until
[20:33] eden brother brenham said he already
[20:35] started it
[20:36] back there in heaven he put the angels
[20:38] on the same bases he put man on
[20:40] amen and and so they chose and and don't
[20:43] get caught up in
[20:45] and don't get locked down in terminology
[20:47] amen brother branham's using it as an
[20:49] example tree of knowledge tree of life
[20:51] amen and he's saying they had that
[20:53] choice amen
[20:55] and man couldn't take his choice and
[20:56] when lucifer was given the preeminence
[20:58] to make his choice
[20:59] he wanted something better than god had
[21:02] that
[21:02] started the trouble
[21:06] and the message let your light so shine
[21:08] before men he says do you know
[21:09] what caused the first battle in heaven
[21:11] was when lucifer set up a greater class
[21:14] of people
[21:15] got a better class of angels he thought
[21:17] a bigger
[21:18] a big and better kingdom a more brighter
[21:21] shinier kingdom than michael had
[21:23] and he was kicked out of heaven
[21:26] i think this is interesting and i just
[21:28] want to make mention of this where we
[21:29] look at this
[21:32] if lucifer looked at the kingdom of
[21:36] michael
[21:37] and he thought that he could do better
[21:41] he could have better than what god had
[21:44] that he could do something more or
[21:47] brighter or
[21:48] shinier or better we know that that
[21:52] that lucifer was made the brightest
[21:55] and the most beautiful of all the
[21:57] cherubims he was made in splendor he was
[21:59] made
[22:00] absolutely stunning and in that
[22:03] in that stunningness in that beauty that
[22:05] he had in wisdom
[22:07] he felt like he could do better and the
[22:09] point that i want to get to is
[22:11] god must not have done the maximum
[22:15] splendor that he could have created
[22:19] think about this do you think god could
[22:22] make lucifer so beautiful more beautiful
[22:24] than anything else
[22:25] he could make the kingdom of michael any
[22:27] way he wanted to make it
[22:28] but god didn't make it to the maximum
[22:31] and beauty to the maximum in splendor
[22:35] because that's not what god's looking
[22:37] for god's looking for
[22:38] character god wants the maximum
[22:40] character the maximum
[22:42] nature of god the maximum life of god
[22:44] not the maximum splendor not the maximum
[22:47] grandeur
[22:48] not the maximum wisdom that's not what
[22:50] god wants he made lucifer that way
[22:52] but he made michael's kingdom different
[22:54] than he made lucifer
[22:56] and he didn't do it to the maximum
[22:58] splendor the maximum luster
[23:02] and you say why amen it was reflecting
[23:05] god's nature
[23:07] and it also became a trap for the devil
[23:11] let's look at ezekiel 28 just so we can
[23:13] get this description again
[23:16] this is not foreign to us but i just
[23:18] want to read it again there's a few
[23:19] things
[23:20] i'd like to point out ezekiel 28 verse
[23:24] 11
[23:26] this is a prophecy against the king of
[23:27] tyre but it's really against the spirit
[23:29] that was behind the king of tyre
[23:31] which is the spirit of satan
[23:35] and ezekiel 28 verse 11 says
[23:38] moreover the word of the lord came unto
[23:40] me saying son of man take up a
[23:41] lamentation upon the king of tyrus
[23:44] and say unto him thus saith the lord god
[23:46] thou sealest up the psalm full of wisdom
[23:49] and perfect in beauty thou has been in
[23:52] eden the garden of god
[23:53] every precious stone was thy covering
[23:56] this artist
[23:56] topaz the diamond the barrel the onyx
[23:59] the jasper
[24:00] the sapphire the emerald and the
[24:02] carbuncle and gold
[24:04] and the workmanship of thy tabrts and of
[24:05] thy pipes was prepared in thee
[24:07] and the day that that was created thou
[24:10] art the anointed cherub that covereth
[24:12] and i have set thee so
[24:14] thou wasted upon the holy mountain of
[24:16] god thou has walked up and down in the
[24:18] midst of the stones of fire
[24:20] that was perfect in thy ways from the
[24:22] day that thou was created
[24:24] till iniquity was found in thee
[24:27] by the multitude of thy merchandise they
[24:29] have filled the midst of thee with
[24:31] violence
[24:32] and thou has sinned therefore i will
[24:34] cast his profane out of the mountain of
[24:36] god
[24:36] and i will destroy the o covering cherub
[24:39] from the midst
[24:40] of the stones of fire thine heart was
[24:43] lifted up because of thy beauty
[24:46] thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[24:48] of thy brightness
[24:49] i will cast thee to the ground i will
[24:51] lay thee before kings that they
[24:53] may behold thee thou has defiled thy
[24:56] sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
[24:58] iniquities
[24:59] by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore
[25:02] will i bring forth a fire from the midst
[25:04] of thee
[25:04] it shall devour thee and i will bring to
[25:06] thee to ashes upon the earth in the
[25:08] sight of all them that behold thee
[25:10] and they that know know thee among the
[25:13] people
[25:14] shall be astonished at thee thou shalt
[25:16] be a terror and never shalt thou be
[25:18] any more at some point this great
[25:21] creature that was created
[25:23] by god will be no more
[25:29] there is a path for lucifer from his
[25:32] creation
[25:33] to his annihilation in the path of
[25:37] lucifer from creation to annihilation
[25:40] amen is a path that will serve god's
[25:43] purpose
[25:45] god was not tripped up by lucifer god
[25:47] was not tricked by lucifer god was not
[25:50] surprised by lucifer because he knew the
[25:53] end from the beginning
[25:56] god knew it would be and then in order
[25:58] to display his attributes
[26:00] he needed an adversary and that's what
[26:02] satan means lucifer became
[26:04] satan and satan means adversary and so
[26:07] he became god's adversary
[26:09] so that in the face of an adversary all
[26:12] the attributes and characteristics of
[26:14] god could be on display
[26:16] so god when he was creating this lucifer
[26:19] he did not create him with a fork stick
[26:22] and a tail pointy tail and
[26:24] horns and an ugly vile looking creature
[26:27] amen but god made him the most beautiful
[26:30] the most desirable he had the
[26:34] all the precious stones were created in
[26:36] him when the day he was made
[26:37] the tabath and the pipes and everything
[26:40] was in him he was full of wisdom he was
[26:42] full of beauty
[26:43] he was beautiful to behold amen but
[26:46] but he he was corrupted
[26:50] he corrupted himself he was deceived by
[26:53] his own brightness
[26:54] he was corrupted by his own beauty amen
[26:57] all those things that god
[26:59] gave him he began to get lifted up in
[27:01] pride
[27:02] amen and within himself he began to accr
[27:05] corrupt himself and iniquity was found
[27:08] in him and iniquity is to know to
[27:10] do good and do it not or to know to do
[27:13] something and refuse to do it
[27:15] there was something that that that
[27:17] lucifer knew
[27:18] in the laws of god and the commandments
[27:20] of god and the structure that god had
[27:22] set
[27:23] in this heavenly realm he the lucifer
[27:25] knew these laws
[27:27] and he transgressed the laws of god
[27:30] by his iniquity he chose not to obey
[27:34] and when he made that choice amen he had
[27:36] the choice the same choice man had amen
[27:39] he could choose
[27:40] life or he could choose the knowledge of
[27:41] tree of good and evil and he chose the
[27:43] wrong one
[27:44] but he was deceived by his own
[27:45] brightness and his own own beauty
[27:48] and he made the wrong choice and when he
[27:50] made the wrong choice
[27:51] sin began in heaven so god
[27:55] we know brother man tells us before
[27:56] there was anything a molecule stardust
[27:58] anything
[27:59] there was just there was just god only
[28:01] he wasn't yet god
[28:03] he was elohim the self-existing one
[28:07] because god is an object of worship in
[28:09] order to be god
[28:10] he had to first make a creation that
[28:12] would worship him so he created angels
[28:14] and cherubims and seraphims and the
[28:15] heavenly hosts
[28:16] and they began to worship him making him
[28:18] god and in that creation he also made
[28:21] lucifer
[28:21] and remember lucifer be used to worship
[28:24] god
[28:27] until iniquity was found in him he was
[28:30] corrupted by
[28:32] his own beauty and my reason of his own
[28:34] brightness
[28:38] and see that's why
[28:43] when brother brennan makes a statement
[28:45] the way up is down
[28:47] if you want to see how great you can
[28:49] become see how little you can get
[28:51] brother ben's not just making a cutesy
[28:53] statement he's talking the very
[28:55] nature of god all the way back to the
[28:57] beginning he's understanding god could
[28:59] have made michael's kingdom greater but
[29:01] he didn't
[29:03] he made it more humble lucifer was the
[29:05] brightest and the greatest
[29:07] amen because that was going to become a
[29:09] deception to him he's going to be
[29:10] deceived by that
[29:11] and so so we shouldn't seek after those
[29:14] things but we should be content with
[29:15] where god gave us
[29:16] and after looking at these things and
[29:18] and looking at what god has done
[29:20] and how he has constructed uh the his
[29:23] system and his plan
[29:24] who he's always used who he's always
[29:26] chosen who
[29:27] he considers to be great and who the
[29:29] world considers to be great
[29:31] amen i come to the conclusion that
[29:33] slightly below average is a fine place
[29:35] for me
[29:36] i'm satisfied with what god has done i'm
[29:39] not trying to become
[29:40] anything that i'm not but i'm happy
[29:42] being what i am because god made it in a
[29:44] humble fashion he made it in a way
[29:46] without tremendous abilities without
[29:48] without tremendous backing or support
[29:50] why did god do that because he that's
[29:52] the way he did
[29:53] michael's kingdom in heaven
[29:57] amen and god's bride is going to be the
[29:59] same way and what's the mystery the
[30:01] mystery is not she's the biggest most
[30:02] powerful most beautiful
[30:04] with the greatest wisdom and the
[30:05] greatest minds of all time amen the
[30:07] mystery
[30:08] is that she's a humble little bride but
[30:09] she's his chosen
[30:11] and within her is the very character
[30:13] nature and life of god almighty
[30:17] that's the mystery that's the mystery
[30:19] that's been so
[30:20] hard for for the devil to catch because
[30:23] he doesn't
[30:24] understand humility he looked at you
[30:27] he looked at humility in michael's
[30:29] kingdom and thought he could override it
[30:31] he looked at humility
[30:32] in jesus christ and he thought he could
[30:34] override it he looked at humility
[30:36] and david thought he could override it
[30:38] he always thought that he could override
[30:40] that humility but he didn't realize
[30:42] that underneath the humility is a
[30:44] strength that's not that individuals but
[30:46] that strength comes from an attribute of
[30:48] almighty god
[30:49] because god doesn't show off his power
[30:52] because god's character god's nature
[30:54] is his power on display
[30:58] and so satan doesn't understand that
[31:02] so that's why god would pick a hillbilly
[31:05] from kentucky with a seventh grade
[31:07] education
[31:07] no formal bible training to be the
[31:09] prophet of the age
[31:14] because satan doesn't comprehend that he
[31:16] doesn't work that way
[31:18] he builds schools and makes bigger
[31:19] schools
[31:21] he gets degrees and he makes greater
[31:23] degrees
[31:24] he builds churches and builds bigger
[31:26] churches
[31:28] but god keeps moving right along coming
[31:29] through as humble servants
[31:37] he goes on to say in christ is the
[31:38] mystery of god revealed
[31:40] notice lucifer in the last days is doing
[31:43] as he did
[31:44] at first when did lucifer do the first
[31:46] thing that lucifer done to separate the
[31:48] fellowship of god and man
[31:50] he wanted to build him a united kingdom
[31:53] a greater splendor and seemingly more
[31:55] cultured a greater kingdom than michael
[31:57] christ had now now if you miss it just
[32:00] hold up your hand i'll say it again you
[32:01] see
[32:02] lucifer at the beginning his purpose and
[32:04] heart was to achieve a brighter
[32:06] and greater thing in heaven than christ
[32:08] had is that right
[32:10] by seemingly a more cultured more
[32:12] beautiful more splendor
[32:14] than the kingdom of christ
[32:17] let's turn to isaiah 14.
[32:23] and lay this passage in here as well
[32:27] and of isaiah 14 verse 12
[32:36] how art thou fallen from heaven o
[32:39] lucifer
[32:40] son of the morning
[32:44] how art thou cut down to the ground
[32:45] which did weaken the nations
[32:48] i want you to notice lucifer has a title
[32:51] in ezekiel he's the
[32:53] anointed cherub the covering cherub
[32:56] in isaiah he's the son of the morning or
[32:59] the son of the dawn
[33:01] or the son of the beginning and christ
[33:04] is called the morning star
[33:06] so you see how close they are judas
[33:10] and jesus were both out of the tribe of
[33:12] judah
[33:13] they were close it's always so close but
[33:16] lucifer was the son of the morning
[33:17] he was he was the great one in the
[33:20] beginning amen
[33:21] but there was a morning star and that
[33:23] morning star was masked in humility but
[33:25] the sun of the morning was given
[33:27] grandeur and beauty
[33:32] the lucifer sun of the morning how art
[33:34] thou cut down
[33:35] to the ground which did weaken the
[33:38] nations
[33:39] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[33:40] send them to heaven
[33:42] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[33:44] of god
[33:45] that's you and i i will sit also upon
[33:49] the mount of the congregation in the
[33:50] sides of the north
[33:52] i will ascend above the heights of the
[33:54] clouds i will be
[33:55] like the most high yet thou shalt be
[33:58] brought down to hell to the sides
[34:01] of the pit so lucifer had
[34:04] an ambition about him something that he
[34:06] wanted to achieve
[34:07] that wasn't god's plan for him and
[34:09] wasn't what where god placed him
[34:11] he had a position and his position was a
[34:14] tremendous position as son of the
[34:15] morning
[34:16] as covering cherub but he wasn't happy
[34:18] with his position
[34:20] because he was so bright and so
[34:21] beautiful amen
[34:23] he couldn't be satisfied because he had
[34:24] no humility he had to have
[34:27] more and when he went to reach for more
[34:29] he fell
[34:31] and so he thought by his own willpower
[34:34] and his own brightness and his own
[34:36] intellect
[34:36] he could gain these things and gain the
[34:39] victory in heaven
[34:40] but he was cast out and that day on
[34:43] calvary brother bam says for satan had
[34:45] the earth
[34:47] the very rocks that once walked up and
[34:50] that
[34:50] the very rocks that he once walked them
[34:52] and down on the earth burning brimstone
[34:54] lucifer was the sun of the morning and
[34:56] he walked on the earth when it was a
[34:58] burning volcano
[35:00] i'm reading this for a purpose because
[35:02] brother branham is pointing out
[35:03] that satan when he was lucifer and he
[35:06] had a
[35:06] tremendous position and back when the
[35:09] earth was being formed
[35:10] when it was volcanoes and eruptions and
[35:12] burning he said satan
[35:14] walked upon the face of the earth look
[35:17] at what else he says in 1957 in the
[35:19] message what does it take
[35:20] to make a christian life he said let's
[35:23] take before there
[35:24] in the beginning of the world now the
[35:26] lily come from the earth
[35:28] so did you if that be so then we were
[35:31] here
[35:31] our bodies were on this earth before
[35:33] there was any life here
[35:35] we are made of the 16 different elements
[35:37] of the earth the potash
[35:38] calcium petroleum cosmic light and so
[35:40] forth and held together by atoms 16
[35:42] elements of the earth
[35:44] then if that is so which is
[35:45] scientifically so
[35:47] then our bodies were laying spread out
[35:49] on this earth before there was any type
[35:51] of life on the earth
[35:53] and you wonder if you're predestinated
[35:55] or not
[35:58] potash calcium petroleum cosmic light
[36:00] was here in the creation
[36:02] as the volcanic was thrown out they tell
[36:04] us that burst and form the materials of
[36:06] the earth and so forth
[36:08] was it just a burning brimstone it was
[36:10] when it
[36:11] it was just a burning brimstone as it
[36:13] was satan's possession
[36:15] as he walked up and down the fiery
[36:17] brimstone of the earth
[36:21] in ezekiel it tells us thou have walked
[36:23] amongst the stones of fire
[36:26] and brother ben's telling us that that
[36:29] the earth in that original when it was
[36:31] originally made
[36:32] amen it became satan's possession he was
[36:34] walking
[36:35] through the stones of fire and the
[36:37] creation of the earth
[36:39] when there was a burning brimstone satan
[36:41] it was satan's possession as he walked
[36:43] up and down the fiery brimstone to the
[36:45] earth
[36:46] and then when god cooled it off and set
[36:48] it over there in his great mind
[36:50] he had something in his mind that he was
[36:52] going to do
[36:54] when god was bursting the volcanoes upon
[36:57] the
[36:57] this this planet amen i don't know i
[37:00] don't we don't have
[37:02] enough information to know what exactly
[37:05] was taking place
[37:06] but the prophet of god tells us that
[37:07] this was satan's possession
[37:09] as he walked amongst the stones of fire
[37:11] when god was forming this earth
[37:13] and then god would later take that
[37:15] molten earth and he would cool it off
[37:17] that's what he said
[37:18] then god would cool it off and set it
[37:20] over here in his great
[37:22] mind he had something in his mind that
[37:24] he was going to do
[37:25] back then when satan was walking upon it
[37:28] and
[37:28] the volcano's bursting and the molten
[37:31] rocks flying
[37:32] god had a purpose in his mind for what
[37:34] he was doing
[37:37] let's turn to genesis chapter 1.
[37:49] genesis chapter 1 verse 1.
[37:56] in the beginning god created the heaven
[37:59] and the earth and the earth was without
[38:02] form and void and darkness was upon the
[38:04] face of the deep and the spirit of god
[38:06] moved upon the face
[38:07] of the waters brother bam teaches us
[38:10] that there's a gap between genesis 1 1
[38:12] and genesis 1
[38:12] 2 that there's a space of time something
[38:15] had happened there was an original
[38:17] creation and he tells us
[38:18] that as it was being created in the
[38:20] volcanics bursting that that was satan's
[38:21] possession
[38:22] and satan walked upon the earth at that
[38:24] time amen
[38:25] but then something happened on that
[38:28] earth on that creation
[38:30] and we find it here in the beginning of
[38:31] the bible it was without form and void
[38:33] and darkness was on the face of the deep
[38:35] amen it was covered in water again as if
[38:38] the earth had been
[38:39] judged and we don't know a lot about
[38:43] that and i don't want to
[38:44] presume and make up stuff about that but
[38:47] brother benham tells us clearly
[38:49] that that was satan's possession and
[38:50] satan walked upon that and now we look
[38:53] in genesis 1 2 and find that it's in a
[38:54] state of judgment
[38:57] something happened i don't know what
[38:59] happened but something happened
[39:02] and now the earth is void and without
[39:05] form
[39:05] and darkness is upon the face of the
[39:07] deep and god
[39:09] already before it gets to this condition
[39:11] amen before satan walked upon it in its
[39:14] volcanic condition
[39:15] god had a plan a purpose for this earth
[39:18] and everything's working according to
[39:19] this purpose
[39:20] so that when god comes here and now the
[39:22] earth is void and full of darkness
[39:24] and that water covers the face of the
[39:26] earth he already has a plan
[39:29] god is not just reacting to what satan
[39:32] has done he's not just reacting to a
[39:33] situation
[39:34] amen he's working out his plan there is
[39:37] a plan there is something he's trying to
[39:38] achieve
[39:39] and everything is working according to
[39:41] god's purpose
[39:42] and god's plan so whatever happened back
[39:45] there
[39:46] i don't know i don't know if it was
[39:48] linked to the war in heaven i don't know
[39:50] if it happened after he was cast out of
[39:51] heaven and come to the earth and there
[39:53] was another corruption on earth
[39:54] before we get to genesis 1 2 i don't
[39:57] know
[39:59] your guess is as good as mine all i know
[40:01] it was his possession at that time
[40:04] and he would brother ben called him
[40:05] satan and satan his adversary
[40:07] so it seems like after he was cast out
[40:09] he come to this possession
[40:10] but something happened to it and now
[40:12] it's in judgment
[40:15] and god is going to begin to reform it
[40:18] to continue on with his purpose
[40:20] and with his plan there's a lot of
[40:24] things
[40:25] that we don't know but what we do know
[40:27] is amazing
[40:29] what we do know is breathtaking
[40:33] that god has had a plan
[40:36] from before the foundation of the world
[40:39] and nothing that lucifer satan has done
[40:42] has stopped god's plan
[40:44] it has only the only thing that lucifer
[40:46] and satan has done
[40:48] is activated god's plan and kept it
[40:50] moving along
[40:53] he hasn't stopped it he hasn't
[40:55] railroaded
[40:56] it what he's done is the ultimate plan
[40:58] that was in god's
[40:59] mind the great thing that he wanted to
[41:01] achieve remember he had one great
[41:04] purpose one great achievement that he
[41:06] wanted to achieve
[41:07] and to come in a three-fold manner what
[41:09] was this great thing this purpose in
[41:10] god's mind he wanted to achieve
[41:12] it was the manifestation of the seventh
[41:14] seal it was god becoming tangible upon
[41:17] the earth
[41:18] god becoming a family god having
[41:21] fellowship with his attributes his
[41:22] attributes coming into materialization
[41:24] and and fellowshipping together as a
[41:26] family that was god's great goal god's
[41:28] great plan from before the foundation of
[41:30] the world
[41:31] and lucifer can't stop that plan
[41:34] i'll tell you he's the son of the
[41:35] morning he's been around a long time
[41:38] he was here before the formation of the
[41:40] earth he was here when the earth was
[41:41] being formed under volcanics he was a
[41:43] possessor of it
[41:44] at that time he was here amen he was
[41:47] doing all kinds of things
[41:48] rebellion in heaven war in heaven
[41:50] deceiving angels he's been here a long
[41:53] time
[41:55] he's been around a long time
[41:59] but i've existed in the thoughts of god
[42:01] longer than he
[42:04] amen god had thoughts amen and those
[42:06] thoughts were his attributes and they
[42:08] were attributes of himself
[42:09] and the desire of a manifestation of
[42:11] himself and a fellowship with himself
[42:14] amen and in order to bring that
[42:16] fellowship about
[42:17] with all the family of god having an
[42:19] understanding of the nature of god
[42:21] he needed an adversary and in his mind
[42:23] he would he would we would think of the
[42:25] very best adversary he could have
[42:27] to bring out all his qualities and
[42:28] lucifer was made in perfection
[42:30] and in beauty and in wisdom and with
[42:33] every gift imaginable with all splendor
[42:35] that you could possibly pack in
[42:36] because god needed a worthy adversary
[42:38] because before he thought of lucifer he
[42:40] thought of you
[42:43] he thought of you upon this earth in
[42:45] this day manifesting an attribute of god
[42:48] before he created the adversary
[42:50] and before the adversary became an
[42:52] adversary
[42:56] he still had a plan
[43:01] brother chad that's you're getting the
[43:03] deep waters no it's simple friends
[43:07] if we can see there's a reason the
[43:09] prophet of god explained these things
[43:11] there's a reason that these things are
[43:12] in the bible
[43:13] amen it's there so you and i would know
[43:15] nothing is out of kilter
[43:17] everything's ticking right on time i
[43:19] don't need to be afraid i don't mean to
[43:20] be nervous
[43:21] hey listen things happen in our lives we
[43:23] live in bodies of flesh
[43:24] we have pressures that come anxieties
[43:26] that build but we need to come back to
[43:28] the revelation that was before this
[43:30] trouble amen
[43:31] before there was a sickness before there
[43:33] was a financial need before i had
[43:34] problems at work before there was stress
[43:36] in my family
[43:37] before that just keep going back and
[43:39] going back
[43:40] and going back and going back until you
[43:42] can go back so far
[43:44] that you realize everything's under
[43:46] control i have nothing to be afraid of
[43:49] we're not preaching deep to preach deep
[43:51] we're talking about things that have
[43:52] been given to us so that we will realize
[43:54] that there's nothing that we need to be
[43:56] afraid of on this earth there's nothing
[43:58] we need to be
[43:59] worried about or stress about or have
[44:01] anxiety about we need to rest and keep
[44:03] walking
[44:04] and if we will learn to rest and keep
[44:06] walking you will watch supernatural god
[44:08] will rearrange all the events in your
[44:10] life
[44:10] because he had a plan before the
[44:12] foundation of the world before volcanics
[44:14] broke out
[44:15] before war in heaven before it all he
[44:17] had a plan
[44:20] and lucifer has not been able to derail
[44:22] his plan yet he's not going to be able
[44:24] to do it today
[44:36] brother brahm says in the fourth seal
[44:39] said i was talking to a person not long
[44:41] ago he was trying to discuss with me and
[44:43] saying
[44:43] aren't you ashamed to say that god
[44:45] created the heavens and earth and
[44:46] in six days i said that's what the bible
[44:50] said he said well we've got evidence and
[44:53] can prove that the world is millions of
[44:54] years old
[44:55] i said that didn't have anything to do
[44:57] with them
[44:59] that don't have anything to do with it
[45:00] in genesis 1 1 it said in the beginning
[45:02] god created heavens and earth period see
[45:04] that's all now the world without form
[45:06] and void
[45:07] and he said i believe every seed was
[45:09] laying right there from some
[45:10] other civilization or something
[45:14] and your guess is as good as mine on
[45:16] that i've given you all the information
[45:17] i got so far
[45:20] but we know satan was the possessor of
[45:22] the earth at that time
[45:24] we know he walked among them but what
[45:27] happened we don't know
[45:28] and how it happened we don't know but
[45:31] brother bam says i believe every seed
[45:33] was laying right there
[45:35] from some other civilization or
[45:37] something and as soon as the water
[45:39] lifted off and the light struck it
[45:41] up come the trees and everything the
[45:44] same thing in human beings it's a time
[45:47] when the mist is moved away and revealed
[45:49] truth to the real seedling they're
[45:51] still germatized and the light of the
[45:53] gospel can strike it by a true
[45:55] vindication of the word it'll live it's
[45:57] got life
[45:58] outside of that it can't live it hasn't
[46:00] got no life in them
[46:04] god is showing through the prophet here
[46:07] that in the beginning
[46:08] when he began to speak to this creation
[46:10] that was now
[46:12] amen genesis 1 2 amen now
[46:15] void and without form darkness covering
[46:18] the face of the deep
[46:19] but the spirit of god was hovering over
[46:21] it and he began to speak and as the
[46:23] spoken word came forth he began to move
[46:25] things into a certain condition to
[46:27] create a certain atmosphere
[46:28] amen and god wasn't working randomly but
[46:30] he was working very specifically
[46:32] and he spoke a very specific word to
[46:34] bring a very specific result to get a
[46:36] very specific condition
[46:38] to bring forth a seed that he knew that
[46:40] was already laying down there under the
[46:42] water
[46:43] and god moved in such a way that that
[46:46] seed that was already dermatized already
[46:48] had life in it that that sea would
[46:50] spring forth and what god was doing in
[46:52] the in the in the recreation of the
[46:54] earth and the reforming of the earth
[46:56] he was showing amen that that down in
[46:58] there there was already seeds that god
[47:00] had created by spoken word some time
[47:03] before
[47:03] and those spoken word seeds were laying
[47:06] in there amen under a judgment condition
[47:09] but he was by the spoken word going to
[47:11] create a condition
[47:12] that'll begin to part waters and bring
[47:14] light and create atmosphere
[47:15] and when the light would finally get to
[47:17] that sea it would spring forth the life
[47:19] because it had life on the inside
[47:21] and he was typing our redemption amen he
[47:23] was typing our conversion amen because
[47:26] we come to this life
[47:27] and when we come to this life buried
[47:29] down under a state of judgment because
[47:31] you were born in a judged condition
[47:34] and when you're born in a judge
[47:36] conditioned because of sexual birth
[47:38] amen you're shrouded in darkness amen
[47:41] but god by a spoken word is going to
[47:43] begin to speak his word
[47:44] and it's going to begin moving the
[47:46] darkness back and separating the light
[47:48] from the darkness and
[47:49] bringing an atmosphere and bringing a
[47:51] light that will penetrate
[47:53] and when that light hits that seed down
[47:55] inside in your soul
[47:56] amen it's already got life in it it has
[47:59] life in it from some previous
[48:01] civilization or something
[48:04] something from before something from
[48:06] before the state of judgment
[48:08] there was life in there from before you
[48:10] come into the state of judgment
[48:14] and when the light hits that life it
[48:16] springs forth to life and that begins to
[48:18] grow and take over your life
[48:20] brother random is showing that god was
[48:22] showing us our regeneration
[48:24] our new birth
[48:29] he says in the message one in a million
[48:33] did you ever notice a seed as reverend
[48:35] pitts was speaking a few
[48:37] moments ago how a seed goes into the
[48:38] ground many seeds are there in the
[48:40] ground when god moved upon the water
[48:42] with the light and the light brought
[48:43] forth
[48:44] the first presence of god spoken light
[48:47] come by god's word and god's word is the
[48:49] only thing
[48:50] that still brings a light and when the
[48:53] waters went back the seed was already in
[48:55] the earth
[48:56] and the light only brought forth the
[48:58] seeds that remained with german them
[49:02] the light only brought forth the seeds
[49:03] that remain with german
[49:06] not all the seeds but the seeds with the
[49:09] germ of life inside
[49:12] that light will bring forth not every
[49:15] one
[49:16] but those with life inside
[49:23] now on easter morning there was another
[49:25] light struck the earth
[49:26] when the holy spirit was given and it's
[49:28] given to bring life to those seeds that
[49:30] god by his foreknowledge
[49:32] knew that would be here on the earth as
[49:34] he knew the first natural seed he knows
[49:36] where the
[49:36] spiritual seed is your body was laying
[49:39] here right then on the earth when god
[49:41] first brought the earth into existence
[49:44] my goodness if god laid the elements for
[49:47] your body
[49:48] knowing that down the road he would need
[49:50] these elements to make your body
[49:52] when something begins to happen to your
[49:54] body why don't we turn to the one who
[49:56] laid the elements here before the
[49:57] foundation of the world
[49:58] and say god i need help with this body
[50:02] you lay the elements out here like he
[50:04] says like a great contractor he lays it
[50:05] all out
[50:06] he knows he's going to be building in
[50:07] each stage that he's going to build
[50:09] until he gets to completion and he lays
[50:10] all his material out
[50:12] and the material for your flesh body was
[50:14] laid here when he first formed the world
[50:17] and if you're having problems with your
[50:19] flesh body with the material that was
[50:20] laid here
[50:21] turn to the one who laid it here and had
[50:23] a plan for it
[50:24] and still has a plan today and say god
[50:27] this is the situation
[50:28] but i know you laid these elements on
[50:30] this earth to form this body
[50:32] to manifest your glory in this day and
[50:34] i'm asking you to do your work in me
[50:36] today
[50:38] see the devil tries he's trying to make
[50:41] us afraid because when we're afraid
[50:42] amen we begin to get nervous and we turn
[50:45] our eyes from the promise and we begin
[50:46] to doubt we begin to question
[50:48] amen and that's not how god fulfills his
[50:50] word he fulfills his word
[50:51] by giving us a faith to believe his word
[50:53] because the word of god operates by
[50:55] faith
[50:57] so the devil is trying distractions and
[50:59] fear tactics and anxiety
[51:01] and i say turn back to the one who knew
[51:04] before the foundation of the world
[51:06] and said god you knew i would be here
[51:08] you knew i would have a need
[51:09] you provided a lamb slain from before
[51:11] the foundation of the world to meet this
[51:13] need
[51:13] and i'm trusting in you to meet the need
[51:16] and then forget about it
[51:21] that's what brother bam says go on
[51:24] confess your healing and act like you're
[51:26] healed
[51:33] see then on easter morning
[51:39] he knew your body was laying right here
[51:41] then on the earth
[51:43] when god first brought the earth into
[51:45] existence we are part of the earth
[51:47] we were laying there and by his
[51:49] foreknowledge he knew exactly who would
[51:51] love him
[51:52] and who would serve him and who would
[51:54] not
[51:55] his foreknowledge tells that if it
[51:57] doesn't then he isn't god
[51:58] he can't be god without being infinite
[52:00] and if he's infinite he knows all things
[52:05] in the greatest battle ever fought he
[52:06] says this great first battle that was
[52:08] ever fought begin in heaven
[52:11] when michael and his angels fought
[52:13] against lucifer and his angels
[52:15] it first started the first battle was in
[52:17] heaven so sin did not originate on earth
[52:19] it originated in heaven that's important
[52:23] don't forget that sin started in heaven
[52:25] sin did not originate on earth sin
[52:26] originated in heaven
[52:28] and sin is unbelief
[52:32] and when it was thrown down from heaven
[52:34] cast out of heaven to the earth
[52:35] and fell on human beings then the battle
[52:38] from
[52:39] angels became human battles and satan
[52:41] come to destroy god's creation what god
[52:43] had created to be for himself
[52:46] he had satan come to destroy this that's
[52:48] what this purpose was was to destroy him
[52:50] then the battle began on earth and begin
[52:52] in us and has been raging
[52:55] ever since so we know that the
[52:58] sin started in heaven and the first
[53:00] battle was in heaven and
[53:01] and satan lucifer and his angels were
[53:04] cast out of heaven
[53:05] and we know at some point he was on the
[53:07] earth in the formation of the earth
[53:09] it was his possession but we know
[53:11] between genesis 1 1 and genesis 1 2
[53:14] something happened amen brother i said
[53:17] there were seeds already laying here
[53:18] from something that happened before
[53:20] before we get to genesis 1 2. so there
[53:23] was something there
[53:24] and the seeds that were coming forth was
[53:26] a reflection of what was on the other
[53:27] side
[53:30] and and god now is making this for
[53:33] himself brother venom says
[53:35] and when god makes it we know it was
[53:37] satan's possession before
[53:39] but now when god makes it he makes the
[53:41] earth and he makes the garden of
[53:43] he makes eden and in the eden he makes a
[53:45] garden and then he sets his son there
[53:47] then he hands the son the title book the
[53:50] title deed to creation
[53:54] what do you think satan thought of that
[53:58] the the earth was his possession at one
[54:01] point according to the prophet of god
[54:03] and now this there's been a judgment and
[54:05] a re-creation and then the recreation
[54:07] now there's a son of god upon the earth
[54:09] and god takes the title deed to all this
[54:12] earth and creation
[54:13] and he hands it to his son no wonder
[54:16] satan begins to attack right there
[54:18] because what does he want he wants
[54:19] rights back to the earth amen
[54:23] and so now adam is holding the title
[54:26] deed
[54:26] to all creation and satan wants it
[54:29] back but he can't get that title deed we
[54:34] know when adam lost the title deed he
[54:35] went to the hands of the one who
[54:37] originated it went back to god's hand
[54:39] but god never wanted this title in
[54:41] heaven he wanted it to be on earth amen
[54:44] god gave it to man on earth he wanted
[54:46] his children and the former man to have
[54:48] it on earth
[54:48] god didn't want it he didn't need a
[54:50] title deed he didn't make himself a
[54:51] title deed he made it for his son
[54:54] and when he lost it amen he couldn't let
[54:56] it get into the hands of satan so it
[54:57] goes back into the original owner's
[54:59] hand which is god himself but god didn't
[55:02] make this title deed for himself
[55:04] he made it for his children amen for his
[55:06] attributes for his family
[55:08] and that's why that title deed in this
[55:10] day had to be restored
[55:11] back into the hands of sons and god sons
[55:13] and daughters of god
[55:14] and do you what do you think the devil
[55:16] thinks about that
[55:19] do you think he's just going to let you
[55:20] go on confessing that and that you're a
[55:22] joint heir with jesus christ and he's
[55:24] going to be completely
[55:25] dispossessed of everything that he
[55:27] claims to have rights to now
[55:28] do you think he's just going to roll
[55:30] over and let that happen amen when god
[55:32] put it in the hands of man what did he
[55:34] attack he attacked man he attacked the
[55:36] seed to stop the race of man from coming
[55:38] forth amen to stop
[55:40] to stop man from fulfilling this purpose
[55:45] and now amen the title deeds been back
[55:48] taken back in the hands of jesus christ
[55:51] amen and he's and he's handed it down to
[55:53] you and i amen he's wanting us to be
[55:55] joint heirs with him
[55:58] to dispossess satan of everything that
[56:01] he's laying claims to
[56:04] and you wonder why you have troubles
[56:07] we get surprised when we have
[56:09] difficulties
[56:11] when we have tormenting thoughts in our
[56:13] mind when we have debilitating issues
[56:15] and and
[56:16] circumstances that come against us and
[56:18] and we just think that
[56:19] somehow we've got bad luck and i'm
[56:21] somehow always stumbling and always well
[56:23] you have you have to go back and
[56:25] understand what is going on in the big
[56:27] picture amen
[56:28] we got to get out of our little
[56:29] microcosm here and fly up with eagles
[56:32] wings and say what is really going on
[56:34] all around me
[56:35] amen there's a warfare going on because
[56:37] what started in the battle started in
[56:38] heaven
[56:39] now come down to human beings and that
[56:41] battle is going on and you and i
[56:49] praise god
[56:53] he says we're still in the greatest
[56:56] battle ever fought
[57:00] and when it was thrown down from heaven
[57:02] cast out of him to earth and fell on
[57:03] human beings and the battle from angels
[57:05] became human battles
[57:07] and satan come to destroy god's creation
[57:09] which god created for himself
[57:10] he he had satan come to destroy this
[57:13] that's what his purpose was was to
[57:15] destroy it
[57:16] then the battle began here on earth and
[57:18] begin
[57:19] in us and has been raging ever since
[57:25] don't think in any strange thing
[57:28] concerning the fiery trials that are to
[57:30] try you as though some strange thing has
[57:32] happened
[57:33] unto you well who said that peter
[57:37] it's not unusual to see that the warfare
[57:40] is still going on
[57:43] in the fourth seal prophet says look
[57:46] what
[57:47] this is all coming to what is it it's
[57:49] going right back to the way it did it
[57:51] started in heaven
[57:52] it's coming to the end time battle
[57:55] there there's a a battle a war that
[57:57] started in heaven
[57:59] but there will be an end to this war
[58:02] lucifer had a beginning but he will have
[58:04] an annihilation he will have an end
[58:08] you and i and the thoughts of god had no
[58:10] beginnings so we will have no end
[58:13] why do you think he fights you so much
[58:15] because you and your humility and your
[58:17] weakness
[58:18] and your vessel of clay and all of that
[58:20] stuff you have a greater inheritance a
[58:22] greater position
[58:23] a man a greater promise a greater power
[58:26] than anything that he possesses why does
[58:28] he fight you so hard
[58:29] because he can't ever be what you are
[58:33] but he's trying to stop you from coming
[58:35] into your full inheritance amen
[58:37] he wants to stay a squad squatter with
[58:40] squatter rights upon the earth
[58:45] it started in heaven it's coming to the
[58:47] end time battle the first thing in
[58:49] heaven was a battle
[58:50] lucifer was kicked out and came to the
[58:52] earth then he polluted eden
[58:54] then he's been polluting ever since and
[58:56] now from the battle in heaven it's
[58:57] coming to the battle on earth
[58:59] and it is to be finished on earth at the
[59:01] time in a battle called armageddon now
[59:04] anyone knows that the battle started in
[59:05] heaven
[59:06] and so they kicked them out michael and
[59:08] his angels overthrowed them just run out
[59:11] and when they did it dropped right down
[59:13] into eden and here
[59:14] started the battle down here
[59:18] so the battle is continuing on friends
[59:23] started in heaven dropped to the earth
[59:26] and we know that that this this is a
[59:29] spiritual battle that's going on
[59:31] and it takes on physical manifestations
[59:33] but it's a spiritual battle
[59:36] and it's going on all around us
[59:41] brother baby says in the message the
[59:42] invisible union of the bride of christ
[59:44] he says when you see the woman a
[59:46] byproduct not another female like her
[59:49] made in that order knowing that she
[59:50] would be deceived god
[59:52] knowed if he didn't know the end from
[59:54] the beginning then he wasn't god
[59:57] if he isn't infinite and he can't be
[1:00:00] infinite without being omniscient
[1:00:01] omnipresent knowing all things eternal
[1:00:03] so he knowed all things
[1:00:05] and he had to make that woman that man
[1:00:08] didn't have a wife
[1:00:09] the wife and the man was the same thing
[1:00:11] he had the feminist and masculine spirit
[1:00:12] in himself
[1:00:14] he had to separate take a byproduct
[1:00:16] after the whole creation made no female
[1:00:18] created by god and the original creation
[1:00:19] can do a thing like that
[1:00:21] she was made thus to do it he knowed she
[1:00:23] would do it
[1:00:24] if he didn't he wasn't gone but see the
[1:00:28] attributes that's in god had to be
[1:00:29] displayed he was to be savior
[1:00:31] and to make everything perfect the way
[1:00:33] he had it then there couldn't
[1:00:34] could be nothing lost oh don't be
[1:00:36] children be men and women were at the
[1:00:38] end of the road
[1:00:43] god when he was recreating to earth and
[1:00:46] he was fashioning it for his pleasure
[1:00:48] because eden means pleasure he
[1:00:52] put everything the way he wanted it and
[1:00:53] he got his son and his son's wife there
[1:00:55] and
[1:00:56] he had everything just right and he was
[1:00:57] a holder of the title deed
[1:01:01] and and god when he was refashioning the
[1:01:04] earth when
[1:01:05] he was speaking amen to the to the light
[1:01:08] to appear
[1:01:09] into the clouds departing the waters to
[1:01:11] separate and when he was doing all this
[1:01:13] he knew there would be a fall
[1:01:16] when he put a tree of knowledge of good
[1:01:18] and evil in a tree of life
[1:01:19] he knew there would be a wrong choice he
[1:01:21] knew there would be a fall
[1:01:23] amen and we have to understand god knew
[1:01:26] from before the foundation of the world
[1:01:28] he knew there would be a fall
[1:01:29] so the fall must somehow work to his
[1:01:32] plan
[1:01:33] to manifest himself amen to have an
[1:01:35] ultimate victory over his enemy
[1:01:37] and to be displayed as god
[1:01:40] so these things have to be this way
[1:01:43] when he created lucifer he knew that
[1:01:46] lucifer would turn he knew
[1:01:48] what would happen he knew that there
[1:01:50] would be a great fall
[1:01:52] and then a fall and then a fall and then
[1:01:54] a fall
[1:01:56] and a fall and a fall
[1:01:59] because the jewish church fell the first
[1:02:01] church fell amen
[1:02:02] falling falling falling
[1:02:08] god had a plan
[1:02:11] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:02:12] revealed he says so my opinion the first
[1:02:15] thing that he made was angels
[1:02:17] then they worshiped him and that made
[1:02:19] him gone and he started from there as in
[1:02:21] previous messages i have tried to
[1:02:23] explain it break it down
[1:02:24] and now then when angels began to
[1:02:26] worship him that was before there was
[1:02:28] even a molecule in the earth
[1:02:29] there was nothing it was all darkness
[1:02:31] there wasn't no sun
[1:02:32] no moon no stars no nothing and then he
[1:02:35] was gone
[1:02:36] as he asked job where were you when i
[1:02:38] laid the foundation of the world see
[1:02:39] when the morning stars sang together the
[1:02:41] sons of god shouted for joy
[1:02:43] see where were you that was way back
[1:02:45] before the earth
[1:02:48] before god had even created the earth
[1:02:50] and brother baby says the earth could be
[1:02:52] millions and billions
[1:02:53] trillions of years old he doesn't know
[1:02:56] but way back before that
[1:02:58] he's asking where was you when i laid
[1:03:00] the foundation of the world when i the
[1:03:02] morning stars sang together the suns
[1:03:04] shouted for joy where were you that was
[1:03:06] way back before the earth now god had a
[1:03:08] purpose
[1:03:09] and a hidden mystery and that's what i
[1:03:12] want to speak on the church this morning
[1:03:14] the hidden mystery of god what's he
[1:03:16] preaching christ is the mystery of god
[1:03:17] revealed
[1:03:18] he said way back before the earth was
[1:03:20] even created when he was giving this
[1:03:22] revelation amen to the attributes to the
[1:03:24] sons
[1:03:26] he said back then he had a purpose and a
[1:03:29] hidden mystery
[1:03:32] he had a purpose and a hidden mystery he
[1:03:35] had his mind before the world ever began
[1:03:37] and how it's unfolded itself right down
[1:03:40] to this present hour that we're living
[1:03:42] then you will understand clearly then
[1:03:44] you will see on i believe
[1:03:46] what is being done brother branham
[1:03:49] wanted you to go all the way back and
[1:03:51] see what was in the back parts of god's
[1:03:52] mind this hidden mystery
[1:03:54] this great purpose he purposed in his
[1:03:56] mind to achieve so that you will
[1:03:57] understand what's going on
[1:04:00] and that part of that understanding is
[1:04:02] to bring us an understanding in this day
[1:04:04] not just to understand what happened but
[1:04:06] to understand why it happened and what's
[1:04:07] happening today
[1:04:11] let's turn to revelation 13.
[1:04:27] revelation 13 8
[1:04:36] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:04:37] worship him whose names are written
[1:04:40] in the book of life of the lamb slain
[1:04:42] from the foundation
[1:04:44] of the world this lamb
[1:04:47] was slain before the foundation of the
[1:04:50] world
[1:04:52] so god knew there would be a fall before
[1:04:55] he formed the world
[1:04:57] is that true why else would he have
[1:05:00] his own son as a lamb slain from before
[1:05:02] the foundation of the world
[1:05:04] and names in a book amen of the lamb
[1:05:06] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:05:08] there wasn't even a world yet here to
[1:05:11] fall
[1:05:12] he already was planning redemption
[1:05:14] before there was an
[1:05:15] earth before there was a creation amen
[1:05:19] before there was brother said before
[1:05:20] there was an atom or a molecule
[1:05:24] god already had this plan in his mind
[1:05:26] and he already had the lame slammed from
[1:05:28] slain from before the foundation of the
[1:05:30] world
[1:05:30] amen so god knew that there would be a
[1:05:32] fall he knew the earth would fall into
[1:05:34] this condition
[1:05:35] he knew there would be a satan's eden
[1:05:37] and he knew there would be a little
[1:05:38] bride that would come forth in satan's
[1:05:39] eden
[1:05:40] nothing is beyond god's knowledge and
[1:05:42] without his foreknowledge
[1:05:46] and so god knew let's go to isaiah 46.
[1:05:52] we know many of these things but i just
[1:05:53] want to lay them in very very good
[1:05:56] isaiah 46
[1:06:03] remember you have to drive a nail to
[1:06:05] make it clean so let's just keep driving
[1:06:06] nails
[1:06:07] because i want this revelation to clench
[1:06:10] i want to stop acting like a scared
[1:06:13] child every time something bad happens
[1:06:15] to me
[1:06:16] i want to stop ringing my hands i want
[1:06:18] to stop
[1:06:19] uh uh crying i want to stop this anxiety
[1:06:23] i want to stop
[1:06:23] all of these things that happen to me
[1:06:25] when troubles come i want to stop
[1:06:27] acting like a child and i want to act
[1:06:28] like a full-grown bride one who's got a
[1:06:30] husband who's taking care of her
[1:06:32] and i don't have to worry i don't have
[1:06:34] to fret i don't have to stress
[1:06:36] i'm tired of acting like a child this is
[1:06:39] not the age for childness childlike and
[1:06:41] behaviors
[1:06:42] and this is the age for us to be adults
[1:06:44] sons and daughters of god that's come to
[1:06:46] maturity
[1:06:48] in isaiah 46 9 it says whoa
[1:06:53] i'm sorry 46 9. remember the former
[1:06:56] things remember the former things of old
[1:06:58] for i am god and there is none else i am
[1:07:00] god and there is none like me
[1:07:02] declaring the end from the beginning and
[1:07:04] from ancient times the things that are
[1:07:06] not yet done
[1:07:07] saying my counsel shall stand and i will
[1:07:09] do all my pleasure
[1:07:11] what will stop that nothing
[1:07:17] and the fourth seal he says god has
[1:07:20] children
[1:07:21] god had his children all fortified up
[1:07:23] with his word and eve stuck her neck out
[1:07:26] i believe you're right maybe in there it
[1:07:28] went and it's been ever since
[1:07:29] then god come down listen and then god
[1:07:32] come down
[1:07:33] now he's got to he come down to redeem
[1:07:36] those that would come down
[1:07:40] and he planned it before the foundation
[1:07:42] of the world before there was a
[1:07:43] molecule star dust adam before there was
[1:07:46] anything in a physical creation
[1:07:48] god had a lamb slain before the
[1:07:49] foundation of the world he had a plan
[1:07:51] where he would come down to redeem them
[1:07:53] that would come down
[1:07:54] amen he didn't make the plan after he
[1:07:56] started creation and after there was a
[1:07:58] fall
[1:07:59] he planned to come down and redeem us
[1:08:01] before there was a fall
[1:08:04] because he knew that we would come down
[1:08:05] wherever he come down from you've come
[1:08:07] down from
[1:08:12] oh god is trying to break our spiritual
[1:08:15] amnesia
[1:08:16] so that we can remember where we've come
[1:08:18] from and who we are
[1:08:19] amen it's just it's still foggy yet but
[1:08:22] it's
[1:08:22] moving and we're moving into those
[1:08:24] realms to understand amen that i'm not
[1:08:27] always i wasn't i wasn't the son of
[1:08:29] charles and elle abraham amen
[1:08:31] amen i was always a son of god i was
[1:08:33] always predestinated
[1:08:34] i was in god's mind i had fellowship
[1:08:36] with the attributes before the
[1:08:38] foundation of the world
[1:08:39] he showed me his plan of redemption and
[1:08:40] i shouted for joy
[1:08:43] i wasn't in this form with this mind and
[1:08:45] this understanding i wasn't like this i
[1:08:47] don't know what i was like but whatever
[1:08:49] i was like it was god amen
[1:08:51] it was part of god and destined to be an
[1:08:53] offspring of god
[1:08:56] and that has come down
[1:09:00] but before it came down he already had a
[1:09:03] plan that he would come down and redeem
[1:09:04] all them that would come down
[1:09:07] because redemption was part of his plan
[1:09:10] if redemption was part of his plan
[1:09:12] and there was a land slam from before
[1:09:13] the foundation of the world
[1:09:15] then god needed to express redemption so
[1:09:18] he needed to respect
[1:09:19] the redemption he needed to have a fall
[1:09:23] if he was going to have a fall he had to
[1:09:26] have an adversary
[1:09:28] if he was going to have an adversary he
[1:09:30] was going to have to create a being
[1:09:31] and that being was going to be so
[1:09:33] perfect and amen he was going to allow
[1:09:34] that being the preeminence to make its
[1:09:36] own choice
[1:09:38] but because he needed an adversary he
[1:09:40] would pack
[1:09:41] every wonderful thing that he could pack
[1:09:44] into this being
[1:09:45] so it would be the greatest of all
[1:09:46] creations
[1:09:50] so that it would make the wrong choice
[1:09:53] by self-will
[1:09:54] and fall and cause a fall in heaven
[1:09:58] was that devastating it was devastating
[1:10:02] but was it outside god's plan it was not
[1:10:04] outside
[1:10:05] god's plan whatever happened in heaven
[1:10:08] was horrible
[1:10:10] because whatever happened on earth was
[1:10:12] horrible
[1:10:13] we're still suffering the consequences
[1:10:16] of what took place in eden
[1:10:19] and i would say heaven is still
[1:10:20] suffering the consequences of what took
[1:10:22] place in heaven
[1:10:27] see this isn't the age for children this
[1:10:29] is to be children this isn't the age
[1:10:30] where we say
[1:10:31] you know once you go beyond this realm
[1:10:34] into the heavenly realm
[1:10:35] everybody's floating on clouds and
[1:10:36] playing harps and all having wings
[1:10:38] it's not like that there's war up there
[1:10:40] there's opposing armies
[1:10:42] there's fighting going on all the time
[1:10:44] we talked about this a few weeks ago but
[1:10:46] when daniel set himself to pray
[1:10:48] he began to pray and as he was praying
[1:10:51] from the
[1:10:51] the gabriel was dispatched to take him a
[1:10:53] message but because there was a strife
[1:10:56] and there was
[1:10:56] there was hierarchies and there was
[1:10:58] powers
[1:11:00] there was authorities and there was and
[1:11:02] there was a uh
[1:11:04] realms of authority amen gabriel was
[1:11:07] sent
[1:11:07] from the first time daniel prayed and
[1:11:09] when daniel prayed and gabriel began to
[1:11:11] move
[1:11:12] but for 21 days he could not get to
[1:11:14] daniel
[1:11:15] amen this is a mighty messenger angel
[1:11:18] from god
[1:11:19] could not get to daniel because the
[1:11:21] prince of persia
[1:11:22] amen the power that was over persia a
[1:11:24] demonic power was withstanding him so he
[1:11:27] had to go back and get michael
[1:11:28] and michael helped him get through
[1:11:32] tell me there's not a problem in the
[1:11:33] heavenlies there's a problem in the
[1:11:38] heavenlies
[1:11:42] so i want to go to heaven but i don't
[1:11:44] want to go to that part of heaven
[1:11:47] i want to go to another part of heaven
[1:11:53] something happened and it was terrible
[1:11:55] and the effects of that first
[1:11:57] fall were still feeling today
[1:12:01] just like in the natural the effects of
[1:12:03] the first fall
[1:12:05] on earth and eden we're still feeling
[1:12:06] the effects of that today
[1:12:11] see this message took us back
[1:12:14] beyond just the natural
[1:12:20] he came down to redeem those that would
[1:12:23] come down
[1:12:24] i just like saying that that does
[1:12:25] something to me
[1:12:30] as i said god's like a big contractor he
[1:12:32] lays out all his material on the earth
[1:12:33] and then he builds his building
[1:12:35] now remember before there was a grain of
[1:12:37] seed on the earth before there was a sun
[1:12:39] that was ever struck the earth your body
[1:12:41] was laying on the earth
[1:12:42] because you are the dust of the earth so
[1:12:44] you are god's the contractor
[1:12:50] praise god let's turn to john chapter
[1:12:53] one
[1:13:01] i still have a lot of ground i'd like to
[1:13:04] cover by the grace of god
[1:13:06] so don't get tired yet
[1:13:10] there's something burning in my heart i
[1:13:12] just want to share
[1:13:15] saint john 1 11.
[1:13:19] he come to his own and his own received
[1:13:22] him not but as many as received him to
[1:13:24] them gave he power
[1:13:25] to become the sons of god that word
[1:13:28] become is translated almost
[1:13:30] everywhere else in the bible is be he
[1:13:33] gave them power to be
[1:13:34] the sons of god he gave us power to move
[1:13:37] into adoption he gave his power to be
[1:13:38] the sons of god
[1:13:40] even to them that believe on his name
[1:13:42] which were born
[1:13:43] not of blood nor of the will of the
[1:13:44] flesh nor of the will of man
[1:13:46] but of god amen your
[1:13:50] your new birth on this earth was the
[1:13:52] will of god amen
[1:13:53] it wasn't your choice it wasn't that you
[1:13:55] someday decided god but it was by the
[1:13:57] will of god he knew you would come forth
[1:13:59] and he wanted you to come forth
[1:14:02] in luke 19 jesus says the son of man has
[1:14:05] come to seek and to save
[1:14:06] that which was lost he didn't come to
[1:14:10] seek
[1:14:11] and to find something he wanted he come
[1:14:13] to seek and to save that which was lost
[1:14:16] he was looking for that which came down
[1:14:20] which would come down he was in here
[1:14:22] looking for that
[1:14:23] he was seeking out his own he said they
[1:14:26] told the father he said thine they were
[1:14:29] and thou has given them to me they
[1:14:32] already belonged to the father
[1:14:34] and the father gave them to the son and
[1:14:36] the son was here looking for the ones
[1:14:38] that had gotten lost but they were the
[1:14:39] fathers originally
[1:14:40] amen because you can't lose something
[1:14:42] that's not yours originally
[1:14:46] so now i want to i want to move in and
[1:14:50] look at the work of reconciliation if we
[1:14:51] could go to colossians chapter 1.
[1:14:57] colossians chapter one
[1:15:11] verse 15. now this is the
[1:15:15] portion of scripture brother brennan
[1:15:17] begins reading when he preaches crisis
[1:15:19] the mystery of god revealed
[1:15:20] and he starts here in colossians chapter
[1:15:22] one and there's a quote that i'm going
[1:15:24] to quote out of this
[1:15:26] in just a moment he says verse 15 who is
[1:15:30] the image of the invisible god the
[1:15:32] firstborn of every creature
[1:15:34] for by him were all things created there
[1:15:36] in heaven
[1:15:37] and that are in earth visible invisible
[1:15:40] whether it be thrones or dominions or
[1:15:43] principalities
[1:15:44] our powers all things were created by
[1:15:46] him
[1:15:47] and for him so look
[1:15:50] we've got both things that are in heaven
[1:15:53] and earth
[1:15:53] visible and invisible thrones
[1:15:57] dominions principalities powers
[1:16:01] both visible and invisible
[1:16:05] there are thrones and powers and and all
[1:16:08] of this stuff
[1:16:09] in the heavenly realm just as there is
[1:16:11] on the earth
[1:16:13] it was all created by him and for him
[1:16:16] and he is before all things and by him
[1:16:19] all things consist
[1:16:20] and he is the head of the body the
[1:16:22] church who is the beginning the
[1:16:24] firstborn from the dead
[1:16:25] that in all things he might have the
[1:16:27] preeminence
[1:16:28] for it please the father that in him
[1:16:30] should all fullness dwell
[1:16:33] and having made peace through the blood
[1:16:35] of his cross
[1:16:36] by him to reconcile all things unto
[1:16:39] himself
[1:16:40] by him i say whether they be things in
[1:16:42] earth
[1:16:43] or things in heaven
[1:16:46] now let's look at this statement this is
[1:16:48] where brother branham's going to inject
[1:16:50] a statement he's reading this scripture
[1:16:51] and he's going to just inject a
[1:16:53] statement at the end of this
[1:16:54] and i'll read it again so you catch him
[1:16:57] and having made peace through the blood
[1:16:59] of his cross
[1:17:00] by him to reconcile all things unto
[1:17:03] himself
[1:17:04] by him i say whether they be things in
[1:17:06] earth
[1:17:07] are things in heaven so there has to be
[1:17:10] a reconciliation of
[1:17:11] all things whether they be on earth or
[1:17:14] whether they be in heaven and when
[1:17:16] brother branham comes to this place
[1:17:18] he says watch where that reconciliation
[1:17:21] went what a statement
[1:17:25] we look at the we look at jesus christ
[1:17:27] coming to earth
[1:17:29] and dying amen on a cross to be the lamb
[1:17:31] of god
[1:17:32] amen the propitiation for our sins and
[1:17:34] he pays that price
[1:17:36] and we in our minds think that that only
[1:17:38] has to do with the fall in eden
[1:17:40] but this scripture here is telling us
[1:17:42] that it's more than just a fall in eden
[1:17:44] because heaven needs to be reconciled as
[1:17:46] well
[1:17:47] and he reconciled all things in the body
[1:17:50] of his flesh
[1:17:51] amen when he died on calvary whether
[1:17:53] they be things on earth or whether they
[1:17:55] see things in heaven
[1:17:56] so it shows that this work of
[1:17:58] reconciliation amen
[1:17:59] it has to do with earth but it also has
[1:18:02] to do with heaven
[1:18:03] so when god came down in flesh in the
[1:18:05] life of jesus christ and he shed his own
[1:18:07] blood
[1:18:08] amen he wasn't just fixing earth but he
[1:18:11] was also
[1:18:12] reconciling heaven in the body of his
[1:18:15] flesh
[1:18:16] god had a plan there was a great fall
[1:18:18] things have been disrupted in the
[1:18:20] heavens although lucifer was cast out
[1:18:22] he was cast out and his angels was cast
[1:18:24] out but we find him in revelations 12
[1:18:26] he's the accuser of the brethren and you
[1:18:28] go all the way back to job which brother
[1:18:30] branham said job is the oldest book
[1:18:31] written in the bible
[1:18:34] and in job you see a day when the sons
[1:18:36] of god present themselves in the god
[1:18:38] and satan comes among them amen and and
[1:18:41] and god asked him what he's doing what
[1:18:43] have you been doing he said i've been
[1:18:44] walking to and fro all over the earth he
[1:18:46] said have you considered my servant job
[1:18:48] there is none like him in all the earth
[1:18:51] and satan says does job serve thee for
[1:18:55] naught
[1:18:58] don't does thou not have a hedge about
[1:19:00] him what's satan doing
[1:19:02] he's accusing job he's saying
[1:19:05] job only loves you because you bless him
[1:19:09] stop blessing him and he won't love you
[1:19:11] he'll curse you to your face
[1:19:14] what is satan doing now he is in heaven
[1:19:17] as the accuser of the brethren because
[1:19:19] he was cast out of heaven there was a
[1:19:21] fall
[1:19:22] and he began to accuse the brethren now
[1:19:24] he can present himself in the heavenly
[1:19:26] realm when god when the sons of god
[1:19:27] present themselves
[1:19:29] i don't know how it works don't come and
[1:19:30] say brother chad how does it work all i
[1:19:32] know is what the bible says
[1:19:34] he was cast out but he's still doing
[1:19:36] something in heaven he what's he doing
[1:19:38] he's accusing the brethren like he was
[1:19:41] accusing job
[1:19:43] so there's still a problem in heaven
[1:19:46] amen there's
[1:19:47] spirits and there's principalities and
[1:19:49] there's powers that will withstand
[1:19:50] gabriel that will hold him back from
[1:19:52] getting a message to one of god's
[1:19:54] children
[1:19:55] there's still things that aren't right
[1:19:57] so god came down in the tabernacle of
[1:20:00] flesh
[1:20:00] amen and this is not time to be children
[1:20:02] but full-grown believers amen
[1:20:04] what god was doing he had a plan and all
[1:20:07] along in his plan
[1:20:08] was a lame lamb slain before the
[1:20:11] foundation in the world
[1:20:12] and in that body of flesh he was
[1:20:14] reconciling
[1:20:15] all things all things all things
[1:20:18] all things and by him were all things
[1:20:21] made
[1:20:23] everything that was made god is now
[1:20:25] reconciling in the body of his flesh
[1:20:30] so this reconciliation has to do with
[1:20:32] earth
[1:20:34] and heaven
[1:20:38] the word reconciliation here means
[1:20:42] when it says by him to reconcile all
[1:20:45] things
[1:20:46] unto himself by him i say whether they
[1:20:48] be things in earth
[1:20:49] or things in heaven this word reconcile
[1:20:52] means to reconcile completely
[1:20:54] to reconcile back again to bring back
[1:20:57] a former state of harmony
[1:21:01] what is god trying to do through his
[1:21:03] plan of redemption he's trying to bring
[1:21:05] everything back into a state of original
[1:21:07] harmony
[1:21:09] what is this plan of redemption that
[1:21:10] we're caught up in what is this plan of
[1:21:12] redemption that's going on all around
[1:21:14] us amen it's god trying to reconcile all
[1:21:17] things back to himself again
[1:21:19] and reconcile both things in heaven and
[1:21:20] in earth and you're caught right up in
[1:21:22] the middle of it because that battle
[1:21:24] moved from heaven come down to human
[1:21:25] beings and is going on right in you and
[1:21:27] i now
[1:21:30] the battle for earth and the battle for
[1:21:32] heaven is going on and you and i
[1:21:40] let's turn to hebrews 9.
[1:21:49] hebrews chapter 9.
[1:22:04] 19 hebrews 9 19.
[1:22:08] for when moses had spoken every precept
[1:22:10] to all the people according to the law
[1:22:12] he took the blood of calves and of goats
[1:22:15] with water and scarlet wool and hyssop
[1:22:18] and sprinkled both the book
[1:22:19] and all the people saying this is the
[1:22:21] blood of the testament
[1:22:22] which god hath enjoined unto you
[1:22:25] moreover he sprinkled with blood both
[1:22:27] the tabernacle
[1:22:28] and all the vessels of the ministry and
[1:22:31] almost all
[1:22:32] things are by the law purged with blood
[1:22:34] and without shedding of blood is no
[1:22:36] remission
[1:22:38] it was therefore necessary that the
[1:22:40] pattern of things in heaven should be
[1:22:42] purified with these now stop reading
[1:22:46] he's saying that when moses built the
[1:22:49] tabernacle in the vessels it was a
[1:22:50] pattern of the things that were in
[1:22:52] heaven
[1:22:52] god lifted him up in the mountain and
[1:22:54] showed him the tabernacle and he told
[1:22:57] him to make a replica on earth
[1:22:58] and so the pattern on earth had to be
[1:23:01] purified with the blood of bulls and
[1:23:03] goats amen
[1:23:04] so there was a purification by blood
[1:23:06] that would purify the vessel the
[1:23:08] tabernacle and all the instruments
[1:23:11] and so god was god was laying down a
[1:23:14] pattern
[1:23:15] amen from heaven upon the earth but the
[1:23:18] pattern before it could be
[1:23:20] used it had to be purified and it was
[1:23:22] purified by blood
[1:23:24] now let's read the scripture again verse
[1:23:26] 23 it was
[1:23:27] therefore necessary that the pattern of
[1:23:30] things in the heavens
[1:23:31] should be purified with these but the
[1:23:34] heavenly things themselves
[1:23:36] with better sacrifice than these
[1:23:39] so if the pattern had to have a
[1:23:42] sacrifice and a sprinkling of blood for
[1:23:44] cleansing
[1:23:45] then the heavenly things the things that
[1:23:47] they were patterned after the tabernacle
[1:23:49] of heaven
[1:23:50] had to have a better sacrifice than
[1:23:52] these why
[1:23:53] for purification and you're saying
[1:23:56] you mean something in heaven has to be
[1:24:00] purified
[1:24:02] that's what the scripture is telling us
[1:24:04] these things that on earth had to be
[1:24:06] purified by these sacrifices but the
[1:24:07] things in heaven
[1:24:08] by better sacrifice than these
[1:24:12] for christ is not entered into the holy
[1:24:14] place made with hands which are the
[1:24:16] figure of true
[1:24:17] but in the heaven itself now to appear
[1:24:20] in the presence of god
[1:24:21] for us you see
[1:24:28] god laid a pattern on earth
[1:24:31] and he said make it according to this
[1:24:33] fashion so he he patterned what was in
[1:24:35] heaven he patted on earth
[1:24:36] and before he could use it it had to be
[1:24:38] purified it was purified by blood
[1:24:40] amen and so that was wonderful we
[1:24:42] understand that it's natural it has to
[1:24:44] be purified
[1:24:45] but the bible says it was purified by
[1:24:47] these sacrifices but the things the
[1:24:49] heavenly themselves
[1:24:51] with better sacrifice than these
[1:24:55] the scripture tells us that when he
[1:24:57] speaks to lucifer in ezekiel 28
[1:24:59] he says thou hast defiled thy
[1:25:01] sanctuaries
[1:25:03] where did sin take place where did it
[1:25:06] originate
[1:25:08] in heaven sin originated in heaven
[1:25:12] there was a corruption that came into
[1:25:14] the heavenlies
[1:25:15] there was a pollution that was entered
[1:25:17] into the heavenlies
[1:25:18] and now all things are being reconciled
[1:25:21] in the body of jesus christ
[1:25:22] both things that are in heaven and earth
[1:25:24] and things that are in heaven
[1:25:26] amen it's all got to come back to a
[1:25:28] reconciliation
[1:25:29] so god is using this plan of what's
[1:25:32] going on down here
[1:25:33] and through this plan he's fixing the
[1:25:35] whole program
[1:25:38] even the blood of jesus christ you think
[1:25:40] what i don't understand that
[1:25:42] i'll tell you i don't understand it
[1:25:44] either but i know this that jesus christ
[1:25:46] had to go beyond the holy of holies and
[1:25:48] he had to be the sacrifice that would
[1:25:49] purify the things that were the
[1:25:51] heavenlies
[1:25:52] because that's where sin broke out where
[1:25:54] was lucifer a covering cherub
[1:25:56] where's the covering chair brother brown
[1:25:58] said god's right hand man he was right
[1:26:00] there with god
[1:26:01] and right there with god he polluted his
[1:26:03] sanctuaries
[1:26:05] he defiled them so god was going to come
[1:26:09] and be the high priest and the high
[1:26:11] priest was going to reconcile back
[1:26:13] and he was going to bring a sacrifice
[1:26:14] that would purify
[1:26:17] not the vessels on earth but the
[1:26:20] heavenly themselves
[1:26:22] god is using this plan of redemption to
[1:26:25] reconcile the whole program
[1:26:29] and we are caught right in the middle of
[1:26:32] this plan of redemption
[1:26:35] everything that's going on in heaven and
[1:26:37] everything that's going on earth the
[1:26:39] warfare the reconciliation
[1:26:41] the purging everything has everything to
[1:26:43] do with you
[1:26:46] it's bigger than our problem it's bigger
[1:26:50] amen it's bigger than just all the
[1:26:52] little things that we see if we can just
[1:26:54] fly a little higher and say
[1:26:56] this plan of god is so much bigger amen
[1:26:58] if i could just escape my small thinking
[1:27:01] and i could just back up and see that
[1:27:03] god through this plan of redemption is
[1:27:05] fixing everything
[1:27:06] i just want to be part of this plan of
[1:27:08] redemption i don't want to take my own
[1:27:10] mind my own thinking i don't want to get
[1:27:12] distracted
[1:27:12] i just want to stay tuned into this
[1:27:14] because god is reconciling god is fixing
[1:27:17] god is purging god is restoring back to
[1:27:19] its original harmony
[1:27:21] and he's doing it through this plan of
[1:27:22] redemption
[1:27:29] let's turn to ephesians chapter 6.
[1:27:37] verse 10.
[1:27:44] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:27:46] lord and the power of his might
[1:27:48] put on the whole armor of god that you
[1:27:50] may be able to stand against the wiles
[1:27:52] of the devil
[1:27:53] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:27:55] blood but against principalities
[1:27:57] against powers against the rulers of the
[1:28:00] darkness of this world
[1:28:01] against spiritual wickedness and high
[1:28:04] that word high means
[1:28:05] heavenly places
[1:28:10] you're here battling it out on earth but
[1:28:11] you're not fighting a carnal battle
[1:28:14] you're here on earth oppressed afflicted
[1:28:17] tormented
[1:28:18] with struggles but this is not a fleshly
[1:28:21] battle
[1:28:21] this is not a carnal battle we are not
[1:28:24] fighting against flesh and blood but we
[1:28:25] are fighting its principalities
[1:28:27] and powers in heavenly places this is
[1:28:31] still
[1:28:31] spiritual warfare going on in the
[1:28:33] heavenlies it has everything to do with
[1:28:35] you living your life every day
[1:28:39] like i said it's so much bigger than
[1:28:41] what we think we get going along and and
[1:28:43] we
[1:28:43] we we we just do the same routine day
[1:28:46] after day
[1:28:47] and we we just live and work and do the
[1:28:49] things that we do and we can easily get
[1:28:51] caught in that mode and miss what god is
[1:28:53] doing in this day
[1:28:54] because we're not warring after the
[1:28:55] things of earth we're not against the
[1:28:57] government
[1:28:58] we're not against taxes we're not
[1:28:59] against our neighbor we're not against
[1:29:01] the guy at work
[1:29:02] what are we fighting against we're
[1:29:03] warring against principalities and
[1:29:05] powers in heavenly places
[1:29:12] and that means there's still warfare
[1:29:13] going on in heavenly places
[1:29:16] and the battle dropped down from heaven
[1:29:18] and dropped into
[1:29:20] you and i and the battle's still raging
[1:29:23] let's go to second corinthians
[1:29:26] chapter five
[1:29:35] ii corinthians chapter five
[1:29:39] verse 16.
[1:29:44] verse 16 that wherefore henceforth now
[1:29:46] know we know man after the flesh yea
[1:29:48] though we have known christ after the
[1:29:50] flesh
[1:29:51] you now henceforth knowing him no more
[1:29:53] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[1:29:55] a new creature
[1:29:56] old things are passed away behold all
[1:29:58] things are become new
[1:30:00] and all things are of god who hath
[1:30:02] reconciled us to himself
[1:30:04] by jesus christ and has given to us
[1:30:07] the ministry of reconciliation
[1:30:10] so this ministry of reconciliation is
[1:30:12] still going on
[1:30:14] but where is it going on now who did he
[1:30:16] give the ministry of reconciliation to
[1:30:18] this is the apostle paul talking he's
[1:30:20] saying now he has given to us the
[1:30:22] ministry of reconciliation
[1:30:26] to wit that god was in christ
[1:30:27] reconciling the world unto himself
[1:30:29] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[1:30:31] and hath committed to us
[1:30:33] the word of reconciliation
[1:30:37] now then we we are ambassadors for
[1:30:40] christ as though god did beseech you by
[1:30:42] us
[1:30:43] we pray you and christ's dead be ye
[1:30:45] reconciled to god
[1:30:47] he said we are ambassadors for god and
[1:30:49] we are here we're praying to you
[1:30:51] in place of christ in christ said we're
[1:30:53] calling to you
[1:30:54] be ye reconciled to go to god
[1:30:58] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[1:31:00] who knew no sin
[1:31:01] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:31:03] of god
[1:31:04] in him there's a spiritual warfare go on
[1:31:08] there's a reconciliation of all things
[1:31:10] heaven and earth it was reconciled in
[1:31:11] the body of flesh of jesus christ
[1:31:13] and the work of reconciliation then was
[1:31:15] given to the apostle paul
[1:31:17] and what's he doing he's reconciling
[1:31:19] back amen
[1:31:20] heaven he's reconciling back to those
[1:31:22] that came down he's bringing them back
[1:31:24] in contact with god again
[1:31:26] and there's a warfare going on to stop
[1:31:29] them
[1:31:32] in the message the new ministry
[1:31:35] from 1959 he says now you say well if he
[1:31:39] knows it then why are you preaching
[1:31:42] that's part of god's program preaching
[1:31:44] is his program
[1:31:46] brother man's talking about god who
[1:31:48] knows all things he knew the beginning
[1:31:49] from the end
[1:31:50] and he says if he knows that then why
[1:31:52] are you preaching if god's going to save
[1:31:54] him anyways just let god save him
[1:31:56] and brother man i'm saying no you don't
[1:31:58] understand god's program
[1:32:00] god knew that there was a lamb slain
[1:32:03] before the foundation of the world he
[1:32:04] knew there would be a fall
[1:32:05] he knew he would reconcile all things in
[1:32:07] the body of his flesh
[1:32:08] he knew that there would be a high
[1:32:10] priest that could go amen to the holy of
[1:32:12] holies in heaven
[1:32:13] amen for purification he knew it
[1:32:16] he knew it before he began to work his
[1:32:18] plan
[1:32:19] but realize he got to know god's program
[1:32:22] you have to know how god works his plan
[1:32:26] he goes on to say when he looked upon
[1:32:29] the apostles he looked upon the harvest
[1:32:30] he said
[1:32:31] the harvest is ripe and the laborers are
[1:32:34] few
[1:32:34] pray the lord of the harvest that he
[1:32:36] will send laborers into his harvest
[1:32:38] how many remember that well why would
[1:32:40] they have to pray to the lord of the
[1:32:42] harvest to send laborers into the
[1:32:43] harvest
[1:32:44] if the lord of the harvest was standing
[1:32:46] there knowing it would be done
[1:32:47] why god has so arranged it that
[1:32:51] now listen to this god has so arranged
[1:32:53] it that his program
[1:32:54] cannot move without you and i and as
[1:32:57] long as we're not doing what god leads
[1:32:59] us to do we are paralyzing his program
[1:33:03] but when the church moves by the
[1:33:04] anointing of the holy ghost
[1:33:06] we're in god's will doing his program
[1:33:09] oh i say this is a good program you
[1:33:12] agree this is a good program
[1:33:14] that god had before the foundation of
[1:33:15] the world we're coming back the title
[1:33:17] deed of redemption has been brought back
[1:33:19] it's brought back to a people who would
[1:33:20] understand his word who had been lifted
[1:33:23] out of a laodicean condition
[1:33:24] be lifted out of cardinal into the
[1:33:26] supernatural so that they could have the
[1:33:28] understanding to live this life
[1:33:30] victorious
[1:33:31] by obeying the word and in doing so
[1:33:35] they are reconciling all things and in
[1:33:37] doing so they are bringing things back
[1:33:39] to the condition that they should have
[1:33:40] been in
[1:33:43] and that's why the devil fights you
[1:33:45] that's why he's against you
[1:33:47] that's why troubles come in waves they
[1:33:49] don't just come one at a time
[1:33:50] now they come three at a time what is it
[1:33:54] we're nearing the fullness of the
[1:33:55] redemption we're coming to the change in
[1:33:57] the body
[1:33:57] amen we're about to drive the final nail
[1:34:00] in his coffin for the gentile
[1:34:01] dispensation
[1:34:02] and the devil is fighting so hard for
[1:34:05] you to take your position to stay in
[1:34:07] platoon with the word
[1:34:08] to stay where god wants you to be a
[1:34:10] ministry of reconciliation he wants to
[1:34:12] stop you from doing that
[1:34:15] but it's too late god has peeled back
[1:34:17] the seals and he showed us his great
[1:34:19] plan
[1:34:20] and god has predestinated the people on
[1:34:22] this earth to catch the vision
[1:34:24] to catch the revelation and what god
[1:34:26] wanted and what god intended and they're
[1:34:28] here willing to lay down their lives for
[1:34:30] god to fulfill his purpose
[1:34:38] let's look at luke chapter 10.
[1:34:47] luke chapter 10.
[1:35:02] and in luke here jesus sends out his
[1:35:05] disciples two by two
[1:35:07] to preach that the kingdom has come
[1:35:11] that the kingdom is at hand so he sends
[1:35:13] them out two by two preaching the
[1:35:15] message of the hour
[1:35:17] that's what they're preaching they're
[1:35:19] preaching the word for their day they're
[1:35:20] preaching the message of the hour
[1:35:22] and they're told to pray for the sick
[1:35:24] and cast out devils and and do all those
[1:35:26] things
[1:35:27] so they're going out preaching from city
[1:35:29] to city
[1:35:30] they're preaching the message of the
[1:35:32] hour and the demonstrations are
[1:35:34] following
[1:35:37] and when they return they they speak to
[1:35:39] jesus in verse 17
[1:35:41] luke 10 17 and the 70 returned again
[1:35:44] with joy
[1:35:45] saying lord even the devils are subject
[1:35:47] unto us through thy name
[1:35:49] and he said unto them i beheld satan as
[1:35:52] lightning
[1:35:53] fall from heaven when they came back
[1:35:56] god had sent them out to preach the
[1:35:58] message of the hour
[1:35:59] and when they were preaching the message
[1:36:01] of the hour they had power over devils
[1:36:03] to cast them out
[1:36:04] to heal the sick and when they expressed
[1:36:06] that they had powers over devils
[1:36:08] jesus said behold i see satan as
[1:36:11] lightning
[1:36:13] falling from heaven
[1:36:16] he says now i want to go on and read a
[1:36:18] few more then we'll go to a quote here
[1:36:19] behold i give you
[1:36:21] power to tread on serpents and scorpions
[1:36:23] and over all the power of the enemy
[1:36:25] and nothing shall by any means hurt you
[1:36:27] notwithstanding in this rejoice not that
[1:36:29] the spirits are subject unto you but
[1:36:31] rather rejoice because your names
[1:36:33] are written in heaven brother branham
[1:36:36] says in the message thy house referring
[1:36:37] to this scripture
[1:36:39] it says by i beheld satan falling from
[1:36:41] heaven like lightning
[1:36:43] now i'll just kindly outline this and if
[1:36:45] it doesn't do it then
[1:36:46] you just let me know and i'll i'll go
[1:36:48] into detail
[1:36:49] do you remember we'll get the we'll get
[1:36:52] that when we
[1:36:53] come into it further on the scriptures
[1:36:55] on our study over here
[1:36:57] that was immediately after that jesus
[1:36:59] gave his disciples power against unclean
[1:37:01] spirits
[1:37:02] and they went out casting out devils he
[1:37:04] sent them two by two and said don't
[1:37:06] go to the gentiles but go rather to the
[1:37:07] lost sheep of israel
[1:37:09] and as you go preaching then the kingdom
[1:37:11] of heaven and heal the sick and cast out
[1:37:13] devils
[1:37:13] and so forth and then they come back
[1:37:16] rejoicing happily
[1:37:19] now come back happily rejoicing and he
[1:37:21] said rejoice not that your names
[1:37:23] rejoice not the devils is subject in you
[1:37:25] but rejoice because your names are
[1:37:26] written in heaven
[1:37:27] said i beheld satan falling from heaven
[1:37:30] like lightning
[1:37:31] see the power of that church moving
[1:37:33] forward
[1:37:34] had just upset the whole kingdom of
[1:37:36] satan
[1:37:37] the power of that church listen they
[1:37:39] weren't even born again yet amen
[1:37:41] christ hadn't even died yet but the
[1:37:43] power of that church
[1:37:44] moving forward in the program of god
[1:37:46] upset satan's kingdom
[1:37:48] oh my goodness what hour should we be
[1:37:51] living in
[1:37:52] what kind of kingdom upsetting should be
[1:37:54] going on right now
[1:37:56] you see and he saw him as it dropped
[1:37:58] from his places
[1:37:59] he saw him as he dropped from his places
[1:38:01] because god had
[1:38:02] again given power to his church he
[1:38:05] beheld him falling like lightning from
[1:38:07] heaven he was cast plum out of the holy
[1:38:09] place and everything you see
[1:38:10] by the power of the power of that church
[1:38:13] of them having power she said i give you
[1:38:16] power over unclean spirits
[1:38:17] see what they really upset the kingdom
[1:38:19] of satan what could we do with it today
[1:38:23] what is the goal today what's the
[1:38:25] purpose of having the word today
[1:38:26] it's the move forward in the power of
[1:38:28] god by the revelation of the word
[1:38:30] and by god's spirit amen anointing that
[1:38:32] word to upset the devil's kingdom
[1:38:34] because he's got to fall again amen
[1:38:36] because we know that when the church
[1:38:38] goes up when the bride goes up
[1:38:40] he comes down there's got to be another
[1:38:42] falling light lightning of satan coming
[1:38:44] down
[1:38:45] losing his position when will he lose
[1:38:47] his position when you and i get into
[1:38:49] ours when we go up
[1:38:50] he comes down there's got to be another
[1:38:53] church on this earth that is moving in
[1:38:54] the power of god
[1:38:55] by the revelation of the word with the
[1:38:57] spirit here to back it up
[1:39:00] and what is that doing upsetting his
[1:39:02] kingdom that's what he wants to stop you
[1:39:04] from
[1:39:10] brother remember says he's interested in
[1:39:12] you
[1:39:14] he's interested in me he's interested to
[1:39:17] see his word made manifest
[1:39:19] and he's depending on us to do it for we
[1:39:22] are his agents nothing in ourselves it's
[1:39:26] him
[1:39:27] yielding ourselves and walking with him
[1:39:30] we're his agents but it's not anything
[1:39:31] we can do but it's something we have to
[1:39:33] yield ourselves to
[1:39:34] we have to see the word and yield to the
[1:39:36] word we have to
[1:39:37] love not our lives unto death but we
[1:39:40] have to die to ourselves
[1:39:44] brother branham says in the in the
[1:39:45] seventh seal
[1:39:48] remember after the fourth chapter of
[1:39:50] revelation the church is gone
[1:39:52] the force horse four horse riders has
[1:39:54] went out church is gone
[1:39:56] everything that happened to the church
[1:39:57] happened to the fourth chapter of the
[1:39:59] book of revelations everything that
[1:40:01] happened in the antichrist move went up
[1:40:02] to the fourth
[1:40:03] chapter and the fourth seal of
[1:40:05] revelation both for antichrist and
[1:40:07] christ ended
[1:40:08] up an antichrist comes to his doom with
[1:40:10] his army and christ comes
[1:40:12] with his army it's an old battle that
[1:40:15] started
[1:40:16] way back beyond time i'm so glad we had
[1:40:20] a prophet
[1:40:23] to show us what's going on
[1:40:26] you know what he's telling us he's
[1:40:27] telling us what's going on every day in
[1:40:29] our lives he's trying to explain to us
[1:40:31] what the battle is all about and what
[1:40:33] the spiritual warfare all around us
[1:40:35] is it's an old battle that started way
[1:40:38] back beyond time
[1:40:40] satan and his angels were kicked out and
[1:40:43] when they come to earth the battle set
[1:40:45] in again because eve broke down the
[1:40:46] barrier from where she was isolated
[1:40:48] behind the word of god
[1:40:50] and from that very hour satan won the
[1:40:52] battle over god's word because one of
[1:40:54] his subjects the weaker let down the bar
[1:40:57] and that's exactly how he's won the
[1:41:00] battle every time
[1:41:01] has been because one of his subjects let
[1:41:03] down the bar
[1:41:05] from the word i say god help me
[1:41:08] not to let down the bar from your word
[1:41:12] god i need your help but i want to keep
[1:41:14] this word with all that's in me
[1:41:16] my greatest desire is to keep your word
[1:41:19] my greatest desire is to stay with the
[1:41:21] word that you've given us in this day
[1:41:23] not to compromise it
[1:41:24] not to change it not to explain it away
[1:41:26] but to stay submitted to it
[1:41:30] let's turn to second corinthians chapter
[1:41:32] 10.
[1:41:34] look at the scripture
[1:41:38] now remember that's how satan won the
[1:41:41] battle over god's word
[1:41:43] is when one of his subjects the weaker
[1:41:45] let down the bar
[1:41:47] and that's exactly how he's won the
[1:41:49] battle every time has been because one
[1:41:51] of his subjects
[1:41:52] let down the bar from the word
[1:41:55] that's what he's done in every
[1:41:56] denomination in every church age
[1:41:59] he's got them to let down the bar on the
[1:42:01] word he would send them the word and
[1:42:02] they would take the word
[1:42:03] and have a revival around that word but
[1:42:05] then they would begin to compromise
[1:42:06] on the word and let down the bar on the
[1:42:09] word
[1:42:11] and let's look at second corinthians
[1:42:12] chapter 10 now
[1:42:17] paul the apostle is writing in verse 3
[1:42:19] he says
[1:42:20] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[1:42:23] not war after the flesh
[1:42:25] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:42:27] carnival mighty through god to the
[1:42:29] pulling down of strongholds
[1:42:31] so this once again is another way paul's
[1:42:33] declaring to us we're not fighting an
[1:42:35] earthly battle
[1:42:36] this is a supernatural spiritual battle
[1:42:39] these are
[1:42:40] powers principalities in heavenly places
[1:42:43] that we're warring with
[1:42:45] and the weapons are our warfare are not
[1:42:46] carnal but mighty
[1:42:49] through god to the pulling down of
[1:42:51] strongholds these weapons we've been
[1:42:52] given will pull down the devil's
[1:42:54] strongholds
[1:42:57] casting down imaginations
[1:43:01] where is imaginations in the mind
[1:43:03] where's the greatest battle ever fought
[1:43:04] where's the new battleground
[1:43:05] in your mind casting down imaginations
[1:43:09] and
[1:43:10] every high thing that exalted itself
[1:43:12] against the knowledge of god
[1:43:14] and bringing into captivity every
[1:43:17] thought to the obedience
[1:43:18] of christ so now these weapons of our
[1:43:20] warfare are mighty bringing down
[1:43:22] strongholds
[1:43:23] amen and bringing every captive every
[1:43:26] thought
[1:43:26] amen pulling down every high thing that
[1:43:28] exalt itself against the knowledge of
[1:43:30] god
[1:43:30] and casting down imaginations this is
[1:43:33] the equipment that's been given to us
[1:43:34] the power of the revealing of the word
[1:43:37] to break amen the the power of the devil
[1:43:40] to mess up our minds to bring wrong
[1:43:43] thoughts and imaginations and
[1:43:45] and knowledge that exalts itself against
[1:43:46] the knowledge of god it is all to be
[1:43:48] defeated by the word of god
[1:43:51] and we've been given mighty weapons in
[1:43:53] this day because the word has been
[1:43:54] restored and it will bring down the
[1:43:56] strongholds of wrong thinking
[1:43:58] the strongholds of denominational
[1:43:59] thinking the strongholds of laodicean
[1:44:02] thinking
[1:44:02] the strongholds of reasoning and wisdom
[1:44:04] and intellect of man will be brought
[1:44:06] down
[1:44:07] amen what is it those are the devil's
[1:44:09] tools that trip you up on the word
[1:44:12] but those strongholds will be brought
[1:44:14] down
[1:44:15] by the word of god that's given to us on
[1:44:16] this day
[1:44:19] and look at the result verse 6
[1:44:22] in having and readiness to revenge all
[1:44:25] disobedience
[1:44:27] when your obedience is fulfilled
[1:44:31] when you finally come to the place of
[1:44:33] full surrender to the full word of god
[1:44:36] when your obedience is fulfilled or
[1:44:37] completed
[1:44:39] there'll be a readiness to revenge all
[1:44:42] disobedience
[1:44:44] when your obedience is fulfilled
[1:44:48] say god go get that devil no you just
[1:44:49] obey when your obedience is fulfilled
[1:44:51] he'll revenge all disobedience
[1:44:53] god go get those people go get that
[1:44:55] they're they're lying against the word
[1:44:57] and the enemies working against my
[1:44:58] children and all that you quit
[1:45:00] fighting that and you come into
[1:45:01] obedience to the word because when your
[1:45:03] obedience is completed
[1:45:04] he'll revenge all disobedience he's
[1:45:06] looking for a bride to come to a full
[1:45:08] surrender to the full word of god
[1:45:10] and when her obedience is fulfilled what
[1:45:13] has happened there's never been a bride
[1:45:14] that could fully obey
[1:45:16] amen there's been a bride that fell then
[1:45:18] a bride that fell then a bride that fell
[1:45:19] then a bride that fell but he's
[1:45:21] predestinated one that won't fall by the
[1:45:23] word
[1:45:23] she'll stand on that word and she'll
[1:45:25] come to a full surrender to the word
[1:45:28] and when her obedience is fulfilled
[1:45:30] he'll revenge all disobedience
[1:45:33] oh i'm past the time of saying god get
[1:45:36] him god get him god get him
[1:45:37] i'm saying god help me amen help me to
[1:45:40] live this word help me to know this word
[1:45:42] to surrender to it to die
[1:45:44] to myself and give up every desire all
[1:45:46] selfishness
[1:45:47] all self-will let me not love my life
[1:45:50] unto death
[1:45:52] but let me die so that i can come to
[1:45:55] that full obedience
[1:45:57] because when one subject let them down
[1:45:59] the bar on the word
[1:46:00] satan got victory over the word the
[1:46:03] battle is between
[1:46:04] lucifer and the word of god
[1:46:08] satan is battling that word and when you
[1:46:10] let down the bar on the word he gets it
[1:46:12] he once again gets victory over the word
[1:46:15] and that's how he's won the battle every
[1:46:17] time
[1:46:22] the greatest battle ever fought he says
[1:46:24] and i thought of the order of the
[1:46:26] heavenly host not one of them is out of
[1:46:28] place
[1:46:29] everyone keeps its time perfectly god's
[1:46:32] great army
[1:46:33] i thought of the soldiers how that that
[1:46:35] moon would happen to get out of order
[1:46:37] the earth would be covered again with
[1:46:38] water just in a few minutes
[1:46:40] the earth would be just like it was when
[1:46:42] god decided to use it
[1:46:43] for it to have us here on on it it was
[1:46:46] without form and void and darkness and
[1:46:47] water was upon the breath of the earth
[1:46:49] and if that moon would ever move it
[1:46:51] would do the same thing again
[1:46:54] when the moon rocks a little bit away
[1:46:55] from the earth the tides come up
[1:46:57] when it goes down just follow the tides
[1:46:59] it's god's great army
[1:47:00] and when i thought that being god's
[1:47:02] great army he's speaking of the heavenly
[1:47:04] host
[1:47:05] and they're all they're all in their
[1:47:07] position they're all in their place
[1:47:09] and when there's one little movement of
[1:47:11] those it affects earth
[1:47:14] and he's typing the heavenly host with
[1:47:15] us because god told abraham
[1:47:18] look at the look up at the stars if you
[1:47:19] can count them so shall thy seed be so
[1:47:22] the royal seed is like the stars in
[1:47:24] heaven
[1:47:24] and brother venom tells us how god
[1:47:26] created amen he
[1:47:27] he had the sun a little burning ball and
[1:47:29] he'd spit a little clicker out and that
[1:47:31] little clinker would go moving
[1:47:32] amen and as it moved through space it'd
[1:47:34] eventually get to a place he would say
[1:47:36] stop and another little clinker come off
[1:47:38] in another and he'd stop
[1:47:39] and stop he said what's he doing he's
[1:47:41] writing his bible
[1:47:44] in the sky he's writing his bible what
[1:47:46] are those stars those stars represent
[1:47:48] sons and daughters of god amen what is
[1:47:51] the words in the book it's the believer
[1:47:52] amen he's writing his bible with those
[1:47:55] stars in the heaven
[1:47:56] and if that heavenly host would ever get
[1:47:58] out of position
[1:47:59] it would wreck things on the earth
[1:48:00] that's what happened when eve got out of
[1:48:02] her position
[1:48:03] she wrecked things on the earth
[1:48:09] he says now continue on the same quote
[1:48:12] now we went to bed
[1:48:13] and then i begin to think that not one
[1:48:15] of those gets out of their place
[1:48:17] they all set in place and if there's a
[1:48:18] moving anywhere of them it's for a cause
[1:48:21] and will affect this earth
[1:48:23] we just see the result of it now from
[1:48:25] some of them moving into other spots
[1:48:26] it's affected it's a
[1:48:28] it affects everything and i thought then
[1:48:31] if that great
[1:48:32] heavenly host like that has to keep its
[1:48:33] place to make everything in order
[1:48:35] what about the disorder of the earthly
[1:48:37] host
[1:48:39] how when one gets out of order it throws
[1:48:41] the whole thing out of cater
[1:48:43] the whole program of god is upset when
[1:48:45] one member gets out of order
[1:48:46] we should continually strive to keep the
[1:48:48] order of the spirit
[1:48:52] praise god that's a tall order
[1:48:56] that's an overwhelming order that when
[1:48:58] one gets out of kilter
[1:49:00] it brings everything out of kilter but
[1:49:01] there was one who got out of kilter and
[1:49:03] that was eve
[1:49:05] and it moved everything out of kilter
[1:49:08] but it's all right
[1:49:09] god had a plan nothing was outside of
[1:49:12] his knowledge and nothing moved without
[1:49:13] him knowing
[1:49:15] and god has had a plan for for
[1:49:18] millennial
[1:49:19] upon millennium upon millennium he's had
[1:49:21] a plan
[1:49:22] for millions and billions of years
[1:49:24] before there was a molecule he had a
[1:49:25] plan
[1:49:26] before there was stardust before there
[1:49:27] was an atom he had a book
[1:49:30] of the lamb slain before the foundation
[1:49:32] of the world and in that book were
[1:49:33] written those attributes that would be
[1:49:34] expressed
[1:49:35] and i was there
[1:49:39] and god had a plan for my life he has a
[1:49:41] plan for your life
[1:49:44] and it seems overwhelming when you see
[1:49:46] eve let down on one word and look at all
[1:49:48] the chaos and
[1:49:50] as long as one subject lets down on one
[1:49:52] word look it brings chaos
[1:49:54] the devil gets victory over the word and
[1:49:56] we look at ourselves and we say
[1:49:58] it's not possible we're never going to
[1:50:01] get out of here
[1:50:03] but oh there's another quote i want to
[1:50:05] read
[1:50:06] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:50:09] he said predestinated
[1:50:11] there's the mystery he before christ or
[1:50:14] anything else was ever on earth
[1:50:16] you see his great mystery that he chose
[1:50:19] the bride
[1:50:20] knowing he would fall from disbelieving
[1:50:22] the word knowing that she would felt
[1:50:24] fall
[1:50:25] but he would choose a bride that would
[1:50:28] not
[1:50:29] fall that would hold to that word
[1:50:32] regardless of what all the rest of the
[1:50:33] world had to say about him
[1:50:35] they would hold to that word they are
[1:50:37] predestinated to stand there
[1:50:39] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:50:41] predestinated the church
[1:50:43] to that great glorious stand
[1:50:46] he knew he knew eve would fall so before
[1:50:49] she fell he already had a predestinated
[1:50:52] church that wouldn't fall
[1:50:54] he knew the jewish church would fall he
[1:50:56] knew the first church age would fall he
[1:50:58] knew every constant
[1:50:59] subsequent church age would fall he
[1:51:01] already knew it all so he had to
[1:51:03] predestinate one that was predestinated
[1:51:05] not to
[1:51:06] fall friends we're going to overcome in
[1:51:08] this day
[1:51:09] not by willpower not by strength amen
[1:51:11] not by my but by his spirit
[1:51:13] saith the lord he has predestinated a
[1:51:15] church that won't fall
[1:51:17] and in order to keep her from falling he
[1:51:19] said i'm going to do something i haven't
[1:51:20] done yet
[1:51:21] i'm going to come down myself amen and
[1:51:24] i'm going to unite with that bride and
[1:51:26] the headship coming to the body
[1:51:27] and i'm going to keep whispering love
[1:51:29] secrets in her ear to keep her on the
[1:51:31] straight path
[1:51:32] because this is reconciling heaven and
[1:51:34] earth we're bringing a harmony back to
[1:51:35] everything that fell out of harmony
[1:51:37] and the harmony between bride and this
[1:51:39] christ is bringing a harmony back to the
[1:51:41] heavenly realms friends
[1:51:44] god is using this journey through this
[1:51:46] earth
[1:51:47] to reconcile heaven and earth
[1:51:50] there's more going on than meets the eye
[1:51:53] there's more going on in our lives than
[1:51:55] we realize
[1:51:56] amen in this message is coming this day
[1:51:58] to lift us
[1:51:59] out of the chicken yard to get us up
[1:52:01] above all the carnal things
[1:52:03] and out of laodicea so that we can fly
[1:52:06] high through the open door
[1:52:07] and see the plan of god and so that we
[1:52:10] could surrender to his plan
[1:52:12] day by day say how do we have this kind
[1:52:15] of victory
[1:52:17] every day choose the word
[1:52:22] in every circumstance brother brenham
[1:52:25] said eve was tested by the word this
[1:52:26] bride will be tested by the word
[1:52:31] you'll come to situations where you have
[1:52:33] to choose this way
[1:52:34] or that way and friends the choices
[1:52:38] in my life are getting so very
[1:52:42] complicated
[1:52:44] it used to be so easy don't go to that
[1:52:47] place
[1:52:48] don't go to that place but now we're
[1:52:49] having choices
[1:52:52] when your brothers and sisters are
[1:52:54] making choices that aren't the word
[1:52:57] and you love them and your family your
[1:53:00] own desire
[1:53:01] you have all these things and you have
[1:53:03] to stay
[1:53:04] with the word and it gets so complicated
[1:53:07] because
[1:53:07] this is a good brother and i love them
[1:53:09] this is a good sister and i love them
[1:53:11] and i know they love the lord but
[1:53:12] they're doing this but brother bam
[1:53:14] taught us not to do that
[1:53:15] and i've got to take my stand on the
[1:53:17] word i'm telling you
[1:53:18] it's getting so complicated that you've
[1:53:20] got to lose filio love and go to agape
[1:53:23] love
[1:53:23] and say i don't understand it i love you
[1:53:26] my brother i love you my sister i still
[1:53:28] believe you're my brother and sister but
[1:53:30] this is wrong according to the word and
[1:53:32] i'm going to stay with the word
[1:53:35] this bride will be tested by the word
[1:53:37] and she's predestinated not to fall
[1:53:39] she's going to make the harder choice
[1:53:41] she's going to go the harder way for
[1:53:43] this is my choice saith the lord you
[1:53:46] think that was just for brother branham
[1:53:47] that's for you too
[1:53:48] friends he said you've chosen the harder
[1:53:52] way
[1:53:52] the narrow road the harder path you did
[1:53:55] so
[1:53:56] of your own choosing that's god's
[1:53:58] program
[1:54:01] god's program is he can predestinate but
[1:54:03] he can't force
[1:54:07] he can't take away free moral agency
[1:54:11] he can predestinate but he knows what
[1:54:13] life is in you
[1:54:15] and he can bring a spirit to quicken
[1:54:17] that life
[1:54:18] and in that life there's certain dna
[1:54:20] there's certain characteristics or
[1:54:22] certain attributes
[1:54:23] that will express because he planted
[1:54:25] that seed
[1:54:26] and he knows what's in that seed and
[1:54:28] under the right conditions
[1:54:30] it will express
[1:54:33] it's not what you and i do it's what we
[1:54:35] surrender ourselves to
[1:54:36] the life is already there it's been
[1:54:38] quickened by the spirit
[1:54:41] and by the spirit it's leading that life
[1:54:43] into a full manifestation
[1:54:45] you already have what you need to
[1:54:48] overcome
[1:54:50] we just have to keep surrendering to the
[1:54:51] word
[1:54:54] god is going to have this bride overcome
[1:54:57] all those tricky circumstances all those
[1:55:01] difficult decisions and those hard
[1:55:03] conversations and
[1:55:04] i'm telling you they're difficult
[1:55:06] they're not getting easier they're
[1:55:07] getting harder
[1:55:09] they're not getting it it's it's
[1:55:11] grieving through the
[1:55:12] to your soul it's so grieving to have to
[1:55:14] make these choices
[1:55:16] amen but this bride will not let down
[1:55:19] on the word she will stay with the word
[1:55:22] by
[1:55:22] predestination
[1:55:25] and i say thank god that he's told us
[1:55:28] what our lot is in this day
[1:55:31] it's not going to be easier and it's not
[1:55:32] going to get easier
[1:55:34] it's going to get harder but god's
[1:55:37] predestinated a bride to stay with the
[1:55:39] word
[1:55:40] and in staying with the word when your
[1:55:43] obedience is full
[1:55:46] amen he'll bring judgment to all
[1:55:48] disobedience
[1:55:53] he knew eve would fall
[1:55:56] but he predestinated a bride that
[1:55:58] wouldn't fall because before the
[1:56:00] foundation of the world before he made a
[1:56:02] world before he made a lucifer
[1:56:04] he already had a plan and that plan was
[1:56:07] going to express
[1:56:08] god in the fullness of his character and
[1:56:10] the fullness of his nature
[1:56:12] and at the end of that plan he's going
[1:56:14] to reconcile back
[1:56:15] all things to its original harmony and
[1:56:18] lucifer will be annihilated
[1:56:24] and spoken word is the original seed the
[1:56:27] prophet of god says
[1:56:28] now christ was manifested to destroy the
[1:56:30] works of the devil
[1:56:33] you believe that i can't explain all
[1:56:35] this i'm just going to go through it
[1:56:36] just quickly now hit the high places so
[1:56:38] you won't stay too long
[1:56:39] christ was manifested to destroy the
[1:56:42] works of the devil is that right
[1:56:44] you all believe that what was he god's
[1:56:46] word which destroys the works of the
[1:56:48] hybrid the devil
[1:56:49] is that right he was done to do that he
[1:56:51] was born to be that to destroy the works
[1:56:53] of the devil
[1:56:54] now his body is to do the same that's
[1:56:58] our job
[1:57:00] the body is to do the same because the
[1:57:02] body is head and body together that
[1:57:04] right
[1:57:04] if christ is the head was the word his
[1:57:06] body has to be the same thing
[1:57:08] as his head was that's right and the
[1:57:10] church
[1:57:11] of the word born of the word
[1:57:15] virgin burned from the virgin born from
[1:57:17] the word not a denomination now a virgin
[1:57:20] born from the word
[1:57:21] the way the body operates is by the head
[1:57:24] he was manifest to destroy the works of
[1:57:26] the devil his body is manifested do the
[1:57:28] same
[1:57:29] but she'll do so by being under the
[1:57:31] headship of the head
[1:57:32] which is this word
[1:57:36] brother brahm says in the pyramid church
[1:57:37] age he says those in the bride do
[1:57:40] only his will no one can make them do
[1:57:44] otherwise
[1:57:45] they have thus saith the lord or they
[1:57:47] keep still they know that it has to be
[1:57:49] god
[1:57:49] in them doing the works fulfilling his
[1:57:51] own word
[1:57:52] he did not complete all his work while
[1:57:54] in his earthly ministry
[1:57:56] so now he works in and through the bride
[1:57:59] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:58:01] for him to do certain things
[1:58:02] that he must now do but he will now
[1:58:05] fulfill
[1:58:06] through the bride that work which he
[1:58:08] left for this
[1:58:09] specific time that
[1:58:13] is a sure word friends that came when an
[1:58:15] angel of the lord said pick up your pen
[1:58:17] and write that wasn't brother branham's
[1:58:19] words that was god using him to write
[1:58:21] out a message to the church
[1:58:22] and that message to the church is god
[1:58:24] will do the work that he saved for this
[1:58:25] specific time
[1:58:26] and he will do it through the bride
[1:58:29] amen what he needs is he needs a people
[1:58:32] on this earth that says i love you and i
[1:58:34] will surrender to that and whatever you
[1:58:36] say
[1:58:36] is what i desire to do i will choose to
[1:58:39] die
[1:58:40] i will choose to surrender i will i will
[1:58:43] make
[1:58:43] the difficult choice like he told
[1:58:45] brother branham he says you chose to
[1:58:47] narrow way
[1:58:47] you chose the harder path you did so of
[1:58:50] your
[1:58:51] own choosing
[1:58:54] he says it was the precise
[1:58:57] and correct choice for it is
[1:59:01] my way it was god's predestinated way
[1:59:06] god already had a plan he already saw it
[1:59:09] he already knew what that prophet would
[1:59:11] do
[1:59:12] but he could not force that prophet to
[1:59:14] do that that man as a man had to make
[1:59:16] his own choice
[1:59:17] but when he made that choice it was the
[1:59:19] precise
[1:59:20] and correct choice and it was god's
[1:59:23] way
[1:59:26] i said god you've ordained us to make
[1:59:29] the harder choice
[1:59:32] amen but we must do so
[1:59:35] of our own choosing say god i choose
[1:59:39] your word
[1:59:40] i choose to let it have preeminence in
[1:59:42] me i choose to let
[1:59:44] it live in me oh god i surrender to this
[1:59:47] word
[1:59:51] i want the harmony restored
[1:59:55] i want the work of reconciliation to
[1:59:57] finish when the last seed comes in
[1:59:59] amen the bride will go
[2:00:02] i want to be a voice that's calling be
[2:00:04] ye reconciled to god
[2:00:07] i want god amen to finish the work that
[2:00:10] he left for this specific time i wanted
[2:00:12] to do it through me
[2:00:13] i want him to do it through me because i
[2:00:15] chose the harder way i chose the narrow
[2:00:17] path
[2:00:17] i did it of my own choosing because i
[2:00:19] wanted to
[2:00:21] because all i wanted to do was please
[2:00:23] him
[2:00:24] and i don't even have that desire of my
[2:00:27] own natural birth i have that desire
[2:00:29] because of the seed that's on the inside
[2:00:30] of me
[2:00:32] it's all god working his plan it's all
[2:00:34] gone i mean
[2:00:35] god knew this before the foundation of
[2:00:37] the world and god had it all planned
[2:00:39] down and it's all god
[2:00:40] every part of it is god and this part
[2:00:44] that i'm playing
[2:00:45] is god i say god help me not to stand in
[2:00:49] your way
[2:00:50] but let you play your part faithfully
[2:00:55] turn to romans 16.
[2:00:59] i'd like to finish with this verse as
[2:01:00] the musicians come
[2:01:02] blake as you come
[2:01:06] romans 16.
[2:01:10] verse 20
[2:01:13] and the god of peace shall bruce satan
[2:01:16] under your feet shortly
[2:01:20] this is part of god's plan
[2:01:24] this is his plan for reconciling all
[2:01:26] things this is his plan
[2:01:27] for finishing the work that jesus didn't
[2:01:29] finish in his earthly ministry but he
[2:01:31] will now do in and through the bride
[2:01:33] this is part of that plan and it's going
[2:01:35] to be god who does the work not you and
[2:01:37] i
[2:01:38] and the god of peace shall brew satan
[2:01:41] under your
[2:01:42] feet shortly and i'll say
[2:01:45] do you make the choice
[2:01:49] choose the word just choose the word
[2:01:53] brother branham says in the first seal
[2:01:56] he quotes revelation 12 7-9 satan that
[2:02:00] spirit the devil which is
[2:02:01] up there now accuser of our brethren all
[2:02:04] right the church is taken up and satan
[2:02:06] is cast out
[2:02:07] when the church goes up satan comes
[2:02:11] down brother branham is singing a song
[2:02:15] and the message god's only provided
[2:02:17] place of worship all the way at the end
[2:02:18] he's singing a song he's singing i've
[2:02:21] got a father
[2:02:22] over yonder and he sings the first part
[2:02:25] of the song and he comes to the second
[2:02:26] bride he says some bright day i'll go
[2:02:28] and see him and he repeats that line
[2:02:31] he says and then he goes oh won't it be
[2:02:33] a happy meeting
[2:02:35] won't it be word goes to word meeting
[2:02:38] when the bride goes up
[2:02:40] word by word oh friends
[2:02:43] i want to be going up word by word as
[2:02:46] god reveals the word step higher
[2:02:48] step higher and put pressure on the
[2:02:50] devil may he be dropping lower
[2:02:51] all the time until that great day that
[2:02:54] last predestinated seed comes in
[2:02:56] the church goes and when she goes up he
[2:02:58] comes down
[2:02:59] because he's lost his position
[2:03:02] say god help me to keep your word
[2:03:06] but i believe it with all that's in me i
[2:03:09] don't have any ability in myself
[2:03:11] amen if it's left to me i'll do the same
[2:03:12] thing eve did i'll do the same thing the
[2:03:14] first church did but all what satisfies
[2:03:16] my heart is i believe that message that
[2:03:18] god gave us
[2:03:19] that he has predestinated a bride that
[2:03:21] won't fall
[2:03:22] because he promised he wouldn't let her
[2:03:24] fall
[2:03:26] we've seen a manifestation like nobody
[2:03:29] has ever seen before friends
[2:03:30] we have we've got it on tapes we've got
[2:03:32] a document we got on video
[2:03:34] no other age had the opportunity to have
[2:03:36] this display of vindication for the word
[2:03:39] that you and i have seen god did that
[2:03:41] for a reason
[2:03:42] no other age had a cloud picture that
[2:03:44] they could hang on their house and turn
[2:03:45] sideways and see that that's the
[2:03:47] headship coming to the body so that we
[2:03:49] would know what day we're in so that we
[2:03:50] would have the confidence just to trust
[2:03:52] him
[2:03:52] if he did all that can he keep this part
[2:03:55] of the word too
[2:03:57] amen if he could show his coming in the
[2:03:59] clouds amen
[2:04:01] if he could if he could if he could
[2:04:03] reveal the mysteries if he could open
[2:04:05] the seals through a prophetic gift if he
[2:04:06] could do all that and
[2:04:07] show me his willingness to keep his word
[2:04:10] and what he'll go through to keep his
[2:04:12] word
[2:04:12] and display it to you and i won't he
[2:04:14] keep this word too
[2:04:17] because this attribute that's down to me
[2:04:19] is part of that word and must be
[2:04:20] reconciled back amen
[2:04:22] it must come back into its original
[2:04:24] harmony amen and i
[2:04:26] i can believe that god will do it not by
[2:04:28] my ability but by the spirit that he has
[2:04:30] set his bride in this day
[2:04:32] by the headship that is united with the
[2:04:34] bride if i can just surrender to that
[2:04:36] he can do all things
[2:04:40] i can do all things through christ who
[2:04:42] strengthens me
[2:04:44] it's not just an earthly walk you're not
[2:04:47] just hearing an earthly walk
[2:04:49] god is doing a work and he's
[2:04:53] he's fixing the problem
[2:04:57] on earth and in heaven
[2:05:01] your life is part of that plan
[2:05:04] your manifestation you're revealing the
[2:05:07] word is part of that great plan of
[2:05:09] redemption
[2:05:10] and i say god by your grace let me play
[2:05:13] my part
[2:05:15] because i surrender to you let's all
[2:05:18] stand friends
[2:05:22] i said wednesday it's not about
[2:05:26] church it's not about a good sunday
[2:05:29] service
[2:05:29] it's not about just a good this or a
[2:05:31] good day it's so much bigger than that
[2:05:34] all of that's part of it but if we get
[2:05:35] down into those things we've missed what
[2:05:37] god's doing in this day
[2:05:39] it's about god reconciling all things
[2:05:41] and to himself
[2:05:43] it's about god's plan of redemption to
[2:05:45] bring back
[2:05:47] and to bring a true harmony and i say
[2:05:49] god opened my eyes to see the bigger
[2:05:51] picture
[2:05:53] because if i can see the bigger picture
[2:05:54] you'll give me faith to walk
[2:05:56] every day of my life and harmony with
[2:05:58] your word
[2:06:00] let's bow our heads and pray
[2:06:04] lord jesus we thank you for this word
[2:06:06] almighty god
[2:06:08] god we're so thankful god that you have
[2:06:10] sent a prophet in this day
[2:06:12] to peel back this book lord just so we
[2:06:15] could see
[2:06:16] that you've had a plan from long before
[2:06:18] the foundation of the world
[2:06:20] before i come into this manifestation
[2:06:22] before i face the trials and troubles
[2:06:24] that i face
[2:06:25] you already had a plan and in your plan
[2:06:28] i've already overcome
[2:06:30] and in your plan i'm already part of
[2:06:32] that victory and in your plan
[2:06:34] you've already used me to overcome the
[2:06:36] devil
[2:06:37] oh god let me get in tune with your plan
[2:06:41] let me get dialed into your plan so that
[2:06:43] every obstacle and every day
[2:06:45] amen becomes lord not not the
[2:06:48] devastation of my life but it becomes
[2:06:50] you working
[2:06:51] something out in your plan so that i can
[2:06:53] have faith just to take you at your word
[2:06:55] and move forward
[2:06:57] and trust you for what you've promised
[2:07:00] to do in this hour and what you promised
[2:07:02] to do through me
[2:07:04] god bless your people lift us higher
[2:07:06] lord let us move beyond the carnal into
[2:07:09] the supernatural
[2:07:11] let us see lord that there's so much
[2:07:13] more going on than what meets the eye
[2:07:16] and our lives here are so much more
[2:07:18] important than we realize
[2:07:20] for every attribute must be expressed
[2:07:23] and every attribute must express the
[2:07:25] word
[2:07:26] god help us to express our attribute in
[2:07:28] this hour
[2:07:30] help us to stay with your word god we
[2:07:33] love you for what you showed to us we
[2:07:35] love you for what you're doing
[2:07:37] we asked god that you would continue the
[2:07:39] work
[2:07:40] for your faithful to finish the work
[2:07:42] that you've begun
[2:07:44] we surrender to you lord i surrender
[2:07:46] afresh to you
[2:07:48] take me and use me i recognize lord this
[2:07:50] is bigger than me
[2:07:52] this is bigger than my little brain this
[2:07:55] is bigger than what my eyes can see or
[2:07:56] my little brain can perceive it's so
[2:07:58] much bigger than that

[2:11:35] this is a wonderful day for the williams
[2:11:36] family i don't know if you've had a
[2:11:38] chance to meet them or not but they've
[2:11:39] been attending here for several weeks
[2:11:41] and
[2:11:42] they want this they intend to make this
[2:11:43] their home church
[2:11:45] they've been in contact with the message
[2:11:47] for several years and for several years
[2:11:48] i've been listening but
[2:11:50] it's having an effect on brother chuck
[2:11:52] and he wants to surrender completely
[2:11:54] to the lord and he believes that the
[2:11:56] father is drawing him and he wants to
[2:11:58] take this step of water baptism in jesus
[2:12:00] name
[2:12:01] so this is a tremendous victory and
[2:12:04] we're just happy to have them here and
[2:12:05] happy to be able to participate in this
[2:12:07] day with them
[2:12:08] and celebrate and rejoice in what the
[2:12:10] lord is doing
[2:12:12] and i'd encourage you to get to meet
[2:12:13] them and shake their hands and have some
[2:12:15] fellowship because
[2:12:16] they have a wonderful testimony of what
[2:12:18] god is doing brother chuck
[2:12:21] because you love the lord jesus christ
[2:12:23] and you feel him calling you and drawing
[2:12:24] you
[2:12:25] you want to surrender your whole life to
[2:12:27] him is with great pleasure that i
[2:12:29] baptize you
[2:12:31] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:12:37] lord jesus i lay hands on my brother he
[2:12:40] has come in obedience to your word he
[2:12:42] has repented lord he's turned from his
[2:12:44] way he's turning to yours
[2:12:45] completely and fully with all of his
[2:12:47] heart because you've drawn him
[2:12:49] and now i pray god that you do the work
[2:12:51] that you've promised to do that you
[2:12:52] would fill him with the baptism of the
[2:12:54] holy ghost
[2:12:55] that you would sanctify his life that
[2:12:56] you would purge everything out of his
[2:12:58] life that's not like you
[2:13:00] make him be a clean vessel to be a
[2:13:01] recipient of your spirit
[2:13:03] and by the power of your holy ghost
[2:13:04] would you put him in position and use
[2:13:06] him as a lighthouse
[2:13:07] to shine the light of this gospel to the
[2:13:09] world bless him as he leads his home
[2:13:12] bless his family lord
