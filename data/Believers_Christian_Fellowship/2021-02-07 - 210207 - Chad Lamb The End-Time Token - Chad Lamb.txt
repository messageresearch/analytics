gently as i [Music] [Music] is [Music] is be free speak to me gently [Music] did amen good morning and god bless you saints certainly good to be with you this morning and while we're standing let's take our bibles and go right to the word go to titus this one say how much i appreciate the atmosphere of worship it means a lot amen it means a lot before we read the scripture i want to just give a big thank you to a couple brothers brother steve miller is on vacation for a little while so he's not here to do the normal plowing on the parking lot so yesterday brother dean hatfield and his son xavier came out and brother greg byrd and wyatt came out and cleaned the parking lot so we want to thank them for that amen and this morning thank you guys and this morning brother elmer came out and did it and i don't know who helped him but we appreciate these guys stepping in while steve is gone and making it nice for us amen god is good i also want to remind you that we have communion service this afternoon communion feet washing and we're also going to do our annual vote this time it's for deacons a vote of confirmation for the deacons and also a vote to confirm brother dean hatfield as the new treasurer of the church so we want to remind you of that for this afternoon and let's look at titus chapter 3 together titus chapter 3 i'm going to read verse 3. for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving diverse lust and pleasures living in malice envy hateful and hating one another were you there at one time so do you see yourself in the scripture amen but let's not stop there let's keep reading but after that the kindness and love of god our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the holy ghost that word renewing means to to um oh i got it here i'm going to mess it up if i don't read it verbatim it means a renewal a complete change for the better a complete change for the better so i read that verse 5 again not by works of any righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the holy ghost which he shed on us abundantly through christ jesus our savior amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord for your goodness lord for truly this is a message of grace and a message of mercy to us lord god you've come at the end time lord to peel away all the misunderstandings and all the wrong teachings and you've come to show us who we are and you've come to show us how much you love us and what your grace has done for us no we just asked today that you would bless us lord in the preaching of the word for this is your way this is your plan may it serve your purpose this morning and may you speak to us yourself may it be you who feeds your sheep this morning we pray in jesus christ's name amen you can all have your seats i mean i want to continue on in the the path we've been going uh last week we were talking about the token is the assurance and i want to say a few things along those lines and then move on a little bit but today i'd like to talk about the end time token i just want to spend some time reviewing that and talking about that it's been such a pleasure these last few services because i never planned on preaching these things i never had a a mind to go through justification sanctification baptism holy ghost that wasn't pre-planned it's just the way it went and when you go to preach those things and sometimes it seems like well that's common we all know those things and they're just they've been understood for years but i tell you i enjoyed it amen i enjoyed it it's always so much deeper the word of god is so much deeper i mean the scripture says if you think you know anything you don't know anything as you ought amen and we don't even understand justification as we ought amen we don't even understand sanctification as we are but thank god as we go on and he continues to reveal himself we see it more clearly and more clearly and we find out it's deeper it's wider it's broader it's higher it's more than we ever thought amen and it settles us so much so while we're in the bible let's turn to ephesians chapter one and read a couple more scriptures here ephesians chapter 1 and we found out that these things were given by grace and it's the mercy of god and if it's mercy and by grace then it's something that cannot be earned this is really important for us to realize because uh with a wrong understanding uh we we begin to have the concept of earning or working or or our our somehow uh if i could just say it the way i understand it uh somehow sometimes we get the concept of almost it's almost like levels i'm going uh from this level to this level if i work hard i'll make an achievement and and the reward for that achievement is to go to the next level but you realize there's never been a level opened up that wasn't opened up by grace amen and sometimes you know it's not that we don't strive amen it's not that we don't earnestly seek after the lord it's not like it's not a great desire for us to press into the kingdom there's two parts to this amen there's there's a part where you have a desire for god a part that you press into the kingdom a part that you pray and that you you you know you judge yourself you stay in the word all of those things are a great desire to grow closer to god but when we back it up a little bit you realize that desire that you have came from god and without god even giving you the without the seed in your soul amen you don't even have the capacity to seek after god the desire or the ability even to receive the word so it's it takes away the whole notion of i'm i'm striving and i'm achieving and i'm i'm gaining amen all you're doing is responding to his call all you're doing is he's pulling amen and you think you're pushing but really you're responding responding to a pull so it's a matter of perspective so many times our language is developed by our own perspective amen but the prophet of god come and he lifted us out of our perspective and lifted us up on high and gave us eagle vision and showed you cannot even come unless the father draws you amen you cannot believe unless you have something to believe with you can't even hear the word and understand unless there's a receptor on the inside to pick up that frequency so it was all gone it's all by grace it's all by mercy amen but it doesn't mean that we still don't have a desire it doesn't mean that we don't strive it doesn't mean that that we don't seek his face amen we do all that because he put us in us to do it amen praise god see one of the things that ends up frustrating believers is when we have the concept or the idea of reward amen then we have the concept or idea of if i get this good enough and i do it well enough and if i get to a certain level i get to go to the next level and the problem is uh with that kind of mentality there's always stumblings there's always trippings there's always something that's going on in our lives that that gives us the wrong concept that we've gone back to zero amen but with god you've never gone back to zero friends you know i i i drew out for the youth years ago and i don't know if anybody will remember the drawing but i had a little stick figure and i had him on a on a line you know from from here up to here you know up to to where he wants to be in christ and on that line i drew the line as the foundation of grace and that you can never fall below grace so you get on this journey with god and you increase in knowledge and understanding of the lord you grow in revelation and you're climbing up this climb but if you fall amen there's a line of grace there and mercy you don't fall back to the starting point you just fall on the line and you get up and you dust your knees off and you say god i'm sorry and you keep walking where you are amen but when we have the the concept if i've fallen off this line i've gone to the bottom i got to go back and get on the line there's such a discouragement that comes with this there's such a disheartened feeling amen that people begin to throw in the towel and i'll never and i can't amen and when you start to say things like i'll never and i can't and i've tried so hard it means you've got a wrong concept from the beginning because you think it's you i can't well that was obvious from day one amen i'll never that's true also amen i i'm never going to be good enough that was that was evident before you were born so when we use that terminology what we're where we're saying is i have a complete wrong concept of what god is doing in my life but when we look at it correctly we say he's drawing me there's something that god's doing and it's more than me and i need him i cannot do this on my own i cannot i cannot do one thing without him and then we have the right concept of our walk and so the whole idea of falling and going back to scratch we need to get rid of that idea and say if i fall i fall i repent i ask god to forgive me amen but nothing has changed with me and god nothing has changed with this foreordained plan for my life nothing has changed amen with his predestination nothing has changed with my sonship what has changed is is i allowed something in the flesh amen something and the old carnal nature that old sticky cockleburn nature that tripped me up amen and i need to realize that that was me and i was wrong and i repent and i'm sorry god and i need to come back to your word amen but i got to keep walking amen i don't stop and go all the way back to zero so some of these some of these concepts that are so discouraging is really a lack of revelation and misunderstanding but god and his mercy came and brought us a prophet to peel those things away so let's look at ephesians chapter 1 verse 3. blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ jesus according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love i love that verse he chose me before he chose me in him before the foundation of the world that i should be holy and without blame before him in love because that's the condition he wants me to be in having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved he made us accepted in the beloved you didn't climb the ladder fast enough you didn't memorize the bible verses good enough you didn't you understand what i'm saying he made us accept it in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in this dispensation you know what so far what did you have to do with this as we're reading so far what did you have to do with it how did you this all this all took place in the mind of god before you were ever breathing breath upon this earth he purposed it was according to his purpose his good pleasure his will amen wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery was a will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will i am saved because he wants me to be saved not just because i want to be saved and i want to be saved because he wanted me to be saved verse 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom ye also in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory the apostle paul doesn't make it difficult here he shows you that god had a plan for you he chose you and him before the foundation of the world he wanted to choose you that way so that you would be holy and blameless before him in love he wanted to call you because he predestinated you he did all of these things and then verse 13 he just starts to he starts to explain the path that you came in this journey and he says in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth when you heard the word of truth you began to trust him because the word of truth was awakening that portion that he placed of himself down inside of you you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise paul didn't make it hard he just told you you heard the truth you believed after you believed you were sealed praise be to god which is the earnest of our inheritance which is the down payment or the earnest money the money that will hold the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory i love that portion of scripture let's turn together over to luke see it's totally different concept when you think that you're trying to do something or get something from god or get somewhere with god that concept is it's you centered and the effort is yours the the ability is yours it's all you simple i'm trying to get somewhere with god i'm trying to get this i'm trying to do this i'm trying to do that but when we flip it on its head and saying that god had already predetermined and purposed that because he already predetermined in purpose that he put something inside of you that he could work with and now he sent his word so he can begin to draw you closer to himself that is a totally different concept now you realize amen it's not all the power is not in my wheels i'm not the one driving the whole thing i'm being pulled there's a greater power than the power within me amen and that's the power that's drawing me is the greater than the power amen that is in my flesh that is in my carnal makeup there wasn't enough power to get there amen i want to i want to go amen i put her in gear i want to get there but in and of myself i can never climb that hill i can never get there there's got to be a greater power than the power in my carnal man to get there no matter how much i desire to get there and that greater power is him pulling me amen and it's a sure it's an assurance that i will reach the destination because i'm hooked to him and he's got the winch pulling me up the hill praise be to god luke 11 and verse 9. let's turn to luke and we'll look at 11. and verse 9 and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg will he offer a scorpion if you then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him praise god when we make this complicated and we get ourselves injected and make it somehow we make it in a we make it to where uh we're trying so hard but god's not helping me like i've tried i've done everything i'm trying so hard but god won't help me we're denying this very scripture because what we're saying is without saying it what we're saying is god is an evil father because i'm asking for the holy ghost he's giving me nothing i i've done everything that he told me to do and i'm asking for the holy spirit but he's refusing to give me we're taking this scripture and we're saying according to this scripture that we have an evil father but if you have a natural father who would not give you a stone or a scorpion but would give you bread if you ask then your heavenly father will give you the holy spirit if you ask you just first have to believe and know that he's your heavenly father and if god has given you a revelation that he's your heavenly father amen and that you you love him and you obey him as a father you can ask and you can expect to receive amen as long as you're as long as you're in your mind you're not dictating how you'll receive it why the way it must come or how it must look or what sensation must come with it as long as you're not dictating to god how we must give it if you're willing to just ask and receive in whatever way he gives it he is a good father and he will give the holy ghost to them who ask to his children he's a good father to his children if you're his child and know that he's you're his child and by faith you can say i'm a son or a daughter of god then you can just simply ask the father to give you the holy ghost and if you know that there's nothing in your life that you're refusing him on you can expect to receive the holy ghost and don't make him an evil father don't say i prayed and prayed but he wouldn't i prayed and prayed but he won't don't you dare do that to him because he's promised to give you the gift of the holy ghost if you obey him i wonder if sometimes the problem is not in our receiving because it didn't come the way we thought it should or we didn't come in the dynamics that it came for somebody else and i didn't i didn't have it according to my own mental conception of what i was going to receive and so god has been trying to give us the gift that he's promised but we won't receive the gift because it's not coming the way we thought or was taught or however that it should come but i would say god i know by a revelation you're my heavenly father and i ask you to fill me with your holy spirit and i receive it in jesus name do however you want in my life just give me your spirit and then walk by faith and watch him change your life and the message the token brotherhood says in the holy ghost is our identification it's what identifies us as christians not our membership in churches not our understanding of the bible not how much you know about the bible it's how much you know about the author see how much the author is living in you it's yourself gone you're no more you reckon yourself dead and the token is what lives in you and it's not your life it's him see that's what we're asking for uh i i think also uh you know i hope this is okay because i'm just sharing from my heart when i started preaching on subjects like this i was telling my brother it's it's treacherous to me because there's so many angles on these things and you can take an angle and drive it too far so you've got somebody way out left field they're not even there anymore but i just want to i just want to just share from my heart amen when when we're seeking the holy ghost i think sometimes the wrong conception is that i'm seeking i just want to stamp you know i just want a stamp of approval and partially that's what it is it's the earnest statement it's the and the earnest of our inheritance i just want that stamp of approval amen brother branham comes and explains it so much more than just the the earnest just the stamp of approval he said it's actually a life it's not your life it's his life amen and that life will it's a seal that comes upon you and seals you to your destination absolutely but i think sometimes all we want is the seal or the guarantee or the stamp and it's not really the life that we're seeking after because what it really is is his life in you amen and you die to yourself and he comes alive in you and now it's not you anymore it's him in you amen and it's not a one-time thing it's in every moment of every day from then on i think sometimes what we're seeking was the stamp the approval the i've got it the ticket the seal amen because that was self-gain amen i've got the seal i've got the token i've got the holy ghost i'm secure i'm fine and we were looking for the baptism holy ghost to relieve our fears of not making a rapture or not being right or not being a christian and we weren't really seeking the right thing and so god because we weren't seeking the right thing god never let us have you know the that experience or sensation or the that thing that we were looking for he never let us have it because we were looking for the wrong thing we weren't looking for him we were looking for our security not his life we were looking for our benefit amen not his i hope you understand what i'm saying i hope it's coming across clear i'm not denouncing anything amen amen there's many many other ways that you can preach on this subject and they're still right amen i'm just sharing what my burden is to where god has me is that so what are we seeking after what do we want as children of god amen do we want uh do we want to seal to make us feel confident and secure and i'm fine and i can sit back and now as a lazy boy uh lounging around kind of christianity because i arrived i had a certain emotional experience that i'm labeling now as the holy ghost and everything's fine and i'm okay if that's all you want amen then you it's if that's all you want you don't want him yet but when you want him you're saying you know what it's more to me than just a stamp of approval it's more than a seal i want to lose my life and i want him amen i want him i want to be united with him i want to be married to him i want him to burn out everything in me that i hate all the thing that's rotten and crooked and not right i want it to go amen i don't want to just be able to say well i got the holy ghost i'm fine i'm going to heaven i want to say lord i'm not fine and i'll never be fine until you come in and burn out the old life and establish yourself in my heart i don't just wanna i i don't just wanna a security i want you and you're my only security and you're my only security when i walk with you every moment of every day every hour in my private life public life church life that's the only security i have is you in me not a certain altar experience or a certain manifestation or a certain thing amen all of those things go with it but they're not it remember bam said i don't believe a dry eyed confession and that's true but i don't always believe a wet-eyed repentance sometimes it's just emotional so they're both true does emotion go with it brother said emotion goes with it and there better be some emotion with a love relationship with christ there better be some life there better be some feeling there better be some sensations there better be something amen but it's not the sensation or any particular sensation and it's not the emotion those things go with it but what is it it's him it's his life amen it's my union with him that's what i want amen and i want it emotional i want it with feeling i want it but even if there's not feeling i still want him because the thing i want most is him so these things are just so uh such a burden for me that we see when you talk to people when you hear what individuals are seeking after and what they want it's like it's a misunderstanding well i want to know this and i want to know that i want to have this and i want to be sure of this and really the simplest thing to do is just fall in love with the lord give him your whole life surrender everything to him seek him with all of your heart when you when you seek him you shall find him knock and he shall open amen just don't stop seeking don't stop knocking don't stop surrendering amen and god amen he will take that heart amen he will fill it with his own life he will renovate he will renew he will recreate for the good amen completely change you your soul amen and he will live there and live his life through you that's what we're seeking after it's a new birth not a pass a new birth the new birth brings a pass but it's not just the past i want it's the new birth i want the the change brings earnest of an inheritance but it's not just the earnest i want it's the change i want you understand what i'm saying i hope this is hitting home i want to be changed and being changed will give me the earnest the down payment of my full inheritance but it's not just the earnest i want i want to be changed i don't want to be the same way i am i don't want my own life i don't want my own way i don't want my lust i don't want my desire i want to die to everything and i want him to live it's my greatest desire it's my great passion in life it's what i'm seeking after and if you seek him that way he'll be found amen you will find him when you seek him with all of your heart [Music] so many times i think we've been taught to look for something but not him and we're chasing after something but we should be chasing him and when we chase after him he'll bring everything not just to something but it's all there amen everything is there like brother branham said when you buy the shoe you get the tongue the tongue is not the shoe it just goes with it the gifts of the spirit go with it amen you can never have a true church without the gifts of the spirit in operation hey brother bam said they follow the true church always so you can't go to one side or the other amen you've got to go right down the middle you've got to have the gifts you've got to have a a relationship with feeling you've got to you've got to be connected to your lord amen you've got to feel your love for him but all of those things are what goes with it i keep reading here in the token the last thing i said is you reckon yourself dead and the token is what lives in you and it's not your life it's him paul said this life that i now live he lived a different life from what he once did it's not me but christ liveth in me there is the identified token that god required identified identification with our sacrifice the life of our savior in us the holy spirit oh what a positive token it's a positive token it's a short token it's his life and me there cannot be any more token oh my if you only could catch the thought of it if i had the power this morning with words to express and place in your soul that's on the not in your ears but your soul you could see the guarantee of it it takes it makes you so relaxed this is what this is what i want to say when brother branham preached the baptism holy ghost and the token amen he says when you have the token when you realize that something changed you you've been changed amen you're not the old person you were you're a new creation in christ jesus you can have the capacity to change you but something god himself came down amen and united with you and changed you and now it's not the life that you once lived it's a different life you're living now it's the life of christ and you love the word and you love him and you want the word and you don't want the world you don't want any evil something in you is totally shift brother branham says that's the token that he's looking for your life is gone and his life is living in you he said you see the guarantee of it it makes you so relaxed ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of your redemption it's a seal and that seal is a guarantee it's an earnest and it makes you so relaxed see when when you see the teaching on the baptism the holy ghost that makes everybody nervous and nobody relaxed it makes me nervous because there's got to be something that comes in a believer that they know they've met god they know something deep on the inside has shifted amen it wasn't a it wasn't i decided to quit lying and i decided to be nicer because i didn't like the consequences i was paying for my evil but something deeper than that it wasn't a reformation it was a transformation something on the inside shifted all my loves and almonds everything shifted and now what i want more than anything is i want god to be pleased with me amen and that should bring a rest because the holy ghost is rest when we entered into the holy ghost we've ceased from our own works we've entered in to rest amen amen we've entered into not me not my will not me it's him in me it's not the life i once lived but it's the life that he now lives in me and the token again brother says now how many knows that he never changes his ways he never does now look through the bible and see if he ever changed it no sir how did he prepare the people first he sent a prophet with a sign which was moses is that right and the sign had a message a message to get ready they were going out to the land that was promised then he had he had identification of this prophet that is a light was over top of him a pillar of fire followed his prophet do you think brother branham's only talking about exodus he's trying to point you to his day amen to what was going on present tense and then he also had a light identification a light over the top of him a pillar of fire followed this prophet we know that went through the wilderness with moses we realized that and then he gave them a token for the assurance that they wouldn't have to be scared all upset and nervous so moses gave them a token so that they wouldn't have to be upset all upset and nervous that they would have assurance amen so they wouldn't be scared all upset and nervous amen so so praise god i say god has a token for his people today an assurance so that we wouldn't be scared all upset and nervous how many wants that token amen that's what we want that's the life that we want when i see the token i'll pass over you watch how he did now he prepared first to sign a messenger identified message identification of the message and a token for the assurance that the way was paid they are headed for the promised land the same thing he has done today what did he do he sent us the holy ghost the holy ghost is the messenger and the scriptural identification of himself identifies him among us the same yesterday today and forever and the token is the assurance what are you scared about our fair is already paid and we are identified with our sacrifice he can't turn you down he promised that we are identified how are we identified because he changed us amen because he changed us amen i'm going to read another quote here from the token he said the blood is not the token now the life is the token so i want to just take a minute and brother branham when he's preaching the token he's not re-preaching the baptism of the holy ghost and i hope by the time we're done with this you'll understand what i'm saying it's not like i'm trying to separate the two two but when brother branham's preaching the token amen he said this toke this message couldn't be preached until now but they were preaching the baptism of the holy ghost before but he said this message this token it couldn't he said it couldn't be preached to now he said it couldn't come in existence until the evening time so brother branham is preaching in the token amen something that could only uh something that can only exist in the bright age [Music] and that token amen is the evidence the token is the security the token is the assurance the token is the evidence that the blood has been paid and been applied to you and that that you've been redeemed amen the token is the evidence of that and so he goes back and we'll just review this he goes back into the exodus journey and he shows how god sent a prophet and he gave a sign of a pillar of fire and he showed the signs of a prophet amen and then and then the prophet was going to give them a token and that token was going to be a covering of blood amen there's going to be a innocent one that's going to be sacrificed it's going to pay the price of substitution amen but you had to take the blood of the lamb that was slain and the blood had to be applied on the outside of your door so that when the death angel passed if he saw the blood he would pass over you and brother branham is basing the token message on this amen out of exodus in the exodus journey then he's showing that the token amen couldn't just be the fact that you believe in the blood the token wasn't believing in the lamb you could believe in the lamb you can believe in jesus christ your savior you can believe in the blood as the price for redemption you can believe that but he says you could believe moses amen you could slay a lamb you could put the blood in the bucket and you can say that's the right blood and that's the right lamb and this is what moses said but if the blood is not applied to the outside of the house amen the death angel won't pass amen the covenant was null and void and brother is bringing us to this day he said we've come to a day amen where it's not just believing the lamb that was slain not just believing in the blood but the blood applied and this is the day amen for the token to be not the blood not the chemistry of the blood not the chemicals that made up the blood not the red substance that was on the cross but the life that was in that substance now is the token and when that life comes into you and changes your life that's the token that what the blood that was shed at calvary has been applied to you and you're redeemed and we've come to the age amen of the token the token time the token age in the bright age so when brother branham is preaching the token we have to understand he's not going back and repreaching what was preached in the pentecostal revival he's taking what was preached then and he's bringing it all up and he's saying now all of this comes to a token amen and the token is the life that was in the blood the life of the sacrifice he said back then it was a chemistry of the blood they actually had to see the red paint over the door because the life that was in that lamb could not come back on the worshipers so they had to have an evidence amen that a lamb would died for them amen but now you have to have evidence that a lamb has died for you in this day you have to have evidence that a lamb has died for you and the lamb is not the chemical of the red amen of the blood but the evidence and now is the life that was in that lamb because now it was a man who died not an animal amen and that life can now come back upon the worshipper and it's his life in you is the token [Music] now i go to a certain church and i believe a certain thing and i and i repeat a certain thing and it's his life in you not i had a certain uh certain kind of experience or a certain type of sensation it's his life and you as the token that's the token so i repeat this the blood is not the token now the life is the token the life could not be there because it was an animal the chemistry was the token you'd have to have literal blood applied on the door but now it's the holy spirit we're coming to it just in a moment to prove that see it's the life that is the token your life has gone and you're dead and your life is dead and you are hidden god through christ and sealed in there by the holy spirit the mind that was in christ is in you in christ and the bible and the word is the same in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god then you and the word and god and christ are the same and if you abide in me and my word in you ask what you will it'll be done praise god so many things i want to say we've come to a day now listen brother venom i'll read the quote just in a minute but brother branham is telling us the token couldn't be applied till the evening time it couldn't be applied till now something has changed to where now the what was not available before is available now the literal life of jesus christ not a portion not a dip but the whole thing's come back and you say how does the whole thing come back amen because god brought a prophet on the scene to restore back the word amen and the word is spirit and life so sometimes it's it's what we're looking for and where we're looking for it that is sometimes the problem because brother branham came in a ministry brother branham's ministry was evidence of the token because what is the token it's the life of jesus christ and brother branham's ministry was evidence that the token is here and how many times did brother venom go to the plains of memory and show abraham and sarah in the tent and an elohim coming in flesh of a man eating eating the drinking the milk and eating the flesh of a calf you know and he shows that was elohim and stepped into a body of flesh and sarah was in the tent behind him and he could tell what sarah was thinking in her heart in the tent behind him amen and he be called it out how many times did brother brenham go through that story and then demonstrate the same thing by turning us back to the crowd and calling out people the thoughts of their hearts and what he was showing us is he was not just showing us that i have a gift that's not what he was showing he's not saying i have a gift he's saying elohim is here christ is here god is here it's showing that we've come to the place where god has stepped down in flesh to show himself to you to fulfill the promise to abraham's seed amen because why did elohim take on flesh he didn't come down and take on flesh to do a sign before abraham to say hey guess what abraham i'm elohim and i've got a gift he came down and did that so that he can confirm the promise to abraham the point of the visitation was not elohim in flesh the point of the visitation was confirming the promise to abraham and so brother branham would come and show the sign of the messiah so the elohim is here in flesh and it wasn't so that you could say elohim is here in flesh is so that you would know that now is the time for the confirmation of the promise to abraham and to abraham seed so it all depends on what you're looking at what you see in all these events brother man comes down and he says he starts showing us the sign of the messiah showing that the messiah is here the messiah how many believe that brother ben proved that the messiah was present that it was the return of jesus christ he was working through that ministry through it was a prophet a son of man revealing the son of man we believe that but then you have to ask yourselves well if i want to unite with that christ can i run like mary magdalene and grab him at his feet can i can i where where can i dump the the the fragrant oil that i've been saving for him where can i wash his feet how if christ is here how can i do him a service how can i kiss his feet how can i bow before him and worship if christ is here how can i embrace him how can i unite with him how can i find him and brother benham showed that when christ came it was the return of the word amen because he is the word and the word is god and christ is the manifestation of the word and when the word came back to the church it was christ coming back to the church and he went into a man to show the sign of the messiah so that he could confirm the promise for the day amen to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen and restore the word that had been lost and now what do i embrace to embrace christ what do i unite with what do i wash with my tears what feet do i kiss it's the word amen i embrace the word amen i unite with the word amen i worship amen according to the word amen i received the word so christ has come where is he where do i find him he's the word he's the word that's amen he's the word that's presented to you amen every time you come to church he's the word that is on your device when you listen to the message when you read your book that's him amen he has come back amen he's come back as the word and i want to unite with christ and i want to embrace christ then you must embrace him as the word for this day amen the word of the age it brings the life it brings the token life and you know we we've been taught sometimes to to seek sensations but like i said before really we need to seek him how do i seek him he's the word that's been restored in this day what do i run to i'm gonna i'm gonna make a statement just from my heart but i don't mean anything ill about it you guys know me well enough to understand what i'm saying and take it into context some people have sought christ at an altar and not found him because he's not an altar he's the word there's nothing wrong with the altar as long as you come to the altar and repent and unite with the word i hope you understand what i'm saying i don't mean anything i don't mean anything derogatory but some people come and they they were seeking him in a prayer line but he's not a prayer line he's the word made manifest in this day he's the word for this age now the prayer line many people have got a new birth and a prayer line a new birth at an altar because they came to unite with the word in that prayer line they came to surrender their life they came to give up themselves and unite with christ they were coming to the word they were recognizing it didn't it wasn't the prayer line that gave me the holy ghost and it wasn't the altar that gave me the holy ghost it was uniting with christ see it's the approach it's the attitude it's what we're looking for if if you go to the altar i mean go to the altar to unite with him amen to receive the word for your day to repent for your rejection to lay down your life to repent for your selfishness and say god i surrender to you i surrender to all that word i want all of it i want to believe it all i want to live it all i want to act on all of it so there's nothing wrong i hope you don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with an altar call there's nothing wrong with the prayer line there's nothing wrong with those things what's wrong is the person's attitude when they approach it if we come with the wrong attitude that's why we come down and pray and leave with nothing because we were looking for something we were looking for something that wasn't at the altar it's not at the altar the altar is just where you die the altar can be in your heart in your home in your car it can be right here at the front of the pulpit the altar is where you die but it's not that he's standing at an altar he's standing in a prayer line he's here the revealed word he's all around you he's the message of the hour this message is christ and we come and we die to ourselves to embrace him and he is revealed in the message of the hour it's important that we understand what it is we want and what it is we're looking for because if we look for the wrong thing we'll never find the right thing looking the wrong place i want him i want him so i want i want christ so i've got to find him and but he's in the word he is the word we make it so complicated that we want to find him in a special series of meetings or a special ministry or a special church or a special place or a special location when we have the word we all have the word amen if you really love him amen you really want to unite with him then you die just that word get into the word because when you get into the word you're getting into christ when you embrace the word you're embracing christ when you obey the word you're obeying christ it's so simple we just run right over top of it and wonder why we've never got the thing that we're seeking after and because we're seeking after the wrong thing we have to seek after him brother says in the token again he says and we can display the token of the holy spirit shows that we have been accepted in christ and that is our token that all that we have need is already purchased by him we are identified with our token the token must be ready the blood and covenant blood is not recognized without the token the word assures us of the promise the token is the sign that the purchase has been made for us full obedience to the full word of god entitled us to the token this is a good statement but i want to explain the statement full obedience to the full word of god entitles us to the token no other way is there that you would ever be entitled to the token until you fully obey the word not what somebody has put in it and added to it but what god said about it this is what brother branham is getting to and he's taking this out of acts chapter 5 verse 32 it says and we are witnesses of these things and so also is the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him that's what brother branham is referring to but when brother graham says obey if we take an old understanding we can go back and say oh no i've got to get everything right and i got to fully obey all the word and when i got my life right and everything's right then don't fill me with the holy ghost that's not what brother branham's saying now what he's really saying is when you fully surrender to the message of the hour if i can just if i can just nail it down and simple without showing a dozen quotes to prove that to you what he's showing is when you finally surrender all your false understanding all your ideas amen all your wants and all your desires and you finally surrender to the message that was preached through the prophet of the day and say that's the truth and everything else is a lie and everything in me i want to obey that word that is what he's talking about not a creed not a doctrine of man not anything else but we've come back to christ the word amen in full measure with the full revelation by divine vindication when we come back to that and not just say it's true amen brother ben says you can say the message is true that's no more than being able to read that's not it yet you can say well that message is true and that man was a prophet but it's when you say i want to be fully aligned with that word amen it's so true everything else is wrong my opinion is wrong my desires are wrong everything's wrong and i want nothing but that word alive in me that's full obedience to the full word of god it's not about getting every conduct right amen it's an attitude it's an approach amen it's an understanding of what's been given us in this day that word is christ amen how can i want christ to dwell in me when i will not even surrender to christ the message of the hour that was preached through a prophet when he says women don't cut your hair and i cut my hair and don't wear makeup i wear makeup amen those things seem like simple things but they're huge in the eyes of god because it shows where your heart is amen because when you start to ask well what does it matter and why and how long is long and all these questions all you're doing is saying i want you but i want you as long as i can have some of me that's the real problem the real problem with the question is how long is long amen is not the question how long is long and because the holy ghost will reveal to you how long is long the real question is is how much of myself can i bring into this relationship so we think like these seem like trivial issues why is it trivial when brother branham preached it all through 63 64-65 because he's showing you want christ but you want christ according the way cain wanted christ according to his own will amen but you don't come to this word trying to hold on to your own idea amen your own desires and your own will but you come to this word not legalistically like if i don't cover my hair and don't wear makeup he'll give me the holy ghost that's not what he's talking about he's talking about a full surrender to the full word of god an absolute acknowledgement of who is here who is present amen it's not a message of brother branham this is jesus christ amen and if it's just brother branham's message it's subject to my opinions and my alterings and my [Music] see the whole problem with with dress and attitude and conduct and dirty jokes and and watching worldly movies and all that stuff it isn't friends it has nothing to do with that it's not like if i can cut out all the worldly movies and wear my hair right and dress right i'm going to get the holy ghost that's not it but it displays your attitude towards jesus christ i hope that strikes home because we've made it too much about the hair and about the makeup and about the movies and about that it's not about that it's about your heart and no condition to receive him until you hate it all amen until you're willing to give it all up amen i hate amen i hate any desire that i have that's contrary to the word i hate it amen i want it going i want it washed out of me because all i want this word is so beautiful it's so magnificent this message is so perfect that's the only thing that i want and i want everything else to go away [Music] you may not yet have the strength or the capacity to make it go away but there sure ought to be a desire not not ought to be there must be a desire in you amen for all of it to be gone and just that word to live in me that's coming with the right approach that's the right attitude amen that's the right desire and when you come to god that way all you have to do is ask for your father for the holy spirit and he'll give it to you full obedience to the full word of god amen it is not check boxes on a list check check check check check all right god i'm here in line for the holy ghost and your heart still is black as coal full of lust and selfish desire and self-will but because you have a strong willpower and a strong constitution and a lot of self-regulation you're able because there's different personality types that's why legalistic churches abound because they attract people who like rules and they like having rules i like having rules and it's it because people with a strong constitution an ability to self-regulate and a strong will can come and check all the boxes and still have a dirty heart but believe that they're in the message and they're a message believer and that they have the token [Music] now i believe all the boxes should be checked don't get me wrong i like the rules but don't be deceived by the ability to obey amen a certain doctrine that you've got the holy ghost amen it's a change inside in your heart deep down on the inside not outside deep down on the inside that will reflect on the outside and that life will check all the boxes not your life checking all the bugs we get the cart before the horse you realize full obedience full surrender to the full word of god entitles you to the token when you go on your altar of your heart and you sacrifice yourself and you say lord i don't want nothing i'm not asking for anything i don't want gifts i don't want abilities i don't want recognition of man i'm not asking you to make me a preacher i'm not asking you to give me tongues i'm not asking you any vision i'm not asking for anything all i want is you and this word that i see is beautiful and i love it and i want to be connected with it that's the right approach and all these other things just go with it praise be to god i realize that this preaching is quite different but it's the truth and it's what the prophet taught us and i realized somebody can take one aspect of what said and they can pick it apart but you guys know me and i love you and you love me and you know the spirit that i'm bringing it in that it's got to be about him and no longer about me the problem in the church is it's always been about the church the problem through denominations has always been about it's been a believer-focused faith instead of a christ-focused faith and that's the problem in you and i that's the problem in this church that's the problem in every church is when it's a believer-focused faith and a believer-focused walk amen we're never going to get where we need to get and we'll constantly be frustrated feeling like we have a heavenly father who doesn't give us what i asked for because we're focusing on our own wants and our own desires but to get where we need to get with god there has to be a death to self and it's got to be a christ-focused faith and say christ is that word and that word that that prophet bought is right and everything else is wrong and i believe it and i want it and i will obey it and the part in me that i can't make obey it i'm going to ask him to give me something that i can obey that word because that's my desire to obey that word because that word is more than a doctrine of the church that word is more than a teaching of the seventh church age messenger that word is jesus christ made and manifest that is my bridegroom the revealed word that is who i've been introduced to that is who the bride has been united to in this area that is who we are embracing that is whose feet we're washing with our tears and if we focus that way we'll get exactly what god promised that we'll get when we recognize him when we come to him brother brahm says in the token again and if the life of jesus christ lives in the person they become identified with him it's christ in you not a church member not a system but a resurrected power it's the holy ghost as a token upon you that your life says amen to every scripture listen he didn't say your mouth says amen he said your life says amen that's the token friends it's the life of jesus christ took over your life and it's a power that you didn't have before but now you have and the power is the power to live a christian life a power to overcome the temptations you couldn't overcome before a power to overcome lust you couldn't overcome before it is a power that has come into the church to make you a witness of jesus christ praise be to god you see he says your life the holy ghost is a token upon you that your life says amen to every scripture the promise is written in there and you are not yourself no more you are christ you don't think your thoughts you don't think your thoughts you say i think you have no thought coming the life that was in christ is in you the mind that was in christ is in you the works that was in christ is in you and christ himself is in you you're dead and your life is hidden god through christ sealed in there by the holy ghost you're not your own if you look at and i want to i i want to keep teaching i don't want to get off and i get off on rants sometimes but i want to keep bringing it back to my where my heart is you look at peter before he he had the baptism of the holy ghost peter believed that jesus christ was the messiah he believed that he was the son of god he saw him in the resurrection he believed he was called of the lord but he still was afraid and he was intimidated by the jews and he didn't know what to do next and he had no power to live that bold life amen to proclaim the gospel amen until the baptism holy ghost came until the life that was in christ come in him and now it changed peter peter believed but it changed peter and now peter could go into action on what he believed peter runs out on the day of pentecost and he begins to preach and what is he preaching he's preaching the modern fulfillment of the old testament prophecies he's preaching modern events made clear by prophecy he's preaching the manifested word for our day he's preaching he's preaching the word and so in that peter as a transformation and now before peter is jocking for position peter wants christ to bring in the kingdom peter wants to sit at his right hand peter wants to be one of the greatest amongst the disciples amen peter when jesus says that you know the son of man is going to be evenly mistreated and crucified and rise again the third day peter doesn't want that because that doesn't match peter's desire and it's not that peter so much loved the lord he didn't want the lord to die is peter so much loved peter that he wanted the lord to become king so that he could be part of the government human nature 101 it wasn't the love for the lord that was motivating peter it was the love for himself but after his conversion amen after peter filmed peter's repentance and peter's conversion then peter comes out and now it doesn't matter if they beat him threaten him prison him he's going to preach the gospel because he's really in love with the lord jesus christ not himself so much so that when he gets to the end of his life he says don't even crucify me the same way my lord was crucified but turn me upside down why because he he became nothing and christ became everything but even through peter's change peter changed you know we know what his temperament was before we know the boldness god gave him the humility he gave him afterwards but even yet when he's in antioch with the saints feasting and joining in with the gentiles when james sends a company of jews down what does peter do peter reverts back to some of his old ways and some of his old thinking amen and to save face with the jews he separates himself from the gentiles and won't eat with the gentiles but eat with the jews and god had a mouthpiece on the earth and the apostle paul and paul was stood into his face and told him he was wrong and before there would have been a huge fight but see what i want to show you is that peter peter was still subject to some peter stuff he still lived in the outer shell of peter but the inside of peter had changed so the inside of us has changed we still may have some outer shell things that we deal with amen and they were susceptible to peter was still susceptible to wanting to look good in the jews and worried about persecution or questioning from them for eating with the gentiles so he just separated from the gentiles amen so he didn't have to deal with all of this and paul was studying to the face that you are wrong amen instead of instead of smiting paul and chastising paul and saying paul's a false witness he just surrenders and he and he and he submits himself to what paul said why because he was converted because he had the holy ghost and what paul said was right anyway later went on to acknowledge that paul had the truth and what paul taught was right he didn't start a battle for the rest of their lives and contention amen peter was able to humble himself when he couldn't humble himself before but there's something inside in the core of peter that's different and although peter can be susceptible to the sticky cultivar nature amen there's something in him when faced with truth he'll always surrender self and take the truth [Applause] so we can preach the baptism the holy ghost in such a way and read quotes in such a way that you think that all you have to do that if you ever live any other life amen than a perfect life then you don't have it no it's not living a perfect life it's a perfect surrender to the life that's in you you may do something wrong you know brother branham told a lie he had his wife tell a lie and you know you may we may debate you know he had his wife to lie he didn't actually tell it but the holy spirit said why did you lie the holy ghost said you lied he lied what was it he was subject to the outer shell amen but when he was faced with truth when the holy ghost said why did you lie there was a there was a conversion on the inside that says lord i'm sorry amen i'm sorry that's the truth why because he was converted because he had the token on display the token is the life of jesus christ peter separating from the jews was not the life of jesus christ peter repenting in the face of the word was the life of jesus christ surrendering to the word brother branham telling a lie to the lawyer was not the life of jesus christ but brother branham being able to hear from the holy spirit in correction and surrender to the correction was the life of the holy spirit amen i'm so thankful that god has given us the truth let's go to first john 4. first john chapter 4. we'll start with verse 1. beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world john is talking about he that is in you brother branham says in the message he that is in you he says now i would like to read first john 4 4 and he reads the scripture and he gets down to the verse that says year of god little children and have overcome them he says talking of the antichrist you have god little children and if you have overcome the antichrist which antichrist the one that is contrary to the word because the word is christ which antichrist the one that's with you the one that talks to you the one that's surrounding you the one that's all around how can you overcome that antichrist spirit antichrist is against the word greater see that is in you than he i'm sorry year of god little children have overcome them talking of the antichrist because greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world two pronouns see he personal pronoun he that is in the world and he that is in you he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world there's an antichrist spirit in this world and that antichrist spirit is constantly trying to influence your outer shell your carnal man but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world the overcomer is on the inside it's not how strong you are it's not how bright you are it's he that's overcoming in you that's why we don't have to fear we don't to fear because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world by the new birth that plants him inside me and now he is in me conquering everything else around me brother bam said in the message i have heard but now i see i want to start talking more about this token in token time we've talked about the batch of the holy ghost we started talking about the token but brother bam is going to start showing us there was a time for the token to come on display there was a specific time that the token was going to be on display and he says and we are now we are not living in luther's age wesley age or the pentecostal age now listen what he says the pentecostal age was only a restoration of the gifts coming back to the church this is important to note because brother brown will he'll go through justification baptism holy ghost and he starts talking about these things but brother barron is clearly showing us that the baptism of the holy ghost amen in the pentecostal revival was a restoration of the gifts back into the church and when we get to where we are now we're not going back to that this is something different than that the pentecostal age was only a restoration of the gifts come back to the church but we're living in the evening time we're living in a time of the calling out of the bride brother brahman explains this in resume of the ages in the church age book he says now as as this concluding chapter was given in order to trace the two churches and two spirits from pentecost to their consummation we will take this final time to show this in the laodicean age so he's just going to show it in the laodicean age so the age started just after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at pentecost what was what was supposed to happen at laosei the true church it says it was it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at at pentecost we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power the believers sensed this in their spirit and began crying to god for a new outpouring such as was in the first century this is so important he's saying we're coming to legacy in church we're coming to a time the true church must turn back to being the bride she was at the original pentecost and because of this they sensed that they needed a dynamic outpouring like at the beginning and all of that was correct there need to be a dynamic outpouring to return to give her the power to return back to being the bride and be they begin to cry out for an outpouring and this one he said what seemed to be the answer not the answer but what seemed to be the answer for the dynamic power that the church needed to turn back to being the bride what seemed to be the power but was not it what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the spirit it was then that it was then believed that this was indeed the long-awaited restoration it was not that is why we've got to go from pentecost from the pentecostal revival to this now to the token amen because that really wasn't what they thought it was but there had to be a dynamic power that would come to make the bride go back to being what she was it wasn't that amen that was the baptism of the holy ghost unto the restoration of gifts but now there is a baptism of the holy ghost unto the token life and that is the dynamic power that takes the bride back to what she was at beginning amen it was didn't believe that this was indeed the long way to restoration it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain the latter rain then is the harvest ring how could this be the real thing when the teaching ring had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and final quickening into the rapture had not come in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessings and manifesting in the holy ghost as we kept pointing out to you and it also was devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not the real these people even before a second generation had appeared organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did there's a reason that i say this because what looked like the baptism holy ghost that would be the injection of dynamic power that would take the bride back to what she was it was not what took place on azusa street what took place on azusa street was the baptism of the holy ghost unto the restoration of gifts i hope that you understand clearly what i'm saying and that won't work to bring the bride back to where she was in the beginning there must be something else another dynamic outpouring that would be poured out in the latter rain or the harvest rain that would come after the teaching reign after the prophet tied all the loose ends together then he would open the seals and show the mystery of god then there would be an outpouring of the latter rain that would be the dynamic power that would take the church back to what she was at pentecost that's why we cannot go back to a pentecostal revival experience of the baptism in the holy ghost we must keep moving forward to what god actually sent to us to be the power to bring the bride back to what she was and what did he bring amen he bring the revelation that was contained under the seals he brought the word back he brought the mystery of god that is unfolded would bring the life of christ back amen the holy ghost that was bound up has come back into the church in full measure with full power with the full dynamic power of the full baptism of the holy ghost to bring the church back to what it was at pentecost and that's why we cannot bring pentecostal revival teaching into this amen because we'll get it wrong amen because that wasn't it it looked like it but that wasn't it that was the restoration of the gifts amen but then come the restoration of the word that brought back the full life of jesus christ and that is the dynamic power that will take the bride back to what she was at penny so all of those ideas now there was nothing wrong with the pentecostal revival it was correct there was genuine seed and a genuine move of god that was correct amen but it must move on to further light so there's no condemnation to 1906. hey if i was alive in 1906 because i'm a seed of god i would have been in azusa street it was correct it was right it was of god but it wasn't what they thought it was that's why this is token time after that time comes token time brother says the lamb was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 14 days and then the lamb was killed and the blood was applied in the evening time you get it the token never come into existence until the evening time this is so important the token never come into but they had the baptism the holy ghost and brother baby said they had the baptism holy ghost but the token never come into existence until the evening time so what is the token it's what they couldn't have before even under a baptism of the holy ghost because under that they still had false understanding of false doctrine and didn't know the mystery of god so there couldn't be the full life which is the token which is the life of jesus christ what was back there was still a portion but to have the token it's got to be the full word that's why this is token time and it couldn't be token time till the evening time and this is the evening time of the age that we live in this is the evening time for the church this is the evening time for me this is the evening time of my message i'm dying i'm going i'm moving out in the evening time of the gospel and we've come up through justification and so forth but this is the time that the token has to be applied i'm going to read several quotes to show brother brad i'm teaching this and the feast of trumpets he says the holy spirit has been bound by these denominational rivers for almost 2 000 years so was it the fullness of the holy ghost no it was bound you can only have the fullness of the holy ghost after it's unbound it's been bound by these denominational rivers for almost two thousand years but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the holy spirit back in the church again what taking the church back to what it was at pentecost the holy spirit back in the church again christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said he promised it there was three stages of it as i said the martyr's age of the martyr for it then the stage of the reformers and the stage of the reformers went all the way through the pentecostal revival that was the last stage of the reformation was the pentecostal revival so from the martyr's age and to the dark ages coming out of the dark ages was the reformers age uh uh luther wesley pentecost and now the calling out time so we're in a different time when finished at laodicean age according to revelation 10 the mystery of all the bible would be known to the bride is that right revelation 10 listen now the bride called out by the word the bride called out by what the word christ himself calling out the bride making plain hebrews 13 8 that he's the same yesterday today and forever does the same is the same this bride was not going to be called out amen she was going to be called out by the word which was christ himself calling out the bride you're united for christ with christ well how do i unite with him have you heard him calling you how's he calling you it's the message of the hour that's his voice calling to his bride it's the message that's on those tapes it's the message that came through that prophet that's the word that's christ the word for the day calling out his bride what's he calling you to he's calling you to a union so that you can display the token now i want to i want to jump over here and just read something for you because this is helpful to me when we see brother brennam's life brother brennan was a prophet a son of man revealing the son of man he was elohim coming flesh to reveal that he was bringing the promise of redemption to the seed of abraham he was the showing the sign of the messiah it was christ in him showing the sign of the messiah we understand that so he also was in inside of him within him was the the word made manifest for that day the first part of the word to come the full harvest maturity that seed that was within him came into harvest maturity and it was plucked up and waved over the people so he was a type of moses and and sometimes i think we get maybe a little bit discouraged watching brother branham's life thinking i don't have all the gifts he has i'm not doing what he's doing but brother graham told us you don't have to do what he does to have what he has you can have what he has without doing what he does and here he says in in 1964 and god's word calls for total separation from unbelief he said many people look at gifts in closing now people look at gifts and they think oh what a great thing and then they try to impersonate gifts you can't do that you can't make a penny be a dollar you can't make it be a dime see can't make it a nickel it's a penny but if you'll just recognize yourself as a penny and go with the rest of the chain see god can use you you might not be able to do all there wasn't everybody when god called israel out of egypt every one of them didn't have to do the same thing moses did but they believed it that's right they believed moses because they know that it was a sign of the hour and that god had proved that he had the word they didn't have to do what moses did to go to the promised land to be called out but they had to recognize who moses were and believe that what moses was doing was god and moses and we don't have to replicate brother branham's ministry we don't have to replicate his gifts amen are the gifts of the bride their gifts are all through the bride but they're divided severally as he wills brother branham had a collection of the gifts because he was showing the sign of the messiah he come as a prophet like unto moses he came amen to bring us in an exodus he came with gifts and manifestations he came as elohim and flesh he came as the messiah a son of man are the son of man working through a son of man so he displayed all the life of jesus christ and all the gifts but you don't have to replicate that to have what he has but you can't deny any of it and have what he has you can't call it false you can't reject it you can't say it's not true just like any other scripture you can't reject manifestations of the spirit you can't reject gifts of the spirit you can't reject any word and have him in you you've got to accept all the word brother mama says in a court trial he says you might not be able to do this we have one of them in one generation there was one moses none of the rest of them didn't have to turn dust in the fleas and so forth and water and the blood there was one moses the rest of them just believed what he said you don't have to replicate his gifts but you have to replicate his faith you have to believe the word you must believe all the word and i want to jump back to the token time he goes on i'm still trying to lay this foundation for the time that we're in so god's only provided a place of worship he says now you people that had that old shouting methodist mother and so forth that you wondered if she didn't speak in tongues she ain't going to be there that's a lie she was the same holy spirit that you have today the same holy spirit that you have today but it was in tassel form not restoration of the gifts see when they come to restoration of the gift they look back at the holy ghost and tassel form and said well they didn't have it because unless you have the guest amen you don't have it amen but he says she was the same holy ghost you've got today but in tassel form and it was the holy ghost in portion through looser and portioned through wesley and portioned through the restoration against but it's not in portion anymore he says but all seven days just eat the unleavened bread the word then back then that denominated they're dead their stalk they'd just be gathered and burned but the life's going right on through and what happened all the life that was in the stalk in the tassel in the shuck all winds up in the wheat what luther had i've got what wesley has i've got what the pentecostal revival have i got it all comes into the wheat all the life that was there comes into the wheat and the same holy ghost that brought luther brought wesley brought pentecost winds up in the bride at the resurrection it says back to token he says israel come through many things but it was evening time when the token was required and not in the morning not in the preparation the 14 days of keeping up the lamb israel knows something was coming so did luther know it so did wesley know it so did finney knox calvin know it this is it they knew there would come a time that the pillar of fire would return back to the church they know there would come a time that these things would happen but they didn't live to see it but they looked forward to it israel knew something was coming but it was in the evening time when the lamb's blood the token was placed on the door yet the lamb was already put up what brother bran was showing is they had already selected the sacrificial lamb they had already had the lamb in their possession amen they were going to have to slay the lamb and apply the blood in the evening time even though they already had the lamb he's trying to type this through the church ages he said it's been the lamb all the way through it was the lamb and luther's time it was the lamb in wesley's time but now is the token time that each house must be covered by the token he's saying this is a different time than any of the other previous church ages this is a different time they had the lamb they had a portion of the word they had a sacrificial lamb they had the lamb it was the lamb and luther's time it was the lamb in wesley's time and that was good enough in their time amen but there come a time that it couldn't be the lamb among them anymore it had to be the life of the lamb on the outside of the house and he says we've come to the same time where it's not good enough to say i've got some of the word and i've got part of the word and i've got what they had back there but you've got to have that life on display on the outside of your house the life of jesus christ now it's token time that each house must be covered by the token each house of god must be covered by the token all that's inside of it must be covered by the token and the house of god is the body of jesus christ and by one spirit we're all baptized in this token and become part of it that god said when i see the token displayed i'll pass over you what an hour that we now are living and blood identified identified the believer because the life had gone out could not come back so he had a chemistry he had to have like a pain a blood a chemistry that showed that life went from it and now the very spirit itself is the token the holy spirit itself is the token not the blood the blood was shed at calvary that's true but the blood as far as it went it is went back into the elements from which it came from the food that he lived on but you see inside that blood cell was a life that started that that started the blood cell to moving the chemistry had no life in itself and therefore it could not move but when the life come into the chemistry of the blood it formed a cell it formed its own cell then cell after cell then it became a man and that man was god emmanuel and flesh but when that life returned back the chemistry went to it but the token is the holy ghost upon the church that they see christ the token is not just saying that i believe in the sacrifice of jesus christ but the sacrifice of jesus christ has provided a life in this day not a partial life not a dip not what they had in previous days but it's provided something different because with the restoration of the word came the restoration of the life and now with the dynamic outpouring that come from the latter rain the church can go back to being what it was at pentecost brother branham says as noah moses and david reflected the coming of the perfect bridegroom this is a good quote think about that the old testament some of the patriarchs and prophets what they were showing they were showing that there was a perfect bridegroom coming moses was showing it but moses wasn't it david was showing it but david wasn't it as noah moses and david reflected the coming of his perfect bridegroom so has luther wesley and pentecost reflected the coming of a perfect bride they weren't it but they were showing it's coming amen luther was showing it's coming wesley was showing it's coming pentecost was not it but they were showing it's coming and now is time for the manifestation of the perfect bride amen how does she become perfect because she's been given a perfect word and she has a perfect surrender to a perfect word bringing the perfect life upon the bride and she believes she believes the word brother brahman says now in the masterpiece the life that was in the husk in the stalk and then the tassel and the husk all gathers into the seed and the life that was in the stalk went one went to make the other justification made away for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come right down in perf imperfection back to the word again to manifest itself when the holy ghost come when that holy ghost come back down in perfection how did it come it was the word again and that the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life that's why what we've been given in this day is just not another doctrine it's not just a higher rung on the ladder wesley had a higher rung than luther the pentecostal revival had a higher rung than wesley this is not a higher rung on the ladder this is the destination this was the purpose of the ladder this was the point and the point was to get the people back amen by our restoration of the word by the revealing of the mystery by the revelation of the union between christ and his the bride and the bridegroom to get the people to believe the full word of god and let the full life of god come to bring them back to what had fallen in the beginning we're not here just to be a perpetuation of another church age we're here to be the manifestation of jesus christ in bright form his life in his body which is you and i and that could not come till the seals were open that could not come till the till the the deception of denominationalism was washed away that could not come till man's ideas were left in ruin that could not come until the mysteries had been revealed but when all that's revealed we can see who we are and who he is and what the point of the whole story is then we can surrender to that and say god i don't want any of the past i don't want anything else i just want you living in me amen and he comes down into his church and lives his own life in you and i and that is the return back to what they had at pentecost not a certain manifestation not a certain gift not a certain thing but his life in you and i that's what he wants that's the token and this is token time brother bam says i want to read two more quotes before we close i just want to nail this down he said so will the church come through justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost restoration of the gifts it's amazing how often he puts that together and in your book it's in parentheses when brother many times when he says justification sanctification baptism he goes he says restoration in the gifts he doesn't want you to lose sight that it was really the restoration of the gifts but the true baptism holy ghost is when that full life comes that wasn't it that was a baptism that was the baptism of the holy ghost amen to the restoration of gifts but the baptism of the holy ghost now is his life in the church it says i'll read that again come through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost restoration of gifts right on into the formed image of christ christ is the bridegroom the church is the bride and the brightest part of the bridegroom it'll have to be a word church not a denominational church it'll be the word church the word that's been made known and by the vindicated word of god he was the word she has to be the word he was the perfect bridegroom which was the word made flesh all the prophecies that spoke of him all the all that the forerunners had showed that he would be all the patriarchs and prophets he was the fullness of that then the bride has to be the same thing all that the word said that a bride would be all that was spoken of the virgin all that was foreshadowed in the church ages now has to come into perfection and he had to be a perfect bridegroom by reflecting a perfect word the word how can she be the bridegroom until she gets the full word there could be no manifestation there could be no token time until the full word comes and when the full word comes now the full potential is here this is important because if we don't understand this we start waiting we start sitting around and waiting for another revival another happening another something special another something we can feel but the latter rain has been poured out friends let it pour into you amen the latter arrangement poured out the harvest rain to bring the wheat to full harvest maturity it has come it has poured out we have what we need he is here and he's looking for somebody that will embrace that word that will love him for who he is the revealed word of the hour we say we love him but we're making love to systems and churches and ministries we're making love to sensations and we're making love to gifts amen and they're proving that we don't love him because he's standing here ignored the revealed word of the hour he's the tape say man he's the message he's the word that's on those tapes he's the word that's in your bible he's the holy ghost that's here to connect with you and we want to make love to a minister to a church to a move to a sensation to a gift instead of coming to him picking up your bible and saying this is you my lord and i love you grabbing your message book and reading and saying this is you my lord i love you i want you you know there's a time that when eliezer come to get rebecca he came with gifts he came with 10 camels full of gifts he came with a lot of gifts eliezer had a lot of gifts and she had family that was there but she was being called out of her denominational family but he still gave the family gifts he gave them gifts and she got gifts too the bride gets gifts she was adorned she had gifts and then he took her on a ride but she wasn't riding that camel for the gifts she didn't believe eliezer and follow eleazar for the gifts the gifts just went with it she was riding on that camel to unite with isaac there was one purpose for her to leave there was one purpose for her to follow eleazar and that purpose was a man who was waiting in the field in the cool of the evening and when she come riding along amen she asked eleazar who is this in the field she says that's my lord and she jumped down off of that beast and she went running across the field and brother bam said they ran to each other embraced one another because it wasn't the gift she wanted it was isaac that she wanted it wasn't eliezer she wanted it wasn't the gifts that she wanted it was isaac that she wanted and there's a bride in this day that has had a visitation of lease or she's been given gifts she's been told wonderful things about isaac all along the journey i'm sure she was asking questions about isaac and eleazar he knew firsthand all about isaac and all about the father and all about the sun amen and he's sharing all this information and no doubt her heart burned within her as eliezer was talking about isaac but that heartburn that information could not satisfy the longing in her heart the longing in her heart was not satisfied by hearing lease or talk about isaac the longing in her heart was not satisfied with isaac's gifts amen the longing in her heart could only be satisfied when she jumped down off that camel and went running across that field and embraced isaac and isaac took him into her mother's tent and those two became one and then she found the satisfaction of her longing amen there's been too many girls that wanted gifts and one at eleazar and one all this stuff but there's a bride on this earth amen she'll get gifts absolutely she'll get revelations she'll get information but what she wants is him she'll be taken to the tent and she'll become one with him and then she'll have her own manifestation of his life in her that's what mary got that's what rebecca got eventually rebecca got the manifestation she got the life of isaac impregnated into her and then she began to change amen as that baby grew and now she had the manifestation of the life of isaac in her and that's what the bride has she's been impregnated with the word and she's bringing forth the promised son mary she was there there was a prophecy that gone out and it was waiting amen it was waiting for a time to be fulfilled but mary was there and mary gets uh invitatio she gets a visitation from an angel messenger and that visitation of an angel messenger is for one thing and one thing only it's for her impregnation so that she can bring forth the promise of the hour you know that angel messenger didn't come down and force anything he just gave his message and the message was a little strange it took her a minute she said well how would this be and he tells her how it would be and something in her could recognize that's true listen and what he told her was a most amazing piece of information this prophecy that's been through the bible for 700 years that isaiah gave that was all the way back in genesis chapter 3 you're going to be the one that brings it forth this was a little girl in nazareth a young woman in nazareth the most unlikely place the most unlikely person i mean you think you have doubts what about her doubts but yes she couldn't deny that something inside of her resonated at that messenger's voice when he said amen this is going to come upon you the holy ghost is going to overshadow you and the thing that will be in you amen will be emmanuel she said be it unto me according to your word and when when she went to elizabeth amen elizabeth began to prophesy elizabeth said these things shall be performed because she believed she had the capacity to believe and what was told her was performed unto her because she believed and guess what she had an experience but she had an experience without a sensation because brother benham said if you would have had a sensation what would you have god doing but she had an experience and that experience changed her and after a while she had evidence of the change oh don't you love the word of god friends you're right there you're right in the bibles your life has been written there it's been written and rebecca has been written in mary it's been written in all of them amen and your experience is already written there so that the devil can't come down and and and mess with your mind and get you distracted in old pentecostal ideas you can look at the word it says i had the same experience mary had i've had the same experience rebecca had amen i've been changed amen and now within me is the evidence it's not me it's christ in me it's changing me it's manifesting in ways i never dreamed praise be to god he says in the third seal and the church comes out of the dark age justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost incarnate word the way now come through justification come to sanctification come through baptism holy ghost restoration of the gifts but what's the fourth state of life wheat back to what incarnate word what was jesus christ incarnate word the word was incarnated in him he was the word made flesh and god dwelt in him what's the bride she's been sanctified by the blood of jesus christ she's been washed by the word she's been purified by him so that he can unite with her and now that word that's been given to us we've been impregnated by it and now that word is bringing forth its own life we've received it friends we've received the message of the hour received our bride we've embraced him we've washed his feet with our tears we've anointed him with the most precious thing we have our whole life we've we've wiped his feet with our hair our consecration our nazarite vow to be separate from everything else we've embraced him we've loved him we've recognized him when he's talking to us and he has come to us and taken us into the tent impregnated us and now it's his life manifesting in us that's the token friends it's not a certificate of completion it's not a trophy of merit it's not something we've earned that we can sit back and relax and say i've arrived it's his life in you how do i get it brother chad surrender just surrender to him and ask the father and believe that he's your father and that you've obeyed his word you've obeyed this message and if he asks will he not give you good gifts will he not give the holy ghost to them that ask if you're seeking the right person the right way you're dying to yourself and you're all your love is him you're obeying the message of the hour and you're identifying that it's the truth and you're lining up to it as much as you can you're giving yourself over to it and you ask your father who you know is your father by revelation if you ask him for the holy ghost will he not give it to you will you not become impregnated by his life will you not now be the virgin carrying the life in this planet on this earth will it be the incarnate word in you yes will it be the token life living through you yes it'll be his life in you jesus christ in the formation of the bride we know that's true corporally we know that's true that it's jesus christ and the manifestation of his bride jesus christ and the formation of the bride jesus christ and bride form we know that's true right that's corporally we know that's true but individually it's got to be true to you it's got to be true for me it's got to be true for you as an individual this is no longer identification with the church this is identification with christ we're past the days of identification with the church our identification with the ministry amen we're even past the days of identification with eliezer but we're at the time of identification with christ and him alone and he is the word for this day it's his life living through us brother branham told us who was here but so many didn't believe him brother braham said he's here i can't do those things he looked at somebody and says you know he says you've got to this condition in that condition and the lord healed you he said who did that woman touch i'm 20 feet from here what he showed was somebody was touching the lord by faith and i say he can still be touched he's still here he's still on earth he's hearing his bride he's here is the manifested word for this day don't let him pass your way and go seek something else seek him embrace him love him and surrender your life to him let's all stand musicians if you come brother ben brother branham preached some interesting messages you can get a whole list of them together but i was just right before i came out i was just thinking about this subject i think brother venom says he preached the message who do you say this is i think that's still a viable question who do you say this is is this a doctrine this is the teaching of the seventh church age messenger is this the teaching of a pastor or is this christ he preached there is a man here who can turn on the light he's either here he's not here who's that man and what form is he in who do you say this is who he brother man's not talking about himself he's saying before he said who do you say this is it's not him he says it's not me i can't do those things i can't know that about you you can't touch me he said it's not me it's got to be him so there's a man here who can turn on the light who he wasn't the man behind the pulpit amen it was the man christ jesus who's here and i'd say there's still a man here who could turn on the light he preached the identified christ of all ages has he been identified to you or is he still in mystery for him and he preached who is this milk is a dick not who was that milk is a dick but who is this melchizedek because the melchizedek high priesthood has come down he's here friends he's here in the revealed word of the hour he's here in his bride he's here to unite with you if you can just die out to everything else and just want him and him only don't look for any certain gift or any certain thing just love him and seek him and only him and die to yourself don't seek him for selfish reasons don't seek him to for any other reason but just because of him and he'll be found by you if you search for him with all of your heart man let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you for your word lord god i hope lord that you're able to take what was spoken lord i know it wasn't exactly in the same fashion as the revelation in my heart because there's a there's a an inability in humanity and an english language to bring a revelation perfectly through human lips and through english words but you who gave the revelation lord you can quicken it in the hearts of your children i pray that you would take these words that were broken up and these words that were spoken and that you would bring them into reality form in the hearts of your children god we realize that we're in a unique time a special time there's never been a time like this time it's not another age it's not another step this is the step lord this is not another time this is the union with christ this is you and your bride united together and lord that's what we want your prophet told us that it was the lamb all the way through but now it's token time it was luther and wesley and the baptism the holy ghost but now it's the incarnate word and god we can't do these things in ourselves we can't manifest this life on our own we can do nothing unless you come and do it in us lord as a body of believers we want to surrender ourselves now lord lord there's somebody out there that's been looking for the wrong thing if they've been looking for a sensation or looking for a token evidence in some flesh way if they've been looking for a church or looking for a ministry or looking for something god i pray that you would draw their attention to you now so that they would stop looking anywhere else for deliverance but they would look only at you and they would recognize you're the word that's been delivered in this hour you are the message of the hour i pray god that you would lord open the eyes i believe lord you're still a man that's here that can turn on the light and i pray this morning that you turn on the light for many of your children and may they unite with you lord and surrender to you may they ask you heavenly father to fill them with the spirit and i pray you'd fill them lord empowering them to live your life to live a christian life to be a witness for you i pray you take every false notion and wrong idea that's been ingrained in us that's been taught to us or that we've taught ourselves i pray that you've washed all of those away lord and let the truth of your word and this message take effect in our lives god lift us up on high lift us out of ourselves and out of the carnal and out of the world traditions and out of church traditions let us move lord beyond all of that into a perfect union with you lord may your may your wish be our command may may every move and nudge of the holy ghost be our pleasure lord to perform may you have preeminence in us absolute full control may we surrender all and just want you above everything else and lord may you manifest your life through us may the token be on display may the realization that you've changed us lord that you've quickened us bring us such comfort and such peace may it be to us such an earnest of our inheritance i'll let your token be on display let it be painted on the outside of the door so all that pass by can see that there's a lamb on the inside that we feasted on the lamb that we become one with it now we're living the life of the lamb god i pray you bless your people quicken the seeds that are out there then he quickened under this word bring them to life and bring them to manifestation god i love you i ask that you keep us as we go from here lord bless us in our fellowship as we return this evening for communion i pray you bless us in that as well in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you friends we'll come back at 3 30 for communion and feet washing been wonderful to be with you sing brother he is all i need he is all night jesus is all [Music] is one
