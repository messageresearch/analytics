get nervous but he asked me a few months ago if I would min and I just said without thinking yeah sure brother uh but that's just cuz we always want to help people we always want to be there for each other but yeah you get nervous thank you I appreciate that you can just chill out and sit down for a minute cuz I need to relax I appreciate you very much and I appreciate you playing the Lord's good um just want to say greetings from back home and they love you all very much and uh it's crazy cuz on Wednesday night I was minute preaching obviously and uh and I said well we'll be together on Sunday anyway you'll i' sort of kept it a secret that I was going to be here until I think brother Chad mentioned it at the communion service so nobody else would know and I was thankful and then uh brother Mike said to me sneakily we know who's ministering next Sunday okay that's fine I just want to say thank you um to brother Chad as well and brother Chad includes you all that you're so loving and so welcoming to us and uh we just pray that brother Chad has a time of rest it's um something that he you need now and again and for me I don't kind of have anybody else to sign a stand in for me so I don't get that break but I've got it now but I haven't got it now but it's all good the Lord's good just want to thank you as well from brother Mike sister Mar and sister Pon theard for your prayers and support you know during the time that we had that was a very trying time and they wanted to mention that I said Thank you personally and we're just so they were so touched as well I was preaching a couple of weeks ago on healing and healing comes in many different ways music love and all these things and and how you know I know for sister Mar and the cards that she's had on the mantle piece from from you guys and the love and the appreciation it really is something that helps us and helps that healing process the Lord's good you know we're all just kind of doing our bit you know for the Lord and um I'm I'm just a farm boy you know and I just wanted to farm and the Lord kind of yeah called me and it's not really what I chose to do in life and um um but it's what the Lord's got for me and if the Lord would ask us to do it again we'd do it again each one of us whatever sacrifice we have to make um I've just got a real simple thought this morning and I'm just praying that the Lord just gives it you know um I've got I'm I'm I'm not the cleverest fell I'm very simple and so I've got to write everything down CU I forget if you asked me I'm being serious if you asked me what I had for dinner yesterday I've got a really sit down and think about it and I've forgotten now there was potatoes there and there was some else steak that's right I'm I'm terrible memory I just can't help it so I've got to write it all down and you know the Lord took a few bloves and a few fishes and he fed a multitude and the Lord can take a few words this morning and my thoughts are everywhere Brother Kyle bless his heart where is he's up there somewhere he he came to there where is he there he is smiling face he came to put his arms around me and I said oh brother kle do you know I'm I'm being honest with you this the first time that I've ever had my thoughts everywhere you know I don't usually it just kind of all comes but the lord gave me this word that 3 weeks ago whatever it was and I was just really stressed out about what Lord what would you want but I was kind of driving this semi and I was busy that day and I was listening to the service and then brother Chad actually I was listening to while I was working and then the next morning nothing and I was really stressed out so I couldn't listen anymore I turned it off and because I'm just me I have to um prepare usually on Sunday mornings so I'm up at 5:00 and go and prepare so that's my Sunday morning because usually I've got to be work and I'm just so busy on Saturday so 5:00 in the morning I just sort of press play on the sermon that I would half finished and brother Chad I just cut sign there was just something he said I listened to 5 Seconds of what he said he was preaching on the twin within and he just spoke about the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil and suddenly you just kind of know it brother Kyle you said it you just kind and that's what the thought was and the thought became it started with a question a question where did the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil come from where's where's it come from you know many times I find um I find many answers many truth Revelation comes for me many times through questions so we have a question about something and that leads the thought to finding the truth so you know when I was a when I was a kid I'm still trying to calm down by the way when I was a kid we used to one thing you know I grew up pretty poor but um one thing that my dad is kind of a traveler um and we kind of traveled a lot as children that's the one thing that we did do we were poor but we traveled and you fly on the plane I'd love sitting there looking out the window and they back then there were the big old planes the big old big old things and massive wings and you know the be the big and you'd get in the big flaps you'd watch them flicking up and down do you remember that and you'd see them flicking up and you'd see all the Hydraulics and stuff and I was fascinated and well we came over on I mean you guys it's probably old for you guys but we came over one of these new sort of Dreamliner things and then I noticed that you got three huge Flags and there's one absolutely it's about 2 and 1/2t long and the whole airplane the whole time do were only using that little flap and you just it would move like I was sat there watching it it move like an inch and the whole thing would start moving and then and then we came into some turbulence and and that little they didn't start using the big ones no no no you like back 15 20 years ago you know when the message was we were all a little bit Pentecostal or whatever and you know how it is you you get the big guns in to do everything you'd always have the big people to come and sort things out and I know in Europe like you'd have the big preacher come around and sort all the wall small ones out and but this airlane it was just like this little flap M and the turbulence came and the plan started rocking around and that little flap just started flicking his finger and and he sorted the whole thing out it's awesome so I thought if the Lord can do that if if if that works in in natural then the Lord can just take a small little word and just just gently flick Us in the right direction and steer us the Lord is good you know these wings of the old Eagle it'll carry us home and if if the Lord just flicks that little wing and it just we'll be fine all is good so this question came where did the tree of life come from so hopefully I've calmed down so if we can open our Bibles please to Genesis 1:1 and we can stand for this one yes indeed hope you can understand me I haven't uh gone all American yet we were about I was this is going to embarrass Josh but we're about 15 minutes from home I said so Josh are you going to go all American he said no Dad I'm from Yorkshire I'm I'm I'm stay in Yorkshire last night he came back from where were they Columbus they'd been out with Riley and the boys Sam and he telling me so I so Josh what' you get me I got a t-shirt and some jeans I said you mean a t-shirt said no I got a t-shirt anyway it's all good Lord's good it's a little bit Babble on in it but all is well so I'd like to start if we can please let's just to read Genesis 1:1 but before we do like even just just to pray and then and then we'll read we pray before Lord Jesus we eat a meal Lord and we pray now before we're fed of your word Lord Jesus who are we to Stand Here Lord who are we lord who am I Lord the life I've lived Lord I loved you always Lord but I didn't live right Lord and Lord now you changed me you called me to this place Lord and I'm standing here Lord I'm not comfortable Lord Lord Jesus come down and just speak to us we pray bless my brother in Lord Jesus they here Lord Jesus please deliver the thought like you gave it to me Lord just encourage me I pray just encourage the people Lord Jesus bless your word now and open your words to us we pray we love you Lord amen so Genesis 1:1 says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth notice it says the heaven one Heaven and the Earth so you may be seated and you sit down we pray your blessing on the reading of the word so our title this morning for the thought for the sermon I don't claim to be a I don't claim to be a preacher and I don't know if brother Michael and sister Maran and so on I've ever actually noticed but I always start by saying my thought for this evening or the thought for this morning I don't like to say the title of the sermon because I'm honestly I'm not very I'm not a preacher but the thought is seed sewn trees grown and fruits shown brother Ben in here somewhere there he is and brother Ben is the the master of the subtitles so I'm going to give a subtitle roots and fruits I was kind of between it's pretty good the Lord is good oh yeah so uh we've just read Genesis 1:1 and it's in the beginning brother Franco I'm going to use this already if it's possible I'm uh I've got a whiteboard at home but I'm going to try this one again so we're going to I'd like to just do a little timeline here and here right time uh and time is going that way okay and it's very difficult to use this time's going that way so it's a timeline in theory and so so here we have here we have like a line of time and we're going to say zero zero here zero and this is really bad forgive me and this is now so this is now when we say zero I was laying in bed this morning and your thoughts start turning and I just thought well actually time when did time actually begin this is not total to side subject when did time begin well it says in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth well that must have been time or was it when God said um when the evening and the morning was the first day well that's like one day isn't that's time but if Adam and Adam which would be Eve but Adam and Adam his other half were actually living in the Garden of Eden in the morning in morning in the first day we don't know how long it went on but if there was a month if there was a year if there was two years of morning and first morning and evening was the day were they was the time well there was morning and there those was Day morning and evening but actually if there's no death then they were still in eternity if you know what I'm saying so this this time this zero that I've written here it's not something I can answer but I like to ask questions I always like to ask questions so where is this where does time begin well the reason I'm saying this is that it's like there's a there's a blending of time there's a blending of time going from eternity into time because although the evening the morning was the first day if you're not going to die then it doesn't matter how many days there is If the fall hadn't have happened for example we wouldn't be here we know that if the fall hadn't have happened then we would be on the 65 million and 31st morning and evening was the first was the whatever day see what I mean well now the reason I'm saying this the reason I'm bringing this little point is just just as a thought for you guys to think about later on it's like now in this church age where we are specific specifically now time is kind of blending again so at the beginning we get this kind of blending in that's it's it's kind of unsure where it started and we I would personally say well I don't know I just don't know where it started there's a blending but now we we're in Lea but we're not in Lea we're in the seventh Church age but we're in the bride age we are through the resurrection of Jesus Christ in our bodies we are now resurrected but we're dead we're dead yet we live yeah so there's this kind of blending that goes on now also and it's a nice blending so I'm going to put here just here and brother Franco explained to me I can move this somehow how do you do that brother Franco swi oh the screen gotcha yep yep and I've just said gotcha sorry sorry Josh so here I'm going to put here I'm going to put an earth and I'd like to draw an America there and a Europe there okay and I'm going to put over here I'm going to put the Moon and the Sun so yeah and we could even put Adam and Eve down here as well Adam and Eve which is this mate this is hard to do I'm drawing it looking up there but I'm it's all good cool so that's where we are now so we've read in the scriptures in the beginning God created heavens and earth and now here's another one for you this is the beginning but it's not the beginning see Genesis 1:1 is the beginning of creation okay so if we to go to the beginning am we've got to go to John 1:1 so let's turn to John 1:1 amen we're not going to get into that one we might do actually we'll see John one this is actually the beginning of the beginning this is Genesis 1 is the beginning of creation it's not the beginning so we're on John John 1 and we're going to read 1 to 3 so now he says in the beginning was the word yes and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things now listen this is the why we say it's not the beginning all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made listen All Things the Bible teaches us that all things were created through the Lord Jesus Christ so what it says in Genesis one in the beginning God created heavens and the Earth as soon as it said he created that means that that is not the beginning so we got to go to John 1 we what happened this is now the question you see where did the tree where did the tree of norig and good and evil came from this is a question that came so now we're going to swipe the um swipe the board and I'm going to pretend that this is like uh do you have gazillions here oh yeah you've got everything 60 gazillion I don't know how to spell that gazillion years okay and it's back this way okay cuz we don't know I'm not trying to be clever I don't know but now so so now I'm and I like I love this kind of infolding um the idea of listen and this is Simon now this is not um you know not word I I love the I love this thought in the beginning this is Simon now this is not this Simon yeah in the beginning we have this kind of infolding power which is God the word so and and in there is all these attributes that's got to come out but in there we have kind of the pillar of fire the cloud although it's not manifested yet it's still in there everything is in there so and so I like to draw I draw these little arrows and I always imagine the kind of the the Moses this is Simon I always imagine Moses with the with a burning bush that the Burning Bush was kind of it wasn't just a normal fire it was a fire that was kind of infolding on itself all the time like a and it's got just power power like raw power and that's how I personally like to think that in the beginning this is how it was there was a power there so it's not just kind of in the beginning was the word and the sign com sign a a Bible off way off in the distance no no no no because this this this book this this word now this was also in that thing in the infolding power but this is a written word this is a written words this is for us to read and uh we're thankful for that now everything that is in this written word that we have here was in the beginning so in the beginning was the word including this although not manifested yet and even in the scriptures as we read through the scriptures within the scriptures there is everything that God has ever happen everything that's ever happened is in here good and bad everything that's ever happened everything that's happening now and everything that ever will happen it's all it's all in this word it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen amen see so it's about it's not about a book being back there then it's about the word being back there and you know brother Chad brought out I think a couple of weeks ago I listened to a sermon I think I was on the plane or whatever and he's talking about the the God God uh what did he say he said the spirit God in Christ you remember he wrote it on the board I think it's all one it's all the word it's all it's infolding it's all there although it's not been manifested yet okay so now before anything has been um manifested God is now alone with his thoughts now God's thoughts are as real as we're standing here so it's not just some kind of thought bubble it is reality the thought of go if I build something then I think it out first if you like brother John I'll think it out first and I'll build the whole thing in my head and then I'll build it and but it's not a reality until it's done but with God it's it's a question when when was the blood of the lamb slain before the foundation world it was done so before actually we are here yeah the blood's already been slain how far back well we don't know but actually we do know cuz it's there amen back there when he was alone with his thoughts and his thoughts were real as okay so the seeds now the seeds of everything were in that being of life so we're looking at seed sewn trees grown fruits shown so the seeds sown the seeds of everything the seeds of this was in that back then and the seeds of you and me we were also back there just turn to Ephesians 1 Ephesians 1 we got a few scriptures Ephesians 1 we'll read 3:5 Ephesians 13:5 says Blessed Be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessing remember it says blessed past tense past tense blessed with all spiritual blessings in heaven places that's present tense in heaven places in Christ and that's both present tense okay verse four according as he hath chosen past tense chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestined and I like to say predestinated predestination makes it a bit more understandable for me anyway you to be predestinated is nice but if we have a predestination it's already Destin you know anyway predestinated unto us um the adoption of the children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so we can't remember it okay we cannot remember this but the Lord shown Us in his word that even back then even back then we were chosen in him in him before anything was created we were in the original seed of life okay we were in that original seed of life okay not manifested yet but we were there so the tree of life then and we'll see that later on the tree of life was in there Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the tree of life so so the tree of life began was way back then the tree of life because don't forget in the garden we got the two trees the tree of life and the the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil because all things were created by Him and for him we've just read it the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible teaches is is created by All Things by through the Lord Jesus Christ the tree of life he is the Tree of Life we'll see that later on as well you know when we read the quotes and that but we see the tree of life there's a tree of life Christ was back then so the origin of the Tree of Life Begins has no beginning amen the tree of life and he free iians 3:9 we won't read it in fact I'll read it for you quickly CU it's right here Ephesians 3:9 it says and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning that's this one we're talking about this is the this is the when he says from the beginning it's talking about this beginning yeah which from the beginning where's verse n beginning of of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ which wanted nail that one on the head because you know who created who did this that the Bible's fairly clear the Lord Jesus Christ did all things created all things that manifestation of God Called Jesus Christ the one our Lord and savior okay so the Lord Jesus Christ this in this here back here and I keep pointing down here but I'm saying there it is the it's the source of everything right it's the source of everything every everything that ever exists came from that back then right including the the seed of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil amen including the seed was created that seed of the knowledge of tree and good and evil was created back then for a purpose okay the Old Devil Lucifer was created I'm sorry amen and the seed was prepared it was a tool Lucifer the tool to bring out the attributes of God okay I've got I just want to the baptism of the Holy Ghost here brother Brown 1958 want to read something here says oh that's it yeah some people might struggle I mean even not us here obviously different places struggle to understand that Lucifer was created by God well if he wasn't then God was created by Lucifer there's got to be one you know what I mean doesn't work doesn't work okay so well you say then why did God the INF that God ever permit sin brother B says you know there's attributes in God and if God would have never permitted Satan he knew when he created Lucifer that he was to be the one to corrupt the world oh our God is not something little pushed off in the corner but he's an infinite God who never had a beginning and never will have an end and in him he is in his attributes he is a savior how could he ever be known as a savior if there hadn't been something to save how would we ever know so we see we know it already but we see the Lord created Lu Lucifer for a purpose amen and it was in the part it was it was in the plan of God you know the the seed that was planted back there called Lucifer it started notice it started as a seed this is the I hope you're going to catch my thought it's a it started as a seed I can actually maybe draw that in here somewhere yes I've uh I don't know how to delete brother Franco but it's all good right we're going to put here in here somewhere wrong turn it around quick right so I'm going to put here a little bit of grass and stuff and bit of soil you know it is who's a farmer in here boom Ron amen God bless you brother who else of course John gu gu what I saying yep sweet yep they caught the Revelation what can I say so that's a seed and I'm going to put here I'm going to put a little arrow there and I'm going to put Lucifer Lucifer you know this is a total side note you know there's only one mistake in the Bible for me right they give Satan a capital letter and Lucifer I never write Satan and Lucifer with a capital letter he don't deserve it it's true it's true it's just one of my little things so this seed called Lucifer started way back there yeah it started way back there maybe Millions ions of years ago I don't know only the Lord knows I'm I'm not that I ain't that clever but um if we notice the seed that was inside Lucifer when he created him the seed began to grow the seed you call it the seed of discrepancy the food seed of the false fine it began to grow Lucifer got puffed up in his own heart this when the seed began to grow that the Lord had placed in him okay that seed of the tree of knowledge evil when that seed started to grow it it had to start manifesting it was growing inside him that was it and you know he the result of that the fruits then that we began to see from this tree already back then is that we have Angels turning to worship Lucifer instead of God you know if we notice the Satan Lucifer he convinced other angels to worship him right so he began sewing the seeds from his own tree that had come out of his heart that was growing he began to sew the seeds before the Garden of Eden he began to sew those seeds of Doubt into the heart not say Hearts they don't have hearts into those angels and if we notice the angels that fell were also created to be deceivable amen okay okay this is all in God's great plan it's not a mistake I want you to think about these things just kind of think outside the box you know I always tell my folks you know the word of God's like a diamond you know and and and if we just kind of walk around the diamond we see the same diamond from so many angles and I'm not I'm not not just we see we see it and it just kind of opens and makes the picture bigger God created them in a way that they could be deceived now think about this now if those angels I love these questions if these angels could be deceived if those angels could be convinced listen carefully then God when he created those specific Angels the ones that he knew would fall he created them with some kind of level of free thinking agency think about it if we if we can be convinced or deceived it means that we can actually think for ourselves so God within those Angels he he gave them some kind of I wouldn't I don't want to say free moral agency because that refers to human beings but some kind of free thinking ability like ah yes boys come and worship me oh yes I'll give you a special long gown whatever is and there's oh sounds good sounds good you know I mean and they're thinking it's not just kind of like no no no no no it's like oh they're thinking that well maybe convincing sewing the seeds see it's it's it's quite nice to think these but it's true these things have to be if the Angels were deceived God firstly created them that they could be deceived and secondly they had some kind of free thinking okay so the seeds of discrepancy are then sewn in the minds of those angels I'm going to say mine not Soul they don't have souls and they fell okay and it's sometimes hard to understand but it had to be so God could be fully manifesting all his attributes so now there's war in heaven Lucifer and his angels are Now cast down and I don't have room to really put it in there in fact we could put it in there because you know for the younger ones it's easier to to kind of see if I put a a if I put a dotted line down that's kind of the time frame you remember time comes this way I'm saying time obviously we're not in time here at the moment but just to correct that one okay so so what did I say here I've forgotten already um yeah Angels that's it angels falling yeah so so Angels Angels cast down cast down okay and then yeah they're just down down and we can even draw them like kind of like laying flat for the kids to understand okay so they're cast down now and uh the seed that had started growing in Lucifer's I'm going to say his heart but he didn't have a heart but in Lucifer's heart as it were it grown it was grown to the point listen carefully the seed remember that he is the tree of life he start he always was the tree of life but there's a seed that begins and he's put in the heart of Lucifer I'm saying the heart of Lucifer you understand what I'm saying okay and now this seed has grown to the point that it's manifesting it's kind of bearing fruits right it was branching out now and it was enough mature enough we could say to have it own and now he's casting the seeds into the hearts of other Angels so the evil is Now cast down and you know let's just read uh Genesis 2 go back to Genesis 2 and this is now what really started my thought this morning was this question where did that tree come from so we'll read Genesis chapter [Music] 2 Genesis 2 and we're going read 8: 8 and 9 and the Lord planted a garden Eastwood of Eden and there he put whom he created and out of the ground made he the Lord to grow every tree that is Pleasant to sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so now we see the tree of life is also in the Garden of Eden so now we're fast forwarded here the tree of life is here also so actually I could put here because it's remember that's with um with Adam and Adam and we'll say Eve we know it was Adam and Adam and we'll put the third man the Fourth Man in the fire as it were okay and I'll just put the pillar of fire over his head that's the Lord Jesus okay so he is he is in the Gard this tree of life okay is in the Garden of Eden also right 89 now we'll read 16 and 17 and the Lord God commanded of the man saying of every tree in the garden thou mayest freely eat hang about brother Chad was touching on this when in this service that he took when he ministered Adam had access Adam and Eve we say Eve Adam they had access to that tree of life they had access to the Tree of Life they had communion walk with me they had access to the Tree of Life verse 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou uh that thou eatest thou therefore of Thou shalt surely die so the question was where did this tree come from and now we see listen carefully now now we can see why it's a tree in the Garden of Eden it's not a seed in the Garden of Eden because the trees grown the seed started way back here so now we fast forward and in this tree of in the in the garden also and I'll have to put it in here as well we have um how am I going to draw this one two little horns we have also the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil okay it's not a seed in the Garden of Eden it's a tree it' been growing a long time and it started out as a seed in the heart of Lucifer okay but now it's a tree and it's bearing fruit notice the Lord says don't eat of the fruit of the tree he was you know brother Hadfield was the old brother that passed away it's thing's grandfather in it and he was the gardener wasn't he yeah that's uh sister Net's father is that right am I right yeah is that good yeah sweet he was a gardener that's it yeah he was a gardener so he knows all about this listen I love you know trees are nice we've got a few of them and I feel like chainsawing them down cuz they don't give much fruit but I tell you what what a couple of them do give fruit it took years for them to give fruit you can't plant a seed in the ground to the next year it gives fruit it takes some amount of maturing and this is what we're sort of seeing here because back here it's a seed the seed grows and it starts to grow in branches out and it starts to bear fruit and the seeds are cast to the other angels and we're fast forward here and now we've got a fully grown tree now in and it's bearing fruit and that's what the Lord says don't eat am so what we saw this perverting and the deceiving that was going on in the in the the Garden of Eden was the fruit that started out as the seed that was sown now the trees grown and now the fruits being shown so when the Lord created Lucifer he made him with the seed of the false Vine that would grow into what we see today he planted him with that seed inside him and that's where the tree came from that we saw in the Garden of Eden so now it's hard to understand sometimes you know well how can he do that and how can he create something with evil in him well the scripture also says is there any evil done in the city that God hasn't done himself he's got a way of doing things he's got a way of making and manifesting to bring out the adversary the perfect adversary to bring out his attributes but think about you know the Lord is to help us just to to think on that one the Lord is so perfect can any of you in here forget other than me seriously anybody can forget right brother John is it brother John brother John when's you know remember that time last uh last week that somebody stamped on your foot I'm just saying you know and it hurt yep and you were a bit see we we we we remember things I kind of remember things we we we try to forget and we forgive people it's amazing how we we forgive people and I had the Revelation a while ago that you know if we just forgive people of the evil they do to us then all that is left is the good that they've done to us if it's someone in relationship so we truly have to forgive people from our heart but you know it's funny how and and the Lord knows my heart I I I just love people I just love everybody and I and some people kind of upset me and but you know and they've been nasty to me and and you forgive them and you pray for them it's like oh Lord I've got over that one and then something else happens and it brings back all the old memories see we struggle to forget in these bodies God is so great that he can even forget right and I'm not talking about like you Computer Guys in here you know I struggle to drive my phone but you know you computer guys you can go back into the computer and find stuff that's been deleted years ago we're not talking about that kind of empty the the what you call it a bin on the FI empty the bin on your computer we're not talking about that we're talking about total forgetness for toal forget forgetness it's not even a word forget forgetfulness total memory loss the Lord is so perfect he can actually have a total memory loss that makes the older people in here feel pretty good it just makes us more spiritual see God is so high above all our ways when God created Lucifer for his perfect plan he actually created within Lucifer a go wrong chip amen he created a little chip in there that was going to go wrong a bit like our fridge and freezer you know what I mean know a bit like a Chevy aan he's got he's got that go wrong chip built in and and all the angels that were going to fall were created with the same chip see it's not it's perfect it's so perfect when God created he engineered Lucifer to make him so that he would fall and become Satan he would be a further manifestation or a further yeah manifestations good the attributes of him were going to come out and unfold into this picture called Satan he created him as Lucifer he became Satan it was no mistake and when the Lord created you and me it was so perfectly engineered perfectly that even though we go through the truest T trials and tribulations you know the seed within us it just keeps growing never stops growing yeah the Lord's good we are so perfectly made to fulfill the role we have here to fulfill the role and you know I think Brother Kyle preached about the scars and listen listen to that that was beautiful and it touched my heart but you know each limp we have each scar we have everything we've ever gone through is for us to be that Perfect Bride he so Engineers us so that we can fulfill our role perfectly and listen if God takes such extremes to mold you and me do you think that he does any less when he creates his greatest adversary he he makes him an engineered Lucifer so perfectly to be that enemy he knew what the tree of the tree was going to look like before it was even a tree when it was still a seed so the Garden of Eden now there's two trees one is the tree of Satan the false Vine and the other is the Tree of Life The True Vine read the Paradox a quote from Paradox in 1964 um Jesus was the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden do you believe that congregation says amen he was the Tree of Life there was a tree in the garden one of them was if you if he touched it now we have our differen he's obviously preaching the mix congregation he says now we have our differences on that so I won't go into it but let's say it's a tree of Disobedience he's being very gentle with the people Disobedience as soon as they touch that tree all the people was to die and they had to put them away from this other tree CU if they eat this tree of life they would all live see what I mean so so we have it's like the tree of life is so so powerful the tree of life was so powerful even if they've done wrong if they quickly went and touched and ate from the Tree of Life that's it they' got life again the Lord Jesus doesn't matter who you are what you are what your condition is how low you sunk in sin you come and eat of that tree of life you've got eternal life that's it cuz if they eat of this tree of life they would live knowing right from wrong that's right you probably you you know that as ministers we have our ideas on that and we probably differ what the tree was but we can all know that Christ is that tree of life amen the Lord is good amen so we have our two trees the two Vines and now we see where they come from and how they started and we see how they are both bearing this fruit they're both bearing fruit they're both mature think about this in the Garden of Eden it was a tree it was not a seed trees bear fruit seeds don't bear fruits they were both mature in the Garden of Eden yes amen you know before the fall the Lord walked with Adam the Lord walked with Adam this is the communion they had the access they had to the fruit of the tree of life but the the the invisible tree the tree of knowledge of good even we say it's invisible the fruit of that tree caused the Divide between God and man and hence quickly barring the way because although now they've sinned they go and eat of the fruit of that tree as brother R says they're suddenly going to live again so the way had to be bad so now this this Fellowship this Walking with God has been lost until now it's lost until now and we've seen it again first we've seen it in brother Bram when he the Lord the same one here which is there turns to brother BR says walk with me yes see it's now it's it's it's been restored this this tree is being restored the The Obedience to the word is what brought on the fellowship and the walk with me amen everybody wants to be you know I've said it before everybody everyone want to um everyone wants to uh be the husband of the king but nobody wants to bake the cake for him you know I mean it's like everybody wants to walk with walk with God like like brother bam but nobody wants to give that life a sacrifice and I know we all do that's our our hearts our heart is to give that sacrifice but that's what brings that Fellowship back is the true obedience and you know I think brother brother Chad said didn't he he said if you if we could just get to the point where we only ever eat of the Tree of Life yes and then we get that eternity kind of thing blending in though we're dead yet we live you know though we're old and we look a bit worn out second hand you're still young it's a paradox you're young and you're you're old and all is well so now after the fall now the way to the tree of life was blocked it was bad and the angels are placed that's Genesis 3 uh 24 I'll read that 3:24 I can read it quickly all right J and he drove out the man and he placed to the east of the Garden of Eden Cherry abins notice it's beautiful I've just seen that listen the east of the Garden of Eden we're going to meet at the Eastern Gate in the New Jerusalem you know the way that was blocked is going to be opened again it's awesome he drove out the man and placed him at the east of the Garden of Eden cherub beims and a flaming sword which to which turn every way to keep the way of the tree of life amen so this tree now the the way the Flaming sword has been put there to block the way the access to this tree of life and the word of God is quicker than any sharper than any two-edged sword it's the word of God is's put there to guard the way to the tree of life and the way to the tree of life is the way to Jesus Christ and it was blocked until he came to redeem us by his blood and now the way the way the way to life was blocked until he came himself okay now I just want you to hold your hands in Genesis 3:24 and flick over to John 14 just go to John 14 John 14 6 John 14 6 Lord Jesus says I am listen I am the way the the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me you see look the way that was blocked came to open the sorry the way which was blocked the way came to open the way that was blocked see the way the same I am the way that I am that I am the way came to open the way that was blocked Amen to himself he came to open that he the revealed word the word of the hour is the way back to the tree of life amen and no no one can come to the father no one can come back to this one nobody can come back to this one here unless you go through the cross no one can come there but by me the way now was veiled there was a veil over the way but the way was opened when he rent the twain the veil in Twain he ripped the curtain open that went into the holiest of holies he rent The Veil he he opened the way again he opened the way to the inner holiest of holies into the to the way of life to the Tree of Life The Rail was rent and and behind that Veil if we had been standing in the synagogue kind of looking there you know like all righteous and religious you know because now we're inside the synagogue and the Lord Jesus is out there hanging on the cross um you know if you were a Pharisee when the veil was written in between you could have looked out through the window and seen the way hanging on the tree the way was blocked the the curtain was there Badger skins and all the rest of it it was totally sealed totally protected by the Flaming sword the word of God but when he ripped it open what did we see we saw the tree of life that's what we saw we saw the access back and anybody that eats of the fruit of that tree gets life again though you are dead yet shall you live that's the way back amen yeah see behind the veil now what we see behind the veil is not just a tree but it's a fully matur tree yeah and he's bearing all the fruits it's bearing all the fruits the attributes of the Savior the Healer anyone in here needs healing today it's there the fruit's there reach out and take it go behind the veil just behind the veil we long to see his face what we long to see his face we can see his face the veil has been torn open just grabbed the fruit the Lord's telling us just grab it now not to eat the fruit is death not to eat the fruit is death notice now this tree of life it begin to it begins to bear fruit through his bride the fruit of the spirit and if we notice the spirit in US produces the same fruits like he the same fruits we are bearing the same fruits as the original tree because that's where we come from yeah we come from that original scene we were in here brother Franco I'm going to try this look at that he said you can even Zoom but hey see I can even sister Joyce is just laughing there I'm going to put in here where is it I've got this wrong way there we go [Laughter] Jo see what I mean sometimes sometimes we just need to kind of Zoom a little bit sometimes we just need to zoom to see ourselves oh I'm just a young one I'm just just me I'm just a child whoa whoa whoa you are huge in the eyes of the Lord yeah even you children you're massive in the eyes of Lord you just zoom in a little bit and now you say hey it's not Jill it's me it's not Joyce it's Jill and Jo we know that but it's me I'm in there I'm in there too like that oh that's too much I'm not very good I'm getting used to this the Lord's good let's read Galatians 5 Galatians 5 Galatians chapter 5 and we'll read 22- 25 22-25 Galatians 5 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering Gent goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and if they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we walk if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit see that's the fruit of his life that's being manifested in us that that seed of life that was planted in us when we came to the Lord It's been growing and it gets to the point where you can't hide it anymore amen and it gets to the point where it starts bearing the fruit and we don't look back with pride and say well look at me how far I've come cuz yeah we don't do that but you know what I mean but it's like but we can see that so it does help to sometimes take a moment look in the mirror and say Lord that's your grace look what you've done you've actually brought me this far I can't believe it I tell you you I used to be message believer everyone thought that I was the perfect message believe I wasn't and I knew I wasn't I knew I wasn't I was just as worldly as and there was a time that came when the Lord turned me around you know the Lord you know we all think we all think you know it's a blessing for the young ones to be raised in the message it really is it truly is when you've got God-fearing Holy Ghost filled parents absolutely it's the best but you know it's also not easy you know I was you raised in the message and you're raised and and compromise begins to come in and you end up just as worldly as but there's always been that seed inside and sometime at some point in time a specific time the Lord starts to get that seed growing and it ends up that you can't hide it can't hide it and it starts to bear fruit and the fruit that we bear is the fruit of the tree of life you know let's just turn our Diamond a little bit we'll look at the manifestation of what's on the inside of the seed the manifestation of what no no it's in the Garden of Eden Cain manifested what was inside the seed that was inside him he was manifesting that and he bore the fruit of the tree that was growing in him amen so remember the seed that started way back there in the heart of we say the heart of Lucifer okay the same seed was sewn into the fallen angels and the same seed now is in can and begins to bear fruit of that Original Seed that was planted so notice the way that Abel he just had it in him to bring the right thing he didn't have to try hard he just kind of he just he just did it he just had it inside him and you know the the seed that was inside the seed that was inside of him he was manifesting that life seed that was inside he probably didn't even know what he was doing truly he you know we we can we can lay all sorts of um scenarios out and well he looks at his brother and he's got six fingers and he's got five and he doesn't know what Grace is as it were he he doesn't know what five is Grace six his man no he's got six fingers and I've got five and he's that big and I'm this small and he looks at his parents and thinks well my dad's not that big um you he doesn't maybe he didn't even think that but just in him listen I don't think the apple tree has to think very hard it just does it brother likes to talk about I think it's talks about the Sheep bearing the wool and stuff we can testify to that one he just grows they don't have to think about it it just kind of just bears that fruit okay so uh Abel Abel brings the right ad right he brings the right sacrifice and now Kain was the same he couldn't help but manifest what was inside him he couldn't help it it just came out and what it was he he was manifesting the seed from his father who was the devil the seed that was in there full of lies and deception let's just read one John number one John just to nail this one on the head one John that's the one John at the end there 1 John 3 1 John 3 and we're going to read 11 to 12 11 and 12 11 and 12 says for this is the message that we heard from the beginning that we should love one another hang about just pause one second this is the message that we've heard from the beginning the beginning of what the beginning of the beginning whether it was preached or not inside that one with sister Joyce was love was love why did the whole planet of redemption start because God loved us God loved that attribute that was inside him he loved it and so the Plan of Redemption starts so this love is not a new thing okay this this love began there at the beginning so it says here for this is the message we've heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain who was of that Wicked one okay and slew his brother and wherefore slew him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous his fruit was evil and his brother was righteous and back then the false Vine he trying to kill off the True Vine tried so he was of the wicked one so all he could do all that Cain could do is to manifest the characteristic of his father you know I've said it to our church but you just look at me this prob you don't know me that well but if you look at me I'm going to be dead honest with you we've got this huge sort of forehead thing that sticks out it's an Abbot thing we've got massive teeth at front two massive teeth we've all got teeth problems we've got massive teeth massive teeth I'm like a donkey right point is me dad's got the same me granddad's got the same me Grandad me Nana had these big teeth we it's just kind of the Abbot thing sorry Josh you I mean I'm not saying it's a bad thing son I'm just saying we could I couldn't help so when I was born I didn't I didn't kind of choose to look like this all I can do is to manifest the characteristics of the father that's all we can do and K was the same all he could do is Manifest the characteristics of his father so if we notice now one of the characteristics of Cain is is is when the Lord questions him where's your brother you know he turns around to him he says how do I know go look yourself and my brother like in modern language go and have a look yourself am I My Brother's Keeper yeah what the cheek straight to the face of God right and then when he's cast down to be a vagabond okay he turns around and says no it's too much for me so what I'm thinking is this is timeon now the attitude that he had if he's expressing the characteristics of his father what did Lucifer say when the Lord's casting him and his little Merry band of angels down no don't do that to me you what I mean it's it's like he's casting him down and he'll have the same attitude because if you look at the sun yeah you know you'll see the father that's it crazy the same fruit will be produced by the son that was in the father notice here Cain part of his characteristics was you know and this this manifesting the life that's in him part of the characteristics of Cain was to be religious religious notice how his church was all nice and Polished and oh he didn't just lay the fruit out in the church oh no he swept the floor and everything swept the floor and put some nice flower in ments brought the fruit and you know I'm sure that his worship music was all kind of touchy touchy Fey Fey make everyone comfortable and playing on his little flute or something I don't know point is the contrast the contrast he was this religious person just like his father listen carefully Church Lucifer was in charge of worship I think he knows how to make the folks feel good it's like all those angels that fell that had that go wrong chip inside them how did he lure them oh it feels so good hey ho hey all that junky music worship feeling he was in charge of worship he knew what do we see today I'm just going to move on here see it's these two Vines growing when the Lord made Lucifer he made made it so that all the types would be perfect all the way from that point ever onwards it was all in there it was all programmed within the seed these two Vines growing side by side the one the tree of knowledge and the other one the tree of life and they're all bearing fruit they're both bearing fruits fruits now that show their origin want to read this quote man running from the presence of God in 65 brother says you can see people today there is two Spirits whoa whoo whoa whoa he's just fast forwarded now he's just fast forwarded now to today so he says you see here people today there's two Spirits one of them is the Holy Spirit the other one is an Unholy Spirit one is and one as in a person and one is governed by that and both of them religious now yeah there's a strange part they're both religious just like Esau and Jacob was both religious like Cain and Abel both religious like Judas and Jesus both religious both religion we see it today both sides religious see it's the same Spirit the people die but the spirit doesn't die goes right on both religious one of them is possessed with the Holy Spirit and lives that kind of life that they should live and walk Godly and honest and they wouldn't beat you out of a penny they just do everything honest they can to help you and the others will just be as nice as can be the others we find out is just the vice versa and yet both of them are religious Spirits two of them one Holy Spirit the other one un Holy Spirit if you noticed it'll even um it'll even claim through claiming religion they'll make fun of you and call you a Holy Roller they do everything they can so we see these two Spirits we see Cain and Abel Moses Kora we see Judas and Jesus and brother R was saying that we still see it today listen you know the false Vine is not some ugly old old priest in some musty old cave luring you in come on in come on in it's not it's it's not some kind of you it's it's it's pretty it's beautiful it's religious it's smooth oh yeah it's smooth smooth talking smooth it's nice it's warm and it's cuddly and well God just loves everyone God loves you the way you are that's not a lie but if you say it God loves you the way they are you know and you're still living wrong then you're saying God loves the way you are you stay like that but if you say God loves you the way you are now come to the altar that's another story you know God loves you the way you are but he didn't love me the way I was 20 years ago although he loved me the way I was do you understand okay so the false Vine is now so disguised so disguised that we're hardly able to tell the difference we're just going to read about that let's turn to to John 13 John 13 Book of John John 13 John 13 John 13 and we'll read 21-29 John 13 21-29 this is I like this I like this scripture says when Jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily I say unto you that one of you should betay me now just listen he sat there with the disciples okay the last supper okay he sat there with his disciples around him and he says now that one of you one of you and there was 12 there he's going to he's going to betray me says then verse 22 then the disciples looked one another doubting of whom he spoke he now that was leaning on jesus' bosom one of the disciples who Jesus loved Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him John John Pitts and burger John who is it who is it you can just imagine the scene everyone's asking who is it ask him who it is who who it should be of whom he spake then he lying on jesus' breast that's John brother John sayth unto him Lord who is it then Jes Jesus answered he it is now listen carefully he it is whom I shall whom I shall give a so when I have dipped it and when he had dipped the so he gave it to Judas Iscariot the son of Simon Just pause this just the how many young ones have got in here anyway got a few let's just we're moving on here with this time thing so we're moving on oh I can't draw there can I so we're moving along with our time thing and we get to the point where we're at the cross this is the cross okay so now just before the cross that's here here okay we have uh the Lord Jesus okay and he is holding a bread okay so now we go on to the next little part of the story he takes the bread this is for the younger ones he walks across and he takes the bread and he dips it into the bowl with the so and then he he goes and there's little Judas there with his horns okay and now the Lord Jesus is the Lord Jesus pillar fire here again the Lord Jesus comes and gives it to him the up okay who do you think it was who was going to betray you I'm going to take a so and I'm going to dip it in that food and then I'm going to give it to the one who's going to betray me J just put out your hand after this oh wait I've got to read to 29 I so right 27 after the stop Satan entered into him then said Jesus to him that doest thou do it thou quickly now no man at the table knew for what intent he SP this to give me your hand now go and do what you got to do right for some of them thought because Judas had the bag that Jesus had said unto him buy those things that we have need against the feast or or that he should give something to the poor after all that that's happened they're still looking at one another he's so disguised right Judas had gone out to betray the Lord right but because he's so religious because he's so well disguised nobody even guest in fact in fact this is just Simon now but if you asked Simon Peter in Gethsemane while he's like half falling asleep and waking up and he like wakes up this is just Simon wakes up he say hey Simon I've just had a quick count up me there's only 11 of us do you know where Judas is he be like oh yeah he's just gone to feed the poor true true they had no idea because he was so disguised unbelievable Judas did not have horns gr out of his head he didn't mate nobody guest see this religious facade is hiding the seed that's on the inside you see and the seed that was planted in Judas was the same seed that was planted in Cain it was the same seed from the same tree that was planted in Lucifer's heart back at the beginning remember we read the scriptures he was of the evil one yeah okay and he was the son of pedition so now we've got these two growing together we got Jesus and Judas and they're both manifesting the fruit the Son of God the son of predition the two trees and trees give fruit not seeds trees Now by seeing the fruit that's growing on the trees you know you can tell what sort of seed they come from you can tell where they come from and the Lord Jesus said by their fruits ye shall know them and every person listen every person that has ever lived comes from a source either inside them they have the seed of life or the seed of death yes it's in every single one there is no there's no way either the true of life or the false Vine you can't see outwardly who it is you see it with Judas you can't always see outwardly who it is this religious this this this disguise but the by the fruits the fruits cannot lie the fruits can't lie the the tree has to Bear the fruit according to the seed it's got no choice so now uh how Judas Del of the Lord Jesus to death is exactly the same as what was in the seed in the Garden of Eden when Cain kills his brother it's the same one exactly like Cain did in the Garden of Eden it's the same fruit so he's manifesting the same uh attributes it's manifesting the same characteristics and both of them are religious yes both of them are religious but now they've both got this religious disguise Cain and Judas it's the same religious disguise okay but the fruit always show shows what is Original Seed let's read Matthew 23 Matthew 23 if we can please Matthew 23 and we're just going to read 27- 31 please 27-31 now this is the Lord Jesus speaking to somebody who's also got that same seed inside 27- 31 I said yep yep W to you scribes Pharisees Hypocrites for ye are like unto Whited slicers which indeed appear beautiful outwardly but within are full of dead men's bones and of uncleanness even so ye outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity listen the Lord Jesus here is pointing to the seed that's on the inside of him okay woe unto you scribes uh and Pharisees Hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the suppliers of the righteous and say if we'd have been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets wherefore ye be Witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets mate see these Pharisees their fruit the their fruit they were bearing the fruit uh the same fruit that killed the prophets of old amen okay out of their own mouth the tree that killed the prophets of old right they were manifesting the same fruit before the Lord they were saying out their own Sid look basically the Lord Jesus is saying look because you're bearing the fruit I'm seeing what seed you come from and the seed that you come from is the one that was killing the prophets of old and you've got the same filthy seed inside of you he identified them he could identify them by the fruit by their fruits the proof came out of their own mouths the very actions proved who they were and the fruit showed their origin now notice when Cain K killed Abel Cain had no remorse he had no remorse okay he had why though he had no connection he had no connection you know me and my brother yeah we get along okay but we're not the closest but if I killed him I'd have remorse do you I mean but I you kill anyone got you know what I'm trying to say but he had Joy sorry um you know because he has no connection there's no they come from a totally different he has no remorse totally No Remorse you know they come from a different life Source totally different Life Source there was none of this invisible you know how we kind of love each other and one of us thinks of each other and you want to phone each other what can I say you know me and and get a phone call from brother I was thinking about brother Shay and he was thinking about me and then he I just I can't did I message you or you message me brother I can't remember I messag you you messag me you mean you just it's just an invisible Bond brother John you you get a message I was thinking about like mate I was thinking about you you it's just like brother John and brother brother Chad and brother everybody else you me it's just like what is it's an invisible Bond because you come from the same Source see what I mean but if you don't come from that same Source it's like you've got no remorse like Kane had no remorse and Judas and Jesus you know we and we see we see it today we see it today how can it be that that you know thankfully not here but you know you you get churches where socalled Brethren are kind of real nasty to someone how can that be I'm sure we've all experienced it how can that be how could it be well it's Judas and Jesus all over again it's Judas and Jesus all over again because they're coming from this different Source they don't have this compassion this empathy they don't have it because it's not their brother you know if if we see a homeless person on the street it's uh it's not nice it's not nice my heart goes oh oh Lord help him you know Lord help him but but if if I saw brother Brian laying on the street mate I'd stop the car jump out and I'd just do everything I can to help him what is it cuz we come from the same Source you know what I mean now it comes to fruits it always come back to fruits because and why is it always coming back to fruits because way back then it started there's a seed we're looking at the fruits now we're not looking at the seed anymore we're looking at the fruits so so looking at the fruits we're seeing where the seed came from now if you're like me give me a Farm Seed and I'm all right but if you give me any other seed and you say brother Simon there's a seed tell me what seed that is I'll say yeah no problem give me about 6 months in the greenhouse I'll tell you do you know what I mean it's true because when you don't have a clue what you're doing it's simple just plant the seed Let It Grow it's like oh yeah that's a tomato plant I know what that one is now do you me come on you know when it comes to the time of harvest we start to see what the seed was where it came from you know let's just look at the roots of these trees you know the roots of these trees that we see today manifest the trees that we see manifest they come from different Origins they're from different seeds and at the beginning they were not intertwined The Roots ain't intertwined okay they were totally separate and only through the fall did this false Vine gain the opportunity to grow together with the True Vine on Earth okay so the FR which brought the battle in heaven he brought the battle from that was in heaven onto Earth and it came to hold whole new level of battle you know we talk about like modern warfare and all the rest of it and but like a lot of it's like hiding out in it and you get these like sleeper cells and all the rest of it and what is it it's this disguise you get all these you get all these the Warfare is not kind of straight anymore you know you it used to be it's Christmas day now you know that's it put your guns down Lads and we'll have you know we'll pass presents to each other and that like it was in the Battle of s or whatever it was back then those days are over now it's like all hidden you don't know what's what and it's just all this blurred and since then you know in in the spiritual terms the trees have been growing together ever since and you know the wheat and the tears the tree of life and the tree of knowledge and you know they've been growing and growing now back in the days of Noah the the tree of knowledge got kind of trimmed back a little bit you know what I mean that tree got kind of chopped back a bit this funny I I would have liked to take a picture to show you but on the way just you know like this there piece of road in in in in in England we pass it all the time when we go shopping and they've got these poetries they're about yay big and I don't know why but like about 30 foot high they've chopped them off straight right and the oddest looking things so you got a straight tree trunk that's like this big 30 foot tall and on the top you've got loads of these little trees growing out from the top but like like multiplied not one like like 15 and it's the oddest looking weird this thing and you just think you know when you chop something down usually it kind of grows back a b faster this time you know what I mean it's true yeah so back in the days of nor it got trimmed but uh it started growing again and it grew pretty quick you know you cut the apple trees back and they grow back stronger brother Hatfield would have been able to tell you all about that you see the seed from the the um the seed of the false Vine came through the ark although it had been cut back it was still there and it began now to grow again yes and in the days of Noah if you notice in the listen carefully in the days of Noah the the the false Vine was fully matured fully matured yeah and it was bearing fruit big time it was bearing the same fruit we see today let's read Matthew 24 and we'll see that Matthew 24 35 to39 Matthew 24 we just been in here aren't we Matthew 23 Matthew 24 4 35-39 he says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away but of that day and hour knoweth no man know not the angels of heaven but my father only but as in the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating drinking marrying and giving marriage until the day that Noah ENT the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so also shall the coming of the son of man B so we see there very clearly that however it will be a millisecond before the Rapture was exactly how it was in the days of Noah amen see that tree of knowledge that that the false Vine was to such a point of maturity back then see and it's the same fruits of Satan that's being manifested and now if the fruit of the tree of life is all this peace Joy long suffering and so on for forth then the tree of the false Vine is going to be the exact opposite and that's what we see today that's exactly what we see today fruits of evil fruits of Lucifer and you know the last time I looked out my window it's pretty bad out there it's not so nice anymore you know we see the fruit of this false Vine we see as in the days of Noah we see the same thing today and now at the end time which is Matthew 24:24 Matthew 24:24 okay we see these Vines growing super close so Matthew 24:24 it says uh for the sh arise false christs false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so now we see this false Vine remember it's the religious Vine it's the same one that started out back then the same one that started out back when it was worship and all the rest of it and all and all uh in heaven through Lucifer then it came down to earth it was in the Garden of Eden it was Cain and then Lucifer and the Pharisees and we see this it's it becomes so close now at the end that these branches are kind of blurry kind of blurry and you know if you've got if you've got uh like two trees and they kind of all like absolutely growing all mangled together have you do you do you have that game here like as children where you you follow the lines and you find out where it ends like a goes to you look for the little boat or the flag or some when you're a kid it's a bit like that so you you get all the trees all mangled and together and that simple grab a branch follow it all the way down to the roots and you'll find find what seed it came from which tree it's from but actually they get kind of blurred they're kind of together and they're so close that they kind of look the same and if it was possible it was listen carefully they shall show great signs and wonders we're talking about we're talking about Ministries that have got full on like healings and and and and big we're talking about when's that you know when's the last time you had like 50 people down at the altar all from the world straight in doesn't happen we're talking about Ministries that have like coming to the Altar and giving the heart to somebody you know we've got we've got miracles happening we've got all these things going great signs and wonders it says that if it was possible it would deceive the very listen guys we are human right so if you've never seen me before and I come here and brother Chad says oh Simon I'd like you to me fine fine fine and then I at the end of the service anyone who sit come forward if I I just lay my hand on the head like that okay be a show a manly show and suddenly they're heal to walk out legs grow everything else it's all totally healed now that is totally accessible when you come and get pre but it's not a show right but if you make a show about it I'm telling you within a week I'll be invited everywhere true great signs and wonders but you guys you would look at it and you say whoa whoa whoa he's making a show that ain't the Lord see what I mean but you see it's so close now and it's this great signs and wonders it's get so close if it was possible it would deceive even the elect the vines you know look unless unless you've got the Lord living in you unless you've got that seed in you you will be deceived just read Mark 13 Mark 13 we're all over in the scripture which is fine Mark 13 verse 99-1 please mark 13 9-1 the Lord's good Mark 139 to1 okay says but take e to yourself for they shall deliver you up to the councils that's the false Vine trying to kill the the the True Vine yeah and remember deliver you up to the councils and synagogues this is church we're talking about this is religious not like oh they'll deliver you to the world and no no no no they'll deliver you to churches they shall take e yourself and they should deliver you up to councils and in Sy gogs you shall be beaten ye shall be brought before rulers and Kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gospel must first be published in all all nations but when they shall lead you and deliver you I like this when they shall deliver you and Le deliver you up take no thought beforehand what you shall speak neither do premeditate whatever shall be given you in that hour that ye St speak ye for it's not ye that speak but the Holy Ghost which one's the holy ghost that one so in these situations right in these situations who speaks it's not you it's him so when you are cornered by the enemy in any situation and you don't know what to say and you pray Lord help me please Suddenly It's him in you that brings the answer and sometimes it's quite cool cuz sometimes we look back and it's like mate where did that come from it's true it happens to load of time just like oh man cuz I ain't that clever people think going to somebody stripped me down once I just kind of said what I said and I can't remember they they they were just so frustrated and like you've always been a good talker and stormed off and I just looked I thought yeah but I'm the one who actually can't talk I'm the one who just kind of fumbles and mumbles and kind of like just you know just have a go and just say it and wiggle your way out of it but you know sometimes it's like we're shocked it's we shouldn't be shocked it's so we're so stupid we're shocked because he speaks through us but he's just told us that he's going to speak through us but when it happens it's like M how how did that happen come on you know so when we're calling about the enemy it's him that's speaking and it's the same one that's in you the same one that's in you that's going to speak is the same one that can't be deceived so if it was possible we'd be deceived how is it not possible that we deceived because of that one that's going to speak out of you that same one stops you being deceived that same one discerns whoa that's the false Vine here now that's wrong amen you see they're so close that you can't hardly put a piece of paper between them yeah but if you give them now the word test yeah yeah amen give the word test and you'll see what's inside of them because the Holy Ghost Inside you cannot be de saved it can't be it can't be notice if it was possible but it's not we can't can't be deceived as long as he's inside you that is it it's like it's like it's like when you when he's sealed inside you that's it the box car has been sealed now if you want to know what's inside somebody just give him a squeeze stamp on brother John's uh foot I want brother but just stamp on his foot and he'll just say brother I know that you love me that's it that's it done see what I mean you stamp on someone else's foot and wait put it this way if you squeeze a lemon you're going to get lemon juice you know what I mean it's true is it just give them a squeeze I'm not telling you to go and squeeze every I'm just saying that if by their fruits you're going to know them buy their fruits you're going to know them we um we were down in New Zealand and there was this fruit tree outside and they looked it was full of oranges uh lemons what it lemons and I'm talking like hundreds of lemons it was huge right it's like well nobody's touching them cuz the lemons and the person out the it was an Airbnb they said oh yeah go for it mate take him we like okay well Miriam might have one she likes a bit of lemon so sweets do you know they were like oranges they were like oranges so what sort of lemon it was I've got no idea it's true a it they were super sweet they're super sweet they were like oranges but they were like a lemon so sometimes you can't always look on the outside and see well that's a lemon that's going to be sometimes you know I might look at brother Joe and say may you look pretty sour bro and then you talk to him and he's as sweet as honey you mean but you can't always go by the outside you know so by your fruit what is the fruit it's not just what it looks like it's what's inside the fruit and if you notice inside the fruit there is a seed and that seed is an exact multiplication of the DNA seed of what was planted in the tree and go back until you get to where the Jo has been she was hiding there hid in Christ from before the it's true hid in Christ before the foundation of the world okay says just given the word test and you know the Lord Jesus was he was the Rose of Sharon he didn't look like it beaten smashed down hung on the cross but he was squeezed and out of him came that perfume of the rosesan he was the lily of the valley he got squeezed and the same perfume that came out of the Lord is the same perfume that comes out of the Bride when she gets squeezed it's exactly the same notice the Lord said in John we won't read it John 10:27 he said my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me listen the Lord says my sheep hear my voice they know my voice he said his voice is also his word yes and so when you hear the word if there's something that's a little bit off you can hear it and you're like whoa whoa whoa because my sheep know my voice so as long as we're bringing it here and it's the word of God that we're bringing it's like M that's so true that's brilliant that's so true because my sheep need know my voice so if we give someone somebody word test if they're his sheep they will know the sound of the word they will know it and they'll say Amen there'll be a deep down on the inside that's going to respond to them thank you for getting me the brook brother Franco let's lean not to thine understanding he's 1965 you know brother was talking about the cattle being brought down he says the cat laugh the cat laughed their kind many time in bringing a round up down now this is something that we we haven't got cattle now we used to have fairish cattle but not now um this is like different for you American guys cuz this is talking about like the thousands he says we bring down whole herds of cattle and the little Cales and I used to wonder how they would ever know their own Mama now they coming down out the mountains the cattle all mixed together and a cow is with a cal maybe a little hungry Cal might nurse from a little from another mother if he's real hungry but when we stop them out on the Prairie and the mama starts through that crowd of cows uh until she finds her own the calf is running for its mother it knows that certain wine in her ball she's balling for the calf and other mothers are balling till you can't even hear yourself think but the little L the little calf will find that certain call of its mother because it's a part of its mother a born again Christian from Heaven he's a part of this word right another mama he will not follow his part of the word and he stays with the word listen we've seen ourself with the cattle and with the Sheep you know it's like when you're sorting them out you've got you've got loads of there there's the hundreds of them kicking around and it gets loud it gets so loud honestly you can't hear yourself think you can't even scream at each other to talk and yet in amongst all that it's crazy how the Lambs and the even the Sheep they find the way straight to the m how's it happen I don't know but they know the sound of the mother and we know the sound of our father his voice his word we always will find our way back to our father wherever you are he's calling for us remember um no man ever searched looking for God God's calling man he's that one who's I say balling you know what I mean he's the one who's shouting out to us come on Brian come on do you know what I mean he's calling to us and we hear him you know when when we were kids you might think I'm a bit crust but but I used to just whistle for our kids like I Whistle them they knew I tell you I'm telling you there' be a crowd like with the homeschooling thing whatever hundreds of kids I go I can't even whistle cuz I'm I'm I'm mouthe gone dry I give a real loud whistle I tell you out of the whole crap our kids would come straight to me it sounds like like like a bit you know a bit unfather mate it's not it's just a way of calling your kids them knowing you know I don't whistle for them on a night o i just shout but but Jer they knew that sound they knew that above all and you know what we know the sound of Our Lord amen and sometimes he doesn't wish whistle sometimes it's just a still small voice but we go straight to him we know that voice the bride knows the sound of his voice she knows the sound of his word and somehow it's called Grace somehow we follow that sound until we get to where we're supposed to be am Before the Throne of God the Lord is good you know the two on the road to EMAs they were walking together and the lord gave them the word the whole time he was giving them the word all day long and when they heard it something kind of was burning on the inside it's like man something there's something here you know and and the two the two SE the the two the two uh the deep and the the Deep calling to the deep and the Lord Jesus and the two and something in him and and and come time for him to dis oh no no Lord please stay stay stay they they they stopped they didn't want there's something an unseen Bond exact opposite of what Cain had to his brother there's this bond that it's just like m i don't you know when we kind of said goodbye to brother John I kind of cried you know what I'm saying you know because because there's a bond there's a bond it's not seen you can put a piece of paper between us but but when we say goodbye to to to one another there's this unseen bond that we just love each other we appreciate each other it's that deep go and they felt that on the road to the em and the word came to the word there walking on the road to and this came this reaction you know the seed that was in them okay came from the Tree of Life that was walking and talking with them the seed that was in them came from the third man walking the tree of life and it can only be a reaction when that happens you know the fruit of the True Vine let's look at the fruit of the True Vine you know we're in the world and the worlds are Fallen condition we can see the false Vine you know the false Vine is is showing off its fruit everywhere it's absolutely everywhere you know we can't escape it but as the two Vines have come to maturity the True Vine is also bearing fruit it's not just the false Vine the TR the True Vine Al those small listen you know I was going to draw a little a little graph but it's like could do I suppose I could do I could do um so I'm just going to move it this way this is just this is just Simon but I like I like to just think about this if we have a graph and we have uh power displayed power displayed notice it's Tower Power displayed okay it's going up here okay and that's the Max and that's the zero and then here we have time again time okay and time is going this way so this is Eden here here is Eden Eden and here is like now okay this is now this is 2024 2024 I like doing these little graphs but the point is the power displayed back in the Garden of Eden right listen carefully one man one man Mountain over there tree move you're going to be called this you're going to be called that full full power full Dominion so the power displayed of Adam Starts Here Right power displayed in one man now then how much power was displayed in Lucifer in the Garden of Eden one word one word so the power displayed starts down here but as time goes on the power displayed has gone up there for Satan Lucifer this is Lucifer remember it's power displayed not power actual power and the power displayed of God and God's children has come to the point now like this notice we are such a small minority we even though the church is full of the power it's not a show we have got such a small minority right and yet Satan is now in the majority and his power is being displayed in the world you see we listen you know we think oh it's it's all gone wrong it's not cuz it looks like we're going down in power you've missed the point we're going back to Eden we're not we're not coming down the bride ain't coming down the bride's going back up we're going back to Eden we're going back to to that full power you know the world the world looks and thinks oh Christians will look at them they're just a a tiny bunch of of nobodies yeah yeah it looks like it power power displayed power shown we're going back to be Eden we're going back up to that position and Satan sorry mate you're going back down to Zero from zero from hero to zero and we're going from the zero to the hero yeah yeah yeah sure you know the bride is now displaying although it's not a show for the world she's this listen the Lord Jesus the greatest power that ever lived and how did he display it beaten whipped hung on the cross and died amen how is it going to be for the bride the greatest power you'll be beaten by your brother beaten by your sister I'm just saying you know what I mean or you'll be beaten by the world you'll be beaten knocked down and in the eyes of the Lord that's the most beautiful thing ever and as that rules of Sharon bride is crushed the perfume Rises to heaven and that is a sweet Savor in the smell of God the True Vine is bearing its fruit in you and when you hear this word preached just like the two on the road to maze you say didn't our hearts burn as we sat and listen today wasn't Lord good didn't he speak to us and that's because the Original Seed that's in you is responding to the seed of the word that's coming over and there and it can only be a reaction it can only be you you get nervous oh Lord you know how am I going to say anything how am I going to do this how I'm going to do it's like you know what just leave it brother brother car said I think brother Lonnie said just just wheel the barrel out to the front and that's it that's your job done how should we why should we worry we know that the word's going to encourage somebody somewhere just just give it out that's the word it's the original word it's going out the two the two the two uh Powers coming together and there has to be this reaction the original word that's in you is responding we are bearing the fruit the Lord is manifesting his life in us just read James 5 James 5 7 to8 7 and 8 James 5 7 and 8 the Lord's good I'll just blow my nose James 5 7 and 8 says be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early in the latter rain be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh notice here the husbandman the Lord Jesus he's waiting for this precious fruit of the earth now you know these the trees have been the seeds have been sewn the trees have grown and now the fruits are shown and the Lord is waiting for this precious fruit of the earth and what fruits waiting for he's waiting for you amen he's waiting for the bride the bride is that fruit to come to maturity and listen seeds don't bear fruit that's right so when you first came to the Lord wherever we were in our life we loved the Lord something inside we couldn't help it but like abble Cain all the rest we couldn't help it we just loved the Lord but we weren't kind of bearing the fruit cuz we were still a seed it doesn't make us any less but we're still a seed but now this bride tree is so mature it's bearing exactly the same same fruit that he did see let's read in Paradox uh paradox paradox just read Paradox in 64 it's actually the piece right before that what we've read already it says and today this age we're living in there is a bride tree no he's not a seed there's a bride tree coming forth see truly the tree has come up and they soon as they organized they couldn't step any father what happens they organize go out on this limb then that limb is pruned according to St John chapter talk about when it's you know through the church ages according to St John the 15th chapter he prunes them off and they never used no more but in the heart of that tree comes forth the fruit right in the top of it when the tree is fully matured that's now it can't go no further right in the top the last Church AG is here she's come into full mature it's a bride tree amen see the bride is is this precious fruit of the Earth the fruit that is Manifest in the Life of Christ the fruit is I just want to read a spoken word The Original Seed I think brother Chad read this as well whenever he preached on the uh whatever it was I listen to it on the way over here and um some sometimes sometimes you you kind of you kind of see something it's like you know the bride is that tree of life the bride is the tree of life and you're kind of doing your notes and you know that you know it's com from the you know it's coming from the Lord if Minister you'll know it you know it brother Kyle you know it comes from the Lord but sometimes it's just too unbelievable it's too scary and and and I kind of left it out and and I thought oh I got and then just by chance I kind of I listened to this and brother Chad brought this quote he's like boom I think it's this one or it's the next one spoken with Original Seed 57 it says all right I think this is I know this is actually it goes on to that other quote I think he say all right now here's what I'm trying to say to you this is pick up the pen remember the law of reproduction brings forth of its kind these last days true church Bride Comes To The Headstone will be a super Church a super race as they near the great headstone they will be much like so much like him even they will be in his very image in order to be United with him they will be one listen if he's the Tree of Life and they're going to be one then what does that make sister Jo's true what does that make you brother John makes you the Tree of Life they will be talking to the bride they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God that is strong words and you know what that ain't even brother manam that's pick up your pen that's the one who just said that is that one and those words were spoken back then when that power was just infolding within itself those words were Tru us today the Lord sorus sitting here manifesting himself sorus back then made the law of reproduction she has to Bear him she has to she has to bear his every characteristic she comes from him she's bone of his bone she's seed of his seed amen amen the bride is the fruit of the original orig seed tree the tree of life and the fruit she's bearing the fruit of that original tree it's the Lord ofy production it has to be look my forehead if you know the Abbot family you'll say he's an Abbot look he's even got the teeth it's the law of reproduction we can't help it next time you going to look at our Josh uh and you're going to say mate chub you've got two big teeth and like yeah that's me I can't help it comes from my dad and you say well it's your fault I'll say well don't look at me look at my dad and my dad say well look at me look at my Grandad cuz my Grandad was the same see what I mean it's the Lord of reproduction it's it's it's Christ The Mystery of God revealed in you the mystery of God revealed in you just like we've read in James 5 the coming of the Lord is drawing nigh and that means it's kind of harvest time it means the stuff's got to be getting ripe the precious fruit is going to be taken into the Ghana it's coming to the point where it's it's getting ripe now har time means kind of Separation it's true it's a separation of the two Vines it's this culmination of this whole plan the tears and the thistles will be separated out to be burned and the Harvest Time means separation it separates the bride takes that grain from the bride away from the field that she's been raised in she's been raised in this world the world this Fallen world that's where we've been raised that's where we have to grow in there and we'll be taken away but for those who are left behind it's also a separation time it's separation from Grace it's separation the the harvest time the Rapture is separation all sides total separation it's Separation The Lord's coming soon you know and there a scripture says Luke Luke 3:9 we can read it actually Luke 3:9 Luke 3:9 Luke 3:9 remember no let's read this now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees every tree therefore which bringeth forth not good fruit is heun down and cast Into the Fire notice that the ax is laid to the root of the tree which root you talking about whereabouts on this little diagram are we the root of the tree that's a seed that's a tree I tell you what it's it's quite close in there it's going to be laid to the heart of Lucifer that ax is going to be separated those two those two Vines if they don't bring forth the good fruit it's going straight back to the root of the tree the Root's pretty close to the seed amen you know it's kind of the root it's kind of where the tree comes from right and the Lord's going to deal that death blow amen it's coming that time you know the act of God's judgment is laid to the root of trees and if it doesn't bring forth the fruit of the original tree it's going to be he thrown into the fire because a seed has to bring forth after it kind and if it's a seed from the father that's what it's going to be producing byy your fruits you know them it's it's God's law of reproduction you know and and the ax is it's the axe laying time it's the Harvest Time you know everything that's not seed of the original is going to be separated everything you know brother John he's combining with his maze he sent me a film of it it was beautiful the Lord's good I'm I'm the you know everybody everybody you have contact with they always put the Lord straight into everything you know he's H mind and he's like oh the Lord is good brother and he's enjoy it's just give thanks the Lord but you know brother John's combine he just swapped it out this when we were here last time he just swapped his combine if if he's combine starts to separate out the Shooks and a few tassels and all the rest and sticks it into the OR into the hopper you're going to get a new combine you're going to sort it out it's it's a separation of anything that's not the seed that you want to be in the hopper which you're going to take home and put into that Heavenly Kingdom which would be that round tank that he's got back at the farm you know what I mean anything that's not fit for the cows for the king's table as it were he going to be separated out it's natural types of spiritual you know now question is when brother when brother John goes to Harvest his his his crop what's being Harvest ah it's maze well yes but it's actually fruit because the fruit is the Harvest of whatever you're planting it's not fruit it's not just like tomatoes or whatever it is it's the fruit of the Harvest is the grain so if it's maze it's maze that's the fruit of the Harvest yeah and and and I'm telling you the Lord is not harvesting maze here the Lord's harvesting the fruit the precious fruit you are the Harvest you are the one that's going to be taken you're going to be separated for everything else you're the fruit of the Bride tree you are the fruit of the you are the fruit of the tree of life you know the bride is bearing that fruit she's bearing his fruit it's his roots and it's his fruits this is I think this is this is the quote I was talking about Christ is the mystery of God revealed 1963 I love that it says now remember he is that tree of life contrary to the serpent seed you see he's that seed the woman's seed the Tree of Life In The Garden unless they put forth their hands and move this tree they'd eat of the tree and live forever right so the Lord bringing that again we've read it already if if if if the way wasn't guarded to that tree of life even if you sin you suddenly eat of the tree of life it's beautiful for us doesn't matter what we are and what we've been you eat of the tree of life and you've got life okay and he's the only tree that can be taken that you can live forever his word is life and that be the word then the word of God which Eve turned down in the Garden of Eden then here is Christ the word made manifest and when he come on Earth he was the Tree of Life do you believe that congregation says amen and Rome what did they do he had to be chopped down a bit like those po trees I told you about one trunk chopped off and it's the weirdest thing that's like 20 come out the top see what I mean they might have chopped him down but look what came out the bride Look what comes out he had to be chopped down and he was put on a tree of dis disgrace cursed is the is he that HTH on the tree become a curse for the human race and now through that he brings forth a bride tree yes which will be the Tree of Life life restored back to him as husband and wife in The Garden of e all glory to God by the same word and the same God made manifest in husband and wife the same brid tree back again you know those those uh 15 little Twigs that grow on top of them thing they're actually all the same tree you chop it off and it grows Noah it came through the flood the sin the sin that was after the flood that chopped It Off it grew back all those 15 sin as well and what was it it was the same seed it was the same tree but we we're seeing now it's the same tree that's restored back now and it's not some ugly looking tree it's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen but you see he's bringing forth a Bright Tree which as he said which will be the Tree of Life mate it's a fully matured tree it's bearing his fruits it's manifesting him in every single way and the tree comes from the seed that was way back there at the beginning before anything was manifested John 1 in the beginning not Genesis 1 in the John 1 in the beginning beginning right when it was still just the word when everything was just there and nothing was yet manifest as it were we were chosen in him before the foundation of world to bear this fruit it's amazing now we're in 2024 and it's time when these two trees are fully manifesting now their fruits his plan his plan for you and me is to bring us to such a maturity that we are him we become him we you know the exact same seed that was in the beginning now in a multiplied form the bride's coming now to such a maturity that the world now by looking at you can actually see him think about it the world wants to know what the Lord Jesus looked like I'm looking at it I'm looking at it yeah yeah but you know you're not the prettiest bunch of people neither was a lord there was no Beauty in him that men should desire him you know there's none of us that are super beautiful no on the inside we're the most beautiful thing the Lord ever created the Lord is good you know we are coming to such a maturity that the bride is manifesting him in every way Brother Kyle I think preached on Ecclesiastes 3 and there's a time for everything it lists everything there's a time and a season for this for that there's a season I'm telling you there's also a time in a season for the bride to manifest his fruit there's a time there's a time for the bride to show the world what was in the original seed there's a time and that is the time we are the chosen people to show the world we're the chosen people to manifest Christ and you know we come to a close and uh I don't know how long we've been I don't I don't want to know but it's okay I had to get rid of loads of notes cuz I just thought oh Lord but all is well let's just as we come to a close let's read Luke 24 Luke chapter 24 Luke chapter 24 I'm coming to a close but not quite yet we'll get there Luke chapter 24 let me blow one no again and we'll read 44 and 45 Luke chapter 24 44- 45 so and he said unto them these are the word this is when he's after he's resurrected he comes to see them come to see his disciples and he said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures listen the Lord opened their eyes of understanding the Lord opened their eyes even though he'd walked with them for years before years he'd been explaining to them and expl it's a bit like it's a bit like you know dipping the soap same thing there comes a time when he opens their eyes of understanding he'd walk with them for years but there was a specific time when their eyes were to be opened unto what he was talking about he'd already taught the scriptures but the Revelation was only given later on it was given at the right time listen in 1963 the seals were broke yeah the seals were loosed but there was a specific time when the revelation of what it was all about was to come you know it was the Revelation was to be given later on I want to show you this little this I'll draw you a little diagram here I'm getting used to this I know I could never have one back home sorry brother Michael listen I've got to copy this one to show you so it's like I love drawing these little graph time okay so it's like it's like a it's like a a a little graph and here we have uh rapturing Revelation rap I'm saying rapturing Revelation and not just Revelation okay rapturing Revel okay and now here we have levels so this is zero that's one two 3 all the way up and this is maximum is like 100% cuz that's that's your maximum that's that's that's the Rapture okay now here is time again we have time usually we have time at the bottom so it's time and here we have first church age second second Church age and so on so forth so first church age yeah okay and now we have this kind of growth we have these steps brother brother uh John sings that song you know this uh seven steps and that's it yeah so now here we have this is the bride and she's kind of walking up these steps the Revelation is growing so as we're as we're going through these Church ages this this this Revelation is growing revation is growing it's growing we can't help it we we can't help it what is it's the tree that tree that's growing in us the seed is becoming more and more mature and now we get to a point here and here we have 1963 we have 1963 and now here we have this is the rapture Rapture this one so now we know at the point of the Rapture this Revelation level has to be here it has to be here okay but we are right now and I'm just you know we're looking for the Lord's coming every day we know that but we're saying that we're here right now this is us us it's not the US I'm sorry it's just us this is now so we see this kind of time period look here here it's been this time period you know seals were broken back then nobody really knew what it was on about true it's true let's be honest see he opens the eyes of understanding at a specific point in time when the Lord was walking with him he was preaching the word to him the whole time he was the word and yet they didn't have a clue what he was talking about although something on the inside was burning but they didn't even know what it was but it was just it was just like that deep calling to deep I don't understand it but I just believe it Lord but there's a specific time when his when they opened their eyes amen it's beautiful and you know Revelation is given it can only be given we know the scripture Simon blessed out th Simon Jonah not this to but the Father which is heaven Revelation is only given amen can't be learned see and the Rapture the revelation of actually who we are and what it's all about has come kind of nowish am you know it's only now that we're truly seeing who we are mate I'm telling you the first time that I because I mean when we when the Lord brought us out from where we came from and and the Lord began the ministry it was on the back of who we are because I could kind of see who we are I was kind of getting wo hang about how can we be the Bride of if we're him the word says that the two shall no longer be Twain but one therefore that makes us kind to him that's what brother was saying back there but no one ever dared to say it because you being a man make your s God they crucified the Lord Jesus for saying that they would have crucified the bride for doing that as well and if and if the Lord does not come there'll be no flesh saved why because the false fire will crucify the bride for saying that you are God that's who we are that's where we are and the Revelation only just come now it's only just come now why mate this is the last days of the last days we are in the last I tell you we are so close musicians can you come please listen one of these days the bride is going to be gone I'm not the best artist I know but I'm just going to put here the Rapture for the bride is this this takeoff it's like one of those kitty little rockets look the Flames pouring out the bottom and there's sister Joys inside it's true one of these days we're going to be gone and now listen when they send up a rocket the last thing they put in is a rocket fuel the last thing the most volatile Revelation is put in at the last moment because if the devil knows catches this Revelation he could do great damage like brother Ram says we're right at the end this is the hour this is the season we're in this is where we are we have to be ready it says keep your lamps all trimmed and burning for the bridegroom watch and wait it's manifesting time it's lamp trimming time we're in that time it's a time when the TR the battle is Raging more than ever between the two trees you know we may be in a mixed up body but but the seed that's in us that's the real you and me it ain't M mix tree we only carry the the real me the real you carries the Original Seed listen it's home time yeah you know I hated school I hated school I had a bad up bad childhood I hated school and you know the most favorite words that I heard as a child 20 to 4 okay children it's home time yes that was my favorite words and that's what the Lord's saying to his children the Lord is gently calling us now because it is home time it's time to be gone it's why this sudden burst of Revelation this the rocky fuel that listen we can't ignore it and each one of us in here knows it especially the older ones that have been around a long time you've never heard things that you've been hearing the last 5 years or so never never although it's been there the whole time but there's a time when the eyes of the opening of the understanding has to be opened it's right at the last time the rocket fuel soon we're going to be gone am soon we'll hear the Lord say it's home time children it's home time yeah amen we sing 1051 please be it unto me according to Thy word you know we want the Lord to plant his seed and and look you know it's it's fine saying oh Lord we want you to plant our seed know he's done it when before the foundation World sister Joyce is just getting a
