[0:00] in order to manifest Christ
[0:03] the first thing I need to do is make
[0:05] myself of no reputation
[0:09] that sounds easy I mean that rolls right
[0:11] off the tongue
[0:12] but that's one of the hardest things for
[0:14] a human being to do
[0:18] it is so hard in this word that says
[0:22] make himself of no reputation this word
[0:24] reputation means actually means nothing
[0:28] it means be void to be empty to be
[0:31] nothing he made himself void empty
[0:34] nothing he made himself absolutely
[0:36] nothing
[0:39] and took on him the form of a servant
[0:43] so if I'm going to follow after Christ
[0:47] I need to make myself I'm supposed to
[0:49] have this mind
[0:51] that was in him this is the mind I'm
[0:53] supposed to have
[0:55] which who being in the form of God
[0:57] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[0:58] God Amen we know that this is part of
[1:01] the mindset understanding where we came
[1:03] from understanding that where we
[1:05] originated understanding that we were
[1:07] part of God and with God before the
[1:09] foundation of the world that's part of
[1:10] this understanding
[1:12] but being that that's part of the
[1:14] understanding it's almost like it's
[1:16] foundational for the next part Because
[1:18] unless you get the first part you'll
[1:20] never be able to come to the second part
[1:22] because only those that are part of God
[1:24] can take the nature of God and make
[1:26] themselves of no reputation because
[1:28] Lucifer can't do that
[1:30] humans of themselves can't do that amen
[1:33] because that whole nature of Lucifer got
[1:35] injected in humanity at the fall he
[1:38] found through the serpent a way that he
[1:39] can inject himself into the human race
[1:41] and with that he brought Pride with that
[1:43] he brought arrogancy with that he
[1:45] brought all of these uh other things
[1:47] self-preservation and all of these
[1:49] things was entered into Humanity right
[1:52] there amen and without without a
[1:55] revelation that I was before I came in
[1:57] Fallen flesh I was
[2:00] I was part of God I was one of his
[2:02] attributes part of his thinking he had a
[2:04] design and desire to express me in this
[2:06] life now I've fallen into hybrid
[2:08] condition but this hybrid condition will
[2:10] not Define me because my existence was
[2:13] before the hybrid condition
[2:16] so I will not let the Fallen nature
[2:18] Define who I am I will not let the flesh
[2:21] control me amen because this part of me
[2:23] that's been awakened by the baptism of
[2:25] the Holy Ghost has been quick in the
[2:26] life that part was somewhere before it
[2:29] came into this vessel
[2:33] and it was part
[2:35] of this God this divine nature this
[2:38] Supreme Being
[2:40] so there it carries with it
[2:42] characteristics
[2:44] from God
