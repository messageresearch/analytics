TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Who is this MelkiseDC? He says God come down and became flesh and died to death in Christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it for fellowship. Now we're getting into real redemption. Not not a lamb, not just shedding blood, not just a covering, but he was going to do something to erase the sin. Amen. And he could have limited fellowship, amen, along the way. But God has to make a way for unlimited fellowship. And so he came and became flesh and died to death in Christ so that he could clean the church. So what was the purpose of shedding of blood? For sanctification. So he could clean the church in order to get into it. For what purpose? For fellowship. Now then he says God loves fellowship. That's what he made the man at the first time for was for fellowship. God dwells alone with cherubams. So God's wanting this fellowship. So he came down himself in a body of flesh and gave his own life. Amen. So that he could sanctify a church so that he could send back his spirit to live inside of you. For what reason? For fellowship. So now where do you fellowship with God at? Not in church, friends. Not you fellowship with God in your soul. Amen. Where God has entered in. Amen. by the power that was released at Calvary, by the shedding of blood, by the sanctification of the spirit, so that he can enter in and dwell in you and be with you and be in you. Brother Brandham said, Amen. the this woman challenged brother Brandham because of the oneness doctrine and said, "Who was Jesus praying to when he prayed to the father in the garden of Gethsemane?" And he said, "Let me ask you a question." Yeah. Amen. Said, "Do you have the Holy Ghost?" Yes. He said, "Then who do you pray to when you pray?" Amen. How far away is this fellowship? Amen. It's as close as you let it be. Amen. God wants to fellowship with you. That's why he died. That's why he sanctified you. That's why he filled you with his spirit because he wants to fellowship with you. We go to egoentrical view again, right? God wanted me and he died for me and he filled me with the Holy Ghost so I was sealed so I can go to heaven. Listen, that's that's our little human pebbrain perspective. But God did that because there was something he wanted. He wants your fellowship. He wants you to talk to him. He wants you to love him. Amen. He wants you to share your life with him. And he wants to share his life with you. That's why in this generation under this message, amen, the veil has been taken away. So that we could see what God has designed and wanted all along. So they're not stuck in a church denomination egoentrical view all surrounding us. But we can back up and go all the way back to the back part of God's mind and find out what he wanted all along. He wanted himself replicated as a family and flesh on the earth and fellowship with one another. Amen. God wanted to fellowship with himself. That's why he wants to live in you. Because he wants to fellowship with you in a deeper way than we could ever imagine. We're out.
