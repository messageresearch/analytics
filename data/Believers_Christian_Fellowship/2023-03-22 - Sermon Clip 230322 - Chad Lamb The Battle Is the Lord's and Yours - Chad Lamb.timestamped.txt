[0:00] I started asking myself what is the
[0:03] bride
[0:04] what is the bride
[0:06] the bride we know the brother man asked
[0:09] the question what is the word bride he
[0:10] said the manifestation of the hour
[0:13] what is the bride it's the portion of
[0:15] the word that God once expressed in this
[0:17] day
[0:18] so it's a thought of God now expressed
[0:21] which is a word
[0:23] and it's the anointed word for the day
[0:24] so it's also Christ
[0:27] but that bride is being manifest in
[0:30] human vessels
[0:32] so I believe by faith that I'm part of
[0:34] the bride and the bride is being
[0:36] manifest through my human vessel
[0:38] but then I say what part of me is bride
[0:40] well the only part of me is bride is the
[0:42] soul
[0:44] this isn't bride
[0:45] my mental realm is not bride the only
[0:48] part of me is bride is that part that
[0:50] come from God the Eternal part that's
[0:52] down inside another Chad Lamb that may
[0:54] not even have the name Chad Lamb
[0:57] I don't even know what the name will be
[0:59] what do you call it in the Heavenly
[1:01] Realms what was it in the thoughts of
[1:02] God one it will be in the great
[1:03] Hereafter I don't know maybe it'll be
[1:05] Chad Lamb maybe it won't maybe we'll
[1:07] speak English maybe we won't
[1:09] the point is the the genuine thought of
[1:12] God concerning me amen is down in my
[1:15] soul and come alive amen by the spirit
[1:17] of God that is the bride
[1:20] that is my portion of bride that is the
[1:23] thought God had before the foundation of
[1:26] the world when he thought of me that's
[1:27] what he was thinking of Amen now that is
[1:30] contained in a vessel that come through
[1:33] sex birth through hybridization that's
[1:34] born wrong it has a carnal worldly
[1:36] spirit that part has to all change but
[1:39] until that change takes place the life
[1:42] on the inside must bring this subject to
[1:45] the word of God
[1:46] but I never must lose sight that this
[1:49] isn't bride
[1:52] or else I will start treating all of me
[1:55] as bride
[1:57] and have too much confidence
[2:00] and my emotions my thoughts my feelings
[2:03] my Sensations
[2:10] amen
[2:13] this isn't the day to be childish
[2:16] this is the age to grow up
[2:19] and have understanding
