[0:00] see our superficial forgiveness is like
[0:03] this I forgive you but in your mind wait
[0:06] till God gets
[0:10] you or I forgive you brother that's all
[0:13] right I forgive you but oh God's going
[0:16] to get
[0:18] you that's the wrong forgiveness that's
[0:21] not forgiving from the heart forgiving
[0:24] from the heart now comes
[0:26] shoulder-to-shoulder with the brother
[0:27] and say God this is forgiveness yeah
[0:30] listen this is the reality
[0:32] friends God I'm willing to bear the
[0:35] consequences for their action as payment
[0:38] for their
[0:39] release and I'm not asking you to punish
[0:42] them to make them pay set them free and
[0:46] don't judge them because of me because I
[0:49] forgive
[0:50] them and in that kind of forgiveness now
[0:53] youve become the intercessor and you
[0:55] stood in the Gap if you're going to take
[0:57] the consequences for their action then
[0:58] you're going to take the conse qu of
[1:00] Your Action you're not going to pretend
[1:01] to take the consequence of Your Action
[1:03] hoping that God makes them pay for their
[1:04] actions that's not bearing the price of
[1:06] their
[1:07] forgiveness that's superficial that's
[1:09] mental that's not the reality the
[1:11] reality is I'm not going to ask God to
[1:13] make them pay either I hope they don't
[1:15] have to pay I set them free and I want
[1:17] them to go free I want them to prosper I
[1:19] want them to be happy they have no more
[1:20] obligation to me and God please don't
[1:23] judge them for what they did to me
[1:25] because I forgive them for what they did
[1:27] to me if you judge J them for something
[1:30] else they did if you judge them for what
[1:31] they did to you that's fine but please
[1:34] don't judge them for what they did to me
[1:36] I set them free that is pure true
[1:40] forgiveness and if you can't do that you
[1:42] have not come to forgiveness from the
[1:44] heart yet and don't feel horrible if
[1:46] you're not there it doesn't come easy
[1:48] friends sometimes we got to go back and
[1:50] say God I need your help I'm not able I
[1:53] can't get over I can't get free I'm not
[1:55] able to Bear the consequence of their
[1:57] action I still want them to pay
[2:01] if you still want them to pay even
[2:03] though you're not going to make them
[2:04] you're just trusting that God will do it
[2:06] we're not there
[2:08] yet because how did Jesus forgive us
[2:12] father forgive
[2:17] them
[2:19] Father I take all the consequences for
[2:23] their actions upon
[2:26] myself forgive them they don't know what
[2:29] what they're
[2:31] doing do you realize what a powerful
[2:33] statement that was that day on
[2:37] Calvary the question is are we going to
[2:40] be Christlike or
[2:43] not this comes down to
[2:46] reality I said this is powerful this is
[2:48] deep this is not trivial this is not
[2:50] surface this is not mental this is the
[2:53] depths of reality
