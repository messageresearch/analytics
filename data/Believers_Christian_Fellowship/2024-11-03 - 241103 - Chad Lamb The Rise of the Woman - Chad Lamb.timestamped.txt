[14:20] amongst us in Jesus Christ's name we
[14:23] pray
[14:25] amen amen God bless you this morning
[14:27] it's good to be here with you you again
[14:29] we thank God for another time another
[14:32] opportunity to worship together amen if
[14:35] you could turn with me while you're
[14:36] standing to Genesis chapter 3 just want
[14:39] to say God bless you to our visitors I
[14:41] saw brother Levi here God bless you
[14:43] brother Levi it's good to have you and
[14:44] brother Ben Yoda as well and his family
[14:47] and brother Arley God bless you all and
[14:49] anybody else who's visiting we see a few
[14:51] other visitors God bless you all you're
[14:52] very very welcome it's good to have you
[14:54] with us this morning anden as we look at
[14:57] Genesis chapter 3 together I want to
[14:59] begin with uh this verse and then we'll
[15:01] pick up another one and before we're
[15:02] seated Genesis CH
[15:05] 3 verse
[15:08] 16 Genesis 3:1
[15:12] 16 says unto the woman he said I will
[15:15] greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[15:17] conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring
[15:20] forth children and thy desire shall be
[15:22] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[15:25] thee let's turn together to First
[15:27] Timothy
[15:32] First
[15:45] Timothy 1
[15:47] Timothy and we're going to read from
[15:49] chapter
[15:50] 2 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse
[15:54] 11 and Paul writes let the women learn
[15:57] in Silence with all subjection but I
[16:00] suffer not to I suffer not a woman to
[16:03] teach nor to usurp authority over the
[16:05] man but to be in silence for Adam was
[16:07] first formed then Eve and Adam was not
[16:10] deceived but the woman being deceived
[16:12] was in the transgression notwithstanding
[16:14] she shall be saved in childbearing amen
[16:17] God bless you as you have your
[16:19] seats amen so two two different readings
[16:24] amen and and it has to do with the same
[16:26] subject one is after the fall God God
[16:29] was going to uh put the woman in
[16:32] subjection to the man and he was going
[16:33] to be her head for protection because we
[16:36] know that the woman was deceived in the
[16:38] transgression and so now uh the Apostle
[16:41] Paul's coming along and saying she's to
[16:43] be in subjection uh let the woman learn
[16:46] in Silence with all subjection but I
[16:48] suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp
[16:50] authority over the man but to be in
[16:52] silence and then he references Eden and
[16:55] so saying he references Back to Eden so
[16:57] that's the reason for that
[16:59] amen so this morning may be a little
[17:02] different I've got a PowerPoint I'm
[17:03] going to go over and and the way things
[17:06] transpired for me over the last couple
[17:08] of days is I had a subject that I was
[17:10] working on I've been working on and I
[17:13] was actually really excited about it I
[17:14] liked it and that's the way things go
[17:17] sometimes and I sat down and things were
[17:19] flowing um uh back I think it was
[17:21] Thursday or Friday and I was putting
[17:23] together some notes and and then I
[17:26] thought you know uh with this election
[17:29] coming up on Tuesday and all the
[17:31] craziness that's going on I just want to
[17:33] speak to the congregation and I said
[17:35] I'll just share a few things some
[17:37] perspectives and a few things um uh
[17:40] Sunday night at communion
[17:42] service and so that was
[17:45] good until I started looking at it and
[17:47] all of a sudden it started to explode
[17:49] amen things just started coming so I
[17:51] said you know I just want to take a look
[17:52] at some things some things the prophet
[17:54] said and I started looking at it and
[17:56] things just started opening up uh from
[17:58] for me and we know that we're in a crazy
[18:00] election cycle I don't even like talking
[18:02] about it I think everybody the word I
[18:04] think that the media is using is
[18:06] election
[18:07] fatigue I had it before it
[18:10] started amen CU it's just it's chaos
[18:13] it's embarrassing it's it's childish
[18:15] it's all of these other things but yet
[18:17] all of these events are significant and
[18:19] it's the world that we live in and this
[18:21] is the place where we're at so I want to
[18:23] look at it but not maybe in the
[18:24] traditional way so I've got quite a few
[18:26] quotes and I want to read quite a few
[18:29] quotes So I did the PowerPoint so we
[18:30] could read together so that we could
[18:32] stay together so that we could read what
[18:34] brother Benham said but what I really
[18:36] want to get to is what began to open up
[18:37] to me at the End Amen and that's really
[18:40] what it has to do with with you and I
[18:43] the position that we're in in this day
[18:45] so brother Frank if you could bring up
[18:46] that PowerPoint for me and I I titled
[18:49] this the rise of the woman because
[18:51] that's what we see is going on all
[18:53] around us and brother B pointed to it
[18:56] many many times uh he said women's on
[18:58] the page this is a women's world and
[19:00] when he starts talking about it uh uh he
[19:03] there there's very specific reasons why
[19:05] in this generation has begin to take off
[19:07] like that and hopefully we can get into
[19:10] it and uh begin to understand what he's
[19:13] seeing uh when uh when I I want to talk
[19:17] about uh this subject on the basis of
[19:20] the six Vision or the seven visions that
[19:22] brother Brenham had in 1933 and we know
[19:24] the sixth Vision he saw a woman rise to
[19:26] power in the United States so want to
[19:28] read what he said but I want to back up
[19:30] and catch the fifth vision and look at
[19:32] the fifth the sixth and the seventh and
[19:34] we're just going to review it
[19:36] quickly all right the fifth Vision had
[19:39] to do with the moral problem of our age
[19:42] centered mostly around women God showed
[19:45] me that women began to be out of their
[19:47] place with with graning of the vote then
[19:50] they cut off their hair which signified
[19:52] they were no longer under the authority
[19:53] of a man but insisted on either equal
[19:56] rights or in most cases more than equal
[19:58] rights
[19:59] she adopted men's clothing and went into
[20:01] a state of undress until the last
[20:02] picture I saw was a woman naked except
[20:04] for a little fig leaf type apron with
[20:07] this Vision I saw the terrible
[20:08] perversion and moral plight of the whole
[20:11] world so before we get to the sixth
[20:14] Vision in the fifth Vision he saw the
[20:17] changing of society and the changing in
[20:20] Morality and the uprising of the women
[20:23] and getting out of their place so this
[20:25] is what precedes the sixth Vision so
[20:27] it's important to know what's been
[20:29] happening the whole Cultural Revolution
[20:30] and the sexual Revolution and and the
[20:33] liberation of women and the women's
[20:34] right movement all of it was working an
[20:37] agenda amen and and brother Benham was
[20:39] catching what it was and he was showing
[20:41] us that that it's not godly it's not
[20:45] according to scripture it's not
[20:47] according to the nature of Christ it's
[20:49] not right amen and and you say that and
[20:53] and we can say it thank God we can say
[20:55] it because we're here where we have the
[20:58] Liberty to say what God leads us to say
[21:00] according to the word we would say it
[21:02] anyways but we might find ourselves in
[21:03] trouble one day amen but it's the gospel
[21:08] truth and and it becomes something
[21:10] that's hard to say in the generation we
[21:12] live you go to work and you begin to say
[21:14] these things and you go out in public
[21:16] places because the whole mindset has
[21:19] shifted and the shifting of the mindset
[21:21] is all playing into the Playbook of the
[21:24] enemy amen but God's not being taken by
[21:26] surprise God has a plan also
[21:29] and so we know we've come to Satan's
[21:31] Eden and in Satan's Eden everything that
[21:33] he has planned is coming to the fullness
[21:36] to the full manifestation and here in
[21:37] the seventh age which is completion
[21:39] everything's coming to full
[21:41] manifestation everything's coming to the
[21:43] fullness of whatever seed it is it's
[21:45] coming to the full bearing fruit of that
[21:48] seed so whatever spiritual seed began a
[21:51] thing it's going to come and Blossom and
[21:53] bear fruit and declare what it
[21:55] is so that's where we live and when we
[21:58] come to the sixth Vision brother bam
[22:00] said then in the sixth Vision there
[22:01] arose up in America a most beautiful but
[22:04] cruel woman she held the people in her
[22:07] complete power I believe that this was
[22:09] the rise of the Roman Catholic Church
[22:11] though I knew it could possibly be a
[22:13] vision of some woman rising in great
[22:15] power in America due to a popular vote
[22:19] by women so that's the sixth vision and
[22:22] then the seventh Vision the last and
[22:24] seventh Vision was wherein I heard a
[22:26] most terrible explosion at as I turned
[22:29] to look I saw nothing but debris craters
[22:31] and smoke all over the land of America
[22:34] so in this in this series of seven
[22:37] Visions he had in 33 we just looked at
[22:39] Fifth Sixth and seven the uprising of
[22:42] the women getting out of their place the
[22:43] moral degradation of the world Amen then
[22:46] a woman rising into Power uh in the
[22:49] United States and then the destruction
[22:51] of the United States all right we're on
[22:53] the same page and one of these things
[22:55] just leads right into the other amen and
[22:58] so so uh I I want you to relax because
[23:01] I'm not going to draw a conclusion today
[23:04] I'm not going to tell you this is the
[23:05] conclusion what brother Brenham said
[23:07] because in reality I don't know so just
[23:11] relax we're not going to get off the
[23:13] rails and we're not going to force an
[23:15] opinion or an idea so many people have
[23:17] opinions or ideas or or ways in which
[23:20] they believe that this will transpire
[23:22] the problem is the prophet's not here to
[23:24] say this is that he just gave us the
[23:27] vision amen so I think for us in
[23:29] spiritual maturity spiritual maturity is
[23:31] not for us to to figure out what he saw
[23:35] and look at the Modern events and say
[23:36] this equals that I think maturity for us
[23:39] is to come and say that's nothing but
[23:41] the
[23:42] truth and what we see is certainly
[23:44] playing into exactly what he told us but
[23:46] I don't know how to say this is that and
[23:48] this is that we need a prophet on the
[23:50] scene to do that amen so that's not
[23:53] that's not what I'm attempting to do and
[23:55] I I can tell you this friends in the
[23:57] past I have been tempted and I have
[24:01] failed by taking modern event and trying
[24:03] to draw conclusions by what I saw and
[24:06] this political maneuver and this law was
[24:08] passed and these Stars aligned and all
[24:10] of this means that and God let me
[24:12] miserably fail in all my
[24:14] predictions and I thank God that he did
[24:18] I thank God I didn't share them all with
[24:20] you because a lot of them were just
[24:21] things I thought oh this is it this is
[24:22] that and then it was I was
[24:26] wrong and I'm thankful
[24:28] now that I was wrong because if I had
[24:31] been right it would have created a
[24:33] monster right I don't think God wants us
[24:36] to figure things out I think he wants us
[24:38] to believe follow his lead surrender
[24:42] submit Stay simple stay humble stick
[24:45] with the
[24:47] word
[24:49] amen so don't get nervous we're not
[24:52] drawing conclusions we're not we're not
[24:54] telling you what to believe if you
[24:57] believe one way know that's fine that's
[24:59] okay I have no idea I have no idea how
[25:02] everything's going to transpire or what
[25:04] everything's going to look like I don't
[25:06] know and I'm okay with that amen used to
[25:09] make me nervous if we're the bride we
[25:11] have the Holy Ghost we have the word we
[25:12] should know
[25:14] amen we may not know we may not know
[25:18] every detail but that's okay it doesn't
[25:20] bother me we still have the word and we
[25:22] still have the Holy Ghost and we still
[25:23] have the leadership of Christ amen so I
[25:27] want to there's there's a lot of things
[25:28] that I want to tie in and a lot of
[25:30] things I want to look at so just hold
[25:31] tight and stay with me and I'm going to
[25:33] look at a lot of things brother Brenham
[25:34] said and first I'm going to get into the
[25:35] realm of politics so brother Brenham had
[25:39] a lot to say about politics and I'm just
[25:40] going to pull a few things we could go
[25:42] on for days and days and days with all
[25:44] the quotes but I just want to take some
[25:46] highlights and and uh just show you what
[25:48] I'm seeing here so now the next thing we
[25:51] find out that the devil controls all
[25:54] politics that ever has been or ever will
[25:57] be right oh it's so much better just to
[26:00] get comfortable with that because once
[26:02] you know that your stress level just
[26:03] begins to diminish yeah that's right we
[26:06] find that in Matthew 4:11 and now we'll
[26:08] find out then that Satan already had
[26:10] politics but he's trying to get the
[26:14] church now this was in the the third
[26:16] seal now Matthew 48-11 is the scripture
[26:19] he's referring to says again the devil
[26:22] taketh him up into an exceeding high
[26:24] mountain and showeth him all the
[26:25] kingdoms of the world and the glory of
[26:27] them and saith unto him all these things
[26:30] will I give thee if thou Willl Fall Down
[26:31] and Worship me then saith Jesus unto him
[26:34] get thee hence Satan for it is written
[26:36] Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and
[26:38] him only shalt thou serve then the devil
[26:40] leaveth him and behold Angels Came and
[26:42] ministered to him so the devil showed
[26:45] him all the kingdoms of the world and
[26:47] the glory of them said unto him all
[26:50] these will I give thee brother Brenham
[26:51] looked at that and says he was in
[26:53] control of them all he could give them
[26:56] that's right so we showed by scripture
[26:58] that the devil Satan is in control of
[27:01] all the kingdoms of the world right so
[27:04] let's not let's not have any wrong ideas
[27:07] about even the kingdom or Nation we live
[27:09] in that's right amen
[27:14] amen uh he says in the world politics
[27:17] our world system is just as rotten as it
[27:19] can be I'm not a politician I'm a
[27:22] Christian but I ain't got no business
[27:23] talking about politics but I just want
[27:25] to say they're rotten on both sides
[27:28] I voted once that was for Christ I got
[27:30] to
[27:32] win that's who's got my vote amen I my
[27:35] vote is Christ amen so brother R got no
[27:38] business talking about politics and we
[27:40] don't
[27:42] either and resume of the ages is now
[27:45] remember it was Imperial it was Imperial
[27:48] Pagan Rome that fell by the sword but
[27:50] she was healed of her Deathstroke when
[27:53] she joined to the nominal Christian
[27:55] Church of Rome and Incorporated paganism
[27:58] and
[27:58] Christianity and thereby became the Holy
[28:01] Roman Empire which was to endure until
[28:03] Jesus came and destroyed her but Rome is
[28:05] not going it alone her daughters are
[28:08] right with her and she will take over
[28:10] absolute Authority by the World Council
[28:11] of churches so this is not just the
[28:15] Catholic Church alone that's moving in
[28:17] this movement but it's the Protestant
[28:19] Evangelical moves uh moving with them
[28:22] and they will have absolute Authority he
[28:25] says this may seem far-fetched to some
[28:27] but actually it is very plain for all to
[28:30] see because right now the churches are
[28:32] controlling politics and at the
[28:34] opportune time will manifest exactly how
[28:36] great is that control this ecumenical
[28:39] move will end up with Rome at the head
[28:41] even though the people did not Envision
[28:43] it that way this is because in
[28:45] Revelation 17 3-6 it states that the
[28:47] mystery Babylon is Seated on the
[28:49] Beast she is controlling the last or
[28:52] fourth Empire which is the Roman Empire
[28:54] this Roman Church is doing that with the
[28:57] World Church system system under her
[28:59] Rome will be controlling and this image
[29:02] church system will be obedient to Rome
[29:04] because Rome controls the gold of the
[29:06] world this is in resume of the ages out
[29:08] of the church age book I love reading
[29:10] quotes out of the church age book
[29:11] because the church age book is something
[29:12] brother brandom reviewed he edited he
[29:15] read it over multiple times he knows
[29:17] what's in there and it's there
[29:18] intentionally and on purpose and so he's
[29:21] telling us that there's going to come uh
[29:24] the the rulership of the world is going
[29:26] to come through the Roman system to the
[29:28] Catholic church and the
[29:30] Protestants uniting themselves together
[29:34] praise
[29:35] God
[29:37] Amen he says now now there is a voice
[29:41] today in the world of politics that's a
[29:43] great voice and people absolutely in
[29:45] this great day of politics it's all
[29:47] mixed up in their churches and
[29:49] everything and many times that we have
[29:51] just seen recently that the voice of
[29:54] politics is actually stronger than the
[29:56] voice of God in the churches amen
[29:58] right or the American people would have
[30:00] never did what they' just done he's here
[30:03] in January 1963 he's pointing back to
[30:05] the election of JFK which was the first
[30:07] Catholic President and that's what
[30:09] brother Brenham is showing Amen brother
[30:11] Brenham has nothing against John F
[30:13] Kennedy he has a something against that
[30:14] system that America was trying to get
[30:16] away from that's now moving in through
[30:18] the election of a president he's looking
[30:20] at what's behind the thing so so the
[30:23] voice of politics this is amazing is
[30:25] actually stronger than the voice of God
[30:27] in the church
[30:29] this is what's become the evident
[30:31] failure of the churches in America is
[30:33] their their their their need and desire
[30:36] to move to
[30:38] politics amen amen because it shows that
[30:43] that the voice of politics is stronger
[30:45] than the voice of God in the
[30:48] churches he said they they'd have never
[30:50] done it if the voice of God would have
[30:52] been kept alive in the church they'd
[30:54] have never made that mistakes but the
[30:56] voice of politics is so much stronger on
[30:58] the Earth today than the voice of God
[31:00] until people sold their Christian
[31:02] Birthright for a mess of popularity
[31:04] education and political power my
[31:10] goodness
[31:12] so the atmosphere that we see ourselves
[31:15] in it's all around us we can't get away
[31:17] from it we'd love
[31:20] to but we we see exactly what brother
[31:23] brenham's
[31:24] saying that the churches have become
[31:26] political and theyve become Pol itical
[31:28] because the the politics have more power
[31:30] than the voice of God and and there's
[31:34] there's a lot of things that I want to
[31:35] get into I just pray that God will help
[31:36] me and show the spirit behind all of
[31:39] these things because the church should
[31:41] have stayed with the word and the word
[31:43] only it should have looked to nothing
[31:46] else amen for help no other source no
[31:48] programs no denominations no hierarchy
[31:51] no theology amen no schools of learning
[31:54] they should have looked to nothing else
[31:56] but to Christ Jesus himself the word
[31:58] amen and and when they when they when
[32:01] they when they lost confidence in the
[32:04] word is the ultimate Authority headship
[32:06] and power amen they started to move to
[32:09] program they started to move to
[32:11] education and they started to move to
[32:14] politics and it shows that the church is
[32:17] always a woman it shows that the woman
[32:19] began to lose confidence in the
[32:22] male because the word is the male and
[32:25] she began to lose confidence in the male
[32:27] and she went out outside of headship and
[32:29] she begin to take matters into her own
[32:34] hands and when she took matters into her
[32:36] own hands that's when all these systems
[32:38] and forms and programs and politics and
[32:41] all of these movements began to take
[32:43] place and what it's actually showing is
[32:46] that there's a there's a church as a
[32:47] woman is out from under the headship of
[32:49] the word amen she's now trying to take
[32:51] control she she's actually taking
[32:54] control out of the Hands of Christ she's
[32:56] taking it into her own hands trying to
[32:58] accomplish what she didn't think the
[33:00] word was enough to
[33:05] accomplish she's trying to move things
[33:07] and accomplish something because she
[33:08] doesn't have confidence enough in the
[33:10] word to do
[33:14] it God help us to never come to this
[33:17] amen we've got there's going to be a
[33:19] bride at the end time that's going to
[33:20] stand on the word and the word alone one
[33:23] headship nothing else and she doesn't
[33:25] have to have any control she doesn't
[33:26] have to figure anything out she doesn't
[33:28] have to take it out of the hands of the
[33:30] word and do something
[33:34] herself help us
[33:36] God Amen so this is the problem with the
[33:39] church moving to politics amen the
[33:41] spirit behind it is the spirit of female
[33:46] dominance amen this is what happened in
[33:48] the Garden of Eden amen when the woman
[33:51] left the headship of the word and she
[33:52] left the headship of her husband and she
[33:55] amen all of a sudden found a way to
[33:59] accomplish what was desirable to
[34:01] accomplish what the word had said but
[34:02] she found a way on her own to accomplish
[34:05] it through wisdom and through reasoning
[34:07] and found a better way and she led the
[34:10] way into this way to fulfill the word
[34:12] right but we know it was a way of
[34:15] reasoning it was a way of logic and it
[34:17] brought
[34:19] death amen amen and because of that she
[34:23] was placed in subjection under the
[34:25] headship of her husband for protection
[34:27] because she was deceived she thought she
[34:29] was doing right but what she was trying
[34:31] to do was accomplish the prophecy she
[34:33] was trying to bring about the word but
[34:35] she was trying to do it through
[34:36] reasoning and logic and Science and all
[34:39] these other stuff she was trying on her
[34:41] own leaving the headship of the word
[34:43] leaving the headship of her husband to
[34:45] in her own way with her own wisdom that
[34:48] was presented to her to to to do it
[34:54] herself and that's what brought the fall
[34:58] and that's what brought
[35:00] death oh there's so much God has taught
[35:03] us friends this message has opened our
[35:06] eyes to the whole mystery we understand
[35:09] what went wrong at the beginning we
[35:10] understand what's going wrong now it's
[35:13] the same thing it's the same thing so
[35:18] now when you have churches moving into
[35:22] these political Realms and political
[35:24] activism and political moves and
[35:26] sponsoring political C dates and all
[35:28] this other stuff when you have that it
[35:30] shows that the woman is trying to
[35:34] accomplish what the word
[35:36] says in her own reasoning in her own
[35:40] logic it's the same thing that happened
[35:43] in
[35:44] Eden it's happening now she's taking the
[35:47] leadership amen she's not waiting on the
[35:50] word she she sees it's the word she sees
[35:53] it's it's right and now the churches are
[35:56] trying to regulate Morality In the
[35:58] Country amen not by the preaching of the
[36:01] word but by moving policy in government
[36:04] to force people to be a moral Christian
[36:07] Nation with no conversion with no word
[36:10] with no Christ
[36:12] am and it's never going to work it's not
[36:15] God's way
[36:17] amen
[36:19] amen oh praise be to God I thank God for
[36:23] eyes to see amen I thank God for
[36:25] Spiritual understanding so that we can
[36:27] see what's happening but oh God help us
[36:29] not to repeat amen help us to see
[36:31] ourselves help us to see our own uh uh
[36:34] uh our own humanity and our own wisdom
[36:36] and cast it all down and let's stay
[36:39] humbly beneath the
[36:41] word amen so this isn't just an expose
[36:45] of what churches are doing it's an
[36:48] expose of what's been wrong the whole
[36:50] time what Humanity has done with the
[36:53] word what the failure has been so that
[36:55] we don't repeat the failure
[36:58] because that's our human nature
[37:01] side has a tendency to go that way so
[37:04] we've got a we've got to have eyes that
[37:06] are open and we got to have a submissive
[37:10] humble uh surrendered
[37:14] spirit amen that's what the modern
[37:17] modern woman has
[37:18] lost and that's what's what's become so
[37:22] bad okay I'm going to keep going here
[37:26] I'm going to give a little back
[37:29] background in
[37:33] 1956 America rejected Christ brother
[37:36] benam tells us
[37:37] this he says if God willing I'm giving a
[37:40] try now of evangelism we know the
[37:43] Revival's over everyone knows that I
[37:45] predicted that back in 56 when it would
[37:47] start ending Billy Graham came back and
[37:49] Tommy Osborne and them and I said this
[37:51] is it America receive it or reject it
[37:54] this year and they rejected it we're
[37:56] nothing we nothing waiting but judgment
[37:59] now you mark that down and see if
[38:00] brother benham's right or not that's
[38:02] thus sayith the Lord we're heading for
[38:04] it and we're going to pay for what we've
[38:06] done so brother bam was telling us if
[38:08] you read many places he says in 1956
[38:11] amen Billy Graham canceled overseas
[38:13] meetings brother Brenham canceled
[38:14] overseas meetings Tommy Osborne then and
[38:16] Oral Roberts and they crisscrossed the
[38:18] nation amen preaching all that year and
[38:21] brother Benham said in 1956 that that I
[38:24] believe this year either America will
[38:26] accept or reject the gospel then he
[38:29] comes in 1957 and said America's
[38:31] rejected Christ and that's what he's
[38:34] showing us here amen and and and it's
[38:37] it's very significant to where we are
[38:39] now because of this rejection in
[38:44] 1956 he says and tonight that's the
[38:47] reason this nation stays she's doomed
[38:50] there's no hope for it at all she's
[38:52] crossed the line between judgment and
[38:54] mercy and she's elected in what she has
[38:56] here to control the nation now he's once
[39:00] again referring to John John F Kennedy's
[39:03] election and she is rotten to the core
[39:06] her politics is rotten the morals of
[39:08] this nation is lower than anything I can
[39:10] think of and her religious system is
[39:12] rottener than the morals she become in
[39:15] doing this she has now joined herself
[39:18] all these churches and all of the nation
[39:20] into the Federation of churches has
[39:22] taken the mark of the beast what a thing
[39:24] why Christ give them the opportunity to
[39:27] come to my Feast the Feast of Pentecost
[39:29] which means
[39:31] 50 1956 was the 50th anniversary of the
[39:35] zusa Street
[39:36] Revival 50 years later was Jubilee
[39:39] brother Brandon went back to pisan and
[39:41] preached in Los Angeles the Jubilee
[39:42] meetings he preached the message Jubilee
[39:45] Amen on the 50-year Jubilee of the of
[39:47] the uh restoration of the gifts and the
[39:49] outpouring of the Holy Ghost and this is
[39:51] the 50-year Jubilee and in the 50 years
[39:54] God had brought all these evangelists
[39:56] back and brother brandham and they
[39:58] crisscrossed the nation preaching all
[40:00] over and brother brandham said this is
[40:02] it either they're going to come to the
[40:03] Jubilee or they're going to reject Jesus
[40:05] Christ and in the Jubilee year they
[40:07] rejected
[40:09] Christ it's a significant year it's not
[40:12] just 1956 it's the it's the Jubilee of
[40:15] the of the of the isua Street Revival
[40:18] yeah and brother brenham's looking at
[40:20] all these things and he's recognizing
[40:22] this is it and this is why everybody's
[40:24] criss-crossing the nation and now
[40:26] they're going to accept it and and in
[40:28] 1956 brother B said I believe that
[40:30] they'll accept it and we'll have a
[40:32] Revival that was him hoping that was his
[40:35] desire amen but he comes in 57 and says
[40:38] it's
[40:40] rejected so from that point on it's been
[40:47] downhill he said in birth pain she's
[40:50] totally rotten her politics and system
[40:52] is just as rotten as they can be there
[40:54] isn't a sound bone in her
[40:59] in her World Systems her politics her
[41:01] religious politics and whatever it is
[41:03] one says I'm Democrat I'm Republican I'm
[41:06] Methodist I'm Baptist why the whole
[41:08] thing is rotten to the core there's got
[41:10] to be something giveway she can't stand
[41:13] if you put a George Washington or
[41:15] Abraham Lincoln in every County in this
[41:16] United States it still couldn't come
[41:18] back it's beyond
[41:22] Redemption brother B says this in
[41:26] 1965 it's Beyond Redemption you he says
[41:29] now think about what he says put a
[41:31] George Washington or an Abraham Lincoln
[41:33] in every County it can't come back that
[41:36] means you cannot bring it back by
[41:40] politics because the George Washington
[41:42] Abraham Lincoln in every County I mean
[41:44] wow that would be a
[41:47] change that would probably bring a lot
[41:49] of changes but you can't bring it back
[41:52] by politics that's why the magum
[41:55] movement is Antichrist
[41:58] Christ I I I say that I mean I I may
[42:01] have offended people but I don't mean to
[42:03] offend you but the prophet of God says
[42:06] she'll never come back she'll never rise
[42:09] again says she's Beyond Redemption so
[42:11] how can we believe that we can make
[42:13] America great again when the prophet of
[42:16] God has condemned it and said it'll
[42:17] never come back so there's not a
[42:20] candidate there's not a party there's
[42:22] not a Grassroots effort that can ever
[42:24] bring it back if so then the prophet of
[42:26] God was wrong
[42:30] y That's why we as the bride we don't
[42:32] need to have anything to do with any
[42:35] Politics the devil has it all under his
[42:38] control we don't need to worry about
[42:40] it so listen I I I just want to tell you
[42:43] I'm your brother and I love you and and
[42:45] I'm not here to offend anybody I'm just
[42:48] here to tell you what I believe to be
[42:49] the absolute truth of this message and I
[42:52] don't mean to be offensive I don't mean
[42:53] to say things hard I just want to talk
[42:55] to you as a brother and I want talk to
[42:57] as a pastor and a shepherd of this local
[42:59] church and and say let's be led and G
[43:02] Guided by the word not by emotion not by
[43:04] politics not by our feelings and not
[43:07] even by our own desires because our own
[43:09] desires would want a better country our
[43:11] own desires would want morality our own
[43:13] desire listen friends uh when you look
[43:15] at when you look at uh when you look at
[43:17] two parties and you look at their
[43:19] platform and you look at what they stand
[43:20] for how can you not like
[43:22] policies on the right how can you not
[43:25] how can you disagree with a strong
[43:27] National border how can you dis agree
[43:29] with parental rights to make decisions
[43:31] about gender choices for their children
[43:34] how can you not agree with how can you
[43:35] not agree about religious liberty how
[43:37] can you not agree about economic plans
[43:39] it it there's so many things that in the
[43:42] natural sense we would agree with and
[43:44] see as right and good and in line with
[43:47] what is
[43:48] righteous but don't forget the deception
[43:51] is always what's close not what's far
[43:53] away so be very very careful that we
[43:56] don't attach our El to something amen
[43:58] that is claiming to be able to do
[44:00] something that God said's not
[44:04] possible God sent us a prophet for a
[44:07] reason he opened our eyes for a reason
[44:09] to keep us free to be a free people and
[44:12] to stay
[44:15] free so so praise God that's so I you
[44:20] know when this all started opening up
[44:22] and I went to prayer I said God I don't
[44:23] want to preach
[44:25] this and I I did I got got on my knees
[44:27] in my office I said God if I if I could
[44:29] preach something else please I don't
[44:31] want to preach this because people have
[44:33] opinions and they have passions and they
[44:35] feel strongly about things we all
[44:39] do listen I would love to see an America
[44:43] where my
[44:45] grandchildren could have more of what I
[44:47] had as a child and some of you who are a
[44:50] generation or two before me who wouldn't
[44:53] love
[44:54] that who wouldn't love more freedom more
[44:58] Liberty who wouldn't love more peace
[45:01] more
[45:02] Prosperity more of a chance to spread
[45:04] the gospel who wouldn't love that the
[45:08] problem is America condemned
[45:12] herself she rejected Christ the Judgment
[45:15] has been pronounced she can't turn
[45:21] back so I want to stay with the words
[45:24] and I want to stay with God's Prophet
[45:26] right
[45:30] amen he says America God Bless America
[45:33] it's a nation it's a Christian country
[45:35] it's a million miles from being a
[45:37] Christian
[45:38] country that was 1965 we're 60 years
[45:42] later
[45:43] almost she's a million miles from being
[45:46] a Christian country I don't even pray
[45:48] for it how can I pray for it and it
[45:52] won't repent under the mighty powers of
[45:54] God demonstrated before and denying the
[45:56] closing the doors to it and walking away
[45:58] I committed to God and she is going
[46:00] further away and now she is going to
[46:02] sink Just Watch What
[46:05] Happens amen am all I know is just to
[46:09] show you what he
[46:12] said
[46:14] said this is out of the church age book
[46:16] again then in the sixth Vision there
[46:19] arose up in America most beautiful but
[46:21] cruel woman she held the people in her
[46:23] complete power I believe that this was
[46:25] the rise of the Roman Catholic Church
[46:27] though I knew it could possibly be a
[46:29] vision of some woman rising in great
[46:31] power in America due to the popular vote
[46:33] by women so this is the church age book
[46:38] this is what's been edited proof read
[46:39] published then in
[46:41] 1965 and when brother bham got to the
[46:44] church age book he didn't draw a
[46:48] conclusion he said I believe that this
[46:50] was the rise of the Roman Catholic
[46:52] Church though I knew it could possibly a
[46:54] vision of some woman rising in great P
[46:56] America to the popular vote of women so
[46:59] if brother brandham didn't make it one
[47:00] or the other then I'm not going to
[47:03] either right God will God God will
[47:08] interpret prophecy by bringing it to
[47:10] pass we don't have to figure it out and
[47:12] and the reality is it may have already
[47:14] come to pass it may be coming to pass
[47:17] currently it may come to pass it may
[47:19] have come past in a fashion it may be a
[47:20] shown in a form it may have a greater
[47:22] fulfillment we don't
[47:24] know all we know is it's the truth amen
[47:27] amen God's in charge of the God's in
[47:30] charge of the Fulfillment not
[47:32] me amen so I want to I'm going to I'm
[47:35] going to take and and and and just
[47:38] quickly go through a lot of the things
[47:39] brother Brenham said about this six
[47:41] Vision because being in the message
[47:43] we've heard a lot of things and a lot of
[47:45] people have said a lot of things and
[47:47] I've got several quotes starting from 56
[47:49] the first time that I found him
[47:50] mentioning it was in 55 and it's amazing
[47:53] that this brother bam starts to talk
[47:55] about this six vision amen at the same
[47:58] time uh at the same time America
[48:01] rejected the
[48:03] gospel it's almost like they begin
[48:05] running on Parallel tracks the rejection
[48:07] of the Gospel brought judgment judgment
[48:09] came because the rise of the
[48:12] woman the immorality the the the all the
[48:15] things that came with that amen will
[48:18] bring about the
[48:20] Judgment okay so we're just going to
[48:22] read through like I said we're going to
[48:23] read through a bunch of of what uh
[48:26] brother says and it's not all in
[48:28] chronological order so I'm not going to
[48:30] I'm not going to recite the year every
[48:31] time and in the title just you can see
[48:33] it up there but in 1956 he said I
[48:35] predict that women would keep
[48:37] demoralizing and the nation would keep
[48:39] falling and they'd keep hanging to
[48:41] mother or like mother like that till
[48:43] they become a woman till they become a
[48:45] woman become an idol and after a while
[48:48] that America would be ruled by a woman
[48:50] mark it and see if it's not right a
[48:52] woman will take the place of a president
[48:54] or something of great some high power in
[48:57] America now I I want you I just want to
[49:00] lay this in as we read through this
[49:03] remember brother Brenham saw this as a
[49:05] vision and brother brandom is trying to
[49:08] understand what he
[49:09] saw but it's apparent that the vision
[49:12] didn't have
[49:14] labels so I hope you understand that
[49:17] because through all of this he says a
[49:19] president or something or like a
[49:21] dictator or he says in one place like a
[49:23] great Queen he saw something he he's
[49:26] trying to interpret what he saw but what
[49:29] he saw didn't have
[49:34] labels are we okay with
[49:37] that so he himself is not drawing
[49:40] conclusions he said it could be this or
[49:43] this it could be this or
[49:45] that he just knows that it's it's a
[49:48] woman rising to power for sure in
[49:51] America and then after that America's
[49:54] annihilated okay so follow with me me he
[49:58] said women are taking over of course
[50:00] that's just the trend of the prophecy of
[50:01] the day that this nation is a woman's
[50:03] Nation it'll be run by a woman and
[50:05] remember in 1933 I saw that come in a
[50:08] vision a great powerful woman will take
[50:10] over the whole nation someday that's
[50:12] exactly right before the end time before
[50:15] total
[50:17] Annihilation
[50:19] amen says and I said remember in that
[50:22] day before the end time comes before the
[50:24] end time comes that a woman now you keep
[50:27] this wrote down there'll be a great
[50:28] powerful woman rise up either be
[50:30] president or dictator or some great
[50:33] powerful woman in the United States and
[50:34] shall sink under the influence of women
[50:36] now you remember that's thus sayeth the
[50:38] Lord so here again it's evident brother
[50:41] Brenham saw something in a vision but
[50:42] the vision didn't have a label so he
[50:45] can't say it's for sure a president he
[50:47] said it could be a dictator or something
[50:49] some great
[50:50] powerful he saw
[50:52] it that's why he saw it and he's not
[50:55] even sure if it's spiritual related to
[50:57] the church or if it's physical or if
[51:00] it's both if it's a president or a
[51:04] dictator or some great power he just saw
[51:08] it and it's the
[51:10] truth the reason I'm saying this friends
[51:12] the reason I'm showing you this is
[51:14] because if brother brandham never pinned
[51:16] it down and said it's this this and this
[51:18] it'd be foolish for us to do that be
[51:21] very foolish for us because he's a
[51:23] prophet operating with a prophetic gift
[51:24] and he's the one who saw the vision we
[51:26] didn't
[51:27] we didn't even see what he saw and we're
[51:30] trying to interpret what somebody else
[51:31] saw based off things he said but the
[51:33] things he said were inconclusive in many
[51:36] areas we would be foolish to draw our
[51:41] own
[51:44] period And I said it will come to pass
[51:46] before the end time comes that there
[51:48] will be a great woman stand up in the
[51:50] United States because the United States
[51:51] is marked woman her number is 13 she'll
[51:54] rise up either be president or I put in
[51:57] parenthesis perhaps the woman being
[52:00] beautiful and attractive will be the
[52:01] Catholic church but cruel at heart and
[52:03] she'll lead the nation to
[52:06] pollution he says now it said in there
[52:09] at that time there'd be a great woman
[52:11] standup in the United States and she was
[52:13] dressed and beautiful but she was cruel
[52:15] in heart and I got in parentheses on the
[52:17] vision even yellow paper says perhaps
[52:20] the Catholic church so even brother
[52:22] brandham when he saw the vision he wrote
[52:23] it down he put in parentheses himself
[52:25] parentheses perhaps the Catholic
[52:28] Church
[52:30] perhaps and the woman being permitted to
[52:32] vote would help elect the wrong person
[52:34] for this nation and that's what they
[52:37] done exactly now said that would be the
[52:41] beginning what's he talking about that's
[52:43] what they done he's talking about the
[52:44] election of John F
[52:46] Kennedy the first Catholic President and
[52:50] and brother Brenham said you know he
[52:53] goes to the vision he says perhaps the
[52:56] Catholic church and the women being
[52:58] permitted to vote would help elect the
[52:59] wrong person for this
[53:01] nation and that's what they done brother
[53:05] brandham attributes the uh election of
[53:08] John F kinnedy to the vote of the
[53:12] women and crooked
[53:16] voting he
[53:19] does but so it's it's it's corruption
[53:23] and the
[53:24] woman that put him in
[53:27] place and brother bham is looking at
[53:29] this listen brother brandham when he
[53:31] looks at this he's not looking at at at
[53:34] at individuals he's not looking at women
[53:36] as as U inferior no intelligence not
[53:39] you've got to get that out of your mind
[53:41] he's looking at a spiritual principle
[53:43] here this Catholic system came in when
[53:46] did it come in it come after they
[53:48] rejected the gospel in 1956 they
[53:50] rejected the Jubilee of Pentecost and
[53:52] now he said it's going to go downhill
[53:54] from here then just a few years later
[53:56] there's a campaign and in that campaign
[53:58] now women start to show up in Mass to
[54:00] vote amen and the vote of the women and
[54:02] also what what he sees is corruption all
[54:04] of a sudden put what into place it put
[54:06] it empowered the Catholic Church which
[54:09] is the great the the the the vile
[54:11] woman of all the world right and she
[54:15] came in amen she and brother bam listen
[54:18] it's not like the Catholic Church came
[54:19] in and all of a sudden amen they had a a
[54:22] seat in the White House brother brandham
[54:23] seeing it as representation when this
[54:25] president was elected it represented
[54:27] what's happening
[54:29] spiritually and he said now it came in
[54:32] because America turned their back on
[54:34] Christ lost their protection left the
[54:36] word went in the ruin the uprising of
[54:39] women amen begin to start take place
[54:41] this this Revolution was taking place in
[54:43] this area the women light right rights
[54:45] the women Liberation movement the
[54:47] women's rights movement starts
[54:48] increasing and increasing amen and and
[54:51] and they start voting and they vote in
[54:53] mass and it was the woman's vote
[54:56] right that did what brought in the
[54:59] Catholic President it's the woman the
[55:01] woman the woman the
[55:04] woman because the man is Christ the
[55:09] word and that's what was
[55:12] left was the
[55:14] man and when the man was left the woman
[55:17] Rose to power and started accomplishing
[55:19] things on her
[55:21] own it's amazing it's amazing
[55:26] when you know Eden you know the
[55:30] Revelation it becomes so
[55:33] plain becomes so plain spiritually why
[55:36] these things are wrong why they're
[55:38] dangerous why and and I'll say as I've
[55:41] said before it has nothing to do with a
[55:45] man being more intelligent than a woman
[55:47] because there's a lot of you women that
[55:49] absolutely could blow me away in
[55:51] Scrabble and trivia and Mathematics
[55:54] and I mean all kinds of things that's
[55:58] not the issue the issue is the spiritual
[56:00] picture of Christ in his bride that's
[56:02] really what God is trying to project and
[56:04] preserve and demonstrate and Satan is
[56:07] corrupting that whole
[56:09] picture that's the real issue behind it
[56:12] all and then he says and he now listen
[56:15] he's referring to the sixth
[56:18] vision and he says they've done that
[56:20] that's what they' done exactly that
[56:22] would be the beginning he saw it coming
[56:25] in right there he saw the coming in of
[56:27] the Fulfillment of the sixth Vision
[56:29] right
[56:32] there he goes there is an iron curtain
[56:36] there is a bamboo curtain there is a
[56:38] purple curtain brother don't you fear
[56:40] none of the rest of them but watch that
[56:41] purple curtain she is sitting right
[56:43] there on the throne today in this
[56:47] country you got that this is 1962 this
[56:50] is uh after this is in the presidency of
[56:53] John F Kennedy and he says he's right on
[56:55] the throne to day in this country
[56:57] remember just like Ahab did Jezebel
[56:59] behind him the Bible calls the Catholic
[57:01] Church Jezebel prostitute and Ahab
[57:03] wasn't no bad guy I don't say that Mr
[57:06] Kennedy isn't a nice guy see he's
[57:08] running the parallel friend yeah you
[57:10] can't miss it amen Ahab is not no bad
[57:14] guy Mr Kenny isn't a nice guy I don't
[57:16] know nothing about him he's a man that's
[57:17] all I know he's the president I believe
[57:19] he'll make a good president it's not him
[57:22] it's that system behind
[57:24] him wait till she gets wormed into the
[57:28] cabinet and everywhere she can then oh
[57:32] sorry and and everything she can then
[57:35] watch what happened look what it done in
[57:38] other nations said it come in right
[57:40] there he said that was the beginning and
[57:42] now she's sitting on the throne wait
[57:43] till it gets warmed into the cabinet and
[57:45] I hey hey that's already
[57:47] happened do you know how many high
[57:50] ranking positions are held by Catholic
[57:52] people amen it it's it's astronomical
[57:54] it's in the it's in the supr court it's
[57:56] in the legislative branch it's in the uh
[57:59] uh executive branch all three branches
[58:01] of government have been completely
[58:02] infiltrated by people who are
[58:05] Catholics nothing wrong with the people
[58:07] they may be intelligent they may be
[58:08] doing an excellent job in wherever their
[58:10] place but brother brandom is looking at
[58:12] a spiritual principle behind that amen
[58:14] it's their faith their faith in that
[58:16] Catholic system their attachment to it
[58:18] is showing where the nation is
[58:20] going where she's at and what she's
[58:23] allowed and what's coming in to take
[58:25] control
[58:27] that's what he's saying that's what he's
[58:29] showing us and if it and if it was
[58:31] happening in that day
[58:33] just open your eyes it is all over the
[58:41] place Souls that are in prison now he
[58:44] says them Prophets rebuked The Modern
[58:46] women of their days and they both paid
[58:48] for it by their life history proves that
[58:50] each one of these times was a woman's
[58:52] world when women controled now he's he's
[58:54] showing back uh Jezebel's day is one of
[58:57] the things that he's talking about when
[58:59] women control because Jezebel took
[59:00] control she took authority over Ahab her
[59:02] husband she was the force Power behind
[59:05] his
[59:06] headship so she actually took the head
[59:09] she actually says you lay here in your
[59:13] bed because I've got no confidence in
[59:15] your
[59:16] ability to accomplish this but I Jezebel
[59:20] will accomplish it for
[59:25] you spiritually let's take it to Christ
[59:27] and the
[59:29] church amen uh we've been preaching the
[59:32] same message we've been preaching it for
[59:33] years and years and years but the
[59:35] nation's turning and abortions coming in
[59:37] and there's immorality we've got to do
[59:40] something right why don't you listen to
[59:43] a prophet and preach the true word
[59:44] because the word has the power to change
[59:46] lives not policy not government not not
[59:50] these institutions but why not stick
[59:52] with the headship of the word and
[59:54] believe that the word can do it not
[59:56] treat the word like Jezebel treated Ahab
[59:59] you lay there you're going to stay to
[1:00:01] the side it's fine we'll call you the
[1:00:03] king yeah
[1:00:07] right yeah you can be the king amen but
[1:00:11] I know that you know you're a little bit
[1:00:14] weak and you're not able to accomplish
[1:00:16] this but I know how to get this done I'm
[1:00:18] going to go around through a political
[1:00:19] maneuver which is what Jezebel did she
[1:00:21] went to a political mover and and move
[1:00:24] in a corrupt system through through
[1:00:26] corrupt voting by
[1:00:29] boxes listen I'm not trying to be funny
[1:00:31] it's just it's just
[1:00:34] funny through lies and false testimony
[1:00:38] amen she comes through a political
[1:00:39] corrupt system amen and she uses the she
[1:00:43] uses the legal system of the day amen to
[1:00:45] have this man stoned to
[1:00:50] death and she comes back to AB and says
[1:00:53] Rise Up take nebo's V
[1:00:56] for I have delivered it into your
[1:01:02] hand God hated that so
[1:01:06] bad that Jezebel became the symbol of
[1:01:09] everything Wicked in Fe in a feminine
[1:01:13] race all the way through the rest of the
[1:01:15] Bible she's considered Wicked the poster
[1:01:19] child for a Wicked
[1:01:22] Woman God help us
[1:01:29] so let's keep reading souls are in
[1:01:32] prison
[1:01:33] now paragraph 200 look about today we've
[1:01:37] had one president one of the one of
[1:01:40] these days look like could happen right
[1:01:42] now actually she is president he's just
[1:01:46] a
[1:01:49] figurehead uh stop with me for a minute
[1:01:52] let's put on our spiritual jackets
[1:01:56] he's talking about JFK's wife jacqulyn
[1:01:59] Kennedy and he says she's actually the
[1:02:01] president now we're going to read what
[1:02:03] the rest he's saying she's not in the
[1:02:05] oval off office writing and signing her
[1:02:07] name and and writing out legislation and
[1:02:09] passing executive orders that's not what
[1:02:11] he's talking about but watch what he
[1:02:14] says actually she is president he's just
[1:02:17] a
[1:02:18] figurehead here not long ago in one of
[1:02:20] the other nations she was getting so
[1:02:22] much praise and everything from all the
[1:02:23] people till the president himself said
[1:02:26] I'm her husband the president of the
[1:02:28] United States see she sets the Fashions
[1:02:31] the women follow it see just like
[1:02:33] Jezebel did you heard my sermon on
[1:02:36] Jezebel religion you know you know about
[1:02:38] it you see where we're
[1:02:42] at listen brother Brenham never had
[1:02:46] anything against John F Kennedy and he
[1:02:49] had nothing against Jacqueline
[1:02:52] Kennedy in fact she was probably a fine
[1:02:55] woman and she probably was a good mother
[1:02:58] and it seems like so from testimonies
[1:03:00] and things we heard that she was a fine
[1:03:02] person brother it's not that's not what
[1:03:04] he's talking about he's looking at
[1:03:06] something take place on the on the
[1:03:08] worldwide stage and he's recognizing
[1:03:10] that this has everything to do with the
[1:03:12] uprising of the feminine
[1:03:14] spirit and it's
[1:03:17] wrong until she gets more attention than
[1:03:19] the president till she has more
[1:03:21] influence over fashion and over things
[1:03:23] than the president has and brother brand
[1:03:25] can look at it and say that's
[1:03:28] wrong listen brother BR was still a
[1:03:30] human being remember when remember when
[1:03:33] jonath Kennedy was assassinated brother
[1:03:35] brenon was in meetings and he had the
[1:03:37] whole congregation
[1:03:38] stand and pray for Jacqueline Kennedy
[1:03:42] and for her kids he said I disagreed
[1:03:45] with the man he said but nobody deserves
[1:03:47] to be shot down like that and leave that
[1:03:48] poor woman in those poor children listen
[1:03:50] brother Brenham had no beef against any
[1:03:53] people and neither do we right there's
[1:03:56] fine people everywhere tremendous people
[1:03:58] people that I would love to spend time
[1:04:00] with we're not talking about people in
[1:04:01] these movements people in these camps
[1:04:03] people who are doing it's not
[1:04:06] people it's
[1:04:08] spirits that are moving and influencing
[1:04:11] and trying to take
[1:04:13] control amen so brother REM says now
[1:04:18] actually she's president like what a
[1:04:21] statement he's just a
[1:04:23] figurehead but she wasn't signing policy
[1:04:26] she wasn't changing laws it wasn't that
[1:04:29] she became the influential figure for
[1:04:31] the
[1:04:33] women here's a picture of
[1:04:35] her brother B could see this picture and
[1:04:38] he could recognize we're in
[1:04:42] trouble this is not Dwight Eisenhower's
[1:04:47] wife the previous president she looked
[1:04:49] like a
[1:04:51] grandma he recognized they rejected
[1:04:54] Christ in 195 56 come in 57 preaching
[1:04:58] that the the judgment is coming then in
[1:05:00] 19 uh60 they elect a Catholic president
[1:05:04] he's a young man he's attractive with a
[1:05:07] young wife she's attractive and now
[1:05:08] she's setting the fashion for the ladies
[1:05:11] amen and and brother B says this country
[1:05:13] is in big
[1:05:18] trouble I thought this picture was very
[1:05:20] fitting because all eyes are on
[1:05:24] her amen she's like a queen nothing
[1:05:27] wrong with the woman but brother Brenham
[1:05:29] saw this and he typed it with Ahab and
[1:05:34] Jezebel he saw the moving of the
[1:05:36] Catholic church and he saw it being
[1:05:38] manifest in the rise of the women in
[1:05:43] America it's amazing
[1:05:45] friends I'm so thankful for a prophet
[1:05:48] who will just say what he sees amen he
[1:05:51] won't he won't sugarcoat it he won't
[1:05:54] even sometimes fully explain you just
[1:05:55] say it yeah and we can come back years
[1:05:58] later and read and says he was exactly
[1:06:00] right he was spot on he knew exactly
[1:06:03] what he was talking about if he could
[1:06:05] see that there and call it what it was
[1:06:07] there what about advancing at 60 years
[1:06:09] and we say oh my goodness he was he was
[1:06:11] more right maybe than he knew I don't
[1:06:13] know but he was more right than I knew
[1:06:15] right right he was
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:20] now he goes on and say but there will be
[1:06:22] a powerful woman now remember this is on
[1:06:25] tape to a powerful woman great woman
[1:06:27] she'll either be president or it'll be a
[1:06:30] woman representing the Catholic Church
[1:06:31] which I think it is I love I love
[1:06:35] this some people will go and say well
[1:06:38] brother R said I think it is so that's
[1:06:39] what it is but he never said that's what
[1:06:42] it is he said which I think it is right
[1:06:46] and listen don't get nervous I'm not
[1:06:47] pulling a conclusion I'm just telling
[1:06:49] you what he said we just want to see
[1:06:51] what he said really what I hope at the
[1:06:53] end of the day is you don't draw any
[1:06:54] conclusion you just move forward in the
[1:06:56] gospel and move forward with the word
[1:06:57] and let things transpire the way they're
[1:06:59] going to
[1:07:03] transpire he
[1:07:05] said uh it'll be a woman representing
[1:07:07] the Catholic Church which I think it is
[1:07:10] will take over here someday and she'll
[1:07:11] rule this country this nation is a
[1:07:14] woman's Nation flag was made by a woman
[1:07:16] it's number 13 she started out 13 stars
[1:07:19] 13 stripes 13 colonies everything's 13
[1:07:22] 13 13 right on down 13 stars on her
[1:07:26] silver dollar now everything's at 13
[1:07:28] it's number 13 and appears in the 13th
[1:07:30] chapter of
[1:07:31] Revelations completely 13 everything is
[1:07:34] a woman woman woman woman right on
[1:07:38] down and she took over all the offices
[1:07:41] she took over Hollywood she's took over
[1:07:43] the Nations she's took over the offices
[1:07:45] she's took over everything there is
[1:07:47] equal rights with the man votes with the
[1:07:49] man cusses like a man drinks like a man
[1:07:51] anything else and just bait for the
[1:07:53] Catholic church for the worship of
[1:07:57] woman brother brandom could see what was
[1:08:00] behind
[1:08:01] it from that time he says I don't I
[1:08:06] won't have time in this meeting to tell
[1:08:08] you in 1933 this is a woman's Nation
[1:08:10] it's the number 13 it appears in the
[1:08:12] 13th chapter of Revelation 13 stars 13
[1:08:15] stripes everything's a 13 everything is
[1:08:18] a woman and remember thus sayeth the
[1:08:21] Lord there'll be a woman rule before the
[1:08:23] end time she'll either be president vice
[1:08:26] president or it'll be the Catholic
[1:08:28] Church as a
[1:08:29] woman I've seen her yeah he saw it in
[1:08:33] Vision I seen her a great woman the
[1:08:36] nation bowed to her it'll be one before
[1:08:39] the end time thus sayith the Lord write
[1:08:41] it down and find out you young people
[1:08:44] see if it happens if it isn't I'm a
[1:08:47] false
[1:08:48] prophet so brother Brenham knew he knew
[1:08:52] there was a woman going to rise to power
[1:08:54] Amen brother bham still when he's making
[1:08:56] quotes all the way through he's still
[1:08:58] not solid whether it's the Catholic
[1:08:59] Church whether it's a woman rising in
[1:09:02] power it's a woman representing the
[1:09:04] Catholic Church there's so many ways
[1:09:05] that you could think about this and say
[1:09:07] well is is it is it this or is it that
[1:09:10] or is it this but he knew it was going
[1:09:13] to
[1:09:14] happen and listen in this quote he says
[1:09:17] she'll either be president vice
[1:09:19] president or to be the Catholic Church
[1:09:22] well we've already had a woman Vice
[1:09:24] President we
[1:09:26] now and look at this picture I that
[1:09:29] picture is amazing the capital building
[1:09:32] all the flags and here's a woman rising
[1:09:35] to great power second in command now I
[1:09:39] don't think she's the Fulfillment of the
[1:09:40] vision so don't don't get
[1:09:43] nervous but it is a
[1:09:46] fulfillment of the vision it may not be
[1:09:50] the culmination it may not be imperfect
[1:09:52] display it may not be in the fullness of
[1:09:54] what it will be
[1:09:56] but it's what the prophet told us that
[1:09:58] women are rising in power taking over
[1:10:00] all the offices and one day she'll be in
[1:10:03] great power that's
[1:10:06] true and don't get excited either I'm
[1:10:08] not predicting that Kamal is going to
[1:10:09] win the election I have no
[1:10:11] idea when everybody you listen to says
[1:10:14] it's a coin toss but I've learned I
[1:10:15] don't believe anything I hear
[1:10:17] anyways I have no
[1:10:19] idea I mean I it's beyond me and I'm I'm
[1:10:23] out of the prediction business I quit I
[1:10:25] turn turned in my whatever you have to
[1:10:26] turn in my certificate that I made
[1:10:28] myself I'm done I have no idea so don't
[1:10:31] get nervous I don't know what will
[1:10:33] happen tomorrow but I'll tell you this
[1:10:35] what happens on Tuesday not tomorrow
[1:10:37] Tuesday is
[1:10:41] inconsequential it'll either be the
[1:10:43] Fulfillment it'll be a further
[1:10:45] fulfillment it'll be representing the
[1:10:47] Fulfillment I don't know what it will be
[1:10:49] but nothing's going to stop this
[1:10:51] prophecy and the prophecy's already
[1:10:52] working brother benam said it began when
[1:10:54] the woman vote elected John FK and when
[1:10:57] they worm their way into the cabinet and
[1:10:58] the woman rising in power and taking
[1:11:00] over the office say Hey listen we're
[1:11:02] already in the sixth
[1:11:04] Vision we may not have come to the
[1:11:06] completion we may not know any more
[1:11:07] details or what it will look like
[1:11:09] exactly at the End Amen but listen hey
[1:11:11] it's already happening all around us
[1:11:13] folks and it's going to continue to
[1:11:16] happen what I don't want the church to
[1:11:18] do what I don't want to do myself is I
[1:11:21] don't want to come Tuesday and all of a
[1:11:22] sudden that we hear uh uh we hear that
[1:11:25] uh uh uh Trump was elected president and
[1:11:27] somebody say we got four more
[1:11:30] years wrong thinking friends that's the
[1:11:33] wrong thinking amen because we don't
[1:11:36] listen I I uh I don't know how to say
[1:11:38] all these things but they're in my heart
[1:11:40] but you just pull and I'll just speak
[1:11:42] and I'll try not to speak too fast
[1:11:43] because I'll say it wrong there's
[1:11:45] nothing in the seven visions that say
[1:11:47] that the bride has to be on earth and
[1:11:49] the Fulfillment of the seven Visions
[1:11:50] that's because the seventh vision is the
[1:11:53] annihilation of America by nuclear bombs
[1:11:56] and brother Brenham said they won't fall
[1:11:59] until the bride is gone so we won't be
[1:12:01] here for the Fulfillment of the seventh
[1:12:04] Vision who says that we'll be here for
[1:12:06] the Fulfillment of the sixth Vision if
[1:12:08] we even know what the Fulfillment of the
[1:12:09] sixth vision
[1:12:11] is true it could transpire at the
[1:12:14] beginning of the tribulation period
[1:12:15] after the church is caught away I don't
[1:12:17] know but we know for for sure it's on
[1:12:20] the Move we know for sure the spirit's
[1:12:23] moving we know for sure we're in the
[1:12:25] sixth vision and it will be fulfilled
[1:12:28] exactly the way God intended and exactly
[1:12:30] the way he showed the
[1:12:32] prophet
[1:12:34] amen and
[1:12:37] so if you think well we got four more
[1:12:41] years then then you don't understand
[1:12:43] what spirit's working in
[1:12:47] politics don't dare think that until we
[1:12:51] see a woman as President we can't go in
[1:12:54] in the change of the body don't don't
[1:12:55] think like that brother B didn't tell us
[1:12:58] that in fact that's not what we're
[1:13:00] looking for to have
[1:13:02] faith brother Brenham said that the
[1:13:04] faith that will come for rapturing Grace
[1:13:06] came in the sounding of the seven
[1:13:08] Thunders the opening of the seals that
[1:13:11] was what woke the bride up that's the
[1:13:12] bride's Revival that's what connected
[1:13:14] her back to her bridegroom Christ and
[1:13:16] that's what woke her up and stood her on
[1:13:17] her feet and that's what's lifting her
[1:13:19] off this Earth word by word am so don't
[1:13:23] think wrong thoughts yeah just let God
[1:13:26] manifest himself and let God bring it to
[1:13:28] pass so don't think we got four more
[1:13:31] years we may not have four more
[1:13:38] days praise God that gets me giddy when
[1:13:42] I think like
[1:13:46] that
[1:13:48] amen look at this
[1:13:50] quote said I saw a great woman standing
[1:13:53] up beautiful looking dressed in real
[1:13:55] Royal purples like like purple you see
[1:13:57] how she was
[1:13:58] inaugurated so many people say well
[1:14:00] that's the Fulfillment well I it it's a
[1:14:03] fulfillment yeah I don't know that I
[1:14:06] could say that's the Fulfillment but
[1:14:07] that's definitely in line with some
[1:14:09] things brother Venom said yeah for sure
[1:14:12] High Royals like purple and I got little
[1:14:15] priny saying she had a she was a great
[1:14:17] ruler in the United States perhaps the
[1:14:18] Catholic Church a woman some woman I
[1:14:21] don't know her to be the Catholic church
[1:14:23] I don't know I can't say
[1:14:25] only thing I seen I seen the woman that
[1:14:27] was
[1:14:28] all I love how honest the prophet is he
[1:14:32] himself is not saying it's this or it's
[1:14:34] that he said I think it's this but I
[1:14:36] don't
[1:14:37] know he even tells us uh uh uh not in
[1:14:42] this quote but in another one that he
[1:14:44] believes it to be the Catholic church
[1:14:46] but then he comes in this quote and says
[1:14:47] I don't know her to be the Catholic
[1:14:49] church I don't know I can't say only
[1:14:52] thing I know is this was what I saw and
[1:14:54] it's true yeah and it'll happen praise
[1:15:00] God and broken system he said then I
[1:15:02] said I seen a woman stand in the United
[1:15:04] States like a great queen or
[1:15:06] something and she was beautiful to look
[1:15:08] at but Wicked in her heart and she made
[1:15:11] the nation go at her step so brother
[1:15:14] Bron listen he says she's a president a
[1:15:17] v or a vice president or a dictator or
[1:15:20] some great power or like a
[1:15:23] queen cuz the vision didn't have labels
[1:15:26] yeah right he saw it he knew it to be
[1:15:29] true he tried to describe to us what he
[1:15:31] saw but we didn't see what he
[1:15:33] saw but it's taking place all around us
[1:15:38] it's happening day by
[1:15:41] day it's moving in the sixth
[1:15:46] Vision praise
[1:15:49] God souls are in prison he says but
[1:15:52] there she stands there she is that's her
[1:15:55] preach the word handle the word become a
[1:15:58] goddess and the cause of every sin Bible
[1:16:01] said I suffer not a woman to teach or to
[1:16:03] usurp any Authority but to be in
[1:16:05] obedience as also sayith the law and she
[1:16:07] can't do it but they make her ruler of
[1:16:10] the land mayor Governor soon she'll be
[1:16:12] president sure there you are that's the
[1:16:14] way that's the way it goes
[1:16:18] see you know let's just do some wh
[1:16:23] ifs I know that's
[1:16:25] dangerous you're probably thinking
[1:16:27] that's
[1:16:28] dangerous what if vice president Harris
[1:16:31] wins the
[1:16:33] election what changes for you and
[1:16:35] I what changes in our
[1:16:39] Revelation what changes in God's plan
[1:16:42] amen what if she doesn't win the
[1:16:45] election what changes for you and
[1:16:49] I is brother BR more right or less
[1:16:53] right what is she win the election and
[1:16:55] she serves a term and at the end of the
[1:16:58] term she loses the next election and a
[1:17:00] man comes
[1:17:03] in and what if he serves four years or
[1:17:06] eight years and then and then uh he
[1:17:10] comes out of office and then a second
[1:17:12] woman is
[1:17:14] president what if time goes on for 20 30
[1:17:17] some more years and we wind up with a
[1:17:19] third woman President
[1:17:23] right what are we going to believe
[1:17:24] believe then the same thing we believe
[1:17:28] today probably more of it amen with more
[1:17:31] manifestation and more power in our Liv
[1:17:34] amen this isn't time to be children but
[1:17:37] it's time to be
[1:17:39] mature right let God what brother B
[1:17:42] didn't tell us is not for us to try to
[1:17:45] figure
[1:17:46] out what he did tell us was going to
[1:17:48] carry us through whatever happens
[1:17:51] next amen
[1:17:58] said in this is out of the church age
[1:17:59] book from the tharan church age the
[1:18:01] tharan church age was the the peak of
[1:18:03] the Catholic church and its political
[1:18:06] and and uh demonic power as it ruled the
[1:18:09] known world at that time before the
[1:18:11] Reformation he says from the Garden of
[1:18:13] Eden onward woman has constantly and
[1:18:16] successfully tried to take control over
[1:18:18] the man and right today it is a woman's
[1:18:21] world and the goddess of America being a
[1:18:23] naked female
[1:18:25] as the female Idol F out of the sky
[1:18:27] remember her arms were iron bars
[1:18:29] characterized the first or Ephesian
[1:18:31] Church age that's Diana the Goddess
[1:18:33] Diana so her power has grown until she
[1:18:35] has gained absolute Authority such
[1:18:37] Authority being usurped by her iron
[1:18:41] disposition now a woman is not meant to
[1:18:43] have an iron disposition she is
[1:18:45] according to the holy scriptures to be
[1:18:47] submissive to the male that is commanded
[1:18:50] of her woman who is truly female all
[1:18:53] female will be of that
[1:18:56] disposition not a doormat no real man
[1:19:00] makes a female a doormat but she will
[1:19:02] want to be under Authority and not rule
[1:19:04] over the male for he is the head of the
[1:19:07] house if she breaks that image that God
[1:19:09] made for her she is perverted any male
[1:19:12] that lets the woman take authority has
[1:19:15] also broken the image and he is
[1:19:18] perverted that is why a woman cannot
[1:19:20] wear that which pertaineth to a man or
[1:19:22] cut her hair she is never to wear
[1:19:24] garments that pertain to a male or cut
[1:19:26] her hair when she does she's intruding
[1:19:28] into the male domain taking Authority
[1:19:30] and perverting
[1:19:31] herself and when a woman invades the
[1:19:34] pull pit which she's commanded she must
[1:19:36] not do she shows what Spirit she is of
[1:19:39] being a dominant female is
[1:19:45] Antichrist and the seeds of the Roman
[1:19:47] Catholic Church are in her though she
[1:19:50] may deny this ever so vehemently but
[1:19:53] when it comes to the word let God be
[1:19:55] true and every man's word a
[1:20:03] lie oh
[1:20:06] man I left out a
[1:20:08] quote but don't worry I have my
[1:20:16] notes there was something else brother
[1:20:18] Bram said in the thot Church
[1:20:20] age actually I may have read
[1:20:22] it I just may not have under LED
[1:20:27] it I don't think
[1:20:29] so all
[1:20:33] right yeah here it
[1:20:37] is he says it's most worthy of
[1:20:41] note oh I lost it yeah this is same
[1:20:44] thing out of the tharan church age it is
[1:20:47] most worthy of note that the very name
[1:20:50] thotti means dominating
[1:20:52] female thus this age is characterized by
[1:20:56] a dominant force a force that ruthlessly
[1:20:59] invades all conquers all and
[1:21:01] despotically controls now listen now a
[1:21:05] dominating female is the greatest curse
[1:21:08] in the
[1:21:11] world Prophet says it in the church age
[1:21:14] book a dominating female is the greatest
[1:21:17] curse in the world why is it the
[1:21:19] greatest curse in the world because it's
[1:21:20] what caused the fall in the
[1:21:23] beginning when the woman left the
[1:21:25] headship of the word and she by
[1:21:26] reasoning began to dominate and began to
[1:21:29] lead the way to fulfill the word through
[1:21:31] reasoning and through her own effort she
[1:21:35] became dominant she was deceived in
[1:21:38] doing it then but she still did it and
[1:21:41] now a dominating female is I'll read it
[1:21:45] again a
[1:21:47] dominating female is the greatest curse
[1:21:51] in the
[1:21:53] world that's why when brother bham saw
[1:21:55] what was happening all around him he
[1:21:58] knew that this was wrong it was a
[1:22:01] Jezebel spirit was coming from the
[1:22:03] Catholic church and it was going to
[1:22:05] produce what it was going to
[1:22:07] produce so then he goes on to say being
[1:22:11] a dominating female is
[1:22:14] Antichrist because it's completely
[1:22:16] contrary to the
[1:22:18] scriptures that's what's so wrong with
[1:22:20] it it's not that that these women are
[1:22:24] Baden women it's not that people who
[1:22:25] don't know and are living in ignorance
[1:22:27] and they have no idea it's not that
[1:22:29] they're bad people that's not the issue
[1:22:31] the issue is that a dominating female is
[1:22:34] Antichrist it's off the
[1:22:37] word and when men begin to cater to that
[1:22:41] woman because uh uh for whatever reason
[1:22:44] there's a there's a myriad of reasons
[1:22:46] but a lot of time it's just the
[1:22:47] weakening of man it's an Ahab nature
[1:22:49] that comes in and and and I'm I'm not
[1:22:51] even going to take the time to get into
[1:22:53] that but anyways I want to but I'm
[1:22:55] not but what happens is now she Rises
[1:22:58] the power to accomplish what she
[1:23:00] perceives her male of not being able to
[1:23:07] accomplish and that's
[1:23:10] Antichrist because God is the father
[1:23:13] Christ is the Son and he's the
[1:23:15] bridegroom he's the husband he's the
[1:23:18] male his church is the
[1:23:22] female that's why
[1:23:26] that's why I say whatever happens on
[1:23:27] Tuesday is
[1:23:30] inconsequential because either we'll see
[1:23:32] a greater manifestation by by actually
[1:23:35] having the Fulfillment of a woman
[1:23:37] president showing that we're further
[1:23:38] down the
[1:23:39] road or we'll have this system on the
[1:23:45] right that is
[1:23:47] religious and churches Binding Together
[1:23:50] to support grassroot ever it's still the
[1:23:53] woman yeah
[1:23:55] amen
[1:23:57] right because the
[1:24:00] churches are trying to move policy the
[1:24:03] churches are trying to save
[1:24:04] America
[1:24:07] right because apparently the gospel
[1:24:13] can't because they got weak in the pull
[1:24:16] pits and they left the headship of the
[1:24:17] word and started injecting their own
[1:24:19] thinking there's no power in the pull
[1:24:20] pits to change lives now so what they've
[1:24:23] gone is they moved to politics ICS to
[1:24:24] try to move policy so that they can so
[1:24:27] they can still be effective and have a
[1:24:30] Christian
[1:24:31] Society it is a jezebel move it is
[1:24:35] Antichrist it is off the word it is
[1:24:37] completely wrong and it doesn't matter
[1:24:39] how nice it sounds we want to fight
[1:24:41] abortion abortion is wrong we want to
[1:24:43] fight I mean this gender uh neutrality
[1:24:45] that's wrong amen we want to stand up
[1:24:47] for the rights of Paris that control it
[1:24:48] that's that's right amen they're right
[1:24:50] in all of that they're wrong in the
[1:24:52] method they're doing it if you want do
[1:24:54] it do it by the word and by the
[1:24:56] preaching of the word that's the right
[1:24:58] way because that puts Christ back in
[1:25:01] headship and puts you back under
[1:25:03] submission and makes him the head him
[1:25:05] the leader him the king not a figurehead
[1:25:08] King we love Jesus and we love the word
[1:25:10] but we've got the of our own power and
[1:25:12] our own wisdom and of Our Own Strength
[1:25:13] find a way to accomplish the word
[1:25:15] because simple preaching and believing
[1:25:17] of the word is not enough
[1:25:21] anymore amen so
[1:25:25] listen we're
[1:25:27] here the dominating female is
[1:25:32] controlling amen remember the deception
[1:25:35] is not what's far away the deception is
[1:25:37] what seems good and is similar and
[1:25:41] people won't understand why you
[1:25:43] believing in these things won't join
[1:25:47] Force they might even ask you do you
[1:25:49] believe abortion is wrong yes I believe
[1:25:50] it's wrong do you believe it's right for
[1:25:53] parents to have control yes I believe
[1:25:55] that do you believe that that this and
[1:25:57] that and the other yeah I believe all of
[1:25:58] that then why aren't you with
[1:26:02] us right why won't you join forces why
[1:26:05] won't you help
[1:26:08] us if you're not for us you're against
[1:26:14] us the whole thing setting
[1:26:17] up for what brother B told us is going
[1:26:20] to happen the church is controlling
[1:26:22] politics and one day she'll show how
[1:26:23] great that control
[1:26:26] is it's all in the church age
[1:26:30] book they say what happens Tuesday is
[1:26:33] inconsequential to the sixth Vision the
[1:26:35] sixth vision is manifesting
[1:26:37] itself all around
[1:26:40] us
[1:26:43] amen the word is so
[1:26:46] good that's
[1:26:48] why the
[1:26:52] the the you say the religious right
[1:26:55] let's just say
[1:26:57] that amen they believe that they're
[1:27:01] doing God a
[1:27:02] service but it's without being God's
[1:27:04] will amen right it is
[1:27:08] Jezebel trying to overcome and Conquer
[1:27:12] for Ahab because Ahab
[1:27:16] can't and you know what they're blind to
[1:27:19] it they're blind to it but blindness has
[1:27:23] come because they're f fathers rejected
[1:27:25] the
[1:27:27] message and it happened in Israel over
[1:27:30] and over and over again destruction came
[1:27:33] because the fathers rejected the
[1:27:34] prophet's message now the children were
[1:27:37] brought up under that and they were
[1:27:38] blind and they went further off and
[1:27:40] destruction came right their fathers
[1:27:44] rejected the
[1:27:45] message and now the church systems are
[1:27:48] binding themselves together with the
[1:27:50] Catholics listen now it's amazing now
[1:27:53] you want talk about dropping
[1:27:55] denominational barriers they're dropping
[1:27:57] denominational walls so fast they don't
[1:27:59] care if you're Catholic Methodist pres
[1:28:00] they could care less let's all get
[1:28:02] together and fight this thing yeah
[1:28:08] right Jezebel Jezebel Jezebel and the
[1:28:12] spirit behind it brother B said a
[1:28:16] dominating female has the seeds of the
[1:28:19] Catholic church in
[1:28:21] her it's the Catholic it's the same
[1:28:24] Spirit that's in the Catholic church
[1:28:25] that's in the
[1:28:28] Protestants let's read that let's go to
[1:28:30] Revelation
[1:28:38] 17 Revelation
[1:28:48] 17 Revelation 17 1-9
[1:28:57] before we read this don't read this yet
[1:28:59] I shouldn't had you turn there but just
[1:29:00] things keep
[1:29:02] coming we don't believe in male
[1:29:05] leadership in the church because males
[1:29:06] are better than women we believe in male
[1:29:09] leadership in the church because the
[1:29:10] word says
[1:29:12] so we don't believe that men should
[1:29:14] preach and women not preach because men
[1:29:15] are better preachers than women actually
[1:29:18] I heard a woman preach one time and she
[1:29:20] was
[1:29:22] good yeah
[1:29:25] it's the
[1:29:28] truth but it's because the word says
[1:29:31] so men don't take dominion and Authority
[1:29:34] in their home because they're better
[1:29:35] smarter wiser stronger than their wives
[1:29:38] that's not why they do it because the
[1:29:39] word says
[1:29:41] so we can go through all kinds of
[1:29:43] attributes and start showing how the
[1:29:44] male is bigger and he's this and he's
[1:29:46] got this nature she's nature all of
[1:29:47] that's true but at the end of the day it
[1:29:49] doesn't matter what excuse you come up
[1:29:51] with or what reasonings we don't need
[1:29:52] any reasonings the word say says so the
[1:29:55] word says a man is leader in his home
[1:29:57] the word says the preaching of the
[1:29:59] Gospel is done by men the word says amen
[1:30:01] the officers in the church should be men
[1:30:03] the word
[1:30:06] says and the word is our headship the
[1:30:08] word is Christ amen and if we don't want
[1:30:11] to be Jezebel we better stay under the
[1:30:14] word amen do you know that John Wesley
[1:30:16] was one who started promoting women
[1:30:21] preachers here's the reason he said if
[1:30:24] we equip more people to go out amen
[1:30:26] we'll get more work done and we'll get
[1:30:28] more Soul
[1:30:29] saved what was that human
[1:30:32] reasoning the same thing that caused the
[1:30:35] Fall In the Garden of Eden but the word
[1:30:37] said she couldn't
[1:30:41] yeah why do we do what we do cuz the
[1:30:43] word says so it doesn't make sense it
[1:30:46] doesn't have to make sense I don't have
[1:30:49] to prove that you know I'm stronger than
[1:30:51] my wife and I have more endurance so
[1:30:53] I'll go to work and she'll stay home
[1:30:55] listen my wife has way more endurance
[1:30:57] than I
[1:30:58] have especially when we raising little
[1:31:00] babies I could not do sleepless nights
[1:31:02] and work all day and take care of them
[1:31:03] and nap and listen she had way more
[1:31:06] endurance than
[1:31:07] me so let's stop looking at these gender
[1:31:10] things and reasonings and scientific we
[1:31:13] don't need any explanation all we need
[1:31:15] is the word the word is why because
[1:31:17] Christ said so and that's enough for the
[1:31:19] bride we don't need anything
[1:31:22] else that's what frustrates me so bad
[1:31:25] with trying to apply apologetics to the
[1:31:26] message and trying to reason and
[1:31:28] understand and debate with the
[1:31:29] denominations all we need is to know
[1:31:31] that this is thus sayeth the Lord that a
[1:31:33] prophet was Vindicated he brought us the
[1:31:35] true interpretation of the word I don't
[1:31:37] need apologetics I don't need reasonings
[1:31:39] I don't need to prove it to
[1:31:41] anybody God's not asking me to do that
[1:31:44] he's asking me to Simply believe him and
[1:31:46] let him be the headship let the revealed
[1:31:48] word of the hour be the
[1:31:51] headship quit trying
[1:31:54] because brother brandham didn't say it
[1:31:56] well enough and he
[1:32:00] didn't just let the headship
[1:32:03] decide who he wanted to use and how he
[1:32:05] wanted to say
[1:32:09] it praise
[1:32:11] God Revelation
[1:32:15] 17 go to verse
[1:32:20] one Revelation 17:1 and there came one
[1:32:22] of the seven angels which had the seven
[1:32:24] vials and talked with me saying unto me
[1:32:26] come hither and I will show unto thee
[1:32:28] the Judgment of the great that sth
[1:32:30] upon many Waters with whom the kings of
[1:32:33] the Earth have committed fornication and
[1:32:34] the inhabitants of the Earth have been
[1:32:36] made drunk with the wine of her
[1:32:38] fornication so he carried me away in the
[1:32:40] spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a
[1:32:41] woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast
[1:32:43] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[1:32:46] heads and 10 horns and the woman was AR
[1:32:48] raay in purple and scarlet color and
[1:32:50] decked with gold and precious stones and
[1:32:52] Pearls having a gold golden cup in her
[1:32:54] hand full of the Abominations of the
[1:32:56] filthiness of her
[1:32:57] fornication and upon her forehead was a
[1:32:59] name written mystery Babylon the great
[1:33:03] the mother of harlots and the
[1:33:05] Abominations of the earth she's a woman
[1:33:08] and she's a mother and their children of
[1:33:10] the Protestant
[1:33:12] churches and they're harlots it's the
[1:33:15] same thing they become the same thing
[1:33:16] their mother
[1:33:18] is and I saw the woman drunk with the
[1:33:20] blood of the Saints and with the blood
[1:33:21] of the martyrs and of Jesus the martyrs
[1:33:24] of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered
[1:33:27] with great
[1:33:28] admiration when John saw this it was
[1:33:31] beautiful it was
[1:33:33] spectacular it wasn't hideous and ugly
[1:33:35] and Despicable
[1:33:37] and it was beautiful it was admirable it
[1:33:42] was probably
[1:33:46] tremendous so we have to be careful when
[1:33:49] it looks good
[1:33:51] sometimes and the angel said unto me
[1:33:53] where therefore D thou Marvel I will
[1:33:55] tell thee The Mystery of the woman and
[1:33:57] the Beast that carried her which had the
[1:33:58] seven heads and the 10
[1:34:00] horns the Beast that thou saw us was and
[1:34:03] is not and shall Ascend out of the
[1:34:04] bottomless pit and go into predition and
[1:34:06] they that dwell on the Earth shall
[1:34:07] wonder whose names were not written in
[1:34:09] the Book of Life from the foundation of
[1:34:11] the world when they behold the Beast
[1:34:13] that was and is not and yet is and here
[1:34:16] is the mind which hath wisdom the seven
[1:34:18] heads are seven mountains on which the
[1:34:20] woman sth so we know that this is Rome
[1:34:23] and we know the Rome we know that Rome
[1:34:25] was the fourth Empire of the great
[1:34:27] Gentile world domination and that that
[1:34:31] that uh system of Rome actually never
[1:34:34] morphed into a new system it just became
[1:34:36] the paple system but it was based on the
[1:34:38] same system and running on the same
[1:34:40] power of the system of Rome and now it's
[1:34:43] infiltrated the whole world Amen even
[1:34:47] the United States of
[1:34:49] America So This
[1:34:52] Woman This scripture says here the last
[1:34:56] the verse 18 and the woman which thou
[1:34:58] sawest is that great city which reth
[1:35:00] over the kings of the
[1:35:04] earth who Reigns over the kings of the
[1:35:06] earth who's controlling
[1:35:09] politics it's the
[1:35:12] woman she has the gold of the world
[1:35:14] she's behind the scenes pulling strings
[1:35:16] she's moving that's why we're seeing
[1:35:18] women rise into Power it's a
[1:35:21] manifestation of what's going on
[1:35:22] spiritually
[1:35:26] she's controlling the world and one day
[1:35:29] it's going to become
[1:35:32] obvious but that's not God's
[1:35:35] way do you know who this is this is
[1:35:38] Satan's
[1:35:41] bride not God's
[1:35:44] bride Satan's bride is getting involved
[1:35:47] in
[1:35:48] politics Satan's bride has left the
[1:35:50] headship of the word of Christ and
[1:35:52] trying by her own way and her own
[1:35:53] mechanisms to force and have dominion
[1:35:56] and force what she believes to be true
[1:35:59] yeah to control people through law and
[1:36:02] legislation it's the same thing the
[1:36:05] Catholic Church did yeah amen I hope you
[1:36:07] can see it right this religious sweeping
[1:36:11] on the right uh uh in America it seems
[1:36:13] so good it's following the footsteps of
[1:36:16] the Catholic church because when the
[1:36:17] when the Catholic Church came into power
[1:36:20] under Constantine and generations after
[1:36:22] they begin to use the power of the state
[1:36:24] to enforce their own rules yeah right
[1:36:28] and that's the same thing the religious
[1:36:30] right in America is trying to do they're
[1:36:32] trying to use the power of the state to
[1:36:34] enforce their rules what they believe is
[1:36:36] moral what they believe is right what
[1:36:38] they believe is the
[1:36:41] word it's the same thing it's the same
[1:36:44] spirit it's the Catholic Spirit the
[1:36:46] Catholic Church spirit it's the spirit
[1:36:48] of Jezebel it's the great and the
[1:36:51] harlots moving with the same exact agend
[1:36:54] doing it the same
[1:36:57] way but that's not how the bride
[1:37:01] works this is actually what I want to
[1:37:04] end with when we see a woman's World
[1:37:07] brother say women on the Rampage woman
[1:37:09] everywhere It's A Woman's World woman's
[1:37:10] become the idol and he makes all of
[1:37:12] these big statements and if you just
[1:37:14] listen if you just take a statement
[1:37:16] brother Brenham said and and and you can
[1:37:18] be somewhat offended because no don't be
[1:37:20] offended just try to see what he's
[1:37:22] seeing
[1:37:25] amen women on the Rampage women's right
[1:37:28] now she can vote and brother REM said
[1:37:30] that was a horrible
[1:37:32] thing when women was given the right to
[1:37:36] vote and if somebody questions you and
[1:37:38] Corners you on that and tries to get you
[1:37:40] to explain why it was and you move to
[1:37:42] reasoning you're going to be like well
[1:37:44] because the Simplicity of it is is she's
[1:37:47] supposed to be under headship and her
[1:37:48] husband's the one who should be voting
[1:37:50] he decides for the home she doesn't need
[1:37:53] to decide because she has a husband who
[1:37:56] decides when women were getting the
[1:37:58] right to vote they were given the power
[1:38:00] to choose differently than their
[1:38:03] husbands and that was the empowering of
[1:38:06] the women into independence from male
[1:38:09] leadership and that's what voted in JFK
[1:38:12] and brought in the Catholic
[1:38:14] Church you say they shouldn't vote they
[1:38:16] don't understand the issues they don't
[1:38:20] read that's not going to work today
[1:38:25] why was it a horrible thing they vote
[1:38:27] because it was empowering them to
[1:38:29] operate independent of the headship God
[1:38:31] put them
[1:38:33] under and that's
[1:38:38] Antichrist it's amazing
[1:38:40] friends it's
[1:38:43] amazing God has a different way for
[1:38:46] us we're going to look at a few
[1:38:48] scriptures
[1:38:49] Now 1 Peter 3:1 likewise you wise being
[1:38:53] subjected ction to your own husbands
[1:38:55] that if any obey not the word they also
[1:38:57] May without the word be won by the
[1:38:59] conversation of the wives while they
[1:39:02] behold your Chase conversation coupled
[1:39:03] with fear whose adorning let it not be
[1:39:06] the outward adorning of plating the hair
[1:39:07] wearing of gold or putting on of apparel
[1:39:10] but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:39:11] heart and that which is not corruptible
[1:39:13] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[1:39:15] Spirit which is in the sight of God a
[1:39:18] great price for after this manner in the
[1:39:20] old time the holy women also who trusted
[1:39:22] in God Adorn War themselves being in
[1:39:24] subjection unto their own husbands even
[1:39:27] as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord
[1:39:30] whose daughters you are as long as you
[1:39:32] do well and not afraid with any
[1:39:35] amazement when Peter picks this up he
[1:39:38] calls this good that Sarah obeyed
[1:39:41] Abraham calling him
[1:39:45] Lord listen we we we all know of people
[1:39:49] or heard of people I don't actually know
[1:39:50] of anybody but heard of people that
[1:39:52] would try to take a scripture like this
[1:39:53] and abuse it in some way for a man in
[1:39:56] some way to take ungodly
[1:39:59] dominance but that's wrong that's also
[1:40:02] not
[1:40:03] Christ but it's still the truth yeah
[1:40:08] because the women should be Sarah's
[1:40:11] daughters that means coming after Sarah
[1:40:13] and the example of Sarah who obeyed
[1:40:16] Abraham calling him
[1:40:19] Lord God loves submission and obedience
[1:40:24] he loves
[1:40:26] it God loves the feminine
[1:40:29] attribute God loves
[1:40:31] it God is expressed in masculine and God
[1:40:35] has expressed himself in feminine and
[1:40:38] God loves both yeah and when God
[1:40:41] separated the feminine out of Adam in
[1:40:43] the beginning God intended for those two
[1:40:45] to stay separate and operate
[1:40:48] separately and he didn't want them to
[1:40:49] change their own Natures he wanted them
[1:40:51] to stay the way they are and that's
[1:40:54] Godly that's what he wants amen that's
[1:40:57] what he wants
[1:40:59] today Satan is a great perverter of the
[1:41:03] word in Titus 2 it says the aged women
[1:41:06] likewise that they be in Behavior as
[1:41:07] becoming Holiness not false accusers not
[1:41:09] given them much wine teachers of good
[1:41:11] things that they may teach the young
[1:41:13] women to be sober to love their husbands
[1:41:16] to love their children to be discreet
[1:41:19] chased keepers at home good obedient to
[1:41:23] their own husbands that the word of God
[1:41:25] be not
[1:41:28] blasphemed so we hear many times that
[1:41:30] the aged women should teach the younger
[1:41:31] women but but Paul's very specific in
[1:41:34] what they should be teaching them yeah
[1:41:36] right that's why I don't believe in
[1:41:37] women L Bible studies she's not supposed
[1:41:41] to break the word she's not supposed to
[1:41:43] teach the word but he said the aged
[1:41:45] women should teach the younger woman
[1:41:46] what should they teach the younger women
[1:41:48] they should teach them how to be sober
[1:41:50] to love their husbands to love their
[1:41:52] children to be be discreet chaste
[1:41:54] keepers at home obedient to their own
[1:41:57] husbands not what happened in the Garden
[1:41:59] of Eden not godhead not what you
[1:42:04] understand teach them how to be
[1:42:07] feminine how to be a woman according to
[1:42:10] the
[1:42:11] scriptures that's what they're to teach
[1:42:14] them 1 Corinthians 11:3
[1:42:17] but says but I would have you know that
[1:42:21] the head of every man is Christ and the
[1:42:22] head of the woman is the man and the
[1:42:24] head of Christ is God every man praying
[1:42:26] or prophesying having his head covered
[1:42:28] dishonor his head but every woman that
[1:42:30] prayeth or prophesy with her head
[1:42:31] uncovered dishonor her head for that is
[1:42:34] even all one as if she were shaven for
[1:42:36] the woman be not covered let her also be
[1:42:38] shorn but if it be a shame for a woman
[1:42:40] to be shorn or shaven let her be covered
[1:42:42] for a man indeed ought not to cover his
[1:42:44] head for as much as he is the image and
[1:42:46] glory of God but the woman is the glory
[1:42:48] of the man for the woman is not of the
[1:42:51] for the man is not of the woman but the
[1:42:52] woman of the man neither was the Man
[1:42:56] created for the woman but the woman for
[1:42:58] the man for this cause ought the woman
[1:43:01] to have power on her head because of
[1:43:04] angels this is why a woman doesn't cut
[1:43:07] her
[1:43:09] hair the same thing I remember in the
[1:43:12] past when he talked to me we try to
[1:43:13] reason this
[1:43:14] out there's no
[1:43:16] reasoning because she's under headship
[1:43:19] and God wants her to have a sign of
[1:43:20] power on her head that she's under
[1:43:21] headship which is uncut hair yeah it's a
[1:43:25] covenant it's a covenant with her
[1:43:27] husband and a covenant with her father
[1:43:29] that she's under another headship and
[1:43:31] that's the headship of her
[1:43:34] husband you remember when Samson Samson
[1:43:37] was under a covenant is that right he
[1:43:40] was under a Nazarite vow and a Nazarite
[1:43:42] vow is a vow of Separation unto God and
[1:43:44] one of the signs of that Nazarite vow
[1:43:46] was he had uncut
[1:43:48] hair and his uncut hair represented his
[1:43:53] consecration to God yeah a woman's uncut
[1:43:56] hair represents her consecration to her
[1:43:59] headship her
[1:44:00] husband all
[1:44:02] right when they wanted to find Samson's
[1:44:08] power they started saying Delila the the
[1:44:12] false Church started playing around with
[1:44:13] this power what where is your power does
[1:44:16] it where does it lie and he says if you
[1:44:18] uh bind me with ropes and he broke the
[1:44:20] ropes and bind me with green WID broke
[1:44:22] the green wids if you weave my hair he
[1:44:23] broke those but in the fourth he says if
[1:44:26] you cut my hair no Razor's ever been put
[1:44:29] to my head amen and when his hair was
[1:44:32] cut listen how significant it is when
[1:44:35] his hair was cut it showed that he had
[1:44:38] broke his vow of consecration to God God
[1:44:41] was no longer his
[1:44:44] headship and when his hair was cut his
[1:44:47] power was
[1:44:49] gone right
[1:44:54] this is why the churches have no
[1:44:57] power because they've cut off their
[1:45:02] hair and I don't mean you go into a
[1:45:04] church and physically see women with
[1:45:05] short hair I mean they have cut off
[1:45:08] their consecration to God they haven't
[1:45:09] stayed consecrated to this word yeah and
[1:45:12] they have cut off their hair and they
[1:45:15] have no
[1:45:17] power if we want Power if we want real
[1:45:21] power how do we have power let's let the
[1:45:24] Seven Locks grow back
[1:45:27] out right amen Samson now in the church
[1:45:31] AG is grinding away at the Mill his eyes
[1:45:33] have been pled out plucked out he has no
[1:45:35] vision he's weak he's grinding away and
[1:45:37] grinding away but something happens
[1:45:39] those Seven Locks come back the word
[1:45:41] starts to be restored he comes back
[1:45:43] under a vow of consecration which was
[1:45:46] what he was born
[1:45:48] for and when his hair grows back amen he
[1:45:51] prays the parents says once more and
[1:45:53] then the power comes back oh I want to
[1:45:55] have that kind of power the power wasn't
[1:45:58] in Samson the power was in The Vow the
[1:46:00] consecration the dedication to God Amen
[1:46:03] where is our power our power is not in
[1:46:05] ourselves not in our minds not in our
[1:46:07] wisdom not in our intellect it's not in
[1:46:10] anything we have our power is in our
[1:46:12] consecration to God staying under the
[1:46:15] headship of Christ the manifested word
[1:46:17] in this hour the restored word is our
[1:46:19] bridegroom the revealed word and when we
[1:46:22] come back back to a consecration under
[1:46:24] the Seven Seals to this word the power
[1:46:27] comes back what power the power to
[1:46:29] defeat the enemy of the church and the
[1:46:32] enemy of the church is compromised amen
[1:46:34] the enemy of the church is this great uh
[1:46:36] and Harlot system that's trying to
[1:46:39] get us to move by
[1:46:40] reasoning intellect by our own power to
[1:46:44] do something
[1:46:47] ourselves oh the word has come back the
[1:46:52] bridegroom is here here how will the
[1:46:54] bride manifest herself not when she
[1:46:57] figures out what she can do she'll
[1:46:59] manifest herself by coming back under
[1:47:01] that
[1:47:06] headship the tharan church age says and
[1:47:11] this th tyan Church age she is a
[1:47:13] dominating female she's mystery Babylon
[1:47:15] she's the great she is Jezebel the
[1:47:17] false prophetess why because the true
[1:47:21] female is submissive to God who wants to
[1:47:24] be the true female amen Christ is her
[1:47:28] head she has no word but his no thought
[1:47:30] but his no leadership but his that's the
[1:47:34] true female that's the
[1:47:37] bride Jehovah Gyra he says a woman it's
[1:47:41] her nature of a woman to surrender to a
[1:47:43] man and it's the nature of the church to
[1:47:46] surrender to Christ surrender to his
[1:47:48] will Just Surrender she has no thinking
[1:47:51] of her own she takes his word were not
[1:47:53] somebody else's if Eve would have done
[1:47:55] that we'd have never had to die but she
[1:47:58] listened to reasonings but the real
[1:47:59] bride of Christ takes the headship of
[1:48:01] Christ the word and only believes God's
[1:48:04] word that's the real the restored
[1:48:08] bride you know what we see on display
[1:48:10] today this is we've come to Satan zeden
[1:48:12] we've come to the end of the seventh
[1:48:13] Church age we've come to the Pinnacle
[1:48:15] the completion the
[1:48:17] fullness and what you see is two
[1:48:21] women the rise of two
[1:48:24] women one is a false Church
[1:48:27] system amen you're going to just say
[1:48:30] Catholic church now it's the Harlot and
[1:48:31] her daughters yeah and this false system
[1:48:35] is Rising by grabbing Power by
[1:48:38] exercising Authority by manipulation by
[1:48:42] by reasonings by education by debate by
[1:48:45] all these things she's grabbing power
[1:48:47] she's doing what Jezebel did grabbing
[1:48:49] power trying to trying to find a
[1:48:51] position try to your position try to
[1:48:53] bring dominance try to bring rule that's
[1:48:55] the other one that's that's Satan's
[1:49:00] bride but what is Christ bride doing
[1:49:04] seeing how little she can
[1:49:07] become cu the Way Up Is
[1:49:10] Down not to figure out not to have any
[1:49:14] method of her own or any plan of her own
[1:49:16] or Nothing what how is she coming into
[1:49:19] this position how is power coming back
[1:49:21] by saying well that's what the word says
[1:49:25] right why do you do this and that that's
[1:49:27] what the word says why don't you do this
[1:49:28] that's what the word says what what
[1:49:31] don't you have any of your own thoughts
[1:49:33] no this is what he said his thoughts are
[1:49:35] my thoughts don't you have your own will
[1:49:37] no I've surrendered my will his will is
[1:49:40] my
[1:49:41] will amen that's the true bride that's
[1:49:44] the feminine Spirit true woman and she
[1:49:47] wants to be under the headship of a man
[1:49:49] and this man is Christ Jesus the word
[1:49:55] praise
[1:49:56] God says therefore it's the word or
[1:49:59] nothing that's right he the word how do
[1:50:01] you know it's right he the word is
[1:50:03] Vindicated see he the word properly
[1:50:05] Vindicated is the headship the head of
[1:50:08] the church he is the word the headship
[1:50:11] he properly identif identificate
[1:50:14] identified Vindicated by his own spirit
[1:50:17] being in the church itself the person
[1:50:19] showing forth himself in Vindication is
[1:50:21] the direct proof to the entire body you
[1:50:24] don't need Creeds then denominations has
[1:50:26] perished but the headship itself
[1:50:28] recognized in the body by personal
[1:50:31] identification see identifying himself
[1:50:35] proves the headship to the body then we
[1:50:37] are united under one Vindicated headship
[1:50:41] that is Christ the word of
[1:50:45] God then our headship is a kingdom and
[1:50:49] the kingdom of God is within you said
[1:50:52] the Bible Jesus the kingdom you are not
[1:50:54] a de denomination we belong to a kingdom
[1:50:57] and the kingdom is the word of God made
[1:51:00] spirit and life in our life bringing to
[1:51:02] pass every promise in this day as it did
[1:51:05] in the day when the word in God was one
[1:51:07] and the word and God is one in his
[1:51:09] church today making it the headship of
[1:51:11] the body that is redeemed to bring the
[1:51:13] message in the last day and be taken up
[1:51:16] from the dead in the resurrection to go
[1:51:18] back and restore again as Adam and Eve
[1:51:20] in the beginning In the Garden of Eden
[1:51:22] the three-fold mystery of God his body
[1:51:25] oh
[1:51:26] my what's the manifestation today A
[1:51:29] submissive
[1:51:31] woman what's he trying to show the bride
[1:51:34] of Christ Jesus Christ in Bride form
[1:51:37] Jesus Christ in his church Jesus Christ
[1:51:39] in the bride manifesting what a
[1:51:42] submissive woman
[1:51:45] am not like the Jezebel yeah the
[1:51:50] submissive woman doesn't have to give in
[1:51:54] answer the submissive woman doesn't have
[1:51:57] to
[1:51:58] understand the submissive woman doesn't
[1:52:01] have to protect herself the submissive
[1:52:03] woman doesn't have to come up with
[1:52:05] contingency plans that's her husband's
[1:52:09] job that's his
[1:52:12] responsibility he's my husband I don't
[1:52:14] have to figure out I don't have to solve
[1:52:16] the equation I don't have to defend
[1:52:17] myself I don't have to protect myself
[1:52:19] all that he's asked me to do is stay
[1:52:20] under his headship he'll take care of
[1:52:22] every everything
[1:52:25] else what if the World falls apart what
[1:52:28] if the government collaps what if all of
[1:52:30] this so
[1:52:32] what so what if the World falls
[1:52:36] apart so what if the economy collapses
[1:52:39] so what if the government's in shambles
[1:52:41] so what if America's Fallen bankrupt and
[1:52:43] destitute so what what does that change
[1:52:45] for the bride she still has a husband
[1:52:47] who's promised to provide for all his
[1:52:49] needs he still has the power of the
[1:52:51] spoken word he can put in your lips and
[1:52:53] create squirrels if you need squirrels
[1:52:55] you can still walk on water at his
[1:52:57] bidding amen you can still change the
[1:52:59] storm when he commands you to change it
[1:53:01] not what you do brother brandom said now
[1:53:03] remember that was given by permission
[1:53:06] that wasn't me doing that that was him
[1:53:08] telling me to do that don't you worry
[1:53:11] one bit amen Christ is in his bride and
[1:53:14] whatever she has need of he can supply
[1:53:16] by telling you now it's time to speak
[1:53:19] not what you do not what you say not
[1:53:21] your will not your desire not your
[1:53:24] manipulation none of that it's a
[1:53:26] complete surrender when brother Brandon
[1:53:28] manifests the the power of the spoken
[1:53:30] word amen he manifest it by total
[1:53:34] submission the most powerful thing that
[1:53:37] we have seen on the earth is a man with
[1:53:39] the power of the spoken word to create
[1:53:42] something from
[1:53:44] nothing amen amen not by repeating what
[1:53:47] God says but by God saying what you
[1:53:50] say by per Mission now the power of the
[1:53:53] spoken word the power that God alone has
[1:53:56] and Satan doesn't have that power he put
[1:53:58] back into a fallen human being yeah
[1:54:01] who's been redeemed by the blood of
[1:54:03] Jesus Christ who's been claimed under
[1:54:04] the adoption hour and he's put that word
[1:54:06] back in him and now when God says he
[1:54:09] could speak show me something more
[1:54:11] powerful than that and how did he do it
[1:54:13] by complete 100% humility and
[1:54:19] surrender he was in a storm
[1:54:24] he was heading down to Camp because
[1:54:25] you'll die in that kind of
[1:54:29] Blizzard can't survive
[1:54:31] it but a voice says go back where you
[1:54:37] were he stops for a minute says was that
[1:54:42] me doesn't sound
[1:54:46] reasonable go back he stopped and he ate
[1:54:49] a soggy
[1:54:50] sandwich and the voice said go back back
[1:54:53] and he turned around and he went back to
[1:54:55] where he
[1:54:57] was
[1:54:58] listen that was not reasoning that was
[1:55:01] not understanding yeah that was not
[1:55:04] self-preservation that was not self-
[1:55:06] protection right that was death yeah
[1:55:11] amen snowflakes were falling the wind
[1:55:13] was howling if he didn't go now he would
[1:55:16] never find his way off of that
[1:55:19] Ridge but he obeyed
[1:55:22] when he obeyed God come to
[1:55:25] him and God gave him
[1:55:27] permission to speak to the
[1:55:34] storm our power is not in what we
[1:55:37] figured
[1:55:39] out our power is not even seeing what
[1:55:41] brother Brenham did in trying to copy it
[1:55:43] of our own will our own desire not work
[1:55:46] up of emotion and trying to be real bold
[1:55:48] and get ourselves to have some kind of
[1:55:50] human super faith
[1:55:53] the power of the Bride is his power
[1:55:55] through the bride not her power amen the
[1:56:00] overcoming of the Bride is not her
[1:56:02] overcoming it's the Overcomer overcoming
[1:56:04] in her yeah and through
[1:56:08] her so how does she stay in this
[1:56:11] position by being
[1:56:13] gentle quiet
[1:56:16] submissive and
[1:56:19] surrendered she doesn't have to prove
[1:56:21] anything her husband's already proved it
[1:56:22] all and the Vindication of the word and
[1:56:25] the message it's been proved you don't
[1:56:28] have to prove
[1:56:30] it you don't have to defend yourself
[1:56:32] protect yourself provide for
[1:56:35] yourself he's promised to do that for us
[1:56:38] so what is it we do we do an opposite of
[1:56:41] the Jezebel
[1:56:43] systems in the the hour it's become a
[1:56:45] woman's World woman domination woman on
[1:56:48] the Rampage woman this woman that we
[1:56:50] come the opposite yeah yes women show
[1:56:54] flesh we show less
[1:56:57] am they use sexuality we stay
[1:57:01] humble they exert power they create
[1:57:04] dominance they Guilt Trip men into more
[1:57:06] power and more dominance we don't do
[1:57:09] anything but stay under the
[1:57:12] word that's the secret to power
[1:57:19] am he says he is the head his church is
[1:57:22] the body oh God it's the head that
[1:57:25] guides the body let the headship of the
[1:57:27] word guide the body of Christ and may I
[1:57:30] be part of that body
[1:57:33] am this is a just a small excerpt out of
[1:57:37] a message of pick up your pen and write
[1:57:38] when the angel told him to pick up his
[1:57:40] pen and it's a message from the angel of
[1:57:42] the Lord to us to you and
[1:57:45] I those in the bride do only his will no
[1:57:50] one can make them do otherwise
[1:57:53] they have thus sayith the Lord or they
[1:57:55] keep still they know that it has to be
[1:57:57] God in them doing the works fulfilling
[1:57:59] his own word he did not complete all his
[1:58:01] work while in his Earthly Ministry so
[1:58:03] now he works in and through the bride
[1:58:07] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:58:10] for him to do certain things that he
[1:58:12] must now do but he will now fulfill
[1:58:14] through the bride that work which he
[1:58:17] left for this specific time where's the
[1:58:21] power it's coming through the bride is
[1:58:24] it her power no is it her wisdom no is
[1:58:29] it her word no it's his
[1:58:33] amen she's she's going to be an
[1:58:36] invincible
[1:58:37] Army because she knows who she is and
[1:58:40] she stays under the headship of the
[1:58:42] word in this day when women are on the
[1:58:47] Rampage praise God the bride's coming
[1:58:50] into a greater submission
[1:58:53] when it's becoming a woman's world the
[1:58:55] bride is wanting to elevate the man the
[1:58:59] word she doesn't want to dominate she
[1:59:01] doesn't want to hire position she
[1:59:02] doesn't want to control it she doesn't
[1:59:03] want to fix it she just wants to come
[1:59:06] under
[1:59:09] it Luke 14:11 for whosoever exalteth
[1:59:12] himself shall be abased and he that
[1:59:15] humbled himself shall be exalted this
[1:59:19] false Church system is about ready to be
[1:59:22] abased why because it exalted
[1:59:26] itself but the Bride of Jesus Christ who
[1:59:29] abased herself and comes subject
[1:59:31] submissive to the word she's just about
[1:59:33] to be
[1:59:37] exalted he said I want you to know this
[1:59:40] this is sure and you that's listening to
[1:59:42] the tape you might have thought today
[1:59:43] that I was trying to say that about
[1:59:45] myself being that I was packing this
[1:59:47] message I have no more to do with it
[1:59:49] than nothing no more than just a voice
[1:59:52] and my voice against my better judgment
[1:59:54] I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the
[1:59:57] will of my father that I declare to do
[1:59:59] and determine to do I wasn't the one
[2:00:01] that appeared down on the river I was
[2:00:03] only standing there when he appeared I'm
[2:00:06] not the one that performs these things
[2:00:08] and for tells these things that happens
[2:00:09] as perfect as they are I'm only one
[2:00:11] that's near when he does it I was only a
[2:00:15] voice that he used to say it it wasn't
[2:00:18] what I knew it's what I just surrendered
[2:00:21] myself to that he spoke through it isn't
[2:00:24] me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it
[2:00:27] was the manifestation of the son of man
[2:00:29] it wasn't the angel his message it was
[2:00:31] the mystery that God unfolded it's not a
[2:00:33] man it's God the angel was not the son
[2:00:35] of man he was the messenger from the son
[2:00:37] of man the son of man is Christ he is
[2:00:40] the one that you're feeding
[2:00:43] on I think the bride of Christ is going
[2:00:45] to have the same
[2:00:46] testimony after the
[2:00:49] Rapture it wasn't me who got out of that
[2:00:52] predicament it wasn't my wisdom it
[2:00:55] wasn't my understanding it wasn't my
[2:00:57] strength I didn't hold on it wasn't my
[2:00:59] grit it wasn't my willpower it wasn't my
[2:01:01] determin it wasn't me I was just there
[2:01:03] when he did it it was all him he must
[2:01:08] now fulfill in and through the bride
[2:01:11] that which he he fulfill his power his
[2:01:15] works that he left for this
[2:01:18] time he doesn't need us to do he needs
[2:01:21] us to surrender
[2:01:23] he doesn't need us to to come up with a
[2:01:25] plan to work what the message isn't able
[2:01:28] to
[2:01:30] do doesn't need us to have wisdom to
[2:01:32] solve problems that the message can't
[2:01:34] solve that the word isn't have power so
[2:01:37] we have to come up with another program
[2:01:39] we don't need that friends that'll bring
[2:01:41] death what we need is to stay under the
[2:01:44] headship of Christ the revealed word our
[2:01:47] bridegroom and everything will work out
[2:01:51] just fine
[2:01:53] there's two women Rising one's Rising by
[2:01:57] force by dominance she's going to be a
[2:01:59] based but there's another one who's just
[2:02:03] waiting on her
[2:02:04] Lord and she's going to be exalted but
[2:02:07] not by her own efforts not by her own
[2:02:09] doings not by anything she did but
[2:02:12] brother Brenham tells her he says but
[2:02:14] their Folly will be made manifest when
[2:02:16] Jesus takes his bride and sets her up
[2:02:18] here and said this is her and the way he
[2:02:21] goes with her that's right and their
[2:02:23] Folly would be made known I don't know
[2:02:26] what that will look like in physical
[2:02:28] manifestation but I know it'll be him
[2:02:30] doing it he will lift her up she won't
[2:02:33] lift herself
[2:02:35] up he says in Revelation 3 to him that
[2:02:38] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[2:02:40] in my throne even as I also overcome and
[2:02:42] him sat down with my father in his
[2:02:44] throne that false system thinks she's
[2:02:47] the queen of heaven but she's going to
[2:02:49] be cast down but there's a humble
[2:02:52] missive woman on the earth called The
[2:02:53] Bride of Jesus Christ who's going to
[2:02:55] stay surrendered to the word and she may
[2:02:58] look weak she may look defeated she may
[2:03:01] look like
[2:03:03] Samson little wimpy
[2:03:06] Samson grinding at the Mill led to the
[2:03:09] pillars by a
[2:03:11] child but she's under a vow of
[2:03:13] consecration she's under a Nazarite vow
[2:03:16] to
[2:03:16] Christ and God can accomplish through a
[2:03:20] submissive vessel
[2:03:22] that which he left for this day to
[2:03:25] finish what will it be I don't know but
[2:03:28] brother B said don't look for big things
[2:03:30] just surrender to God and let God do
[2:03:32] what God wants to do
[2:03:35] am
[2:03:37] oh I'm I'm going to finish right here I
[2:03:40] think this is my last one or two
[2:03:44] quotes I'm going to skip this
[2:03:47] one 1 Peter 5 5-7 likewise you younger
[2:03:52] yourselves into the other y all of you
[2:03:53] be subject one to another and be clothed
[2:03:56] with humility for God resisteth the
[2:03:58] proud and giveth grace to the humble
[2:04:01] humble yourselves therefore under the
[2:04:02] mighty hand of God that may he may exalt
[2:04:05] you in due time casting all your care
[2:04:08] upon him for he carth for
[2:04:12] you that's good instruction for the
[2:04:14] bride of Christ in the end time just
[2:04:16] humble yourself under the mighty hand of
[2:04:19] God and he will exalt you in good times
[2:04:23] he's promised to he's got a seat in his
[2:04:26] throne waiting for his bride she's going
[2:04:29] to rule and reign with him he's got a
[2:04:31] position that's already secure we don't
[2:04:33] have to try to secure it we don't have
[2:04:35] to prove it we don't have to fix we
[2:04:38] don't have to do we have to
[2:04:41] surrender
[2:04:43] yield that's why when I started looking
[2:04:45] at this for this little discussion I
[2:04:47] wanted to have tonight it just popped
[2:04:49] and blew and blew and blew
[2:04:52] I see two women the Bride of Satan and
[2:04:55] the bride of Christ and they can't be
[2:04:57] any more different than night is from
[2:05:00] day and I want to be completely
[2:05:05] different God help us to be completely
[2:05:10] different right I'm not depending on
[2:05:12] politics I'm not depending on a
[2:05:14] government I'm not depending on finances
[2:05:16] I'm not depending on Bank notes I'm not
[2:05:18] depending on insurances I'm not
[2:05:20] depending on Military
[2:05:22] I'm depending on his word the person of
[2:05:25] the word which is my bridegroom Jesus
[2:05:27] Christ my confidence is in him and if
[2:05:31] everything falls apart everything is
[2:05:33] right on
[2:05:34] time I don't need to fix it through Manu
[2:05:37] political Maneuvers I just need to rest
[2:05:40] and let him my Lord my headship my
[2:05:43] husband my bridegroom my lover take care
[2:05:47] of
[2:05:48] me now can you see why whatever happens
[2:05:51] Tuesday is
[2:05:53] inconsequential the woman's running the
[2:05:55] show and she's going to run it to Falls
[2:05:58] to a complete collapse and an
[2:06:01] Annihilation says brother brandom
[2:06:04] America is going to be destroyed but
[2:06:06] thank God I won't be here for the
[2:06:09] destruction not because I'm smart not
[2:06:12] because I have determination not because
[2:06:15] I have willpower but because I have
[2:06:17] faith that he's called me to a different
[2:06:19] calling and I want to surrender
[2:06:24] the Way
[2:06:25] Up Is
[2:06:28] Down surrender submission humility will
[2:06:33] win the day yes amen let's all stand

[2:06:54] on this Earth that can declare it to us
[2:06:57] and that you've given us eyes to see and
[2:06:59] ears to hear and Lord I just pray that
[2:07:01] you would continue to give us the isab
[2:07:03] of your word to remove the scales so
[2:07:05] that we can clearly see what we're
[2:07:08] facing God I pray that you would help us

[2:07:13] longing
[2:07:14] for well the first woman failed Every

[2:07:39] fear so that we're not motivated by fear
[2:07:42] or fear of man or fear of what man can
[2:07:44] do and we're not motivated by pride of
[2:07:46] who we are and what we look like but
[2:07:48] we're only motivated by one thing and
[2:07:49] that's love that we could surrender and
[2:07:52] love you and see you as you are and
[2:07:54] receive your perfect love for us and
[2:07:56] reflect back a perfect love to

[2:08:07] Lord we see the world falling apart and
[2:08:09] we can't do anything to fix it it's
[2:08:12] falling apart because your judgments are
[2:08:14] Unleashed upon it Lord because they've
[2:08:16] rejected your your grace your mercy and
[2:08:19] a message of the hour with strong and
[2:08:21] powerful Vindication it's been turned
[2:08:23] aside and
[2:08:26] discredited God we see what's
[2:08:29] happening God we as human beings Lord
[2:08:32] Jesus are subject to the way that the
[2:08:34] world goes in many things and prices and
[2:08:38] and inflation and jobs and all of these
[2:08:42] things they affect us too

[2:08:47] look beyond the natural and see the
[2:08:50] spiritual

[2:09:25] preeminence for your great desire in
[2:09:27] this hour the second fold of your great
[2:09:30] purpose that you want to accomplish is
