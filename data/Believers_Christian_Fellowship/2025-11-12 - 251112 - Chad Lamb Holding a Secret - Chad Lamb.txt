And God, may we all take advantage of the opportunity we have, Lord. And may we give you first place now. May we set you at the head of the table and invite you, Lord, to break the bread. And may we feed from your hand, Lord. And God, may you accomplish your purpose this evening.

We ask that you would do it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you all this evening. While you're standing, if you could just take your Bibles with me and turn to the book of Genesis, Genesis 38. Thank you, musicians. Amen. And uh I I got word from brother Andreas ring and he said he made it home safely and he asked me to give you all his warm greetings. So greetings from brother Andreas. Also I wanted to remind you that brother Jason Dears will be coming in this weekend. He'll be ministering for us this Sunday morning and then he'll also take the youth meeting in the afternoon. So remember to be praying for him as well. And throughout the service you can just keep me in prayer. I've had a lot of pain today. It's been uh getting worse. I got something wrong with the with my jaw on the back part of my jaw and it gets more and more painful. But you know what? I don't care. I'm going to preach anyhow. Amen. So, just pull on the gift and just pray. And Amen. We're not going to let the devil have an easy victory. Amen. We I' I'd rather preach the gospel in pain than not preach it. Amen. So, God bless you all this evening. Let's look here at Genesis chapter 38 verse 11. 38 Genesis 38:1 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow at thy father's house till Sheila my son be grown. For he said, lest per adventure he die also as his brethren did." And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. And may the Lord bless us as we look into his word. Amen. We know the story of Judah and Tamar. And Tamar was a woman that Judah had taken to be wife for his eldest son. And before that, she could conceive, the eldest son was wicked in the eyes of the Lord. And he was killed by the Lord. He was taken. And so she was taken then and given to the second son. And the second son refused to give her seed to raise up seed for his brother. And the Lord was displeased with him. And he was smitten. But then the third son of Judah was too young to marry at that time. So this is the instructions that he gave her to go back to her father's house. And and Judah is a little shy about giving his next son. He's given he's given this woman to two sons and the two sons are dead and now he's got the third and he's trying to protect his heritage, his prosperity here and he doesn't want to lose the third. So he sends her back and tell uh uh Sheila uh my son be grown. He says, "For he said, lest per adventure he die also." So, you can see this move that he's making is a hedging move. He's trying to protect something. Amen. That he doesn't want to lose. And so, he sends her back to her father's house. And then, let's go to uh verse 13. And it was told Tamar, saying, "Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnoth to shear his sheep. and she put her widow's garments off from her and covered her with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to Timnath. For she saw that Sheila was grown and she was not given unto him to wife. So I want you to see the reason that Tamar makes the move she's about to make is because she sees that that what was promised her is not going to happen. That Sheila is of age and now he's grown and she is not given to him to wife. Amen. And so now she's going to take uh uh some action here. Verse 15. When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot because she had covered her face. And and he turned into her by the way, and said, "Go to I pray thee, let me come in unto thee, for I know not," he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, "What willil thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me?" And he said, "I will send thee a kid from the flock." And she said, "Wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send him?" And he said, "What pledge shall I give thee?" And she said, "Thy signate and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thy hand." So now she's going and she's playing the part of a harlot. It's it's interesting to note she's not a harlot. &gt;&gt; She's not a harlot. This woman is not a harlot. She's playing the part of the harlot. Amen. Because her right to seed, to bring forth seed has been held, withheld from her. Sheila should have been given to her so that she can raise up seed to their first dead husband. Amen. But now he's refusing this right that she has. And so now she puts off her widow garment. She puts on the the the the attire of a harlot. She goes and sits in the place and she intercepts Judah coming along and they work out this deal where where they agree to the terms and the terms is a kid. But she said, "Will you give me a pledge, a guarantee, something that promises that you'll give me the payment?" And he says, he asked her, "What is it you want?" &gt;&gt; And she said, "I'll take thy signate ring and I'll take thy bracelets and I'll take thy staff." That was her choice. Amen. And he said, "Okay." So, let's go down to verse 24 together. And it came to pass about 3 months after that it was told Judas, saying, Tamar, thy daughter-in-law, hath played the harlot, and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, "Bring her forth and let her be burnt." I want you to look at this in 24. They've already passed judgment on her. &gt;&gt; They've already declared her a harlot. They've already said she's gone into whoredom. And he already pronounces a judgment upon her that she's to be burnt. Now, that's not an improper judgment if she truly played the part of a harlot and was in the whoredom. Amen. But she did nothing wrong. Amen. Let's look here at verse 25. And when she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "By the man whose these are am I with child." And she said, "Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signate and bracelets and staff." Listen, I want you to note, she didn't say, "I'm innocent and it's you." No, she was not one passing judgment. She had no judgment to pass. All she said is, "The man whom I'm pregnant by owns these items. These items belong to him. Now you discern whose items they are." She never took the place of the judge. She's not telling anybody what to do or not to do. All she's SAYING IS, "THIS CHILD that's in me came from the man whose items these are. You discern who they are." And then Joseph said, and Judah says in verse 26, and Judah acknowledged them and said, "She hath been more righteous than I because that I gave her not to Sheila, my son, and who and knew her again no more." So now the judge who judged her a harlot and whoredom to be burnt now passes a different judgment. The one who condemned her, Amen. Whoever brought the report was condemning her already accusing her of being a harlot and and being in whoredom. And he pronounced judgment off the testimony. Amen. And said she'll be burnt. Now the judge, Amen. When he sees the tokens, the items that she has from the man, he says, "She's more righteous than me. &gt;&gt; SHE BECAME MORE RIGHTEOUS than the judge because the judge had judged inappropriately." Amen. Before the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I looked at this, I I looked up these items, the signant, the bracelet, and the staff. And I looked at these some time ago, if you'll remember, we looked at them. But the signant is the signant ring or a signant seal. And this seal is a this seal is a true identification. It was a seal that would be used to seal official documents, letters, and any other documents. It was it would have been Judah's signature. &gt;&gt; They would have done put put some bullion down or some clay or bullion. Later became wax. And they would imprint it with this seal. He could either wear it as a ring or wear it around his neck as a seal and he would seal that and that seal was custom engraved and it would only pertain to Judah. This was his signature. &gt;&gt; So she had his seal and then she had what's called bracelets here in the King James. And I looked this up because it's always it's been a bit of a puzzle to me what this is. And in in many other versions of the Bible it's called cord. A cord or cords. It's translated cord or thread and it comes from the word to twist or that which is twisted. So, this is some sort of cord. This is some sort of twisted cord or item. And I I looked up an article today out of the biblical archaeology magazine and they believe that it was the cord that actually fastened the signate to Judah that that that was fastened him. But there's others with other ideas. I combed through the message and I could not find what brother Brennham said on it. He may have I may have missed it. Amen. But but that's what it is. It's not like dangly bracelets like we're thinking of. It's some sort of cord that was a fashion and it would have pertained to Judah. It was something that was significant and something that was individual to him. Amen. And it may have been the very thing that bound the seal, the thing that that the seal was fastened on. And then when we look at the staff, we know what the staff is, but the staff is a is is like a shepherd's staff. Uh but it also symbolizes a tribe. And this staff for Judah was not just a stick. Amen. It was also a symbol of him as the leader of the tribe of Judah. It was it was his uh authority, his rulership. And it was his signature staff that would have identified him. It wouldn't have been a generic stick. It would have been his staff that people would have known was that's Judah's staff. And it's the staff of the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; Because he's the head of the tribe of Judah. So now with these items, Amen. There's a reason she asked for these things. &gt;&gt; She didn't ask for gold. She didn't ask for silver because she was not a harlot. She did not want money. She did not want payment. She did not want the kid. Amen. Because as soon as he left, she got up, took off of her garments OF A HARLOT, PUT back on her garments of a widow, and went back to her father's house like nothing had happened. She didn't want payment. Amen. She wanted the righteousness of what she was deserving, what she needed. Amen. Was the seed, the promised seed. And when the son was refused to her, SHE WENT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SEEDGIVER, &gt;&gt; which was Judah. So she could, there was no other son, THIS SON WAS WITHHELD. BUT SHE HAD A RIGHT TO that because she was the wife of the firstborn. And because she was wife of the firstborn, when she had the right to bring forth the lineage of Judah, AND WHEN JUDAH HIMSELF IN HIS UNRIGHTEOUSNESS refused her cuz he was trying to save something. Amen. He was getting out of the program of God. But Tamar was getting him back in the program of God &gt;&gt; because she was not, Listen, this was not an act of lust on Tamar's part. &gt;&gt; Tamar wasn't desiring an illicit relationship. She wasn't looking for payment. What she was looking for was her right to bring forth the son to continue the lineage of Judah. And when she even through deception, amen, she, Amen, became the one to receive the seed, what seed did she get? AMEN. COULDN'T PRODUCE IT. On couldn't produce it. Sheila was kept from him. SO SHE GOES BACK to the father and gets the seed originally. AND SHE BRINGS FORTH THE HEIR TO JUDAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SHE BRINGS FORTH THE ONE WHO WILL BECOME THE head of the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; Oh, all of these types are absolutely so beautiful, friend. &gt;&gt; When we when we can pull up the PowerPoint, uh now I I wanted the title holding a secret. This is a thought that was perplexing me last night and uh again this morning. So, this is kind of coming fresh. I had something else on my mind. But you know, who cares about our mind? &gt;&gt; We want the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when I when I was looking at this Tamar when she had done what she did and went back to her father's house and put on the garments of a widow, she had in her possession this seal and this cord, this bracelet and this staff that was all uh uh that was all identified as Judah's Judah's signature, Judah's cord, uh Judah's staff, and and she held in her possession a secret. And that secret would be the secret that would justify her actions. &gt;&gt; What she did looked wrong. What she did looked risky. She took a chance. &gt;&gt; And it was a chance. What if she was discovered? What if Judah found out? What What if What if he lifted her veil? What? She took A CHANCE. SHE BUT something was motivating her. Something was moving her. And friends, I believe it was something more than even something natural inside of her. Amen. Because God was using her to preserve the line of Judah. But he was also using her to show what his bride would be in the last time. Amen. Because this woman had the right to receive the seed. And there's going to be a bride that's got the right to receive the seed. &gt;&gt; And although it looked wrong and many people began to judge Tamar and Tamar was considered a harlot. Amen. She was considered an ill-famed woman in her father's house. No doubt her father was ashamed of her. Her mother was probably ashamed of her. If she had siblings, they were ashamed of her. Who knows what kind of ridicule she had to endure at the time that they found out that she was with child. And we know what their assessment was because that's the message that came back to Judah. And all this time she has to endure all of these things in her ears. You're a harlot. What have you done? Wait till they find out. YOU'RE GOING TO BE JUDGED. You're going to be burnt. BUT THE ENTIRE TIME SHE'S GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING IN HER POCKET. SHE'S GOT A LITTLE STAFF UNDER HER BED. She's got something TO DECLARE, I'M NOT A HARLOT. I WAS NOT WHOREDOM. AMEN. IT WAS MY RIGHTS. AMEN. TO BRING FORTH THE PROMISED SON. &gt;&gt; IT WAS HER POSITION GIVEN TO HER BY GOD. IT WAS HER RIGHT. AMEN. AND SHE WASN'T an ill-fained woman. And she wasn't of bad reputation. AND SHE WASN'T AFTER A lustful relationship. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the evidence of that was the secret that she held &gt;&gt; and nobody else knew about, but she held it. Amen. How could she endure such ridicule and mocking and shame? I mean, we have no record. She fought back. You know, they were saying, "You're a hard." She's not saying, "Uh-uh. No, I'm not." &gt;&gt; Because no one would believe her. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. She's not getting into verbal dialogue back and forth because she is holding in her possession a secret &gt;&gt; and she has to wait for the right time for the right person to be a witness to her secret. She could take out the signate ring early. She could take out the cord early. She could take out and she could say th look at this. Look at what I got. This is from Judah. Hey, listen. They probably would disbelieve her and say, "Where'd you buy that? You bought that out of a trinket shop. You just picked up a piece of wood. You carve something on it." Hey, listen. She wasn't looking to any of them to justify her. She was going back to the original seedgiver, the one she had got the seed from. Amen. And when she was going to be in judgment, amen. She laid out these items now to the one that gave them, the one that they belong to, to the originator of these items. And when she laid them out, she said, "I'm pregnant by the man who owns these. You discern and you tell me." And immediately said, "She's more righteous than I am." &gt;&gt; Oh, friends, we've got a secret. We've got some trinkets that the father has given to us. The one who's planted the seed has given you something. &gt;&gt; And we hold it in secret, friends. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't do ANY GOOD, AMEN. TO try to prove it to anybody else. Proving it to anybody else won't prove anything. People will still deny it. You can say, "Well, I got the Holy Ghost because I did XYZ." They said, "No, that was just emotion." Or, "No, that was just this or that was just that." It doesn't MATTER WHAT ANYBODY ELSE thinks of us. It doesn't matter what anybody else thinks of you. AMEN. YOU TAKE THAT signate ring, the seal, which is the Holy Ghost, AND YOU SHOW IT BACK TO THE PERSON WHO GAVE IT. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's the only ONE WHO CAN JUDGE WHETHER it's the correct seal or not. &gt;&gt; Nobody else can judge. So there's no reason to try to prove it to anybody else. No matter what ANYBODY ELSE SAYS, YOU just keep the secret in your pocket &gt;&gt; and you stand whatever comes your way. Amen. Because of the secret that's within you, the secret that you hold in your possession. what you know to be real and what you know to be true and what you know to be in YOUR POSSESSION. AMEN. THAT'S THE THING that gives you the strength to endure whatever anybody throws your way. &gt;&gt; TAMAR, IT WASN'T HER STRENGTH. IT WASN'T HER WISDOM. IT WASN'T HER ARGUMENTS. AMEN. It was the secret that she was holding. &gt;&gt; That's what gave her the strength to press on. The Bible says in Ephesians, "In whom you also trusted after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory." This is the seal that's been given to us. When we come into union with Christ, it is the seal that he gave us until uh is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession until everything is restored. In this quote, brother said, "And what is the seal of God?" Ephesians 4:30 says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption, not from one revival to another, but eternally sealed until the day that you're redeemed back." Amen. It's this seal that declares you righteous. This is the seal that brings you back to your position. And you get to hold this token. Brother Brennham called it a token. Amen. It was evidence that God gave to you. A token evidence that your fair has been paid. When he saw your faith in his word, he gave you the token as a seal to recognize. Amen. That you believed because Amen. because we believe unto salvation. But when we believe, then he gave us a seal. That's what he did to Abraham. Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness. He was declared righteous. And God gave him a seal of circumcision to seal his faith. When we believe the word of God, God gives us a seal. God gives us a token. And that token is in your possession. &gt;&gt; Now listen, don't try to prove it to another soul. Nobody else will believe you. They may believe you, but it doesn't matter how many people you convince or how many people are not convinced. I want to I just want to go on the record saying if you hold this seal, you're not a harlot. &gt;&gt; You're not involved in whoredoms. You're as RIGHTEOUS AS THE JUDGE IS RIGHTEOUS, YOU'VE NOT DONE anything wrong. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE SINLESS, SPOTLESS, VIRTUOUS BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. ALTHOUGH PEOPLE MAY NOT understand your life and THEY MAY MISJUDGE WHY YOU do what you do. Amen. They may make mistaken comments about you're a religious zealot and you're a this and you're following AFTER THAT AND YOU'VE GOT this the THE GOSPEL ALL WRONG. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY SAY. I CAN'T PROVE anything to them. But the one who gave me the seal is the one who will identify that seal. &gt;&gt; And he gave it to me because I believed his word. &gt;&gt; He gave it to me because I've come into union with him. Amen. And he's given me that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Let's look at this seal for just a minute. In Romans 8:15, he says, "For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear." So that seal does not bring you into fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or into bondage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry, "Aba, Father." So this seal, amen, brings us uh it's the spirit of adoption which brings us into the understanding of the family that we belong to and who our father truly is. And listen, and the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. So what is this token doing inside of me? this token of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that God has given to me as a seal. That signate ring I got from from Christ. Amen. That seal that I've got, his spirit dwelling in me. Amen. That spirit beareth witness with my spirit &gt;&gt; that I am the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, it's not what somebody else told me or convinced me or keeps trying to convince me through preaching. Amen. It is something that the spirit that I've received, the token I've received is witnessing with the spirit that's in me and letting me know I am a child of God. &gt;&gt; It's a witness within me. Amen. That's witnessing with my desires, my faith, what I believe with. And the Holy Ghost is anointing that. Amen. And it's it's A RECOGNITION TOGETHER. I AM A son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And also in Romans 5 it says, "And hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us." So that seal given to me also is the love of God shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Ghost. It brings such a love, the love of God, the love of God for me and my love back to him. And so this seal that I've received, this token, this signate that I've got, amen, it is bearing witness within me that I'm the son of God and brings the very love of God shed abroad in my heart and brings me into a love relationship with God. Amen. Where nobody else understands. &gt;&gt; Nobody else knows the secret that's in my heart. That's right. &gt;&gt; Only him by the Holy Ghost. And that love was shed abroad by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So that brings me into an understanding of who I am and his love for me and my love for him. Man, I want to look now at the staff since I don't quite understand the cord other than something that binds the signate ring. It's a binding agent. But let's look at the staff now. Brother Von says some interesting things and why it had to be shepherds from December of 1964. He said, "What did he do by that shepherd staff?" Not a textbook, not a theologian's idea, but a shepherd staff. We're coming to it in a minute. A shepherd's staff. He did it. Not a denominational prayer book, but a shepherd's staff. shepherd's rod guiding his sheep, making the way clear as they went towards the promised word in the land. What a beautiful thing that it is today of the shepherd staff today, guiding his sheep to the promised land, bypassing all theology and everything else of this world and the things of the world and denominations and everything, opening up the way and proving his word to be the truth. The shepherd staff going ahead and notice the same shepherd staff that was guiding the sheep. Do you believe that he certainly did guide the sheep? He delivered them out of Egypt with that staff in his hand. We could say much more about it, but to hit the highlight, he guided the sheep and sent judgment upon the rejecting of him. The same staff that became a blessing to one became a curse to the others. The same waters of Noah's preaching that saved him condemned the world. The same staff that led Israel to the promised land condemned those who refused to follow the prophet shepherd. That's right. Become a stick of judgment. Further on in the same message he says also Israel's future offered and there where I I spoke of Israel now in the future there they were offered deliverance from bondage of death by a prophet shepherd they were brought out of bondage by a prophet shepherd with a staff see it was speaking of Israel's future delivered from death and held by a shepherd prophet that we speak of now all now to all all as as we know Israel did not receive the prophet shepherd 's word. All of Israel did not receive it. Now notice they was complaining, oh when we was performing the miracles, he was a great fellow. But when it come to his message, that was different. &gt;&gt; So the staff, amen, that Moses had, we know Moses had a regular staff, but brother Benham's taking it in type now. Amen. That the message brother that Moses brought, Amen. That message through a prophet messenger, a prophet shepherd was leading them back to the promised land, to the promised word. And when Jesus came, he was the prophet shepherd. Amen. Brother Bam said, "With a staff, &gt;&gt; but we didn't see a stick in his hand physically." Amen. But he had a STAFF AND THAT STAFF was the message he was preaching. They could accept the miracles, but they couldn't accept the message. And the message was leading them on. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God today has given us a staff to lead us. AMEN. THROUGH A PROPHET SHEPHERD IN THE END TIME, A SON of man revealing the son of man, the same shepherd that was rejected in Judea and in Samaria and in Jerusalem 2,000 years ago. The same one came, the great prophet shepherd through another prophet. Amen. And he was leading us by the message of the hour into the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what was he? HE WAS THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH. WHAT STAFF DOES HE HAVE? HE'S THE HEAD OF JUDAH. HE'S THE KING OF THE TRIBES. AMEN. HE'S THE king of Israel and the line lineage of Judah. SO WHAT IS THAT STAFF? AMEN. IT'S THE WORD THAT'S here to guide us AND LEAD US ALL THE way home, friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a signant ring &gt;&gt; and we have a staff. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you received the message? &gt;&gt; Have you received the staff of the shepherd prophet, the the the the message, the word that's leading us along? Have you received it? Is it inside of you? Have you taken into your inner chamber? Is it a secret that you're holding inside of you? Oh, then you have a signate ring and you have a staff. &gt;&gt; Oh, it doesn't matter what other people think about you. It doesn't matter what other people say about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your vindication are the tokens that you hold in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And where did you get them? Where did you get this message? Listen, we didn't get this message from William Brandham. We got this message from Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Where did you get your token? That token didn't come, Amen. just through from a preacher somewhere or a church. That token came from Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the one who has impregnated us. He's the one who's come in union with us. He's the one who's given us these tokens and we receive them from his hand. Why? Cuz we didn't want money. We're not a harlot. We didn't want a lustful nothing. What we wanted was redemption. the word, the truth, a restoration. The same thing Tamar was hungering for. She may not have understood the hunger. I believe there was a spiritual hunger driving her, but friends, there's a spiritual hunger driving us to this word and to this token. &gt;&gt; AND ANYTIME SOMEBODY BECOMES DRIVEN BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD, THEY BECOME AN ANOMALY. THEY BECOME AN OUTCAST. THEY BECOME SOMETHING STRANGE to the world. &gt;&gt; They're willing to do STRANGE THINGS. TAMAR WAS WILLING to do something very strange. Amen. IN ORDER TO BE PART OF THE REDEMPTION PLAN, to be part of the word coming forth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She was willing TO DO SOMETHING SO UNUSUAL. AMEN. BECAUSE SHE WAS DRIVEN BY A FORCE. SHE HAD TO PLAY THE PART. SHE HAD TO RECEIVE THE SEED. SHE HAD TO BRING FORTH AND AND PRESERVE the lineage of Judah. It was more than the THOUGHTS OF A WOMAN. AMEN. IT WAS THE VERY THOUGHTS OF GOD THAT WERE DRIVING HER. AND FRIENDS, YOU AND I ARE driven by more than just our own desires and our own thoughts. There's a SEED GENE OF GOD INSIDE OF YOU PROGRAMMED TO REACH OUT FOR THIS SIGNANT RING, TO REACH OUT FOR THIS LORD JESUS CHRIST AND SAY, "I'VE GOT TO HAVE THE SEED AND PLANTED IN ME. I'VE GOT TO COME INTO UNION WITH HIM. I'M HERE." AMEN. TO BRING FORTH THE PROMISED SON &gt;&gt; OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH. &gt;&gt; I'M ON THIS EARTH. AMEN. IT'S FOR ME TO DO. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; It's for ME TO BRING FORTH THE SON of man again. &gt;&gt; Amen. AND IN THE PROCESS, I don't want money. I don't want fame. I don't want prestige. I don't want I don't want nothing. &gt;&gt; All I want is to bring forth Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I came to Christ, he gave me a seal &gt;&gt; and he gave me a staff, the message of the hour. And I hold them as treasures in my heart. Are they a treasure to you? &gt;&gt; They're a treasure. And all of Tamar's trouble. No. It may have gotten difficult, friends. She may have heard a lot of things and she may have the accusations may have got pretty rough and her own family may have got pretty raw with her and but when she went back to her room at night and she pulled back the covers and she saw that staff there. &gt;&gt; She reached down and she held the signate ring she knew all is well. &gt;&gt; All is well. &gt;&gt; Man, life may not be easy. We may get all kinds of situations in life that are discouraging and disruptive and we may have people pass judgments upon us and misunderstand us and our actions and and our desires. But when you can go back to your prayer closet and you and you dig down deep and that love of God is still shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Ghost and this message still means more to you than anything and it's still the guiding thing that's guiding you to the promised land. Amen. You can recognize I have his staff and I have his ring and everything's all right with me. &gt;&gt; I know what's alive inside of me and it's alive by the one who gave me this Holy Ghost and who gave me this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. And look here at Ruth in Ruth chapter 3. We know the story of Ruth, the Moabitis woman who comes back with Naomi. Her husband is dead. Amen. There's no hope for her. Naomi even tells her, "There's no hope for you. You're not going to get another husband from me. There's going to be no redemption of your land, no redemption of you because the redemption rights would go to another son. And another son would come in unto her and raise up another seed to replace her dead husband. But Naomi says, "What are you going to do? Wait till I get married and bring forth another son and wait 20 years till you can listen. You're finished." And and Ruth said, "It doesn't matter to me. I just want to be where you're at." Amen. and your people will be my people and your God will be my God and where you go I'll go and where you die I'll die and she pledged her allegiance Naomi and went Amen went back into uh uh Bethlehem &gt;&gt; back into Israel and while she's there she's gleaning and she's trying to survive and she's barely scratching out a living just going around following after the gleaners picking up a little bit of barley a little bit of grain that she could go out and thresh back at home and have a little bit of bread TO EAT. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH to get through the winter. That's not enough to survive. That's just enough to make it from day to day. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Naomi said to her one time, she said, "Guess, you know, you know, Ruth, I want to do something for you. Here's what you got to do. You've got to go to the Lord of the harvest. You've got to go to the kinsman redeemer, and you've got to lay your life down at his feet. And if you give yourself to him, he'll take care of you." &gt;&gt; Amen. And so she SAYS, "ALL THAT YOU SAID, NAOMI, that I'll do." AND SHE PREPARED HERSELF. AND SHE GOT READY AND she went to the threshing floor according to what Naomi told her. And she goes down there at night. And after Boaz had drank, and after he had ate, and after his heart was Mary, he went and laid himself down. And she snuck in to the threshing floor where a woman wasn't supposed to be at a time she wasn't supposed to be there. And she slipped in under the cover of darkness. and she lay down at his feet. And that's where we pick it up in verse 14. And she lay at his feet until the morning. And she rose up before one could know another. And he said, "Let it not be known that a woman came in into the floor. Keep this a secret. &gt;&gt; Keep it a secret. This doesn't look good." Also, he said, "Bring the veil that thou hast upon thee and hold it." And when she held it, she measured, he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her. And she went into the city. And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, "Who art thou, my daughter?" And she told her all that the man had hath done to her. And she said, "These six measures of barley gave he me, for he said to me, go not empty unto thy mother-in-law." Then said she, "Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall. For the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day. &gt;&gt; He gave her a promise that he was going to go to the judgment seat, &gt;&gt; the gate of the city, the judgment seat. He said, "There's another kinsman near." Amen. If he'll do the ride of redemption, he can do it. If not, I'll redeem you. Amen. And brother Brandham said, "Amen. That next to kidman, that closer one, he said that was the devil." Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he begins to lay out, you know, the at THE JUDGMENT SEAT, HE'S ALREADY PROMISED HER, I'LL do my part. And he gave her a token. &gt;&gt; Six measures of barley. And he sent her with a token. And the token was evidence, amen, that he was the Lord of the harvest. He was the redeemer. He was going to feed her. He was going to care for her. But it was six. It's an incomplete number. seven because he himself is going to be the seventh portion. He's going to sew the seventh portion of seed and that seed is going to be a redeemer that's sewed into her womb. &gt;&gt; Not six SHE CAN CARRY LIKE THE SIX SEALS you can read. But the seventh seal, the mystery, amen, the ve the one that's veiled and hidden. He's going to become that seventh seal to her. And then the seventh seal, the seventh measure of seed is going to be swed into her and she's going to be carrying amen. redeemer, the Lord of the harvest within her. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Boaz sends her and when when when Naomi hears all that she says and Naomi sees the token and she says, "Listen, sit still. &gt;&gt; You've done all that you needed to do. NOW REST CUZ HE'LL NOT REST TILL HE FINISHES what he promised you." HE GOES BACK TO THE TO THE NEARER KINSMAN and the nearer kinsman is selfish and the nearer kinsman is greedy and THE NEAREST KENMAN'S NOT SACRIFICIAL AT ALL. AMEN. And he says, "Hey, listen. Naomi's back in town." Amen. AND AND AND ALL THAT WAS HER HUSBANDS and her sons and all that their inheritance is left uh open. Now, if you will redeem Naomi and all that she has, then you can have it all back. And the devil's like, I get it all &gt;&gt; because he's sitting like a squatter over it anyways. &gt;&gt; Even though it's not rightfully his, he sits as a squatter on this earth. &gt;&gt; He says, "But but if you take Naomi, you have to take back Ruth and raise up seed for the dead." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. If I raise up seed for the dead, he says, I mar my own inheritance. &gt;&gt; There's something about the right of redemption in that seed that would come forth that would cause him to lose maybe a portion of his own inheritance. &gt;&gt; And he sure ain't going to do right by that woman. And he's sure not going to bring up seed by her because he's not going to lose anything to a rightful heir. Oh, but Boaz is totally different. Boaz is going to give all of himself. Amen. And this child that comes up is not just going to redeem what Naomi lost, but is also going to become the Lord of the harvest and take Boaz's place and have more than they've ever had in the past. Because that's what God's giving to us. He's giving us everything. He's making us a joint heir OVER ALL CREATION. NOT JUST A PORTION. NOT JUST WE'RE NOT JUST GETTING BACK ETERNAL LIFE. WE'RE GETTING BACK ALL OF OUR PORTION. AND WE'RE GETTING ALL OF HIS PORTION, TOO. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT BOAZ GAVE. AMEN. TO THIS seed when when when he went into Ruth and she conceived and she BROUGHT FORTH A CHILD. THAT CHILD SHE BROUGHT FORTH BECAME OF HEIR OF ALL THAT NAOMI'S husband and sons had lost, BUT ALSO BECAME AN HEIR OF ALL THAT BOAZ HAD. And this was the heir of all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she's sitting there because she had a secret meeting that no one observed. &gt;&gt; And she received a promise to her that no one heard. That's right. &gt;&gt; AND SHE HER ONLY TOKEN evidence was six measures of barley &gt;&gt; and she could look at that barley and Naomi could look at that barley and they said, "Don't worry, he's not going to leave it unfinished. &gt;&gt; You can't stop at 6. You got to go to seven. Don't you worry. He signaled to you that he's going to come and finish it. Amen. There's a mysterious measure he hasn't given you yet, but he's not going to stop at six. He'll come to God's perfect number of completion. He'll come to seven. You rest because he's not going to rest until you get the seventh portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. But what did Ruth have to do? She had to do something that looked bad. She had to do something that was risky. &gt;&gt; She had to leave, Amen. the comforts of a good reputation. And she had to risk losing her reputation. Tamar had to list risk losing her reputation. And friends, I gladly lose my reputation. Amen. to do whatever looks WRONG, WHATEVER LOOKS LIKE MIGHT be misjudged by other people's actions, think you went after a cult, you follow after a man, you got deceived by this, and you've gone too far. You're extremism, you're a legalist, you're whatever. I don't care WHAT THEY SAY. I'VE GOT A TOKEN IN MY POCKET. I GOT A LOVE OF GOD SHED ABROAD IN MY HEART. I GOT A WITNESS INSIDE OF me that WITNESS THAT I AM, AMEN, THE SON OF GOD. I AM A CHILD OF GOD. AND I'VE GOT THIS STAFF, THIS MEASURE, THE THIS STAFF THAT THE message of the hour THAT'S LEADING ME ALL THE WAY BACK HOME. AMEN. IF SOMEBODY HURTS MY FEELINGS, ACCUSES ME. THAT'S FINE. IT CAN HURT. IT CAN STING. BUT WHEN I GO BACK TO MY PRAYER CLOSET AND I TOUCH THAT STAFF AGAIN, I KNOW THAT THIS STAFF IS FROM JUDAH. IS FROM THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH. AND THIS IS HIS SIGNATE RING. AND I'VE GOT GUARANTEE THAT I'M GOING TO MAKE IT. HE'S NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE WORK UNDONE. AND NO MATTER WHAT EVERYBODY ACCUSES ME OF, HE'S DECLARED ME RIGHTEOUS. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. Amen. It matters. I don't say IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT MATTERS. We're human beings. We can't stop things from offending. We can't stop things from hurting. AMEN. BUT WE GOT TO GO BACK, AMEN, TO THE TOKENS THAT HE'S GIVEN US and realize, Amen. Nobody else was there. Nobody else knows. NOBODY LIVES IN MY HEART. BUT I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED IN. I KNOW WHO I MET. I KNOW WHO I'M UNIFIED WITH. &gt;&gt; And I MAY NOT GET ONE PERSON ON THIS PLANET TO BELIEVE IT, BUT IN THAT DAY, HE'LL RECOGNIZE THE TOKEN he gave me. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAY, "THAT'S MY LIFE. THAT'S MY TOKEN. THAT'S MY SPIRIT in you." &gt;&gt; IT'S MY STAFF YOU'RE FOLLOWING. That's my word that you love. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Listen, I didn't give myself this message. He gave it to me. &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T MAKE IT UP. I DIDN'T MANIPULATE. I DIDN'T FIGURE IT OUT. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. IT WAS GOD WHO SENT THE MESSAGE OUR WAY. IT WAS GOD WHO VINDICATED. GOD WHO SENT THE PROPHET. WE DIDN'T MAKE IT UP, FRIENDS. IT'S HIS ROD. AMEN. He just gave it to us. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. And now, no matter what anybody says, if there's ever a question, I can say whoever this staff belongs to, who whoever this message belongs to, &gt;&gt; is who I'm pregnant by. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's the seed I've received from the man who sent this message. &gt;&gt; From the one who gave me this signate ring, this Holy Ghost. That's the one. That's the life that's inside of me. The life that came from him. Brother Brandham said spoken where's the original seed? He said that's where we found when Adam came to his wife. She was pregnantated with the wrong seed. That seed died. Joseph came to his she was pregnantated. Now what caused a different pregnantation? Because that Adam's wife doubted the word. That's right. Joseph's bride believed the word. The difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he's talking about Mary. &gt;&gt; Mary fetching water as a young girl, espouseed to a man to be married. She has a secret meeting with an angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see a theme in the Bible? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; These things are done in secret, friends. &gt;&gt; Secretly. You know, when brother Andreas was preaching and he got to marry, it just blessed my heart. He said, he said, "Forgive me for saying that, but God could have done it a better way." Like, if you would have done it before that she was engaged, it would have saved her some trouble, Joseph some trouble, a lot of people a lot of trouble. But God wasn't interested in saving people trouble. He was interested in bringing about his plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. But listen, if he would have done, if the angel would have showed up in the synagogue in front of the priest and pointed Mary out, &gt;&gt; he'd have saved her a lot of trouble. &gt;&gt; Why do it in secret? She's the only one who heard what he said. &gt;&gt; She's the only one who got the message. She's the only one now in the whole world that knew what the fulfillment of Isaiah 14 was. Isaiah 7:14, a virgin shall conceive. She now knew and she knew who the virgin was. She knew when that scripture is going to come to place. And she now had the full revelation of that scripture. And she's the only one, not a priest, not a high priest, not a scholar, nobody else. And he told it to a little virgin girl who is 14, 15, 16 years old about to be married. And he comes to her and he calls her highly favored and he tells her she's the chosen one and she's going to bring forth a child. And nobody's there to witness it. And he doesn't give her a sign. He doesn't GIVE HER A DOCUMENT. He doesn't give her an evidence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I love it. Why in the world are we worried about trying to prove our sunship to anybody? Why are we trying to prove our relationship to Christ to anybody? There's nothing we'll ever do to prove it. God gave it to you in secret and he intends you to believe what took place in secret and stand by it. &gt;&gt; Amen. God I mean we would what God if you'll just give me a sign do a miracle through me everybody will believe I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; No they won't. &gt;&gt; But God doesn't do it that way. &gt;&gt; Now he comes to Mary and he gives her the word. Just the word. No token. No physical evidence. nothing that she could put HER FINGERS ON. ALL he gives her is the promised word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And guess what? She receives it. &gt;&gt; Not a physical evidence like Tamar HAD. NOT A TOKEN uh like Ruth had. She has absolutely nothing to show anybody else. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; ALL SHE HAS IS HER TESTIMONY. And that testimony probably is not widely believed. &gt;&gt; Can we just take a shot in the dark? Maybe. I mean, I doubt she was believed. &gt;&gt; And then, you know, the only thing she has is the experience she had in private with the angel of the Lord and the message that was given to her and her heart's desire, the connection she had in her soul to believe that message. And when she ASKED THE QUESTION, HOW WILL THIS BE? SHE'S thinking physical again. How physically how I don't know a man. How will I get seed? I'm a virgin. and and all of these things. He said, "The Holy Ghost shall ever sh over overshadow thee, and the thing formed in you shall be of the most high." &gt;&gt; Listen, that is not an explanation of how it's going to work. &gt;&gt; But there's something more moving her than just intellect, just reasoning, JUST SCIENCE. THERE'S GOT TO BE THERE'S SOMETHING MORE GOING ON INSIDE OF HER than just the NATURAL WORLD. THERE WAS SOMETHING PUSHING TAMAR, SOMETHING PUSHING RUTH. And there was something behind MARY PUSHING HER TO SAY, "BE it unto me according TO YOUR WORD. I'LL ACCEPT THAT." AND LISTEN, HER DECISION WAS RISKY. IT LOOKED BAD. &gt;&gt; IT AFFECTED HER REPUTATION. IT PUT HER IN IN THE EYES OF MANY PEOPLE. IT PUT HER IN A DIFFERENT CLASS OF PERSON. SHE WAS SUBJECT TO SCORN. SHE WAS SUBJECT to ridicule. SHE MAY HAVE BEEN MOCKED BY PEOPLE. AMEN. BECAUSE SHE COMES OUT WITH A TESTIMONY. I TALKED TO AN ANGEL AND GUESS WHAT? I'M THE FULFILLMENT OF ISAIAH 7:14. And everybody looked at her and said, "You poor kid. What is wrong with you? Did you sleep last night? Have you been up, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Are you having another manic episode? THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT. FRIENDS, WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT? SOMEBODY come running up to you AND SAID, "GUESS WHAT? I MET AN angel and this, this, and this." LISTEN, THERE WAS SOMETHING moving her. SHE WOULD TAKE A STEP. AMEN. AND NOBODY BELIEVED IT, BUT she believed it cuz she was there. &gt;&gt; She heard it. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham said SHE WENT TESTIFYING BEFORE SHE FELT ONE THING INSIDE of her chain. SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR SIGNS. SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR TOKEN EVIDENCE. SHE JUST WENT with the word and believed the word. MARY IS OUR TYPE, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T PROTECT HER REPUTATION, GUARD HERSELF, GUARD HER REPUTATION. She just went. She just received the word and went declaring the word &gt;&gt; and then her problems got worse &gt;&gt; because when it started to show that something in her life changed &gt;&gt; when her walk changed when her taste changed when her desires changed when everything about her be to change then pretty soon everybody realized there's something different about you and her pregnantation begin to show &gt;&gt; and it would begin to show. They switched from thinking this poor child is just deceived, seeing visions, having dreams, having a nightmare till she's a harlot &gt;&gt; and she's been in whoredoms. &gt;&gt; She's been getting tangled up with wrong kind of men, possibly a soldier or something. And &gt;&gt; you know what? Those things may have hurt Mary's feelings. &gt;&gt; They may have been hard to hear. And when she would walk through the market, everybody's whisper stop when she walks past. That might have stung. That might have hurt. But there's no way in the world she could give up what she believed. There's no way she could go back on what she declared because she knew this life inside of me, this thing that now is growing, this thing that now is moving, this thing that's changing my whole life, this didn't come from no man. This came from God Almighty. Amen. I had nothing to do with it. This is beyond me. AMEN. AND HER EVIDENCE WAS NOT THE EVIDENCE ANYBODY else had or everybody ELSE SAW. HER EVIDENCE was the life that was living in her. AND SHE KNEW THAT'S NOT MY LIFE. THAT'S ANOTHER life inside of me. AND IT'S NOT A LIFE I PUT THERE. AND IT'S NOT A LIFE NO DENOMINATIONAL man put there. BUT THIS LIFE WAS FROM HIM. THIS COME FROM GOD HIMSELF. IT'S HIS OWN LIFE GROWING in me. &gt;&gt; AND LISTEN FRIENDS, WHEN OUR LIFE CHANGES and our tastes change and and we can't associate where we used to associate and we can't do the things we used to do and it begins to show that we're pregnant. &gt;&gt; Listen, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PEOPLE SAY, WHAT THEY THINK, THE accusations they throw. It doesn't MATTER BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS LIFE IN ME IS NOT MY LIFE. IT'S HIS LIFE. I KNOW WHAT I WAS BEFORE AND I KNOW THE WAY I LIVED AND I KNOW THE things I couldn't overcome and I know the trappings and vices THAT I KEPT FALLING INTO. I KNOW WHAT MY LIFE WAS. This that's LIVING INSIDE OF ME IS SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S NOT JUST ME. IT'S HIM IN ME. IT'S THE SEED THAT I'VE RECEIVED IN A PRIVATE VISITATION. NOBODY WAS AROUND. NOBODY HEARD IT. BUT I HEARD IT AND I BASED ON THE WORD I RECEIVED IT. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN I RECEIVED IT, I BELIEVED THAT I GOT IT. AND WHEN I GOT IT, IT BEGAN TO GROW INSIDE OF ME. AND IT BEGAN TO WORK INSIDE OF ME. AND IT'S CHANGED EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE MAY ACCUSE ME OF A FANATIC. THEY MAY ACCUSE me of a religious zealot. THEY MAY ACCUSE ME OF FOLLOWING WHATEVER WRONG DOCTRINES. I CAN'T HELP IT. I KNOW THIS LIFE INSIDE OF ME is not me. It's more THAN ME. IT'S ANOTHER LIFE GROWING in me. &gt;&gt; AND I CAN'T BACK UP ON IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW CAN I BACK UP AND SAY, "NO, THAT WASN'T GOD. THAT WAS JUST ME." MY GOODNESS, I WAS THERE. I KNOW WHAT I WAS. I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. MARY KNEW BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, NO MAN planted this seed inside of me. &gt;&gt; She knew it, friends. &gt;&gt; AND I CAN TELL YOU BEYOND ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT. IT WAS NO DENOMINATION THAT GAVE ME THIS LIFE. AMEN. THERE WAS NO TEACHINGS OF A MAN THAT gave me this life. IT WAS THE ONE WHO GAVE ME HIS STAFF AND IT WAS THE ONE WHO GAVE ME HIS RING. IT'S HIS LIFE THAT'S INSIDE of me. &gt;&gt; And you CAN JUDGE ME ANY WAY YOU WANT. AND PEOPLE CAN JUDGE ONE ANOTHER. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT JUDGMENTS ARE PASSED ABOUT YOU, MY FRIEND. If you hold the signate ring and you hold the rod and you feel within you the life of the one you met in private growing inside of you, you can rest. &gt;&gt; Rest. &gt;&gt; All is well. If you have his ring and you have his staff and inside you received his seed and now his life is growing in you, you're as righteous as he is righteous &gt;&gt; because he never sws his seed in unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; He will only come to a virgin womb. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Listen, life isn't easy. Brother said it wasn't meant to be easy. We never come through life unscathed. We never come through life without trials, without difficulties, without accusations. And many of the things that we've done as believers of this message, most of the world doesn't understand. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sometimes other Christian, many other Christians don't understand. Sometimes other people who claim to believe the message don't understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it's not my job to make anybody else understand. I can't make anybody else understand. I was the one who was in the private meeting. &gt;&gt; I heard. I was there. And these tokens that I'm carrying, listen, it may not mean anything to you, but it sure means something to me. This message that I did not give myself but that I received. This word that's leading me home. It may not mean a lot to you but it means a lot to me &gt;&gt; because it was given by the one who's leading me home. &gt;&gt; Listen, you may doubt whether I've got the Holy Ghost or not, and I can't convince you otherwise. &gt;&gt; You may think that my signate ring is a trinket from the dollar store. a cheap knockoff. &gt;&gt; A cheap version of the real. What am I going to do to convince you it's different? &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; But I tell you one thing. Amen. This ring that I've got and this staff that I've got will cause me to bypass judgment. &gt;&gt; There's one who knows where it's real or not. Yes, &gt;&gt; there's for sure one who knows whether this signate is a knockoff trinket from the dollar store or an original item. There is one who knows if this staff that I believe this message that I hold to whether it's genuine that I hold to the genuine message of God or not. There's one who knows and it's the one who gave it and I'm trusting the one who gave it. He's the one who has to identify it. He's the one who HAS TO DISCERN WHOSE ITEMS THESE ARE. OH GOD, DISCERN IN US WHOSE SPIRIT THIS IS, WHOSE WORD THIS IS THAT WE'RE HOLDING ON TO. I'M HOLDING ON TO A STAFF, THE SHEPHERD STAFF THAT'S GUIDING ME THROUGH. WHOSE STAFF IS THIS? IT'S GOD'S STAFF. IT'S HIS WORD. IT'S JESUS CHRIST, THE WORD OF GOD THAT I'M HOLDING TO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And the one who gave it is the one who can identify it. And there's not a thing I can do to prove its authenticity to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, &gt;&gt; but there's only one who needs to vindicate its authenticity, &gt;&gt; and that's the one who gave it. &gt;&gt; Jesus says in Luke 8, "For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest." &gt;&gt; Neither anything hid that shall not be known and come abroad. Your meeting with Christ may have been private. Your baptism of the Holy Ghost may just be private to you. The token that you hold that vindicates that you've been you unified with Christ. Nobody else may be able to understand it. But Jesus said there's nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest. &gt;&gt; One day, friends, it's going to be made manifest whose ring this is. &gt;&gt; Whose signate this is and whose staff this is. Amen. It's going to be made manifest. Amen. We hold it in secret now, but God's going to declare it openly someday. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say hold to it. &gt;&gt; Hold to it. Love it. Enjoy it. Amen. Gain confidence from what God has given to you and I. &gt;&gt; Will people accuse? Yes. Will the devil, the accuser, the brother, whisper in your ear that it's not you and you're not the one and it's not real and you were just mistaken? Absolutely. He'll use other voices. He'll use your voice. He'll use people all around. He'll use circumstances and failures in your own life to try to give you an identity. But forget all of that. &gt;&gt; Can you realize like Mary, listen, nobody believes me. Nobody understands &gt;&gt; and it looks bad. &gt;&gt; Here a virgin girl, not yet married, walking around pregnant. It looks bad. But when she feels that life inside of her stir and kick, she knows how it got there. &gt;&gt; When you hear the preaching of the word, listen, co-workers and friends and relatives, they may think you're off your rocker and gone too far, but under the preaching of the word, when that life inside begins to kick and jump, you know that life came from somewhere else. Amen. That's from AMEN. THAT'S FROM GOD ALMIGHTY. THAT'S FROM my husband. That's from Jesus Christ. And that's his impregnation in me. his life inside of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ben says, "The other is pregnantated by the word of God and will bring forth the body, the finished body of Jesus Christ, which is the bride." What's the finished body of Jesus Christ? The bride. What are you bringing forth? The bride. WHERE ARE YOU BRINGING FORTH THE BRIDE? IN YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT LIFE IS MANIFESTING in you. IN BRIDE FORM. AND THAT LIFE IN YOU IS BRINGING FORTH ITS OWN LIFE IN BRIDE FORM. And you're becoming the manifestation of your pregnantation. &gt;&gt; Amen. The body of Christ isn't finished yet. How many knows that a man and woman is one and Christ is one body? The word. The bride will have to be the rest of that body. And the two together makes one body again. &gt;&gt; So what are you bringing forth? His life where in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The man makes this statement. I want to just read through a couple more uh uh slides as we finish. And Christianity is misrepresented to people. Christianity has been represented to people as a declaration of creed. Christianity is a living being, Jesus Christ, the resurrected God that's alive among us now. Christianity is a person, not a creed. To know him is life. Not even to know his word, that isn't life. Know him and he is the word. Oh, I love this. Can I can I underline this? &gt;&gt; Not even to know his word, but to know him and he is the word. &gt;&gt; So, do I need to know the word or not? Absolutely. But he's telling you, you must have the person of the word. You can't take uh you can't just take the words that are in here without the life of the word. You can't just take sterile like churches take, like denominations take, just say, you know, John 3:16 says THIS AND NO, I WANT THE LIFE OF JOHN 3:16. I want the one who spoke the word, the one who wrote the word. I WANT THAT WORD IN ME AND I WILL BELIEVE ALL OF HIS WORD BECAUSE HE is the word. &gt;&gt; BUT I DON'T WANT WORDS WITHOUT THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I want the word to reveal all the words. &gt;&gt; A fellow said to me not long ago, I was just discussing about the what what we thought about a certain scripture in the Bible. This fellow was quite a scholar. Said, well, you just don't know your Bible. I said I know the author real well. So that's the main thing. If I know him, he will take care of the rest of it. To know him is life. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "So therefore there is no school, no theologians, no teachings of the Bible among any school that knows anything about it. They cannot know anything about it. It's impossible for them to know anything about it. God has hid the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers and everything else. It's a personal individual affair with with the person that Christ is revealed to them. &gt;&gt; That's why you can't prove it to nobody else. God doesn't want you to be able to prove it to anybody else. &gt;&gt; Listen, we've lived this life long enough and been in the message long enough to see people who were gifted, people who who who could do nice works and nice things and do good deeds who would leave the word. We've been long enough to see people who, you know, don't always get it right. A little rough around the edges, but they keep coming back to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; They stay put regardless because they don't know where else to go. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be. The one who doesn't know where else to go. Let's turn to 2 Corinthians together. 2 Corinthians 4. Second Corinthians chapter 4 and we'll start at verse 6. For God who commanded the light to shine out darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. For God who commanded the light to shine out of the darkness, that's revelation has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. That's Christ, the mystery of God revealed. That we can see the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. He is the revelation of God. Then verse seven, but we have this treasure in earthn vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. &gt;&gt; Where is this great treasure of the revelation of God of the glory of God? Where is it? It's in earthn vessels, &gt;&gt; stuck down in a clay pot &gt;&gt; made out of dirt. &gt;&gt; And we have a treasure in earthn vessels. When you look at me, you see a clay pot, but in me is a treasure. &gt;&gt; When I look at you, I may see a clay pot, but I'm trusting inside of you is a treasure, too. &gt;&gt; And the question is, is it a treasure to us? Do we have this revelation of who God is? Is this treasure &gt;&gt; in our hearts? &gt;&gt; If it is, Amen. then to us, it's a treasure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in the clay pot and it to me it's sealed in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can write on the outside of the pot treasure. That doesn't mean there's any treasure in there. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You can write anything on you want on the outside. Amen. But the reality there's either a treasure in there or not. Amen. And the clay pot should know if it's holding a treasure or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. that that I may just be a vessel like every other vessel that's on the planet. I may be human like everybody else is human. There's nothing special about me that makes me different than another human being. Amen. But there's something special inside of me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's him. &gt;&gt; And we have this treasure, this revelation, this word, this person is in us. Now, now that we have this treasure in earth and vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. Let's read what it says next. We are troubled on every side yet not distressed. Why are we not distressed? Because I have a treasure in my earthn vessel. &gt;&gt; That is the revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Okay. We are troubled on every side, not distressed. We are perplexed but not in despair. persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed, always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. &gt;&gt; We have a treasure in earth and vessels. And because we have a treasure in earth and vessels, we are perplexed. We are distressed. We are in the midst of troubles. Why? Because we He wants to display the treasure that's inside and let it start leaking to the outside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know what the treasure is. Others may not know. But God uses all of these circumstances. And in the circumstances, we may be distressed, but we're not perplexed. Listen, we're not It's not that we're not perplexed because we're super bright. &gt;&gt; We're not perplexed because we know the tokens that we hold. &gt;&gt; We know the treasure that's inside. We know who we are. And things go wrong, but it can't change what I'm holding in my hand. &gt;&gt; Life can go backwards, upside down, and sideways, but it can't change the life that's inside of me is him. I may disappoint myself. Others may disappoint me. But nothing's going to change. I may get perplexed. I may get perplexed but not be in despair. &gt;&gt; I may uh I may be troubled on every side but not in distress. Why? The same reason that Mary wasn't. The same reason that Ruth wasn't. the same reason that Tamar wasn't &gt;&gt; under the press. Do you think Tamar was pressed? Yes. You think Mary was pressed? Yes. I think they were pressed and under pressure. &gt;&gt; But yet they had token evidences that God had done something for them. And what he started, he was going to finish. &gt;&gt; And I believe with all my heart that what God has started in you and I, he himself, his life in us is going to finish. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's okay to be troubled on every side, but don't be distressed. &gt;&gt; It's okay. It's okay to have troubles. It's okay to have distresses. It's okay to get confused. Sometimes we just need to go back into our prayer closet and remember whose life this is inside of us. Who shed this love of God abroad in my heart? Who did that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Who gave me the faith to believe that I was a son of God? Who gave me this message? &gt;&gt; Where did this precious word come from? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It came from him. And these are my tokens. These are my evidences. And I'm not here to show them to the world. I'm only here because he knows he gave them to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is my consolation that he's my husband, that I belong to him and he belongs to me. And this life inside of me is his life, &gt;&gt; not mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful life to live, friends. &gt;&gt; I want to skip ahead to one other scripture as we close. Skipping, skipping, skipping. Let's go to Psalms 27. Brother Random comes to this in the rapture message. When brother Andreas was preaching on stuff all around Enoch was stuff, stuff was going on. Hey, listen. There's always stuff. &gt;&gt; Life has a lot of stuff all around us. Brother Brennan, when he comes to the rapture message, he opens with this scripture reading in Psalms 27. He said, "The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear?" &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In his pavilion, in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock. And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me. Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing. Yay, I will sing praises unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; When is he singing praises unto the Lord? When war should gather against him. When a host should encamp around him. When all those around him should desire to eat up his flesh. That's when God is going to hide him in the secret of his pavilion. In his pavilion, in the secret of his tabernacle, God is going to bring him back into a private communion in secret. And the secret communion in the hidden tabernacle of the Lord is going to give him the ability to sing in the midst of trouble. In the time of trouble, we can still sing because all is well. If God could just bring us back into the secret, amen, where he gave us his gifts, where he told us who we are, where he revealed these things to us, if he could just bring us back into the secret of his tabernacle. Amen. Then there though a host gathered about, though the enemies want to eat us up, no matter what's going on, ALTHOUGH TROUBLE BE ALL AROUND, I CAN SING. YAY, I can rejoice. I can sing praises to the Lord BECAUSE ALL IS WELL. ALL WILL END WELL. I'VE GOT THE TOKENS of I got the tokens OF MY DELIVERANCE. I GOT THE TOKENS OF MY RIGHTEOUSNESS. I'VE GOT WHAT HE'S gave me. And this life and the secret OF MY TABERNACLE IS NOT just me. It's him and me dwelling together. &gt;&gt; David said he'll bring me into the secret to the HOLY OF HOLIES. NOT just his pavilion, but the tabernacle. This is the third realm. This is the inner veil. This is the Holy of Holies. This is DOWN INSIDE YOUR SOUL. GOD WILL BRING HIM DOWN INTO THE INNER CHAMBER. AND GOD will begin to commune with David again and reveal, "I'm yours. You're mine. We're in this together. I've given you the tokens OF MY LOVE. I'VE GIVEN YOU MY STAFF. I'VE GIVEN YOU A MY SIGNATE RING. I'VE SHED MY LOVE ABROAD IN YOUR HEART. I'VE GIVEN YOU A REVELATION of your sunship AND BRING US BACK INTO THAT PLACE WHERE IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE, I CAN SING PRAISES TO THE LORD AND SAY, "LORD, YOU ARE WONDERFUL. YOU ARE GREAT. YOU ARE HIGH AND ABOVE ALL AND ALL IS WELL. &gt;&gt; All is well." &gt;&gt; Where is our overcoming power? In the secret. &gt;&gt; WHAT GIVES US STRENGTH TO FACE EVERY DAY? It's the secret that we're holding on to. Amen. That nobody knows but we ourselves. &gt;&gt; I don't know your secret. I only know my secret. &gt;&gt; Listen, none of us none of us can prove anything by anybody else or by anything. &gt;&gt; So don't prove. &gt;&gt; Just settle down to what he gave you. And let the tokens from your lover, let the tokens from your husband be enough. &gt;&gt; And slip back into the inner chamber once in a while for some private time with him. Stick your hand back in your pocket and feel the ring and say, "Yep, &gt;&gt; I do still love him. Yeah, I do. For whatever reason, I failed yesterday. I made a blunder today. But but the spirit is still witnessing with my spirit that I am a child of God." Amen. &gt;&gt; I This is his signate. This is his ring. And no matter what anybody said and how rough my day has been, this word is still his word and this is his message and this is his staff and it is still leading me home and I'm going to follow this staff all the way. &gt;&gt; And in the secret of the pavilion, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock. That's the rock of revelation &gt;&gt; of who Christ is. &gt;&gt; And he'll lift my head above my enemies. What's what happens when your head gets lifted above your enemies? It means your revelation goes higher to where you understand what's going on. Your head's been lifted up above your enemy. That's not just being picked up and put on a pole, but your revelation and understanding is coming to a place where you realize it's okay. These things have to be this way, but nothing's changed with me in Christ. &gt;&gt; And I hold the tokens of my justification. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he gave them to me. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I am so thankful to be holding this secret. &gt;&gt; There's been many times, friends, I've had to go back, like Tamar must have had to do. I've had to go back and remember. That's right. &gt;&gt; I've had to go back and just touch that ring again. Go back and to the message and say, "I love this message with all of my heart." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go back and REFLECT ON WHAT MARY heard from the angel messenger that came to her and told her who she was and what what she was on earth to do and what her purpose was. And that something inside of her just said, "Amen." How many times she reflected back on that, how many hurtful things she heard and how many times she went back to that point. &gt;&gt; Oh God, let me be like Mary. Let me stand fast with what you told me. &gt;&gt; Let me hold on to it. Let me recognize that this isn't just me anymore. Mary said yes. But then she became pregnant. &gt;&gt; Yes. And now Mary's walk isn't just Mary anymore. There's another life inside of Mary. And this isn't just you and I anymore. We hold a secret inside. And that secret is growing &gt;&gt; and taking over. And it's a life moving within us. &gt;&gt; And praise God. When it stirs, praise God. &gt;&gt; That's him in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together. God bless you. musicians if you'll come and brother John if you'll please come and say friends we we have troubles I have troubles you have troubles I think we can expect tomorrow to have troubles &gt;&gt; next week troubles but in the time of trouble &gt;&gt; he shall hide me in his pavilion he's given me the secret Mary had Tamar had Ruth had now I'm holding holding a secret. &gt;&gt; This is what I have confidence in is the secret that I'm holding. I pray that you're holding a secret, too. &gt;&gt; And if not, I pray that you go to him and you do the risky thing. It was risky for Tamar. It was risky for Ruth. It was risky for Mary. I encourage you to go do the risky thing. Forget your reputation. Give up your own life and your own re your own ambitions and your own ideas and just go lay your life down at his feet like Ruth did at the threshing floor. &gt;&gt; Give up everything. Give him your life. And it doesn't matter what your reputation is or what you ideas you had for the future. Just give away your life and DO LIKE TAMAR. RISK IT ALL TO HAVE WHAT'S YOURS. &gt;&gt; And when you do, just let him Amen. give you the token of the Holy Ghost. Let let him bring you to have confidence in that staff. Let that reality come into your life. And let his life begin to grow inside of you. And that you now you're carrying the secret. &gt;&gt; And your confidence is in the secret, not the public. That your confidence is in the secret. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you holding a secret today? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's the greatest thing you can have a hold of is that secret. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray together. Lord Jesus, I thank you so much, Lord, for your word is so good. And God, you've given us such consolation, Lord, that we do have a treasure and earthn vessels that the excellency might be of you and not of us. For it's your power, your revelation, your life living in us. But God, many times we find ourselves in trouble, distressed, perplexed. But God, there's a peace that's on the inside. There's a relationship with you. There's a hidden place that you've brought us into. You've spoken to us through an angel. You've given to us your own life. You've planted your seed within. God, may that secret be the consolation we need to keep moving forward in life. God, I pray that you would, God, help us to overcome every obstacle and every trial with joy in our hearts, with a rejoicing on our lips. Because although there's enemies about, and although the devil is trying in every way to derail us, you have brought us into the secret of your tabernacle, Lord. And now I will sing praises to your name. I will rejoice for in my soul all is well. Oh, we love you. We thank you for this. I pray God if there's any that's not holding this secret, I pray they would come to you now that they would surrender all. That they would lay it all away and they would reach out and grab a hold of you, Lord. That they would surrender their life and lay down, Lord, at your feet and ask you, Lord, to be their redeemer. To ask you, Lord, to fulfill your promise that you would, Lord, plant your seed within. We love you, Father. as we part tonight and go our ways, I pray you'd strengthen us. I thank you, Lord Jesus, for the strength to preach this message, Lord. And God, I pray, Lord, for healing for myself, for all those who are here, weary in body and with a need. I pray you'd reach out and touch them, Lord, that you'd heal their bodies as well. We give you all the glory and thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Remember the joy and know that I'm the bride that you're returning for. Dressed in garments white and wrinklefree. I have no earthly love that I'm holding to. You're the one who means everything to me. And I will sing. I will worship you. I will bow myself down humbly at your throne. I will give anything. I will give everything to you alone. And you are the faithful God who keeps your covenant. And there's not one thing you said you haven't done. And someday when I see you standing face to face, my praise for you will only have begun. And I will sing and I will worship you. I will bow myself down homie at your throne and I will give anything. I will give everything to you alone. And you are the faithful God. keep your covenant. And there's not one thing you said you haven't done. Oh, and someday when I see you standing face to face, my praise for you will only have begun. And I will sing. And I will worship you. And I will bow myself down humbly at your throne. And I will give I will give everything to the Lord. Oh, I will sing and I will worship you and I will bow myself down humbly at your throne. I will give anything. I will give everything to you alone.
