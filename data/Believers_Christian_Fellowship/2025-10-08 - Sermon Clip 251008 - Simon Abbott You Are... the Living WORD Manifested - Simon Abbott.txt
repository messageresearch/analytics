TRANSCRIPT
========================================
We stand reflecting him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We are standing now. We've been given the clothes. We're wearing those clothes. We can say truly we're only standing there when he does it. Sometimes, you know, you know, when when you go to a brother or a sister and they're in need, you don't even know it. So, you go to visit somebody, you just feel in your heart, I'm going to go and visit that bro. I'm going to visit that sis. It's like you go there, you talk to them, and afterwards they're like, you know, you wouldn't believe that really touched my heart. That's exactly what I need. And you're like, well, did you know what you were doing? No. So, no. And it's happened to each one of us. True. True. Happened to everyone, right? Okay. So, can you take credit for that? &gt;&gt; No. No. And how listen, how many people I Well, you see, I I dreamed a dream like &gt;&gt; No. No. Truly. So, if you go somewhere, you talk to them &gt;&gt; and how many times does it happen? Oh, do you know that really that's exactly what I needed? How did you know? Oh, brother Chad's preaching. It's like, mate, that's exactly what I'm going through. That's answered my questions. Can he take any credit for that? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. No. What is it? It's the the Lord manifesting himself through your room is standing there. You see, this is the thing now. What we need to realize, guys. You know, it's not hard for us to believe that brother the prophet, he's part of the bride. He's the, you know, that's that's not hard for us to believe. What's hard for us to believe is that we're part of that same category, &gt;&gt; right? He was only standing there when the Lord worked through him. And it might be a little bit lesser in our eyes. It might be a little bit more simple &gt;&gt; in our eyes because we don't have all the gifts. And but when the Lord uses you, it's the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's him working through you. Listen, be encouraged. Be encouraged because I know each and every one of you it's happened. You've gone to see somebody. You've spoken to somebody. You maybe sent a text. You sent some you some way of reaching out to somebody and they've written about that's just what I needed. You were only sending there when you flicked the text. &gt;&gt; When he did it, &gt;&gt; you were only standing there. He was working through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the Lord gets full preeminence in his bride, it will be literally, listen carefully, when the Lord gets full preeminence in his bride, it will be the same as when the Lord stood there and said, &gt;&gt; "Speak the word. You see me, you see the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus stood there and said, "You see me, you see the father." What's he saying? You see, you see the same thing. So now, actually, when the bride has full preeminence and you are the written epistle, then basically when people see me, they see this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you see me, you see the word. When you see me, you see the father. It's the same thing. I at that day, I in you, you in me. And it's the word. It's exactly right, brother. It's the word speaking through you. You can't help it. It just comes out. Amen. You see me. You see Listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you see me, you see the word that was preached in the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; You see the word that the prophet preached. When you see me,
