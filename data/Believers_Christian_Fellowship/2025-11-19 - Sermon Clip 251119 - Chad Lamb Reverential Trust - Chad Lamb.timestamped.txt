[0:00] when Tamar, amen, put on the the veil
[0:04] and the and the clothes of harlotry and
[0:06] she went to DO WHAT SHE FELT LIKE SHE
[0:08] NEEDED to do for redemption for the seed
[0:10] line. Amen. She went to play the harlot
[0:13] with Judah. You realize she come to a
[0:16] point of no turning back.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; SHE COME TO A PLACE WHEN SHE MADE UP HER
[0:21] MIND AND MADE HER DECISION. THAT WAS NOT
[0:23] A HALFHEARTED DECISION. THERE'S NO WAY
[0:25] TO DO THAT HALF-HEARTEDLY.
[0:28] YOU CAN'T DO THAT HALFWAY. THAT WAS A
[0:30] FULLON 100% COMMITMENT. I'M GOING ALL
[0:34] the way. This is the only hope for me.
[0:36] THIS IS THE ONLY CHANCE THAT I'VE GOT.
[0:37] IF IT'S NOT THIS, THEN I'LL BE LEFT
[0:39] DESTITUTE AND I'VE got a right.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; To that seed line,
[0:46] &gt;&gt; she went. Amen. She did what she had TO
[0:48] DO. SHE ASKED for the TOKENS THAT SHE
[0:50] ASKED FOR. AMEN. But when it came time
[0:52] for JUDGMENT TO BE PASSED THREE MONTHS
[0:54] LATER, word had come, SHE'S A HARLOT.
[0:56] SHE'S GOING TO BE STONED. Judah
[0:58] pronounces judgment. Bring her here and
[1:00] burn her.
[1:02] I
[1:03] &gt;&gt; mean, she comes to Judah.
[1:05] Listen, all she does is lay out the
[1:08] tokens.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; She doesn't argue. She doesn't persuade.
[1:13] She doesn't beg. She doesn't do
[1:15] anything.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; She said, "I'm pregnant by the man who
[1:19] owns these. You discern whose these
[1:22] are."
[1:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. basically saying, "You decide
[1:26] whether I'm righteous or not."
[1:29] &gt;&gt; She had to trust in Judah to be a
[1:31] righteous judge.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; Because if Judah protected himself and
[1:35] he covered it up and he lied, she was
[1:38] being burnt.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; But Judah is the judging tribe. Judah is
[1:44] the king tribe. Amen.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is the lion of the tribe of
[1:49] Judah, the judge, the righteous judge.
[1:51] And here I in the story of Ruth, Boaz is
[1:54] playing the part of Christ.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; In the judges here, Judah is playing the
[1:59] part of Christ as the judge to judge
[2:00] righteously. Amen. And he looks at the
[2:03] tokens and he realizes, Amen, this woman
[2:05] is more righteous than I. And he
[2:07] declares her virtuous. He declares her
[2:09] sinless. He declares her right. Amen.
[2:11] Why? She came. What? What was her s
[2:14] salvation? She came to the point of no
[2:16] return.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19] This is the way I believe this message,
[2:21] friends. It's the point of no return.
[2:23] There is no halfway believing the truth.
[2:26] Amen. Brother BM's a prophet. He's right
[2:27] about this, but he's wrong about this.
[2:29] And he got some of these things right,
[2:30] but I don't understand about that. And
[2:32] I'll still take my own idea on these
[2:33] things, and I want to mix it with what I
[2:35] feel about that. Hey, that's going to
[2:37] make you miserable.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; But if we come to this message, we got
[2:42] to come like Ruth coming to Boaz. And we
[2:44] got TO COME LIKE TAMAR giving herself
[2:46] completely up. Amen. her reputation and
[2:48] everything, giving it completely up for
[2:50] redemption, for the right to receive the
[2:52] seed from the seedgiver himself.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; Trusting in his character, not mine.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; Trusting in the character of Boaz,
[3:04] trusting in the character of Judah, and
[3:07] now I trust in the character of Christ,
[3:09] who is the messenger, who is the
[3:11] bridegroom, who is the headship, who is
[3:13] the word that's been restored. I've seen
[3:15] enough to know he's trustworthy.
