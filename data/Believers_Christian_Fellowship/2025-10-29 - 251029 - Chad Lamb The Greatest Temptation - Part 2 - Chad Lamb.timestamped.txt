[7:38] Let's go to QC. [music] I am determined.
[7:40] I've made up my mind.
[7:43] I am determined. [singing and music]
[7:46] I've made up my mind that I'll serve

[7:55] I'll leave [music] this old world
[7:57] [singing] and its treasures behind.
[8:01] Oh, I'll serve the Lord. [music]
[8:06] I'll follow [singing] wherever he leads
[8:11] me. [music]
[8:12] and I'll pasture wherever [singing]
[8:15] he feeds me. Oh, I [music] am [singing]
[8:20] determined. I made up my mind that I
[8:26] serve the Lord.
[8:29] Yes, [singing and music] I am
[8:31] determined. I made up my mind and I
[8:37] [music and singing] serve the Lord.
[8:41] Oh, [music and singing] I'll leave this
[8:43] old world and his treasures behind.
[8:48] I'll serve the Lord.
[8:52] I'll follow [singing] wherever [music]
[8:56] he leads me. I'll pasture wherever he
[9:02] leads [music and singing]
[9:03] me. Oh, I am determined. I made up my
[9:09] mind [music]
[9:10] that I [singing]
[9:12] serve the Lord.
[9:15] Amen. I want to serve you. [music]
[9:18] It's close to thee is where the Chad
[9:20] comes tonight. Thou my everlasting
[9:26] portion,
[9:27] more than [music and singing] friend
[9:30] or life to me.
[9:33] All along [singing]
[9:35] [music] life's pilgrim journey.
[9:39] Savior, let [music] me walk with thee.
[9:43] [singing]
[9:44] Oh, close to thee.
[9:48] Close to [music] thee.
[9:50] Oh, [singing] close to thee.
[9:54] [music] Close to thee.
[9:57] All [singing] along
[9:59] life's pilgrim journey.
[10:02] [music] Savior, let me walk [singing]
[10:06] with thee.
[10:08] Not [music] for ease
[10:11] or [singing] worldly pleasures, [music]

[10:56] Amen.
[10:58] God bless you. Let me sing that verse
[11:00] one or that chorus one more time.
[11:03] [music]
[11:04] &gt;&gt; Close to thee. [singing]
[11:07] Close to thee. [music]
[11:10] Close to [singing] thee.
[11:13] Close to thee. [music]
[11:16] All along [singing]
[11:19] my pilgrim jour.
[11:22] [music] Savior, let
[11:25] me [singing] walk with thee.
[11:29] Is that your desire? It's to walk close
[11:32] to him. Amen. I'm so thankful to have a
[11:35] heavenly father, a shepherd who wants me
[11:37] close to him. No matter how much I want
[11:40] to be close to him, if he didn't want
[11:42] it, there would be no hope for me. But
[11:44] because he desired it first, I can
[11:47] desire it now. Let's bow our heads
[11:50] together. Dear [snorts] heavenly father,
[11:52] we're so thankful, Lord Jesus, that you
[11:55] have drawn us close to you. You have
[11:57] given us a call and you've bidden us to
[11:59] come near. [music] And Lord, you wanted
[12:01] to restore fellowship in this end time,
[12:03] Lord. And so, you've come yourself to
[12:06] unveil yourself to us, Lord. That we
[12:08] might see you, to know you. And as you
[12:11] unveil yourself to us, you're unveiling
[12:13] ourselves to us, Lord, so that we might
[12:16] see, Lord, the relationship you've
[12:17] desired since before the foundation of
[12:19] the world. [music]
[12:20] And God, that's our desire, God. We want
[12:23] to walk in that more and more day by
[12:25] day. And as you've drawn us together
[12:27] this evening, Lord, may it become more
[12:29] of a reality than ever before. [music]
[12:31] God, may all traditions and all vanity
[12:33] and all pride fade away. And may the
[12:36] reality of this hour we're walking in,
[12:38] may it become a stark reality to us. May
[12:41] we see it with fresh vision with eyes
[12:44] cleared by the ice in this hour. And may
[12:47] you anoint us to receive this precious
[12:49] word. And may it change us, Lord, and
[12:52] bring us into your very image, into your
[12:54] very likeness, so we can be your
[12:56] reflection on this earth. Pray you have
[12:59] your way with this vessel of mine. Would
[13:01] you come, would you break the bread of
[13:03] life and speak the words of eternal
[13:04] life. May you shape us, Lord, by your
[13:07] word. May you mold us, Lord, into your
[13:09] image by this word. In Jesus Christ's
[13:12] name we pray. Amen.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. It's good to be
[13:17] here together this evening. While you're
[13:19] standing, if you'll take your Bibles and
[13:21] turn to the book of James, we're going
[13:23] to pick up there and we're going to
[13:24] continue on from Sunday. I didn't have a
[13:27] chance to finish the thoughts that I
[13:28] had, so I was going to do that today,
[13:30] Lord willing. I also wanted to let you
[13:33] know that this Sunday, Brother Jim
[13:35] Swanson will be ministering over at
[13:37] Bible Believers. He'll be doing two
[13:38] services, the morning and the afternoon.
[13:40] So, please remember to keep him in
[13:42] prayer as he'll be serving over there.
[13:44] And also wanted to let you know that we
[13:46] have a special guest. Brother George
[13:48] Wyers will be here this coming Sunday.
[13:51] Brother George is not a minister. He's
[13:52] not ministering, but he's got quite a
[13:54] testimony of how the Lord's used him to
[13:56] do outreach and missions work in Japan
[13:59] uh very uniquely, very supernaturally.
[14:01] And so I've asked him to share that
[14:02] testimony in our Sunday evening service
[14:04] for communion. So before communion,
[14:06] Brother George Wyers is going to share
[14:08] his testimony with us. So uh just be
[14:10] praying for him, be praying for that.
[14:12] And I'm excited for you to hear it. It's
[14:14] quite remarkable, quite amazing what the
[14:16] Lord has done for that brother and
[14:18] through that brother and him not being a
[14:20] minister, not called to the ministry,
[14:22] but just a brother who God put laid a
[14:24] burden on his heart and did wonderful
[14:26] miraculous things through that burden.
[14:28] And so I want him to share that with you
[14:30] all. So we're looking forward to that.
[14:32] Amen. So that'll be this Sunday in the
[14:34] second service. Uh if we could uh let's
[14:37] look at James chapter 1 here
[14:40] and let's go to verse 13.
[14:46] Let no man say when he is tempted, I am
[14:49] tempted of God. For God cannot be
[14:51] tempted with evil, neither tempteth he
[14:53] any man. But every man is tempted when
[14:56] he is drawn away of his own lust and
[14:58] enticed. Then when lust hath conceived,
[15:02] it bringeth forth sin, and sin when it
[15:03] is finished, bringeth forth death. May
[15:06] God bless you as you have your seats.
[15:08] Amen. May the Lord bless us now. Give us
[15:12] that Isaav God
[15:13] &gt;&gt; that we might see. Let us receive
[15:15] instruction. We can bring up the
[15:16] PowerPoint, please. We're going to go
[15:18] into the greatest temptation part two.
[15:20] So this is just a continuation from the
[15:22] thought on Sunday. And as we laid out
[15:24] then we realized that when when every
[15:27] man verse 14 every man is tempted when
[15:30] he is drawn away of his own lust and
[15:33] enticed. So we found the great uh the
[15:36] great problem with temptation lies
[15:38] within us. So we don't blame others when
[15:42] we're tempted or when we fail or fall in
[15:44] temptation. It's not a blame game. It's
[15:46] not time to attach blame because of
[15:48] these people or because of this
[15:50] situation, because of these
[15:51] circumstances. But every man is tempted
[15:54] when he is drawn away of his own lust
[15:56] and enticed. So the problem was not
[15:58] around me. The problem was in me.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; So that's where I need to overcome by
[16:03] the spirit of God is to overcome me.
[16:05] Overcome the old nature. And then when
[16:07] lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth
[16:09] sin. And sin when it is finished
[16:11] bringeth forth death. Let's turn over to
[16:14] First John chapter 2.
[16:17] Both of these scriptures we we spent
[16:19] some time on Sunday, but we'll get into
[16:21] it. 1 John
[16:25] chapter 2 verse1 15. There's going to be
[16:27] a little bit of overlap between Sunday
[16:29] and today and as we carry on our
[16:31] thought. 1 John chapter 2:1 15. Love not
[16:35] the world, neither the things that are
[16:37] in the world. If any man love the world,
[16:40] the love of the father is not in him.
[16:42] For all that is in the world, the lust
[16:45] of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and
[16:47] the pride of life, is not of the father,
[16:50] but is of the world. And the world
[16:52] passeth away, and the lust thereof, but
[16:54] he that doeth the will of God abideth
[16:56] forever.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; So, who abides forever? He that do the
[16:59] will of God. What is the will of the
[17:01] God? His word is his will.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been taught so well by the
[17:06] prophet of this age, his word is his
[17:08] will. Amen. And so, not not giving over
[17:11] to the lust. So what is the world? What
[17:13] are the things of the world? For this is
[17:17] for all that is in the world, the lust
[17:19] of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the
[17:21] pride of the life is not of the father,
[17:23] but is of the world.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we were talking Sunday
[17:27] saying you don't have to leave the
[17:29] church to be in the world.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to you don't have
[17:33] to leave the fellowship, leave the
[17:35] church, and and and leave all these
[17:37] things to be worldly. Amen. because it's
[17:39] not what we always thought the world was
[17:41] or worldly was. We start looking to the
[17:43] end of something to the extreme where it
[17:45] takes us to and say, "Well, that's
[17:47] worldly and and that would be whatever
[17:49] that extreme would be in our lives." But
[17:51] it all starts with the lust of the
[17:53] flesh, the lust of the eyes, or the
[17:54] pride of life. And we could be
[17:56] struggling with that sitting in our seat
[17:58] this evening.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that's what we're fighting
[18:01] against. We're fighting against the
[18:03] world. We're fighting against the things
[18:04] of the world. and we're fighting against
[18:06] them as they try to work in us in our
[18:09] old nature. Amen. But thank God that
[18:11] he's given us his word and he's given us
[18:12] his spirit to overcome by.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Let's look here at at
[18:19] Matthew chapter 6.
[18:22] Take heed that you do not your arms
[18:24] before men. We read this scripture as
[18:25] well. To be seen of them, otherwise you
[18:28] have no reward of your father which is
[18:29] in heaven.
[18:31] Therefore, when thou doest thine alms,
[18:33] do not sound a trumpet before thee as
[18:35] the hypocrites do in the synagogues and
[18:37] in the streets, that they may have glory
[18:39] of men. Verily, I say unto you, they
[18:41] have their reward. But when thou doest
[18:43] arms, let not the left hand know what
[18:45] the right hand doeth, that thine arms
[18:47] may be in secret, and the father which
[18:49] seeth in secret himself shall reward
[18:51] thee openly. So that we see and we
[18:55] understand that the Pharisees, Amen,
[18:57] they were they were giving their alms.
[18:59] They were doing their good deeds. Amen.
[19:00] They were doing them openly for all to
[19:02] see because they wanted the respect and
[19:05] admiration of the people. And and Jesus
[19:08] says, "And they have their reward."
[19:10] That's what they wanted. That's what
[19:11] they got. But he says, "Do your arms
[19:13] secretly
[19:15] &gt;&gt; and the father which sees secret himself
[19:17] shall reward thee openly." Amen. So this
[19:20] it's so wonderful how Jesus brings this
[19:22] down to saying if you want to do
[19:24] something good, if you want to give to
[19:26] someone and and you want to help, you
[19:28] want to do an alms, amen, do it
[19:29] secretly.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Because who are you doing it for
[19:32] anyways? If you're doing it for the
[19:34] father, he'll see.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Nothing's hid from him. If you're really
[19:38] doing a WORK FOR GOD, YOU DON'T need to
[19:40] tell anybody you're doing it because God
[19:42] already knows. But when you begin to
[19:44] sound the trumpet and declare the good
[19:46] de deed and do it in front of others or
[19:48] make sure it comes up in conversation
[19:50] some way so everybody else knows what
[19:52] you did then you didn't do it for God
[19:55] alone. You did it for yourself.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Because if you if you DO IT FOR GOD, GOD
[20:00] SEES ALL. GOD KNOWS ALL and God
[20:02] understands what's happening. You don't
[20:04] need another living soul to know you
[20:06] ever did it if you did it for God. Amen.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; So, it's that's a clear indication of
[20:12] whether it's for God or not.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; If if SOMEHOW YOU'RE JUST BUSTING TO LET
[20:16] SOMEBODY KNOW and the conversation gets
[20:18] to a certain point and you can kind of
[20:19] drop it in and give a little hint, you
[20:21] know, somebody gave something to them to
[20:23] help them out one time.
[20:32] Re We all laugh cuz we've all seen it
[20:34] and we've probably all done it.
[20:38] So, we're just laughing at ourselves
[20:41] &gt;&gt; cuz that's human nature. That's the
[20:43] things of the world.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; That's the world that's trying to get a
[20:47] hold of us and trying to enter in and
[20:49] trying to mess everything up. But we
[20:51] don't need to prove anything to God. God
[20:53] already knows. Amen. And we don't need
[20:55] to do we don't need to let God know.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; He knows.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; So why let anybody else know? Let's
[21:02] continue on with the same scripture
[21:04] passage. And when thou prayest, thou
[21:06] shalt not be as the hypocrites are, for
[21:08] they love to pray standing in the
[21:10] synagogues and in the corners of the
[21:11] streets, that they may be seen of men.
[21:13] Verily I say unto you, they have their
[21:15] reward. But thou, when thou prayest,
[21:17] enter into the closet, and when thou has
[21:19] shut thy door, pray to thy father which
[21:21] is in secret, and thy father which seeth
[21:23] in secret shall reward thee openly.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; I say this, don't ever worry about
[21:28] whether God knows what you did or not.
[21:30] God knows.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; I say this, too. I've said it many
[21:33] times, but God keeps good books. He owes
[21:35] no debt to nobody. You will never render
[21:38] a service to the Lord or serve God or
[21:40] worship God in any way that God will not
[21:42] repay. Even Jesus said, "The Father
[21:44] which seeth in secret shall reward thee
[21:46] openly." Even though you don't do
[21:48] anything for a reward, God is always a
[21:51] rewarder.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; He can't be outdone. You can't outgive.
[21:55] You can't outdo God. You can't serve him
[21:58] more than he ever repays. Amen. And God
[22:01] keeps good books and he never loses
[22:02] track of anything. So, we don't need to
[22:04] do anything to be seen of men.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Amenise.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we just need to be able
[22:10] to judge ourselves. And that would be so
[22:12] wonderful if we were better at judging
[22:14] ourselves. Let's turn to Matthew 23.
[22:25] Matthew 23.
[22:28] I wrote verse two on here, but let's
[22:30] start at verse one. Matthew 23.
[22:35] And let's go to verse one. Then spake
[22:38] Jesus to the multitude and to his
[22:40] disciples, saying, "The scribes and the
[22:42] Pharisees sit in Moses's seat. All
[22:45] therefore whatsoever they bid you
[22:47] observe that observe and do, but do not
[22:50] ye after their works. For they say and
[22:52] do not. For they bind heavy burdens and
[22:55] grievous to be borne and lay them on
[22:56] men's shoulders, but they themselves
[22:59] will not move them with one of their
[23:00] fingers. But all their works they do for
[23:03] to be seen of men. They make broad their
[23:06] felactories and enlarge the borders of
[23:08] their garments. The felactories were a
[23:10] little a little box or a little case
[23:12] that they would have scriptures rolled
[23:13] up into and they would wear them on
[23:15] their forearm or on their forehead and
[23:17] they would have a band of leather that
[23:18] would tie them on and they would broaden
[23:20] those and make those big so everybody
[23:21] could tell they're wearing the
[23:22] scriptures. and they broaden their
[23:24] felactories and they they make broad
[23:26] their garments and love the uppermost
[23:29] rooms of the feast and the chief seats
[23:30] in the synagogues and the greetings in
[23:33] the marketplace and to be called of men
[23:35] rabbi rabbi and the question is who are
[23:39] they serving?
[23:41] &gt;&gt; They're serving in appearance they're
[23:43] serving God but they're serving
[23:44] themselves because they want the
[23:46] attention that comes from it. Let's jump
[23:48] down to verse 27.
[23:50] Uh same chapter verse 27.
[23:54] Jesus says, "Woe unto you scribes and
[23:55] Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are like
[23:57] unto whited sepilers, which indeed
[23:59] appear beautiful outward, but are within
[24:01] full of dead men's bones and of all
[24:03] uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly
[24:06] appear righteous unto men, but within
[24:08] you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity."
[24:12] I say, God, help us.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the problem with religion
[24:17] and being religious and it does so much
[24:19] of it is for an outward appearance and
[24:21] for a show or for some sort of
[24:23] acceptance or some some some sort of
[24:26] whatever that it's done for and what it
[24:28] was done for in that days. But but the
[24:30] real true genuine faith in God is
[24:33] secret. Amen. The genuine faith in God
[24:35] is the right motive behind it. And
[24:37] that's what we want. We want to move by
[24:39] the right motive and we want to do the
[24:41] right thing. And we find out that this
[24:43] is all because of the lust of the flesh,
[24:45] the lust of the eyes, the pride of life.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; This is the world creeping into the
[24:50] religious service
[24:52] &gt;&gt; and their service to God. Amen. And I
[24:54] want to go back when when we say back in
[24:57] James, I just want to refer to
[24:58] something. He says, "Let no man say when
[25:00] he is tempted, he is tempted of God."
[25:02] Amen. But brother Benham said, "God
[25:03] loves to test his children." AMEN. BUT
[25:06] GOD ALLOWS HIS CHILDREN to be tested,
[25:09] but God's not the one tempting you.
[25:10] Amen. and his adversary is the one doing
[25:12] the tempting. Amen. Remember in Matthew
[25:15] chapter 4 when Jesus was led of the
[25:17] spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
[25:19] of the devil.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Who led him there?
[25:22] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God. What did he lead him
[25:24] there for? To be tempted of the devil.
[25:26] Who did the tempting? The devil, not
[25:28] God.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; But God led him there because God loves
[25:31] to test his children. God loves to prove
[25:34] that they have the goods.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. When when Job WAS TESTED,
[25:40] WHO GAVE permission for his testing?
[25:42] &gt;&gt; God gave permission. But who did the
[25:44] testing? Satan did the testing.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; So, no one can SAY, "GOD TEMPTED ME."
[25:48] GOD didn't tempt you. The devil tempted
[25:50] you. And he tempted you by a lust THAT
[25:53] WAS ALREADY INSIDE of you. He was
[25:55] working on something inside of you.
[25:57] Amen. BUT THAT WASN'T GOD. GOD MAY HAVE
[25:59] TAKEN the hedge away. God may have
[26:00] permitted it to happen. But God's not
[26:02] the ONE WHO TEMPTED. THE adversary did
[26:04] it. And he's playing on something within
[26:06] us.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; And maybe God allows it to happen so
[26:11] that he can expose what's laying there
[26:13] needs to come out.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember when Jesus looked at
[26:17] Peter and he says Satan desires to sift
[26:20] the wheat. Amen. But I've prayed for you
[26:22] that your faith fail not. Amen. Satan
[26:24] was DESIRING TO TEST TO tempt Peter to
[26:28] sift him as wheat. And Peter or Satan
[26:30] got the permission to do it. Amen. But
[26:32] God wasn't the one sifting him. It was
[26:34] Satan that was doing the sifting.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But God permitted it, of
[26:41] course, but God wasn't the one doing it.
[26:45] If we look at this scripture in
[26:48] Jeremiah, we read this one again on
[26:50] Sunday too. But oh Lord of hosts that
[26:52] judge righteously, that tryth the reigns
[26:54] and the heart. The resigns is your
[26:56] inward part, your inward, they believed
[26:58] it was your seat of emotions and your
[27:00] heart is the center of your thought
[27:01] life. And God judges righteously and try
[27:05] the reigns in the heart. God will find
[27:08] out what's in us.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; And what is in us will be exposed. And I
[27:14] say thank God.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; None of us want to be exposed. You know
[27:18] that friends, none of us want to be laid
[27:19] bare. None of us want our hypocrisy open
[27:22] to the world and and and and tried and
[27:24] found one thing and found the the
[27:26] deepest part of your inward being have
[27:28] some sort of corruption or defilement.
[27:30] BUT WHEN GOD TRIES and allows that to
[27:32] come out, I say, "Thank God." Amen. I
[27:35] don't want the world. I don't love the
[27:36] world and I don't love the things of the
[27:38] world because I love the things of God,
[27:40] uh, the things of the world. I don't
[27:41] love God.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; SO, I MAY STRUGGLE WITH THE THINGS OF
[27:45] THE WORLD, BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS, I
[27:46] DON'T love them.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; I may find myself struggling or failing,
[27:50] but I don't love it. I hate that thing.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm fighting fighting and
[27:54] fighting against. Amen. Let's look here
[27:57] at John 12. We're going to keep working
[28:00] this thought.
[28:02] Then took Mary a pound of ointment of
[28:04] spikenard, very costly, and anointed the
[28:06] feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with
[28:09] her hair, and the house was filled with
[28:10] the odor of the ointment. Then said one
[28:12] of his disciples, Judas's Scariot,
[28:14] Simon's son, which should betray him.
[28:17] Why was not this ointment sold for 300 p
[28:20] and given to the poor? This he said, not
[28:22] that he cared for the poor, but because
[28:25] he was a thief and had the bag. He was a
[28:28] treasurer. And bear what was put in.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; He was dipping into the treasury.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Then said Jesus, "Let her alone against
[28:36] the day of my bearing has she kept this.
[28:38] For the poor always you have with you,
[28:40] but me you have not always."
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember when I gave you a
[28:47] definition, just my thought on the
[28:49] greatest temptation? The greatest
[28:51] temptation for a child of God is not to
[28:53] do something evil, but to do something
[28:55] good for the wrong reasons.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; Or to do something right, but not
[29:01] according to the word.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; You got that? To me, that's the greatest
[29:06] temptation. Not to go out and become a
[29:08] drunker tomorrow, not to go to a house
[29:10] of prostitution, but the greatest
[29:11] temptation, the ones that's tripping up
[29:13] the children of God, is to do something
[29:15] that's good or do something that looks
[29:17] right. Amen. But there's a wrong motive
[29:20] inside of me behind it.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; That's a terrible temptation. And that's
[29:24] where we get tempted to do something
[29:26] wrong because technically it's right.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; But inside it's wrong.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; BUT OUTSIDE IT'S RIGHT, BUT inside it's
[29:35] wrong.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; And that's the temptation because when I
[29:38] do what looks right, like the Pharisees
[29:41] when they gave alms when they blew the
[29:42] trumpet and they dropped money into the
[29:44] treasury. Amen. They looked right, but
[29:47] inside they were wrong.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; SO THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THEM DOING
[29:51] wrong because they could do wrong and
[29:53] look right because all they cared about
[29:55] was pleasing men and getting respect to
[29:57] men. They weren't interested in pleasing
[29:59] God so that they could do that that
[30:02] goodlooking deed with a wrong heart. But
[30:04] they were satisfied because they got the
[30:06] result they were after.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the temptation. Amen. For a
[30:13] child of God, we can be tempted because
[30:15] it's not as though everybody's going to
[30:17] say, "I'm wrong." No. Everybody may say,
[30:19] "I'm right." And everybody may say, "I'm
[30:21] doing right." It's not the deed that I'm
[30:24] doing that's wrong. It's the motive
[30:26] behind the deed I'm doing that's wrong.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; And that's the secret of our reigns and
[30:32] of our heart that GOD IS TRYING. WHY AM
[30:35] I DOING what I'm doing? And that's a
[30:37] good question to ask ourselves. Why am I
[30:40] doing what I'm doing?
[30:42] Not whether what I'm doing is RIGHT OR
[30:43] WRONG, BUT WHY AM I DOING what I'm
[30:46] doing?
[30:47] &gt;&gt; That's a very good question, friends.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so
[30:54] Judas was a thief,
[30:59] but the thief heart of Judas couldn't
[31:02] say, "I want that money."
[31:08] &gt;&gt; So, what does the thieving heart of
[31:10] Judas say? It's got to be something
[31:12] religious.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; IT GOT TO BE, WHY WAS THIS WASTED? WHY
[31:16] WAS this expensive ointment? Why was it
[31:18] all poured out and why WAS IT WASTED?
[31:20] WHY? IT SHOULD HAVE RATHER BEEN sold and
[31:22] given to THE POOR.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD,
[31:27] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THAT SOUNDS REALLY WHO'S GOING TO
[31:29] SAY, "JUDAS, you devil." He was trying
[31:31] to take care of the poor.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Nobody looked at him when he said that
[31:37] and said, "You wretched, wicked, evil
[31:40] devil." Yeah,
[31:42] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S WHAT HE WAS.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; HE WAS A DEVIL FROM THE BEGINNING. He
[31:46] had the heart OF A THIEF ALL ALONG. HE
[31:48] WANTED THAT money because he he lusted
[31:51] for it. He had lust. He had the world in
[31:53] his heart. And when he looked AT THAT,
[31:55] HE COULD NOT SAY, "I want the money."
[31:58] ALL HE COULD SAY WAS, "This was wasted.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; It should have BEEN SOLD AND GIVEN TO
[32:04] THE POOR." RELIGIOUS RHETORIC. Fig leaf
[32:07] cloaking an evil heart.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS SAW THROUGH IT AND HE SAYS,
[32:13] "Let her alone. It gets a day in my
[32:14] bearing house." She kept this. This
[32:16] isn't wasted. She served the purpose she
[32:18] was intended to serve with this.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "For the poor you always
[32:23] you have with you." I love how he said
[32:25] this. Hey, listen. For the poor always
[32:27] you have with me, but me you have not
[32:29] always. Listen, don't worry, Judas. If
[32:32] you love the poor so much, you can spend
[32:34] the rest of your life serving them.
[32:35] You'll never run out of poor people.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[32:39] BUT IT WASN'T THE POOR HE WAS INTERESTED
[32:41] IN. IT WAS IN THIS MONEY that was spent.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, God help us all.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; This is why the religious world is so
[32:51] distasteful.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; This is what it does. It attaches a fig
[32:55] leaf over nakedness.
[32:58] In Luke 9 verse 51 it says, "And it came
[33:02] to pass when the time was come that he
[33:04] should be received up, he steadfastly
[33:06] set his face to go to Jerusalem and sent
[33:08] messengers before his face and they went
[33:10] and entered into a village of the
[33:12] Samaritans to make ready for him." And
[33:14] they did not receive him because his
[33:16] face was as though he would go to
[33:18] Jerusalem.
[33:19] And when his disciples James and John
[33:21] saw this, they said,"Lord, wilt thou
[33:23] that we command fire to come down from
[33:26] heaven and consume them even as Elias
[33:28] did?"
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. What are they quoting? The
[33:32] scriptures.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; But he turned and rebuked them and said,
[33:37] "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye
[33:40] are of. For the Son of Man has not come
[33:42] to destroy men's life, but to save
[33:44] them." And they went to another village.
[33:46] here. They got under the wrong spirit.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; But what did that wrong spirit move them
[33:52] to do? They got angry. They were
[33:54] offended. They were upset that Jesus was
[33:57] not welcomed into their village. Amen.
[33:59] And so, in order to express their
[34:01] offense and their their dissatisfaction
[34:04] and their anger towards these people,
[34:06] they couldn't just say, "Let's go kill
[34:08] them." They have to have a religious
[34:10] excuse to vent the anger.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THEY FIND SOMETHING IN THE
[34:15] SCRIPTURES AND THEY SAID, "OH, UM,
[34:18] SHOULDN'T WE DO LIKE ELIAS DID AND CALL
[34:20] FIRE down from heaven to consume THEM?"
[34:22] AND JESUS SAYS, "YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
[34:24] SPIRIT YOU'RE OPERATING BY.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; This isn't THE SEASON FOR THAT. THIS IS
[34:28] NOT THE HOUR FOR THAT. THE SON OF MAN IS
[34:30] NOT COME NOT TO DESTROY MEN'S LIVES, BUT
[34:33] TO SAVE THEM. YOU'RE IN THE WRONG
[34:34] ANOINTING. YOU'RE UNDER THE WRONG
[34:36] SPIRIT. YOU MAY BE QUOTING SCRIPTURE AND
[34:38] MAY BE REFERRING BACK to one OF THE
[34:40] GREATEST PROPHETS OF ALL TIME, BUT
[34:42] YOU'RE ALL OUT OF SEQUENCE WITH THE
[34:44] WORD.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; And you're doing it of your own lust,
[34:51] &gt;&gt; out of your own offense and your own
[34:53] reasonings and your own whatever.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; And you're completely of the wrong
[34:57] spirit.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jes brother Bam says this in the
[35:01] anointed ones. You take any of these
[35:04] false baptisms, false so and so and so,
[35:07] I don't care how real it sounds, how
[35:08] much they try to impersonate, it's a
[35:11] lie. If it's contrary to God's word of
[35:13] this hour,
[35:15] &gt;&gt; that's exactly say, "Well, ours, well,
[35:17] we did this and we did this and our
[35:19] church is this way and that." I don't
[35:21] care what it is. If it's contrary to the
[35:23] written word for this hour, it's a lie.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; God will have nothing to do with it. No
[35:27] matter how sincere, how educated, how
[35:30] smart, how true it sounds, how
[35:32] reasonable it sounds. If it's contrary
[35:34] to the word of this hour.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Do you see the theme?
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; The If it's contrary to the word of this
[35:41] hour.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; If it's contrary to the written word for
[35:45] this hour.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; If it's contrary to the word of this
[35:49] hour.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; IT MAY HAVE BEEN FINE IN previous
[35:53] decades, previous generations, previous
[35:55] dispensation. Amen. But there's a
[35:57] revealed word now. Amen. There's a way
[35:59] of operating now.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. THAT'S WHY WE DON'T GO BACK TO
[36:03] PREVIOUS CHURCH SYSTEMS AND WE DON'T GO
[36:05] BACK TO OLD IDEAS. AMEN. Because there's
[36:08] been a word that's open now. And if it's
[36:10] contrary to God's word of this hour,
[36:13] then it's a lie. It's wrong. It's of the
[36:15] wrong motivation. And here here James
[36:17] AND JOHN WERE WANTING TO OPERATE BACK
[36:19] under another dispensation under Elijah.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; And they were in the wrong season. And
[36:25] they were in THE WRONG DISPENSATION. AND
[36:27] ALTHOUGH THEY HAD SCRIPTURES,
[36:30] &gt;&gt; they were in the wrong application in
[36:32] the wrong season.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; So what season do we have to be in? In
[36:36] the season of the hour.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to say I I just like to say
[36:41] this as we move on. Listen, the message
[36:43] we've we've had the message God has God
[36:46] has granted to us that we've had this
[36:47] message for decades now.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Brother started preaching and and and he
[36:52] started preaching in the 30 1930s. He
[36:55] went into his his uh revival ministry in
[36:58] 1947. Amen. He he came to the opening of
[37:00] the word in 1963. Amen. And God took him
[37:04] home in 1965. And we've been we've had
[37:06] this message now for 60 years.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; And in 60 years, it's constantly
[37:14] unfolding itself.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you've been around, you know,
[37:19] for me, I'm going into my third decade
[37:21] uh uh uh walking with the message and
[37:24] and God revealing the word to me. Some
[37:25] of you are in your fourth decade, fifth
[37:28] decade, maybe sixth decade, amen, of
[37:30] following this word. But I guarantee the
[37:32] word's more open to you now than it was
[37:34] when you started.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? That means we
[37:38] can't even operate the way we operated
[37:41] decades ago because the WORD IS OPENING,
[37:43] BRINGING US into the REVELATION FOR THIS
[37:44] HOUR. AND WE CAN'T GO BACK TO THE WAY WE
[37:46] THOUGHT 10 YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO, 30
[37:49] years ago, BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE WE GOT TO
[37:52] BE UP WHERE THE SPIRIT is now.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; So many things and transition and
[37:56] crossover times. AMEN. THEY WERE MAYBE
[37:59] OKAY. MAYBE THEY WERE WE were learning
[38:01] and the word was unfolding AND MORE
[38:03] BOOKS WERE BEING PRINTED and it WAS
[38:04] BEING PREACHED MORE. AMEN. BUT WE DON'T
[38:06] HAVE THE EXCUSE TODAY THAT WE CAN MAYBE
[38:09] APPLY TO 30, 40 YEARS AGO BECAUSE GOD
[38:11] HAS GIVEN US THE WORD IN EVERY FORMAT WE
[38:13] COULD GET IT. HAS BEEN PREACHED FOR
[38:15] DECADES. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN READING IT
[38:17] AND reading it and STUDYING IT AND
[38:18] PRAYING OVER IT. AND GOD IS REQUIRING
[38:20] MORE OF THE TRUTH IN OUR LIVES.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T GO BACK TO COMPROMISE LIVING
[38:25] AND HALFWAY LIVING AND THINGS THAT MAYBE
[38:27] were confusing A FEW DECADES AGO.
[38:29] THERE'S NO EXCUSE NOW. WE'VE GOT THE
[38:31] FULL VINDICATED WORD OF GOD.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO GOD IS REQUIRING
[38:38] not that we live in a hangover
[38:40] dispensation or a crossover time or A
[38:42] CONFUSING TIME. HE'S REQUIRING US TO GET
[38:45] WITH THE SPIRIT, GET WITH THE program
[38:48] &gt;&gt; today.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's easier to live in what
[38:57] our parents or grandparents or
[38:58] great-grandparents thought was okay.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Even in the message,
[39:03] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[39:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US STILL TO OPERATE
[39:06] WITH LUST OF the flesh, lust of the
[39:07] eyes.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Pride of life.
[39:13] some things maybe weren't understood as
[39:15] clearly as they are today. Maybe maybe
[39:17] we were still learning and still growing
[39:19] and some things about marriage and
[39:21] divorce and maybe some things about
[39:22] who's eligible to preach and not. Maybe
[39:24] some of those things were a LITTLE
[39:26] UNCERTAIN, BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE WE'RE AT
[39:28] TODAY.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; AND JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO
[39:30] DID IT AND it was okay and seemed
[39:32] blessed 30, 40 years ago doesn't mean
[39:34] God's HONORING IT TODAY. WHAT GOD wants
[39:37] is he want us to come to this word, to
[39:39] the fullness of the word
[39:41] &gt;&gt; AND REJECT WHATEVER MOTIVATION WOULD
[39:44] MOTIVATE us to hold on to something
[39:45] else.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; To lay ourselves bare.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. To come to the reality of the word
[39:53] and to be fully exposed and not allow
[39:56] any selfish desire to have us going back
[39:58] to what was allowed way back when or
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah, THAT'S RIGHT. LISTEN, I DON'T
[40:02] THINK THE OPENING of the word and God
[40:04] revealing the word I listen, this is me
[40:06] personally, and I'm sorry if I'm wrong,
[40:09] BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE that the more God
[40:12] unveils himself, the more like the world
[40:14] the church will look like.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; There's no way. I don't believe that one
[40:18] bit that as God unfolds himself more, WE
[40:21] GET MORE COMPROMISE and we let down the
[40:22] bars more and we let more of the old
[40:24] things of the old DENOMINATION CREEP IN.
[40:26] HOW CAN THAT BE WHEN HE'S REVEALING MORE
[40:28] OF HIMSELF?
[40:30] IT SHOULD BE A SEPARATION. THE WORD
[40:32] SHOULD BE SEPARATING US OUT OF THE LUST
[40:34] OF THE FLESH, THE LUST OF THE EYES, the
[40:36] pride of life.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; How can it BE THAT WE'RE GROWING SO MUCH
[40:41] IN THE MESSAGE? AMEN. AND WE'VE COME TO
[40:43] SUCH A REVELATION THAT WE can allow
[40:45] allow things
[40:47] &gt;&gt; to creep in that we had once kicked out.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't that's me personal.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that's the way we're
[40:57] going.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we should be living a
[40:59] more sanctified, consecrated, separated
[41:01] life.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Separated from the things of the flesh
[41:04] that pull us
[41:06] &gt;&gt; towards the world.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is constantly bringing us
[41:12] higher, friends.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; And [clears throat] how could he be
[41:15] bringing us higher and not requiring
[41:18] more?
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; That's the way it's always been.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Look at this message and standing in the
[41:27] gap. This is where brother Brandham
[41:29] faces a tremendous personal temptation
[41:33] and he comes and standing in the gap and
[41:35] he tells us all about it.
[41:38] And he said,
[41:40] "I'm going to black it out.
[41:43] I know what's happening. I know it
[41:46] because I'm a human being and I sat
[41:47] where you sat and I've done what you
[41:49] do." [laughter]
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; But Brother Brandham's coming facing
[41:54] this tremendous temp. He's he's got a
[41:57] personal temptation
[41:59] and he gets a correction from the Lord.
[42:02] But I want to look at that temptation.
[42:04] We've looked at it many times, but I
[42:05] want to look at it in the light of what
[42:07] we're talking about now.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; And you all know that he's discouraged
[42:15] because he's preached what to him was
[42:17] was was the whole purpose of his
[42:20] ministry, the opening of those seals.
[42:23] And it wasn't noticed. it was rejected
[42:25] or just not even understood
[42:28] and he thought that the people should
[42:29] have heard it and more and more people
[42:30] were rejecting him all of the time. He
[42:33] was being pushed out of all the circles
[42:34] he used to be in. Amen. and and and he
[42:37] was personally wounded by that and he
[42:40] had a rejection complex anyways from the
[42:41] time he was a child because of an
[42:43] alcoholic father and growing up in
[42:45] poverty and all of this was affecting
[42:46] him and he was wanting to run away and
[42:49] move go up into the wilderness and stay
[42:52] away from people and only only come out
[42:55] when God would bid him come out. But I
[42:57] want you to look at how he handles this
[43:00] and what he says. said, 'Now, I met a
[43:02] man was a Christian and he's got a great
[43:04] country right under Alaska. He's talking
[43:06] about Bud Southwick, the guide. And I
[43:08] had made up in my mind that being
[43:10] [clears throat] that I had left here and
[43:11] gone west, that I would take my wife and
[43:13] kind of trap her into something.
[43:16] I'd get her up there and I'd become a
[43:18] guide. And then if the Lord wanted me to
[43:20] do something, I'd let my hair grow out
[43:22] and my whiskers and I'd go back in there
[43:24] and be a guide. There's only about two
[43:27] or three Indians live back in that
[43:28] country there. I'd just be a guide and
[43:30] I'd help Bud. And if the Lord wanted me
[43:32] to do anything, then I'd say, "All
[43:34] right, Lord." He'd give me a vision. I
[43:36] would slip on out.
[43:38] This is good.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham's not running away from
[43:43] religion. He's not running away from
[43:45] God.
[43:48] He's still intense. If God tells me to
[43:50] do something, I'll go do it.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:53] He goes on and says, "I I say to the
[43:55] people, I've never regarded myself.
[43:57] Anybody knows this, but people have
[43:58] said, 'Brother Brandham, the Lord called
[44:00] you to be his prophet.' Well, I've never
[44:02] regarded myself as that." But I began to
[44:04] get to the time that I was about ready
[44:05] to do it to think, well, maybe I am. If
[44:09] I am, I'll live back in the wilderness.
[44:11] And I live back in the wilderness, then
[44:13] I'll be his prophecy. And then if he
[44:15] wants to send me somewhere, and while
[44:17] he's not using me, then I'll sure catch
[44:19] some fine fish and do some things. Of
[44:21] course, that was kind of a selfish
[44:23] attitude.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; See, because I wanted to do that.
[44:29] Now, it isn't just exactly the thing
[44:30] that's to do. And now, I had that made
[44:32] up in my mind to do that.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Vandom, one thing I I not one
[44:37] thing, but one of the many things that I
[44:39] love about this prophet is he told the
[44:41] truth
[44:42] &gt;&gt; even about himself. He opened up his
[44:43] heart and he revealed what was going on
[44:45] inside. Because this is what goes on
[44:47] inside us, friends. It may not be the
[44:49] same circumstances, but these are the
[44:51] same temptations that we face.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, if I'm God's prophet,
[44:57] I'll go back in the wilderness." And he
[44:59] starts to refer to the prophets of old.
[45:01] And what's he using as his excuse to run
[45:04] away from the people? He's using the
[45:06] Bible.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Because if we're children of God, what
[45:10] we do has to come from the Bible.
[45:14] BUT JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A BIBLE EXAMPLE
[45:16] doesn't make our motive right. It
[45:18] doesn't make our action right. Just
[45:20] because we have a scripture we reference
[45:22] and I'll bring it up today. Just because
[45:23] we have a quote that says what we want
[45:25] to do already in our heart doesn't make
[45:27] it right.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; If the motive behind the action is
[45:31] wrong, it doesn't matter what the quote
[45:32] says.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[45:35] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Here he's referring back to Old
[45:38] Testament prophets and God starts to
[45:41] come down and correct him. And this is
[45:44] what God says. He said, "Your wife will
[45:45] go too. She won't live up there in them
[45:48] hills like that and you'll become a bum
[45:50] just as the dream showed you would." I
[45:53] said, "I don't want to be that, but I
[45:55] don't want to have to live like that. I
[45:57] want to do something different." Now,
[45:59] who's he talking to?
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Talking to God. God, I don't want to
[46:02] live like this. I want to do something
[46:03] different. I was told that you had
[46:05] called me to be a prophet and I want to
[46:07] live in the wilderness like the prophet,
[46:09] but I was using my own excuse so I could
[46:12] hunt my own good.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; And he said, "But that was the prophets
[46:17] of the Old Testament. You've been called
[46:19] to be there in a much higher office than
[46:21] that." He said, "You have more gifts
[46:23] besides that. You was called to pray for
[46:25] the sick and to preach the gospel in the
[46:27] apostolic form. You know of greater
[46:29] things, many great gifts."
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] So God comes and corrects
[46:34] him and and brother Brandham is talking
[46:36] back to God. I don't want to live like
[46:37] that and I've been told and I'm called
[46:39] to be YOUR PROPHET AND I WANT TO LIVE
[46:40] LIKE YOUR PROPHETS LIVE. AND GOD COME
[46:42] AND brought him a correction. He says
[46:43] that was the prophets of THE OLD
[46:45] TESTAMENT. THAT'S NOT THE DISPENSATION
[46:47] you're living in.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; THE THAT WORD WON'T WORK TODAY AND YOU
[46:51] CAN'T HIDE BEHIND THAT scripture to
[46:53] fulfill YOUR OWN LUST. I'VE CALLED YOU
[46:55] TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT TO AN
[46:56] APOSTOLIC FORM.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And brother tells us,
[47:02] I was using, but I was using my own
[47:05] excuse.
[47:07] He was using the scriptures as an excuse
[47:10] to do what he wanted to do because he
[47:12] couldn't handle the pressure. And he was
[47:14] trying to get away. And he was tempted,
[47:16] amen, to run away as a prophet of the
[47:19] Old Testament and live like a prophet.
[47:20] And why was that so appealing to him? Is
[47:23] because he wanted to get away from the
[47:25] pain of rejection and all that he was
[47:27] dealing with. Amen.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; And he loved to hunt and fish too.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; This was the lust of the flesh, the lust
[47:37] of the eyes, the pride of life.
[47:40] Say the pride of life.
[47:42] Listen friends,
[47:44] you only suffer from rejection if you
[47:47] have pride.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; I know it sounds horrible, but it's the
[47:54] truth.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; If you have no pride, Yeah.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Rejection doesn't hurt.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Rejection only hurts if you have pride.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; If somebody calls you a dummy
[48:08] &gt;&gt; and you believe you're a dummy, they
[48:10] didn't hurt your feelings any.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; But if somebody calls you a dummy and
[48:14] you get your feelings hurt, it shows
[48:15] that you didn't think you were.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; No matter how much you say, "I'm just a
[48:19] dummy. I'm just a dummy." And if
[48:20] somebody says, "Yeah, you're a dummy."
[48:21] And you flare up, it just proved that
[48:23] whatever you're saying was a lie.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you believed him, you'd
[48:27] be like, "Yeah, I am. You're right."
[48:30] &gt;&gt; You're no good. You're worthless. If you
[48:31] believed you were no good and worthless,
[48:33] you would say, "Yeah, you're right.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; So, what was he struggling with? What
[48:37] was what was he being tempted with? What
[48:39] was tempting him?" Amen. The same thing
[48:41] that tempts all of us.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; In the same way that we're all tempted.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; And so, he was showing us what what what
[48:51] the greatest temptation is. Brother
[48:53] Benham didn't want to go be evil. He
[48:55] didn't have a desire to leave God, to
[48:57] leave the truth, to forsake everything.
[48:59] What he was trying to do was fulfill
[49:02] maybe a desire he had in some escapism
[49:04] to get away from pain and rejection and
[49:06] suffering and to do some things that he
[49:08] enjoyed doing and see some beautiful
[49:09] country and be what he always wanted to
[49:11] be, a man of the wilderness. And he had
[49:13] this idea of what he wanted and what he
[49:15] liked. Amen. And and and this prophet
[49:17] thing was not becoming what he wanted,
[49:19] what he liked. It was all rejection. So
[49:21] he decided if I'm a prophet, I'll be the
[49:23] kind of prophet was in the Old Testament
[49:25] because he doesn't have a desire to be
[49:27] evil. He has to listen, the devil has to
[49:30] tempt him with something scriptural.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[49:34] &gt;&gt; he's got to He doesn't want to HE
[49:36] DOESN'T WANT TO TURN HIS BACK ON GOD. HE
[49:38] DOESN'T want to disbelieve the word. He
[49:40] doesn't want to go do something evil.
[49:42] But what he wants to do is fulfill
[49:43] personal desires.
[49:46] Personal desires over the will of God.
[49:49] And so God comes down and corrects him.
[49:52] AND I THANK GOD that he corrected him.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; And here's what brother Brennham said.
[49:57] Went on our road to meet Christ at the
[49:59] end time. And I wanted to bring this to
[50:01] you. We're in standing in the gap after
[50:03] he explains all of this. I wanted to
[50:05] bring this to you to show that that you
[50:07] would see and show you the mistake that
[50:10] a man can make yet being sincere.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:16] Brother Mam said he was making a mistake
[50:17] in all of his plans.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; But he was sincere. IT'S NOT THAT HE
[50:21] STOPPED LOVING GOD AND STOPPED LOVING
[50:23] THE WORD AND didn't want to and didn't
[50:25] want to serve God. IT WASN'T THAT. THERE
[50:27] WAS SOMETHING that was inside of him.
[50:29] Amen. Something that that that he was
[50:32] dealing with that was causing him to
[50:34] exert his own will over the will of God.
[50:37] And friends, that's exactly what we
[50:39] struggle with. Yeah. Yeah.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; We got to get to the place where those
[50:42] personal lust AND DESIRES, WE DIE to
[50:45] them daily. Over and over again and
[50:47] again. We die and we die and we die.
[50:49] That's why I said Sunday Paul said, "I
[50:51] DIE DAILY." WHAT'S PAUL DOING DYING
[50:53] DAILY?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; PAUL'S GOT THE HOLY GHOST. HE'S GOT THE
[50:56] REVELATION of Jesus CHRIST. HE'S THE
[50:58] APOSTLE. AMEN. Of the Gentiles. He's the
[51:01] first church age messenger. What's he
[51:03] doing dying daily? CUZ HE'S STILL IN
[51:05] STICKY COCOA FLESH.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; YEAH, that's right.
[51:09] And if Paul had to die daily,
[51:12] what do you think you and I are going to
[51:13] have to do?
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Remember how in Brother Perry Green's
[51:20] testimony, Brother Perry says that
[51:23] Brother Brenham made a statement to him,
[51:25] and I may not have it exactly right, but
[51:27] it's along the lines of he said,
[51:29] "Brother Perry, to where God has me
[51:31] living, most everything you do would be
[51:33] sin for me."
[51:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Something along those lines.
[51:38] And so you begin to realize that as we
[51:40] walk with the Lord, he's requiring more
[51:43] of a self-sacrifice.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; He's requiring us to give him more. Now,
[51:47] it wasn't required for Perry.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; He was in a different place in his
[51:52] GROWTH WITH GOD. GOD WASN'T requiring it
[51:54] of Perry. Brother Bam didn't say you're
[51:56] a sinner. He said for where God has me,
[52:00] most of what you do would be sin for me
[52:02] because I would know better.
[52:05] So God IS GIVING US ALL AN OPPORTUNITY
[52:07] to grow, friends. But as he reveals
[52:09] himself to us and as we grow, he's
[52:11] holding us accountable to what he
[52:13] reveals.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; TRUE. AMEN.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S ASKING US TO GROW.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Grow from wanting to go, you know,
[52:21] out on the town. Grow from wanting to go
[52:25] and watch movies. Grow from wanting to
[52:27] see evil things. Grow from all of those
[52:29] and keep growing. AND NOW I DON'T WANT
[52:32] TO WATCH movies and I don't want to go
[52:33] to evil places and I don't want to go to
[52:35] bars, BUT I STILL GOT THIS FLESH TO
[52:37] OVERCOME.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE I DON'T GO TO
[52:40] WICKED PLACES ANYMORE doesn't mean that
[52:43] I'm not being tempted and doesn't mean
[52:45] that I'm not failing.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT WEARING WORLDLY
[52:50] CLOTHES and I'm not listening to worldly
[52:53] music doesn't mean I'm not still BEING
[52:55] TEMPTED. BUT THE temptation keeps going
[52:57] deeper and deeper and deeper inside of
[52:59] me until I have to die.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; More than I've ever died before.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I told I I told you as a testimony
[53:08] before, I literally
[53:11] cut the cable to our cable television,
[53:15] big pair of wire dikes, and cut it.
[53:20] For a couple weeks, I thought I was
[53:21] dying
[53:24] because I had such a habit. I had such
[53:26] my flesh was so addicted to watching.
[53:29] And it wasn't evil stuff, just watching.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Yeah, I died to self."
[53:36] Oh man, I had some lessons to learn.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; I'm still dying to self. Amen. That was
[53:41] kindergarten compared to where God
[53:43] starts dealing with us in our heart and
[53:45] our thoughts and our motives and why we
[53:47] said what we said and why we thought
[53:49] what we thought.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Brother B says this. Now always to find
[53:58] out something first is to find whether
[54:01] it's the will of God or not. And then if
[54:03] it's the will of God then your objective
[54:06] to do it and then your motive in doing
[54:09] it. If it's the will of God and your
[54:11] objective is right and your motive is
[54:13] right, it's got to happen. There's just
[54:14] no way to keep from happening. So, first
[54:16] find the will. If it's God's will, and
[54:19] his will is his word.
[54:22] What's your objective in doing it? If
[54:25] it's selfish, you'll never get it done.
[54:28] That's all. It's got to be real clean
[54:30] and clear before God or it just won't
[54:33] happen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; He starts to show us that there's a
[54:36] pattern. First of all, it's got to be
[54:38] the will of God. Secondly, what is our
[54:42] objective? What are we hoping to
[54:43] accomplish by this?
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; What is the end result? What's the
[54:47] objective that we're hoping to get to?
[54:49] What's the result of this action or this
[54:52] decision? And so, what matters is is it
[54:54] the will of God? And what's our
[54:56] objective? And then thirdly, what's our
[54:58] motive in doing it?
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; And if our motive in doing it has
[55:02] anything selfish in it, Amen. then our
[55:05] motive is wrong. And brother B said it's
[55:07] not going to work out.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; So this is really good way for us to
[55:11] begin to judge ourselves. First, is it
[55:13] the will of God? Is this according to
[55:15] the word of God? Secondly, what am I
[55:18] hoping to accomplish by this? What is
[55:19] the result that I'm looking for? Is it
[55:21] for God or is it for me? And then what's
[55:23] my motivation in doing it? Am I trying
[55:25] to get attention? Am I trying to look
[55:27] good? Am I trying to serve God?
[55:29] And when we can get those three things
[55:31] to line up, then we can move forward.
[55:34] We don't WE DON'T JUST STOP AS IT IS THE
[55:38] word of God,
[55:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Is it the word of God? Yes, it's the
[55:44] word OF GOD. BUT WHY do I want to do it?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; If I have a selfish motive and I have a
[55:51] self-serving purpose. Hey, listen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; When when when the Pharisees drop money
[55:57] in the treasury,
[55:59] is it the word of God to put money in
[56:01] the treasury?
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the word of God. But when
[56:06] when HE BLEW THE TRUMPET and walked over
[56:08] and he shook out his bag real slow to
[56:10] make sure it went clang clang clang bang
[56:12] bang bang.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; What was his motive in so much noise?
[56:18] His motive was wrong. HE HAD THE WORD OF
[56:20] GOD. HE HAD the wrong motive.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; So he WAS WRONG.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID HE WAS WRONG.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; But what he was doing was not wrong. YOU
[56:29] CAN'T SAY IT'S WRONG to give money. IT'S
[56:31] NOT WRONG TO GIVE MONEY TO THE TREASURY.
[56:33] IT'S NOT WRONG.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; What was wrong was his heart.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; His motive. So I go back and say again,
[56:40] the greatest temptation for a child of
[56:42] God is not to do something evil, but to
[56:44] do something good for the wrong reason
[56:47] &gt;&gt; or to do something right, but not
[56:49] according to the word. I want to keep
[56:51] working on that thought.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Let's turn with me to Numbers 22.
[57:04] We all know this story really well,
[57:07] the story of Balum. [snorts] But I
[57:09] wanted to take some time and read it
[57:10] together.
[57:13] Story of Balum in Numbers 22.
[57:17] And I'd like to begin in verse 7.
[57:21] The elders of Moab and the elders of
[57:23] Midian departed with the rewards of
[57:26] divination in their hand. And they came
[57:27] unto Balam, and spake unto him the words
[57:30] of Baal. And he said unto them, Launch
[57:32] here this night, and I will bring you
[57:34] word again, as the Lord shall speak unto
[57:36] me. And the princes of Moab abode with
[57:39] Balam. And God came unto Balam, and
[57:41] said, What men are these with thee? And
[57:44] Balam said unto God, Ba, Bao the son of
[57:47] Zipper, king of Moab, has sent unto me,
[57:50] saying, Behold, there is a people come
[57:52] out of Egypt, which coverth the face of
[57:54] the earth. Come now, curse me them. Per
[57:57] adventure I shall be able to overcome
[57:58] them and drive them out. And God said
[58:00] unto Balam, "Thou shalt not go with
[58:03] them. Thou shalt not curse the people,
[58:06] for they are blessed." And Bam rose up
[58:09] in the morning and said unto the princes
[58:10] of Ba, "Get you into your land, for the
[58:13] Lord refuses to give me leave to go with
[58:15] you." And the princes of Moab rose up,
[58:17] and they went into Baal and said, "Balam
[58:20] refuses to come with us." So far in the
[58:23] story, I say, "Good boy, Balum.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; You did right.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; You went and sought the Lord. They asked
[58:28] you to come and do something. You sought
[58:29] the Lord, and the Lord told you, don't
[58:31] curse the don't go with the men. Don't
[58:33] curse the people, for they are blessed."
[58:36] Now, let's look at verse 15.
[58:38] And Bale sent yet again princes more and
[58:42] more honorable than they. So, he sent
[58:45] people who are more prestigious.
[58:48] And they came to Balam, and said unto
[58:49] him, Thus sayeth Bale, the king of
[58:51] Zippor, let nothing I pray thee, hinder
[58:54] thee from coming unto me, for I will
[58:56] promote thee unto very great honor. I
[58:58] will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me.
[59:00] Come, therefore, I pray thee, curse me,
[59:03] this people. And Balam answered and said
[59:06] unto the servants of Bao, if uh if Bail
[59:09] would give me his house full of silver
[59:11] and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of
[59:13] the Lord, my God, to do less or more.
[59:16] Now therefore I pray you tarry you also
[59:18] here this night that I may know what the
[59:20] Lord will say unto me more. And God and
[59:23] God came unto Balam at night and said
[59:26] unto him, if the men come to call thee,
[59:28] rise up and go with them. But yet the
[59:31] word which I shall say unto thee, that
[59:33] shall thou do. And Bam rose up in the
[59:36] morning and saddled his ass, and went
[59:37] with the princess of Moab. So when we
[59:40] read this story, I've read this story
[59:42] before. When we read this story, we
[59:44] start to look at it and say, "Yeah,
[59:46] well, God told him to go." But that's
[59:48] not what brother Brennham told us.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham, when he come to this
[59:52] story, he began to tell us, and we'll
[59:53] find out more. We're going to read a
[59:55] little bit more. But when brother
[59:56] Brandham come, he says, "Balam had the
[59:58] first word of God. Why did he ever ask
[1:00:01] him again?"
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; There was a reason he asked again. Amen.
[1:00:05] God already said, "Don't go with the
[1:00:07] men.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Don't curse this people for they are
[1:00:10] blessed." That's the word of the Lord.
[1:00:13] Amen. And Balam was a a a genuine
[1:00:15] prophet. He was a prophet of God. Amen.
[1:00:17] And he knew that was the word of the
[1:00:18] Lord. Yet they went back and said,
[1:00:20] "Balam refused to come." So he sent back
[1:00:22] people who were more prestigious. And he
[1:00:24] gave him a promise of promoting him to
[1:00:26] honor and giving him all he had. And
[1:00:28] Balam makes a statement that's so funny
[1:00:31] to me.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; He says, "Listen, if Bailo would give me
[1:00:35] his house full of GOLD AND SILVER, I CAN
[1:00:37] ONLY say what the Lord says.
[1:00:40] You wait here and I'll go ask.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN GO ASK? HE ALREADY TOLD
[1:00:45] YOU. WHY WOULD YOU ASK A SECOND TIME?
[1:00:48] WHY WOULD YOU EVEN TRY? WHAT IS IT
[1:00:50] YOU'RE AFTER? IT'S THE PRESTIGIOUS, MORE
[1:00:53] honorable men with the promotion and the
[1:00:55] promise OF EVERYTHING. THAT'S WHY YOU
[1:00:57] WANT to know if God changed his mind
[1:00:58] about his WORD BECAUSE OF A PERSONAL
[1:01:00] GAIN.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:04] I mean, WHY IS IT YOU HAVE SOME PEOPLE
[1:01:06] THAT PRAY AND PRAY ABOUT THE WILL OF GOD
[1:01:08] OVER A MATTER THAT GOD HAS SO CLEARLY
[1:01:10] SPOKE OUT IN THE BIBLE AND GIVEN US
[1:01:12] THROUGH THE PROPHET OF THIS AGE WHEN HE
[1:01:13] TELLS US, "YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE TO MARRY,
[1:01:16] DON'T MARRY." AMEN. WHY GO PRAY ABOUT
[1:01:18] IT?
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS BALAM DOING PRAYING?
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; A SECOND TIME, HE ALREADY GOT THE WORD
[1:01:28] OF THE LORD.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Here's what he said. 2 Peter 2:15. This
[1:01:34] is what the Bible says of of Balum.
[1:01:36] Which have forsaken the right way and
[1:01:38] are gone astray, following the way of
[1:01:39] Balam, the son of Bozer, who loved the
[1:01:42] wages of unrighteousness.
[1:01:45] What was it Balam was after? He wanted
[1:01:48] the reward.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; That's why he went THE SECOND TIME. IT
[1:01:52] WASN'T A PURE MOTIVE TO FIND THE will of
[1:01:54] God. IT WAS TO FIND OUT IF GOD'S WILL
[1:01:57] WOULD BE CHANGED SO that he can have the
[1:01:59] wages of unrighteousness.
[1:02:02] In Jude 1 it says, "Woe unto them, for
[1:02:05] they have gone in the way of Cain and
[1:02:07] ran greedily after the heir of Balum for
[1:02:10] reward and perished in the gains of
[1:02:12] core." So what did Balum want? He wanted
[1:02:15] reward. Why did he ask him a second
[1:02:17] time? Because of the lust of the flesh,
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE PRIDE OF LIFE. He went
[1:02:23] the second time to see if maybe God
[1:02:26] would change HIS MIND. IF HE ALREADY
[1:02:28] KNEW THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE BLESSED, WHY
[1:02:30] DOES HE WANT TO CURSE THEM?
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Because of personal gain,
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; let's continue on. Verse 22.
[1:02:41] And God's anger was kindled because he
[1:02:44] went. Wait a second. Stop.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to verse 19. Now
[1:02:52] therefore, I pray you tar you also here
[1:02:54] this night, that I may know what the
[1:02:56] Lord will say unto me more. And God came
[1:02:59] unto Balam at night, and said unto him,
[1:03:01] If the men come to call thee, arise up,
[1:03:04] and go with them, but yet the word which
[1:03:06] I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou
[1:03:09] do.
[1:03:11] Did God say go?
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; God said, if the men come to call thee,
[1:03:17] rise up and go with them.
[1:03:20] Yeah.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Rise up and go with them.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Verse 21. And Balam rose up in the
[1:03:27] morning and saddled his. It looks like
[1:03:29] he did exactly what God said.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Verse 22. And God's anger was kindled
[1:03:33] because he went.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Do you get it?
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; God's will.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; God's perfect will was his first word.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; What he first told him was the word of
[1:03:46] the Lord and it was perfect. Why was
[1:03:48] Balam asking a second time? Because
[1:03:51] Balam loved the wages of
[1:03:53] unrighteousness. And Balam was greedy
[1:03:55] for reward.
[1:03:57] That's why he went back. So it was Balam
[1:04:00] who now wanted to go against the word of
[1:04:03] God and he wanted to curse Israel.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Why did he ask a second? Why did he want
[1:04:12] to curse Israel? He didn't care about
[1:04:13] Israel. He wanted the reward. Yeah.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; But God says, "Don't curse them. They
[1:04:19] are blessed."
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Now, he wants to curse a people God's
[1:04:24] called blessed because of the reward.
[1:04:26] This is all about Balam. But Balam being
[1:04:29] a genuine prophet, Balam can't go
[1:04:31] against the word of the Lord. So, he
[1:04:33] comes back because he has a desire in
[1:04:34] his heart to go and curse THEM. HE ASKED
[1:04:36] GOD, "GOD, CAN I GO AND CURSE HIM?" And
[1:04:38] God says, "When the men come to you,
[1:04:40] rise up and go with them."
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:45] rest his will.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; RISE UP AND GO WITH THEM. So he goes
[1:04:48] with him and the anger and the anger of
[1:04:51] the Lord was kindled against HIM BECAUSE
[1:04:52] HE WENT. HE SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE
[1:04:54] FIRST WORD. LISTEN, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
[1:04:57] YOU CAN PRAY YOURSELF in a fervor
[1:04:58] against the word of God. AND IF GOD EVER
[1:05:00] SAYS, "OKAY, GO." I WOULD COME BACK TO
[1:05:02] THE WORD, FRIENDS.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; I WOULD STICK WITH WHAT gave us and what
[1:05:06] God gave us through his prophets.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:11] So, so now let's go back to verse 22.
[1:05:15] And God's anger was kindled because he
[1:05:17] went and the angel of the Lord stood in
[1:05:19] the way for an adversary against him.
[1:05:21] Now, he was riding upon his ass and his
[1:05:23] two servants were with him. And the
[1:05:25] story unfolds. He begins to beat the
[1:05:27] ass, and he speaks back to him. But
[1:05:29] let's drop down to verse uh 32.
[1:05:32] And the angel of the Lord said unto him,
[1:05:34] "Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass
[1:05:37] these three times? Behold, I went out to
[1:05:40] withstand thee, because thy way is
[1:05:42] perverse before me. And the ass saw me
[1:05:46] and turned from me these three times,
[1:05:48] unless she had turned from me. Surely
[1:05:50] now also I had slain thee, and saved her
[1:05:53] alive. And Balam said unto the angel of
[1:05:56] the Lord, I have sinned, for I know, I
[1:05:58] knew not that thou stoodest in the way
[1:06:00] against me. Now therefore, if it
[1:06:01] displeased thee, I will get me back
[1:06:03] again. And the angel of the Lord said
[1:06:04] unto Balam, "Go with the men, but only
[1:06:06] the word that I shall speak unto thee
[1:06:08] that thou shalt speak." So Balam went
[1:06:10] with the princes of Baal. Listen, Bailo
[1:06:15] didn't want to openly defy the word of
[1:06:17] God.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Balam wasn't that kind of person. He
[1:06:20] wasn't that kind of person to just
[1:06:22] absolutely rebel against the word of the
[1:06:24] God. He needed permission from God to
[1:06:26] go. So God gave him the thing he wanted.
[1:06:28] And that wasn't his perfect will. His
[1:06:30] perfect will is what he said first. This
[1:06:32] was his permissive will. But the
[1:06:33] permissive will was perverse unto the
[1:06:35] angel of the Lord.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, I DON'T THINK THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:06:40] CHRIST IS LOOKING FOR permissive will. I
[1:06:42] don't think that love that we have for
[1:06:43] him wants us to WALK IN THE I DON'T WANT
[1:06:45] THE PERMISSIVE WILL. I want his perfect
[1:06:46] will. I WANT TO WALK IN HIS PERFECT
[1:06:48] WILL. AND I'M NOT ALWAYS DONE IT RIGHT.
[1:06:50] AND I'VE NOT ALWAYS GOT IT RIGHT, BUT
[1:06:52] THAT'S WHAT I WANT. I SAID, GOD, HELP ME
[1:06:54] TO WALK IN YOUR PERFECT WILL OF YOUR
[1:06:55] WORD.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; AND LET ME DIE TO MYSELF. IF MYSELF WANT
[1:07:01] SOMETHING DIFFERENT, LET ME DIE TO SELF.
[1:07:02] AND KEEP with the word.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; I read this scripture Sunday, but I want
[1:07:09] to go through it again. It's so
[1:07:10] powerful. For the word of God is quick
[1:07:14] and powerful and sharper than any
[1:07:16] two-edged sword, piercing even to the
[1:07:18] dividing aunderder of soul and spirit,
[1:07:20] and of the joints and the marorrow, and
[1:07:22] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:07:23] intents of the heart. That's what
[1:07:25] happened to Balam. BALAM'S SOUL, HIS
[1:07:28] HEART was discerned.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; YEAH. BECAUSE GOD ALREADY gave him the
[1:07:32] word. The word was a discerner of his
[1:07:34] thought and intent. Because when he came
[1:07:36] back and ASKED AGAIN, IT SHOWED what he
[1:07:38] wanted. He wanted his way more than
[1:07:40] God's way.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; He gave lip service to obedience to God.
[1:07:44] But what he really wanted, he wanted God
[1:07:46] to give him permission to go and CURSE
[1:07:47] THESE PEOPLE THAT GOD CALLED BLESSED.
[1:07:49] WHAT IN HIM WANTS HIM TO DO THAT? He was
[1:07:52] greedy for gain.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; It was for himself. If he TRULY LOVED
[1:07:57] GOD, AMEN. HE WOULD WANT WHAT GOD
[1:07:58] WANTED. And if God wanted these people
[1:08:00] blessed, he would say, "That's enough
[1:08:02] for me. No reward is worth it."
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; I want to pull up an example in the
[1:08:08] Bible. And brother Bam talks about this,
[1:08:10] and it it's such an easy example. He
[1:08:13] said in 1 Timothy 2:11, "Let the women
[1:08:16] learn in silence with all subjection.
[1:08:18] But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor
[1:08:20] to ser authority over the man, but to be
[1:08:22] in silence. For Adam was first formed,
[1:08:25] then Eve, and Adam was not deceived, but
[1:08:27] the woman being deceived was in the
[1:08:28] transgression.
[1:08:30] So the woman is to learn in silence in
[1:08:32] all subjection, and not to teach or to
[1:08:35] ser authority over the man. God did not
[1:08:37] call women to preach the gospel.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Women preachers are not allowed
[1:08:42] according to the scripture.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; And this is what brother Benham said in
[1:08:46] choosing of a Brian. I know, sister,
[1:08:48] many of you say, "The Lord called me to
[1:08:50] preach." I'm not going to argue with
[1:08:53] you, but I'm going to tell you the word
[1:08:55] says you're not to do it. She shall not
[1:08:58] teach her super authority, but to be in
[1:09:00] silence. Well, you say, "The Lord told
[1:09:02] me to do it." I don't doubt that one
[1:09:06] bit.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Did you read that?
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Did you hear my message the other night
[1:09:12] about Balum?
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Balam got the first straight cut
[1:09:18] decision of God. Don't do it. But he
[1:09:21] kept on fooling around till finally God
[1:09:23] told him to go do it. God might permit
[1:09:25] you to preach. I don't say he didn't,
[1:09:28] but it's not according to his original
[1:09:30] word and plan. For she is to be under
[1:09:32] obedience as also sayeth the law. It's
[1:09:35] true. Therefore, she's not supposed to
[1:09:37] do it.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Listen, a woman may have said to brother
[1:09:43] Benham, "The Lord called me to preach."
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I don't doubt that one
[1:09:49] bit.
[1:09:52] What a temptation.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; I ask you this. The great commission was
[1:09:57] go into all the world and preach the
[1:09:59] gospel.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; IS IT WRONG TO PREACH?
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; What if this woman preacher could say,
[1:10:07] "BUT I'VE GOT RESULTS. PEOPLE GAVE THEIR
[1:10:09] HEART TO THE LORD. THEY'VE been
[1:10:10] converted."
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Well, that's fine. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
[1:10:14] WITH THAT. If they believe the word,
[1:10:15] they believe the word. It's fine. BUT
[1:10:17] GETTING RESULTS DOESN'T CHANGE THE WILL
[1:10:19] OF GOD.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOOD RESULTS
[1:10:23] DOESN'T MEAN IT'S RIGHT. AND GOING
[1:10:25] THROUGH THE PERMISSIVE WILL OF GOD, YOU
[1:10:26] CAN SAY, "WELL, I'VE GOT GOOD RESULTS."
[1:10:28] BUT IF YOU'RE OFF THE WORD, YOU'RE OFF
[1:10:30] [screaming] THE WORD.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; BUT I GOT GOOD RESULTS. LISTEN, THAT
[1:10:36] DOESN'T LISTEN. PREACHING THE GOSPEL IS
[1:10:38] RIGHT. SPEAKING THE TRUTH IS RIGHT.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; But a woman preaching is wrong.
[1:10:46] SO THE SECOND PART OF MY DEFINITION I
[1:10:48] gave you is to do SOMETHING RIGHT BUT
[1:10:50] NOT ACCORDING to the word. Is it right
[1:10:53] to preach? It's right to preach. Is it
[1:10:55] WRONG TO DECLARE THE TRUTH? IT'S NOT
[1:10:57] WRONG TO DECLARE THE TRUTH. THAT'S
[1:10:58] RIGHT. BUT DOING IT BUT A WOMAN DOING IT
[1:11:01] IS NOT ACCORDING TO THE WORD.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; And brother Brenham said listen. You say
[1:11:06] the Lord called me TO PREACH. HE SAID
[1:11:08] I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE with you.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; LISTEN. BALAM COULD SAY GOD TOLD ME TO
[1:11:14] GO WITH THEM. I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE
[1:11:15] WITH YOU, BAUM.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD TOLD ME TO GET UP AND GO WITH
[1:11:20] THEM. LISTEN, I DON'T DOUBT THAT ONE
[1:11:22] BIT, BAUM.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; YEAH. RIGHT.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT ACCORDING TO HIS original
[1:11:28] word.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THROUGH THE CHURCH AGES, THAT
[1:11:31] THING MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONFUSED AND MIGHT
[1:11:32] HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AND IT MIGHT HAVE
[1:11:34] HAPPENED. AMEN. BUT PRAISE GOD, THERE'S
[1:11:36] BEEN A PROPHET WHO BROUGHT US BACK TO
[1:11:38] THE ORIGINAL teaching of the
[1:11:39] forefathers. And we know by the word
[1:11:41] that that's not right.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why in brother Brandon's
[1:11:46] ministry, there was many women who laid
[1:11:48] down the ministry. They came to the
[1:11:49] message and they GAVE IT UP. AND GOD
[1:11:51] HONORED AND BLESSED them for that.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham respected him
[1:11:57] very much for that. But I I just use
[1:11:59] this example because it's SO IT'S SUCH
[1:12:01] AN OBVIOUS and clear-cut example. Amen.
[1:12:04] That you're doing the right thing,
[1:12:06] fulfilling the great commission, but
[1:12:07] you're not doing it according to the
[1:12:09] word.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "If you love me, keep
[1:12:14] my commandments."
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Bam could claim to love the Lord. But
[1:12:20] but that love got confused with himself.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians 14, it says, "If any
[1:12:29] man think himself to be a prophet or
[1:12:31] spiritual, let him acknowledge that the
[1:12:33] things that I write unto you are the
[1:12:34] commandments of the Lord." So if you
[1:12:37] love me, keep my commandments. Well, I
[1:12:38] do what Jesus says. Well, Paul says,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; "Amen. What I tell you is the
[1:12:42] commandments of the Lord.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing. Amen. And if you
[1:12:46] love me, keep my commandments.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says this in the church age.
[1:12:52] It is most worthy of note that that the
[1:12:54] very name Thoty means dominating female.
[1:12:57] Thus, this age is characterized by a
[1:13:00] dominating force, a force that
[1:13:01] ruthlessly invades all, conquers all,
[1:13:04] despotically controls. Now, a dominating
[1:13:06] female is the greatest curse in the
[1:13:08] world.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians says, "But I would have
[1:13:14] you know that the head of every man is
[1:13:16] Christ, and the head of the woman is
[1:13:18] man, and the head of Christ is God."
[1:13:21] Listen, there's so much more at stake
[1:13:24] with a a woman preacher.
[1:13:26] Amen. It's not just that the Bible says
[1:13:29] she's not to preach. There's a reason
[1:13:31] the Bible says she's not to preach
[1:13:32] because it goes all the way back to the
[1:13:33] fall in the Garden of Eden. she's not to
[1:13:35] handle the word and and and
[1:13:38] a dominating female spirit is the
[1:13:40] greatest curse in the world and it's
[1:13:42] we're going to read next and it's the
[1:13:43] seeds of the Catholic Church. So
[1:13:45] although a woman may have a burden to
[1:13:47] get the word out, she may see that
[1:13:48] there's men not around doing it and she
[1:13:50] wants to proclaim the gospel and
[1:13:51] proclaiming the GOSPEL IS RIGHT, BUT
[1:13:53] IT'S NOT ACCORDING to the word. And when
[1:13:55] she takes the authority of sewing seed,
[1:13:58] giving seed is from man to woman, from
[1:14:00] male to female.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; She perverts THE WHOLE PLAN OF GOD. SHE
[1:14:05] PERVERTS THE WHOLE IMAGE.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALTHOUGH IT'S GOOD TO TO PROCLAIM
[1:14:10] THE TRUTH. SO IT'S GOOD TO PREACH THE
[1:14:12] GOSPEL. WHEN A WOMAN STANDS AND STARTS
[1:14:14] DISPENSATING THE SEED OF GOD, SHE MESSES
[1:14:16] the whole picture up BECAUSE SEED AND
[1:14:19] REDEMPTION HAS TO GO FROM MALE to
[1:14:20] female.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FROM CHRIST TO THE CHURCH, NOT
[1:14:24] FROM THE CHURCH TO THE CHURCH. THEN
[1:14:26] THERE'S NO REDEMPTION. THERE'S NO SEED
[1:14:28] FROM WOMAN TO WOMAN. IT MESSES THE WHOLE
[1:14:30] PICTURE UP. BUT THE SEED OF REDEMPTION
[1:14:32] COMES FROM MAN TO WOMAN. SO GOD USES MEN
[1:14:34] TO PREACH THE GOSPEL.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE MEN ARE SMARTER, NOT BECAUSE
[1:14:39] MEN OF GREATER COMPASSION, NOT BECAUSE
[1:14:40] MEN ARE MORE LEARNED, NOT BECAUSE MEN,
[1:14:43] IT'S NOT BECAUSE MEN ARE BETTER. IT'S
[1:14:45] BECAUSE THE WHOLE PICTURE GETS RUINED
[1:14:47] WHEN we flip it upside down. Yeah.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T GO TO REASONING.
[1:14:52] AND AND IN THE METHODIST DAY, THEY went
[1:14:54] to reasoning. The reasoning IS IF WE'VE
[1:14:56] GOT WOMEN JUST AS EDUCATED as men.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; THEY UNDERSTAND THE WORD. THEY'VE BEEN
[1:15:02] TAUGHT LIKE THE MEN HAVE BEEN TAUGHT.
[1:15:03] AMEN. SO, THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH. They
[1:15:05] can read JUST AS MUCH AND THEY HAVE JUST
[1:15:07] AS much consecration, ZEAL, AND PASSION
[1:15:09] AS THE MEN HAVE. THAT'S ALL TRUE. BUT
[1:15:11] WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE REASONING.
[1:15:13] And then they said, "IF WE ALLOW WOMEN
[1:15:14] TO PREACH, THEN WE DOUBLE OUR EFFORTS."
[1:15:16] NOW, IT'S NOT JUST MEN, IT'S WOMEN. AND
[1:15:18] WE SPREAD THE GOSPEL FASTER. THAT WAS
[1:15:20] ALL REASONING, FRIENDS.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; And the REASONING SOUNDED GOOD, BUT IT
[1:15:26] WAS NOT ACCORDING TO THE WORD.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And I don't even think the motive was
[1:15:33] wrong.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; I don't EVEN THINK THE OBJECTIVE WAS
[1:15:36] WRONG.
[1:15:40] THE RIGHT OBJECTIVE, THE RIGHT MOTIVE,
[1:15:44] but not according to the will of God
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; because it wasn't according to the word.
[1:15:52] This is why a woman can't take the
[1:15:55] dominant position in her family.
[1:15:58] She doesn't stay under the headship of
[1:15:59] her husband. Listen, she can say, "But
[1:16:02] you don't know my husband, but my
[1:16:03] husband's this and my husband's that."
[1:16:05] It doesn't matter what your husband is.
[1:16:06] Order you before God. Stay in your lane.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Stay in your position.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you have mom, she wants to
[1:16:14] dominate dad and dad, sit down. We're
[1:16:16] going to do family devotion. Now, I know
[1:16:17] you're not going to do it. I'm going to
[1:16:18] do it. You're ruining the picture for
[1:16:20] your kids.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE DESTROYING THE WHOLE IMAGE. AMEN.
[1:16:24] IT'S BETTER to leave it undone than to
[1:16:26] dominate a man.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:36] and and the Thitron church ages continue
[1:16:38] on from what we just read. Now a woman
[1:16:40] is not meant to have an iron
[1:16:41] disposition. She is according to the
[1:16:43] holy scriptures to be submissive to the
[1:16:45] male. That is commanded of her. Woman
[1:16:48] who is truly female all female will be
[1:16:50] of that disposition. Not a doormat. No
[1:16:53] real male makes a female a doormat. But
[1:16:55] she will want to be under authority and
[1:16:58] not rule over the male. She will want to
[1:17:01] be under
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; authority
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; and not rule over the male for he is the
[1:17:06] head of the house. If she breaks that
[1:17:08] image that God made for her, she is
[1:17:10] perverted.
[1:17:12] Any male that lets a woman take
[1:17:14] authority has also broken that image and
[1:17:16] he is perverted.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; So to say, well, you do it, you're
[1:17:20] better than I am.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; No, no, no.
[1:17:26] That is why a woman cannot wear that
[1:17:28] which pertainth to a man or cut her
[1:17:30] hair. She is never to wear garments that
[1:17:32] pertain to a male or cut her hair. When
[1:17:35] she does, she is intruding into the male
[1:17:37] domain, taking authority and perverting
[1:17:39] herself. And when a woman invades the
[1:17:42] pullpit, which is commanded she must not
[1:17:44] do, she shows what spirit she is of.
[1:17:47] being a dominating female is antichrist
[1:17:50] and the seeds of the Roman Catholic
[1:17:51] Church are in her though she may deny
[1:17:54] this ever so vehemently but when it
[1:17:56] comes to the word let God be true in
[1:17:58] every man's word a lie amen
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; amen preaching amen is to be in
[1:18:05] submission to the head LISTEN THAT'S NOT
[1:18:07] OLDFASHIONED PREACHING that's the Bible
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; when preaching that a man is the head of
[1:18:11] the woman and Christ is the HEAD OF THE
[1:18:13] CHURCH AMEN THAT'S NOT OLD-FASHIONED
[1:18:15] PREACHING I DON'T CARE IF WE LIVE IN
[1:18:17] Leodysia and if we live in the middle of
[1:18:19] a female dominating society and we live
[1:18:21] in the middle of A FEMINIST MOVEMENT,
[1:18:23] THAT FEMINIST IDEA SHOULD NOT BE
[1:18:25] CREEPING INTO THE CHURCH
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; because we've GOT THE WORD OF GOD. WE'VE
[1:18:30] GOT THUS SAYETH THE LORD ON IT. AND IT
[1:18:32] DOESN'T MATTER. YOU SAY, "WELL, my
[1:18:32] husband's a failure." LET HIM BE A
[1:18:34] FAILURE, BUT don't you fail because he
[1:18:36] failed.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; We have to stay in our position and stay
[1:18:43] what God called us to be.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll take one more. These are just
[1:18:48] examples and we can apply this so many
[1:18:50] different ways. There is no minister
[1:18:52] that can marry a widow.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Did you know that? You want to read
[1:18:55] that? All right. You get in Leviticus
[1:18:57] 21:7, Ezekiel 44:22. We'll read those in
[1:19:00] just a moment. And I'll show you that
[1:19:02] the priesthood was not to marry a woman
[1:19:04] that's been touched by man. This is type
[1:19:06] is of the virgin bride of Jesus Christ
[1:19:08] because they handle the fire of God. The
[1:19:10] priesthood, Aaron's sons. We haven't got
[1:19:12] time to read it all. We get out by noon.
[1:19:15] We got 20 minutes yet. And them as
[1:19:17] Aaron's sons that handle the fire of
[1:19:19] God. So they could not marry a woman
[1:19:22] that had been touched by another man.
[1:19:24] The unchanging God said so.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; They could not marry another woman and a
[1:19:29] woman been touched by a man. Showing in
[1:19:32] type here, if you want to see it, that
[1:19:34] the church of the living God is purely
[1:19:36] unadulterated the word of God and not a
[1:19:38] denomination that's been handled by man.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; So there's a reason God wants the image
[1:19:43] to stay true. And every minister must
[1:19:46] marry a virgin.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Leviticus 2:17 says, "They shall not
[1:19:51] take a wife that is a or profane,
[1:19:53] neither shall they take a woman put away
[1:19:55] from her husband, for he is holy unto
[1:19:57] his God. Thou shalt sanctify him
[1:19:59] therefore, for he offerth the bread of
[1:20:01] the of thy God. He shall be holy unto
[1:20:03] thee, for I, the Lord, which sanctify
[1:20:06] you, am holy." Speaking of the office of
[1:20:08] priest. Now in Ezekiel 44:21 it says,
[1:20:11] "Neither shall any priest drink wine
[1:20:13] when they enter to the inner court,
[1:20:14] neither shall they take for their wives
[1:20:16] a widow, nor her that or nor her that is
[1:20:18] put away, but they shall take a maidens
[1:20:20] of the seed as virgins of the seed of
[1:20:22] the house of Israel or a widow that had
[1:20:25] a priest before."
[1:20:27] Amen. So, Brother Brandham comes along
[1:20:29] and he tells us, listen, and he refers
[1:20:32] back to the Old Testament. He shows us
[1:20:34] no minister, Amen, no minister can marry
[1:20:38] a woman that's not a virgin. She he must
[1:20:40] have a virgin for a wife to type the
[1:20:42] virgin bride to Christ because he has to
[1:20:44] handle the fire of God. Amen. But we've
[1:20:47] got people who will push that to the
[1:20:49] side and say that doesn't matter.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I've had I've heard people
[1:20:54] say, "Brother Brandon only said that one
[1:20:56] time and you don't find it in the New
[1:20:57] Testament."
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; My goodness, BROTHER BRANDON ONLY SAID
[1:21:01] IT ONE TIME. You don't find in THE DO DO
[1:21:03] WE BELIEVE WE GOT A PROPHET OF GOD OR DO
[1:21:04] WE NOT HAVE A PROPHET OF GOD? AND IF YOU
[1:21:06] SAY WE HAVE A PROPHET OF GOD, DO YOU NOT
[1:21:08] KNOW WHAT A PROPHET OF GOD IS?
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; LOOK through the LOOK THROUGH THE BIBLE
[1:21:11] AND FIND OUT WHAT A PROPHET IS. AMEN. A
[1:21:14] PROPHET IS NOT A SUPER EXTRA-GIFTED
[1:21:16] PREACHER. A PROPHET IS SOMETHING
[1:21:17] COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. HE BRINGS YOU THE
[1:21:19] WORD OF GOD.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; He handles the word of God. He is THE
[1:21:23] MOUTHPIECE OF GOD. HE IS THE VOICE OF
[1:21:25] GOD ON EARTH. AND I DON'T CARE IF HE
[1:21:26] ONLY SAID IT ONE TIME. HE TOOK YOU RIGHT
[1:21:28] TO THE SCRIPTURES TO BACK UP WHAT HE
[1:21:30] SAID.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; And to REJECT THAT FOR WHATEVER
[1:21:34] REASONING YOU WANT TO REJECT IT to me is
[1:21:36] foolish.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; I DEALT WITH THIS OVERSEAS BEFORE. I
[1:21:40] WENT TO A PLACE OVERSEAS AND THEY WERE
[1:21:42] TELLING ME THIS WAS GOING ON IN the
[1:21:43] church and the church was splitting.
[1:21:45] Amen. Because there was ministers
[1:21:46] sitting there who wanted to preach
[1:21:50] but they were NOT MARRIED TO VIRGINS.
[1:21:51] AND THEY SAID, "WELL, IT HAPPENED BEFORE
[1:21:54] WE were converted." Brother Brenham
[1:21:56] DIDN'T SAY WHETHER BEFORE or after YOU
[1:21:57] WERE CONVERTED. BROTHER BRENHAM SAID,
[1:21:59] "IF GOD CALLS A MAN, HE CALLS HIS WIFE,
[1:22:01] TOO."
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD WANTED YOU TO PREACH THIS
[1:22:04] MESSAGE, HE WOULD HAVE PRESERVED YOUR
[1:22:06] SPOUSE. GOD CAN WORK EVERYTHING OUT.
[1:22:08] DON'T YOU THINK GOD COULD HAVE WATCHED
[1:22:09] OVER YOU AND WATCHED OVER HER AND
[1:22:11] BROUGHT YOU TOGETHER TO PREACH THIS
[1:22:12] GOSPEL CLEAN and pure?
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU UPHOLD something you deny?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And when I was
[1:22:21] dealing with this OVER THERE, AMEN. THE
[1:22:23] STATEMENT WAS, "But I have a gift and
[1:22:25] the people need it.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; BUT THE GIFTS AND CALLINGS OF GOD ARE
[1:22:30] WITHOUT REPENTANCE." I YOU SAY, "I HAVE
[1:22:32] A GIFT." I DON'T DOUBT THAT ONE BIT.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to ARGUE WITH YOU. YOU
[1:22:37] HAVE A GIFT. YOU MAY BE GOOD. MY MY ONE
[1:22:40] TIME I HAD SOMEBODY IN MY FAMILY, THEY
[1:22:41] HANDED ME A CASSETTE TAPE of a woman
[1:22:43] preacher. She said, "Please listen to
[1:22:45] this." This is when we first come to the
[1:22:46] message and they were trying to persuade
[1:22:47] me otherwise. I played it. This was
[1:22:50] after I started preaching. I'd just been
[1:22:51] called to preach. I was nervous behind
[1:22:54] the pulpit. I was insecure. I was, you
[1:22:56] know, all those things. [laughter] I
[1:22:59] listened to this woman preach and she
[1:23:00] was marvelous.
[1:23:02] And I got back to the family and said,
[1:23:04] "What do you think?" I said, "She's
[1:23:05] good. She's far better than I am, but
[1:23:09] she's got no right behind the pull pit
[1:23:11] because the word of God says
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT ABILITY. IT'S NOT ABOUT
[1:23:15] EFFECT." YOU CAN'T SAY, "WELL, I'VE GOT
[1:23:17] A GIFT AND THEY NEED ME AND IT'S
[1:23:19] EFFECTIVE." WHAT DID GOD SAY?
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; AS IF GOD CAN'T MAKE IT WITHOUT YOU AND
[1:23:24] WITHOUT YOUR GIFT AND GOD NEEDS YOU.
[1:23:26] LISTEN, GOD CAN RAISE UP STONES.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; HE CAN RAISE UP CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM OUT
[1:23:32] OF STONES. DON'T YOU THINK THAT GOD
[1:23:34] NEEDS YOU
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; because you're a good orator? Because
[1:23:37] you have a clear mind and you can PUT
[1:23:39] TOGETHER A THOUGHT. YOU MAY HAVE A GIFT,
[1:23:41] BUT THAT DOESN'T mean you're called to
[1:23:42] it.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, we have nobody ELSE TO
[1:23:46] DO IT." I'D RATHER GO WITH NOBODY ELSE
[1:23:48] THAN TO GO CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [clears throat] WHY DO WE DO THIS?
[1:23:55] BECAUSE OF REASONINGS. WHAT WAS THE
[1:23:57] TEMPTATION? THE TEMPTATION WAS NOT TO BE
[1:23:59] EVIL. THE TEMPTATION, AMEN, WAS TO DO
[1:24:02] SOMETHING GOOD, BUT NOT ACCORDING TO THE
[1:24:04] WORD.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO PREACH THE MESSAGE. AMEN. AND
[1:24:08] I'VE GOT A GIFT AND THE PEOPLE NEED ME.
[1:24:10] THAT'S THE PRIDE OF LIFE, FRIENDS.
[1:24:13] YES,
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; I say God help us to stick with the
[1:24:17] word.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; I took two examples, BUT WE CAN APPLY
[1:24:21] THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE THING that
[1:24:23] brother Brandham taught us about, HE
[1:24:24] TAUGHT US ABOUT INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE. HE
[1:24:26] TAUGHT US ABOUT ELIGIBILITY TO MARRIAGE.
[1:24:28] HE TAUGHT US ABOUT QUALIFICATIONS FOR
[1:24:30] MINISTRY. HE TALKED ABOUT ALL KINDS OF
[1:24:32] THINGS. AND THE QUESTION IS, IS HE A
[1:24:34] PROPHET OF GOD? DID HE BRING US BACK TO
[1:24:35] THIS WORD? IS IT THE WILL AND WORD OF
[1:24:37] GOD, OR ARE WE GOING TO reason it away?
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we going to go down the line
[1:24:42] of every other denomination who takes
[1:24:44] their reasoning? ARE WE GOING TO STICK
[1:24:45] WITH THE WORD that's been restored to
[1:24:47] us?
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; I say, God, let's stick with the word.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben says this. He said, "An old
[1:24:54] minister used to sing, we let down the
[1:24:56] bars, we compromised with sin. We let
[1:24:59] down the bars, the sheep got out. But
[1:25:01] how did the goats get in?" He said, "You
[1:25:04] let down the bars, got away from the
[1:25:05] word." When Eve let down the bars to
[1:25:08] intellectual reasonings of Satan, death
[1:25:10] came in.
[1:25:11] And the bars that God had her bargain
[1:25:13] with with was his word of promise. And
[1:25:16] we have substituted something else, a
[1:25:17] creed instead of the word.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Say, God, let me stick with the word.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; If I've got to give up every idea I've
[1:25:27] ever had,
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; help me to give it up
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; for the word.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:34] 1 John 5 says, "By this we know that we
[1:25:36] love the children of God when we love
[1:25:38] God and keep his commandments. For this
[1:25:41] is the love of God that we keep his
[1:25:42] commandments, and his commandments are
[1:25:44] not grievious. For whatsoever is born of
[1:25:47] God overcometh the world, and this is
[1:25:49] the victory that overcomemeth the world,
[1:25:51] even our faith."
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Faith in what?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Word.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; The word.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Faith, not just our faith. And it's my
[1:26:00] faith. My faith. Everybody talks about
[1:26:02] their faith. Faith, faith is believing
[1:26:05] in something.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; People can say, "Well, my faith and my
[1:26:09] faith and you you can have 10 people
[1:26:11] talk about their faith and they can be
[1:26:12] referring to 10 different things."
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; But what is the victory that overcome
[1:26:17] the world? Even our faith? What kind of
[1:26:19] faith? Faith in what? Faith is a
[1:26:22] revelation from God. God has revealed
[1:26:24] something to you and you believe it.
[1:26:26] What has God revealed to us that
[1:26:27] believe? God has revealed to us the
[1:26:29] truth of his word. Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; We've got the We got the uh uh We've got
[1:26:34] the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:26:36] with divine vindication.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. DO WE HAVE THE PERFECT
[1:26:42] INTERPRETATION OF THE WORD WITH DIVINE
[1:26:43] VINDICATION? AMEN. THEN STOP PUSHING IT
[1:26:46] OFF TO THE SIDE AND SAYING, "HE ONLY
[1:26:48] SAID THAT ONE TIME."
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Let's believe the word.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Let's surrender to it. And this is the
[1:26:57] victory that overcomes the world, even
[1:26:59] our faith. and we keep his commandments
[1:27:01] and his commandments are not grievious.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; There's something in us that once we
[1:27:06] find OUT WHAT GOD WANTS, AMEN. There's
[1:27:08] something that changes inside of us at a
[1:27:10] new birth when we FIND OUT THIS IS THE
[1:27:12] WAY. WALK YOU IN IT. WE SAY, "PRAISE
[1:27:14] GOD, THAT'S THE WAY I WANT TO GO. OH
[1:27:16] GOD, HELP ME TO WALK THIS WAY.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; TAKE EVERY OTHER DESIRE OUT OF ME SO
[1:27:20] THAT I ONLY WANT THIS and what you've
[1:27:22] told me and what you've showed me."
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:27] We read this Sunday, but I'll read it
[1:27:29] again as we finish. We find now this
[1:27:31] evil age is to prove to Satan she is not
[1:27:34] like Eve.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; That she is not that type of woman.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; She will be tried by the word, his word,
[1:27:41] the bride as Adam's bride was tried by
[1:27:43] the word. And Adam's bride believed
[1:27:45] every bit of the word. All but confused
[1:27:47] on one promise that he's the same
[1:27:49] yesterday, today, and forever today.
[1:27:51] See, but failed on one promise under the
[1:27:53] temptation of the enemy face to face.
[1:27:55] And now the people that's called for his
[1:27:57] name of course is his bride. She is to
[1:27:59] come in contact again by the same thing.
[1:28:02] Not by just denominational truth orism
[1:28:04] but every word.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; This bride in the end time is going to
[1:28:08] be tried by every word. And is she going
[1:28:11] to take reasoning or some excuse or some
[1:28:13] permissive will or is she going to stay
[1:28:15] with the word?
[1:28:18] The temptation is to somehow deviate
[1:28:22] from the word.
[1:28:24] Amen. Not for evil but for seemingly
[1:28:27] good.
[1:28:29] But God wants us to stay with the word.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; This bride is not going to become like
[1:28:34] the denominations. They become a
[1:28:36] dominating female.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Sh. They became the masters of the word
[1:28:40] and they begin to massage and manipulate
[1:28:43] and they begin to flex the word to make
[1:28:45] it for more comfortable for the people.
[1:28:47] That's
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; That's what every denomin those of us
[1:28:50] who've come out of denominations, we can
[1:28:51] say amen.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:53] They take the word of God and they twist
[1:28:55] it and manipulate it and they mold it
[1:28:58] around the common culture of the people
[1:29:01] so it's easier for the common culture to
[1:29:03] still be called Christians.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; But I do not WANT THE WORD TO FLEX for
[1:29:10] me. I WANT TO FLEX FOR THE WORD.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; AND IF IT TWISTS ME AND FOLDS ME IN HALF
[1:29:15] AND PUTS ME IN UNCOMFORTABLE PLACES TO
[1:29:17] THE FLESH, I SAY, "SO BE IT, GOD. BREAK
[1:29:20] THIS MAN AND MOLD ME back in your image.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Don't want to flex this message to make
[1:29:27] it easier for a new generation.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; I don't want to let DOWN THE BARS ON
[1:29:32] FASHION and clothing and music and
[1:29:34] entertainment so that we can keep our
[1:29:36] young people. If our young people have a
[1:29:38] seed gene of God, it is this pure word
[1:29:40] that'll bring them to life. We don't
[1:29:42] need to entertain them that we don't
[1:29:43] need to make it easy for them so that
[1:29:45] they can easily slip in and still have a
[1:29:47] taste of the world and still BE CALLED
[1:29:49] MESSAGE BELIEVERS. WE DON'T NEED THAT
[1:29:51] kind of message, friends. What we NEED
[1:29:52] IS THE PURE UNADULTERATED WORD TO SPEAK
[1:29:55] TO A SEED GENE THAT CAME FROM GOD.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR MEMBERS. WE'RE NOT
[1:30:01] HERE TO MAKE MEMBERS. WE'RE NOT HERE FOR
[1:30:02] NUMBERS. WE ARE HERE TO FIND CHRISTIANS.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. People who WANT TO BE CHRISTLIKE,
[1:30:09] OBEY THE WORD AND surrender to the full
[1:30:11] measure of the word. WE'RE NOT HERE TO
[1:30:13] DROP THE BAR TO CHANGE THE STANDARD to
[1:30:16] make it easier for anybody. MY GOODNESS,
[1:30:19] I DON'T WANT MY LIFE TO BE EASY. Easy is
[1:30:22] always the wrong road. I want to
[1:30:23] surrender to his will.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; And I want his spirit to have his way in
[1:30:29] me.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; So that he can do because the spirit's
[1:30:32] going to lead me to the word.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL always
[1:30:36] lead me to the word of God and lead me
[1:30:38] to full obedience to the word of God.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how we know if it's the
[1:30:42] spirit of God or not.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; It'll always bring us into all truth.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amenise
[1:30:51] and Christ is the mystery of God. Reveal
[1:30:52] says Satan said, "But she turned around
[1:30:55] and listened to him. But the eve in the
[1:30:58] last day is not going to do it because
[1:31:00] she's predestinated not to do it." Yes,
[1:31:02] sir. God's going to do it. He knows
[1:31:04] he'll have it. He said the church would
[1:31:06] be there without spot or wrinkle. She is
[1:31:09] going to stand there in the splendor of
[1:31:10] him. His word made manifest.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE SPLENDOR OF HIM? HIS WORD
[1:31:16] made manifest. That's the full word that
[1:31:19] was RESTORED TO US IS ACTUALLY GOING TO
[1:31:21] BE ON A PEOPLE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE
[1:31:22] WEARING IT, PORTRAYING IT, MANIFESTING
[1:31:24] IT. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SOMETHING WE
[1:31:26] TALK ABOUT ON SUNDAY. IT'S SOMETHING
[1:31:27] THAT'S GOING TO BE MANIFEST EVERY DAY OF
[1:31:29] THE WEEK.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HIS SPLENDOR. AMEN. WE'RE NOT
[1:31:33] WE'RE NOT A MESSAGE CHURCH.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; That may sound odd to you. Yeah, this is
[1:31:39] a message church. But that's not what
[1:31:40] we're after.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; You don't want to be a message member of
[1:31:43] a message church. THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE
[1:31:46] AFTER, FRIENDS. YOU DON'T WANT TO COME
[1:31:47] HERE AND SIT on Sunday adhere to a
[1:31:49] certain teaching and say, "I'm a message
[1:31:50] believer." A message believer becomes
[1:31:53] the message.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; It's not SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE. IT'S
[1:31:56] SOMETHING YOU ARE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING
[1:31:58] YOU TALK ABOUT. IT'S SOMETHING YOU LIVE.
[1:31:59] IT'S SOMETHING YOU MANIFEST. IS
[1:32:01] SOMETHING THAT EXUDES OUT OF YOU EVERY
[1:32:03] DAY OF YOUR LIFE. THE VERY LIFE OF
[1:32:05] CHRIST. AND THIS word that's been
[1:32:06] restored, WHEN IT RESTORES A MAN TO HIS
[1:32:09] POSITION, HE LIVES IT. WHEN IT RESTORES
[1:32:10] A WOMAN TO HER POSITION, she lives it.
[1:32:12] WHEN IT RESTORES A CHURCH TO the truth,
[1:32:14] they preach it.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; It becomes living word, manifest word,
[1:32:20] the truth in the lives of the people.
[1:32:22] Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; That's why the temptation
[1:32:26] is to adjust it.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; So that we can keep people comfortable
[1:32:32] and coming and keep the pews full and
[1:32:35] keep all the youth and so we we give
[1:32:37] them things that they like and
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; oh what a temptation [clears throat]
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; and we just want to make it easy so that
[1:32:45] they'll come because we don't want them
[1:32:46] to go to the world.
[1:32:50] But remember, they don't have to leave
[1:32:52] the church to go to the world.
[1:32:55] That's
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; You can sit in the church and be in the
[1:32:58] world and
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; have the world in you.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; I say, God, help us not to fall trapped
[1:33:06] to reasonings,
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; to the lust of the flesh, the lust of
[1:33:09] the eyes, or the pride of life, but God,
[1:33:12] help us to stay surrendered and yielded
[1:33:14] to this pure, perfect, restored word
[1:33:17] that you gave us.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:19] If it gets rough, so be it. Let it get
[1:33:22] rough.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; If it takes to hide off of you, say,
[1:33:24] "Praise God. I don't like my flesh
[1:33:27] anyways."
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Why protect the very thing you're trying
[1:33:32] to get free from?
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Why guard your flesh and protect your
[1:33:36] flesh and PROTECT YOUR LISTEN, I WANT
[1:33:38] THIS. SO, I WANT TO BE SO RAD over the
[1:33:40] coals and scratched over rough SURFACES
[1:33:42] TILL FINALLY MY ATOMS CHANGE. LORD,
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not TRYING TO GET COMFORTABLE IN
[1:33:47] THIS FLESH. I'M TRYING TO GET OUT OF
[1:33:48] THIS FLESH. I'M TRYING TO GET THIS FLESH
[1:33:50] TRANSFORMED INTO THE perfect word.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; NOT TO BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE in it and
[1:33:56] compromise more with it and make more
[1:33:58] deals with my flesh. I want my flesh to
[1:34:00] come subject to the word of God.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Until it comes so subject that the final
[1:34:06] promise comes into manifestation and my
[1:34:08] Adams change.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand and we'll read this
[1:34:14] last scripture as the musicians come.
[1:34:15] This was the last scripture I read last
[1:34:17] Sunday and it' be the last one for this
[1:34:20] Wednesday. For all the flesh is as
[1:34:22] grass, and all the glory of man is as
[1:34:25] the flower of grass. The grass witherth,
[1:34:27] and the flower thereof fallth away, but
[1:34:30] the word of the Lord endureth forever.
[1:34:32] And this is the word which by the gospel
[1:34:34] is preached unto you. Praise be to God.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; What endures forever? Not the glory of
[1:34:44] man.
[1:34:45] not flesh.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; What endures forever is the word of the
[1:34:50] Lord.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; So let me not align with the flesh, but
[1:34:54] help me to align with the word of the
[1:34:55] Lord.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together and
[1:34:58] pray.
[1:35:00] Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful,
[1:35:02] Father.
[1:35:03] God, so thankful that you have given us
[1:35:07] your word. So thankful, Lord, that you
[1:35:10] sent a prophet in this day, Lord, and
[1:35:12] you vindicated that voice. so that we
[1:35:15] wouldn't be confused by all the rhetoric
[1:35:17] and all the religious talk that's going
[1:35:20] on all over the world. For God, man has
[1:35:23] taken your word and twisted it to any
[1:35:25] shape they desire
[1:35:27] so that they can make your word
[1:35:29] conformatable to the desires of whatever
[1:35:32] group they're part of. But God, that's
[1:35:34] not what we want.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. What we want, Lord, is
[1:35:38] not to be tempted to change your word or
[1:35:41] to mold your word, but we want to be
[1:35:43] surrendered to your word.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; God, I pray that you take this vessel of
[1:35:47] mine, Lord, and as I fall upon you,
[1:35:50] Lord, the revelation of the hour, may I
[1:35:52] be broken into pieces, Lord.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; And may you by your own hand, the great
[1:35:58] potter,
[1:35:59] take me the clay, and mold me and
[1:36:02] fashion me into your very likeness.
[1:36:06] structure me to manifest your word.
[1:36:09] Change my thinking, change my desires,
[1:36:11] change everything about me, Lord. May
[1:36:14] this word that I've received, Lord, and
[1:36:16] continue to receive, may it become my
[1:36:19] all in all.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; And God, may you strip away all pride
[1:36:23] and all vanity and all the lust of the
[1:36:25] flesh and all the lust of the eyes and
[1:36:28] all the pride of life. The very thing
[1:36:29] that started this whole thing going the
[1:36:31] wrong way in Eden
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; is the very thing you overcame by the
[1:36:35] word in the wilderness. And it's the
[1:36:37] very thing, God, you're calling your
[1:36:39] bride to overcome now that you've given
[1:36:41] us the word so that we can overcome by
[1:36:43] the word. And God, that word can never
[1:36:46] fail. Help us to stay with this revealed
[1:36:49] word that you've given through this
[1:36:50] prophet in this end time. And God, may
[1:36:53] we surrender all all the time. May you
[1:36:57] have your way with us and change us,
[1:36:59] Lord. We love you. We ask your blessing,
[1:37:01] Lord. May the things that were said and
[1:37:04] the things we've heard, may it become,
[1:37:06] Lord, may we be an urgency inside of us,
[1:37:09] Lord, to not be tempted to go the wrong
[1:37:12] way and not allow our flesh to deceive
[1:37:14] us. But God, may we become judges of our
[1:37:17] motive and our intentions, Lord. May
[1:37:20] you, may we be quiet enough before you
[1:37:22] that you begin to show us what's
[1:37:23] motivating us. Lord, may you help us not
[1:37:26] to fall into the same traps we've fallen
[1:37:28] into in the past. But God, may we learn
[1:37:30] to be quiet and contemplative and
[1:37:33] looking at your word and looking at
[1:37:34] ourselves. Help us discern what's the
[1:37:37] world and what's you. Amen.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; God, may we not push for things or pray
[1:37:41] for things that's contrary to your will.
[1:37:43] Lord, may we not seek after your
[1:37:44] permissive will. But may we stay solidly
[1:37:47] behind your perfect will. Knowing that's
[1:37:49] the wall that you've restored that was
[1:37:51] in Eid and now you've put it around your
[1:37:53] bride in the end time to keep us safe
[1:37:55] from the ws of the devil. May we stay
[1:37:58] solidly behind the wall of this word.
[1:38:00] God, may we give you first place so that
[1:38:02] you can have preeminence among us. Lord,
[1:38:05] touch your children. Bless them. Lord,
[1:38:07] as we go from here, Lord, we we're
[1:38:09] challenged every day by the world. We're
[1:38:11] challenged every day and to be tempted
[1:38:13] of the enemy. But God, I pray you give
[1:38:15] us overcoming power by your spirit to
[1:38:17] stay with your word regardless of
[1:38:20] everything else. We love you. We ask for
[1:38:23] these blessings and for this help in
[1:38:25] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:38:29] Amen. Brother John,
[1:38:31] just a closer walk with thee.
