TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and the message the identification of christ in all ages the prophet of god says you've told the truth you've had five and the one you're living with now is not yours he's out of john 4 the samaritan woman at the well look at that little woman see she had fallen from god's thoughts did that little woman come from did she come from parents in samaria i mean she was called a samaritan but that's only this dimensional amen that's only a title that works for this dimension where did she come from she didn't come from samaria she didn't come from a mother and father who were samaritan she didn't come from sakkar or whatever city she was in she had fallen from the thoughts of god there was something down inside of her amen that was in god was in the thoughts of god and then fallen she had fallen from the thoughts of god and landed amen as a little baby given to two little parents in samaria and she had the label of being sumerian but she wasn't a sumerian she was a daughter of god that's why we're not americans we're not americans we're not germans we're not africans we're not whatever nationality that you might be that's not who you are amen if you're a child of god you've fallen here from the thoughts of god amen and god is bringing his word to try to collect back all of his thoughts amen and with what for millions of people has been a stumbling stone called the message of the hour a prophetic gift that's been on the earth through a man named william branham who brought us back in contact with a living jesus christ for many it's a stumbling stone for you it's a sure foundation it's a precious stone amen it's a rock that you can base your whole life upon its foundation goes clear back to the mind of god where you tumbled from is where this rock came from and where this rock is rooted to amen for some they've stumbled over the message and stumbled over the prophet and stumbled over the signs but for those who have fallen from the thoughts of god amen he sent that very word to expose the thoughts of many's hearts oh sometimes it's not a bad thing to have the thought of your heart exposed sometimes it's even exposing it to you god is bringing this word to peel away layers that don't belong to you layers of hybridization layers of denominational thinking he's bringing the word what's he trying to do he's trying to expose what's in your heart so you can see what's in you we've lived so long in the intellectual realm being taught and being trained and coming through life and having circumstances and experiences and bible training but he sent a powerful word in this day to penetrate past the mind to get down into the heart amen so that he can see there's something there that fell from the thoughts of god
