========================================
[Music] and i know his fears [Music] lord please i feel [Music] do [Music] i close my eyes and worship you can run by as i hide away [Music] a quiet secret place hidden from views deep so deeply calling lord i'm drawing strength from you and i close my eyes and worship you [Music] everything can run by as i hide [Music] in you [Music] i've seen giants so big seen those giants fall we're pressing to the final [Music] and worship you everything can run by as i hide away in you and i close my eyes and worship you everything can run by as i hide oh in you i close my eyes and worship you hey everything can run by as i hide oh in your it's a piece that the world cannot understand my let's all just stand you know before we sing this next song i just had something to read to you [Music] can you just play that song softly [Music] i don't know if anybody knows the story too much of this song [Music] the man who wrote it was named horatio spafford he was a presbyterian and he was a businessman um he owned property just north of chicago in 1871. he lost his four-year-old son to scarlet fever and just a few months later the chicago fire wiped his entire business investment out two years later he decided to take a european trip with dwight l moody to great britain but because of all the complications in the business he wasn't able to go on time and he sent his he sent his wife and his four daughters and as they're going across the ocean they struck a ship [Music] and the ship sank in 12 minutes [Music] 226 people lost their life including all four of his daughters [Music] his wife finally got back to the shore and in britain and telegram back two words saved alone i can only imagine the grief that he was going through so horatio decided to get a voyage and start going that way and as he got closer to the where his daughter's ship went down he started pinning the words it is well with my soul and he penned the words when sorrows like sea billows roll this hymn doesn't diminish or gloss over pain or tragedy but it proclaims that god is present in us and with us every single day psalms 46 1-3 said god is our refuge and strength a very present help and trouble therefore therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed though the mountains be carried in the midst of the sea so the waters therefore thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof selah my the perilous times that we have right now i wonder if we could just sing this song and just worship him because knowing it is well in my soul oh in peace road it is [Music] [Music] let this his own gloves with my soul with my [Music] when my us oh [Music] is is [Music] is oh it is soul it is my soul [Music] it is well [Applause] amen what an appropriate song for the day that's how we want to feel we want to feel well no issue with my soul and that's why we are here to encourage each another to feel that way it is well it's um um as we are standing up um let's just go straight to the word of god thank you brother franco for displaying the scripture one scripture we're gonna read revelation chapter eight verse 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was a silence in heaven above the space of an hour half an hour let me read it again and when he had opened the seventh hill there was a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour may god is at his blessing to the reading of the word let's pray heavenly father we went to school we know how to read but the context the revelation the inspiration must come from you because men are not coming to hear another man but they're coming to hear from you so come down in your power of resurrection and speak to our heart today father you know our needs there may be someone on the sidelines that need you today father and i want to just put myself aside and let you do what you need to do this morning we come with expectation there's so much going on father it takes you father to speak to your children no one else died for them you die on the cross for them no one paid the price you pay the price it's you father we just are being used as a tools we had tools in your hands please come down and do your perfect will with us this morning in jesus christ's name we prayed amen you may be seated ah it's a really unprecedented time it's an amazing time um the symbolic the symbology is just amazing too we live in a time where companies are telling us to go home to work from home and the deaf angel is going around killing anybody that he can find so they say go home that sounds like a gaussian to me and we all have to be inside and make sure that in the inoculated blood is on the post wow and the first born are making sure that the dad did just that dad are you sure the blood is applied well the deaf angel that is going out today is killing the flesh is killing the body but uh in this time the death angel purpose is to kill the soul therefore it's important we can say it is well it is well in my soul we got the inaugurate blood of jesus christ the virus can kill but he kills the body it doesn't kill me i am inside there amen so uh during this time too i receive a census bureau letter telling me to fill up and go on the website and fill up about everybody that lives in my house what a symbology again in the time where jesus was to be born everybody had to go home and do the senses during the time when everybody goes home there's a census because jesus must be born it's just amazing hallelujah what a time we we're living in it feels like the song that says the day of redemption is near i will say is here the day of redemption is here return you disperse to your own everything is telling us to go home to return to our home to our land and we were buried in a certain land the name of the lord jesus christ and he is the word right return time to return to feel that is well in my soul amen this morning i want to talk about um what is in silence what is in the silence we just read this scripture revelation chapter 8 disclaimer i'm not quite preaching on seals but let me touch a little bit that uh what is in the silence we find out that when the seals were open there was a symbol coming out there was a voice there was an activity taking place but when this last seal is open there is a silence there is no symbol there is no voice or sound there is no activity and brother branham read another scripture revelation chapter 10 and revelation chapter 10 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven cloth with a cloud and then rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as the pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried out let me go there and he cried out i cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he cried seven thunders uttered the voices and when the seven thunders had had their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me sit up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and i will just stop there and go back what is in this silence the prophet tells us that yes each seal had a symbol a voice and something that's taking place but this one is just a silence and we want to know what is in silence because otherwise he will not be put in the bible just for us to say there was a silence and that's all no there is something and that something must be very important it's not just for knowledge but it has something for the bride to catch now brother branham gave us his first interpretation of the silence in the message the seventh seal and he say and now as certain as i stand in the platform tonight i had the revelation that revealed it's in a three-fold manner that i will speak to you by god's help of of a fault of it and then you let's go over that first here is the revelation to begin what i want to tell you what it is what happened is those seven thunders that he heard thunder and was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive thunders rolling out so he's telling us first revelation in in this silence where nothing is said no symbol nothing will that silence the the revelation chapter 10 with the seven thunders actually uh uh the seven thunders speaks about that silence amen in other words is telling us that uh the silence has a voice and the voice is the seventh hundredths amen my brother when i'm uh here is knock on the puppet several times to talk about the seven thunders and say now why let us prove it why is the secret that no one knows about what is the secret that no one knows about john was forbidden to write about it even write a symbol about it why this is why there was no activity in heaven it might give away the secret do you see it now so he's telling us that uh the uh the silence uh is about what john was forbidden to write in other words he's telling us the silence in revelation chapter 8 is actually revelation chapter 10. one is in symbol or in no symbol in a silence the other one has a voice so basically the prophet is telling us that revelation chapter 8 equal revelation 10. amen so there is a voice in the silence amen when nothing is written something is written but it takes the prophet to show us what is not written it takes the prophet to take some some bar some sharp object and cut the head of the pyramid and show us a white white stone that no sun has a shine on and tell us that what is not written is this and it must be very important it's just not just for our knowledge it must be critical because it looks like the bride has to catch the silence [Applause] amen amen it says it was a silence theologians when they come here they say there was a silence and that's it because other other seals they can try to mimic something try to tell you it's about love the the horseman is going to to conquer love and all that but when you get to this one they say it was a silence i heard the denomination of men saying that i i guess he was joking he said there were no women in heaven that was not good yeah because they don't know they they try to make up something now revelation chapter 8 the silent has actually a sound are you with me i'm just keep building it i'm not speaking about seals and i'm going to go out on a limb i'm going to feel a little bit free even though i'm nervous but i won't care about that building a little foundation to share with you a thought so when somebody share with you a thought you know i need the disclaimer to tell you i'm sharing this thought with you about what what i felt god given to me and i want to share with you now um revelation 8 sound there is no sound it's a silence symbol no symbol no activity silent but the prophet said to us it's revelation 10. that's where the symbols are that's where the voice is there is a symbol there are more than one symbol there the lion is rolling sound seven thunders uh uttering the voice there is a sound there is an activity and that activity we know is the secret coming of the lord is that right but it was all in silence and god knew that you and i need this so god made sure to give us a prophet who can read where nothing is written and silence doesn't mean there is no activity you hear barbara say that at the beginning when he's reading the symbol and he say silence no activity then it will show us that actually there is activity there is the coming of the lord the secret coming of the lord there is something there but it takes a prophet to go and see it and read what is not written but i'm saying that silence is showing silence doesn't mean no activity you say great things happen in the silence it's a great things are quite things in the message what the does thou hear did you know that friends listen the sun which gives life on the earth to every living thing in botany uh plant life botany life plant life three life whatever more it brings forth life the sun does and it can draw a million gallons of water from the earth you've been reading faster than me i know i caught you yeah now and make less noise then we can get a back full out of a pump but i don't say that but we can i can just ask somebody give me some water and i will hear so much noise just a cup of water what is that noise um is the dishwasher uh what is but god moved tons of tons of water from the earth in complete silence you see it's a big thing quiet things are big things did you hear did you ever hear the world turning did you ever hear the planets as they passed through the orbit do you ever hear one that's the big things did you ever hear the sun rise so silence doesn't mean nothing is happening great things actually happen in the silence amen now we'll continue brother when i'm explaining to us the silence of this the revelation chapter 8 in the message christ is the mystery of god reveal it's a god great mystery and how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knew know nothing about it even the angels did not understand it see he did not reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh sea was open there was a silence and then he started explaining what was in that silence jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come so there is that activity right there it was hidden in this island they want to know when jesus is coming and he say he said he's he said it's even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that the reason there was a silence in heaven for a space of half an hour um and seven thunders after their voices in john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord what is in the silence there is a coming of the lord a secret coming of the lord in israel [Applause] it takes a prophet to do that that's one thing he has not revealed yet and how it will come and when he will come it's a good thing that it does it and no if you listen at the tape very closely brother branham takes a pose he poses there he has not revealed it he he has not revealed it yet how he will come when he will come no no i don't see ministers make a big no it should be a big no because he's telling us he say that he didn't tell us how he will come how he will do it and then he will say no and then he will start going to actually he revealed it it didn't show it he didn't say about he didn't say anything about it there was a silent no he did amen i think you should say it in a british english no he said it that was my only british english that i it was he has showed and revealed it in every type that is in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god mystery in christ huh the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible i want you to notice that uh i highlighted how is show it in every type in the bible i highlight it because basically what he is saying to me is that this silence is in a type that you see in the bible there is a there is the public reading the public message to people when we look at david when we look at moses we look at all this character in the bible god hide hid is a mystery in this uh in this characters that's very important now let's continue here and say and all the acts of the uh of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing that god great goal is and now in this last day it has to reveal it and show it and god and god's help we will see will sit right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it so this is actually where i was trying to build my foundation to show you that the there is a public part so when you we read the scripture we see there is a two part in the scriptures took part in the types of the bible you know two parts one is spoken the other one is silent and god wants us and these days if you have noticed god is walking us through scriptures and bring to our view what is actually written behind all this character behind the roots behind enoch behind david and it's very it's so critical for us to see those things they are not just for our knowledge but actually great things happen in the silence and the elect cut cut the silence if you are the elect you don't read the the bible the word like a newspaper but you catch the silence behind it and that's very critical amen yes so all the types in the bible and people go to church they read the scripture everybody read it they always seen it but we need to for the elect it is to to read the silence that's written behind that and that's what actually makes the difference you know let me just give you a little example here you know the woman um the tennessee woman the story of the tennessee woman this woman grounded by the branham airplane you remember the story but what happened to her she always goes to church they read the the bible they read this story of the shunammite woman they read the public portion of that message but she did not read it that way she look at this story she looks at the story and suddenly she sees the silence behind the story and then she say i am that shunammite woman because god does not do exception of person i i did not have a child i prayed to the lord he gave me a child man then the child grew up and went with the bad crowd and then now is dying with a social uh disease and i am the shunammite woman in the bible so the bible was not just written so that we can have a good thing to to read she actually caught the silence behind the written word of god and then she say since i am the shunamite woman where is elijah and when she say that in her world elijah did not exist i want you to understand that in her world there was no elijah she never heard about buddha branham nothing about by the brain no elijah she read it but she's so more than what is written she saw the silence then she called into existence elijah because he was not there is that right and elijah came yeah and and she she's actually asking brother brandon brenner and she's asking him i saw you had your suitcase with you how did this you know i'm saying yes it's true it's true i left it in the hotel she called elijah in in existence because she was able to read the silence that is behind the written world and that's what we need to get to because otherwise it's going to be christianity otherwise it will be just the system it's good we come to church is very important it's a critical but we have to go beyond that we have to go beyond the daily routine of doing this and doing that all the things are important but until and unless we read and listen to the silence we still a nominal christian but i want all to be well in my soul and it cannot just be by by the public portion it got to come to the private portion of the scripture now when you read the book you read the malachi 4 look this woman read malachi 4 before us behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the the coming of great and dreadful day of the lord that's how we read it all the time god sent the prophet god's in the prophet god's in the prophet god send a prophet not good enough [Music] now we gotta go into the silence of it god send you i will send you we always drop the you and we forget that elijah could not come without you so when you read grammatically you see you comes before elijah so who is the most important is you and who's you is the bride who is more important is the bride elijah is only sent to her is that right yeah the more we look at the word of god the more we look at the word of god we see christ the more we look at christ the word the more we look at it we must see ourself it is a silenced portion of the world it's critical amen brother branham agreed with a doctor doctor scofield you know him right we go we all have this bible but he says something very important very good and by the way i agree with him in the message is this the sign of the end time he said the mystery here here is the mystery a mystery is scripture is a previously hidden it's true now revealed by which but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation that's where we want to go we want to go to that supernatural element that isn't a scripture we don't want to just read the public one so otherwise uh you know when you get to the silence of the scripture it gives you fear it gives you fear which is the reverence you will not say it you will not do it because a man called branham did it but because god convinced you that i send him for you [Music] it becomes a person of things and this is very important right now more than ever we see everything coming together the world is crumbling this is a time where children of god has to go home in your own land the land of the name of the lord jesus christ the word back to the word but not just the reading of the word the hidden part that revelation that is hidden is given to you personally therefore i'm not saying but a child preaches no the same i know but i'm saying no matter how much i am anointed you must be anointed too therefore god will speak to me in my house when i come here god will repeat it in but a child's mouth it will not be him i heard the silence portion of that word it's critical what about a mixer strange declaration if you ever notice he say the preaching of the gospel blind have you heard him what gospel the bible the scripture yeah is talking about the letters the blind people that's why you say the oral roberts let me read it he said putting on the all the whole armor of god he said two of them more than billy graham and oral roberts they went to uh sodom right his message went down into sodom preaching the word blinding them with the word to disbelieved to disbelieve the word you are blind the preaching of the gospel blind the unbeliever and that's what billy graham and those great evangelists are doing blinding taking people by preaching well it's the bible they preach but what does it do it brings them it binds them together to go into the ecumenism but yet they preach the word yes that's why we cannot stay just like that because god did not do it for the elect you see he said but there was one that stayed with abraham the elect and what he did was to read the silence to abraham will i hide the thing to abraham is a friend we need to hear that it has to be personal for the believer the word the word the water of the world if it's just the scriptures if it's just the writing they don't help some things have to go with it something a mystery a silent part you know brother abraham abraham used to say i wish i was a preacher this is the time where i wish i was a preacher and when he say it i know what he means i know i know i i wish at this time i'd be brought a chat because i will show it this way we show it that way i will go this way do you still see it do you see i hide it see it and it will still make sense amen amen for the elect god said goes into the secret speak to them things that really don't make sense that's why the elect doesn't have to go and find out what happened the cloud the bridge because god has already spoken to you the in the silence he said shh it's i so it's not somebody that i have to go investigated here and there why did this happen that happened no god spoke to me the same angel of the lord that was sent to william branham spoke to me all the same spirit that was anointing william branham anointing me therefore i don't have that time and when the when the pastor preaches or a minister preaches the same anointing on that the preacher is on me that's why i don't ask you the word of god i don't have that strength to argue the word of god otherwise what's going to happen church it is what the prophet speaks about when he went in the wood one day he went in a wood let him talk about it he say here how can i overcome you say i was crossing an old log the other day down a washing what is called a hollow and i jumped up on this log on the outside it looked good looked like a big old bleach log but when i jumped on it oh a great chunk of it fell off it was rotten and daddy say that's the way the christians are becoming they dead in sin and trespasses so long till becoming dirty they can hold no weight at all they don't know what the overcoming means so think about this this lock this piece of wood or the piece of tree if it had germatized if he had received that portion that is hidden it would have germatized it will be strong but right now he receive all the water of the world day in day out it becomes soft therefore i say to all elected go back to your own return oh you the dispersed to your own your own is not necessary the church the local church although it is important but return to your own return to receive life otherwise the more you receive life without life inside you become soft god help us i want to sing with you brother ben it's well in my soul as well in my soul but the more we spend time in the message people like us we came to the message today god revealed this message to us when i was 21 years old now young people i'm almost 60 very old oh they want to collapse give them an aspirin no the more we spend time in the message without that thing to take place the life to take place it becomes dirty soft is is scary as we see all the signs we can't afford to keep going the way we did we can't afford the system anymore it's time we go back go back the senses is out there the angel of death is out there let me go back home and go back to the word jesus christ is the word but the word revealed to me personally i don't want to go round and round you see i was talking about how long i've been there how long 81 do the math hit ah wow how long have been in the message and that's very dangerous if life is doesn't take place it become even worse because after we leave you hear the word you hear the word you live here you you start hearing but the the pastor just spoke about this why why you what is why do you have this attitude we just heard it were you in the church maybe you were not in the right church my church is over there i don't know well what is going on but the good thing is god is correcting all of us even when i see a brother who was here listening to the word and is acting maybe they spoke about the criticism and things like that and after we leave here it comes out of their mouth now i know by what we heard is not them against us it's my duty to make sure this brother or this sister go goes back in line come back go home it's my duty now i don't i don't have to do it selfishly i understand it's the part of the body i had to cry out for the sins that are committed in the city therefore i have to bring everyone that is still acting this way to the lord because there is no more [Applause] time verbum continues here in uh that the same message and he say when he look at that log he start thinking about his message and i begin to think of this message then overcome keep life in you when life went out that's what brought that log to that condition see it made it worse than ever when it laid in the branch where the water where the water was and then there you you take a christian that's supposed to be a christian let the life of god go from him and the experience the joy of serving christ and living in the church where such a thing is going on erupts erotic twice as quick right living right under the more we hear the word and the level the word has gotten church if nothing changes we're gonna get worse it's time for us to pose is time for us to do like they did in goshen is the blood of life it's no longer the the religion of my father and mother is mine i gotta pause and go into the silence with the lord and say i am tired of following my parents now you gotta talk to me it has to talk to your heart i'm not talking about there's any supernatural something you can do it but i'm talking about down there where the secret is you know the story of uh rebecca eliza let me just read the portion of it genesis chapter 24 eliezer was concerned he was concerned the woman will not be willing to follow me maybe she will not be she will not want to be called um uh branamite um you following amen so you say this is a problem if the woman doesn't want to follow me and the servant the serpent as the servant said unto him per adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land the land of the name of the lord jesus the land of the message the land of the world we heard the message is not easy it's like a big marble stone rock yeah will she be willing and must must i need to bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou comest and abram said unto him beware thou thou that thou bring not my son tyler again the lord of heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred which speak unto me and thus swear unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he shall send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from tents and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this oath only bring not my son tither again and the servant put his hand under the tie of abram his master and swear to him concerning that matter the servant eli israel was still concerned he want to make sure that the woman that i will pick will be the one that god has in his mind for isaac so he's going to pray anyhow so uh genesis 20 24 10 and the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he aroused and went to mesopotamia unto the city of neho and he made his cameras to kneel down with without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water you can see symbolism everywhere but i cannot get to that now it's all over the place now and he say verse 12 and he said oh lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of men of the city come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i so say let down thy picture i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give this camel's drink also let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that that has show kindness unto my master which i want to say let let think let think that this the eliza did not just uh speak to one girl let's just say that there were a few girls coming just for the to dramatize it a little bit so a girl comes to fetch the water and eliza says okay um can you give me some water to drink and she said okay she did something really good okay i'll give it to you she gave her devotion she went to church she did everything that uh we do she paid her ties and offering and she sings she did all the things that we do but yet that was not her until rebecca comes what was different with rebecca every other girl heard the public portion of the world but rebecca heard the silent one remember heard what is was not spoken everybody heard what was spoken give me uh lay down your peach peach picture and i'm going to drink from it but rebecca heard the what was not saying what was in the silence she heard it do you see why critic it is critical you know if she did not hear what was in silence she would have given to eliza water which is good what is nice what this is what we do we come to church we have a devotion we do everything right but there is one step that we have to take and that is critical she heard what was not spoken and that's how the elect is you catch god mind for something it's not just what what people said but you catch god mind and you come out you say god spoke to me today but i was in a church too yeah you didn't get the silence god told me to stop doing this to stop wearing this but i was in a church i have my opinion yes but there is a silence in what was being preached preachers we make a lot of noise but what count is the silence amen that's exactly right she got what eliza did not want to say openly [Music] you see i'm quoting brother branham somehow yes sometimes we they are sometimes when we just hear the message we look at the person who give the message sometimes we can kind of even judge the person who gave the message sometimes we feel like what do you think you are better than us but i'm just being very uh blind yeah do you think you better than us but if god has spoken to you you can't never say that right that's why it's very important by the end of the service you will unders you will love the silence good things happen the silence when you go to your knees in your closet great thing happened then when you come out of it great thing has already happened people just see the manifestation of the silence in the closet it's critical to have that time when when the message preached to us is about love ah those messages were wonderful but if we take it just like because it was said after a while it's going to be difficult after a while when attitudes don't change and all that is going to be difficult you start feeling like people are taking advantage of me because when we go to church the pastor speaks about love and this it starts taking a toll on you but you need to hear through the silence then you'll be no problem god say that to me amen i struggle too with the love message i struggle in the past i i preach long time and actually i start preaching almost the age of my son enoch and you struggle with this because it doesn't make it doesn't sound right and when love is being preached yeah let just preach about it the way the prophet says it and let's talk about affection friendship and all that caring about each other it's what the church does but that's not the love that god wants us to get to as the so now it's it was a struggle for me you know and but god is opening the hidden portion of scripture that we have always read it do you see his church do you see his mighty hand every day we come to church god using any of his ministers is just opening something but we always read it yeah you were reading the public one but when you have a life that is dedicated consecrated you pray you come with expectation then god start opening this portion that silence portion is very important amen then i heard something that i was talking about without giving a definition i heard about capstone love love based on understanding based on love of understanding based on the revelations aha that's exactly right do you remember brother burnham speaking about the hornets the bull exactly he said when he was crossing a place he was going through he jumped a fence he went to a place where he was going to pray for a sick person and then as he jumped in that fence he forgot that there was a very very uh very very mean bull in that place and the bull was coming to kill him and barbara realized that he didn't have any gun so he say i'm going just to die like a man i won't be a coward so um but something happened to him you know understanding and look at the bull he understood the book he understood his anger i said i am in your turf this is your place i am an intruder it's my fault he understood the anger as we can understand some behavior of our brothers without doing what they're doing without doing what my sister is doing if it's contrary to the word of god but i can understand why they're doing it say i i came in your territory you have the right to defend it it's my fault but i'm going to i'm going to pray for some buddy who's sick so let me go go sit down but say that something took him amen we are called to get to that to that agape love that's where we are called to amen god help us the hornet was the same thing i came to disturb you i understand why you you need you have to attack me i understand i understand why this brother the sister is acting this way maybe something in the family something in in how she grew up and something happened and and sometimes misunderstanding of what the church actually is you know which sometimes we misunderstand let me just say it sometimes we misunderstand because there is a social component to the church all the things are very critical but once we take our eyes off what is important then we go with the social this person did not greet me i came to greet and they turned i won't go to the church anymore the only thing we lose our eyes on the balls and this is when before i would look maybe i would look at that person and say oh there's still babies but now the word is telling us that's the wrong attitude too we are in this together so if they don't grow i'm not growing or they don't grow i'm not going it's us is our body therefore now my attitude must change [Applause] absolutely now i don't see it it's not a selfishness it's not like them against us we holy they are now how he looks like we are all in it all of us it's not me and my family we all have to go no one left behind he changed our attitude and god is not into the think of that we do like them and us holy and no god it is not in that [Music] do i still have time but i'm saying you don't have room for me to preach and i say to you you don't have time for me to preach the elected listen to the public message and look for the private one that's what changes you i remember friend of mine yeah his wife was not converted and she kept telling him do not ever ask me to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ don't do that and she was a very nice person but when it came to that she was really um and uh brother said no we don't do that so one day she came to church a simple message was preached she said she told us later i want that preacher to stop preaching i want to stop it i'm going to the to be baptized now stop preaching that's when we go two hours or more she went and was baptized why she heard the silent spot all the thing that was happening never reach her we need when we come to church to get that part it's very important it's indispensable amen amen now i i warn you that i'm going to go out on a limb uh do you like that can i feel at home all right if you you remember brother brenham in 1955 when he saw the division a tent or some construction that looked like a cathedral i guess it was a dome that impacted his life so much and keep he didn't understand what was it and later on god is keep telling him that it was his third pull and he preached about it and always when he preached about it if i i if i can remember you always compare it to the tabernacle in the wilderness now so i was looking at those structure then i came across something here you see when you go on the internet you try to find what the tabernacle was they draw it kind of like that a rectangular and things like that then i came to something that maybe you can just look it's just interesting okay and you see this is an article that i pull on the internet is indifferent to newspaper but recently a man called andrew hai a mechanic engineer from milwaukee milwaukee wisconsin has challenged this traditional notion of what the tabernacle looked like by suggesting it was instead a large tent nearly sixth story high you say it's not really rectangular it's like a cathedral it's like a tent according to the breaking news uh israel breaking news hoy journey started when he left the lithuarian church he was attending in america to study hebrew at a jewish seminary in israel hoy then use a computer program to create a tent and defense and defense that matisse meticulously met both the biblical quantities and the description while at the same time follow the engineering principles this new topic ended up being six stories high a much more imposing structure than traditionally envisioned as israel camped around the large tent it would be visible to nearly everyone no matter how far back they were so he said not this but it was so strange brother branham speaking about the tenth vision he said it's like a cathedral was he looking at the dome something really big and this man goes and starts studying hebrews and look at the measurement even he says in the bible pie you know pie oh children pie three three point fourteen help me here all right insist those he put the measurement together and uh this is what he came up with it came up with a tent round in shape of a cathedral and this is what barbara speaks about i was like in a big structure big children and according to hoy um similar to mongolian herd he heard the tabernacles a rounded ship would stand up to the wind better than a rectangular construction hoy's perception of the the tabernacle is unique and will certainly challenge many long held perceptions of what it actually looked like it was just so strange interesting how come the prophet always talked about its tent like a cathedral and yet in our mind when we look at the tabernacle where the holiest of all is where it looks like it's square everywhere you look on the internet you will find that structure except when i look at this man and this this hoy say that it looks like a mongolian earth i don't know if you say you're too young i don't know and this is what is the mongolian yacht and brother burnham say i was under a bed it looks like a cathedral a tent and he he what he say and just then he picked me up it took me up and set me up high to where a meeting was going on looked like a tent or cathedral of some sort and i looked and there was a little box like a little place over in in this in the side this doesn't change change anything but just interesting we always knew that he is going to be square but he looks like this uh this man find a structure that looks like brother branham vision i want to talk just about that because what is happening in that tent is critical what is happening is in the tent there is a little box a little place on in the side and i seen that light that was taking to talking to somebody above me the light that you see there on the picture it wheeled away from me like that and went over that tent and say i will meet you there the light for the first time leaves the angel and goes into that structure and say i will meet you there i said this will be the third pool you won't tell it to nobody and in saving your canyon he said this is the third pole i like always to refer to this message because there is a silence somewhere there there is a small structure in that big structure that every one must get in every christian everyone under the cathedral of the message must get in everyone who claimed to be message believer under this big umbrella of message believer has to get in and you only get there one person at a time and when you go there there is no symbol there is nothing that you can bring out there is a connection from your soul to god himself amen is the silence that we all need especially in this time where we have to go back to our land amen listen what he's saying and a real problem continues in what is a vision 1956 and a real kind gentleman walked out to the platform and say while brother branham is resting just a few moments he said we will call the prayer line and say everyone with a prayer prayer cards begin with a certain number stand over and on to the right well i know this is the prayer line seems like it went all around the tent and out and down the street such a prayer line everyone what is it a mega church a multi-mega church will it ever exist or it is a symbol of everyone that believes the message that while brother branham got into his silence we now all of us without exception get into that structure where the anointing went to and be there face to face with god a personal revelation with god it's that time or not while by the banana is resting because when brother bernam was alive you and i could not read the message it was the message we will all have gone to jeffersonville the real estate market in jeffersonville will be booming because our i am the first guilty i'll be there i will have gone there buy a house next to by the wood and every day sending my prayer request where are my keys i didn't see my key today that's what we will do we will never read the message i i used to tell people i say we actually killed brother branham because if he was alive we will never read the message that's how god has to take him he was very young now that i'm looking at it i can see brother brennan was really young but the chad doesn't see it yet but he was really young but it has to go once it goes there is a time where we have to become serious about what we heard and not just the this what is it the letter but we we have to really stop and go inside that structure otherwise we have been wasting our time the line is very long it goes outside i look at it i say people that are still coming to the message they're outside the line the line is outside they get inside people that are in the message we need to stop the system and stationarity we have to individually there is no exception about it this is serious business my brothers and sisters everyone has to go into that little building you come out you can't explain we have to get to the point where we don't explain the message otherwise somebody will convince you otherwise why do you believe i believe because god told me it's true [Music] amen how god speaks to you speaks to you through your soul the first the first sign was in his hand there was a summer the first sign was in the end you could feel taste all right you could touch field test touch whatever five senses the second sign was the mind he said i am going to i i am catching your spirit it was the spirit the second sign but the third is not even a sign yeah we can say is a sign of his judgment but the third is not just a sign is himself the third pull is himself you gotta go meet himself otherwise we are losing we are wasting our time you go inside the angel is not even there in that place the angel sent from the lord is not there the pillar of fire is with you alone personal private oh private message meaning god speaking to you privately it's very critical my mind i told you already you don't have time for me to preach that doesn't mean i don't appreciate but i appreciate him giving me god put in his heart that maybe i have something that can help someone maybe someone standing on the sidelines you know all right let's just share those oh for another few minutes you see i've seen things i share with my family this more than once the level of the anointing that is happening in these days it's so high that if we don't pay attention the rotting will be terrible so i remember one day it was actually february saturday february the 15th i had a dream where i see myself as a soldier it looks like i'm like a soldier so it means that i must have uniform and i'm a soldier you know uh and then and then i see like i spot the enemy maybe in front i spot the enemy here and it looks like i'm kind of telling the group with me let's go back let's go back because we spot the enemy and we go and i'm i'm a sodium yeah and then it looks like we go into a some sort of a break maybe in our trenches and and then i i'm talking to somebody i don't know who i'm talking to but i just remembered i was talking to somebody and i say to the person i say i have one regret being a soldier i never received the formal training that's my regret all this i never thought about it during the day it's not like i ate a big meal or spicy meal but it just happened that way so here is a february 15 sunday 16 i get to church and whatever where the chad was the one preaching [Music] he came and he said uh let's read second timothy two uh second timothy chapter two three to four he say uh thou therefore undue hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that whereif entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who had chosen him to be soldier what i thought if we go to jeffersonville then we will see brother branham then he will give us interpretation of dreams then he will do the discernment but the discernment is here the world that we hear has a discernment power and is so powerful then the title of the message was an army prepared and when a child was preaching and saying that we need to be trained well the answer to my dream we need to be trained because we have we will have greater responsibilities you still you remember the message he said you cannot take a kid and give them a big responsibility with a big weapon they have to be trained and explain about the training the uh the preparation i want to forget that it was a preparation training because with a great uh blessing comes a bless great responsibilities god is just answer me you know sometimes you can go to a place we have seen it happening many times where out of the blue the preacher points something that you did but i'm telling you as a preacher after being in this journey for very long time what we sing now is higher because what happened is i could just forget the supernatural side of all that i saw and just stick with what was being preached it answered everything it's not just something out of the blue but it's that the word is being explained to you from the beginning to the end i don't know how to say this is another layer another level amen and that's what we we want then then it it's not the word from a man that is my word then i am the message and that day but it was saying that we need teaching we need training preparation we have a greater responsibility hey i'm getting the interpretation of my dream right there on the pulpit the thing i'm trying to show you is i could not have seen that dream but yet i can just go with the word i was preached that's another level god help me to say this this is when i want to be a preacher oh my god every scripture has a public portion and a private one he has a a uh a spoken portion and a silent one and i want to be able to get into the silent one not for knowledge sake but to get to to get somewhere with god to get somewhere with god i need that portion first timothy i don't know if i'm going to finish this one ah maybe i wouldn't finish with this one first timothy chapter three this is a true saying if a man desired the office of bishop he desires a good work and this is the conditions well um this this this is strange to me okay let me go back if a man desire the office of bishop he desire good work is it possible is it possible for a man to wake up one morning and say i desire to be a bishop so i'm not reading it right all right this is what i'm talking about there must be a silent part to this because nobody can just come and say ah i feel like being a bishop well yeah no no no a man cannot just go and say i want to be a bishop something must happen but that part is not being said that part is a silent because a man has to be called it's all right it has to be called and sometimes god must have twisted his arm very for very long time because it turned out that when you ca when god calls you to the ministry you have a tendency of running away and therefore if you say that a man desire an office he has done a good thing i don't understand that there must be something that is not being said and that's why it says that a man uh because if i had written it i would say that a man who desired to be a bishop is actually a novice because it's uh unless this person has been called unless this person has been called unless god twisted his arm then he realized that that's what i need to do then if they're looking for a a bishop somewhere that person can say i gotta do it because that's my calling but the person cannot just walk up one morning and say oh i i it's fun to be a bishop i want to be one [Music] that i can keep going and and on and on and on but uh it is uh there must be something hidden behind it because this job is is not an easy one and everyone needs to be praying for this office god help us it is a is is hard i remember one time i held that uh office long time ago is good when you you're old you can talk about the law all the stories and maybe nobody will know what i'm talking about i remember one time having a new church and there is a our first wedding as is taking place and and suddenly something starts happening and we hear that the sister who's want to get married actually the sister has been living not the right life that's not our problem they want to get married is their problem well it turned out the sister was actually really into the world and she's sick she had aids and the pastor he comes to me and actually god tells me that i'm going to stop the joy of the fiancee of these two people instead of the joy of getting married you know they're going to be mourning here i am i am a new minister my pastor is far away there is no good communication what am i going to do if this brother marries this girl chances are he's going to die how are to do there's nobody there is nobody and i never been trained by the way to be a pastor what to do and remember a girl can be six years or eight years old she already dreamed about when she'll be in a white dress and i am the one called to ruin that and what to do just close my eyes and say i didn't hear anything but i have to do something and i i go and i uh i say okay i you know wedding is a big thing family involved friends other churches it's a big one and why do you stop the wedding ah we stopped the wedding because our pastor what pastor you you the brennamite what happened to him he he think he's god he's going to stop that and i have nobody i don't even have a minister to help me and i can share with that minister the issue i'm far away i'm alone scriptures must have a silent portion of it and here is god is telling me there will be no joy there would be no feasts there will be mourning and it turns out that the day once i say i'm going to stop this marriage the church went into turmoil people came out and they say badaka is using rumors and the church split and and the day of wedding came and i stood on the pulpit and i started crying i just whipping oh crying like a baby the very next day the brother came to me called me the brother who left the church who has who left the church who has um who want to get married he calls me and he says nothing and i knew that he got the sickness i knew he's going to die i cry to the lord i cry to the lord asking him god forgive this brother but he never worked then i said to the lord if you want to take this brother i don't want to be there and god agrees he moved me from that country so i won't see the brother die what a responsibility so but if this brother and this sister had heard the voice not from the past stopping the wedding if they had heard from god himself if the brother had gone to his knees and say my pastor is a man it has a flows that's what god uses man he could use a moon star but he has to use a man to show that he can bring redemption through men despite their flaws if they had gone on their knees and pray and say god you send me this man to help me i will send you elijah the prophet who is the most important is you if they had done it these things will not have happened and everybody that people that left the church because all the pastors say this it does this and it does this they win and they were plagued of the flag of the plagues we don't want to talk about this type of things but i was thinking about that scripture i say every scripture that we see has a hidden part an unspoken one how can this be that this is true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desires a good work is that true no it takes god to take that man and twist his arm i remember coming to the united states and i'm just you know oh how my children will live here and god is telling me preach the gospel what preach the gospel i don't speak the language i don't have the culture how can i speak preach the gospel and he was using words like abraham lincoln he was a man standing on the principles he was not afraid he made the right decision and that's how god was talking to me and i i actually twisted my arm then i started designing the office of a bishop then he put me there um who how are you going to start the the church well your family is the first church my children the youngest was like a two years old the oldest was like about seven okay we're gonna start the service the children came with anticipation they loved it so we sit with i started preaching to them my wife said i thought you were preaching to children how they edify me too you see and a sister an american sister heard us we have a service and she came she came and sit down and start listening to the world the next day she said i i brought my ties so what then another sister came and then another one heard that that was a minister in jeffersonville and he also and she also came and that's how the service started i just i took this i took a long turn here but my point is the same a spoken portion of the word but there is another one that is a silent one it's very important as the world is crumbling that everything is failing now we go back we go back each and everyone and and return really to the portion to the place that god has called us to be the book of acts brother branham say is a book that never been closed is that right i want when my journey is finished when everything is done and when this book is continued to be written i don't want to be a hinder in any way for the move of the holy ghost it's very easy to do that because we are human being you know we look at each other as a human being but the christ that is in my brother and my sister is greater than me it's time we started looking at this this uh these things not just a letters but to get into a privacy with the lord everyone that claimed to be a message believer that's the call and the angel of death is outside i'm not using it to scare people off but the angel is there all these signs are there actually god is showing so many things to people it's all over the place it's time for us to be more serious about it it's time for god to speak to us in a silence where people look they don't see but you see something yet is not written but is written do you want to get to that that's where we're going i'm trying just i tried to give you an example of the level of discernment i see it constantly i see god opening the world even in example i saw one day here i'm coming i am in the woods maybe i'm praying myself i'm praying i'm thinking about something i start thinking about the conversation between cain and abel i start thinking about this and i say it must have happened this way when i come to church it was almost word by word what i was thinking word by word that abel must have spoken to cain about the revelation it would almost word by word what was it the big things happened in the silence they happened in the secret greater things happened at that time amen god help us god help us by his grace and mercy god help us god bless you hey man musician can come whether ban is not true that the day of redemption is actually here the day of redemption be filled with [Applause] patience [Applause] is the day of redemption is [Music] is [Music] is is be filled with let's have our head you forgive me for taking so much time [Music] sometime i didn't know how to go with this message [Music] but by god grace i i pray that you understand the purpose i kind of went off and preached about [Music] the ministry what i went through but if you look closely you see scriptures have a portion that the elect need to catch is a silent part is not just knowledge but is a something that gives you conviction it's something that tells you that it's i [Music] it's me who said william branham you're not in this church by luck [Music] this church is not [Music] led by superhuman and your brothers sisters beside you are not superhuman they are human but christ in them is greater than you god starts showing you not just the letter but showing you the hidden message the hidden manner that he has predestined for you what that does it brings fear what is a fear reverence respect i start started respecting god more i respect his word more i have a reverence now not because someone said it a pastor said it that minister said it god spoke to me in private the public message [Music] god had added something to it a mystery god of abraham is the same today [Music] will i hide from abraham what i have what is silent our time when abram heard the secret he start he start begging asking god [Music] interceding if we truly hear the message through the message in the silence portion we truly will intercede because he will not be the preacher who is telling us to do it but he will be god himself telling us we will do it in a selfishness way it will be because we are convinced that's why we are concerned it's time for the pride of christ in time for the message anyone under the umbrella of the message to come home to return to his own land the senses is taking place the death angel is outside i need to make sure i am right i am i want to make sure it is well with my soul [Music] precious heavenly father i'm sorry i'm usually very careful with time what it happens let anything that was said maybe one word help somebody in churches they often people on the sidelines sometimes people are in certain condition father we're talking about people that will recognize you in this tough time but what about us the people from inside we need also to come home it's not just those who don't know you but we that know you for years it's time we pause and make sure that life is dramatizing it's time we look at our log and see that is not soft dirty rotten it's time we pause and say god i want to make sure the blood is applied god help us this message is called for more seriousness is it time to go to our needs and pray more it's true but it's a time where we gotta be serious that if the book of the act is continued to be written i don't want to be a hinderer in any way to the bride of christ i want to be a blessing to the bride of christ i don't want to be a hindu i want to hear directly from you then when men speaks i will know it is not a man it is god heavenly father bless your children bless them for the patient they had listening to a broken up message thank you for [Music] for everything you are doing for us you expressing our your love in a very tough time but you still talking to us very seriously that's love that's the way you expressing love to us thank you father bless your children bless the church the ministers in the church the deacons the trustees the everybody that labors for us to have a service so many people labor here the musician the song lead and everyone some people the work is not visible sometimes they are on their knees praying for this church father blessing each and every one and give to them the desire of their hearts we pray this in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen uh can we sing that time in that song in his time as a brother comes [Music] in day town [Applause] [Music] in your time [Music] you praise the lord what a wonderful place to be in friends the security of a personal walk god is allowing all other foundations to be shaken and the everything that can be shaken will be shaken i don't believe this will be the only shaking or the last shaking but everything that can be shaken will be shaken only that which is not shaken shall remain we've got to be founded on the solid rock of jesus christ which is the revealed word in this hour and i praise god that there's a sure foundation that there's a place to run into there's a hiding place in this hour of trouble that brings a true sense of security because the security we're finding out is not coming from the government our security is not coming from the normal routine of life because that's changing our our security is not coming from our jobs our security is not coming from our income our security can only be found in a personal walk with jesus christ that i made contact with the eternal and something on the inside has awakened to life and i've made a connection with him outside of that there's no sure foundation and i love what he was saying about the third pool because in the third pool that line went outside from outside the message to end the message to end the little room you understand from outside we know the message is christ but i'm talking about as a form of preaching or as an understanding from outside to inside but that's not it yet that's not the destination coming to truth and an understanding of the basics of the truth and the restoring of the word but you've got to go to the word himself and the word himself is in the little room in the inner chamber just like you you've got the you've got the flesh and you've got the spirit but down in the soul is where christ abides and so we've come from outside of truth inside of truth but we have to unite with the person of truth and from then on it's a sure foundation for us we have to hear from him we have to catch the mystery for us because it's not just the mystery oh i think this is so important it's not just the mystery of what brother branham taught but it's the mystery of us we are that mystery we are a portion of that mystery and the mystery is me i'm a part of the mystery and that mystery inside has to be unlocked friends and then when the mystery is unlocked and to you it's no longer a mystery to you it's a secret because you went into the secret place and it turned from mystery to secret and now you realize what the mystery was all along it was the mystery was a bride and you're part of that oh i thank god for the word i was encouraged by the word today and i don't care how long he takes amen because with the way things are going now amen every service is a privilege and we're here to be here i don't think any of us are in a hurry anymore and then we're all just ready to feast praise god oh i just appreciated that and i loved his application of agapo love it was good i appreciate that so much amen god bless you let's pray for one another let's hold each other up amen we're coming to showdown this is the hour that god is going to show where his word is and no more denominationalism no more churchianity but it's showdown time and he wants to show where he's planted the seed and where it's at and it's time that it's got to bear fruit and it's going to be his life on display amen let's not run and hide from these things but let's face them head-on because god is bringing a show down on purpose intentionally because he wants to display his word amen god bless you all dawson if you'd like to make your way around back with mom and dad we're going to have a baptism here in a few minutes i just thank god amen this is encouraging in the hour of trouble this is encouraging to me that god is drawing to bring life forth praise god i also want to say god bless you brother nathanael it's good to see you in charity enjoyed that song how many appreciated that especially how many was that your heart's cry amen our brother was able to catch an inspiration and put it into words but what he put in the words was the desire of my heart amen god bless you let's sing a song um uh consume me lord can we sing that song how many would like to go into the inner chamber and just say consume me lord i don't want to move in there and get my head pumped full of knowledge and and come out of theologian i don't want to go in there and come out proud and arrogant and better than everybody else but i want to go in there and i want to be consumed on that altar and i want to be completely destroyed and i want to come out different than what i came in and i wanted to be christ living through this body of flesh no longer the old life or the old desires of the old nature but i want the nature of jesus christ i want to go in there to die i don't want to go in there to learn something i don't want to go in there to have something to brag about but i want to go into that little chamber so that i can completely totally die be annihilated and come forth as a new creature in christ jesus we only go there to die so many people don't go into that room because they don't want to go in there to die they'll come into the tabernacle under the umbrella of the message because they like the experience they like the atmosphere they even like the truth amen but to go into the little room you've got to be willing to die and you've got the desire to die you have to want to be totally stripped down and remade into the image of jesus christ let's not avoid that room let's run to it amen let's see how fast we can get in there and say god consume me amen burn me out lord and put your nature on the inside let what you put inside come to life this is the hour friends not for for him to share his glory with you this is for his hour to rise and shine in his bright form oh praise god let's sing this song together [Music] your spirits and make me go let me be [Music] me by the fire make me let me let's sing it again me your life and bless the broken [Music] let me be praise god what an exciting day for all of us especially for the sanders family for dawson i had a chance to talk to dawson and dawson knows what he's doing and he knows why he's doing it he's got the right desire the right pull in his heart and he's had this desire for a long time and mom and dad has watched him has become a desperate desire to be baptized to keep the word to
