[0:00] he is the same yesterday today and
[0:03] forever he's alive everyone we're not
[0:06] pointing to an empty tune of 2000 years
[0:08] ago we're pointing to living Epistles
[0:09] that have been raised up out of Creeds
[0:12] and denominations you don't think it was
[0:13] a big deal that God's been raising up
[0:15] his body you don't think it's a big deal
[0:17] that God spoke the word called you out
[0:19] of dead denominationalism Dead
[0:21] traditions of your man your own human
[0:23] pride and he pulled you up out of that
[0:25] lifted you up why he's the same
[0:27] yesterday today and forever he's a
[0:30] living Risen Savior this Church of the
[0:33] Living God is the proof of his
[0:35] resurrection not to point to an empty
[0:37] tune of 2000 years ago but to see the
[0:40] body of Jesus Christ manifested
[0:41] attributes of his grace living Epistles
[0:44] red of all men condescending from the
[0:46] highest Heights becoming the lowest of
[0:48] lowest and of individuals
[0:50] gods and flesh again
[0:52] but remember when God's in flesh it's
[0:54] never ascending it's never saying look
[0:56] at me
[0:57] remember where that attitude came from
[0:59] that's a spirit that's an antichrist
[1:01] spirit that becomes something look at me
[1:03] I'm the big one I have the great
[1:05] understanding I'm the Bride of Jesus
[1:07] Christ remember who ascended who wasn't
[1:09] content with their position Lucifer
[1:11] Lucifer wasn't content in the position
[1:13] that he had as the right hand of God he
[1:15] wanted to be a little bit more you see
[1:17] that that discernist lust that he had to
[1:20] be a little bit better just a little bit
[1:22] better than God and to exalt his his
[1:26] position above the stars of God you see
[1:29] what he was doing with that attitude he
[1:32] was a beast
[1:33] and when he tried to go up he went to
[1:36] the pits of hell
[1:37] let's see the difference here
[1:39] we are already seated in Heavenly places
[1:42] in Christ Jesus The Virtuous body of
[1:45] Jesus Christ manifested on Earth the
[1:47] attributes of God but watch what you'll
[1:49] do in this life
[1:50] watch God in flesh God in flesh doesn't
[1:54] make himself big God and flesh makes
[1:57] himself little
[1:58] because only a big man can get little
[2:00] and that's what we're finding now so
[2:03] Brad have a great ministry yeah but so
[2:05] humble so simple remember when they
[2:07] lifted him up it struck me years ago I
[2:09] shared with brother Jeremy when God
[2:11] lifted him up before all the people how
[2:13] was he lifted up
[2:15] on a cross
[2:17] that's how God lifted him up before the
[2:19] people and waved him before the people
[2:21] what was it a man that submitted his
[2:23] will to God's will he said not my will
[2:25] be done but thine will be done God and
[2:28] God lifted him up as an example before
[2:30] the people what was it a man that chose
[2:32] to do the will of God he fought it out
[2:34] in the Garden of Gethsemane and he
[2:36] dripped great drops of blood as he began
[2:38] to say it's not my will if there's any
[2:40] way for this cup to pass me by but it's
[2:42] not my will it's God's will be done
